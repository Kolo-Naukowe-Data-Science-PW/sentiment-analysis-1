"Mr Bean",2011-06-12,"my first ten we got walder frey2 we got aemon targ1 even if they did shorten down his three tests we got tyrion telling his back story 5 and we have the dancing tent and another decent fight 2 the only negative is this very wtf shae thing okay shae what and no halfman killing but ill move past that considering everything else"
"Asarlai",2011-06-12,"there were several good moments but nothing to outweigh the depressing dany and ned storylines"
"Ran",2011-06-12,"my first 10 as well amazing"
"Nihilist",2011-06-12,"210 we spend more time introducing shae then on the battle that puts the starks in the advantage the pacing and general choices on what to show given the material astound me the scene with tyrion playing a game went on for like 7 min longer then the time we get for both battles combinedwtf more thorough post later after i have rewatched i did think the acting was very good i just question the writing editing and decisions on what to show edited by nihilist 12 june 2011  0936 pm"
"Spanky",2011-06-12,"lol at the super loud minority 1010 probably the best episode of the entire season so far"

"Noir Dove",2011-06-12,"1010 amazing im glad a show spends more time on characters and their personal stories than 10 mindless minutes of hacking fyi martin is writing blackwater himself"
"YoDaddy",2011-06-12,"very happy again as is my standard how does it do in following the books i rated it excellent the whole tyrion guessing game thing was a huge bore for me though and it felt like it brought the episode to a halt for a bit i gave it an 85 i have liked these last two shows far and above the first seven after reading some of the previous posts i see what pleases me doesnt sit well with others it really shows that people are diverse in what they want from the show"

"Ser Frank Haven",2011-06-12,"10 out of 10 the pace was a bit fast but the ending is was nailed it its absolutely perfect even though ive read the book it still pains me to see nedd die"
"zippypoodle",2011-06-12,"910 very good episode"
"Asarlai",2011-06-12,"it wasnt terrible but no one else thought it was kind of slow paced they focused on several insignificant parts while skipping over the more exciting bits the end had a big emotional impact yeah but like 40 of the show was just eh"
"GSP",2011-06-12,"6 i was going to give it 4 but decided i was allowing my infuriation over getting ripped of two major and important battles cloud my judgement too much im tring not to let having read the books cloud my judgement of the series still i could only give it a 6 seriously if this is the gameplan they are going to follow seasons two and three are going to give me an anuerism i know they cant get everything in there and from a budget standpoint might as well cut out the big battle scenes but if this just turns into a soap opera while wearing swords ill be sorely disappointed get a significant budget for large battle scenes for season 2 please for the sake of my mental health"
"Abaddon",2011-06-12,"loved almost every part i understand they had to cut the tyrions battle sequence but couldnt they have shown them charging into battle and then found him unconscious on the field after the battle next to the corpse of a kill of his having him knocked out by his own men was cheap and lame very disappointed by thatother than that i thought it was easily the best episode of the season i have to give it a 1 for the tyrion misstep so 910 for me"

"Robb_",2011-06-12,"910 i think at least one of the two battles should have been shown but it is understandable why neither werent they were going for the shock factor of robb capturing jaime and that moment paid off in my opinion maybe its because i havent read that far in the book yet to make me dislike how it was done the ending was really well done i hate that stupid little cunt joffrey though"
"Dalan",2011-06-12,"9 out of 10im still disappointed at not a single tower of joy reference just before neds death there seemed to be a hesitation and i thought there might be something but no otherwise this series has far exceeded my expectations of an adapted series yes some things have been changed yes roz has been annoying but this series has gotten me hookand my fianca for whom the last fantasy anything she got into was the lord of the rings movies is thoroughly hooked she cried when ned died and she never cries with movies she hates me for getting into the show but is addicted now"

"MMGarrett",2011-06-12,"10 i may be in the minority but i loved the guessing game scene i thought it was a great way to tell the tysha back story i was hoping for some reference to the tower of joy or at least a promise me ned somewhere i think we went through the entire season without a single reference to neds mysterious promise im curious how they will fill this gap down the line still i loved every second of this episode it just gets better and better and better and better   "

"Bronn Stone",2011-06-12,"ah yes comparing a play written hundreds of years ago while being performed in a theatre is an entirely valid comparison to a live action television series that type of reasoning is a great contribution to the level of quality and analysis on these boards bravo siras a viewer i have to wonder if they cant even show small scale engagements like the whispering woods which could of been done relatively cheap with it being dark and all how will they show blackwater the wall the fist mereen yunkai and astapor i would even settle for low budget close up and thick in the fighting battle scenes instead of the gorgeous sweeping shots of massive armies we deserve instead we recieve nonexistent battle scenesthe inability to show great battles is just as much a characteristic of television as it is on stage in one case it is physical and in the other case budgetary but both are steadfast and unbreakable rules you can either accept it or not watch frankly if you cant accept it probably best you dont watchlist the great large battle scenes in an ongoing television series between actual people not spaceships or other graphic elements i get philippi on rome and that is it and even that one was horribly fake lookingand i wont even touch the horrific sense of entitlement that says i spent my 1995 a month on hbo and somehow i deserve blah blah blah deserve really wow they gave it a budget of 50m for ten episodes they producers spent it as best they could that scene with tyrion shae and bronn cost 11000th of what you wanted would have cost and there arent 1000 such scenes to be cut talk hbo into 200m and im sure you can get more but i am not willing to pay 100month for hbo just for that well actually i probably am but there arent enough of me to make it workif it gets better ratings and sales there may be more budget down the road but since season two is probably going to start shooting next month you can expect the battle of the blackwater to be less than youve imagined but thankfully since youve promised not to watch we wont have to tolerate you pissing on our collective corn flakesall i can say is that i got to see a great rendition of the death of eddard stark an incredibly moving scene if glossing over the whispering woods was what i had to give up to get that ill take it every time"

"brokor",2011-06-13,"2 details that i missed greatly in this episode and kinda ruined the experience although i appreciate the producers work bastard sword comment as people that have read the books know longclaw is neither a 1h sword nor a 2h sword it is a bastard sword like john loved this comment in the books and i rly missed it from the series tyrions story about tysha and how he had her last but gave her a gold coin cause after all a lannister is worth more the story made no sense to me or the people that i watched it with that havent read the books without this last piece of information what the story left us is that tysha was a whore that fucked the barracks excuse my language we missed that critical character development for tyrion also shae is baddd nothing like how i envisioned the role and her accent makes my ears bleed bad casting imo the first one in the series so farapart from the age differencies which i can tolerate but maybe thats just me didnt care enough for the battles but one scene in the dark with hooves echoing between trees in the whispering wood would be plain awesome that confusion and panic from both soldiers and horses i felt when reading the novels was breathtaking wish i had seen it in the series also grey wind they make ghost growl and bark but not grey wind whats up with that anyway the 2 details i stated first are my biggest disappointment because they wouldnt cost anything in budget or screen time which imo goes to show that the writer didnt have an understanding of the show and just chose to represent some lines of dialogue without their deeper meaning excited for the last episode will stay tuned in the forum aswell to learn about bluray releases and such edit about the last scene which many of you comment on i didnt have a problem with it but it didnt move me as much as the books did maybe ti is because when i see sean beans face i immediately envision him saying i would follow you my brother my captain my king so i dont think i will ever be able to buy him as another character the character that plays yoren is amazing and once again arya is the only girl in the world that could play this role damn i need to rewatch lotr when will the blu ray extended trilogy come out edited by brokor 13 june 2011  1259 am"
"SFA-OK",2011-06-13,"pretty much every episode including this one has been around a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me probably closer to 6 to be honest and the reasons for that score are pretty much the same every episode i didnt mind the tyrion backstory scene too much shae is definitely not what i pictured especially her accent did she have one in the book same goes for walder frey definitely not how i pictured him the actor who is playing bronn is doing a really good job even though the character is definitely different than the one in the book imo im liking how he is handling the character the budget constraints really showed in this episode one of the best scenes so far in the show imo was tyrion addressing the different tribes right before battle i thought it done really well and dinkledges facial expressions were hilarious but then he gets knocked out before the battle even starts ok i guess i can live with that but what is starting to bug me is how no matter what the scene is  dany and the dothraki robb tywin winterfell or kings landing there is always what seems to be about 2030 people in the scene its killing the epicness of the story robb says he has 20000 men but im not sure if i believe him because from the looks of things he has about 30 if the show was being filmed in a more abstract or artsy way itd be easier to overlook this but the show is shot in a very literal downthemiddle way and so these omissions are starting to really stick out for me i think someone on here mentioned it has to do with the sag hopefully hbo can fix this i thought neds execution was done really well i think people that havent read the books will be pretty shocked it mirrored the book really well"

"Greyjoy67",2011-06-13,"i gave this one an 8 it still deserves a high rating because the acting was brilliant  the last scene was absolutely perfect i was close to tears actually it was that well done arya looking on at the bellowing crowd reminded me of narnia for some reason another fantastical story and yet both had a very human feel to them and thats what this series is a human story  a drama it just happens to be a drama with infrequent violence was i disappointed at the lack of a battle well yes i still was slightly and thats why it doesnt get a 9 or 10 like previous episodes i agree that after all the build up of a tension between the starks and lannisters there should really have been something to show it finally bubbling over into a battle even if it was just 2 minutes of hacking and slashing i did enjoy tyrions scene about his wife i think they got the mood of it just right but they didnt really need an extra 34 minute scene introducing the girl in such depth perhaps it was those few minutes that could have added weight to the robb storyarc i also feel that the jon snow storyline could have been condensed a bit and found myself groaning when they revealed the targaryen thing in such a drawn out manner maybe its because i knew it was coming but at this point in the story it is not an interesting enough revelation next to the action that is actually happening down south so yeah i would have given it a 7 but the execution scene was fantastic"

"suncoast",2011-06-13,"i also only registered here because of this episode i am a long time reader of the site though from before the series and have been an avid reader of the series since college i think the dramatic side of the episode was still there and enjoyed it for what it was in its own right separate from the books the slumber party and game scene was a little drawn out for my taste but i did like the revelation by tyrion coming into play though i think it lost some effect and luster minus the gold coin for him at the end the final scene was definitely gut wrenching im not as upset about the battles not being on film but i am rather upset at the way tyrion was portrayed tyrion is no super dwarf warrior but was very much an exceptional commander in the field when the opportunities were given him and he fought as best he could given his attributes in the books for the overall dramatic effect of the episode i could have given it a ten but between the disappointment of absolutely not a hint of actual action in the field and the portrayal of tyrion i can only muster to give it an 8 out of 10    the tyrion thing just miffed me a bit too much edited by suncoast 13 june 2011  1126 am"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-06-14,"not having them fight in battles on screen is like saying neds honourable but full of compassion and loves his children instead of showing that in his scenes and then executing him and expecting the words you halfarsedly chucked in to compensate for the lack of any genuine content"
"reiver",2011-06-14,"or cutting a lot of littlefingers manipulations and cleverness in favour of him telling us how smart he is oh wait i liked this episode the most of all the series so far it wasnt great but it worked well as a tv interpretation of the book and for the most part the changes intrigued rather than annoyed me shaes personality for example or the northern army not splitting as fully the change that did irk me is the last part of the tysha story being left out it removes so much of the dissonance around tyrion that i think it makes for a less interesting character as to the battles well i agree with those who say not seeing jamie was a loss i feel that a lot was sacrificed early in the series to shoehorn him in and there were some pretty shitty scenes as a result why go to all that effort then neglect an excellent and far from expensive chance to include him that the scene would have been all kinds of awesome makes it doubly dissapointng for the wider battles im not so bothered in the same way i didnt need the play with the ass scene im quite happy to not have the violent equivalent the broad strokes of the battle and the drama involved combined with the outcome is all i need i dont really want to see a few minutes of extras hacking at each other so by that standard it wasnt a great job but im not overly saddened either that said it may be a result of reduced expectations from what has largely been a rather mediocre show an 8 this week"

"VikingMaekel",2011-06-14,"long time lurker first time posteri gave the episode a 910i thought it excelled in portraying neds execution and pretty much everything else i thought the twins looked particularly greatmy only nitpicking is that roose bolton wasnt given command of the foot and thusly that the ford over the green fork isnt blocked and that tywin isnt outmaneuvered by two forces which forces him to retreat to harrenhal eventually i am curious to see how that all is going to play outas for tyrion to me it makes more sense that tyrion gets knocked out early in the battle than that he slays several men i found those parts in the books surreal as if tyrion had plot armoror the tywin postbattle scene where he learns that robb wasnt in command and was riding hard to riverrun with most of his menat that point in the episode tywin didnt know where robb was is my guess from the preview of ep10 we learned that he has that postbattle debriefingyeah its about character but how about they show how great a strategic move robb madeyou didnt see it robb sends home tywins spy thinking hell have twenty thousand howling wolves on his ass yet robb wasnt there and sent a small diversion they way they filmed it im sure the new viewers thought that he was there with his twenty thousand as well thats about as showing as strategic moves can get edited by vikingmaekel 14 june 2011  0604 am"

"Tadco26",2011-06-14,"there were some scenes i really liked from this episode like the ending and maester aemon<U+0092>s talk with jon and all of the wall story line as well as the opening nedvarys talk but as a whole this was my least favorite episode by a large margin the biggest disappointment is the changes to shae<U+0092>s character so far in the book she seduces tyrion pretty much from the start but here she seems almost stuck up and bitchy and certainly not seductive it<U+0092>s kind of funny that the show finally gets a chance where more sexposition with tyrion and shae would have fit fine and they choose to add drinking truth or dare and then add exposition about things that don<U+0092>t even happen in the books when they are so pressed for time bronn north of the wall for a job even worse were most of shae<U+0092>s comments she is threatening her employer refusing to answer questions when she is willing to have sex for money challenging his intelligence by saying he should have known tysha was a whore spoiler when we later find out she wasn<U+0092>t the conversation went on for too long and did not feel like something i could imagine those characters possibly doing together the first night tyrion met shae based on the changes they have made to shae so far i would have preferred they just made ros into shae cut the littlefinger whore monologue and had her reappear here after heading south from winterfell they also cut the end of tysha<U+0092>s story where tyrion was forced to use her as well last and pay a gold coin because lannisters are worth more the reason tyrion falls for shae is because she is so convincing at seeming innocent and accepting and completely smitten by him he allows himself to believe she loves him the tv shae on the other hand him with replies like <U+0093>who women you have paid<U+0094> in reply to tyrions comment about how enjoyable his company is refusing to participate in any meaningful conversation and all and all coming across as very cold for someone who has just been given the equivalent of a dream job financially this version of shae<U+0092>s only relation to the book version is her name and that she is a whore drogo<U+0092>s fall into a near death state didn<U+0092>t come across very well to me either in the books he took an arrow in addition to having his nipple cut off and couldn<U+0092>t fully lift his arm here he just gets a scratch and the next scene he is dieing<U+0085> without explaining how drogo ignored instructions not to drink or to properly treat his wound it is hard to understand how in the context of the show dany would possibly request much less insist that mirri to be the one to continue to treat drogo<U+0092>s injury instead of a dothroki healer the lack of battle scenes of course was also disappointing though not all together unexpected i just don<U+0092>t understand why they bother to change the description of what happened and numbers of troops for something that they didn<U+0092>t show in the books rob took a portion of the cavalry to capture jaime in an ambush while the majority of his force was under roose bolton<U+0092>s command vs tywin so what was the point of changing this description that they didnt show any way a forced march to attack with 2000 vs 30000 as the show describes was quite unbelieveable for me why bother changing it when you aren<U+0092>t going to show it i didn<U+0092>t like the addition of jaime challenging robb to a duel either in particular robb<U+0092>s response that he would lose even if robb did believe that and based on his comments in the book where he says he would defeat jaime again when catelyn asks if he is scared of him when trying to persuade a jaime for aryasansa captive exchange this does not appear to be the case i don<U+0092>t believe he would publicly admit such a thing in front of his men it is irritating to have lines that i really like from the book shortened or cut to add lines that aren<U+0092>t based on anything in the books and add nothing to the story i can accept the realities of budget constraints even if they are disappointing but it<U+0092>s hard to accept the idea that good dialogue from the book was cut due to lack of time when significant parts of the episode are dedicated to dialogue not based on the book in any way and changes that dont have any clear explanation for needing to be changed individually some of the things listed above could be ignored on their own as nitpicks but all together they combined to really poison my impression of this episode the good news for the future of the show is that most nonreaders and apparently a good number of readers really liked the episode but as an adaptation it was a let down for me only enhanced because i am going to have to deal with their changed version of shae for 3 seasons"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-06-14,"the lack of battle scenes of course was also disappointing though not all together unexpected i just don<U+0092>t understand why they bother to change the description of what happened and numbers of troops for something that they didn<U+0092>t show in the books rob took a portion of the cavalry to capture jaime in an ambush while the majority of his force was under roose bolton<U+0092>s command vs tywin so what was the point of changing this description that they didnt show any way a forced march to attack with 2000 vs 30000 as the show describes was quite unbelieveable for me why bother changing it when you aren<U+0092>t going to show iti didn<U+0092>t like the addition of jaime challenging robb to a duel either in particular robb<U+0092>s response that he would lose even if robb did believe that and based on his comments in the book where he says he would defeat jaime again when catelyn asks if he is scared of him when trying to persuade a jaime for aryasansa captive exchange this does not appear to be the case i don<U+0092>t believe he would publicly admit such a thing in front of his men it is irritating to have lines that i really like from the book shortened or cut to add lines that aren<U+0092>t based on anything in the books and add nothing to the story whilst i am emphatically not a fan of their treatment if jaimes capturea i thought robb was saying he would lose no matter the outcome because the lannisters would not give up if he killed jaime tywin would kill everyone with a double consonant ending as a revenge and write a song about it so either he would lose a captive or his life plus hes got jaime captive and routed 30000 men duelling jaime would be sooooo stupid even if he thought he could wincoolgif classbbcemoticon altb  it acted as a fairly meagre attempted substitute for some action to try and remind us that jaime can fight which is good though not enough because thats kind of important to his arc and so far the show has depicted the opposite love ncw he nails jaimes character but drawing to ned in a duel and looking like losing that sucked c its pretty in character for jaime in fact he does it so much in asos and affc he may as well have lets end the insert situation with a duel you and me he loves his duels as i said its a character trait and a vital one at thatd robb is not stupid enough to think he could beat jaime in a fight when hes actually thinking straight and not making petulant comments especially after jaime killed 10 men trying to get to him and only lost because he got his sword stuck in robbs bodyguards corpses even if it did happen off screen and thus may as well never have happenede admitting that he at 17 would not match the most famous sword or one of in westeros in a swordfight is not a sign of weakness its a sign of maturity and intelligence and was picked up as such by the unsullied on twop"

"ArorA",2011-06-15,"long time lurker first time poster i joined specifically to post my displeasure with this episode 110 im never watching this show again they butcher two important and relatively small scale battles compared to the future battles in the series if theyre gonna do this to small scale battles then i might as well quit watching right now because i dont want to watch a terrible blackwater episode i might as well not set myself up for disapointment i didnt even get to enjoy neds death because i was fuming about that the fact that i got screwed out of two major battles i cant believe they pulled a rome on me this is even worse then when they had a seven episode buildup of a fight between pompey and caesar and then just show the aftermath you just lost yourself a viewer hbo edit thanks for the useless time wasting tyrion guess what scenethis is a tv drama series not war reenactment theyve got 10 hours to tell a story of a 1000 page book if you want to devote 5 mins to every battle there will be no time left at all to further the plot i agree that they dont always make the right scene choices the shae scene is a good example but i have a feeling that they are going to use her as major plot driving point in the future so maybe a good introduction was necessary they also needed to explain the 2 battles that went on better so nonreaders could understand the significance of what was happening battles arent plot drivers but the aftermath of battles are theres nothing better than a good battle scene but also nothing worse than a bad one i totally understand why they would sacrifice the battles for major plot driving scenes neds death  drogo resurrection it was just unfortunate that they also lost the plot driver of the battles defeat of jamies whole army and lifting the siege of riverrun edited by arora 15 june 2011  0910 pm"

"freamon",2011-06-16,"i would have loved to see a battle scene yet i understand why it couldnt be done however knocking tyrion out with a warhammer before the battle even started was cartoonish and stupid he slept through the entire battle this battle was a great character development opportunity for tyrion he got more confident more experienced in battle commanded greater respect from the tribesmen and his father tywin after fighting in this battle spoiler he is going to be a commander during blackwater unless they knock him out before that one too this experience was huge for him going toward that besides his valor here played a part in tywins decision to send him to kl as his proxy i wish theyd showed him running from the camp on his horse in front of his men and cut to him standing exhausted and bloodied and surrounded by corpses at the end he looked pathetic being carried on a cart having taken no part in the carnage this is my main problem with this episode i gave it a 7"
"DecoyRunner",2011-06-16,"the scene where aemon reveals his identity seemed a little rushed i suppose even in the books it didnt have a large effect beyond jons own struggle with duty but i still thought it could have done with another one or two minutes of dialogue to really make it clear exactly what aemons place in the targaryen family was maybe im placing unwarranted significance on it because of the fact that egg took the throne because of aemons decision this of course eventually led to aerys ii becoming king which in turn eventually led to roberts rebellion and the premise for the entire series i almost wish i could have seen the show before reading the books its hard to enjoy it as fully as i think i might have"
"Lion of Venice",2011-06-16,"i gave this episode an 8 instead of a 10 for two reasons the changes made to shae i dont mind when the tv show changes something about a character if its for the better but i liked book shae better you dont need to give a character a foreign accent or a mysterious past to make it interesting even if i do understand the need to make her recognizable from the other whores and roz above all master aemon really cant sell his performance to me i dont buy that hes blind nor that hes wise and knowledgeable just personal taste i think everything else was excellent i loved the final scene with ned and every single moment bronn was on camera"
"flyingwind66",2011-06-16,"810 dammit shae spoiler i was pretty neutral about her in the books until she sold out tyrion like i knew she didnt actually care about him and tyrion knew it too but she did more than just sell him out seemed like she was happily whoring from her constantly changing backstory too she feels so much more like a b right from the getgo and not sympathetic in the least spoiler so im really going to be cheering when she finally gets it now that the hands necklace is a pin maybe tyrion will stab her eyes out before pushing it into her throat and ned spoiler i wanted some flashback dammit toj andor to his father and brothers death rest of the episode other than that excessively long tyrionbronnshae game sequence was totally awesome especially aryas how about a nice fat pigeon lol just the way she says it"
"Abaddon",2011-06-16,"i liked book shae bettermy first question would be do you like the book shae character as presented in only the chapter she is introduced better or are you comparing the character we see in books 2 and 3 because thats not really a valid comparison we have no idea what they are going to do with this new shae and i agree she is quite a bit different at first blushsecondly what exactly about the book shae do you like better i always thought she was a pretty uninteresting character and didnt do much except give wicked smiles and pout and call tyrion my giant of lannister what makes the book shae so interesting in the first place im genuinely curious not trying to pick at you"

"Oneru",2011-06-17,"long time lurker here and this discussion has finally pushed me to register and comment its just my opinion on the matter no need to start heated discussions on it i can understand that people are disappointed by missing the battles but it didnt come as a surprise to me as far as i know the blackwater is the only large scale battle that george martin describes in full of course this is because it is the only one where he has a proper pov to show what is going on but the whispering wood and the battle for the green fork are only described partially or as aftermath for me i didnt miss the battles at all the fights are the least convincing part of the series for me so far and the way they showed the lannisters slaying the starks in kings landing looked so bad to me that im glad they didnt give 34 minutes of precious time to mindless slaughter its not braveheart though the whole river run situation might be a bit unclear to nonreaders they seem to have chosen not to introduce the tullys at all in this series no blackfish etc so this just follows their logic robb won a battle against the lannisters and caught the kingslayer thats what matters and thats whats depicted about the shaebronntyrion slumber party i dont understand how readers can dislike this scene spoiler it is a buildup for whats to come like the oft mentioned stannis baratheon and the constant showing of theon greyjoy as a pretty nasty lad this scene shows that tyrion is a cunning little halfman and knows exactly how people are or at least how bronn is but when it comes to shae it shows perfectly that tyrion thinks he knows shae and her type but he actually could not be more wrong this is a great buildup for what comes in the later series where tywin keeps stating that whores are tyrions greatest weakness and tyrion keeps thinking he knows what hes doing although he is constantly getting played by shae what i absolutely loved about this episode is that it started with darkness and only the sound of neds breathing and it also ended with just the sound of neds breathing the whole execution scene was fantastic i loved every detail of it cant wait until next sunday"

"I love Cersei",2011-06-17,"what have i started with a marginal note as much as some of you seem to want it i cant give you any comparison tv show thats better made on a similar budget might be because i never ever watched a tv show since friends  was it some 7 or 8 years ago im the reading type its just the independent feeling that some momentssceneschoosings of restricted locations come off as deliberately cheaply executed maybe backed up by the experience i gathered as a photographer or studying cg at university and thus being able to estimate what can be done with what kind of effort or done to save effort and thus money like i said before there are details that could have been done better without much cost like better adjustment of color moods in some images so i do not consider the budget of the series as a limitation to these things same thing but unconnected to all above with the wolves i understand you cant have them misbehaving around your expensive actors in many shots but to have them real wolves run or even just sit before a blue screen and put them in later in one scene or the other wouldnt take millions of  regarding this episode a cgenriched picture of jaimes 30000 strong armys camp sometime before the ww battle or something of the sort would have done so much also seeing jaime trying to cut his way free to rob defeating some men in a misty wood between lots of tree trunks and shadows would have gone such a long way too imo you see im not talking of expensive additions or lotr style epicness i really didnt want to answer on this topic again since the whole point of the discussion wasnt important to me a mere side note id rather discuss the episodes selection of scenes the storytelling and acting than speculating on what can or cannot be done with what kind of money but seeing what i helped get rolling i felt i had to explain just this a neon rose ferrari can look cheap whereas a much less expensive metallic dark blue mercedes can look just great its not always a matter of budget now for the offended fanboys i want to stress that by no means i intended to put the series into a bad light its a glorious and wonderful series and im very happy and grateful it has been done so i can watch it and i certainly do support it as lies in my power because i want many more seasons to follow it doesnt matter that i like the books more i still love the tv show"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-06-18,"the context is the story itself the show isnt changing the basic story its not eliminating the battles or tourney from the plot its just altering how they are shown to fit the budgetif someone made a tv adaptation of a scifi novel like pandoras star or some other book with lots of space battles but rather than showing any scenes in space merely had long dialogues between people talking about the battles people would quite rightfully point out that there must have been severe budget constraints the same holds true here there is an expensive tourney with all the greatest knights in the land in attendance and there are only a few dozen onlookers there is an army of 18000 that you never actually see nor get a hint of there are grand populous cities that seem to fit within a couple sound stagesim not saying the series is utter rubbish because of it but only that it is abundantly clear that certain elements are left out because there is a lack of money to create them you dont need a comparison to other television shows to see it is this a limitation of tv in general perhaps maybe this is the best that could ever be done on television thats fine but still doesnt change the fact that given the source material the budget forced the producers to cut certain cornerswhat you described is very poorly communicated by saying its low budget the term low budget should be used in relation to other relevant budgets tv otherwise you could define every single tv budget in history as low budget which makes no sense its also really funny how some people are complaining about how budget constraints must have prevented them to show the battle of the whispering wood despite that we arent even shown that in the book which in comparison has an infinite budgetand you also move on to what i wrote about that this is very obviously a limitation of tv in general since rome had somewhere around twice the budget and still didnt show much of the battles because quality shows cant have battle scenes of significantly lower quality as that will become disruptive saying that rome is a low or even medium budget series is crazy talk ergo got is not a low budget tv series by any reasonable view if someone disagrees with that then he is definitely comparing the show to movies whether they realize it themselves or not and that can only come from that not being someone to think things through properly and it in turn means that the viewer himself is the big reason why the experience isnt as good as it could be nothing can ruin an experience more than unrealistic expectations and obviously some people expected this show to do things that a show twice as expensive didnt do its harsh but i think those deserve to be disappointed because it will be a good lesson for themas for one of your later posts im surprised that you didnt get the same feeling with rome when i watched it i felt it was obvious that they didnt have the money to do the battle scenes and other grand scale things it was that show that taught me that a story can also easily be better by removing focus from battle and putting it almost entirely on individual characters and i was quite certain got would be the exact same kind of show im quite curious why you feel like quickly skipping past battles in one show is different from the other and i hope its something else than having read the book before got spartacus was entertaining for what it was but if you think that show looks better than got we will likely not find any common ground in our opinions which is not necessary for this discussion though"
"ser_nerdick",2011-06-18,"what you described is very poorly communicated by saying its low budget the term low budget should be used in relation to other relevant budgets tv otherwise you could define every single tv budget in history as low budget which makes no sense its also really funny how some people are complaining about how budget constraints must have prevented them to show the battle of the whispering wood despite that we arent even shown that in the book which in comparison has an infinite budgetits low budget for the story they are trying to tell as for one of your later posts im surprised that you didnt get the same feeling with rome when i watched it i felt it was obvious that they didnt have the money to do the battle scenes and other grand scale things it was that show that taught me that a story can also easily be better by removing focus from battle and putting it almost entirely on individual characters and i was quite certain got would be the exact same kind of show im quite curious why you feel like quickly skipping past battles in one show is different from the other and i hope its something else than having read the book before got spartacus was entertaining for what it was but if you think that show looks better than got we will likely not find any common ground in our opinions which is not necessary for this discussion thoughi think its because rome focused on a much smaller group of characters while got is more epic in scope and has a lot more locations and characters to deal with also as others have mentioned the budget constraints arent just apparent in the lack of battlescenes the strange absencereappearance of the direwolves and the limited number of extras make it obvious as well"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-06-18,"its low budget for the story they are trying to tellits beyond me how that wasnt apparent to everyone as soon as we heard this was going to be on tv and yet again thats not at all the same as saying that its a low budget series which was the statement this discussion originated from in a low budget series you wouldnt have this kind of workmanship on costumes weaponry etcso if the initial thing had been a statement that someone thought tv wasnt enough for this story i wouldnt have thought there was anything wrong with that just as sad that i would have thought it was apparent from the starti think its because rome focused on a much smaller group of characters while got is more epic in scope and has a lot more locations and characters to deal with also as others have mentioned the budget constraints arent just apparent in the lack of battlescenes the strange absencereappearance of the direwolves and the limited number of extras make it obvious as welli dont quite see it so im not sure if i understand your point as for the direwolves absence that has nothing to do with budget i try to remember any shot in rome with more than 700 extras in it as i roughly counted in the largest got scene but i cant remember one although its some time since i last saw it though so there certainly might be someand theres of course the aspect of rome being hideously expensive so if something falls a bit short of that it hardly says much edited by tywins bastard 18 june 2011  1028 am"
"So1ar",2011-06-18,"why do people keep saying things like if you want to see an epic 500 million dollar movie with massive battles go watch lotr braveheart or troy i havent seen anyone who is complaining about lack of battles say they want a battle scene of lotr caliber most of us realize that is unrealistic but it shouldnt be unrealistic to see an actual fight take place after so much build up my main disappointment is they way the green fork and whispering woods were set up it would have been nice to see tywin setting in the reserve with his commanders and giving orders then when the fighting is about to start he says something like where is the young wolf then we cut to robb in front of his men and explaining where he is and what is about to happen that would have taken about 56 minutes and it would help nonreaders from scrathing their heads so much then we cut to tyrion waking up and go from there that would have been just fine imo overall i was disappointed with the green fork but i didnt mind missing it as much as missing the whispering wood now my reason for this is not to see some swords clashing around but to see jaime kicking some ass i dont think its been said enough how much of a badass jaime really is my nonreader friends get that hes a lannister a knight and a warrior but they dont know how good jaime really is and i think that is a huge flaw on hbos point seeing jaime in combat is as important to his character as tyrions exposition im serious when i say this if people actually see him fight and think to themselveswowhe really is a badass then it will mean so much more spoiler when his hand is cut off"

"Marcus Adler",2011-06-14,"itll be my least favorite episode of the series save for maybe one of them however to be fair there were certain things it did well 1 jorahs duel  went exactly as it was written in the books well done on that 2 the cinematography  shots of the crossing and the dothraki sea were excellent in this episode especially 3 walder frey  portrayed fairly well 4 the blood magic in the tent  the howling voices were ominous eerie  it couldnt have been done better however my gripes with this episode seem irreparable 1 the battle at the fork  the ultimate copout tyrion is supposed to develop and acquit himself well here in the series no such luck  a lot of fans were upset about it and the people in charge should have been able to predict that 2 the whispering wood  i wouldnt have minded seeing this skipped so much had the rest of the episode not been so underdone in terms of actionconflict but with tyrions own battle being skipped this was a doubleblow 3 severe differences in character portrayal  i know i said this as 1 but it bears repeating  tyrion seems quite the fool in this battle when hes supposed to be portrayed as a character who overcomes sizable disadvantages i cant stress this enough  the green fork had better be replaced  not just made up for by the blackwater but replaced by a scene that shows him beginning to find his strength at this point in the series the tyrion of the books is leaps and bounds beyond the tyrion of the series peter dinklage plays him well but the script is doing a real disservice to his fans"

"The Knight of Grasses",2011-06-13,"the reason why i like toj and i think many people agree is that its one of the few parts of the story that does sound epic not only you have ned and howland reed but also three knights of the kingsguard who are suposed to be awesome they are suposed to be the last breed of true knights even in memory toj is the most epic part of all the booksi see where youre coming from and many others apparently but i definitely didnt get that same sense of epicness from that scene i think it was partially because the event itself isnt described in great detail which seems to have some signficance but its also because it hasnt had much effect on the actual story to this point obviously it affected ned but hes dead nowthis also explains my lack of patience for the dany chapters in the book they have up through book four had next to zero impact on the rest of the story and the rest of the characters im positive that all of this toj dany etc will pay off in the end but for now its just kind of there and so not really of great interest to me i understand your point of view though in some ways im sad we dont get any arthur dayne the sword of the morning is such a sweet name"

"Sauron The Small",2011-06-14,"as well as they handled neds execution it was very well put together maybe the best editing since the pilot not showing a single sequence from the whispering woods is inexcusableyou have a fight sequence with three of your leads rob theon and jamie that doesnt require cgi or even a huge budget no horses simply a wooded settting a dozen bodies scattered about a dozen stuntmen in combat rob in a fierce fight looking over tentatively as jamies cuts through three or four men on his way to rob greyjoy killing a few men with his bow then a confrontation between rob and two karstarks vs jamie jamie gets subdued after losing his blade in one of robs men rob then standing over jamie with theon and his wolf at his side all of them bloodied exhausted and amazed they are still alivethe scene would have payed off in spades it could have shown theons loyalty which makes his betrayl next season even more dramatic jamie combat prowess and warped sense of honor  who has been sadly off screen for almost three full episodes and most importantly it sets up rob as neds worthly successorfor producers what a missed opportunitycompletely and wholeheartedly agree with this oneactually glad they cut out all that spikey helmet nonsenseunfortunately dreading how theyll handle blackwater almost sure well never get the bridge of ships and tyrions those are brave men lets go kill them line"
"legba11",2011-06-14,"on the lack of battles i think they were stuck in a tough place with the tywinbolton battle those big epic battles look like crap unless you are making a 100 million dollar movie not to be offensive to anyone but if they had just showed tyrions small part i think it would have played like a comedy routine hes a really small guy watching him charge into battle is likely not going to come off well next year they will have to figure out how to do something the wispering woods was a poor decision to stick with the pov a short inexpensive scene would establish the three major characters jaime as the true swordsman of westeros theon as robbs loyal friend and robb as the commander who wins with his wits it would also make more sense next season when they flashback and show him killing the karstarks on shae who cares her only purpose in the books is a sounding board for tyrion to have conversations with when hes not with bronn she does that fine her other job on the show will be to show her tits she did that fine her final job on the show will be to make those awful slurping sounds well see if she can do that on neds death the show version is preferable to the books for me the show actually gives you false hope several ways jaime being captured right before makes you wonder if they know in kl and aryas visible sword and charge towards the stage adds a huge dimension is she going to somehow make a rescue is it going to be even worse and is arya going to be killed seeing cersei and varys reaction adds a nice touch also"

"Cereal Forel",2011-06-14,"im torn on this episode everything they showed was fantastic but as a jaime fan i cant help but feel cheated at missing his one major battle it sucks even worse because i could have sworn i remember reading somewhere that the directors were so excited to give us the whispering wood battle scene wtf happenedits the same with the brandon stark flashback from the previews before the show started where did that go our only chance for it now is as a jaime flashback while hes rotting in riverrun"
"Shemy",2011-06-14,"i took this as a moment of comic relief i was certainly amused especially by theons expression maybe roslin is the one that catelyn was referring toi know that some have commented that robbs response to catelyns marriage arrangement in the show seemed immature compared to the books butisnt that just as realistic for a boy trying to grow up all at once and become a man and its not like that reaction is totally out of character for him in the books either you could argue that the red wedding was a result of his immaturity regarding women he allowed himself to be comforted by jeyne which started the whole messed up chain of events that culminated in the worst party everi dont understand why people say that comment was immature its a question every person would be asking themselves and i actually find it quite odd he didnt inquire about it in the books in the show the very fact he consents after theresponse that catelyn gives him shows a much deeper sign of maturityif anyone on these boards were arranged to be married in this setting or in westeros the first question youd ask if you could especially if you had a choice in choosing would be are any good looking on first glance say it wouldnt be and ill call you a liar"
"valacirca",2011-06-14,"there were only two considerably disappointing things for this episode1 no whispering woods2 drinking game took too longotherwise everything else was good to awesome im on the fence regarding shae so ill not call her disappointing yet although it seems to me that the actress cant act all that well compared to the rest of the cast"
"valacirca",2011-06-14,"i dont understand why people say that comment was immature its a question every person would be asking themselves and i actually find it quite odd he didnt inquire about it in the books in the show the very fact he consents after theresponse that catelyn gives him shows a much deeper sign of maturityif anyone on these boards were arranged to be married in this setting or in westeros the first question youd ask if you could especially if you had a choice in choosing would be are any good looking on first glance say it wouldnt be and ill call you a liari guess its just that considering the gravity of the situation its sort of a trivial and immature thing to consider with all the other shit thats going down everywhere"
"Bahimiron",2011-06-14,"maybe this means we wont be seeing quite so much whining from edmure as they head off toward the twins in s3 in my own moment of spergitude i was kind of disappointed that bronn mentioned a braavosi knife game that could cost a man his fingers when theres a perfectly good reference to the fingers game that could have been dropped in there oh wells"
"rockxwl",2011-06-14,"i was thinking that by omitting the part in tyshas story where tyrion was forced to take her and pay her a gold coin the writers may not be planning on introducing that fact at all for purposes of the show that story probably was meant only to serve the purposes of garnering a lot of sympathy for tyrion as a character since well be spending a lot of time with him in s2 and to hammer home just how cold and ruthless tywin lannister is some people would take the fact that tyrion went along with his fathers demand not to mention that his body actually responded after seeing what he had seen as a showing that tyrion is not actually a good person many people would probably use that part of the story as a reason to dislike the character instead of feeling sorry for him we dont have the luxury of tyrions inner monologues to hear him talk about how disgusted he was with himself and how my body betrayed me"

"WildlingGirl",2011-06-14,"woa everyonefirst id like to say that one of my favourite parts of watching the show is coming on the boards and reading everything you guys have to say afterwards i love sympathising or disagreeing on every single point and its so funny to see people who love the books equally be so torn about how things are portrayedmy own two centsi didnt mind too much the battles missing although whispering wood was a skirmish and could have been shownheard in very short i did exclaim what no whispering wood when i saw the guys approaching catelyn but the scene was very interesting in itselfchanging robbs brilliant strategy was a whole different thing but im waiting to see how its going to pan out i did like that the saved scout threw tywin off the scent thoughtyrion missing his battle scene made sense to me and it was funny that he was trampled but more importantly he was kept safe that way without showing him being unrealistically heroic the spiked helm vs horse belly would also be funny of course but keeping him alive until that point would be a stretchshae looked very exotic and appealing in my view totally unlike rostype whores that tyrion would be used to she is a whore as she first approaches tyrion after shes agreed to the terms of contract and her eyes glinted at the gold you couldnt spend if you lived a thousand years mention the never did i ever game was very poignant evidence of tyrions issues and need for companionship he feels he cant get anywhere bronns reaction to the statement look how much fun were having was telling everything we needed to know making shae mysterious and insolent added fun and gave tyrion a reason to keep her around and us to wonder who she might be on the other hand bronn and shae always gave me the impression that they do start liking tyrion although its his gold that keeps them about and they dont sacrifice their lives for him its kinda similar to liking your boss at work socialising with him but still not investing in his company when its about to dissolve bronn and looking for another boss shae for tyrion it was a deep betrayal by both but for them it made sense as a career choicevarys is totally portrayed as i had him in my head love him to bitsmaester aemon also delivered despite my earlier dislike the speech was awesome and jons reaction priceless jons dilemma is clear and justified by the screen facts daenerys drogo jorah and mirri maz duur excellent scene chills down the spine very well done the difference in danys belly size shows how much time elapsed to make that wound fester so much dany did look like 8 months along incidentally she was very slim to begin with and wouldnt have gained much weight on horsemeat and constant travelling anyway i wasnt sure about her falling on her belly but i think it works in the condensed version of events i did miss it being night and the shadows dancing i always connected that with melisandres shadowbabies in terms of magic no matterfinally the scene the epic scene the setting was great the crowd right i loved the sevenpointed star banners i was glad yoren was pointed to arya by ned himself always wondered how hed found her sansa got the shock of her life second of many im afraid neds execution was done terrifically i really felt for the stark girls for ned for his pain and shame at casting honour aside to save his family and getting killed for it jack gleeson is the perfect joffrey he really pulled off the whole pffft soft womens hearts flawlessly and ice was very much recognisable i just want to rewatch it now but it was very painful even knowing exactly how it would happen sniff sniff im planning a real got marathon as soon as its all over and i have a whole day in my disposal drygif classbbcemoticon alt  ps1 newbie boyfriends theory neds going to turn up at the wall with or without his head joffreys not long for this world that sword is not done talkingps2 newbie colleague turned up at work yesterday with the first book and says he cant stop reading it one more convert yay"

"Bronn_ManofHonour",2011-06-14,"woa everyoneshae looked very exotic and appealing in my view totally unlike rostype whores that tyrion would be used to she is a whore as she first approaches tyrion after shes agreed to the terms of contract and her eyes glinted at the gold you couldnt spend if you lived a thousand years mention the never did i ever game was very poignant evidence of tyrions issues and need for companionship he feels he cant get anywhere bronns reaction to the statement look how much fun were having was telling everything we needed to know making shae mysterious and insolent added fun and gave tyrion a reason to keep her around and us to wonder who she might be on the other hand bronn and shae always gave me the impression that they do start liking tyrion although its his gold that keeps them about and they dont sacrifice their lives for him its kinda similar to liking your boss at work socializing with him but still not investing in his company when its about to dissolve bronn and looking for another boss shae for tyrion it was a deep betrayal by both but for them it made sense as a career choiceps1 newbie boyfriends theory neds going to turn up at the wall with or without his head joffreys not long for this world that sword is not done talkingps2 newbie colleague turned up at work yesterday with the first book and says he cant stop reading it one more convert yay his story about tysha setup both shae and bronn betrayals of tyrion although deep down inside all threes leaving of tyrion is about his father despising him which seems to have lived on in cersei one of the things tyrion hates to realize is that his father never let him have endeavors of his own and instead kept him on a rich allowance this really stops tyrion from ever having any independence from tywin tyrions speech to bronn in episode 8 about no one ever being able to outbid him for his services friendship sets up what comes so beautifully nobody outbids a lannister except another lannisterhowever what bronn does with the settlement cersei gives him is truly truly bizarre could bronn be working for tyrion secretly still"

"GoTreviews",2011-06-15,"she poisoned drogo really where is this coming from i understood from the novels he was too arrogant to comply with her directions and got himself screwedits mostly coming from mmd finals reactions to dany you knew  the stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now pretty much claims that she wasnt trying to help drogo at any pointthe show really support that theory since unlike in the books were drogo rip his bandage off he keeps him till the end well till jorah removes it at least theyre trying to make the mmd did it understanding of this story arc as the obvious choicei might be biased however i dont think i ever believed her to be ready to help drogo at any point in the books"
"legba11",2011-06-15,"second watch so this weeks theme was how your actions affect not just you but your loved ones we open with neds honor being worth more than his life and apparantly the thousands of lives which will be lost in war however varys you bastage you took the only thing he had left has him weigh his honor against the lives of robb sansa and arya then we see how jorahs crimes have devastated his father do we know why mormont is on the wall catelyn has her father and brothers shoddy treatment of their most powerful bannerman thrown in her face i realize the man is a creep and a lech but he is still your strongest bannerman then aemon spells it our directly in why the black brothers take no wives and father no children and then you see how the mad kings insanity led to the death of all his family khal pays the price twice for danys actions his wound and loss of respect was caused by her refusal to follow the rules of dothraki pillage and then she brings the witch into it jaime pays the price of tywins failure and his own but thats not in keeping with the theme tywin blames the scouts but lets face it when your intelligence overstates the wmds err troops by 10 fold you look at the top of the pyramid for answers"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-06-15,"well the pov system deal is that our perception is the character perception in this case young inocent and ignorant about medicine dany i realy think mirr wanted to help drogo but i think it all changed when she realized drogo was not just any khan but one of the biggest and that his son would be the stallion who would mount the worldin my opinion its not obvious what mirri does with drogos wound in the book but when she talks about that dany didnt save her because life after everything is taken away is worthless then it doesnt make any sense that she would ever want to help drogo neither out of compassion nor out of fear because she hates the dothraki and what they do to other people and she already sees herself as dead so she has nothing to feari dont think the whole thing with drogo actually dying from battle with another kahl which is the case if you think mirri helped him is nearly as intriguing as a story as dany alone creating the doom for drogo and the khalesaar through her imagined compassion towards mirri edited by tywins bastard 15 june 2011  0810 am"
"BlackTalon",2011-06-15,"i must say i was confused by this in the books too drogo dies because he disregards mmds warnings as has beeen mentioned before and what happens when jorah carries dany into the tent again thats because he disregards mmds very clear explicit orders even though he didnt hear them admittedly yet grrm later makes it somehow sound like she planned and orchestrated everything like when she tells dany sth along the lines of your son wont mount the world now will he i think thats one of the logical flaws in the book just like sansas socalled betrayal when it actually mattered a damn what she told cersei of her fathers plans to send them away after neds mercy cersei would have acted before roberts returned to the city in any case edited bc of unintentional spoilers edited by blacktalon 15 june 2011  0823 am"

"Cyclone49",2011-06-15,"wow what an episode i knew exactly what was coming but that was still one of the most tense hours of television ive ever watched  i had chills leading up to the final scene really liked the addition of ned noticing arya and pointing her out to yoren that was a really heart wrenching touch was slightly disappointed at the battles being completely cut out but i can understand why it was done it does cause a little concern for later seasons however unless they really up the budget the casting for shae is interesting  certainly quite different from the book version but a compelling take on the character all the same glad the tysha story finally got included was a little worried when it wasnt in previous episodes walder frey is suitably repulsive too i like how the freys basically seem to be being portrayed as the jokes of westeros even the interior of the twins looks like a shithole compared to the other castles seen so far and i love their ridiculous headgear"

"Leuf",2011-06-15,"tyrion is very much that funny little man in the books he uses sarcastic humor as his armor against the cruelty of the worldbut hes not slapstick lets all laugh at the dwarf funny youre laughing with him in the books not at him in fact its his reaction to that sort of humor that helps frame him for joffreys murder but its only been that one scene where theyve done that to him"
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-15,"i dont know why this is a big deal i admit i dont know why they left it out other than maybe to reveal it later in another tyrion bares his soul scene but i dont think its essential they got the point across tyrion was shamed tywin is a giant ass jaime is both protective and deceitful you dont need tyrions participation at the end to get thatyou could say he was too ashamed to complete the story and that he may complete it latter"

"So1ar",2011-06-14,"as much as i love this books i think neds death will hurt the show tbh we stuck it through because we knew these characters inside and out we were in their heads and knew their every fear and desire in television you dont get that you see these characters from the outside and the few enough that are likeable you route for ned stark was the main character for this show maybe not so much in the books but for the tv show he was the man now that hes gone i cant see the vast majority of nonreaders sticking around because of arya tyrion jon robb and dany if you asked a reader of the novels if they would stick around the answer is most definitely yes that is because we know these characters inside and out and want to see them progress through the story i cant see nonreaders having as much of an emotional attachment to these other characters and thus not sticking with the show"

"uryu ishida",2011-06-14,"no doubt there will be people who drop the show because of neds death but i think we overestimate their numbers due to disproportionate press coverage most people who put so much emotion into the show are now committed to seeing its resolution much like the readers were plus all the press coverage about what a controversial move this was can only be a good thing i think"

"Ser_Niall",2011-06-14,"i think the show will be fine the characters in the book that keep me reading as well as many others are who i consider the real main characters of the story jon snow and dany targaryen also jaime and cersei but less so than the previous in hindsight the show probably should have played up these two more because they will be carrying the series in the long run it might have been a bad casting decision to put sean bean as ned stark because people automatically think that the big name actors will be around for a long time if an unknown was playing ned nonreaders wouldnt be as upset about his death however with bean in the role it made the scene that much more emotional the 2nd season will be a challenge lots of good storytelling here but in my opinion its more about the war and less about character development season 3 if the show makes it there will be incredible storm of swords is my personal favorite of the series so far and it really develops several characters like jon and jaime"
"The Dude",2011-06-14,"neds death happened in the first book yet people are waiting impatiently for the fifth book to come out i really think after this initial shock the viewers will continue to watchyes a good number of us got over this fact in book one and have stuck with the series despite being strung along for years and suffering worse than neds deathi think his death only serves to draw us in deeper readers and viewers hes totally set up as the tragic figure but we dont see it first we just go along assuming the standard tropes that major protagonists dont get killed off yes in hindsight we see that it was inevitable yes it was upsetting but also exhilarating because theres real fear and consequences within grrms storyits what keeps us coming back too"

"ferthepoet",2011-06-15,"yah i think the death of ned is the least of the threats to game of thrones viability the biggest threats are i think 1 the cost of producing the show which should be among the highest ever for a tv production 2 real life game breaking events for example if dinkleage or masie williams were to die it could be doom for the series as i think no one would accept recast of those roles or the show without those characters 3 the volatility of the reader fan base i think most of us readers have all been contributing to the success of the show and i would dare bet that each reader has practically forced at least one non reader be a friend family member or significant other to watch the show but the reader fan base could turn on the show at any moment if they do a sufficiently significant deviation from the books keeping faithful to the books would be a huge task and definitely impossible if they do intend to adapt the whole of asos in 10 episodes 4 another show becoming the network darling right now hbo seems to be very happy with the show and could even be considered more popular than previous flagship true blood but if another show in the network became much more popular than thrones while at the same time being much cheaper to produce it could lead to hbo giving thrones the ax"

"Kadence",2011-07-10,"the sand snake theory is interesting but i dont think the tv producers would be thinking of them yet also her being oberyns kid would complicate things for them later but that is an interesting notionon the other hand if they go down the road of shae becoming less obviously smartmouthed against him and appearing to fall in love with him for himself well i think a lot of nonbook viewers may be sucked in by it just as tyrion would be she was so cold at the start she must mean it in fact it would probably be actually showing what that big lf monologue was all about how people know that maybe they shouldnt trust you but you make it so that they cant help themselves and so onyes thats true her going from stanoffish to more caring and fond of tyrion might actually fool tyrion causing the betrayal to be more painful and represent a darker turn for his character whereas in the book tyrion caring about her seems somewhat naive which even tyrion realizes but cant help himselfthe change in her demeanor to him in that sense is better  except for the fact that its completely illogical as a whore who behaves as rudely as she does wouldnt be a whore for long and would endanger herself considering the company she keepsim also concerned that her character will bully tyrion and be the boss of the relationship in season 2 which just isnt the way it should be tyrion shouldnt be getting bossed around by anybody but tywin"

"Corvinus",2011-06-06,"so in this episode we will get the first taste of large scale battles i actually hope we get more than a taste in the book the battle of the green fork was described in a fair amount of detail from tyrions pov while the whispering wood was only partially described from catelyns pov so i wont cry about if the whispering wood is not shown but i would like it if the green fork was shown in all its glory and gore for example there is one visual description where we are told of how the lannister army deploys over the field so i think this is another big test for hbo will we see a grand battle or will it all be just around tyrion and his wildlings i hope hbo did not fail this test like starz did camelot also had its battle this week the battle of bardon pass but in my book a dozen men against four times their number is not a battle merely a skirmish"
"Asharak",2011-06-07,"taking into consideration that the two battles in book 1 are the least epic in the series i would be really worried if they didn<U+0092>t do them some justice if they fail at these two how on earth would they be able to do the backwater battle in book 2 and the night watch vs wildlings battle in book3 while the battle at the crossroads is described in much more detail in the book i find the participants of the battle in the whispering woods much more interesting and it<U+0092>s after all the most important of the two i would prefer that they focused on that one in the episode since jaime has been the main villain of s1 and seeing the young wolfs army vs the kingslayers army feels more satisfying after all that build up edited by asharak 07 june 2011  1040 am"
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-07,"im expecting some cg of the armies gathering and then tyrion pov while he is near his man and some blured armies in the back once he charges the focus will be on him and some retainers near him about 40 or 50 would be more than enough to portray size the hardest part would be the clash of the armies gregor style when his knights charge the spear wall but they may go without it i at least hope tyrion fights that knight and make him wield the whispering woods could be done easily in the night with dense woods and a valey with about 40 or 50 knights riding with jaime in front then lots of horns and a charge i hope they show us the part where jaime charges toward robb and gets knocked now they could use cg for the armies i dont think it is that expensive right now i play a game called shogun 2 total war and not only the armies look really good but im pretty sure somehow that same technology could be used for tv edited by ser warpechowski 07 june 2011  1133 am"

"Lokhtar",2011-06-07,"meh i dont really care id rather them not show anything then show the pisspoor representation of the battles they have to show due to the budget you really dont want to be dumping millions on big budget fights because in a show with modest ratings such as this the budget is a big killer in terms of getting the series renewed every year id much rather have the series without the 12 big fightsyear and the budget remain lower rather than jack up the costs which would put the series at a much higher risk of cancellation if the viewership is disappointing even one decently sized battle scene costs a lot of money obviously itd be great if the series had a 200 million budget and would never be canceled but thats really not going to happen look at what happened to rome  i loved that show so much and yet they had to condense what was going to be four seasons into one just because hbo couldnt afford the extravagant budget and rome didnt even show any big battles  even so the production costs were tens of millions  with big battles it would have been ridiculous thankfully the budget for got is less than rome so it might be able to get away with lower ratings edited by lokhtar 07 june 2011  0423 pm"

"Gurney Halleck",2011-06-07,"im personally much more of a political junkie than a war boffin i think the battle will be ample for tv but nothing too saucy as with rome mentioned above the battle scenes in that were a bit average but with lessons learnt from that production im fairly certain got was treated with better project management and reservation than many previous titles should be worth the wait nonetheless would like to see tyrion charge the horse with the spiky helm too"

"John (Snow) Doe",2011-06-08,"i havent been very impressed with the fights so far any action at all was very welcome to me after the onslaught of dialogue in eps 14 but on an absolute scale it all felt pretty expedited and halfassed the nedjaime fight was a welcome departure from the book though jory getting knife through the eye felt pretty cheesy and syrios last stand was awesome but the cat  co v wildlings fight was too short the jon v wight scene was way too short and bronns trialbycombat fight did not sufficiently display his badassness he shouldve fought more gracefully  like a cat perhaps more like syrio since tyrions proficiency with an axe was omitted in the wildling fight itd be a nice addition in ep 9 the trailer clip has a nice shot of him in armor so i think were due some tyrion asskicking i expect the episode will flow a lot like the books  green fork from tyrion pov whispering woods via hearsay i wouldnt expect much production value or substance for the green fork however"

"Black Sheep",2011-06-08,"as long as they will make some clever artistic shots focus on some crossing sword and do not reveal that there are no more than 100 extras in the scene ill be fine with it of course id like to get some feel of battle especially men crying in pain and asking for mercy because that what really stood out for me in martins delivery of battle scenes shot of cgi armies might help to establish some epic feel and the terrain of the riverlands woods hills rivers might ease out the work on them but as long as they dont handle it the way they handled the hands tournament ill be okay"
"Khal Bob",2011-06-08,"im hoping hbo makes a major improvement over how the largescale battles were handled in rome because that was a big problem with that series imho cgi is actually expensive but it clearly hasnt been used to expand the scale of any of the other mass events in this show the tournament the wedding etc so heres hoping that the show has been saving its cgi budget for the upcoming battles honestly though i wouldnt be surprised if we see something along the lines of what we saw in rome  prelude to battle with a bunch of extras lined up on a ridge or something letting your imagination fill in the thousands of additional troops where you cant see them a battle scene consisting of some closeup fights and sound effects to give you the sense of a large battle having just occurred with quick cut to aftermath where what happened in the battle is explained in dialogue instead of it having been actually shown to you"

"Xanderpanda",2011-06-09,"showtimes the tudors had some pretty decent battles throughout its 4 season run particularly in the final season and i believe it was on a lower budget to what game of thrones has from hbo so it is possible to see some decent stuff in a tv serieshttpwwwyoutubechvgeh0pj3umqs edit from what i can see from searching online for reported budgets it cost 35 mil per ep for the tudors as opposed to 5 mil for game of thrones so they should be able to match the same effect if not out do it edit 2 also while they tried to avoid showing major battles in rome they did have this one at least which was done fairly wellhttpwwwyoutubechv0wq6cvxtqk edited by xanderpanda 09 june 2011  0554 am"

"aimlessgun",2011-06-13,"well the episode worked mostly but still a large disappointment frankly the biggest disappointment is not seeing jaime hacking through a dozen men trying to get at robb once he realizes the battle is lost im sort of poed we didnt get that actually"
"Asharak",2011-06-13,"after all that build up they could have at least given us one battle as a climax to the story the whispering woods would not bee particularly hard to show just people fighting among the trees i always wanted it to be as in the books  you see nothing maybe you hear something of it but you never see it so  pretty glad of that we didn<U+0092>t even get to hear it at least they could have given us that going by this episode when we get to the adaption of book 3 we will spend one or two seasons being told about how dangerous the attack of the wildlings at the wall will be and then we won<U+0092>t get to see it we will have countless episodes in s2 about the growing threat of stannis and the imminent attack on the red keep and then the battle itself will be skipped that is not good storytelling a story needs a climax it shouldn<U+0092>t just jump over it that<U+0092>s cheating the audience if they wouldn<U+0092>t show us two battles as simple as the ones in book 1 no way will we get the big ones in book 2 and 3 because they would be a lot harder to do"
"Goblonaut",2011-06-13,"yea i was kinda disappointed too about the battles though i will be satisfied if they show the battle of the camps more properly i think they could do blackwater better considering that sean bean is somewhat a high paid actor and he wont feature in the next seasonunless a flashback etc so they would get more money for doing some great battles if i had several million dollars i would gladly donate some to my favorite series to do them properly"
"Flou",2011-06-13,"i wish they would have shown what catelyn saw in the books torches in the forest sounds of fighting  dying men show some of the planning and maybe catelyn watching as the men leave to the battle now it kinda felt totally lackluster event since there was no real excitement i was wondering what they were even looking at at first didnt really expect anything from the bolton vs tywin fight since bolton wasnt cast nor named during this season and to be honest i think it was a wise move not to throw tyrion into midst of fighting makes him more realistic and they really didnt have the budget for the fight anyways hopefully we will see more with battle of the blackwater"
"Greywolf2375",2011-06-13,"didnt even notice the battles werent there with so many characters and plot lines much rather them spend time  money on that since the battle on the blackwater would appear different than just two fields of soldiers that might be interesting to see how they render it aside from moore trying to kill tyrion there isnt a lot in it still that would require being seen"
"DonalNoye",2011-06-13,"just because it doesnt need to be seen doesnt mean it shouldnt be tv is a visual medium and therefore it needs to be visually impressive the way were going blackwater is just going to be a closeup on sansas face while ros and the hound describe everything thats happening south park style that would get the point across just as well but personally i would rather see tyrion rally his troops and ride into battle i want to see davos apprehension and i want to see the river erupt into wildfire i want to see podrick save his master from mandon moore and i want to see renlys ghost smash stannis army"
"Starchaser",2011-06-13,"i havent nitpicked anything all season but now im seriously disappointed i feel scammed if they cant show a minor battle theyre not going to be able to do any of the best scenes justice they shouldve waited until technology was cheap enough to do it right or not do it at all"

"So1ar",2011-06-13,"the whispering wood scene overall was poorly done it would have been by far the easiest battle scene to show in the entire series but apparently they couldnt even afford to have catelyn see some torches and hear swords clanking whatever hbo but the thing that annoys me the most is we didnt get to see robb stand in front of his men before the battle so the audience would know where they were and what was about to happen instead we got a weird moment where the audience didnt know what just happened and then suprise jaime has been captured tbh im really upset with the battles i wasnt expecting lotr style combat but i mean come on how expensive is it just to show some large scale soldiers lining up and then cut to some close groups doing one on one fighting for about 2 minutes ie show both armies lining up and cut to tyrion and the mountain clans fighting and then tyrion is knocked out during that fight sigh"
"jellydonut",2011-06-13,"theres a third battle in the first book where robb lifts the siege on riverrun considering they changed it so he has the bulk of his army with him and the battle is set in the final episode i can only assume they held their guns for that particular battle waits to be proven wrong by scenes cutting from robbs tent to the courtyard in riverrun wackogif classbbcemoticon altwacko "

"pixelchild",2011-06-13,"the whispering wood scene overall was poorly done it would have been by far the easiest battle scene to show in the entire series but apparently they couldnt even afford to have catelyn see some torches and hear swords clanking whatever hbo but the thing that annoys me the most is we didnt get to see robb stand in front of his men before the battle so the audience would know where they were and what was about to happen instead we got a weird moment where the audience didnt know what just happened and then suprise jaime has been captured tbh im really upset with the battles i wasnt expecting lotr style combat but i mean come on how expensive is it just to show some large scale soldiers lining up and then cut to some close groups doing one on one fighting for about 2 minutes ie show both armies lining up and cut to tyrion and the mountain clans fighting and then tyrion is knocked out during that fight sighhi i couldnt possibly agree with you more i will admit that i was waiting for this episode more than any episode in the entire series solely because i wanted to watch the battles i was so excited and as soon as i saw tyrions fade to black from getting knocked out and then the aftermath of the battle i was so disgusted i lost interest in the episode and honestly a bit in the series i complained so much out loud my girlfriend told me i was ruining the entire thing for her so i shut upsome people like political intrigue and development and dont really care about battles being shown im not one of them i love epic battlesthey could have at least given us some cgi even if they decided to forego the battles it could have been done in a better waythis truly truly makes the series lose its epicnessmy question do you think that this will be it that for the rest of the series on hbo on whichever book the battles will be foregone"

"Cot",2011-06-13,"best episode for me so far with the aemonjon scene the highlight beautifully done im annoyed by the lack of a big setpiece not because im an action fanboy however the problem is if you have build up like this series has had for the last two episodes you have to have a climax a pay off yes neds death was the climax of this episode but it wasnt connected well enough to all the build up up north that was the biggest disappointment to me if we had the climax being a smaller skirmish with jaime being captured or the green fork in its entirety or even the relief of riverrun would have been the perfect episode as it didnt i had this feeling something was lacking and they can do epic i thought the twins was really well done for example still great episode but hope they splurge more next season"

"stannis for king",2011-06-14,"my post from another thread i didnt like how they robbed us of the whispering wood iirc it was more a skirmish with a few knights as jaime was rather over confident with his siege of riverrun and often went out with his scouts so numbers shouldnt be a problem with regards to cost and in the books i really loved jaimes i would offer you my sword but i seemed to have misplaced it knowing full well that it was misplaced in one of lord karstarks sons neck without seeing that it lost its dark humour and arrogance for me i just hope they have saved budget for next weeks episode a bit worried that dany is going to come out of the fire with spyro yoshi and godzuki around her still though i am loving this adaptation its only a opinion on my part but the more i think about it and the more comments i read the more sceptical i become i know nonbook readers i have encouraged to watch this have been asking me when are we gonna see some action i promised them this episode would be full of it oh well blushinggif classbbcemoticon altblushing  edited by stannis for king 14 june 2011  0743 am"

"Nihilist",2011-06-16,"i dont believe roose ever had a chance personally i feel that roose attacking the way he did was the first step in his betrayal of robb and his attempt to seize the north its stated several times that robb has little chance against tywin with his full force and tywin lannister wont be caught by suprise so roose attacking at all rather than menacing tywin seems foolhardy to do so after a night march when its almost a certainty that tywin wont be outmanouvered that way only served to tire his men that it was the other northern houses and their lords that suffered most from this battle while the dreadfort men seemed unscathed further adds to my conspiracy theory im not claiming that the whole red wedding and duskendale scenario was fully formed at that point just that roose was faithless from the start admittedly that has little to do with your point its just that i dont agree that the green fork was a viable battle in the books either i think like with the book the ruse works better without contact being made and to actually attack tywin rather than menace and distract is follyedit btw to those who said the objective for roose was to give battle it wasnt this is never mentioned once in the book he is only supposed to give the impression of being robbs full force attacking is actually counter to that as it reveals the truth ill admit it never explicitly says he wasnt to give battle either but the dialogue before the split suggests that doing so was not the intentionno the strategy was to lure tywin lannister north to engage their main forcewhen lord tywin gets word that weve come south hell march north to engage our main hose leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to riverrunand then robb commentsthe greatjon is always saying that we should smash lord tywin i thought id give him the honorso he is to smash him by not engaging him the main part of the host was always going to have to give battle roose bolton decided that instead of playing defensively hed go on the offense which didnt work out all that great"
"reiver",2011-06-16,"no the strategy was to lure tywin lannister north to engage their main forcewhen lord tywin gets word that weve come south hell march north to engage our main hose leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to riverrunand then robb commentsthe greatjon is always saying that we should smash lord tywin i thought id give him the honorso he is to smash him by not engaging him the main part of the host was always going to have to give battle roose bolton decided that instead of playing defensively hed go on the offense which didnt work out all that greathe has more men than i do and a lot more armoured horse tywin lannister wont be so easily suprised does he really sound like he thinks the greatjon will smash him also your first quote relates to tywins actions not to the northmens he also goes on to comment the eastern force will be all that stands between lord tywin and winterfell does that sound like he wants them to engage and be what he already admitted would happen defeatedif you were going to choose a quote the end of catelyns next chapter to confront tywin lannister is a much better one although i still dont believe it meant engage him in battle as its a complete misstep and pointless further we know from tyrions chapters the effect rooses army has on tywin that only underlines the pointlessness of an attack"
"RSasoiaf",2011-06-16,"there is another funny or not so funny consequence of these events in the series  no one did speak about losses fighting jaime if nothing else will be said about it we are made to believe that robb trully must be a great commander and his force must be a powerfull one  no robb frees riverrun and for sure gets reinforcements from the tullys  also it was not discussed how much of robbs victory was due to the situation and jaime being taken by surprise  considerng how good robb already did and how strong a force he hashe should now be close to tywin in numbers why the hell does he does nothing big with a force with which he could finish tywin once and for all what will they make up to justify robbs troubles and fears when ridding around riverrun and west"
"Podrick + Arya = Win",2011-06-16,"but tywin was just as smart as bolton and if he saw the whole might of the north descend on him hed stall just like bolton and so give time to jaime to take over riverrun"
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-16,"no thats definitely not good odds at winning at all its good odds of surviving more than one battle but with no horse against an army twice as large and much better composed and not unlikely to be better equipped the outcome of them losing was obvious and it still could have gone worse if tyrion and the tribesmen hadnt foiled tywins little strategyboltons mission was never to beat tywin it was to occupy him for quite a while and that was why bolton was chosen the greatjon would have made a bigger dent right away but since the footmen didnt have any chance of winning they needed someone to drag it out instead of attacking with bravado but as said in the show tywins host is in a completely different place so the whole scenario takes place in a different time frame and with different urgencydisagree if you read the art of war you will see that having a 2 to 1 disavantage is not that bad and you can actually win if tywin superiority was due to horse roose bolton would have to use some strategy to hinder their advanged null considering he atacked and tried to get the lannisters off guard maybe he could have acomplish that if his plans worked if he were to atack tywin camp before it had a chance to prepare the outcome would be very diferent cavalry or number advantage or not"

"Damocles",2011-06-16,"everywhere ive read ive seen people defend the absence of the battles no matter how poorly or haphazardly it was done even over what they did choose to show they didnt show well such as tyrion getting knocked out before it even began and the rather confusing treatment of the whispering wood it is worthy to approach this matter in more critical detail than for your average show because grrms story is set entirely within and revolves around a war so you have to expect that before even the first actor was cast or the first location scouted that someone gave this a lot of thought and obviously they came up lacking in how to pull it off there are three major arguments made in defense of how the battles were done 1 they didnt have enough time 2 they didnt have enough money 3 they didnt want to upstage neds death to this i would respond 1 this is an editing and a pacing issue by this time in the story there have been eight hours devoted to exposition and even several different scenes best described as sexposition lorasrenly petyr danys brother and maid etc we probably could have done without ten minutes of tyrion playing truth or dare with shae this one episode no matter how much they liked the actress i thought the initial scene with her was perfectly sufficient as a starting introduction 2 in my opinion and after some reflection the comparison to rome is unfair as rome did have a bigger budget but i am given to understand that game of thrones actually has a substantially larger budget to shows such as the tudors or borgias and both of those latter shows managed to pull off a fairly convincing display of a setpiece battle or at least the drama and the immensity surrounding such forces and hosts colliding revealing war as an extension of politics 3 part of the drama in neds death is the sense of scale and everything that is at risk not just in the present where his son is waging war with the lannisters but what the future might hold now that he is no longer going to be there to shepherd them through it but also the past thats why i would have given a hundred of petyrs creepy pandering illwritten sexposition scenes for a single tower of joy ned was in many ways a heroic and noble character and he met his end in a capricious and cruelly unjust fashion that should be enough drama for anyone although this shouldnt have been a surprise to anyone they have generally been unable to pull off war on even a small scale the fighting choreography has been clunky and unimpressive all season long there is never a convincing moment of viciousness and brutality  and are in fact some of the cheapest and laziest looking sword fights since wellever im not expecting something on the level of spartacus or even the vicious and visceral quick action of rome which really game of thrones should have tried harder to emulate both the tudors and the borgias had better sword fighting choreography by an order of magnitude bronns duel jorah fighting off drogos blood rider ned vs jaimeall remarkably boring and slow affairs a journeyman effort where a real pro should have brought in to polish it perhaps it was unfortunate for got that it came out at the same time as the borgias because we have evidence of a show with a smaller budget but a somewhat similar story showing us a vastly greater scale and with much more beautiful pageantry and set design the intrigue the violence and frankly even the ridiculous sex is way better"

"Werthead",2011-06-18,"as has been said before the principal cost of the production has been the size of the cast over 200 speaking roles some people have said theres 500 but unless theyre counting every background murmur in every crowd scene that seems to be a gross exaggeration in two locations with the cost of moving the cast and crew between two countries is a pretty big expense almost all of the other shows mentioned and others that arent like camelot are filmed in a studio with the locations used fairly nearbyat the same time i dont think its entirely unfair to say that dd have not succeeded in getting maximum bang for their buck sod the other cable shows look at the bbcs merlin in season 3 they had largescale battles using massive the same software used for lotr the closeups were very poor bad idea to use cgi soldiers for closeup work but the mid and longshots looked excellent the battle for camelot with the redcloaked guards holding the gate against an enemy incursion were pretty well done and in another episode involving similar battle scenes they simultaneously did cgi shots of a dragon not the best admittedly but theyve been saying they need to upgrade the dragon cgi model for two years now so they should have improved it and a whole load of shots of people fighting animated skeletonsmerlins budget is extremely modest but as well as all of the above they also have the added expense of filming in two separate countries the studios are in london the location stuff in northern france not the cheapest country in the world to film in though not as bad as italy i believe the budget of merlin is somewhere on the order of 2 million per episode or onethird that of thrones taking into account the fact that hbo are getting the use of the studios for free theyve made 50 of the budget back through foreign sales alone not counting fresh subs or onlinedvd sales and theyre getting additional local funding i think its clear that the show is not being run as lean and efficiently as it should be if it were they could be doing some pretty amazing stuff with cgi even if nowhere near the order of lotrthe biggest problem is that the cgi team they used had six people on it which was a bit lame shows like bsg and b5 back in the day had vastly more cgi crewmembers so its no wonder they havent done any cgi battles as with six people theyre probably struggling to do just composite shots and episodes 89 had a ton of composites in them more than people probably realise the scene with rodrik and cat looking at the stark camp had a number of boats in the lake all of which had to be digitally removed in every frame of every second and the odd cg matte shotfor season 2 theyre going to have 30 people so hopefully we should see a lot more impressive stuff being done"
"ShockWaveSix",2011-06-22,"so mistaking a force 110th the size of the actual force is believable the whole ruse works in the books because robb commits the majority of his forces to the battle this way simply makes no sense any nonretard would have scouts for miles around his encampment how these scouts cant tell the difference between 2000 and 20000 is mind bogglingthis part at least ill buy the way the show did it tywin is a good military commander but hes not infallible he already has word from his scouts that 20000 are marching towards him then on the morning of the battle his scouts see northmen cresting a ridge a full nights march closer than expected theyre not going to stop to count theyre going to run for their lives to rally the lannister camp and tywin is going to stumble out of his tent to a frantic report from the scout and hell order his army into battle will he figure it out pretty quick sure but by then robbs main force is miles and miles away and its too late to matteralso much was made in the book of people like blackfish being skilled at eliminating enemy scouts to cover movments why could that not be the case here edited by shockwavesix 22 june 2011  0229 pm"
"ShockWaveSix",2011-06-22,"having now seen the full season there are a lot of departures from the book some major some minor and most of them i totally understand or at least accept the battles in ep9 are the only thing i am disappointed in from the whole show partially it is the fact that they were skipped entirely of course i was hoping for an epic scene who wouldnt be the complete lack does not bode well for the blackwater partially its the way things are changed tyrion was at least brave in the battle if not terribly effective and it give shis character credibility which he now loses going forward my biggest issue is that non readers dont really know what happened they dont know that robb fought a major action in ww then another one at riverrun we barely know that rr was under siege much less that the siege was broken by an inferior force or that robb now has the alligence of the river lords we didnt see more of rr then a stone wall or two i understand budget limits but still disappointing edited by shockwavesix 23 june 2011  1124 am"
"Abaddon",2011-06-23,"it seems reasonable to guess that game of thrones burned a fair sum of money on the pilot episode that had to be almost completely reshot and switching one of their main shooting locations to boot but wertheads point is a very important one the size of the cast is frankly staggering way above and beyond what any of the other named shows are attempting its also amazing to think they only had six cgi artists and i didnt even consider that the artists had to do things like remove boats from lakes that looked perfectly empty in the show good job the optimist in me thinks a lot of the cost certainly not all of the 1st season wont be as costly in the second due to reuse of preexisting sets not free but cheaper costumes production work and certainly i dont expect them to have to reshoot practically a whole episode with a similar budget i think were going to see a smoother and more confident production with fewer missteps and a better product overall in the 2nd season which is good because i think season 2 has more challenges than season 1 and theyre going to need to be more efficient with their money this time around"

"snowzombie",2011-06-13,"thanks very much for the oh so friendly reply rest assured the feeling is mutual regardless of how he did it i still very much prefer that he made his exit with his honor intactthis show and this story is about those choices everything hed done was noble and honorable and it got him a cell in the dungeon between honor and death of his daughters or dishonor and his daughters living  plus the prospect of living out the rest of his days with his son jon  he was trying to do the right thing he learned too late that being honest all the time isnt always the right thing"
"snowzombie",2011-06-14,"i think peoples reaction to neds death is in part informed by hbos choice to cast him with the best known actor and to lean heavily on his charactersean bean to market the show its one thing for grrm to make the decision to have the character killed it tells you how his universe works  life is full of difficult choices the good guys dont always win i agree that having ned up at the wall is a tantalizing tease but in thinking about the story i can no longer imagine how things might have been had ned lived i dont want to go into detail because this is a no spoiler thread but rest assured newcomers  the story does not suffer when characters are subtracted from the narrative there are more than enough compelling characters to go around lots of new characters are going to be introduced next season but i can also see how that might be frustrating as well you do want one person to be your anchor but these are all issues about theme and narrative grrm did what he did for his narrative and his story hbo used sean bean to market the show because it was easy perhaps it would have seemed suspect if they didnt because he is the best known actor on the show theyre marketing to an american audience and i think the only american actors are peter dinklage tyrion and jason momoa drogo while hbo couldnt depart from the text of the book they did have a hand in shaping fans perception that ned was the person they should identify with in the narrative i guess what im trying to say is that i hope when the dust settles people can separate hbos marketing decisions from grrms narrative choices"
"The Anti-Targ",2011-06-14,"actually a dead ned makes the daughters better bargaining chips to some extent varys was tricking ned into making a false confession because he saw joff being legitimised through ned as advancing the cause of stability and ned living even better because that would get robb off the lannisters backs if ned had the ability to think clearly he would have realised that affirming joffs incestuous bastardy probably wouldnt put sansa in mortal danger but it would guarantee that shed never marry the turdking sansa actually ends up suffering because she remains joffs betrothed knowing the whole deal with noble hostages you dont kill them on a whim because live hostages are effective shields dead ones are like powder kegs means sansa and arya are safe so long as robbs a threat"

"MountainThatRides",2011-06-12,"well i have to admit this is the first episode ive felt conflicted about i thoroughly enjoyed it and i think its good from a television standpoint but this was bound to happen my expectations got the better of me these last two episodes are just way too jampacked to satisfy every desire they did a good job shaes accent her whole character in fact was far different i guess the earthy homegrown cornfed whore schtick was given over to roz shae is some strange foreigner with a mysterious past not at all the toughasnails bawdy firebrand we know from the books i really cant see tyrion being as fiercely attracted to her as the book version of shae but whatever tyrions confession the whole drinking game was a bit of a stretch despite a few fine comedic moments and while i thought it was an ok place for him to divulge they fucked it up the fact that tywin made tyrion take tysha once the guards were through and pay her a gold because a lannister is worth more is an integral part its still monstrous and certainly depressing but the book version is far more telling of tywins character hopefully he was just holding that little nugget back walder frey was wellcast  i actually enjoyed him and the scene but he never made a mention of tywin lannisters pride and how it irked him i thought that bit of motivation was very important still he satisfied no battle scenes i can understand this due to budgetary reasons but it was still disappointing i was actually hoping to see the battles or at least part of them  seeing gregor clegane laying about him ordering tyrion around see my signature was something ive been looking forward to thats just a personal quibble and doesnt really matter the whispering wood ive always thought would have been easy to do if they stayed truthful a nighttime battle where you heard more than you saw but i digress no mention of roose bolton they changed robbs strategy entirely but it still worked where it needed to i guess it doesnt matter in the long run one thing i did very much enjoy was maester aemons confession to jon its one of my favorite scenes in the first book and im glad they kept it intact the dothraki stuff was decent and played out as id expected in conclusion the final scene it was grand i didnt much like that ned saw arya but when he yelled baelor to yoren i changed my opinion it wasnt a bad change his death scene happened faster than i expected but the rushed confused and chaotic feel added to it cant wait to see my nonreader friendss reactions"

"House Snow",2011-06-12,"honestly the ending was so well done most of gripes dont really matter really liked the frey scene very humorous do wonder if nonreaders totally get the inside humor associated with it robb really coming into his own as a character although i wish they had cut his victory speech in fact i think that speech is a good example of why they didnt do the battles if a scene requires a lot of men and you just dont have the budget for it or you cant hide it then its not worth doing a bad battle scene is way more painful than no battle scene and even superbig budget films screw up battles scenes so awesome job by the kids in the final scene especially joffrey who is really giving arya a run for her money as the best kid actor on the show that look of revenge he gave sansa before doing it was pretty damn impressive acting imo shae scenes were kind of goofy and they changes some things probably not necessarily for the better i concur with leaving the lannister pays in gold line inbut in the big scheme of things its not a big deal its going to be fascinating to see the reaction of nonreaders"

"NW Deserter",2011-06-12,"not totally sure how to grade this episodeit had extremely good high points and some very questionable low points the dothraki stuff played out about how i expected nothing earthshattering until next episode it was cool to see jorah fight i know mmd is a minor character but she was well cast aemonjon was a very cool scene pretty haunting i had doubts about aemons actor when we first saw him several episodes ago but he nailed his monologue this time around walder frey looked far too young imo but his attitude and way of speaking was spot on first major gripe not showing any of the battles at all honestly this was a pacing issue i think tyrion was first walking out of his tent in his armor with something like 17 minutes left and for a second i thought maybe they were going for a 90 minute episodeand then we see absolutely no action at all same thing with the whispering wood maybe this was for the better and im alright with admitting that but it gives me a bit of apprehension about the huge battles in the coming seasons second major huge gargantuan wtf gripe shae ive complained on here about both littlefingers and renlys casting but in the end both grew on mebut shae is pretty much the opposite of how i imagined in every way except her body type what the fuck is up with her snapping at tyrion and belittling him having a foreign accent mysterious past what the hell third gripe kinda goes with shaes stuff but the way they chose to reveal tyrions past was ridiculous a drinking game with him her and bronn i seriously doubt that would ever conceivably happen one of the few hbocreated scenes i dont agree with robbs meeting with jaime and his speech afterward was awesome although slight side note  im a little disappointed that they revealed king in the north in the finale preview the entire confession and beheading scene was just breathtakingly done for the first time im confident in saying that this scene was better on screen than in the books largely because of neds last desperate attempt to save a member of his family it sounds like one of those things that martin wished he could have put in the book though obviously it wouldnt work with the pov structure but every single actor up there was perfect from sansas hysterics to cerseis reaction to her son to joffs smug satisfaction and of course to neds realization of whats happening whew heavy emotions right now that was rough to take in only one more episode to go worriedgif classbbcemoticon altworried "

"KyleLitke",2011-06-12,"so anyway my thoughts on the episode 1 disappointed they left out both the battles although i understand why not only for monetary purposes but also for time purposes no reason to spend that much money if youre going to show the battle for a minute or twoi very much expect the battle of kings landing to actually be shown for example since its a much longer and more important battle heck we dont even see the battle at riverrun in the books 2 shae didnt quite work for me here a little too cold and distant i guess didnt really fit with shae from the books for me but im perfectly willing to wait and see where they go from there with the character 3 liked the scene at the twins walder was great 4 wish they would have at least mentioned the name of roose bolton they didnt have to show him if they havent even cast him yet not sure if they did or not but he becomes such an important part of the books it would have been nice for robb or tywin to mention offhand that bolton was leading the group that went against tywin just so next season when he shows up again assuming he doeshed have to by the third season people can say oh yeah he was leading that other group 5 that last scene was really really well done im totally fine with the change of ned noticing aryawhile i dont think it would have worked in the book it absolutely worked tremendously in the show it made the whole scene more heartfelt explained why yoren went to arya necessary to stop her from charging up to try to stop it and made sure that tv viewers werent left like book readers were with a knife flying at arya and then no more arya chapters even knowing it was coming it was tough to watch but still really well done i have to watch it again tomorrow too i have a non reader friend who watches the show with me on mondays looking forward to that reaction"

"Rockroi",2011-06-12,"my thoughts on what was very good1 the most notorious scene in the book so far i will just start by saying that if got was going to be a successful show they had to nail certain things some things were the characters ned cersei dany others was the writing esp tyrion<U+0092>s scenes but there was one scene they had to nail or the series would not work that scene was ned<U+0092>s death it had to work on every level nothing could be left out and you needed the entire action and all the emotional turmoil in other words when ned died the show had to make you feel like the book didhere is what i have to say on it it was as good as everything in the book i don<U+0092>t know what other complement i could pay to the show from arya to ned to yoren to cersei to payne black hood  nice touch to joff to varys to littlefinger<U+0092>s little smile<U+0085>  to sansa who was as good as she needed to be and then some this show got made from this scene 2 aemon<U+0085> targaryen there are certain scenes in the book that i always enjoy on reread and some of my favorites are the ones that are dialog only one of those was discovering who maester aemon was and what its like to sit away from it all when there is nothing but pain and destruction for those you love a very strong scene i thought that the acting from aemon was very good this was a first and i even thought jon<U+0092>s <U+0093>wtf<U+0094> reaction was very strong in the end i felt that they tied the history of this story directly to a main character and it worked i also liked that they shortened the timeline of the targaryens it was more meaningful with aerys being egg<U+0092>s grandson 3 i was never nothing dany just rocks she is a fantastic character that is very well acted she has also grown the most as the show has gone on great scene with amazing emotion and culminating in jorah becoming the bad ass we know he is 4 tyrion lannister drinking games i really enjoyed this scene because it was a little bit of good acting and some fun always needed i also liked how we got the tysha explanation would have been nice had they done the same thing for the toj 5 robb stark i liked the way robb operated the whole season and he just keeps getting better and better this week he really felt like an inspiring leader i really enjoyed watching him ride to cat that all worked i also liked how he treated jaime and i like how jaime responded just another day at the office robb is now acting like a lord of winetrfell and the king in the north he is working really well 6 the lord of the crossing nailed it what i was iffy on1 men call me shea and not very often look this is a completely different character than the book and it will take a lot of getting used to she does not say the same things book shae says she does not act nor even sound like her she is the most different of all the characters from the book and i am not sure she works a little too much mouth and sass for my taste you<U+0092>re a millionaire whore at this point not an eastern philosopher maybe she will grow on me not certain what i disliked1 a game of rome maybe the greatest criticism of the hbo series <U+0093>rome<U+0094> was the culmination of the caesar v pompeii storyline was not a great battle which was historically accurate it was not the clash of arms with the ultimate political disagreement reaching its zenith with men in pitched battle instead you had a very strange <U+0093>montage<U+0094> of various soldiers and banners falling swords being drawn etc and then caesar says <U+0093>notify rome tell them caesar has won<U+0094> which is kinda cool but not what we signed up for where was the actual battle where was the actual climax got commits the same sin i don<U+0092>t even get a shitty montage i get pathetic comic relief of tyrion getting ko<U+0092>d by an errant warhammer and then postbattle foolishness hey look these two people are beating a third man with clubs lets make a shitty joke it was equal parts disappointing and silly yes i get it production costs blah blah blah seriously than cut something else battle is a huge part of this series that men die and die without dignity or company that this world is horrible and unfair and dangerous instead we get a lame joke and a post look at a battle that looks surprisingly empty in other words fail overall a great episode maybe one of the best so far but we all know it could have been and should have been better one last thing mt brother is about to come up and watch the episode on my dvr he has not read the books what<U+0092>s the overunder on the number of times he says <U+0093>wtf<U+0094>"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-12,"i agree with most of what you say particularly the battles that never existed in the book povs but tonight i felt the scenes collectively made the show feel small not enough extras or space filled or something and tyrion knocked out to avoid a battle scene was a stretch will he also pass out during the battle of blackwater next year and if they cant do a decent job with direwolves i have concerns how the hell they will deal with dragons razing cities loving that we can debate at alli complained a lot about the number of extras in earlier episodes and thought tonight there was a good amount of people involved especially wide shots of the dothraki camp on the plateau i would put money on tyrion going berserker at blackwaterdragons razing cities is 2 years away i understand why theyve deemphasized the wolves because they essentially had to on account of the dogs not being trained well enough or whatever i dont like it but what else could they do at that point for the future they can budget more appropriately for cgi critters and quite frankly for the dragons they obviously have to do so to begin with they rolled the dice on the wolves and lost however much like the battles id rather work around them than have them look lame"
"melicorn",2011-06-12,"about tyrions cuts im not really bothered that they cut his battle scene although i would have liked something in the books i kind of got the impression that tyrion had earned a little bit of respect from tywin by taking down a man and doing some damage but i could believe that tyrion getting knocked around in battle a bit while forces he had brought in did all the heavy lifting would be enough effort however i am very disappointed that they cut that last detail from the tysha story i think tyrion paying a gold to go last is really the most important element of his story maybe not for tyrions character but it said volumes about tywins i also think it is a necessary fact to really understand why tywin gets an arrow in the gut but perhaps it is just a detail they are holding out for revelation later although im not sure where else it would show upi dont really get what is going on with shae shes not the character i imagined either and she was one of the ones i liked quite a bit in the books although i started out pretty unsure on bronn as well and he completely won me over this episodespeaking of characters winning me over theon is being too wellacted how i am supposed to keep despising him when he is so enjoyable to watchi can hardly call the king in the north chant a spoiler im sure most nonreaders would probably figure it out as a logical progression of events from this episode actually most nonreaders were probably in too much shock to really notice everything in the teaser anyway besides on the scale of things that is going to be the least shocking thing that happens in the next episodei loved loved loved the last looks between ned and arya and the message to yoren not only did it really add to the emotional impact of the scene and give at least a little closure to one stark on aryas whereabouts but it solved that pesky little plot hole from the book about what a huge coincidence it was that yoren just happened to be passing by the statue arya was onalso i loved the freys little caps"

"KyleLitke",2011-06-12,"all for joffrey youre right i was remembering the line incorrectly where its said that robb took the greater part of his horse i was thinking greater part of his men robb has 50006000 men at riverrun which includes jason mallister who showed up after the twins and joined with robb the exact number isnt certain they say jaime has 1400015000 men and outnumbers them 31 but cat wonders if 6000 men will be enough to protect robb so we can probably assume thats the number although he only left winterfell with 12000 men he joined up with manderly and flint later on but he probably didnt have 20000 men in the books still it does seem like bolton got the majority of his men after all that does make me wonder though40005000 men throwing out that number pre mallister is not an insignificant number i know tywins cocky but if the northmen thought they had a reasonable chance to win the battle without most of their horse what made tywin so sure he would win hes good and robb is green but making a huge assumption like that seems out of character for tywin to me hes cocky but hes not stupid still robb does seem to get the best of him in the field at other points tywins reputation might be greatly exaggeratedare we actually aware of any time where he led men into battle he didnt participate in roberts rebellion til it was essentially over i dont believe we ever heard about him involving himself in balons rebellion and thats really the only fighting we know of in those years maybe pre roberts rebellion i know about castamere and all that but we dont know if that was even a battle"

"Maester Yobjascz",2011-06-13,"i didnt expect them to show whispering wood so not much disappointment there however i thought that this fell far short of the mark in informing viewers as to whats just happened we see jaime getting dragged from a forest apparently he cut down a few men before being taken we never see him with an army we never see riverun and so a nonreader would be oblivious to the fact that a significant siege has just been lifted theres about 20 or 30 people gathered around robb as he makes a speech so it looked like a skirmish had just happened not a major battle viewers wouldnt know that a major lannister host has been defeatedyoure confusing the battle of the whispering wood with the battle of the camps which we hear about but dont see in the books the whispering wood was a smallish battle between robb starks entire force and a small detachment led by jaime lannister that was looking for the lannisters disappearing scouts the siege of riverrun isnt lifted until the battle of the camps where robb stark defeats the three separated lannister camps laying siegei thought the episode was pretty spot on perfect i did miss bronns line about tyrion giving the northern archers fits a small man in the van with a large shield and im not certain how theyre going to resolve the absence of roose bolton with the remnants of his army keeping tywin penned in at harrenhall i suppose that hes not all that necessary until next season with arya but i dont think it wouldve been too hard to have included him as a faceless name in dialogue this season as they have for stannis though they wouldve had to start in ep 8"
"Social Justice Bass",2011-06-13,"i just finished watching it on hbo gowow i dont know if id say that was my favorite episode ever but it probably packed the most emotional punch most of the daenerys stuff played out pretty well and the camp spell scene was creepy i do think they rushed the pregnancy a bit it probably would have been better to have her more pregnant in the last episode but it was still good all the tywin and tyrion scenes continue to capture the sense of how much tywin dominates his children weve seen jaime somewhat submissive in his presence and even tyrion cowers a bit in spite of his banter im pretty sure i heard the wilhelm scream during the aftermath of tyrions battle when dying men were being finished off i agree that ned was amazing in his few scenes both his interactions with varys and his final minutes were great i was a little disappointed that we didnt see any of either the battle tyrion was in which was in the books or the battle in which jaime lannister was captured which was offscreen even in the books but i understand why they couldnt do it big battles are expensive  far too expensive for a television show to do for more than brief shots as mentioned upthread rome did it once jons sequence was probably the weakest in the episode he was okay but maester aemon was great i was moved when he edged into anger and sorrow while discussing how his relatives were butchered frey was great hes not how i pictured him frey in the books is a 91yearold man but he did convey that prickly brooding over all his slights attitude that was characteristic of walder frey in the books i didnt particularly like how they introduced shae i think the whole scene would have been better if they had included a brief bit before tyrion walked into tywins tent where he tells bronn to find him a whore and to tell her what i am that and tyrions thought about how his previous serving man had neglected to do that on occasion was a memorable little detail to me from that chapter that said they did get two important things about tyrion across the first was the rather fuckedup story involving his exwife the second was the fantasy girlfriend thing he has going on with shae which i really noticed on my reread of the books im honestly divided on the whole lets find out about each other drinking game i liked that it showed shae keeping tyrion at a degree of arms length and how it showed tyrion trying to build up this sort of camraderie that he desperately desires but ultimately bronn is just his mercenary and shae his whore the ending    what a gutpunch and cliffhanger holy shit easily the best scene in that episode and one of the best from the series i particularly liked how they conveyed how much joffreys rash decision was a cat among the pigeons type of fiasco for everyone else sansa was bawling cersei pleading to get him to change his mind varys running over to try and convince him    and meanwhile the execution goes forward and ned dies edited by wise bass 13 june 2011  0104 am"

"Lady Blackfish",2011-06-13,"i think i was more disappointed in this episode than most people though i still like it overall my issue was how the different scenesstorylines were meted out over the episode i think i feel like the breakdown of the episode couldve been tweaked to build up better to the drama it ended up being quite a comedown off of the high from episode eight until the very end where it seemed to spike out of well not quite nowhere but a bit too much in that direction imo in a way i too was disappointed by how the battles were depicted not because i need to see all the action but because tension was not maintained enough for my liking there mightve been a way to do that without showing the battles for example if we had seen cat earlier in the episode straining to see the action just waiting for robb and cutting away with her not knowing it mightve had more impact to see her returning to the screen still waiting and then robb rides out and finally she can breathe again etc i dunno basically i liked the parts of this episode but i do wish they had been assembled a little differently neds death was all in all very well done aemons reveal also pretty good the lannister and stark war camps each rewarding and while i have to think more before i know how i feel about shae for now im intrigued at how hbos take on the character will influence tyrions arc im really looking forward to the finale especially when cat punches the living crap out of jaime fans self edited by lady blackfish 13 june 2011  0151 am"

"Social Justice Bass",2011-06-13,"1 i think the whole mmd scene in the tent with the spell was actually better than the books description youre watching it and suddenly wtf what are those sounds2 to be honest im liking the whole scene with the westerosi version of i never more and more mostly because of how it portrays tyrion and shae although we do find out that bronn has been north of the wall meaning that he was probably a wildling or successful deserter from the nights watch shae keeps tyrion at a certain degree of arms length and we get to see tyrions creeping delusions in action you can just tell that he really really wants it to be real  for them all to be buddies joking around camraderie etc but it isnt and we see it in bronn and shaes discomfort with the whole thing theyre not his friends  theyre his employees and as soon as his gold runs out so will they  assuming that he didnt just lie  speaking of which i reiterate that the show captured what tyrion wanted from shae he didnt just want sex he wanted a fantasy girlfriend and his inability to tell fantasy from truth in that regard becomes rather sad as the story develops edited by wise bass 13 june 2011  0158 am"

"MountainThatRides",2011-06-13,"with the exception of the blackwater most of the battles in the series would be a waste of resources the story can be told just as efficiently without paying a few hundred extras to have at each other for a couple of minutes despite the fact that battles are totally coolof course youre correct in that showing every battle in full detail would be a waste i can understand why they are forced to make decisions on what to spend their money on but this book series is about a war or multiple wars its a medieval story about a dynastic power struggle with many competing factions intrigues and betrayals  theres politics and theres character development yes but the violence is also crucial in this case its not violence for the sake of violence as we are delivered regularly in most hollywood productions but the sort of conflict that services the plot regardless the way they handled the battles in baelor is probably the best approach when shooting the battle itself is monetarily unfeasiblethe green fork was important because it showcased the tactical abilities on both sides robbs strategic choice in splitting his forces and in giving roose command of the infantry rooses shrewd command that saved his host from annihilation tywins consummate skill in achieving victory against the northern army bolton had a chance at winning but tywin smashed him and made it look so casual  the sort of attitude reminiscent of edward longshanks at falkirk in braveheart beyond this theres also the intimate perspective of tyrion trapped in the chaos of battle despite being a rather lackluster warrior and managing not only to survive but to distinguish himself through cleverness and a bit of dumb luck so even this minor battle has import not that im saying they needed to depict it im just defending the complaintboth battles especially the whispering wood might have been doable if they focused on one single character or group of characters which is basically how it was written the green fork followed tyrion slogging it out in the mud and blood and the whispering wood was barely visible anyway neither battle required huge sweeping lotrstyle shots to make them work a lot of people attacked hbos rome for its battles but i thought they were very welldone for television rome had an astronomical budget but it was mostly spent on the filming itself due to the high cost of shooting in italy the first episodes battle against the gauls was intimate following pullo and vorenus and though it felt real and impressive it wasnt grandiose in any way my consolation is that there are much more important battles  like the blackwater which they have to at least show part of davos and wildfire and tyrion leading his sortie perhaps even tywin and renly coming up to take stannis in the rear its not going to be like helms deep and perhaps thats a good thing but im sure theyll do a good job plus this series is rife with more manageable conflicts plenty of great duels and smallerscale fights the hound at the inn the brotherhood without banners etc which serve to show the violence of this world as well as a battle kudos on dan  dave for their choices though i thought they handled the omissions in the best possible way edited by mountainthatrides 13 june 2011  0909 am"
"JagfyrBlackfyre",2011-06-13,"edit oh also bothering the bit about mirri and the baby she watches danys belly in a pretty obvious way but then the fact that dany comes to the tent seems completely random i mean going in that tent with those screams instead of forcing the usual dothraki women to deliver the baby that seemed wrongthe way the tv version presented it yeah that tent would be the least logical place to go jorah would be better off playing midwife himself than heading into that creepshow however in the book only dany seems to be able to tell that there is something overtly supernatural going on inside the dothraki just hear some foreign singing and chanting from a despicable maegi it peeves them but doesnt freak them out dany however is very freaked out and she tries in vain to plead not to carry her inside overall it seems that the oddity in this scene comes from the difficulty of not being able to easily convey on screen that only dany sees and hears weird stuff from the tent to continue the story she has to go in and be affected by whats inside so the tv version could not fore go this nor could they make it feasible that no one else heard the unnatural sounds without some weird and pace killing cuts and pov shots"
"GoTreviews",2011-06-13,"i dont think it was easy to do in any sort of way but really as it shown the tent screams do not enter on another subject any one has any clue of neds last words before he got iced "
"Kalbear",2011-06-13,"i was fine with the green fork i really really wish they had imparted how important and how huge a victory the whispering wood was i was even okay with them not showing anything  though if there was a battle in the books they could have done for cheap this was it  but i got the feeling that okay robb won woohoo but that was it we didnt get the notion that robb annihilated that host at almost no cost to himself hopefully next ep otherwise really stellar ep liked this version of shae as well i dont think that i would want to watch a roslike whore for a ton of eps next season but this one i would i liked the drinking game and i really liked bronn in it"
"King Stannis I",2011-06-13,"the series has been very good but somethings irk me 1 no tower of joy dream sequence and no last thoughts from ned about jon 2 sexposition scenes  kind of weird that all of the stuff that viewers might think of as boring exposition has been filled in with gratuitous sex to make it interesting littlefingers scene was the worst of the bunch 3 aryas first kill 4 tyrion knocked out before the battle 5 tyrion not having the last go at tysha in his story 1 though i think is thing i missed the most it is such a great scene in the book edited by king stannis i 13 june 2011  0923 am"
"Manderly`s Personal Chef",2011-06-13,"i didnt mind tyrion being knocked out before the battle even started to tell the truth i think they managed to do the battles the best possible way without showing them the last scene was heartbreaking the way sean bean has played there is justwow oh and walder frey thumbsupgif classbbcemoticon altthumbsup "
"JagfyrBlackfyre",2011-06-13,"its a medieval story about a dynastic power struggle with many competing factions intrigues and betrayals  theres politics and theres character development yes but the violence is also crucial in this case its not violence for the sake of violence as we are delivered regularly in most hollywood productions but the sort of conflict that services the plot regardless the way they handled the battles in baelor is probably the best approach when shooting the battle itself is monetarily unfeasibleboth battles especially the whispering wood might have been doable if they focused on one single character or group of characters which is basically how it was written nicely put mountain i agree with you wholeheartedly on you with this i think it is safe to assume that money was the deciding factor in the battleshooting decisions either there wasnt enough money to make it as awesome as the producers wanted or time and hence money was a deciding factor they really should have depicted more though who knows maybe we will get a flashback to the battles in the next episode the whispering wood battle was told in a 3rd person recollection via catelyn who did not experience the battle firsthand i fear we have lost any showing tyrions fighting prowess and the character is seeming more docile than in the book recall the mountain clan fight on the way to the eyrie and how tyrion laid in to a few enemies with that battle axe in the books whereas he only killed one guy haphazardly with a shield on tv his fighting style in the books is underhanded and not enough to stand up to any common knight one on one but it shows his ability to make great use of the situation the helm spike through the horse for instance is almost hilarious but nonetheless effective i wish we would have seen some of that most importantly we didnt see the development that tyrion has through this battle he certainly seems to grow bolder after this battle in the books largely because tywin is impressed by his units success and not just his survival it sets him up for the moves he will be making in kings landing i wonder if the tyrion that shows up in kings landing on tv will be slightly less inclined to instantly depose of slynt food poison his sis to get her out of the way or lead a deft sortie in a seemingly losing battle"
"Caine",2011-06-13,"i found this the secondworst episode of the season so far cripples bastards and broken things being the worst i really thought they nailed the ending i teared up a bit at the end even though i knew what was coming and thats something that never happened to me while reading the books i think neds confession coupled with aryas reaction she just closes her eyes really was shot magnificently for maximum shock and sadness value put me down as one who was disappointed we didnt see any of the battle at whispering wood too many times grrm has the thrust of major events occurring offscreen later were privy to characters reactions and then descriptions of the event i really wished the tv series would change this one thing about grrms writing i so badly wanted to see that battle the siege of riverrun jaime falling into robbs trap jaime cutting down 10 men and many karstarks etc anything the infodump scene with tyrion bronn and shae seemed out of place it was boring and killed any pacing the series seemed to have built my wife noted she didnt remember this scene and if the tysha backstory is all that important right now i didnt think so anyway more infodump scenes up at the wall too where nothing much happened either i did like the scene was walder frey but for some reason i imagined him smaller and more senile than we see on screen i also imagined walder freys court a lot bigger reading this scene in the book for the first time i distinctly remember laughing not so in the tv series"

"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-13,"i was talking about the perspective of the northerners not tywin i believe they were under the impression that it was feasible to defeat tywins army but they clearly would not have thought that if they had only 2000 men also i just remembered the specifics and robb took all his cavalry across the twins to the whispering wood and gave roose bolton his infantry for the battle of the green fork this means that roose bolton actually would have had more soldiers total but no cavalry for the battle of the green fork meaning he did have a shot at defeating the lannister army so yeah im really questioning the decision for them to give the green fork army only 2000 men i think this is a severe inconsistency with robbs character both in the show and in the bookrobb didnt really want for bolton to atack tywin when robb and cat are discussing who should command the infantry robbs first idea is to choose the greatjon but cat reminds him that greatjon would probabily head right on and atack tywin unnecessarily that is why they choose bolton because he would be able to follow the plannow that may be exactly what bolton did he did lose against tywin but his army remained mostly intact unlike jaimes which was almost completely routed i think bolton managed to fight tywin briefily and then retreated in an ordely fashionits very important that besides the few archers at the neck boltons army was about everything that kept people from invading the north that is why it was so important the army didnt die also its weird to think robb would be able to acomplish that with only 2000 soldiersthe problem is that in the show they gave jaime 30000 soldiers i doubt robb would be able to destroy that with only his horse  frey reinforcements"

"MrDoog",2011-06-13,"i see a lot of comments saying that the battle scenes werent essential and id partially agree but just a few points  the whole season thusfar has been a steady build up to this war the anticipation has been built up beautifully all season key figures captured armies mobilised and marching all leading up to drinking games imo showing at least parts of a battle scene would be a good way of relieving a situation thats boiled up like a pressure cooker for 8 previous episodes  developing the characters  plot is more important okay fair enough but its important in the books we see that tyrion fights bravely albeit reluctantly the way he was portrayed last night made him look more like moon boy getting trampelled by the men who he pays was getting knocked out by his own man supposed to be funny  the battle of whispering wood was poorly done imo not that they didnt show fighting but that they didnt convey what a great victory robb has just won this battle is frequently alluded to in the series as one of robbs most successful moments but when nonreaders look back on it theyll probably just think of jaime getting dragged from a forest and about 20 or 30 northmen cheering to those saying well so long as they do the blackwater right or well grrm is writing the blackwater so this wont happen again im not sure what you mean spoiler if budget constraints mean they cant hire 60 or 70 extras to yell and wave swords for 2 or 3 minutes then how are they going to show hundreds or even a dozen galleys and ships getting burned smashed and sunk how are they going to show a battle with tens of thousands on either side with massive trebuchets and a burning bloody river on another subject it seems like the direwolves are practically getting written out of this series im sure its very difficult to film with the animals and im not expecting to see them ripping throats every episode but i thought grey wind could at least be in view while robbs in shot even if hes just sitting there just so viewers are reminded of them since they do play a major role"

"Ser Greguh",2011-06-13,"for me its more about chemistry than getting every last detail exactly like the book the actress could fail to look and behave as id envisioned book shae yet have such instant chemistry with and allure for tyrion that it wiped away all the differences for example when i first saw the casting for lysa i thought oh thats not right but she captured the essence of a fairly minor character while looking quite different from the book description imo for shae to work we need to be able to be able to deceive ourselves with tyrion it would be theoretically possible to do this with a shae who acted more courtesan and less naive camp follower although it still wouldnt be a change id welcome but what im not feeling here is any chemistry  any reason for tyrion to put aside his distrust and get so totally caught up in his selfdeception after all hes had many other whores alluded to both in the show and the books i dont feel like hes captivated by her presence charmed by her seeing in her the memory of being in love i dont feel like shes drawing him in pretending to be pleased by him offering him an escape and if i the viewer dont feel it why should i believe that tyrion doesread the first encounter between the two in the first book again i dont have the books with me at the moment on a business trip but isnt the first thing she says to him along the lines of my mother named me shae men call me  often shes totally playing the exotic role we see in the series truth be told its not until after shes been with him the once and is able to detect his vulnerability that she goes full innocent on him probably calculating that that was the best way to manipulate him so i think itll be interesting to see where dd go with this and see if they dont transition her from the exotic courtesan that shes projecting in their initial meeting to the more scared and innocent girl that craves tyrions protection and care more than anything in the books she is depicted as someone who adjusts the personality she projects based on what she believes tyrion wants to hear and does it very convincingly just because she hasnt done that in the what five minutes weve seen with her doesnt mean all hope is lost that the character develops into someone that fits into your mold of someone that tyrion could conceivably drop his guard aroundfor the time being her impertinence represents enough of a challenge to tyrion that i have no trouble buying into his continued interest in her his falling in love with her takes considerably more time"
"apt54",2011-06-13,"long time lurker first time poster i joined specifically to post my displeasure with this episode 110 im never watching this show again they butcher two important and relatively small scale battles compared to the future battles in the series if theyre gonna do this to small scale battles then i might as well quit watching right now because i dont want to watch a terrible blackwater episode i might as well not set myself up for disapointment i didnt even get to enjoy neds death because i was fuming about that the fact that i got screwed out of two major battles i cant believe they pulled a rome on me this is even worse then when they had a seven episode buildup of a fight between pompey and caesar and then just show the aftermath you just lost yourself a viewer hbo edit thanks for the useless time wasting tyrion guess what sceneyes i can see how entire hbo is panicking and calling their banne erm emergency meetings over losing one viewersulking over a tv show grow up kidtotally agree with you mate i didnt expect them to show whispering wood thought they might show jaime cutting down a few northmen just to give him some airtime but the way they completely distorted the other battle was just awful it made tyrion look like an incompetent oaf deprived of us a pretty exciting scene which i enjoyed in the books and like you said this battle was small potatoes compared to whats ahead maybe budgetary constraints well if theyd just followed tyrions contribution to the battle for a couple minutes showing the tribemen fighting it wouldnt have been that costly also if i hadnt read the series id have no idea what the significance of those two battles was the friend i was watching with was clueless that riveruns siege had just been lifted not to mention the predicament now facing tywins half of the lannister army which is effectively cutoff imo this particular episode simply didnt do the book any justicejust to add not only did my mate who hasnt read the series not know riveruns siege had just been lifted he didnt know it was besieged in the first place but at least he knows that bronns dad beat him and that shae doesnt like it when tyrion talks about her parentsif you had not been a reader you would not understand the significance of 18000 men annihilating 30000 wow dude youre awesomeand tywins predicament is to be discussed later unless your are a maniacal stalker type of a fan as the fellow i quoted above you wouldnt care for such minor details"

"RDKfromwesteros",2011-06-13,"does anyone beside me is curious about eddards last words i mean he clearly says something he mighty be just praying but couldnt it be something important after all as far as i know the creators of the show have an idea of how all is going to end right so anyone else is curious couldnt it be some speel varys thot him to live been one with the force and show up again in the last three book as some seethrough soul that ok now i am kind of crazy but you guys know what i mean xd"
"Ser Greguh",2011-06-13,"you can call it what you want but the fact is that this shae is not grrms shae and the fact that a lot of people on here do not like the change is expected i dont think it helped that they changed everything about her shae is a fairly important character to tyrions character development in the next couple books so i guess to me i think its important that they portray shae like she was in the books so yeah i hope they axe the actressand like i said this is nothing but pedantic purism its not exactly 100 like the books therefore it sucks its a tiresome and boring standpoint to argue from the point of an adaptation is to rework a piece of art into a different format while conforming to the logistical differences between the two mediums not to attempt to copy everything 100 and hope that it translates perfectly its not a bible"
"laughing tree knight",2011-06-13,"i dont feel cheated not seeing the fight in the whispering wood it would have been awesome but for two things 1 theyve already shown us how they are shying away from horse ridden battles the change to neds fight vs kingslayer and 2 with the absence of the karstarks it would have been impossible to add those elements back into play in season 2 if the scene was shot  in the book its told from cats pov and shes not there but for the blackwater it better be in detail its told from multiple pov and takes up three or four chapters davos tyrion sansa so it has to be done right edited by laughing tree knight 13 june 2011  0246 pm"
"FlipFantastic",2011-06-13,"im not upset about getting screwed out of two battles because i couldnt care less about the effects and whatever gore so many people crave this series is doing things like showtimes the tutors and playng the political maneuvering instead of battles which is more interesting i think but what i am disappointed in is that they did a poor job explaining to the crowd robs tactics i think the viewers needed another recap that jaime has half the lannister army outside of riverrun that the twins were the key to getting there and that the 2000 man fight was a feign i really expected another table top map scene where rob shows his cunning sometimes you do have to be blunt in tv shows however over bluntness like the stay low comment was stupid maybe its just my tastes but shae is smoking hot way hotter than the red haired floppy booby one and maybe rivals danys handmaid something about the dark features accent and eyes wow i like her character in the show and tyrion respects her for her boldness and the fact that right away she knew tysha was a whore explaining that no girl would have sex a few hours after almost being raped"

"Morrigan",2011-06-08,"lords glover and umber are the only nonstark nothern lords cast this season technically glover isnt a lord in the book hes master of deepwood motte but he seems to be a lord in the show and lords bracken and frey are the only riverlands lords as far as i know edited for spellingwhy would they cast lord glover but not lord karstark i dont recall lord glover having any significant lines or plot whereas lord karkstark shows how unhappy he is to having lost both sons to jaime during the battle of the whispering woods and this becomes crucial in book 3 perhaps they merged lord glover and lord karkstark somehow so long as they dont merge him with the greatjon who is fiercely loyal til the end at least"
"richtea78",2011-06-08,"robb said he sent 2000 men to die could that be the diversion against tywins army without a named general it would mean not casting the extra lords yet cant really see it as in keeping with character though killing 2000 of your men is pretty callous"
"Asha<U+0097>Not Yara!",2011-06-08,"isnt that what happened in the book he had bolton lead the men to divert tywins attention away from the main attack on jaime and many of the men he sent died as i recall but some were captured or managed to escape like bolton did"
"The Anti-Targ",2011-06-08,"why would they cast lord glover but not lord karstarkbecause they can cast some low cost noname actor to be glover but they might want to cast a recognisable and hence more costly face for karstark probably as much an economic decision as a creative oneits the not casting of bolten thats the oddest choice given hes given the command of the diversionary force still i hope robb and cat have that conversation about his plan where cat subtley steers robb away from umber and towards bolten for the command and robb notes how bolten scares the bejeebers out of him no need to show him though perhaps he can be shown from the back or something so roose bolten could be a mere nonname extra in season 1 at least show us the flayed man sigil to tell the audience why robb would feel a bit hinky about roosejust noticed that cat will be having the conflab with lord frey i hope we get nearly all of that conversation from the book though they can ditch some of his belly aching about his spawn"
"malarky1231",2011-06-08,"im disappointed roose bolton wasnt cast for the first season he was such an interesting character in the books although if i remember it correctly the only significant scene in the first book was at the war conference where everyone shuts up in order to hear what bolton is saying every other time we hear the name bolton is from someone else it would also make more sense if some scenes we believe are going appear in baelor but not confirmed to be put into episode 10"
"John (Snow) Doe",2011-06-09,"if not casting bolton for s1 means that they get a better actor to play him in s2 and onwards im all for it losing bean and mark addy should free up a lot of budget space jason momoa and harry lloyd leaving also provides some supplementary "

"persephone88",2011-06-12,"i am wondering if they will give the karstark role to glover or someone else in the series if the producers thought having a robert arryn as being too confusing to viewers and so changing robert to robin will they think karstark is just too similar to stark and might they not give karstarks role to another house just to avoid the name confusion we havent heard karstark mentioned yet but glover was cast and also named by the greatjon when there was the argument about who leads the van karstark is an important part because he loses two sons protecting robb then robb has to behead him later on so were assuming we will see two sons get cut down trying to reach robb i could see them giving that role to glover but id almost not be surprised if they made it the greatjon who lost sons because the viewers have already met him and the reaction would be visceral but hes too important to end up beheaded will be interesting to see if and how they work in which lords  sons are involved in protecting robb from jaime tonight"
