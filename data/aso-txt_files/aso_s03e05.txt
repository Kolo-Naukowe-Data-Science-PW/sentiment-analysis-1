"Stallion That Mounts Texas",2013-04-28,"so many changes to the story but i gave it a solid 9 1 the fight bt the hound and berric was excellent 2 i love rose lesley 3 nice twist with lf giving loras a boy to get info could have done wo the sex but it is hbo 4 the scene with tywin tyrion and cersei is classic"
"scurvy",2013-04-28,"theyve made arya a little soft and maise had a little trouble with the material beric was awesome jaime and brienne was great i even liked selyse but wheres the stache and that patchface song at the end sung by shereen was erie"
"pntrlqst",2013-04-28,"first ten of the season didnt have a huge dracarys like moment but it flowed great and scenes just feel so much stronger when they are verbatim from the book the jonygritte scene was good although i feel it would have been much stronger if theyd spent more time on them in the first four episodes and to be honest i wasnt totally absorbed by the kingslayers acting nor the directing in the bath scene"
"towerofjoy",2013-04-28,"interesting changes but more nuances than substantive the cerseiloras thing cracked me up i can see loras running to be in the kingsguard now edited by towerofjoy 28 april 2013  0905 pm"
"Arrow",2013-04-28,"cersei got gobstopped at the end didnt she i feel sorry for her in a way shes trapped in a womans body but has a mans sense of independence thirst for power and need for selfdetermination"
"Trebla",2013-04-28,"i was going to give it a 7 but tywins takedown of his children pushed it to an 8 that scene was fantastic"
"Ran",2013-04-28,"and now his watch is ended had a really terrific finale and the old bears death but if you look at what came before closely it wasnt that far above an average episode it was elevated by the finish this episode is good through and through except for the character assassination of loras tyrell grr and in my opinion its the best episode of the season to date so ive given it a 9 edited by ran 28 april 2013  0906 pm"
"scurvy",2013-04-28,"also that duel bw beric and sandor was unreal made all other duels a joke so far"
"Warhawk137",2013-04-28,"my first 10 of the season too acting tour de force this one maybe the overall darkest episode yet at least in terms of tone pacing and occasional existential terror"
"alwayswinter",2013-04-28,"theyve made arya a little soft and maise had a little trouble with the material beric was awesome jaime and brienne was great i even liked selyse but wheres the stache and that patchface song at the end sung by shereen was eriei thought maisie was brilliant in the scene with beric  thorosand yeah shireen singing over the credits was very creepy loved it"
"Blind Beth the Cat Lady",2013-04-28,"so good just so so good i almost cried twice ive been drinking but still also props for having that whole bath scene almost no actual nudity gave it a lot of gravitas arya  co danny  grey worm and jonygritte blew it out of the water"
"TheHedgeWizard",2013-04-28,"best episode of the season in my opinion cogman delivers i loved everything except the the stannisselyse scene that was weird and extremely creepy i think it is obvious now that tv stannis is different from book stannis the jamiebrienne bath scene was great superb acting"
"Javi Marcos",2013-04-28,"i loved the davos and shireen scenes bathtub scene was memorable but im looking forward to watch it again i could get all the dialogue lords kiss and hound vs beric were great too and the cerseiloras marriage was very surprising to me i like that book readers like us still get surprises"
"axels15",2013-04-28,"i disagree about the arya scenes making her look weak i thought she was fantastic in this episode the scenes with jaime were simply outstanding and i really enjoyed the opening scene and the one with jon and ygritte solid episode"
"King Kev.",2013-04-28,"great episode since episode 3 the show has really hit its stride lots of great scenes in this one the hounds fight was excellent and pretty much everything to do with the brotherhood was awesome speaking of which maisie williams was fanfuckingtastic this episode all her scenes were great especially the one with thoros and beric around the fire jon and ygrittes scene was sexy as fuuuu then you had robb and co having some serious shit going down karstarks execution was a great scene filmed and acted now the bath scene fucking amazing ncw and gwendoline christie owned that scene especially ncw great closing scene as well solid 9"
"Darth Pipes",2013-04-28,"10 wowi think i liked this episode even more than last week seriously i have almost no complaints even robbs storyline was all kinds of awesome and comes off like it was in the book im glad they kept in the hang him last so he can watch the others line loved blackfish punching karstark too nice to see some of cats political iniative and try to talk robb into keeping karstark as a hostage jaimebrienne was fantastic and ncw was riveting relating the story good touch with brienne yelling out kingslayer we get to see a little of creepy roose bolton and creepier qyburn the battle between the hound and beric was fantastic i liked arya attempting to go after houndthats the pyscho arya we know and love liked sandors line about the god liking him more than the butchers boy loved the scene with gendry it might have been more background stuff but i liked the converstaion with jorah and barristan a lot wowi can see why stannis doesnt go near his wife the fetus thing really freaked me out shireen was great and that kids singing voice is terrific typical stannissay the absolute wrong thing to your daughter because youre too damn honest i liked the davosshireen stuff and her being the one to teach him how to read the only thing i didnt like was ser loras shacking up with another guy i have no problem with that kind of stuff at all my only problem is that its out of character for loras to want to be with anyone else other than renly thats how strong is love was for him enjoyed the olennatyrion scene but that final scene between him tywin and cersei was fantastic especially him bringing up his previous marriage edited by darth pipes 28 april 2013  0911 pm"
"scurvy",2013-04-28,"did anyone transcribe the lyrics to shireens patchface song any mention of fools blood kings blood blood on a maidens thigh"
"Stallion That Mounts Texas",2013-04-28,"and now his watch is ended had a really terrific finale and the old bears death but if you look at what came before closely it wasnt that far above an average episode it was elevated by the finish this episode is good through and through except for the character assassination of loras tyrell grr and in my opinion its the best episode of the season to date so ive given it a 9i agree loras would never betray renlys memory is such a way"
"Fez",2013-04-28,"8 i guess it had a lot of really good scenes but they felt rather disjointed moreso than usual two larger complaints would be that 1 i didnt think the jonygritte cave scene was earned having the scene was fine but the whole bit about staying there forever just felt wildly out of place since unlike the books there wasnt already a developed relationship id have cut those couple lines and kept the rest which was otherwise a fine scene 2 i thought the final few scenes starting with loras sparring were really rushed i almost got whiplash how fast things were jumping around but otherwise it was a really good episode i give particularly props to the jamie monologue in the bath"
"JonCon's Red Beard",2013-04-28,"loved the episode except for ygrittejon scenes 8 just because i didnt like how they handle their relationship"
"Tom son of Tom",2013-04-28,"theyve made arya a little soft and maise had a little trouble with the material beric was awesome jaime and brienne was great i even liked selyse but wheres the stache and that patchface song at the end sung by shereen was erietotally disagree the kid has nailed it so far great acting imo"
"Zman1863",2013-04-28,"another very strong episode the jaime scene in the bath was probably the best scene i liked how they framed the machinations that go into the plots regarding sansa i liked the stannis storyline i thought it was interesting to see him in a more human context wasnt thrilled about the weird babies in brine thing though i wasnt really thrilled with how the jonygritte thing was framed berics resurrection drew an eye roll from my non book reader sister although that was sort of my reaction when i read that development in the books too"
"sati",2013-04-28,"easily my favorite episode so far along with blackwater nikolaj coster waldau and maisie williams made me cry robbs scenes were awesome selyse and shireen were great and that ending with tyrion being so outraged he couldnt even laugh at cersei was perfect"
"Er Rn",2013-04-28,"910 best episode of this season so far"
"Yago",2013-04-28,"better than last weeks in my opinion"
"Blaer Dayle",2013-04-28,"sandorberic was great loved rory acting based on the fire aryas realisation that she will be alone without gendry was quite sad beric was charismatic as he should be olenna was great as usual the bathhouse was good but jaimes speech wasnt as powerful as i imagined it would be however his asking to be called jaime is great and an indication that his character is evolving into less of a villain glad to see they are showing that robb is slowly letting his army fall apart while holding hope that theyll support him regardless nice touch with the music during karstarks execution to parallell with theons greatest mistake when he beheaded cassel jon and ygritte was good but it had no buildup and felt tacked in for the sake of consistency with the books nice to see grey worm for the first time barristan and jorah was great i love when the characters discuss the past and their mistakes shireen was great i love the makeup selyse was okay as well so shireen will now take on the role of davos teacher then thats fine with me it was interesting to finally see a more human side of stannis i guess patchface has been cut thats too bad could have done without the sex scene with loras but littlefinger again being the master manipulator love it poor sansa just a pawn in everyone elses game the closing credits were nice and creepy but the gem of the episode was tywins scene with his kids tywin is the true leader of the realm and he knows it 910 for me pretty good but not flawless edited by blair dale 28 april 2013  0924 pm"
"Randyll Tarly",2013-04-28,"gave a ten since cerseis face when tywin addressed her on the same issue as tyrion was worth the 10 on its own beric vs hound duel was unique and made even the blackwater battle scene look like a rock scissors and paper game jon first encounter felt like he was a pro and the kingslayer confession to brienne was truly a very emotional one thus earning a ten imo"
"Aegnor",2013-04-28,"theyve made arya a little soft and maise had a little trouble with the material i disagree completely that line about bringing someone back whod had their head cut off was even more heartbreaking than in the books as was the line about gendry being her family"
"Ran",2013-04-28,"the line about bringing back someone from the dead was basically exactly as what was in the books its nice to see it rendered by actors but in this bryan was wisely just following georges roadmap"
"Jabronius Maximus",2013-04-28,"gave it a 9 good stuff like ran said it was more consistently good than last week but still didnt have the climactic events that last week had and when the hell will we hear a good ole har from tormund like seriously man come on dude looks mad af other than that i have no problem with where the show runners are taking this the changes really make sense"

"MyLittleDirewolf",2013-04-28,"that was fucking awesome my only quibble was loras bedding the squire so quickly he was still in love with renly other than that everything was great shireen is adorable beric and sandor fight was as awesome as it was in the books davosshireen almost made me cry that was a great episode love you bryan cogman"
"cybobbie",2013-04-28,"loved the episode great surprises in it specially jaime and brienne scene and his monologue about the mad king they are so brilliant in their roles that i cant get enough of them another surprise was the way that they handle the tyrell plot discovery a good way imo didnt expect the talk between ser barrister and jorah too but again found it good to show why he doesnt know that jorah was sending info on dany to robert one cute and touching surprise was shireen and davos scene as for the parts that i was expecting i mean from the preview i loved the hound and berics fight the best so far in the show i disagree with some posts here about arya i mean i think she was very good in this episode and her talk with gendry was really touching finally cersey and tyrions face in the end of the episode priceless tywin is really daddy from hell edited by cybobbie 28 april 2013  0926 pm"
"Aegnor",2013-04-28,"the line about bringing back someone from the dead was basically exactly as what was in the books its nice to see it rendered by actors but in this bryan was wisely just following georges roadmaptrue i just meant that maisie did a great job of bringing that moment outalso i dont know if its been mentioned above but i really loved the musical tieback between robb cutting off karstarks head and theon cutting off rodricks"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2013-04-28,"aryas scenes were great but they needed to be longer aryas story needs to be given some time to breathe i think her arc is the one most underserved this season"

"Hound Dog",2013-04-28,"great episode loved all of it my only minor moment of disappointment was that the hound didnt sob like a little baby at the end of the fight and instead seemed amused at aryas angry rage that was one moment in the books where i felt terribly sorry for him something like pity and im sorry it wasnt conveyed in the show but that was in the beginning the rest of the episode was so well done that i forgot about that until now"
"Nezzer",2013-04-28,"stannis is so adorable when hes playing daddy i wish he were my father tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  great episode with the best pacing since season 1 imho but it didnt have many climatic moments so i gave it an 8 pretty good for a midseason episode"
"WinterWarrior",2013-04-28,"i thought this was a great episode and gave it a 9 1 maise was wonderful as arya and we see the first romanticaffection struggle between gendry and aryawith her really not understanding her feelings and him having a better grip on the situation 2 selyse was creepy and those fetuses were disgusting but the whole thing effective i wonder why they are making stannis and his situation so bizarre stannis is very different in the hbo series 3 i loved shireen and her friendship with davos i wonder how davos is going to get in good standing with stannis again will the hob series have stannis coming to the aid of the north dont see how 4 bath scene was great i thought it was great when brienne stood up 5 last scene with tywin was amazing this episode followed story lines from the book better even though characters were changed loras instead of willis etc i will watch it again about 4 times this week as i seem to be doing each week"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2013-04-28,"superb episode not my favorite but i couldnt find any flaws so i gave it a 10  hound vs beric was absolutely epic best fight scene in the show thus far by a mile  crazy selyse scene was great loved seeing stannis express remorse for his infidelity with mel selyses deluded encouragement of it and stans incredulous reaction  general awkwardness around her very well done and the best stannis scene since he and davos on the ship in 208  shireens patchface song was a nice nod to bookreaders loved the scene with her and davos in the dungeon too  jaimebrienne was powerful and again wonderfully executed  speaking of executed the entire karstark subplot resolution was deftly handled although i thought it might have fit better as the end scene  tywintyrioncersei was just fucking brilliant this show is humming on all cylinders right now"
"Carey Snow",2013-04-28,"i agree loras would never betray renlys memory is such a wayi am sure that loras still had needs after renlys passing that does not mean he falls in love with everybody he has sex with"

"Lord Godric",2013-04-28,"i think i need to rewatch this one it had many great scenes particularly the jaimebrienne scene but i was distracted most of the time so i didnt think too much of it gave it an 8 but that may change"
"Carey Snow",2013-04-28,"probably the same as us oh thats so cruel but actually maybe its no so bad given the other alternatives lolplus tyrion is much more handsome on the show rather than in the books i think the uproar will be more about sansas age even though that was how things were done in the dark ages"

"Corvinus",2013-04-28,"ten despite the diminishing of lorass character and the dead babies that was a wtf moment pleasantly surprised at seeing yunkai on the map as well as grey worm the fight between the hound and beric was excellent but the highlight was jaimes story and how it ended my name is jaime edited by corvinus 28 april 2013  1111 pm"
"Pure Guava",2013-04-28,"it was a very solid 8 for me gave the book fans many of our favorite scenes cheers to the biggest bookfan on the set bryan cogman and while id love to get into everything i loved about this episode for instance the total dawwww moment i had when shireen is with davos but im too overwhelmed by the trailer for episode 6 seven hells does the next episode look intense i did a pretty severe macaulay culkin while watching it man this season is really starting to feel pretty damn good"

"Caryn Stark",2013-04-28,"i give it a 9 i loved every minute of it up to loras and was clapping as they pulled so much information straight from the novels best episode of the season by far for me i saw the loras plot coming as soon as the squire walked up to him and hated it they could just as easily had a servant be the mole no need to destroy loras like that"

"Cornishman",2013-04-29,"i would rate this episode 9 as well thats two great episodes in a row for season 3  i hope the coming episodes are as well done as the previous ones this year truly remarkable work this year its hard to believe that they are actually improving as much as they are given the limited time they have to punch out the nearly 11 hours of television they need to do gwendoline christie  what can i say i think they had a hard time casting a truly ugly women as grrm portrayed brienne of tarth in his novels and went with what they thought would suit things best  a tall girl with some acting chops who has a hard to define allure about her well shes surely put any critics to the sword with her work in this episode i thought she was spot on a praise worthy effort on her behalf for the nearly 6 minutes she was on camera in the bath scene gwendoline should be thanking the director and art department etc for portraying her in such an appealing fashion and giving her the chance to shine an opportunity she seized in my opinion she looked magnificent yet very vulnerable as well and has left me wondering what more she has in store for us with all the great material shell have to work with in the coming seasons"
"Ser Creighton",2013-04-29,"it was pretty good some great scenes with some not so great scenes i thought jamiebree was one of the best scenes of the year easily they did a nice job pulling that off tywincersietyrion was well done robbs scenes were good davosshireen was sweet and i thought the actor playing stannis was better this week although different his changes were not as extreme as his lst scene with mel beric and the hound that was well done grey worm and dany was well done a second good week emilia good work with her facial emotion the arya scene i everyone in those scenes was great except arya not that she was bad i just thought a couple of times well i was wondering where some of the cold anger was like the hit list it felt more distant and sad she felt distant and sad the hot pie scene was better than the gendry scene it felt a little desperate and reaching where is the dark side didnt think she was bad but just not as good as others in the scene gendry felt kind of emotionless and arya felt desperate just like the scene with the knife it was desperate the jon and ygritte scene felt forced and they felt detatched it was an okay looking scene but i dont feel anything between the two characters they dont really talk on the show not sense last year really this year jon has hardly said a word and what he has said has not really been directed at her the scenes beyond the wall feel detatched with very little character development its just like lets put in a few of the well known scenes from the book and not bother with the rest it feels flat and devoid of emotion babies in jars dont remember that from the books but it felt wierd and out of place looked like someting out of aliens loras is getting butchered i always thought he was loyal to renly even in death he seems rather unbothered and rather enjoying himself sort of missing the chip on his shoulder he had in the books i gave it a 78 it was good some really nice scenes but the scenes beyond the wall are ruining a lot of it for me they just have no real character development going on there really not sure how i feel about the episode liked some scenes a lot didnt like others thought the camera work and lighting was good intresting with all the heavy shading mixed with natural streaming light dark and hazy at times illuminating at others characters constantly going from dark to light like stannis thought some of the makeup work was really well done jamies eyes swollen and puffy very subtle about what he just went through but the greyscale i never really imagined it looking that plastic one thing did shock me bree kinda has a pretty nice little caboose going on i was kind of like hey your a girl which tells you how well the actress is doing at least in my eyes"

"Robin Of House Hill",2013-04-29,"910 better than i expected it to be i like the actor currently portraying beric dondarrion the duel was excellent but the scene with jaime and brienne in the bath was the best there was too much missing north of the wall but it was only a one hour episode"

"Lucifer Lightbringer",2013-04-29,"1010absolutely phenomenal and in my opinion the best episode of the show so far well written directed and acted in almost every scene i have become rather worried that they were starting to paint everything with very broad strokes and were going to make a lot of motivations and backstory unclear to the viewers but this season they are really pulling it all together as much as can be expectedthe only thing that didnt really click for me was selyses little foetus collection it almost made me laugh  what was that and of course they continue to condense and simplify story arcs such as moving jon and ygritte right along instead of giving them time together but they have to do that there are times when it catches them though in this episode they thought they were being clever when they showed mormonts anxiety about selmys knowledge of his agency for kings landing but of course if selmy isnt hiding his identity then theres no real reason he shouldnt take his complaints directly to danny a minor plot hole they created for themselveslike i said though this is overall the best episode so far if you ask me very strong direction lots of details from the books that provide necessary plot points and characterization and some very strong acting and pacing throughout they did a great job on this onehighs for meygritte and jon in the cave because ygrittebath scene very well acted and it reveals some crucial characterization for jaime and the development of his relationship with and respect for brienne that is the king of thing i feared they would brush over but here they gave it all the attention it deservedthe trial by combat of sandor absolutely stunning the other swordplay in the show pales in comparisonof course all of the ways they reconcile the show with the books im glad that tyrion mentioned his previous marriage and im glad that they are making the lightning lord true to his book version even if the priest isnt reallyi like that they introduced stannis daughter and i thought that it was a clever way to show how stannis might come to realize that davos is one of his greatest servants and friends definitely missing patchface though"
"Belisarius09",2013-04-29,"i thought episode 4 hit the target on the bullseye but episode 5 blew episode 4 out of the water loved the jaimebriene bath scene with jaime revealing his side of the story behind his finest act also the lannister family scene at the end was superbly well done tyrion and cersei throw their jabs but at the end of the day theres no doubt in anyones minds that tywinn is in charge great stuff"

"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-29,"im really torn about the rating on one hand it was a consistently great episode with some fantastic scenes jaime in the bath the brotherhood scenes dany and grey worm jorah and barristan tywin with cersei and tyrion olenna and tyrion and shireen and davos but there were some really stupid things that just pulled me out of the episode one major issue i have is with the handling of loras  just like renly hes now 100 defined by his sexuality and its also presented quite badly anyway i also have a major problem with the way tyrion is being whitewashed in the books he wasnt keen on marrying sansa but his greed and lust for power convinced him to do it in the show it appears that theyre trying to make it forced upon tyrion its just going to vilify sansa luckily dinklage headey and dance all gave perfect performances to make up for it there were also some major acting problems this episode though littlefinger was worse than usual and so was jon littlefinger at least is written terribly but theres no excuse for jon  the material he had this episode was great he really ruined jons scenes for me which is disappointing because his time with the wildlings was the only time i actually enjoyed his material but my major problem is with selyse the babies in jars was terrifying and incredibly triggering and reducing her to the mad woman in the attic trope is just insulting anyway ill probably rate it 8 or 910 because the issues i have are more to do with the show as a whole than the episode itself bryan cogman did a great job as per usual"

"insertname",2013-04-29,"a bit harshly i gave it a 7 while there was nothing really wrong with it and some scenes were great there were quite a few thing that didnt quite work for me either the good tywin vs his kids just guarantees to be a great scene the bath scene was great im okay with the way they depicted shireen the neutral i thought there was a bit much dumb banging on shields in the duel but then again its probably something youll have in a real fight too its nice to see littlefinger do some plotting but having someone seduce loras was pretty simple and apparently he had to be initiated by cersei first i had kinda hoped to hear the candleline or show his affection for renly in some other way bit sad they cut it out but understandable the bad ive never been too big a fan of the resurrection in the books and if that kind of story works well depends hugely on the cost beric had his line about losing himselfbut i didnt really buy it that this was so bad for him it didnt seem like it was this is more of a fault of the previous episodes but jonygritte didnt work for me at all the scene itself was fine though you know nothing jon sno  oh is a terribly cheesy line imho wish theyd have cut that but their relationship hasnt progressed to that point yet especially not for ygritte to say i want to stay in this cave forever stillborns in those cylindersthat was just weird and didnt really fit the rest was okay nothing bad but nothing really special either could be im forgetting about some things though edited by insertname 29 april 2013  0916 am"

"Tywin's bastard",2013-04-29,"great episode again the duel between the hound and beric is the best scripted fight in the show this far jaime and brienne keep having great chemistry in every single scene and it was great seeing their relationship grow even more shireen was really good and another positive surprise when it comes to child actors on this show i loved that she sang patchfaces song and it was really eerie also good to see selyse as well and they quickly established her as a religious fanatic i liked the touch of one of the unborn sons being named edric tywin keeps having incredible presence and his scene with tyrion and cersei was great there were many other nice things as well including a good deal of clever foreshadowing edited by tywins bastard 29 april 2013  0925 am"
"StannisandDaeny",2013-04-29,"i gave it a 9 hardly anything to dislike just allround excellentin general i liked how things slowed down a little to get some character development donethe duel between the hound and beric dondarrion show that scene to the guy who directed the jaime  brienne fight thats how you do a swordfight beric looked awesome elegant and badass like i imagined him the fire was a constant factor even maisie was present throughout it they were really evenlymatched it was easy to feel for the hound because he got burned yet again best fight in the show so farberic he will die but not today  this is the kind of cleverness from the books i also want to see in the show loved itthe lord of light isnt done with him yet  this is nice foreshadowing to the role we expect sandor clegane to take as a warrior of the faith against his undead brotherjon again had that wimpy look on his face that just makes me angry it got better though his aggression is kind of out of character because it was blatantly obvious he was lying to them and still loyal to the nwtormund sucks im sorry he just does how many cheesy lines can this sad brute produceygritte steals jons sword like its nothing come on guysat the moment jon and ygritte engage in sexy times i believe their relationship hasnt been developed well enough to really consider it something to be happy about the dialogue following it and the way the scene was handled fixed this for me though they actually looked like a loving pair and they know whats outside the cave will tear them apart which makes a very very nice metaphor for wanting to stay the innocence of a loving couple against the cruel reality of the worldrooses psychological torture of jaime was so incharacter and downright awesome the guy who is playing him is too locke has something bad coming for himim a huge fan of qyburn the character so i had my squee moment when he appeared too more more im happy with the way qyburn is portrayed  its like you cant decide whether hes fatherly or creepy it wouldve been nice if they couldve dropped a line about how he became rooses maester after theyd rescued him to avoid the bloodied up guy somehow being a medic without too much explanation it makes him look like a plot device but then again the foreshadowing of his creepy experiments and the crazy look in his eyes as hes cutting into jaimes flesh was a nice touchdid i mention jaimes wrist looked absolutely disgusting even by got standardsi dont mind loras looking like an idiot he killed 23 men fellow brothers in arms because he was angry renly got killed and never once showed remorse for them he is pretty much an idiot if anything it makes petyr who is far more important than loras look smarter which was kind of necessarythe queen of thorns discussing provisions was enjoyable this is after all an important factor to the story and grrm himself has said he thinks the logistics are all too often forgotten in fantasymaisies goodbye scene with gendry was a real tearjerker props to joe dempsie for making him into such a cool character he already kinda was but this gendry has a little more depth and actual thoughts about whats happening to him and where hes goingone thing ill remark is that karstark being caught immediately kinda takes away the tension and the shock the murdering of the lannister boys which really brutal very well portrayed ought to have on someone  you immediately see karstark is caught and justice will be donei dont think the blackfish would punch a helpless man but its only a detail still this coupled with his reaction to edmure makes him look more like a thug in service to robb than anything elsethose boys did robb had a nice analogy here with the line talisa gave him when they first met its really well done because showing the effect she has on him symbolizes the larger effect his marriage with her has to his men let him watch was also a great inclusion from the book karstark was awesome as always applause for jon stahl robbs descent into not villainy but emotional instability reminds me a little of arthas the way its portrayed which is oddly appropriate arthas too brought about the ruin of everything he loved by trying to protect iti still think beric is awesome they had to establish why the rest of the men werent surprised he came back to life so the scene suits me just fine every time i come back to life i lose something  this is an important line because it shows some of grrms psychology too he said that when characters return from the dead theyre often somewhat weaker characters than beforeive given my thoughts on stannis scenes in another topic suffice it to say i enjoyed the scenes but i fear they wont do much for other peoples opinions on him not that it matters the relationship with his family is definitely expanded upon and more interesting though oh and i cant stress enough that davos is not rottingncw gets a 1010 for performance on this episode i could feel his pain and i dont really tend to empathize with jaime all that much how he was holding his arm up was strangely funny to me i imagined all he was needed was a hook and a hat and he couldve gone yarr and started talking like a pirategood to see davos again liam cunningham is my favourite guy on the show hes just such a good and funny irish guy and a fan no lessgoing from aegon the conqueror to daenerys was a smart cuti could listen to ser jorah and barristan talking all day long the mixture of respect tension and apprehension is greati thought it was kind of weird that karstark would have half the army that would make him more powerful than the starks and the riverlords combined yeah i get that the situation has to seem very dire to robb but come on whos going to buy thatanother clever thing was how you could see the silhouettes of the guards in the cersei  littlefinger sceneabout littlefinger though he has a weird and forced way of speaking but it never really bothered me until his scene with sansa where he just sounded many higher degrees of weird come on man you can do better than thatand of course we get charles dance at the end as he did in season 2 he appears for a few minutes at the end of the episode and simply owns everything he almost makes you wanna wish tywin would stick around a while longerall in all i enjoyed the slower pace and time for exposition and character development in this episode edited by stannisanddaeny 29 april 2013  0940 am"

"Ravi Seaworth",2013-04-29,"another thing i think they developed valyrian pretty well to me it is really convincing that they are speaking the same exotic language the accents are very similar and the words are intelligible even though i do not understand anything of what they are saying the show may have its drawbacks such as the somewhat incomplete jon snow but we have to give them credit for clearly looking for perfection i have never seen such a good tv show furthermore unlike many people i am starting to enjoy stannis story it is true that the introduction of two new characters will always look like it came out of the blue for nonreaders despite that i think they actually improved selyse and shireen ps i almost laughed at the sequence of scenes with robb karstark and roose bolton it is written rw all over the place droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool   edited by raviept 29 april 2013  0410 pm"
"GeorgeIAF",2013-04-29,"i gave it a 9 i loved the battle scene between sandor and beric also the bath scene between jaime and brienne the beheading of lord karstark was neatly done also jon and igritte nailed it i was hoping to see patchface as i believed his role was important in the books mainly because his prophecies were true but maybe its not too late the kid playing shireen did a wonderful job portraying her i also hoped to see more of dany but at least we got the introduction of the leader of the unsullied in the end it was a good episode i liked the ending with tywin showing who is the boss around kings landing"
"GeorgeIAF",2013-04-29,"sry for double post i forgot to mention the emotional scene between gendry and arya  and also between arya and thoros great acting"
"Top Notch Balanter",2013-04-29,"i gave it a 9 but it was pretty close to a 10 excellent episode overall the lannisters immense as usual and great work by kerry ingram as shireen i was really really impressed dillane and cunningham performed excellent as well and i felt that richard madden had one of his strongest episodes yet if i was to nitpick a little i might complain about maisie williams but i feel bad about doing it due to how good she has been throughout the show the weaker characters eg jon and littlefinger had good performances which was nice to see still not fully impressed with oona chaplain but again overall the cast had a really good episode"
"SilentSense",2013-04-29,"starts with the best duel thus far awesome then we got to see ygritte naked awesome the rest of the north of the wall story lines continues to be an abject failure however i liked roose bolton but cmon why dont they make the soft voice a feature tv viewers would notice ie make it easy to notice lf continues to be aweful tyrion too much of a white knight 910 because the good was really good imo"
"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-29,"i dont know that i agree with that iirc her son doesnt ask her permission for things which is why she sometimes plays clean up for him however she does plan and execute her own schemes as well and on the show her son hasnt even been seen she is the mover and shaker of the tyrell clan while the book is not as explicit its the feeling i got aobut book qot toomace got them involved in the war with renly and then he got them involved with the lannisters olenna doesnt want margaery to marry joffrey but because mace wants it she has to find a way to ensure margaerys safety without stopping the weddingso i dont really think olenna has as much power as a lot of readers think she has like i said she spends most of her time cleaning up maces mess she still comes up with her own plots such as marrying sansa to willas although in the show this was pretty much given to varys but that doesnt exactly prove her power if mace decided he wanted to marry willas to someone else willas would be married to someone else"
"Dad",2013-04-29,"i really liked it not as good as last weeks episode but wellwhat could be was really really impressed with ncws bathtub monologue i wasnt too keen on his performance at the very beginning but hes done such an amazing job getting under the skin of the character that now i really couldnt imagine anyone else playing the role the execution of the karstarks was brilliantly dramatic incidentally i saw richard madden in an interview the other day and i was amazed to hear he wasnt from the north of england his accent is terrific and as always charles dance  boss also really impressed with the valyrian language theyve done a great job making it really detailed overall a very solid 8 out of 10 edited by dad 29 april 2013  0533 pm"
"Ser Luke.",2013-04-29,"910 second best episode this season the hound vs beric was incredible jaimes bath scene was great and stannis is the man the only thing i didnt really like is the quick subplot with the gay guy and baelish its out of loras character to immediately go with another man after renly died when the sun has set no candle can replace it"
"Arrow",2013-04-29,"also i wonder how much she might have changed her lot if she had learned to understand how her father works and was able to have him truly respect her opinions and person but she doesnt seem to want to do the work for thattrue about her not wanting to do the work  she has probably let her habit of manipulation take the place of striving for actual insight into what makes people tick particularly her father and he is no fool  hes certainly not going to let his daughter who is nowhere near his intellectual equal manipulate him edited by arrow 29 april 2013  0502 pm"

"Lord of Cheese",2013-04-29,"a good episode overall gave it a 7 dont like how they are handling the robb story line making him look like an idiot i wished they showed a little bit of magic with thoros bringing back berric rather than him just saying the words i mean show the kiss with a little bit of fire moving from thoros to berric i think this business with whom gets to marry loras is silly i know they are trying to cut down on characters but making a gay guy go from marrying sansa to then marrying cersei is a little nauseating its bold and the beautiful type storytelling ignoring this the scene was pretty good i wished they would expand more on qyburns history considering he is going to stick around for a bit the dialogue was pretty good this episode jamie and brienne was great wow she is hot jamie checking her out too lol gendry and arya etc etc was also good wow those bottles with foetuses in them was some creepy shit making shireens story combined with patchface im guessing she was the one who sang the closing credits but this just wont work if they are in fact combining her and patchface then it wont work pf was nearly dead when drowned and thats why he talks of the sea"

"Valar Morghulis Not Today",2013-04-30,"yet another top notch episode they really do excel themselves thought the pacing was better than it had been previously it sped up at the end around kings landing but thought that was still fine it seemed to work started with an awesome sword fight though i enjoyed jamie and briennes fight a few weeks ago it was no where near as good as the books so i didnt have great expectations here but the actors outdid themselves my nbr friends were a bit surprised to see berics resurrection  i think they were wondering how many more nondeaths well end up seeing now the writers have this out thought the bath scene was awesome up there with the best scenes of the show in all three series so far think ncw is doing an incredible job of portraying jamie it was one of the story archs i was least interested in when reading but its up there with theon with the ones i want to see on screen just like in the books i think you slowly come around to feeling sorry for him  at least i think my friends are all feeling sorry for him now whilst they wanted to kill him the last few series really liked shireen yet also annoyed that she is blonde thought the babies in the jars were a nice creepy touch disappointed with the lack of patchface but was expecting him to be cut think the show is making us less supportive of the starks overall cause than the books made me can understand the changes loved that they included the this one was only the watcher hang him last so he may watch the others but think they have made robb look a little foolish this season but good to see his father come out in him werent the freys already fighting beside robb in the series was really looking forward to the jonygritte scenes but thought they didnt quite fit dont think weve seen enough of them this series for it to work how they showed it that said rose leslie is stunning on top of all of that we had the queen of thorns on screen with tyrion and a scene with tywin tyrion and cersei feel almost spoilt that they got all of this into one episode thought the forcing cersei to marry loras was a good touch and really glad tyrion mentioned that he was married once again all of my nbr friends had forgotten that overall a 9 just missing that climactic scene"

"if it please m'lord",2013-04-30,"this was my favourite episode this season sure there wasnt a singular moment as spectacular as last weeks dany unleashing the fire moment but overall i found this episode to be more intense and solid from start to finish the bathtub scene with jaime and brienne was flawless it was precisely how i imagined it only even better honestly because both actors look really fantastic naked i love that they showed brienne in the nude with a very sensual gorgeous womanly body and i adored the final shot where she was cradling jaime just fantastic tywins absolute power and command is magnificent to watch he just dresses down tyrion and cersei with such conviction and resoluteness they really have nothing to say the actor playing tywin is superb i also completely loved loras scene with the squire i thought it was an ingenious way to get littlefinger the information he needs to move forward with his plan and also the scene was just hot that squire was sexy as all get out and i like that the show isnt afraid to go there with the gay scene the way they do endlessly with the straight ones"

"Rockroi",2013-04-28,"when i turned the episode eon i immediately thought that there would be no way that the show would threepeat three exceptional episodes in a row wrong not only was it exceptional but it may have been the best episode of the seasonwhat i likedthe cave of fire and snow one of my topeten scenes is the scene between ygritte and jon snow where they come together and really evolve as a couple jon snow jumps into his life with ygritte and yigritte shows real heart and soul and they both prove they want the other this scene completely capture that romance and that humanity of the two and it makes you want them to succeed in everything they dothe humanity of stannis baratheonlois griffin seeing her child stewie with a person tied up and apparently torturing them stewie what are you doingstewie we<U+0080><U+0099>re playing house quickly glances at the person he is torturing roman polanski<U+0080><U+0099>s housefamil guywatching stannis try to be a normal person in the face of his horrifying home life was almost as painful as watching his fleet on fire however<U+0080> maybe for the first time<U+0080> they nailed it for starters stannis regrets some of his decisions and even regrets betraying his wife his wife well<U+0080> she<U+0080><U+0099>s a bit <U+0080> touched for starters she is okay with it second she is enamored by mel third she keeps her dead babies fourth she may or may not keep her only child locked up in a tower which is equal parts good thinking nad fucking terrifyingand in case you missed it she keeps the dead bodies of her three stillborn babies in floating in green liquid in her chambers where she sleepsbut here<U+0080><U+0099>s the thing she knew how to talk to stannis she gets it and she gets him i thought it was wonderful when she just called him <U+0080><U+009C>stannis<U+0080><U+009D> and it appeared to disarm him she wants stannis to succeed and is standing by him she completely brushes his guilt aside all the while she stares at her <U+0080><U+009C>boys<U+0080><U+009D> stannis also gets her he genuinely feels bad for her he genuinely sympathies with her he genuinely wants others to respect her and he wants to give her the respect she deserves going so far as to ask her permission to see hius daughterand all the while we see the pain and misery these people have lived withstannis with his child was maybe the best scene with stannis since he stormed a beach apparently by himself shireen<U+0080><U+0099>s explosion of unconditional love and affection <U+0080> for stannis was as surprising as it was natural what little girl does not love her daddy even if that daddy is the most socially inept and coldhearted person in the seven kingdomsand the fact that that little girl sang that song was<U+0080> perfectthe dog and the dead man i liked the hound<U+0080><U+0099>s redemption for starters i liked that that fight was almost moveformove <U+0080><U+0093> identical to the book and that it had this inyourface element of death death death that was a dangerous fight between dangerous men and they ate the scene up i also continue to enjoy this reimagined hound not the whimpering and angry hound of the book but the more ferrel and the more blackhumored onethe lion the wolf and the burden of rule there are two powers still truly at war the lannisters and the starks and the episode detailed how the two sides are waging it i thought robb acted 100 perfectly and correctly you cannot allow a lord like karstark to act out of line like that and expect others to follow you have to remove that corruption root and stem so i am a little perplexed if the show is couching robb<U+0080><U+0099>s decision as a mistake i hope not when his actual mistake was to you know break his oathmeanwhile back with the sid eiwnning the war tywin ahs a family and that family will do exactly as he commands while he slowly <U+0080><U+009C>chips away<U+0080><U+009D> and robb stark by doing nothing tywin is playing everyone and its about time cersei and tyrion learn to dance along everyone played that scene perfectlybecause ruling comes with a price sometimes you have to marry somebody you dont like sometimes your kids are idiots and sometimes you have to kill the guy who killed your enemys children because its easy to criticize but kings dont criticize they rule robb and tywin are rullingthe lord commander and the slaver i loved the few minutes we got with dany and her advisors even mormont recalling his knighting and i loved that they kept the grey worm scene i think the show is doing a better job with the selmymormont relationship than the books and even shows why mormont is so distant because he<U+0080><U+0099>s hidingthe kingslayer and the wench you kill that you kill the mad man who wants to burn the city down and you do it as soon as you can you don<U+0080><U+0099>t wait around for others to negotiate or to fight with honor or to get the children to safety no you kill the pyromancer first and then you kill aerys the mad that<U+0080><U+0099>s honor and it does not matter if arthur dayne or ned stark think so or not because somebody had to kill aerys and jaime lannister was the only guy who had the guts to do it and what was his reward scornbecause did any of us every think ned stark wanted to hear jaime<U+0080><U+0099>s side of the story really i have been saying since i first read sos that jaime was right to do what he did and ned stark loves judging other people to the point of absurdityand all the while she is looking at him and her eyes screaming <U+0080><U+009C>no<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> and the whole while the steam the steam the steam<U+0080> smoke smoke smokekissed by fire<U+0080>what i am on the fence aboutthe queen of thorns and hammy writing i like lady olenna and i enjoy her scenes in bite sized portions but <U+0080> every week it appears to be the same thing lady olenna sits down next to an established character the established character immediately losses all the intellect charm wit and danger they possessed up to the moment they met lady olenna and act hamhanded clumsy foolish and boarderline stupid started with sansa continued with cersei reached ridiculous heights with varys and culminated this week in the show utterly neutering its best character<U+0080> all to make olenna seemed smart this week was the worst because tyrion is the best character on the show and to make him seem tonguetied awkward clumsy and intimidated by her is utterly out of placeagain it<U+0080><U+0099>s not that bad after all would we want just another terrible character fopr the champions of westeros to just intellectually beat up of course not at the same time it would be nice if the characters we knew acted sounded spoke or even seemed like the characters who we thought they were and not cardboard cut outs it seems rather lazywhat i did not likecan<U+0080><U+0099>t find anything and i am stunned that for the second week in a row i could not find something i did not likefor three episodes in a row the show has put up huge numbers fantastic ability to really integrate the best parts of the books into the show and do it seamlesslynow can they go fourforfourthhis

"teemo",2013-04-29,"this was by far my favorite episode since probably something from season 1 maybe not quite blackwater but it was stellar i even liked it a lot more than last week and im one of those crazy book purist people and i usually really really hate bryan cogmans episodes but this wasfantastic i was shocked i think it was a wise decision to slow down the pacing a little and give us longer scenes i was saying last week that with all of these new characters so many of them and their stories are losing significance and impact because of how little screen time they get this was paced so welllonger scenes but we still were able to see plenty of characters and some of the best at that i felt like for people who have been feeling disconnecteddistant from the characters this was a great way to kind of slow down a bit and mend that also soooo much was pulled straight from the books and when they do that it always makes for some of the shows best dialogue and i wish they did it more often there were not that many book deviations this week and the ones that were didnt bug the hell out of me like they usually do for the first time in awhile i wasnt thinking all of the time god this was such a pointless deviation but more like this is a great way to translate this scene to television damn i think the karstarkrobb scene was done very well and it really was a great reminder of how much robb can be like his father they also did it in a way that didnt make robb look like a total dick showing the murder of the little boys makes it much easier to not sympathize with karstark even though in the show one of his sons was murdered by jaime rather than killed in battle robb is starting to finally be a little more likable again shireenpatchface combo was really great fan service and awesome choice of credits a to whoever thought of that the greyscale was also really nicely done and shireen is adorable jorah being sneaky around barristan was nice i wonder if everyone picked up on that the fight scene between the hound vs beric was obviously awesome and maisie is such a great actress jaime talking about what happened in kl that day was very welldone and really necessary oh and i loved how roose bolton screwed with jaime by sort of pretending his sissy was dead it really shows rooses mean streak yayyyy finally an episode im truly happy about"
"ohpooratlas",2013-04-29,"really loved this episode my immediate thoughts  tywin lannister is a boss the end  i really loved shireen and i love that she is the one that introduces the davos learning to read plotline she was adorable and a nice contrast to the religious zealotry of selyse i think at this point she will be the only thing to humanize stanis  the houndberic scene was amazing i love arya more and more with each episode shes losing everyone around her which is going to make it all the worse when we get to the rw  robb stark is a sweet summer child for thinking that the freys of all people will be the ones to save him in the end i loled so hard when he said that  really really glad sansa is not the one to reveal the tyrell plot to baelish she clearly does not trust baelish shes beginning to learn how to play the game now not that it matters bwahaha  jaimebriennes bathtub scene was flawless thats all i have to say i just about lost it when he said my name is jaime out loud sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  the only thing that i didnt really like about the episode was the jon snowygritte scene or rather  everything after the lords kiss it just seemed too sudden probably due in large part that they did not have an opportunity to develop their relationship at all this season and i loved this scene in the books so it bummed me out a little last note shireen singing patchfaces song over the credits everyone keeps saying it was creepy but i thought it was strangely  beautiful i dont know im weird but i was definitely thinking thats patchfaces song do we have a translation of it yet"

"MoAt",2013-04-29,"i am using this post to go on record with my predictions regarding not how the show will change the books but rather to note where i think martins story is going1 arya and gendry are going to have a romance if not be a married couple that dialog between them tonight was absolutely dead on as a foreshawdowing of this gendry was asserting his need not only to be free of a masterserf relationship but also his need not to be subservient to arya i am not claiming that they have feelings for one another in a romantic way right now that would be creepy and out of character for both of them but they will they are a natural pair when gendry learns he is a baratheon he is going to change his idea of himself i dont mean he is going to think like a lord quite the opposite he may even accept what he is but reject the idea of lording it over anyone which totally matches aryas idea of how she would like to live her life not as a great lady but as a woman who makes decisions for herself about how she wants to live and knowing he is her social equal is going to give him the emotional confidence to both allow himself to feel his attracton to her and maybe even pursue her he is aware he cannot be her family now but he will know differently later2 daenerys and jon are going to be a riveting pair once they finally meet i dont know if they will be given a happy ending but they are going to recognize what they are to one another in a big way and it is going to register as a physical and spiritual attraction they will marry if martin wants to give anyone a happy ending but it will be much like frodos happy ending that is they will both be haunted for life because of what they have had to do and had done to them3 sorry to tell those who love stannis but he is a creep and is surrounded by creeps maybe he isnt entirely responsible for his dark side but it is there and he will never ever get to sit on the iron throne unless it is about to be destroyed his agony is apparent in this episode he knows he is not what he should be danys dream of the destroyed throne room suggest to me that she will arrive in kings landing after it is already destroyed perhaps after stannis sits on it and precipitates its destruction 4 danys is in no way the evil queen some on this board suggest both the actress and the script are making that crystal clear she will have more dark crises and she will make huge mistakes with her dragons but those mistakes in essos are part of her training for leadership of the battle to come in westeros against the others she is going to have to learn how to control her dragons and how not to make serious leadership mistakes this is the reason dwd ends with her standing next to drogon about to be confronted andor supported by dothraki the battle against the others will involve an alliance between former antagonists i dont see many dothraki crossing over into westeros but perhaps they will be her reserve force or a key number of them will cross the narrow sea with her ultimately she may reform their culture from its mysognism but it wont be a genuine reform 5 two strains of magic will be revealed clearly by the end of the series tolkeins universe is being repeated in this sense the red god or some of his minionswill turn out to be evil in other words the god may have been misinterpreted by his followers i cannot see beric as evil but he is compromised in some way and this episode made that clear flame away this is here as a record which i am bookmarking i am not so nice as not to say i told you so smokinggif classbbcemoticon altsmoking  fencinggif classbbcemoticon altfencing  smuggif classbbcemoticon altsmug i can totally see all that happening bravo"

"Joey Beers",2013-04-29,"hmmm during the episode i found myself saying what the hell too many times it always happens at least once when the show deviates from the text in some significant way but tonight it happened more than i would like to abide that being said by the end of the episode i was happy to have seen it that says something right there right even with the unpredictable changes to the story the show still manages to be enticing and great to watch breakdown i thought tqot was awesome as usual after tonights scene with her and tyrion i kind of wish there was more sparring between those two in the books jamies revealing account of his role at the end of robs rebellion was done pretty well great acting only tainted in my mind through lack of the back story the readers are privy to as a side note that scene was a glute of buttocks robbs revelation about how to bolster his army by reconciling with the freys was devastating because we know the result it was also a great way to help the tv viewer realize later on that the rw was robbs fault since they romanticized his courting of that one girl who isnt in the book showing him making a decision in a moment of strategic epiphany is a good way to show his flaws the dondarrion v clegane fight was fine didnt find anything to bitch about or to praise really glad jon and ygritte got some scenes but for some reason the show has yet to give jon the depth ive been hoping for aryas a killer winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  also seeing jorah mormont and barristen selmy kind of engage in a battle of wits makes me want to hit my brain right in the head not exactly sure why anyway good stuff but last week was much better in my opinion oh yeah anytime dany speaks valyrian i feel it in my bones i never really thought about it reading the books but until we meet aegon no other contender for the throne seems as worldly as dany language and travel just make you seem legit as hell which is why i wake up every day and look in the mirror and say hello bonjour hola ni hao before easing into my morning robe and perusing the journal which is what i call this forum edited by joey beers 29 april 2013  0201 am"

"MoAt",2013-04-29,"when i turned the episode eon i immediately thought that there would be no way that the show would threepeat three exceptional episodes in a row wrong not only was it exceptional but it may have been the best episode of the seasonwhat i likedthe cave of fire and snow one of my topeten scenes is the scene between ygritte and jon snow where they come together and really evolve as a couple jon snow jumps into his life with ygritte and yigritte shows real heart and soul and they both prove they want the other this scene completely capture that romance and that humanity of the two and it makes you want them to succeed in everything they dothe humanity of stannis baratheonlois griffin seeing her child stewie with a person tied up and apparently torturing them stewie what are you doingstewie we<U+0080><U+0099>re playing house quickly glances at the person he is torturing roman polanski<U+0080><U+0099>s housefamil guywatching stannis try to be a normal person in the face of his horrifying home life was almost as painful as watching his fleet on fire however<U+0080> maybe for the first time<U+0080> they nailed it for starters stannis regrets some of his decisions and even regrets betraying his wife his wife well<U+0080> she<U+0080><U+0099>s a bit <U+0080> touched for starters she is okay with it second she is enamored by mel third she keeps her dead babies fourth she may or may not keep her only child locked up in a tower which is equal parts good thinking nad fucking terrifyingand in case you missed it she keeps the dead bodies of her three stillborn babies in floating in green liquid in her chambers where she sleepsbut here<U+0080><U+0099>s the thing she knew how to talk to stannis she gets it and she gets him i thought it was wonderful when she just called him <U+0080><U+009C>stannis<U+0080><U+009D> and it appeared to disarm him she wants stannis to succeed and is standing by him she completely brushes his guilt aside all the while she stares at her <U+0080><U+009C>boys<U+0080><U+009D> stannis also gets her he genuinely feels bad for her he genuinely sympathies with her he genuinely wants others to respect her and he wants to give her the respect she deserves going so far as to ask her permission to see hius daughterand all the while we see the pain and misery these people have lived withstannis with his child was maybe the best scene with stannis since he stormed a beach apparently by himself shireen<U+0080><U+0099>s explosion of unconditional love and affection <U+0080> for stannis was as surprising as it was natural what little girl does not love her daddy even if that daddy is the most socially inept and coldhearted person in the seven kingdomsand the fact that that little girl sang that song was<U+0080> perfectthe dog and the dead man i liked the hound<U+0080><U+0099>s redemption for starters i liked that that fight was almost moveformove <U+0080><U+0093> identical to the book and that it had this inyourface element of death death death that was a dangerous fight between dangerous men and they ate the scene up i also continue to enjoy this reimagined hound not the whimpering and angry hound of the book but the more ferrel and the more blackhumored onethe lion the wolf and the burden of rule there are two powers still truly at war the lannisters and the starks and the episode detailed how the two sides are waging it i thought robb acted 100 perfectly and correctly you cannot allow a lord like karstark to act out of line like that and expect others to follow you have to remove that corruption root and stem so i am a little perplexed if the show is couching robb<U+0080><U+0099>s decision as a mistake i hope not when his actual mistake was to you know break his oathmeanwhile back with the sid eiwnning the war tywin ahs a family and that family will do exactly as he commands while he slowly <U+0080><U+009C>chips away<U+0080><U+009D> and robb stark by doing nothing tywin is playing everyone and its about time cersei and tyrion learn to dance along everyone played that scene perfectlybecause ruling comes with a price sometimes you have to marry somebody you dont like sometimes your kids are idiots and sometimes you have to kill the guy who killed your enemys children because its easy to criticize but kings dont criticize they rule robb and tywin are rullingthe lord commander and the slaver i loved the few minutes we got with dany and her advisors even mormont recalling his knighting and i loved that they kept the grey worm scene i think the show is doing a better job with the selmymormont relationship than the books and even shows why mormont is so distant because he<U+0080><U+0099>s hidingthe kingslayer and the wench you kill that you kill the mad man who wants to burn the city down and you do it as soon as you can you don<U+0080><U+0099>t wait around for others to negotiate or to fight with honor or to get the children to safety no you kill the pyromancer first and then you kill aerys the mad that<U+0080><U+0099>s honor and it does not matter if arthur dayne or ned stark think so or not because somebody had to kill aerys and jaime lannister was the only guy who had the guts to do it and what was his reward scornbecause did any of us every think ned stark wanted to hear jaime<U+0080><U+0099>s side of the story really i have been saying since i first read sos that jaime was right to do what he did and ned stark loves judging other people to the point of absurdityand all the while she is looking at him and her eyes screaming <U+0080><U+009C>no<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> and the whole while the steam the steam the steam<U+0080> smoke smoke smokekissed by fire<U+0080>what i am on the fence aboutthe queen of thorns and hammy writing i like lady olenna and i enjoy her scenes in bite sized portions but <U+0080> every week it appears to be the same thing lady olenna sits down next to an established character the established character immediately losses all the intellect charm wit and danger they possessed up to the moment they met lady olenna and act hamhanded clumsy foolish and boarderline stupid started with sansa continued with cersei reached ridiculous heights with varys and culminated this week in the show utterly neutering its best character<U+0080> all to make olenna seemed smart this week was the worst because tyrion is the best character on the show and to make him seem tonguetied awkward clumsy and intimidated by her is utterly out of placeagain it<U+0080><U+0099>s not that bad after all would we want just another terrible character fopr the champions of westeros to just intellectually beat up of course not at the same time it would be nice if the characters we knew acted sounded spoke or even seemed like the characters who we thought they were and not cardboard cut outs it seems rather lazywhat i did not likecan<U+0080><U+0099>t find anything and i am stunned that for the second week in a row i could not find something i did not likefor three episodes in a row the show has put up huge numbers fantastic ability to really integrate the best parts of the books into the show and do it seamlesslynow can they go fourforfourthhis was the best episode of the seasontotally agree with everything except about the queen of thornes especially the kingslayer and the wench you nailed thatevery adult smart character so far with the exception of margaery because she knows better who shares a scene with her makes the prejudicial mistake of taking her for a doddering old women when in fact she is the smartest person in the room with likely a lisbeth salanderlevel photographic memory who is too old to put up with other peoples bullshit she hasnt the time nor the patience and i love her for that"

"irenadel",2013-04-29,"for those of you who are complaining about loras fooling around with another man sex doesnt equal love we never get his pov in the books so we cant be 100 certain that he never slept with anyone after renlys deathim usually on board with a lot of changes they make especially those about eliminating book characters to streamline the story im not even mad at the lack of willas it makes sense same here its not the sex or even the concept of using known network of whorespies for littlefinger i think the problem is the tone of the sceneloras seems too carefree and too similar to how he was with renly and last season he had a couple of really nice lines of grief what do you want most in the world revenge clearly tvloras was affected by renlys death im not saying someone cant drown his grief in sex or try for a little human companionship but there is just no sense of that grief here and unfortunatelywell despite the relationship not being explicit in the booksgrrm does manage to score a really good point for homosexuality theres a big stereotype saying gay men are fickle and promiscuous and that somehow homosexual love is just about gratification and not about something like deep heterosexual love bookloras was a huge mark against that stereotype of popular culture bookloras mourned in a very young way he acted exactly like a teen in love would act straight or gay and this grief and devotion that even jaime lannister saw just seems completely absent from tvlorasi would have been totally into that scene if we could see the grief maybe a loras who is all bitterly complaining about the marriage looking for a sympathetic ear or a loras who is all like shut up youre not here to talk or a loras who is trying desperately to act carefree but on whom you can see the despair leeking through i was on board with how unaffected loras seemed during all his other scenes because that was his public persona evidently the tyrell siblings know how to pull off successful public personas but this was a private moment exactly the perfect moment to show grief"
"The Mondrian Oak",2013-04-29,"to all those who complained about the butchery of qhorin halfhand last year you see todays episode proved dd right they needed to flesh out ygritte in order to make her falling for jon more solid since as you may have noticed there was absolutely no time to develop her carachter in this season so they had to create all those new scenes with her an jon last year in order to lay the ground for their chemistry and still their romance feels a bit rushed even after all those scenes they have been in last season imagine if they hadnt dropped qhorins and jons running chapters another entire storyline with jon and ygritte falling in love would have needed to be fleshed out this season and there would have been no time at all as you can all see while given what theyve done they actually did not show ygritte for 2 or 3 weeks and still showed a believable and solid love scene yes qhorins chapters would have been amazing on screen still they had to be dropped for the sake of carachter development of more important carachters i salute you dd"

"DrRobotnik",2013-04-29,"good episode patchface is probably the creepiest character in all the books but you can understand why they need to cut him the fetuses were a nice touch designed to compensate for the loss in creepiness its nice that theyre developing rooses character as a bit of a sly sadist but that might be a bit too subtle for nonbook readers ill be disappointed if they dont give roose his leeches one of the defining features of the character  come on"

"SerMixalot",2013-04-29,"to all those who complained about the butchery of qhorin halfhand last yearyou see todays episode proved dd right they needed to flesh out ygritte in order to make her falling for jon more solid since as you may have noticed there was absolutely no time to develop her carachter in this season so they had to create all those new scenes with her an jon last year in order to lay the ground for their chemistry and still their romance feels a bit rushed even after all those scenes they have been in last season imagine if they hadnt dropped qhorins and jons running chapters another entire storyline with jon and ygritte falling in love would have needed to be fleshed out this season and there would have been no time at all as you can all see while given what theyve done they actually did not show ygritte for 2 or 3 weeks and still showed a believable and solid love sceneyes qhorins chapters would have been amazing on screen still they had to be dropped for the sake of carachter development of more important carachtersi salute you ddsorry i have to totally disagree with you all of that flirtation was done when y was js captive and she was working him to escape that was manipulation not setting up a relationship and nothing since has shown any romantic spark between the two if they replaced that horrible pos escapade they certainly could have worked a scene or two in this season establishing some chemistry between the 2 i felt the sex essentially came out of nowhere on the show"

"SerMixalot",2013-04-29,"i also thought this was a good episodethe stannis household dynamics were perhaps the most pleasant surprise while selyse with her jars was too much for my taste the discussion she had with stannis was delightfully awkward and shireen was a darling i liked how she interacted with both her father and davosthe scene with arya and gendry was heartfelt as well really enjoyed the discussion between jorah and barristan too i dont remember well how jorahbarristan relationship was handled in the books but it seems like more interesting here perhaps because of the actors theyre both stellar and charismatic i like the mix between camaraderie and suspiciousness theyre expressingand on a more shallow note the nakedness and there was quite a lot of it felt finally like an integral and natural part of the story who wouldve guessedi actually liked the scene because it was nice to see tyrion tonguetied for a change i mean even he has to experience that sometimes and is there anyone better to outwit him than qot although ill admit that since qot has done the same thing over and over again its getting a bit repetitiveon the other hand tyrions comment to tywin about getting the tyrells to pay half of the wedding expenses made me think that perhaps tyrion had in fact played olenna or maybe he was just trying to impress his father i dont knowand i believe she does the same with tywin next episode breaking his quill and all"

"Rockroi",2013-04-29,"because charles dance does such a fantastic job as tywin and hes so fun to watch im afraid viewers are going to start getting an overly rosy view of him hes actually a really terrible person who frequently misjudges situations and people hes a worldclass bully and a machiavellian ruleroh i disagree i think the portrayal of tywin is very true to the books dances performance is simply putting a face to the name saying that tywin is a bully is not an accurate description of the character given his track record yes he sometimes forces people to do things in his best interest but he also fights people tarbacks catemeres the darkes of duskendale he is not a man given to empty promises in fact that tywins most notable character trait  if he tells you he is going to do something he does it there was a reason that the people who eventually do business with tywin did business with him  because they knew they could trust tywin as strange as that may seem further tywin is actually an exceptional good judge of character and his moves in the books and before the books show thisto me the reason viewers like tywin is because tywin is intelligent savvy ruthless and effective so many characters  in a time ruled by all these attributes  seem to lack many of themquick change of topic to the jaimened dynamici find that while other characters are given the always laudable get out of oathbreakerjail free card jaime apparently has to stay there until he pulls an andy duphrane i can always understand why robert and ned had to rebel but they were oath breakers their oath was to obey their king and their king commanded them to come to kl to answer for ludicrously crazy chargers of treason so they know its bs so they rebel i have no problem with them rebelling but lets call a spade a spade they broke their oaths for exceptionally good reasons because most oaths are bullshit to begin with and i have no problem with thatbut jaime does and hes scum whaaaaaaajaime also swore an oath to protect the king and defend the realm and protect the innocent and obey his father etc weve been through all that and there is no need to rehash that so when aerys wants to kill the innocent and murder tywin jaime is faced with kants conflict of duties wherein he is damned if he does and damned if he does not the problem is that had jaime chose to do nothing and aerys immolated the city nobody would have blamed jaime but fat lotta good that would have done all the dead people in the city see thats why being judgmental like ned  is awesome you get to live in a world where1 you are an oathbreaker2 kings landing is not burned to the ground because the king is a raging lunatic because3 another guy does the dirty work of killing the king which leads to the best part4 you get to act all superior and judgmental to the guy who killed the king even though you were in the process of trying to kill that same king thus5 you get to call other people oathbreakersned stark keeping his hands clean of terrible acts while directly benefiting from those terrible acts since 283 althis is why jaime and ned work soooooo well they are the others doppelganger  each one finds in the other the things they hate most about themselves jaime hates ned because ned is an honorable man and jaime is less than that ned hates jaime because jaime killed aerys while ned was in the process of trying to kill aerys ned sees in jaime all the things he hates about himself both have intense feelings for their sisters both men serve the realm both men wish to be left alone both men are deadly both men are relatively simple both men hate explaining themselvesto that end jaimes duality with ned is a constant theme ultimately unlocked by jaime later in the books however i find that cycle compelling and the show brought it back a great deal in this episodewhich leads me to this how come everyone gives selmy a free pass selmys oath of loyalty to aerys passed immediately mind you  to viserys at the moment aerys was slain there is no gap where selmy gets to decide whether or not his loyalty should be suspended hes oath is to that family and not to robert but selmy chooses robert for very good reasons and he continues on until he decides he needs another targ to serve imagine that selmy honorable jaime  dishonorablecome again selmy should have out of duty and honor and all the other things ned stark loves to chirp about  recovered from his wounds and immediately attempted to escape ad begin serving viserys he instead changed sides or cloaks really and nobody bats an eyelashso ned loves selmy so does jaime which is another commonality and the audinace loves selmy but selmy hates jaime because jaime betrayed the targs at a certain point we all have to admit one thing if you are clever enough and circumspect enough and cunning enough you can find a reason to disobey ignore or supersede any oath ned and robert found a way so did hoster tully jon arryn and stannis baratheon and none of them were charged with treason same goes for barristan selmybut if you are jaime well sorry buddy you committed the unpardonable sin of killing somebody everyone else was trying to kill and thus in ancient nomad tribes it was customary for the tribe to find an animal a sheep or a goat  and when the bad acts of the tribe got too great they would take this animal and everyone in the tribe would say the acts they had done wrong and put something on this animals back once everyone in the tribe had done that they would send the animal out into the elements to die of starvation or thirst but with every sin of the tribe on its back so that while it suffered for the sins of the tribe the tribe felt vindicated pure and goodits where we get the term scapegoating thus for ned and selmy and stannis and tully etc etc etc he is the oathbreaker not them they have reasons and excuses and clever and pithy sayings and ideas etc etc etcso they send him out into the elements so he can die and they can all feel good edited by rockroi 29 april 2013  0851 am"

"Blind Beth the Cat Lady",2013-04-29,"oh i disagree i think the portrayal of tywin is very true to the books dances performance is simply putting a face to the name saying that tywin is a bully is not an accurate description of the character given his track record yes he sometimes forces people to do things in his best interest but he also fights people tarbacks catemeres the darkes of duskendale he is not a man given to empty promises in fact that tywins most notable character trait  if he tells you he is going to do something he does it there was a reason that the people who eventually do business with tywin did business with him  because they knew they could trust tywin as strange as that may seem further tywin is actually an exceptional good judge of character and his moves in the books and before the books show thisto me the reason viewers like tywin is because tywin is intelligent savvy ruthless and effective so many characters  in a time ruled by all these attributes  seem to lack many of themmaybe bully is the wrong wordi meant that tywin gets people to do things not by establishing that these things are actually good ideas but by cowing the people hes dealing with he certainly doesnt make empty threats but thats part of it people do trust himbut mostly they trust him to destroy them if they cross him when he throws out scathing insults they are effective not because they are necesarily accurate but because he has such a dominating demeanorwhen it comes to judging people and situations hes generally good but also makes important missteps usually in the form of underestimating the other person he underestimates robb in their first battles against each other although i will admit his other warrelated decisions are very savy and ruthless mainly he misjudges people in his personal circle particularly his children this comes to a head towards the end of sos when jaime flatly refuses to do what tywin wants and then tyrion gets the jump on tywin in the privy i think tywin also severly underestimates cerceis cleverness ruthlessness and personal drive although that misjudgement doesnt end up having severe direct consequenses for himtheres some other things he doesnt catch on to as wellthe red viper planning to champion tyrion and littlefinger spiriting away sansa he doesnt catch on to any aspect of the joffrey murder conspiracyso in general tywin is savy ruthless and effective but he frequently has blind spots and makes some pretty severe mistakes when it comes to judging certain characters im just afraid his judgement flaws are getting lost in the awesome performance but i guess when his crows come home to roost next season it will become pretty apparent to everyoneedit i also agree that show tywin is very true to book tywin i just think book tywin is presented in such a way that his flaws are more apparent edited by smaug the dreadful 29 april 2013  1038 am"

"NickyM",2013-04-29,"now you are just going to feed the people that will want to blame ned loli can see how some of roberts actions may have made cersei want to get back at him by hooking up with jaime and bearing his kids but i cant say with confidence that they ever would have stopped regardless of how good robert was to her i am not not completely buying that cersei gave a good faith effort to robert or a further argument that if he was only nicer she would have been a loving wife and stopped screwing her brother i find that flimsyi know what you mean im a firm believer that everyone is going to continually screw up its what you do after the fact that makes you an asshole jaime took a vow of celibiey and broke to bang someone elses wife all of that makes him an asshole not the fact she was his sister not the fact robert cheated continually on hermy true complaint about the whole jaime not defending his actions were despite ned thinking whatever he thought jaime should have stated i had to stop him from using the wildfire to destory the city whether he was believed or not would have been on everyone else but not defending yourself or even explaining seems the oppisite of prideful im not sure why but to me it does"

"BlueDragon",2013-04-30,"not saying they didnt i am just saying i understand what jaime did as i would have done the same thing and i dont understand why he got the flak that he did for killing a clearly insane king before innocents got hurthis pride was insulted by ned stark so he decided not to tell anyone in other words he had a selfcentered fit and didnt have the fortitude to explain himself in a highly contentious situation it didnt help that his father was busy betraying the king from inside the wall of the red keepi have sympathy for jaime once he tells his story but being called the kingslayer is not the sort of horror to which he sentenced bran i think that martin is manipulating our perception of jaime in this sensethe world is grey and there are a lot of good reasons for the evil people do but that doesnt mean everyones actions can be redeemed away by explanation"

"Necromancer",2013-05-01,"best episode of season 3 so far the cave scene between jon and ygritte was really well done a good escape from the horror and death that makes up the rest of the story the bath scene with jaime and brienne was excellent very well written by brian cogman and fantastically acted by nikolaj costerwaldau and gwendoline christie where we finally see a more human side to jaime i also have to voice my opinion that michael mcelhatton who plays roose bolton is the shows most underrated actor the scene where he told jaime about the battle of blackwater bay was brilliantly subtle i hugely enjoyed the scene between the tyrion and olenna not from the book but a really interesting encounter between the two most intelligent characters in the series not a smart expectation on my part but i didnt think theyd actually show karstark killing the lannister boys the scene of robb beheading karstark was brilliantly handled the similarities to theon killing rodrik was a nice way of showing the robb is losing his grip the dragonstone scenes were interesting as stannis seems to have a closer relationship with selyse and shireen than he does in the books the dead fetuses in the jars were very creepy and its not altogether ridiculous to imagine that they did exist in the book shireen was made very likable by kerry ingram and i like the interaction between herself and davos her singing patchfaces song was a cool nod to book readers the hound vs beric was awesome and maisie williams was on the top of her game in every one of her scenes richard dormer did a great job of showing berics depleted humanity the scene between jorah and barristan showed that despite both of them being knights theres a lot of contrast between them barristans speech about wanting to serve someone he believes in gave us a great insight into what an honorable man he is nice hint at the end that barristan knows that jorah is one of varys spies the casting of grey worm was very fitting he really feels like a warrior who has been enslaved all his life i loved the way he delivered his lines in valyrian he did it with a lot of intensity the final scene really showed tywins influence one of the few times hes ever raised his voice despite the fact that his children and are the queen regent and the master of coin he still has them on a tight leash clever way of avoiding unnecessary characters by replacing willas with loras speaking of loras his scene was the episodes only weak point he seems to have gotten over renlys death way too quickly there were plenty of other things they could have done to have littlefinger discover the marraige plot"

cause of character development for every one to start of from the beginning the hound and beric dondarrion  the fight was great firey sword awesome i thought the hound would die but yet again i was surprised this is why i love it and just like that beric was dead stunnedgif classbbcemoticon altstunned  and by the simple words of a priest he is alive stunnedgif classbbcemoticon altstunned  they turned me in to believer so the lord of the light is not to be messed around with i tought that was just aahh like all religions but the night is dark and ful of terrores he has been risen six times the lord must really love him and by this time i knew this is going to be great ep arya  i am really sorry for her she is full of anger and pain and she is just a girl so sad i feel for her and i feel with her i understand everything she is going trought it is not easy she needs someone to be dead anybody she hates she was very hurt when gendry said that he is staying and letting her go i will be your family you will be mlady it put tears in my eyes if the circumstances were diferent she would need a hug from her mother but from this point she needs to learn to how to manage her anger and aim streight as much as i hate what she is going throught i like it cause for me she is the stronges stark of all and i am very interested in her story and how it will go from now i think brothers can teach her a lot stannis  this episode were full of storytelling and i love iti knew he had a wife and a daughter but i didnt expect this this ep surprised me in so many ways maybe for those who read the books this was the chill ep but for me it was enlightenment i found out so many things that had been puzzeling me so stannis is feeling guilt couse he is soft when it comes to redheads he is trying to apologize and his wife is giving him blesings and keeping their sons in jars that was disturbing but then again life can make you crazy i can see why is the way he is without a smile his story is moving he too is in grief and that is why his face is in constant pain that is what had bothered me about him from the start and now i know his little girl is so sweet she is a true child full of life and love i see him as the king of the north now jon snow  every ep with him brings smile to my face blushinggif classbbcemoticon altblushing  and this one gave me droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool  ok now to the story i truly believe that he is loyal to the crows because if he is not i would be so disappointed he is the only one innocent loyal brave  oh i can go on and on and on he is for me from the start the best character he got all the good ones no sins at all i can not finde a bad bone in him how will he be crushed is yet to be seen but crushing him will be a hard job to do we have seen him not obeying the vows but then who can blame him droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool  sorry he has to be the one who will do good always rob  ok he is one of my favourite characters but now he is just doing stupid mistakes one after another karstark killed some lannister boys so they were kids but then killing kids in a war is ok they were lannisters i understand the karstark wanted to kill them maybe it is not moral or a good chioce but understandable it is what is not understandable is rob killing karstark the lannisters killed your father they are keeping your sistersyou are in war with them hey and you cut of his head you should give him a medal losing half of his army stupid stupid stupid rob need same good spanking pride is a sin no matter who you are i do not like proud people they are very vain and what does he do next more stupid stupid stupid thing he call a guythat he stabbed in the back and think he will come runing to him with a smile you

"Mr Smith",2013-04-29,"when these characters werent introduced in season 2 id pretty much given up on them being introduced at all particularly in selyses case given that they really could have got away with just mentioning her and her role really isnt that major shireen may yet be a little more important given the mystery surrounding greyscale and the theory that there will be an outbreak in westeros in the coming books also worth noting is that they seem to have merged her character with patchfaces judging by the song she was singing we dont know where his character is going in the books either and martin may have told them something that we dont know so its probably not to surprising theyve got some element of him in the show even if they didnt use his character entirely thoughts"

"ViennaGirl",2013-04-29,"i thought selyses level of crazy was mostly consistent with the books even including the bottle babies shed have to be pretty out there to not just approve of but actively support mels relationship with her husband so im okay with a high level of tv crazy i dont think its consistent to have her be hostile to shireen though book selyse does love her daughter even through the crazy i never really felt anything about shireen in the books but tv shireen is pretty adorable and sympathetic i miss patchface maybe he would have been out of context without the other fools who also werent cast butterbumps dontos etc in tv westeros we dont see the role of a fool played by anyone so patchface alone would be pretty jarring"

"Sixshells",2013-04-29,"shireen was great its good they gave her more depth and presence in the scenes where she is although since she doesnt look that disfigured in the show they really should have put a reminder about greyscale because the way she looks doesnt give enough reason for her parents to keep her away like that the dead foetuses from area 51 were a bit over the top but creepiness has its place on the show i must have missed something however where does all this talk of gendry going to dragonstone and melisandre using his blood come from is that one of those crazy fan theories that some people have come to take for granted despite a lack of proof or is there actual evidence to back it up because i see those posts saying that gendry will somehow find himself whisked away from the bwb to stannis and mel and its just weird to even imagine it happening"

"Toxspecific",2013-04-29,"thanks for pointing out that your reading a book and comprehending it are two different things stannis is everything like galad and nothing like loras loras has passion and makes commitments and mistakes loras clearly does not hold himself or anyone else to rigid standards aside from the superficial difference in looks between galad and stannis their important similarity is their rigid belief systems that lead them to judge themselves and everyone around them by impossible standards leading to disastrous resultsfrom what i read galads character extravagant social good with people unless he experienced a change of character in the series i stopped reading at a certain point but unless that dude became a dead serious guy who is bad with his people skills i cant imagine him being anything like stannis"
"Jasta11",2013-04-29,"lets be honest stannis didnt become a really respected character until he came to the wall lets give him some time at the same point in the books hes also a halfdepressed wreck who is considering burning his nephew to obtain the lord of lights favor"

"Hodors Shlong",2013-04-29,"my problem with the fetuses wasnt even that they were too much but that they just seemed out of place they seemed way too science fictiony for this show or at least this scene i could maybe see a set piece like that being in qyburns chambers"

"Eric Xayavong",2013-04-29,"i never saw a passion in book stannis when it came to claiming the throne he just felt it was the right thing to dohe displays quite a bit of lust and ambition in the show except for this episode it was nice to see him as a family man i do feel he displayed enough affection for the viewers by just strongly insisting to see his daughter he cant show it to her but we know he wants to and doesnt know howwas selyse crazy in the books i just thought she was a snob it was actually really comical and although i enjoyed it i hope it doesnt ruin it for others stannis had the most hilarious look as soon as he knew he was off the hook kind of like lolol my wife is nutsi also loved these lines with shireenmother said you were in a battlestannis gives a look damn womandid you winsits down shuffling eye contactraises eye brows and looks down no"
"Mammothsbane",2013-04-29,"i think shireen is the key to getting stannis out of the queens men stance that he has taken in the tv series in the book stannis is in the middle with kings men davos and queens men the florents in the show without the florents up till now stannis has been the queens men while davos is still the kings man i think shireen is going to pull stannis back to the kings men side culminating with the nonsacrifice and decision to go north the main problem ive found with stannis in the show is that he made davos his hand too early once davos is made his hand stannis gets a lot more exposition and shows more death its when he makes some of his best speeches and was really the point where stannis won me over the we will make new lords brother or my king and no gods so cruel speeches he makes solidify himself as a dutiful man and make him look much less fanatical the show lacks this depth and characterization hopefully we will still get those speeches and stannis will start to pull out from under melisandres thumb this episode wasnt too bad with stannis although he is still defending davos in the dungeon that is another problem the show has created in the books the florents imprison davos and stannis releases him later in the show stannis imprisoned him and  is going to release him later or something who knows"
"mteague26",2013-04-29,"ok wait i really think yall need to rewatch that scene again if feels more like duty and obligation that brings stannis to visit his daughter it is very clear that when shireen runs to hug him he does not embrace her back his conversation with her is very stiff and he just gets up and walks out without a word this is how i view his character in the books as well which is why i just cannot like the man his protection of the wall was very badass and admirable i will give him that but other than that hes boring"

"Ser Pounce FTW",2013-04-30,"i thought that was kind of stanniss whole thing thats how dutiful he is he holds duty responsibility and justice above even his own family hell do what he thinks he has to do no matter how much he hates it it makes him seem hypocritical but i think its more of a weirdly compulsive desire to do the dutiful thingi never really thought he does these things for the throne itself he thinks he is the king he does it because they arent doing their duties by following he is the king you serve the king if you dont you are punished that seems to be stannis whole moat this point stannis needs the fight for the throne or he has nothing in his life he will call it duty he will call it his right he will call it unwanted but he will not stop calling it or he will have a breakdown that i doubt he could recover from the fight for the throne gives his life a purpose he never was able to achieve before and he believes winning it will make him respected and important since he feels hes been treated poorly all his lifethe show has shireen giving stannis a more human face but it doesnt redeem his most serious crime self delusion"
"bobbybuilderton",2013-04-30,"a perfect example of how its not so much hypocrisywas that the sarcasm as it is his ridiculous adherence to duty real or imagined is his enduring annoyance at being given dragonstone and not being made hand in his mind it was roberts duty to give him storms end as he was the elder in his mind it was roberts duty to look to his family for the responsibility of hand not his best friend he cares more about people doing what is expected of them than if its a nice thing to do he believes its expected of him to sit the throne and so he will try to sit it regardless of if he wants to or not his confession to his wife this episode shows that too he didnt have to say anything to her and for as crazy as she is he probably didnt want to but its not about what he wants his conscience tells him its his duty to confess to her and he puts up with her weird fetus jars to do it"

"ShigellaSand",2013-05-01,"i would say stannis going after the throne is more like jon infiltrating the wildlings its not something he wants to do but its his duty and if that involves killing people qhorin halfhandrenly then its something you have to do book stannis certainly didnt want to kill his only remaining brother but he felt he had to ive missed that in tv stannis  youve pretty much had to be a book reader to pick up on those few hints theyve given to that side of his character  but i think things are moving in that direction now and i like itstannis is all about doing the right thing not the popular thing or the smart thing or the kind and merciful thing  the right thing according to law and tradition what the rules say you should do"

"Lord Varys",2013-05-02,"the problem with selyses depiction in the show is that her love for her daughter seems to be her one of redeeming quality since she dont has her mustache in the show and im not sure that it was a good decision to cut it in twow selyse is most certainly going to declare her daughter queen regnant of westeros perhaps selyses feelings are going to change on that subject in the show since they introduced shireen my guess is that stannis is going to declare her to be his heir in front of the publichis court this could be a touching moment since women seem to have more trouble inheriting a royal seat in the show than in the books in the book shireen is stannis acknowledged and lawful heir until he fathers a legitimate son in the show the fact that she is kept hidden and pretty much never mentioned may indicate that her status is not as welldefined as in the book shireen may also be the one who causes stannis to free davos and name him his hand instead of burning him both she and selyse are going to accompany stannis to the wall which seems to be something that this reclusive version of selyse might never consent to do book selyse has a rather loud voice in her husbands councils and my guess is that tv selyse is going to develop into a more outgoing person in the show as well selyse most likely will argue in favor of mels sacrifice idea perhaps believing that this will somehow help her giving birth to a son with davos and shireen opposing the idea although shireen most likely wont be told about the sacrifice stuff  shell just grow fond of gendry"

"StannisandDaeny",2013-05-08,"he fears he wont do his duty if it somehow turns out to be his duty to defend the realm of men the importance of doing his duty and the fear of not doing it is great enough in him to rather take the risk it might be wrong than take the risk he wont do his duty and yes people often forget that from stannis point of view melisandre is much more impressive than from most readers point of view"

"ShigellaSand",2013-04-29,"i think margaery is using and playing sansa every bit as much as she is joffrey  but i think she likes sansa a great deal more i do believe that margaery would like sansa to be happy shes just not willing to sacrifice any advantage to herself and her family over it she probably feels shes doing sansa a favor anyway so whats the harm she strikes me as the kind of person whos very good at justifying things to herself"
"sansatyrell",2013-04-29,"yeah i agree with everything thats been said its clear she actually cares about sansa the actresses who play them have said that margaery and sansa would be truly close friends if theyd met under different circumstances i really love margaerys involvement so far and im interested to see if she plays any role in the upcoming sansatyrion events"

"Spidey",2013-04-30,"dead babies are dead you cant use them for magic since there is no life to sacrifice so no gendry will be the one but he might not die most likely it will seem like hes going to die but he will end up just getting leechedwhat would be the point of that if they opt for the leeches they couldve just used stannis blood in the first placei think thoros will convince mel that she doesnt need to sacrifice gendry then mel goes back and burns the fetuses"
"Raion Laion",2013-04-30,"i think i am the only one so far who really loved the fetus roomyoure not alone"
"Joyful Union",2013-04-30,"i think i am the only one so far who really loved the fetus roomi do as well im not sure what the issue is here as far as i can see its a memorable prop that will ensure that selyse is remembered its creepy its haunting and its unique it was also very sorrowful particularly when selyse named each one its supposed to be distasteful but also intriguing and it certainly is effective in both those cases"
"Kobayashi Maru",2013-04-30,"also its strong contrast to see how she named her dead babies and cares more about them then she does about her living daughter"
"cybobbie",2013-04-30,"i get why they used the babies and after reading the interview with bryan it was more than clear but despite the reasons i have to say that the scene creep me out i mean selyse is more sick in that scene that i ever pictured her in the books she and lysa are in the top of the list as sicked minded imo however to think that they can use the babies as a sacrifice i guess that burning them could be as much a sacrifice as burning the leeches is going to be a huge shocking scene i dont know if they will consider it but its a possibility"
"Envie",2013-04-30,"its not so much a big deal they showed dead babies in jars thats just creepy drama that showed how nutty selyse is  but what bothers me are all the theories that those babies are going to be the convenient and much more dramatic replacements for the leeches in the book for one its not really believable that the blood in the long dead babies is even viable for magical use and for two theyve left out most of the details of why stannis is so weak from the blood letting and demon baby making and so its confusing and non book readers may not really be following whats going on there maybe they feel the need to bash viewers over the head with macabre stuff like burning dead babies i dunno ugh and yes there were plenty of gruesome things described in the books too im just disinclined to feel the addition of dead babies in jars was really necessary to convey what the actress herself did well enough in the scene ill admit i thought they were cool looking and creepy i like creepy stuff look at my avatar  i just dont buy the theory of them being powerful magic ingredients then again varys had his junk used for powerful magic too haha"
"A Man Has Said",2013-04-30,"have you considered that this might be because neither renly nor loras are pov charactersbackgroundfontcoloroh never mind this explains your previous comment quite wellnoim not being homophobic at all youre jumping to a conclusionive got no problem with there being a lot of gays in the uks entertainment industry i thought doctor who was at its peak when russell t davis was in charge and i liked torchwood even better and i dont have a problem generally with gay characters on screen im straight but not narrowwatch the review of the episode by elio and linda and theyre quite upset about the scene in question it is a gratuitous insertion into the show of something that never even comes close to happening in the books it does nothing to develop either the characters or the narrative in fact it slanders loras in the context of his gay relationship with renly and how deeply he felt about the man so im just trying to explain why its there even though it goes against the overall story logic"
"Robb_Starkers",2013-04-30,"uhm shadow babythe jar babies really arent that bizarre compared to a lot of stuff that happens or will happen in the show i really dont know whats the big deal heremaybe bizarre was not the most appropriate word i meant that it is far removed from anything in the book of course a lot of things in the story are bizarre its a fantasy world but the producers must have read the book liked it and thoughtyou know what this is missing foetus jarswhat i meant was if you asked 100 people to write a list of things they thought would have been changed from the book not one person would have wrote down jars of foetus ask a million people still no that is my point i apologise if i did not articulate it well"

"Lord Varys",2013-05-10,"if the babes are going to fulfill the role of the leeches cogman would not tell us that they before the episode in question airs the thing may have started as weird idea but i honestly doubt that they would explore selyses stillborn sons and show us their remains if this whole thing is not going to become a plot point so my guess is that cogmans weird idea evolved and now the stillborns are going to replace the leeches"
"Woel",2013-05-10,"this is another great example of something people wouldnt have a problem with if it had been in the books but because its not they freak out someone mentioned the scene in the books where jaime has sex with cersei midperiod next to their sons dead body as a counterpoint to the baby jars i can only imagine the outrage if that hadnt been in the book but appears in the showvery good comparison that scene jaime and cersei was pretty disturbing in the books i actually hope it isnt included in the tv show to be honestbesides in the book they have time to tell us about selyse and all her childlessness and the miserable marriage between herself and stannis in the show they dont have the time to tell us instead they show us that one scene with the babies in the jar tells us a ton about selyse all without saying a word we now know something about her history her emotional state perhaps something about the state of her relationships with other people in her family because if shes that obsessed with the jars chances are shes not very emotionally involved with anyone else etci thought it was a very effective device it uses the visual aspect of television in a nice way to do some storytelling that otherwise would have required many more wordsgood points you successfully changed my opinion on this"

"freetickles",2013-04-29,"i think some people are giving this scene way too much credit and are going out of their way to defend it for some reasondoes it really make any sense that loras would tell a complete stranger about his familys secret plansas i said above ive never thought of loras as a player of the game the way his grandmother and sister are i dont think he grasps how important the secret of his engagement is or that the lannisters would try to foil it and i think in part out of arrogance he trusts that this squire legitimately is into his show"
"Dove",2013-04-29,"loras is brash arrogant and hotheaded clever but not clever enough to be a playa of the game besides that and his romanticism thats pretty much all there is to him in the books theres not much character to assassinate we never really got to see if he carried himself all that differently with potential lovers or anything like that so crying character assassination is a bit much just admit that you dont like the sceneit doesnt match your personal view of the character  and this is coming from someone who didnt like the scene as well"
"Sun",2013-04-29,"jaime makes a big deal about how brienne felt for renly earlier in this season thats a contrastetalike i said wouldnt complain if there had been a sense that renly had happened and that loras wasnt such an idiotthe operative word here is earlier lately weve been seeing a shift in brienne and in this ep we saw him get a rise out of her not because of renly but because he slighted her in earlier episodes jaime wasnt able to get a rise out of her by disparaging her skills as a knight he wasnt able to shake her confidence in this ep he succeeded not because his quip was any sharper than anything he had lobbed at her i the past but because now she cares about what he thinks of her his words had an effect because shes starting to care about his good opinionthere is no contrast in fact i see more of a correlation in the shows treatment of brienne and loras i say the show is drawing them both as characters beginning to see their way through the pain of their losssee above note i dont think anyone would complain if there was any sense of lorass pain in the midst of this attempt at a rebound or whatever but its not there theres no continuityit would be nice to see loras react to the mention of renly perhaps in the coming weeks edited by sun 29 april 2013  0503 pm"

"HouseLark",2013-04-29,"hard to say how this will play out in future episodes i viewed at as a grief fuck which is definitely not unusual either way loras was never an interesting character to me hes just a classic blowhard knight everything he does outside of renly is utterly predictable the only interesting thing about him is his homosexuality which is a bit unexpected for that type of character there were always going to be shortcuts in this adaptation and using loras as a plot tunnel is a reasonable change so character assassination yeah i suppose it is but its the assassination of a midranking bureaucrat rather than the president"

"flyerhawk",2013-04-29,"wow i really need to reread the books because my memory of loras was that he was a teenaged vain beautiful boy who was very good at jousting who also was gay and loved renley that pretty much sums up the entirety of loras from the books for me he was never political but some of you think it is simply beyond reason that such a boy would hop in the sack with someone else regardless of sexual orientation and given the fact that he was gay you dont think he would talk to some random squire he just banged about the girl that his family is setting him up to marry thankfully neither the books or the show make all of their characters polticial manipulators in the show it was fairly obvious that olenna and margaery told loras he should marry sansa if loras is willing to be a pawn in the game like that then he probably isnt a player"

"Lord Martin Sheol",2013-04-29,"i do agree with the character assasination idea heres the deal it may not come to notice to those who havent read the books but even if hes not a major player he does have its relevance the quote of the cande doesnt takes place months ago it takes place a couple of weeks ago at a maximum dont forget that hes a kingsguards he did made a vow of celibacy and maybe for our world that doesnt mean much or is considered impossible but for a medieval world such as that one in that culture it was common an known oathbreakers had a hard time in our context what loras did was rather normal or expected so for the average viewer that was enterily normal but in asoiaf context that was rather unthinkable not to mention the looseness of his tongue in our society we dont hold a real value on love as were proving even to say that having sex with someone you dont love doesnt hurt the relationship with the one you love and that it means nothing we seem to value sex well sex sells producers know that another thing it does kind of falls into the stereotype of gay man to jump into the first they get a chance to im not even in favor of homosexuality but im also against degrading people and i find that stereotyping degrading this issue was indeed a consequence of things going so fast in order to bring the tyrells plot to the lannisters but im really not happy at all with the outcome edited by marti n coronel 29 april 2013  0802 pm"

"teemo",2013-04-29,"i hate it when people write get over it its so rude and immature its hard for me to classify it as character assassination because we never had a loras or even tyrell pov but its a little disconcerting that loras hasnt appeared devastated over renlys death since it happened and the first time he really gets some spotlight again is him having sex with a random dude very nonchalantly and talking about who hes supposed to marrynow if there was some kind of sadness leading up to it or a reminder more recently of loras feelings for renly then i would be more understanding but that was a huge part of loras character but ill give it some timemaybe within the next couple of weeks loras will have some kind of convo about renly or love to someone who knows"

"Words of Winter",2013-04-29,"in general i think most sex scenes take away from the story there are exceptions the early jamiecersei was necessary though not too graphic thankfully the ygrittejon scene was essential to the his character development although it wasnt built up well in the tv series the renlyloras scene was necessary in the tv series and could have done better this one was not although i may not go so far as to say this was character assassintion i would say this was extremely divergent from the books weakened the character of the tv loras and was poorly executedthere was no emotion other than lust in the scene loras loved renly when he was killed he sought vengence changed allegiances and fought with the lannisters instead of against them he was in pain the book loras and the tv loras were in pain there was no regret in this scene just bom chicka wow wow thank you man oh and im gonna marry sansa stark now come get your man you stud i could envision a scene where they are sitting clothed or 1 with his shirt off the other guy unbuttoning loras shirt kissing on the bed much like the renlymargery scene where he then he pulls away saying i cant i    i love renly i still do  i want to i just cant not now then the other guy says something like so you loved him and loras replies yes i would have done anything for him pause under his breath when the sun goes down no candle can replace it silence he gets up goes to get a cup of wine softly laughs under his breath and says and if this isnt bad enough im being forced to marry a shewolf then he chugs the winealso in the world of the tv series or the book series i have difficult time believing a highborn knight who is secretly gay although widely understood as such would jump into bed with a commoner he has never seen some squire who turns out to be a malewhore comes up says hey man i like how you handle your sword wanna see my lance even if he wasnt grieving he would have the guy killed for insulting him or at the very lease would not literally just go jump in the bed with him i understand lust but much as many may not like it a double standard exists in this world and i assume theirs too he would be judicious in his escapades"

"LuisDantas",2013-04-29,"most nonpov characters suffered some degree of adaptation just because loras made the suncandle comment once it does not mean that he is above being a sexual being  particularly given that he has not taken kingsguard vows in kings landing yet it may grow but it is a minor deviation from his character in the books as of now arguably no deviation at all even jaime catelyn jon stannis davos and arguably sansa margaery selyse shireen and bronn have all been through far more significant changes"
"Prince of Dragonstone",2013-04-29,"like i said in another thread its pretty naive of us to think that loras didnt sheath his sword in anyone else after renlys death just because grrm didnt write a scene in the books expressing this didnt mean it couldnt have happened hes a young redblooded male its much more unrealistic that he would become a chaste monk at his age and with his supposed legendary beauty"

"Lord Varys",2013-04-30,"the problem with the depiction of loras in the show is not just the candle quote although thats very enlightening there is also the fact that book loras slew two of his fellow rainbowguards because they failed to protect renly and he personally buried renly all by himself at a secret place near storms end where they often went when loras served as renlys squire at storms end all those events signify how devoted loras was to renly even beyond death loras may be homosexual and young in the books but he does not seem to be the type who looses all of his wits when he sees a nice face granted loras is not the smartest guy under the sun but he is not stupid no one says that loras is intended to remain celibate all his life but its obvious in the book that he still mourns renly during asos and is not intending to enter into another relationship let alone to entertain himself with meaningless sex  thats not the kind of thing you usually do when you mourn a dead lover as to the whole kingsguard thing it makes no sense to take a kingsguard vow as seriously as some people seem to do here loras has already sworn a kingsguard vow before he enters joffreys kingsguard he was lord commander of renlys rainbow guardkingsguard and this did not prevent him from continuing his relationship to renly in fact it was the best way for these two to continue said relationship entering joffs kingsguard was only fitting after the tyrells switched to the other king because loras could not honorably return to prekingsguardrainbowguard life and this whole stupid change to make loras heir to highgarden makes no sense whatsoever because by joining renlys kingsguard in the show and marrying margaery to renly the tyrells obviously lost both of maces children to court life this makes them utterly stupid lets hope that garlan andor willas remain as younger siblings to margaery and mace the only reason i can come up with for this travesty of character depiction is that they obviously wanted to make sansa appear less stupid they kept yet another talk with sansa and littlefinger in the show just to show the audience that sansa is not as stupid as to tell littlefinger why she does not want to leave the capital this could have been done much better they really should have introduced us to the tyrell match much earlier then they could have given us sansas rejection of littlefingers offer much sooner which in turn could have enabled them to show us littlefingers motivation to investigate the reason behind sansas sudden change of heart instead he is only brought into this through cersei it completely destroys the core of this whole plot littlefinger is the one who orchestrates the sansatyrion marriage to get what he wants not other way around"

"Winter's Knight",2013-04-30,"1 who cares about loras character is rather a silly question especially when youre talking to a bunch of folks who have made it clear that they care 2 the complaint is not just that he slept with a random squire but that he did so with a callow ness that doesnt chime well with his devotion to renly and it wasnt just a oneoff he specifically mentions to oliver that theyll need to keep future meetings a secret from his wife edited by winters knight 30 april 2013  0620 am"

"Hodors Shlong",2013-04-30,"eh in my opinion i dont think loras is a big enough character in the books or show to have really assassinated hes a minor character at best and remains in the background most of the time yes he shows a more commited and resolute devotion to renly in the books and theres that one line about the sun and candles to back it up but tv loras isnt the same as book loras and one line from the books that may or may not have been made slightly irrelevant in the tv show doesnt really equal character assassination in my opinion and besides this is one scene from the fifth episode how do we know that hes not going to have some reflective moment about renly next week of whenever hes told he has to marry again what if he shares an intimate moment with margary about the struggles of trying to move on and not being able to let go of his true love and i dont really see this as promiscuous or slutty at all hes a strapping young 17 year old lad he lost his lover but not his libido and againhow do we know hes not trying to move on how do we know hes not still hurting over renly hell since margary has been seen being manipulative and calculating this season ive heard more than a few nonreaders speculate that loras may have been manipulating renly the show despite what a couple thousand of us book readers may think is written for the millions of nonreaders out there i dont think those people are really concerned with one trait from the books of a minor character that again may or may not have been altered at this point"
"Zar Lannister",2013-04-30,"but this isnt the books were discussing its the show which is a different related story it doesnt have to be consistent with the books it has to be consistent with itselfoh i thought the optopic title inferred a comparison between both am i missing somethingmost nonpov characters suffered some degree of adaptation just because loras made the suncandle comment once it does not mean that he is above being a sexual being  particularly given that he has not taken kingsguard vows in kings landing yetit may grow but it is a minor deviation from his character in the books as of now arguably no deviation at all even jaime catelyn jon stannis davos and arguably sansa margaery selyse shireen and bronn have all been through far more significant changesmostly the show has evolved some characters by merging some of them switching traits around or adapting ones with less participation my safest bet is that in part its the shows practical approach to reducing payroll and condensing things for viewers these changes demand the bigger switches in some storylines"
"Winter's Knight",2013-04-30,"seriously loras is no more a minor character than margery or gendry he ranks with bronn at the lowest"
"The Bear",2013-04-30,"i agree loras was shallow but likeable character in the book his major redeeming quality was his love and devotion for renly i got a feeling from the books that he stayed faithful to renly long after renlys death and was not playing around he seemed more obsessed with glory and glorious death in battle than random flingsalso it seemed that they used loras as blabbermouth in order to make sansa look better than she is in the books she is the one who blabbs to dantos about tyrells plot to marry her off  and he reports directly to lf here she never tells anyone same as in first season where she brought neds letter to cersei in show she never didi totally agree with all of this i really resent the stereotype of gay men in that scene instantly jumping into bed casual sex but since so many hetero characters are stereotypical lotharios it isnt really egregious i was more bothered that in the book it seemed like loras wanted to avoid marriage and even other partners and focus on honour and glory instead so he took up with the kingsguard it seemed a strong deviation from his book self loras is kind of shallow in the books but hes even moreso in the show would have loved him to have a moment of hesitation before or seen guilt afterwards some kind of hint that he still loves and misses renly i loved their relationship because it was healthy apart from having to hide it mutually satisfying and obviously loving especially by westerosi standards and this does undermine it somewhat imo"

"Rockroi",2013-04-30,"when i contemplated this topic i was committed to writing something along the lines of loras was just screwing around it didnt mean anything hes a young man and has needs etc i will say that some of the things that people have said are making me question that assessment for starters i am not sure that if loras were say a female character who lost a male lover or a heterosexual man who lost a female lover and jumped back into bed with the first lover he could if i would buy it it does as ran puts it seem very lazy very we are here and we need to get there so lets take this shortcut i think that loras homosexuality is being used as a shorthand for promiscuity but1 maybe hes over it loras in the book is clearly and honestly very hurt over renlys death and he cannot get over it and that fits very well however isnt it possible that loras in the show is more  shallow isnt it possible that loras mourned renly and moved past it perhaps loras accepts that his universe is a deadly one and that men die and you have to accept that maybe loras knew all along that renly could die and that he is at peace with thatcounter dont buy it for starters loras seems motivated by his anger over renlys death he is actually angry at stannis in the scene with lf over renlys corpse when he storms the throne room and removes his helmet the look loras gives is ragefilled satisfaction and pride second loras does not appear shallow to me from his caring for renly for pretty complicated reasons to his knowledge from season 1 that the hound saved his life and gives the hound the accolades of the crowd loras to me appears deep 2 in it to win it we all agree that margery did not care for renly she cares for power she did not crave sex she craves to be queen joff tommen renly  if she could marry balon greyjoy she would if she thought it would get her on the throne faster isnt it possible that this reimagined loras was also around renly merely because he was trying to gain the power that would be available to him and his family if he could force renly to rebel against joff discard stannis and storm kl loras pride perhaps is not with avenging renlys death but with continuing the push to get the tyrells on the iron throne ambition may not just be limited to mace olenna and margery perhaps loras wants his family to be powerful and renly was a stepping stone to that end and does anyone really mourn a stepping stone counter does not ring true first loras was not just gladtalking renly i honestly felt in the 12 discussions we caught that loras believed that renly was a better man than robert and stannis i think loras respected renly enough to wear his armor into battle i think loras had to get renly to see what loras saw  a kind decent intelligent man who would be a fair and honest ruler second i dont think loras was blind or immune to renlys charm after all for a gay man renly was quite the motherfucking catch why would loras feel the need to fake it with renly the way margery did 3 its just sex people of all the denouncements of loras actions one that does not ring with me is the idea that while you are in mourning you cannot have sex well being gay up until very very recently and even then only in certain isolated parts of the world is a hard fucking life who knows how or when you will be able to find another man who you can be with loras like tyrion and others may not put a high premium on sex and see it as just a physical experience this would not be unlike the way many men  gay and straight  act in all sorts of situations much like elliot spitzer who slept with prostitutes thus destroying his political career and almost his marriage perhaps loras does not want to become entangled in emotional entanglements especially after renlys death he does not want to meet the next man who he can sweep of his feet he wants to just have some sex and then pick his sword back up and get back to his life i mean maybe it is that after renly all the other boys in the yard are just candles and loras is only looking for a few brief flickers and not a bonfire and sex is fun and sometimes a guy just wants to have fun counter of all the theories this one is on the surest footing  its both real and sensitive to loras as a whole person because so long as sex in this instance is just for physical pleasure it maintains loras relationship with renly butif there is one truth about martins universe is that sex is usually very important and the showrunners carry this thought onward jaimecersei is the reason we are all here jon and sam are haunted by their oaths when they have sex stannis sex gets him a shadow assassin roberts sexual excess is a sign of his failings both as a king and as a man sex matters here in that case its hard to simply brush aside a sexual act because in this world sex carries great weight because the writers say so not because of any westosti morals or customs in that regard if sex matters well its all the tougher to make loras sexcapade seem benign to me i think it teeters on the line between lazy writing and showing loras as a complete man gay or straight  who looks to sexual contact as a means of escape loras clearly does not treat the squire the same way he treated renly at the same time it does smack of the stereotype that gay men just want sexthen again how is that any different than the stereotype of straight men all in all to me its a close call and i am willing to give the show the benefit of the doubt and say that loras sexual encounter with the squire was purely for physical fun and that loras deserves to have that encounter because he is still very upset over renly but its close"

are all here jon and sam are haunted by their oaths when they have sex stannis sex gets him a shadow assassin roberts sexual excess is a sign of his failings both as a king and as a man sex matters here in that case its hard to simply brush aside a sexual act because in this world sex carries great weight because the writers say so not because of any westosti morals or customs in that regard if sex matters well its all the tougher to make loras sexcapade seem benign to me i think it teeters on the line between lazy writing and showing loras as a complete man gay or straight  who looks to sexual contact as a means of escape loras clearly does not treat the squire the same way he treated renly at the same time it does smack of the stereotype that gay men just want sexthen again how is that any different than the stereotype of straight men all in all to me its a close call and i am willing to give the show the benefit of the doubt and say that loras sexual encounter with the squire was purely for physical fun and that loras deserves to have that encounter because he is still very upset over renly but its closei love the way you set out your posts edited by dragonstoned 30 april

"juanml82",2013-04-30,"3 its just sex people of all the denouncements of loras actions one that does not ring with me is the idea that while you are in mourning you cannot have sex well being gay up until very very recently and even then only in certain isolated parts of the world is a hard fucking life who knows how or when you will be able to find another man who you can be with loras like tyrion and others may not put a high premium on sex and see it as just a physical experience this would not be unlike the way many men  gay and straight  act in all sorts of situations much like elliot spitzer who slept with prostitutes thus destroying his political career and almost his marriage perhaps loras does not want to become entangled in emotional entanglements especially after renlys death he does not want to meet the next man who he can sweep of his feet he wants to just have some sex and then pick his sword back up and get back to his life i mean maybe it is that after renly all the other boys in the yard are just candles and loras is only looking for a few brief flickers and not a bonfire and sex is fun and sometimes a guy just wants to have funcounter of all the theories this one is on the surest footing  its both real and sensitive to loras as a whole person because so long as sex in this instance is just for physical pleasure it maintains loras relationship with renly butif there is one truth about martins universe is that sex is usually very important and the showrunners carry this thought onward jaimecersei is the reason we are all here jon and sam are haunted by their oaths when they have sex stannis sex gets him a shadow assassin roberts sexual excess is a sign of his failings both as a king and as a man sex matters here in that case its hard to simply brush aside a sexual act because in this world sex carries great weight because the writers say so not because of any westosti morals or customs in that regard if sex matters well its all the tougher to make loras sexcapade seem benignto me i think it teeters on the line between lazy writing and showing loras as a complete man gay or straight  who looks to sexual contact as a means of escape loras clearly does not treat the squire the same way he treated renly at the same time it does smack of the stereotype that gay men just want sexthen again how is that any different than the stereotype of straight menall in all to me its a close call and i am willing to give the show the benefit of the doubt and say that loras sexual encounter with the squire was purely for physical fun and that loras deserves to have that encounter because he is still very upset over renlybut its closeas in real life there is meaningful sex and meaningless sportlike sex sticking to the show theon having sex with the ships captains daughter on the way to pyke is meaningless at least for him all of tyrions sex before shae is meaningless dokhrathi having sex during dannys wedding is meaningless bronn having sex with hookers is meaninglessif anything the only stererotype at play here is that women dont have casual meaningless sex unless they are whores people are sometimes too sensitive about gay men having sex without love nor commitment"

"Lord Godric",2013-04-30,"the essence of loras remains true though people seem to think he was defined by his romance with renly since his alleged forgetting of the dead baratheon is causing so much controversy of course hes not defined by that romance though just as no one is defined by any romance both book loras and show loras are impulsive they are arrogant they are naive but they are also both great knights and warriors who work diligently to improve themselves they are both dedicated to their family and would do anything for their sister in this show loras has not been erased or changed to the core simply because of how his onscreen reaction to renlys death differs from what we are shown in the bookin the book loras is defined by being an excellent knight and then later by his love of renly theres not that much more to it than that by showing that he may never have cared about renly and doesnt mourn his death at all it drastically changes his character yes this is an adaptation but i dont think this is even a change that works for the adaptation it was part of a lazy threepart scene to get littlefinger to find out about the tyrells arrangement when there were so many better ways to do it i am no purist by any means but i think the changes they make need to work and not be sloppy and this one was horribly sloppy and in the process they changed loras character past the point of no return"

"Lord Varys",2013-05-02,"in the show renly has no rainbow guard just the kingsguard and his kingsguard obviously has the same rules as joffreys kingsguard which means that loras was no longer the heir to highgarden after he became lord commander of renlys kingsguard renly did steal both of mace tyrells heirs away when he crowned himself which is why the decision to make loras heir to highgarden makes no sense whatsoever especially since this makes the whole tyrell family look like complete morons according to olenna she was not particularly happy with this whole renly idea but can anyone see olenna letting maces stupid plans put the line of succession of highgarden in danger she would have poisoned mace herself before allowing him to deliver his only two children to renly baratheon but i cant even mace see trying to pull off something this stupid the competence of the tyrells in the political field is best shown in the fact that they do not actually put the elder sons of mace tyrell in danger another problem is that the writers actually go along with tywins problematic decision to consider jaime his heir despite the fact that he took a vow to forfeit all his rights loras would have done the same and it would make no sense to assume that his vows just died together with renly selmy did not leave the kingsguard when aerys died and the targaryen dynasty was dethroned despite the fact that one could make a huge difference between the targaryen and the baratheon kingsguard if its a huge issue that jaime cant inherit and cant leave the kingsguard despite tywin being the de facto ruler of the realm how can it make sense that loras quietly resigns from the kingsguard and is renamed heir to highgarden both the marriage between sansa and loras and loras and cersei and the fact that loras tyrell is heir to highgarden are highly problematic"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-05-02,"another problem is that the writers actually go along with tywins problematic decision to consider jaime his heir despite the fact that he took a vow to forfeit all his rights loras would have done the same and it would make no sense to assume that his vows just died together with renly selmy did not leave the kingsguard when aerys died and the targaryen dynasty was dethroned despite the fact that one could make a huge difference between the targaryen and the baratheon kingsguardthere is a difference between being the heir and not being able to inherit as a member of the kingsguard jaime is tywins heir but if he is still a member of the kingsguard at the time of tywins death he would be unable to inherit tywin even in the books insists that jaime is his heir and wants him to quit if jaime wanted out and the king was agreeable i see no reason why that would somehow be forbiddenand really the loss of his hand sort of illustrates the point it is entirely possible that a member or perhaps multiple members at the same time of the kingsguard who had lost a hands or legs would be offered release from his vows by the king and might accept if endorsed by the septon its one thing to carrry a geezer for a few years but quite another to keep a member or perhaps multiple members on for perhaps 40 years who cannot fightas for selmy robert offered him a position in his kingsguard and he accepted had he not been offered the position and not accepted i think theres a pretty good argument hed be able to inherit again it might require some mumbojumbo from the high septon but i think it is certainly within the realm of possibility he could have married etcid just like to add that i think it is somewhat unfair to jump to conclusions regarding inconsistencies or butchering a character based on a single episode most such things are possible to remedy and until it is clear that is not or cannot happen i think the writers deserve a chance to be judged on the character portrayal as a whole and not just as heshe is portrayed in a single episode same thing with plot points about kingsguard obligations etc give them time to get it all in over the course of a few episodes before conclusion theyve really screwed something up edited by former lord of winterfell 02 may 2013  1044 am"

"Broken Fox",2013-05-04,"yeah i was confused about this too that theme is the one used for theon and is basically the darker version of the what is dead may never die theme that was used in the last season so i was baffled to hear it reused either the composer was too lazy and just reused it because it was dramatic or whatever music he had done wasnt seen as adequate so they plucked it from season 2or they just thought it worked for the scene"
"Tori Targaryen",2013-05-04,"perhaps but it still comes down to laziness im sure an equally sufficient piece could have been created for it"
"Peptalk",2013-05-05,"to be honest i dont think that many people even thought about it being theons theme i didnt even make the connection myself until someone wrote about it here and ive seen the first two seasons twice i did however think upon hearing it that it was an awesome track for that scene edited by peptalk 05 may 2013  0529 am"

"SerGregori",2013-05-04,"im sad to not see patchface i always thought there was more to that character than we have seen so far but i guess if hes not been included in the show then thats probably not the case they may continue to have shireen sing his songs and in a way fill his role as a little bit of fan service but i cant see it being any more than that sadly"

"ShigellaSand",2013-04-29,"the list is back its done to keep her hatred of the hound fresh in out minds im guessing and to make it less of a shock when she leaves him to die later on my pet theory on the scene at the inn is that arya will lose it because hot pie is killed in front of her or she finds his corpse theyve shown her killing already  the stableboy at kl  so i dont think thatll stop them"

"Mark Mullendore's Monkey",2013-04-29,"the tickler dying was probably my biggest disappointment of season 2 being denied the is there gold in the village dialogue at the inn which is one of my favourite chapters of the series i think the scene will survive though but itll likely be more focused on arya getting needle back off of polliver someone in another thread suggested there may be some replacement dialogue based on pollivers murder of lommy can you walk etc i quite like that idea either that or she can scream her list in his face as she stabs the crap out of him"

"Impish",2013-04-29,"why is brienne in this scene not shown from the front sidemy interpretation of this is that usually when we are shown a nude woman onscreen its in a romanticsexual context she is generally offering herself to someone etcnot showing a frontal highlighted how strikingly different this particular encounter was the important visual is that she towers over jaime enraged quite literally her backs up the nudity is almost irrelevant a distraction a function of the bath house setting not the plot"
"bobbybuilderton",2013-04-29,"something that struck me seeing the scene visualized is how clean brienne looked and how absolutely horrible jaime looked it was almost a physical representation of what is inside them with them being in a bathhouse and confession in the christian tradition being associated with cleansing im a bit disappointed the metaphor went over my head on the read through"

"NickyM",2013-04-30,"i disagree the whole point of that shot was for us to see jaimes reaction to her we as the audience are meant to conclude that brienne is attractive because jaime was obviously taken by her physicality jaimes attraction to brienne at that moment was purely physical but it was also influenced by his respect admiration and trust in her its also influenced by his vulnerability at that momentbrienne is not an unequivocal beauty shes not supposed to be shes not cersie or marg or sansa had jaime seen her naked back in s1 she wouldnt have had any effect on him at this moment he is predesposed emotionally to finding her beautiful because he already admires her in so many other ways if they had shown us what he was seeing our opinions of her would have substituted his and that lust for beauty we saw in his eyes would have been diminished by whatever our eyes perceivedwe were meant to see brienne through jaimes eyes in that scene not our own we were meant to find her attractive because he does we were meant to feel for her what he feels with the glimpse of her beautiful muscular ass and his lusty face we were meant to lust for her as well when it comes to briennes beauty how jaime sees her is all that really mattersi think this is the most important part viewers are forced to imiagine what the directorwriter wants you to see you get all the info you need from jaimes face this way a viewer cant say shes not all that because jaimes reaction would disagree with that i loved what gwen had to say about the scene on ewcomduring the scene brienne responds to jaime berating her by angrily standing up in the water exposing herself<U+0080><U+009C>the moment of nudity is an act of defiance from brienne<U+0080><U+009D> christie explained <U+0080><U+009C>in that moment she realizes the power of her womanhood without the armor without the fighting without killing anyone while she<U+0080><U+0099>s opposite this man who she has such a complex relationship with he has saved her from being brutally raped and she still cannot understand him and he pushes her in that moment so when she stands up naked in front of him she<U+0080><U+0099>s angry she overcomes her own issues about her own femininity and vulnerably and gender and in that moment finds the power of not only what it means to be a woman but who she is as a woman it<U+0080><U+0099>s a really powerful moment<U+0080><U+009D>i also love the fact that its about her anger and not about sex for her which should be the only real reason save that moment for when they do finally get that moment or not at all"

"SeventySeven",2013-04-30,"re the dream i kind of agree with another poster that said it would be more impactful to have jaime deliberately choose to go back rather than deciding after a dream i liked the dream in the book but i think i would have liked it just as much if he went back just because he wanted to i cant imagine how are they going to justify him leaving brienne behind though at this point it would be a sht move to abandon her  even reading the book i though he was an ass for going without her iirc i think he assumed she was going to be ransomed or something and go back home but still"

"Ellypsis",2013-04-30,"first time post nervesever since i read the books jaime and brienne have been my favorite duo im not hugely concerned about whether or not a dream sequence would be too hokey because the showrunners have already proven that they can deliver one without having it come across cheesy or weird re bran theres a big difference between the book dream sequences and the tv sequences  theyve taken out what was a bit over the top talking crow teaching bran to fly while still attempting to deliver the message albeit with a bit more subtlety likewise i think they could pull off this dream in a way that would be more realistic and less mystical  make the nonreading viewers question how jaime arrived in kings landing so quickly the same way they questioned how bran was walking againi think jaimes line i dreamed of you is an important line because hes acknowledging to brienne and to himself that he has formed a bond with her the first real bond hes had with anyone other than his immediate family members  someone that he isnt obliged to care about the fact that he was honest about it when he could have made any number of cruel remarks shows his respect for her and seems like an attempt to earn some of her respect in return id be disappointed if it wasnt includedthen again they might cut out brienne asking the question altogether dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno "

"'96Buck",2013-05-01,"one thing that baffles me this season with jon is the incredibly small amount of screen time ygritte has gotten until this episode back in season 2 when they destroyed qhorin to give ygritte screen time the main defence was that it was to increase her development time to build up her romance with jon but then for the first half of this season she has like 5 lines they would have gotten the same amount of development had they followed the books and then just had a couple of ygritte scenes instead of prostitutes as it was their sex scene just came out of nowherehowever we as viewers know that she and jon have been together for longer than what weve seen as a result of the change we just get to see a highlight reel of their time together but we know they did have time together in an unrelated work many here are probably familiar with did luke learn everything from yoda in about 40 minutes no obviously not"

"EnergeticCrab",2013-05-01,"my issue with jon snow is that he is so introvertedi knew it was going to be an almost impossible task to give him a good adaptation because more than any other character especially at this point in the series everything important is in jons head and he has no one to talk a common theme of all shows is that there is someone major characters can confide in  whether its a best friend family themselves a psychiatrist a ghost whatever theres someone jon snow has no one he cant even tell ygritte whats really going on i know so many people who absolutely could not stand jon snow until they read the booksthey really fucked up jon last year with the idiotic and unmemorable tvhalfhand who didnt even make it clear enough that jon was on a mission to spy on the wildlings in the premiere my boyfriend said wow im surprised jon is really turning on the nw jon having no way to speak to anyone about his feelings is an issue but not one they can really address because who could he talk to if you read the books you know that jon is worried 247 about being an oathbreaker and that sleeping with ygritte was a serious moral dilemma for him in the show it didnt really come across like that at all the storyline with ygritte is rushed as hell butsome of their past choices with jon have put him in a miserable spot and im not sure how they can get him out of it right awayi agree with you 100 this really is the problem the lack of an overt thoughtprocess that we can relate to makes his decisions and dialog boring it doesnt help that harrington is kind of bland what gets me is the guy has read the books so he should theoretically know the character jon does have a ghost a missed opportunity for monologuesthis it would have been a little doofy but really this is like the only option jons story has been handled really badly so far the writing has been okay so i guess its a combination of kits terrible acting and not allocating the story enough screentimeyes the writing and timing are very much to blame the lack of scenes of jon interacting with the wildlings creates the necessity for stupid zippy oneliner type dialog which is not how jon thinks or communicates this model works better for jaime and tyrion which is why they are partially so popular the format of the show favors their characters and their delivery styles"

"AliKat",2013-05-01,"i think they should have shown the scene with jonmanceygritte where she says they slept together and then when she comes to him later basically telling him to put up or shut up it would then show that he had to sleep with her or give himself away and his reluctant could have shown how he wanted to honor his oaths then the cave scene could have shown that jons affections for ygritte was giving him problems with his oaths instead of making him look like he gave in to lust  like robb did  with very little reluctance other than him saying we shouldnt they didnt make it clear how much him not sleeping with her would have proven that he was betraying them not the nw i just wish they had shown his assimilation into the culture a bit more with tormund and mance show how tempting it was for jon to chose that way of life so when he doesnt and goes back to the nw  you see he really was an honorable man i dont think kit is doing a bad job with jon at all hes got his angsty part down pat and his scenes with sam ygritte  the lord commander were excellent he has a lot of chemistry with those actors though so that might be more of it than anything ive only seen kit in this and silent hill which isnt exactly a steller written movie so its hard to say on his acting in that role lol"

"TheDarkOne",2013-05-03,"one of the biggest failings of the show is to not show more graphic torture of theon so far we have seen very little if anything done to him perhaps they are saving the castration for the last few episodes but it definitely needs to be included and hopefully they will be brave enough to show it but perhaps from a suitable distance if you think of the scene where joff had the lads tongue removed i would see the same thing for theon ramsey and roose or whomever could be speaking and it the background you see ramseys men dejunk theon"

"PhoenixFlame",2013-05-03,"two big reasons they are showing theons torturedescent into reek  establish ramsay when joffers dies theyll need a good villain to take his place ramsay proves himself in adwd to be worse than joffrey but no one wants to wait that long since joff will be dead by early next season possibly this season but i dont think so sure there are plenty of villainous characters but dudes like roose and tywin are classy villains and littlefinger is a sneaky one its better to keep in a plain psycho for contrast also readers have seen him before this point hes introduced in what would be season 2 but his plotline got moved and streamlined to this season since it wouldve been too much for season 2  fill in theons absence in adwd theon remembers the tortures visited on him and we get disturbed in addition to the awfulness his present state the show doesnt use flashbacks or internal narration the book is able to show how he goes from theon to reek but it would be too much of a shift for tv as we arent in his head its better for viewers to see it  on a more technical side the actors need a block of time for contracts actors leaving the show for two seasons and returning as main characters are hard to swing because of their schedules plus his arc last season ended on way too much of a cliffhanger for him to disappear that long i dont think its wrong to find theons plotline compelling yes its gruesome and painful but the actors are really talented some people watch tv to be emotionally invested i like his storyline because its moving and has a lot of character development i dont think its going to be hmm what can we do to abuse theon every ep for two seasons"

"Ravi Seaworth",2013-05-03,"there is one important aspect about this which i am not sure if it had already been mentioned the books tell a story from points of view using this technique it is possible in the books to first demonstrate how broken reek is and slowly reveal his true identity as theon by recalling some of the gruesome torture acts performed by ramsay this is totally impossible to depict in tv furthermore they had to keep the actor during this season since he was an audience favorite therefore the only logical solution to this problem is to show all the torture he went through this storyline also helps to gradually build the boltons as villains they are rushing these scenes for the rw when i believe they will reveal ramsays identity edited by raviept 03 may 2013  0351 am"

"IceManCeaserKOTN",2013-05-03,"one of the biggest failings of the show is to not show more graphic torture of theon so far we have seen very little if anything done to himperhaps they are saving the castration for the last few episodes but it definitely needs to be included and hopefully they will be brave enough to show it but perhaps from a suitable distance if you think of the scene where joff had the lads tongue removed i would see the same thing for theonramsey and roose or whomever could be speaking and it the background you see ramseys men dejunk theonyikesanyways i have my own theories as to why its in the bookshow but thats for another day i dont think the people wanting torture scenes will be disappointed they skipped all the great stuff that builds ramsay as a villain before he captures theon and are solely using the torture to do it its pretty clear they want to show the torture stuff gets people talking about the show in a omg did you see what theyre doing to theon way lazy but effectivegiven my tastes i dont think i will ever enjoy this storyline even with looking for a deeper meaning but i understand why others could now well have to see theons story fully play out but a lot of my questions will be answered when we see if there is any true redemption for his character"

"Lady Arwen",2013-04-29,"lena plays cersei with nuance and skill i really enjoy her performance however she doesnt play cersei how i always interpreted her character ive had an extremely specific image of cerseis appearance demeanor and mannerismsi just imagine her to be a bit spicier and not always so composed and regal as lena portrays her still i think lena brings a lot of life to the character and im very comfortable with her portrayal of cersei"

"The Killer Snark",2013-04-30,"i hope that cersei does become more obviously unhinged by the time affc is adapted but headey is fine at adding credibility to roles that otherwise a different actress might have put on the verge of pantomime her performance in dredd is an example charlize theron was excellent in snow white and the huntsman deliciously ott but the performance worked for that movie since cersei is already an over the top character its probably best to play that down a bit to save her seeming like a pantomime dame in response of course to people who claim that she isnt cerseilike enough edited by the killer snark 30 april 2013  0314 am"

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-30,"its about damn time lena got an appreciation thread shes fantastic as cersei and her increased bitchiness in s3 is closer to the cersei in the books so that should keep purists happy i loved her anguished reaction to tywin ordering her to marry loras it felt like years of pain once again being brought to the forefront"

"bobbybuilderton",2013-04-30,"i assume that for the walk they will just have the septas making it clear she will have be completely naked then shell ask for shoes and theyll deny them and then for the actual walking the easiest way to do it i think would be to do one of those over the shoulder behind the back shots and a few shots of her facethat way we can still see her breaking down but we also get a good look at her power dissolving as we see the faces of the people realizing shes no better than they are"
"Ser Pounce FTW",2013-04-30,"looking back i did phrase it with exactly the wrong words i mean to say i really will enjoy the villains downfall even though its quite brutal part of the reason people are excited about lena specifically doing it i think is because they want to see a very real portrayal of cercei and up to now lena has been great at it even giving us sympathetic moments like her and tommen on the thronebut thats just one part of the story it has to be a nude walk because at the start of the walk we are all cheering finally she gets what she deserves but as the walk continues the enthusiasm dies down by the second stumblefall we are struggling with conflicted feelings over the devastating nature of this act and by the end we are completely sympathetic to the character for just having competed it it is needed just as it is written in order to change the audience as much as the character we dont need to zero in on her womanly parts but it must be explicitly shown that she is naked for all to see her and judge her if we are to see her in a new light by the end of the walk"

"ChromeWeasel",2013-05-02,"by your repeated comparison of this punishment to a drunken night out is it safe for me to assume you are male if that is a correct assumption then you really arent in a position to understand or judge how a woman will and does react to a situation like the wos it is not an easy thing for women to endure what cersei did again because you are male youve never witnessed girls forced to change for gym in a common room manage to remove their top and put on their gym shirt all without ever being completely exposed the body nudity and exposure are very very different for men and womennext in a society where women are only allowed to be wives and mothers their looks and youth are indeed all they have even the qot arguably one of the smarter people in the entire series must navigate carefully and never seem to be overtly in control but rather must show herself to be the ornery older matriarch rather than brains of the family and brienne who has dared to try something different is constantly having her looks discussed by herself as much as others the medieval world had very defined roles for women and what their strengths were and if im honest the modern world isnt as far removed as it should be when it comes to a womans youth or beautytheres a big difference between the shyness of an innocent unworldly 14 year old girl and a very sexually experienced 30 year old woman do you really think that cersei who has used sex as a weapon and a tradeable commodity for most of her life is comparable to a 14 year old virgin who has never seen another naked person before i think thats a pretty terrible comparison id use that comparison for sansa stark not cerseicersei is more like paris hilton or kim kardasian than she is like an innocent 14 year old virgin cersei has been around the block many times shes manipulated dozens of men managed a significant spy network through guile force sexuality and power hilton and kardasians exposure did them no harm at all they rolled with the punches and actually exploited their shaming to their own purposesthe bottom line is that cersei is about as far from innocent as a person can possibly be to sympathize with her as if shes a 14 year old innocent high schooler has nothing to do with my own gender im putting things far more into perspective to be quite honest you can assume that im a man or you could assume im a girl thats simply been on spring break before or you could stop worrying about my gender and simply deal with the realities of the character youre talking about a very experienced woman who is anything but naive and innocentalso i provided some realworld examples of actual torture some things which we should be very much aware that cersei through her agent qwyburn has actually inflicted on her own enemies she has literally condemned innocents to be tortured to death and qwyburn has selectively sought out female victims at her hand this is really the person you want to put in comparison of an innocent high school girl embarrassed at herself in a locker roomi understand being embarrassed about your body when you are a stupid and innocent kid i dont understand it when youre a full grown adult i guess its a credit to martin that hes able to reach some of his readers with this chapter but i dont see it as a good thing that people identify with cersei here readers are putting on some major blinders to cerseis character there edited by chromeweasel 02 may 2013  1017 am"
"ChromeWeasel",2013-05-02,"next in a society where women are only allowed to be wives and mothers their looks and youth are indeed all they haveone more point on this looks are indeed all that cersei has this is to her own discredit she was born literally into one of the most privileged situations in all of westeros but over the course of her life there is very little worthwhile about cersei other than her physical beauty i realize that its traumatic to her to have this fading and exposed but thats only because shes never taken any time to develop anything deeper than a nice body a pretty face and a decent spy networks of criminals i dont picture the walk of shame breaking margaery or the queen of thornes or dany or much of any other adult woman in the story because they all have something more to them than bitterness and jealousy wrapped in a pretty exterior its the fact that looks really are all cersei has that makes her so reprehensible"
"Theda Baratheon",2013-05-02,"the walk of shame is not a joke in terms of pnishment when it comes down to cersei think of her personality she is vain narcissistic proud this shatters all of those things so i think trivialising this is a pretty dumb thing to do youve read the books you know how much this sort of punishment affects cersei also as a woman i would not ever like to walk naked through a dangerous murderous dirty city whilst people shout obscenities at me and throw crap at me so for a queen like cersei this is unbearable"
"jons nissa",2013-05-02,"i dont understand it when youre a full grown adultthis is obvious so i will explain it to you a woman being forced to walk naked and shaved throughout a city is traumatic demeaning and humiliating for some it would be impossible to complete their age sexual experience or body awareness would not be factors for making such an act easier or harder this is a mental punishment that is meant to affect a persons personality for other women this walk might be possible but still would be extremely difficult to undertake im not sure why you think comparing modern celebrity women who have not been in this type of situation sorry but a sex tape is not comparable but no woman would be able to complete this walk and then brush it off as if nothing had happened thats where the gender question comes into play no woman would ever describe the wos to a drunken bet saying that is a clear indication that you dont understand sexual humiliation or psychological punishment in any case it had no affect on you and you believe cersei wasnt punished thats fine everyone is entitled to their own interpretation"

"Theda Baratheon",2013-05-02,"i think you have to be more empathetic yes she has committed atrocities yes she is an abhorrent person i truly truly agree with this this punishment to cersei is absolutely humiliating she is made to hate her body feel ashamed of it this is a proud lioness in her mind and they have shaved off her locks and made her walk naked through the streets i also think youre trivializing it a lot yes technically the military are there to defend her but there have been riots in the city recently and it doesnt stop people shouting horrible insulting words at her and throwing whatever yes i know to you this might seem like a joke because of all the evil she has done so you might not be sympathetic however in understanding the character it might be better to be empathetic because from cerseis point of view this is awful they have seen her naked they have seen she is just another aging woman and we know how much cersei hates women this stark contrast of hating herself shatters through all the vain narcissistic pride she has of herself this punishment really is a massive deal to cersei in some ways i think it has more of an affect on her than what possible other punishments would have this psychological punishment this shame is awful to her you really have to be empathetic and understand exactly how cersei feels about herself prior to this to truly understand the impact it can have you personally might not care about a punishment like this you are you male perhaps feel comfortable in your own body but can you really say walking through a dirty dangerous city with people shouting and throwing things at you would be easy i have a low pain tolerance but i would still prefer physical punishments to this baring myself to a whole city of people who hate me making me ashamed hating my body feeling exposed and terrified and ugly this would really really emotionally effect me for years this would scar me and i dont particularly have any pride in my body anyway so if cersei someone who has profound pride in being a lioness a beautiful and strong and proud queen likening herself to common people feeling exposed and ashamed is just harrowing"

"StannisandDaeny",2013-05-02,"i understand why its horrible to cersei but i dont sympathize with her because she deserves far worse and has inflicted far far worse things on countless others compared to the torture she let qyburn put on others the many mutilations committed at her command etc etc the walk was indeed a joke that said i wouldve preferred if they had just cut off her head and be done with it the punishment was after all inflicted for the wrong reasons and by the wrong person martin really has a way of not giving the reader what he wants in my case justice because the walk was hardly anything to cheer about at most it was another reason on the list 1000 reasons kings landing should be burned to the ground we may yet come to realize that king aerys was rightif it drives cersei to the point of madness shell command ungregor to gloriously rampage through kings landing killing tyrells left and right i will cheer about it however edited by stannisanddaeny 02 may 2013  0221 pm"

"Toxspecific",2013-04-25,"so if were talking about relatively minor scenes that are way underrated but seriously awesome ill say the hound vs beric dondarrion first of all because all asoiaf fights are awesome secondly this was the hound fighting beric who was by all means a good man with a flaming sword it was the hound facing his fears to fight fire and win i think this really showed him as a brave guy wish affc and adwd would have had more scenes like this"

"The Flaying Man",2013-04-26,"im positive that d and d came up with that scene theyve gone on record to state that stannis is a villain and weiss even said that stannis would make a terrible king which worries me a great deal on the direction theyll look to take stannis in the future i guess thats a drawback of adapting a series with such polarizing characterseveryone sees them differently and if the showrunners see him in a negative light then you can guarantee that hell be portrayed as a darker more villainous figureoh no whenwhere did they state all of this i had hoped stannis evil phase would pass"

"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-26,"a little pressed for time so ill keep it quick all that says to me is that dd simply dont care about the source material or about the book readers and they should especially when they go on about how passionate they are about the books theyre not even obliged to respect or connect to us but the least they could do is respect martin who has pretty much singlehandedly given them all this successand if they dont care about what purists think then why hide behind questions and not answer theres no reason aside from a lack of respecttheres no need to be ao dramatic about the whole thing they dont care about the source material or book readers they disrespect you this is a shining example of why you dont entertain questions from a rabid and unreasonable fan basebecause theyre so rabid and unreasonable that anything you say is going to get blown out of proportion"

"Dragonstoned",2013-04-26,"what do you want them to say exactly we made this change because we thought it would play out better on a television show or we made this change because of budgetary reasons those are the reasons behind almost every decision they dont make changes willy nilly or because they think it will in fact be worse with that change budget providingthe budgetary ones noone has any problems with except i suppose that hbo should give them as big a budget as they want to match the popularity of the show i guess people want more depth on the reasons  saying we thought it would be interesting for the actors to play it out this way is all well and good but it raises the question of why they feel this is more important than preserving the plot eg why is it a bigger concern than robbs reasons for sleeping with his eventual wife and ballsing up the northern campaignsaying we thought it would be better is a copout instead of a justification you said yourself that they dont make changes because they think it will be worse so it goes without saying that that is the basic reason why we just want to know why the change makes it better within the framework of the source material and adaptation process and it would be the most interesting thing to listen to the showrunners thinkingwow this thread go quickly from praise cogman to bash ddall i have to say is even though i dont agree with all their changes this is by far the best adaptation i have ever seen in tvfilms and most of the added scenes have been great so far not surprisingly cogman did most of my favorites i know most of us would have loved to see everything exactly as it was on our heads but thats impossiblei am mostly responsible for the change in the thread direction but it was because the interview posted was apparently meant to sooth bookpurist fears and i thought it didnt i loved what is dead may never die and thought it was the best episode last season that wasnt blackwater and bc is definitely my favourite showrunneras for the second point then the show is facking brilliant third best thing on tv after wire and firefly imo but this doesnt mean we cant expect it to be better the thing is that theres the chance to make something truly epic and timeless which is what the books are a show without question the best thing on tv and its falling just short of the mark just want it to be as good as it could be edited by dragonstoned 26 april 2013  1137 am"

"King Tommen",2013-04-26,"it should also be mentioned that it is exceedingly rare for any showrunner of popular and serialized television projects to provide any kind of reasons for making the decisions that they do they often feel like the art should speak for itself and either arent interested or comfortable justifying the way certain decisions are made guys like david chase sopranos david simon the wire or matthew weiner mad men wouldnt interact with fans or provide reasons for the choices that they make onscreen even if you begged them to all in all i think the level of access that dd have provided as well as the latitude they have given writers like cogman to speak about many many aspects of the production and the writing process is fairly astounding if youre looking for comparisons i think the fanbase because its so rabid and has the books as the source material can be at times unreasonably demanding of details that have historically never been offered up to the general public i also think that we can all agree that this endeavour like all art like georges books isnt perfect and you are free to disagree with aspects of it i just dont really understand why some fans will dwell on these particular aspects and let them drive their opinion of the entire series in my case on a series that i enjoyed immensely when certain things appear that chafe for me i would let my feelings be known once or maybe twice and then id move on because i get exponentially more enjoyment from watching this show than i do misery why would i choose to focus on the negative to such an extreme degree"
"protar",2013-04-26,"spare me the bullshit all one would need to do is look at your posting history some posts in this thread even to see that  1 you  and a lot of other posters  do feel some sense of entitlement when it comes to explanations for why certain changes were made  2 you  and other posters  make personal attacks against dds character all the time again in this thread evena personal attack would be insinuating that dd are horrible people for their mistakes in the show there are posters about which call them dumb and dumber and make those attacks but i am not one of them i simply criticise theyre writing and show decisions and arent always or ever too sweet about it thats not a personal attack its an opinionmy view of dd is irrelevant i never mention what i think about them as people because i dont know as ive never met them its a boldfaced lie for you to say you dont personally attack them and if you like ill come back to this thread with ample quotes to prove it so just as you dont like being personally attacked itd be easy to assume that nobody else does either you consistently question their ability as writers and their ability to run this show effectively but thats not a personal attack then how is it possible for you to consider what i said a personal attack what do you know about filmtelevision production in that case enlighten meagain i dont see these as personal attacks some people arent good writers when they then publish their writing people are perfectly at liberty to criticise that again i do not presume to know what theyre like as people i only ever criticise them in relation to the show your argument is a two edged sword on the one hand you can ask when criticism becomes personal attacks on the other you can ask when refusing to criticise them becomes ridiculous coddling are you seriously saying no one should be able to criticise how they run the show without it being a personal attack certainly i have never intended to personally attack them if my posts ever came across like that i think weve all said less than polite things in the heat of the moment after allas for my knowledge in film its hardly encyclopedic but i am approaching the end of a 2 year film course in college and including my high school experience that makes four years study film almost a quarter of my life i know you perhaps dont see a 17 year old as an aficionado of film and youre probably right but i am not entirely innocent of the topic and im sure there are plenty of purists here who do actually work in film or related jobsits ridiculous that the site enforces rules that we dont accuse any of the unsullied from twop of being book readers or that we even mention them by name but theres no such rule in place for the people behind the show you know i enjoy debating the show with you protar but youre kidding yourself if you think you dont do exactly what you just said that you didnt in your original post the irony here is that i didnt accuse you or say anything much different than what youve said about dd so maybe you should get some thicker skin before throwing around insultsi apologise if i was throwing around insults i enjoy debating the show with you as well i only wish that we could do that more civillyand yes this fandom  as a whole  is horrible everywhere you go people spoil the big moments from the series left and right youtube videos message boards  basically anywhere on the internet compound that with the fact that this is essentially one of the closest adaptations ever done for television or film and then look at the amount of complaining over changes and its not hard to see why i and others would think that the sense of entitlement comes from the fact that we didnt have to get an adaptation of this story at all would you have preferred that im sure martin wouldnt have as it has opened his amazing book series up to people all over the world who wouldnt have heard about it any other way ultimately were all here to discuss the books and the adaptation of the books not how much the people involved in the production of the show respect andor care about the source material or the fan basei think a better argument would be that the internet is horrible this forum at any rate is mostly given over to intelligent discussion of the show it can be heated but lets be honest here  both sides of the argument are guilty of thatobviously i would not prefer no show at all the show is very good and i think i know that i fail to get across most of the time how much i like the show how excited i get every week but it is not perfect no show is i try to give intelligent constructive criticisms and i think that criticism is very important to the media industryif i were to continually post about how martin doesnt give a fuck about his fans because of the way he split up fan favorite characters among the last two books or how long its taking for these latest books to be released then i would hope someone would call me out on it because it wouldnt be within my knowledge to know any of that for a certainty the fact that it would be conjecture on my part wouldnt excuse the fact that i was being an ignorant ass however thats what im trying to saytheyre not really the same situations though anyone who looked into the reasons behind the character split and the frustrating writing times would know that martin struggled incredibly with this section of the story and was most certainly trying his best to tell an exciting story and get it out as quickly as possible and martin is ever visiting fan conventions and doing interviews he finds it hard to say no its kind of improbable that anyone with any knowledge of the topic would consider martin to not care about his fans though i could understand the view that hes having trouble with motivationin this case theres little evidence that dd struggled immensely with the source material and that only after thoroughly exhausting every over option they decided to make changes that would be the equivalent it seems fairly clear from what interviews weve gotten that dd are comfortable with deviating from the books whenever the mood strikes them i dont see this as positive but i can certainly understand if you doin any case i think weve strayed offtopic in a thread about an episode not by dd but by a writer who i actually think is excellent id love to pick the conversation up in some other thread or some over time and i would really like for things to be friendlier whilst discussing it and im not blaming

"Words of Winter",2013-04-26,"wow this thread go quickly from praise cogman to bash ddall i have to say is even though i dont agree with all their changes this is by far the best adaptation i have ever seen in tvfilms and most of the added scenes have been great so far not surprisingly cogman did most of my favorites i know most of us would have loved to see everything exactly as it was on our heads but thats impossible and yes as a die hard stannis supporter im concerned about the direction theyre taking his character but if dd decided to make him that way in the end its their right to do soand of course they dont own us anything but more feedback would be welcomed in the end the hardcore fans of the serie most of the time are also the hardcore fans of the books hope they learn from cogman and start do more interviews and become more friendlieropen to their fansm and change the deal with it attitude here here cheersgif classbbcemoticon altcheers the way i see it dd took a gamble put their money and investors money on the line and said hbo we want to do this and will you give us tens of millions per year to adapt a yet unfinished epoch consisting of at least 4000 pages of detail into serial show it takes balls and they could have failed and may still fail its now their story to tell they are fully invested in project emotionally finiancially artistically and i for one would rather them concentrate on writing than spending all their time answering the same questions over and over and defending themselves i wish some other unnamed authors would do the same winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  if they were to answer questions it would probably create as much animosity as not answering them because millions of people have millions of points of view look some of the episodes i rated as 8 or 9 others thought were garbage some i thought were underwhelming others thought were orgasmic we all have our own opinions and they have to tell the story they want to tell otherwise it will become 2that said i wish it was more truthful to the original books but to restate franko99 this is by far the best book to tv adaptation i have ever seeneta brian cogman is a fantastic surrogate for dd in interviews because fandom knows he will do his best to be true to the source material edited by dread pirate dave 26 april 2013  1040 pm"

"King Tommen",2013-04-27,"i dont get the stannis complaints either because 1 hes been on screen for a grand total of about 2 minutes so far this season theres not enough footage to come to any kind of conclusion at this point 2 the source material at this point of the story doesnt portray him any differently really he spends a large portion of asos moping around dragonstone without a true purpose and looking like hes lost his way since losing the battle of blackwater people are projecting far too many developments that they know are coming on to the character at the moment i find that a lot of people do the same thing with characters like jon and jaime as well where they have an image of them after finishing adwd and forget that these characters were not nearly as fully formed during their stories in acok and asos patience my friends youll get your resolute and kickass stannis but looking for that at this point in the story isnt going to yield a lot of satisfaction"
"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-27,"stannis having sex with melisandre is clearly lifted from the books but would stannis be pining after her im not so sure but even if he did they could have at least made the writing of higher quality than what we got in the third episode it sounded like bad fanfiction i think its pretty ridiculous to assume that dd who live and breathe game of thrones and asoiaf did not make a change without a good reason the reason they dont tell the fans is because as has been mentioned they dont owe an explanation in addition to that most fans have no idea what theyre talking about they can say what they think makes good television and what would and would not work in the that medium when compared to the books but the fact of the matter is that dd are professionals and very successful ones at that the reasons they have for making any changes from the source material have far more knowledge behind them that any book reader will likely have i hate this line of argument because it suggests that we should just sit back and let changes happen because dd are professionalsso what were the viewers if we think a change is bad our viewpoint is perfectly valid several changes last season are pretty much unanimously considered bad the kidnapping of the dragons and robbtalisa both these storylines completely changed what was in the book some would use the word butchered and replaced the material with the very same cliches and tropes that grrm was trying to deconstruct the first robbtalisa scene where he falls in love as soon as he sees her and she starts sassing him is just awful tv and the same goes for xaro xhoan daxos cutting his hand outside the gates of qarth neither of those changes were due to timeconstraints or budget as dany and robb actually had more screentimeif those are the sorts of changes dd are going to make they should stop making changes because all theyre doing is lowering the quality of the tv showi havent seen anyone complain about changes that were genuinely due to timeconstraints or budget such as the merged shadowbabies the lack of storms end theon beheading ser rodrik etc ive seen people disappointed that some of their favourite moments wont happen but ive never seen any genuine complaints over changes that were actually necessary"

"Joyful Union",2013-04-27,"what is unrealistic about arya surviving through the war she survives through harrenhal because she submits and has jaqens gift she survives after that because she is taken as a hostage by the brotherhood without banners and then the hound she survives after that because she joins the faceless meni dont understand the problem here children have survived wars for as long as wars have been fought and they will continue to survive through wars for as long as wars continue to take placewell the part in acok where the keep where the nightwatchmen are hiding out is assaulted was fairly unrealistic i find it incredibly hard to believe that arya suddenly gained the kind of fighting ability she displayed during that part other than that your right in that she got incredibly lucky in her sequence of guardians which in itself could be considered unrealistic but whatever its entertaining"

"Mulled Wino",2013-04-29,"they just sort of disappear or rather i dont really know if they ever appear despite cat mentioning that her bargain included frey troops iirc it was 1000i think the point the show is making is that house frey comes with considerably more troops than the karstarks brought such that if they are able to get them back on his side frey never really fully offers his arm to robb in the show just sends a small amount of troops as bargained then they can take cr this point is fine really its inconsistent with the books but its not beyond belief that the freys can offer a large apply to supplement whats left of the northern army im not really sure why his plan is to attack casterly rock though instead of winning back the north i guess in the show only winterfell and deepwood motte is lost but still even robb says on the show he cant be king if he cant defend his own landsthey shouldve just had him hatch the three pronged northern plan with frey support the numbers the armies bring are largely irrelevantits inconsistent there was every indication that the freys already joined robbanyway i want show robb to die because the whole storyline is a disaster he takes his army from the west to hh to lay siege to an empty freakin castle then he marches them back to rr for a funeral then he decides  with the amazing wartime council of a nursewife that he must go back west with a significantly smaller force to fight tywin but wait his solution is to go back to a guy he completely betrayed and beg for some troops of course this is immediately after he executes his biggest ally for betraying himwtf"
"Currawong",2013-04-29,"yes taking casterly rock only dawning on robb whilst hes at riverrun after he had spent the entirety of last season in the west is quite dumb except that for most of last season a large part of the lannister forces were also in the west  tywin only brought them east to kl before blackwater arriving just in time along with the tyrells robb marching on casterly rock then would not have made any sense at all anyway i agree with others battle scenes and tactics are generally not grrms strong point and the nitty gritty details of those are not that important to the show id say most viewers really couldnt care less about exact numbers of forces precise maps and so on theyre not watching details of the normandy invasion in ww2 on history channel the main thing the writers needed to show about robb executing karstark was that it added to the disaffection within his own forces and resulted in him losing a significant number of troops it really doesnt matter whether hes lost 25 30 or 50  the main issue is that his overall forces have been weakened and he is now facing issues within his own side which are largely of his own making plus of course we know from last week that dear edmures action in leaving riverrun on his little glory expedition has lost another few hundred knights"

"juanml82",2013-04-29,"well in the show the north has through boltons bastard reconquered winterfell at least in the sense that there are no more ironborn there even if they are believed to have put the castle to the torch there are probably more ironborn loose in the north but the capitol has been technically recovered"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-29,"its inconsistent there was every indication that the freys already joined robbanyway i want show robb to die because the whole storyline is a disaster he takes his army from the west to hh to lay siege to an empty freakin castle then he marches them back to rr for a funeral then he decides  with the amazing wartime council of a nursewife that he must go back west with a significantly smaller force to fight tywin but wait his solution is to go back to a guy he completely betrayed and beg for some troops of course this is immediately after he executes his biggest ally for betraying himwtfwell i think the point is that cat gets a tiny amount of freys to join robb id have to check but i think it was a thousand i suppose the show is alluding to the fact that house frey has significantly more troops to offer and with them robb will have more than made up for his losses by beheading rickard karstarkin the books we have him going to walder frey to cross into the north but also to win them back as allies by offering edmure not only as redemption but also to secure allegiance so the point here is that he will once again secure allegiance with them but also convince them that they can take casterly rock its not a good plan by any means but i dont think the numbers are really inconsistent its the reasoning thats pretty poor i dont get why they didnt just have him returning north but thats probably because he believes boltons bastard to have successfully returned to winterfells ruins but the whole were going home thing i thought was more powerful than were going to prolong this battle and still probably lose edited by darkandfullofturnips 29 april 2013  0719 pm"

"YTDN",2013-04-30,"i usually dont get wound up about changes in the show but this one does puzzle me in interviews richard madden has said that robbs motivation is to go home and his biggest fear is to win the war but to be left sitting alone on a throne with no family or anything for this whole war to be for nothing that is consistent with the characterisation in season 2 so i wonder why in season 3 they decided to have robb go after casterly rock rather than turn back to retake the north especially since some nonreaders have seen this as a negative mark on his character something i think they might do later in the season is for robb to change his mind about casterly rock possibly after hearing about balon greyjoys death which i think will happen in episode 8 and be persuaded by his mother or talisa or both to basically cut his losses and go home sansa would be married at this point so that could be an extra motivation hes basically lost his entire family at this point however there arent that many episodes left and this could be seen as flipflopping i dunno i just find the sudden change in robbs motivation puzzling"

"Mulled Wino",2013-04-30,"yes and no he and cat had personal reasons to go there but there was no reason to take such a large chunk of his army riverrun is between harrenhal and the westerlands so why march them all the way to harrenhal then march them all the way back again why didnt robb and cat drop in to see hoster on his death bed and let bolton take the army and deal with harrenhal and why send your army to harrenhal in the firstplace if casterly rock is your real targetas for the freys if wed had some dialogue to explain why they left robbs army in the first place i wouldnt mind but now it looks like even with the marriage pact they still refused to fight alongside him what makes him think theyll be any more loyal after his betrayal in the books he has no choice but to seek their help if he wants to get his army accross the river but since the show has him going west and not north then why not seek allies elsewereim dying to know how the mountain and the stark army passed each other without noticing"

"Hoo",2013-04-30,"i was not caught up in the numbers the important things was that half the men left whether they were karstarks or karstarks and their loyals is less important i feel robs story is so important as it counter weighs the lannisters in the game of thrones they are the ones challenging the throne and mounting a rebellion but not much was done in the movie since rob defeated jamies army theyve been wandering around aimlessly that is my issue with robs plot king in the north but he does not hold the north his little brothers who escaped winterfell cannot hide in the north he has no friends in the north he goes west just weird the writers acknowldged this flaw when rob said when we started this war we had a purpose since then theyve been bickering like children without a purpose he needed a new purpose i buy the idea of attacking the castilly rock"

"StannisandDaeny",2013-04-30,"well retaking winterfell there isnt much to retake is there its been destroyed for all he knows rooses bastard is protecting the north and karstarks men will fight the ironborn up north and leaving riverrun would be allowing it and harrenhal to be overrun not to mention it would also be a fullblown retreat from the actual front and thus a way of admitting his defeat at a point in time where he has to show strength to avoid losing more of his bannermen edited by stannisanddaeny 30 april 2013  0829 am"

"gibbles545",2013-04-30,"i think the main problem was that in the first seasons seasons robb apeared to be surrounded by a group of men who he won the loyalty of namely the greatjon blackfish etc but now in this season he has bolton and karstark there is no sense that he has the loyalty of his men like in the books i think they could of overcome the problems that talisas inclusion in the story created if they had made robbs bannerman more similar to the books alas now the rw will be more obvious and lack the emotional punch it had in the books because by and large in the books it did appear as though robb could make up for his mistakes in the war but in the tv show not so much"
"Mother of Mini Dragons",2013-04-30,"i never was a book robb fan but have always loved catelyn thats why the rw had the greatest impact on me bc of her view during it so im not emotionally invested too much in the changes to robbs story on tv i dont care about who his wife is or any of that stuff but i will say that the one thing that stands out and bothers me is that you see zero focus from tv robb on reclaiming the north hes uberfocued on tywin lannister i just dont understand it i know hes supposed to believe that the boltons are securing winterfell but i think his desire to reclaim his home should be uttered from his lips at least once to me this has to be addressed in the next two or 3 episodes or it will greatly lessen the impact of rw edited by mother of mini dragons 30 april 2013  0904 am"

"Tadco26",2013-04-30,"i mostly agree with this apart from a few pointsdid he ever actually say that he couldnt take casterly rock with his previously sized forcethough the location of robbs camp is never specified its made quite clear that he goes to the crag from his camp to accept a surrender in s2 harrenhal was confusing though it would make sense to capture it since it is very strategically importantalso his plan isnt to go to the twins the negotiations will come next episode and they will in all likelihood occur at it may well be that that will be his plan but it isnt at this point in the story it may also turn out that his plan changes and he tries to return to the north after allim pretty sure he said he didnt have the numbers to take casterly rock but i will have to double check that either way why wouldnt taking casterly rock be the most blatantly obvious strategy from the get go if it was vulnerable he was already in the west he had the karstarks and the freys still on his side and tywin is in the far east in kings landing but casterly rock doesnt even cross his mind til now of course the show tends to regularly completely disregard the map when it comes to travel times and distancesit wont keep the show from being entertaining and as a whole i have been very happy with season 3 its just a shame to have sloppy writing for things that wont even be shown anyway we know robb isnt actually going to go to casterly rock so changing it so that is his plan doesnt seem to make much sense presumably yara is going to get some scenes this season so why not have her take moat cailin and threaten to raid the north while keeping robb stuck in the south why not have that scene instead of pod the sex god the details are the difference between making a good show and making one of the best shows ever"

"teemo",2013-04-30,"i love the fourth and fifth books no not as much as the first three but grrm says a lot of it is necessary backstory and i believe him"
"Tadco26",2013-05-01,"i think the fourth and fifth books are only disappointing after the firestorm of events in storm of swords combined with the splitting of the characters which means if you read feast when it first came out you went a very long time without any of the characters who were left out of it doing anything to wait that long between books and still have dany not directly moving on westeros makes it feel even longer than it will for someone who started reading the series for the first time today for example i think the show will improve things just by not splitting those characters up on reread feast and dance have grown on me and both are better than most of season 2 of the tv show thats not to say that there arent parts i didnt like in books 3 and 4 but there is a lot of good stuff too if the primary reason for changing something is because they consider it flawed they better come up with something that isnt worse to replace it with"
"Mulled Wino",2013-05-01,"i suppose thats trueyes but he didnt know that ramsey was an enemy as he was reported to have been killed by ser rodrik robb had no idea the boltons had turned on him so he had no reason to not attack moat cailin ramsay very well could have attacked his new army but that wouldnt have figured in robbs planis it confirmed that lady dustin was fighting or the boltons at that point i thought that she changed sides once the starks bit the dust would she have refused to fight he also could have ordered the bolton troops in the north to take it back they wouldnt have done it but it still would make sense as part of his plan wh was building ships but how would this prevent them from supplying troops to this hypothetical army the mountain clans while disorganised and semiautonomous coud have been persuaded to fight by a loyal retainer of robbs maybe an umber yet this never figured in his plantrue about ramsey but wh knew there was a threat at winterfell so if it was ironborn or ramsey it wouldnt be a good strategy to leave oneself open for attack from the rear by whoever just killed your couple hundred troops you just sent to winterfell much smarter to hold tight protect the only fleet the north has train new troops and strengthen your defenses which we see plenty of evidence of when davos gets there its obvious manderly hasnt been idle"

"Winter's Prince",2013-05-01,"i dont understand how karstark is half the army i was like what at the very least the writers could have instead said that they supply a lot of the infantry or have the best archers or something to that degree the only person from a single house that can come close to supporting robb a lot of troops is wyman manderly and attacking casterly rock wtf how can he be so stupid i mean come on as soon as tywin hears of the attack the lannistertyrell forces will march quickly and what comes after the attack we stay and feast and what for the lions the whole reason he did not attack casterly rock in the books was because he had no siege weapons when it comes down to the wedding i believe i will not cry for robb i might not even care but i do know i will cry for cat because thats my baby i love her damn when she wears her hair down she looks amazing mhmmm"

"Ran",2013-05-02,"sorry ran but how can it be a bit of sloppiness if you say they did it on purposethey intended the freys to withdraw their support their failure to note this at all is sloppiness the idea that they cant mention the freys more than once is just not credible they should have mentioned it at least a couple of times prior to episode 5 if losing karstark was so bad losing the freys would have been worse but as it is the show is silent about them stupid especially when theyre playing a big part in the back halfdavid and dan have all this stuff planned out for them and yet still they seem to have a real problem with being able to drop breadcrumbs about upcoming story pointsat that point robb had to surrender while he was still in a position of relative strenght thats true both in the books and the shownot really true robb could have thrown the ironmen out and held on to the north easily enough the only reason to surrender might be to win favorable terms"

"Cadiva",2013-05-02,"the way the show is laying the foundation for why robb ends up at the twins is indeed clumsy to book readers but i think its too minor to get upset about they are having robb go for casterly rock rather than to retake the north because other than what he have seen from theons point of view very little has been said about the impact of the ironmen they have also already established through reports by bolton that winterfell was retaken but found destroyed i think they believe that it will be too confusing for people first coming to the story if there are somehow enough northmen left to have retaken winterfell but that most of the north is still cut off from robbs army it seems they think it will be simpler to frame the story that robb is going to the twins to make amends with frey in order to make one more push to win the war hes been fighting against the lannisters rather than the book story where he is essentially putting the lannisters on hiatus so he can deal with the ironmentotally agree within the context of the show its perfectly feasible and makes sense that he would approach walder frey to gain more troops and try to take casterly rock to force tywin out of kings landing or to draw out some of the kings landing defending forces and then with cr in his possession he may feel he has a bargaining chip to get sansa and arya who he still doesnt know isnt at kl released"

"Wunhopkuendo",2013-05-02,"1 i am not sure how good of an explanation it is what was their point with the war to avenge his fathers death they have no chance ot taking kings landing anymore but i do think they have established they can be an independent kingdom in the north if they went home the men would be roused from their castles if king joffrey sent an army north attempting to make them submit to his authority againyoure right in that they could easily keep the north and rally again under rob if joffrey were to attack in the end peace would have to be made with the north because no one would be able to take it unless tywin could get all other kingdoms to band together that still doesnt save sansa or arya i cant remember if rob knows arya is not at kl or not nor does it avenge his father on the show the viewer can see that tywin and his army is at kl and not at casterly rock which means that either rob thinks he can take it with the freys help or else he can force tywin to come and rescue it thus a chance to capture and kill him its not brilliant but he is a boy or young man anyway and the show doesnt have to be brilliant it just has to make the viewer think ah that could work long enough for the rw to have a shock value"

"Lucifer Lightbringer",2013-04-29,"yeah please dont use the show to judge martins use of sexuality or his lack of poetic justice in the actual books sex especially is handled in a totally different way in the books if i remember correctly there are like maybe one or two explicit sex scenes per book whereas there are at least ten per season on the show martin is a selfexpressed feminist and while he doesnt shy away from showing some of the harsh realities that women face in a fuedal society and sometimes writes sex in kind of a clumsy mechanical way the show is definitely portrayed through the eyes of our own modern media patriachy in a way i dont think he would have intended the sex is for the ratings in the show and their target audience is probably young males edit to be totally honest the show isnt a good metric for measuring the books at all they are frankly totally different except in the broadest strokes of plot and characterization the show is great for what it is and for what they have the resources and time to create but as with most anything the books are better by a long shot edited by lucifer lightbringer 29 april 2013  0245 am"

"Tirilei",2013-05-04," was there a reason to think that the lannisters wouldnt release arya and sansa for jaime iirc catelyn wanted to make the exchange and didnt feel the need to resort to any kind of warnings but robb et al thought jaime was too valuable a prison for merely getting the girls backof course there was as long as they got jayme back first from showrobb s perspective and i dont know what other knowledge he may have in the books your father was murdered by his best buddys inlaws who kept your sisters for whatever purpose they may have in mind for them so trust is zero if you cant storm their headquarteres you negotiate and dont just hand them your best cardpow i hope youre not being serious if robb was truly serious about fighting the war for his sisters he would have made the trade as soon as ned died he didnt because he wanted vengeance and gloryid say he wanted it for all of the above but vengeance and the sisters before glory at least thats how it comes across to me from the show and instead of calling it glory id call it independence someone mentioned in the show that the northmen hadnt always been under the iron throne crown but had been their own independent kingdom think scotland so thats what they want to be again as a viewer i was totally siding with them robb was the main player ive sided with through season 1 and 2 other than jon who is doing his own thing with daenerys ive sided as a woman for her personal life but not on the conquest of the throne issueas a nonreader my sympathies went like this season 1 episode 1 hated ned because he beheads that poor deserter without even listening to his story and even made bran watch i thought what a cruel man he needs to go then after that first episode he became the honest and likeable ned the only moment i didnt like about robb was when he told theon its not your house seemed to me at the time as if you tell your adoptive brother that hes not part of the family other than that he seemed cool not as attractive a character as the somber and mysterious jon but the main good guy to root for of all those aristocrats i just never understood why he took his mother with him to war and why she took off with him while her younger kid was unconscious at home"

"Golden Lion",2013-04-29,"actually its the other way around although she is clever enough to realize she can kill robert using his own weaknesses against him her plan of getting him drunk and then encouraging him to do dangerous things she didnt order anything as a result of her conversation with ned  it was already in the works is just willy nilly and the timing of his actual death was very lucky for her by the same account he would have killed the boar returned to kings landing and ned would have shared his news with robert about cerseis treason it was all left to chance and extremely riskyher moves against ned were well executed but i would wager my fortune that littlefinger helped tremendously with that plan he says as much to ned when he tells ned to move against cersei but ned refuses at that point it is littlefinger that persuades the guards to side with cersei and not the handthe wildfire was a great idea but left with no real plan for execution had tyrion not formulated his plan for the substance cerseis plan was to dump it and light it bye bye kings landing cerseis plan to kill tyrion was not solid either which is probably why tyrion is alivecersei is not dumb but she is hardly competent and cannot really make strategic plans that is her major flaw when it comes to playing the game she doesnt see the whole board nor anticipate many of the moves so her short sighted plans usually fail or succeed if she has a bit of luckthe same could be said for other players the luckiest people when it comes to plots in westeros are tyrion and littlefinger things just fall into their laps varys cersei marg etc all play the same but they dont benefit from the same amount of luck as the others but the throne room scene was already set whether or not the city watch followed ned the lannisters were already butchering house stark if they took the lannisters hostage then cersei already had sansa to barter with not to mention the lannister forces are far greater than the watch an army would march on kings landing and liberate them quickly enough at which time littlefinger would still betray ned because littlefinger doesnt like being on the losing side it was a good plan that anticipated littlefinger going where the power is i agree cerseis luck for plans runs out about sos but i still think shes a competent player before she goes batshit with grief and paranoia after that shes a timebomb her moves only work in the short term her paranoia and gender frustration make her short sighted joffrey is only in a position to kill ned because in her desire for power she put a child on the throne that it should have been clear she wouldnt be able to control that conversation about the standing army whaaa the wildfire is a battle tactic not a political move even then wildfire is extremely dangerous and she knows that the decision to put people at risk the way she did could be argued to be quite reckless tyrion says there was enough wildfire there to level the city foreshadowing at her descent into the same madness that king aerys had perhapsyes spare him and send him to the wall where the other northerners who know him would be appalled at the accusation that eddard stark would betray robert could easily visit him to find out the truth anyway and still lead a rebellion now honestly there was just no good way to handle that situation the fact is the consequences caught up to the brotherfucker and the best thing to do would have been to run as ned offered her the chance to do but because she wanted to be allpowerful queen she was like lol no and chose the course of action that had no way of ending wellbesides as it was stated most of the proof she is incompetent is after tyrion is gone once she truly is left to make her own decisions things go horribly oh hey bank whos notorious for getting their money however they need to that money we owe lol nah wait til this war is over oh hey religious zealots you can form your military again its all goodoh hey people who try to give me sensible advice im just going to assume youre plotting against me and have you thrown out and replacedoh hey littlefinger lets pretend this girl is arya stark even though i have absolutely no proof that arya stark is dead other than my own assumptions nevermind that if arya isnt dead she looks enough like her parents to discredit the impostorare we reading the same book ned couldnt start a rebellion from the wall because they have his daughter thats the only reason he confessed in the first place it wasnt half baked he was a confessed traitor and neds suggestion would have meant to her own death or exile and those of her childrenand i think youre completely missing the point about how decisions after tyrion leaves shes a completely different person after joffrey and tywin die she loses most of her faculties and becomes cripplingly paranoid which makes her even easier to be manipulated and from that make terrible decisions thats not the same cersei from books 13 once her father and son die shes broken with nothing but fleeting power as the tyrells control the king and the capital her family all turn on her the few that are alive shes unstable for a reason and its not incompetence"

"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-04-30,"tywin said he wanted to marry cersei to loras because he was going to inherit highgardenim not sure about this but i guess it means willasgarlan will not have any big participation whatsoever in twow or ados otherwise they wouldnt simply rule them out in the seriesthat is a bad assumption the show has killed characters off that are still alive in dance with dragons and will be in winds of winter theres no reason not to assume that loras or someone else couldnt fill their role if necessary but i suppose you can assume that a character that has only been mentioned in name will not have a significant role in the final two books and that one knight is as good as two if hes the knight of flowers however i believe that cersey will be the one making loras becoming a member of the kg so she can avoid the weddingthey dont need to break anything theyll simply have lady olenna reject the offer by saying that cersei is too usedlike in the books agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree i dont think that is her reason though olenna agrees to the sansa stark idea because she knows what a tame little girl sansa is cersei is anything but a tame little girlthe tyrells already have the joffreymargaery marriage why would they need a second marriage to another lannister one that already has three true born children that will inherit lands from castley rock should her brothers be disinheritedits funny that the tyrells in the show werent even that interested in sansa until varys and littlefingers plotting against eachother brought them into their game now that the lannisters will thwart their move they will probably disagree with the loras move just because marrying him to a different girl from another major house would probably be better for themlook at all the alliances the lannisters have right nowsansa tyrion  north  riverlandsmargaeryjoffrey reach stormlands kingslandingjaimecersei castley rockmyrcellatrystane  dornea couple things that factor into the argument of the two new proposed marriages for house lannister1 tywin wants these marriages to strengthen house lannister2 tyrion and cersei dont want them for their own personal reasons3 margaery wants to increase the strength of her house more than her or her brothers personal happiness4 loras doesnt exactly want to marry for his own personal reasons as well but hell do it for his house5 sansa is clueless that the tyrells want to marry her for her claim6 olenna seems to want to make her family grow strong and keep them from being idiots shes succeeded and failed in some casesi dont see olenna wanting this marriage for loras but what other powerful family has an unwed daughter that he could marry instead dorne does but that is not going to happen so idk guess well have to see what the qots says because i have no idea"

"Ser Pounce FTW",2013-05-01,"i disagree i myself would never involve children into this not ever i think his mistake was bringing them in kl at the first place not sharing such secretive matter with them was good and for preparing themhe didnt know he was gonna leave wfl until it was too late to start with the lessonsand as i recall they said something in the lines of sansa and arya would benefit from being in the courtthey should see whats this like im sure i would consider this a mistake if he knew he was gonna die so soon and his 13 year old daughter would be forced to marry and robert was going to be murdered by a pig and ppl would start fighting over a throne the way i see it in his mind this was still to far for sansa to even consider it but he didnt know any of thishis daugters were too young for this and he thought he was doing whats best for themhe thought hell have roberts protectionhe believed telling lf to be on his side for cat would be enoughhe believed cercei will run he was wrong to believe all thisbut if this was what he believedand it was why tell anything to a child who ever includes a child while talking war and plots and politicsfrom your post i believe you are under the impression that when i say he should have talked with his children you think i mean sansa arya the queen is fucking her brother also theres been a murder and people are trying to pass it off for a natural death finally the baratheon children are all bastards and so treason has been committed and the king may well be in danger you also seem to believe that when i say prepare them i mean months and months of training if you believe that you are very mistaken and at the risk of being repetitive i shall post what i think he should have told them sansa my dear we are not in winterfell any longer there are things we must be aware of for example the lannisters are an important family that is accustomed to getting their way no matter what this family has done some very questionable things in the past also you are to be married i will ensure that your lady mother talks to you of what to expect and what is expected of you your septa will continue that conversation with you when we are in kings landing finally remember our words child winter is coming be on your guard and do not assume someone means you well before you can be sure of what is in their heart remember you can always rely on your family and our knights and guardsmen so keep near themthat hardly involves children in the situation but does make them aware of the fact that their party is in danger also thinking of sansa as a child is not quite right while she is very young and hasnt flowered yet she has become betrothed and is travelling with her fiance and their family she is going to court she is not seen as a child even if she is not quite a woman yet whats more danaeryis is a year older and margaery is 2 years older neither of them is anywhere near as blind to the real world as sansa is because no one thought to shelter them from what they needed to be prepared for margaery is most definitely a part of her familys planning and for her to show the level of understanding she had at 14 in the story her education has to start early whether you agree that sansa was too young to understand court or not the reality is everyone else around her did understand a great deal of what was going on and she was forced to figure it out on her own no one showed any sympathy for her because she was young the royal family did not think she was too youngyou are probably correct in thinking they shouldnt have gone to kings landing however they do go and ned was fully aware that the south is a nest of adders and that the lannisters are merciless i also agree that he felt he had the kings protection however he still considered the situation so much of a threat that he told his wife to prepare for possible war they are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify moat cailin two hundred determined archers can hold the neck against an army his chidlren should have been told there was a problem not given the gory detailsanyway as a result of her father chosing to keep her unaware of the danger she was in at court sansa was captured and held hostage and surprise surpreise she is now betrothed to a lannister this could have definitely ended differently if she had been told to be cautious especially of a lannister"
"juanml82",2013-05-01,"i think its a matter of education when the man trying to drill into sansa that life isnt a song is the same he betrays her father so he can keep his brothels working instead of her father something is very very wrong both ned and cat knew sansa and bran felt life was a song and should have prevented that they wont and probably dont need to make them masters of courtly intrigue but they should have made sure they knew what knights really are edit a real failsafe would have been for ned to ask robert for either myrcella marrying to bran and remaining in the north or for tommen to remain as a ward either at the north or at the riverlands effectively giving him a hostage should things go very wrong as he suspected edited by juanml82 01 may 2013  0518 pm"

"Kittykatknits",2013-05-01,"robert strong is going to fucking rampage on those sparrows im absolutely certain about that that high sparrow is so incredibly fucked up almost on a level with qyburn what they did to the blue bard was just its a shame because i had hopes for one of the first grassroots movements in westeros but it looks like its just going to be torture and genocide from themeta are you horrified because of the way the chapter was written or because of sympathy for cerseithe short answer to your question is yes smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  as i said ive got pretty strong feelings about the whole chapter ive got a huge amount of sympathy for cersei as she was punished for having sex not for her actual crimes it was done to break a womans pride using a method that is sexually degrading and abusive i hate the hs and before this chapter i merely disliked kevan after reading the wos and the prologue im convinced he is just as bad as tywin and find him to be equally revolting as his big brother i also get really angry when i read comments from people that describe the wos as a fistpumping moment or they wish she was hurt worse it was a sexual assault plain and simple and no one deserves that now as to the way that the chapter is written i also have some issues with it martin describes the wos as a punishment for her pride which ive got a big problem with im revolted by the walk as it goes on for page after page forcing me as a reader to bear witness to her sexual assault in detail to feel her struggles and read about her being slowly broken as a woman up until dance i felt martin was mostly responsible in his use of sexual assault and violence in his story line a better effort than ive seen elsewhere but not without faults either if a writer chooses to depict rape or sexual assault on screen or page the writer has a responsibility to handle the aftermath as well it should not be dismissed it should not be used to further man pain kevan again and it should be dealt with instead we got kevans prologue and it is only through him that we see that cersei is actually responding in many ways as a rape victim does im very disappointed that cersei is not the one who was given the first chance to respond to the wos its her assault not kevansand the hs is a nasty piece of work on many levels the blue bard and seeing what was done to kb i believe we are only starting to figure out what his real desires are not a particular cersei fan but if she takes him down then im putting her on my list of personal heroes so thats my opinion if you do a search on walk of shame in the book forum youll see threads on this very topic ps dont get me started on tyshaall truemy point was however that if she claims shes smarter than most people she would manage to think of something better to manipulate people with and would advocate her brains more like a weapon you should useoutsmart them if you are smarterthink of a way you dont have to let anyone get near you if thats what you dislike you say youre smart enough so prove it using sex as a weapon like i said is legitall is fair in love and war i just think this showed that she more believes herself smart and less proves it by her actionshere i think were on the same pagei saw your postsi know how you feel about it as i said im always more inflicted by human degradation than by some other scenes in the book good luck with hs though here in asoiaf we rarely get our satisfactory ending for a bad guyif this is directed to me as well as ser pounce i just wanted to point out my words were never meant to be interpreted literallythat was more my view of what happened i did read your posts and i agree with most of themif you read some of my posts you might have seen that i often present and discuss as kanon my personal interpretation of a scene rather than quote text from the bookim one of those readers who thinks personal impression while reading is imperative even if emotion we felt isnt what majority felt or thoughtotherwise we can just let someone else read it for us and then tell us what to feel smilepng classbbcemoticon alt thanks for responding i saw this earlier today but am only just now sitting down to a keyboard to be able to respond to you from what i see we are generally on the same page i think you are right on what this shows i dont think cersei is stupid by any means shes got a certain cunning to her but she tends to ignore what is not in front of her and can take a forest for the trees approach in thinking a good example is the tyrells she could see they were out to take more power for themselves but her sponse was to think of them as an enemy rather than take an approach similar to tywin  figure out how to maintain power while still handling the relationship its the same with the hs cersei could only see her gains without thinking about what she gave up in the process thats what the sex scenes show i think shes got smarts but not enough to figure out a different path cersei thinks she is tywin come again or tywin with teats to put it more crudely but shes not she still hasnt figured out why he was feared and she is notalso thank you for clarifying what you had meant earlier i admit the let them rape her comment left a bad taste in my mouth because i have seen this phrasing used in other discussions as a very deliberate effort to blame the victim than the actual rapist communication in the written format can leave out context and tone so it can be hard to understand where another person is coming from i get it now as to how you read the text i think i agree with you on some subjects or plotlines it just depends on which those happen to be i do use depend heavily on the text although ive been lazy about quoting lately but as you see from my above comment certain things do draw an immediate personal and emotional reaction from me and heavily influence how i view the text btw i dont think sansa will follow cerseis model so far shes chosen a different pathohgods i hope not smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  she would make them love herrememberits kind of more margs wayhave no fear she wont early on in the sansa p2p thread there was a series of short essays looking at the influences of female characters on sansa i did cersei smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  the discussion pointed out that the two of them follow some parallel paths in the story crush on idealistic prince marriage far from their ideal styles of ruling and so on but sansa has consistently stayed away from and refused the lessons that cersei gives her elba the intoner also wrote up a great post on symbolism with the two of them during the night of the blackwater cersei is the one that had the maiden symbolism while sansa actually had symbolism that matched the mother i cant remember which thread these were in probably between 69 or somewheres thereaboutsim quite sure sansa already knows in general terms how babies are made other than that yeah its awkward timingyes she knows how babies are made and has pretty clear expectations on what would be expected of her as a lady wife after she leaves kl sansa reflects on her wedding night and thinks to herself it wouldnt have been bad at all under different circumstances but she had a clear understanding on what her moon blood meant and then we also have her thoughts on her wedding night she spends quite a bit of time reflecting on what her septa told her  all men are beautful and that she would find something about her husband that was beautiful the implication of course is that this would help her do her duty the big twist of course is that sansa rejects this teaching also in her last chapter in feast sansa is asked if she knows what goes on in the marriage bed and then thinks briefly of tyrion and then of the hounds kiss and replies with yes so she knows now whether shes ready to act on that knowledgethats a whole nother discussion"

"zaphodbrx",2013-04-29,"the freys were run by the late walder frey who never quite showed up even during roberts rebellion he was like sir robin of camelot who nearly fought the chicken of bristol the freys make their nut by guarding the crossing not by taking chances in battles even when the freys were firmly on robbs side they did not contribute except by allowing his passagethats only for the showin the books they were 100 and more behind supporting robb there were freys in every army robb had frey knights fought with valor in every battle eg black walder scaled the walls at the crag the eldest son and heir died in one of the battlesim sorry to say but in the books robb betrayed them very very badly its not that he deserved the rw but he really shouldnt have let his dick do his thinking for him like reallytvrobb is a mixedbag on one hand hes not really dependent on the freys very much  they dont exist in the show yet outside of one s1 episode  but on the other he is more or less a complete moron i mean take this new plan for instance hi there ole bridge troll sorry bout yer daughter hey look can you support me in attacking casterly rock cause i lost half my men due to being an idiot ha"
"Bizzy",2013-04-29,"lol the freys wear still the silly heads from season 1 no blue und grey clothes like nobleshttpwwwyoutubecgceujfwindex1what i personally dont understand is in the series the frey army goes with him in season 1 why does he needs to get them now they never run away from himand the most silly thing for me karstark  half of robbs army  what the fuck bolton treason karstark hatekarstark seems to be a gigantic and powerful house maybe they rule over the half north too seems like the tv robb deserves his death since more then half of the north hates him only manderly and reeds like him yes and his own relatives tullynot that they already introduced house glover morment and umber in season 1 even house bracken seems they dissapeared into the earth and robbs army was mainly karstark and bolton and few tullysi really liked that episode but this details how will they get the hole the north remembers thing  the north seems to remember only that robb is a idiot since nearly half of the north are karstarks and the other houses dont exist any more"
"Harrad",2013-04-29,"thats only for the showin the books they were 100 and more behind supporting robb there were freys in every army robb had frey knights fought with valor in every battle eg black walder scaled the walls at the crag the eldest son and heir died in one of the battlesjust looking at the wiki for the freys shows that is selective memory for examplesrobb acknowledged that the freys fought bravely at the battle of the whispering wood where ser stevron was in command meanwhile cleos and tion had fought on the other side under their cousin the kingslayer and were captured along with him emmon frey also fought on the lannister side of the warafter the fall of winterfell and the lannister victory over stannis the freys in roose boltons army believed that robb should bend the kneea bit less than 100 frey never committed his full force to robb just as in the rebellion he hedged his bets edited by harrad 29 april 2013  1100 am"
"Relic",2013-04-29,"this show is making robb stark look like a giant idiot he seems genuinely surprised that the karstark men leave and it turns out they are half of his forces all of a sudden smooth move and his huge epiphany about casterly rock is just flat out laughable its like he suddenly realizes its there for the first time not like he was at the crags last season or anything and his master plan for taking cr frey men riiiiiiight edited by relic 29 april 2013  0102 pm"

"Tadco26",2013-04-29,"it was a silly part of an otherwise great episode but tv robb has been annoying since season 2 he is also so much more of a hypocrit by marrying and breaking his oath even after council from his mother and knowing that his men dont like talisa before hand the show definitely should have found some screen time to explain that the freys left robb because they really dont make it clear at all in fact i had to go back and look at the scene from episode 9 of season 1 to even verify that the freys had given any troops in the first place and they did the idea that attacking casterly rock just came to him now after he was already in the far west at the crag it was a good episode but its hard to save tv robbs character now from feeling like he deserved betrayal from the freys after betraying them first"
"Adelstein",2013-04-29,"im only mentioning this because its a book spoiler thread lysa is a foaming at the mouth isolationist at least in the books there is no chance to bring the arryns into the fold while she lives there is a reason that robb doesnt go to them its pretty well known otherwise youd think catelyns sister would come her aidyeah the vale surely has bigger armies to offer justifying rapprochment with the freys over they size of their forces is unaccurate and unnecessary if robb wants arryn help hell need the crossing on his side anywayedit and thats not even considering lysas rabid isolationism as lil points out still they need to develop itmaybe not the arryns themselves but there might be vale lords who are more willing to help out we know that a number of vale houses were itching to join robbs army earlier in the war so if robb went to the vale in person he might succeed in winning some of them to his sidelooking back at the point robb was crowned king after lysa had refused to help the riverlords didnt follow the tullys  they declared for robb as soon as the cry went up if robb approached the vale as a whole and as a potential king considering most of the vale lords presumably believe the lannisters the only other viable option murdered their last lord he might have more luck than he did in trying to recruit the vale as an ally via lysaof course this is all hypothetical and i understand why it didnt get discussed on the show etc but if hes going to the freys a house hes already pissed off for more troops youd have thought it would be worth at least considering the vale first since many of the lords there actively want to get involved"
"Frey Pie a la Mode",2013-04-29,"at this point i suddenly wondered if the rw is going to be a w at all there could be the setup of robb going to walder frey to ask him to commit the forces necessary to take casterly rock they all have a big dinner together boom this would make sense to me in the spirit of simplification that the show has been engaging in making changes to the books but still getting to the same place in the end at the end of this scenario robb and cat still end up dead and walder has his revenge for getting dissed of course the rw is one of the most iconic events in the whole series but more for the fact of its outcome than that it was a wedding im not sure what happens with edmure in this but he could end up as a hostage anyway"
"bobbybuilderton",2013-04-29,"well robb has been pretty poorly handled in the show in terms of plot acting or whatever is fine i guess but they jumbled his story i also thought the smile was kind of a lol wow karmas a bitch huh smile theres no way hes so stupid as for not realizing he can attack casterly rock i believe tywin was previously out with his forces and robb was just focused on getting the kings landing to free nedget his sisters why would he think a trip to casterly rock benefits him its the hail mary play of a man with no options left on a related note i noticed some good ole foreshadowing in this episode namely with the parallels between robb and theon robbs scene mirrors theons beheading of rodrik in theons scene his adviser telling him to ignore his instincts and saying no holding him captive is not good enough he needs to die in robbs scene you have his adviser telling him to ignore the way he was raised and saying no you cant kill him it will end badly in theons scene he listens to his adviser and takes rodriks head and it ends badly in robbs scene he does not listen to his adviser takes karstarks head and it will end badly it rained in both scenes in both scenes it was more about sending a message than the principle in both scenes you have an old warrior guy who gives last words that they hope will haunt the man swinging the sword even the music is the same so they draw the parallels to theons most damning decision in order to indicate how extremely screwed robb is"

"Birdsong65",2013-04-29,"ultimately the deviations between bookrobb and hborobb are such that the only truly devastating element of the hborw is not the spoiler deaths of robb and catelyn but of catelyn alone clearly the greatest victim of hborobbs hubris its hard to imagine hborobb as anything other than deserving in some way which is a completely abhorrent suggestion as scripted in the novels i think they are leaving little doubt to even those who have not read the novels that robb is not long for this world and it is this lack of book subtlety which should stand as just one of the reasons viewers should read the novels at some point you really miss out otherwise"

"Fredwin",2013-04-29,"the problem is that they do appear to be neutral there is hardly a mention of them catelyn makes a vague warning about marrying talisa and it never comes to fruition robb says there is only one army capable of etc etc just look at how that is phrased hes clearly identifying it as an other army as in not his there was no link in the show to show that the freys went from allies to nonallies to potential allies again this could have easily been avoided during episode 1 when they arrive at harrenhal instead of this pointless scene and the introduction of qyburn we could have had a little exposition without having to recast the great jon and all the other lords robb could have easily had the scoutsriders of each major lord report in to him while they were approaching harrenhal he could have addressed each lords rider by name and given them their respective orders this would serve to remind the audience who his bannermen are and whats going on with the war currently this would have been a relatively easy way to reveal that the freys have abandoned him where his army is situated and where his enemiesspecifically the mountainare instead the tv viewer never gets an update on the war at all and just continually confusing tidbits of the bigger story as people stated above robb is clearly the loser here in the book he understands he made a mistake and he is actually trying to fix it its his arrogance and blissful ignorance that puts his family in the crosshairs he personally felt he had nothing to fear from the freys he never saw it coming his allies the disregard for guest right in the show this is going to be a very hostile situation nothing subtle about it and the biggest tragedy as also stated above will be catsand summers death and the near miss of arya i fear robb is going to come off looking insane or suicidal"

"YTDN",2013-04-30,"i think people need to stop thinking that dd are going somewhere with talisa jeyne didnt go anywhere in the books she married robb had a couple of conversations with cat and assuming the swap theory is false which i think it is ended up exiting the plot rather cleanly im absolutely certain that talisa will do the same she simply has more fluff added to make her more of a character and give her relationship with robb more depth she doesnt have any clever plot going shes robbs love interest robb marrying her is the mistake that loses him the war and shell get slaughtered alongside her husband at the rw handily cleaning up all loose ends all these overcomplicated spy theories are simply looking for evidence thats not there even in the books sybell westerlings only role was making sure jeyne did not get pregnant talisa and jeyne in fact isnt going to be a lesson about how clever tywin is the red wedding itself is that its a lesson that robb won on the battlefield but lost in bed"
"Lord Varys",2013-04-30,"there are way too many hints now that talisa is actually working for tywina distant lannister cousin herself to ignore it the really interesting thing is for example why did no one in kings landing ever comment ondiscuss robbs stupid decision to marry a foreigner she did care a lot about those lannister boys who were removed from being the twin sons of ser kevan lannister to being more remote cousins the offspring of the brother of lord tywins greatgrandfather if i remember correctly this way they may actually be unaware that talisa maegyr is related to them the guy from the youtube video above assumed talisas father may be this ser reginald lannister from the show who only exists there this could make sense talisas mission may have started as her being a spy but it may turn into a great tragedy she may have fallen genuinely in love with robb and her suggestion to return north could be seen as a sign that she may try to save his life and put an end to the war when robb decides to attack casterly rock instead she seems to be afraidterrified and she really does know way too much about the lannister men to assume that she has no connections whatsoever to anyone in the west it could also highlight tywins ruthlessness if he is not going to tell walder frey that talisa maegyr stark is related to him it would be problematic to do so anyway since talisa is the very reason why walder frey is going to betray robb and if he is going to keep the red wedding from talisa as well in the books the westerlings also had no clue tywin may give the freys instructions to take talisa alive just as catelyn was supposed to be taken alive but if she knows nothing of the things to come and if she is really in love with robb by now she may very well die trying to protectsave robbs life just as catelyn is going to die"

"teemo",2013-04-29,"okay same as alwaysthis is supposed to be a place where you can rant and rant and nitpick about whatever you want no nitpick is too big or too small if you hate people criticizing the show its probably not a thread for youi actually found this to be my favorite episode of the season i think because so much was ripped straight from the books  always better dialoguei guess i found the loras and oliver thing a little random and weird kind of a lazy way for the writers to get lf to find out stuff plus the loras i knew from the book didnt seem too interested in anyone else shortly after renlys death he seemed miserably cynical once again not so thrilled with stannis stuff they introduced his family way too late like they were locked in a dungeon for over a season or something shireen is so cute though"
"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-30,"shireens hair not being black now moving on and sleeping with someone else is definitely not something out of the ordinary but it does tarnish loras love for renly and the whole scene seemed rather rushed and out of character for him in some ways tyrionolenna was pointless apart from olenna being awesome tywin pronouncing it as tyrell last episode and tierell this episode make up your mind only one you know nothing jon snow dead babies was a bit wtf but overall i really liked the stannisselyseshireen scenes thats all that comes to mind for now and most of those nitpicks are pretty minor"

"Ramsay Gimp",2013-04-29,"even though it was all new material the scenes on dragonstone were some of the best with stannis and his familyfollowers so far they managed to be disturbing and touching at the same time illustrating perfectly the miserable existence these characters endure on dragonstone its easy to see why they so easily fall under the spell of the red woman  she brings some life to the place and distracts them from their depressing livesdepicting stannis as wanting to have a connection with his wife may differ from the cold dismissive stannis we get in the books but i enjoyed it anyway the sons in the jars will likely come off as overthetop to some but i thought it added a lot to selyses character again it was creepy and moving at the same time his attempt to see shireen and offer some parental comfort and failing miserably was so stannis the guy just cant handle social situations especially with women"

"Areo Speedwagon",2013-04-29,"season 1  religionsupernatural is experienced through black magic w mmd then dragons are born white walkers open the season ice zombie in episode 8 i thinkseason 2  religionsupernatural is experienced mainly through melisandre shadow baby in episode 4 was a true wtf moment for tv viewers and readers alike i deal with bran later there never seemed to be an underlying belief system or dogma attached to the warlocks so i count that as a form of black magic white walkers again early in season 2 and then again to close out the season but the main religious takeaway from season 2 i think was the red god season 3  more rhllor beric selyse melisandre and dragons i think this is going to be rhllors season as well i was hoping for more old gods once jon snow got in with the wildlings but i think i get it now we got that giants exist and we just met another warg so i think theyll continue to establish what the old gods are capable of in the north via the abilities certain humans are able to manifest this actually parallels what the showrunners did in season 2 they introduced the shadow baby and crystal ball fire gazing before they gave us a belief system which is what i think they will touch on this season with selyse having two zealots around as important a character as stannis will afford the opportunity to info dump effectively we will see bran grow stronger and weve seen the remnants of the fotfm battle to remind of the white walkers also i think this season may end with the kof  more rhllor so again the main religious takeaway from season 3 is going to be the red godseason 4  this is going to be the old gods season i think bran will progress in season 3 and well probably get a wtf moment out of him then but the belief systemreligion of the old gods will be explored in season 4 there will obviously still be rhllor white walkers because you know ice and fire and that also i think qyburn will be peppered through season 3 like he was last night to be ready to be revealed for what he truly is in season 4 lastly the way the capabilities of rhllor were shown in 2 then the old gods capabilities were shown in 3 i think maybe the drown gods capabilities will be shown in 4 im not sure if well meet all three uncles in the show it was never established that the man who baptized theon in season 2 was aeron right so they could hypothetically cast someone else i think the way were going to be introduced to the old gods via the wildlings then realize that bran is their emissary later so too i think well get introduced maybe to aeron first to learn about the drown god thenseason 5  i think this is going to be the drown gods season i think martin has something in store for us in the next two books with the drown god i read the books once and very fast but i didnt really walk away thinking about the drown god but i noticed the histories and lore of westeros on the box sets deals a fair amount with the greyjoys and the drown god in the age of heroes so maybe well learn more about the drown god when victarion sails to dany hell mention what hes leaving behind and giving up as he accepts the red religionthere are probably chronology issues with this i encourage you to point them out to me"

"Fuse Prime",2013-04-23,"im just going to take a stab at a couple of the obvious guesses as to what happens this episode kbf  literal theme of episode tormund explains to jon what the free folk call red heads kbf jon and ygrittes romance starts sandor kills beric thoros revives beric kbf rob beheads karstark tyrion and sansa are betrothed davos bolton perhaps receives a letter from tywin from the promos it doesnt seem we will be getting any essos or bran im actually glad to see more of the free folk and riverrun the return of davos is refreshing as well none of my unsullied friends understand how good that storyline gets thoughts"

margaery or olenna discussing the proposed marriage to sansa with him there was a scene in one of the featured videos where a clearly angry loras storms away from margaery and olenna at a dinner table <U+0080><U+0093> maybe we see that heresansa watching the ship with the mockingbird sail indicates that littlefinger will leave for the eyrie in this episode it would be extremely strange if he were to promise sansa he would try to smuggle her out of king<U+0080><U+0099>s landing then take off for the eyrie without any followup so odds are good that he<U+0080><U+0099>ll share at least one scene

seems safe to assume he<U+0080><U+0099>ll sit this week out the episode 8 synopsis hints that sam and gilly meet coldhands the slayer scene will happen sometime between now and then but i doubt that it will be this weekbran and the reedssynopsis nothingpromo nothingrecap video nothingspeculation as i noted last week the problem with predicting any bran scenes prequeenscrown is that they<U+0080><U+0099>re entirely disconnected from any other story arc and therefore can go almost anywhere in the continuity so unless we get some indication from the promotional materials we really have no idea when this group of characters will appear and this week we don<U+0080><U+0099>t have that that being said at a certain point they do need to start fleshing out the reeds more  particularly meera i wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t be surprised if we got a brief scene of these characters on the road possibly hinting at osha and meera<U+0080><U+0099>s rivalry we might see a hint of bran starting to develop a crush on meera now that his character<U+0080><U+0099>s been aged up that element is a little more viable than it was in the books or meera telling the story of the knight of the laughing tree but again there<U+0080><U+0099>s no concrete reason to think any of that will happen this weekdaeneryssynopsis nothingpromo dany and the unsullied camped at some kind of oasis the

informantspeculation daenerys will speak with grey worm and we<U+0080><U+0099>ll get a little more insight into the mindset of the unsullied by as he tells her how they select their names rather than leave for westeros dany will decide to march on to yunkaii find it very intriguing that the recap video explicitly reminds us of jorah<U+0080><U+0099>s previous history of informing on daenerys how that will play into this episode remains to be seen it<U+0080><U+0099>s far too early for daenerys to learn about his previous betrayal since we know that she sends him on a mission to infiltrate meereen and ultimately banishes him i don<U+0080><U+0099>t think that the writers will play that card before she even reaches yunkai especially since dany conquers that city through entirely different meansmy guess is that we<U+0080><U+0099>ll get a scene between jorah and barristan where they air their distrust of one another and discuss their shared history of conflicted loyalties to both the iron throne and now daenerys barristan will call out jorah as an informant to his face rather than explicitly outing his betrayal to daenerys and question whether jorah is still angling for a pardon as lord commander of the kingsguard barristan had a seat on robert<U+0080><U+0099>s small council he would obviously be aware that jorah was on varys<U+0080><U+0099> payroll jorah will swear that those days are done that he is only loyal to dany now and barristan will grudgingly agree to give him a chance to prove it perhaps this concealment serve as a reason for dany to test barristan as well when she eventually finds out next season obviously she won<U+0080><U+0099>t be sending him into the sewers on the basis of his service to robert as he<U+0080><U+0099>s already unveiled himself to her and she seems to have accepted his loyalty for nowlastly there<U+0080><U+0099>s also the matter of jorah<U+0080><U+0099>s lingering feelings for dany i have to believe that since we didn<U+0080><U+0099>t get the scene where he kisses her before her arrival in astapor it<U+0080><U+0099>s been shifted to later in the season probably not this episode though <U+0080><U+0093> it might make more sense for that conversation to happen after dany meets daario and jorah sees how taken she is with him edited by somanyvows 26 april 2013  0144 pm"
"Dove",2013-04-26,"im looking forward to the karstark thing quite a bit not to see the kids die or anything but to see robb finally making decisions and doing something kingly besides chastise his doofy uncle it should be a pretty powerful group of scenes hopefully after this they start to put an emphasis on a nontreacherous bannerman or two lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol is anybody else hoping that they dont have jaime tell brienne why he killed aerys in this episode it just seems like theyre rushing through his arc way too quickly especially since the bear pit scene is in episode 7 the synopsis for episode 6 states that roose decides what to do with jaime in that episode thus giving them time to put his confession in episode 6 instead i think if they show qyburn treating his wounds and a conversation between jaime and roose that should be enough for this episodei hadnt thought of that what does jaime even do inbetween the bear pit and arriving to kings landing after the pw unless they change up his sequence of events or slow things down big time he and brienne are gonna be in limbo for a while id like to think that theyll use some of the extra time to squeeze in the harrenhal roose bits that were cut from s2"

"Newstar",2013-04-26,"wow somanyvows has put everything together so nicely for the plotlinesspeculation the tyrell plan to marry sansa off to loras will drive the bulk of the king<U+0080><U+0099>s landing story for this episode since loras didn<U+0080><U+0099>t appear last week there will likely be at least a quick scene of either margaery or olenna discussing the proposed marriage to sansa with him there was a scene in one of the featured videos where a clearly angry loras storms away from margaery and olenna at a dinner table <U+0080><U+0093> maybe we see that hereyes i wonder if thats in reaction to a possible marriage to cersei remember 3x06 synopsis stated that tywin was planning strategic unions as in more than one which might explain why we get the tywinolenna scene in 3x06 where shes pissed and snaps his quill pen and if it falls in the next episode i do expect there to be a suck it up princesstype scene where loras is ordered to marry either sansa or cersei which explains why olenna looks so unconcerned when he throws the tantrum and storms away because she knows hell knuckle under and do as she wants i dont know that being ordered to marry sansa as opposed to cersei is tantrumworthy but this is loras were talking aboutsansa watching the ship with the mockingbird sail indicates that littlefinger will leave for the eyrie in this episode it would be extremely strange if he were to promise sansa he would try to smuggle her out of king<U+0080><U+0099>s landing then take off for the eyrie without any followup so odds are good that he<U+0080><U+0099>ll share at least one scene where he tries to discuss their departure only to learn that sansa would rather marry loras and go off to highgarden perhaps this is when littlefinger tips off tywin as patrickstormborn notes there<U+0080><U+0099>s a brief scene in critic<U+0080><U+0099>s trailer 2 of littlefinger smirking while walking away from varys 022 <U+0080><U+0093> if everything does go to hell in this episode then littlefinger will surely spare a moment to rub it in his adversary<U+0080><U+0099>s facesteiner and i have been speculating that lfs plan has so many holes in itif he leaves kl and sansa goes missing at the same time everyone will know that lf has her and has committed treason for onemaybe this whole plan to supposedly take sansa with him was an elaborate ruse that lf never intended to follow through on he deliberately leaked information to ros knowing that varys would flip out and try to thwart him by arranging a marriage alliance for loras and sansa knowing that sansa would leap at the opportunity to marry loras and refuse his offer to leave with him and that he could take that information and leak it to tywin as a show of loyalty to the crown knowing that tywin would betroth tyrion to sansa as a result lf leaves for the vale openly committed to wooing lysa and sansa is trapped in a horrifying marriage that will make sure that shes desperate the next time he offers his assistance it would be a diabolical plani had thought that tywin wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t learn about the proposed marriage until episode 6 when he <U+0080><U+009C>plans strategic unions<U+0080><U+009D> but the promo certainly seems to indicate that he<U+0080><U+0099>s aware of it and is devising a counterplan tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s unhappy reaction seems to indicate that tywin has told him to marry sansa maybe he stalls on consenting to the plan this week but gives in in episode 6pretty sure the conversation in the promo was the same conversation in the books where tywin tells tyrion he is to marry sansa yes i think this is likely the last klrelated scene of the episode too you will marry sansa stark tyrion and soon probably not the last scene of the episode though the engagement will likely be made official in episode 6 once tywin has successfully wrangled olenna into agreeing to a lorascersei match leaving shae and sansa to flip out in episode 7i suspect that just as in the books tyrion and sansa wont actually have any direct interaction with each other until the wedding itself ohhhhhh its going to be brutal fetches popcornregardless we know that everything will be out in the open by episode 7 because shae will be <U+0080><U+009C>chafing at tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s new situation<U+0080><U+009D> and sansa will be <U+0080><U+009C>fretting about her prospects<U+0080><U+009D>yeah maybe shae and sansa find out at the same time since i doubt shae would wait an episode before hitting the roof this suggests sansa has a bit more advance warning than she had in the books unless the wedding gown scene in the books is in 3x07 with no actual wedding ceremony until 3x08the two discarded titles for 3x07 autumn storms and chains sound like theres plenty of weddingrelated angst in that episode maybe sansa and shae dont find out until then although it seems like the wedding will be a much bigger affair in the show than in the books meaning it seems like it would be a tricky thing to keep secret from anyone let alone shaeon page 2 of this thread newstar mentions the scene that tyrion shares with olenna that was seen in one the featurettes im not sure that will be in this weeks episode but if it is it could mean a couple of things tyrion in his new role as master of coin attempting to get the tyrells to help fund the royal weddingim thinking thats what the conversation is about tyrion says something like were at war trying to angle for a reduced wedding budget maybeor tyrion attempting to smooth over the whole sansa marriage issue after tywin throws a wrench in thingsim thinking tywin is actually the one who tries to smooth things over with olenna although knowing its tywin its probably more that he tries to steamroller olenna into signing on to a lorascersei engagement i can only imagine how well thats going to go overthe big question is whether or not we<U+0080><U+0099>ll get the bath scene in this episode the content of that scene with jaime telling brienne his true reasons for killing aerys certainly fits with the whole <U+0080>jaime is judged<U+0080><U+0099> line from the synopsis in the books however the whole reason jaime and brienne are getting a bath is to prepare them for their dinner with roose bolton and the dinner scene is almost certain to be in episode 6 the synopsis for which states <U+0080><U+009C>roose bolton decides what to do with jaime lannister<U+0080><U+009D> i<U+0080><U+0099>d lean slightly towards the bath scene being saved for next week but it could go

"Newstar",2013-04-27,"i feel like any of robbs bannermen introduced at this point would basically be like the got equivalent of star trek redshirts oh no there goes some guy we met three episodes ago horror it would be better if wed had a few through the end of s1 and through s2 although i understand why the writers might not have wanted to do that edited by newstar 27 april 2013  1047 am"

"King Tommen",2013-04-28,"to be clear about cogmans role its to be the encyclopedic resource of all things bookrelated for example if they are thinking about how a certain character should be introduced they go to him to recall exactly how it was done in the books this is not the same thing as keeping things as faithful as possible to the books thats a big assumption all of the people involved are huge fans of the books he just has read them more than anyone else that doesnt mean that he would never have a suggestion on how to adapt something differently i think brian himself would disagree with the notion that its some kind of tugofwar with him and dd where he wants everything to be 100 faithful and they always want to change things hes responsible for guiding out the arcs of arya bran and stannisdavosmel this season so it would stand to reason that he probably came up or helped flesh out most of the major beats with these arcs the mel going to the bwb for gendry is almost assuredly a change that he was a huge part of seeing as it involves the two stories hes running"
