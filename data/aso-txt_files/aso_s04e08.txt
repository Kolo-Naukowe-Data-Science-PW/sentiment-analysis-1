1	Ran	2014-06-01	Non-spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who've not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion, taking each episode as it comes.
This topic should open automatically when the show begins airing.
2	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-01	Wow!
3	lostinwesteros	2014-06-01	Holy Shit!
Oberyn was awesome!  But I may not ever get that image of what the Mountain did to the Red Viper's head out of my mind.  For me, worse than the Red Wedding, and that's saying a lot.
4	MissHarington	2014-06-02	Just.. Oh my god. Thanks to spoiler I knew what would happen at the fight. But that... Ew. Disgusting. I nearly cried. I am traumatised.
Â 
Arya was awesome. The Hound's face. Priceless. Her laughter made me laugh.
Â 
Sansa had truly something of Katniss Everdeen. She now understands the game.
Â 
Daenerys. So cold. Whew.

5	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-02	I just realised after 17 episodes of showing Winterfell in the opening credits we finally get a glimpse of it again.
6	SerChristian	2014-06-02	Good episode.
I'm reading the books, but haven't gotten to the duel yet. Hoped Oberyn would finish of the Mountain, but that surely didn't happen. Really nice fight, but what a gruesome ending. Poor Oberyn and Tyrion. 
Roose Bolton, Warden of the North. He should have enough to do in the following time with Mance's army coming.
Can't wait for the next episode.

7	Thelastsanson	2014-06-02	Alfie was amazing once again as Theon/Reek. It was hard not flinch or get tense as he tried to make them yield.Â
8	KingintheNorth99	2014-06-02	Even though I knew it was coming, I still can't get over the shock of Oberyn's death, what a great scene though!
9	valirpaz	2014-06-02	Wow. I certainly did not expect that. Good that I did not bet on the outcome of the fight. Too bad we've already lost Oberyn again. But surely somebody must save Tyrion...
Â 
I like where they're going with Sansa's story, that's going to be interesting. Bride to be to the king of the Vale who's being educated by his stepfather who happens to have a thing for his niece / daughter in law.
Â 
Can somebody (no spoilers) explain to me how you interpreted Arya's laughter?

Â 
Hysterical. She escaped with a Night's Watch convoy hoping to reach her family at Winterfell. The journey is dangerous. The convoy gets destroyed and she's taken prisoner. She witnesses torture and fears she'll be next. She's given the same clothes she'll use for seasons, and maybe years, to come. She escapes and still tries to get to her family. She's captured by the BWB, but they want to ransom her to her family at Riverrun. They sell Gendry to Mel, so she escapes (again). She's captured by the Hound, but the Hound also wants to ransom her to Riverrun. So they go in a dangerous trip. But her family has left Riverrun, so they need to continue farther away to the Twins. When she's at the gates, the RW erupts around her and she sees the Freys parading Robb's decapitated body with Greywind's head sticked on top. They leave that dangerous place. The Hound decides to ransom her to her aunt, her last living relative who's alive and rich. So they go in yet another dangerous journey. They finally make it. And now that she's finally safe, that she's finally reunited with some relative, that they finally succeed... her aunt died three days ago.
Â 
So yes, she just laughs. What else can she do with the pile of shit being so incredibly high and hopes so utterly destroyed at every turn?
11	Bib Fortuna	2014-06-02	It's a "You've got to be fucking kidding me" laugh.

Agreed. At this point, what else can she do? She's just declared herself to be Ayra Stark after being so many other people at this point, and it turns out...she's still screwed.
13	XTwipz	2014-06-03	HOLY SHIT WHAT THE F*** OF THAT
Â 
The Mountain was dead. Oberyn threw his lance in his body !Â He was supposed to die and not to stand up and...! How the hell he was able to crush his head... I loved Oberyn...
Anyway great week episode though... Hard wait for the next one !

14	Zigster	2014-06-03	For me the duel was a bit disappointing. By now I know that a main "good guy" is probably going to die a brutal and humiliating death at around this point of the season. So it wasn't very shocking that it happened. But I felt like the head "popping" was over the top. It was like the writers had sat around and brainstormed about how they could make the death as shocking as possible. Punching him in the face and caving in his skull, or smacking his skull against the ground, would have been better imo. Squishing his head like an orange just didn't work for me. And that's regardless of whether that's the way it happens in the books or whether it could theoretically be done irl, it just looked too ridiculous in the context of the show imo. I was also getting strong Princess Bride vibes and the whole taunting the enemy when they "appear" to be beaten and then them coming to life and kicking your arse, was a bit of a cliche. I'm sure everyone saw that coming from a mile away, which makes me wonder how the hell this great warrior Oberyn didn't. Yeah, he was emotional, he's still a highly trained warrior who should know better.
Â 
Not sure about Ramsay, don't know whether I really give a crap about his story arc. But maybe it's really just a pit stop for Theon. But then Theon seems like he's down and out and now we're following Ramsay primarily and not Theon. Frankly not sure how Ramsay's still alive after fighting Theons sisters gang without any armour. It was nice that he got made a "Bolton" and everything, but yeah... still unconvinced.
Â 
I really like Roose Bolton though, and I feel like Roose is sort of the Northern version of Tywin, and that could be a good rivalry. I'd prefer to see more of him instead.
Â 
The Ironborn really suck in the show, which is a shame because Theon's dad seemed like a badass. It's funny, because Theon taking Winterfell seems like the most impressive thing that any of the Ironborn have done in the show, even though he totally cocked it up. They're damn quick to mutiny and surrender, Ramsay took them out really easily, disappointing.
Â 
Danny sending Jorah away was a stupid move. Why does she think she can trust the dude who was the Kingsguard Commander for Robert and (briefly) Joffrey, and a sellsword who cut off his commanders heads at the drop of a hat? Jorah saved her from the poisoning, and has been by far her most valuable advisor, and risked his life for her about a million times. It's obvious he's totally pussy whipped and devoted to her. There seemed to be a suggestion that Jorah was involved in the death of Danny's child as well. I guess Danny probably would love to believe that all her stupid decisions that led to the death of her child and Drogo were a result of Jorah betraying her, and not just her own stupidity. Maybe I'm being too cynical.
Â 
I don't care about the "romance" between Grey Worm and Missandre. I feel like the show already spends too much time analyzing the sexual desires of men who've had their bits cut off with Varys and Theon. Don't need another whole sub-plot devoted to that topic imo. Happy to see more of their characters, but not in a romance sub plot. Hopefully this was a one off.
Â 
Bad changes for Dany's story all round.
Â 
I love Jaimie and Tyrion, not sure about the whole beetles thing, but I like seeing them get some quality bro time.
Â 
Nice to see Sansa growing up a bit. Didn't like how Little Finger seemed to manage to get himself where he was at the mercy of Sansa though, amateur hour? Was good to see Baelish take charge of the Vale and Robin though. Baelish knows what's up, and could definitely be a proper contender with the Vale behind him. Sansa in the black dress was a bit obvious though.
Â 
Hound and Arya are just great. Worried about his bite wound though, sounds like it's infected badly, and they've just been humanising him in the last few episodes, which is what they generally do just before they kill characters off. That's going to suck balls.

Thanks for explaining. You're right, makes sense.
Although generally I don't see, how this should change their plans. Yes the aunt's dead but that still means that she's got her cousin in the vale and shouldn't make it less safe for her. And if you apply traditional nobility values her cousin would still reward the hound. But I'm sure there'll be an event why that won't happen.

Wow...I thought it was just because The Hound wasn't going to get his reward/ransom money.
17	mitch726	2014-06-03	Exploding head, wow, i just kept shouting at the TV, KILL HIM ALREADY, stop gloating because i could see it coming:(
18	Peter George Stewart	2014-06-04	He was neither "taunting his enemy" nor "gloating", nor was he "showboating" or anything like that.Â  He showboated a bit at the beginning of the fight when he twirled his spear, but he pretty quickly got down to business, and defeated the Mountain quite handily.
Â 
The problem was that HE WANTED TO GET A CONFESSION FROM THE MOUNTAIN SO IT WOULD BE OUT IN THE OPEN THAT TYWIN ORDERED ELIA'S DEATH.
Â 
And he wanted that so bad, he was focussed on it so much, that he let his guard slip.
Â 
However, he did get a bit of what he wanted.Â  While everyone "knew" that the Mountain killed Elia's children (who were potential Targaryen heirs at the time of the rebellion) and raped and murdered Elia, it was up to that point a rumour.Â  (It happened during the sack of King's Landing, so chaos, so no-one really sure.)
Â 
Now it's confessed fact, out in the open; that's the horror and irony of the Mountain confessing it while he's popping Oberyn's melon. Not quite the connection between Tywin and the Mountain's act that Oberyn might have preferred, but at least some damage has been done to the Lannister name.

Some damage to the Lannister name... Yeah, but I still think that it's a poor consolation for what happened... May the Mountain dies and it would be better anyway...

Your comment is hilarious! I haven't thought of that. Guess sometimes the short answer is just as true.
22	echidna	2014-06-05	I really liked the way Sansa blossomed into Margery-style-Sansa as soon as she had nobles that supported her. Lord Royce had even been at Winterfell and The Vales nobles all said they hate Lannisters.
A quick adjustment of Aunty Lysa's clothes and some 'hide the Tully look' hairdye and she a new person.
Or closer to the person she would have been without being a victim.
Go Sansa!
23	XTwipz	2014-06-05	Or closer to the person she would have been without being a victim.
Go Sansa!


I totally agree with you! Sansa has been a victim the whole time til now. She's powerful and she know what Littlefinger sees in her (like a lost love of a dead woman who was his mother) if you see what I mean. So she has some sort of power on him. And she doesn't have to obey to orders anymore.

I think you are over-estimating Sansa and under-estimating Baelish, he is probably one of Â the only guys who wouldn't let his feeling take over his plans. I think he tried to make Sansa trust and care for him, and in that he succeeded.Â
25	valirpaz	2014-06-05	I agree with Ormurin. It would be an interesting change if Baelish was defeated by his feelings (kissing her was definitely not so smart) but from what we've seen so far that would be quite a change of character.


Sansa has been a victim the whole time til now.


No, not the whole time. Initially she was not Joffrey's victim, she wanted to be his queen. And she wanted it so badly that she sacrificed that boy at the river who hit Joffrey in a fight, instead of saving him by telling the truth. Sacrificed the Direwolf, still kept her mouth shut. In that I think we could already see that when she really wants something she can be reckless.

I agree that Season 1 Sansa had shown fangs which Season 2&3 Sansa has pulled back, but she didn't sacrifice Mycah (who never hit Joffrey) nor she suspected her wolf would get killed.
27	valirpaz	2014-06-05	Â but she didn't sacrifice Mycah (who never hit Joffrey) nor she suspected her wolf would get killed.


As far as I remember there was an inquiry on what had happened and Arya screamed against Joffrey that he is a liar and implored Sansa to tell the truth - but she didn't. So I do hold that she put Joffrey over truth. I would have to re-watch the episode to assess whether she could have known that Mycah was in danger or not. But even if she had not suspected that the wolf would be killed, at the latest when they announced it, she could have shouted: "Stop. I will tell you what really happened."

I don't remember the exact dialog either, so it may be that Sansa's lack of testimony was indeed putting Mycah's life in jeopardy now that you mention it. Her actual testimony, of course, had no bearing on his dead, but it's the intent we're considering.
You're right about the last part. It might be idiocy or a conscious decision.

Â 
Given the world GRRM depicts, Arya blurting that out could just as easily be seen as imprudent, rather than Sansa being cowardly - in fact, that could actually be seen as the kernel of Sansa being more of a player.
30	valirpaz	2014-06-06	I have not read any books, so I am not sure how much I can assess the world. But from what I have watched I agree. Arya's behaviour was visibly imprudent, impolite in this surrounding; there would have certainly been an acceptable middle way. Sansa's silence as said I did not perceive as cowardice but calculation. (The readers probably know. )

He taunted a lot - staying just out of arms reach, well until he didn't. We are left with suspicions that Tywin was behind the murders, raised by the Martells, ie right where we started. Gregor was a tool - as was Lorch in the books.
33	Jack Bauer 24	2014-07-27	I just realised after 17 episodes of showing Winterfell in the opening credits we finally get a glimpse of it again.

17 episodes? It's been in every opening credit, hasn't it?
34	MrToine	2014-10-01	I watched the 8th episode there are 3 days. What say ? It's incredible ! I would not have thought that Oberyn would die !
The fight is very gore but is very well done. I hope just that Tyrion does not die after this fight

41	Emperoreddy	2014-06-01	Jorah getting kicked out tonight it looks like

46	Natalie Underfoot	2014-06-01	Um, isn't she in Meereen herself?
She sent him to Yunkai
47	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-01	Um, isn't she in Meereen herself?


Â 
Indeed.
48	Emperoreddy	2014-06-01	She sent him to Yunkai


Â 
I think she just sent Hiz.
49	WinterKing	2014-06-01	Moat Cailin!
50	Hakairyu	2014-06-01	She sent him to Yunkai


Well Yunkai ain't that far, just 163 slave girls... or slavers... Or whatever Dany marks miles with.
51	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-01	Or whatever Dany marks miles with.


Â 
Usurper dogs?
52	Travy1991	2014-06-01	I really hope that they don't kill off Gilly.Â 


Â 
It seems unlikely as they've made her a regular this season. Of course, they could troll us but I'd sooner see them add a popular character like Oberyn to the main cast and shock the show viewers rather than adding a likeable but not hugely interesting character like Gilly. And of course, Sam needs to put his pink mast somewhere.
53	Iron Maiden Islands	2014-06-01	Â 
I think she just sent Hiz.


I thought she was sending Daario as well

Well sir, I'd think Dany might have a shortage on usurper dogs at the moment. They only grow in Westeros and currently they are what I'd call "endangered".
56	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-06-01	Time for them to win a small fight to see the whole army north of the Wall
57	Raksha 2014	2014-06-01	Ygritte let her live; so we can forgive Ygritte for slaughtering innocent villagers and whores, I guess.
58	Natalie Underfoot	2014-06-01	So much for some theories the madam would be val
Also the redemption of ygritte begins

66	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-01	They're so sos so so so so sos os ososos so so cute ;______;

68	Emperoreddy	2014-06-01	Oh these two are just precious.
69	Hakairyu	2014-06-01	oh my god, kill this lovestory and throw it to fire


Seriously, I'd take SanSan shipping over this.
70	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-06-01	Great debate about Grey Worm's Pillar and stones.


Too funny
71	Hakairyu	2014-06-01	And that, folks, is what happens when an episode is too short. Though I do have to admit it was sort of cute.

They need to establish a new romance since Ygritte/Jon and Shae/Tyrion are gong down the drain. Don't worry we still have Gilly and Sam.

78	Newstar	2014-06-01	Â 
Would rather watch them than anything involving Ramsay Snow.
Â 
I actually like the Grey Worm/Missandei relationship.


Â 
Me, too. It makes Grey Worm and Missandei something other than props in Dany's storyline, the actors have great chemistry, what's not to like?
Â 
Childe Theon To The Dark Tower Came.
Â 
A++ literary reference.

79	HouseAllyrion	2014-06-01	Reek sure slipped into Theon pretty flawlessly
80	booknerd2	2014-06-01	I don't like how Theon just made a miraculous mental/physical recovery. Odd. He was in bad shape last time we saw him or so.
81	Hakairyu	2014-06-01	"They will treat you as well as they treated me." LOL
82	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-01	Well sir, I'd think Dany might have a shortage on usurper dogs at the moment. They only grow in Westeros and currently they are what I'd call "endangered". 


Â 
And now we know why Dany is still in Essos. She simply can't finhd the way to the Seven Kingdoms due to her lack of Westerosi road and sea marks.
83	jons nissa	2014-06-01	wondering where they're going with this greyworm/missandei thing but yes, they have great chemistry. and yeah, i've wondered about the pillars and stone thing, as well.
Â 
also would rather watch them rather than ramsey snow. i hate all things ramsey Â
84	Emperoreddy	2014-06-01	Oh DAMN that isn't pretty. Man Theon is wrecked.

Aside from Winterfell, The Vale AND the Riverlands?
133	booknerd2	2014-06-01	A little taste of what's to come? LF does have the idea to go balls to the wall to reveal Sansa Stark as Sansa Stark to his advantage in the next book? Still marinating...

Â Yes, yes it is, and I like it...I think

Though that's sort of the thing in the books, take Nestor Royce for example, he doesn't really believe the story but he really really wants to.

171	Hakairyu	2014-06-01	...Seriously, is that the best Dany they got in the auditions?
172	Arya'sSanctuary	2014-06-01	What I like about the Sans change is that she knew how important her name was and she isn't going to let Littlefinger hide her she's still wanted by the royals, though.
173	NightStark	2014-06-01	Probably the best bit of acting by her this season.

Â 
Â 
While Sansa vented her true hatred of what has been done to her, I have no doubt that Littlefinger prepped her for her testimony. Â It could still be that Sansa is operating in self-preservation mode; convinced that Littlefinger is her best defense against the Lannisters/charge of regicide, and she cannot let him --- HOLY HECK! Â She wasn't prepped!
189	KalibakCruel	2014-06-01	So far, moving this Sansa.

Sansa - admitted identity, praise LF for saving her, told the Lords Lysa jumped herself
Jorah - banished (Selmy got a copy of RObert's pardon)
Ramsey - took the Moat (thanks to Reek/Theon) and now he's a Bolton.

Â 
It sucked.

327	Zman1863	2014-06-01	Not sure what to think of this episode. Visually very nice. But there were so many scenes that were just wtf moments. I suppose the fight was adequate, but I think it's conclusion came off as a bit abrupt. The violence of it also struck me as strange, though I guess it wasn't exactly divergent.Â

368	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-01	The duel broke my heart all over again. Thought I'd be alright after having read it all those years ago, but goddamn, nothing can prepare you for the eye gouging. I realize characters have been through worse in Martin's universe, but it's such a horrific end for such a fantastic character. I kinda felt like the fight cheorography was a little weak though, honestly. Gregor looked like a clumsy oaf for the majority of the fight. I loved that they kept all the best lines though.
369	HouseAllyrion	2014-06-01	Boltons, misadventures of Arya and The Hound, and of the course the last scene with Viper vs. Clegane were awesome but I really couldn't get over creepy Baelish coming into Sansa's room asking her if she knew what he wanted *innuendos implied!* then the following day she's in a low cut dress looking all coy. Stop it. What are they doing to Sansa

It was a suggestion, I'm not really complaining.  Overall, I was very pleased with the fight.
385	l2 0 5 5	2014-06-01	Viper vs Mountain was a great scene. I feel like it couldn't of been done any better. Hearing Oberyn scream when he is normally very confident was alarming.
Â 
Not a fan of the Grey Worm/Missandei bit. It just seems unnecessary and a waste of time. Â 
Â 
Jorah's departure finally arrived. Weird to think that him and Tyrion will be paired up shortly.
Â 
I liked the Ramsay scene where Roose declares him a Bolton.
Â 
Happy to see Grenn, Pyp, and Edd. I feel like they're underrated. Â
386	MoIaF	2014-06-01	How did you guys like the Jorah exile scene?
I thought it was pretty goo overall, Emilia did well, and Ian was excellent.
387	piles	2014-06-01	Lots of negativity in this thread. It always amuses me when people moan about scenes whilst they're on (i.e. the beetles). You could actually watch them through, listen to the dialogue, and then compose your thoughts, rather than just splurging out 'lol b0ring giv me obryn brain'...
Â 
I liked the episode overall, lots of strong scenes. The Ramsey/Roose stuff was great, I thought, and the trial itself was fantastic. I enjoyed the Missandei-Grey Worm part, nice to see that they're making some effort to flesh out those two characters along with Daario and I think it's working at the moment. The chemistry is there, and I like the actor playing Grey Worm... he seems very sincere. The Jorah scene - part of me wonders if Clarke is one of the actors who knows some stuff about her character's future and, as a result, is playing up the crazy evil queen stuff more than we see in the books... Perhaps a turn from good to bad for Dany?
Â 
The stuff with the Stark girls... I'm usually okay with changes from book to screen, because it doesn't (for me, usually) diminish the source material and it's not as if the books will stop existing after the episode. As long as the atmosphere, tone, and the thematic intent stay the same, it doesn't really matter to me the exact date of Ramsey's legitimization or the order of events in Slaver's Bay. I think there might be a problem in the Stark girls outright identifying themselves as such in that it really conflicts with the gritty realism that Martin creates and that the show has tried to emulate. Surely they, or their guardians, see the risk in doing such a thing? It doesn't sit will with the tone of the original, for me. I think it works better for Sansa than with Arya, though... at least she seemed to 'come out' to three nobles bound to her family.
Â 
The transformation of Sansa is not such a big issue, in my opinion. She has spent a long time watching some of the masters of the Game; Littlefinger, Margary, the Queen of Thorns, Tyrion, Cersei (who, at least in the show, I guess isn't quite as batshit or inept before we get a POV)... It makes sense that she's learn tricks after that much observation, and she wouldn't have the chance to showcase them without letting her shield down, which she obviously was not prepared to do in King's Landing. I think it's interesting that we're getting Sansa progression and in such a rapid manner; she's been static for such a long time.

392	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-01	OMG what a change..... not sure I like this... She is still going to protect him.......

Not protect, USE him.  Sansa comes into her own without strum & drang  of  Books.  I like it.  Fits with older Sansa taking charge & more like her Mom--- without the " kill everyone" bent.  Don't think Arya and Hound are getting in.  Another Stark family near miss.  Also San San reunion missed.
Oh we just had 4.0 EarthQuake in Los Angeles as I was typing this

Amen. To. That. Â I'm just glad that I knew when to turn my head away.Â  Â

395	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-01	How did you guys like the Jorah exile scene?
I thought it was pretty goo overall, Emilia did well, and Ian was excellent.



I loved the image of Daenerys not even being able to look him in the eye.
396	booknerd2	2014-06-01	I wondered why the Hound's wound hadn't festered yet. Now I know why.
Â 
Oh, I think it is going to happen. I commented earlier in the thread. I think, the way this season and the writing is going, that the Hound and Sansa at least get a glimpse of each other. So probably ep. 9 and then they leave the Vale and he collapses on the road and she does leave him under the tree.
And he feels even worse because he was so close to his bird.
Â 
Not sure if Arya and Hound get a glimpse of LF or SW. Also, not sure if Sansa sees Arya and Hound. Might be one-sided. But it would fit with the whole Sansa id revealed early. Or, Arya and the Hound find out it is her there, never see her, but are thwarted TRYING to get to Sansa. Meaning, stuff doesn't go their way AGAIN and as usual, and they leave the Vale.

397	MoIaF	2014-06-01	well it was pretty much gore in the book as well. But this was a bit extreme... I think it did need to be done but I just wasn't gonna look I have the hubby for that he looked and even he said it was ack.

True, but just hearing it was enough for me.  
There is going to be some serious killing next week. M
398	johndance	2014-06-01	Loved every part of the episode. Loved the Sansa stuff. She's playing the game now, and seems like she'll fair pretty well. So well done. It makes sense too. She's been surrounded by liars , com artists, etc for how long now? She had to catch on eventually. 
Epic trial. No one can say they weren't faithful to the books here. Bravo to D&D for taking such a great part and transferring it so amazingly well to the screen. Brilliant stuff.
399	NightStark	2014-06-01	Â 
Would you happen to have a link to this? i would like to see it. Thanks.Â 
Â 
The ending was well done.Â I knew it was coming, but DAMN I hated to see my boy go out like that. My GF was almost in tears.

I wonder if maybe Littlefinger will be the only one who sees Arya/Hound and Sansa doesn't notice them. It wouldn't be the first time in the show he's recognized Arya and not said anything.
401	MoIaF	2014-06-01	I loved the image of Daenerys not even being able to look him in the eye.

That was very well done on Emilia's part.  Her best friend, probably the only friend she's ever truly had just betrayed her in the worst possible way.
402	briantw	2014-06-01	I don't like gore. I wish they'd be more subtle, sometimes it works best to leave it up to the imagination.


Â 
That scene wasn't remotely subtle in the books either. Â The Mountain crushes Oberyn's face with a couple of punches. Â It's brutal and violent. Â 
Â 
The show did pretty much the same thing, and it worked. Â The only downside in my mind was that they changed the Mountain's lines a bit at the end. Â I really loved how he yells "THEN I PUNCHED HER FUCKING FACE IN...LIKE THIS." Â I wanted to hear that.
403	thetitansbastard	2014-06-01	I'm more inclined to think that the show is going to catch up with the books now. Â Sansa revealed to the Vale lords already??
Â 
Can't say I am a big fan The Hound and Arya showing up at the Eyrie. Â I suppose to excite the fans about a Sansa/Arya reunion only for it not to happen, which may be OK for non-readers I guess. Â Are they just going to be turned away and leave? Â Do the guards know about Sansa? Â Will they kill the Hound?
404	teej6	2014-06-01	Honestly, did we need to hear 3 mins of that beetle story. And why the Missandei/Greyworm subplot? Is there a purpose to that?Â
405	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-01	There are elements in this season which makes me believe that Benioff did not use only the begining of AFFC and ADWD and the last half of ASOS to make the show, they gave us some of WOW

Very much agree!
406	Dio Westeros-X	2014-06-01	Â 
Well there was the pic of her gouging out Pedro Pascal's eyes which has turned out to be connected to the show so I'm just going to take the stone heart as a hint:P


ahhh well i like that!
407	ohpooratlas	2014-06-01	Honestly the only things I really remember from the episode were ...
Â 
Alfie Allen's acting
Jorah's banishment
Everything in the Vale
And the final scene
Â 
Sansa may have revealed herself to the Lords Declarent but they made a point of having them promise not to reveal her identity. I think the scene at the end was her reverting back to Lord Baelish's "niece." She had the black hair after all.Â 
Â 
The duel was amazing. I covered my eyes at the end. It was so brutal. I can't even right now ...
Â 
Twitter is EXPLODING btw. It's glorious.Â
408	YouWinorYouDie	2014-06-01	Sorry I haven't read the whole thread and might have missed this but did anyone catch Oberyn's comment to Tyrion about the fighting pits?
409	Darth Pipes	2014-06-01	Wow.Â  Not a lot on TV disturbs me that that last scene sure as hell did.Â  I was wondering how they would pull that off...mission accomplished!
Â 
Another great episode.Â  A little slow on some parts in the beginning and Tyrion's beetle conversation just wouldn't end.Â  But you had some really impressive scenes and some terrific acting.
Â 
Sophie Turner was amazing.Â  Her confessing she was Sansa Stark legitimately surprised me and was a great move on her part.Â  Gave her character a lot of agency.Â  I'm very curious where things will go from here with that storyline.
Â 
Speaking of unexpected, Arya's laughter which was hilarious.
Â 
Fantastic work by Alfie Allen as always and Moat Cailin's design was very cool.Â  Liked the twisted Roose and Ramsey scene and they seemed to be playing an altered, twisted version of the King of the North score.
Â 
Add Iain Glen to the list of standout performances.Â  I'm surprised we never got Jorah kissing Dany on this show but I thought the betrayal was very well-handled.
Â 
Fantastic trial by combat and I'm going to miss Pedro Pascal.
410	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-01	A question!, Ramsay's finale scene showed the ruins of Winterfell??? That's what I thought I saw.
411	booknerd2	2014-06-01	I wonder if maybe Littlefinger will be the only one who sees Arya/Hound and Sansa doesn't notice them. It wouldn't be the first time in the show he's recognized Arya and not said anything.


Â 
Why not? Or he becomes aware they are around and sends them on their way somehow and with no drama. But I can't see that opportunistic fiend not trying to get Arya (2 Stark girls) for his own gains. Like, maybe, this is why the Hound doesn't get work if they allude to the books.

Â 
Show Gregor says 'Then I smashed her head in like this' so close enough.
413	joaozinm	2014-06-01	talking about being loyal to the books a lot of things bothered me.
Â 
First Jorah wasnt begging pardon he was demanding.
Â 
Second Arya seemed a sadic child, really...what about that laugh? The fact that she will be in the future a cold murderer dont mean she is scary and creepy.
Â 
Third. The vale Scene... really what the hell? Littlefinger looked like he is a fool that put too much trust into Sansa, and the lord declarants even fooler to buy it. Really the Vale isnt that close to the starks and they dont really care about that feeling theater.
Â 
Fourth what about all those Starks revealing themselfs?This will be so odd in the future.
Â 
Five... Lyn Corbray part on the book was one of my favorite... it was great to see how far Littlefinger had thought, and we saw a Sansa being smart enough to understand
414	Rockroi	2014-06-01	For all those people upset about Obyren Martell, I have this to say:
Â 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48H34ukFe8g
Â 
And thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what happens to overrated men who speak when they are not spoken too.Â 
Â 
Â 
I loved a lot about this episode.Â  It was great. 
Â 
What I liked:
Â 
The Queen of Thrones: The transformation of Sansa Stark from the dove that Cersei picked on at Winterfell to the dark, brooding figure oozing through the Vale has been an epic success; one of the highlights of the show.Â  D&D should be very proud of that.Â  The show slowly, carefully and with great pain and pressure made Sansa the power broker behind Petyr Baelish and not the other way around.Â  Even the way she surprised him, and the way she used the truth to manipulate everyone was epic.Â  They made Littlefinger reliant on Sansa and not Sansa reliant on LF.Â  They made her â<U+0080>¦. 
Â 
They made Sansa Stark the one who knocksâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Watching Sansa grow- even WITH her foibles, imperfections, scars and insecurities â<U+0080><U+0093> is tremendous because each step along the way has been believable.Â  She knows now what is so important to playing the Game of Thrones: know what motivates other people.Â  Once you know that you can work with it.Â  Ned never learned it, Robb forgot about it, Renly was blind to it so they all lost.Â  Sansa knows what motivates LF and she can work with that; she can work with Robyn, and she can win the game of Thrones.Â  The show has- masterfully- brought that truth to the forefront of the show.Â  
Â 
The Blast From the Past: I never liked Obyreyn Martel for a simple reason: he was a loudmouth who was more style than substance, talked a big game and never backed it up; a man whose reputation far exceeded the man he was, and who seemed preoccupied with being right more than he ever was occupied with winning.Â  So, he lost.Â  He lost because he could not keep his mouth shut; he lost because he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t as good as he thought, he lost because he underestimated a man whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation BELIED underestimation; he lost because he thought he was touched by gods, when, in fact, he was just touched by a Mountain.Â  
Â 
And he lost because he thought he had one up on Tywin.Â  Yeahâ<U+0080>¦ no.Â  
Â 
I cheered, just like I did in the books, just like I knew I would watching it.Â  The fight and the buildup were perfect (the fight could have been longer, BUT â<U+0080>¦ getting two actors who have LIMITED sword/spear fighting abilities to choreograph a fight is â<U+0080>¦ really fucking hard- anything more would have been greedy).Â  Plus, the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to switch around from the books left us all wonderingâ<U+0080>¦. Hey could Oberyn win this thing?
Â 
And he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t; it was fucking amazing.Â  
Â 
Sad clown faces for everyone!Â  
Â 
Oh, one more thingâ<U+0080>¦ he screamed like a girlâ<U+0080>¦. HA!Â  
Â 
Â 
The Brothers Kin(g)slayers: I love Tyrion and Jaime, my two favorite characters (along with Stannis).Â  Watching then poke fun at a â<U+0080><U+009C>simpleâ<U+0080><U+009D> relative was fantastic- gallows humor for a man who was actually facing the gallows.Â  And Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s preoccupation with a relative who squashed bugs was eerily similar to Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship with a King who killed people for by-in-large the same reasons â<U+0080><U+0093> because he could.Â  Listening them try to keep up their own spirits was touching and equally morbid; like laughing at a funeral.Â  And it worked.Â  
Â 
The Laughter of the Girl with Nothing to Lose: Aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reaction to her Auntâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was picture-fucking perfect.Â  At that point, how could you NOT laugh?Â  No, seriously, whose alive at that point?!?! Fuck it, just sail to Braavos and start life over as a monk who kills people.Â  Ohâ<U+0080>¦ wait â<U+0080>¦ 
Â 
The Mother of The Friend Zone: Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reactions to both Melassandi and to Jorah Mormont were very good, wise and emotionally charged.Â  She trusted Mormont, she loved him, and she wanted him to be by her side all the days through.Â  But he was a spy; he did lie to her and she had to throw him out.Â  I wish they had delved more into Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s conflict about the episode and how it hurt her to make him go and how she almost tried to keep him, but she didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.Â  While I think that Emilia Clark did a lot of that with her face at the end, its at best ambiguous as to whether or not TV-Dany is that conflicted.Â  I would have liked to see her at least upset over it.Â  Her acting with Mel assandi was also very good as she asked the questions that we probing and tough and showed a deft hand.Â  
Â 
Honorable Mention to Selmy who seemed to fit nicely in the whole episode.Â  
Â 
On the Fence On:
Â 
The Most Deep, Meaningful and Beautiful Love Story I Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t Give a Fuck About: Melassandi and Grey Wormâ<U+0080><U+0099>s emotional love story, its depth, honesty and beauty â<U+0080><U+0093> even the beauty of their two bodies in the water, the unflinching charm of both a man and a woman admitting that they are pleased with seeing the other Â and how the gruesomeness of Grey Wormâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mutilation makes Mel wonder about him; even the way they speak to each other- it was deep, rich, and I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give one fuck at all about it, not even a little.Â 
Â 
They are third-level characters in a single sub-set of a story and they are utterly uninteresting to the overall story arc.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about them; I find it hard to believe anyone would care.Â  IT was beautiful and rich and well done and extremely tasteful- fuck, we even had a very tasteful nude scene that did not make me want to question the mental health of the people making this show- And I could not possibly care any less nor give less fucks.Â  If I had a fuck I would not give it to learn more about them or their love story.Â 
Â 
Dude, we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care.Â 
Â 
Still, it was touching and rich and bored the fuck out of me.Â 
Â 
I am Ygritte, the Killer, but â<U+0080>¦ Oh, Look, Babiesâ<U+0080>¦ : I get why Ygritte didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kill Gilly, but the place was- literally- flowing with blood.Â  Ygitte is like Darth Vader- she can kill whomever she wants, but â<U+0080><U+009C>there is still good inâ<U+0080><U+009D> her.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get that, but I can see why they needed to have it there.Â  I kind of like her being a steely eyed-killer myself.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know- how come GIlly and the baby deserve her mercy but not the girl whose throat she slashed just a few seconds before?Â  So, sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s still good while being a fucking terrible person?Â  Really?Â  Is that the message?
Â 
Rhymes with Tweak: THeonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and Ramseyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes were 100% â<U+0080>¦ satisfactory.Â  They were definitely scenes; there was an opening and then a final cut; dialog was spoken, and heck, there was actual plot development and story advancement.Â  Yeah. Â Â That was entirely â<U+0080>¦ okay.Â  Â 
Â 
And nothing really of interest.Â  We saw everything we had seen before at Winterfell (Ironborn turning on their own) and with Ramsey (he goes back on his word because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a fucking asshole).Â  Reek is scared of his own shadow and Roose Bolton is great when he is talking.Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not anything we had not seen before Â â<U+0080>¦ very â<U+0080>¦ mediocre.Â 
Â 
What I did Not Like:
Â 
Arya Stark is Aliveâ<U+0080>¦. Okayâ<U+0080>¦ Helloâ<U+0080>¦.?Â  Anyone?Â  Is anyone Listening That Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Alive?Â  Anyone?Â  No?Â  Hello?Â  â<U+0080>¦. : So, one of the great unanswered questions in Westeroes for the last 2 years has been: â<U+0080><U+009D>Whatever Happened to Mr. Garabaldi Arya Stark?â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  Then- predictably one might argue- she turns up at Lysa Arynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Home.Â  There she is.Â  She introduces herself to everyone and everything.Â  Thisâ<U+0080>¦ THIS IS HUGE NEWS!!!!!Â  The very next scene we see LF and Robyn and Sansa and â<U+0080>¦ and â<U+0080>¦ NOBODY MENTIONS THIS!!!!Â  WTF?!?!?!Â  A few scenes earlier Roose was talking about his power when he was reminded that the two youngest Starks are still aliveâ<U+0080>¦ so he â<U+0080>¦ does fucking nothing!Â  But here- we HAVE ARYA!Â  And â<U+0080>¦ and â<U+0080>¦ nothing.
Â 
Yeah, because thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s realistic; because LF would not want to know; because the realm would not want to know.Â  Why would you do that?Â  Why would you put that scene in?Â  Yes, I know- the pay off was great- Arya laughing the absurdity of it all.Â  Got it!Â  Butâ<U+0080>¦ holy hellâ<U+0080>¦ people now know Sansa is alive andâ<U+0080>¦ nothing!?Â 
Â 
Yeah, Fail.Â 
Â 
Anyway, this was an incredible episode.Â  Yeah, it had a few uneven parts that were very â<U+0080><U+009C>mehâ<U+0080><U+009D> but the high-points were exceptional.Â  This is a great segue into the final two episodes.Â 
Â 
And the King both Beyond the Wallâ<U+0080>¦ and the one who will end up there.Â 
Â 

	Spoiler  Stannis. Is. Coming. Â 
Â
415	Hotpie Targaryen	2014-06-01	I loved the image of Daenerys not even being able to look him in the eye.

I thought she did calmly furious really well.
416	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-01	That's what I thought I saw.


Â 
Yeah, He even says to Reek, they're going to their "new" home.
417	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-01	No wai, the head squish was made of yes and win. Oh yeah! You know, that played out exactly how i imagined it in the books so the duel was ace.
Â 

Â 
Is the vampy Sansa from Winds or are they just rewriting her? Â 

Pretty sure thats not a rewrite. Its playing up something thats likely to be hinted at in the upcoming book. In other words, i think i have a feeling where the "controversial Sansa chapter" is going now. Sansa is doing what i have been suspecting she is doing and while its not as subtle (lel) in the show, its still awesome. I am ok with this. I am more than ok with this.
Â 
Â 
Â 


Honestly, did we need to hear 3 mins of that beetle story. And why the Missandei/Greyworm subplot? Is there a purpose to that?Â 


The beetle story is actually telling us Tyrion's thought processes because we aint in his dome in the show. Hes spelling it out, just what he does and why. (and why his character development is going in the direction its going.) If people didnt pick up on that, i dont know what to tell ya.Â 
As for Missandei/Grey Worm, this is actually an attempt to flesh out these two characters and add a layer to Meereen. To give us something to root for there. We all know its a foregone conclusion, Dany fails in Meereen. But Grey Worm and Missandei having feelings for each other is something we can get behind emotionally. That and the two of them are composite characters. Theres elements of Strong Belwas (without the funny) and Rakharo in GW along with his canon self. Missandei is composited of all of Dany's handmaidens. So yeah thats whats going on there.Â 
Â 
Emilia Clarke got brownie points for not flubbing that scene. Nice job! i could feel the rage and heartache.

Â 
Â 
First Jorah wasnt begging pardon he was demanding.
Did you really think they were going to make Jorah look like that big of a dick? I expected them to sugar coat that a bit but it still came off as Dany being in the right.
Â 
Â 
Arya's laugh...it was hilarious and chilling at the same time.
Â 
Â 


Sorry I haven't read the whole thread and might have missed this but did anyone catch Oberyn's comment to Tyrion about the fighting pits?


Nope. I sure didnt.Â 
Â 
Theon and Moat Cailin and Ramsay got legitimized. WowwowowowwowÂ
418	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-01	Â 
Why not? Or he becomes aware they are around and sends them on their way somehow and with no drama. But I can't see that opportunistic fiend not trying to get Arya (2 Stark girls) for his own gains. Like, maybe, this is why the Hound doesn't get work if they allude to the books.


Â 
It's another show red herring, like Bran and John...Arya and the Hound will leave thinking theres no point with Lysa dead. Maybe Sansa will find out after the fact.
419	teej6	2014-06-01	I think I know what I don't like about the episodes.
Â 
They look like sequences. Would it kill them to have a bit of Wall first, then Vale, then Arya, KL, then again Wall and such?


This
420	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-01	Is The Mountain being dubbed? I tried comparing it with an interview of HafA3A3r but I couldn't tell for sure because he was speaking softly in the interview instead of screaming.Â
421	sertravisredbeard	2014-06-01	Wow. Â The duel was one of the first scenes that I thought was better than the books. Â The Mountain slowly crushing Oberyn's skull was way more brutal than him just punching it.
Â 
Ygritte's reaction to that baby made me think she's preggers with Jon's little snowbunny.
422	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-01	Â 
Ygritte's reaction to that baby made me think she's preggers with Jon's little snowbunny.



I just figured she recognized Gilly as being a free folk.Â
423	booknerd2	2014-06-01	Â 
It's another show red herring, like Bran and John...Arya and the Hound will leave thinking theres no point with Lysa dead. Maybe Sansa will find out after the fact.


Â 
Ahâ<U+0080>¦.but I think there is NO WAY in hell he would leave if he knew she was there. Unless prevented somehow or physically removed. It would stink if he starts weakening from the wound and finds out. That will be just too friggin sad. If he gets that tree confessional scene and he is upset with regrets and upset that she was so close and he couldn't go to her because he is weak and dying, it might make sense.
Â 
Meaning, though I love both tv characters, I could not figure out, besides the comedy factor, why they show up almost every episode and keep walking, and walking, traveling, with nothing much happening. Might have just been all set up for a big emotional scene for the Hound and Arya. The tree scene.
Â 
Sansa might be pissed at LF, if she finds out he knew and didn't tell herâ<U+0080>¦later.

424	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-06-01	I didn't think this episode was glaringly disjointed at all, it was one hell of a ride from scene to scene. By far my favorite episode of the season so far. Examples of disjointed episodes to me would be Two Swords and First of His Name.
425	Alia Atreides	2014-06-01	True, but just hearing it was enough for me.
There is going to be some serious killing next week. M


Â 
 yes there will be and then its almost over. Â I can't believe finally Jorah is banished.Â
426	Gwynbleidd	2014-06-01	Oberyn is too cool for Westeros that is why he died. But damn isn't the fight amazing? And his death! Gruesome as i remember from the books!
Â 
Also as for Sansa, there will be a time that she will beat Little finger in the game of thrones. I'm hoping for it.
Â 
And as for Daenerys.... The day she exiled Jorah is the day and onward where she will constantly fucks up ruling mereen. Oh and 50 shades of Daario.
427	nara	2014-06-01	Lots of changes but I found I could live with most of them.
Â 
Â 
Theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve added Moat Cailin to the credits, but still no Eyrie?Â  WTF?
Â 
Moletown â<U+0080><U+0093> good to show the attack.Â  I guess it was good to have a named character (Gilly) there to witness it.Â  By the way, I noticed that there was less nudity in the brothel than they would typically show.Â  Hoping thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the direction in which theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re heading.Â  A much as I hated the farting of Bear and the Maiden Fair, it was a welcome break from naked whores number 59 to 63 on the screen.
Â 
Missendei/Grey Worm â<U+0080><U+0093> So, are they now saying that Unsullied have penes? I always thought everything was removedâ<U+0080>¦ I do get that they need attractive people to show naked/having sex, especially if you believe the story that Emilia has refused any more explicit scenes, but that seems a little weird.Â  Both actors are very good looking, though, and their story is kinda nice if you donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about all the stuff being eliminated from the books to incorporate their romance.Â  But what was with Missendeiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s delayed reaction in covering herself?Â 
Â 
Theon/Ramsay â<U+0080><U+0093> Alfie Allen continues to be flawless as Theon/Reek.Â  I liked the way the ironborn guy got axed in the headâ<U+0080><U+0094>it reminded me to Theon getting bonked on the head during his epic speech about capturing Winterfell.Â  LOVED Theon regressing into Reek when challenged and then regaining his Theon-ness when that guy was killed.Â  I liked how they showed the renaming of Ramsay and the explanation that the Boltons now = the North.Â  However, they have done away with all other Northerners in the show (Umbers, Mormonts, etc.) so it will be strange if/when they show any sort of reaction/rebellion against the Boltons.Â  Also, why did Ramsay refer to â<U+0080><U+009C>a new homeâ<U+0080><U+009D> BEFORE he was legitimized â<U+0080><U+0093>he hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been given Winterfell yetâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
The new Sansa â<U+0080><U+0093> I really liked this approach with Sansa being honest then manipulative.Â  I think it works for the older Sansa, because Sophie Turner is too old and too tall to be taken seriously as a frightened child.Â  The problem is that so many people know that she is Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0094>everyone knows that the more people who know a secret, the less likely it is to stay a secret.Â  Also, it looks like they may be heading for â<U+0080><U+009C>relationsâ<U+0080><U+009D> between â<U+0080><U+009C>Manipulativeâ<U+0080><U+009D> Sansa and Petyr.Â  Not sure I can watch that if it comesâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Where is Sweetrobin going?Â  Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m assuming that they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to pay for snow special effects on the Eyrie (or theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve forgotten that Winter is Coming) so they had to come up with another reason for them to leaveâ<U+0080>¦BTW, I was thinking that they could have made Sansa blonde instead of brunetteâ<U+0080><U+0094>that way they could simply have allowed the actress to go to her natural hair colorâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Jorahâ<U+0080><U+0099>s exile â<U+0080><U+0093> Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad they kept it in, but why a pardon from Robert Baratheon?Â  Why would it take so long to reach themâ<U+0080><U+0094>Robert died 3 seasons ago!Â  Jorah might have been able to explain it away by saying that he subsequently switched allegiences.Â  Wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a pardon from Joffrey have made more senseâ<U+0080><U+0094>since that would demonstrate recent betrayal?Â  Also, I thought Dany should have shown some indecision here based on the many things that Jorah has done for her.Â  She always seemed ungrateful in the books (but even there she wanted to forgive him), and this made her seem doubly so.Â  Instead, we got Her Imperiousness Daenerys Stormborn.Â  Also, why wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t she looking at Jorah when condemning him? The way she was looking over him seemed stupid to me.Â  I would have been okay if I thought it meant indecision, but it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t appear to.
Â 
A random crackpot theory popped into my head in this sceneâ<U+0080><U+0094>Barristanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dismissal from the KG by Cersei and Joffrey was a sham and a way to get him into Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s inner circle so that he can hurt her from within her own army!
Â 
The Hound and Arya â<U+0080><U+0093> Nice foreshadowing to her future as a Faceless Person, including her ability to kill people in whatever manner was available.Â  I liked the irony of them arriving at the Eyrie after Lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death.Â  However, I would have preferred it to be clearer that her laughing was hysteria, not humorâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
As much as I adore Jaime and Tyrion together, I thought that scene was painfully long.Â  I would have preferred to spend the time with Oberyn
Â 
The Trial â<U+0080><U+0093> Pedro Pascal is THE MAN and killed this scene (until it killed him).Â  His lines could have been cheesy, but he delivered them well.Â  That flipping around and fighting was AWESOME.Â  Only issues I had were no â<U+0080><U+009C>Eliiiiiaaaa!â<U+0080><U+009D>(but I'll survive) and the exploding melon head--câ<U+0080><U+0099>mon Special Effects, you could have done better.Â  Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not a fan of seeing bodily functions on the screen, but Tyrion vomiting would have been great here.Â  This scene could have been a couple of minutes longer too, to include more of the preparation.

428	HouseAllyrion	2014-06-01	I don't understand why some people are saying Arya was laughing maniacally or that she has turned sadistic. I saw her laughing at just the whole situation of arriving again to be reunited with some family and being told that they were too late (Red Wedding?) so she was laughing at her and the Hound's shitty timing and luck. I thought the scene was pretty entertaining IMO
429	joaozinm	2014-06-01	The Ygritte and the baby scene was just to show that she is a nice wildling and stuff...She also killed a bad guy(the whore). Well they're are just preparing her to an honourable death by the hands of her beloved one.Â
430	Dornish Hen	2014-06-01	Wait... Where were the runes on Bronze Yohn Royce's armor?  I was looking forward to seeing them.
431	joaozinm	2014-06-01	I don't understand why some people are saying Arya was laughing maniacally or that she has turned sadistic.

Â 
early in her dialogue she told that find fun(or good) and stuff to kill rorge and others....It's not revenge for Show's Arya... its fun time.
432	booknerd2	2014-06-01	Arya's laugh. Hysteria, pain, anger, incredulity, was great, and the Hound's face and not laughing with her or at her. His face was priceless. Very poignant. He gets is. It was another real blow to him. He can't get in with Sansa's family.
Â 
The funny thing is that the scenes and dialogue are getting re-done but the general themes are not in some senses.

433	Mladen	2014-06-01	With a few misstep here and there, this was rather interesting, and for me as Sansa fan, truly memorable episode. Long story short, Sansa and Oberyn ruled this, unfortunately in different directions.
Â 
The end was as gory as it should have been. I know some viewers don't like it, but the books leave no imagination to what has happened there, and the duel was nicely done. The Oberyn's mobility was something expected and there was a nice flow to it. Liked how he handled the spear, it was indeed nicely done. I loved the keeping "You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children" and Pascal was absolutely phenomenal in making each of those times slightly more irritated. I am sincerely pleased at how show maintained the twist we have in books, and how our hopes were crushed in the very same cruel way it was done in the books. I assume the Unsullied rage has went over the top...
Â 
On the other hand we have "from Aurora to Maleficent" Sansa Stark. The end is there. This is all we have from Sansa in terms of book material, and I believe that we have concluded with her this year. How I feel about this is another story. This was truly from zero to hero transformation and although it felt a bit too fast, this was something that truly opens entire array of possibilities. Now, we can either conclude that Alayne Stone is the mask that never went deep in Sansa's psyche, or at least that is where the show is heading. TBH, there is a huge gap between Sansa's Alayne in TV and Sansa's Alayne in the books. This transformation was, in terms of her playing the game, phenomenal, but there is a feeling that TV Sansa is going into, if not "warrior princess" mode, than in some sort of "ice queen" which, again, can be problematic. I do find her acknowledgement of what LF wants rather interesting, and I assume that this indeed is TWOW spoilers in which Sansa realizes what LF wants from her. As for the vamp costume, we should never forget one thing - she sow it. She made that costume. She was the one who made her look that way. Not LF or anyone else. Sansa has turned herself into a player, and that can go in many directions... All and all, if we are to end her storyline this year, it is in many ways, interesting ending. Now, at least no one can argue that she is silly little girl 
Â 
ETA: Let we not forget a bit crow-ish appeal of Sansa. Bloodraven, much?
Â 
In conclusion, interesting episode with Sansa and Oberyn taking the crown this week. Both Turner and Pascal were amazing and truly wonderful addition to the cast. I am going to miss Pascal... As I miss Oberyn

Yeah, I actually laughed in sync with her. Guess I'm sadistic.
435	Alex21	2014-06-01	At this point I'm wondering if they are gonna show us Lady Stoneheart, I mean, the half of Brienne's plot in AFFC has been played in this season.
436	Cold Feet	2014-06-01	Oh we just had 4.0 EarthQuake in Los Angeles as I was typing this
The earthquake is from the rioting of the unsullied.
437	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-01	Â 
early in her dialogue she told that find fun(or good) and stuff to kill rorge and others....It's not revenge for Show's Arya... its fun time.


Â 
The question was "what makes you happy." Book and show Arya are alike in that revenge makes her happy.
438	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-06-01	I don't understand why some people are saying Arya was laughing maniacally or that she has turned sadistic.

Â 
That's how I took it as well. That she was rolling her ass off because it's "just her luck" to have another family member die on her before she could get to them. Pretty good scene in my opinion.
439	Darth Pipes	2014-06-01	While I liked the Jaime and Tyrion interaction, I wish they would have cut out that LONG beetle conversation and instead added the scene where Oberyn talks to Tyrion about taking him to Dorne once he wins.
Â 
I don't see the issue with Arya's laughter.Â  That was nervous laughter I believe it's called.Â  She's had so much crap dumped on her that hearing about her aunt just gives her the opposite reaction.Â  It's a coping mechanism.Â

440	The Winged Man	2014-06-01	I loved this episode. Fight scene was great, I like how sansas storyline is less boring now, and even the missandi grey worm storyline seemed great to me. Especially because they aged missandi up so much, and the book never really went into the psyche of the unsullied. It makes sense that out of 4 thousand castrated men some of them would have the hots for Danny and missandi. It's a nice addition IMO
441	nara	2014-06-01	Ygritte's reaction to that baby made me think she's preggers with Jon's little snowbunny.


Â 
That would be interesting,Â  That could be the baby that Jon swaps with Gilly's child...
But I want more Mance and I want Val to appear, so I hope not.
442	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-01	I didn't think this episode was glaringly disjointed at all, it was one hell of a ride from scene to scene. By far my favorite episode of the season so far. Examples of disjointed episodes to me would be Two Swords and First of His Name.


Agreed.Â 
Â 
Mladen, i really think Sansa's costume change is to simply signify that shes pretty much done with being The Dumbass Dove and now a raven watching everything.Â Watching everything. It happens in the Vale,Â Alayne is gonna know. I really actually dont think this "LF is my senpai and he noticed me" thing is gonna last. Shes got a will of her own. They are just speeding up the process in the show cuz its good TV.
Â 


Wait... Where were the runes on Bronze Yohn Royce's armor? I was looking forward to seeing them.


Wowwow thats one hell of a nitpick! hue! I didnt even remember them. Bronze Yohn is gr9 doe.
443	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-01	While I liked the Jaime and Tyrion interaction, I wish they would have cut out that LONG beetle conversation and instead added the scene where Oberyn talks to Tyrion about taking him to Dorne once he wins.


Â 
If I recall correctly, Oberyn says something very important regarding Myrcella in that conversation. I wonder where that information is going to come from now.Â
444	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-01	No wai, the head squish was made of yes and win. Oh yeah! You know, that played out exactly how i imagined it in the books so the duel was ace.
Â 
Pretty sure thats not a rewrite. Its playing up something thats likely to be hinted at in the upcoming book. In other words, i think i have a feeling where the "controversial Sansa chapter" is going now. Sansa is doing what i have been suspecting she is doing and while its not as subtle (lel) in the show, its still awesome. I am ok with this. I am more than ok with this.
Â 
Â 
Â 
The beetle story is actually telling us Tyrion's thought processes because we aint in his dome in the show. Hes spelling it out, just what he does and why. (and why his character development is going in the direction its going.) If people didnt pick up on that, i dont know what to tell ya.Â 
As for Missandei/Grey Worm, this is actually an attempt to flesh out these two characters and add a layer to Meereen. To give us something to root for there. We all know its a foregone conclusion, Dany fails in Meereen. But Grey Worm and Missandei having feelings for each other is something we can get behind emotionally. That and the two of them are composite characters. Theres elements of Strong Belwas (without the funny) and Rakharo in GW along with his canon self. Missandei is composited of all of Dany's handmaidens. So yeah thats whats going on there.Â 
Â 
Emilia Clarke got brownie points for not flubbing that scene. Nice job! i could feel the rage and heartache.
Did you really think they were going to make Jorah look like that big of a dick? I expected them to sugar coat that a bit but it still came off as Dany being in the right.
Â 
Â 
Arya's laugh...it was hilarious and chilling at the same time.
Â 
Â 
Nope. I sure didnt.Â 
Â 
Theon and Moat Cailin and Ramsay got legitimized. WowwowowowwowÂ 


Â 
Not only that but it's a nice setup for the scene that follows. Tyrion is comparing the Mountain to his halfwit cousin(who died from getting kicked in the chest by a mule heh heh). By giving pause to brutality for brutality's sake it makes the duel extra frustrating.

I wouldn't mind the Missandei/Greyworm scene if it wasn't at the expense of other characters/storylines from the books. They have so little time and so much ground to cover and they add on these immaterial IMHO subplots. Why not flush out Jon's/Stannis' characters. As for the beetle story, I get it, but it still didn't have to be 5 mins long.Â
446	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-06-01	I don't get the dislike for the Missandei and Grey Worm scene. All I personally ask for is that I have a reason to care about the characters on my screen. It can be cheesy or it can be complex. But give me something. This gave me something and I'm grateful for it.
447	Dornish Hen	2014-06-01	I wonder if Littlefinger was singing in his head, " I've got chills, they're multiplying, and I'm losing control.  Cause the power you're supplying... It's electrifying!"
448	joaozinm	2014-06-01	I still think they failed to show the process that was turning Sansa into a game of thrones player... And more Littlefinger looked like a fool. So now that show's Sansa is on the game what about her next chapters? Now that they just jumped over her learning process her next great moment is when Littlefinger tells her to marry the heir of the house arryn after little robert dies... But sansa is already kind of ruling it.

Â 
This. I almost typed defense mechanism before. Totally agree. And it is a wink to the readers and tv viewers. Because even when I read the books after awhile myself I had to slap my head in disbelief at how bad things keep getting for her that, yes, it was almost laughable, or shout at the heavens on one's knees time.
450	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-01	I wonder if Littlefinger was singing in his head, " I've got chills, they're multiplying, and I'm losing control. Cause the power you're supplying... It's electrifying!"


Â 
Grease is my least favorite musical.Â

It can be cheesy or it can be complex. But give me something. This gave me something and I'm grateful for it.


Â 
I agree with this. Missandei and Grey Worm are Irri and Jiqui and the other Dothraki who doesn't bed cows nor boys. I miss the dothraki handmaids but they both are fine.
452	Hodor H'ghar	2014-06-01	I loved the image of Daenerys not even being able to look him in the eye.


Â 
That's because she was doing her usual, staring into the distance look.Â  Â
453	Arry Lannister	2014-06-01	All of your comments are getting me hyped for the episode, can't wait to see the Trial and Theon taking Moat Caitlin. Â and Missandei bathing
454	Dirk blitzen	2014-06-01	It boggles my mind how some people can complain about how the show lacks subtlety  and subtext, but then can't understand the subtlety and subtext of the beetle scene.

455	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-01	Oh yeah...

Â 
Missendei/Grey Worm â<U+0080><U+0093> So, are they now saying that Unsullied have penes? I always thought everything was removedâ<U+0080>¦ I do get that they need attractive people to show naked/having sex, especially if you believe the story that Emilia has refused any more explicit scenes, but that seems a little weird. Both actors are very good looking, though, and their story is kinda nice if you donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about all the stuff being eliminated from the books to incorporate their romance. But what was with Missendeiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s delayed reaction in covering herself?Â 

I actually think Grey Worm is balls and shaftless completely. I think his staring was him going "well hell. I really like her and its kinda awesome shes paying attention to me. She gives me reason to fight that i can keep in my feels box. But im a sad panda. If she likes me back, i cant give her the Big Main Thing and thats the pits. Maybe if i fib..nah that wont work either. I dunno. I think im in love but im not sure how this feels cuz i dont have man parts and i cant give her everything she needs or wants."
Missandei is like "Hes totally checking me out right? Right? That cant be right..but i kinda want him to keep looking. But does that mean theres still something there that makes him want my body? Does he even want that?"
Their discussion together a bit later actually confirms that no, Grey Worm isnt really into the Boom Boom but hes glad he could see her forÂ herselfÂ and shes glad he saw her. Theres no walls between em, no shame really. (and thats more or less what her discussion with Dany was about. Dany finds shame in one's body to be an alien concept.) Grey Worm was saying he likes to be near her and those moments are precious. This is a word he learned from Jorah. In other words, he digs her for who she is. And shes pretty cool with it.Â 
Thats how i saw it anyway.Â
456	Ser Couch Potato	2014-06-01	Great episode. Loved every minute of it. Sophie Turner finally giving me the chills.
Â 
The fight was amazing. That's what a call GOOD television. I read the fight in ASOS and cheered for Oberyn all the way. Tonight I knew what would happen and I knew there was no way it would be changed for the show, but yet they got me cheering for Oberyn from start to finish.
Â 
And say what you want about the Boltons, but they're damn good at flaying people hahaha.
457	smizzle	2014-06-01	And why the Missandei/Greyworm subplot? Is there a purpose to that?Â 
Seems like they are laying the groundwork to keep the Meereen plot from being such a bore next season. Dany is becoming less and less likable so it makes sense to build up the supporting characters in her story so that viewers are still interested instead of spending all of next year asking why she's still in Meereen.
458	Dornish Hen	2014-06-01	Â 
Wowwow thats one hell of a nitpick! hue! I didnt even remember them. Bronze Yohn is gr9 doe.


Â 
I didn't really mean it as a nitpick. Â I am truly obsessed with finding out what the runes are and what they mean. Â When I heard Littlefinger say Royce's name, the first thing I thought of was his armor.
459	teej6	2014-06-01	With a few misstep here and there, this was rather interesting, and for me as Sansa fan, truly memorable episode. Long story short, Sansa and Oberyn ruled this, unfortunately in different directions.

Yes Pascal was truly good castingÂ
460	booknerd2	2014-06-01	Yeah, the "new" Sansa stuff could have went sour fast, if Sophie wasn't a good actress, and she is.
461	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-06-01	disappointed with the fight scene. only about 4 minutes long. and where are the limbs of the spectators the mountain took off? could have been much more cinematic
462	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-01	I don't get the dislike for the Missandei and Grey Worm scene. All I personally ask for is that I have a reason to care about the characters on my screen. It can be cheesy or it can be complex. But give me something. This gave me something and I'm grateful for it.


Preach! Im ok with it because its adding some substance to Meereen and might as well get comfortable. We aint going anywhere for a while. While i see the complaints because im still Jon-Starved, im ok with what im getting cuz it could be worse.Â 
Â 


Â 
I agree with this. Missandei and Grey Worm are Irri and Jiqui and the other Dothraki who doesn't bed cows nor boys. I miss the dothraki handmaids but they both are fine.


Yeah this. 
Â 


Â 
That's because she was doing her usual, staring into the distance look.Â  Â  


Oh come on...i think for once, we canÂ not berate Emilia Clarke. She was doing ok there. MUCH better than anticipated.Â 
Â 


It boggles my mind how some people can complain about how the show lacks subtlety and subtext, but then can't understand the subtlety and subtext of the beetle scene.


You. I dont know you, but i like the cut of your jib.
463	KalibakCruel	2014-06-01	Oh I remember everyone crying about the Oberyn casting. And look now, everyone's going to miss him.
464	Bayard	2014-06-01	Alright I'm still in shock because of the last scene, I couldn't even watch it.... man they went all the way.
Â 
First, people need to stop complaining about Grey Worm and Missandei. They have great chemistry, they are very cute together, it makes even historical sense.... powerful, rich eunuchs have married in the past, so why not??? The two of them are replacing a lot of characters from the books, so they will have very important roles in the story after Daenerys flies away. Heck, they will probably survive all the way to Westeros and be important there.... it makes sense from the show's perspective.
Â 
As for Sansa... they rushed a little bit, but I liked a lot the trial, it was a great scene, Sophie Turner was amazing and for half the episode I liked a lot what they did with her story.... then I was shocked to find out that LF had no clue about that. What??? So, they make Sansa look great, but everything they added to her character, detracted from LF's. Do you understand how vulnerable he was in that scene with Lord Royce and the others??? LF is just too smart to be put in a situation like that.... if he didn't have a plan why did he kill Lysa??? That's disappointing... as for the last scenes.... I would bet that some unsullied will think she slept with LF, heck maybe she did in D&D's story (I really hope not)
Â 
To me, the scenese with Roose, Ramsay and Theon were perfection. They showed nothing new, but that doesn't mean they weren't great. Theon starting Reeking in front of that captain? so funny .
Â 
When watching the episode I simply didn't understand what was the point of the roach story, after I saw the "Inside the Episode". They wanted to show that Tyrion simply doesn't understand why this is happening to him, he wants an answer that he can't get.... pretty simple stuff, a bit disappointing.
Â 
Emilia Clarke was good for a change, nothing great, but she did exactly what that banishment scene demanded from her.
Â 
What I hated was Arya's scene.... horrible. Why did they need to yell her name??? She could have had the same reaction even if the soldiers didn't know it was her. That's just stupid.... probably they did this, because they couldn't find another reason for the guards to let them pass. I bet Sandor and Arya reach the Eyrie and Sansa just left on her voyage .... Sandor dies and Arya goes to Gulltown. They created a lot of complications because they were too lazy to search for a better reasoninig.
465	Raksha 2014	2014-06-01	I don't get the dislike for the Missandei and Grey Worm scene. All I personally ask for is that I have a reason to care about the characters on my screen. It can be cheesy or it can be complex. But give me something. This gave me something and I'm grateful for it.


Â 
Â 
I think the Missandei/Grey Worm romance has been interesting and credibly acted. Â I'd rather watch it than Ramsay's girl hunts and sex scenes and some other things I can think of (such as Dany/Daario interaction).
466	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-01	Â 
I didn't really mean it as a nitpick. Â I am truly obsessed with finding out what the runes are and what they mean. Â When I heard Littlefinger say Royce's name, the first thing I thought of was his armor.


Heh. Im razzin' ya. I didnt really remember he had runes on his armor.Â Maybe they say "Here is a fucken badass". Cuz srsly, Bronze Yohn is pretty great in the show omg im so pleased with im.
467	HouseAllyrion	2014-06-01	No one complained this week about Aiden Gillen's accent changes so there's that
468	Fjordgazer	2014-06-01	Anyone else worried abou how they're going to get Arya out of the Vale now that Sandor spilled her name?
469	Granatto	2014-06-01	I loved this:https://www.youtube....eature=youtu.be
470	Mladen	2014-06-01	Mladen, i really think Sansa's costume change is to simply signify that shes pretty much done with being The Dumbass Dove and now a raven watching everything.Â Watching everything. It happens in the Vale,Â Alayne is gonna know. I really actually dont think this "LF is my senpai and he noticed me" thing is gonna last. Shes got a will of her own. They are just speeding up the process in the show cuz its good TV.


Â 
Thank you... Everyone are speaking about Black Swan and Maleficent, but in universe this was Bloodraven to the core...
471	Dornish Hen	2014-06-01	Heh. Im razzin' ya. I didnt really remember he had runes on his armor.Â Maybe they say "Here is a fucken badass". Cuz srsly, Bronze Yohn is pretty great in the show omg im so pleased with im.


Â 
Ha! Â I just laughed out loud on that one! Â That's what I'm going to imagine every time Royce is brought up in the books!
472	HouseAllyrion	2014-06-01	Anyone else worried abou how they're going to get Arya out of the Vale now that Sandor spilled her name?


Maybe they just won't believe him? Or maybe Bolton's will claim they have the real Arya in Winterfell?Â
473	MegaMagick	2014-06-01	Man Sansa was great this episode, her speech was amazing. Littlefinger revealing he didn't know anything about it Â made it even better. I thought the Moat Cailan part was pretty funny, kinda similar to what happened to Theon in Winterfell. I felt sorry for Jorah when he got the boot out of Daenaerys' camp, that part was really well done. As for the duel....man....short but sweet -- and absolutely brutal! Oberyn's death in the show was on par with how i envisioned it in my head reading the books, bravo!Â 
Â 
The worst part of this episode by far was the Mole's town girl belching songs at the beginning. Yeesh.
474	Moseh Khayim	2014-06-01	Arya's laughter works several ways. On the one hand, she's laughing because she's finally within reach of some measure of safety and again, it gets snatched away. She's just a couple of days too late. On the other hand: her aunt just died and that really doesn't seem to phase her. And, yes, like she said, she doesn't actually know her aunt. But hey, it's still her aunt.Â 
Â 
Not a scene to my liking.
There was some rumor that the Hound could be getting himself killed by the Knights of the Vale. In hindsight, that doesn't seem logical with Arya by his side. But then they could've just skipped the Bloody Gate alltogether. We've had enough close encounters and I don't think they're fooling anyone in to believing a Stark reunion is within the realm of possibilities. Â
475	booknerd2	2014-06-01	I have to be honest that I wasn't so sure when Pascal was cast. Only that he wasn't how I pictured Oberyn in my head.

But he was excellent. He got the languid charm and self-possession and witty bite to him down pat, when he is conversing at KL or with Elia or, er, at "play." Yet, when he was repeating himself and yelling about his sister and the children and the cool ferocity I pictured from the books while battling the Mountain, it was pretty close to how I viewed the character.
Â 
He was great.
476	Alex21	2014-06-01	It boggles my mind how some people can complain about how the show lacks subtlety and subtext, but then can't understand the subtlety and subtext of the beetle scene.


Â 
If the showrunners showed us the Red Wedding in that way that we all know, Why we should believe that they would not change Oberyn's death or make it worse?
For me the beatle scene was very good, it makes you think about of lot of things about the series
477	Darth Pipes	2014-06-01	One detail I really liked was Roose showing no affection at all to Ramsay after his son kneeled and pledged himself to him.Â  Very Roose.
478	SweetJeyne	2014-06-01	Frankly, so much more believable than Marmilion. In my opinion.


Totally agree. An elegant solution in a multiplot adaption.
479	Table8	2014-06-01	Watching it again.  Great music when the wildlings arrive in moles town
480	Emperoreddy	2014-06-01	Arya's laughter works several ways. On the one hand, she's laughing because she's finally within reach of some measure of safety and again, it gets snatched away.

Â 
Took it has her just laughing with the ridiculousness of her situation at this point. She has zero ties with her aunt, might as well be a stranger to her.
Â 
Also think she might of been laughing at the Hound a bit. To her it seems she just lost his paycheck since she now has (to her knowledge) no living relatives with money.
481	Alia Atreides	2014-06-01	With a few misstep here and there, this was rather interesting, and for me as Sansa fan, truly memorable episode. Long story short, Sansa and Oberyn ruled this, unfortunately in different directions.
Â 
The end was as gory as it should have been. I know some viewers don't like it, but the books leave no imagination to what has happened there, and the duel was nicely done. The Oberyn's mobility was something expected and there was a nice flow to it. Liked how he handled the spear, it was indeed nicely done. I loved the keeping "You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children" and Pascal was absolutely phenomenal in making each of those times slightly more irritated. I am sincerely pleased at how show maintained the twist we have in books, and how our hopes were crushed in the very same cruel way it was done in the books. I assume the Unsullied rage has went over the top...
Â 
On the other hand we have "from Aurora to Maleficent" Sansa Stark. The end is there. This is all we have from Sansa in terms of book material, and I believe that we have concluded with her this year. How I feel about this is another story. This was truly from zero to hero transformation and although it felt a bit too fast, this was something that truly opens entire array of possibilities. Now, we can either conclude that Alayne Stone is the mask that never went deep in Sansa's psyche, or at least that is where the show is heading. TBH, there is a huge gap between Sansa's Alayne in TV and Sansa's Alayne in the books. This transformation was, in terms of her playing the game, phenomenal, but there is a feeling that TV Sansa is going into, if not "warrior princess" mode, than in some sort of "ice queen" which, again, can be problematic. I do find her acknowledgement of what LF wants rather interesting, and I assume that this indeed is TWOW spoilers in which Sansa realizes what LF wants from her. As for the vamp costume, we should never forget one thing - she sow it. She made that costume. She was the one who made her look that way. Not LF or anyone else. Sansa has turned herself into a player, and that can go in many directions... All and all, if we are to end her storyline this year, it is in many ways, interesting ending. Now, at least no one can argue that she is silly little girl  
Â 
ETA: Let we not forget a bit crow-ish appeal of Sansa. Bloodraven, much?
Â 
In conclusion, interesting episode with Sansa and Oberyn taking the crown this week. Both Turner and Pascal were amazing and truly wonderful addition to the cast. I am going to miss Pascal... As I miss Oberyn 


Â 
I agree on all I loved the turn taken with Sansa it will be very interesting come next season or even this season to see where it will turn to now. The only thing I fear is too many know she is Sansa Stark now.Â 
Â 
I am sorry to see Oberyn go as well even if staying true within the novels it was still just as shocking and even more gruesome.Â 
Â 
I wonder if we will see Lady Stoneheart this season as well?Â
482	booknerd2	2014-06-01	Well, the gifs should be up soon on the net, but I can't wait to see Arya laughing and the Hound's expression in comparison. Gold!
483	sati	2014-06-01	Leslie in 10s with Gilly > Clarke. What the hell was that.
484	Raksha 2014	2014-06-01	Alright I'm still in shock because of the last scene, I couldn't even watch it.... man they went all the way.

Sandor dies and Arya goes to Gulltown. They created a lot of complications because they were too lazy to search for a better reasoninig.


Â 
Â 
Of course, TV-Littlefinger is not, in my opinion, as smart as book-Littlefinger. Â TV-LF is the guy who spilled his guts regarding his youthful traumas and lifelong motivation to his prostitutes as they were practicing. Â But it is a departure; the real LF would have properly prepared Sansa/Alayne to give the testimony he wanted.
Â 
Didn't book-Littlefinger tell Sansa at one time that the best liars use part of the truth to make their lies seem more real, or that their lies include some truth? Â If so, then TV-Sansa certainly used a good deal of truth in her testimony; her misery as a Lannister hostage, and Littlefinger's having taken her away from that. Â
485	Emperoreddy	2014-06-01	Â 
If the showrunners showed us the Red Wedding in that way that we all know, Why we should believe that they would not change Oberyn's death or make it worse?
For me the beatle scene was very good, it makes you think about of lot of things about the series


Â 
Thought it was an excellent scene. Showed us Tyrion's mental state with the fear of possibly facing his own death that is completely out of his own hands, and trying to find meaning behind the possibly meaningless. Like wondering if God (or the Gods) are just a kid with a magnifying glass burning aunts when he gets bored.
486	Tanda's Lintrum	2014-06-01	Perfect fight scene at the end. Absolutely and objectively awesome.
487	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-01	I'll be glad if i never see oberyn's death again.Â
488	Hodor H'ghar	2014-06-01	Oh yeah...
I actually think Grey Worm is balls and shaftless completely. I think his staring was him going "well hell. I really like her and its kinda awesome shes paying attention to me. She gives me reason to fight that i can keep in my feels box. But im a sad panda. If she likes me back, i cant give her the Big Main Thing and thats the pits. Maybe if i fib..nah that wont work either. I dunno. I think im in love but im not sure how this feels cuz i dont have man parts and i cant give her everything she needs or wants."


Â 
Maybe Grey Worm will discover Lightbringer, and have it melted down, and forged into into a Valyrian steel strap-on.Â
489	Wilhite	2014-06-01	I was sad to see the Hound and Arya at the Bloody Gate. Â I was hoping it would be important WHERE Arya leaves him. Â It seemed to me like a lot of the time in this one was wasted.

Thank you... Everyone are speaking about Black Swan and Maleficent, but in universe this was Bloodraven to the core...


Â Im a little on the fence about the costume change to be honest (outside the hair. That needed to happen), but i think its more raven imagery than Disney Villain. /shrug Like the Raven, some people might get the wrong idea about Sansa's Alayne persona. But in truth, its just misunderstanding and smoke and mirrors. Lies and Arbor Gold. Shes Sansa Stark, the girl who lost her wolf and home. But this time, shes not in a cage, shes sitting on a perch.Â Watching. Its beautiful and i love it! I ROOT FOR IT.
Â 


Â 
Ha! Â I just laughed out loud on that one! Â That's what I'm going to imagine every time Royce is brought up in the books!


Hue! Yeeesss.Â 
Â 


One detail I really liked was Roose showing no affection at all to Ramsay after his son kneeled and pledged himself to him.Â  Very Roose.


Roose needs a shave. Im pretty cool with that too. Roose is all "lel yeah ok. Just dont fuck it up."
Â 
Â 


Â 
Maybe Grey Worm will discover Lightbringer, and have it melted down, and forged into into a Valyrian steel strap-on.Â  


pahahahahah. Ahh...

Â 
Yes exactly. Tyrion spells out why ASOIAF is so compelling. The horror of insatiable sociopaths running amok.
Â 
Also provided a nice recap of the entire episode: Wildlings slaughtering people in Mole's town, Ramsay needlessly flaying and killing every Ironborn, Littlefinger being Littlefinger.
494	espresso	2014-06-01	The lord said Lysa Arryn died two days ago, and then I broke out laughing. What I didn't expect was Arya doing the same. Loved it!
Â 
Worried about the new Sansa, especially her costume, more like a dominatrix. I really really don't want her sleeping with Baelish.
495	teej6	2014-06-01	Sansa states that Lysa did what her father commanded her and then she says as many of us have. What does that imply? Poor Ned never commanded her to do anything. Did anyone catch that line. Did she say that for effect?
496	Ser Osis of Liver	2014-06-01	I wonder if Littlefinger was singing in his head, " I've got chills, they're multiplying, and I'm losing control. Cause the power you're supplying... It's electrifying!"


No, just the reprise of "Look at me, I'm Sansa D...." That was PRECISELY what was going through my mind when I saw her all in black.
497	Shawn Stark	2014-06-01	I gave it a 4, it was an ok episode.
I liked the duel a lot, except for the end because i had a really strong image from the book of the Mountain killing Oberyn in just one mounstrous blow, but that just a personal thing. Also that scene left me wondering, can a head actually explode like that?and with only the hands?
498	Frosta	2014-06-01	Anyone else worried abou how they're going to get Arya out of the Vale now that Sandor spilled her name?


Maybe they will think Arya was an imposter... since why would Lady Arryn's true neice laugh at news of her aunt's death?
499	Kronz	2014-06-01	You can't play "guess what song I'm belching" in a realm that has TWO songs.
500	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-01	Sansa OWNED! I love how she sort of leaned back on her previous lie--wherein she took a truth and refashioned it to suit her immediate need (her lie to Lysa). She's tested it, she's not just having a lucky moment of inspired thought. It's a personal happy buttons thing, but I've always preferred it when characters think things through than strike it lucky.Â 
Â 
Her revealing herself works better in the show version. Even if the characters in a show shouldn't know, I think there's an intrinsic disconnect when a main character is masquerading as someone else and the viewer knows what's what. Sometimes it's smoothed over with tension--is his/her secret about to be exposed?!--but the Vale lords don't quite fit that. So yeah, I thought it worked well to have Sansa basically swearing THEM to secrecy. Plus, Lady Anya looked like a badass Valkyrie! If we accept show!LF without the shadow of the books, I thought it was pretty neat having him be taken a wee bit off-guard by how savvy she was. Off-guard, but psyched.Â 
Â 
Erm, yeah, Ramsay and Roose are awesome. Is it just me or did show!Ramsay seem very book!Ramsay when he kneeled before Roose? Iwan Rheon's one of those rubbery actors who can change his look so much.Â 
Â 
I was sad we didn't have Theon's "I've got less than nothing to lose so imma gonna be pretty damn effective" Moat Cailin moment, but I thumbs-upped the parallel with S2. Theon seeing for himself how ridiculous a final stand was, but also seeing the dude's hardbitten pride. Gah. Would he rather be the guy who died in a stupid last stand, or Reek?Â
501	Raksha 2014	2014-06-01	The lord said Lysa Arryn died two days ago, and then I broke out laughing. What I didn't expect was Arya doing the same. Loved it!
Â 
Worried about the new Sansa, especially her costume, more like a dominatrix. I really really don't want her sleeping with Baelish.


Â 
 Â I hope not. Â But it looks like they're going into new territory, possibly TWOW; and maybe GRRM has written Sansa as being more of a temptress; hopefully just stringing LF along, but she might have to indulge more of hisÂ  Â   fantasies without actually giving up her maidenhead (which LF would hopefully be smart enough to want preserved). Â
502	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-01	Ok, I thought about it before giving my opinion. I didn't like the final Sansa scene because that's not who Sansa is. This whole "girl gets sexy make over to show improvement and self confidence and how she's ready to kick some ass!" it's something I hate, specially with Sansa who wanted to rule with love and be loved. Specially because in the show, Sansa changes from this to this, and we know that the latest wasn't but an illusion Sansa got trapped into, and it was what caused the ruin of her family (the illusion, I mean. Not her).
Â 
While I'm not a Sansa fan, I kinda feel what Stannis' fans feel, to be honest. Like the character has been "ruined", but I won't complain about it, though. I'll go and sulk at Sumerhall.
503	Fjordgazer	2014-06-01	Maybe they just won't believe him? Or maybe Bolton's will claim they have the real Arya in Winterfell?Â 


Â 
Any way they send Arya to Braavos, it will be very contrived after all these changes, that's for sure. I refuse to believe she will end in Ramsay's hands.
504	Konradsmith	2014-06-01	Indira Varma's reaction to Oberyn dying was fucking spectacular btw. She's just great!
505	HouseAllyrion	2014-06-01	I rewatched LF's trial scene and I still can't really understand what Sansa's motivations would be to save LF's ass by lying for him. The only thing I can think of is going back to season 2 (IIRC) when LF tells Sansa Â â<U+0080><U+009C>Look around you, we're all liars here and every one of us is better than you.â<U+0080><U+009D> Maybe the meaning finally clicked for Sansa after her aunt nearly tossed her out of the moon door that she would need to become a better liar and--I don't know.Â
506	Fjordgazer	2014-06-01	Maybe they will think Arya was an imposter... since why would Lady Arryn's true neice laugh at news of her aunt's death? 


Â 
That would be a way. Which would deem the whole affair of arriving-at-thebloody-gate innecessary, but it would be a way.
507	Tanda's Lintrum	2014-06-01	I just read the official westeros review of this episode and have never been more disgusted in my life. I appreciate the site runners for giving us this forum. But frankly I will never read anything they write about this show again.

Â 
I took is as LF surmised--better the devil you know. Lords and ladies have brutalized her; she had no reason to think these would rush to her defense if she threw LF under the bus.

Everything felt so rushed. But whatever. 
At least I could stomach Dany this episode.
511	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-01	Ellaria! Oh my gosh I love Indira in this! Her "you go babe, take your vengeance!" face near the end, vs. her screaming horror at the end, really hit me in the feels.Â 
Â 
Dany...eh, not really wild about Clark's acting. I liked Jorah's shaking anguish, but I always get a stagey feel from Dany. It works onstage, and can work on onscreen if all the actors are doing it (take Titus, for instance) but it sticks out here.Â

- Script-wise, D&D (I'm assuming they wrote it, I don't really know) were at their very low. Tyrion's infinite speech about fucking beetles, what the flying fuck was that? Roose showing Ramsay the cardinal points, like what? No, very, very weak
Â 
- Sansa's storyline is absolutely changed now. We're officially in WoW, folks. I was expecting Harry the Heir to pop from behind a column
Â 
- Missandei and Grey Worm...lame, really
Â 
- And, oh, my god, the beginning of the episode with the burping whore. That was a new low if I ever saw one
514	Duckfield	2014-06-01	What a weird episode! I'm left with a lot of questions, I really didn't like any of the changes and I don't know what they're trying to accomplish by them...
Â 
Â 
So, what's happening with Sansa now?Â 
What was the point of her wearing that fancy dress? Why did they made it look so meaningful?
Did Tywin fake that letter or was it just lost in the mail?
What happened to Arya and Sandor's horses?
Why did they make LittlefingerÂ look like such a pussy in the scene that should have showed everyone what a truly brilliant manipulator he is?
BEETLES?!?!
Why didn't the Night's Watch send someone to Mole's Town to warn them like they did in the book?
Why isn't there a word for cousin killing!?
Does Grey Worm have a dick?
Where do whores go?
Who killed Mr Burns?
Why are we here?
Â 
So confused....
515	Tony Stark	2014-06-01	It boggles my mind how some people can complain about how the show lacks subtlety and subtext, but then can't understand the subtlety and subtext of the beetle scene.


Â 
So much this.
Â 
I took it as insight on how Tyrion realizes himself having a position of power. His cousin is analgous to some of the terrible nobility that have no regard for the people they rule over.
Â 
Even more important, I think Jaime listened intently and will use the story as a reflection on his past self and who he wants to become.
Â 
Not to mention the damn fine acting of Dinklage.

Happy to see I'm not alone here -- my least favorite episode to date. I love the justifications I'm seeing here for the beetle scene as well, because using someone with a mental handicap as an analogy for the blind evils in the world somehow became synonymous with good writing...
On a positive note, the fight was accurate enough for me not to have any glaring complaints, regardless of how difficult it was to watch.

527	Zman1863	2014-06-01	I'm not terribly disappointed Â by the duel scene. I think it might have been improved if Gregor had some more lines. But I must confess that it isn't my favorite scene from the books since it's a display of abject stupidity that has the consequence only of spurring other characters from his region to more abject stupidity. So I didn't hype it up in my mind as much as many others have doubtless done.Â

For a moment, I though you meant the Unsullied soldiers realizing they now have dicks.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Of course, TV-Littlefinger is not, in my opinion, as smart as book-Littlefinger. Â TV-LF is the guy who spilled his guts regarding his youthful traumas and lifelong motivation to his prostitutes as they were practicing. Â But it is a departure; the real LF would have properly prepared Sansa/Alayne to give the testimony he wanted.


Â 
Agreed.Â  After all, this is the guy who teased Cersei Lannister about twincest in season 2.Â  Book-LF would never have been that dumb.
Â 


Â 
Maybe Grey Worm will discover Lightbringer, and have it melted down, and forged into into a Valyrian steel strap-on.Â  


Â 
And I thought MY theories were crackpot!Â  
Â 


Sansa states that Lysa did what her father commanded her and then she says as many of us have. What does that imply? Poor Ned never commanded her to do anything. Did anyone catch that line. Did she say that for effect?


Â 
Effect.Â  She was playing the poor victim.Â  Anya Waynwood (if not the others) were likely to be sympathetic to this point and it actually worked.
Â 


Indira Varma's reaction to Oberyn dying was fucking spectacular btw. She's just great!


She's fantastic!Â  And she's been wasted in this show.Â Â  I've said it before and will continue to say that I hope that they give her the Taena Merrywether role.Â  Maybe if I say it often enough D&D will hear it....
Â 


I get real sad sometimes, I watch an episode like that, absolutely love it and then come on here and it's getting hate for no good reason. Â 


Think of it like your mother, who loves you but criticizes everything about you.Â  Or maybe that's only true for daughters!

536	Kronz	2014-06-01	I voiced my dislike of this episode elsewhere and was accused of constantly complaining about the show not being like the book. Season four has been one of the best seasons of any show I've ever seen! I think that is what made tonight's episode even worse. I really thought it was shitty. Glimpses of interesting things capped off with one of the best fight scenes ever filmed...it just can't add up to a better-than-bad episode. I dunno, I just find people getting defensive and complaining about other people complaining very irritating (even if that's what I am doing.) Seeing almost every issue I had with the episode brought up independently at least helps me know I am not the only one. I am definitely not watching this show to complain about it failing to compare to (the admittedly much better) printed version. I watch it because it's a great show, but even great shows can have bad episodes. This show has easily had at least half a dozen bad episodes out of 38. That's still pretty good.

537	Widows_Blood	2014-06-01	I read this on another board about the Orson story:
Â 
I laughed for about five minutes after this episode aired. Don't misunderstand me. It's tragic what happened tonight. The show introduced a compelling character and spent the majority of the season fleshing him out beautifully, giving him purpose and deftly balancing his humor with pathos. He heroically fights for Tyrion in a visceral battle with The Mountain, filled with kinetic bravado, and just when you think he'll achieve catharsis, he's thwarted. He gets his confession as his eyes are gouged out and he's cranially decimated. Cersei smiles, Tywin sentences his son to death, and Tyrion stares dumbfounded.
Why?
Refer to the penultimate scene between Tyrion and Jamie. They talk of their simple cousin who spent his days smashing beetles. Tyrion is fascinated by his moronic actions while family legacies and Targaryen dragons fade into the background. All that's left is the sound of the killings.Â "And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it, and I had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."Â Orson gave no answer and he kept on killing until he was kicked in the chest by a mule and died.
This is Coen Brothers level absurdity, and at the end of this episode not only did Oberyn's death make sense, but everything else did as well. Suddenly everything from the Red Wedding to Ned Stark's death was put sharply into perspective. George R. R. Martin is the cousin killing beetles and the only thing left to do isÂ laugh.
538	Jasta11	2014-06-01	Whew, that was fast.
Â 
-The Mole's Town bit was a bit cliche. Wildlings are raiding as usual, Ygritte is evil enough to kill anyone in her way but babies are off limits so she's not THAT evil and we should feel sad when she dies.
Â 
-Grey Worm/Missandrei was well acted and kinda cute. But I really didn't care about it. Honest. They're side characters and we know it's going nowhere. But it was cute.
Â 
-Theon's actor is amazing, it will never be said enough. The scene was nothing special, but Allen still killed it. Also liked Roose and Ramsay's dialogue.
Â 
-Sansa going from pawn to player was a bit too abrupt. One episode ago she was making snow castles, getting gripped by Lysa and having childish disputes with Sweetrobin. Now she's a kinda vampy manipulator who masterfully lies to high lords and saves Littlefinger from his own folly, not to mention dat dress. I don't like Baelish in the books, but in the show he seems a bit too clueless. He really had no plan to properly explain the Lysa-cide? And didn't even brief Sansa? Cmon, he's smarter than that. Otherwise it was very well acted.
Â 
-Jorah's exile played as it should have. A bit sad we won't have his actor to up the level of acting in Dany scenes anymore, albeit Clarke did well enough this time.
Â 
-I really didn't like Arya being revealed. For Sansa it worked since it was in secret with honorable people, but the Arya Stark that was missing for more than a year announces her presence to the Bloody Gate within earshot of dozens of people and no one bats an eyelash? But the laughter was just golden. It ties in nicely with Tyrion's first scene; the sheer absurdity of it all means you can only crack up. I laughed as she did, honest. Also a great counterpart to Sandor's ''fuck me, I'll never get that gold'' face.
Â 
-Once again, the show attempts subtlety where book readers bemoans it has none, and once again it whooshes right over the head of several of them (us?). Just like with Cercei suddendly turning into Mother Theresa, there was a purpose in all this. The senseless killing and waste of life, unexplainable. It's Tyrion's defense mechanism, gallows humor at his finest. All the talk about dynasties and family legacies is just sugar-coating; in the end, it's only people killing people.
Â 
-The duel, oh the duel. Most anticipated scene this season after the Tywinicide, and it did not disappoint. They kept most of the book's good lines and the choreography was nice, albeit Pascal jumped around a bit too much for my liking. Speaking of Pascal, he aced this scene, going from confident to raging as the battle goes on, with all the swagger we expect from the Prince of Dorne. Tyrion's face in the end was also perfect; he's dead and has just realized it. I'm glad there was no vomit, that wouldn't translate well to the screen at all.
Â 
I am also rarely squicked by anything on TV, but my that was gruesome. The eye gouges while the usually calm Oberyn screams in pain? Chilling. But the head popping was over the top. Gregor is really strong, sure, but that would require way more force than what he can muster. The sound it made, you would think Oberyn ate a 12-gauge slug at point blank range or got his head hit by a heavy warhammer.

Â 
It was really just about Tyrion's powerlessness to effect his own fate. His mind turned toward the pointless and meaningless, and given his fate being decided, no surprise if it turned to a more morbid thought.

I don't see that as a problem.
541	Konstatera	2014-06-01	About the beetle-scene. Didn't they poke fun on George R.R Martin writing, a bit there? The retarded cousin that loves to kill bugs, is in fact GRRM who loves to kill his characters.
Â 
No one will admit it. But obvious that it was some sort of weird homage.
542	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-06-01	This was by far the strong Sansa Stark episode. Finally the naive little girl has grown up. She infuriated me endlessly with her story like view of the world. Maybe there's hope for her yet.

Yes I know. I just that it was amusing to connect the story of Orson with GRRM.Â
544	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-01	Arya's laughter works several ways. On the one hand, she's laughing because she's finally within reach of some measure of safety and again, it gets snatched away. She's just a couple of days too late. On the other hand: her aunt just died and that really doesn't seem to phase her. And, yes, like she said, she doesn't actually know her aunt. But hey, it's still her aunt.Â 
Â 
Not a scene to my liking.
There was some rumor that the Hound could be getting himself killed by the Knights of the Vale. In hindsight, that doesn't seem logical with Arya by his side. But then they could've just skipped the Bloody Gate alltogether. We've had enough close encounters and I don't think they're fooling anyone in to believing a Stark reunion is within the realm of possibilities. Â 
I think she is laughing because of her plight, every where she is taken her family ends up dead and she is at the fuggit stage.  The part where you've been through hell and you are just numb to it, so numb it's now comical.  That and most importantly, The Hound.  He can't catch a break, and now won't get his ransom money again and it's funny as hell to Arya.

Don't worry, you're not alone. My wife and I were almost too embarrassed by this one to keep watching. Very dissapointing stuff here (overwhelming, admittedly, a couple good scenes).
546	Newstar	2014-06-01	This is Coen Brothers level absurdity
Â 
The Coen Brothers comparison is apt, since Tyrion's speech brought to mind their movie A Serious Man, where the protagonist grapples with trying to find meaning in all the horrible things happening to him.
547	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-06-01	I think my problem with the duel is Pedro Pascal's selling of it. There was no sense of urgency. The anger wasn't there. The fury wasn't there. Before the duel starts, he has the man who murdered his sister and her children, raping the former, right in front of him. And yet, he's pandering to the crowd. 
I'm sorry, I just can't believe anyone would be that way in those circumstance. The choreography itself is why I give the fight a 7/10 because it could have been much lower for me.
548	raj34	2014-06-01	About the beetle-scene. Didn't they poke fun on George R.R Martin writing, a bit there? The retarded cousin that loves to kill bugs, is in fact GRRM who loves to kill his characters.

Yeah it was definitely an homage to George among other things.
549	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-01	The part with the beetles wasn't bad. But come on... people wanted the battle. I did. Bad terrible timing. They could have done it better at the start of the episode.
Â 
Anyway, the whole beetle thing is that even those who think they have the power, from idiots like Cersei, capable men like Tywin or entitled twatbeards like Littlefinger is that they can be outplayed too and be destroyed easily. Oberyn was winning and he then died.
Â 
When Tyrion asked his trial by combat, many Unsullied though Jaime would be his champion. Why? Because, among other reasons, as he was training with Bronn, he would suddenly unlock the super power of love and become powerful and defeat the opponent. We know that wouldn't have happened. He had been crushed by the Mountain. Here is the same. We thought that Oberyn would win and get justice for Elia and her kids, but the Mountain outplayed him during a reckless moment. Shit happens.
550	Brienne the Wench	2014-06-01	I loved the Red Viper's skills on display. We didn't really get too much backstory on his fighting prowess. They just showed us. That worked for me. Pretty much exactly how I pictured his fighting style when reading it. Absolutely brutal end. I hated to see such a great character die but what a way to go.


I completely agree! Â I thought his fighting was awesome! Â That was how I read it, too. He looked so graceful, and it all looked a bit effortless... SO sad to see him go too Â RIP Prince Oberyn!
Â 
Jaime's face while watching Oberyn fight was priceless! Â He looked so impressed! Â HahaÂ 
Â 
And Tyrion's face towards the end - his face was saying what we were all thinking... KILL HIM! Â Even though I knew the ending to this story, I still felt broken and traumatized! Â *sigh* Still heart-breaking.
551	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-01	Ok, I thought about it before giving my opinion. I didn't like the final Sansa scene because that's not who Sansa is. This whole "girl gets sexy make over to show improvement and self confidence and how she's ready to kick some ass!" it's something I hate, specially with Sansa who wanted to rule with love and be loved. Specially because in the show, Sansa changes from this to this, and we know that the latest wasn't but an illusion Sansa got trapped into, and it was what caused the ruin of her family (the illusion, I mean. Not her).
Â 
While I'm not a Sansa fan, I kinda feel what Stannis' fans feel, to be honest. Like the character has been "ruined", but I won't complain about it, though. I'll go and sulk at Sumerhall.


But isnt that the point? That isnt Sansa because Sansa is pretending to be someone she isnt. Think about it.
Â 


I just read the official westeros review of this episode and have never been more disgusted in my life. I appreciate the site runners for giving us this forum. But frankly I will never read anything they write about this show again.


Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Â 


Â 
So much this.
Â 
I took it as insight on how Tyrion realizes himself having a position of power. His cousin is analgous to some of the terrible nobility that have no regard for the people they rule over.
Â 
Even more important, I think Jaime listened intently and will use the story as a reflection on his past self and who he wants to become.
Â 
Not to mention the damn fine acting of Dinklage.


Yes this. People who dont get the beetle story make me sad and lose hope for intelligent viewers everywhere.Â

552	Baltan	2014-06-01	Amazing episode, way better than the last one.
Â 
I really liked the Vale, was really surprised, but in a good way. I gasped when LF said about people dying taking shits, and had to cough to cover my surprise and avoid my reaction to spoiler or hint my family.
Â 
The duel was S P E C T A C U L A R.
Â 
Pascal was amazing, he really nailed it. I'm going to miss him.
Also, I loved when he demanded to know who gave the order (he didn't in the book, did he?)
Â 
My nitpicking goes to Ygritte, and her spare-baby-I've-a-tender-heart depiction with all the blood dripping from the ceiling (that btw, that was awesome!). We know that Ygritte is a good girl, and that Gilly needs to live, but I thought it a bit cheesy. I loved the scene, although: someone had to take care of ugly whore.
Â 
The one thing I expected and was disapointed that didn't feature was the dialogue at Moat Cailin when Theonn goes around kicking the corpses, and when he asks who is guarding a tower, he realises it's a dead man, or something of the sort. I remember laughing really hard when reading that scene, and I just expected HBO making it a funny scene =(

The Coen Brothers comparison is apt, since Tyrion's speech brought to mind their movie A Serious Man, where the protagonist grapples with trying to find meaning in all the horrible things happening to him.

A fair enough reason for a monologue, especially in GoT, I just wish it hadn't come at the expense of comparing a person with a mental handicap to a mindless killer and going for some chuckles while they were at it :/ not the quality of writing I was initially drawn to...
554	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-06-01	Amazing episode, way better than the last one.
Â 
I really liked the Vale, was really surprised, but in a good way. I gasped when LF said about people dying taking shits, and had to cough to cover my surprise and avoid my reaction to spoiler or hint my family.
Â 
The duel was S P E C T A C U L A R.
Â 
Pascal was amazing, he really nailed it. I'm going to miss him.
Also, I loved when he demanded to know who gave the order (he didn't in the book, did he?)
Â 
My nitpicking goes to Ygritte, and her spare-baby-I've-a-tender-heart depiction with all the blood dripping from the ceiling (that btw, that was awesome!). We know that Ygritte is a good girl, and that Gilly needs to live, but I thought it a bit cheesy. I loved the scene, although: someone had to take care of ugly whore.
Â 
The one thing I expected and was disapointed that didn't feature was the dialogue at Moat Cailin when Theonn goes around kicking the corpses, and when he asks who is guarding a tower, he realises it's a dead man, or something of the sort. I remember laughing really hard when reading that scene, and I just expected HBO making it a funny scene =( I would have liked him demanding to know who gave the order if he hadn't pointed right to Tywin. It's like they're literally saying some people aren't going to be smart enough to remember the answer. Let's tell them as he asks. It's insulting.
555	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-01	But isnt that the point? That isnt Sansa because Sansa is pretending to be someone she isnt. Think about it.


Â 
Yes, I've thought about that too, she's playing him. But she's than playing the game too early already.
Â 
It's just, I didn't like the imagery. Many reasons can be given as why is she doing this, in the same way many reasons can be given explaining why Stannis burned "infidels"
556	Harry Lime	2014-06-01	Yes this. People who dont get the beetle story make me sad and lose hope for intelligent viewers everywhere.Â 


Â 
I bet these people watch The Silence of the Lambs and are like, "Why does Clarice spend ten minutes talking about some stupid lambs? I wanna see Hannibal eat some people already!!!"
557	Tyrek Sand	2014-06-01	Hello, long time lurker, first time poster.
I just wanted to say that the duel was fantastic and even though I knew it was coming I was mindblowned by Oberyn's death. The screams. THE SCREAMS!
558	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-01	Really found to episode to be excellent and actually pretty hysticarical, which was needed given the weight of the Oberyn death scene, the serious turn with Jorah's departure and Tyrion's impending change of scenery.Â 
Â 
That stretch of 10 minutes or so though where we got Arya laughing after hearing her aunt was dead while Sandor stands dumbfounded, Littlefinger mentioning "Some people die on their chamber pots" (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then the faces Jaime and Tyrion make while imitating the beetle-smashing was just fantastic. If someone finds/makes a gif of that last scene please let me know; it's gold.
Â 
Great ep. IMO.

559	Darth Pipes	2014-06-01	You could also say Arya laughing is a bunch of metahumor.Â  All the dead relatives (and dead mentors), all the near-misses of family members in the books and on the show...it was poking some fun at the situation.
560	Oakenfist	2014-06-01	There are different ways to interpretÂ the beetle story. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer.Â
561	espresso	2014-06-01	No word for cousin killing. Since Tywins death is kinda foreshadowed by LF, anyone thinks someone will kill a cousin?
Sansa killing Robin will be symmetrical. At KL, two people talk about killing cousins, and at Vale, two people talk about dying in a privy.
Other possibility: Jaime killing Lancel, though I see no point in that.
562	Defeatarion	2014-06-01	The part with the beetles wasn't bad. But come on... people wanted the battle. I did. Bad terrible timing. They could have done it better at the start of the episode.
Â 
Anyway, the whole beetle thing is that even those who think they have the power, from idiots like Cersei, capable men like Tywin or entitled twatbeards like Littlefinger is that they can be outplayed too and be destroyed easily. Oberyn was winning and he then died.
Â 
When Tyrion asked his trial by combat, many Unsullied though Jaime would be his champion. Why? Because, among other reasons, as he was training with Bronn, he would suddenly unlock the super power of love and become powerful and defeat the opponent. We know that wouldn't have happened. He had been crushed by the Mountain. Here is the same. We thought that Oberyn would win and get justice for Elia and her kids, but the Mountain outplayed him during a reckless moment. Shit happens.


Well when reading the book I thought Jaime at least trying to step in for his brother would have been cool. I realized he would have got rocked, Idk it kinda would have been pretty badass though haha. But I honestly thought Oberyn's path to revenge would lead him to become a POV. Man was I wrong.
563	NightStark	2014-06-01	Other possibility: Jaime killing Lancel, though I see no point in that.


Â 
We saw him kill a cousin in S2.

Agreed! Â I thought it was a great episode! Â The duel was amazing and Pascal - Perfection. Â Definitely going to miss him.
Â 
I guess I would be nitpicky about Arya's identity being revealed, and Sansa... her becoming this sort of temptress - did I miss something in the books?! Â It was kind of an off thing to happen at the moment, I remember her in the books as being a little bit more quiet and just following Littlefinger's lead... I wonder how far they're going with her new attitude - how far they will take her and LF's relationship...
565	gandalf.ohwaitwrongseries	2014-06-01	Did someone else notice the foreshadowing of Tywin's death when Littlefinger is talking to Robin? "People die all the time etc. ,..., even on their chamber pots"!!

They will haunt me. It was like watching a loved one. We are all Ellaria.
567	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-01	So when Tywin treats Mace Tyrell like his bitch and makes him get his quill and paper, Tywin draws up that pardon?  That's interesting, I don't remember it going down like that.

I know its sudden and struck me off guard too. But im ok with it. More than ok. Mostly because im ready for this kind of Sansa now. Ive been ready.Â 
Â 


Â 
I bet these people watch The Silence of the Lambs and are like, "Why does Clarice spend ten minutes talking about some stupid lambs? I wanna see Hannibal eat some people already!!!"


looool yeah they are. They are the people who cant sit still in movie theaters and wonder why theres no action.Â 
Â 


There are different ways to interpretÂ the beetle story. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer.Â 


There is one incorrect way to interpret it and its this: That its pointless and adds nothing to the narrative.Â 
That story adds a lot to Tyrion's character development, where his character is going, why he suddenly slips into Sherlock Scan Mode in ADWD material, and a layer of absurdity in this world of Cracksack. It also reflects on a lot of other arcs. Arya's murder motives, Brienne's fruitless search, Cersei's idiocy and handling the realm, Ramsay's brutality, Dany's fumbling of the responsibilities of ruling, etc.
Â 
Its there for a reason and it works. Sorry Beetle Haters, but deal with it.Â
569	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-06-01	We saw him kill a cousin in S2.that was the moment I thought of as well Jaime's escape attempt
570	go joff go	2014-06-01	I personally like that lf isn't the Gary stu he was in the books, that he can make mistakes of that something can be out of his control.  People treat that book characteristic, the perfection, like it's a credit to his character, but I think it detracts.
571	T.C	2014-06-01	Omg RamsayÂ
572	Not Dead Just Broken	2014-06-01	I'm sort of upset that they didn't give the Crannogmen credit for poisoning the Ironborn.Â  At least they showed them being sick.Â  Would it have been too much to ask for to have a "bleeping bog devils" or something?
573	JonInVa	2014-06-02	There are different ways to interpretÂ the beetle story. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer.

Considering what happened to  Oberyn you could even say that was a foreshadowing of another mindless killing machine smashing another creature just for the sheer pleasure of it, with Tyrion not understanding how that could have happened. A stretch, but eh.
574	NightStark	2014-06-02	I'm sort of upset that they didn't give the Crannogmen credit for poisoning the Ironborn.Â  At least they showed them being sick.Â  Would it have been too much to ask for to have a "bleeping bog devils" or something?


Â 
Yes because it would have needed explaining, the show watchers need things to be as subtle as a brick or they don't catch it.
575	StrollofShame	2014-06-02	Since the eye gouging was 'spoiled' by Lena's IG post..I'm just going to assume 100% that LS will be appearing because of the other pic she has up.

Yep. Had this thought too.
576	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-02	Did someone else notice the foreshadowing of Tywin's death when Littlefinger is talking to Robin? "People die all the time etc. ,..., even on their chamber pots"!!
I guess they are going to keep Tywin's death scene the same as in the books...


Had me likeÂ  
Â 
The amount of foreshadowing in this episode was pretty huge. Thought they did a really good job with the order tonight too. Having the Arya bit with her laughing because she realizes just how easy it is for people to die right after talking about how she'll be a better killer than Sandor (who is also about to "die" in the show via what he calls a flea bite, i.e. a pretty insignificant, little thing) and then immediately cutting to LF talking about all the ways to die (most of them doing ordinary things) was just fantastic. Also foreboding knowing his plans for Robin.Â
577	Defeatarion	2014-06-02	Yep. Had this thought too.


What picture is that? I missed it
578	go joff go	2014-06-02	Really found to episode to be excellent and actually pretty hysticarical, which was needed given the weight of the Oberyn death scene, the serious turn with Jorah's departure and Tyrion's impending change of scenery.Â

Â 
Great ep. IMO. everyone is focusing on the chamber pot comment, but does anyone think the dying on the bed and at a dinner comment is actually foreshadowing too. Lot of people speculate that cersei will be strangled in her sleep.  I wonder who might die at a dinner.
579	Alex21	2014-06-02	Â 
Thought it was an excellent scene. Showed us Tyrion's mental state with the fear of possibly facing his own death that is completely out of his own hands, and trying to find meaning behind the possibly meaningless. Like wondering if God (or the Gods) are just a kid with a magnifying glass burning aunts when he gets bored.


Â 
Â 


Â 
Yes exactly. Tyrion spells out why ASOIAF is so compelling. The horror of insatiable sociopaths running amok.
Â 
Also provided a nice recap of the entire episode: Wildlings slaughtering people in Mole's town, Ramsay needlessly flaying and killing every Ironborn, Littlefinger being Littlefinger.


Â 
There are a lot of ways to interpret Tyrion's dialogue but as I see we all get similar conclusions. Is for this kind of dialogues why I like the series, because the showrunners make you think and analize what is really happening and not only show you sex, blood and war.
580	Tony Stark	2014-06-02	Happy to see I'm not alone here -- my least favorite episode to date. I love the justifications I'm seeing here for the beetle scene as well, because using someone with a mental handicap as an analogy for the blind evils in the world somehow became synonymous with good writing...
On a positive note, the fight was accurate enough for me not to have any glaring complaints, regardless of how difficult it was to watch.


Â 
Â 
I see a heartfelt and introspective monologue, illuminating the fundamental values and beliefs your beloved, soon to be dead, brother lived by, just as good as what GRRM has in the books. Labeling it as bad writing because it isn't true to the mythos of the books, or whatever absurd criteria you have is just bad form. Considering there are too few scenes to even compare it too in the series, you can ignore the books and be glad they get character developemnt like this in the show. If you don't like the rare chance to have a 5 minuteish stretch for one character to show his chops and really delve into his character, I don't know why you are even still watching the show.

I saw this thought on my facebook and think it's so true -- did anyone else get a 'Princess Bride' "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die" feel to the scene? haha! I thought the scene was great! Sorry if anyone else mentioned this already, I haven't read through the whole feed.Â

Â 
Definitely not pointless.Â  I thought it as more of a "hey, we're about to do something that will make no sense to you and we realize we've been doing this for a while." Kind of prepping the non-readers for Tyrion losing the trial by combat.
583	NightStark	2014-06-02	What picture is that? I missed it


She has a pic of a heart made of stones on her Instagram with the title 'My stone heart'.
584	sj4iy	2014-06-02	I caught the episode late...yes, I knew what was coming, but there's no way to not react to something as horrific as that.  I got a bit queasy afterwards.  I will definitely not be rewatching that scene.
I agree with the others that the episode didn't flow well, bug I don't know if it's because of the story itself or the fact that I wanted to see the fight already.
Can't wait for next week
585	Not Dead Just Broken	2014-06-02	Â 
Yes because it would have needed explaining, the show watchers need things to be as subtle as a brick or they don't catch it.


Is it more confusing than just people being sick and dying for no reason?

I mean, we've already seen quite a few people die at a dinner and LF is obviously aware of that fact but yes, dying in the bed should probably be focused on as well. Is there a general Jaime-is-the-valonqar thread anywhere?
587	NightStark	2014-06-02	Is it more confusing than just people being sick and dying for no reason?


Â 
Yes because there are dead bodies all around them which bring disease. If they had started talking about bog devils the show watchers would have either totally missed it, or heard it and with no background information to explain it they would have just glossed over it.
Â 
Show watchers don't know who the Crannogmen are, what they do with their weapons etc. They don't even really know where Jojen/Meera come from in my experience.

					
					
							Edited by NightStark, 02 June 2014 - 12:12 AM.
588	Raksha 2014	2014-06-02	As a whole, the episode was good, I'd give it about a 7.75.
Â 
Highlights were the Moat Cailin scenes and Ramsay/Roose moments, Sansa turning the Lords (and Lady Anya) into her BFFs and protectors while taking the heat off Littlefinger, and the Viper/Mountain duel (except for the last moments, which I deliberately did not watch).
Â 
Alfie Allen nailed it as the frightened, conflicted Reek trying to summon up an identity that he is too traumatized to believe in anymore. Â Ramsay actually sold me on his joy at being rewarded by his father with the Bolton name. Â (wonder if TV-Bolton realizes that he's just signed his and Walda's death warrants; no way that even TV-Ramsay will just sit by and wait for Walda to pop out a baby boy to supplant his chance at lordship). Â 
Â 
While we've left the mothership with Sansa's revelations to the Vale-lords, Sophie Turner sold Sansa's anger and misery at her experiences of the past years very well. Â And that cool little look between her and Littlefinger, as Sansa is being lovingly embraced by Lady Waynwood, was marvelous. Â I'm still surprised by the rapport between Littlefinger and young Robin; completely different from the books. Â Maybe they're setting up LF's perfidy by having him apparently be kind to the kid before starting to poison him.
Â 
I thought the fight between The Mountain and the Viper was well done; but it should have been a minute or two longer. Â (his squire looked a lot like Olyvar from the brothel, anyone know who it was?)
Â 
What I didn't like so much: Â the opening scene with drunken patrons and prostitutes in Moles Town - too long; its only relevance was, I guess, to flesh out the wretches that the Wildlings were about to slaughter and remind us that Gilly and her baby are there too. Â Didn't work for me; I felt no empathy for anyone other than Gilly. Â And sparing Gilly does not redeem Ygritte as far as I'm concerned; what did the unarmed whores ever do to her, not to mention the innocent villagers she cheerfully slaughtered in the earlier episode. Â 
Â 
I was also less than thrilled by the length of Tyrion's story about his beetle-killing cousin. Â I guess it was meant to be a comment about the immorality of senseless violence, but it didn't quite work for me. Â 
Â 
I've been enjoying the development of the Grey Worm/Missandei relationship. Â That probably portends one, or both of them, being gruesomely slaughtered at some future date.
Â 
What else didn't work for me? Â Arya laughing idiotically at the news of her aunt's death. Â I just didn't think the character would do that. Â She didn't know that her aunt was crazy and had tried to murder her sister. Â I would have thought that Arya might be slightly saddened that yet another member of her extended family, perhaps the last powerful adult who could be relied on to help her, was dead.
Â 
As for scared maiden Sansa suddenly morphing into Dark Goth Sexy Game Player Sansa...well, we'll see what happens there. Â It did happen a bit fast, as had been noted by others. Â I would guess D&D wanted to fast-forward into TWOW territory, but it should have happened with at least one interim step.

Nah...it will be touched on later. Trust me. We havent seen the last of Moat Cailin and we'll get more info on it when more time is spent there. Keeping the illness something of a mystery is actually clever and sets up for a future crannog revelation.
591	Baltan	2014-06-02	I would have liked him demanding to know who gave the order if he hadn't pointed right to Tywin. It's like they're literally saying some people aren't going to be smart enough to remember the answer. Let's tell them as he asks. It's insulting.


Â 
Did it need to be subtle? I mean, it's ok to keep the suspense, and to allow people to dig their own conclusions, but Oberyn's hate towards Tywin was no secret since the first episode, and it was plainly set. Oberyn demanding Gregor to sell out Tywin while pointing him is rather a passional reaction, that I think fitted perfectly to the situation.
HBO!Oberyn was willing to bring them both down at the same time: more subtleness wouldn't have worked in this heated all-or-nothing fight, I think.

Didn't Robert die in his bed?Â  Or maybe a reference to the failed assassination of Bran?Â  Isn't that enough?

A little love for the book readers is not unprecedented.Â  I just felt they rushed the scene but that's probably just because I'm unreservedly pro-Crannogmen and House Reed.

Â 
Fits in with my Oberyn is trying to die theory quite nicely.Â  I'm okay with it.
594	theramblingfool	2014-06-02	Oberyn vs The Mountain was the most intense chapter of fiction I think I have ever read.Â  I remember my heart pounding through the scene, the tangible feeling of excitement as the guy I was backing went into full revenge mode.Â  Every move he made was visceral, full of hate for the man that (raped and) killed his sister and her children.
Â 
This was, quite frankly, ruined in the show.Â  Don't get me wrong, the fight was exciting.Â  The choreography was great.Â  I know the unsullied were on the edge of their seats, so that's a point for D&D (fwiw).Â  But the raw emotion that fueled Oberyn was COMPLETELY GONE.Â  He was SMILING half of the time, twirling his spear and literally looking to the crowd for confirmation.Â  I just can't help but feel like that scene lost a lot of its weight from replacing his anger (his primary motivation for the fight in the first place) with gleeful showmanship.Â  To be fair, near the end of the fight, when Oberyn smelled the blood in the water, when he was closing in on the kill, his character showed this a lot more, but why didn't they just do it right from the start?
Â 
The majority of what I'm reading is just praising the scene, but I can't understand it...

Very doubtful. They're shaving off characters everywhere, they're not going to add in a thread about hobbits with poisoned spears. It doesn't even have much significance in the book truth be told.

And to be fair, there is no point in complaining about the changes in the show at this point, that ship sailed ages ago.
I have no problems with the changes as long as I am entertained and I have been fully entertained by this episode
I love Missandei and Grey Worm, D and D are doing a good job at fleshing out all the characters in Dany's camp.
Â 
Also Sansa owned this episode, loved it!Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Wowwow thats one hell of a nitpick! hue! I didnt even remember them. Bronze Yohn is gr9 doe.


MTEÂ 
Â 


Alright I'm still in shock because of the last scene, I couldn't even watch it.... man they went all the way.
Â 
First, people need to stop complaining about Grey Worm and Missandei. They have great chemistry, they are very cute together, it makes even historical sense.... powerful, rich eunuchs have married in the past, so why not??? The two of them are replacing a lot of characters from the books, so they will have very important roles in the story after Daenerys flies away. Heck, they will probably survive all the way to Westeros and be important there.... it makes sense from the show's perspective.
Â 
Â

Agreed, I dont get the complain of Missandei an Grey worm.
599	Baltan	2014-06-02	Hi everyone! First post here on the forum - woohoo! I saw this thought on my facebook and think it's so true -- did anyone else get a 'Princess Bride' "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die" feel to the scene? haha! I thought the scene was great! Sorry if anyone else mentioned this already, I haven't read through the whole feed.Â 


Welcome to the forums  ! Yeah, totally XD
There are a lot of homeages in this series, btw.
600	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-02	Â 
Didn't Robert die in his bed?Â  Or maybe a reference to the failed assassination of Bran?Â  Isn't that enough?
Â 


Of course it is, was just providing thought to the previous response. I took the "chamber pot" to be the only one that meant something going forward, just a little easter egg for the book readers. Didn't overly think much of the "in bed" or "at dinner" since we do have examples of those that have already been seen/used.
601	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-06-02	I think Shae is supposed to die in bed.
602	teej6	2014-06-02	Ok, enough with the people who don't get the beetle story are stupid line. I think most people do understand the point of it and it's not like it's so hard to understand. The point is, it was terribly long and dragged on when the whole point could have been made in a minute or less.
603	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-06-02	There's one thing I am confused about. Â Sweetrobin will go on a tour of the Vale, right? Â And it looks like Sansa and Littlefinger will go with him. Â But Arya and the Hound are at the Eyrie. Â Aren't they going to meet? Â I wonder what they're planning to do.
604	doghouse	2014-06-02	Attack on Moleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Town
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Pretty brutal attack and interesting way to start the show. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know if Ygritte the hateful would spare the baby and mother but I guess it shows she still has a little bit of heart.
Â 
Grey Worm & Missandei
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Bleh. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to get sidetracked in this story when there is so much other stuff to attend to.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Moat Caitlin
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I loved the way this went down. Just when you thought Theon was going to crack,Â  an ax to the head changes everything and it cuts to a flayed body. This is exactly how this should have happened. It was quick and sweet also.
Â 
Littlefinger & Sansa
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know how I feel about the suicide angle. I think I like the singer better. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know how this will play out with the Protectors of the Vale and Robin. Robin was scared shitless about leaving the vale but I will reserve judgment on the new twist until it plays out.

Jorah & Barristan
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I thought this was done beautifully. Excellent call and response between Jorah and Dany. I felt sad for Jorah as an old used-up knight with no friends.
Â 
Roose & Ramsey
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  What a tender moment.
Â 
Arya & The Hound
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I love that they got in that poison is a womanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s weapon. I also thought it was awesome that Arya was laughing uncontrollably when she heard the news of Lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death.
Â 
Jamie & Tyrion
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Not as good as previous dungeon talk. I wanted him to hurry up and end the beetle story already.
Â 
The Mountain and the Viper
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Holy Shit... that may be the greatest segment in television history.

Â 
AgreedÂ  with this.
Â 
Good episode overall, i respected their changes and what they went for.
Â 
What really sucked was that they haven't had a good Mountain character since the first season.Â  This guy wasn't even tall, couldn't act at all, and really made for an anti-climactic fight.Â  At the finish he was way too unhurt-seeming, and throughout he completely lacked menace.Â  Pedro was ok, though.Â  Not sure why Jaime was smiling to much.Â

Yeah he was definitely the least intimidating 8 foot tall guy I've ever seen. I think I could have taken him.

I believe the next episode will show that Arya and the Hound left the Eyrie after finding out that Lysa was dead, but the show did a poor job of presenting that.
613	Ruin	2014-06-02	And the House Corbray reference was a plus.Â  I want to see Lady Forlorn!

616	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	Â 
Very doubtful. They're shaving off characters everywhere, they're not going to add in a thread about hobbits with poisoned spears. It doesn't even have much significance in the book truth be told.


Howland Reed was mentioned in the show. Im sure they will add the crannogmen in some fashion. Probably mentioning them when Asha arrives there or something. I dont expect them to go to Crannog Country until next season.
Â 


Ok, enough with the people who don't get the beetle story are stupid line.


Well..they are. Sorry. But they are. And complaining about it is making them look stupider.Â

His arms which are thicker than my entire body aren't scary at all.Â

Â 
Â 


Â 
Yeah, he's a total hypocrite. He becomes Kings Guard to the Usurper of those he is sworn to protect (Arthur and gang went down fighting 'our knees don't bend easily') then 'leaves' them for Danenerys because they chuck him out...probably wouldn't have left otherwise.
Â 
I'm not faulting him for his actions but he is a hypocrite to get all 'you dirty traitor' towards Jorah.

The Coen Brothers comparison is apt, since Tyrion's speech brought to mind their movie A Serious Man, where the protagonist grapples with trying to find meaning in all the horrible things happening to him.


Thank you! I KNEW there was a film that scene was reminding me of and you named it. I also liked Tyrion's lower-self comment that scoffing at handicapped people made him feel normal.Â 
Â 
Ah, I forgot Arya. I loved her reaction. It was both weird and proof she's not a total coldhearted child soldier, despite her casual "ehee, killing evil fuckers is fun!" I like the gradual slowing of Sandor. It makes sense he'd ignore a "little" wound that gets infected. I also adored the look of "WTF OMG FML!!!!LGDKGSDF!!!" in his eyes at the end.Â

Barristan never pretended to serve one king whilst actually undermining them to serve another, unlike Jorah.Â  He served the Targaryens loyally until the dynasty fell, and he served the Baratheons until they dismissed him.
621	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-06-02	I see right through what they're doing with Arya. What they want to do is portray that she's lost her mind and that so much death has caused her to become a psychopath/sociopath. They want to show her as incapable of feeling. This will contradict what the Unsullied thought they knew about Arya and will give her an out when she becomes a ruthless killer.
622	Kronz	2014-06-02	I took the laughter to mean she was affected by the absurdity of missing her saving grace by a hair, yet again. She's never met Lysa so has no reason to really laugh at her death psychotically (she just might if they'd met, of course.)
623	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-02	Â Defeatarion your avatar is hilarious! Also, sad but still funny.
624	Ruin	2014-06-02	Oberyn's spear was also a plus, though for a moment I thought it was The Mountain vs. Zhao Yun.
625	DrownedSnow	2014-06-02	I rolled my eyes more than a couple of times but I liked so much of the episode, even some things I didn't like I think make sense.
Every episode I see more and more it was a HUGE mistake to not have Ygritte and the wildlings attack in like the first episode. All this raiding and killing women/children is hurting that arc. Jon's race to the Wall and packing up Mole's Town to save them/defend Castle Black would have just been great TV. THEN you could have let the Wall chill off until the end of the season and Stannis' arrival.
The stuff with Grey Worm and Missandei is a confusing distraction but it's for the viewers and I fear it may set up a soul-crushing Grey Worm death.
Lysa a suicide and Sansa just straight Starking herself? That may work out to make sense in a way but I'm not sure where they are going with it. Also, a huge shift in Sansa's character. Does this lend credence to Winds of Winter theories? Anyway, it's way different but I was totally locked in from the moment Littlefinger suggested that it was suicide. I don't like Sansa sort of accepting Littlefinger's perving of her but the fact that she is trying to take control is a nice change.
Roose must have been holding back that letter declaring Ramsey a Bolton for a long time. I kind of like that. It's very much like Roose to do that.
Jorah getting the boot exactly as we figured they might do it and it does work for the show.
Fucking A, they are legit trolling us by giving Jojen's catch phrase to Oberyn.
The fight was amazing though and I still felt such pain seeing Oberyn get cocky instead of just finishing him off. For a second I almost believed. That punch knocking out like half his teeth was just nuts. Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't The Mountain stay pinned down by the spear in the book?

Didn't actually notice this during the fight, but I'd imagine it's because his love for Tyrion. Jaime wouldn't want Oberyn to lose this fight.
Â 
I thought this episode was solid overall.
Â 
Ramsay's legitimization actually moved me, which was wholly unexpected. And I just loveÂ Michael McElhatton as Roose.
Â 
About the beetle scene. I thought that the core idea there was powerful and meaningful, and I loved how it resonated through just about every fiber of this show. However, like some other people have stated, it went on for far too long. Also, as (only) one other person has pointed out so far in this thread, the way Orson Lannister was talked about was downright offensive--both the jokes and comparing someone with a mental handicap to a cold-blooded killer. Sure, it fits the world. But it wasn't sensitive enough to work in our world.
Â 
I thought the fight was wonderful. It was so gruesome I felt sick there at the end, and I was trembling. Seeing Oberyn screamÂ hurt.Â My only qualm with the fight was that they cut the "If you do not say her name, ser...seven hells" line. Still, I thought it was great.
627	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-02	Great fight scene. The wail by Ellaria was perfect, exactly how I imagined it in the books.Â

Yup, it was a bit tweaked. Book!Oberyn jumps on his chest, only for the Mountain to reach up and drag him down. He definitely shattered his teeth though. I luuuurved (in a sick way) Oberyn's teeth skittering over the ring. This ain't no tragically romantic death.Â

Dude we are in kindred agreement.Â 
Â 
Ramsay's Bolton-morph moved me because he looks so close to choked up. This ain't a dude who bows out of habit, but he's kneeling for Roose. As he should, obviously, but it was like his childhood dream coming true. To a total nutcase, but whatevs. Plus Roose is like a suaver Scar aping Mufasa.Â 
Â 
Oh, Lannister reaction GIFs!

630	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-06-02	Yeah, there was no wrestling match like there was in the books. The wrestling match sold the desperation well in the books. But the way it happened in the show is ok because it goes with the way Oberyn had been acting and the way everything happens so abruptly.
631	Eurymalys	2014-06-02	Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't The Mountain stay pinned down by the spear in the book?


Â 
He sure did. I'm thinking that would have been something of a nightmare, logistically, though. It always sort of confused me in the books too--how's he pull Oberyn on top of him with that spear in the way?
632	Fjordgazer	2014-06-02	Harry Lime's example with Silence of the Lambs and people who get worked up about the beetle dialogue is spot on. Jesus, and then you complain about the Unsullied...
Â 
It's on par with other often-praised dialogues in the series. It's just that we were obviously desperate for the duel (rather understandable).
Â 
I rewatched the episode, and my only nitpick remains the same: how the hell are we having Arya at Braavos at the start of next season (to the end of this one is pretty impossible now)? Anyone's guess is as good as mine?
633	Emperoreddy	2014-06-02	Yup, it was a bit tweaked. Book!Oberyn jumps on his chest, only for the Mountain to reach up and drag him down. He definitely shattered his teeth though.

Â 
Then you see his half toothless mouth screaming in pain afterward. It was beyond brutal, but really brought home his utter fall due to his hubris and desire for revenge.Â 
Â 
Ya I caught that bit about the Hound "slowing up" since he got bit. I am already getting sad thinking his end is just sitting on his neck. Loved Arya's laugh, just so much going on there. Laughing and Sander, at the absurdity of it all, and again plays into that good beetle scene.
Â 
Liked Tyrion admitting it made him feel normal to good on his cousin as well. Just a lot of good characterization going on there, and ya I got a Coen Brothers vibe too.

Â 
Re: Missandei and Grey Worm, I was a little impatient with those scenes, but I think they almost have to reestablish the fact that liberating people from slavery is actually a good thing - giving people the right to fall in love where they will and to determine their own fates despite what's been done to them is the outgrowth of liberation. Dany's storyline, and the audience's ambivalence about her and her motivations, makes it seem like there is some ambiguity to the right and wrong of the matter (which in her world, there might well be, but in our world, shouldn't be open to question. I like nuance in storytelling, but slavery - no.) Missandei and Grey Worm establishing their own motivations and relationships makes it clear that they haven't just traded one set of dictatorial masters for another, that there's actually substance to freedom.
Â 
Pleased that they're speeding up the Sansa storyline.
Â 
Wonder if Arya "outing" herself may add credence to the later Bolton plot with the fake-Arya - if everyone has assumed that she's dead up till now, but then there are rumors that someone has seen her, it makes it more believable that the Boltons have found her.
Â 
Arya's laughter struck me as a coping mechanism.
Â 
Should I be worried about the fact that I actually felt something for Ramsay (who I generally detest) when his father legitimized him? Sympathy for psychopaths seems like a bad sign.....
641	eumaies	2014-06-02	His arms which are thicker than my entire body aren't scary at all.Â 


Conan Stevens (season 1) could play the menacing part.Â  This guy was just some bellowing extra without an ounce of menace beyond his costume.

Â 
Yeah, but at this point we all assume that S04E09 is 100% stuff at the Wall. Season finale will be15 or so minutes longer than average, but they' have several other storylines to wrap up.
643	zeus	2014-06-02	One thing that i knew was going to happen was when Jorah gets a pardon letter in the first season, then when barristan selmy turns up (and doesnt confess to danny that jorah was spying)
Â 
And in this episode he gets another letter saying he is pardoned.Â 
Â 
kinda just something they mustnt have thought of when writing this episode.Â

645	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-02	Oh, and on re- watching I do think Sansa may have seduced LF.   What better way to control him? It's a way to protect herself and possibly Robert Robyn Arryn. Depending what she thinks will be most advantageous to herself.  She's holding all the cards.  At any point she could tell the truth about LF pushing Lysa out the moon door.
We know that Sansa Stark is still a secret among the Lords Declerant, hence Arya has no sanctuary in the Vale. Though if I was as desperate as Arya, I would ask help from my cousin Robert,Mir I knew I had one.
How does Arya get to Bravos?  Easy.  Read the book!
On the way to Saltpans, the Hound is sickens from His wound. He appears to die and Arya will remember the coin, J'aquen Hagar and sail for Bravos.

Â 
At least we won't have to worry about this casting discussio anymore. He won't need his head to play the part anymore 
Â 
Oh yeah, the fight was hardly improvable IMO.

Â 
Arya is totally sailing there this season. Too much feature of the city.

649	Newstar	2014-06-02	I liked Arya laughing at news of Lysa's death, even though it seems like it would be out of character for her.
Â 
My take on the beetle monologue on a meta level was Orson = GRRM, beetles = ASOIAF characters, and Tyrion = horrified audience.  It did seem to dovetail with a lot of the other plotlines in the episode featuring horrible brutality: Ramsay, Gregor, the wildling attack, etc.
Â 
I really thought this would be the episode where Arya abandoned the Hound, but I guess they're saving that for the finale. I'm also surprised we didn't get a scene with Pod and Brienne, but I'm also guessing that they're saving something big for the finale for that arc, if you know what I mean and I think you do.
Â 
Sansa's last scene in 4x08 seemed to tie off her arc neatly, but I assume we'll get to "check in" with her in 4x10.

Winterfell has been in the opening sequence of this season and the last one and we haven't seen it in two seasons.


Yeah, because Winterfell is the core of the story, in a way: it needs to be always held in our hearts (!?). That's why I was saying that Braavos was getting too much feature, even early in the story, with the whole Stannis and the IB plot,Â  for the season to end without our main window to the city (Arya PoV) sailing there.

Â 
Yeah it was but it's obviously been rebuilt. The opening sequence often bears little relation to where the episode is actually going to take place, Dragonstone has been in it several times when no time is actually spent on the island in the episode.

Â 
Good episode overall, i respected their changes and what they went for.
Â 
What really sucked was that they haven't had a good Mountain character since the first season.Â  This guy wasn't even tall, couldn't act at all, and really made for an anti-climactic fight.Â  At the finish he was way too unhurt-seeming, and throughout he completely lacked menace.Â  Pedro was ok, though.Â  Not sure why Jaime was smiling to much.the actor playing the Mountain now is 7'2"
654	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	the actor playing the Mountain now is 7'2"

Let's try 6'9, not small still, but he doesn't, how do I say, really convey his size.

Â 
This guy has the right build though, they could have stuck with Ian Whyte and had Gregor at the right height but he would have been built like a whippet.
Â 
This lad is 100 pounds heavier than Conan Stevens even though he's slightly shorter, he's much more powerful looking.

656	Emperoreddy	2014-06-02	Correct me if I am wrong, but that was a twisted reprise of the Stark theme playing as the Bolton army was marching towards what I assume was Winterfell right? If it was that pretty much confirms that if there was any doubt and is a nice, chilling touch.

Stevens was the guy, he had the face and demeanor down. Ian was tall, but he looked lanky, this guy is no doubt a monster, but in armor he looks more round, and he doesn't have a very hard face. 
I mean I'm not blaming the guy, he's certainly a giant lol, just the feel of him is off, great scene regardless though, but nothing strikes intimidation into me like Stevens in season 1 calling for his sword.

658	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-06-02	Like I've feared for quite a few episodes Jon Snow looks to be missing his highlight moment where he leads the defense of the wall. Thorne and Slynt to save the realm? I hope they came up with some brilliant twists that don't make this the case.

He's huge but he looks like a cuddly bear. He has such a baby face
662	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	The guy playing the Mountain also is like 400 pounds. 6'9" 400 lbs is huge in my book

There's no doubting he's huge, and a strong mofo at that. But we're not looking up his stats while watching. In the armor he looks more round, and his face doesn't look hard. He might be huge but (to me anyways, everyone else can feel as they like) he doesn't have that "edge"
663	NightStark	2014-06-02	It's the beard that ruins his face really, it makes him look like a jolly lumberjack.
Â 
Here he is with a bit of stubble and a snarl; http://img2.wikia.no...s/2/23/Thor.jpg
Â 
When he snarled with the beard he looked like he was squinting against the sun while trying to choose which tree to take down next.

IDK, I mean ya season 1 Mountain was definitely the best, but I thought this guy gets the point across. Big brutal killing machine. He is just round and built like those guys in the strongest man in the world contests...the ones where they are lifting huge stuff. None of them are "built" instead being quite round, yet beastly strong.

Yeah i know he's insanely strong, but this is a visual medium and he looks clumsy big when just recently Bronn described him as faster than he should be. Plus that face, if he would've kept the helmet on lol

There his face actually looks semi good, but Stevens good, but definitely better than that the happy lumberjack
667	clawson24	2014-06-02	Trying to find the best way to express all my reactions so I'll just quickly break it down by segment:
Â 
The Duel: One of my 3 most anticipated scenes of the season (with Stannis' arrival and Bloodraven/CotF introduction being the other two). I wasn't thrilled with how it played out but the more I think about it the more I can make peace with it. My expectations were probably a bit unrealistic given how epic and incredible the book passage is. Not enough lead-in time. That Tyrion/Jamie beetle conversation should have been trimmed by 2-3 minutes to give the Oberyn/Gregor scene more time. Oberyn was too playful for the beginning of the fight. This is a moment that he's waited for, for two decades. He would never be smiling and laughing into the crowd while slinking around. The choreography itself was pretty decent. Major props to Pedro Pascal for getting pretty damn adept with that spear and his movement. The Mountain was a bit too oafish for my taste but I absolutely realize how hard it is to choreograph a fight like that so I know I'm probably being greedy wanting it to have been longer/even more involved. That death though, my f'ing god. One of the most disgusting/disheartening things I've ever seen on TV. I wanted to see it depicted on screen so much after having read it, but when the moment approached, I really wanted to look away. Ellaria's scream made it so much worse. Man.
Â 
Sansa/LF: Totally wasn't expecting the Sansa reveal and yet I suppose it doesn't really bother me all that much. Sophie Turner's proven to be a great actress at least. Littlefinger being so vulnerable this early on was jarring though. And as an utterly inconsequential nitpick, I didn't like Bronze Yohn's portrayal. Nowhere near as bad-ass or intimidating as I expected.
Â 
Arya/Hound: The Hound so plainly revealing his and Arya's identities felt very off. Struggling to understand why it was inserted into the show.
Â 
Meereen: Grey Worm/Missandei was very emotional and very well-acted, but took too much time for such a minor plot point. I thought Jorah was terrific in the banishment scene and Dany was decent, which is a major improvement from her normal blah acting.
Â 
The Wall: I liked this scene between Jon and the NW brothers. It reminded us a bit about Grenn, Edd, etc. before we'll get to see them all in action during what should be an epic Episode 9. Also reiterated just how badly the odds are stacked against them.
Â 
Mole's Town: A bit too "generic wildling slaughter" for my liking. The decision to have Ygritte spare GIlly makes sense in a "Emotional Viewer Manipulation 101" way for her impending death, but was a bit odd considering her emotionless slaughter of everyone up to that point.
Â 
All in all, I was expecting a 9/10 or 9.5/10 and instead felt it was a 7.5/10. The duel was good to great but I suppose it could never quite live up to the book for practical reasons. I've seen Oberyn's death twice now after re-watching the episode and never plan to watch it again (shudders). Here's to a strong finish to the season with so many potentially incredible, memorable, awesome TV scenes in the next 2 episodes.
668	NightStark	2014-06-02	Arya/Hound: The Hound so plainly revealing his and Arya's identities felt very off. Struggling to understand why it was inserted into the show.


Â 
I don't think you can just rock up to the Bloody Gate and say 'Hey I'm the Hound and this is some random girl..let me in'. Arya was his bargaining chip so he had to reveal her identity.

669	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	He's huge but he looks like a cuddly bear. He has such a baby face


Yeah hes a big snuggle bug and its hard to take him seriously when his face is visible. When its just the big guy in the armor, he looks just fine. I love this guy cuz hes a cuddle monster, but as the Mountain, other than his bigness and moves, he doesnt sell it. But i guess it doesnt matter cuz he got the job done and looked huge doing it.
670	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-02	I'm pretty chillaxed when applying a rule of cool stamp on stuff, but I do have some film experience so maybe my two cents is worth...three cents? Adjusted for inflation. I think, in terms of the Mountain being an intimidating opponent, they could've choreographed/directed him a bit more savage. He was kind of a glacier. Implacable, sure, but not particularly offensive until Oberyn sashayed too close. I need to voyeur on the Unsullied boards to see what they thought of it. My only quibble was that the Mountain could've come across as more savage force of nature. I've seen comparisons to Rob Roy floating around, but that doesn't really fly for me, as part of the amazingness of the Rob Roy scene was realizing the bad guy wasn't just a sadistic fop but a nimble little death-monkey in a duel . "Oh SHIT...oh COOL...OH NO!!!" basically.

671	Maria26	2014-06-02	Two scenes stood up for me.
Â 
First of all, Jorah's banishment. It was even more brutal onscreen than it was in the book because of how close they were. I found it HEARTBREAKING. I knew that they were gonna make Barristan found out. The way Jorah's was on his knees, pleading for Daenerys to forgive him. Both Emilia and Iaien were AMAZING in that scene. It's a shame that we won't see them together anymore because this was probably one of my favorite pair since season 1. They just worked so well together. New adventures are now awaiting Jorah and I can't wait to see how this will play out.
Â 
Then the Duel of course. There were some parts that played totally differently than what I imagined but it just worked. This was a great scene. Don't really buy the new actor as The Mountain but Pedro Pascal nailed it for two.
672	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	OMFG. okay that mountain vs viper battle was way more brutal to watch than to read. i just can't. still shocked. Beautiful choreography by the people doing the fight. Oberyn kcked ass with the spear.Â 
Â 
Sansa's development, too soon? I'm not sure, enjoyed Sophie's scenes though, what a performance she gave those eyrie lords!
Â 
Aryas laugh ..?Â 
Â 
Tyrion's story about the beetles...can't remember if this was in the book, a metaphor for Tywin or someone else?
Â 
Love the relationship that is developing b/w missandei and grey word, absolutely precious. Nearly cried in the jorah/dany scene. Happy with the performances of both emilia and iain. So heartbreaking. Good ol' Barry as well, being a badass
Â 
Ironborn/Bolton. Did not expect to see the flayed man Â  Â   Â and it wasn't explained well, WHY the ironborn were dying in moat cailin? what happened to mention of the bog devils? Loved ramsay's glee at becoming a bolton Â  
Â 
Gilly scene and wilding raid was a good scene. shows Ygritte isn't just a senseless killer.

Â 
As they said in one of the YT videos on the episode, the armour is heavy and restricts movement. When the second strongest man on the planet is having trouble with the weight of the armour I don't think there is much anyone else could have done in it.
674	Ramsay Gimp	2014-06-02	They keep denying Roose his best lines. At this point I fear we'll never get to see "rue the day I raped your mother..."Â
675	Lone Star Pate	2014-06-02	Peter's face captured the shock and astonishment that most everyone must have been feeling at the conclusion of the trial by combat.Â  It was pretty gruesome which I guess was the intended effect.Â  Oberyn was laying into The Mountain while he was on his feet!Â  The fight choreography for Oberyn was spectacular.Â  The whole scene went by much quicker than how I envisioned it while reading this part, would have liked to get more of this.Â 
Â 
I like where they're going with Sansa becoming more savvy and getting more of an upper hand with Littlefinger.Â  He's not sure of her intentions and she's still suspicious of him.Â 
Â 
Arya's hysterical joker laugh caught me off guard too.Â  I interpreted it as her laughing at The Hound being thwarted again and also slightly losing it when she finds out she's still far from anything resembling home.
Â 
This is actually one of my favorite parts in the ASoIaF saga since it's a turning point where Tyrion is sentenced and Jorah is exiled (again).Â  Should be interesting to see these two opposite each other on screen later on.

Â 
I can see that, season 1 Mountain came off that way. It was kind of scary watching him just flip out on his horse and go for Loras. Not so much a glacier, but an avalanche with an angry mind.
677	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-02	Â 
Yeah it was but it's obviously been rebuilt. The opening sequence often bears little relation to where the episode is actually going to take place, Dragonstone has been in it several times when no time is actually spent on the island in the episode.


yeah plus The Wall is featured in about every episode, but wasn't really featured much of season 2 and 3.

I find filming limitations interesting but it's the final product that's critiqued. Agreed, I was more viscerally "EEK!" when S1 Gregor went bonzai on Loras. I understand it's a different actor, just commenting I don't find him as threatening as the S1 tourney scene. That dude was definitely an avalanche more than a glacier, which (mayhaps a bit more in retrospect) made the Hound more of a badass for going toe-to-toe.
Â 


They keep denying Roose his best lines. At this point I fear we'll never get to see "rue the day I raped your mother..."Â  


Patience my sweet. It's so horridly awesome I'm pretty sure it'll be in S5Â  
Â 
Arya's laughter made me grin. I felt a ton of empathy. That's totally the kind of thrice-fucked situation I'd either laugh or cry at, and Arya doesn't cry (when it's not Gendry).

679	ARYa_Nym	2014-06-02	In that zap2it interview Maisie said that Arya is indifferent about her family. Perhaps the laughing scene is where she got the idea since we know she doesn't read the books.

Â 
"She's completely given up on [reuniting with her family], and it almost feels like they've given up on her because she's like, where were they?" Williams says. "She's angry. She feels like she's the only one who's been trying. Where's the search party looking out for her? Why did no one recognize her? She's angry at the fact that she's trying so hard -- she was angry at the fact that she was trying so hard -- and she can't see any of it coming back.
"Where's Jon? Why has he not come back? And obviously no one knows [where she is], and there's reasons for that, but in her head [she's thinking] 'You're all being really, really selfish and I'm the only one, so now I've given up. Good luck, have fun, hope you don't die.' That's literally it. And she's like, I won't. I know I can do this, because look how far I've come already without you guys. Whereas you, I don't know you anymore. I tried to help you. I tried to get back with you, but [shrugs]."

Â 
Â 
I laughed but I don't think it was in character. Mainly because book Arya very rarely laughs. In the books she didn't want to go to Lysa and when she found out she was dead all she thought was she had no aunt and moved on.
680	clawson24	2014-06-02	Â 
I don't think you can just rock up to the Bloody Gate and say 'Hey I'm the Hound and this is some random girl..let me in'. Arya was his bargaining chip so he had to reveal her identity.


Â 
Solid point. I suppose it was more the reaction of the Knight of the Gate then that put me off. Seemed to be little to no surprise/reaction to the announcement that one of the most sought-after people in the entire Seven Kingdoms had just arrived at the Eyrie's doorstep.

683	Kelsey094	2014-06-02	Loved the episode. 
I did not expect the head crushing to be honest. I even discussed it with my bf (who doesn't watch or read) and he said they probably couldn't show such a thing. Man was he wrong, lol. The exploding was a bit too much I think. It would be more realistic and still shocking if it just crushed.
I like what they did with Sansa. I love to see her play the game. As long as they don't go too far with it just yet.
Maybe we'll start next episode back at the last scene and see Tyrion puking and getting escorted back to his cells? Would be a nice opening scene.
Arya laughing was out of character yeah, but I liked it. I don't think she has to go 100% dark and murdery. I like a bit of humor in it.
Poor Jorah, but it had to happen! I wonder when we'll see him again next year.

The sansa stuff was interesting. one of my most fistpumpingly awesome moments in the books is when lf reveals his plans to her at the end of affc. It looks like we arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t going to get that, but I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really care. her stuff was really really good. she really is a player now. that was great. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure where theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re going with it, but I have faith.
The arya thing is why histarical laughter is weird. My family was just confused. 
Overall, I think this might be my favorite episode of all time. I absolutely loved every moment. Really good stuff. 
I like the grey worm/missandei story. Its kind of cute. Just like I absolutely loved the sam/gilly scenes
By the way, it blows my mind how people can live post while watching the show. Great multitasking
688	Damorian	2014-06-02	Not bad, and while it WAS gorliy effective in terms of what was there, I'm slightly gob-smacked they left the much hyped trial by combat to the last rushed five minutes, much as per the bear pit scene in E08 last year.
Â 
Couldn't believe it when I looked at the clock, it was nearing the 50 min. mark and the fight had only just got going! Presumed that like the Purple wedding, it was pretty much locked to be a 15-20 minute segment at least? Weird.
Â 
Overall all, I love the show and the hard work that goes into it, so will be sticking with it in S5, but tbh, by this point in S4, they also seem to have replicated the massive problem of season 2 with their finale BIG time, i.e: left way too much for even a (marginally) extended final episode.
Â 
The certain upshot now, since E09 seems solely centred on the wall and the battle for castle black, is that one or more of the remaining plotlines WILL end up feeling rushed and short-changed in a 60 minute finale (and no, it won't be 66 at all after titles, credits and/or recap. More like 60 tops. Knowing that is sadly based on past experience.)
Â 
That's not really a statement of opinion; having followed this show from the beginning and watched how it either allocates too much time or subtracts too little time from scenes - ESPECAILLY when placed under pressure of the clock - it's more one based on mathematical fact.
Â 
The good news: I fully expect them to nail Tyrion's climactic scenes in 4x10, but at what cost? Whose story will end up becoming the new "what the hell just happened with Theon at Winterfell?" or Houses of Healing, condensed and truncated into baffling insignificance? Which massively powerful moment will come out Robbwind-disappointing in the wash?
Â 
Since they've clearly excised Arya's vision of Nymeria, this is arguably the episode that should at least have established some hanging Freys showing up with salt stuffed in their mouths in the Riverlands. They didn't so if LS DOES show, prepare yourself for cries of "jumping the shark!" & "Deus Ex Machina!" from non-readers because of that frustrating oversightÂ  - zero set up has been done.
Â 
Ideally this one would have been a longer 58-59 mins cut.
Â 
They needed to check in with Bran and co.
Â 
They needed to effect the Hound's demise, at least in part (much better set up here, admittedly) and get Arya in position ready from Braavos.
Â 
They needed to squeeze at least one iota of emotion from Kit Harrington who has been appalling this season where I've always defended his acting in the past.
Â 
Ditto Emilia Clarke, whose coldly imperious queen routine is wearing so thin now, it almost robbed another rushed (hugely rushed through) scene in the banishment of Jorah of any real sense of this being a two-way tragedy. So thank god for Ramin's score and Ian Glenn.
Â 
It's also worth bearing in mind that as good as it may be, The Watchers on The Wall is highly unlikely to surpass Blackwater in peoples' minds, especially since characters like Jon, Ygritte & Stannis are among the lesser favourites, performance-wise, compared to the Kings' Landing crowd. It can compete SFX-wise, but that's about it, most likely.
Â 
Which means that taken as a whole, so much is riding on the finale as to how S4 will be remembered: success or patchy failure?
Â 
Trashing things is not in my nature, so hope springs eternal and all that ... but my gut feeling by this point if I'm honest, no matter how hard I try to banish it, is that despite some standout scenes in individual episodes, time is running out to stop season 4 becoming the runt of the litter.
Â 
Prove me wrong, show. Prove me wrong. 
Â 
Â

689	ovis alba	2014-06-02	The Beetle story was weird. I sort of got the point, put it just felt like it took away time from other stuff and I was waiting the whole time for some sort of "evil" Tyrion who in the end admits that he just started smashing beetles himself to see what is the point and realised it just feels damn good and powerful and then smashing the beetle in his hands.
690	aussiegirl	2014-06-02	That was a very good episode and very rough to watch!

I honestly can say that there wasn't any scene I didn't like. And the acting was top notch except for Sansa's scene where she is sewing. Sophie Turner swallowed half her words there.
Â 
Loved the whole Arya/Hound scene. Like that there are so many interpretations about why she laughed and their discussion about killers. Although I'm not sure how they are going to end them for the season. They only have one more episode left and that one is packed.
Â 
Really liked littlefinger in this episode. I hope they are going to do something interesting with Little Robin. Because he's not supposed to make it, I actually hope he does. I hope he grows up to become Lord of the Vale in his own right and screws everyone else's plans up.
Â 
Roose is back. I only like Ramsay when he is with Roose. Still don't care about Theon/Reek.
Â 
I'm not sure why everyone keeps saying that Arya outed herself. It was the Hound that did that.

Even more than season 2? I dunno, season 2 was kinda gnarly, mang. You got a point but i really dont think its as bad as season 2.
692	Andrey	2014-06-02	i love hate facebook comments under westeros.org review
"did comic book from simpson wrote this, geeze"
Â 
apparently when you write constructive criticism with arguments, elaboration, knowledge and cultural examples you're the most stereotypical caricature of nerd
Â 
like reviewers are the nerds that bitch, not people with teamsport fans generic arguments
Â 
that's way many book apologist (not all, mind you) scream: "better something, than anything" "it was fucking EPIC dude" (using just that word like it means something, in other words they're totally inarticulate) like the dumbest kids in my the literature analysis class ("Camus put the lost dog "subplot" in The Stranger to prolong the short book")

693	red5_standinby	2014-06-02	I had a totally different view on Arya's laughter.Â  She was laughnig at the Hound.Â  Remember, he is still on her list, so she doesn't like him.Â  She despises him, and would have left him had she had the chance to survive a trip on her own.Â  He's been trying to ransom her for some time now, but once again, time has prevented him from getting what he wanted.Â  She was laughng in his face.
694	Jorah the Explorer	2014-06-02	Just checked and the beetle scene went on for six minutes. Â SIX MINUTES! Â Such a waste of time, considering some of the other scenes could have used a bit more length.
695	Druze	2014-06-02	Lots of changes but I found I could live with most of them.
Â 
Â 
Theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve added Moat Cailin to the credits, but still no Eyrie?Â  WTF?
Â 
Moletown â<U+0080><U+0093> good to show the attack.Â  I guess it was good to have a named character (Gilly) there to witness it.Â  By the way, I noticed that there was less nudity in the brothel than they would typically show.Â  Hoping thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the direction in which theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re heading.Â  A much as I hated the farting of Bear and the Maiden Fair, it was a welcome break from naked whores number 59 to 63 on the screen.
Â 
Missendei/Grey Worm â<U+0080><U+0093> So, are they now saying that Unsullied have penes? I always thought everything was removedâ<U+0080>¦ I do get that they need attractive people to show naked/having sex, especially if you believe the story that Emilia has refused any more explicit scenes, but that seems a little weird.Â  Both actors are very good looking, though, and their story is kinda nice if you donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about all the stuff being eliminated from the books to incorporate their romance.Â  But what was with Missendeiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s delayed reaction in covering herself?Â 
Â 
Theon/Ramsay â<U+0080><U+0093> Alfie Allen continues to be flawless as Theon/Reek.Â  I liked the way the ironborn guy got axed in the headâ<U+0080><U+0094>it reminded me to Theon getting bonked on the head during his epic speech about capturing Winterfell.Â  LOVED Theon regressing into Reek when challenged and then regaining his Theon-ness when that guy was killed.Â  I liked how they showed the renaming of Ramsay and the explanation that the Boltons now = the North.Â  However, they have done away with all other Northerners in the show (Umbers, Mormonts, etc.) so it will be strange if/when they show any sort of reaction/rebellion against the Boltons.Â  Also, why did Ramsay refer to â<U+0080><U+009C>a new homeâ<U+0080><U+009D> BEFORE he was legitimized â<U+0080><U+0093>he hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been given Winterfell yetâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
The new Sansa â<U+0080><U+0093> I really liked this approach with Sansa being honest then manipulative.Â  I think it works for the older Sansa, because Sophie Turner is too old and too tall to be taken seriously as a frightened child.Â  The problem is that so many people know that she is Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0094>everyone knows that the more people who know a secret, the less likely it is to stay a secret.Â  Also, it looks like they may be heading for â<U+0080><U+009C>relationsâ<U+0080><U+009D> between â<U+0080><U+009C>Manipulativeâ<U+0080><U+009D> Sansa and Petyr.Â  Not sure I can watch that if it comesâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Where is Sweetrobin going?Â  Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m assuming that they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to pay for snow special effects on the Eyrie (or theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve forgotten that Winter is Coming) so they had to come up with another reason for them to leaveâ<U+0080>¦BTW, I was thinking that they could have made Sansa blonde instead of brunetteâ<U+0080><U+0094>that way they could simply have allowed the actress to go to her natural hair colorâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Jorahâ<U+0080><U+0099>s exile â<U+0080><U+0093> Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad they kept it in, but why a pardon from Robert Baratheon?Â  Why would it take so long to reach themâ<U+0080><U+0094>Robert died 3 seasons ago!Â  Jorah might have been able to explain it away by saying that he subsequently switched allegiences.Â  Wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a pardon from Joffrey have made more senseâ<U+0080><U+0094>since that would demonstrate recent betrayal?Â  Also, I thought Dany should have shown some indecision here based on the many things that Jorah has done for her.Â  She always seemed ungrateful in the books (but even there she wanted to forgive him), and this made her seem doubly so.Â  Instead, we got Her Imperiousness Daenerys Stormborn.Â  Also, why wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t she looking at Jorah when condemning him? The way she was looking over him seemed stupid to me.Â  I would have been okay if I thought it meant indecision, but it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t appear to.
Â 
A random crackpot theory popped into my head in this sceneâ<U+0080><U+0094>Barristanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dismissal from the KG by Cersei and Joffrey was a sham and a way to get him into Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s inner circle so that he can hurt her from within her own army!
Â 
The Hound and Arya â<U+0080><U+0093> Nice foreshadowing to her future as a Faceless Person, including her ability to kill people in whatever manner was available.Â  I liked the irony of them arriving at the Eyrie after Lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death.Â  However, I would have preferred it to be clearer that her laughing was hysteria, not humorâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
As much as I adore Jaime and Tyrion together, I thought that scene was painfully long.Â  I would have preferred to spend the time with Oberyn
Â 
The Trial â<U+0080><U+0093> Pedro Pascal is THE MAN and killed this scene (until it killed him).Â  His lines could have been cheesy, but he delivered them well.Â  That flipping around and fighting was AWESOME.Â  Only issues I had were no â<U+0080><U+009C>Eliiiiiaaaa!â<U+0080><U+009D>(but I'll survive) and the exploding melon head--câ<U+0080><U+0099>mon Special Effects, you could have done better.Â  Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not a fan of seeing bodily functions on the screen, but Tyrion vomiting would have been great here.Â  This scene could have been a couple of minutes longer too, to include more of the preparation.

The pardon wasn't 3 years late nor from Robert Baratheon but was rather a cunning Tywin Lannister removing one of Dani's two seasoned Westerosi advisers by exposing his past transgressions.   They talked about her a couple episodes back in a session of the small council and Tywin was informed that she has able advisors at her side.  In classic Tywin fashion he sent a letter in a dead man's name that he knew would drive a wedge in her advisors and of course Poor Robert Baratheon will get the blame for the exposing of Norah while Tywin keeps his hand clean like he did with the red wedding by letting the hate fall mostly on the Frey's
696	Verily No One	2014-06-02	I wouldn't mind the Missandei/Greyworm scene if it wasn't at the expense of other characters/storylines from the books. They have so little time and so much ground to cover and they add on these immaterial IMHO subplots. Why not flush out Jon's/Stannis' characters.


Could not agree more.
697	Zizou	2014-06-02	Just watched the episode, and even knowing what was coming, I felt sick to my stomach by that ending. DAYUM I really liked Show-Oberyn
698	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-02	I can't remember all of Sansa's AFFC stuff Â but how much was there besides the marillion trial and heading down Â south? looks like they're done with that.

There's still the Harry the Heir plan, assuming they're keeping it.
700	Frequency	2014-06-02	That letter got to Meereen awfully fast, even for Raven standards. And it was too large too for a Raven to carry comfortably.
Â 
I wonder if adding Moat Cailin to the intro for such a short scene means we will also have Stannis taking it back next season. Hopefully he doesn't dwell too long at the Wall.

Â 
Â 
There was Sansa getting SweetRobin down the mountain with Myranda and Mya and then reuniting with Littlefinger, which advanced her metamorphasis from scared Sansa Stark to Littlefinger's Apprentice slowly and believably. Â While I though Sophie Turner did very well with the lines she was given, I found it harder to believe that in one or two days, Sansa goes from terrified, victimized (physically by Lysa, sexually by Littlefinger with that unsolicited kiss) girl to a cunning manipulator capable of selling 'lies and Arbor gold' to lords (and a lady) three times her age and surprising Littlefinger himself, not to mention the acknowledgment of Littlefinger's sexual interest in her. Â
702	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-02	I had a totally different view on Arya's laughter.Â  She was laughnig at the Hound.Â  Remember, he is still on her list, so she doesn't like him.Â  She despises him, and would have left him had she had the chance to survive a trip on her own.Â  He's been trying to ransom her for some time now, but once again, time has prevented him from getting what he wanted.Â  She was laughng in his face.

Nope. Definitely not. Exasperation. She's been in arms reach of salvation more times than she can count and the futility of her efforts just gobsmacked her.

There are elements in this season which makes me believe that Benioff did not use only the begining of AFFC and ADWD and the last half of ASOS to make the show, they gave us some of WOW


Â 
Yes, next season will include a fair amount of WOW and the show is going to finish before the last novel is out. Â George will probably change the story up, but for me, I am just happy that I get to see a version which is obviously sanctioned by the author.
705	-Ghost-	2014-06-02	When is Balon gonna die
706	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	Nope. Definitely not. Exasperation. She's been in arms reach of salvation more times than she can count and the futility of her efforts just gobsmacked her.

Agree. This was her Sirius Black laughing after Pettigrew blasted apart the street moment.
707	Bran's Legs	2014-06-02	I still think they failed to show the process that was turning Sansa into a game of thrones player... And more Littlefinger looked like a fool. So now that show's Sansa is on the game what about her next chapters? Now that they just jumped over her learning process her next great moment is when Littlefinger tells her to marry the heir of the house arryn after little robert dies... But sansa is already kind of ruling it.


Â 
Sansa has been learning the game ever since Cersei killed her wolf. Her education was the worst kind. She's like the pawn that survived the chessboard and now has been transformed into a queen.
708	Bran's Legs	2014-06-02	I didn't like this episode at all. All the changes and additions are really making it hard for me to enjoy the show.


Â 
I thought this exact same way for a long time, but you've just got to let it go. The TV show is not supposed to follow the book. The books are simply good source material and that's it. The show stands on its own. For me, it's actually more enjoyable that way. When the show first started to "go off script," I was a little offended. Now I welcome it. I don't want to know what's going to happen with every little subplot. Give me some surprises.
709	Girlicious	2014-06-02	I knew what was coming but I didn't know Gregor would smash his head in!
Somehow, it fits Oberyn. He lived his life to its fullest, passionately, he got an intense death and a somehow honorable one. He died for his sister memory and defending Tyrion.
Â 
As LF said, some people might die on their chamber pot.
I also wonder where that leaves Sandor and Arya. Are they going to just turn back and split?
If so, then it would be almost impossible for Sansa NOT to know that her sister and the Hound came in the vale, would it?
Such a great season!
710	Jinjonator	2014-06-02	Sansa's entire arc since Ned died has been about learning to lie, adapt, and survive. Why are people suddenly pretending this came out of nowhere?
711	ache	2014-06-02	I rewatched LF's trial scene and I still can't really understand what Sansa's motivations would be to save LF's ass by lying for him. The only thing I can think of is going back to season 2 (IIRC) when LF tells Sansa Â â<U+0080><U+009C>Look around you, we're all liars here and every one of us is better than you.â<U+0080><U+009D> Maybe the meaning finally clicked for Sansa after her aunt nearly tossed her out of the moon door that she would need to become a better liar and--I don't know.Â 


Â 
Yeah, I don't really get why she'd do what she did, In the book it made sense, because LF was the only one to know her secret so she felt that she had no choice but to go along with what he said to save herself. In the show, she is not protecting LF to save herself since she already told the Lords who she really was, her safety already hinges on her, not him so why lie for him?
712	-Ghost-	2014-06-02	Im also wondering whata gonna happen with Sandor and Arya. Are the guards just not gonna tell anyone that Lysa's niece was just there? 
They also mentioned House Corbray in the episode. I wonder if we will get Lyn next season. I hope so.
713	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-02	Â 
Yeah, I don't really get why she'd do what she did, In the book it made sense, because LF was the only one to know her secret so she felt that she had no choice but to go along with what he said to save herself. In the show, she is not protecting LF to save herself since she already told the Lords who she really was, her safety already hinges on her, not him so why lie for him?


So she should sell out the guy who singlehandedly saved her from Joffrey and then from Lysa shoving her out of a 2 mile dead drop? Seems like decent motivation to save his skin just once...
714	Clariana	2014-06-02	Sansa states that Lysa did what her father commanded her and then she says as many of us have. What does that imply? Poor Ned never commanded her to do anything. Did anyone catch that line. Did she say that for effect?


Â 
Haven't seen the ep yet, but Sansa did not do what her father commanded her to do, ie shut up and get ready to leave KL, rather she went and squealed to Cersei... Leading to his death. So is she being ironic???
715	Floke	2014-06-02	By the gods, the duel. The duel! All through the episode I'd been saying to myself "please make it gory, please make it gory" and then when they got at it "fook's sake, you made it gory!". My only complaint is that Oberyn's scream nearly covered the Mountain's speech and, yes, Tyrion's beetles story was longer than the duel itself.
Sansa's scenes confuse me, though. Are they going to speed things up and throw in TWoW material for the next seasons?
Moat Cailin scene was decent but a bit weak. The stronghold is mostly as I pictured it, but couldn't they just have Ramsay explain why is it (so freaking!) important for him, where is it located and who were the Ironborn stationed there? Non-readers might mistake them for Asha's men instead of the remains of Theon's Winterfell force, since the former we just saw run away 3 episoded before and the latter haven't been mentioned since S2.

For me the issue is less that they're deviating from the books, and more that I don't believe the writers are anywhere near competent enough to do ASOIAF justice with their fanfiction. Some of it turned out quite well, like Tywin encountering Arya, but most of it has been substandard garbage that's barely fit for a bad action movie or a daytime soap opera. I seriously worry for future seasons because it sounds like the fanfiction will only increase.
718	Tyrion1991	2014-06-02	Yep, they managed to make Dany look like an ungrateful bitch whos making the wrong decision.
Â 
For me they really needed to hammer home how betrayed and hurt she was over the fact that her bear did this to her. Plus, Jorah is a lot more contrite than he is in the books and doesn't argue with Daenerys "us sewer rats saved your city" where hes indignant with her. As it is, Dany, especially at the end of the scene, comes across as way too hateful how shes staring him down. In the books, she can't bring herself to look at him as hes dragged out and has to excuse herself because shes that upset about it. Indeed, when she first hears about his spying (which we don't see in the show admittedly) shes reduced to tears.Â 
Â 
Plus, the part where Dany says "don't you ever dare presume to touch me or call me by name". That is true to the books and I am sort of glad it was put in. But it makes no sense in the context of the show as its specifically referring to the chapter where he kissed her and called her Daenerys. Jorah in the show has never once, that I can think of called her by name or presumed to touch her. So this just comes across as a venomous retort whereas in the books its making reference to his prior bad conduct. A far better line, especially in light of last weeks argument, would have been to retain when she says "you told me to trust nobody else but you", yet the show conspicuously removed those lines.Â 
Â 
Theres also not the same of sense of shock when she repeatedly asks him if he told them about Drogos child. In the books this is something which it takes a few chapters for her to realize this and its "something unspeakable occured to her". Indeed, when she initially finds out about the spying she refuses to believe it. But in this scene, there is no sense of shock or disbelief, which makes it seem like Dany is far too quick to pass judgement and doesn't take it any where near as badly.Â 
Â 
This was not a moment for the imperious Queen routine and it really harmed Danys portrayal. Its particularly worrying because the "inside the episode" videos lay such stress on how betrayed and hurt Dany is but they've specifically removed those aspects from the books in their adaptation and focused exclusively on the arrogant stern Queenly figure passing judgement.
Â 
Plus, in the background, this is obviously a forgery by Tywin Lannister due to his lines last week in the council and because in the show we saw Jorah get given the real pardon in season 1. So it actually is a forgery even if it is true. The show even hammers the point home by having Jorah point out that creating discord is in the interests of Tywin. Its like big flashing lights shouting "Danys making a stupid mistake" and this really colors her actions in a negative in what should be a very personal matter. In this context its obvious that Dany should just keep Jorah on and simply end how close they are too eachother due to their broken trust. Exiling him is not in her interests and whilst that might be also true in the books GRRM is much more subtle and point isn't really made until ADWD after the decision that Jorah was kind of useful to have around. Â
719	ache	2014-06-02	So she should sell out the guy who singlehandedly saved her from Joffrey and then from Lysa shoving her out of a 2 mile dead drop? Seems like decent motivation to save his skin just once...


Â 
Yeah...The same guy who set her up to be blamed for the murder of the king and provoked her aunt's rage by creeping on her. I don't think it counts as her "selling him out" if she had refused to lie for him. Sounds more like justice to me.Â
720	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	Â

Agreed, but as she said, better the devil you know. I think her actions made sense Â in the context of the show.
721	Mel_Rose	2014-06-02	I'm surprised they fully showed Oberyns death, and i can honestly say that was the most brutal and gory thing i've seen on TV.Â 


Â 
Â 


no tyrion vomit? i think i want to vomit


  on both counts
Â 
Â 
It was horrific, just horrific, the sight of the head and the screams... the ep ended and I was so hypertense I didn't know what to do with myself.
So, ahem, well done show.
722	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-02	That was very rough to watch.
723	direwolves_and_dragons	2014-06-02	Tyrion 1991, agree with you completely on the Jorah front. Â They needed to include the kiss in my opinion (even if they had added it later, that would have been cool, perhaps as an act of desperation once he learns she is sleeping with Daario, I just think it is necessary for the context). Despite him being a dick in the books and arguing with her even after I still felt a little sorry for him, but completely understood why and what Dany was doing (irrelevant that I think she later comes to regret it, he did massively f*** up and refuse to accept his mistake) but in the series, I just felt completely for him, admired Ser Barristan, and hated the way they portrayed Dany here.
Â 
Thought rest of the episode was sik, only other reservation, Missandei and Grey Worm, I have no issue with, as such but I will always want more screen time material that is more relevant to the books.Â
724	MoIaF	2014-06-02	Â 
 Â  Â  Â  Â

Amen. To. That. Â I'm just glad that I knew when to turn my head away.Â  Â

Â 
The Blast From the Past: I never liked Obyreyn Martel for a simple reason: he was a loudmouth who was more style than substance, talked a big game and never backed it up; a man whose reputation far exceeded the man he was, and who seemed preoccupied with being right more than he ever was occupied with winning.Â  So, he lost.Â  He lost because he could not keep his mouth shut; he lost because he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t as good as he thought, he lost because he underestimated a man whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation BELIED underestimation; he lost because he thought he was touched by gods, when, in fact, he was just touched by a Mountain.Â  
Â 
And he lost because he thought he had one up on Tywin.Â  Yeahâ<U+0080>¦ no.Â  
Â 
I cheered, just like I did in the books, just like I knew I would watching it.Â  The fight and the buildup were perfect (the fight could have been longer, BUT â<U+0080>¦ getting two actors who have LIMITED sword/spear fighting abilities to choreograph a fight is â<U+0080>¦ really fucking hard- anything more would have been greedy).Â  Plus, the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to switch around from the books left us all wonderingâ<U+0080>¦. Hey could Oberyn win this thing?
Â 
And he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t; it was fucking amazing.Â  
Â 
Sad clown faces for everyone!Â  
Â 
Oh, one more thingâ<U+0080>¦ he screamed like a girlâ<U+0080>¦. HA!Â  
Â 
Â 


Â 
So he wasn't any good? Â He thoroughly whipped one of the best warriors in the Seven Kingdoms. Â Oberyn died because he got too close to the strongest known man in the Seven Kingdoms as he lay dying due to wounds inflicted by Oberyn. Â So I really don't understand how Oberyn was not as good as he thought? Â Did you watch/read the same fight? Â The Mountain was pinned to the ground with Oberyn's spear through his chest.
Â 
He lost because he tried to elicit a confession implicating Tywin instead of just finishing off the Mountain or staying another foot away during his interrogation.Â
726	MoIaF	2014-06-02	Â 
  yes there will be and then its almost over. Â I can't believe finally Jorah is banished.Â 


Â 
I can't believe there are only two episodes left, this season has just flown by.
Â 
Yes, pretty soon Jorah will be meeting up with Tyrion, can't wait for that.
727	Carl Rhaego	2014-06-02	I wanted to love this episode, I tried. But I hated it.
Â 
Negatives:
Â 
- Jorah's banishment was yet another shitty, terribly rushed Meereen scene this season. Way too short and no build-up. Instead of all the filler this season they could have shown the kiss and some arguments between the two to build their conflict like in the books. The banishment was the culmination of a long growing tension between Dany and Jorah in the books. Dany was terribly hurt and crying. In the show, she's the usual cold hearted ice queen, no emotion, nothing. The scene fell completely flat. These two have been together from the first episode, it should have been a bigger, more emotional scene.
Â 
- Sansa's development is too quick. The disney witch dress made me lol. They should have given her a hat and a broom. Littlefinger's voice is laughably evil, he sounds like a demon with asthma.
Â 
- Yeah, we get it Wildlings are really one-dimensional and evil and kill innocent people. But Ygritte is not as evil as the others, I mean she likes babies! So please be emotional when she dies.
Â 
- Yay, another ten minute scene with Tyrion and Jaime talking in the cell. Why would we build-up the duel or do some other more important scene when we can have the tenth version of Tyrion in his cell.
Â 
- Women bath completely naked and flash their tits for the camera for a long while before covering themselves. Men bath with their pants on and keep their whole body underwater with only their head peaking out so they don't distract from the naked women. It is known.
Â 
- Duel was too short. Head crushing was cartoony as hell, I felt like watching The Walking Dead.
Â 
Â 
Positives:
Â 
- Missandei has an amazing body. As unnecessary as the scene was, that needs to be said.
Â 
- Alfie Allen is amazing. I just want to reach through the screen and hug him.
Â 
- Pedro Pascal was amazing, but sadly underused.
Â 
- Arya's laugh.

729	Clariana	2014-06-02	pretty sure her running to Cersei is not in the series


Â 
Uh, yes it was.
730	Mark Antony	2014-06-02	Â 
Uh, yes it was.
I really don't think it was in the show
731	Floke	2014-06-02	Â 
Uh, yes it was.


Â 
It wasn't. We see the Hound intercepting her ("who do you think sent me?") and then her in front of part of the Small Council, with Cersei telling her her father's a traitor and urging her to write a letter to Winterfell.
732	Haldebrandt	2014-06-02	Not bad, and while it WAS gorliy effective in terms of what was there, I'm slightly gob-smacked they left the much hyped trial by combat to the last rushed five minutes, much as per the bear pit scene in E08 last year.
Â 
Couldn't believe it when I looked at the clock, it was nearing the 50 min. mark and the fight had only just got going! Presumed that like the Purple wedding, it was pretty much locked to be a 15-20 minute segment at least? Weird.
Â 
Overall all, I love the show and the hard work that goes into it, so will be sticking with it in S5, but tbh, by this point in S4, they also seem to have replicated the massive problem of season 2 with their finale BIG time, i.e: left way too much for even a (marginally) extended final episode.
Â 
The certain upshot now, since E09 seems solely centred on the wall and the battle for castle black, is that one or more of the remaining plotlines WILL end up feeling rushed and short-changed in a 60 minute finale (and no, it won't be 66 at all after titles, credits and/or recap. More like 60 tops. Knowing that is sadly based on past experience.)
Â 
That's not really a statement of opinion; having followed this show from the beginning and watched how it either allocates too much time or subtracts too little time from scenes - ESPECAILLY when placed under pressure of the clock - it's more one based on mathematical fact.
Â 
The good news: I fully expect them to nail Tyrion's climactic scenes in 4x10, but at what cost? Whose story will end up becoming the new "what the hell just happened with Theon at Winterfell?" or Houses of Healing, condensed and truncated into baffling insignificance? Which massively powerful moment will come out Robbwind-disappointing in the wash?
Â 
Since they've clearly excised Arya's vision of Nymeria, this is arguably the episode that should at least have established some hanging Freys showing up with salt stuffed in their mouths in the Riverlands. They didn't so if LS DOES show, prepare yourself for cries of "jumping the shark!" & "Deus Ex Machina!" from non-readers because of that frustrating oversightÂ  - zero set up has been done.
Â 
Ideally this one would have been a longer 58-59 mins cut.
Â 
They needed to check in with Bran and co.
Â 
They needed to effect the Hound's demise, at least in part (much better set up here, admittedly) and get Arya in position ready from Braavos.
Â 
They needed to squeeze at least one iota of emotion from Kit Harrington who has been appalling this season where I've always defended his acting in the past.
Â 
Ditto Emilia Clarke, whose coldly imperious queen routine is wearing so thin now, it almost robbed another rushed (hugely rushed through) scene in the banishment of Jorah of any real sense of this being a two-way tragedy. So thank god for Ramin's score and Ian Glenn.
Â 
It's also worth bearing in mind that as good as it may be, The Watchers on The Wall is highly unlikely to surpass Blackwater in peoples' minds, especially since characters like Jon, Ygritte & Stannis are among the lesser favourites, performance-wise, compared to the Kings' Landing crowd. It can compete SFX-wise, but that's about it, most likely.
Â 
Which means that taken as a whole, so much is riding on the finale as to how S4 will be remembered: success or patchy failure?
Â 
Trashing things is not in my nature, so hope springs eternal and all that ... but my gut feeling by this point if I'm honest, no matter how hard I try to banish it, is that despite some standout scenes in individual episodes, time is running out to stop season 4 becoming the runt of the litter.
Â 
Prove me wrong, show. Prove me wrong. 
Â 
Â 
.


Thank you for expressing my feelings exactly. Â Pillars, stones, and beetles wasted at least 10 invaluable minutes.
733	johndance	2014-06-02	Â 
Â 
There was Sansa getting SweetRobin down the mountain with Myranda and Mya and then reuniting with Littlefinger, which advanced her metamorphasis from scared Sansa Stark to Littlefinger's Apprentice slowly and believably. Â While I though Sophie Turner did very well with the lines she was given, I found it harder to believe that in one or two days, Sansa goes from terrified, victimized (physically by Lysa, sexually by Littlefinger with that unsolicited kiss) girl to a cunning manipulator capable of selling 'lies and Arbor gold' to lords (and a lady) three times her age and surprising Littlefinger himself, not to mention the acknowledgment of Littlefinger's sexual interest in her. Â 


Â 
Â 
At first I was disappointed that a lot of this stuff would probably be left out but now thinking about it I see no reason why they couldn't still include it. All they really did was move up Sansa's little 'transformation' if you will to happen earlier in the plot. And I mean we all knew she was starting to learn the game anyway so it shouldn't come as that big of a shocker. I think Sophie is nailing it right now. Her acting was spot on from the lines to even the little mannerisms and smirks she gives to kind of emphasis that in her head she knows whats going on.
Â 
Not to mention we've seen scared, crying, depressed Sansa for the past 2 1/2 seasons. Nice to see her finally put it all together.
Â 
I've seen a few times people questioning how she goes from scarred, crying in front of Lysa to manipulator, player in the game almost overnight. The more I thought about this, it makes so much sense. LF tipped his hand when he kissed her. She knows he wants her now. Think back to season 2 the blackwater episode when Cersei is talking to Sansa during the sack. She tells Sansa "Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one is in between your legs"
For the past 2 seasons Sansa has been receiving these little 'lessons'. She's prepped and ready to pull off something like this. She sees an opportunity, knows how the game needs to be played, and pulls it off.Â 
Â 
I'm not worried about the show being caught up to 'book Sansa's story'. We just got some of it early and out of order. She has dark hair now, only the 3 people who were questioning her about Lysa's death know her real identity and because of her performance they promise not to tell anyone. She's Alayne Stone now. We can still see a lot of the stuff with 'Robin', Mya Stone, etc.Â
734	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	sorry haven't read the whole thread, keeps updating too fast....but did anyone else feel that the whole beetle crushing scene was just a build up to demonstrate Tyrion's obsessive personality...foreshadowing "where do whores go?"Â
735	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-02	It would have been good if it had a good outcome. Terrible terrible writing by D & D as usual.

If ever the show deviated from the books, this is when I wanted it to happen. Pedral Pascal nailed the role of Oberyn.
I can't even comment on the rest of the episode, or the other book deviations of the storylines.

748	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-06-02	I still have 5 more pages to read, but Tyrion laughing at his cousin didn't sit right with me. I thought he had an affinity for bastards, cripples and broken things?
749	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	Â 
Just so you know, when I saw all those mole town whore breasts last night in the worst brothel in the world...I thought of you. Â LOL.


Â 
It's not THE brothel, but luckily, they didn't try to fit everything in the episode.
Â 
I will admit, I was a little scared for Gilly and the baby for a second there.Â  For a split second, I was concerned considering all the posts about an extra death this season.Â
750	nara	2014-06-02	The pardon wasn't 3 years late nor from Robert Baratheon but was rather a cunning Tywin Lannister removing one of Dani's two seasoned Westerosi advisers by exposing his past transgressions. They talked about her a couple episodes back in a session of the small council and Tywin was informed that she has able advisors at her side. In classic Tywin fashion he sent a letter in a dead man's name that he knew would drive a wedge in her advisors and of course Poor Robert Baratheon will get the blame for the exposing of Norah while Tywin keeps his hand clean like he did with the red wedding by letting the hate fall mostly on the Frey's


I get that it was Tywin who sent it, but if I were him I'd wonder if Dany would ask, "Hmmm.Â  Why did this letter take so long to reach us? We were first with a Dothraki horde and then with several thousand Unsullied.Â  We would have been easy to find..."Â  Of course, Dany didn't stop to ask that question, but wouldn't be reasonable to assume that she'd be suspicious?
751	Fez	2014-06-02	So, was that Winterfell or the Dreadfort that the Boltons were coming up on at the end there? Because it looked an awful lot like Winterfell to me, and if that's the case I think its pretty much confirmation that the battle of ice will be next season. I can't see the Boltons and Theon just sitting there for over a season waiting for Stannis to show up.
752	Hound_Reborn	2014-06-02	Watched the episode, boy I was just quoting Monty Python & the Holy Grail with "Get on with it!", then again I always shout that at Daenerys' scenes, but damn, so much filler, an unnecessary part with a eunuch & a handmaiden (I don't know what her job role is exactly).
Â 
As far as the rest of the episode, eh, It seemed really patchy & uneven, obviously you had the Wildlings sacking yet another place, wasn't really bothered by that, you had the Sansa (kind of) becoming Alayne, which seemed a bit rushed, oh & I noticed the foreshadowing with what Littlefinger said about how people have died.
Â 
Arya & The Hound was enjoyable as always, but it seemed to be a blink & you'll miss it moment, the first scene with Tyrion seemed a bit odd & went nowhere & the final scene with The Viper & The Mountain, well, let's just say I'm still feeling a little sick, I mean it wasn't pleasant by all means in the book, in fact it's morbidly funny, like when an innocent bystander gets hacked by The Mountain, I just found it slightly funny, but no humour here. I felt it could've been a bit more subtle, like at the end of Sin City, where Bruce Willis punches that Yellow guy's face in & crushes his skull, yeah I don't ever want to watch this scene again, then again I'm probably becoming more wimpy as I'm getting older, but I just felt it took it a bit too far IMO, there doesn't seem to be any more subtlety anymore in films or TV shows.
Â 
Meh, In other words, I wasn't too much of a fan of this episode, too much filler.
Â 


Â 
So he wasn't any good? Â He thoroughly whipped one of the best warriors in the Seven Kingdoms. Â Oberyn died because he got too close to the strongest known man in the Seven Kingdoms as he lay dying due to wounds inflicted by Oberyn. Â So I really don't understand how Oberyn was not as good as he thought? Â Did you watch/read the same fight? Â The Mountain was pinned to the ground with Oberyn's spear through his chest.
Â 
He lost because he tried to elicit a confession implicating Tywin instead of just finishing off the Mountain or staying another foot away during his interrogation.Â 


Â 
Is that about the Mountain? Because I remember Jaime thinking in one of his chapters (at the Bear pit in Harrenhal) that the Bear had both more agility & more intelligence than Gregor ever did.
Â
753	Sneedy25	2014-06-02	Â 
Ser Gregor tried to rise. The broken spear had gone through him, and was pinning him to the ground. He wrapped both hands about the shaft, grunting , but could not pull it out. Beneath him was a spreading pool of red. "I am feeling more innocent by the instant", Tyrion told Ellaria Sand beside him.

Â 
Unfortunately, the writers forgot this awesome comment from Tyrion. 
I've waited for it the whole fight!
754	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	Watched the episode, boy I was just quoting Monty Python & the Holy Grail with "Get on with it!", then again I always shout that at Daenerys' scenes, but damn, so much filler, an unnecessary part with a eunuch & a handmaiden (I don't know what her job role is exactly).

That's one of my favorite observations of Jaime's.Â  He thinks something along the lines of It's Gregor Clegane with a pelt, probably smarter, too.Â  Something like that.Â

I get that its tv, with a limited shooting time, but how is it possible that a deleted fight scene between Orlando Bloom and Martin Cskokas in Kingdom of Heaven was both more emotionally resonant and dramatic than that.
Â 
I guess it had all the trademark of a mediocre GOT fight sequence. Poorly staged. Wild sword swings, Camera parked too far from the action. Poor use of dramatic beats to heighten the action. And don't forget the over the top gore ending.

So very disappointed - hated the beetle crushing part so much, did I miss something?? what was the point??Â  shouldn't Tyrion have some empathy for a special needs child who is his cousin?
Hated the Grey Worm deviation too, but I think the point was to get another scene withÂ breastsÂ in (hate the fact that HBO feels this necessary)
I feel like the book readers were spoiled by speeding up the Sansa story (I've been reading since the late '90's)

763	teej6	2014-06-02	For me the issue is less that they're deviating from the books, and more that I don't believe the writers are anywhere near competent enough to do ASOIAF justice with their fanfiction. Some of it turned out quite well, like Tywin encountering Arya, but most of it has been substandard garbage that's barely fit for a bad action movie or a daytime soap opera. I seriously worry for future seasons because it sounds like the fanfiction will only increase.

Perhaps the story was to show Orton Lannister is distilled to the essence of Lannister ness. All that time wasted that could have been spent on the fight. Or reading the books for ideas. 
The fight ending was at least straight from the book in a surprise turn.
We are again Alex Graves victims.
765	teej6	2014-06-02	Howland Reed was mentioned in the show. Im sure they will add the crannogmen in some fashion. Probably mentioning them when Asha arrives there or something. I dont expect them to go to Crannog Country until next season.
Â 
Well..they are. Sorry. But they are. And complaining about it is making them look stupider.Â 
Again, most people get the point of the beetle story but that still doesn't change the fact that it was a tad too long and tedious to sit through

Beetle speech was a metaphor for the Gods undiscriminately killing people because they can. That there is no order to the killing, there is just killing. Also that we'll never understand the intentions or order the Gods see fit for a person to die.
Â 
I quite enjoyed the beetle monologue. It was just too long, especially when most people would've preferred more tyrion/oberyn time or more fighting time. I don't think Tyrion hated his cousin, as he said, making fun of him made him feel normal it was just an attempt to inject humour into the scene.
Â 
I actually really like the grey worm/ missandei romance that is developing. but again they spent too much time on it!
768	David Selig	2014-06-02	Again, most people get the point of the beetle story but that still doesn't change the fact that it was a tad too long and tedious to sit through


Quite the understatement. It felt like it went on for half an hour.
769	Rockroi	2014-06-02	So he wasn't any good? Â He thoroughly whipped one of the best warriors in the Seven Kingdoms. Â Oberyn died because he got too close to the strongest known man in the Seven Kingdoms as he lay dying due to wounds inflicted by Oberyn. Â So I really don't understand how Oberyn was not as good as he thought? Â Did you watch/read the same fight? Â The Mountain was pinned to the ground with Oberyn's spear through his chest.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
First of all, I never said Oberyn wasn't any good; I said he was overrated as a fighter and did not do that much to actually earn his reputation. Â Tyrion asks Jaime and Jaime says what we have all said- we never saw the man fight. Â 
Â 
Second, he did not "thoroughly whip" one of the best warriors in Westeroes; the Mountain beat him. Â ITs like the story of two boxers, where Boxer A puts on a dazzling performance for 11.5 rounds, just beating up Boxer B, just doing everything perfectly, then with 1 min left in the fight, Boxer B squares up and hits Boxer A with a 1-2 combo that flattens Boxer A, KO'ing him. Â So... who won the fight? Â Yeah, Boxer A could say, "Look, I dominated the fight; I won every round" to which the appropriate and correct response is, "No- you won 11 rounds; the fight goes 12 you have to stay upright for all 12. Â You lost the fight." Â Â 
Â 
Oberyn lost. Â I know the fan-boys want to resurrect him by way of claiming that he won the fight or that the Mountain will die of his wounds in a few days... weeks... whatever. Â But the cold, hard brutal truth is that Oberyn Martell lost. He failed to do what he set out to do which was put Elia's death on the LANNISTERS. Â He was also supposed to kill the Mountain, but did not. Â He reached too far, - as the book puts it, he dropped the ball because Viper's don't have hands. Â HE achieved zero of his goals. Â (If you think that the Mountain's "confession?" is meaningful, you are mistaken- we knew already that Elia of Dorne did not die of natural causes; much like Aerys, somebody had to kill her). Â 
Â 
Oh, and to answer your other,. cliche questions- yes we watched the exact same fight, on the exact same medium, with the same actors, at the same frame-rate in the same presentation brought to you by the same network over the same cable connections. Â 
Â 
Yes, the Mountain was on the ground, the spear in his chest, etc etc etc ... and Oberyn still lost... to a man pinned to the ground with a spear in his chest. Â 
Â 
Wow... when you say it like that it makes Oberyn sound even more incompetent. Â Fuck... how do you lose to a man who is on his back, bleeding with a spear in his body? Â Well... Oberyn found a way. Â 
Â 
He lost because he tried to elicit a confession implicating Tywin instead of just finishing off the Mountain or staying another foot away during his interrogation.Â 
Â 

Â 
I fixed that for you.
Â 
Look, let me put all my snarkiness aside. Â I never liked Oberyn (but you knew that already). Â He was a fine character and a very good fighter. I never said otherwise. Â But his arrogance got the best of him. Instead of being satisfied with what he had, he overreached and it cost him his life. Â Granted, in the book, he was actually in the act of trying to kill the Mountain when the Mountain killed him and here he was extending the confession, but in both instances the end is clear- the fight was not over. Â 
Â 
IN a way, the fight ended very true to Oberyn, who was always a bit too cock-sure of himself; a bit arrogant. Â And it cost him.
Â 
Simple as that. Â

770	Mickys	2014-06-02	So, now that people know Arya is still alive, what happens.
Â 
Does the Hound leave the Vale now? Does he bring Arya with him?


i didn't understand this scene tbh, why Arya didn't ask for the Arryn protection?? Robert is her cousin after all and it's the only place where she can hide. the Hound would get paid and both of them would have met Sansa. and why in the hell the Knight did not take them into custody? isn't like they are enemy of the crown... weird
771	cxvb	2014-06-02	Â 
Unfortunately, the writers forgot this awesome comment from Tyrion. 
I've waited for it the whole fight!


We got
Oberyn: "Size doesn't matter, when you're flat on your back"
Tyrion "Thank the gods."
Â 
double entendre?
772	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	I usually don't post, but I really enjoy the discussions here and check in to readÂ the comments and theories often.Â  Last night's episode bothered me so much that I had to look up my log in info. just so I could vent.
So very disappointed - hated the beetle crushing part so much, did I miss something?? what was the point??Â  shouldn't Tyrion have some empathy for a special needs child who is his cousin?
Hated the Grey Worm deviation too, but I think the point was to get another scene withÂ breastsÂ in (hate the fact that HBO feels this necessary)
I feel like the book readers were spoiled by speeding up the Sansa story (I've been reading since the late '90's)


Â 
I noticed someone already replying to you, it was a good answer...
Â 
when i watched the episode, i didnt get that part, what i got was the show setting the stage for Tyrion's obsessive behavior "where do whores go?"....nothing else in the show so far would have explained as nicely about why he keeps repeating that...ofcourse he loved Tysha and ofcourse he sort of had a breakdown after discovering the truth and it makes absolute sense that he would go searching for her...but the way he keeps repeating it in the books, almost like a mantra...
Â 
this scene to me shows how he's always had an obsessive personality, where he feels he is smarter than most and if he doesn't know the answer to something it drives him crazy and he keeps obsessing until he gets the answer...
Â 
also the fact that he really had no idea how Oberyn would do in the fight, it was possibly his last conversation...and he chose to bring up this of all topics, asking Jaime at the very end for an answer to that question, before possibly going off to his depth...see to me that just shows that even something so insignificant as beetle crushing, its still important for him to know the answer before he dies....
Â 
so when it comes to "where do whores go", with all the added emotions, he's not going to rest till he knows...
Â 
that was just my take on the importance of that scene...Â 
Â
773	Mos	2014-06-02	Well..they are. Sorry. But they are. And complaining about it is making them look stupider.Â 


Â 
Â 
Â 
Lol, take it easy why don't you.
Â 
I wasn't THAT impressed by the beetle monologue. I understand why they did it, but don't really buy it. Subtext and all, it didn't fit where it was placed and I can't see how it is be important either. Plus... it wasn't that well written either. I think Peter Dinklage more or less saved it with his performance.Â 
Â 
I think they could have cut it and placed another scene there instead. Like maybe the fight between The Hound and the knights of the Gate. It would make much more sense to place it there instead of early in episode 10.
774	Lord Martin	2014-06-02	I love the double meanings of some episode titles. Â "The Mountain and the Viper" is facially a reference to Oberyn and Gregor Clegane. Â But a second mountain looms large in this episode, the Eyrie. Â The only question is, who is the viper, Sansa or Little Finger? Â 
Â 
I thought this was one of the elite episodes, I even liked the bit with the beetles. Â
775	Girlicious	2014-06-02	But his arrogance got the best of him. Instead of being satisfied with what he had, he overreached and it cost him his life.
Â 
I disagree with that.
Oberyn is kind of arrogant, self-confident for sure, but the reason why he dragged the fight on is because he wanted a confession out of Gregor, he wanted to confront Tywin about the order he (most likely) gave Gregor.
He got careless, I would give you that, but not arrogent.
776	The Amethyst Empress	2014-06-02	The duel was EPIC...Head-smush!!!
I'll miss Oberyn,he was a true badass 
Â 
The whole Eyrie thing,meh I don't like it when they change things but I don't really care 
I suppose since Sansa dyed her hair they will keep calling her Alayne and only 5 people will know she's Sansa
Â 
Alfie Allen was great once again,he's an amazing Reek
Â 
Arya was like "Hahahahahahahaha my whole fucking family is dead that's hilarious"
777	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-02	What do we say to death? Not todaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!!
Â 
Yeah they could have put some makeup on Gregor to make him look a bit crazier, and his face more weathered. Selling the wounds and fatigue as he got on top of Oberyn would have made it perfect. It's not like he didn't have time to trudge around because he knocked Oberyn silly with that punch. Ka-kun ka-kun ka-kun.

778	MoIaF	2014-06-02	Beetle speech was a metaphor for the Gods undiscriminately killing people because they can. That there is no order to the killing, there is just killing. Also that we'll never understand the intentions or order the Gods see fit for a person to die.
Â 
I quite enjoyed the beetle monologue. It was just too long, especially when most people would've preferred more tyrion/oberyn time or more fighting time. I don't think Tyrion hated his cousin, as he said, making fun of him made him feel normal it was just an attempt to inject humour into the scene.
Â 
I actually really like the grey worm/ missandei romance that is developing. but again they spent too much time on it!


Â 
That's a good interpretation for the beetle scene. While I was watching it I kept on thinking it was a metaphor for power and control or the lack there of. O (the cousin, I can't remember his name) only had power over those beetles, so he destroyed because he could and because it was probably one of the few things he had control over (even if he couldn't intellectualize it).
779	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-06-02	There's only one real way to respond to Oberyn's head exploding.
780	teej6	2014-06-02	Quite the understatement. It felt like it went on for half an hour.
Yeah, I thought it would never end.

Cousin is Olson i believe. Yeh i agree with your assessment as well. At first i thought it was a metaphor for tywin, but it had a deeper meaning. Represents the chaos of life. I also liked the fact that tyrion tried to understand it. Theres that famous saying, "it's like an ant trying to understand the inner workings of the human brain" (can't remember exact quote). it also reminded me of that hemingway book, A Farewll to Arms, the quote about burning ants.Â
786	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-02	Yeah, I thought it would never end.


yeah it was one of the rare scenes where I was like "hurry up"
787	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	I liked the Sansa changes and think they may mirror what happens in the book, possibly. Revealing herself is still the ace she has left though it will play out differently with other characters there. LF looked really dangerous when he asked Sansa if she thought she knew him, and that reminded us that frankly we have no idea what he really plans. There's no way he's been square with Sansa or anyone he's revealed his motivations to in the book or the show. The Arya reveal will lead to nothing. Could have done with longer wall scene. Liked Dany, didn't mind the Grey Worm stuff. Jaime and Tyrion is always good, but I too would rather have Dorne and the Martell kids and Myrcella mentioned. Liked the trial, comments about promising not to die aside, Oberyn really looked like he was going to win and the Mountain was good. We are going off the book plot and I can see big differences in the next season but I also think the overall ending will change so I'm not too fussed. The things they are missing I'm guessing they will try and shove into next season which will be clumsy but is their MO. Some plot holes they've made for themselves but the acting rescues this and the odd sequential order of the episode, because everyone smashed their roles out of the park this week and the new stuff  is hit and miss but entertaining at least. I was really happy with Sophie, Gillen, Pedro and Alfie in particular
788	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-02	One of the best things about this episode is I don't have to read all the moronic theories anymore about how Bronn will replace Oberyn and how Oberyn will actually live.

789	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	The beetle talk was about many things but largely I think asking Jaime's question- why is the world so full of injustice? Why do the gods harm the innocent? And why me (Tyrion), why am I getting so fucked over?!

Â 
I don't think so. They could not say enough about him being a man whore who goes both ways but I can't recall him being a notable poisoner. I also found it weird he used two spears. I guess he could have poisoned both but that sort of bothered me.
801	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	Tywin mentioned he studied poisons in brothel scene

And as Tyrion notes, he must have gotten the name Red Viper from somewhere 
You can see them wipe oil over his spear before the fight. No way that's oil

He used 2 spears? Thought he just used the end of the one that got broken...
His time learning poisons in teh citadel is mentioned by Tywin who asks if he was advising Tyrion on how to poison the King
804	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	I meant Tywin 


Â 
I know, I meant that because they're going to definitely establish him as having poisoned The Mountain, it won't be difficult to extrapolate that to another target (Tywin). But it could be something cut, sadly. E10 is already going to be packed.
805	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-06-02	Honestly, did we need to hear 3 mins of that beetle story. And why the Missandei/Greyworm subplot? Is there a purpose to that?Â 


I took the beetle story as Tyrion basically coming to a realization that no matter how clever he is, there are somethings that you just won't figure out/talk your way out of/think your way out of. He sounded resigned to his fate. He spoke of spending inordinate amounts of time watching, studying, following,questioning Orson, but never knew why? It consumed him and he even says (paraphrase) someone as smart as me should be able to figure out the machinations of a halfwit(unparaphrase). At the end of the story, he doesn't know anymore than he did before his obsession....but he's ok with that. Maybe he was starting to be OK with his fate.
Â 
(spoiler?)The Grey Worm Missandei stuff is easier to jibe with than random scenes featuring unknown unsullied creeping into P houses for whatever it is they crave. We just got a scene of one of Dany's closest counselors being exiled for betrayal. Unsullied would lose their shit if we got random cutaway scenes with unsullied soldiers going off to meet unknown people in unknown places. This way you're kinda sympathizing with two well liked characters and their affection for each other. They even have Dany put the breaks on it asking about what partsÂ  he has....just to get you thinking about the "how/why" of Grey Worm's attraction. IÂ  really liked the interaction b/w GW and M. GW being thankful he was cut, b/c if not he ultimately never would have met M had my wife and her homegirls getting misty.

No I think they will drop that story, which is a shame as it could easily have been dropped in before the duel as a poison hint and a "this guy is dangerous" hint and it provides a backdrop to Quentyn's fostering. But I imagine that is dropped
810	ChrisSnow77	2014-06-02	I took Tyrion's reference to his beetle crushing cousin as being more about Tywin than about the Mountain.Â  No matter how he tries to reason with his father he is still going to get crushed.

I thought it was a nice poison (a big theme this week, overt and hidden) hint for Tywin- Arryn died in his bed (from poison). Joff dies at his table (from poison) and Tywin is gonna die at his chamber pot...
812	Howlin' Howland	2014-06-02	No mention of Euron or Victarion.

I know people (a lot of women) love the brothel scenes, but it would have taken a minute to tell that story and set the character up as dangerous, notable poisoner better than Tywin talking about how he studied poisons. It also explains the name "The Red Viper".Â

That's exactly what I got. There are no discernible reasons that people die when and how they die. As i mentioned in another thread, if one were to stand in Hades, they'd see dead people as far as they eye could reach.

I can usually take gore, somewhat, it's more so the outcome of the duel that has me not quite ready to watch it again, yet.Â  On the gore point, I think it is good to leave some to the imagination.Â  The SOUND the teeth made dropping was horrifying, but by the end of the scene, after the eye gauging....I think it started to become a bit unrealistic.Â  Still, the effects were better than some of the previous seasons with the hacking people in half stuff.Â  I think a good mixture of gore and imagination is best.Â  Still, it's moreso the losing of Oberyn that I'm not ready to face, again.Â  I'm still in awe how much Pedro Pascal's Oberyn has only multiplied my affection.

More Jaime killing one cousin already, and threatening Lancel soon, I'd say
824	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	More Jaime killing one cousin already, and threatening Lancel soon, I'd say


Â 
That's what I was guessing. I was hoping they'd bring up "deicide" to set up Cersei killing to current High Septon (we know High Sparrow is coming), but there's still time for that.
825	TheButcherCrow	2014-06-02	Beetle speech was a metaphor for the Gods undiscriminately killing people because they can. That there is no order to the killing, there is just killing. Also that we'll never understand the intentions or order the Gods see fit for a person to die.
Â 
I quite enjoyed the beetle monologue. It was just too long, especially when most people would've preferred more tyrion/oberyn time or more fighting time. I don't think Tyrion hated his cousin, as he said, making fun of him made him feel normal it was just an attempt to inject humour into the scene.
Â 
I actually really like the grey worm/ missandei romance that is developing. but again they spent too much time on it!


Â 
Â 


That's exactly what I got. There are no discernible reasons that people die when and how they die. As i mentioned in another thread, if one were to stand in Hades, they'd see dead people as far as they eye could reach.
Â 
A condemnded man is pondering the meaning of life and death.


Â 
That and it speaks to the futility of attempting to discern reason within the chaotic. Â People die and there is no reason for it and you can waste your life searching for one.

  Â You have put it eloquently. Thats exactly what it meant. Tyrion spent time trying to figure out why Olson was smashing beetles- there was no reason, he was just intellectually disabled.
827	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-02	I personally loved the beetle scene - beautifully drawn, multilayered and suspenseful. 
As for LFs foreshadowing I assumed:
* die at dinner - maybe LS killing Freys? 
* die in bed - must be a certain whore in a certain Hand's bed
* die crouched over their chamber pot - well this one goes without saying
828	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	Really annoyingly I thought the cast and director  and writers really got the characters this week, which worked so well, but then watching the inside the episode with D and D has pissed me off because their reading of every character and situation is way off what I think is right. Obviously I am probably more likely to be wrong but it really rankles especially as the performances and writing fit with what I feel teh characters are feeling
829	Wilhite	2014-06-02	Â 
He sure did. I'm thinking that would have been something of a nightmare, logistically, though. It always sort of confused me in the books too--how's he pull Oberyn on top of him with that spear in the way?


In the books, if i remember correctly, he pulls out the spear and is going to finish the mountain with his own sword.
830	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-02	In the books, if i remember correctly, he pulls out the spear and is going to finish the mountain with his own sword.


I always thought Â he was pinned to the ground, but i just saw the comic adaption and he is about to kill The Mountain with a sword.
831	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-02	Because it bored the viewers to tears.


Â 
You found his analogy boring and yet you have a Vermeer painting as your avatar
832	Gustavo	2014-06-02	"People die squatting over their chamber pots" though..
833	piles	2014-06-02	Hu!
What are you referring to? There was absolutely not crazy evil there.


Â 
Maybe it's just her delivery, I just think she seems a little unhinged-to-the-point-of-blindness at times. Couldn't help but think of the Mad King during that scene. I'll be re-watching tonight so I'll elaborate more later.
Â 
I'm not a Dany hater by the way... Just an observation.
834	Jameson Snow	2014-06-02	Â Thought the duel was great. I was more emotionally effected by it than the Red Wedding for some reason. I guess because Oberyn just exudes confidence and then to have him scream so helplessly as his eyes were pushed in was such a 180.Â 
Â 
Â Only thing I hated was the explosion of his head. It made the whole thing a bit comical in my opinion. I'm not super educated in physics, but does that even make sense scientifically? No matter how strong the Mountain was, would Oberyn's head fuckin blow up like that? Would have been much more chilling I think to just have his skull crack and be left all disfigured. I guess that probably would have been a lot tougher on the makeup department than just the pile of brain stew that they ended up leaving where his head was.
835	ARYa_Nym	2014-06-02	The poison line might be getting readers ready for the FM arc considering the FM we've seen so far mainly kill with poison. Just so the readers know that she's not opposed to killing with other methods and to get ready for her to use different ones.
836	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	Â 
I can usually take gore, somewhat, it's more so the outcome of the duel that has me not quite ready to watch it again, yet.Â  On the gore point, I think it is good to leave some to the imagination.Â  The SOUND the teeth made dropping was horrifying, but by the end of the scene, after the eye gauging....I think it started to become a bit unrealistic.Â  Still, the effects were better than some of the previous seasons with the hacking people in half stuff.Â  I think a good mixture of gore and imagination is best.Â  Still, it's moreso the losing of Oberyn that I'm not ready to face, again.Â  I'm still in awe how much Pedro Pascal's Oberyn has only multiplied my affection.
Â 


Â 
I was soooo glad they did it like the books and not "being chopped in half" as soooo many seemed soooooooooo sure off....or like all the people who were predicting that Oberyn would live....that i didnt even mind the gore because i was jumping up and down clapping and cheering....
Â 
only when it got to the end credits did i actually realize that shit....No more Predo PascalÂ

Â 
I thought it was fantastic, I was really happy they kept Oberyn's dialogue during the fight, it added such power to the scene in the book. Everyone's reactions and expressions throughout were great, especially poor Ellaria at the end. But yeah, I did wonder about the head exploding too. I'm just not sure that's what would actually happen. I like the idea of it cracking, makes more sense and they could've incorporated a horrible sound to go with it. I guess they wanted to add one last "wow" at the end there by having it explode... Everything else, I loved.
840	Lord Jennings	2014-06-02	Knew the end game but was not ready for the gruesomeness at the end. Damn. Going to be interesting to see the Hound and Aryas arch play out.

I think that it would have a higher chance of exploding if you did it the way The Mountain did, he squeezed his head like a big pimple.Â

Â 
  I think we watched to different episodes.
Â 
I think what she was displaying was restraint fury, which is completely understandable given the circumstances. She's a queen now and she can't afford to act unrestrained (yelling and cursing) she kept her composure as best she could but it was still an incredibly devastating moment for her. The only friend she's ever really know betrayed her in the worst possible way, it's a miracle she was able to keep her composure.

apologies, thought you meant after. Â Either those were Ironborn killed taking the castle or they were Bolton men killed trying to take the castle, most likely both.
Â 
Â 



Would someone be able to explain the point and moral of Tyrion's beetle story?

Â 
So many things. Â Mostly I think Tyrion was wondering why his father & sister wanted to crush him like Orson did those beetles, seemingly for no reason.

860	dbunting	2014-06-02	Really enjoyed this episode, and really pretty much the entire season. For me this has been the best season so far and there are still some huge scenes waiting to happen. Loved seeing Sansa come into her own and start to take control of her situation, to me this was what we will see from her in TWOW.The Arya scene and her laughter to me was pretty accurate. She was basically cracking because everytime she thinks she is going to be ok something else happens. So for her to lose it seemed appropriate, now she can move on to the FM because she thinks everyone is dead except Jon.

The show doesn't have to follow the book to the letter you know. Otherwise we can just go read the books again.
Missandei x GW might be an interesting thing to see and give more insight about Unsullied / Ghiscari stuff.
If we want to criticize the things D&D added out of their pocket, I'd rather go for the awful mess they did at the Wall this season. Or for the whole Yara saving Theon plotline.
862	sati	2014-06-02	Would someone be able to explain the point and moral of Tyrion's beetle story?

Â 
1) Tyrion isn't always nice; he made fun of a simpleton to fit in.
2) Tyrion can be overly obsessive.
3) Its an analogy, the gods are cruel and there's no meaning to when people die.
4) Its an analogy, GRRM is cruel andÂ capriciously kills his characters.
5) its an analogy as above, but note that Tyrion doesn't kill the bug he picks up. Sometimes bugs (people) live, even if you don't expect it; foreshadowing his escape.
6) It shows how overwhelmed Tyrion and Jaime are by the current circumstances; talking about nonsense at 5am.
7) Its another reminder of how close Tyrion and Jaime are, and that Jaime is spending an awful lot of time in that cell; helping setup that Jaime will set him free.
Â

I don't mind the storyline, as long as it doesn't really take up too much time.Â
869	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	I think the beetle scene is one that will be kinder on re-watch, though the teasing of the mentally handicapped wasn't in the best taste. It's about the futility of man and Tyrion's attempt to find meaning in this situation, which he can't. But it was long, politically incorrect, and we were all so antsy to get to the fight that it was probably not the best time for a completely off-script monologue.
Â 
Kind of goes against Tyrion's love for cripples, bastards, and broken things though.

Â 
see...when they added scenes for Tywin and Arya i wasnt happy at first cuz of your exact point....but it turned out okay...since then i've tried to keep a more open mind to additional stories/plots...but Grey Worm and Messandi...they are both soooo minor characters, time devoted to them just rubs me the wrong way...
Â 
something that took me a loooong time to get over was the missing scenes from the House of the Undying...i still haven't completely...but if something so amazing had to be cut, it annoys me to see these now...i'd rather have some flash backs or some added stuff with important charactersÂ 
Â 
what was it Lady Olenna said...what happens when the decrepit bumps against the non-existent...are they trying to answer that question? not implying messandi is decrepit though in any wayÂ
871	TeamLannister	2014-06-02	References to the past and future in this episode include:
Â 
"People die at their dinner tables. TheyÂ dieÂ inÂ their beds. TheyÂ dieÂ squatting overÂ their chamber pots."- Littlefinger.Â 
Dinner table represents both the RW and the purple wedding. Beds refers to both Jon Arryn and Shae's death. And the last is obviously a reference to Tywin's demise.Â 
Â 
"It's just a flea bite"-The Mountain. The same thing was said by Khal Drogo
Â 
"You learned this during your years in the fighting pits?"-Oberyn to Tyrion. Tyrion is in the fighting pits performing a mock joust with Penny in ADWD.Â 
Â
872	Rhaegar Targaryen's Ghost	2014-06-02	One thing I never understood in the books, theoretically they both died. So I guess the tie goes to the accuser?


Oberyn died first. During the trial.Â

Â 
Doesn't really have anything to do with their writing...if you think someone cant grow up (kids are nasty little shits to other kids...Tyrion laughing at him probably made him feel normal as an awkward child) and realize they were wrong...yet still be flawed enough to have a laugh about being a little shit...during the most uncomfortable moment in their life...

I don't think they know yet. They said that the Ironborn were leaving the North in droves. My guess is that Balon is dead, only the Ironborn captains know about it right now, and we'll all find out later. Balon death won't be onscreen.

Great analysis of the scene.Â  Thanks!Â  I like the very subtle way they are setting up Tyrion's escape.Â  I also think that unsullied will view it as Tyrion's final "good-bye" scene.Â

Â 
I am a bit concerned about that myself. Everyone seemed excited for Blackwater, but it certainly seems like most reviewers at least (I don't know many unsullied) either don't like, or at best don't care, about the Wall. And if people aren't invested, then it just becomes a technically proficient battle scene; incredibly impressive by TV standards, but only reasonably so compared to what we see in movies all the time.

886	rmholt	2014-06-02	Â 
For sure Robb's men. The Moat was taken by him in his march to Riverrun
They were Victarion's men. They were Ironborn...even in the show. Why Theon was sent.  Robb didn't have to take Moat Cailin - it was an ally. He left it anyway, early on.
The dead men were killed in the takeover by Ironborn - so Reed or Ironborn men - or shot by Reed men.  Robb was never in a battle there.

890	ohpooratlas	2014-06-02	I'm equally concerned that they haven't given a proper build up for the battle at the wall. I don't think it's a proper build up as a book reader. I'm not nearly as excited for it as I would like to be.

As for the last episode, this is the way I see the events taking place:
Â 
1. Jamie rescues Tyrion, delivers him to Varys.
2. Bran and co. are ambushed right in front of the tree
3. Tyrion and the "thrumb" ... maybe followed by Varys' send off.
4. Bran meets Bloodraven
5. Lady Stoneheart
Â 
If LS is included, that will be one jam packed episode and that doesn't even include Arya's send off to Bravos, any of the other fallout in King's Landing (would be nice to get a shout out to Dorne "someone has to send word to Oberyn's brother) ... anything we may get with Sansa and Littlefinger ... anything with the Boltons ... and the obviously fallout from the battle at the Wall.
891	xanman	2014-06-02	So was that Winterfell the Boltons were marching to? Would be epic if we see them at Winterfell in this season's finale.

893	rmholt	2014-06-02	There were 3 Vale lords grilling LF - then one vanished. Even CC didn't cite the speaker of his one line. Since Corbray was mentioned I presume he was one of them?
894	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	Do we know they are really going to do a Blackwater type All Wall episode next week?
Â 
They have A LOT of plot they need to get through, and they've shorted the Wall all along, it seems kind of unlikely they would spend a whole episode on a battle that doesn't have much ramifcations for the audience.
895	Ilikeitugly	2014-06-02	Did anyone notice how bad Emilia Clarke was in that "f*** off Jorah" scene? Cringe worthy...Dead eyes...Overacting with the voice but nothing was going on in her face...Im starting to think casting her was a huge mistake. They might have done it cause she looks so young while being already somewhat experienced as an actress...but look at Maisie...I mean....
896	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-02	That brutal KO really felt like I was watching a snuff film of a living, breathing person. I was trying to put my finger on it.
Â 


We're going to wait a long time to find put what happens to Tyrion. My $0.25 is the last moment of the season is a "thrum"


Â 
I'm hoping to see an epic walk off into the darkness, with the Rains playing. It would be confusing if he's not seen escaping.

Personally, I'm dreading that whole episode considering they've even ruined the "Stannis!" surprise at the end, which is the best part of that battle, in my opinion

Â 
Weird. Â Well, since the episodes are getting shorter and shorter, maybe it will only be like 45 minutes. Â I guess they can give Ygritte a very long death scene. Â But what else? Â 
Â 
I would like it if they had the battle won early, like 2/3 of the way through then, and then left a fair amount of time for Stannis to be at the Wall taking over, etc.....but they like surprises so seems more likely they will have him show up at the last minute...

Agreed. If the Dance of the Dragons 2.0 ever happens, and if it is Dany/Tyrion vs Aegon/Sansa (as I think it could be) then I know for sure who I'll be rooting for

Am I the only who for a little while, thought they were going to let oberyn live ? 
And weirdly enough, tyrion / ellaria / jamie are the only one who seem shocked. 
I liked the missendei / gray worm scenes. 
And poor jorah. 
Arya cracking down, unexpected, but fitted.

915	yushkevitch	2014-06-02	So does Missandei + Grey Worm (either as reunited family - likely - or lovers - less likely) mean the Unsullied won't be joining Dany in her eventual trip to Westeros?Â 
Â 
I'd argue her reunion with the Dothraki means Dany is about to leave everything and (almost) everyone behind in Meereen. As the leader of the Unsullied, if Grey Worm is convinced by Missandei to return to his original home the other Unsullied may do the same .. and therefore wraps up those characters' stories nicely while trimming the herd so to speak for Dany's journey across the Narrow Sea.
916	Gargarax	2014-06-02	After nobody had mentioned it until page 26, I lost my patience and decided to write it down, no matter if it's been said since:
Â 
The beetle scene begins with Tyrion thinking about the absurdity of trials by combats, telling Jaime that this practice is saying so much about gods. What he realises here is what Arya realises before she begins to laugh - if there are gods in the world they live in, they must be cruel or mad. Arya and Tyrion develop two kinds of nihilistic reactions to the world in the first three books: Arya worships death which alone offers some sort of meaning or purpose, Tyrion is drowing himself in wine, unable to cope with his epiphany in any other way. The beetle scene was phenomenal, it was much, much more than a meta joke on GRRM killing characters or a way to foreshadow the Viper's or the Mountain's fate. It gave us a glimpse of Tyrion going dark, just as Sansa and Arya became a few shades darker in the episode. Give D&D some credit for their writing, it's a lot more clever and thought through than many posters here seem to realise.

Â 
Well I got as much from it as anybody...The cousin squashing the beetles is a parallel to God's destroying human beings for no apparent reason and Tyrion's dismay for this fact. "There must be some reason"- he looks and looks, reads books, asks Maesters but finds no answer cause there is none to be found. Clever writing but a scene somehow misplaced...I was already looking so much forward to the fight scene I didn't pay much attention.

Hm ... explain or stop wasting forum space ...


Â 
Forum space is not a problem, but ok, I'll elaborate:
Â 
The scene was overlong, tedious, slightly offensive, clumsy, and overall, innecessary.
Â 
The imagery and metaphor was basic and pedestrian to say the least. It's meaning (if we would call it so) was painfully obvious and predictable. I'm honestly baffled at all these interpretations. It was just nihilism at its most basic: things happen for no reason, just because. Orson crushed the beetles because he could, just like the mule kicked him because it could.
Â 
Done, it was paper-thin dialogue. It was all flash and no substance. And worse of all: it was repetitive. We've seen time and time again how violence and death happens just because on this show. That's Ramsay's "If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention", there's even Tyrion's "if you're looking for justice, you've come to the wrong place". Etc, etc, but of course, D&D had to belabor the point because the audience is stupid
Â 
Well, at least I hope the stupid story was about the pointlessness of it all. If it really was a metaphor of Gregor and Oberyn then I just feel sorry for these writers
932	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-02	I thought Emilia did good with the Jorah exile scene- you could see her hurt and anger, yet with allot of effort sheÂ managed to keepÂ herself composed.
Â 
What I did not like was the camera up her damn nose. The close ups were too close.

Â 
What is there not to get? Â It's not that deep--the fates are mercurial, life and death are random, no one knows why anyone does anything and never will, the universe is chaos, etc. etc.
Â 
It went on for much too long, the dialogue in places was awkward and rambling.
934	wallofice	2014-06-02	I haven't gone through the whole thread yet, but I saw a lot of hate or disinterest re: the Grey Worm/Missandei story line. So I just wanted to give it some love. I was actually concerned that aging Missandei up would mean she replaced Irri in the "Dany is sexually frustrated" plotline, which I was not looking forward to at all. Instead, they've given her and Grey Worm a sweet - though I guess it's bitter as well - and tentative romance that helps remind me that there's still moments of goodness to be have in the midst of the unrelenting tragedy. I know they're barely supporting characters and it might feel like a waste of time, but it's also such a rare thing to actually get the stories of the downtrodden on this show. The Game of Thrones isn't just about the highborns and their power struggles - everything they do affects the commoners. Of course, Missandei and Grey Worm's lives have been much more difficult than your average ASOIAF lowborns, as they've been slaves very nearly from birth. So to watch that they do with their newfound freedom and how they relate to the world that Dany is trying to build is really refreshing to me.
Â 
As for Sansa, well, I'm still of two minds about it. I'm happy to see her taking charge, and I'm thrilled that D&D definitely grasped how she's putting together all the lessons she's learned over her years of captivity. I'm mostly just concerned that they'll push too far with Sansa/Petyr - which is definitely not something I want to see - and also that they'll forgo Sansa's core of human decency in favor of flashy game-playing tactics. Not to mention that I was hoping that Alayne "revealing" herself to be Sansa in the books would be accompanied by Littlefinger's downfall, so now I'll have to wait for another course of action. I do love how she one-upped him, though. She could have him eating out of her hand and he knows it.

Thanks! I don't agree at all with the first bit, but yes, it was repetitive and it was a metaphor for something the show has already made a point of at least twice. I'm sure though it was not a metaphor for Gregor and Oberyn, as I said. It was important that is was a long story with no explanation in the end - because that was what the story was about. It was painful because it happened just before the fight, not argueing that at all. I'm fine with people not liking it, I just think it's silly to call it bad writing, which it really isn't.
937	Fjordgazer	2014-06-02	About Emilia's acting, IMO it was fine. Not "knock-it-off-the-park" good, but effective nonetheless. I pictured this scene with her crying, but in retrospect, i'm fine with the way it played.

Â 
If that speech was in a book, people would be analysing it for the symbolism, potential foreshadowing, or even just for a hint of the author's own ideals and thoughts. But it's on a screen, thus it can never be as intelligent or well thought out, instead it was just getting in the way of the awesome visual spectacle of the upcoming fight. It was a terrific scene and deserves plaudits both for the writing, but also the acting.

Â 
Well, you know, it's cool that you liked it and all, but for me it really was bad writing. It showed aspects that, to me, are characteristic of bad writing:
Â 
1) A sign of bad writing is when the writer unambiguously asks the reader, "what's the meaning of this? Guess it, guess it!". If it is a good symbol, allegory, metaphor or whatever then the reader should try to figure out its meaning on his own, not because the writing is brazenly pointing to it
Â 
2) A metaphor or allegory of this kind should come naturally. It should have a bigger place or connection on the overall narrative. Like, Tyrion just started rambling on about beetles out of the blue, with no indication or no relation to the current scene. It just felt very, very, forced. The writers were forcing and turning the dialogue too transparently in order to convey their point and so it felt jarring and out of place.
Â 
3) Ideally, an allegory or metaphor like this should work to shed light on characterization. As it were, the story went on and on and on and we never learned anything about Jaime or Tyrion. On the contrary, the fact that Jaime murdered his cousin was brushed away and the story, as I said before, contradicted Tyrion's previous characterization in terms of feeling empathy with people like Orson.

2) A metaphor or allegory of this kind should come naturally. It should have a bigger place or connection on the overall narrative. Like, Tyrion just started rambling on about beetles out of the blue, with no indication or no relation to the current scene. It just felt very, very, forced. The writers were forcing and turning the dialogue too transparently in order to convey their point and so it felt jarring and out of place.
Â 
3) Ideally, an allegory or metaphor like this should work to shed light on characterization. As it were, the story went on and on and on and we never learned anything about Jaime or Tyrion. On the contrary, the fact that Jaime murdered his cousin was brushed away and the story, as I said before, contradicted Tyrion's previous characterization in terms of feeling empathy with people like Orson.

This, I agree, was a problem for me too, but then, the show has been doing that for a while. I agree with your point, but to me, that's what I expect from literature, very, very few shows have successfully done what you describe. And to me, the monologue did lots of characterisation for Tyrion, it even built up to the climactic scene in ep 10.
Â 
Bad writing. No. I mean, four weeks ago, people on this forum said Cogman's "Fuck'em till they're dead" speech, the most terrible writing this season, was actually really good. At least D&D get subtlety - to a degree. Craster's was bad writing, through and through, for many obvious reasons. But I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.

If that speech was in a book, people would be analysing it for the symbolism, potential foreshadowing, or even just for a hint of the author's own ideals and thoughts. But it's on a screen, thus it can never be as intelligent or well thought out, instead it was just getting in the way of the awesome visual spectacle of the upcoming fight. It was a terrific scene and deserves plaudits both for the writing, but also the acting.


No, if it was in the book, people would still be rolling their eyes at it for being trite, pointless and subtle as a sledgehammer.

Doesn't really have anything to do with their writing...if you think someone cant grow up (kids are nasty little shits to other kids...Tyrion laughing at him probably made him feel normal as an awkward child) and realize they were wrong...yet still be flawed enough to have a laugh about being a little shit...during the most uncomfortable moment in their life...

950	HarlQuinn	2014-06-02	The Sansa scene made my mouth drop. That moment when Sansa was saying how she had to tell the truth... I think for once LF was actually scared. There was something he could not control and after all his plotting and scheming this one moment could ruin EVERYTHING. I think it established that LF has one weakness and it's Sansa; not because of the knowledge she holds, but because of the control she has on him (which is further demonstrated in the moment when he visits her in her room). I am starting to love Sansa and I really hope that she comes to realize that through LF she can finally be in control of herself and her circumstances to an extent. Plus when she cried and was hugged the look that she sent LF screamed "whose the bitch"... ok not so much, but it did show him that he better not write her off as an idiot whom he can manipulate. She know's what's more beneficial to her situation right now and when she comes walking down the steps with her head held high hair dyed black I can finally see the Stark in her.Â I think Arya's laughter wasn't Â completely "haha my life sucks everyone is dead", but moreso she's laughing at how everytime the Hound get's close to being rid of her a death robs him of his chance to make a profit. Of course she's also laughing at her circumstances, but this reflects how a child who has been through so much trauma can be so twisted. For her it's almost like everything is one big joke and with nothing more to lose or gain it's a big FU to the gods that she was raised on and further instills her belief in the god of death. "Nothing is just nothing." this could easily mean that by now she feels nothing towards everything happening around her and with her aunts death it's just another big nothing to her.Â I think the whole part about the beetles meaning nothing is just Tyrion's way of saying "why do I have to die?" he's saying what anyone facing death wrongly accused would say. Why me? Why must I be the one to be born a dwarf, why has my circumstance made my father hate me, why am I the one who get's blamed for killing my nephew, why must I pay the price for someone else's deed? It's just a bunch of why's and he really wants Jamie to provide him some form of an answer even though he knows there isn't really a proper one. His story is a way to show that there is no reason why characters such as Maester Luwin,Septa Mordane etc have to die? They were nothing more than 'beetles' who did no harm, but they were still killed. It just shows how to those in power you but a beetle who if at the wrong place can get crushed. Perhaps I'm looking into it way too much, but I kind of enjoyed that moment between the two and I could really feel the brotherly love; especially when Jaimie turned and said good luck and the smiling and happy glances he gave Tyrion during the battle.Last I wanted to just say my heart is still fluttering at thoughts of that final showdown. Pedro Pascal had me in awe. His acting, his movement, how he carried the spear, that moment, the passion in the way he moved and in the way he spoke. Oberyn was supposed to be toying with the Mountain and I FELT it. Oberyn was supposed to be this fighter who's movements were very different than traditional westeros fighters an I could really see it. I was infatuated with the acting, enamoured with the choreography and how he moved, and completely in love with the character and how Oberyn brought him to life in that moment. It was all exactly how I imagined it. The mountain's brutish style of fighting and his mocking 'I did it speach' as he finished Oberyn off was perfect. That moment where he's talking about crushing Aegon's head and does it to Oberyn gave me a shiver and it was ironic(?), the complete opposite of poetic justice thats for sure. I hated the mountain so much in that moment, but loved the actor. I must say a HUGE props to Pedro Pascal and HafA3A3r JAolA­us BjA¶rnsson.(I may have contradicted myself and I apologize; my mind is a mess of things still recovering from that episode despite knowing a great character would be leaving us, plus I'm so pulling the "It's suuuupppper late at night" card).

964	Tony Inchpractice	2014-06-02	I thought the fight was really good. I liked the location in the book, but thought the arena worked well.
Â 
One thing that I thought they missed from the book, which could have been a good inclusion, was the way the crowd became more interested in the confession than the fight.Â 
Â 
The Scanners moment was just great. I had a feeling they were going to do something like that.
965	BastardlyRock	2014-06-02	Â 
The scene was overlong, tedious, slightly offensive, clumsy, and overall, innecessary.
Â 
The imagery and metaphor was basic and pedestrian to say the least. It's meaning (if we would call it so) was painfully obvious and predictable. I'm honestly baffled at all these interpretations. It was just nihilism at its most basic: things happen for no reason, just because. Orson crushed the beetles because he could, just like the mule kicked him because it could.
Â 
Done, it was paper-thin dialogue. It was all flash and no substance. And worse of all: it was repetitive. We've seen time and time again how violence and death happens just because on this show. That's Ramsay's "If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention", there's even Tyrion's "if you're looking for justice, you've come to the wrong place". Etc, etc, but of course, D&D had to belabor the point because the audience is stupid
Â 
Well, at least I hope the stupid story was about the pointlessness of it all. If it really was a metaphor of Gregor and Oberyn then I just feel sorry for these writers


Â 
  It's no secret I agree with this... As for people who don't "agree" that it was offensive, hi, it offended me.

At first, the meaning seems obvious: it is questioning the point of all this. Then again, perhaps the beetles are metaphors for humans and Orson is a god destroying the beetles/humans for no reason â<U+0080><U+0093> symbolising the way in which characters die in Game of Thrones. And Tyrion represents mankind, and the way in which it constantly looks for meaning in life, asking questions of the gods.

Maybe Orson is meant to represent aliens who will later crush mankind? Think about it: who directed The War of the Worlds, which was about an alien invasion? Holy shit- Orson Welles.

974	Mychel_Redfort	2014-06-02	2) A metaphor or allegory of this kind should come naturally.But it is natural : Tyrion is likely to be soon beheaded, why wouldn't he ponder about mortality and the sense of life ? Tyrion could be angry now, wishing to see all his accusers dead. But no, he puts things into perspective and blame it on absurdity. And he's honest with Jaime : show!Jaime needs this scene to justify his telling the truth about Tysha in the season finale, that will trigger Tyrion's change of mind. Imagine how the Unsullied will react, with Tyrion going in 2 episodes from remembering how he tried to prevent Orson from crashing beetles to killing in cold-blood Shae and Tywin !

Â 
Anyway, onto the situation at hand:
Â 
- Arya's derisive laughter.Â  To me, it looked like she was laughing at the situation, but more-so at the Hound.Â  Everywhere he has tried to dump her off, there has been some setback of some sort.Â  Also, about Arya, one thing I noticed is how much like Jaquen she is going to be in the future,Â  When the Red Woman (Melisandre) faced her a while back, the witch actually looked frightened. Perhaps that was a foreshadowing? Perhaps one of those sets of eyes that Arya closes will be Melisandre's herself. Perhaps she saw her own future?
Â 
- Tyrion's long story about the beetles seemed to set up the brutality of the Mountain.Â  That's how I read into it.
Â 
- Lena, Lena, Lena...... I saw her on Craig Ferguson's talk show. She is an absolute clown! I mean that in a good way. Every other actor I have seen mention her only have good things to say about her. What certainly shows the caliber of her acting ability is how many times I have wanted to throw her out of a high window in King's Landing, especially this past episode. That smug smirk she leveled at Tyrion got my blood boiling so much that I had to sit down and listen to some quiet music for a little while after the episode ended. Hats off to Lena! She finally learned how to drink the glasses of wine she pours! "Drinky, no drinky!!"
Â 
About Cersei though, I think she got off light for all the death, torture, pain, and destruction she has caused.Â  Being paraded naked through the streets of King;s Landing?? Really?? She wanted Tyrion's head off!!
Â 
I have read the book series twice and am going through ADWD for the third time.Â  I can't wait to see Tyrion's boat trip put on film.Â  And I honestly hope they work Penny in. Her character is a very important turning point for Tyrion. She's too pivotal to leave out.Â  But, then, I also thought the same thing about Osmund Kettleback.Â  So, is Tyrion only going to spill the beans about Lancel? We shall see in a couple weeks, I guess!

Â 
And on it goes on and on in circles.

I personally feel that it was a metaphor for a couple of things, but ultimately it is Tyrion delving into the unfairness of the world. The gods kill indiscriminately, and he was born as a dwarf that killed his mother and thus earned the everlasting spite of his father and sister. 
He is very close to facing death and he is wondering why the world is the way it is. Understand that at this point, he's in this very messed up situation for entirely unjust reasons. His own father wants to get rid of him either by sending him to the wall or by outright murdering him. 
He identified with both Orson for being different and with the beetles for being persecuted. There's a clever nuance in this scene when Jamie points out how Tyrion found it humorous to observe another 'disabled' person. It establishes the hierarchy of the world; just like he is above Orson, Orson is above the beetles. 
At first, I didn't like this scene. But the more I think about it, the more I like about it. It adds fuel to Jamie's motivations to free him later and it highlights just how much Tyrion has had to go through, simply for being who he is.
981	texbook	2014-06-02	Hi everyone! First post here on the forum - woohoo!

Â 
i agree with you completely
985	Arya Havinfun	2014-06-02	Â Some folks complain about Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s near soliloquy (in season 4 Episode 8) about a brain damaged cousin named Orson Lannister who was obsessed with killing beetles.
Â 
It seemed an apt allegory for the breathtakingly irrational and relentless way that humans and everything else in this world gets mercilessly slaughtered all the time, and a not-too-difficult-to-see metaphor for Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trying to face the fear of being irrationally killed himself.Â  If there are gods, they are just as unreasonably broken as his cousin.Â  Quite poignant, actually, as he realizes that being the smartest guy he knows doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t always mean he can reason (or buy) his way out of any threat to his life and/or comfort.Â  He so loves playing the â<U+0080><U+009C>Game of Thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D>, and is lamenting that his personal â<U+0080><U+009C>Gameâ<U+0080><U+009D> appears to be ending. 
Â 
Some folks also state their belief that it's really GRRM who kills everybody relentlessly. Â The thing that made me laugh out loud was the sudden realization that this speech was an homage to Orson Scott Card, a famous scifi writer who wrote a series of books that focused on the moral results of endlessly killing Buggers, starting with the novel â<U+0080><U+009C>Enderâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Gameâ<U+0080><U+009D>. Â  D&D must have had such a fun time writing that little tribute, just the sort of thing GRRM puts into the books all the time! Â I wonder if they got the idea from GRRM or if they thought that little easter egg up on their own? Â Â  Â Â

988	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-02	I realized something about the Arya laughing bit. Right before it happens they were talking about how nothing beats the look in someone's eyes when they realize it's all over.
Â 
Ignore that because she never actually looked at him in that scene

989	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	i cant tell if Aryas laughing at the Hound or how fucked her situation is AGAIN..
990	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	I rewatched the episode, as is my tradition, and I realized something about the Arya laughing bit. Right before it happens they were talking about how nothing beats the look in someone's eyes when they realize it's all over. I think she started laughing because she saw that look in Sandor's eyes.Â 


Â 
she started laughing like a maniac before looking at him...

993	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-02	I think the dead men outside Moat Cailin were Crannogmen.


Some might be, but like in the books, they were more likely Ironborn trying to exit the Moat and flee only to get shot by the poison arrows/darts or get bitten by the snakes around the place. Those poor bastards were literally stuck with nowhere to go and no hope left.Â
994	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	just rewatched Beetle scene...i cant claim to understand or comprehend all of the subtext, but definitely wasnt useless...i can bet there will some future significance to it...Â
995	The Knight of Grasses	2014-06-02	Outside of the Grey Worm - Missandei scenes, which, while heartfelt, seem rather pointless, I thought this was by far the best episode of the season. Â The Sansa twist was interesting. Â Arya and the Hound are always great. Â Dany dismissing Jorah. Â The Tyrion - Jaime beetle scene was really good. Â And then, of course, the duel, which was fantastic. Â I found myself rooting for Oberyn and imploring him to end it, even though I knew what would happen.
Â 
Great episode.
996	Relic	2014-06-02	Â 
UnHound too??
No,  he survives his wound and ends up in a monastery as a grave digger . It's in one of brienne's chapters in affc. Not officially confirmed but I give it a 99% chance of being true. He will probably be the Faith's champion against unGregor. http://asoiaf.wester...plete-analysis/

998	Boltons Bastard	2014-06-02	Don't like Reek and Ramsey moments in this episode. Ramsey looked too normal and human, even though he'd just flayed some people.Â 
Â 
The Bolton army assembled out on the plains with Roose and Ramsey stood on the hill was also a nice touch.Â
999	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	god damn! just watched the fight again! so fast paced! so much room to maneuver! hound vs. berric was nothing be comparison! ned vs. Jaime was similar area, still smaller but about a third of the length!
Â 
whoever didnt like it...guys u really gottta rewatch it....the mountain was constantly charging at him like a raging bull! oberyn kept attacking and retreating, looking for a weak spot...while he might have had time in the beginning to let the mountain know who he was and why he was there...soon as oberyn clearly states that he wants Gregors confession, gregor charges at him and doesnt stop charging!Â 

Gregor knocked him down twice! broke one of his spears! Oberyn stopped playing around after that, thats why he went for kill move to bring him down...after Gregor was down...oberyn continued to get his confession
Â 
the entire fight, from Gregor's first swing to hearing Oberyns skull crushing is 3mins and 6secs...
Â 
i will grant you that there might have been one to many camera angles for the fight, showing everyones reaction so frequently was unnecessary and yes the Mountains helmet was stupid...but it doesnt bother me, IMO was an amaaazing fight sequence and truly perfect to the books...
1000	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-02	Its funny to see the internet going crazy over how violent the outcome of the duel was but nobody seems to be saying anything about the excruciating and lengthy death the Iron Born soldier was subject to.
1001	a white raven	2014-06-02	No word for cousin killing. Since Tywins death is kinda foreshadowed by LF, anyone thinks someone will kill a cousin?
Sansa killing Robin will be symmetrical. At KL, two people talk about killing cousins, and at Vale, two people talk about dying in a privy.
Other possibility: Jaime killing Lancel, though I see no point in that.

1005	TheCrimsonKing	2014-06-02	I just watched a handful of unsullied reaction videos to Oberyn's "crushing defeat" (nod and wink to Half Man). As with a lot of the other unsullied reactions, they were pretty predictable. But, I did notice the reactions either had them grabbing their mouths or their heads in sympathy for what Oberyn went through. 
And as for those few comments I saw on here about Oberyn screaming "like a girl".  Really??? What would you do in his position? Troll The Mountain with bad comments on twitter?

Â 
im assuming you are talking about the guy Ramsay flayed? its the same all the time...general people dont bat an eye when millions of african kids starve to death, but 370 people disappear on a plane and they lose their minds for months....people only care about the people they like or are interested in...no tears shed over an unnamed, unknown person even if they were skinned alive

You take all his skin and his eyes, man that's sick.
1010	a white raven	2014-06-02	No word for cousin killing - I tend to think that was a reference to Jaime killing Lancel. Jaime is the one who says "cousins". He looked like he was thinking back on his own kin-killing as Tyrion listed all the `cides. Tyrion may not understand why all the beetles had to die because in his world, he is a beetle. A dwarf who's own father and sister detest him. Even with all the Lannister gold and all the clever wit, Tyion is a beetle in the eyes of most men. I'll bet Jaime, a soldier, understands it a little though, after all he was kingsguard to the mad king Aerys. The reason the beetles had to die is because the world is fucked and those who can kill do kill. Because they can.
1011	II_CHIEF	2014-06-02	What are they doing with Jon this season!!Â 
Again another totally pointless, boring scene in the same room achieving nothing but watering Jon's character down, anyone else feeling this way? Its killing me a little bit haha.Â
1012	espresso	2014-06-02	- Arya's derisive laughter.Â  To me, it looked like she was laughing at the situation, but more-so at the Hound.Â  Everywhere he has tried to dump her off, there has been some setback of some sort.Â  Also, about Arya, one thing I noticed is how much like Jaquen she is going to be in the future,Â  When the Red Woman (Melisandre) faced her a while back, the witch actually looked frightened. Perhaps that was a foreshadowing? Perhaps one of those sets of eyes that Arya closes will be Melisandre's herself. Perhaps she saw her own future?

I would love someone, anyone to kill Melisandre(destroy her, if she is already dead). But Melisandre's eyes in the books are red. Not sure what color in the show. Mel said Arya will kill someone with blue eyes, brown eyes and green eyes.
Â 
Blue eyed people: Sansa, Edmure, Blackfish, Gendry, Stannis, Shireen, Harry the Heir, Brienne,..
Brown eyes: fake Arya. I don't remember anyone else
Green eyes: Jaime, Cersei (Tyrion has one black eye, so he doesn't have green 'eyes' ), Myrcella,..

I picked up on that cousin-killing nod to Jaime as well.
Â 
My take on the beetle smooshing was that it is in reference to the Gods. Orson being like a god to those beetles just taking their lives as he pleases represents how really everyone in the realm is at the mercy of the Gods and could be 'smooshed' at any moment.

While it seems likely he is the gravedigger (I'd say pretty much 99% confirmed). We have no knowledge that he will come back to fight Robert Strong with that bum leg and limp of his. That might have just been a nice little "Hey everybody he's let go of the pain now" moment. So for the visual medium, they might just bump him off. Not saying it will happen...but it's a possibility.Â

1020	Frosta	2014-06-02	I rolled my eyes more than a couple of times but I liked so much of the episode, even some things I didn't like I think make sense.
Every episode I see more and more it was a HUGE mistake to not have Ygritte and the wildlings attack in like the first episode. All this raiding and killing women/children is hurting that arc. Jon's race to the Wall and packing up Mole's Town to save them/defend Castle Black would have just been great TV. THEN you could have let the Wall chill off until the end of the season and Stannis' arrival.
The stuff with Grey Worm and Missandei is a confusing distraction but it's for the viewers and I fear it may set up a soul-crushing Grey Worm death.
Lysa a suicide and Sansa just straight Starking herself? That may work out to make sense in a way but I'm not sure where they are going with it. Also, a huge shift in Sansa's character. Does this lend credence to Winds of Winter theories? Anyway, it's way different but I was totally locked in from the moment Littlefinger suggested that it was suicide. I don't like Sansa sort of accepting Littlefinger's perving of her but the fact that she is trying to take control is a nice change.
Roose must have been holding back that letter declaring Ramsey a Bolton for a long time. I kind of like that. It's very much like Roose to do that.
Jorah getting the boot exactly as we figured they might do it and it does work for the show.Fucking A, they are legit trolling us by giving Jojen's catch phrase to Oberyn.
The fight was amazing though and I still felt such pain seeing Oberyn get cocky instead of just finishing him off. For a second I almost believed. That punch knocking out like half his teeth was just nuts. Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't The Mountain stay pinned down by the spear in the book?
Â 


pardon my ignorance... but what catchphrase do you mean?

This guy has the right build though, they could have stuck with Ian Whyte and had Gregor at the right height but he would have been built like a whippet.
Â 
This lad is 100 pounds heavier than Conan Stevens even though he's slightly shorter, he's much more powerful looking.


Yea considering he smashes someone's head in, I think it's more important that his strength is conveyed than his height. Plus 6'9" is still pretty damn tall.Â

Â 
Some people are criticising Emilia's acting during this scene, but I thought it actually came across quite well.

Â 
Apparently on HBO's website the "behind the episode" features make mention that the spears were coated with poison (and that's what actually was going on when he was "shining" that spear).Â  However, they made no mention/nod to this in the show, which was a bit frustrating.
Â 
Although that one slice of the leg where he hamstrings the Mountain could plausibly have severed the Achilles tendon which would permanently wreck the Mountain, poison or no (I'm pretty sure Gregor never stands again after that cut).
Â 
Indria Varma delivered one of the All Time Great Horrified Screams btw.Â  MAJOR kudos.Â  That actually affected me more than the head asplode.

Agreed.Â Plus i really think she would have flubbed the hell out of a more emotional performance. Being more cold is probably a better mark.

I'm not even sure why they even tapped her for this role, that's about the only thing she has done all season long. Maybe they have some plans for her going forward, maybe she sort of plays the role of Tanea Merryweather, it wouldn't really make sense but she is a decent actress and it seems like a waste to give her such a secondary role.

1042	Zman1863	2014-06-02	Since episode ten is actually going to cover significant events this year, I'm a little worried that there is going to be too much going on with episode 9 being exclusively focused on the wall.
Â 
The season finales in this show tend to be too much of a montage. Maybe they've gotten it right this year. It seems clear that the Theon/Ramsay/Roose thread has concluded for the season. Odds on Sansa's thread has also concluded.Â 
Â 
So that leaves, Tyrion and Jaime, Tyrion and Varys, Tyrion and Shae, Tyrion and Tywin, Jon's election, Arya and the Hound, Brienne and Pod, Cersei and maybe Tommen. Tyrion's climax is obviously the big event, but Jon's election could be a time consuming event. Additionally, Arya's story does not seem to have progressed as far as one might think to this point. How are they going to fit the Hound's "death" and Arya's finding a ship in one episode without seeming abrupt given the bite hasn't noticeably affected the hound as of yet? On their review video Elio and Linda speculated that perhaps Arya would intersect with Brienne but that might make things more problematic- especially if there is to be no Stoneheart reveal this season.Â

Yes, because Arya's certainly not a well-developed character who could be laughing at a COMBINATION of factors in this scene, correct? Such as another dead relative, another dashing of the Hound's hopes for reward, another dead end overall? Naw, that's just too much to buy, right?
1048	Zman1863	2014-06-02	Â + Bran as the episode title is "The Children"
Â 
Good point on Ayra, not much time for that arc to wrap up, especially getting on the ship.


Â 
Knew I forgot somebody and it's the most overtly linked to the title. It's a lot to be going on with. As long as they don't botch Tyrion and Jon I think I'll be content. But then Arya's ASOS arc has a definitive end, and I'm not sure that's going to work out regardless.Â
1049	Huck	2014-06-03	Â 
No what I meant was that he seems somewhat normal in these scenes, and not all that evil at all. He talks to Theon like they're best pals, with all the arm-round-the-shoulder and back-slaps.Â 


Â 
He is completely unpredicatble -- being a sociopath doesn't mean that you can't play at being nice when you like.
1050	uhyana	2014-06-03	Maybe the season finale, "The Children" not only refer to the children of the forest, but the stark children as well. And then we'll see lady Stoneheart talk about her children.
1051	Mel_Rose	2014-06-03	Since episode ten is actually going to cover significant events this year, I'm a little worried that there is going to be too much going on with episode 9 being exclusively focused on the wall.
Â 
The season finales in this show tend to be too much of a montage. Maybe they've gotten it right this year. It seems clear that the Theon/Ramsay/Roose thread has concluded for the season. Odds on Sansa's thread has also concluded.Â 
Â 
So that leaves, Tyrion and Jaime, Tyrion and Varys, Tyrion and Shae, Tyrion and Tywin, Jon's election, Arya and the Hound, Brienne and Pod, Cersei and maybe Tommen. Tyrion's climax is obviously the big event, but Jon's election could be a time consuming event. Additionally, Arya's story does not seem to have progressed as far as one might think to this point. How are they going to fit the Hound's "death" and Arya's finding a ship in one episode without seeming abrupt given the bite hasn't noticeably affected the hound as of yet? On their review video Elio and Linda speculated that perhaps Arya would intersect with Brienne but that might make things more problematic- especially if there is to be no Stoneheart reveal this season.Â 


I used to believe that we'll see Jon's election in the finale, but it seems unlikely to me now. Esp with where Arya's story is, and the Cersei + someone conversations we haven't seen. So I reckon elections might be moved to premiere or early eps of season 5.
1052	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-03	Â 
Apparently on HBO's website the "behind the episode" features make mention that the spears were coated with poison (and that's what actually was going on when he was "shining" that spear).Â  However, they made no mention/nod to this in the show, which was a bit frustrating.


Â 
Yeah, they didn't mention the poison, but they'll definitely reveal it was poisoned in the 10th ep. They have to have a scene with Cersei, Qyburn, and the Mountain that screams. Otherwise, why have Qyburn in the first episode of the season and then never show him again?

Â 


Â 
I kinda agree. They essentially ended Sansa's and Theon's arcs this episode, I wouldn't be surprised if they ended Jon's arc next episode, too.

Â 


Maybe the bite isn't what finishes him. Maybe in episode 10 they'll cut straight to a scene with Arya and the Hound running away from the Eyrie with the Hound having arrows in his back. That for me would be preferable to some fanfiction scenario where Brienne conveniently bumps into the two of them and either teams up with them against hill tribes or ends up fighting and mortally wounding the Hound.
Nothing makes a fantasy world seem tiny quite like the constant "random" coming together of notable characters.

Â 
I also think it's likely we will see Dany's storyline finish with her chaining her 'children' up, fits in well with the episode title.Â 
I'm still hoping we will see Arya sail away at the end of the season, otherwise they are massively slowing her story arc down, while with Sansa they have now finished pretty much everything we have in the books :-/
1055	igrewupinKL	2014-06-03	Arya will sail away in episode 10. They have apparently cast a bravoosi ship captain.Â

The other guy asked if he was a woman (as in don't be a pussy of course I'm not surrendering, I'm Iron Born)

Â 
Why would Reek care if it's cut off? So it was Theon speaking, worrying about his reputation.Â 
Â 
My whole point is, Theon is not replaced by Reek, he's just a coward that would rather be humiliated and live like a rat, than fight and die an honorable death.Â 
Â 
Â

Â 
So just a coward then. How about he fights and dies with his brethren in the keep? But I guess he had that poop bath and trash food and cage, and the constant fear and agony to look forward to if he succeeded!Â

Reek does care tho
He spends a large amount of his chapters in DwD obsessing that nobody should see him naked, the thought of anyone finding out sends him into almost as much of a panic as the thought of Ramsay getting sliceyÂ

The Iron Born captain calling him a woman is clearly what sets him off and the rest is obviously referencing this part of his personaÂ

So he doesn't care he's covered in dog crap, but he cares about people not knowing what Ramsay did. That's the only part of Theon that is "alive".Â

He's broken so expecting any form of consistency in his character is pointless,
but its clear from his chapters in Dance that his 2 prime motivations are shame about what's been done to him and fear of giving ramsay an excuse to do moreÂ

I don't know about that. They seem to be moving things pretty fast, and LC election IS in ASOS. They'd want to wrap that up this season. All they have to do is mention of the LC elections in stannis/jon talk. Have a few scenes with Sam trying to convince people and then the election itself. They'll keep the rest of the jon/stannis/melisandre interaction for next season.
1068	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-03	I haven't gone through the whole thread yet, but I saw a lot of hate or disinterest re: the Grey Worm/Missandei story line. So I just wanted to give it some love. I was actually concerned that aging Missandei up would mean she replaced Irri in the "Dany is sexually frustrated" plotline, which I was not looking forward to at all. Instead, they've given her and Grey Worm a sweet - though I guess it's bitter as well - and tentative romance that helps remind me that there's still moments of goodness to be have in the midst of the unrelenting tragedy. I know they're barely supporting characters and it might feel like a waste of time, but it's also such a rare thing to actually get the stories of the downtrodden on this show. The Game of Thrones isn't just about the highborns and their power struggles - everything they do affects the commoners. Of course, Missandei and Grey Worm's lives have been much more difficult than your average ASOIAF lowborns, as they've been slaves very nearly from birth. So to watch that they do with their newfound freedom and how they relate to the world that Dany is trying to build is really refreshing to me.
Â 
As for Sansa, well, I'm still of two minds about it. I'm happy to see her taking charge, and I'm thrilled that D&D definitely grasped how she's putting together all the lessons she's learned over her years of captivity. I'm mostly just concerned that they'll push too far with Sansa/Petyr - which is definitely not something I want to see - and also that they'll forgo Sansa's core of human decency in favor of flashy game-playing tactics. Not to mention that I was hoping that Alayne "revealing" herself to be Sansa in the books would be accompanied by Littlefinger's downfall, so now I'll have to wait for another course of action. I do love how she one-upped him, though. She could have him eating out of her hand and he knows it.

I think Sansa revealing herself in the books could still be linked to LF's downfall. And we are underestimating LF

Â 
Right before that part all the ironborn chanted the classic "What is dead may never die"-line.
Â 
As an ironborn Theon should know the rest by heart: "What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger."
Â 
That probably almost snapped Reek back into Theon, which then of course made him almost break down when insults were being hurled at him about being a woman, having had his manhood taken from him and all.
Which led him to start saying "You don't know what I've been through..." etc.
Â 
The fact that he then magically "succeeded" in his mission didn't seem to make him very happy, because then he knew he had to deal with the aftermath of it again - going back to the Reek-person and Ramsey Sn... Bolton!

i see where your coming from...definitely agree would be too weird to see Tywin on the shitter...but the point of it was that was a humiliating death, dead whore on the bed on top of the fact that it was his own son killing him....so im okay with some change, but not too drastic...perhaps still in the bathroom, but washing hands or something...
Â 
after the crossbow, he might land on the shitter or something...or skip that part, long as he dies in the bathroom with Shae dead on the bed and Tyrion kills him, i'm okay with it...if dagger/sword instead of crossbow, or just dead body drops on the bathroom floor...

1090	TheCrimsonKing	2014-06-03	I think the very last seconds of Episode 10 will be Lady Stoneheart. The Tywin/Tyrion scene will be most likely shortly before it. Maybe Tyrion escaping.  Either way, It will probably be one hell of an episode! Just imagine all those unsullied reaction videos going up on YouTube!

Is Michelle going to play her? Or will they just slap some make up on an anonymous actress? As LS can't speak and is horribly mutilated it seems a waste of money to pay for a top shelf actress to play her.
1092	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-03	I think it's best she does. She's not in many scenes anyway, and it will have less impact and might confuse people if it's not clearly Michelle. Certain more than Asha-Osha would have. This isn't the Mountain or Daario, people we have no emotional attachment to (well, except hate now for the Mountain). This is a woman whose death really upset a lot of viewers

It would never work with a different actress, and the show does make a fair amount of money to afford spending a rather inconsequential sum of money to provide a great effect and reaction.
1094	LugaJetboyGirl-irra	2014-06-03	God, I really want to participate in this discussion but this thread is so long I despair of even reading a few pages of it.
Â 
I will say that I really loved that the episode had such a visual link to the tradition of ASOIAF art. So many of the scenes were laid out in compositions that couldn't help but be familiar to followers of fantasy art and art from the series. I thought the colors were stunning and some of the scenes had really spectacular imagery - the meeting of the two Bolton armies, the scenes inside the Eyrie (whether that wonderful winding LF stroll down the stairs, Sansa in her room, or the great shots in the LF trial) , the dramatic ugliness outside Moat Cailin with Theon on his horse, Grey Worm leaping into the river viewed from under water, Barriston and Mormont on the outside terrace, the absolutely stunning battle location in Kings Landing.Â 
Â 
So many of the episodes lack that epic visual element, but I thought it was well done in this case.
Â 
It was a feast for the eyes.
Â 
(Of course, as Pod says, it may helped that I was watching it in HD).
1095	Mithras	2014-06-03	A more important question: Did he poison Tywin before the duel?
1096	littleRickon	2014-06-03	It wouldn't imply that LF was involved. It would in fact just be dramatic irony


Â 
The guy who two episodes back had the big reveal that it was miraculously him behind the murder of a very important character in S01E01 talks about people dying on chamber pots and then another two episodes later a very important character dies on the chamber pot and the unsullied are not going to suspect him?
Â 
seems misleading to me.
1097	Mithras	2014-06-03	By the way, did anybody think that Orson Lannister sounds quite similar to Whoreson Lannister.
1098	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-03	Â

How the fuck could Littlefinger control, predict, or influence Tyrion shooting his own father while taking a crap. It's just one of those little nods to people who pay attention while watching/rewatching.
1099	Gregor Blows in the Wind	2014-06-03	CouldÂ Jaime and Tyrion discussing 'Cousin murder' (and how there is no word for it) be a hint at Sansa killing Robin, or be involved inÂ his death somehow?
I thought Jaime chimed in about cousins because he killed his cousin.

1104	TheCrimsonKing	2014-06-03	Littlefinger went through the Ho-Door many times in fact. So, he IS guilty for Ho-Door!

As far as Lady Stoneheart goes, doesn't she speak in AFFC when she is pronouncing sentence on Pod and Brienne?

1109	ChrisSnow77	2014-06-03	About Cersei though, I think she got off light for all the death, torture, pain, and destruction she has caused.Â  Being paraded naked through the streets of King;s Landing?? Really?? She wanted Tyrion's head off!!
Â 


Â 
She is going on trial for all the death, torture, pain and destruction she caused, that is why she is asking for trial by combat with the Frankenstein-Mountain as her champion.
Â 
She got paraded through the streets naked for having sex outside of marriage with Lancel & the Kettleblacks. The only sins she admitted to.

Â 
Lots of people assume that Ser Robert Strong has no head, but I tend to think that he has. Â I mean, he has the senses of sight and hearing/sound, no? Â I'm guessing that his head is that of Falyse Stokeworth, whom Quyburn was experimenting with about the same time as he was experimenting with Ser Gregor.

1113	Grail King	2014-06-03	Â I laughed out loud when Sansa came out dressed as Elvira. I guess she's supposed to be an evil super villain now lol.


Well I take a different take,per old Nan book or TV when she spoke to Bran, don't listen to crows they're all liars.
The wardrobe is the writers saying Sansa is playing the game she's becoming a better liar; to Petyr her dress is hubba,hubbaÂ  
Just a matter of if she is doing it for her and family or for Petyr.

Â 
I think TV-Sansa came out dressed as a vamp because she's tired of being shuffled about the board and wants some say in her own fate; and acknowledging her maturity is a way of influencing Littlefinger. Â Also, TV-Sansa is what, 16 or 17 now; while book Sansa, last time we saw her, was still 13. Â TV-Sansa is being "bastard brave" like book-Alayne, but in the way that a maturing teenager might be, not a younger girl.
1115	Ghost wind	2014-06-03	What I Liked:
Â 
THE TRIAL: awesome in every way, though they could have had it going on longer. It was only seven minutes left and the trial had not started and I was like come on give us the fucking trial! Couldn't look in the head smashing though..
Â 
Black Jack, Keggs and Mully! I love when we get random names dropped from the books! I think it is because of the awesomeness of every name GRRM creates! They go perfect with the characters.
Â 
Moat Cailin: you could see how little strength the garrison had left. Though i would have liked to see the part when the guard doesn't know who is in command and he is like that dude died a week ago and i haven't moved one finger...!Â 
Â 
Jorah's exile: thought Clarke's acting was perfect. Very well handled in every aspect.
Â 
What I didn't like:
Â 
About Sansa I don't mind her outwitting LF (though I think it is going too fast) but what I can't stand is that the lords declarant would know about Sansa Stark being alive suddenly and do nothing! I mean, you wouldn't trust them a secret like that. And the same applies to Arya: you just go to a random guard and tell him you are Arya Stark? Like hello, everyone in this world is looking for me but it doesn't matter I will just reveal my true identity. There is a reason for which they Â hide their identities and they should stay that way. Also, how hot did Sansa look in her last scene? I thought it was just too distracting really! Not going to complain if she shows up like that every time!
Â 
Missandei and Grey Worm is completely pointless, boring and just ruining both their characters! Grey Worm is awesome because he is so devoted to Dany and freedom I can't see him in love, it just makes me want to puke
Â 
Beetles: I mean three minutes talking about beetles to reach no conclusion (at least they could have told us why he smashed the beetles) and three minutes lost in awesome fighting.
1116	Colonel Green	2014-06-03	About Sansa I don't mind her outwitting LF (though I think it is going too fast) but what I can't stand is that the lords declarant would know about Sansa Stark being alive suddenly and do nothing! I mean, you wouldn't trust them a secret like that.


What would they be expected to do?Â  Sansa's content to stay where she is, and as they pointed out, it isn't an opportune time to be waging war, with the Lannister-Tyrell alliance so seemingly secure.
1117	TheFacelessOther	2014-06-03	Best line of the episode:
Â 
"Valeric? Tried to touch me once"
1118	Grail King	2014-06-03	Â

But I didn't put in what Sansa thought, because we don't know, but the writers know and it was their clue to us.

After the LC election...there's nothing for John to do until the Pink Letter eventually leading to his "event", that will make even remotely interesting TV viewing. Lets face it...I like Jons material in ADwD...but it's a lot of introspective stuff and politics of the wall that will not keep unsullied attention.
Â 
If he's elected LC in Ep. 10 they're going to meander about at the wall doing nothing all season? Unless they just plan on having a Jon/Stannis scene every third episode and drag that along. We'll see I guess.


There's lots of material, and interesting as well.Â 
- saying goodbye to sam, gilly and maester aemon (ep.1)
- melisandre interactions/stannis claiming the castles along the wall (ep 2)
- Slynt beheading (ep 3)
- stannis planning attack on winterfell (ep 4)
- finally letting the wildlings through then stannis departure (ep 5)
- Jon organising thing from ep6-10 ultimately ending with his stabbing
Â 


Â 
Â 
They finished her emotional arc. they Â are still actions which she has to do.
Â 
Everything Â I listed before are actions which must be done.


They are going to skip her actions. The only thing she will be doing is meeting the ladies of the vale on her 'tour' with sweetrobin. And i'm sure it'll be different than the books, they'll skip the descent.Â
1127	Zarinna	2014-06-03	I'm not sure what the purpose of a Grey Worm/Missandi love story is and I have absolutely no interest. Â I am not interested in Daenerys at all though. Â It is a shame because Emilia Clark showed how great she can be in season one imo. Â In ASoS, it is believable that she stays in Mereen because of her doubts and youth, but the Daenerys of the show is cold, calculating and in control at all times. This Daenerys imo makes me wonder wtf are you waiting for? Go to Westeros and I think many who watch the show only will become frustrated with her.
Â 
Seriously, end this Grey Worm/Missandi story line.
Â 
I totally disagree with the change in plot for Littlefinger. Â It made the master strategist look inept.
Â 
Seriously, end this Grey Worm/Missandi story line.
Â 
But if the purpose of Littlefinger looking inept was to reveal Sansa Stark to show just how amazing an actress Sophie Turner is, they succeeded triumphantly. Sophie Turner owned that scene. For the first time I felt like I had never read the books. Â I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen, and I envied the unsullied for the first time. It was a truly strange feeling. Â It actually had me think "maybe they won't kill Oberyn" for just a second, then I righted my brain. Sophie Turner stole this episode imo.Â 
Â 
And lastly, seriously end this Grey Worm/Missandi story line. Â It serves no purpose imo except to spend time in Mereen.

Â 
Â

The worst part is the characters in the books are totally different. Â Missandi is a little girl and Grey Worm may be a dedicated soldier, but he never has an original thought. Even in the last Ser Barristan chapter in ADwD when trying to finalize a strategy for the defense of Meereen, all he offers is that the Unsullied will obey. Thanks Grey Worm we all know that. How about something that will help us win with as few casualties as possible.

Â

Â 
I don't know about you, but being born is not an achievement in my book.Â 

So you think lying and manipulating several parties (including the king of lying) in that way to protect herself and being that convincing wasn't badass? Truly?
1145	Woman of War	2014-06-04	After nobody had mentioned it until page 26, I lost my patience and decided to write it down, no matter if it's been said since:
Â 
The beetle scene begins with Tyrion thinking about the absurdity of trials by combats, telling Jaime that this practice is saying so much about gods. What he realises here is what Arya realises before she begins to laugh - if there are gods in the world they live in, they must be cruel or mad. Arya and Tyrion develop two kinds of nihilistic reactions to the world in the first three books: Arya worships death which alone offers some sort of meaning or purpose, Tyrion is drowing himself in wine, unable to cope with his epiphany in any other way. The beetle scene was phenomenal, it was much, much more than a meta joke on GRRM killing characters or a way to foreshadow the Viper's or the Mountain's fate. It gave us a glimpse of Tyrion going dark, just as Sansa and Arya became a few shades darker in the episode. Give D&D some credit for their writing, it's a lot more clever and thought through than many posters here seem to realise.
Great analysis
1146	Kingpin	2014-06-04	So you think lying and manipulating several parties (including the king of lying) in that way to protect herself and being that convincing wasn't badass? Truly?


Â 
Who wouldn't believe a young noble crying? It could've been anyone. What if she was a whore?Â 
Â 
I respect people that are what they are with their own powers. If they both inherited their power AND expanded on it, I respect them. If all they've got is being someone's son/daughter or husband/wife, then they're nothing in my book. That's why I respect Tywin and Jaime, but not Cersei. Yes, they're Lannisters, but one is brilliant and the other is a great fighter. Cersei is someone's wife and someone's daughter, and because of that she has capable people under her command and through them she forces her will.
Â 
And the king of lying is Varys!Â

1147	Lady Lurksalot	2014-06-04	I just need a quick reminder with next week's episode coming up, but does Pyp die during the attack on the Wall? The general consensus seems to be that Grenn is taking the place of Donal Noye and will bite it in the tunnel, but Pyp has been a little more prominent in the last few NW scenes and has mentioned the lack of faith in his ability to kill a hundred wildlings, but I can't remember if this is foreshadowing his eventual end or not. I know they can't all survive, and there would be a full scale riot at HBO headquarters if Edd doesn't make it, so my theory is Pyp and Grenn will be the ones to go.  :-(
1148	Domonju	2014-06-04	No one complained this week about Aiden Gillen's accent changes so there's that 


Â 
I think I finally understand the thing about his accent changes after reading the interview here. When he is relaxed and with people who know him on a personal intimate level he speaks with that rough edge. When he is speaking to lords or in some kind of formal situation he polishes up his speech. It all makes sense now.

Â 
Yeah they do a lot of logic fails, but really they are only evident for us book readers because we already know all the characters and their stories. Most of the unsullied won't remember the name of every character or every single detail about their lives so they prefer having a graphic scene or simplifying the plot rather than connecting everything logically. For example, a friend of mine (unsullied) couldn't remember Stannis' name and he is an important character so imagine some minor one.Â

1162	Bushum	2014-06-04	I have another example of the show dumbing down the story.Â  On the map that Jorah is looking at near :30 into the episode it completely omits Slaver's Bay, Valryia, and the west coast of Essos.Â  It shows Meereen directly across the Narrow Sea from King's Landing.Â  Part of the reason for Dany being stuck in Meereen is because of the vast distance back to Westeros.Â  She doesn't have the ships to go by sea and can't risk the long march on the Demon Road.Â  Again, are we too dumb to be able to comprehendÂ distances or a sense of a large world?

Â 
It was totally badass imo. I thought her performance was amazing. One of the best single performances on the show by any actress or actor. Â Emilia Clarke's mastery of the languages is impressive, but she never came close to this amount of raw emotion. Â Since this still hasn't happened in the books, I wonder if we are going to see the controversial Sansa scene before it happens in the book.

Whatever happens, Sophie Turner absolutely owned her role and I am actually more excited about Sansa's future then most other character's because of the unknown.

Â 
No kidding. Arya at the end of ASoS was totally broken and would never have broken out into laughter. It is ridiculous to postulate that the Arya of GoT is darker than the books. She left The Hound to the wolves rather than give him the gift of mercy. She was totally alone whereas in GoT she has latched onto The Hound and is developing a relationship. How many times does she think about having a hole where her heart should be? She has nothing but her list, a prayer for the power to give death to those she hates.

more so setting up a backstory for the attacks on unsullied in mereen and being killed by the SoTH. Some were killed on their routine patrols,which prompted mandated "buddy patrols". When unsullied continue getting killed at night, readers find out that some visit the pleasure houses.Now show-Dany and viewers will be able to make sense of Eunuchs visiting whorehouses, since they both see a firsthand example (rather than a second hand story) about Unsullied still having sexual/romantic feelings.....that is unless they cut that part of the mereen story out.

You can clearly see how dark a road she is going down. Look at how she killed the guy in the pub with Needle, and the other guy who said what he was going to do to her with her own sword (Rorge).Â  She didn't bat an eyelash.Â  Also what she did to those idiots who were laughing about her brother's murder and mutilation around the fire.Â 
Â 
I honestly love to see her go down this dark path. Westeros is long overdue for a character like her: some kind of dark avenger, which she is slowly becoming through ADWD. Like I said before, she is basically becoming Jaqen H'Ghar in female form. And to me, that's pretty damn cool. I'm rooting for her!

1179	northernwarg	2014-06-04	I read this on another board about the Orson story:
Â 
I laughed for about five minutes after this episode aired. Don't misunderstand me. It's tragic what happened tonight. The show introduced a compelling character and spent the majority of the season fleshing him out beautifully, giving him purpose and deftly balancing his humor with pathos. He heroically fights for Tyrion in a visceral battle with The Mountain, filled with kinetic bravado, and just when you think he'll achieve catharsis, he's thwarted. He gets his confession as his eyes are gouged out and he's cranially decimated. Cersei smiles, Tywin sentences his son to death, and Tyrion stares dumbfounded.
Why?
Refer to the penultimate scene between Tyrion and Jamie. They talk of their simple cousin who spent his days smashing beetles. Tyrion is fascinated by his moronic actions while family legacies and Targaryen dragons fade into the background. All that's left is the sound of the killings.Â "And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it, and I had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."Â Orson gave no answer and he kept on killing until he was kicked in the chest by a mule and died.
This is Coen Brothers level absurdity, and at the end of this episode not only did Oberyn's death make sense, but everything else did as well. Suddenly everything from the Red Wedding to Ned Stark's death was put sharply into perspective. George R. R. Martin is the cousin killing beetles and the only thing left to do isÂ laugh.


Beautifully put. I loved how Pascal and the writers brought Oberyn to the screen . Equally the Tyrion/Jaimie scene was masterful. Â I thought the change of pace, the existential absurdity of the beetles monologue, the chemistry between two brothers remembering shared moments of their childhood together and , as you point out, the structural emphasis it gives to the pointlessness of the 'Game' was excellent. Until you linked to the Arya laughing gif I hadn't consciously realized that this too was my overall reaction to Oberyn's heroic fail, Tyrion's predicament and ,of course, Arya's.
1180	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-04	I'm still really upset they haven't been showing the Eyrie in the opening credits
1181	Tyrion1991	2014-06-04	Okay, seriously, to all the reviewers still saying that "oh Dany made the right call on exiling Jorah".

â<U+0080><U+009C>Emotionally for me it was so intricate,â<U+0080><U+009D> Clarke says. â<U+0080><U+009C>Jorahâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been with me since day one, season one. The scene itself is unpleasant because I â<U+0080><U+0094> Emilia â<U+0080><U+0094> know that what Dany is doing is wrong, And it was the first time Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever felt that.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Â 
http://insidetv.ew.c...dany-ser-jorah/
Â 
Its a mistake, its all part of her downwards spiral into ADWD territory, which, of course, she will bounce back from. But its good to have your heroes actually put on the back foot and make mistakes. A lot of reviews I've seen act like Dany can do no wrong and every decision she takes is meant to be the right choice as she is a great ruler. No, that is not what HBO are doing.Â 
Â 
I honestly think that it is going to take caging the dragons for them to really start criticizing her and get what HBO has been trying to hammer into people the whole season.

1182	The Reader Lisa	2014-06-04	Does anyone else think they are leaving out the Eyrie in the Intro because it doesn't look anything like
it did in Season 1? And is so completely pussy to what it is supposed to be in the book? Also, enough
with the guys standing in a line on either side of the ravine! Is this supposed to be crack security? What
are they going to do, pee on you? And why does the Eyrie did this crack security since apparently any
two people can just wander up to the Bloody Gate unmolested by the Mountain tribes. I know Shagga
(remember Shagga?) stayed in the Kingswood after the Blackwater but Timmett and the others came
back (with their good steel) and were making life difficult for the Vale. But since we don't seem to have
mountains anymore the mountain tribes didn't recognize their homeland and went elsewhere, Or they
couldn't find it on the map.

1189	Gladiator of Dorne	2014-06-04	Making my first comment here on the forums. Long-time lurker, first-time poster.
Â 
I felt the Red Viper/Mountain duel, in the end, delivered the thrill of the fight and suspense of Oberyn nearly winning and then losing in such horrific fasion. I was watching with my father and he jumped up when the Mountain went down for the count, so in that way I feel it lived up to the books in making you believe that the Mountain isÂ finally going to meet justice. Then, just like that, the energy left the room as Gregor pulled Oberyn in and finished him off. Tyrion was sentenced to death, and I felt it got the emotions it needed to get.
Â 
That being said, I feel the fight suffered from the new Mountain's lack of acting ability and the episode suffered from a lack of build-up for a fight that the episode itself was named after. As to the new Mountain, sure he was massive, but I think we can all agree that the guy they had from Season 1 would have made this scene a fight worthy of the hype. A lot of the dialogue and motions just felt clumsy and absent of that blind-rage we saw from the Mountain in Season 1. In a later interview whereÂ Conan StevensÂ spoke on Clegane, he seemed to have as good a grasp as you could get on such a violent, brutish character. A shame he couldn't come back for Season 4, but alas, we were left with what we witnessed Sunday.
Â 
I think Pascal carried the fight well enough to make it a memorable fight-scene all-in-all though. He really nailed it this season, capturing the essence of our beloved Red Viper and delivering that swaggering bravado to Game of Thrones fans each and every week. He shall be missed.

Yeah but n the book I don't get the feeling that Tywin was that averse to passing of the rock to his siblings, he was more about the Lannister clan than just his own progeny.
In the show they have to make it about his children because the rest of the clan doesn't really exist.

Arya is clearly laughing at the hounds for never being able to get is ramsom and get rid of her, shes laughing at his miseries.
As for Sansa I remember Cercei telling her that a women has different weapons than men: tears and her cunt. I think shes playing the second one on baelish but for what purpose?..


There's an interview on another site that has Maisie saying as much. Not so much of the "going dark" doom and gloom folks are saying round here. More so that she's finally able to laugh at something and that something is that the hound just saw the light at the end of his tunnel go out.

Yep, that was my reading of it too.Â  In fact, Arya is looking at the Hound most of the time she's laughing.Â  She's laughing at him and his failed attempts to ransom her.Â  I thought the scene was hilarious.Â  One of my favorites. Poor Hound, can't catch a break.Â

1204	SpaA<U+009F>vogel	2014-06-05	I thought the cousin Lannister speech dragged on way too long...same with the Grey Worm/Missendei scene.Â  That was 20 minutes of the episode right there.
1205	Penguin king	2014-06-05	I have another example of the show dumbing down the story.Â  On the map that Jorah is looking at near :30 into the episode it completely omits Slaver's Bay, Valryia, and the west coast of Essos.Â  It shows Meereen directly across the Narrow Sea from King's Landing.Â  Part of the reason for Dany being stuck in Meereen is because of the vast distance back to Westeros.Â  She doesn't have the ships to go by sea and can't risk the long march on the Demon Road.Â  Again, are we too dumb to be able to comprehendÂ distances or a sense of a large world?


Â 
Â 


But seriously, what did they do with the map? Why is the world so small?


Â 
Â 
Yeah that had me scratching my head as i watched the episode.Â  This still explains it though. Looks like it was just a case of one map resting on top of another.Â  Map of Westeros on top of a larger map of Essos.

1206	Grail King	2014-06-05	Cat, Tyrion, Bronn & Co, came up to the Bloody Gate. Littlefinger & Sansa came up to the Bloody Gate. Arya and the Hound came up to
the Bloody Gate. So, how can it be from a different angle? Does it move like Greywater Watch? Somewhere in all the discussion of this
episode I just saw Cat's arrival there along side that ofÂ  Sansa's. I'm sorry, but to me it looks quite different. And we still have the problem
of people now being able to hike through the Vale untroubled by mountain tribes whereas Cat lost over half her group.
Â 
Oh, and please stop trying to explain Sansa's outfit as an Arryn thing. The Arryn sigil is a white falcon on a sky blue background. There
are no falcons that color. They can only be crow or raven feathers. And why would Sansa be decked out as an Arryn anyway? She's
supposed to be some connection of Littlefinger's. And mockingbirds (my state bird) are grey with white markings.Â  Yes, this is fantasy
Westeros, not Texas, but as far as I remember only crows and ravens are black. Cersei and Tyrion use a common proverb, something like
the crow calling the raven black,Â  in one of their arguments. That outfit is not mourning, Arryn or Mockingbird. It's OTT.Â  Â 


The Australian Black Falcon would disagree with you.Â
1207	Grail King	2014-06-05	I think symbolically it a statement that Sansa joined the liars club ( player ) Old Nan's words to Bran were all crows ( Ravens) are liars.Â
1208	rmholt	2014-06-05	Â 
Â 
How exactly? In the books Arya was killing in cold blood as early as Harrenhall.Â Â  What has show Arya done since then to make her character seem much darker?

I was a little surprised when Maisue Wlilliams said that about her character this season but dang she's right
1209	Wolf in the Knight	2014-06-05	I didn't see this posted but thought it was interesting.Â  Here's a clip of the Mountain dead lifting 994 pounds.Â  That's a strong man...

1212	Penguin king	2014-06-06	Â 
You can clearly see how dark a road she is going down. Look at how she killed the guy in the pub with Needle, and the other guy who said what he was going to do to her with her own sword (Rorge).Â  She didn't bat an eyelash.Â  Also what she did to those idiots who were laughing about her brother's murder and mutilation around the fire.Â 
Â 
I honestly love to see her go down this dark path. Westeros is long overdue for a character like her: some kind of dark avenger, which she is slowly becoming through ADWD. Like I said before, she is basically becoming Jaqen H'Ghar in female form. And to me, that's pretty damn cool. I'm rooting for her!


Â 
Â

Â 
Â 
Don't get me wrong. Arya's certainly on a dark path, but in no way is it any darker than the one she's beenÂ  treading in the books. If anything the fact that book arya is a lot younger serves to make her story all the more disturbing.
1213	Fool of a Book	2014-06-06	I kind of understand Sansa's dress as symbolic of a dark turn, and all the bird imagery, but I don't get her necklace. Â 
Â 
Sort of looks like a stylized moon? Â And the long chain, ok, a symbol of being a prisoner maybe. Â But she holds the end of the chain herself, so she's in charge, Â I dunno.
Â 
But what is the long silver tube like thing at the end of the chain? Â The Hound conveniently reminds us that poison is a woman's weapon. Â 
Â 
It's not a pen. Â I don't think it's a whistle. Â Certainly not just decorative.

I agree. I just didn't really see it until that interview.
1215	RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon	2014-06-06	I did try to make a new topic about this, looks like it wasnt approved but is Robin being merged with Harry the Heir?
1216	Farwynds Oceanseer	2014-06-07	It's too bad Tyrion's beetle-crushing soliloquy was so verbose; at half the length, with a clearer grounding in Tyrion's point of view, it could have been an other Emmy moment. Instead it came across as the work of a promising but unpolished student in a creative writing class. When you make a near miss while attempting literature, you come off as pretentious.
Â 
I noticed Tyrion punctuated his mystification overÂ Orson's beetle-crushing by letting a bug escape from his grasp--the point being, I suppose, that even if he used to laugh at Orson, he no longer sees any appeal in crushing crippled or broken things. Anyone want to bet that he steps on a beetle shortly after hearing the truth about Tysha?
1217	ground_control	2014-06-07	Â 
i see where your coming from...definitely agree would be too weird to see Tywin on the shitter...but the point of it was that was a humiliating death, dead whore on the bed on top of the fact that it was his own son killing him....so im okay with some change, but not too drastic...perhaps still in the bathroom, but washing hands or something...
Â 
after the crossbow, he might land on the shitter or something...or skip that part, long as he dies in the bathroom with Shae dead on the bed and Tyrion kills him, i'm okay with it...if dagger/sword instead of crossbow, or just dead body drops on the bathroom floor...

Â 
The message was perfectly fine. Tyrion not finishing the story is part of the point - that he still hasn't discovered the answer. One possible interpretation: He feels like people are just playthings for the cruel whims of the gods. Did we need it spelled out for us in aÂ "this is what it means" package?Â

I thought it was a great moment between Tyrion and Jamie.

Â 
Apparently we did need to have it spelled out, since it took 4 minutes to present this oh so deep message.
Â 
I look forward to scenes Jaime, but as soon as this one started I thought "Again? Another cell scene with Tyrion and Jaime?".Â  I would have preferred to see how Tywin, Cersei or the rest of court reacted to the stepping in of Oberyn as champion. Maybe hearing them speculate about the political consequence if Dorne loses his prince...

Who knows what D&D wanted to say? That said, I think there's more to it - illustrated by Jaime trying that interpretation and Tyrion shrugging it off.
Tyrion  has an insatiable curiosity and is smart but perhaps he's saying some things he just can't figure out and that's frightening.  He will never see or understand some things that define some people. He can see some puzzles have answers that he will not be able to find.

1225	jacob_stark	2014-06-08	I presume I'm super late on this, but they've pushed the Theon story so far in the show that they can't possibly continue before SEVERAL story lines catch up (are they gonna do at least some kind of fake Arya???) so I wonder if they're just shoving Theon and the Boltons into Winterfell for a while until all the other story lines catch up, which is well into what would be book five. And if they're pacing continues to slow, that could be a while.Â
1226	milkofthepoppy	2014-06-09	Gee, I just think that instead of inventing a Lannnister cousin in order to drag out that "and some people are cruel and never make sense" idea, they could've spoken more about Aerys, and given the unsullied some insight into Targaryen history.
1227	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-08-03	I kind of wish sansa hadn't become darth sansa. I get it, she's maturing and everything, but is she going to become evil? I hope to god it isn't foreshadowing.

1230	Jslay427	2014-06-01	I'm still up in the air about the episode as a whole. The duel was amazing tho. Gregor did a very good job. Better then what I expected. Sounded like they had someone fill in for his voice though.
1231	Linda	2014-06-01	So much was wrong with that episode, not the least the key part, the duel. They thought they knew better - again - and they fucked it up. That's a 2 for me, lowest since the House of the Undying atrocity.
1232	A Man Reads	2014-06-01	Wow. I gave it a 10/10.
Â 
The trial by combat was very well handled. There were five minutes left before they reached it. But I needn't have worried. They didn't hold back either.
Â 
Sansa's changes should simplify her story. The return of the Boltons was well done as well. Very much a parallel of the "Kingsroad" episode back in season 1.
Â 
No idea about the whole beetles speech yet. But the good heavily outweighed the bad throughout the episode.
Â 
I thought it was a great episode. That means the season is nearly through, however.

1233	C0bR	2014-06-01	I'll give it 9 because I was laughing uncontrollably the entire way, Sansa pleasantly surprised me, the duel was cool, Oberyn's death was nicely graphic and bonus point for naked Missandei.
1234	Corvinus	2014-06-01	8 because of some great acting, but the plot was bit underwhelming. The duel was great, but the build up to it not so much. I would have wanted something else other than the stupid beetle story. Maybe after finally revealing Oberyn's nickname, they could have explained why he was named thus. Also they omitted the detail about the spear
1235	Jslay427	2014-06-01	Linda, I have to agree. What did you think about the Theon story line? I though that was pretty decent.
1236	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-06-01	I loved it! Thought the fight scene was phenomenal. 10/10
1237	WexPyke	2014-06-01	7
The duel was great, but not the rest.Â  Why is Tyrion talking about beetles? Why are we spending time developing a new storyline with Mel and Greyworm?Â  Why do these episodes always end early? There is so much to cover and instead of covering we are doing this?
Â 
I am tiring of the show, I think D and D are missing it, and getting worse.
1238	franko99	2014-06-01	9 great episode, but some scenes/storylines could have been done better.
Â 
Too much time wasted on beetles and grey worm/missandei.Â 
Â 
The Arya/Hound scene feel ended a bit weird. And Moat Cailin was rushed IMO.Â 
Â 
Anyways the duel and the Eyrie makes this episode for me. Better than I expectedÂ Â  Â

1239	Konradsmith	2014-06-01	A solid ten. The duel ended as gruesomely and gut-wrenchingly as in ASOS. Emilia really pulled off the banishment and Sophie rocked her trial scene. Roose has returned and that is worth celebration in itself.
Â 
Also. NATHALIE EMMANUEL.

Â The beetles were a metaphor for human self destruction. Wars and murder. We are the 'moron' who can't stop destroying ourselves. I thought it was apt at this point in the show.
Â  I give this episode an 8 overall. We moved the plot forward nicely with Jorah's excommunication and Oberyn's death. I agree I am a bit confused about why we are spending so much time on Greyworm, but there may be a justified reason, I'm not counting that as a negative yet.
Â
1243	Ran	2014-06-01	Wrestled with the score for this one, and I've decided that I'm just going to go all in with it -- it's a 6 for me. That's the third episode I've rated a 6 across the whole series.
Â 
Why? Littlefinger, the man without a plan, dimishing the character yet further, and needlessly. Dark Queen Sansa, so ham-fisted. Arya's reveal, and the sinking feeling that the next time we see the Hound and Arya they'll be trudging back down the high road unmolested with no one think that maybe they should inform Robin Arryn or Petyr Baelish. The endless Orson speech. The heartfelt promise that he wouldn't die, telegraphing that he was indeed going to die. The horribly frenetic editing of the fight scene, the direction choices that left it impersonal, the choreography that necessitated so much stunt double work which meant less intimate scenes and poor pacing. It just was not good at all. For what should have been the most memorable fight scene in the novels, they turned in something that was, frankly, forgettable up to the final moment.
Â 
The good stuff: the attack on Mole's Town, the Missandei-Grey Worm material, the Sansa and Littlefinger dialog after she revealed herself to the Vale lords, Moat Cailin, Pedro Pascal's performance.
1244	JonDunn	2014-06-01	God that was the best episode of the season!Â 
Â 
I find myself saying that a lot this year.
1245	WexPyke	2014-06-01	This show is about butchery and not subtlety.  Agree on what Tyrions story was and it fits the books but it does not fit the show.
1246	FNF	2014-06-01	8/10
Â 
The fight was pretty much a 1:1 copy from the books. Maybe a little abridged, but that is TV. The guy who played the Mountain was actually pretty decent (if he spoke the lines.) I'm going to miss Pedro so much.
Â 
Sansa scenes very good and I prefer this change. They might still bring in Harry the Heir when Petyr decides Robin is fucked regardless.
Â 
Theon scenes were okay. Really gutted about there being no mention of Vic etc, although I won't mind if the King's moot is cut.
Â 
Dany scene and Grey Worm x Missandei were meh to bleh. A little meaningless and Emilia's acting was mediocre. Jorah and Barristan were good though...
1247	Alex21	2014-06-01	This has been a shocking episode, my dear... Oberyn's death was too much for me... the Mountain... he... But I like it and I want to know the future of the Hound and what is going to happen with Arya now, I mean she is at the Eyrie, and that did not happened in the books
1248	Fez	2014-06-01	8/10
Â 
And that's mostly because of the duel. The rest of the episode was pretty underwhelming. I liked Arya laughing, Tyrion's speech (meta tip: Orson is GRRM and the beetles are the characters), and the Vale stuff. And there was nothing wrong with Theon/Boltons. But the rest was way too dull and filler-y. I legit could not stand the Missiandei/Grey Worm stuff (which was goddamn endless), Jorah's exile did not seem well-handled, the check-in at the Wall was okay but pointless, same with the attack on Mole's Town.Â 
Â 
Usually when I glance up at the clock and see that its (roughly) 9:30, I think "wow, how is it only 9:30? So much has happened!" this time I thought "wow, how is it already 9:30? There's been nothing going on"
1249	Juan_Snow	2014-06-01	I feel sorry for the complainers.  That was probably the best episode of the season. The duel was fantastic. They nailed it. 10/10
1250	Carey Snow	2014-06-01	The fight was great. I actually enjoy the Grey Wom/Messindei story line. It fleshes those characters out. Not sure how I feel about the Sansa changes. Maybe she is going to be a lot darker than I thought. Theon's story was done well/
Â 
Did not enjoy the beetle speech. So 7.5/10 for me, I will bump it to an 8.
1251	KingOfTheRock	2014-06-01	The fight was amazing (Even though I had to look away at the end.) I loved the Sansa changes. That moment when Theon started muttering Reek over and over again then the guy getting an axe in the head was good. Arya laughing hysterically was funny.
Â 
The Grey Worm parts were kinda terrible IMO.
Â 
So....8.5/10
1252	Pure Guava	2014-06-01	9/10

1253	Howling Mad	2014-06-01	Ran I also rated this episode a 6 and agree with most of your assessment except the Grey Worm - Missandei scenes. Grey Worm is both unsullied and a eunuch. Only in the PC world of HBO would D&D create a sexual tension where none should never exist.

What's PC about that again? Seems like a really weird place to bring up PC.
1255	Timett sonof Timett is God	2014-06-01	a solid 9.
1256	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-01	10/10 some really amazing shots in this, the acting was pretty solid throughout. Â Brilliant re-writing of Sansa and that shot of Winterfell ruined really brought a ton of emotion imo.Â
1257	KalibakCruel	2014-06-01	9 or 8 just because I don't care for the budding grey worm relationship aspect, though maybe 10 because Missendei is smoking.
It was a great episode, and it's FUN to be surprised and not follow the book exactly. Plus I'm liking this Sansa a lot more than her book counter part already. She's interesting. I feel like book purists are giving it a low score. I mean if you didn't like this episode what are you watching for? There's only going to be more deviations and spoilers ahead.

It must suck to always be disappointed. Â 
Â 
This was such a good episode. Â Great reactions all over the net from Sullied and Unsullied both.Â

There are Unsullied who go to whore houses just to cuddle in the books. Is it really that different with Missandei and Grey Worm? Not saying I like their story but saying it's wholly D&D's fault is stupid.
1260	K-26dp	2014-06-01	Are we rating these shows compared to the books or compared to other TV shows?
Â 
People giving it 1-5 are being ridiculous.


Â 
There are no rules but the ones you make.Â 
Â 
I rated 9/10, thought the duel was well-acted, well choreographed, and well-written. Ian Glen, Maise Williams, Roy McCann, Sophie Turner, andÂ Nathalie Emmanuel were terrific, even the beetle speech is growing on me the more I think about it. There are nits to pick as always, but it was a fantastic hour of television.
1261	zJordan	2014-06-01	I thought the outcome of that duel was worse than the Red Wedding, it genuinely was hard for me to watch and I thought the Red Wedding wasn't as bad as people say it was.
Â 
By worse I mean hard to watch... I knew it was coming but I thought somehow... it can be quick.

					
					
							Edited by zJordan, 01 June 2014 - 10:05 PM.
1262	Ran	2014-06-01	They have likely changed the Unsullied to not be entirely cut, I'm guessing. And Farinelli seemed to do all right with his love life despite being the most famous castrato singer of his age, so... yeah, we'll see how they go with it, but I don't mind a romance, even if it might be essentially platonic.
1263	ohpooratlas	2014-06-01	My highest rated episode of the season. I gave it a 9. There were so many fantastically acted scenes (Alifie Allen as Theon/Reek, Jorah's banishment, Sansa during the trial and the END omg.)
Â 
The beetle monologue was just wtf though?
Â 
Missendei and Greyworm are very endearing, but again ... it would have been nice if they used that time to build up the actual TITLE of the episode.Â
1264	Dornish Hen	2014-06-01	I began crying just as the fight began, and finished the episode bawling my eyes out!!  I thought the fight was gut wrenching and so sad, but the rest of the episode was very strange. Sana's story had changed so much from the book, that I thought Oberyn might actually win the fight!  For a second...
1265	Dirk blitzen	2014-06-01	Gave it 9.
I loved all the plotlines this episode.  The writing was top notch for D&D (the rest of their episodes this season were mediocre for me).  I agree with ran regarding the editing of the fight scene, but it still was effective.
No idea why people are complaining about the beetle speech.  Feels like to me that people were just mad that it replaced the oberyn/Tyrion scene with the poisoned spear.  The speech had humor, pathos, and a great fucking metaphor.
Also to the poisoned spear not being mentioned...  It was set up with the hound/arya scene and will obviously pay off in episode 10.  I think the show did it better then the book honestly.  Knowing the spear was poisoned before the fight began always took out all investment for me... Cause either way the mountain would die.  Boring.
Sansas acting was top notch.  Sophie turners acting as Sansa acting was also top notch 
It was only a 9 out of 10 cause the whole jorah pardon strained credibility for me.

1266	Gvn2Fly	2014-06-01	I voted a 7, but I debated giving it a 6. Â The fight was amazing, but there were other parts of this episode I didn't care for. FYI - I am not a book reader. I was not interested in the Grey Worm romance, the Bolton stuff was kind of dull, and the Beetle story went on too long with no payoff. Â The Jorah banishment felt rushed. Â As far as Dany knows, Jorah was still spying on her because he made no mention of ever stopping. Â Even it would have made no difference, I would have rather seen him try to defend himself than one of the Grey Worm scenes. Â I really expected better.
1267	Brother Walfrid	2014-06-01	gave it a 6
Â 
Â 
would have been an 8, but for that interminable Tyrion and Jaime scene.
1268	Haymaker	2014-06-01	After some thought, going with an 8/10.
Â 
The duel was fantastic and had me litterally at the edge of my seat.Â  I think they pulled it off perfectly.Â  Can't quite get that image of Oberyn's smushed head out of my mind.Â  The Sansa stuff was handled well too.Â  The only things lowering my score are the Grey Worm/Missandei scenes which just totally took me out of it, and the Tyrion Beetle speech.Â  I ususally love any extra Tyrion stuff, but the story dragged on and had me looking at the time.
1269	Sarah1128	2014-06-01	10/10! Sad to see Oberyn go  however that was the most entertaining scene so far this season...!
1270	tyrell19	2014-06-01	Loved the episode. Sansa and Theons stories felt like they were wrapping up for the season so I wonder if they'll feature in the finale.
1271	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-01	1/10. The worst episode of the series so far.
1272	SweetJeyne	2014-06-01	10/10
This was my favorite episode of the season, and I thought it built up nicely the slam-dunk ending. I liked the shading in of Sansa's character and her growing adroitness at playing the game, as well as the subtle hints that she's knowingly using Littlefinger's attraction to her, and possibly, reciprocates it.
Â 
I actually kinda like the Missandei/Grey Worm subplot, in large part because both actors are gorgeous. I'm glad they aged-up Missandei.
Â 
The fight was possibly the best fight ever on the show, though I'm heartbroken we won't see Pedro Pascal again. And the look on Ellaria's face when her beloved Prince of Dorne dies was also heart-breaking. Theirs is one of Westeros's few enduring loves, and I really believed their passion for and devotion to each other, as well as Ellaria's absolute faith in Oberyn.

1273	jarl the climber	2014-06-01	I gave in an 8. I agree that the scene with Arya did not really make sense, Robin Arynn is her cousin, there is no way that she is not let into the Vale. At the very least a message would be sent to determine what should be done and in the meantime she is going no where. Now I could see them not believing that she is Arya but this guy at least acted like he bought it so it doesn't work. I think I can see where they are going with it and I think it could have been handled better. Sansa's stuff was more good than bad but it was a little mixed. Nothing else really stands out to me right now. I'm interested about Lindas exact criticism and why she rated it so low. Its not perfect episode, certainly its not great as an adaptation but from what I have seen the more casual fans, who have not read the books, found this episode very enjoyable.
1274	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-01	Pretty good episode, Oberyn carried it with his performance, the Bolton now Bolton scene was cool,  don't care for the grey worm love angle, what's that about, and the modifications in Sansa's arc are intriguing.  Overall it was a good episode, oh missed the dude getting chopped up during the duel, and wow Clegane squished his head like a grape.
1275	Miss_Targ	2014-06-01	On a first watch nothing is going to be exactly as we've envisioned it. 10/10. This is tv at its best. Amazing acting. Just rewatched the second half of the episodde. I actually loved the beetle speech, and the fight was amazing. Thank you Pedro for making Oberyn even better than I could have imagined!
1276	Bluecore	2014-06-01	This was a good episode. As a reason it had the potential to be even better than the others, if they weren't making up so much filler folly.Â 
Â 
The duel was executed just as the trial was: perfectly.
Â 
As someone not too far back said, the image of the Mountain killing Oberyn will not leave my head. It was one of the most grisly, grotesque things I've ever seen on film. Ellaria's reaction just completely sold it too, and made it so much worse. I'll be hard pressed to get that image out of my head for a while.Â 
Â 
EDIT: I almost forgot about the most important part! I have been waiting for Missandei's clothes to come off since her first scene, and I was not disappointed. She is such a sexy, beautiful woman.Â

1277	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-01	9.
1278	Batavian	2014-06-01	10. Loved every minute of it.
1279	Nictarion	2014-06-01	7. I didn't care for a lot of this episode tbh. The Tyrion beetle scene was downright awful. The Vale was ok, the North was ok, I did enjoy the fight though. Oberyn looked pretty cool sliding and spinning around. I also liked all the Meereen scenes, especially Jorah's exile, and Missandei Â  Â Â
1280	Ice_Specter	2014-06-01	Wrestled with the score for this one, and I've decided that I'm just going to go all in with it -- it's a 6 for me. That's the third episode I've rated a 6 across the whole series.
Â 
Why? Littlefinger, the man without a plan, dimishing the character yet further, and needlessly. Dark Queen Sansa, so ham-fisted. Arya's reveal, and the sinking feeling that the next time we see the Hound and Arya they'll be trudging back down the high road unmolested with no one think that maybe they should inform Robin Arryn or Petyr Baelish. The endless Orson speech. The heartfelt promise that he wouldn't die, telegraphing that he was indeed going to die. The horribly frenetic editing of the fight scene, the direction choices that left it impersonal, the choreography that necessitated so much stunt double work which meant less intimate scenes and poor pacing. It just was not good at all. For what should have been the most memorable fight scene in the novels, they turned in something that was, frankly, forgettable up to the final moment.
Â 
The good stuff: the attack on Mole's Town, the Missandei-Grey Worm material, the Sansa and Littlefinger dialog after she revealed herself to the Vale lords, Moat Cailin, Pedro Pascal's performance.


Â 
Agree
1281	Ser Not Appearing	2014-06-01	So much naturally begins to feel rushed with this many storylines in play overall and in a single episode. I don't mind that, except when they add unnecessary stuff that i view as lacking of added value... like Missandei/Grey Worm.
Don't add any of the stuff you had to cut from the books, just cut that story line and flesh out other parts of the episode and it'll improve the product.
Good and bad in the fight scene but I expected that. Satisfied with the ending but still...
This episode was a microcosm of my overall feel which is that the show is good but I always feel it could be better. It's a solid adaptation and one I'm very happy exists. I look forward to it every week. The source material is so good, though, and so much of this show is pure success that it makes the misses that much more of a let down.

1282	KalibakCruel	2014-06-01	I think I'm going to bump top a 10 because if Missendei, I'm going to rewatch that scene, and not on a pervy way, but in an appreciating aesthetic beauty way.
1283	tallTale	2014-06-01	I gave it a nine. Solid the whole episode.
Â 
Really thought the duel was done perfectly.Â
1284	Darth Pipes	2014-06-01	10.Â  While it had baffling stuff like the LONG beetle speech, the other stuff (the duel, the Eryie, Ser Jorah, and Moat Cailin) was great.
1285	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-01	I think I'm going to bump top a 10 because if Missendei, I'm going to rewatch that scene, and not on a pervy way, but in an appreciating aesthetic beauty way.

She is pretty damned gorgeous, you know... In an aesthetic beauty.... Oh Screw it, the woman is smoking hot.
1286	KalibakCruel	2014-06-01	She is pretty damned gorgeous, you know... In an aesthetic beauty.... Oh Screw it, the woman is smoking hot.

I think I have a broken gland, I can't stop drooling
1287	The Dragon has three heads	2014-06-01	They're bringing in grey worm/missendei thing so when the harpy kills him we have a connection to him.
She has no brother in the show and there's going to need to be some stakes to make Danny's season 5 exciting.
So, death to grey worm.
1288	FlyRobinFly	2014-06-01	Beetle story was amazing. One of my favorite moments on the show.
1289	Tanda's Lintrum	2014-06-01	Really a 9, but I gave it a 10 to cancel out some of the two tantrums votes.
1290	boojam	2014-06-01	Seemed to me the Moat Cailin stuff was just a straight forward rework of the book.It did see odd that someone guarding the Bloody Gate would not know who Arya Stark was!Still did not seem all that bad, I guess they just walked away!(How did they get through the Vale without someone at least noticing the Hound?)(Did not bother me.)The new re=interpreted Sansa arrives , I like this, nope did not seem ham fisted to me.She has picked up some Machiavellian traits from KL and LF , good!!!!I look forward to this change in Sansa , LF dos not have a plan, did not seem that way to me, just more focus on Sansa this episode.Orson and beetles , well D and D like to do a existential riff now and then, I don't mind, thought for a second there ... going to be an homage to Kubrick and Paths of Glory.Mole's town turned out to what I said "a wildling can sniff out another wildling"... Mole's Town seem to go totally unwarned... was that in the books.Red Viper is mentioned only ONCE during the season!? Maybe again next week?Actually seems , from book canon, Jamie did know Oberyn capabilities , oddly left out.The poison on the spear thing was only vaguely hinted in one shot.AS for the fight , well they painted them self into a corner, right down a nub of time left, I have the feeling a lot of 'footage' was edited down.I DID NOT ,as I thought was going to happen like the chop sockey Wushu , they should of hired Zhang Yimou or Ang Lee's stunt director who did 1000 times better martial arts stuff than that, this was almost junky Jackie Chan... tho not that bad.I was expecting it NOT to be elaborated , not enough time, one of this shows running curses!Missandei-Grey Worm material, needed, too munch Dany closed looping in ADWD.I gave it a 10 but am going to back it down to a 9. (The strangeness at the Bloody Gate was 'strange')(I had a problem with the results of the fight in the book... and am still unsatisfied with it to this day.)

1291	Dornish Hen	2014-06-01	Although the beetle speech was interesting, I couldn't pay attention to most of the speech. Â I kept checking the clock wondering when the fight would begin. Â The Purple Wedding was about 20 minutes or so, and I thought that the fight should have had at least more set up time. Â Maybe some people in King's Landing could have been whispering about using poison? Â I did notice Oberyn's squire "polishing" the spear head. Â

1292	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-01	8 out of 10
LOVED:
The new and improved Sansa
The fight at Mole Town
The Duel
Jaime and Tyrion being brothers
Arya Laughter: another relative bites the dust
Â 
MEH:
Theon/Reek and the Snow/Bolton band. Saved by the shot of ruined Winterfell
The Lords Declarant.Â 
Grey Worm and Missandei - GW himself made the comment previously that having no "pillar and the stones" didn't prevent him from loving in his heart
Â 
Disliked:
The beetle story. It was a good story but about a minute and a half too long
Flayed men. It's so out of fashion
Â 
I will probably have nightmares about the ending, but I wish Tyrion had thrown up. I certainly wanted to. Cannot believe there are only two more episodes this season.Â
1293	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-01	I kinda laughed at something Oberyn and Tyrion said, "on his back, size doesn't matter", "thank goodness".
Â 
Come on!
1294	TheHouseHB	2014-06-01	Loved the episode gave it a ten just for the Mountain vs the Viper and finally the Jorah reveal to Dany.
1295	KalibakCruel	2014-06-01	I kinda laughed at something Oberyn and Tyrion said, "on his back, size doesn't matter", "thank goodness".
Â 
Come on! 

I thought no one else picked up on that
1296	Died a Hero	2014-06-01	9/10
Â 
The haters are in full force tonight. Sansa's changes are great. They're a bit fast forwarded, but all and all they drive the point home. The Theon parts were tragicly amazing. The raid at Mole's Town was spot on, and the reaction at the wall was just as good. Ayra's laugh was heart wrenching. Though, how will they explain away that they sent the fucking Hound and the second to last living Stark down the road? Dany's stuff was great as always, and Missendei was gorgeous. The fight was AMAZING! It looked just like I imagined. I'm guessing that they'll explain the posion next week when the moutain's health takes a turn for the worse. The only thing that made this a 9 and not a 10 was not explaining how leathal The Red Viper was known to be. They had the chance with Jaime and Tyrion and muffed it. Outside of that, perfect episode.

1297	Hupo Storm	2014-06-01	I like how the duel synthesizes ASoIaF,ooooo tha gory death 
10/10Â
1298	Ser Not Appearing	2014-06-01	If there's one too-standard thing that GRRM did which bugs me, it's the Jorah dismissal. Betrayal in this sense is false. It's the exact opposite of reality.
Jorah knew Dany as a means to an end. His loyalty is to King Bob. He didn't betray her for King Bob. To the contrary, he betrayed King Bob for her. As far as Dany is concerned, he is her most loyal servant. He turned against potentially the most powerful man in the world for her. He turned away from the realization of his entire (recent) life's purpose for her. Not all men who follow her have been truly tested. He has... and he passed the test. More than that, his test was harder. He wasn't staying true to a woman he served, he was betraying his own King solely for her sake. That's a higher level of commitment.
I feel this failure of realistic interpretating events on Dany's part was magnified in the show, for whatever reason.
1299	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-01	D&D sullied the reputation of the unsullied.  Now they are just the sullied.
1300	Banner Without Brothers	2014-06-01	It did see odd that someone guarding the Bloody Gate would not know who Arya Stark was!
Still did not seem all that bad, I guess they just walked away!
(How did they get through the Vale without someone at least noticing the Hound?)
(Did not bother me.)
(The strangeness at the Bloody Gate was 'strange')
Â 


But the guy at the gate did know who she was? He'd never seen her before and she still looks like Arry the orphan but he knew who she claimed to be. We don't know yet what happened after Arya stopped laughing. Lets hope for a bit of explanation as to why they were not let in next week.
1301	hallam	2014-06-01	10
Â 
This is the episode when the producers told us they know what happens in book 6 and we don't. And don't think they are messing with the plots on their own. GRRM is part of the team and the series is a lot better edited than the books are.Â 
Â 
The most important part was the reveal on Sansa which is clearly a plotline that is from book 6. Sansa is not going to be Baelish's toy. Will she turn into Arya II or Cersei II though? This handling of Lyssa's murder is much better than the books.
Â 
In the books we only find out about the venom after the duel. So I think we will find out about that next episode. when the Mountain does not heal.
Â 
Having Arya arrive somewhere too late makes a lot more sense than the pointless meanderings of the book. It also takes her in the direction of the sea and on to Bravos. Much more logical than the books again.Â 
Â 
Next season the whole Sansa plot line will be new. And they will be drawing in part from Book 6. Meanwhile other parts are still finishing book 3. Looks to me like we are looking at more than 7 seasons... I would guess 9. And thats not counting the fact there are likely 9 books as well.
1302	Starkana	2014-06-01	Gave it a 3. No thank you 
I felt like the choreography of the fight scene was lame till the end. Idk. 
Then Tyrion's and Shae's reactions - god forbid we had more of that. Why the hell was that like 2.5 seconds?!
Also, I can't stand the GW & M shit. Seriously? Are we 12? Wondering if he has ze whole or half package? COME ON PEOPLE.
1303	Mr Smith	2014-06-01	A very impressive 9, literally inches away from a 10.
Â 
Everything in the Vale was outstanding. I know some people will complain that they're rushing Sansa's change, and muddling the character a bit, but I don't. That last scene with her coming down the stairs was one of the moments of the season.
Â 
Tyrion's beetle story was great.
Â 
Emilia Clarke handled Jorah's expulsion very well.
Â 
Not yet sure how I feel about the whole Grey Worm romance.
Â 
Dialogue still just leaves that little bit to be desired...
1304	Facelesss Fan	2014-06-01	9
It's about time Sansa started acting right.
1305	FalseKnight	2014-06-01	Really a 9, but I gave it a 10 to cancel out some of the two tantrums votes.

LOL
1306	KnowledgeIsPower	2014-06-01	Ran I also rated this episode a 6 and agree with most of your assessment except the Grey Worm - Missandei scenes. Grey Worm is both unsullied and a eunuch. Only in the PC world of HBO would D&D create a sexual tension where none should never exist.


Â 
^I feel that you are not putting yourself in Grey Worms shoes
Â 
I actually really enjoy Grey Worms parts. Â Just imagine all the things that he is feeling. Â He was a slave soldier essentially his entire life. Â He was never able to love someone let alone even given the chance to love someone. Â He is free now thanks to the great Dany Stormborn and is starting to actually FEEL things emotionally. Â Then when he learns that these feelings are pointless because of his lack of manhood, it must be really depressing. Â I think the scenes between Grey Worm and Missandei show a type of feeling that most would really find difficult to understand. Â I feel that is why a lot of people don't like these scenes.
1307	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-06-01	No poison on the end of the spear??? Although anyone catch littlefingers line "some people die hovering over their chamber pot"...but still no poison???? ...and i feel like they undersold oberyns nickname like they had so many times to mention it!...idk im still up in the air...


Not sure if somebody already mentioned this, but they did have the lingering camera shot of the guy with a cloth rubbing the spear. It could very easily be poison which we may find out in the next episode if the Mountain ends up slowly and painfully diting.
1308	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-06-01	Won't rate until after rewatch, but preliminary rating would be 5/10.
Â 
Worst episode of the season.
Â 
The Good:
Moat Cailin: Don't have any complaints. Alfie Allen is amazing, as usual.
Bolton Bonding: Lovely.
Sansa and the Lords: Cool.
Trial By Combat: The writing and cinematography was fantastic, as was the fight choreography. But, I felt the duel flew by too quickly - so many fast cuts and it should have lasted a bit longer. Great performance by Pascal and great ending.
Â 
The Meh:
Mole's Town and Jon With Friends: I really don't care for the Wall storyline at this point. It's been dragged out ad nauseam.
Jorah's discovery and banishment: Felt soul-less and lacked emotion.
Arya's LOL: Weirdly out of place, but I won't judge until they finish the storyline off in the season finale.
Littlefinger and the Lords: Not much to say.
Â 
The UGH:
Missandei and Grey Worm: Boring filler.
Tyrion and Jaime, in the cell, again: I GET IT, THEY'RE BROS. I DIDN'T NEED ANOTHER FIVE MINUTE SCENE TO TELL ME THAT, especially such a boring one.
Lady Sansa's new dress: WTF? So goddamn heavy-handed I couldn't believe it.
1309	shiola	2014-06-01	8/10. Â 7 in truth, but the duel bumps it up.
Â 
Dany's scene was really good this week. Â Been waiting for the banishment a long time now! Â And we got some Barristan swag.
Â 
Alfie is incredible as always. Â And Sophie knocked it out of the park! I don't mind the changes to her story yet.. Â we'll see where they lead. Â And I've come to terms with my hatred of TV Littlefinger so he hardly bothers me anymore
Â 
Jaime had some really good facial reactions throughout. Â And maybe I'm biased because I know what's coming, but

	Spoiler even when he smiles, it seems like he's hiding something from Tyrion... Â his smiles are so sad and we know why. Â Can't wait for the reveal

Â 
The duel was very well done. Â Very intense. Â 
Â 
I thought Tyrion's story fucking dragged on, though. Â And I really didn't appreciate him and Jaime bonding over mocking a mentally handicapped person. Â Tasteless and uncomfortable to watch.
Â
1310	averde	2014-06-01	7 for me. 
It was a decent episode that had all my friends texting and talking about the end but I had two problems with it. First, Sansa is making Littlefinger look like puddy in her hands, he doesn't even give off a hint of intelligence in his scenes and he's barely "trained" Sansa yet, it's just odd. Second, the duel didn't feel as epic as it should have, I wanted to see some kind of emotions on the faces in the crowd, give us a sad Bronn, a flicker of fear go across Tywins face with an Oberyn staring at him while questioning Gregor. Jaime smiled then frowned that was it.
1311	Ryuho Martell	2014-06-01	A 7 for me. Just because I liked a lot the combat.
But can't care less about Missandei / Grey Worm love story. They could use that air time to show more of Bran's story, ot some other story that actually matters.
And Sansa coming downstairs looking like Charlize Theron playing Ravenna??? WTH???
1312	darksellsword	2014-06-01	I was going to give this a 9 but because of all the ridiculous nitpicking had to defend its honor with a 10. It was a fantastic episode , some of the issues people had with this were my favourite bits. Missandei and greyworm scenes were very believable and heartbreaking. Emilia Clarke and Ian glen were superb just about everyone was right on the mark in this episode. The duel was perfectly shot and executed. for all the nay sayers on that one think about the scene if Pedro pascal wasn't playing Oberyn and if the 2nd actor cast as the mountain were to be in that scene, then you will have a true impression of just how great it was. The reaction shots were exactly what I was looking for because in the book it was precisely what we wanted to do ,spin our heads around to gage the reactions of all these characters so heavily invested in the outcome of this duel, for those disappointed that there wasn't more elaboration on the red viper nickname.I myself always thought it was rather unimpressive to learn that he gained that scary nickname only because people suspected he poisoned his blade. I am glad they left it out and I take it that the hounds comments on poisoning was a nod to the book readers.The beetle story Tyrion told was a great piece of writing and told well , It was clearly Tyrion lamenting his own existence and helplessness against the cruelty of others for any of you that didn't get that.It is rare that an episode doesn't leave me with something to complain about Â It was another good performance by Aiden gillen.

1313	Sand11751	2014-06-01	Solid 9 verging on a 10. I don't know what to make of Sansa, but I like it!!! The duel was what I expected. Arya and Sandor road trips forever! I LURVED the look on his face as she falls out laughing. Minus 1 point for wasting my time with that Tyrion / Jamie filler and WTF is up with Missendei and Grey Worm - enough already with the eunuch and servant googly eyed-love. I do love me some Grey Worm in the books, but this bit on TV is just stupid. Â
1314	ServantOnIce	2014-06-01	10/10
Â 
The first time I watched it I thought it was at best a 4 out of 10. But then I relaxed and realized it wasn't the books, nor my own understanding of the books but a fictional TV show.
Â 
Then I enjoyed it. There were weak moments such as Gilly being spared, Grey Worm and Missandrei but it worked for the TV show. Â Strong moments like the sexy, Sophie Turner now, Little Finger doesn't know what he has on his hands, the weakest thing was another, "Oh, no almost!" for Arya and Sansa but the talking scene was well acted. Some great moments between them.
Â 
The Duel was great, good dialogue as much of the books as you can keep. I still wondered, where was his helmet and where were their shields, didn't make sense. But the ending was true to form. No cutting in half with his sword, and Â Ser Gregor passed out after the end. Maybe they will leave, "Robert Strong" out of the TV show?
Â 
But for TV 10/10 they have had some solid episodes the last two seasons, with this season on path to be the best.
Â 
Enjoy it folks, this is one of the greatest shows, drama shows in TV history. Along with Â ER, The Sopranos, Dexter, maybe it is the best drama in TV history? Up there with Hill Street Blues? Â
1315	andrew_	2014-06-01	The only thing I disliked about this episode was the ridiculous love story between Missandei and Grey Worm, everything else was done well.
Â 
Thanks Pedro for a great performance as the Red Viper 
Â 
9/10
1316	Ruin	2014-06-01	Some of the added content was really hard to watch.Â  The duel was good...could've been longer w/o the beetle speech.Â  In fact, I wish they had a scene with Tywin raving about duel, acknowledging that it'll turnout bad for House Lannister no matter the outcome.Â  The scene with Littlefinger talking to the Vale Lords about whose left to contend with the Lannisters left it wide open for Tywin to now express the inevitable shitstorm that could errupt in Dorne.
Â 
The Bolton scene was great, Father and Son.Â  Theon was also really good.Â  I only wish we could've got a Victarion, or Euron namedrop/reference here.
Â 
Instead of all the really bad filler content, why not use the book material?Â  It's not that difficult.
1317	Viserion12	2014-06-01	6 or 7 for me.
Â 
I think it was the worst episode of the season, but still pretty decent. Â There was A LOT of filler dialogue that I hated, but the scenes that were good, were REALLY good. Â 
Â 
I think they just expedited Sansa's story because all of her time in the Vale was filler anyways. Â They don't want to bore people. Â I don't think they will get too far ahead in her story. Â It's not unheard of for them to leave a character out for multiple episodes in a row. Â We haven't seen Bran but a handful of times. Â I think Sansa will now be Alayne, but she will have the support of the Lords Declarant. Â I don't think that will change her story much. Â She will still go on to scheme with LF. Â I think LF will use SR until he either dies or is killed. Â Since it hasn't been written about much in the books, we don't know how important HTH is to the story. Â I could see the show replacing HTH with SR, but I could also see it going the way the book does. Â You never know.
Â 
I think Theon/Reek going to Moat Cailin was a great scene. Â True to the books, but once again hopping even further into AFFC/ADWD territory.
Â 
The scene in Moles Town is just prepping the battle at the wall, and making us think that the Night's Watch is hopeless. Â It's also showing us a softer side of Ygritte, which will make people feel extra bad for her in the next episode.
Â 
Obviously the best scene in the episode is the Trial by Combat. Â Without this scene, the episode is probably rated a 4 or 5. Â The duel was very true to the book. Â Down to the dialogue, movements, etc. Â A few things may have been changed here and there, but nothing major (I didn't mind the absence of vomit. Â I thought Tyrion's blank stare was perfect). Â It was excellent. Â I think it could have been a little longer, but what are you going to do. Â They decided to waste time on other BS scenes. Â All I know is that the duel had my heart racing, even thought I knew exactly what was going to happen. Â The end was surprisingly gory. Â I didn't think they would show that much blood. Â And his screams.......wow.....those were haunting.
Â 
I'm not 100% sure what the whole beetle scene was with Jaimie and Tyrion right before the duel. Â I don't remember that from the book, but I could be wrong. Â Someone please tell me if they have a better idea. Â It was just weird in my mind. Â I was waiting for some deep metaphor to come through, but I didn't see anything. Â Not even a thinly veiled metaphor.
1318	Needles Fury	2014-06-01	Loved it!!!
1319	yushkevitch	2014-06-02	So more people voted 10 than any other score?
Â 
I guess it's just as I've been saying all along: People fall so completely in love with a show they simply cannot be objective and some of the posts in this thread clearly verify this again. Even a few people pointed out several (and some more than several) major things they didn't like but still gave it a 9!
Â 
As for me, I gave it a 7.
Â 
Most of it was so-so as lots of time was spent on relatively unimportant side stories (that yes, do have bigger consequences down the road, but on their own, right now, yawn),
Â 
- Arya/Hound, brief but good as always.
- Sansa/Littlefinger was done well but again, not really gripping me in terms of the overall story.
- The duel was the best scene for me, I was surprised they made as brutal as they did but kudos for tackling it head-on (pun intended) but preceded by an over-long beetle story by Tyrion.
- Hey, have you heard Mance is probably moving on the Wall. I can imagine Unsullied viewers thinking "Yeah, but the White Walkers have been marching since S1 and they're not there yet either..."
- Dany/Jorah. Again, fine, but since we knew he was a spy already the scene lacked dramatic impact.
Â 
So a solid, unspectacular 7. I'm hoping the last few episodes really pick it up.
1320	kephv	2014-06-02	4/10
Â 
Gods that was an awful episode -- possibly the show's worst yet. One giant mishap that ended on a note of comedy. That fight, like most of the others on the show, was poorly handled and ended in something that looked like it came out of a cheep horror movie (the new Gregor actor is also terrible).
1321	IlAovatar	2014-06-02	7/10
Â 
Good:
Â 
- Loved the duel. The sudden and horrific nature of Oberyn's defeat in the books was a huge shock moment for me, and one (unlike the Red Wedding) which I didn't see coming, so i'm really glad they got it right in the show and didn't tone it down at all.
Â 
- The Sansa / Littlefinger scenes in the Vale were excellent.
Â 
- The Moat Cailin scene was great. Alfie Allen did a fantastic job of showing Reek almost falling apart while presenting himself as Theon Greyjoy in front of the Ironborn. The scene wouldn't have been anywhere near as compelling if he'd just strolled in and out of there confident with no signs at all of the frail, broken person behind the masquerade.
Â 
Â 
Bad:
Â 
- The love story between Grey Worm and Missandei is just awful. Pointless filler content that's probably going to drag on into the next two episodes.
Â 
- Arya and the Hound arriving in the Vale seemed like a pointless deviation to me, and the way Arya bursted out in laughter seemed so forced and random.
Â 
Â 
Indifferent:
Â 
- The attack on Mole's Town was forgettable.
Â 
- Not quite sure what to make of Tyrion and Jaime's conversation before the trial. I was waiting for some kind of point to the whole bug crushing story, but it never arrived. Perhaps the writers deliberately left it a mystery to get fans talking and coming up with crazy theories? Who knows.
Â 
- Jorah getting caught and banished was okay. Certainly not Emilia Clarke's worst performance this season.
Â 
Edit: Perhaps i'm being a bit generous giving the episode a 7/10 going by previous scores i've given this season. There was a lot of pointless filler content and bad deviations. I'm sure once i'm over the excitement of the duel scene the episode will probably seem more like a 6/10 to me.

1322	Starkfaithful85	2014-06-02	i didnt like  tyrions' pre fight scene with jaime and i thought that the stuff with grey worm and missandi was completely awful. also i thought that yelling arya stark's name in the vale was stupid...how hard would it e to say my lord i have some serious business to discuss...could I speak to you without so many people around
1323	Ser Jimmy of House McNulty	2014-06-02	I thought this episode was terrible.Â I'm not a book purist, I don't mind changes when changes are necessary. But half of this episode was made-up filler that made no sense and had me wanting to fast forward to the end to watch the duel. I'll get to the duel itself later.
Â 
I don't like that D&D are diminishing Littlefinger's evil genius factor. He knows what people are going to do before they do it. To me, the LF/Sansa dynamic is like a "student surpasses the teacher" vibe, and in the show they are just throwing that out and making Sansa become a player before she learns how.
Â 
The ENTIRE Meereen storyline is just hard to watch for me. Emilia Clarke has the same tone and emotion whenever she is on screen, whether it's ordering for mass crucifixion, telling Daario to fuck her, or banishing her most trusted advisor. Yuck.
Â 
The scene where the Hound just announces that his "traveling companion" is Arya Stark of Winterfell and nobody seems to give two shits about this had me scratching my head. I also don't like that they seem to be forming some sort of bond, which to me will ruin their final scene together.
Â 
The beetle speech. What the hell was that? I don't see the purpose of that scene. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. But I could have done without all of that.
Â 
And then there was the duel. One of the most pivotal moments in the whole series. It just felt rushed. The Mountains grunts and groans where making me laugh in a moment that should be very tense and serious. Oberyn's unnecessary jump/spin/twirl moves were just not doing it for me. I felt like they should have spent a little more time on this scene emphasizing Oberyn's skill and how he was toying with the Mountain.
Â 
Â 
Maybe I just can't enjoy the show because I love the books way too much. I don't know. But I feel like D&D had the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth, and they struck out swinging.Â
1324	The Drunkard	2014-06-02	6 or 7, pretty underwhelming.
Â 
Some Blizzard-tier character development with Sansa and Littlefinger. "Shit, we need to show how much more adept Sansa is becoming. Let's make LF derp his way through an interrogation and require Sansa to save his ass. That'll do it!"
1325	lostinwesteros	2014-06-02	I gave it a solid 10, unusual for me, and I also liked Dany's scenes, for once.   I know it doesn't further the plot, but I do really like the invention of the Missandei - Grey Worm scenes.
I thought the scene between Ramsey and Roose was well done, and glad we got a view of the North, with non-readers given a change to know how vast it is.  I liked that Ygritte spared Gilly, but I have no idea why they decided to introduce that business of Sam taking her there in the first place.  Took up valuable space.  I 'overlooked' the poor staging of the raid on Moletown.  
The Red Viper (and his stunt guy) was awesome, though I may never get the picture of his utterly smashed head out of my mind.
Liked Arya's hilarity when she discovered that Sandor couldn't "collect" from Lysa, either.
ETA:  didn't quite understand the why of the smashing beetle story.

1327	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-06-02	Times like this make me regret reading the books first. Imagine watching the dual without knowing the outcome? Also never knew the nature of the human race could be summed up with story about killing beetles
1328	Scrambled Aegon	2014-06-02	Probably gonna give it a 9/10 (keeping with my "Blackwater is so far above everything else that I can't give anything else the same score as it" thing.)
1329	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-02	9.5/10
Â 
Bonus points for Arya's perfect laugh and Missandei's boobs.
Â 
And fuck Barristan.
1330	Nordeast	2014-06-02	Ran I also rated this episode a 6 and agree with most of your assessment except the Grey Worm - Missandei scenes. Grey Worm is both unsullied and a eunuch. Only in the PC world of HBO would D&D create a sexual tension where none should never exist.


Â 
Well George had Unsullied cuddling with hookers in Mereen, so maybe you should rknow what you are reading.
1331	Jabberwocky106	2014-06-02	TO be honest I feel like the show has gotten progressively worse since the first season. This has to be one of the worse episodes I've ever seen. The Missandei Grey Worm romance? Totally useless. They put more time in that then they could have in the Moat Cailin scene which felt rushed. The fight at the end was god awfully made. Gregors voice was also wayyyy to low from what I imagined in the books. I imagined him screaming. The Daenerys scene bored me to tears. The Tyrion scene bored me to tears and was totally useless unless there's subtle meaning other then the bonding of Lannisters that I'm missing. Moles town bored me to tears. The only interesting scene was the Sansa-Lords of the Vale scene which was kind of spoiled by Sansa turning into Maleficent. I'm sure there's other things I'm forgetting considering the episode as a whole wasn't memorable. Giving it a 3.

1333	Unbowed Unbent Unhodor	2014-06-02	Favourite episode of the season so far, gave it a 9. I enjoyed everythingÂ butÂ I wasn't a fan of the beetle speech. That was just wasted time. I thought it was weird that dany was looking at nothing when talking to jorah, a little eye contact would of been nice, just reminded me of a blind person. I don't actually mind the missandei/ grey worm stuff but I wonder where they're taking it. Sansa scenes were awesome, shes really owning it this season. Her dress looks like something off the hunger games

Wow.
1335	A Man Reads	2014-06-02	I actually really enjoy Grey Worms parts. Â Just imagine all the things that he is feeling. Â He was a slave soldier essentially his entire life. Â He was never able to love someone let alone even given the chance to love someone. Â He is free now thanks to the great Dany Stormborn and is starting to actually FEEL things emotionally. Â Then when he learns that these feelings are pointless because of his lack of manhood, it must be really depressing. Â I think the scenes between Grey Worm and Missandei show a type of feeling that most would really find difficult to understand. Â I feel that is why a lot of people don't like these scenes.


 
Â 
I've come to enjoy the Grey Worm and Missandei scenes. Daenerys confronting slavery is a massive theme over the last few seasons and promises to remain so. And freedom from slavery is an immensely, overpoweringly personal experience. Look at what Grey Worm and Missandei have discussed in their scenes: their abductions; their initial enslavements; their memories before slavery; their gratitude to Daenerys. Both of them are struggling to being people once more after years of being property.Â 
Â 
Most fans cannot easily relate to their struggle. It's also not something popular audiences are used to seeing. Many posters are calling it a "romance," and while that element is there it is only a part of the Grey Worm/Missandei dynamic. We recognize the brash hero (Oberyn), the witty misunderstood rogue (Tyrion), the crazy queen (Cersei), the wandering swordsmen (The Hound and Arya), and the noble soldier (Jon). How former slaves live their lives after being freed doesn't fit the normal fantasy mold. But I think it makes a nice complement to the steady stream of violence, sex, and brutality of the show.

1336	Seneti	2014-06-02	9/10 - some of the earlier parts of the episode went on a little too long for my liking and I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get "mercy" this episode, but what was in there was really, really good.
1337	StrollofShame	2014-06-02	10. But I have to ask, all you folks feeling Sansa is too rushed...she's spent years now observing the likes of Cersei, Joff, Tywin AND Lf in Kings Landing, & you think, like her half-bro Jon, she should still know nothing? I admit this frustrated me about her in the books. She seems awfully s-l-o-w in comparison to her sibs, especially given the wicked examples she's had surrounding her. Her fairy tales have been shattered most cruelly for a long time now. About time she showed some of her Tully smarts!
1338	of man and wolf	2014-06-02	Grey Worm and Missandei are not nearly as important to the story as Ramsay, Theon, and Roose. They should have had all that time, and missandei and grey worm can get time whenever Dany is about. If we couldnt get some of Robbs bannermen on the show much like the greatjon and others, why should we get so much time with Dany's?
1339	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-02	10.

I'm actually glad they are speeding her arc up a bit.  Everything from Lysa's death to the boring ass trip down the mountain are just that, boring.  I firmly believe she is going to end up killing Littlefinger before it's all said and done, but knowing Martin, LF will end up killing Sansa.

Â 
Absolutely! Â I'm glad you feel the exact same way as me. Â I think that when Missandei says that she is glad that Grey Worm saw her was a really interesting line. Â It shows how much respect they have for each other. Â I can see a really strong relationship growing between them. Â I think this is a way of D&D showing a really strong felling of love towards with any sex involved. Â It shows love at the core. Â Almost like puppy love. Â Everyone know the feeling of having their first crush. Â There is no thought of anything but trying to understand them as a person and being around them. Â

Yes! "Having their first crush" is an excellent comparison. We're seeing adults struggle with their feelings, emotions, and relationships in a manner Â more Â commonly associated with teenagers today. Slavery and Grey Worm's castration are the reasons behind this arrested emotional development. I think it's great, but understand how it can throw viewers at first.
1342	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-02	If it means missandei is going to keep getting naked then I don't care how stupid it is, hell she and grey worm can have a few lesbian scenes for all I care.
1343	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	Not getting this whole "undermining LF/She's awesome at the game overnight" stuff. It seems pretty straightforward that she understands that LF couldn't have Cat, and that's she's the thing he wants. In the books one reason I don't particularly like Sansa is because she's oblivious to the obvious and she takes sooooooooo long to wise up even a little bit. She's not outsmarting LF, she's just coming into her own and noticing VERY obvious things that she could use to her advantage.

The one quote I keep coming back to is when he asks her "what do we do to the people who hurt the ones we love".  Well, LF is partially responsible for the deaths of everyone she loved, is that foreshadowing?

Some people gave this episode 10s because there was some actress in it who was 'hot'. It can easily be argued, should such judgments be made, that the number of ridiculous 10s far far outweigh the number of ridiculous 1-5s.Â

1350	xpozed	2014-06-02	I feel that most oft this season has been filler material until a small reveal/cliffhanger at the end( this has started to be the norm in most medium quality TV shows).The are clearly trying to cut back costs by using less characters per show and doing scenes that require less money to shoot ( people just walking&talking through a natural setting or a very small room).
The duel was great (and the poison has been shown - Oberyn's squire was rubbing a cloth on his spears; it wasn't so the spear tip was nice and shiny), Sansa's evolution is good and feels natural and the Boltons are always fun to watch.
The rest is just filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler fillerÂ filler filler, something mildly interesting happens.
It has become clear to me that HBO will ruin this story if they start filming seasons of books not released yet.

1352	clawson24	2014-06-02	7.5. Wanted it to be an all-time classic and yet I found myself somewhat let down by the end. That said I think my expectations may have been a bit unrealistic. I'm now hoping/expecting the next two episodes become the classic, jaw-droppers.

1353	Alboin	2014-06-02	(+) Â Nathalie Emmanuel beauty. I don't care about anti-nudityÂ hypocrites, she is gorgeous.Â 
(+) Â I enjoyed how they've changed the Vale. It gave Sophie Turner so much material to play with and she did amazing job. I never was a fan of that singer Marillion explanation.
(+) The rage of Oberyn and the horror of his death - I, actually a 37 years old man, who saw death in real life, had to close my eyes )) lol!!!
(+) Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon. This was just first class acting. Didn't need anything else from Moat Cailin stuff.
Â 
(-) Beetles. What was that about? It was like I've been suddenly sent to some low class film film festival screening, where everything is soÂ pretentious, you just can't figure out what's theirÂ pretension exactly about.Â 
(-)Thor Bjornsson. He is miscast in my opinion. It's not enough to growl and make faces to be scary. A person has to have it or be aÂ brilliant actor to act it on believable level. He is neither in my opinion.
Â 
I gave it an 8. would be 9, if bugs would be at least not as long as they are.Â
1354	Dragonglass Order	2014-06-02	On the fence between 8 and 9, but I'll go with 9.
Â 
I love Sansa's new transformation into a player.
I don't mind the Missandei and Grey Worm stuff. Â That actress is probably the most gorgeous on the whole show.
I loved Arya's hysterical laughter. Â It made up for not having Tyrion's laughter, which I didn't expect we were going to get anyway.
Did not like the beetle story. Â It might have been a half-decent metaphor if it hadn't dragged on for over three minutes.
The combat was good - Oberyn was fantastic as always, but I didn't like the delivery of the Mountain's lines.
1355	Petyr Patter	2014-06-02	Unfortunately, I had to watch this episode while trying to do a second task simultaneously.
Â 
Yet, preliminary I am going to say 7 out of 10.Â  I really dug the fight scene choreography, so that is really what "saved" this episode.Â  I also really liked Roose's scene with Ramsay, when he talks about the North and how they now, effectively rule it.Â  Other scenes just felt average, but then there were some choices that I just felt were stinkers.Â  Having Tyrion talk about why a mentally handicap cousin would spend his days squishing bugs was awful.Â  It felt like an attempt at profoundness of the unknowablity of other people, but went on to long, lacked any revelation, and took away the book scene of Oberyn and Tyrion discussing what to do after the Trial.Â 
Â 
I also didn't like the changes to the Vale.Â  Killing Lysa without a patsy was a much, much riskier move for Baelish, especially when he didn't need to kill her right then and there.Â  And this episode comes around and it looks like Baelish is lost... till Sansa swoops in and saves him with an string of lies mixed with some truths.Â  Later, we discover Sansa did so completely on her own initiative.Â  This is deeply troubling, because Baelish is in many ways her captor.Â  He certainly made sure she took some of the blame of regicide.Â  He is also a very dangerous person who betrayed her father.Â  The show somehow wants us to believe Sansa thinks she can "play" Baelish, because he "wants" her.Â  In the books, she needs to keep her identity secret for fear of reprisals from the Iron Throne.Â  Once the secret is out... what good siding with Baelish?Â  The man is dangerous.Â  She has witnessed him kill at least two people in front of her, and knows he killed Joffrey despite the fact Joffrey was an ally who rewarded him well for service.

1358	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	Certainly an improvement on episode 7.
Â 
The only thing that bothered me was omission of the poison on the spear, which i think will be revealed in ep10 anyway. A scene with qyburn and cersei should suffice and a screaming mountain.
Would've preferred a longer scene with the fighting. This scene would've been so much better with season 1 mountain..the Mountains dialogue at the end just didn't seem as effective and i didn't even hear it over the screams (including my own haha) it didn't seem to capture his rage and psychoticness and they didn't even show his frustration by being tantalised by oberyn.
Â 
The reveal of Sansa Stark, maybe a little too soon...but i think all these implications can be resolved. Didn't enjoy LF not being in control though and Sansa being a very obvious player. But i guess they had to make her do something otherwise it'll get a little boring.
Â 
Arya/hound scene pretty pointless and her laugh was kinda scary.
Â 
Why wasn't there any explanation of WHY the ironborn were dying..bog devils anyone? Was a good chance to connect to the Reeds as well. Didn't enjoy theon breaking down and becoming reek in front of the ironborn.
Â 
Many think the missandei/grey worm is a waste of time, i really enjoy them though. Both actors have a chemistry and it is a nice change from all the despair and heartbreak. Wow emilia and iain did a great job with the banishing scene. nearly overshadowed the duel
Â 
Tyrions speech was a tad too long. Nice metaphor for the chaos of westeros.
Â 
a solid 9/10

1359	The hairy bear	2014-06-02	I've given it a 7, although I'm not sure it deserves it. Certainly, if I were to judge on the basis of my expetations or the comparison to the books I would give it a far lower figure. I feel that they've turned one of the most memorable moments of the books and turned it into something that was no more than OK.
Â 
I was uninterested in Grey Worm/Melisandre and beetles. Not that those were was scenes per se, but I was uninterested.
Â 
The highlight, for me, was Sansa's "confession". She alone saved one whole point of my episode's score.
Â 
Â 


People giving it 1-5 are being ridiculous.


Â 
IMHO, it's far more ridiculous to give it a 10 or even a 9. I really wonder if people giving this episode a 10, are giving a 10 to most (if not all) of the episodes. I can understand that some people like it, even like it a lot, but can anyone really believe that this is the best that GoT (or TV in general) can offer?
Â
1360	Queen of Whores	2014-06-02	Heavily underwhelming and poorly handled episode, in my opinion. A 5 out of 10.
Â 
Everything was just.... not good. It's easier to list the things I didn't hate, and that would be.... Littlefinger's reference to dying on the privy? That was kind of amusing, I guess. Pascal also gave a good performance. That's...... kind of it, though. Everything else just sucked. I honestly don't even have it in me to keep complaining about this show. It's just so beyond what my worst fears would be. Everything feels so underwhelming and rushed and generic. *sigh*

Â 

I thought this was one of the shows better episodes. This might be my favorite show but I'm honest in that seasons 2/3 were largely uneven and not very great. So it's not like this show has a ton of great episode to really compare this one to. 
That said i take the show alone and try to push the book it off my mind while I'm watching, and as a TV show, it's mighty entertaining, and this episode was well done for the most part.
1362	Queen of Whores	2014-06-02	Shame that practically all other non readers found it amazingÂ 


Â 
Well good for them. Unlike them I've actually read the books, and loved them, and even with my (much lowed) expectations I was still disappointed. Frankly I don't give two shits what the non-readers think, cause it doesn't make me any less disappointed or frustrated.Â
1363	Sun	2014-06-02	I'm not so sure how to rate this episode. I hated bits of it, didn't care for much of it and liked a small portion.
It's worth noting that I usually watch and rate the show as an episode of TV drama, not in comparison to the books. I only call up the books when the show heads in ways that don't make sense narratively for their storyline, no necessarily in comparison to the books.Â 
Â 
Hated:
Â 
- Meereen:Â 
Â 
Please let them stop giving Emilia Clarke dialogue scenes. The girl is cringe worthy, and has been since season two. Just have her walk around looking pretty, that's why they hired her anyway. She ruined the Jorah dismissal scene for me. What should have been shocking, moving and painful to watch ended up being just an exercise in very bad acting.Â 
Â 
I have to say though, The actress playing Missandei has potential. She communicates a wider range of emotion in silence than Emilia does with 3 pages of dialogue.Â 
Â 
Â 
- Sansa's costume change:
Â 
Subtlety is a foreign word that holds no meaning to the writers of this show.Â 
Â 
Â 
Ambivalent:
Â 
Â 
- The Eyrie:
Â 
Sansa revealing herself to the Lords of the Eyrie seems like a very risky move to me. Not convinced Sansa would have made that choice and risked being sent back to King's Landing to die for Joff's murder, especially to lords who failed to support her brother's cause.Â 
Â 
- The opening scene of the whore's monologue Mole's Town:
Â 
Looked far too staged; nothing natural about it at all.Â 
Â 
Â 
- Most of The Duel while Oberyn is speaking:
Â 
All I could hear him say is "My name isÂ Inigo Montoya.Â You killed my father.Â Prepare to die." I laughed through it all until the very last moment when Oberyn died and then I issued a little yelp. But then again, that was also my reaction to the book-scene, so I can't really criticize the show for it.Â 
Â 
- The Wall:
Â 
Meh.
Â 
Â 
Liked:
Â 
Â 
Â - Arya:
Â 
Arya laughing was a very nice and credible touch. Classic PTSD reaction, imo.Â 
Â 
- Orson and Beetles:
Â 
Dinklage and C-W and such beautiful actors, I love watching them in quiet intimate moments. Dinklage especially delivered that scene beautifully. It moved me, and made me think. Orson in this case representing the gods indiscriminately crushing people that cross their path simply because they can.
A lovely, lovely scene, and a perfect set up for the duel. It actually gave me butterflies in my stomach when C-W said good luck. I was actually nervous for Tyrion. LOL
Â 
I more than liked this scene, I loved it.Â 
Â 
- Theon/Bolton:
Â 
Well done scenes where all involved, writers, actors, and director deliver.Â 
Â 
- Oberyn's death scene:
Â 
I yelped, and the looks on everyone's faces as it happened were perfect.
Â 
Â 
So, having written it all out, I think I'll give the episode a 6. Although I'm tempted to give it a 7 just for Orson's Beetles scene. Still not sure.Â 
Â 
Â 
Edit:
Â 
Ended up giving it a generous 7, Â though I think on rewatch it Â will drop to a 6.Â

1364	Premier League	2014-06-02	Sansa dying her hair back definitely has something to do with her embracing her stark heritage and shunning the red haired colors that identified her and robb with being tullies/not looking like lord eddard
1365	Jon Black	2014-06-02	I feel sorry for the complainers. That was probably the best episode of the season. The duel was fantastic. They nailed it. 10/10


Â 
Agreed.
Â 
There is way too much hyperbole from the "critics" on here for me. Â Does a different medium and/or a respect for the adaptation process mean anything??
Â 
If you are a complainer regarding the poison than I'm pretty sure that little fact appears after the duel (as the Mountain lays dying in pain). Â They rolled credits just after Oberyn's death so it hasn't happened yet. Â Â 
 
Â 
Talk about jumping to conclusions.

Â 
Grrrrrr....
1367	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	Am I the only book reader that enjoys these added scenes - I don't understand why these people want literal word for word translation of the booksÂ 
Â 
Lets have Bran in 3 scenes for 3 seasons - Lets have 2 Arya Scenes in 10 episodes - because that whats it would be like

Nope I'm on board with you. Not to mention that I enjoy having twists thrown at me that I'm not expecting. People don't get that this is an ADAPTATION. Is it an all time great series? No. But it's above average easily, and entertaining throughout.
1368	830SnowinHawaii	2014-06-02	7/10 for me.
Â 
I didn't like the way they went about Jorah getting banished. They put it off for so long it made me wonder whether or not they were still going to.
The attack at Mole's Town was alright, but I just want to get to the Battle of the Wall already, and I'm kinda thinking that Stannis isn't going to show up until S5. While I understand that they are trying to evenly disperse events for slower storylines to catch up with the quicker ones, most of the non KL story just seem to be dragging on. I wish they would've had fewer, longer scenes as opposed to more short ones for the Wall, Theon, and Dany.
Arya and the Hound is also being dragged on imo, whether the fans like the chemistry of the actors or not. I wish he would just "die" already.
I love the Roose and Ramsey dynamic. It gives Ramsey another dimension other than him just being purely evil and sadistic.
I was ok with the Beetle Speech, although I wish it would've been cut in half in favor of Tyrion and Oberyn's preduel convo.
The duel between Oberyn and the Mountain was the event I have been most looking forward to since I read the books after S3, and it delivered. Pedro was amazing, the fight was amazing and I didn't feel it was rushed at all. I knew the ending, obv, but I was still thoroughly excited throughout. Great ending, picked up the rest of the episode.
1369	Jon Black	2014-06-02	Am I the only book reader that enjoys these added scenes - I don't understand why these people want literal word for word translation of the booksÂ 
Â

Â 
I loved it and need to know what these other book readers would do to improve things. Â I always ask myself this before I start to criticize. Â It's only fair and approaches the conversation from a constructive standpoint instead of just flat out complaining. Â
1370	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	May I also add that these scenes are only filler because we know they mean nothing, the show loses its entire shock value if you know what happens - and thats one of the main thing that makes it great. If you If you spread ASOS over two seasons you need filler for characters that don't do much.

Filler is a stupid word I think. Some things are definitely filler, other things are there to flesh out the character. It's not filler just because it doesn't advance the plot directly.
Some people are watching the show for who knows what reason. Seasons 2/3 were worse than this season, they should've jumped off a long time ago.
1371	Jon Black	2014-06-02	Did you expect the fandom to be supportive? Surely you jest.Â 
Â 
 
Â 
Â 
Thank you for laying out everything that is wrong with this fandom. Yeah im taking potshots at you guys and you really freaking deserve it. This disgusting "filthy casual" attitude and utterÂ refusal to accept how adaptation works is just vile. To those who actually think this way, feel free to put me on your ignore lists cuz seriously, i want nothing to do with you.Â 
Â
1372	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	Yeah a lot of the nitpick is really baffling. And I'd say that MOST criticism is aimed at SPECULATION at what's going to happen because something tiny didn't go the way it was in the books exactly before.

Clearly my opinion has offended you somehow. I never said anything like "filthy casual," I only said that those that haven't read the books are obviously not going to have anything to compare the scene to, unlike those that have read the books. I suppose I just am less forgiving of the show not doing justice to scenes I love...? Your attitude seems a bit over-the-top for what is simply a differing of opinion.Â
1375	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	I think at a certain point, just stop watching. We're 4 seasons in, if you didn't like it after 3, why keep on? If you don't like it by 4 and you tune in next season, well, that's just stupid. When I don't like a show, I don't cry about it, I stop watching it.

Â 
Astounding.Â 
Â 
Fortunately people are perfectly allowed to have their own opinions.
Â 
I don't think the show is anywhere near as bad as many make out, but welcome to the block list anyway for the the admitted intent to personally attack people.
1377	Pilusmagnus	2014-06-02	Are we rating these shows compared to the books or compared to other TV shows?
Â

This.
Â 
A solid 10 from me. And I did read the books. Gods, some people are really pricky. This is indeniably great TV!
The opening scene is extremely immersive, Moat Cailin's putrefaction and illness is perfectly nailed, Littlefinger and Sansa scene is really really awesome. Yohn Royce casting is perfect, Jorah's banishment is correctly heartbreaking, Jaime and Tyrion's conversation is interesting, and gods, that final duel. Of course it's a bit rushed, but hell, it's television! You can't expect a scene to last twenty minutes only because that's the time it took you to read it.
I agree that Missandei and Grey Worm's relationship is bizarre, but shitting on the whole episode because of such futile details is simply being a dick.

Â 
Moat Cailin was excellent, and most of the Eyrie was great (this episode could have been a '2' if LF and Sansa had rehearsed *something* first and had it fail -- that would have made Sansa's save more believable). Â Also, why does Petyr ask Sansa if she knows what he wants -- he told her exactly what he wanted in episode 4. Â And it's exactly what Sansa thinks it is. Â This would have been a great time to have Sansa 'seduce' Petyr (what I think will happen in TWOW).

Nope, even when some people offer valid reasons for not liking a scene, they get shut down and attacked by those that love the scene.

Try being less "ME ME ME" and more constructive next time. Im not saying its not ok to dislike something in the show. But acting elitist about it is really awful. A special kind of awful. ground_control's post was more constructive and less whiny and an even worse opinion on the episode. This fandom's really got issues beyond the "Unpleasable" part.Â

Only weakness being the bizarre beetle scene and the second Grey Worm scene. Â The latter was worth it for the previous river scene and the view of Missandei. Â Wow! Â Never expected her to be so well put together.

I'm a fan of Roose and a hater of Ramsay, but I'll admit their scene gave me a little bit of the feels. Â Iwan Rheon does a great job.

1395	Ye_Olde_Huorn	2014-06-02	7/10
Â 
On one hand, Graves' approach was superior to his previous episodes this season. I was actually surprised by the near 3-minute single take at Mole's Town. But then that whole sequence was rather good. The episode also had scale,Â which is often hit-or-miss with this show. The Moat Calin stuff felt rushed, the Iron Born flaying felt more comical in its pacing than grotesque. But I enjoyed the legitimizing of Ramsay - to Winterfell!Â 
Â 
I do like Sansa being a more active participant in the Vale politics, but her "darkening" reveal seemed really ham-fisted. Jorah's banishment was a massive disappointment - the way Graves filmed it, the lack of passion in the performances. The Arya/Hound scene was just weird. I mean, are they going to tell them Arya Stark turned up or what? Will episode 10 have them just appear out of the Vale, as if last episode never happened? Why the hell was she laughing?Â 
Â 
The duel was OK. The editing ranged from OK in parts to a mess at other times. I didn't find it particularly exciting. Again, really subdued reactions from Graves.
1396	Jon Black	2014-06-02	Â 
Nope, even when some people offer valid reasons for not liking a scene, they get shut down and attacked by those that love the scene. Accusations of "nitpicking" and "book-purist" are almost definitely gonna get thrown around. I could outline a very long and detailed essay of why I disliked this episode, but what would that achieve apart from offending the sensitive people here that can't accept someone else's opinion?Â 


Â 
The hyperbole exists on both sides. Â The 'con' faction are just too much. Â It's clear valid reasons was pointed out by myself and others in this convo as being welcome. Â Just not nonsense, so...
Â 
Sorry for my shitty grammar.

The Moat Calin stuff felt rushed, the Iron Born flaying felt more comical in its pacing than grotesque.

I loved the look of Moat Cailin but the lack of explanation of why those guys are all sick was a wee bit of a letdown despite knowing theres crannogmen in there. Yeah that flayed guy, i was more like *snort* than "ewww." I think it was the shot. It felt like a comedic beat and likely that was the intent.
1398	Jon Black	2014-06-02	Yeh it was good - I find it a bit long winded though.

Â 
Great tv, though.
1399	ground_control	2014-06-02	If GoT Season 4 Episode 8 gets a 1/10 what on earth does The Walking Dead get?


I gave this episode a '1', but I couldn't tell you what The Walking Dead would get because I've never seen it (and haven't really ever heard of it). Â As I said in a reply to another post, I rate the show against other things I watch. Â I can't really rate it against things I haven't seen.
Â 
And True Detective gets a solid 10 from me, but remember it was a single eight-episode original story, not a thirty-eight (so far) episode adaptation of an in-progress series of books renewed/cast/funded in 10 episode blocks, so it was created in a much more controlled environment.
1400	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-02	8/10.
Â 
Pros:
Eliabowl
Moat Cailin and its aftermath
Â 
Olsson's story.Â Cons:

Emilia Clarke's eyebrow acting.
Â 
Greyworm and Missandei.Meh:
Â 
The Vale stuff.
1401	D-A-C	2014-06-02	I wonder what TV shows people are watching that are so great that they think GoT warrants such low scores. I sincerely hope it's all True Detective caliber shows.


Â 
Hannibal ... the best show on T.V at the moment.

1402	Your Lady	2014-06-02	Gave it a 8/10 after first watch.
Â 
Things that lowered the score:
Â 
Moat Cailin was great with Theons acting etc..but it felt little too rushed. You have all these sick and dying ironborn so why don't you drop a mention of bog devils and such and flesh it out a little more?
Â 
Grey worm and Missandei - I just do not care about them. I might understand why they put the scene in and they acted it well, it's just that I always end up thinking: you're wasting time on this, I want to see more of the actual plot. Plus, really, they are just not that interesting to me.
Â 
Beetle story - I am still trying to understand what the hell was that all about. Sure, they wanted to convey something, but hearing Tyrion making fun of a mentally handicapped person was awful to me. And it took too long, far too long. I kept looking at the clock and wishing for him to shut up so we can get to the duel.
Â 
The duel - was fantastic, only complaint is it should have been like 2 minutes longer. It felt a little rushed. I wanted more reaction shots from everyone.
Â 
Otherwise I loved Sansa scenes, Roose and Ramsay (shot of Winterfell, yay Â ), Aryas laugh, even the Wall. Meereen was good.
Â 
On the topic of ratings, I, too do not understand how some people just outright hate it, giving it a 1-4 ratings. I lurk on this site for over 3 years and those people were bitching back in season 2 (which was much worse that season 4), threatening to stop watching, yet they are still here. I have only one question for them: Why are you still watching if you think it's crap and travesty and whatnot?Â

I canÂ get behind why peeps are all "meh" at Grey Worm and Missandei. They are trying to flesh out supporting characters and pickings are slim. I want to see more Hizdahr but its too soon...

Â 
I bet if True Detective was written by GRRM and you knew exactly what was gonna happen every episode you wouldn't give it a 10


Hey come on, ground_control isnt being a dick about it. He can have his 1.Â
1406	Batman	2014-06-02	Besides the way the Mountain ended it, that was wildly disappointing.Â
1407	ground_control	2014-06-02	I bet if True Detective was written by GRRM and you knew exactly what was gonna happen every episode you wouldn't give it a 10


Huh? Â I quite clearly said that it's easier for True Detective to get 10s (from me at least), and the fact that it was an original story and not an adaptation was one of the reasons i cited. Â And by that, I'm not putting down the show for being an adaptation, but I was trying to be fair and call out the fact that it's impossible to avoid comparing the show to the books if you've read the books.
Â 
I don't want the show to be the video equivalent of an audio book, so I do expect some changes. Â Some I've liked, some I haven't. Â And if a scene doesn't work for me, I can't pretend there isn't another version and not compare the two. Â But I try to minimize complaints about changes just because they were changes -- for example, I hated the "your sister" change from "only Cat" last episode, and even called it out, but I admitted that that was a personal preference and didn't lower my rating of the episode because of it.

Most of us didnt like that too much. Even i was like "dude."Â Dont worry, mang, you arent being an arse about your low opinion of the show. In fact, you are proving how being constructive has more merit.
1409	ovis alba	2014-06-02	Was a weird one (probably because I was waiting for the fighting all the time):
- The Greyworm story in general is ok for me, but it felt weird in the episode, just sort of too long and too fillerish
- Bolton part was quiet good, I just sort of wished they kept the Ramsay becoming a Bolton part for "The children" (I know it's probably too much in there already, but it just would have felt to fit the theme so well)
- Arya's scene was a little weird. Hardly any reaction to her being alive? How is LF not going to know that she showed up? I liked the crazy laugh though.
- I enjoyed Sansa. In the end it got maybe a little bit too "Malificent", but overall I like it
- I would have placed the Wall part more towards the end, I think to lead up more to what is coming, but it was ok
- The Beetle. I really don't know what to make of it. Probably just too long and maybe forshadowing the fight, because I expected a more "satisfying" ending for that story. 
- The fight itself was good, maybe a little too short
Â 
- Overall I think most of the scenes I liked, but I would have placed them very different. I think with a episode title the duell could have been a little more prominent and of course it has to end with that, but I would have also maybe started with KL shorten the part of brotherlove before the duell, but maybe have an additional scene with a Tyrion "metaphoric speech thingy" at the very beginning of the episode (maybe with Oberyn in, I sort of found it a little sad that there was no glimpse of him at all before the fight scene started), so that the duell would have "framed" the episode (and maybe the speech could have been some general metaphor also connecting the others scenes of the episode a little more thematically), then the wall stuff more towards the end as a transition for what's to come.Â 
I don't know, I just feel the episode was a little bit more "puzzled" together than previous ones, where they found a more general theme which connects the pieces (like the "sibling" episode) But maybe there was a overall theme and I just missed it, being excited for the fight.  So while I liked many individual scenes as an overall episode it felt maybe not as good as its pieces.
1410	Red Tiger	2014-06-02	I'll give it a 9, im willing to overlook cons if the pros are strong enough
Â 
I loved the duel (Pedro Pascal, you have a fan for life). I loved Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner, my apologies for ever doubting you) and the Bolton scenes were awesome.
Â 
I didn't really care about the Wildlings or the NIght's Watch and Dany....im sorry I just think id like this show more if she wasn't in it.
1411	Frey Pies	2014-06-02	Ok, I just watched it, and I have no idea why people on this site are hating it.
Â 
Everything about this episode, EVERYTHING, was pretty much spot on. The greatest episode the show has ever done, imo.Â 
Â 
There was not a single scene that I didn't think was top class. I loved how non-dramatic they made the duel- it felt very brutal and very, very real- probably my favourite moment from the show ever now. Â 
Â 
For people hating on Emilia Clarke, I think the way she acted was perfect for that scene- putting on a cold facade to make banishing Jorah easier.
1412	gmavridis	2014-06-02	The duel was exceptional work for TV series. I don't think they could caption the close battle scenes better. They also made clear that Oberyn was winning and didn't finish him off because he wanted him to publicly confess that Tywin was behind Ellia's death. He even pointed at him at some point.
Sansa's storyline is simplified for the watchers sake.

Â 
Sansa's storyline is not simplified. IMO, it is improved upon. If that is the last we see of Sansa this season, then I'll still be immensely satisfied. I LOVED the Sansa we just saw.
1414	Mark Antony	2014-06-02	People dont want to actually think about what they see on screen and figure it out. This is why you have people complaining about the beetle story. It makes them think but its not in the book. Therefore its bad by default.Â [s]Even though you gotta be really thick to miss theThey could have been more subtle with a sledgehammer. Awful scene in an otherwise decent episode. Missendei and Grey Worms little thing was also terrible.8/10 I guess

1415	The Anti-Targ	2014-06-02	Another quality episode. After some stutters early season they've really brought it the last few episodes. Brilliant fight scene.
Â 
The transformation of Sansa! Is she going to take on the name Black Widow?
1416	Mia B.	2014-06-02	Apart from the beetle bit, I loved this episode!! Emilia's acting was kind of stiff and blank for someone who just had the biggest betrayal. Sansa and LF were amazing! WOW!
Â 
And the duel scene... ugh watching it was probably worse than reading it. It would be a shame if Pedro is not nominated for an Emmy for guest star or whatever that category is called. He will definitely be missed. Great actor.
1417	Ran	2014-06-02	320 votes in, 8.15 average, 9 median, 8.39 normalized average.
1418	Andeimir	2014-06-02	I genuinely feel sad for people who are unable to enjoy the series for the good television that it is, just due to the fact that the books are better.
Â 
I gave this episode a 10. Not because it's perfect or has no weaker scenes, but because it stands well above the standards of a television series.
The duel was simply incredible, the empathy Pascal invoked with his performenc had me simply captivated. Even with knowing how it must indeed conclude I was still restless and anxious in a way that I don't recall ever being in response to a TV scene.
Â 
It's one thing to be critical of the series and consider how it could've done things better, it isn't the best thing on television and it substantially lacks in substance compared to the books, to me. However, being unable to put that aside and simply enjoy the acting, scenery, costumes and how immersive the series truly is... It just makes me wonder: why do people who dislike the tv adaptation so much continue watching it?

Seriously, I agree (except for the not best part). Most TV series can't even dream of having moments like this.Â

1420	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-02	Positives
Mole's Town attack - quite liked, the mercy shown to Gilly was a tad cliche but was saved by the rain of blood through the floorboard
Moat Cailin - The scene was all about Theon/Reek and and Allen hit another home run.
Vale Coroner's Court - menacing and fantastic - felt it was really well done.Â 
Ramsay/Roose - I did actually have some chills.
The fight - I did actually have many chills. Fell short of awesome level as it just felt a tad rushed.
Â 
Negatives
Sansa/Petyr - This is actually borderline neutral. I mark it as a -ve on first watch due to the lack of context it has as the scene stood. After building up Baelish as the Master of Puppets it just seemed somewhat OOC at this time. More context later may improve this scene's status.
Dark Sansa - I do like the proactive Sansa, but I really dislike the light-switch-flick of her personality. Really shoddily handled IMO. It's not about the medium. They have demonstrated they CAN do nuanced character arcs (Jaime). This just smacks of being a brutal transformation. Were they aiming for surprise? "Lets surprise them by paying homage to Everdeen!" Was it a realisation they had undersold Sansa in the past and were over compensating? I don't know but am disappointed.
Pre-trial - just felt rushed. It just seemed to lack the menace of the books. The fore-knowledge of the poisoned blade was the glimmer of hope. It became about how long Oberyn could survive while the poison took hold. Sure they may reveal poison later on, but that just smacks of a cheap "And then they all woke up and it was all a dream" moment. Too much beetles and too little pre-trial tension is disappointing.
Â 
Neutral
Castle Black - Scene itself was good, but it suffers a bit because of the way the whole Wall story has been constructed, resulting in it feeling a bit out of place
Missandei/Grey Worm - .D'awww cute.... and worthless. Great that they are going to these lengths to show the depth of secondary characters. Perhaps one day they will do the same for Stannis, the personality of the dragons (far more critical to Dany's story) or anyone named Tyrell who also has a 'Y' chromosome.Â 
The Dismissal - I want to love this scene but something just seems 'off' about it and I just can't put my finger on what that is. It may become clearer with a rewatch. It might be Dany's movements? I just don't know at the moment.
The Dog and the Wolf - ending of the scene showed the descent of Arya, sure, but the scene itself just felt disjointed. Good dialogue though.
Beetles - I just couldn't care until the bell started tolling, thankfully.
Â 
Summary - a solid episode let down by the choppy editing. This season has benefited by longer sequences on each story but this episode just felt like it fell back into the habit of shorter less explanatory set pieces and was just a little less satisfying than it could have been. Perhaps the Black Sansa reveal was a bit more, ummmm, 'stark' because it came after the week break meaning it didn't 'flow' as well. Perhaps the apparent brevity of the Trail was exacerbated coming after the week break too.
Â 
I'd like to give it an 8, but 7/10 it is.Â

Â 
So you, and many others who do the same thing, gave a ... by your own admission ... imperfect episode a perfect score?
Â 
The Wire, Hannibal, The Americans, The Sopranos, Community, Nip/Tuck, Battlestar Galactica (till crappy season 3+) Frasier, South Park, Seasons 1-3 Family Guy, Law & Order Special Victims, True Detectives, House of Cards, The Office, IT Crowd, Father Ted ... the list goes on, and on.
Â 
There is plenty of amazing T.V out there, so that when a show doesn't deserve a perfect rating we can go ahead and not give it one. You have already agreed that there were some weaker scenes.
Â 
Alot of people are complaining about the 'always unhappy about everything crowd', but what about the 'best hour of television in history of television!!!!!!!!!' crowd? Constantly overrated disappointing episodes as 'best in the series', 'better than all other T.V' etc.
Â 
If you think that was a perfect hour, without any faults I really wish I could see it that way. I don't mean that sarcasticly, I mean it sincerely, I wish I could have sat back at the end of that and said 'well that was fantastic', instead, my immediate reaction was 'that's it?'.
1423	Queen of Whores	2014-06-02	I don't exactlyÂ wantÂ to give any episode of Game of Thrones a low rating. IÂ wantÂ to love them, since I love the books and season 1 was absolutely amazing. The show has potential. That's why it's disappointing when it doesn't quite reach the level of greatness it can. I don't find it appropriate to give a disappointing episode of Game of Thrones a 10, when I give the same rating to masterpieces like There Will Be Blood and Apocalypse Now. When an episode of Game of Thrones genuinely wows me, I'll be the first person to give it a high rating and praise it endlessly. Until that point though, I've got to be honest with myself and give it an honest rating.
1424	dbunting	2014-06-02	Gave it an 8. I have given at least three 8's so far this season. Highest was a 9, lowest this year a 7.The only low for me was the beetle story. I just kept thinking, "why do beetles die"? Hopefully it doesn't replace, "where do whores go"?Highs, action at the wall, Snow becoming a Bolton, Sansa becoming an active player and of course the duel.
1425	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-02	Very good episode in places. Terrible in orders.
Â 
Moat Cailin was brilliant but the flaying part was rushed. I'm guessing they didn't want to have another shock part in the episode. Legitimising Ramsey was great. I love how calm Roose is. Next season is going to be amazing.Â 
Â 
Mole's Town was very good and the conversation between all the Night's Watch brothers was the best they've ever done. How are there only 102 men? I thought few episodes ago there were 500? Somebody messed up there.Â 
Â 
The Grey Worm/Messandai story was pointless and utter crap. Trying to add terrible filler to Dany's story is only going to make the Meerenese Knot even more unbearable and boring.
Â 
Jorah being exiled was done very well.
Â 
The beetle story started off great but had a god awful conclusion. Maybe in the future George will be the moron and the books will be the beetles if he doesn't hurry up and get them out in time.Â 
Â 
The trial by combat was amazing. I loved how Oberyn just lost it and got angrier and angrier. The final scene was very rough to watch. Eyes, teeth and brainsâ<U+0080>¦.YUCK!!!!
1426	MoIaF	2014-06-02	I gave it an 8, I though it was a pretty solid episode.
Â 
Â 


 
Â 
I've come to enjoy the Grey Worm and Missandei scenes. Daenerys confronting slavery is a massive theme over the last few seasons and promises to remain so. And freedom from slavery is an immensely, overpoweringly personal experience. Look at what Grey Worm and Missandei have discussed in their scenes: their abductions; their initial enslavements; their memories before slavery; their gratitude to Daenerys. Both of them are struggling to being people once more after years of being property.Â 
Â 
Most fans cannot easily relate to their struggle. It's also not something popular audiences are used to seeing. Many posters are calling it a "romance," and while that element is there it is only a part of the Grey Worm/Missandei dynamic. We recognize the brash hero (Oberyn), the witty misunderstood rogue (Tyrion), the crazy queen (Cersei), the wandering swordsmen (The Hound and Arya), and the noble soldier (Jon). How former slaves live their lives after being freed doesn't fit the normal fantasy mold. But I think it makes a nice complement to the steady stream of violence, sex, and brutality of the show.


Â 


Yes! "Having their first crush" is an excellent comparison. We're seeing adults struggle with their feelings, emotions, and relationships in a manner Â more Â commonly associated with teenagers today. Slavery and Grey Worm's castration are the reasons behind this arrested emotional development. I think it's great, but understand how it can throw viewers at first.


Â 
Agree completely.
Â 
Meereen is not the most exciting of plots and this is a good way to give it some more meat. It's also an interesting way to explored the idea of non-sexual love.

Â 
Just to pick up from your point here.
Â 
The directors of this show, unlike alot of works that have to be invented, written on a series by series basis, have a solid base to work off of with GRRM's books.
Â 
As, someone who watched seasons 1-3 THEN read the books (at DoD now) I was amazed when dialogue in the show appeared in the books practically word for word, that just show's you how solid the work the directors are adapting is.
Â 
Therefore, when they fail to adapt work that is solid we have every right to point out 'WTF are you doing?'.
Â 
Now you can point to limits of the medium, so skipping battles and such is ok as long as the core emotional content and meaning of the books is kept.
Â 
But, it is starting to deviate badly as each small change ripples bigger and bigger.
Â 
For example the wacky adventures of those lovely mismatched buddies Arya and The Hound is well past its due to be finished and is getting crammed with all sorts of sh*t that is dragging it out, and actually destroying some of the character developement.
Â 
Then you have the fact that Tyrion cannot be dark around the edges, unlike his book counterpart, and so he is always good, and kind and just ... ok, he is sometimes selfish and enjoys the odd whore, but don't we all har har har. This then has the side effect of limiting Jamie's arc as we already have one good as can be Lannister, so Jaime transforming into a sorta not so much of an asshole isn't as huge a thing.
Â 
To get back to my point though. They HAVE solid source material. If they adapt it badly we should call them out on it.
Â 
People such as myself who enjoy the books more, I think, are just frustrated that so many people's only contact with the work is through the T.V show ... and its short changing them of a much richer and ultimately better story.

Nothing is perfect. Or at the very least, nothing subjective is ever perfect.
I can't think of any TV series episode which I consider perfect (and I've seen the ones you've listed, and many more), everything has faults, highs and lows. This episode, to me, was the best of the season and therefore naturally also one of the best in the series following the latter half of season 1, which is where it peaked for me, so far. Given that, and given that it stands as high above the tv norm as it does, I feel that a score of 10 is justified.
Â 
Simply put, I scored it on a relative scale, not an absolute 'logical' one.
Â 
As previously stated, I don't think Game of Thrones is the best thing on television. We've had True Detective (which you yourself listed) which, in my opinion, easily claims that title for this year. Furthermore, not unlike yourself I too am irritated by the crowd which speaks of GoT as the greatest thing ever, blind praise and overhyping bothers me almost as much as snide elitist negativity does. I don't think I've displayed the former in my comment.
Â 
My issue isn't with people not praising the series, it's perfectly understandable that some might not enjoy things to the extent or in the way that I do. Just as an example, the setup scene with Roose and his bastard was fantastic for me because it really felt that I, as an audience, was right there in the wind-swept vastness of the north and every shot had this authentic look and weight to it. It was a short and relatively minor scene, but I just loved it.
Â 
There is a great span of grey between the radiant white that the fandom of the tv adaptation hype, and the darkest of blacks that some people on these boards claim the series to be. The primary reason why the latter does irk me a little more is because to me it means that people are missing out on great television, the praising fans don't deny themselves much beyond their critical thinking.

1429	Conchobar	2014-06-02	No poison on the end of the spear??? Although anyone catch littlefingers line "some people die hovering over their chamber pot"...but still no poison???? ...and i feel like they undersold oberyns nickname like they had so many times to mention it!...idk im still up in the air...


There was poison, you're not going to be able to see it, why would Oberyn have it visible?

1430	TheEvilKing	2014-06-02	Gave it a 6.
Missandei/Grey Worm was a yawnfest. The Jorah exile lacked emotional impact and felt like Dany being cruel. Shoulda kept in the stuff about him thinking of her as a chick he fancies instead of his queen.
The Theon/Bolton stuff was good. Wish we'd see more of Roose this season, he's always a delight.
Arya scene was weird. I get what they were aiming for but it did not work for me. Sansa had already revealed her identity by that point, no? The guard didn't think to mention it? They didn't think it was wise to capture her, being Arya Stark and all? Shit writing.
Sansa stuff was surprisingly good. I think I prefer her being more overtly manipulative than she is in the books. I take Littlefinger not having a plan with a grain of salt now, they've already wrecked any subtlety he has in the books.
The Wall stuff was so-so and seemed to be there to a) remind people about the wildling threat and  add a bit of extra drama with the whole Gilly thing to give Sam something to do next week.
I wish they had spent more time on the duel, and opted for a different pre-duel scene than the Tyrion/Jaime thing. We've already seen plenty of those two together this season. How about Oberyn/Jaime? Would have been cool. Or Cersei visiting Tyrion.
The duel itself was fine, I just wish they'd spent longer on it or had a different scene before it instead.
Â 
Â 


There was poison, you're obviously not going to be able to see it, why would Oberyn have it visible?


Â 
Exactly. Why else would they have the shot of the guy wiping down the spear tip? He was obviously coating in poison.
Â 
Do people expect Oberyn to say "BY THE WAY I POISONED YOU" or something?
1431	boojam	2014-06-02	But the guy at the gate did know who she was? He'd never seen her before and she still looks like Arry the orphan but he knew who she claimed to be. We don't know yet what happened after Arya stopped laughing. Lets hope for a bit of explanation as to why they were not let in next week.


I think this is true. Donnel Waynwood is he 'Ser Donnel Waynwood"? (that's Alisdair Simpson). Tho he makes no big deal out it, you'd think any Knight of Vale would know all the High Born of Westeros , there not that many, a lot of vassals , knowing all of them, I don't know. But one of the top 7 (there may be 8!) ...'Click!', "Thats odd.".... he thinks.
I know in the 15th century news did not travel fast, but, it's gotten around that the former king is dead and Robert'sÂ  Hand was executed.. Would think the guardian of the gate would need to know a lot of things. So why didn't he perk up he would have known that Arya is of both Stark and Tully blood? That would have been important in the Vale.
By the by Arya has NOT been taken for a boy since season 2.
The Arry thing is done with.
(I think this was true in the books too.)

1432	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-06-02	I gave it a 9. Excellent episode from start to finish.
1433	Cyvasse Khal	2014-06-02	My first 10 of the season! Phenomenal television. I was also really happy with the format the storylines took. For an episode that went to just about every location, sometimes in similar episodes a storyline gets lost if its shown after say 5 minutes and then returned to again at the 40th minute. But loved that every location got one 5-10 minute block of time. It really heightened the importance of each IMO.
Â 
Positives
- Mole Town raid: Set the tone early. Pacing wise it was a good decision to start off with some action, nice touch with Ygritte not wanting to kill a mother and newborn, maybe she knew she was a fellow wildling too?
- Theon: Continued good work from Alfie. Loved the internal struggle of knowing he has to act assertive and Lord-like discussing the peace terms, but his fragility is just about to burst.
- The Boltons: This may seem really minor to some, but I really really loved that they showed Roose being so immensely proud of holding The North. Similarly, showing how much Ramsay loves the Bolton tradition of flaying (wow, gross scene).
- Jorah sent packing: Better late than never I guess.
- Sansa: Holey shit Sophie is on fire this season. Her 'confession' speech to the Lords of the Vale was great, but the conversation between her and LF afterwards was even better for me because of smart dialogue. A simple line from LF saying better she went with the guy she knows as opposed the stragers she doesn't. And Sansa's line of "I know what you want", the way she looked and the way she said it was terrific.
- Arya/Hound: So perfectly played out. Finally they made it, it's over, they both get sort of what they want. Nope, wait, after a couple of years on the run, Arya is 3 days too late. What else can you do but laugh at the incredible misfortune. Great stuff.
- Tyrion/Jaime: Ok the beetle story itself was a bit weird and i'm sure there is more of a point to it than what I got out of it. But, this is about the most natural on screen conversation you're likely to see. Peter and Nikolai play off each other like they've been friends for 30 years, and what I got out of it was a touching reflective chat between two brothers who love each other and are fully aware there is a good chance it will be the last time they speak.
- The trial by combat: Wow. Speechless. Confronting, emotional, shocking. The fight was really well choreographed. Like most people, definitely going to miss The Red Viper and have a great respect for Pedro's acting for a flawless portrayal of a character.
Â 
Negatives
- Sam: His character continues a slippery slope of annoying and pathetic (far more so than the books).
- Missandei/Grey Worm: Not sure where this is going, or why it's going at all, and i'm pretty sure I don't care.
- Dany: I hate harping on about a point i've made a fair few times on these forums now. Emilia's acting sticks out like sore thumb in most scenes. It wasn't as bad as she has been in a few episodes this season, but everything felt very forced, and I think the seething but restrained talk to Jorah needed to be more subtle.
1434	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-06-02	No poison on the end of the spear??? Although anyone catch littlefingers line "some people die hovering over their chamber pot"...but still no poison???? ...and i feel like they undersold oberyns nickname like they had so many times to mention it!...idk im still up in the air... not for nothing but why are some people assuming poison wasnt used on the spear?
1435	jobla6	2014-06-02	8/10
Â 
The duel was everything I'd hoped for (apart from Tyrion's vomit) and I thought Sophie Turner was amazing, as usual, but I'm not sure how I feel about the changes in Sansa's story.
Â 
I would have given it a nine but it was let down a few poor scenes especially Missandei and Grey Worm - what does the romance add to the show? Could we not fill that time with more of the Red Viper or coldhands ? Did we really need to see a bunch of naked women (of course the men were wearing trousers). To be honest, the pointless nudity is really annoying me as the series progresses.Â
1436	Prince of Cheese	2014-06-02	I wanted to love this episode, except I just couldn't. The fight especially is what I wanted to love, but I couldn't. There were too many cuts! Â I didn't feel anything because the edit didn't give me enough time to react. Joffrey had a better death / edit than this, and I actually felt sad, even for Joffrey. But this ... this episode was like Cersei directed, edited, and produced it. Thinks it's good, ends in disaster.Â 
Sorry. Just couldn't. Rated it a 4.Â 
The Boltons and Theon scenes were probably the best and truest of this episode.
Â
1437	The Daly Raven	2014-06-02	8/10- I don't see why so many people are bitching about Missendei and Grey Worm, there's something beautifully tragic about a eunuch fawning hopelessly over another former slave. Bar Emilia in the Jorah exile scene I thought the acting was pretty great overall. Enthralled by the spectacularly choreographed fight scene and absolutely brutal ending. Satisfied with some good build up to the Bolton's rule over the north and the imminent wildling attack on the wall.
Â 
A few downsides were some structural plot issues and poorly executed character moments. Littlefinger's helplessness definitely felt disjointed from the rest of the series, particularly after all the other scenes talking up his intellect and cunning- 'the most dangerous man in all of westeros' left twiddling his thumbs only to be rescued by the a girl who was all too recently an unwitting pawn. D & D definitely jumping the gun on that plot thread. Dany's dismissal of Jorah didn't quite hit the mark either, her inner conflict was not well shown on screen and having Jorah beg made her seem more ruthless and arrogant than ever. Arya and the Hound announcing their arrival at the doorstep of the Eyrie also seems to be a hole the writers will struggle to convincingly dig themselves out of. Also Ramsay's claim to the north via the imposter Arya has so far been ignored so either will be ignored or dropped in as if out of nowhere.
Â 
Overall though some fantastic dramatic moments and action set pieces which build towards the series climactic multiple revelations
1438	Ran	2014-06-02	365 votes, 8.14 average, 9 median, 8.44 normalized average
1439	Fevre River Warrior	2014-06-02	I gave it a 9, I thought it was an excellent episode except for the beetle bit that went on too long. Not sure what that was about.
Â 
I loved the Sansa scene at the "trial" and how they changed that from the book - so Royce and the others know she is Sansa Stark already, in the books they do not. Also, that she and Robin are going to go out into the Vale which should be interesting. Her interaction with Littlefinger was just excellent. I like where they are going with the Sansa character, I think she will be Queen one day and a darn good one. She is learning the Game of Thrones.
Â 
I was wondering how we would see the spying of the Bear revealed, it made me sad as it did in the books. Mormont is a sad figure, poor Jorah. So it looks like they will keep to his story arc as it is in the books, which means Tyrion's will follow.
Â 
I liked Ygritte seeing Gilly and the baby and letting them live.
Â 
Oberyn's death was too gruesome for me. I wish he had just killed that Mountain instead of insisting he admit to Elia's rape and murder, and the children's murder. Reading it is one thing, seeing him squeeze his head was too much. Will we fiind out his spear was tipped with poison I hope? The Mountain has to become Robert Strong.
Â 
I love this show and think D&D are doing a great job with the series!
1440	kissdbyfire	2014-06-02	So much was wrong with that episode, not the least the key part, the duel. They thought they knew better - again - and they fucked it up. That's a 2 for me, lowest since the House of the Undying atrocity.

Couldn't agree more; I also gave it a two. And that's only because I couldn't bring myself to give it a 1. Not yet, anyway. 
I've been feeling more and more disinterested in the show with each episode. I do understand that changes are necessary when adapting a novel to TV, but I don't understand many of the seemingly unnecessary changes they have been doing. And it seems these are getting more numerous, and even more unnecessary as the show progresses. I mean, there are shitloads of important stuff that's being left out and replaced by... well, meaningless filler, like that whole minutes-long scene about some non-existent Lannister smashing beetles. What. The. Fuck. 
The way the inter-characters dynamics are being changed into something very different. No idea why. 
Some things that are being changed for what seems to me to be to up the 'gore-effect'. 
I also feel that the acting direction is being overlooked; like your commentary, Linda, on the YouTube review for Oathbreaker, when you said someone should have directed Daniel Portman in his horse-riding scene better. Frankly, no one would be that bad at it, and it just looked ridiculous. 
I'll probably finish watching this series since there are only two more episodes, but I'm not going to watch the next ones until I've read the conclusion to the saga by Martin.
1441	Rashtibram	2014-06-02	This was absolutely fantastic television once again. I rated it a 7, but it was very close to earning the first eight of the season. No weak links and a multitude of amazing scenes, from Moat Cailin and the Winterfell reveal to Jorah's banishment, to Tyrion's beetle monologueâ<U+0080>¦the list goes on. My fourth favorite episode ever, surpassed only by 'Valar Morghulis,' 'The Rains of Castamere,' and 'Blackwater.'

1442	Ser Graymax	2014-06-02	Well, another 8 for me.Â  Probably deserves better but it seemed so rushed because of the complexity of the story and the inability to get it all in in the episodes available.Â  Plus for the sets, costumesÂ  and cinematography. Beautiful.
Â 
Best moment for me was Aryas laughter.Â  Exactly how I would have reacted but then I love irony.
Â 
The Wall is quickly becoming the most boring story of all when it should have been the most exciting.Â  I fear for next week.
Â 
Dany continues to have the personality and acting skills of a dead fish.Â  Her range of emotion lacks a range of emotion.
Â 
The Beetle story, ah metaphors and as they go this is a good one.Â  So many possible explanations.Â  I like it being GRRM and killing his characters but Gregor killing everyone is as mindless as Orsons acts.
Â 
I like the books better but the changes made make it more interesting for me to follow the series rather than a mindless regurgitation would. Â

1443	Coeur	2014-06-02	This duel... perfectly executed, but only to the point where the tables turned.Â 
Â 
1. The tripping of Oberyn - it's extremely hard if not impossible, to trip a standing man by tapping him in a boot with a hand. After adding our hero's Jedi level KungFu skills it is really unbelievable how easily he lost balance. This, and the way how easily Oberyn got caught on the ground, without trying to roll away, rise, or anything.
Â 
2. Dr. Clegane Dental Service - beating out full keyboard from a mans mouth, with a single blow without a swing, lying flat on the back? Seriously...
Â 
3. Crushing skull with bare hands - ok, licentia poetica. It was worth it, as many of us will never forget the look and the sound of it. Most brutal scene i've seen in years. Whole 4 seasons of Spartacus didn't moved me as much as this scene did.
Â 
4. Why werent Oberyn smart enough to cripple Mountain before starting his little chat? Blind him, cut his tendons, cut off his damn arms?
Â 
5. How many more movie scenes like this will i have to watch, where a character certain of victory starts to talk a bit much, to let the opponent recover and kill him?
1444	A Redeemed Hound	2014-06-02	Gave it an 8. Â Removed myself from the books several seasons ago so I try to look at the shows as a different story. Â If I compared them to the books each episode would be a 1 or 2.
Â 
The battle was great. Â I was peeking through my fingers when The Viper was getting mad Mountain love.
Â 
I liked the scene with Dany and Jorah and Jorah and Selmy.
Â 
Greyworm and Missendei was odd but it adds character/story to them both. Â I also think they are trying to keep the black people in the show since there are very few of them around. Â I thought they were going to have it so Greyworm still had his bits and pieces. Â Glad they didn't.
Â 
I liked the Eyrie scenes but not sure why they would have Sansa give up who she is and then lie about how her aunt died. Â And Peter and Sansa would have had plenty of time to go over a game plan after he killed Lysa. Â That was sloppy.
Â 
The Hound and Arya at the Eyrie was also very sloppy. Â I enjoyed Arya's laughter though and the look on the Hound. Â But after announcing to the world that he has Arya Stark, why would they even think of allowing them to leave? Â Let alone allowing the Hound to live? Â Ultra sloppy. Â And the obvious downfall of the Hound due to a bite on the neck is just pathetic IMO. Â Hopefully they have a battle too where he gets it even worse.
Â 
Theon and Moat Cailin was pretty good. Â Loved the scene with him riding holding the white flag. Â Wish they showed more of the surrender though and the aftermath and Theon's reaction. Â They certainly had the time to do so.
Â 
Was fine with Tyrion's beetle speech. Â No issues there.
Â 
And again the show is well under 60 minutes.
Â 
Maybe I should have given the episode a 7 but the final battle was crazy.
1445	Dreams Of Spring	2014-06-02	This is the first time I've posted in this topic, and its because I have to downrate it unfortunately. The gruesome scene of Oberyns fate really made me lose respect for the series. They didn't have to go off the deep end with the crushing of skulls. The rest of the episode was just .. ok, Arya and the Hound, Dany banishing Jorah, Theon at Moat Cailin, but everything else just was so-so. I'm not really happy with whatever is going on with Sansa either, but we will see.
I give it a 5 ...
1446	Howling Mad	2014-06-02	Â 
Well George had Unsullied cuddling with hookers in Mereen, so maybe you should rknow what you are reading.


Â 
Cuddling for human companionship does not equate to sexual tension. Besides in the books Missandei is no more than ten years old when freed and a little too young to be involved a consensual eunuch/slave romance.
1447	The Dragon Demands	2014-06-02	I rated it an 8, well maybe 8.5.Â  It was very strong acting throughout, though marginally the episode wasn't as solid as last week.Â 
Elyo didn't seem to like the Daenerys vs Jorah acting, that she should have been raging at him (think how she raged at Viserys "it will be the last time you have HANDS!")....but I think what they were trying to do was have her in "tranquil fury" mode.Â  She didn't rave at Mirri Maz Duur, she just coldly killed her.Â  Being terse like that indirectly hints that she is deeply hurt but trying to hold back her anguish, along with her rage.Â  Yeah, it could have been more, but on the other hand you can't have everyone overacting and raging all the time.Â  I thought it entirely good.Â 
As for the ongoing Missandei/Grey Worm stuff, it's obviously a departure from the books (She's a ten year old, he's a eunuch)Â  but that doesn't make it inherently bad; it's written and acted well enough, I just get nervous about where they're headed; but that's for another day.Â  But I remember the line in the books that just because a eunuch does not have a man's parts does not mean he also does not have a man's heart.Â  As Elyo said, good to see that they're treating the secondary characters in Daenerys's storyline as having emotions/subplots outside of her.Â 
Mole's Town short but too the point, Castle Black scene also short and perfunctory but entirely fine.Â 
So the storylines at the Wall and in Meereen were fine.
All of the Ramsay/Reek/Roose scenes were amazing.Â 
This leaves us with the Eyrie and King's Landing.Â 
Well, to start with, the Tyrion-Jaime beetles thing wasn't really bad, it's just that it wasn't worth 4 f-ing minutes of screentime.Â  It was confusing at first but by the end I understood Tyrion's point about wondering why senseless violence beyond our control happens, and he'd feel better just knowing a reason why.Â  In contrast to Elyo I thought it well acted, and nothing was inherently wrong with it, and I didn't quite feel it "dragged" but it should have been shorter.
As for the fight itself....yeah.Â  The acting was fine.Â  But the fight choreography we can blame squarely on the director.Â  I mean, compare this to the intimacy of the Ned/Jaime fight or Bronn/Vardis fight from Season 1.Â  They didn't have enough closeup shots.Â  Possibly because they needed to use stunt doubles for Oberyn.Â  It wasn't an outright "bad" fight choreography, it just wasn't the stunning fight described in the books.Â  I like it more on rewatch.Â  Elyo often has strong opinions on the actual fight choreography; let me clarify that I'm actually not as versed/opinionated on that frotn, what I'm annoyed about is the *editing* and *cinematography* of the fight, the camerawork.Â  It doesn't outright detract from the episode for me, I just wanted it to be even more intense.Â  I can see why you would compare this to the TV Red Wedding, though they're also quite different categories to compare (while TV first fans were in awe at the simple fact that they killed off Robb, which is something Martin and not the TV show invented, the actual choreography of the massacre would have been better with a few tweaks....I don't know if a TV show can build up dread as easily as a book can without spoiling what's about to happen, but they could at least have had the moment where Dacey Mormont is the only one who nearly escapes the hall only to be killed by the Boltons as the enter).Â 
But I digress....
Long story short, only complaint so far is that the camerawork on the Oberyn/Gregor fight should have been much more intense, akin to the LAST Trial by Combat between Bronn and Vardis.Â  Not that it outright detracts from the show for me, I usually don't worry about action stuff, but plotting.Â  And the beetle discussion wasn't actually bad, it just shouldn't have taken up four full minutes - because that time could have been given to other KL characters.
As for the Eyrie.....yeah....
Â 
Well the first and biggest thing is the MASSIVE change of having Sansa reveal her identity to the high lords of the Vale, though only 3 of them and they promise to keep it a secret.Â  Then they flat out have the Hound announce that Arya Stark is at the Bloody Gate...when Arya has been presumed dead for about three years now.Â 
Again, as Elyo pointed out, this isn't *necessarily* bad, but it raises major questions about where they're heading with all of this.Â 
I thought the Arya reaction bitterly laughing about her bad luck was entirely note-perfect.Â  It reminded me of that moment in Titus Andronicus when after Titus learns that his daughter has been maimed (her hands and tongue cut off), his two sons sentence to death, and the emperor said he might pardon them if Titus cut off his own hand and sent it to him.....a messenger returns with his two sons heads and his hand sent back in mockery.Â  Titus then BURSTS OUT LAUGHING because he has not a tear left in his head (Anthony Hopkins was amazing in this).Â 
Arya:Â  When will this fearful slumber have an end?
They're all over the place with Littlefinger and while his acting was okay now, I still wish they'd shown him with more of a plan, though I acknowledge that changing around a reveal of Sansa's identity may have necessitated this (or, enough that I don't mind).Â 
So my only real complaints were:Â  the duel editing, of possibly the biggest one on one duel in the narrative, needed to be a LOT better than it was, though it was servicable enough in writing/acting.Â  Apparently directors Minahan and Kirk (who directed the Ned/Jaime and Bronn/Vardis fights in Season 1) haven't been working on the show since early Season 3, and Graves once was one of my favorites for "Kissed by Fire" but has lost major points after the debacle of the Jaime/Cersei scene in "Breaker of Chains" (though I'm not sure if the writers ordered him to film it that way).Â 
Second, the beetle scene was fine but should have been two minutes, not four.Â 
Third.....WTF?!Â  Okay they reveal Sansa's identity but only to three lords who then promise to keep it a secret (and whom Littlefinger was going to reveal her identity to *eventually* in the books)....but Arya?!Â  Just announcing, "Arya Stark is alive!" -- not inherently bad, but where are they going with this?
1448	The Dragon Demands	2014-06-02	This is the first time I've posted in this topic, and its because I have to downrate it unfortunately. The gruesome scene of Oberyns fate really made me lose respect for the series. They didn't have to go off the deep end with the crushing of skulls. The rest of the episode was just .. ok, Arya and the Hound, Dany banishing Jorah, Theon at Moat Cailin, but everything else just was so-so. I'm not really happy with whatever is going on with Sansa either, but we will see.
I give it a 5 ...



That's how Oberyn died in the books, with his head gruesomely crushed in.Â
1449	Northern_Star	2014-06-02	Â The beetles were a metaphor for human self destruction. Wars and murder. We are the 'moron' who can't stop destroying ourselves. I thought it was apt at this point in the show.
Â  I give this episode an 8 overall. We moved the plot forward nicely with Jorah's excommunication and Oberyn's death. I agree I am a bit confused about why we are spending so much time on Greyworm, but there may be a justified reason, I'm not counting that as a negative yet.
Â 


Â 

	Spoiler  I think they gonna use missandei as the third betrayal - for love.

Â 


7
The duel was great, but not the rest.Â  Why is Tyrion talking about beetles? Why are we spending time developing a new storyline with Mel and Greyworm?Â  Why do these episodes always end early? There is so much to cover and instead of covering we are doing this?
Â 
I am tiring of the show, I think D and D are missing it, and getting worse.


Â 

	Spoiler I believe its about human beings tend to destroy/harm those who are weaker then themselves.
This scene is only there to get the audience familiar with a tyrion's obsession with certain topics: Why did he kill the Beatles | Where do whores go? 


					
					
							Edited by Northern_Star, 02 June 2014 - 08:27 AM.
1450	Turncloak_	2014-06-02	3/10 some very good parts that I liked (Jorah getting banished, moles town attack, Jon-Grenn-Edd-Sam-Pipp party, Roose and Ramsay, Theon taking Moat Cailin for Ramsay, Sansa becoming a player) overshadowed by the butchery of one of the best fights in the books along with some cringe worthy filler (Missandei/Greyworm, Tyrion/beetles)
1451	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	Does anyone have any idea why so many of the shows this season are very far under 60 minutes? Â It seems strange.
1452	Rashtibram	2014-06-02	Â 
Cuddling for human companionship does not equate to sexual tension. Besides in the books Missandei is no more than ten years old when freed and a little too young to be involved a consensual eunuch/slave romance.


I think the implication was definitely that they're doing it for sexual pleasure. Also, this isn't the books. Show Missandei is at least around 18.
1453	BeornJ	2014-06-02	9/10.
Â 
Judging by some of the other comments I think I am in a pretty good position, I watched the first two seasons before picking up a book, then read all of them before the third season. I look forward to scenes but I don't obsess over some details like some fans seem to. Not that there is anything wrong with that but I sometimes it may detach you from what's going on in the show.
Â 
For example, 'only cat' to 'your sister', it's such a tiny tiny change and yet a few people are devastated with it because they've read that scene over and over for years, and have stated it's one of their favourite lines, and have written essays on littlefinger and catelyn and sansa and the vale. Change seems heretical.
Â 
Anyway, what I'm getting at is that I was really looking forward to the duel, I even reread the chapter a few times and read on the forum what people were expecting. Even with all that expectation, I loved it. I thought going into it there was two things they had to do well: the brute power of the mountain versus the agility and skill of the red viper, and the red viper's very complex mixture of cool arrogance and vengeance. I think they nailed both.
Â 
I was surprised the poison wasn't hinted at but I don't mind, I thought Tyrion might throw up but the change was fine. Sansa change was very unexpected but did not feel unnatural or uncharacteristic.. well... perhaps a little...
Â 
Littlefinger being unprepared was uncharacteristic.... but I felt like in the books the absolute ease he was able to pin the murder on Marillion seemed unrealistic.
Man I'm rambling... anyway.... very good episode

1454	Ran	2014-06-02	Cas,It's budgetary.Basically, the seasons that have huge set pieces -- aka "Blackwater", "The Watchers on the Wall" -- tend to have resources saved up by reducing running time.Seasons that are less focused on huge set pieces -- like last season -- are given more run time per episode (remember, they even made a point about how we got "almost an extra entire episode" across the season because each episode was 2-3 minutes longer than season 2).

Â 
Thanks.
Â 
But, I have to say, that doesn't make much sense to me. Â Why couldn't they just make existing scenes longer then? Â That wouldn't cost more.
Â 
I suppose that kills my conspiracy theory that they've gone through and cut out over the top sex scenes and violence against women as a result of the sept debacle though. Â LOL.
1456	Gvn2Fly	2014-06-02	That's how Oberyn died in the books, with his head gruesomely crushed in.Â 


Â 
That's not how the poster imagined it in his head so the show sucks. LOL
1457	Lord Ledford	2014-06-02	A very impressive 9, literally inches away from a 10.
Â 
Everything in the Vale was outstanding. I know some people will complain that they're rushing Sansa's change, and muddling the character a bit, but I don't. That last scene with her coming down the stairs was one of the moments of the season.
Â 
Tyrion's beetle story was great.
Â 
Emilia Clarke handled Jorah's expulsion very well.
Â 
Not yet sure how I feel about the whole Grey Worm romance.
Â 
Dialogue still just leaves that little bit to be desired...

1459	Master and Commander	2014-06-02	A solid 2.
1460	lakin1013	2014-06-02	Rated it a 6. Â Fight was good, but Dany did not manage to act the utter betrayal she should have been feeling about Sir Jorah. Regarding the scenes with Missandei and Grey Worm - who cares? Â Arya is NOT going to identify herself to get into the Vale (meant to say - the guards are not going to announce her? Â nobody will get her name?)? Moat Cailin did feel rushed. Â I am uncertain how I feel about the Sansa scenes. Â Unlike others though, I did like the whole beetle discussion. Â So I gave it a 6.

Â 
It's apparently a metaphor for the senseless death in the series; that is, that one can't understand it no matter how hard one tries.
Â 
It was a shit scene and if that is what they were going for, it's pretty lame.
Â 
Gave the ep a 6/10. The duel was enjoyable, Sansa was cute, and Roose/Ramsay were great, but the rest... eh. Too much filler.

1463	basilisk312	2014-06-02	i can't go higher than a 7... the good parts, sansa and overconfident oberyn, were very good, but (as others have stated) i see nothing good from the grey worm arc nor from the failure to mention the reason for the viper's name (or the lack of mention of poison on the spear)
1464	David Selig	2014-06-02	Terrible episode IMO. So much pointless filler and plain dumb moments. That beetles scene was the most boring 4 minutes of TV I've watched in years. Why is the show wasting so much time on really minor characters like Gilly and Grey Worm?
Â 
Sansa's scenes were good, the rest were mostly a waste. 4/10.
1465	Velociraptor	2014-06-02	This episode was weak. Filled with unnecessary things from the very beginning. The whole Gilly in Molestown seemed like a stupid idea from the very first, but at least I was hoping it would lead to interesting consequences that depart from the books. I should have learned from the example that was set by previous episodes- of course it didn't! As per usual, the writers make a departure from the books and then seems like they don't have the balls to follow through with the consequences, so they make up some silly situation which brings the things back on track, and renders pretty much the entire setting to pointless filler. It's as if someone on the writing team suddenly said "wait, guys, this is a poor idea, let's scrap that" and they did.Â 
Same issue with Jorah receiving his pardon several years late. He actually already received his pardon back in season 1. Why would another arrive so late? Well, the simple explanation would be the writers going "oh shit, we totally changed that and created a butterfly effect, but now we have to get things back on track with the book, so let's write around the things we changed. Hopefully, no one will notice the plotholes!". Granted, the very dismissal scene was powerful enough, thanks to Iain Glen's great acting and even Emilia Clarke managed to show what remotely resembled emotion. So I guess I could pardon that.
What I couldn't pardon, however, is the absolutely pointless thing that is the Missandei/Grey Worm romance. I mean, really? Seems as though they were just filling the amount of tits per episode quota, perhaps as an apology for skipping out on Daenerys' sex scene in the last episode. Which I didn't mind, because Missandei is gorgeus, but afterwards we're given a conversation that is so clichee, it's cringeworthy. Such scenes serve no purpose other than to cater to the shallow watchers, either those who watch the show for the tits, or watch it to get teary eyed at cute romance couples.Â 
Â 
The Jaime/Tyrion conversation started out well enough- I just love the scenes between these two. This is what you do, when you make a change from the books- if you're gonna have Jaime in King's Landing earlier, you give him more scenes with Tyrion, which works out very well, since both are amazing actors. On the other hand, the conversation about beetles dragged on for FAR too long. Consequently, the trial felt rushed. More about that later.

I did like the entire Theon and the Boltons sequence, especially how they showed Roose. The show needs more scenes with him, seeing how many non-book readers I know have a hard time grasping who the guy is at all.Â 
Â 
Now the thing everyone's been looking for- the trial. Well, the combat itself was done well enough. Skipped out on realism in favor of cinematic spear spins and leaping around, but I guess I can live with that- movies and tv shows always overexaggerate combat scenes. But the whole thing felt rushed nonetheless. I wish they had taken several minutes out of unnecessary scenes (like scrapped Missandei/Grey Worm romance) and added that to the trial characters- more dialogue, more exposition, more crowd reactions, more everything.Â 
Â 
All in all, I felt like this episode was very lackluster. While it delivers the sort of unexpected gutpuncher ending as has become the series' trademark in both the books and the show, it failed to deliver in nearly every other scene. I would rank this a 4 out of 10. To me, this was the weakest episode this season by far and quite possibly the weakest episode in the series altogether.Â
1466	Sir Lem	2014-06-02	This was a 7 for me. not a bad episode, certainly one of the good ones, but some things fell short for me.
Â 
The "Could have been betters":
I didn't feel that excited by the storm of the wildlings in the beginning. I am a bit weirded out by the Grey Worm thing, is it really necessary? I guess I can dig the idea of creating more dramatic depth amongst the minor characters in the Eastern Storyline, but this is just contrived.Â 
Â 
The "Awesome":
I was happy with what they did with Jorah's exile, glad they got Selmy to be the whistle-blower after all, though this whole thing was handled much better in the book. Â I'd like to see Dany reflect on the three betrayals a bit after this. Â The Moat Cailin stuff and Ramsey's boon was cool. Â The fight was excellent. Â I loved the TV version of Prince Oberyn and even though I knew what would happen from the book, I wanted to see him live (though I suppose I would have trolled if he did, lol). I'm happy to see Sansa being given a bit more competence, even at the risk of canon.

1467	westerosifitness	2014-06-02	Here we go
Â 
Missandei and Grey Worm: 4/10 - The only reason I'm giving this filler any good points is because I like the Grey Worm actor's performance. Its filler and fan service, but its not entirely boring. Just pointless. Would rather spend it on a plotline that will actually go somewhere
Â 
Arya & the Hound: 5/10 - Points go to the Hound's performance. This is one of the couples that reminds me I'm watching a TV show. There is no reason the Hound would let Arya talk down to him like that. He would punch her. The only reason she can is because the audience thinks it is super-cute when Maisie Williams acts all tough and says things that little girls don't normally say. Arya is unaffected by the Red Wedding and is a peppy, cute little girl, until the story needs her to go back to her character arc, like with killing Rorge. I also see Maisie more than I see Arya every time I watch her
Â 
Sansa and Petyr: 8/10 - Obviously, there were a lot of change-ups with these scenes, but you know what? They worked. I don't think it really changes anything drastically for Sansa to reveal herself. The Lords Declarant promised not to tell nobody, which is poor writing's way of saying "we're covering our butts with this stupid plothole by having characters act in ways they would not in real life" but I don't care because those scenes were awesome. The Eyrie has been my favorite setting in the season so far. Sansa and Petyr are great on screen with each other.
Â 
Dany & Jorah: 4/10 - Ughhh, Emilia just has lost her stuff. She is awkward. My bro, an Unsullied, suggested, "They just need to keep her saying things in fake languages, because then she does a good job. With normal english she's weird." And he's right. Those scenes were awkward and lacked 'oomph.' Also, I want to see Barristan use his damn sword. All I think about when watching him is that the actor probably is so horrible wielding a sword that they don't let him have a fight scene, so it makes his character kind of a joke. The Unsullied probably think heÂ isÂ past his prime.
Â 
Boltons: 9/10 - I only take a point away because I don't think Reek is a good enough Reek. He looks exactly the same. They made his armor a little big for him but that's it. The Moat Cailin scene was pretty good, Ramsay was good. I don't like their take on Ramsay, but the actor does a fine job and I'm not going to criticize him for the casting. I actually cheer for him, which isn't the best but at least he's entertaining to watch. At least he has personality, unlike the lead character mentioned above ^.
Â 
Big Dumb Scene: 2/10 - Now, we get to the big dumb scene where Jaime and Tyrion talk about a handicapped kid for 7 minutes of showtime in a boring dungeon. Why did they decide to do this ham-handed analogy for the Game of Thrones instead of having an intimate scene between the Viper and Tyrion? I don't know, but I don't think it pays off. The only points go to the brotherly connection that the actors were able to convey. That was touching.
Â 
Teh Duel: 9/10 - Finally, Teh Duel! Teh duel was very good in terms of excitement, and was enjoyable to watch. They kept it lighthearted up until the end. I would have liked more time between Tyrion and Oberyn, as addressed above, but w/e it didn't happen no use complaining. Ellaria is more vibrant on the show than in the books and that's a good thing. I felt for her at the end. Oberyn was so good with the audience. I will only gripe that they could have SLOWED DOWN. Seems like every "big" scene this season has been somewhat rushed. I don't understand copping us out of minutes every episode. More buildup to the duel would have been nice. It felt somewhat like they were trying to get through it quickly and I don't know why they would do that.
Â 
Anyways, I think that's everything. I gave it an 8/10 for overall enjoyment. Hopefully everyone thinks this is a fair and relatively unbiased review.
Â 
Love these forums
1468	Coeur	2014-06-02	The cousing killing beetles is the GRRM himself, and the characters are the beetles. I don't know, if it was screenwriters joke, maybe we will know someday.
1469	fuem	2014-06-02	1
Horrible just Horrible.Â
1470	BlackTalon	2014-06-02	I loved the episode - my first 10/10 this season. At first I chose 9 because of the WTF beetle scene but I have read some comments over on WiC net and they really made sense. Some pretty subtle writing. And I just can't get over Sansa coming down that stair, holy smokes ...
Â 
I get the impression some people here would find watching Harry Potter more enjoyable ...
1471	Brother Walfrid	2014-06-02	1 of 10 -- although I feel bad giving it the same rating as episode 4, as this was clearly better, a solid 1.5, but I just couldn't justify giving it the gentleman's 2 (D).
Â 
Moat Cailin was excellent, and most of the Eyrie was great (this episode could have been a '2' if LF and Sansa had rehearsed *something* first and had it fail -- that would have made Sansa's save more believable). Â Also, why does Petyr ask Sansa if she knows what he wants -- he told her exactly what he wanted in episode 4. Â And it's exactly what Sansa thinks it is. Â This would have been a great time to have Sansa 'seduce' Petyr (what I think will happen in TWOW).
Â 
Everything else pretty much blew. Â I guess the combat would have been ok if I hadn't already read the books, but regardless, if you are going to name an episode after two people having a duel to the death, please make sure to add some sort of suspense. Â If the audience (extras who get paid to watch) look bored, that's not a good sign.

1472	Hodor knows	2014-06-02	Â People seem to throw around 9s and 10s like lollipops on Halloween these days. I just don't get it. I gave it a 5/10.
1473	Beric175	2014-06-02	Well, since Ran gave it a 6 I sort of have to give it a 9 because I had the complete opposite reaction to him and Linda. This is one of the best episodes of the whole show for me and I didn't find the editing of the fight distracting, I don't have a problem with wushu being used as inspiration for Oberyn's fighting style (it's flashy and confident and hence it works or that character)Â and I got what they meant with the Orson scene, which the review did not even really bother to approach from a metaphorical perspective. I also have no problem with the Sansa and Arya changes. yeah, so no real complaints from me. I like the acting, the cinematograpy and that's that then.
1474	Queen of Whores	2014-06-02	People seem to throw around 9s and 10s like lollipops on Halloween these days. I just don't get it. I gave it a 5/10.

Agreed. According to my IMDb profile, I've only rated 14 things a 10... ever. And Game of Thrones doesn't even begin to approach their level of quality.
1475	BuggerThemAll	2014-06-02	9/10! -1 because of the beetle speech. Loved everything else!
1476	jentario	2014-06-02	I think it was a great episode, though I expected more. The pre-duel scenes were clearly cut down- the preview shows Ellaria saying "You're going to fight THAT?", which probably follows with Oberyn saying "I'm going to kill that." I am sad that they cut that from the show, it was a cool line. Another missed opportunity was having the Mountain chop apart the squire... Aside from that the fight was really good. It felt a bit impersonal (where in the books it was all about Oberyn) which is a shame but it was still epic and awesome and Pedro said his lines from the book and the end was equally gruesome as the book.
Moat Cailin was perfect thanks to Alfie Allen, he is just a great actor. The lack of a Victarion mention is noted, and I think this is very bad news to Greyjoy fans (though not a solid confirmation).
I actually liked the Sansa stuff. It's an interesting, albeit different direction from the books. I want to know where it's going and if it will line up with the books or go to a completely different place. That said, we won't know until TWOW comes out since D&D have run out of material here. Sophie aced it, and the rest of them were also great.
I think Arya's scene was hilarious and I am pretty certain that they will follow up on it with Littlefinger. The trailers show the Hound clashing swords in the Vale, and we haven't seen that yet (also Rory teased the biggest battle he's ever done in a later episode). So my guess is Littlefinger sends men to get Arya, the Hound kills them and Arya leaves him for dead. I was expecting the fight to be here, tbh... A bit disappointing (but not nearly as disappointing as the Rorge "fight scene").
On to the beetle scene... I agree it was too long, and didn't really hit the intended mark. I would have preferred a scene between Oberyn and Tyrion where they talk about poison. Too little Oberyn in this episode...
Then there's the Jon scenes which everyone's avoiding for some reason. They were great! The attack on Mole's town was nice, Gilly and Ygritte were cool. The follow up conversation between Jon's entorouge was good. I kind of wish the episode would have set up the battle better, though.
Grey Worm and Missandei was great and I think I know where they are headed with this. Playing the long game. The Dany and Jorah scene was really well acted, so it's a plus too. Visually, this was a great episode all around, but there are a few disappointments here and there that I listed.
Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that the ratings on this site are purely from a reader perspective. This does not reflect the true quality of the show since we know where it's going and think we know where it's supposed to be going. Only the Unsullied can give it a fair, untainted grade. I would give it an 8, but I gave it a 10 to help against other reviews that were way too harsh to be honest.
Our scores will always be harsher than the truth, because the books will always be better...
I am now hoping for a bombastic last two episodes. Two straight tens is the least I will take from D&D! lol

1477	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-06-02	Solid 9. Â Sansa is playing "the game," Â Arya's lol, Ygritte's moment of compassion, Dany acting like a dragon should, Ramsay being Ramsay, a clever foreshadowing thanks to LF, Tyrion and Jaime making fun of the mentally handicapped, and an amazing 1v1 medieval duel, choreographed to perfection, ended with gruesome perfection.
Â 
I tried to prepare myself for Oberyn's death. Â Not the fact that he died, but how he died. Â It was gruesome reading it. Â Seeing it? Â Well, you can't un-see it! Â The duel was executed masterfully, almost verbatim. Â Oberyn, all cocky, showing off to the crowd, determined for vengeance. Â The Mountain, looking completely badass in dark plate and mail with his greatsword, ready to kill whoever he's told to. Â Seems there's a lot of hate on how short it was. Â It's not like it's a heavyweight bout between two boxers NOT named Mike Tyson. Â It's a 1v1 medieval duel between two warriors trained to kill and determined to kill the guy in front of them as quickly as possible. Â I'm no scholar, and wasn't alive back in the Middle Ages, but I'm pretty sure a fight like that wouldn't go much longer than 5-10 minutes on average.
Â 
I loved the scene of Jon and Co. discussing Mole's Town's pillaging and Gilly's fate. Â If the Night's Watch had a dodgeball team, those are my guys. Â Jon, Grenn, Edd, Pyp, Sam the Slayer. Â Jon as Captain, and don't underestimate Sam, he killed a White Walker after all!
Â 
Moat Cailin looked amazing...for a 7000+ year old decrepit, albeit, still useful fortress surrounded by hostile swampland.
Â 
I've read a lot of hate for the Grey Worm/Missandei scene. Â Don't know why. Â I know it was filler, but Grey Worm is an awesome secondary character, both in the books and show, and it was a well acted scene that made you feel for Grey Worm (even if he barely has feelings) and realize that even though he is Unsullied, he is still a man (at least on the inside). Â And, oh yeah, some nice boobs.
Â 
The only thing that kept it from being a 10 for me is the Hound and Arya's scene where he just announced to the world that "Hey, here's Arya Stark, the biggest milk box/amber alert child for the last few years." Â Don't know where they go from there.

1478	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	8. Some changes will keep them needing to dig themselves out of plot and logic holes, some things I'd have liked and some flaws but very entertaining, I imagine reveals that were amazing for non-readers, interesting Sansa changes and some awesome acting
1479	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-02	- the preview shows Ellaria saying "You're going to fight THAT?", which probably follows with Oberyn saying "I'm going to kill that." I am sad that they cut that from the show,t.
.


Â 
Â 
Be sad no longer!
Â 
It wasn't cut from the show.
1480	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	I also want infinity DVD deleted scenes with Oberyn or Jaime in them
1481	jentario	2014-06-02	Â 
Â 
Be sad no longer!
Â 
It wasn't cut from the show.
Hmm. I missed it? No way!
1482	Pure Guava	2014-06-02	Just for shits...
Â 


Â 
Dark Queen Sansa, so ham-fisted.
Arya's reveal, and the sinking feeling that the next time we see the Hound and Arya they'll be trudging back down the high road unmolested with no one think that maybe they should inform Robin Arryn or Petyr Baelish.
The endless Orson speech.
The heartfelt promise that he wouldn't die, telegraphing that he was indeed going to die.
It just was not good at all.
For what should have been the most memorable fight scene in the novels, they turned in something that was, frankly, forgettable up to the final moment.


Â 
Loved it.
Her laugh was worth that entire scene
Loved it.
What.
Yes it was.
I honestly can't remember the fight from the books. So let's talk about defining the word "forgettable" for a second. Because I'm fairly certain I'll never forget that scene from the show.
1483	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-02	Hmm. I missed it? No way!


Â 
Oberyn - Today is not the day I die
Cue - Mountain enters stage right
Ellaria - You are going to fight that?
Oberyn - I am going to kill that.
Mountain approaches the dais
Ellaria - He is the biggest man I have ever seen!
1484	Ran	2014-06-02	Cas,
Every minute of film put on the screen costs a certain amount. Some minutes cost more than others,, but still, they all cost. Lets say a 54 minute episode costs $6.5 million. That gives the per minute cost of an average scene as $120,000. Shave two minutes from that episode and, depending how you do it, you could in theory save $250,000. Across 10 episodes, that's $2.5 million that you could choose to pour into a single marquee episode (ala The Watchers on the Wall)
1485	Hedge Lawyer	2014-06-02	I voted an 8, rounded down from 8.25.
Â 
The Meeren, Eyrie, and duel scenes were fantastic. Â The Moat Cailin scene was also well done.
Â 
I could do without the Grey Worm love subplot. Â The beetles conversation was entertaining and well acted, but probably should have been shortened in the editing process.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Hedge Lawyer, 02 June 2014 - 10:16 AM.
1486	jentario	2014-06-02	Ran, the scene was far from forgettable. That is really unfair. It's not as good as the book- true, but my Unsullied friends all around are saying it was really really good and that they still see the image in their heads of his head exploding.
Take the goggles off for a moment... It really wasn't THAT bad. It's probably the show's best fight scene yet. Could have been better, but could have been a whole lot worse.
1487	The Faceless One	2014-06-02	I gave another 10 for the duel alone. Â It was the one scene I've most looked forward to this season. Â It's been years since I read ASOS, but I thought it was well done and followed the book for the most part, minus the Mountain hacking up the front row with wild swings. Â I am sad to see Oberyn go. Â Pascal did an amazing job bringing the Red Viper to life. Â By far my favorite character this season. Â I echo others' disappointment with his nickname being left out, but hopefully they follow the books and include the poison's effects later on in the storyline.
Â 
I can understand the disappointment with the Grey Worm/Missandei storyline from a purist's standpoint. Â Although, I didn't pickup sexual tension between them, rather a feeling of love from Grey Worm. Â Love for someone who treats him as a person and not just a killer/warrior. Â As far as Grey Worm admiring her naked, you don't have to have your meat and two veg to admire beauty. Â They are going to have to add some filler to replace things left out from the books(not necessarily a good thing) for the obvious fact that they are catching up to George and his writing. Â Just go with it and learn to separate the books from the show. Â Life sucks if you let everything disappoint you. Â 
Â 
The Jorah dismissal was serviceable, but seemed a bit rushed. Â 
Â 
The beetles dialogue is another dilemma for book purists. Â Very fitting for the show, but not the books. Â In one instance, it shows the senselessness in most instances of killing and tries to justify or reason why they wage war and kill. Â In the end, even a simpleton has the basal instinct to kill and destroy. Â It's human nature and defies reason. Â In another instance, it highlights the truisms and oddities of what comes to mind when one is faced with imminent death.
Â 
I thought the Eyrie was well done. Â Well acted. Â I especially loved the double entendre between Sansa and Baelish. Â "I know what you want." Â 1. He wants her. Â 2. He wants her to marry Robin and he can control the Eyrie as an advisor, as well as gain its protections from King's Landing. Perv time...Sansa(Sophie) looked smoking hot in the black dress in her last scene.. Yowza! Â  Â Arya and the Hound was a bit of a left turn from the books, but you can definitely tell his wound is starting to fester. Â I did like Arya's hysterical laugh when, once again, the Hound misses his payday.
Â 
Mole's Town and the Wall...meh. Not bad, not great.
Â 
Moat Cailin was good, but seemed a bit rushed and it's a bit unsettling that they are leaving out a lot of the Pyke/Iron Islands story up to this point. Â There is still plenty of time in seasons 5 and 6 to involve them in the storyline or at least include the interesting and important plot lines from the books. Â I liked seeing the flayed fella. Â Bolton living up to his family motto.
Â 
Boltons/Winterfell scenes were well done and it was a bit haunting to see Winterfell again.

1488	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	Ran, the scene was far from forgettable. That is really unfair. It's not as good as the book- true, but my Unsullied friends all around are saying it was really really good and that they still see the image in their heads of his head exploding.
Take the goggles off for a moment... It really wasn't THAT bad. It's probably the show's best fight scene yet. Could have been better, but could have been a whole lot worse.

I thought it was a damn good fight scene, could have been 2 mins longer
1489	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	I gave another 10 for the duel alone. Â It was the one scene I've most looked forward to this season. Â It's been years since I read ASOS, but I thought it was well done and followed the book for the most part, minus the Mountain hacking up the front row with wild swings. Â I am sad to see Oberyn go. Â Pascal did an amazing job bringing the Red Viper to life. Â By far my favorite character this season. Â I echo others' disappointment with his nickname being left out, but hopefully they follow the books and include the poison's effects later on in the storyline.
Â 
I can understand the disappointment with the Grey Worm/Missandei storyline from a purist's standpoint. Â Although, I didn't pickup sexual tension between them, rather a feeling of love from Grey Worm. Â Love for someone who treats him as a person and not just a killer/warrior. Â As far as Grey Worm admiring her naked, you don't have to have your meat and two veg to admire beauty. Â They are going to have to add some filler to replace things left out from the books(not necessarily a good thing) for the obvious fact that they are catching up to George and his writing. Â Just go with it and learn to separate the books from the show. Â Life sucks if you let everything disappoint you. Â 
Â 
The Jorah dismissal was serviceable, but seemed a bit rushed. Â 
Â 
The beetles dialogue is another dilemma for book purists. Â Very fitting for the show, but not the books. Â In one instance, it shows the senselessness in most instances of killing and tries to justify or reason why they wage war and kill. Â In the end, even a simpleton has the basal instinct to kill and destroy. Â It's human nature and defies reason. Â In another instance, it highlights the truisms and oddities of what comes to mind when one is faced with imminent death.
Â 
I thought the Eyrie was well done. Â Well acted. Â I especially loved the double entendre between Sansa and Baelish. Â "I know what you want." Â 1. He wants her. Â 2. He wants her to marry Robin and he can control the Eyrie as an advisor, as well as gain its protections from King's Landing. Perv time...Sansa(Sophie) looked smoking hot in the black dress in her last scene.. Yowza! Â  Â Arya and the Hound was a bit of a left turn from the books, but you can definitely tell his wound is starting to fester. Â I did like Arya's hysterical laugh when, once again, the Hound misses his payday.
Â 
Mole's Town and the Wall...meh. Not bad, not great.

Tyrion specifically uses his nickname and wonders how he got it. Episode 10, Gregor (and let's hope Tywin) is gonna find out
1490	jentario	2014-06-02	And there was definitely poison on his spear, for those worrying about it. David Benioff said so in the Inside the Episode.
1491	Juan_Snow	2014-06-02	I thought it was a damn good fight scene, could have been 2 mins longer


I re-read the duel on Saturday to get it fresh in my mind and I was a bit surprised by how short it was. Â For some reason over time in my head it was nearly an entire chapter. Â So I wasn't really surprised by the length or even really consider it to be too short. Â For an adaptation I thought they completely nailed it.
1492	Juan_Snow	2014-06-02	And there was definitely poison on his spear, for those worrying about it. David Benioff said so in the Inside the Episode.


Apparently the squire rubbing down the spear with a cloth should have looked at the camera and said "Poison" while nodding to his work.
1493	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-02	Apparently the squire rubbing down the spear with a cloth should have looked at the camera and said "Poison" while nodding to his work. 


Â 
Or they could have, you know, done it like book and have Tyrion warned not to touch the blade?
1494	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	Or they could have, you know, done it like book and have Tyrion warned not to touch the blade?

In the show everyone could clearly hear everything everyone else in the Arena was saying. If Oberyn had done that, I'd be asking why the hell Tywin let him fight with a spear he just admitted was poisoned to teh huge audience around him
1495	The Monkey	2014-06-02	This is rather fascinating, the episode has been extremely well received by both critics and fans everywhere except for this forum.Â 
Â 
As for me, I gave it an 8 out of 10. All great stuff, except for the Grey Work/Missandre romance. Where the fuck are they going with that? The duel was superb, but I really missed Oberyn's line "You will say her name before the end, or I'll haunt you through all seven hells".
Â 
EDIT: The beetle speech from Tyrion also felt way overdrawn and protracted when I first saw it, but on second thoughts maybe it had a metaphorical meaning that I was unable to grasp on my first watch.

1496	amaterasu	2014-06-02	I liked this episode very much, this is why I rated it with 9/10. There are several scenes I adored and, overall, I believe the episode was very well made. Even though the beginning is, perhaps, a little boring (compared to our possible expectations: to be read â<U+0080><U+009D>fight in the first seconds of the episode, please!â<U+0080><U+009D>), I do think that every unsatisfactory sentiment towards the matter has been erased at the end of the episode. Oh, and what an ending!Â 
I thought in the beginning that I wasn't going to find out anything about prince Oberyn in this episode, and was disappointed because of it -however, I was glad to find out in the end that the episode WAS still about the fight between Oberyn and Clegane, the Mountain. After seeing their fight and finishing the episode, I concluded more or less happily that this was a splendid episode.Â 
Â 
Now, let's explain why I liked the episode.Â 
First and foremost, I loved the fight -Â the duel between Clegane and Oberyn. I expected to see/watch something quite overwhelming, and the show didn't disappoint me in that. I found myself hating the author, hating the show, hating everything after Oberyn's death (as I kept him as a very dear character, and liked him very much, hoped he wouldn't die). After recollecting myself, I realised I loved everything about it: it was so well made. I liked Oberyn's show before the duel, I loved the way he duelled, even though his death would have been avoided if he wasn't so arrogant, so conceited (but, hey, that's the thing I liked about him in the first place, besides his handsomeness and accent). The Mountain played his role flawlessly, the beast, the killing machine, the mad man - compared to Oberyn, he was indeed a horrible beast (the contrast was amazing). I liked the way they fought and I would love to re-watch it, but I am afraid the disturbing way in which Oberyn died is too much for my heart. It was stupendous (stupendous is such a freaky word, I just think the fight was exciting, even though I felt extremely sad after Oberyn's death *sob/sob*)
Cersei's smile, claiming her victory with a perfect expression. I dislike Cersei - I always have, but what I must say is that the character in itself deems, sometimes, some sort of peculiar respect. She is a strong character, maleficent, ugly, yet she doesn't fail in shinning and getting whatever she wants. This time, as well, we could all see her triumphant smile, glad the Mountain killed Oberyn, glad she would finally see the IMP die. I really, really dislike Cersei (and like Tyrion, as a matter of fact), but I have to admit that I loved (and hated) that smile -it was just realistic and it pointed out perfectly Cersei's character, desires, plans, etc. It was a very good moment, I believe.
Â 
Arya Stark's laughÂ was... insanely refreshing, somehow. I loved the way she laughed - I wondered whether she laughed at the irony of her life (everyone is dying, look, the aunt died as well, isn't it funny?) It was refreshing in an insane way because it could not possibly be positively refreshing: i wonder if she wanted to take it as a joke. I am curious about the next episode regarding her outcome ( I really don't want her to end up â<U+0080><U+009D>underâ<U+0080><U+009D> Baelish's â<U+0080><U+009D>wingâ<U+0080><U+009D>). However, even though Arya's appearance was too poor in this episode, because of her few appearances, she played her part flawlessly (as far as I am concerned, she is one of my favourite characters, but I am afraid to confess, we just know how the author kills everyone).
Â 
Sansa's comeback,Â or should I say â<U+0080><U+009D>Sansa's re-inventionâ<U+0080><U+009D>. I am not sure about this, though I liked how she started to lie about Lysa's death - don't like either of them, so I didn't really care about it, but it is a nice turn of events and I am curious about how rotten Sansa can become (I have huge expectations with regard to this matter -maybe if she becomes rotten enough -and overcomes her stupidity- maybe then she will be at least interesting, and not only annoying). I liked the way she lied, yes, because for the first time in her life, she didn't bore me or plainly annoyed me. Period
Â 
Ser Jorah's dismissalÂ and prince Oberyn's death were the saddest and best moments of this episode, as far as I am concerned. I like Jorah and don't want him to leave Khaleesi's side -but I guess he has to, and I really wonder what he is going to do. I loved the scene because he had very nice expressions, and Dani was so bitchy with him that the entire moment was worth it. What can I say, I felt like crying then because I presumed Jorah would get either killed, either pardoned and ignored - but no, even worse than that, he was dismissed to return to his â<U+0080><U+009D>mastersâ<U+0080><U+009D>, to King's Landing. Somehow, I thought this to be much more tragic than getting killed or ignored. I am already missing him - I think it was a very important detail in this episode.Â 
Ramsay Snow becomes Ramsay Bolton, isn't that something we should be celebrating? I like this character's twisted mind (and expressions) and, overall, I believe he does a very good role. I like him, therefore I like the moments in which he appears - it was somehow interesting to be given the name of his father (finally!) - the moment wasn't so important, I suppose, but I do think that some important things might come out of this. I think this is one of the moment when we fully understand his character and his power of driving others mad (look at poor Reek, past Theon Greyjoy, a toy in a Snow's hands... isn't he the little, twisted fellow?). It wasn't much compared to other episodes, but I think it was an important moment.

(and AGAIN Â the Mountain killing Oberyn - one of the most disturbing scenes in the entire series (I was... overwhelmed).

Petyr Baelish hadn't had any interesting scenes in this episode -I like him because of the... complexity and simplicity of his character, he is a moron, and I am really looking forward to his death (which I don't think will come any time soon - I am not reading the books, it is just a mere wish one has. He has such a nice face, it would look good on a spike). I also want to see how Robin is going to â<U+0080><U+009D>evolveâ<U+0080><U+009D>. I have my presuppositions regarding his fate, but I will keep any other comments for myself for the being moment.Â 
John Snow didn't appear much in this episode and I wasn't moved by Sam's sentimentalism. What moved me was the other guy's speech (i don't know his name, the one who poured the wine and said that whoever dies last, should be a good fellow and burn all the others). I am curious about how the Night Watch is going to react when/if the wildlings attack them (looking forward to this - the scene when the wildlings killed those people didn't move me, as it was expected, but I liked how Ingrid didn't kill Sam's (girl)friend and her child. That was, perhaps, a good sign -at least an interesting one).
Â 
Liked the episode, though the duel was the biggest hit of the episode - it's what made it so great.Â
1497	Frey Pies	2014-06-02	This is rather fascinating, the episode has been extremely well received by both critics and fans everywhere except for this forum.Â 
Â 
As for me, I gave it an 8 out of 10. All great stuff, except for the Grey Work/Missandre romance. Where the fuck are they going with that? The duel was superb, but I really missed Oberyn's line "You will say her name before the end, or I'll haunt you through all seven hells".


Â 
The IMDB board doesn't seem too fond of it too- though the average score it has received is 9.9, so the voting public seems to like it just fine.
1498	Princess Rhaenys	2014-06-02	8 out of 10.
Â 
I was so excited for this episode my hand were shaking the entire time. I must say I don't feel as satisfied as I hoped... Biggest letdown for me was the beatle talk.. I mean why was that necessary? It wasn't even funny or interesting, and it took away far too much time from the fight. The fight was good, oh man, them feels 
Â 
The Sansa speech was a nice plot twist for me, I was wondering how they would do that. But even I believed her story hehe. That look on Petyrs face, priceless.
Â 
Arya laughing was great. I don't really mind the Grew Worm-Missandei story, but they did stretch it too long I think. The attack on mole's town... I don't know, we all know by now what the wildlings are capable of.
Â 
I hope to see Tyrion throw up but I guess you can't have everything
1499	King Tyrion I	2014-06-02	10/10
Just awesome. 
Loved the whole episode.
1500	The onion wight	2014-06-02	There are posters who'd give a GoT episode a nine or ten if they broadcast a blank screen. Anyhoo I gave this weeks effort a seven.
Liked anything north related, like the Bolton scenes, they're much more prominent than in the books and rightly so. Just disappointed that when Ramsay got all mushy after Roose legitimized him Roose didn't turn around and put him in his place with THAT line.
Sansa scenes OK, like how they're going with her character but unfortunately by making LF look like a pussy.
Jorah being banished, what's her name playing Dany couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, she has one expression and my God she's going to use it! But the actor playing Jorah was as usual excellent and he just about saved it.
BIG disappointment for me was the dual. Damn that sucked arse. It was too short and mostly consisted of the Red Viper performing silly ballet dancing in cut aways and twirling his spear around a lot. It was bloody silly. The whole point of the scene, which I thought they were going to show after making a big deal out of Oberyn going in with light armor! was the difference in speed and reach! but nope the Mountain was felled by a guy piercing plate armour with a wooden spear. Fuck me!
So all in all a slight meh. Not bad but could have been better. Almost unforgivable how they messed up one of the greatest Mano o Manos in fantasy literature and let's hope for better next week.
1501	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-02	In the show everyone could clearly hear everything everyone else in the Arena was saying. If Oberyn had done that, I'd be asking why the hell Tywin let him fight with a spear he just admitted was poisoned to teh huge audience around him


Â 
Indeed. It is also why he didn't address the entire crowd in the books when he said it. It was as an aside in the far more dramatic build-up that was missing.
1502	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	What the hell did people who didn't rate the duel want from it that it could be any better?
1503	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-02	Also I thought Emilia nailed Dany this episode
1504	jentario	2014-06-02	This is rather fascinating, the episode has been extremely well received by both critics and fans everywhere except for this forum.Â

The Sons of the Harpy kill Missandei's brother in the books. They might kill Grey Worm instead!
1505	Maester Blaester	2014-06-02	I liked the episode a lot. Â As others have said, I was anticipating a longer duel, but looking back on it, it probably does seem about right. Â My favorite part of the episode was with reek/ramsay (always seems to be my favorite parts when they have screen time). Â I just think those two work together really well and probably because it's my favorite storyarch. Â 
Â 
Anyways, 8/10! Â
1506	raj34	2014-06-02	This is rather fascinating, the episode has been extremely well received by both critics and fans everywhere except for this forum.Â

Â 
LOL you new around here?
1507	jentario	2014-06-02	What the hell did people who didn't rate the duel want from it that it could be any better?
After watching it again, the only thing I feel is missing is that part from the books where the Mountain accidentally hacks at bystanders when rushing at Oberyn. But yeah, it was great! I take back the non-personal thing.
And I agree Emilia nailed Dany
1508	sj4iy	2014-06-02	7/10
Things I liked:
1. The Duel:  perfectly done, horrifying ending.
2. Sansa is now a player:  love the change from the books, she finally is her own person after 4 years.
3. Arya's laugh:  encapsulates everything about Arya and the Hound's trip through Westeros.
4. Jorah's banishment:  was done well.
Didn't like:
1. Missandei/Grey Worm's budding romance:  seriously, I just don't care at all.  Really, I don't.
2. Molestown attack: why didn't they evacuate it?  I mean, Night's Watch men were clearly there, so it wasn't as if they couldn't have been warned at some point.  Needless death.

1509	Tywin's bastard	2014-06-02	A bit up and down but the main thing that lingers with me is Oberyn. Pedro Pascal has been amazing in this role and has really brought life to the character in that way that a tv show (or a movie) can do better than a book - if the actor is up to the task. It's been a bit different but that's fine by me as a good book will always tell a longer story better so I'm happy with getting to experience this story in a different way, so it's not just an inferior version. The death of Oberyn touched me more than I thought it would and that's all due to the presence that Pascal has brought during this season. Well done.
Â 
As for the mentioned thing about he signaling his death by saying that he's not going to die, that's no different than Tyrion and Jaime doing the standard build up of the seemingly insurmountable threat so the victory will be "surprising" and even sweeter. So I don't buy that the show told the ending in advance.
1510	The onion wight	2014-06-02	Did anyone get what the beetle conversation was about? It was like, well the simple kid was crushing insects and shit, Tyrion REALLY wanted to know why he was crushing insects and shit and then it was decided no one knew why he was crushing insects and shit. Deep...
1511	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-06-02	For all the Beetle haters...
Â 
Would you rather have 10 minutes of Tyrion eating bacon and sausage and applecakes, and a double helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers?
Â
1512	Ran	2014-06-02	That was 4 minutes of conversation. Oberon and he could have had a very illuminating conversation in the same span of time, as well. Breakfast optional.
1513	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-06-02	Did anyone get what the beetle conversation was about? It was like, well the simple kid was crushing insects and shit, Tyrion REALLY wanted to know why he was crushing insects and shit and then it was decided no one knew why he was crushing insects and shit.

Â It was a metaphor for all the senseless acts of mass atrocity that humans commit. Wars and murder. What is it all for, in the end?
1514	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-02	That was 4 minutes of conversation. Oberon and he could have had a very illuminating conversation in the same span of time, as well. Breakfast optional.


Â 
Or with Elaria. I'm sure that many people still feel Elaria is only some hot woman he was banging, not the mother of his four daughters and beloved companion.
1515	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	What I wanted was Red Viper and Ellaria together alone for a couple of aminutes...Pedro Pascal has killed it as this character and I would have rather seen him given more screen time on his last episode than the hugely rambling beetle deal, or the nice and sweet but not important Grey Worm and Missandrei seg.
1516	Samwell TarIy	2014-06-02	10/10, The whole duel was amazing and everything leading up to it was awesome, the beetle scene should him been shortened though.
1517	Zajebisty	2014-06-02	Wow...I can't really believe what I just witnessed (on screen and on here)
Â 
I don't want to really offend anyone but Im absolutely shocked the number of people who gave this episode 9s and 10s. I mean if you gave this episode a 10 then I guess if someone (excuse the crudeness) took a dump on the screen you would give this a 10 as well.
Â 
I'm a big fan of this show and this season has been VERY surprising to me in it's quality (in a good way after the lackluster last season and season 2). Its been very good and certainly there have been a few episodes which I would rate as 8 or 9 (the only 10s from me would be in Season 1 and EP9 from Season 2). This episode had so many cringe worthy scenes it was unreal. I mean it started off with the belching whore and just went downhill from there. Its like 2 am here so I'll try to keep this brief but I'm just so disappointed having waited two weeks and getting this pile of crap.
Â 
Grey Worm love story was just so bloody awful. I was getting flashbacks of Jon and Ygrette, it was that bad. The directing was as if the person had no clue. What was up with those extreme close ups of Jorah's face in the throne room scene? Is Emilia Clarke made of wood? How can one call that acting? So so so bad. And those cuts from Dany to Jorah and back and forth when he is kneeling...I am just lost for words how butchered that scene was.
Â 
Now to show I am not biased some things were good. The Boltons were quite good as was the Moat Cailin scene. Naked Missendei was absolutely fantastic...the woman is a goddess. But of course was spoiled with the cuts back to Grey Worm's expressionless face. The duel was fairly good but the guy playing the Mountain was terrible. Season 1 Mountain was by far the best of the bunch...kinda funny they used 3 separate actors.
Â 
This episode should be called Close Ups and Cringe Worthy Scenes (I challenge someone to count the number of close ups on faces). I give this an extremely disappointed 2...and from the previews for next week it looks like its more of the same unfortunately.

I also think this season is a BIG improvement over seasons 2 and 3.
Â 
I thought this episode was okay, it wasntr fantastic, like Episode 1 was, it was kind of jumbled, had a few too many things going on and I thought the Viper was short changed. Â But, it wasn't terrible. Â I gave an 8, but then the worst rating I think I have given is a 5.

1519	The onion wight	2014-06-02	10/10, The whole duel was amazing and everything leading up to it was awesome, the beetle scene should him been shortened though.

Sorry can't let that slide. The duel was terrible. The Red Viper was pulling Darth Maul moves mixed with a touch of Bruce Lee. The mountain just stood there watching him prance around with his guard down. More prancing about and then he stabs him. Apart from the dialogue the scene was completely at odds with the books, not that this is necessarily a bad thing but it just came over as over theatrical and staged.
1520	Lord Jibblejab	2014-06-02	I gave it a 7 or 8.
My opinion of it fluctuated multiple times throughout watching it, but overall, dat's some good TV rite thar.
I thought the duel itself was just as powerful as it was in the books, honestly. My only qualm was it could have gone on longer, but it DID have that nice "back-and-forth-what's-going-to-happen-oh-god" quality, and Oberyn yelling out and pointing to Tywin really gave me goosebumps. Also, it was nice to see some real skill at arms on the show for once!
Vale scenes fluctuated a lot. Although I like the route the book takes with the singer Marillion far more, I thought Baelish's lies and apparent lies-through-Sansa were great. The fluctuation happened when it was revealed that Baelish really WAS lost without Sansa, and it was she who came up with the lies. Maybe D&D know some things about Sansa in Winds of Winter and how under-handed she'll become, but they should NOT explore this at the expense of Baelish's character. They made him look lost and incompetent. This was my biggest criticism of the episode.
After a lot of thought, I've decided the Theon/Reek scenes were good. Alfie Allen really is amazing. Oh, and seeing an ironborn being TOUGH for once in Ralf Kenning was nice. The reason why I didn't come to love the Theon scenes initially was because I thought it was too damned fast. In an episode exploring the love life of Missandei and Greyworm and the plight of beetles, it felt cruel to have it cut between negotiation and flaying so quickly. The scene in the books, where Theon has to drink himself through the Ironborn screams beside the hounds, was REALLY powerful, and I wanted that here.
Â 
Theon scenes this season in general have a tendency to annoy me, because of how the show kept Theon around through seasons 3 and 4 rather than having him disappear after season 2 and come back in season 5. Now, rather than having a hugely powerful and concentrated storyline with season 5, starting with a powerful reveal moment where you realise this character is still alive... we have the more diluted take on it which the show is doing. Uggh. It just feels like such a disservice to one of the greatest characters in the book. If you're only going to have him appear every 2 or 3 episodes, at least give his scenes more focus/length than some other bits of filler in the episodes. (Yes, I realise it's probably because D&D realise that a lot of the TV audience hate Theon/Reek and don't want to see him too often... but honestly... forget those guys! )
Â 
Moving on, what REALLY surprises me is people here who disliked Jorah's dismissal and described it as "lacking emotion". That scene was the surprise highlight for me, and it almost got a tear from me. And the music, as ever, is incredible. I loved that scene.
Â 
And yeah, the beetle scene. I really liked the point of it, but it just went on for far too long.

1521	Prince of the North	2014-06-02	Â It was a metaphor for all the senseless acts of mass atrocity that humans commit. Wars and murder. What is it all for, in the end?


Exactly! Â Tyrion was marveling at how Orson could take such delight in destroying all those beetles and it was a metaphor for how people in general will destroy things simply because they can and to make themselves feel more powerful. Â I think it's a metaphor for the game of thrones itself, for the endless pursuit of power for power's sake that so many in Tyrion's world seem to be caught up in.
Â 
As you say - what's it all for in the end? Â And will it mean anything when the cold winds blow and the White Walkers come?
1522	The onion wight	2014-06-02	I gave it a 7 or 8.
My opinion of it fluctuated multiple times throughout watching it, but overall, dat's some good TV rite thar.
I thought the duel itself was just as powerful as it was in the books, honestly. My only qualm was it could have gone on longer, but it DID have that nice 'back-and-forth-what's-going-to-happen-oh-god' quality, and Oberyn yelling out and pointing to Tywin really gave me goosebumps. Also, it was nice to see some real skill at arms on the show for once!
Vale scenes fluctuated a lot. Although I like the route the book takes with the singer Marillion the most, I thought Baelish's lies and apparent lies-through-Sansa were great. The fluctuation happened when it was revealed that Baelish really WAS lost without Sansa, and it was she who came up with the lies. Maybe D&D know some things about Sansa in Winds of Winter and how under-handed she'll become, but they should NOT explore this at the expense of Baelish's character. They made him look lost and incompetent. This was my biggest criticism of the episode.
After a lot of thought, I've decided the Theon/Reek scenes were good. Alfie Allen really is amazing. Oh, and seeing an ironborn being TOUGH for once in Ralf Kenning was nice. The reason why I didn't come to love the Theon scenes initially was because I thought it was too damned fast. In an episode exploring the love life of Missandei and Greyworm and the plight of beetles, it felt cruel to have it cut between negotiation and flaying so quickly. The scene in the books, where Theon has to drink himself through the Ironborn screams beside the hounds, was REALLY powerful, and I wanted that here.
Â 
Theon scenes this season in general have a tendency to annoy me, because of how the show kept Theon around through seasons 3 and 4 rather than having him disappear after season 2 and come back in season 5. Now, rather than having a hugely powerful and concentrated storyline with season 5, starting with a powerful reveal moment where you realise this character is still alive... uggh. It just feels like such a disservice to one of the greatest characters in the book. If you're only going to have him appear every 2 or 3 episodes, at least give his scenes more focus/length than some other bits of filler in the episodes. (Yes, I realise it's probably because D&D realise that a lot of the TV audience hate Theon/Reek and don't want to see him too often... but honestly... forget those guys! )
Â 
Moving on, what REALLY surprises me is people here who disliked Jorah's dismissal and described it as "lacking emotion". That scene was the surprise highlight for me, and it almost got a tear from me. And the music, as ever, is incredible. I loved that scene.
Â 
And yeah, the beetle scene. I really liked the point of it, but it just went on for far too long.
Â (also 'dis is my first AFOIAF post hai guys!)

The problem with keeping Theon in stasis for 2 seasons is that Alfie would go off and commit himself to other projects, I.e. they might potentially lose him. Contracting actors will be a big consideration for how they develop the characters.
1523	Juan_Snow	2014-06-02	Sorry can't let that slide. The duel was terrible. The Red Viper was pulling Darth Maul moves mixed with a touch of Bruce Lee.


Â 
You and I describe terrible things much differently.
1524	Frey Pies	2014-06-02	Wow...I can't really believe what I just witnessed (on screen and on here)
Â 
I don't want to really offend anyone but Im absolutely shocked the number of people who gave this episode 9s and 10s. I mean if you gave this episode a 10 then I guess if someone (excuse the crudeness) took a dump on the screen you would give this a 10 as well.
Â 
I'm a big fan of this show and this season has been VERY surprising to me in it's quality (in a good way after the lackluster last season and season 2). Its been very good and certainly there have been a few episodes which I would rate as 8 or 9 (the only 10s from me would be in Season 1 and EP9 from Season 2). This episode had so many cringe worthy scenes it was unreal. I mean it started off with the belching whore and just went downhill from there. Its like 2 am here so I'll try to keep this brief but I'm just so disappointed having waited two weeks and getting this pile of crap.
Â 
Grey Worm love story was just so bloody awful. I was getting flashbacks of Jon and Ygrette, it was that bad. The directing was as if the person had no clue. What was up with those extreme close ups of Jorah's face in the throne room scene? Is Emilia Clarke made of wood? How can one call that acting? So so so bad. And those cuts from Dany to Jorah and back and forth when he is kneeling...I am just lost for words how butchered that scene was.
Â 
Now to show I am not biased some things were good. The Boltons were quite good as was the Moat Cailin scene. Naked Missendei was absolutely fantastic...the woman is a goddess. But of course was spoiled with the cuts back to Grey Worm's expressionless face. The duel was fairly good but the guy playing the Mountain was terrible. Season 1 Mountain was by far the best of the bunch...kinda funny they used 3 separate actors.
Â 
This episode should be called Close Ups and Cringe Worthy Scenes (I challenge someone to count the number of close ups on faces). I give this an extremely disappointed 2...and from the previews for next week it looks like its more of the same unfortunately.


Â 
See, there are probably many more people, including me, who are shocked by the amount of 6,7 and 8s it's getting on Westeros.org (many of us think that it deserves a 9 or 10). People are always going to have different opinions, bro- that statement of yours was kind of an extreme overreaction Â
1525	Lord Jibblejab	2014-06-02	The problem with keeping Theon in stasis for 2 seasons is that Alfie would go off and commit himself to other projects, I.e. they might potentially lose him. Contracting actors will be a big consideration for how they develop the characters.


Â 
Yeah, I can appreciate that I suppose. I just can't help but whinge about it anyway
1526	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-02	For all the Beetle haters...
Â 
Would you rather have 10 minutes of Tyrion eating bacon and sausage and applecakes, and a double helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers?
Â 
 


Â 
10 minutes at any point showing there was actually an army coming to the Wall might have been nice. Hell, even 1 minute. Ever.
1527	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	Â 
10 minutes at any point showing there was actually an army coming to the Wall might have been nice. Hell, even 1 minute. Ever.


Â 
I've thought that was kind of strange also, we know they already shot the army, so I have been expecting something from the Mance camp here or there the whole season.
Â 
I wonder, are the TV only viewers going to be like, who is this guy again? Â
1528	JaimeTheBoy	2014-06-02	A good episode let down by a few moments:
Â 
1) Petyr had no plan, which is completely out of character. There is o why he would rely so much on Sansa. It just slightly undermines how exceptional he is at playing the game if he needs a 13 year old to stop him from being killed.
Â 
2) The Mereen scenes are exceptionally dull (the Jorah scene was good) but the pointless Grey worm missandei relationship is taking valuable screen time away from important plot points and characters.
Â 
3) Leaving the scenes that everyone wants to see until the end of the episode is very frustrating. It works when some of the other scenes are before are exciting and develop the plot, but in this case it felt very cheap. Of course i understand the need of putting the duel at the end but another scene explaining the vipers reputation or anything relevant in kings landing would have been good. The best actors are all in kings landing they should make the most of it.
Â 
Overall 6/10Â
1529	Zachary Snow	2014-06-02	i liked tyrions musings about his cousin it was an analogy about the gods and how they smash people, the only thing i didn't like was how they changed sansas arc.... little finger had the whole thing planned out sansa didn't save him, i didn't like how they changed that and i wasn't a fan of the grey worm missandei scene either... in fact danaryes whole arc is even worse in the show than it was in the book. Â oberyn saves the episode once again!!! amazing acting and they did the duel very well i will give the episode a 9Â
1530	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-02	Â

Â 
I wonder, are the TV only viewers going to be like, who is this guy again? Â 


Â 
To me, they have missed some perfect opportunities - Bran and co could have had some dramatic moments as they had to pass Mance's outliers and scouts. They could could have even been captured and have the whole Brandor thing happen then instead of Crasters. Similar to Jon's expedition - again would have been valuable information about this army that is coming 'eventually'. Now we are going to have 100,000 people suddenly arrive and the audience is supposed to be engaged in the issues and characters?
1531	Serr Parker	2014-06-02	9 for me
Â 
Let down only by the length of the duel, normally I don't complain because of the time constraints of the season, but after all the useless crap we had to sit through to only have the trail being only 7-8 minutes? No thanks.
Â 
What time they did have was great though, managed to really get the viewers into think Oberyn was going to win, for a time I was thinking 'hold on they're actually going to have him win this'.
1532	The onion wight	2014-06-02	A good episode let down by a few moments:
Â

Â 
Overall 6/10

Too be fair TV Sansa is obviously not a thirteen year old....yowsa! But I agree turning LF into a clueless easily manipulated pussy was a waste of a perfectly good evil genius. They've murdered that character, not quite as badly as they have Stannis but still it's gut wrenching to watch.
1533	Targaryen loyalist	2014-06-02	The Duel: 10/10
Â 
The Rest of the Episode: 4/10
Â 
Sandor&Arya at the bloodgate, the GreyWorm-Missandrei bromance, the beetle speech... A lot of questionable choices...
1534	The onion wight	2014-06-02	It was a metaphor for all the senseless acts of mass atrocity that humans commit. Wars and murder. What is it all for, in the end?

But the whole point of the show, and the books, is that acts of mass murder are not senseless. It's about people grasping for power and wealth. About religious fanaticism and scary ice men bringing down Armageddon. People kill for reasons, bringing up a belaboured metaphor about a simpleton squishing some beetles left me like wuh? Maybe he meant God is a simpleton and we're beetles or something or maybe an allusion to how pointless death is, but to tell the truth I just thought it was a filler scene to fit Tywin and Jamie into an episode. Also Charles Dance has been SERIOUSLY underused this season, for shame.
1535	The onion wight	2014-06-02	You and I describe terrible things much differently.

It's fair enough if you like cheesy martial arts films mixed with a dash of Bolshoi, I swear the stunt double pulling those moves was a ballet dancer, but I was left wondering why the fuck the mountain didn't just step up and cut him in two while he was pulling those stupid moves. Each to our own I guess..

Â 
Kinda like this?

1537	Serr Parker	2014-06-02	Also seen a lot of people complaining that there was apparently no poison, how do you know?Â 
Â 
The second spear maybe it hasn't but we won't know for certain till later, it's not like there blatantly going to show it either
1538	SJB	2014-06-02	Pretty solid episode with a couple of flaws. Enjoyed it.
Â 
Molestown and the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch: 7/10Â Decent set up for next week.Â 
Â 
Missandei and Grey Worm: 9/10 I really liked this although it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t in the books. I disagree Â with the people saying this is useless filler and just another love story. This is a guy that has been a slave for his entire life. For the first time in his life he is starting to feel something for someone with this same kind of horrible history. Then he comes to realise that these feelings are useless because he has been cut. Hard to imagine how this must feel. Â 
Â 
Ramsey/Reek/Roose scenes: 10/10 Just amazing acting,Ramsey Show becomes Ramsey Bolton.
Â 
Vale stuff: 7/10 This scenes had some highs and lows, as other people already pointed out. I like the fact that Sansa is becoming a player. I personally think that Book Sansa was a bit slow on this part. I liked the acting. I hated the fact that they make Littlefinger look like a guy without a plan tough, and the dark Sansa coming down the stairs was over the top.
Â 
The Dismissal: 6/10 It was alright and better late than never.Â  That being said it felt out of the blue and rushed. Besides that watching Emilia felt awkward. The guy who plays Jorah did a good job. Â 
Â 
Arya/Hound: 3/10 This was just weird. The reaction of the guard when he hears Arya Stark is standing in front of him is just off. He simply replies by telling her, her aunt is dead. Where are they going with this? Also, the 2 seems to bond way to much if they are planning to go with the story as it is in the books. I liked the laugh at the end. 
Â 
Jaime/Tyrion: 7/10 The scene itself was great. Great acting, nice metaphor. I kept looking at the clock tough. At this point in the episode I just wanted to see the duel or maybe a Oberyn/Tyrion, Oberyn/Ellaria conversation. I think I will rate this scene higher on a rewatch, when I can sit back and enjoy rather than waiting for the duel. 
Â 
The Duel: 8/10 Loved it. Especially the end. I expected it to be longer though, and missed some face expressions from relevant people in the audience.
Â 
In total thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a 7 for me.
1539	Serr Parker	2014-06-02	Â 
Missandei and Grey Worm: 9/10 I really liked this although it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t in the books. I disagree Â with the people saying this is useless filler and just another love story. This is a guy that has been a slave for his entire life. For the first time in his life he is starting to feel something for someone with this same kind of horrible history. Then he comes to realise that these feelings are useless because he has been cut. Hard to imagine how this must feel. Â 


Â 
It's not that I think it's useless filler, everything on the show has a purpose, it's just that with only 10 hours a season to work with, and so much material that doesn't get used it just seems like a waste of time, each to their own I guess though
1540	Steve Stark	2014-06-02	"I noticed something funny today about the name 'Oberyn Martell'. There's no eyes."
Â 
Best thing I've read all day. har har!
Â 
The book reader in me gave it a 6, the show watcher in me gave it an 8. I averaged that out to a 7.
Â 
Fight was better than I thought it would be and fun to watch, but still the Mountain didn't....feel right? (I don't know, I guess this image of the Mountain didn't do it for me, hard to explain). Tyrion looked legitimately terrified/nervous, and Dinklage acted wonderfully as normal. Mormont's acting was superb as well. I'm still not into the Thenns...it's simply too much for me. They look cool and everything, but they are supposed to make their own weapons and...well...they're just so different than they are in the books that it's sort of insane. I normally don't complain about differences in the books and the show, but this change is too over the top for me to really enjoy.
Â 
Still good TV.
1541	JonBranRickon	2014-06-02	I thought it was excellent because it developed Sansa beyond what the book has been able to do.
1542	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-06-02	But the whole point of the show, and the books, is that acts of mass murder are not senseless. It's about people grasping for power and wealth. About religious fanaticism and scary ice men bringing down Armageddon. People kill for reasons, bringing up a belaboured metaphor about a simpleton squishing some beetles left me like wuh?

Also Charles Dance has been SERIOUSLY underused this season, for shame.


Â Well, the show depicts a lot of people grasping for power and wealth, but I'm not sure we are led to one conclusion or another yet about how senseless it is. Countless thousands have died fighting for power and wealth for a small minority, and over half of those small minorities have been defeated. But the god aspect may play a part in the metaphor too.
1543	mickyd	2014-06-02	Long time lurker, first time poster.
Â 
my vote says why.
Â 
4.Â  Lowest score I would have given any other episode.
Â 
Last 15 minutes were stunning, the previous was the worst I've seen of the whole series.Â  That coming from one who has understood and accepted deviations as a necessary evil for a TV adaptation. I don't question the deviations themselves, just the manner of them.Â Â  Bran and Craster's Fort was well done. Bran's book story arc might not translate well to TV however Episode 8 was not, and gives me great fear that would could and should be the single greatest episode, and was my favorite section of the books, the attack on the wall will be butchered. Not from a purist standpoint, but simply a rational one.Â  The track record on how they have done the wall does not hold promise for next week capturing what the book made so engrossing and my personal favorite.
Â 
IMO This episode had more WTF moments than I've counted in any episode.Â  Got off to a bad start.Â 
Â 
I suppose someone forgot to tell Mole Town there were Wildlings south of the wall and coming that way.
Â 
Major WTF's with Arya/Hound.Â  It was cute at first, the chicken sceen was hands down my favorite sceen of the series so far. However it has now it has become a real distraction the farther they creep from the book,Â  Ayra is thought to all but a VERY few to be dead. At this point everyone could and should know she is alive.
Â 
I read much here about the Grey Worm and Missandei (I know my wife reads this forum, but let me say... WOW!Â  I could be a Unsullied and findher of interset lol)Â  It itself not bad, minor character developement is not bad, but when it is contrary to the book AND at the expense of what could be facinating character introduction and exposition true the books, that is where I worry about the future direction the series is taking.
Â 
Just my two cents! Looking forward to the last two episodes!
1544	Nictarion	2014-06-02	Also I thought Emilia nailed Dany this episodeI did too. The Jorah exile scene was probably the best part of the episode for me. I know a lot of people criticize her range, but the scene were she was doing Missandei's hair was a good contrast to her throne room scene imo.
1545	RhaenysBalerion	2014-06-02	WHAT. THE. FUCK.
Â 
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Â 
okay, 7...Â
1546	SJB	2014-06-02	Â 
It's not that I think it's useless filler, everything on the show has a purpose, it's just that with only 10 hours a season to work with, and so much material that doesn't get used it just seems like a waste of time, each to their own I guess though


Â 
I understand that and tend to agree. I just wanted to point out that the concept of an eunuch ex slave starting to get feelings for another ex-slave while slavery is a big part of Dany's arc isnt HBO trying to reach the tit quota as some have stated here.
1547	Panther2000	2014-06-02	I gave it a 9.Â Â  when actually it should have been a 8 or maybe, 8.5.Â Â  The thing that brought it down for me was the Greyworm & Misandei/ Misandei & Dani stuff.Â Â  They could have used those few min toward the Battle.Â Â Â Â 
Â 
I hate to say this, but Dani has been getting on my nerves sense season half way through season 2 ( same for the books).Â  Both her acting & her character period.Â Â  I just think that her story doesn't translate well from book to screen ( same can be said for Bran, though bran's story is still much better)
Â 
Everything else I think was good.Â Â Â  The wall was the build up toward next week.Â Â
1548	A Redeemed Hound	2014-06-02	Changed my vote from an 8 to a 7 due to a lot of sloppy and stupid writing. Â "Why did you save me?" Peter asks Sansa? Â Really? Â Like he would have just put his life in her hands? Â Easily could have had him tell her something like "You did great out there. Â Just like we rehearsed." Â After he kills Lysa, he had all the time in the world to come up with a plan with Sansa. Â And if Sansa announces she is not Alayne, why not just give it all up and tell everyone that Peter is a murderer and even plotted the death of John Aryn who was their beloved protector?!?!?! Â She would have been just as safe since they all know she is a Stark now anyway. Â SLOPPY and really stupid.
Â 
And then the Hound and Arya. Â The Hound is the most wanted man in Westeros. Â Arya is one of the most sought after people as well since she is still a missing highborn. Â So why would The Hound say who he is? Â Why would he be so dumb and say who is with him out in the open like that? Â He is supposed to be smarter than that. Â Nobody in their right mind would allow them to just turn around and leave so I can't know how that is going to go. Â Especially if word got out that Sansa Stark has been hiding in the Eyrie too. Â That was a scene that should never have been. Â SLOPPY and really really stupid.
Â 
Should have had much more with Theon and the Ironborn. Â Should have made that more detailed. Â My parents (non book readers) thought they just killed that one guy and the rest were freed or something. Â SLOPPY and WEAK.
Â 
I also agree with a lot of people that they are dropping the ball with Jon Snow and the Wall.
1549	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-06-02	i'd give it a 9.5. the only thing i didnt like was the beetle speech.
1550	830SnowinHawaii	2014-06-02	Anyone else feel that by stretching out the storyline at the Wall to the extent that they have, that Ygritte dying is going to lack the major impact it had in the books? She's been in 2 scenes all season, and even as a book reader, I had pretty much forgotten about her until last night.
1551	Ran	2014-06-02	500 votes, 8.09 average, 9 median, 8.33 normalized average.
1552	BarriStannis	2014-06-02	Solid 9, acting was great all around, really liked the beetle speech between Tyrion and Jaime & the duel was phenomenal.Â
1553	Paid the Iron Price	2014-06-02	I've to give 1.
Everyone tellin the fight scene was good. Well it was bad. Could not really find anything positive in this other than the ser Jorah's scene.
The beetle scene itself was so bad that even the little + there will not save this episode.
1554	The Dragon Prince	2014-06-02	I'm still trying to get over what happened. Oberyn was AWESOME!!!! He became one of my favorite characters in the show. I've got to remember not to get attached to characters in this show. lol
1555	taipan	2014-06-02	Might as well have made it the last episode. Not much else left to happen in this series.
1556	MoIaF	2014-06-02	I did too. The Jorah exile scene was probably the best part of the episode for me. I know a lot of people criticize her range, but the scene were she was doing Missandei's hair was a good contrast to her throne room scene imo.

I loved the restraint fury in her.  At first she's all calm waiting to listen to him explain himself and as she realizes or accepts that his information put her child in danger you can see the dragon waking.  She keeps it together but is to disgusted with him to even look at him.  I thought it was well done and well acted.
1557	Rashtibram	2014-06-02	I'm honestly surprised by all the people claiming the beetle monologue served no purpose, or that they didn't understand its significance. After all the complaints about how over-the-top the show is, and how it spoon-feeds things to the audience, nobody seems to understand what's happening when they decide to throw in a (minor) dose of subtlety.
Â 
I suppose it has many interpretations, but I think the intended one was this: Orson represents the Gods who are supposedly judging Tyrion at his trial; the Gods who are responsible for the Red Wedding and all the atrocities committed in the show so far. And Tyrion was desperately searching for a reason for these atrocities, only to find that there was none, and that the Gods were simply handicapped people smashing beetles. An intelligent viewer might have analyzed that scene (and the delicious transition into the start of the Trial) and concluded that Oberyn was indeed going to be another smashed beetle, and that makes it extremely important in its own way. You can argue the metaphor was ham-fisted, but please stop postulating that the writers were only thinking "Duh, we like Nikolaj and Dinklage, let's give them a scene together becauseâ<U+0080>¦" when they wrote the scene.
Â 
ETA: About the duelâ<U+0080>¦I think they (and us) hyped it up far too much. It was never going to match expectations (at least not in the way 'Blackwater' and 'The Rains of Castamere' did). I do think they could have made a lot more out of it: added some appropriate music (the 'realism' vibe isn't something to strive for on this occasion IMO), made the cinematography more close-up and involved, shown Oberyn's growing rage and drive for vengeanceâ<U+0080>¦but these are all things IÂ wish I could have seen, and not things that were bad about what I saw. As such, being let-down doesn't equate to thinking the episode was bad. It was a great hour of TV, even by GOT standards. I place it 15th out of 38 on my ever-growing 'best-to-worst' scale, below 'A Golden Crown' and ahead of 'The Ghost of Harrenhal.'

1558	kissdbyfire	2014-06-02	After reading the posts here today I'd like to add two observations:
- the beetle scene: yeah, I don't like it. At all. But not because I don't get it. I don't like it because it feels forced and boring. I started playing sudoku halfway through it. And because there were better scenes in the books to be done in that huge amount of time - yeah, + - 4 mins is a lot, imo.
- I can't for the life of me understand why so many people have a problem with Emilia Clarke's performance. I think she does a great job. I can't say if she's a great actor coz I haven't seen her in anything else yet, but I simply love her Dany. She doesn't overact, like so many others with the mouths and eyebrows and stuff, but that only makes her performances even more to my liking.

1559	Gannicus	2014-06-02	Pedro Pascal was great again. But as I feared, the fight didn't really translate well to TV. When a man is speared to the ground he's finished. The Mountain rising and bursting Oberyn's scuff with his hands is cartoonish. Still I have to respect that Pedro did what he could to save it.
It was great seeing Sansa take some control over her destiny although It does diminish Littlefinger a bit.
Beetles and another Hound/Arya left me feeling meh...

1560	tallTale	2014-06-02	I just wanted to comment on the Beetle crushing scene.
Â 
It's funny because I knew the main point of what Tyrion was trying to make right away-people/innocents die, there isn't always a reason other than because the weak get abused first, but because the scene lasted as long as it did, I tried looking for a deeper meaning. Of course the scene ends without a final conclusion from either character but I was annoyed that they tried dissecting something so simple for so long, thereby taking me along as a voyeur on their annoying extended trip.
1561	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-02	Might as well have made it the last episode. Not much else left to happen in this series.


Â 
 Good one!
1562	HelenaExMachina	2014-06-02	Torn on what to give this one. I enjoyed the duel and found the ending suitably brutal and gory, I don't really have any complaints on that front.
The Tyrion beetle scene could have been replaced by something much more relevant imo. Set up for next season, time with another character, something, anything but that scene. Bleh.
The Vale. Well, it was a hell of a shock to me and now I'm very divided. On the one hand, I agree with Ran that LF's character is very much diminished, it seems that he has literally no plan to get out of the corner he is in. I can see the logic behind it though, as getting across Sansa's subtle transition from innocent pawn to developing player that is shown in the books does not really make for good TV. This was perhaps a little too sudden, but I'm not terribly annoyed by it. I also want to say Royce and Waynwood were brilliant, they brought such a sense of nobility and superiority to the scene, and its immediately apparent that they are part ofÂ  proud, old, noble Houses. Lady Anya Waynwood was spectacular imo, this was a brilliant casting choice.
Daenerys banishing Jorah. Emilia's acting was better than I have seen her do any other time this season imo, though I wish she could have looked at Jorah just once. I can imagine they tried to get across how disgusted she was with him, so much that she couldn't bear to look at him...but it just didn't look right. That said, overall the scene was decent.
Moat Cailin was another good scene.
Not a fan of Mole's Town scene I'm afraid.
Arya and the Hound is an odd one. Have to see how they proceed with this one, but it seemed an odd way to go.
Missandei - Grey Worm I'm indifferent to tbh.
Â 
So...now I've typed it out I have a bit of a clearer idea...6 or 7. I will be optimistic and go with a 7
1563	TimEaston	2014-06-02	A slow burner of an episode until the climax such a shame that the Viper died I thought he had the Mountain.
Â 
I can't wait until next week.
1564	Ashas Globetrotter	2014-06-02	8. Which means it was a bit disappointing, being the most anticipated episode this season, thus far. As others, I wasn`t crazy about the grey worm/missandei stuff. Arya showing up at the Vale - hmmm, wonder what happens next? The beetle was a classic show-GOT monologue, far too long, like Gollums redundant raving to his reflection in the water in LOTR 3. Sansa as cruella de ville in her new black dress was..interesting. The whole scene should have been swapped with Tyrion vs the Viper- as in the book. Let us get a closer relationship with him, and let us believe he in fact will win-before he goes. ANd it would give us an extra scene with the great Pascal. The Duel was good, but not great. Should have lasted a copule of minutes longer. Showing the Mountain wearing out, and hacking down the stable boy. Oberyn a bit too elastic, and the Mountain could have depicted a bit more imposing and ominous ( by ways of filming, the actor is imposing enough).Â
1565	KingintheNorth99	2014-06-02	Solid 9/10
I actually liked the grey worm/Mel scenes, and Alfie Allen put in another great performance this episode, the only thing I disliked was Arya's laughing, I found it quite annoying and cringy.
The fight scene was great however and Oberyn's death was absolutely gruesome!
1566	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-06-02	9/10 loved most of it
1567	Ran	2014-06-02	548 votes, 8.12 average, 9 median, 8.33 normalized average.
1568	Robbie Hood	2014-06-02	dat deff scene doe.
1569	Ser Uncle P	2014-06-02	9/10. The Moles Town scene was crap. Roose/Ramsey was excellent.Â 
Grey Worm/Missandei could have been crap, but I thought it had dignified pathos. Viper/Mountain duel was too short,
1570	Ashas Globetrotter	2014-06-02	Â 
I thought Tyrion's story fucking dragged on, though. Â And I really didn't appreciate him and Jaime bonding over mocking a mentally handicapped person. Â Tasteless and uncomfortable to watch.
Â 


Oh my god.. you are watching a show where innocents are killed, raped, tortured and generally fucked over in every way, and you find this tasteless. After watching 4 seasons (and maybe read 5 books?), and seen what the characters are capable of, one wouldn`t think you excepted a personae of high moral standing. This universe strives to be realistic in terms of characters and actions, and I do not think, sadly, people in the middle ages had very high regard for the mentally challenged. Have you ever heard the term "the village idiot"? This type of double standard, sanctimonious political correctness is tasteless and uncomfortable to listen to. And very Amercian, I am sad to say.
1571	Ran	2014-06-02	Though, I do admit, I did find the "I love mocking disabled people, makes me feel better about myself" a bit at odds with his first season "I have a fondness for crippled, bastards, and broken things."One can of course be a hypocrite, and they're talking about when he was younger, but I wouldn't have minded if he made it plain that his feelings have matured a bit since he used to stare and laugh at Orson.

To be fair, many of this season's writers seem not to have read other scripts from this season, so expecting them to be familiar with material from season 1 is unrealistic. Â GOT is an episodic television series, not a movie, and the show goes to great lengths to make sure that we viewers do not need to remember details from previous shows (like character names). Â Had Tyrion's previous behavior been deemed relevant to his actions in this episode, I'm sure it would have been covered in a "previously on game of thrones" intro.
1573	Wolf Girl Arya	2014-06-02	I'd say 9.5, so I rounded it up to a 10.
Â 
I thought the fight scene was perfection. Â Ellaria's and Oberyn's screams hit me damn near as much as Cat's during the RW. Â Oberyn calling out Tywin in front of the entire court...I think it's the first time we've seen Tywin look genuinely nervous, which was priceless.
Â 
I, personally, enjoyed the Grey Worm/Missandei scenes. I'm almost certain this is setting up inevitable heartbreak, but I can see why it would feel out of place.
Â 
The Jorah banishment scene was excellent overall but could have used some better editing (hence the .5 drop).
Â 
My heart broke for Arya. Â I could totally tell that it was either laugh or have a complete mental breakdown at that point (nervous laughter is a thing). Â I'm sure the ramifications will be handled accordingly, but I don't think they could have just had Arya and/or the Hound just randomly say "eh, eff the Vale". Â It was a thread they needed to tie up and I'm sure they'll handle it fine.
Â 
Ygritte showing mercy to Gilly was freakishly uplifting and this episode needed that.
Â 
Holy crap, has Sansa come into her own! Plotting better than LF, making her dress her own, she is totally stepping into her role as a force to be reckoned with and it's going to be good. Â For those saying LF was lax in this episode, would never let Sansa do this, that or the other, well, think of Oberyn and what overconfidence got him. Â The same thing happened to LF with the Lords Declarant, only LF's consequences were less deadly (for the time being). Â I think this "coming into her own" has actually been set up very nicely this season. Â Not to mention she can always point out to LF how she got the Vale lords to her side and she could probably turn them against him if she so wished. Â That dynamic is going to be incredible next season.
Â 
The beetle speech I'm still pondering but I didn't dislike it. Â To me, it was more Tyrion wondering of why such awful things can happen and it could just boil down to it amusing some higher power or the other. It seemed appropriate, given what was on the line for him.
Â 
On the whole, everything was pretty much spot on for this episode. Â Some minor things could have been tweaked but on the whole, definately near the top!
Â 
Edit: Oh man, how could I have forgotten Alfie! He was amazing, as he has been pretty much the whole time. Â The Roose/Ramsay dynamic took on a whole new level as well. Â Everyone brought their A game this episode.

Â 
I thought my sarcasm and contempt for the quality control was obvious, so I didn't put a </sarcasm> tag, and I left out citing Battlestar Galactica Season 3 as the high point of effective writing for episodic tv.
Â 
So seriously -- I totally agree that the beetle scene just felt out of character, and that the showrunners (even if they aren't credited as writers for a specific episode) should have somebody checking for continuity.
1578	BearQueen87	2014-06-02	I gave it a 7/10.
Â 
I thought the duel was very well done, but it was left to the final 10 mins or so and before then was a very long talk about beetles. I understand the philisopicial questions behind the beetle conversation, but still it chugged on and on for too long.
Â 
There was a lot jam packed into this episode and it felt like we jumped around almost too much. I didn't need more Ramsey, Roose and Reek (not necessarily a problem with the show because I have the same issue with the book--Theon should have died at some point to spare us this storyline).
Â 
The wildling attack and the Wall bit was neccesary, I know, but stil took time away from other stuff.
Â 
While I knew the Jorah/Dany scene had to come at some poit (though I was praying it wouldn't) I was shocked that it came this episode, when more time should have been devoted to the duel and Tyrion's fate. However, Iain Glen is great as wounded Jorah.
Â 
I'll be upset if there was no posion on the spear. That's a missed oppertunity.
Â 
The Grey Worm/ Messandi scene felt out of nowhere. While I like their character generally, they are not why I tune in each week. It's problem ASOIAF has in general--too many characters and threads trying to be tied together.
Â 
Finally, I gained a bit of respect for Sansa this episode, who has always been one of my least favorite characters. I enjoy the fact that she might have the upper hand over LF.
1579	Pure Guava	2014-06-02	Heh. Funny stuff. This is the only place I can come to where I've felt pretty "meh" about an episode and everybody here is raving, then I'm pretty stoked and everybody here is...well...fuckin' beetle-hating. Only thing which really bothered me is the "Welp, it ain't 'Rains o' Castamere'Â  so it MUST be 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair' the only two goddamn songs in the history of Westeros!" and I'll admit I'm a bit perplexed as to what the heck they're going to do with Arya and the Hound from here...though I'd imagine something happens where they're threatened with captivity, they fight, get away, Hound gets injured, etc.
Â 
Definitely loved seeing Sansa In Charge 2.0, as this was a storyline in the books which I'd admittedly skim and am conversely wicked-excited about watching develop on the show.
Â

Â 
Unrealistic yes, but it was the climax to the whole scene, each moment getting more andmore intense. The squishing was a sort of literal release from the tension that was building for the last few mins.
Â 
I admit, I had to look away during that part. I knew Oberyn was going to die but once I realized what The Moutain was doing and that they were really going to show it, I had to look away.
1585	SweetJeyne	2014-06-02	A very impressive 9, literally inches away from a 10.
Â 
Everything in the Vale was outstanding. I know some people will complain that they're rushing Sansa's change, and muddling the character a bit, but I don't. That last scene with her coming down the stairs was one of the moments of the season.
Â 
Tyrion's beetle story was great.
Â 
Emilia Clarke handled Jorah's expulsion very well.
Â 
Not yet sure how I feel about the whole Grey Worm romance.
Â 
Dialogue still just leaves that little bit to be desired...


Â

Â 
This is the episode when the producers told us they know what happens in book 6 and we don't. And don't think they are messing with the plots on their own. GRRM is part of the team and the series is a lot better edited than the books are.Â 
Â 
The most important part was the reveal on Sansa which is clearly a plotline that is from book 6. Sansa is not going to be Baelish's toy. Will she turn into Arya II or Cersei II though? This handling of Lyssa's murder is much better than the books.
Â 
In the books we only find out about the venom after the duel. So I think we will find out about that next episode. when the Mountain does not heal.
Â 
Having Arya arrive somewhere too late makes a lot more sense than the pointless meanderings of the book. It also takes her in the direction of the sea and on to Bravos. Much more logical than the books again.Â 
Â 
Next season the whole Sansa plot line will be new. And they will be drawing in part from Book 6. Meanwhile other parts are still finishing book 3. Looks to me like we are looking at more than 7 seasons... I would guess 9. And thats not counting the fact there are likely 9 books as well.


I agree that this episode gave us intriguing indications of where Sansa's character is headed. And seeing a glimpse of the woman she'll become---which is what we see as she comes down the stairs---was chilling, in the best sense.
Â 
I do hope Sophie Turner is recognized come awards season, as well as Pedro Pascal

Â 
When he put his fingers in Oberyn's eyes, that was awesome (gruesome and horrible to watch - but that's the point). But when he squished Oberyn's entire head in.. that was just ridiculous in my opinion. Ah well..
1587	Khal-a-bunga	2014-06-02	Though, I do admit, I did find the "I love mocking disabled people, makes me feel better about myself" a bit at odds with his first season "I have a fondness for crippled, bastards, and broken things."
One can of course be a hypocrite, and they're talking about when he was younger, but I wouldn't have minded if he made it plain that his feelings have matured a bit since he used to stare and laugh at Orson.


Â 
Isn't it clear enough simply from the way we've seen his character behave these past four seasons? Isn't it clear based on the fact that the vast majority of us mature from when we were children?Â 
Â 
Also, it's funny that Tyrion has a moment where he appears not to be a 'white knight', and people on the boards attack him for it. Because, you know, threatening to rape your nephew (even as a jest) or having someone murdered are so much more palatable than a young Tyrion deflecting criticism against himself by doing the same thing to another person with an unfortunate disability...
Â 
Anyway, I thought it was a great episode. I don't run here and vote right after I've finished an episode, simply because I haven't given it any time to digest, and I find that I have to re-watch an episode (and consider it within the context of the season) in order to come to any conclusion regarding how I feel about it. Even someone who is as big a fan of the show as I am has a hard time completely separating what I see on-screen from what I've had in my head for such a long time.Â 
Â 
After said reflection, I have to say that this was possibly the darkest episode the show has done, or at least on par withÂ Garden of Bones.Â Even Arya's laughter - something I had initially laughed about along with her - can be seen as a very dark moment, given her situation: Once again arriving at her destination, only to find that the family member she had been heading towards was dead. And between our first good look at a flayed man, and Oberyn's death, it was also one of the goriest.Â 
Â 
Looking forward to next week.Â 
Â 
@Â Jaqen H'gcarl
Â 
Having worked in an emergency room in a fairly large city, I've seen some pretty disturbing stuff (not that you have to work in a city hospital to see that kind of thing). If one was strong enough (as The Mountain is), it isn't at all unrealistic that they could crush someone's head in such a manner. It has more to do with the structure of the human skull than anything else, but applying pressure in the right way could definitely lead to results similar to what happened to Oberyn.Â

They should have used that time giving more screen-time to Pedro Pascal which will be very missed. What saved the episode for me was the duel, Moat Cailin story line, the Vale and Jorah banishment.

Sansa's storyline is not simplified. IMO, it is improved upon. If that is the last we see of Sansa this season, then I'll still be immensely satisfied. I LOVED the Sansa we just saw.

Yep. Also, for those concerned that a "notorious killer wanted for Murder One & Treason" has now exposed herself, the timing of the show is going to handle this, I believe. KL is soon gonna be in a world of hurt, plenty broken, & knowing Sansa's general whereabouts, IF it is discovered, is definitely the LEAST of their upcoming worries. In fact, IF Show-Cersei wants to add this to Show-Jamie's laundry list in the Riverlands, fine...we know how he feels about Sansa.

GRRM seems okay with it, otherwise he wouldn't agree to write an episode each season.Â 
Â 
If you're TRULY a GRRM loyalist, you'd realize -- as he has -- that D&D has made him a richer man. Their ADAPTATION has spawned hordes of new readers, who would cease to exist otherwise.Â 
Â 
I'd never even HEARD of ASOIAF until I was walking around NYC and saw a cardboard ad of Ned on the Iron Throne. I tuned in, and the rest is history.Â 
Â 
To me, this seems eerily familiar to what happens in the music industry with a long-standing band. Fans are so fearful of being considered bandwagoners, that they feel compelled to cling to the earlier works without compromise--simply by default.Â 
Â 
Surely this is an imperfect analogy, but let me ask you this: If this episode was a "1", then what, pray tell, do you rate an 8-10 on television these days?
Â 
And if it's TRULY a "1," then why -- oh why -- would you continue watching and commenting on such an abhorrent piece of crap?
Â 
I'll look forward to your response.Â
1600	Hodor H'ghar	2014-06-02	I give it a 9. Everything about it was top notch. I deducted 1 point, because I really didn't dig the whole scene where Tyrion was talking about smashing the bugs, I just didn't get it.Â

I gave *this episode* a '1', not the season, and not the series as a whole. Â I didn't "officially" rank seasons 1-3, but I'd say my "average" impression of GOT is in the 7-10 range.
Â 
I'm not a professional reviewer, so I only watch programs I like, and I watch very little tv (<5 hrs week), and this is the only show I like enough to go to a web forum and discuss/rate. Â So, basically, any rating I give an episode is relative to previous GOT episodes and the few other shows I've watched in the last few years.
Â 
And as to D&D shitting on somebody's floor -- I don't disapprove of changes being made, and I have liked some of their changes, and other I haven't liked but understood why they had to be made, but overall, I find that the weakest scenes are ones that are solely the show's invention -- not because they are changes, but because GRRM is a better writer than the rest. Â D&D contracted for an adaptation, not general permission to write their own fanfic in GRRM's world, so I'm not interested in their "legacy" of stories they'd like to tell in his world, but in how well they *show* me the story I've already *read*.
1602	Flukeshot	2014-06-02	Most of this episode was forgettable for me because I really just wanted to see Oberyn wreck The Mountain, I love combat scenes where speed dominates power. I'm sad to see Oberyn go, he was yet another of my favourites that was killed off.
Â 
Here's a chronological list of my favourite characters:
Ned - Dead
Arya
Tyrion - About to be Executed
Jorah - In Exile
Drogo - Dead
Bronn - Marrying some dumb cunt
Jaime - One handed now
Oberyn - Jell-O-Head
Technically only Arya is left of my favourites.. Woe is me.
1603	Goldfinger	2014-06-02	Full of Crap
Very bad.
Emilia Clarke on everything Â 
Trial of LF..rubbisch.
Suicide, Sansa talking before Baelish even talking to her, just make him look stupid.
It was just to show that Sansa grow some balls?
Nice
Duel between Oberyn and the Mountain.
Amusing
TYRION
talking about the writer(s)!
-5
1604	Ondskapsmannen	2014-06-03	9
Â 
Great episode as usual, I have no complaints about any of it. I really don't mind changes from the books, because the books are their own thing same as the series.
1605	IlAovatar	2014-06-03	Having rewatched the episode now that i'm over the excitement of Oberyn's death, I think a 7/10 was too generous.
Â 
The duel itself along with the buildup beforehand really should have been a lot better than it was. I also think I gave too much praise for the Sansa/Littlefinger scenes. Sansa's speech to the lords of the Vale is excellent, but i'm bothered by how clueless it made Littlefinger look... and the scene where she comes down the stairs dressed in black and gives Petyr that look is a bit much. I'm surprised they didn't stick a thin black moustache on her face for her to twizzle. We get it, she's not a silly little girl anymore...
Â 
Aside from Theon's visit to Moat Cailin, which was perfect, almost everything else about the episode was poor. D&D really need to improve their writing if they're going to continue their fanfiction power trip rather than sticking to GRRM's material.

1606	Bonifer Tasty	2014-06-03	I'm getting better about not comparing to the books, but still, there was no reason for Sansa to say who she is really. Â But I like how they are treating her "awakening" to the game. Â I remain irritated that the Wall storyline has been so strung out, and don't like that they seem ready to unify the attack from the south and from teh north. Â  Not as exciting. Â  Â Give it an 8.
1607	VladimirDulud	2014-06-03	Â I agree I am a bit confused about why we are spending so much time on Greyworm, but there may be a justified reason, I'm not counting that as a negative yet.
Â 


Â 
Yeah. its clear that D&D know how the books end and that GRR may have something in store for these two.
1608	VladimirDulud	2014-06-03	I'm getting better about not comparing to the books, but still, there was no reason for Sansa to say who she is really. Â 


Â 
As Sansa, she retains her claim as a force in the North and her value (life) under Littlefinger's finger.
1609	mrlukeduke	2014-06-03	For me this was one of, if not the best, episodes of the last few seasons. Not quite on par with season 1 YET, but they're bringing it back. They slowed everything right down, no cheesy scenes. Some odd choices yes, but on the whole, stunning character-based performances all-round.
Â 
I really want to know what the 'beatles' conversation meant! Really cryptic.
1610	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-06-03	I would've given the episode an 8.5, but I was generous and rounded up.
Â 
It was good television. All of it.

1611	Devlonir	2014-06-03	9/10
Â 
I liked the opening scenes at Moletown as a good setup for the next episode. Also gave Ygritte a moment to come back to the memory of the Unsullied as a girl with her heart in the right place.
Â 
The scenes with Ramsay and Theon were good, but the story behind it not explained well enough. Unsullied have no idea why this was an important location to take. Also the fact that it was not Roose but only a King who has the power to legitimize him was not presented well. Many Unsullied think it was Roose who did it. This will confuse people later on.
Â 
Grey Worm and Missandrei was a nice added bit to the story. As it also shows how he is evolving from being emotionless by training to becoming more human. I'd say it does it better than the book.
Â 
The change around of the Jorah story worked pretty okay too. If they did it in book timing he would've been off screen for many episodes. Now he can pick up again almost immediately start of Season 5. Also, I loved Danny's acting in that scene.. the fact she did not look at him at all, even when he stood up it was clear she was looking through him. 10/10 that scene.
Hound & Arya is the coolest addition to this entire season in all episodes. The two just work so great together on screen. Though it feels forced for them to go where the rest of the story will take them now, that is a minor point. The ending of that scene with Arya's laughter worked really well and looking at the end of the episode where Tyrion did not do it, it was a great homage to the Tyrion book reaction.
Sansa scene was also a nice change. Makes one wonder where she goes next season. She was put forward as a capable manipulator in that one scene, and the visual of her growing up in the more lady-like (instead of girly) dress at the end gave that a strong visual cue as well. I still feel it is a shame they rush that entire plot though..Â Also.. the little hint when LF talked about 'many ways to die' was awesome.
Â 
Beetle scene was a bit odd and felt out of place.. but I loved the little 'bro moments' the two brothers had. The beetle story and the fact he cannot explain why they die is a strong description of life in Westeros in general.. people don't die for important reasons, just because someone above them feels like it.
Â 
And finally.. the duel.. 10/10 in my books. A few tweaks, but it was so well presented in general. I was surprised they did not make it very clear what is most special about Oberyn's fighting, just little hints. I'm sure it will be explained next episodes. In the current situation.. We are still unsure if the Mountain dies or is just crippled or heavily injured. I like that as it strengthens the cliffhanger.
All things considered, everything they did add and did not add was well thought out.. and the scene shocked even book readers.. what more do you want really?

So yeah.. 9/10.. not perfect, a few nitpicks.. but in general a great episode with a lot of conclusions and future set ups.Â

1612	Holymoly	2014-06-03	8 from me.
Â 
-1 for the whole Grey Worm / Missandei protracted nonsense
Â 
+1 for the bewbs however
Â 
A bit odd that Arya reached the Vale. In the book I seem to remember after she left Sandor to die she drifted around a bit until she caught a boat to Braavos? Surely they can't have her meeting up with her sister? Equally the guard on the Bloody Gate must at least mention that he had seen Arya Stark unless Littlefinger sees that the information goes no further. Some significant departures from the books in this series. Maybe it's the scriptwriters preparing for taking over the narrative when GRRM gives up. I can quite see him turning his attention to writing for the TV rather than the books now to finishe the story.
1613	Ravi Seaworth	2014-06-03	Unlike many of you, I liked the first half of the episode, as usual set up. Simply, I think the acting was good, especially in the Eyrie and with the Boltons. The scene with Missandei was normal, but the interaction between Danny and Jorah was good, different from everything we have seen from Daenerys. Mole's town was indeed a little more of Â redundant violence, given what we saw in previous episodes. Arya's seemed ridiculous at first, but to the unsullied viewer it is actually an appropriate reaction. Nothing ever goes as planned; it's so ridiculous that you can only laugh. Jaime and Tyrion was somewhat boring, but their conversation was a lyric introduction to the fight. Compared to the trial, this clearly lacked a greater emphasis, but I prefer rushed to dragged out. I guess they really tried a different approach that didn't work with many people. To me, it was fine. Not perfect, I agree, since I was not totally impressed. But not knowing what was coming would have helped to increase the shocking effect. Overall, a solid 8. Worthy of being amongst the second best episodes, but not there along with the typical WOW episodes, as episode 9 should be.
1614	Ladywhiskers	2014-06-03	10/10 for the duel. Very faithful to the book. Oberyn studied poison in college and is known as the Red Viper, so I'm sure the poison is staying, just didn't belong in this episode.
Â 
Brilliant: Sansa's scene, pretty much every minute of the duel, especially Jaime's reactions, Tyrion's monologue summarizing the human condition and foreshadowing the crushing of Oberyn's skull, and descriptive of Tywin, The Hound, and the awful Gods of this universe. Arya's laugh, so funny and so sad at the same time. None of Arya's relatives seem able to stay alive long enough for the Hound to get paid.
Â 
Nice: Ygritte's moment of saving Gilly. Gilly's fight with the skinny ho, the Boltons, Theon's tragically good performance as himself, persuading the Ironborn to surrender only to see them flayed later.
Â 
Missandei and Greyworm look too much alike, and I worry that they are brother and sister. They are adorable, but the timing was bad on this. Should have happened sooner--with Oberyn and Tyrion on the table I don't really care about them, or Theon.
Â 
Danaerys seemed absolutely insane, when she banished Jorah. Completely nutters. It was similar to the look she had on her face right after Viserys died, and her voice was strangely hollow. I get the distinct impression that she snapped. Sending Jorah away was a huge mistake, and had she thought about it awhile before making a snap decision, she might not have done it. After all, he did keep her from drinking the wine, and he did stay with her after that, completely loyal.
Â 
I disliked feeling sympathy for Ramsey, when he was told he's now a Bolton, not a Snow. Fortunately the vulnerable look left his face fairly quickly and was replaced by one even crazier than Danaerys', a somewhat chillingly fanatical expression.
Â 
Also the fact that it was not Roose but only a King who has the power to legitimize him was not presented well. Many Unsullied think it was Roose who did it. This will confuse people when Jon gets offered it by a king.
Â 
That's not quite true. Any father can legitimize his own bastards. Roose could have done it at any time. He just didn't really want to. He didn't trust Ramsey. Eddard Stark could have legitimized Jon Snow, but he didn't, because Catelyn would have been livid. Anyone can claim and legitimize his own bastards, but it's rarely done because this often puts the bastard in line ahead of legitimate children.
Â 
It takes a king to legitimize someone else's bastards, though. Robb could legitimize Jon Snow and name him his heir, because Robb was King. Same with Stannis.
1615	Frey Pies	2014-06-03	I'm actually really curious about what problem do people have with Missandei and Grey Worm's scenes- is it that they feel that Grey Worm cannot have affection without lust? Surely, it can't be about it being filler, since we don't even know where this is going. I thought it was a wonderful and quiet moment, something the show does very rarely.Â
1616	Skythe1	2014-06-03	Anybody else think that the eye gouging and head popping looked pretty fake? Emilia Clarke's acting was a bit wooden too... Good job Iain Glen saved the scene.
Â 
Apart from that I thought it was a good episode, bit of an anti-climax with the fight though, I thought it would get more screen time.
1617	Hodor knows	2014-06-03	Â 
I really want to know what the 'beatles' conversation meant! Really cryptic.


Â It was an analogy to point out just how lucky Ringo really was.
1618	AmyLoveAryaSansa	2014-06-03	for all the episodes until this one, I never consider GoT too bloody to watch. I mean, I'm not a fan of killing scenes, but I think I can go with them. But for how the Mount kills the Viper, OMG, I didn't even want to recall it now. It's really too bloody that I think I might have nightmare.Â
1619	IlAovatar	2014-06-03	I'm actually really curious about what problem do people have with Missandei and Grey Worm's scenes- is it that they feel that Grey Worm cannot have affection without lust? Surely, it can't be about it being filler, since we don't even know where this is going. I thought it was a wonderful and quiet moment, something the show does very rarely.Â 


The difference between affection for say, a cute little puppy, and affection between a man and a woman is sexual desire. Without some kind of hormone replacement therapy, a man who has been castrated isn't going to experience such desire... and certainly not to the extent implied in the show when Grey Worm was watching Missandei in the river.
Â 
It just seems like the show producers can't bear the thought having two good looking actors on screen without some kind of sexual encounter happening. The fact that Unsullied are fully castrated in the books - i.e. the pillar and the stones are completely removed - probably won't even stop them from showing what they want to show.
Â 
And beyond being a butchery of everything we know of the Unsullied from the books, I just don't find the relationship entertaining in any way. Friendship between the two characters would be fine as long as it doesn't make up too much filler content, but what they're showing is the kind of cringeworthy tripe i'd expect to see in a bad romance drama or some awful fanfiction story. It's bad enough that I have to tolerate the cheese fest that is show-Daario, D&D's Daenerys worship, and Emilia's bad acting.
1620	Rysler	2014-06-03	It's a 7, when trying very hard not to compare it with the books.Â 
Â 
Starting with the Wall and Beetles, that was just nonsense. Missadei/Grey Worm was rather more interesting, but given way too much focus. I don't appreciate Sansa's transformation or his relationship with Baelish. I don't understand what Sandor and Arya are doing in the episode. Along with so much nonsense and inconsistency.Â 
Â 
Then the important scenes. The Northern part with Theon and the Boltons was actually pretty solid. No complaints there. Jorah's banishment, in my opinion, was handled reeeeally badly. Dany had next to no emotions about it and it just came out of nowhere. And the duel. It was flashy and cool, I give you that, but it deserved much, much more focus, screen time and build-up.Â 
Â 
All in all, I feel really underwhelmed. Obviously the show holds little shock value to me, but I don't feel like they handled this one properly.
1621	Daenor	2014-06-03	8/10 for me.The duel was great as expected.I don't get itÂ  why they keep this stupid Missandei- Grey Worm thing.They may be both adorable characters for me but i'm not interested in watching a pointless romance between them.
And i definitely don't like some of the changes made in the Stark kids story.There were supposed to be all dead but for Sansa .But every now and than they'll appear and reveal their identity to as many people as possible.I don't see any point in this and how it makes a better plot or why it was necessary for a TV adaptation.
edit:Theon's scene was good too.Alfie has been performance is brilliant and it shows us every time how much broken Theon is.As for the complaints concerning E.Clarke i don't think she's the one to blame.She's a professional actor and adding emotion to a scene is not a big deal.So i guess it's the directors or the writers who demand this kind of play on her behalf.

Â 
There are 10 Daenerys chapters in ADwD. Quentyn has 2 prior to meeting Daenerys, and 2 after she leaves the city. Barristan has 4 after she leaves the city.
Â 
And please, aging Missandei up was not "forced by law", nor does it mean she should be sexualised or forced into a romance subplot. Why couldn't the showrunners age her up and make her more active in Dany's councils? In the books she actually advises Dany; in the show, despite being significantly older, she is little more than a handmaid and a herald.
Â 
I am familiar with the story of Abelard and Heloise. Apart from the obvious (his castration), I fail to see any similarities whatsoever... particularly as his castration takes place after their relationship, not before.
Â

Â 
Bad writing, poor characterisation (of Missandei), and ultimately it's just boring filler that can never advance the plot.
Â 
If I wanted to see what a relationship between Missandei and Grey Worm could potentially be like, I have no doubt that I could go and find some far better fanfiction.Â 
Â 
I found the way they handled Rakharo and Irri to be more interesting, and that wasn't in the books either so let's not try and pretend that this is about book purism.

1631	JagLover	2014-06-03	I gave my first 10 of the season.

Yes some of the scenes weren't perfect. But the episode would have been a great one even without the fight at the end-a fight which was awesome!

Sansa, Theon, Tyrion all great scenes and even Mereen was interesting this week!

It's bad enough that I have to tolerate the cheese fest that is show-Daario, D&D's Daenerys worship, and Emilia's bad acting.


Â 
Isn't there a part in the books where someone is talking to Dany about some Unsullied going to brothels to feel a woman's soft touch? I'm pretty sure there is- this is just a sub-plot that's been influenced by that. There's no butcheryÂ as you stated. By the way, D&D's Daenerys worship is a false belief- they have clearly shown her as being capable of making rash and questionable decisions. Have you not watched any episode after Breaker of Chains? Because, so far, we've had:
Â 
Oathkeeper: Dany chaining up the masters, against Barristan's advice. Nazi-Targ banner ominously sprawling over Meereen.
The Laws of Gods and Men: Her decisions being questioned even further, with her morality being questioned by the Joel Fry's awesome Hizdahr.
Mockingbird: Jorah questioning Dany's decision-making, and Dany even conceding that she was wrong.
The Mountain and the Viper itself: Â Daenerys rashly banishing Jorah.
Â 
^Seriously, I don't know how anyone could say that Dany is being depicted as a hero or whatever after all that has transpired up until now this season.
Â 
One last, minor point- show Daario is not the greatest of characters, but no one, NO ONE (except Darkstar of the night) can be worse than the blue, shallow book Daario.

They absolutely had to do it for Dany's story or everybody on the production would have been arrested on the spot!
Since they did away with Dany's Dothraki handmaidens, it was a dead cinch Missandei would become that. (I am still mad they don't still have Dany's Dothraki ladies!) but they did keep Missandei.
So how you adapt those Dany chapters from Dance?
You have read the Abelard and Heloise letters?, well the ones loaded with passion, that was after the castration event.
You have a different take?


Â 
I'm really tired of arguing about whether they had to make Missandei older. Yes, there's no way they could let a 10 year old play her, but that didn't mean she had to be an adult. But most importantly, if they had to make her an adult, why not actually make her a vital part of "team Daenerys"? In the books she was vital to Dany's understanding of Slaver's Bay; in the show, she doesn't even know the extent of the Unsullied's castration.
Â 
You adapt those Dany chapters from Dance by, I don't know... adapting those chapters? Seriously, just go and read them. They're FULL of material to use. Dany's narrative in ADwD is about being trapped in Meereen, with enemies approaching her from all sides, and deciding to submit to them in an attempt to survive. But then she throws away her "floppy ears" in defiance, flies away on Drogon, and comes to the realisation that she needs to abandon Meereen.Â 
Â 
And yes, I have a very different take on those letters. You say they are "loaded with passion" and I won't disagree, but it's important that it happens AFTER he's already sexually developed and AFTER they have engaged in a sexual relationship. Grey Worm, on the other hand, can't even remember his life before he was cut.
Â 
And seriously, the whole point of the Unsullied is that they don't have sexual desire... but Grey Worm still stares at Missandei? It's terrible writing and it's a pretty dumb plot hole.
1636	XTwipz	2014-06-03	Still can't face at the outcome of the duel... Oh god... I expected something hard but .. this ? This is true, when you love a character, he's going to die a few episodes after... Anyway it was a great one ! And I'm afraid of the 9. They're always horrible and awful !
1637	Pure Guava	2014-06-03	Writers are not credited per-scene, that's what I said, and that's what I meant.


Â 
I'd imagine that the writers are responsible for the scenes in the episode they're credited with penning, minus the random scene being moved around. But seeing as the only writers this season aside from GRRM himself and Bryan Cogman are David and Dan...it's likely to assume they wrote what you're seeing.
Â 
Â 


Did you guys actually like how Gregor practically squished oberyns head like a watermelon?
Â 
It felt extremely unrealistic. I mean, I can understand someone getting their face smashed in by a gauntlet, but squishing someones head to watermelon? come on... really?

Â 
People and feelings and love are far too complicated for this to be dismissed as a dumb plot hole. It's clearly not just the physical aspect that is at play.Â They have become close emotionally - that's been shown from both sides. HeÂ is falling in love with her regardless of his ability to feel 'normal' sexual desire. Is that really impossible? Who's to say he can't help staring at the beautiful woman he has a connection with without getting a rush of blood to his groin - can't he appreciate beauty? He can obviously see the inner beauty without balls, whyÂ not the outer?
Â 
Pretty sure love is more than just hormones or the ability to have sex. Now granted they usually play a part - which does make this an interesting relationship. But to dismiss as impossible is to ignore the wide variety of human nature. Maybe think of them as soulmates rather than fuck buddies if that helps.
1639	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-03	8/10
2 points for each of Oberyns eyes
6 points for his crushed skull

That would make 10...
1640	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-03	Would've been a 9 for me, but I bumped it to 10 to compensate for the people who voted 1 or 2 because GRRM never wrote about beetles.
1641	sj4iy	2014-06-03	Would've been a 9 for me, but I bumped it to 10 to compensate for the people who voted 1 or 2 because GRRM never wrote about beetles.There were a few things I didn't like about this episode, but the beetles' story was good.
1642	Frey Pies	2014-06-03	There were a few things I didn't like about this episode, but the beetles' story was good.


Â 
Yeah, the beetles' story was amazing! I don't know why everyone is hating on it.Â
1643	~No One~	2014-06-03	Ok, first time voting! I went with 9/10. 
Basically, it took me until now to decide how much I liked the episode, and I think that this is why, if for no other reason, the episode (and whole show) are so good. Art is supposed to be controversial, it is supposed to evoke emotions, debate, etc., no? 
I give a full 8 of those points for the execution (heh) of the duel. I had faith it would be done A  la book canon, and I was satisfied. The other point comes from throwing a curveball to us book walkers. 
There has been complaining about some (non-book) scenes, but don't we as readers feel like we "know the material better" because characters are fleshed out, there is backstory, etc.? Well, the show is doing that, now. Differently. But that is exciting, too, I think. 
I do not apply any of the changes as made on the show to what GRRM is writing, because I believe that all doubt as to whether these are two separate stories has now been removed. Both are vectors for the same overall story, but the 'how' will be different, I believe. The end game for each (major) character might not be different, but that is only a small part of a 70-hour story.
So, for all the (non-rape-related) debate this episode has stirred up, 9 points!
ETA: loss of one point for no Tyrion vomit. Woulda been too funny to have that in :/

lol
1646	boojam	2014-06-03	I'm really tired of arguing about whether they had to make Missandei older. Yes, there's no way they could let a 10 year old play her, but that didn't mean she had to be an adult. But most importantly, if they had to make her an adult, why not actually make her a vital part of "team Daenerys"? In the books she was vital to Dany's understanding of Slaver's Bay; in the show, she doesn't even know the extent of the Unsullied's castration.Â You adapt those Dany chapters from Dance by, I don't know... adapting those chapters? Seriously, just go and read them. They're FULL of material to use. Dany's narrative in ADwD is about being trapped in Meereen, with enemies approaching her from all sides, and deciding to submit to them in an attempt to survive. But then she throws away her "floppy ears" in defiance, flies away on Drogon, and comes to the realisation that she needs to abandon Meereen.Â Â And yes, I have a very different take on those letters. You say they are "loaded with passion" and I won't disagree, but it's important that it happens AFTER he's already sexually developed and AFTER they have engaged in a sexual relationship. Grey Worm, on the other hand, can't even remember his life before he was cut.Â And seriously, the whole point of the Unsullied is that they don't have sexual desire... but Grey Worm still stares at Missandei? It's terrible writing and it's a pretty dumb plot hole.You know how to adapt Dany's chapter's in Dance? I have read them,... as visual drama, I don't know how to do that in 10 one hour episodes.I leave that up to the show runners, we shall just have to see.It's odd that GRRM has a whole army of emasculated men... low or no levels of testosterone lessons aggression not exactly something one wants in a soldier.But castration or total emasculation can be imperfect leaving even the possibility of minimal generation of testosterone.But hey this is an alternate universe 'Earth'!We already have George appealing to Valyrian homozygosity as producing extreme psychological disorder , which in this world rarely leads to mental illness, but is most likely to produces physical defects. Not on Planetos.We know that sexual attraction or just erotic attraction can originate in brain function apart from testosterone level , that's true both in this universe and possibly GRRM's universe.I don't remember reading in ASoIaF that the Unsullied absolutely had no desires of any kind.

1647	Pure Guava	2014-06-03	Â 
Yeah, the beetles' story was amazing! I don't know why everyone is hating on it.Â 


Â 
Glad to see the beetle tide changing.
1648	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-03	I gave it a 9/10
Â 
I thought the Beetle speech was clever and sets the tone of the world they live in. People are being needlessly crushed all the time andÂ the person who crushes them thinks little of it. ItÂ  reminds me of Tywin- he crushed allot of people but in the end he will be kicked by the mule (rather unflattering death for someone demonstrating such power). However, I would've rather seen more of a pre-duel build up with Oberyn (character we are losing), not just Tyrion.
Â 
The Duel-Â  The acting was perfect! Â I got goose bumps when the volume in his accusation rose with "YOU KILLED HER CHILDREN!" and pointing at Tywin "who gave you the order?" (bringing him down too). The death scene was brutal and left me haunted, exactly as it should do.
Â 
Sansa- I like seeing manipulative Sansa but I didn't like Littlefinger being completely at her mercy. I can get on board with Sansa learning faster though.
Â 
Arya Laughing- One of the funniest scenes on the show. I loved this!
Â 
Jon and Gang- I like seeing scenes with the NW boys so it was nice seeing them all dwell over their approaching doom and comforting Sam. So far most of the NW scenes have been forgettable (except the Crasters keep fight).
Â 
I also think the Boltons are being set up nicely as the 'tyrants' of the North. The scene with them marching toward Winterfell peeved me off. Hate those guys!
Â 
I have no problem with Grey Worm/ Missandei especially because all ofÂ the other romances have gone down the drain. However, I feel as if this is the Essos version of Sam/Gilly which is the only other romance we haveÂ left. Â 
Â 
WhyÂ was the Camera up Dany's nose during the banishing Jorah scene? I felt uncomfortable.
Â 
Overall, great episode!

1650	GeorgeIAF	2014-06-03	Gave it a 9/10 , i expected the duel to be even more emotional than it was.
1651	King of the Road	2014-06-03	Who honestly gave this a 1 or a 2? Come on.
1652	ground_control	2014-06-03	Who honestly gave this a 1 or a 2? Come on.


Read the thread yourself -- several of us who gave those scores already said we did, and why.
1653	paulusar	2014-06-03	Any episode showing Missandei naked has to be a 10.
1654	Dragon Queen	2014-06-03	I voted 7. Previous ratings 9, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 8, 7. 
I miss the snarkiness and witty lines in the beginning of the season. 
+ Sansa was the highlight of the episode for me. Loved the hair color and her story full of lies, half truths, and truths. She's come a long way. Husband said, "Damn!" when he saw her new hair and outfit. Absolutely loved everything in the Eyrie scene. 
+ Fight scene. I'm sure a lot of effort went into training Oberyn. 
+ You're going to fight that? I'm going to kill that. 
- Theon and Ramsay. I hate everything about Roose and Ramsay. I wish the Others would spontaneously teleport to Moat Cailin, kill everyone associated with Roose/Ramsay, then teleport back to their plot line. I am sick to death of Ramsay's torture porn and sicko violence. 
- Jorah scene. Minus points for him coming off well and Dany coming off worse. 
I was actually hoping they would change the plot line so that she never exiles him. He gives her some of the best advice she's ever gotten from anyone. 
- Beetle scene. It was long and not that funny.
1655	RadoLukacs	2014-06-03	10/10.
Â 
This episode was mind-blowing, when it ended I watched the credits in utter shock. Very good. Pedro Pascal was unbelievable and the whole duel scene definitely fulfilled my expectations. As for other scenes, Jorah's banishment was done nicely, I liked Emilia's acting and of course Iain Glen was incredible (as always); Moat Cailin was pretty good, I especially liked the shot of Bolton company arriving at Winterfell after that; I did not mind the Grey Worm and Missandei romance and I found it quite entertaining (more than the invented material around the Craster's Keep); I was just a little bit confused about Littlefinger being completely at the mercy of Sansa, but it wasn't a big issue and I was very happy to see Sansa's new look; I am not extremely enjoying Arya and Hound scenes, mainly because they are really trying to put a little bit of comedy into the show and it doesn't always work for me (the laughter and the jokes); but with this episode, they definitely delivered.
Â 
A very well-done episode, with the duel scene and all the actors' performances in it being the ultimate highlight.
Â 
Â 
Episodes 1-8:Â Â  7;10;8;9;10;8;9;10/10.
1656	IlAovatar	2014-06-03	I'd like you to clarify the bolded part of your post for me, please. Are you actually saying that there can't be affection between a man and a woman without sexual desire?


As I said, you can feel a sense of affection for a cute little puppy without there being any sexual desire there. Friends and relatives can also love and care about each other greatly and feel a great amount of affinity and attachment... but an actual relationship between a hetrosexual or homosexual couple absolutely requires an element of sexual desire. That's not necessarily limited to physical lust however. Someone can seem like a desirable mating partner because of their outgoing and confident personality or their social standing, even if they're not immediately desirable at a glance.
1657	Rashtibram	2014-06-03	- Beetle scene. It was long and not that funny.


Who said it was supposed to be funny?
1658	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-03	That's okay. I've dropped mine to a 5 just to balance things out. 


Â 
Â 
Well I just changed my 9 to a 10 because I loved the beetles!Â
1659	JagLover	2014-06-03	Would've been a 9 for me, but I bumped it to 10 to compensate for the people who voted 1 or 2 because GRRM never wrote about beetles.


Book purists are being a bit ridiculous when rating this episode. Â 
Â 
From start to finish this episode was gold. If I have one criticism it is that I found Emilia a little wooden, other than that it was one great scene after another.
Â 
Yes LF was at Sansa's mercy, unlike in the books, but LF of the show isn't anywhere near as intelligent or subtle than book LF so it is somewhat in character. Yes Sansa surprised us all, but I bet we are seeing WOW Sansa rather than some dreadful character destruction.
Â 
Turning to the beetles story, it wasn't in the book, but it could have been as the message fits both show and book.
1660	Citadel_acolyte	2014-06-03	I gave the episode a 6, but in retrospect it should have been higher.
Â 
I LOVE LOVE LOVE every moment of the scenes with Arya and the Hound.Â  It's tough knowing that they are goingÂ to come to an end, although I do want more Bravos.
Â 
I really liked the scenes in the North, particularly the Bolton father-son moment. Also like the Reek-Ramsay bits.
Â 
I highly approved of all the scenes in the Eyrie, and I aprove of Sansa coming clean about her identity, although I am interested to see where that is going. I found the final scene between Sansa and Littlefinger a little creepyÂ butÂ possibly in a good way.Â 
Â 
I liked the duel although I confess to covering my face during the head explosion.
Â 
Somewhat puzzled by the beetles, but the dynamic beween Jaime and Tyrion is great.Â  I'll take as much as I can get.
Â 
The only thing I really didn't like was the Missandi-Grey worm bit mostly because, as others have mentioned, there is so much other great material to cover and it just seemed like it was written in for theÂ gratuitous nudity.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â
1661	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-03	I voted 8 because I think they could have (And have before) done better with Tyrion's and Arya's scenes. I didn't really like the laugh reaction, or at least how it played out, and logically it didn't make sense that they wouldn't tell Littlefinger hey Arya Stark is out here with the Hound. I suppose they could do that next week but the two of them escape somehow...Still seems kind of weird.
Â 
Tyrion's scene had a message that could've been conveyed a bit better and more succinctly.Â 
Â 
The rest was great. Pascal was awesome, and as someone who doesn't care at all for Sansa in the books I find her story much more interesting on the show, as in I can actually tolerate it. Was pumped to see Dolorous Edd and Pyp get some lines, and Iain Glenn did a pretty great job in that scene as well.Â
1662	Ran	2014-06-03	656 votes, 8.14 average, 9 median, 8.37 normalized average.An overview of the forum's voting for this season:Episode 1: 8.18Episode 2: 8.41Episode 3: 6.98Episode 4: 7.78Episode 5: 7.40Episode 6: 8.76Episode 7: 8.28Episode 8: 8.14Average to date: 7.99, which if it maintains (I suspect and hope it will improve on it) will make it the third highest rated season of the show according to the forum.
1663	rmholt	2014-06-03	8. The beetles. The Jorah denouement. The duel. Not up to par.
1664	LilJonUmber	2014-06-03	I gave *this episode* a '1', not the season, and not the series as a whole. Â I didn't "officially" rank seasons 1-3, but I'd say my "average" impression of GOT is in the 7-10 range.
Â 
I'm not a professional reviewer, so I only watch programs I like, and I watch very little tv (<5 hrs week), and this is the only show I like enough to go to a web forum and discuss/rate. Â So, basically, any rating I give an episode is relative to previous GOT episodes and the few other shows I've watched in the last few years.
Â 
And as to D&D shitting on somebody's floor -- I don't disapprove of changes being made, and I have liked some of their changes, and other I haven't liked but understood why they had to be made, but overall, I find that the weakest scenes are ones that are solely the show's invention -- not because they are changes, but because GRRM is a better writer than the rest. Â D&D contracted for an adaptation, not general permission to write their own fanfic in GRRM's world, so I'm not interested in their "legacy" of stories they'd like to tell in his world, but in how well they *show* me the story I've already *read*.


Â 
Fair enough, and I appreciate the fleshed out response.Â 
Â 
But my point is, D&D aren't doing a verbatim adaptation, so you may as well get over that--for the sake of your own viewing pleasure; not as me, some stranger, telling you what to do.Â 
Â 
What's more, while you may not like every change they've made -- nor have I -- I think it's unfair to say that EVERY one has been a poor decision, simply by default. IMO, D&D have had far more wins than losses when they've added scenes or storylines that were not in the book. Making Bronn a more prominent character...having Jaime show up earlier, so there's more interaction with Tyrion...Shae's actual love for Tyrion -- and vice versa -- blowing up in their faces, as he's trying to protect her...Stannis' trip to Braavos...tying up loose ends with the mutineers, et al.Â 
Â 
It's unfair to bemoan the changes you dislike, without factoring in the ones that were clearly entertaining and/or integral.Â 
Â 
At any rate, a "1" just seems absurd.Â 
Â 
Such a low score means that you literally sat there falling asleep, or wanting to claw your eyes out and stab your eardrums, and wanted 53 minutes of your life back upon its conclusion.Â 
Â 
If you came away with that feeling after 4 x 08, then I feel bad that you're not enjoying what 90% of us on here are...Â

I know it's not a verbatim adaptation -- I've said in several posts that I don't want a video version of an audiobook. Â But I'd like it to be the same story. Â You were the one who suggested D&D wanted to tell their own story, and that's what I don't want. Â I want them to tell George's story on television. Â That means I don't want them changing fundamental things (like switching Robb & Jeyne with Robb and Talisa), but that I wholly approve of adding the Ramsay & Theon scenes into Season 3.
Â 
And yes, what you described is essentially how I felt about the episode. Â We had a two week wait, the show named the episode after the participants in one of the most awesome scenes from the books, and which the show has done an excellent job building up to over the past seven episodes. Â So, yes, I had high expectations and hopes. Â What I got was 30 or minutes of low-grade filler mixed with 10 minutes of good-great scenes (Moat Cailin and the Eyrie) and then when the show *finally* makes it to King's Landing we get 5 minutes of Tyrion and Jaime babbling, and then finally the combat, which was completely unsatisfying to me -- it felt cheap and rushed, it did NOT feel epic, and I wanted epic.
Â 
When I rewatched the show (I always watch twice before voting), I actually skipped 75% of the show because it wasn't worth the time to watch, something I haven't done since season 2.
1669	Fat Mac	2014-06-03	That would make 10...

Whoops! Didn't realize I put 2 for each eye. 
So a -2 for Grey Worms missing stones then.
1670	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-03	I didn't really enjoy this episode overall as much as others this season. 
I am not feeling the Wildlings at all and I must admit the Wall is boring this season considering it's going to be all episode 9 contains. 
Missendei and Grey Worm... Erm... I'm not sure about that. I'm not bothered so much as I don't really care about either character overly much. Good be entertaining in the future I guess. The time could have spent better else where. 
Moat Calin was good. Roose was also good as always. I look forward to Rooses bigger part next season onwards. 
I thought they were gonna say don't make me rue the day... When Ramsey was all "I won't let you down dad" lol. 
Beetles was... Wierd. I didn't really like it. Not because it wasn't in the books, it was just boring. "What does it all mean?" 
The duel was awesome I thought. Great fight. 
Jorah get permanently FriendZoned was good. Although I thought it was a poor change to make him beg for forgiveness when erm... I thought the whole point of that scene was that he didn't repent?
I can't remember any other scenes.
1671	I'll pay the iron price	2014-06-03	I gave it a 9

1672	I'll pay the iron price	2014-06-03	Re - the beetle scene
Â 
I may be in the minority but I liked it.
Not because they talked about beetles but rather the 2 brothers interacting with each other so well.
They could have talked about the price of wine or about peeing off Casterley Rock when they were kids - it wouldnt matter.
The scene was about 2 brothers from a troubled family having a heart to heart chat

The rest was great. Pascal was awesome, and as someone who doesn't care at all for Sansa in the books I find her story much more interesting on the show, as in I can actually tolerate it. Was pumped to see Dolorous Edd and Pyp get some lines, and Iain Glenn did a pretty great job in that scene as well.Â 


Â 
I loved Arya's reaction. She isn't just laughing at death. She is also laughing at the Hound not getting his cash. Also, with Littlefinger on "trial", I don't know if they would concede that Littlefinger is in control. Also, the minute the Hound hears the name Baelish, the Hound is out of there. As far as he knows, Baelish is a Lannister man.Â
1677	Mesmeric	2014-06-03	I was thinking of giving 7 at first, but the duel left me breathles and made me to revalue to 8. Still cannot get Oberyn Â´s smashed head out of mine, though.

Â 
I get the reaction I just thought it was kind of odd, especially to end that part of the story like that. Even if LF isn't in control they still should probably inform someone Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane are standing outside their gates. They're surrounded by bowmen and guards, not easy to just walk away.Â
1679	boojam	2014-06-03	You apologized to a film maker and two people whose names I don't recognize, and (as far as I know) have anything to do with the show. Â Putting something in a spoiler tag doesn't give it meaning; in fact, if you take the time to put something in a spoiler tag, you should try to make sure that it explains what you mean.

O yea of little cinema history.
1680	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-03	Wow, such a lot of vitriol earlier in this thread. I'm staying out of it, lads and lasses. Â A plague on all your Houses. Â Â The 'book purists' must be allowed their opinions; the 'show apologists' should be given equal latitude. Â We're never going to agree on everything, and we can have sensible, productive debate (which we do for the most part - it has to be said), or we can tear each other to pieces (which upsets this old gal.) Â I love both books and show, but see them as totally separate animals. Â Both have huge flaws; both have great swathes of excellence.
Â 
My own votes only ever reflect how much I was entertained. Â I gave 10 to this, because I WAS entertained from start to finish. Â I enjoyed the intensity in all the scenes and came away satisfied. Â I no longer think of the books when I watch the show. Â And if I've watched 50+ minutes of telly without hating Aidan Gillen for the first time ever in the show, I consider myself blessed
1681	ground_control	2014-06-03	O yea of little cinema history.


And when did I ever claim to be a Cinema Historian? Â All I did was call you out for making shit up badly.

1682	Zed.	2014-06-03	Hmm...I think a 9/10 is quite fair.Â 
Â 
I actually quite enjoyed most of the scenes before the duel at the end. Sansa's transformation in this episode was quite fascinating; her character is really maturing -- which I have no doubt is exactly what Littlefinger was trying to achieve.Â 
Â 
The scenes with Arya and the Hound were pretty great, also. I'm not sure what will happen next, but I reckon that the wound that the Hound suffered in the previous episode will be addressed again in the final 2 episodes.Â 
Â 
What I didn't quite enjoy in the episodes was everything that was going on in Meereen. The scenes with Grey Worm didn't really stick with me, and Jorah leaving Daenerys just felt a little rushed, imo.Â 
Â 
The duel was easily the stand-out part of the episode for me. I already had the outcome of the battle spoiled for me, but the final scene was still pretty hard to watch, never-the-less. Plus, the choreography for the fight scene was fantastic -- I just wished the fight was a little longer.Â 
Â 
Who else thinks that Oberyn has the best fighting-style so far in the show?

					
					
							Edited by Zed., 03 June 2014 - 04:49 PM.
1683	7th-key	2014-06-03	I quite disliked it. It seems now they are doing everything for shock. Holding build ups back, so they can hit the audience with a revelation. Instead of a strong thought progression, you get rhetorical hints 
	Spoiler (e.g. Little finger's mention that you can die while on a chamber pot and Tyrion reciting all type of murders leaving the best for last.)
I also hate the pacing. It's not the first time that I bore through an episode and wonder when will the event in the title come up (ie quickly at the end of the ep).There's also strange directing (all Dany scenes) and editing.Â The show it's just not working. I'm off to the nitpicking thread...Â Vote: 4 maybe 5.

1684	mitch726	2014-06-03	I loved every part of the episode. The next 2 should be amazing. Episode 9 looks like its going to be a more focused/concerntrated episode like Blackwater in Season 2. Benioff and Weiss promise episode 10 will be the most epic episode yet so can't wait
1685	LilJonUmber	2014-06-03	I know it's not a verbatim adaptation -- I've said in several posts that I don't want a video version of an audiobook. Â But I'd like it to be the same story. Â You were the one who suggested D&D wanted to tell their own story, and that's what I don't want. Â I want them to tell George's story on television. Â That means I don't want them changing fundamental things (like switching Robb & Jeyne with Robb and Talisa), but that I wholly approve of adding the Ramsay & Theon scenes into Season 3.
Â 
And yes, what you described is essentially how I felt about the episode. Â We had a two week wait, the show named the episode after the participants in one of the most awesome scenes from the books, and which the show has done an excellent job building up to over the past seven episodes. Â So, yes, I had high expectations and hopes. Â What I got was 30 or minutes of low-grade filler mixed with 10 minutes of good-great scenes (Moat Cailin and the Eyrie) and then when the show *finally* makes it to King's Landing we get 5 minutes of Tyrion and Jaime babbling, and then finally the combat, which was completely unsatisfying to me -- it felt cheap and rushed, it did NOT feel epic, and I wanted epic.
Â 
When I rewatched the show (I always watch twice before voting), I actually skipped 75% of the show because it wasn't worth the time to watch, something I haven't done since season 2.


Â 
Just to clarify, I meant that D&D have wanted to put their own spin on the source material. I mean, haven't you ever read a book and thought in your headÂ I don't agree with that. I would've done it this way? And really, if we're being fair, that's all they've done thus far. Ball park estimate, I'd say 85-90% of GOT is in the books. That's a far cry from what many like to claim has been 38 episodes of complete fanfic.Â 
Â 
Â 
Anyway, to each their own. Some purists will give an episode a low rating, simply because ONE LINE they hoped would be in the scene was omitted. Clearly, you've got more reasoning behind your vote than those people.
Â 
Let's hope episode 9 is everything it's been hyped up to be. Â
1686	Patrick Targstark	2014-06-03	Even though we all knew it was coming I was still upset to see Oberyn go. Great job by Pedro Pascal throughout the season.
1687	Steelegrave	2014-06-03	Book purists are being a bit ridiculous when rating this episode. Â 
Â 
From start to finish this episode was gold. If I have one criticism it is that I found Emilia a little wooden, other than that it was one great scene after another.
Â 
Yes LF was at Sansa's mercy, unlike in the books, but LF of the show isn't anywhere near as intelligent or subtle than book LF so it is somewhat in character. Yes Sansa surprised us all, but I bet we are seeing WOW Sansa rather than some dreadful character destruction.
Â 
Turning to the beetles story, it wasn't in the book, but it could have been as the message fits both show and book.


Â 
How do you come to the conclusion that show LF isn't as intelligent as book LF? Â Nearly every machination from the books has played out in the show.
Â 
I gave this episode a 6. Â 6 only because the worst episode of GoT is better than any other TV. Â It is probably one of the most anticipated and poorly executed episodes of this season. Â Here's why:Â 
Â 
1) Â I love Sansa's quick progression but I cannot stand what they did with LF. Â The master manipulator, Machivelli's Prince, the man with the plan, comes to the Lords Declarant and his defense is basically, "yeah I got nothin". Â Littlefinger ALWAYS has a plan. Â Period. Â That was stupid writing. Â There is no Song of Ice and Fire without Littlefinger. Â If he doesn't convince Lyssa to kill John Arryn, Ned never goes to Kings Landing, Robert finds out about the true parentage of his children, Robert doesn't hesitate to have Dany assassinated etc etc etc. Â To sacrifice Littlefinger to make Sansa more interesting is blasphemous.
Â 
2) The dual I thought was well carried out but I realized I was watching it from the eyes of someone who has read the books multiple times. Â When I asked my fellow viewers who haven't read the books, every one of them thought that smashing Oberyn's skull was the Mountains last act before he dropped dead. Â The show makers didn't do their job and show that the Mountain was still alive. Â As such, those people were confused as to why Tywin declared the Mountain the winner. Â If they were both dead then it should go to first blood.Â 
Â 
3) Arya is so shell shocked from her life experience that she will never reveal who she is yet she walks into a valley of hired thugs and shouts her name. Â This is not a small thing. Â Her story progression is almost wholly about casting off Arya Stark. Â Every time she lies about who she is its a step in that progression. Â By this point in her arc she has completely given up Arya. Â If she walks away from her declaration here without any repercussions, it lessens her story.

Yup. And now I don't know how they get from "I am Arya Stark" to the lost blind girl in Bravoss.

Â 
That is an excellent interpretation of Arya from the books, its a shame you are not helping the show's writers adapt the books to screenplay, it seems they are oblivious to that side of her arc.
Â 
She literally lies so many times, assumes many identities that in a sense Arya Stark merely becomes another identity that she can assume or not at will, and eventually she goes on to train in forgetting who she is entirely so she can become anything and anyone.
Â 
The fact that so many people say 'Arya laughing was the cutest' tells you how badly they have fucked up her arc, she is arguably one of the darkest characters in the book.
Â 
It through her eyes we mostly get to witness the real effects of the Game of Thrones, the rapes, torture and pillaging that sweeps across the land while the noblemen and women plot and scheme like assholes safe in their cities and castles.
Â 
Arya and the Hound aren't a cute odd couple, they are much darker in the books and less buddy, buddy. Its just another example of messing things up.
Â 
The worst part is the unsullied non book readers have no clue things are meant to be very different for alot of their favourite characters.
Â 
Its the same with Tyrion, he is alot darker around the edges in the books and still a Lannister asshole, but god forbid Peter Dinklage be asked to add a bit of darkness to everyone's favourite character. The worst part is, I bet he could pull it off and still be everyone's favourite, but they won't even try.
Â 
Anyway, this episode is just a perfect example of how all the changes they are making are ruining the story/
Â 
Main storylines are treated as side shows and characters are being kept going longer or presented in to suit the supposed demands of the T.V audience and as a result they are getting really short changed from a story perspective.

Â 
Let's hope episode 9 is everything it's been hyped up to be. Â 


Yes, I have thought about how I would "improve" upon other people's works, and that includes both the GOT books and show. Â But I would never presume that other people should agree with my opinions just because the original author took my cash. Â And I'd realize that any time I made a change, that there would be some people who did not agree with it, so I'd be more careful than (imo) D&D have been.
Â 
Also, I'd consider the context in which somebody criticizes something. Â I hated the "Only Cat" change, and I think that making that change demonstrates a clear lack of subject matter knowledge by D&D, in addition to a lack of basic competence in adaptation (and screenwriting in general). Â Did it change my rating of the show? Â No -- I still gave it a '9'. Â But whereas I would automatically want to watch anything involving, say, Tom Stoppard, seeing D&D's name on a work will never make me lean towards giving it a look (and, in fact, would be more likely than not to lessen my inclination to view the work -- especially if it would require a financial in addition to temporal expenditure).
Â 
Also, many people (myself included) use the term "fanfic" to denote a low quality interpretation of another's work, as opposed to a high quality interpretation.
Â 
I know there are some "absolute book purists" out there, but (from what I've seen), a substantial amount of the hatred to show changes is because of their perceived low quality, not just their existence.
1691	yushkevitch	2014-06-03	Rating this episode aside for a moment, I'm curious how Unsullied viewers are going to feel about the show as this season wraps up. You all know of Pavlov's dog I'm assuming, well how can any viewer let themselves get attached to a character after we repeatedly see them die in shocking, brutal fashion? There's a line I think for most viewers and GRRM may be getting close to crossing it.
Â 

	Spoiler And of course I'm looking forward to a certain *possible* death to come that by this point the thrice-bitten-four-times-shy Unsullied may just assume is coming .. and either way, quit watching altogetherÂ

Thank you.
Â 
Arya is one of my favorite characters. Â Her story is so tragic yet she always has some hope.
Â 
I didn't think Arya's laugh was cute. Â I think Maisie did a bad job of making it maniacal. Â I interpreted it as a laugh of lost sanity that Maisie wasn't equipped to deliver. Â If that wasn't the writers' intention then that was a completely ridiculous scene. Â To interpret it as cute means they don't understand the story.
Â 
I'm not overly annoyed by the show's Arya/Hound dynamic. Â Contrary, I have actually enjoyed it for the most part. Â But it is going to take a major event to get Arya to the dark place of becoming a faceless man. Â GRRM made it easier on himself by making her whole story fairly dark.
Â 
I don't mind, at all, them making changes. Â I get 2 different stories with beloved characters. Â But when those changes are so nonsensical it comes off amateurish. Â These guys get so much praise and adoration and they are screwing up the simplest stuff.
Â 
Now don't get me wrong. Â I admire the hell out of them for having the sack to bring this story to TV. Â I love the show. Â I have convinced everyone I work with to watch it and they all love it. Â Just every little mistake they make derails a great story.

Â 
I think they may follow the book, but it makes the whole Arya/Hound arc seem like a jaunty walk in the woods. If the Hound drops (he was seen being bothered by his wound in this episode), Arya will simply leave him and then use the coin and "valar morghulis" to get aboard. But again it just seems like the adventure with the Hound was a total waste for her character and the fact that she gave her name---ACK
1695	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-03	Man I'm shocked by the 7.99 average rating for season 4. Well maybe not too shocked considering many on this forum. It's like George's books are the seven pointed star and the majority of people here are sparrows, devout to the bone. However, as a book reader, and someone whose favorite book of all time is a Storm of Swords I think season 4 (at least through episodes 1-8) has been the best season. I'm sure a lot of the unsullied would feel the same way. Maybe it's just me though.
1696	rmholt	2014-06-03	I didn't really enjoy this episode overall as much as others this season. 
I am not feeling the Wildlings at all and I must admit the Wall is boring this season considering it's going to be all episode 9 contains. 
Missendei and Grey Worm... Erm... I'm not sure about that. I'm not bothered so much as I don't really care about either character overly much. Good be entertaining in the future I guess. The time could have spent better else where. 
Moat Calin was good. Roose was also good as always. I look forward to Rooses bigger part next season onwards. 
I thought they were gonna say don't make me rue the day... When Ramsey was all "I won't let you down dad" lol. 
Beetles was... Wierd. I didn't really like it. Not because it wasn't in the books, it was just boring. "What does it all mean?" 
The duel was awesome I thought. Great fight. 
Jorah get permanently FriendZoned was good. Although I thought it was a poor change to make him beg for forgiveness when erm... I thought the whole point of that scene was that he didn't repent?
I can't remember any other scenes.

Would have been truer if they'd just had him say You have to forgive me. No reason not to. CUNGH.
1697	rmholt	2014-06-03	I forgive the beetle talk for it's meme - liciousness
1698	ground_control	2014-06-03	Re: Arry and the Hound
Â 
At first I thought it was just a bad maniacal laugh, but it may have been a [bad] attempt to discredit what Sandor said so that they can turn around and GTFO of there...of course, Sandor is wounded, so he'll be slower (assuming Arry doesn't just trip him, lol) and possibly get caught while Arry gets away, just in time to catch a ship to Braavos. Â Or maybe Sandor gets away with her, but slows down and asks Arry for Mercy (and the scene ends with it looking like she does it) and then she shows up at the Saltpans.
1699	rmholt	2014-06-03	Â 
Â 
I don't know either. Â They royally screwed that up.

The Hound is getting sick. She has the coin. She's near the East Coast just across from Braavos. Seems on track.
1700	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-03	I cannot overstate how well I think Oberyn's death was handled. Gut wrenchingly brutal in all respects. It really stole the show and I wasn't prepared for it to be so violent as it was in the books. At first, I doubted Pedro Pascal's ability to bring one of my favorite characters from ASoIaF to life but he blew all my expectations out of the water with that magnificent performance. Amazing actor. I hope this propels his career to new heights. The only problem I had with the duel itself was Gregor's armor. Of course I would have preferred the original Gregor (Conan Stevens) over this new guy, but that's not a legitimate complaint. He did a decent enough job. I just wish they would have kept the original suit of armor that Gregor wore in season one. He looked so much more fearsome at the tourney of the Hand. I noticed they took away some bits and pieces for the duel such as the gauntlets and the bucket helm. He could have looked a lot better than he did but that's not the actor's fault. The only thing I've seen people really complain about is the high number of cuts during the fight. I noticed that too myself but the thought left my mind in an instant, it was so unimportant to me. It didn't take away from the drama at all. And unlike other people, I could also buy Oberyn's head exploding from the pressure of Gregor's massive weight. Come on guys, have you ever seen it done before? How do you know it's not possible? Didn't look to far fetched to me. Pedro's screams made it real. That and the grisly special effects. Yeah, everyone saw the mess that was left after, but did you notice how fucked up his mouth looked after Gregor punched him in the face? Or how his nose and forehead swelled up just before the end? Gruesome...
Â 
Concerning the rest of the episode, it was pretty meh. Emilia Clarke's acting is getting extremely stale with the same exact tough girl persona in every single scene she's in. No emotional range to speak of. Littlefinger's batman voice remains as stupid as ever, ruining literally every scene he's in. Did not especially enjoy the Grey Worm - Missandei romance, though well acted. I could have sworn at one point she told Dany Grey Worm was her brother. Really hate it when they make significant deviations from the book such as Asha/Yara breaking into the Dreadfort and then leaving alive by way of Ramsay Snow (wat). This "Hound in the Vale" thing is almost equally as stupid. What sort of leverage does he hope to have at the Eyrie, an impenetrable fortress that may as well be a prison to any enemy of the Vale dumb enough to walk inside with a hostage and demands? Just leave Martin's work alone, there's nothing wrong with it. Some small, improvised scenes I highly enjoyed, don't get me wrong. Oberyn's "that's not a monster... that's just a baby" speech was really really good and Martin never wrote that. But big changes such as these will certainly have butterfly effects and most of the time they just don't make a God damn bit of sense. I gave it an eight though because I don't remember ever being disturbed by a TV show as much as I was Sunday night. And that's special to me.Â
1701	FirstoftheFistmen	2014-06-03	The last 15 minutes was superb. Exactly what I have come to expect from GoT. The first 45 minutes seemed like a lot of filler. The Grey Worm love story seemed to get more time than Jorrah's banishment.Â
1702	lil' ghost	2014-06-04	9/10

I'm sure a lot of the unsullied would feel the same way. Maybe it's just me though.This is scruffy lot for sure!Over at Rotten Tomatoes season 4 is running at 98%, as judged by TV critics 46 votes counted, these are accompanied by reviews , not all are as incisive as others, and RT makes the judgment call on how to score them. Still if one factored in a margin of error , it would be at least ~ 1.0 to ~ 1.5 times higher than here.AT IMDB from 584,374 user votes it is 9.5 , the margin of error there is probably bigger, hard to tell, but that's a large sample size, so one might guess an approval of about ~9.0.For those who vote with their remote with their HBO subscription (even taking into account pooling) 8.2 million (Ep. 8 total) (see Hibberd at Entertainment Weekly) is not a bad metric.We don't know what their rating vote is , but they do keep watching.GOT has matched it's 4 season's high 3 times this season.(Is this still the most pirated show around the world?)

1706	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-04	My dad has the best take on the meaning of the rambling beetle monologue (which, in my opinion, takes the cake as far as pointless wastes of time on the show go, even surpassing Talisa's long-winded backstory, Cat's "if I had only loved Jon Snow," and Littlefinger's divulging of his secret plans to anyone who asks):
Â 
"It's actually a jab at George. He's like the retard, obsessed with killing things, and no one can understand why."
Â 
I thought this episode was pretty good, except for the long take at Mole's Town at the beginning (seriously, THAT'S what you do a long take of? a whore belching the alphabet?), Missandei and Greyworm's irrelevant "romance" (how many times have she and Dany speculated about his junk? enough's enough), and of course the beetle soliloquy (really, this is what Tyrion says to his brother for what could be the last time?). Sometimes the writing on this show is so inept I wonder if they're messing with us.
Â 
I didn't mind revealing Sansa early, even though it was unnecessary. She hasn't been publicly unveiled, plus they want to show her starting to play the game. As far as changes on the show go, it's not awful.
Â 
The duel itself was awesome, although something snapped in me by the end. People with whom I was watching were actually crying when it was over. Bawling. I feel so bad for everyone, myself included. We're trying to stay invested in the story, trying to find new characters to cheer for, trying to keep hope alive, and George keeps ripping us apart. It's gotten to the point where I doubt that any victory can be anything but hollow and any ending can be anything but bittersweet.
Â 
Personally, I always thought Oberyn's death was a mistake. It's anticlimactic, abusive, and really just downright excessive. Enough, already. Geez.

1707	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-04	The burping was stupid and I actually felt bad for everyone involved in the writing, filming and even watching of that scene. It as stupid. 
What? She's a whore and these are commoners, so burping is amusing? Really? Fuck off.

Oh, don't take it so seriously. It was meant to convey the dingy, raucous nature of the brothel. Such an insignificant scene to complain about, especially as it lasted about 8 seconds.

Â 
I just thought that scene was a weird choice for a long take. Normally, long takes span a large area, involve lots of actors and extras, an require amazing choreography. They opted for circling around a table in a whorehouse.

1711	Frey Pies	2014-06-04	This is scruffy lot for sure!
Over at Rotten Tomatoes season 4 is running at 98%, as judged by TV critics 46 votes counted, these are accompanied by reviews , not all are as incisive as others, and RT makes the judgment call on how to score them. Still if one factored in a margin of error , it would be at least ~ 1.0 to ~ 1.5 times higher than here.
AT IMDB from 584,374 user votes it is 9.5 , the margin of error there is probably bigger, hard to tell, but that's a large sample size, so one might guess an approval of about ~9.0.
For those who vote with their remote with their HBO subscription (even taking into account pooling) 8.2 million (Ep. 8 total) (see Hibberd at Entertainment Weekly) is not a bad metric.
We don't know what their rating vote is , but they do keep watching.
GOT has matched it's 4 season's high 3 times this season.
(Is this still the most pirated show around the world?)


Â 
Not only that, but the large consensus is that GoT is having its best season so far. The IMDB scores reflect that. So far, episodes 2,6 and 8 of this season have higher scores than any episode from the previous seasons except for Rains of Castamere, which has a stunning 9.9.Â
1712	mediterraneo	2014-06-04	I liked this.
I was critical with some of the others, because of the dumbed down dialogues, but the late episodes, where people lie on things happened during this season, suffer less from this problem.
The duel was gruesome, as it should. Violence is better represented here than in some other added scene, like Sandor's numerous killings or what Bienne and Jaime did back in season two and three. Violence has consequences.
I was fearing (and I read "unsullied" sites and it seems it is not) that the way in which the Viper dies could have been too much for the viewers, in a "jumping the shark" way.
My fear was the reaction: "I'm tired of the gimmick of letting me affectionate to something just to kill it more and more gruseomly".
It seems people writing blogs over this are not expressing that feeling.
We will see next weeks ratings for the common people's reaction.
I liked the long time on the settings too. Fewer, longer scenes by geography, without juxtapositions: separated histories in the same container. It worked today.
1713	Bridgeburners	2014-06-04	I was, all in all, very frustrated with this episode. A lot of it just reminded me of how downhill the writing in this show has gone.
Â 
First there was Ygritte "shushing" Gilly with her finger. Even the show Vikings, which isn't "supposed" to be as well written as GoT, had the subtlety of just letting Ragnar conceal the little English kids so his raiders wouldn't see him, and then walk away. They show didn't have to bash us over the head with the fact that he was sparing him out of compassion. And Ygritte simply looking at her, then closing the curtain and walking away would have been both subtle and powerful, with us taking in the obvious realization that she's sparing her. But "nay" say the GoT writers.... the audience with under 20 IQ wouldn't understand what happened and we certainly can't leave any audience member behind, so like in a Saturday morning cartoon, they add that "shushing" detail just to clue us all in.
Â 
Danaerys banishing Jorah was way too rushed and haphazard. The writers realized that they didn't do any setup for it at all, and thought "oh shit we're near the end of the season, we have to do it quick!" So *boom boom*, and two quick scenes and five minutes later, he's banished. It was one of the most emotionally charged scenes in the book, and in the show it felt like she was just dealing with another shepherd with burned sheep.Â 
Â 
The symbolism of the beetle scene just barely relates at all to the forthcoming scene, or anything in the near future with Tyrion, really. I mean, the best thing I can really connect it to is Gregor Clegane, who takes lives without much consideration. Was Oberyn's spear supposed to be the donkey's leg that kicked the cousin to death? Either way, for such loose symbolism, that scene didn't at all deserve the time it got. Especially since the fight scene seemed pretty rushed and could have had its own set-up.
Â 
Finally, what was with Oberyn dancing around like a fairy-princess in a manner that doesn't at all apply to a real fight? I'm okay with his initial display to impress the fans, but after that, twirling your spear around is not how you utilize its range to keep your opponent at bay. Not that he really cared about doing that. While the book went through such painstaking detail about how he constantly tried to keep Gregor out of swinging distance with his spear, and even mentioned that one time he put himself in serious danger when he did slip into distance, show-Oberyn must have gone into Gregor's swinging distance at least 10 times, because he cared more about making a fancy impressive display than actually keeping himself alive. And what with his being able to do triple figure-skating spin jumps which are completely unrealistic in the scope of a fight, all immersion is lost, because we don't get to understand the intricate points of his danger. For example, in a normal fight, if someone was knocked to the ground and the oppressor had the height advantage, we'd understand that the other guy is in a bad position. But what about Oberyn... is this a dangerous position that he'll have to work hard to get out of, or will he be able to just do one of his triple spin jumps out of it? Whoops, there he goes.
Â 
Anyway, those are my major grievances. They handled Oberyn's death well, and it was one of my favourite scenes in the book series. However, as a whole, this episode was pretty bad.

1714	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-04	I object to people dismissing reader criticism of the show as us being "purists." We're not criticizing it just because it deviates from the book, but because it makes no sense and ruins the story.
Â 
Are we being purists when we wonder WTF they're doing spending more time on Missandei and Grey Worm's meaningless romance than Jorah's banishment? Or why Tyrion is giving an extended disquisition on the meaning of a retarded cousin crushing beetles? The irony of the latter scene is that Jaime actually interrupted him several times trying to say something more interesting, but Tyrion just kept plowing along.
Â 
That's just from one episode. Don't even get me started on the appalling neglect of the King in the North storyline (when that was still around) and the outright character assassination of Stannis.
1715	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-04	My dad has the best take on the meaning of the rambling beetle monologue (which, in my opinion, takes the cake as far as pointless wastes of time on the show go, even surpassing Talisa's long-winded backstory, Cat's "if I had only loved Jon Snow," and Littlefinger's divulging of his secret plans to anyone who asks):
Â 
"It's actually a jab at George. He's like the retard, obsessed with killing things, and no one can understand why."


I really like that theory. It makes complete sense considering how much fans complain about all the frequent deaths and what point in the story that scene is delivered (right before another unexpected death). At first I thought maybe it was a reference to God or "the Gods" but George R.R. Martin, in truth, is every character's God. And he is always criticized by the fans, so why wouldn't he also be subtly criticized by the characters as a mindless oaf killing things off for enjoyment? I didn't get the beetle speech at first (I was expecting either Jaime or Tyrion to explain the meaning of it eventually) and I can understand people getting upset with the length of the scene but I have to say I enjoy it more thanks to this comment.

Hear hear. As a show, I don't compare GoT to aSoIaF, I compare it to the likes of The Wire or Breaking Bad. Because of the constant plot contrivances, high school drama style dialogue, and about as much subtlety in delivery of ideas as a caveman knocking out his potential mate to drag her into his abode and have sex with her, GoT will never come close to the quality of some of the best shows. The thing is, the books are very high quality in those regards.Â 
Â 
I have absolutely no problem with creative license at all. GoT is a show and aSoIaF is a book series. Not only am I okay with, but in fact I encourage cutting scenes and characters or making plot changes to fit the show structure better. It's just that, sometimes, those changes they make are based in their shitty writing and inability to keep things consistent. So when we say "they should have just stuck to the way the book did it" it's because it would have been a hell of a lot more elegant, dramatic, clever, and consistent than the way they did it.
1717	Steelegrave	2014-06-04	The Hound is getting sick. She has the coin. She's near the East Coast just across from Braavos. Seems on track.

Â 
Exactly. I'm judging it on its own, and on its own it comes up short in a lot of ways. As far as the coherence of the plot and the quality of the writing, Game of Thrones comes nowhere near other creations of HBO. Some of the words they put in the characters' mouths and the things they have them do just make no sense whatsoever. Midway through Tyrion's declamation on beetles, an Unsullied with whom I was watching actually looked at me and asked, "Is this important? I'm bored." If that's the reaction you're getting from your viewers moments before a climactic duel to decide the fate of several main characters, then you've failed.
Â 
I expect any adaptation from one medium to another to make significant changes, such as eliminating/condensing characters/events. What I also expect, however, is for those changes to make sense and remain as faithful to the source material as possible. Unfortunately, most of the changes fail that test.

Personally I think people are continuingly comparing the show to the books rather than to other shows. S4 of GOT has been very good indeed.Â Exceeded by the best of BB perhaps but certainly better than anything else on TV right now. To watch an episode like this one and then rate it a 4 or a 5 is just ridiculous really. What does that make the latest tired police procedural or some cr*ppy soapÂ are they getting negative scores or something.
1720	RottenAppleFossoway	2014-06-04	I give S4E8 a 9/10. 
I had no qualms with the book deviations (Sophie was outstanding) and the duel was perfect, or as perfect as it could be. 
Nina Gold and D&D have their work cut out for them in casting the Dornish. How do you top Pedro's performance? The way his lines started low then gradually rose, crescendo-like was absolutely magnificent. Though I did miss "ELIAAAAA!"
 His death was just as awful as I imagined when reading it. Ellaria's reaction was heart-wrenching. Truly a masterful scene in my opinion.
1721	Ran	2014-06-04	For those who keep harping about the "Rotten Tomatoes" score as if it means anything much...I've applied what seems to be the RT algorithm to the forum's rankings of this episode -- 6 and higher is "fresh", 5 and under is "rotten". There are 642 "fresh" votes, meaning that the forum's RT score for the episode is ... 90.5%.So all the episodes that score about 8 on the forum are equal to 90%+ according to "Rotten Tomatoes".

The problem is that what most people here would consider rotten would be any score between 1-7. I see a lot of posts saying "This episode was disappointing, I expected better, etc" and then conclude with saying they gave it a six or a seven (even sometimes an eight).

S4 is only considered "very good" because the second half of aSoS was the most exciting fragment of the series. GRRM gets all the credit for that. The actual writing quality of the show has been slipping continuously. Season 1 was tight, and I would certainly consider it the best of the series. Their writing certainly hasn't improved, it has only gotten better source material to call upon. And season 4 is exceeded by the worst of BB, not just the best. But then, BB didn't really have an "off season".
Â 
Should this episode really be rated better than some crappy soap opera? Sure it has higher production value and special effects, but the writing and dialogue didn't seem any better to me TBH.

1725	David Selig	2014-06-04	Man I'm shocked by the 7.99 average rating for season 4. Well maybe not too shocked considering many on this forum. It's like George's books are the seven pointed star and the majority of people here are sparrows, devout to the bone. However, as a book reader, and someone whose favorite book of all time is a Storm of Swords I think season 4 (at least through episodes 1-8) has been the best season. I'm sure a lot of the unsullied would feel the same way. Maybe it's just me though.You make it sound as if the average rating is 3.99, not 7.99. 7.99 out of 10 is a still a high rating.Â Â Personally I think people are continuingly comparing the show to the books rather than to other shows. S4 of GOT has been very good indeed.Â Exceeded by the best of BB perhaps but certainly better than anything else on TV right now.I watched True Detective's S1 last week and I am currently catching up with Mad Men's last season, both are on a completely different level than GoT in pretty much every aspect IMO. Especially dialogue.And not just these. When I compare the GoT episodes to the best episodes I've seen, they fall way short the vast majority of the time. Thus no 10s or 9s from me with few exceptions. And when I find that an episode has had 2-3 terrible scenes and only one really good scene, I give it 4 or 5.

Â 
If I give an episode I didn't like of a show that I do a '1' (like this episode), it's not because I think that this episode is worse than almost everything else on tv. Â It's because I think it's worse than almost anything I *want* to watch on tv, which includes what I wanted this particular episode to be. Â Pretty much by definition, I can't be rating it against things I don't watch.

I can complain about how badly I think something was done and still be happier to have spent my time watching the episode than the "best" hour of reality tv ever filmed.

I agree fully. However, i would like to add that when  changes are made I do compare their take to what happens in the books. For the most part, with a very few exceptions, they fail miserably when altering storylines and dialogue . it's not because the books are my Holy Bible it's because GRRM is a much  better writer than anyone on staff at HBO. Shit I know people on this very board who could write this show better, just by sticking to the source as much as possible. 
If the changes were good I wouldn't complain. The Hound and Arya in the inn at the start of the season is a good example. Totally different take on that scene but I actually enjoyed it more. So yeah I'm pissed at change get but not due to the nature of adaptation but because it's just fucking bad. Like network TV terrible. "power is power", "nothing is nothing" "run back to your ships". All gag worthy.
1730	Relic	2014-06-04	I don't understand why we have a "nitpicking" thread. Makes it sound like all criticism is whiney and petty. And to make it worse there is a "positive nitpicking" thread which further adds to the impression. I suggest having those two threads renamed to "things I liked" and "things I didn't like" for here on out. Might help putting some of this constant squabbling over opinions to rest. 
All in favor?

Â 
Yeah, the writing has declined with each season. Season 1 was the best by far, and the standard by which all others are judged in my mind. The fact that the pace and scope of the source material has been picking up offsets the decline in the quality of writing.

Too true. We complain about a change that makes no sense or a waste of time and then get derided as being "purists." Well, it's not our fault that GRRM is a better writer than D&D. Excuse us for wanting believable characters, realistic plotlines, and interesting dialogue.

1733	I love Cersei	2014-06-04	Loved so much about this episode!Most of all: Sansa - wow! Exactly the way I wanted her to be in the books. I cheered for her when she looked in Petyr's eyes over the Vale lord's shoulder, and again when she walked down the steps - very much! Perfectly delivered by Sophie Turner. I really hope they won't go backwards with Sansa's development from here on in the show.Naked Missandei raises the score too; first the actress is very beautiful, and 2nd the chemistry between her and Grey Worm works well. The scene wasn't a waste of time; it adds to the story and its atmosphere, even if it isn't important - I know the important ongoings from the books anyhow. This I didn't know, and it doesn't destroy George R. R. Martin's telling or its goals because it doesn't interfere with either. The scene's addition is comparable to a lovingly built set, or the use of detailed costumes, in a way. A nice bonus on its own, but a lot of these "little things" combined can make the difference between a good show and a bad.Emilia Clarke's acting! when expelling Jorah - fantastic. Dany's eyes staring nowhere while Jorah tries to make (eye) contact. It really comes through how much she cares for him.The Beetle-Guy/Gregor parallel and the brothers Jaime and Tyrion laughing together for a short while before Tyrion delved deeper into (t)his story. Again, good acting there. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's skills for sure have grown with the GoT series.So much more. Arya's laughing when told about her aunt's death. Made me laugh out loud. Oberyn's behavior and artistic fighting style. So cool. Even the graphical display of his skull crushing - although in general I hate being made to watch brutality for brutality's sake on TV - worked very well and made the scene as strong as it was.9/10
1734	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-04	This is scruffy lot for sure!Over at Rotten Tomatoes season 4 is running at 98%, as judged by TV critics 46 votes counted, these are accompanied by reviews , not all are as incisive as others, and RT makes the judgment call on how to score them. Still if one factored in a margin of error , it would be at least ~ 1.0 to ~ 1.5 times higher than here.AT IMDB from 584,374 user votes it is 9.5 , the margin of error there is probably bigger, hard to tell, but that's a large sample size, so one might guess an approval of about ~9.0.For those who vote with their remote with their HBO subscription (even taking into account pooling) 8.2 million (Ep. 8 total) (see Hibberd at Entertainment Weekly) is not a bad metric.We don't know what their rating vote is , but they do keep watching.GOT has matched it's 4 season's high 3 times this season.(Is this still the most pirated show around the world?)

Wow that's crazy. This forum really is full of sparrows!
1735	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-04	You make it sound as if the average rating is 3.99, not 7.99. 7.99 out of 10 is a still a high rating.Â Â I watched True Detective's S1 last week and I am currently catching up with Mad Men's last season, both are on a completely different level than GoT in pretty much every aspect IMO. Especially dialogue.And not just these. When I compare the GoT episodes to the best episodes I've seen, they fall way short the vast majority of the time. Thus no 10s or 9s from me with few exceptions. And when I find that an episode has had 2-3 terrible scenes and only one really good scene, I give it 4 or 5.
I'm shocked that it's currently ranked 3rd out of 4 seasons. That's just plain bananas.

1736	HelenaExMachina	2014-06-04	^You realise only a select group of people tend to.vote each week right? There are plenty on the boards who are enjoying this season who dont vote, which brings down the score. And opinions will always differ, especially when the writing of the show seems so...different from previous seasons
1737	Ran	2014-06-04	There are plenty on this forum who stopped watching after the first season, as well, who aren't voting.I don't think we can draw any conclusions based on the hypothetical votes of people not voting.
1738	SJB	2014-06-04	More RTizing of scores:
Highest rated episode of the series, according to the forum, is "Blackwater". It has a 9.5 rating. Its RTized rating is 98% fresh.
Lowest rated episode of the series according to the forum is "Breaker of Chains". It has a 6.98 rating, last I looked. Its RTized rating is 80% fresh.
Here's the RTized score of all the episodes this season:
Episode 1: 8.18 -> 96% fresh
Episode 2: 8.41 -> 95% fresh
Episode 3: 6.98 -> 80% fresh
Episode 4: 7.78 -> 86% fresh
Episode 5: 7.40 -> 89% fresh
Episode 6: 8.76 -> 97% fresh
Episode 7: 8.128 -> 96% fresh
Episode 8: 8.15 -> 90% fresh
Season to date: 91% fresh.


Â 
This might be a very stupid question, but i'm fairly new to the boards.
Â 
What exactly do you mean with the 'fresh %' ?
1739	Ran	2014-06-04	Since people keep holding up the notion that the forum's average episode ratings are "far" from sites such as Rotten Tomatoes -- which rates movies/TV shows based on collating reviews and determining whether the "fresh" (positive) or "rotten" (negative) reviews are most predominant -- I figured I'd apply RT's algorithim to the votes for past episodes. RT determines anything it deems 60% or higher to be a positive review, anything under that to be a negative review, so I just counted up the total voters who voted 6 to 10, divided that number by total voters, and figured out what percentage of the total ratings were "positive".So, 96% fresh means that 96% of the votes were 6 or higher.
1740	SJB	2014-06-04	Thx!
1741	Rashtibram	2014-06-04	Personally, I consider GoT to be so far ahead of all other TV (at the moment) that when I give it a six or a seven it's more like I'm giving it a 46 or 47 out of 50 (with the first 40 points already assumed). But a lot of people here do seem to consider a six or a seven to be a negative rating.
Â 


It's a 7, when trying very hard not to compare it with the books.Â 
Â 
Starting with the Wall and Beetles, that was just nonsense. Missadei/Grey Worm was rather more interesting, but given way too much focus. I don't appreciate Sansa's transformation or his relationship with Baelish. I don't understand what Sandor and Arya are doing in the episode. Along with so much nonsense and inconsistency.Â 
Â 
Then the important scenes. The Northern part with Theon and the Boltons was actually pretty solid. No complaints there. Jorah's banishment, in my opinion, was handled reeeeally badly. Dany had next to no emotions about it and it just came out of nowhere. And the duel. It was flashy and cool, I give you that, but it deserved much, much more focus, screen time and build-up.Â 
Â 
All in all, I feel really underwhelmed. Obviously the show holds little shock value to me, but I don't feel like they handled this one properly.


Â 


7/10
Â 
Good:
Â 
- Loved the duel. The sudden and horrific nature of Oberyn's defeat in the books was a huge shock moment for me, and one (unlike the Red Wedding) which I didn't see coming, so i'm really glad they got it right in the show and didn't tone it down at all.
Â 
- The Sansa / Littlefinger scenes in the Vale were excellent.
Â 
- The Moat Cailin scene was great. Alfie Allen did a fantastic job of showing Reek almost falling apart while presenting himself as Theon Greyjoy in front of the Ironborn. The scene wouldn't have been anywhere near as compelling if he'd just strolled in and out of there confident with no signs at all of the frail, broken person behind the masquerade.
Â 
Â 
Bad:
Â 
- The love story between Grey Worm and Missandei is just awful. Pointless filler content that's probably going to drag on into the next two episodes.
Â 
- Arya and the Hound arriving in the Vale seemed like a pointless deviation to me, and the way Arya bursted out in laughter seemed so forced and random.
Â 
Â 
Indifferent:
Â 
- The attack on Mole's Town was forgettable.
Â 
- Not quite sure what to make of Tyrion and Jaime's conversation before the trial. I was waiting for some kind of point to the whole bug crushing story, but it never arrived. Perhaps the writers deliberately left it a mystery to get fans talking and coming up with crazy theories? Who knows.
Â 
- Jorah getting caught and banished was okay. Certainly not Emilia Clarke's worst performance this season.
Â 
Edit: Perhaps i'm being a bit generous giving the episode a 7/10 going by previous scores i've given this season. There was a lot of pointless filler content and bad deviations. I'm sure once i'm over the excitement of the duel scene the episode will probably seem more like a 6/10 to me.


It's very hard for me to count reviews like these as being positive, yet they would both count as "fresh" if we're going by the "Rotten Tomato" spectrum.
1742	Ran	2014-06-04	Indeed. And that's how RT works -- there may be reviews in there that you think are pretty mezzo-mezzo, and those are regarded as "fresh".The other thing is... I think for my part, the reason I've never thrown a "rotten" review at something is that there's a certain minimum of craft, production value, performance, etc. that is simply kind of default for a prestige show like this.Others, of course, may rate differently. But then, critics and the people who vote at places like RT also each have their own unique criteria.
1743	ormurin	2014-06-04	Like Ned Stark, this episode was perfectly executed Â .

I felt that this episode was so far from anything that GRRM penned, I ended up giving it a 1. Â But a solid 1, because there is actually a fight scene in the books.
1745	boojam	2014-06-04	For those who keep harping about the "Rotten Tomatoes" score as if it means anything much...I've applied what seems to be the RT algorithm to the forum's rankings of this episode -- 6 and higher is "fresh", 5 and under is "rotten". There are 642 "fresh" votes, meaning that the forum's RT score for the episode is ... 90.5%.So all the episodes that score about 8 on the forum are equal to 90%+ according to "Rotten Tomatoes".Posting the Rotten Tomatoes data is for informational purposes only , no appeal to authority intended.In fact there cannot be.I can't find on RT what their criterion is for their scoring. Someone reads the reviews and gives it a 1 or 0, so to speak.I don't know how much weight to give to their reviews, but at least all of those are reviews.There are, to some extent , some more expansive than others , an analysis and reasons for aesthetic judgments are given, some better than others.(It's not some visceral opinion , mostly!, as I see in the voting elsewhere.)For instance for this episode only 30 reviews are given there must be more media outlets than that which have TV critics?For instance they have David Malitz's review at the Washington Post , but not Alyssa Rosenberg's at the Washington Post for this very same episode.Nor do they have LA Times critic Alan Eyerly's or Erik Kain's in Forbes.Or who knows how many others.Oddly in the only solidly rotten tomato by Jake Cole at Slant ... he liked the Meereen parts the best! Had harsh words for Alex Graves's staging of the duel, which I think were right on... but his criticism of the Ramasy - Roose interchange makes no sense.I do like reading reviews , don't take their 'ratings' seriously , they are just a 'windage' meter.I don't know what your take on the IMDB users poll is? It it similar to here, mostly there is just a number and no rational , but there are , as of today, 10387 votes, I sure would not want to read 10,000 reviews.I do like Myles McNutt reviews at Cultural Learnings, as are your alls, they a long , careful and elaborated , I like seeing that.This forum circumscribes , well at those that comment, a special community , but there are other views, some by people who take a special interest in this visual dramatic narrative adaptation of ASoIaF.In the end there is a loose but important arbiter of the show, that is how many viewers there are.... 7.2 million first viewing last episode, 8.2 million for the evening. That's a pretty solid endorsement, those are votes by paid subscription , some way or another. (I don't think pirate viewings are counted!)(By the by Entertainment Weekly sure is great sources of views and information about the show, I guess James Hibberd is quite a fan.

I must have been doing this too and not realizing it! Most of my ratings are between 7-10. I only give a 7 if I feel it's very underwhelming or if they screwed something up that I felt strongly about. But that typically only happens once or twice each season. This season I've mainly given out 9's with at least two 10's already.

--Sansa entering "The Game", I wonder what she plans on giving Littlefinger.
Â 
--Danerys and Mormont's scene was sad to watch. Â I think she is very ungrateful.Â 
Â 
Well it's sad to say but the season is coming down the end. Â Cant wait for next weeks Battle At Castle Black.
1750	JagLover	2014-06-05	Â 
Â 
Â 
Too true. We complain about a change that makes no sense or a waste of time and then get derided as being "purists." Well, it's not our fault that GRRM is a better writer than D&D. Excuse us for wanting believable characters, realistic plotlines, and interesting dialogue.
Â 
"Power is power" and "Nothing is nothing." Gods save us.
Â 
Â 
Aye.


Â 
as far as I am concerned in 8 episodes, nearly 8 hours, the only lengthy scene that might even be considered a waste of time is the raid on the dread fort (and even then I don't consider it as such). Aside from that every scene has developed a key character or progressed the plot in some way. Based on only a third of a book but they have brought in AFFC material for people like Sansa and Brienne.Â 
Â 
Based on the best section of the books I agree, but they have nailed nearly every key scene.
Â 
I think the quality of the writing is a matter for debate and personal taste. Personally I loved the beetle scene and thought it very apt that a man beingÂ on trial for his life by something like trial by combat would speculateÂ and reminisce about something like this.
Â 
On the things that can be objectionable measured like production values and acting performances that was again very very good, and better than most movies.
Â 
Yes the show can seem a bit rushed, but that is due to the sheer number of characters and material to get through (which is why I have always argued for cutting back the cast list when they move into AFFC/ADWD proper). There simply aren't loads of wasted minutes that can be given to other storylines so they are more faithful to the books.

This season I've mainly given out 9's with at least two 10's already.I also factor in music and VFX.Ramin Djawadi has done a lot of work on film and TV and he is a more than above average film and TV composer, not an Alex North , but very good.Has been nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards but not for GOT. In my mind it's scandalous the show has some of his best work to date and the TV Academy seems oblivious , it is really a puzzle about why no nomination.I have to say D&D seem to have him write only one new 'theme' (well maybe 1 and some fractions) per season since season 1 , he does rework , with some invention closing sequence backgrounds , he does do a lot of other work, but this show has made him sort of famous. I have in-laws who are musicians (of the classical music kind) and they always remark on the quality of the score. So I don't know what goes on.I also factor in the CGI-VFX ... this one is subtle... because I am not talking dragons here(which are so different form the multitude of cgi dragons out there right now), but I did not realize , until after the first season that there was a TON of 'landscape fill in' and it all looked good! This kind of thing is below the radar of the casual viewer.Those are points that's been steady on for four seasons now.(I wish they would put, I don't think they do, the VFX featurette on the DVDs , I don't think they do.)

They think about the acting, writing, FX, editing, etc, and then give a rating. Other people put a ton of weight on the writing, which I agree is very important, but IMO maybe some people put too much weight on it or are overly critical. Again IMO the writing hasn't deteriorated rapidly, and as someone said there's only really been one throwaway scene this season. I understand though that others see things completely differently. What's interesting is that people could read our responses and they'd probably wonder if we're watching the same show.

1753	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-05	Wrestled with the score for this one, and I've decided that I'm just going to go all in with it -- it's a 6 for me. That's the third episode I've rated a 6 across the whole series.
Â 
Why? Littlefinger, the man without a plan, dimishing the character yet further, and needlessly. Dark Queen Sansa, so ham-fisted. Arya's reveal, and the sinking feeling that the next time we see the Hound and Arya they'll be trudging back down the high road unmolested with no one think that maybe they should inform Robin Arryn or Petyr Baelish. The endless Orson speech. The heartfelt promise that he wouldn't die, telegraphing that he was indeed going to die. The horribly frenetic editing of the fight scene, the direction choices that left it impersonal, the choreography that necessitated so much stunt double work which meant less intimate scenes and poor pacing. It just was not good at all. For what should have been the most memorable fight scene in the novels, they turned in something that was, frankly, forgettable up to the final moment.
Â 
The good stuff: the attack on Mole's Town, the Missandei-Grey Worm material, the Sansa and Littlefinger dialog after she revealed herself to the Vale lords, Moat Cailin, Pedro Pascal's performance.


Â 
The Missandei-Grey Worm material? What on earth does that have to do with anything?

The fact that so many people say 'Arya laughing was the cutest' tells you how badly they have fucked up her arc, she is arguably one of the darkest characters in the book..

If someone is trying kill you , NO FENCING!, Sandor must punch three guys or more , for a count, then they get him down and are kicking him, that's a brawl!It reminded me of Richard Lester's The Four Musketeers (1974), Lester said he had watched the earlier versions of the story on film, and said something like "If you are really trying to hurt or kill someone in a sword fight, you don't stage it like an Olympics controlled fencing"! When I saw the brawling dirty play in that film, I thought "Yeah!".I do think this last episode suffered from some compositional problems that a really great editor with a good eye could have fixed... but , in general, they and their editors do a good job with this odd Jaunting about narrative drama.

The show is not about being the T.V version of the books, it is a whole lot different, plus there are bigger differences than what you pointed out. the show is based on asoiaf,But we should look at it as an independent series based on the books. I find it sad that people are rating the show by how much it resembles the books. Plus, remember that all the episodes are approved by George R.R Martin.Â

Â 
I don't dispute that it was well-acted. I don't dispute that fleshing out side characters is important. The issue is how much time it took - the opportunity cost. Fleshing out side characters should not consume such a large portion of an episode, particularly when so much else is being neglected.

I would disagree.Â 
Â 
Mereen is going to be a keyÂ  location next year and who do we have there that is interesting?. Aside from the Queen of wood we have Ser Baristan (who I like but cant carry a season) and, gulp, Dario. It is going to be vital that we care about Grey Worm and Missandrei. Added to which following their story makes the whole Slavers BayÂ story less some sort of white man's burden of Dany bringing civilisation to the savages.
Â 
There isn't much, if any, flab to cut out of the series. But many will tell you they are looking forward to the Greyjoys, Quentyn, Faegon etc being added next season.

Â 
In case you have reading comprehension issues and missed the 50,000 posts by people explaining that their issue isn't with change itself, but the nature of said changes, and the inferior writing of changed material when compared to the original i would suggest backtracking in this thread and re-reading.Â
1768	OberynBlackfyre	2014-06-05	I'm giving it a 7 and that's me being generous. Â 
Â 
Â 
The beetle monologue was completely unneeded and did NOTHING to further Jaime/Tyrions relationship. Â I understand the metaphor they were getting at, but it just wasn't symbolic enough to garner a dialogue that could have been used for something WAY better. Â Â 
Â 
Â 
The fight scene I completely agree with Ran. Â The editing and stunt double work took away some of the needed ferocity. Â I wanted to see the anger on Oberyns face and the Mountain getting more and more annoyed. Â Instead they made it seem like Oberyn was concerned about playing to the crowd. Â  And is it really that hard to make him scream "ELLIIIAAAA!!" as he stabs the Mountain?? Â The dialogue they are using to replace some of the most epic scenes in the series is laughable. Â  Kinda like the "Only Cat" miss. Â 
Â 
Sansa as Maleficent made me giggle. Â However they are making LF look far too much under her control when we are two books ahead and she STILL doesn't seem near as confident as she does in the show now. Â
1769	King Rickon Stark II	2014-06-05	I found the Grey Worm and Messindei scene to be cute but in all honesty the final scene just somehow didn't seem right, I mean I feel as I didn't get that rush of excitement seeing Oberyn impale Gregor with the spear.
1770	Dolorous Gabe	2014-06-05	Long time reader, first time poster. Much like the rest of season 4, I enjoyed the episode overall but I had numerous problems with it. Most of the issues have already been mentioned (GW/Missandei, beetles,) so I'll just add one I've not yet noticed:
Â 
"If you die before you say her name, Ser, I will hunt you through all seven hells"
Â 
Sorry if someone else has mentioned it but I was really looking forward to the above line being performed by Pedro Pascal and it wasn't delivered. I'd love to know why D&D occasionally ignore such gold from the books. Dolorous Edd got a decent line but he's largely been ignored despite some of the best gallows humour I've ever read (I admit I'm something of a fan!).
1771	Dolorous Gabe	2014-06-05	ToÂ all you complainers who seem to be retaining a set of the books anally and score episodesÂ less than 5. Stop watching. Maybe you would enjoy Survivor or American Idol more.
I have seen all the TV episodes and am reading the first book at present. I am not enjoying it as much as I should because I know what is going to happen. So the TV show can't be that muchÂ different as you all imply.
Try reading a James Bond book written by Ian Fleming. The movies are mostly nothing like them.


Â 
The 1st season of the series is pretty much exactly the same as the book. That steadily changes. This season there are more changes and many seem unnecessary. I'm still enjoying it, but I would argue they have got it wrong. If seasons 1-3 were more Peter Jackson's LoTR, season 4 is more Peter Jackson's The Hobbit. There previously were good reasons for changing things to keep the story moving in adapting a lengthy source material with so many characters, but season 4 has condensed what is the smallest section of the story so far (roughly 400 pages, less than half of ACoK and AGoT) into a whole season, and as such they have been adding unnecessary extras to pad it out (much like Peter Jackson's The Hobbit). It's sad to me because ASoS was my favourite book in ASoIaF so far.
Â 
It hasn't been bad, it just feels like for once D&D have got it wrong. If they think they're going to finish the whole thing at this pace in 7 seasons they're delusional.
1772	Ravi Seaworth	2014-06-06	Depends on the mindset. I don't watch the show expecting a literal transcription of the books, to the point of using the same dialogue, such that if they make changes, then they have to give a very good reason for that or else I get very upset. No, they have a multitude of reasons to change the source material. Most of the time, it's to simplify, which is perfectly understandable given the complexity of the story.
Sometimes, they just need to change for the sake of the medium. It's completely different to portray motives and emotions of a character in a chapter and do that in a one-hour episode without the support of the narrative to do it. Once you make these changes, you may have to make more significant changes to at least try to preserve the consistency of the story. One example is Craster's keep. This doesn't always work well, but it's not necessarily true that the best option is to stick to the books. Regardless, I cannot take the critics of some users seriously, when these derive only by their fanatical devotion to the source material. It's not different from those hardcore Star Wars or LOTR fans.

Â 
And I can't take many of the 10/10 scorers seriously given that they openly admit the episode wasn't perfect but are giving that score anyway in an attempt to counter someone else's score.
1774	WexPyke	2014-06-06	If someone disagrees with how D and D are implementing the source material it does not mean by default that they are anal or they have slavish devotion. I think the changes this year show D and D may not fully understand or appreciate the story and there want to call themselves "creators" of the series may be motivating them to screw it up.  
The handling of the pardon for Jorah between season one and now shows a real naivete on their part. Their simplification is creating issues and they are not good enough writers or directors to foresee their errors.

1775	Bridgeburners	2014-06-06	Though I'm a reader, I base my criticism of the show (I gave this ep a 3 btw) based on my comparison of it to other shows. If you compare it to, like, The Wire or Sopranos, the writing is just extremely juvenile, lack any form of subtlety whatsoever, and is an obvious attempt to keep everybody in the audience up with what's happening, while insulting the intelligence of most of them. And it's not like I have an amazing memory and can remember characters two-three seasons later; I'm very susceptible to forgetting these kinds of details. But that's what recaps are for. You can't cater to forgetful people like me at the expense of the flow of the story.
Â 
Even with my latest big grievance with the show, I compare it to the show Vikings, which is actually not all that well written, but at least is self aware. I compare Ygritte sparing Gilly to Ragnar Lothbrok sparing a little English child during a raid. Ragnar sees him, then covers him with a cloth and walks away, leaving us, the audience, to understand the painfully obvious fact that he spared him out of compassion, but doing so in a way that doesn't kill the actual impact of the scene. Ygritte, when she "shushed" Gilly (i.e. put her finger on her mouth and said 'shhhh') was the GoT writers needing to go the extra mile for us because we're such fucking idiots that we couldn't have figured out what happened had they gone the more impactful, and less cartoonish route of her just seeing Gilly and covering the curtains.Â 
Â 
Then, remember that scene with Brienne and Hot Pie? I'm totally fine with them feeling the need to condense her story (though it was one of my favourites in FFC), and having them use their own creative license to have her see Hot Pie. That's cool. And sure, maybe for that (not so) humorous angle, you can have her annoyed by his kidney pie speech. But then they continue that frustration in the most absolutely absurd way, when he comes back to talk to them (and she opens with 'not about kidney pie again') and tells them that he saw fucking Arya, then begins to tell her the story and she says 'the quick version, please'. Are you fucking kidding me? 'The quick version?!' You just got this miracle fucking lead of a guy who saw Arya with his own eyes, and you're so annoyed by his kidney pie story that you have to rush him? No, sit the fuck down and squeeze every little detail out of him that you can! But the show has to be all sassy and relevant, and relate to us by having Brienne get annoyed with the fat kid who talks about kidney pie. I remember, in FFC, how difficult it was for her to scrape any fragment of a minor detail from people, and how she grilled people down to every last detail if she thought she got just a scent of the right direction.Â 
Â 
Â 
This is not them being 'blasphemous' by straying from the source material (most of us critics are not that irrational). This is just bad writing. The thing that's most shameful to us readers is that a brilliant book series with amazing writing is being adapted into this high fantasy with teen drama level writing.

Â 
Right, if we have a problem with the show's writing, we're fanatics slavishly obsessed with the source material who condemn any change as blasphemy. This accusation tells us more about our accusers than ourselves. Even on its own - without reference to any source material - it's just not good writing, plain and simple. I can handle deviations from the source material so long as they make sense.

Â 
Exactly. I have actually really enjoyed some of the added scenes. Many others I just cannot stand and skip on rewatch (*cough* Baelish brothel monologues *cough*)
Â 
There is one thing I found disturbing. When questioned about the characterisation of Mace Tyrell, Brian Cogman said "Yeah we made him a buffoon. I don't care if he isn't like that in the books. Its funny!" As they keep getting positive reinforcement from the ratings, they will continue to grow in their hubris I fear.

Â 
Yes, some added scenes have been great. I have no problem with them expanding on things or even changing them to fit on TV. What I have a problem with is wasting time on their own subplots (Missandei/Grey Worm's romance) or making changes that detract from the story ("YOLO Robb" over man-after-Ned's-own-heart Robb). The fact that there's best-selling, beloved source material as a guide just makes the bad changes all the more inexcusable.

Â 
Indeed.
Â 
Taken on its own the Grey Worm/Missandei sequences are beautiful etc.... but they come at the cost of:
1) The development of the characters of the dragons and how that represents Dany's problems with trying to be a 'ruler' while still being an adolescent girl herself
2) The 100,000 strong army we haven't seen since the start of last season
3) Stannis
Â 
A big problem I have with the whole Crasters sequence was that it was cobbled together and a huge lost opportunity. They could have had Team Bran trying to sneak their way through the outliers of the army. They could have still had them captured and done the 'Brandor' thing.
Â 
So we are supposed to believe Jon went to Craster's for Bran, then didn't even bother asking the wives about him and hasn't spoken of him since? Much better to have had Sam make the Promise to Bran last season then have Jon go to Crasters to silence them (as was the official reason) and also possibly skirmish/gather intel on Mance's movements. All invented sequences and all far better for pushing the tension for the coming battle. They have dropped the ball on the entire Wall storyline for 3 seasons in a row now.
Â 
Edit:
But we got to hear about beetles being squashed!

1780	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-06	From reading the reviews of these episodes over the the last few seasons it's pretty obvious that there's a pretty large consensus on these forums that the writing has gone down hill big time since the first season (which I don't agree with). Also, there's always a few comments of people so frustrated with the show that they're given up.Â What I find pretty amusing is if people on these boards represented the entire viewing audience the show might be in trouble of getting the axe lol. That's the only conclusion I can make considering this season is currently ranked 3rd out of 4 seasons by episode average. Thank the gods it's the complete opposite outside of these boards. Most people I talk to enjoy this season the most, and thankfully Season 4 has broken all previous Game of Thrones ratings records and is about to surpass The Sopranos as the most popular HBO show ever.Â

My favourite season so far as well (and it looks like it will end with two great episodes)Â . If you looking for poor writing look at Dany in S2, most of the invented material has been pretty decent this season.

You have to factor in that this season is heavilyÂ  based on the second half of Storm of Swords;Â  probably the most popular book in the whole series.Â  The source material is solid, so It's no wonder people are enjoying it, it's just frustrating to see all the mistakes that have been made in translatingÂ  it to televison.Â

I agree there have been mistakes. I'll also concede there have been changes from the source material that don't make too much sense. I just think there's a difference on how upset/disappointed/frustrated some people get from those changes. Personally, it doesn't upset me that much, because overall I believe the final product is still some of the best television that's ever been produced. The only time a change from the source material made me furious was the House of the Undying in the S2 Finale. The imagery from that chapter, even if they didn't include the prophecies, would have been incredible to see on TV.Â

That's because:
Â 
1) The production value is still fantastic. Note that most of the criticisms (mine included) regards entirely the writing. You still have a massive budget making all the costumes spot on, the settings extremely appealing, etc.
Â 
2) The series is still based on a book series that's written amazingly. The credit for the great scenes, strong plot points, great dialogue, etc. goes 100% to GRRM. What do many people consider the best dialogue scene in season 3? Jamie's tub scene, which was a watered down version of his scene in aSoS. This season? Probably Tyrion's trial, which again, takes fragments of the amazingly written scene in aSoS.
Â 
When it comes to the actual writing and plot, show-only viewers absolutely love the brilliant work that GRRM did, but cannot distinguish which parts were his and which were the work of the show writers. Book readers can make that distinction, and from what we can see (in terms of writing, not production value, etc), all the great stuff came straight out of the books, and in almost every matter that the show writers decided to take creative liberty, it turned it towards the worse. Look at my last post for two examples I had of big grievances in the writing (Ygritte shushing Gilly and Brienne rushing Hot Pie.) My grievance had nothing to do with the fact that they were creative licenses and everything to do with how badly written those parts were. You would never catch shitty writing like that in aSoIaF, or in shows like The Wire or Sopranos.

Yeah. The house of the Undying was a huge disapointment.Â  I tolerated, Dany's lacklustre season 2 storyline because iÂ  Knew the payoff was going to be worth it.Â  The House of the Undying was one of my favourite chapters in clash. The sense of otherness it provoked was compelling, and It was packed full of unforgettable images. What made it to the screen was an utter joke in comparison.
Â 
I don't think the show is on a downward spiral, and in a lot of ways season 2 was probably the worst, but It still suffers from very inconsistant writing, and in my mind scenes like the bug smashing demote the series from being a great showÂ  to being a merely good one. It's still very watchable. butÂ  i wouldn't list it as one of my all-time favourite shows. The books series on the other hand is definitely top 5.

Maybe that doesn't mean it's better, but if I had to choose one or the other it would be GOT. The Sopranos is probably still my favorite show of all time, but I don't even know if it's fair to compare Sopranos/Wire to Game of Thrones. It's like apples to oranges. I wouldn't compare a George R.R. Martin novel to a Cormac McCarthy novel. Was the writing in Sopranos/Wire better than Game of Thrones? Absolutely. But Game of Thrones is fantasy and it's a sprawling epic, so I don't take it as seriously and enjoy it more than the Wire, and quite possibly Sopranos. That's probably why I'm able to appreciate it more, and why it's one of my favorite TV shows ever.Â
1789	HelenaExMachina	2014-06-06	News on a Game of Thrones
Â 

Â 
HBO has crowned a new ratings king. Fantasy hit Game of Thrones has officially surpassed mob drama The Sopranos to become the most-watched show in the premium cable networkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s history, HBO confirmed for the first time Thursday.
With two episodes remaining in the fourth season, Thrones has an average gross audience of 18.4 million viewers across all platforms. That surpasses the previous record set by the 2002 peak season of The Sopranos, which had an average gross audience of 18.2 million viewers per episode. Last season of Thrones had an average gross audience of 14.4 million viewers per episode. The news comes as Thrones has set several recent ratings records for its own performance this season.

What's wrong with that type of comparison? I just finished Catch 22, a book about soldiers in WW2, and I find myself making comparisons between it and a Malazan Book of the Fallen, a series that, unlike aSoIaF, calls upon the supernatural in almost every paragraph, making it unmistakably high fantasy. But the style of soldiers using sardonic humour and satirically ridiculous scenario in the midst of a war whose grimness is borderline absurd is very similar between the two.
Â 
If I were to compare a show to aSoIaF, it would be Breaking Bad more than any. Both are very much less about major overarching issues and more about intimate character growths. And both have that common element that they're able to build such a strong setting, through dialogue alone, between characters for whom the stakes are so highly established that you find yourself soaking every word of the conversations. Both aSoIaF and Breaking Bad carry this trait for me, but I can't say the same about GoT. So I'm curious, why do you enjoy GoT more than these other shows? It's not Malazan-like in that it flaunts the supernatural high fantasy elements everywhere it can, in fact, it's quite the opposite. For me, with GoT it's fun to revisit those "big scenes" like the Red Wedding, Oberyn fight, or the whole Blackwater episode. But I just can't imagine doing a full re-watch of seasons 2, 3, or 4.

Â 
Â 
I guess I enjoy Game of Thrones, because there's nothing else like it on TV. The great episodes are just very entertaining. When it's good it doesn't even feel like a TV show. The fantasy elements, size of the cast, different locations make it epic in size. It's pure escapist entertainment, and overall I enjoy it enough to give the writing mistakes a little pass. And the character development for the most part is still there. Most of the actors are top notch. So I find little to not enjoy about the show. On the other hand The Wire will always be a more socially important show than Game of Thrones, but for me it's not as enjoyable to watch as GOT for the reasons stated above.Â

Arya's hysterical laughing at the Hound and her constant misfortune; Â Sansa's testimony for Littlefinger; The attack on Mole's Town; Jorah being banished and Greyworm's strange romance with Missandei. Â All great parts. Â The only thing I wasn't to keen on was how fast they moved through Theon's part in the capturing of Moat Cailin.
Â 
Of course, the duel was the highlight, filled with intensity and drama, and the giant's confession was great.
Â 
10/10
1793	Jdawg Laurence	2014-06-06	My favourite season so far as well (and it looks like it will end with two great episodes)Â . If you looking for poor writing look at Dany in S2, most of the invented material has been pretty decent this season.


Agreed! Â Dany seemed like a whiny wimp in most of season 2, and she's not supposed to be like that until basically the end of this season.
Â 
Some of the writing has been strange, such as Bran going to Craster's Keep, but overall it's been a damned good season, aside from maybe 2 episodes that were sub-par. Â

I guess I enjoy Game of Thrones, because there's nothing else like it on TV. The great episodes are just very entertaining. When it's good it doesn't even feel like a TV show. The fantasy elements, size of the cast, different locations make it epic in size. It's pure escapist entertainment, and overall I enjoy it enough to give the writing mistakes a little pass. And the character development for the most part is still there. Most of the actors are top notch. So I find little to not enjoy about the show. On the other hand The Wire will always be a more socially important show than Game of Thrones, but for me it's not as enjoyable to watch as GOT for the reasons stated above.Â 


Â 
The Wire was the greatest achievement in a modern world of hugely improved television drama thanks largely to HBO. It was absolutely stunning and will take some beating, though I have greater personal love for Six Feet Under. I read all the ASoIaF books within 2 months after watching the TV series up to the end of season 3 and am now a massive fan of the books. I still love the TV series but somehow I knew I would love the books from watching the show.
Â 
Part of me wishes I had read the books first as I'd love to know how I'd react to RW in the books without knowing it was coming. Seems to me D&D did a stunning job with RW though and Michelle Fairley's work was absolutely incredible. I always felt it seemed less of a shock in the books with Robb not being a POV character and the many references foretelling it but I guess knowing it was coming made it easy to see the signs.
Â 
I'm quite torn on season 4 because with this being the first time I've watched the show having read the books I feel more underwhelmed than I was on previous seasons and I'm worried I'm judging it harshly as a new fan of the books. They seem to have added more of their own stuff this season though. I would have expected them to go further into AFFC and ADWD given how the whole season has been based upon less than half the material of AGOT and ACOK. Feels like they've been padding it out too much with unnecessary stuff.

All right, I see what you're saying. To be honest, shows like Vikings and Spartacus have enough of that fantasy/escapist entertainment aspects for me, and they seem purer and more thrilling in those aspects than GoT. But then, GoT is much richer in character development, narrative, and dialogue than those shows, just a lot weaker than the shows like The Wire, Sopranos, and Breaking Bad. It seems like GoT is more of a jack-of-all-trades but best in none kind of show. I feel like Vikings and Spartacus are far better than GoT in terms of thrilling escapism and pure entertainment factors, and The Wire & Sopranos are far better than GoT in terms of dialogue and narrative, but GoT is far better than those aforementioned shows in the reversed categorical aspects, if you know what I mean. (Well, maybe it's not better than BB in escapism, because BB has quite a bit of escapism with Walter's insane machinations that should never work in real life.)

The RW didn't feel like a big shock to me when I first read it (9 years ago) but it was a very tragic culmination of Catelyn's already very tragic story. (Actually the Oberyn vs Gregor fight was a much bigger shock; so was Arya "dying" until we see that she wasn't actually dead in her next chapter and Sandor just hit her with the flat of her axe... I admit I cheated and flipped forward to see future chapters and see if she was alive, lol.) That's how I felt about the RW, and from that, it read as a sort of deep tragic sadness that you sort of felt coming anyway because Catelyn's chapters were already so tragic at that point. I thought that the addition, in the show, of the Talisa fetus-stabbing, as well as the whole building up Robb and Talisa's relationship, was just a cheap way to get shocks and gasps from the audience. I'm not a fan of hinging your storytelling on shocking twists, and I feel like that's what the show is doing, far more than the books. But then, I supposed I'm biased in my perspective of the show red wedding, because I read it first.

Â 
You know I think knowing the source material affects us all different. I have never minded, and actually quite enjoyed knowing the source material before watching it on film/tv. Maybe I feel protective of the show, because I watched season 1 before I ever knew about the books--finished books 1-5 before the start of season 2 lol. But knowing what's coming kind of hypes things up for me, because I know when something is about to get very, very good. Plus it's just nice to be watching characters interact on the screen and you know all their backstory and future the second you see them. I think it's actually quite awesome! Plus it's pretty cool to be the person that the unsullied can come to whenever they have questions.

BINGO! That's what I was trying to say. It's just a great mix of everything. Maybe the show is not the best at one single thing, but its epic size and scope more than make up for it to me.Â

Â 
You are very right re: shock value. The ONLY point that Talisa served was to make the unsullied shit their pants when watching the RW. That was her only narrative purpose in the show. Her love and pregnancy make Robb's future seemingly more secure. Â D&D fell in love with the audience reaction to Ned's beheading and decided that they needed to trump it big time with the Red Wedding. So they create the romance with Robb and Talisa, focusing much of Robb's screen time on that tripe, and then stab stab stab her in her pregnant belly. Because what's more shocking than a pregnant women getting brutally executed, right?
Â 
The Red Wedding in the books, on the other hand, was a bit of a slow boil, horror movie style. GRRM masterfully weaves these note of discord into the affair, and then when the treachery is revealed it turns into a brawl where the loyalty of Robb's men, the love they feel for him, is portrayed during a desperate struggle. You feel far more than shock and sadness in that scenes, you feel the growing sense of dread, the thin hope of survival, the loyalty and love, the sadness of each northerner falling and then the pain of "Jaime Lannister sends his regards". Followed, of course, by Cat's horrific fate. The first time i read the RW in like 1999 i threw my book across the room and refused to touch it for two days. Watching Dumb and Dumber's version just made me never want to watch the show again, but for far different reasons.

The book was definitely better, but I question whether a true adaptation would have worked. First, how ominous can you make the episode before you completely give it away that something bad is going to happen? For example, when I read the books I knew from the moment Greywind tried to attack the Frey that something very bad was going to happen. Also, you put it really beautifully about the struggle of Robb's men to protect their king, but would that work for the show? They never really made any of Robb's fellow Northmen prominent enough in the show for the audience to have any type of investment in them by the time the Red Wedding came. And I don't know if I can blame them, because there's only so much time you can spend on each character. It was easier to make Talisa the focus than a few commanders. I would have liked it the other way, but as I've said all day it was another change that didn't really bug me that much.Â

Â 
I agree with what's being said about shock value. Everything is amped up in the show for effect. I don't think what D&D have done is bad though. I may never have gravitated to the books if it weren't for their screen adaptation, so I have to be hugely thankful to them for that. I think if you can switch off your knowledge from the books, the show is very entertaining and engrossing. There was never any chance that the subtleties and scope of the books could translate completely effectively onto the screen because as mediums they are vastly different. I think they have made a fair few mistakes, but not enough to turn great source material into rubbish.

Nope. Read my post again.
Â 
I said that Vikings and Spartacus beats GoT in sheer escapism and pure entertainment value, while The Wire, Sopranos, and BB beat GoT in narrative, character development, dialogue, and plot development. I value the latter traits far more than the former, so clearly I put the latter shows in much higher regard than the former. However, if I were either mentally exhausted or completely wasted off my ass and wanted some quick show to let loose, I might pick the former shows just out of the fact that they're fun and entertaining, and aren't too thought provoking.

It just didn't make sense with how vicious Ygritte killed all those people and then gives a little "shhhh", sparing a woman and her child's life. Oh well. I've seen worse.

Â 
Yeah I didn't like how they made it so black and white by having that woman be so vile just so Ygritte killing her doesn't seem so bad. I don't have a problem with her finding a terrified Gilly with the child and sparing them. I feel like you can justify that as her experience with Jon rubbing off on her. I know there's no hint of that in the books but I think it's justifiable.

Â 
Fair enough.
Â 
And yeah, they had the woman belching, threatening Gilly and her baby and being a totally nasty whore of a woman which made her death a good thing. I still think the Thenns were badass enough without the scars, shaved heads, and all the other nuances that the show gave them. I thought they were supposed to be the "Wildling Lords" that were the closest the wildlings came to being like those from the south. You know....they make their own weapons, live in castles, and have titles (Magnar). Oh yeah, and now they're cannibals in the show. I realize this is probably because they are cutting Skagos from the show...but still. I'm not usually this picky but I don't like it. I'm pretty much good with everything, changes and all, except for what they did to the "North". The White Walkers....something isn't right about them, and the Thenns. In my eyes the White Walkers were more ethereal and majestic than the show makes them out to be, and the Thenns (or all the Wildlings) are much like regular men, just a little more wild and with a difference in culture. Everything is so different that it almost makes the land north of the Wall a completely different dimension than the one we find in the books.
Â 
In the end, great show. I enjoy it immensely. When it comes to the show I'm not usually a "super book loyalist", although I'll admit I put the books in a much higher regard than the show.
1813	The Killer Snark	2014-06-07	Bear with me, folks. I've been away for a week on holiday so today was the first chance I had to watch the ep. I've given it a 10. I thought that the Grey Worm/Missandei filler and the similarly divergent 'beetles' monologue by Tyrion could have been trimmed to bring the fight in sooner and allow for more of it, but though this wasn't quite the total thrill-fest last episode was, it was marvellous overall. And I'd assumed the series had hit the brakes totally a few weeks back. That being said, Oberyn's death for me was just as bad as in the books, i.e. not any fun whatever, and it's put me on a bit of a downer it'll take an episode or so of Penny Dreadful to take away. He will be missed. I thought Emilia was excellent in this episode, and don't quite get why she takes so much flak.
1814	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-07	Â 
And I can't take many of the 10/10 scorers seriously given that they openly admit the episode wasn't perfect but are giving that score anyway in an attempt to counter someone else's score.

Would it help if I told you I was joking when I made that comment?
1815	Lord Zachary	2014-06-07	I must say the duel was totally awesome, except of Oberyn shouting "Who gave you the order?" looking at Tywin.A good soundtrack could have made the scene more exciting,and Tyrion should have vomit his breakfast, as in the book. The ending of the scene would have been more disgusting. But overall I really enjoyed it.
1816	The Killer Snark	2014-06-07	Last week's episode was pretty much perfect. This week's was virtually perfect. That's good enough. Episode 6 I gave a 7 to, and 2 I gave an 8 to, so I don't dish full marks out every time.

But Titanic is the best movie ever made. Just kidding.Â 
Â 
My point is that, being that "D&D are such hacks," it's an accomplishment for the show to have risen to such high levels of viewership. Ya know...in spite of how awful they are.Â
1818	Ran	2014-06-07	Not really? I mean, Michael Bay has made two of the highest grossing films in history, and they're pretty shit. Adam Sandler regularly profits from high-budgeted, terrible comedies because there's an audience for the brand of crap he peddles.I don't think D&D are hacks. I do think the show's over-praised, critically and popularly, but that's the nature of popular things -- there's a certain common wisdom that will make it easy for people to elide flaws, to play problems down and focus on the positives. There's always positive aspects for the show, there's never been an episode that has been wall-to-wall shit; not even close.To some degree, I think people look for "enough entertainment". If they get that entertainment in a given hour, the thing's the greatest thing since sliced The Sopranos and they don't worry about the stuff that's more hit-and-miss. They forget about it. They shrug it off, and focus on the positives. And that makes sense, for a lot of people -- they want to feel generally entertained, and if something bores them or is meh, well, that doesn't detract (for them) for the material that does. It's just there, filling time between the good stuff.

1819	Count Balerion	2014-06-07	Episode 8: This was a fairly decent episode, but the quality varied significantly from one scene to another
(or sometimes even in the *same* scene).
I continue not to care all that much for the bits in the far north.Â  The Night's Watch was OK, Mole's Town
so so.Â  7
Grey Worm/Missandei romance?Â  Uh oh.Â  It seems they could come up with better stuff to spend time on,
and the dialogue isn't of the most brilliant.Â  The actors are good, though; and perhaps the scene was
intended to showcase their talents.Â  8
Theon/Ramsey and Vale both pretty good, 8-level stuff.Â  The series successfully shows that Ramsey is
evil in an understated, insouciant kind of way.Â  For the Vale, they seem to be changing a lot, and I'm not
always sure why (which applies to the show in general); but Sophie Turner's performance in particular
made it worth it (bringing it up perhaps to a 9).Â  Of the shorter scenes, I was least impressed with the
LF/Robin scene, but liked the rapport between Arya and the Hound.
The scene where Daenerys tries SJ was well done, anÂ  8.5 or possibly a 9.Â  Very good acting from Ian
Glenn, and SJ seems less a jerk than in the books.Â  But it would have helped if the part had been more
substantial this season.
Tyrion/Jaime was well acted, but I had to wonder why we were spending so much time on beetles.Â  The
show people do come up with odd dialogue at times.Â  Jaime really did have a point.Â  8
Combat scene: excellent work from Pascal.Â  9
Final score for this episode: 8
1820	Modesty Lannister	2014-06-08	9/10 and I was being overgenerous. I liked the Vale sequence, because I find it consistent with how I read Sansa's POV.
Moat Cailin was excellent.
Daenerys/Jorah betrayal was the best Dany sequence of the season, although far from excellent.
Grey Worm in love was interesting although I don't know the purpose of it.
Â 
Oberyn/The Mountain fight was well choreographed, but it lacked the crescendo feeling I got from the books, although Pedro Pascal did his best.
Tyrion beetle smashing monologue was a puzzle. I believe it was a foreshadowing, but I cannot see its value yet.

1821	The Killer Snark	2014-06-08	The Tyrion beetle smashing monologue was a bizarre one; I thought it was a timewaste. It was indeed meant as a foreshadowing, but I thought it was just a little heavy-handed and went on a bit too long.
1822	storm.131	2014-06-08	^^^ I totally agree: Â the beetle smashing monologue was way too drawn out.
Â 
Otherwise, an 8 out of 10 for the episode, for the same reasons others have already mentioned (the duel, Sansa's scene with the lords of the Vale, Reek/ Theon and Ramsay, Roose legitimising Ramsay).
Â 
One thing I would have liked though, was for the Hound to have joined in with Arya's laughter when they were told Lyssa was dead. Â It would have fit in with the development of their relationship.
1823	The Killer Snark	2014-06-08	I can't honestly remember. Did Sandor and Arya go to the Eyrie at any stage in the third book? I don't believe they did. That scene made little sense to me, because surely Sansa would have been notified her sister was at the gate, completely out of keeping with the narrative of ASOIAF.
1824	BearQueen87	2014-06-08	I can't honestly remember. Did Sandor and Arya go to the Eyrie at any stage in the third book? I don't believe they did. That scene made little sense to me, because surely Sansa would have been notified her sister was at the gate, completely out of keeping with the narrative of ASOIAF.


Â 
No, I don't believe they ever made it.
1825	boojam	2014-06-08	Round up of other ratings and reviews of S4E8.
Over at Rotten Tomatoes* read , if you have the time, to read the reviews and see if you would assign a 1 or 0 to the review:http://www.rottentom...hrones/s04/e08/
(I note that ,outside of fine episode essays , here on this very web site, I do like Myles McNutt's essays per episode of the show, http://cultural-lear...me-of-Thrones/ .
His critical analysis doesÂ  not occur in Rotten Tomatoes list, that I know of. If anyone knows of similar essays on the web I would like to know about the.)
Â 
Over at IMDb (wonder why there is a lower case 'b' there) I see this:
11479 IMDb users have given a weighted average vote of 9.7 / 10
Why I had not noticed 'weighted average' before I don't know. IMDb says:
"IMDb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages. Various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at 'vote stuffing' by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it.
The exact methods we use will not be disclosed. This should ensure that the policy remains effective. The result is a more accurate vote average"
Hmmm..... I guess so.
*I do know where the terminology 'Rotten Tomato' comes but it's odd someone must not have been thinking because people threw both Fresh and Rotten tomatoes at a bad oration or stage show ... but I think they are stuck with trade mark madness!!
It happens.

1826	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-08	No one is disputing that taken on its own, Game of Thrones is a "good" show. Some claim that anyone who criticizes the show is arguing that it's a bad show. This is a logical fallacy known as the "straw-man" argument: you create a caricature of your opponent's argument, refute the caricature, and then proclaim yourself victorious over your opponent, when in fact you've never actually engaged them. This is a popular tactic among politicians and other professional liars.
Â 
Sure, Game of Thrones is good, but that's not the point. What us critics are saying is that amateurish writing ("if I had only loved Jon Snow," CPR in Volantis, the beetle soliloquy, etc.) and bizarre plot tangents (Asha's pointless rescue, Bran's pointless capture, etc.) are holding it back. From a writing standpoint, Game of Thrones is below the standards of other great HBO originals. Now, its incredible source material and big budget have carried it through these deficiencies, but if D&D were adapting any other story (or, heaven forbid, creating their own story), I doubt it would survive a season. Honestly, HBO's contribution to Game of Thrones has been laughable, to say the least.
1827	Genre Monkey	2014-06-08	Episode 8 was a solid effort, with some thinning around the edges. I watched this episode with a group of six, equally divided between readers and unsullied, and we all seemed to enjoy it for what it was. My wife, who is unsullied, and myself both enjoyed Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s beetle speech way more than it appears the rest of the internet did. Aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manic laughter at the absurdity of their luck was great. Sansa testing the waters of her own power was intriguing. And even though Reek on the show isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t as physically altered (aside from the obvious lack of his favorite toy)Â  Alfie Allen portrays him with such inner turmoil it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter as much as I thought it might. The fight between The Red Viper and The Mountain captured the essence of the book duel. And Pedro Pascal nailed it, I mean that scream he let out was blood curling.
After reading these boards so often after each episode, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure if the group I watch it with is indicative of a normal Game of Thrones watching group. The unsullied in our group genuinely enjoy each episode, pretty much getting everything they need to, and the readers amongst us have come to the acceptance that the show is basically an alternate universe version of ASOIAF. I mean if youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re a reader, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nigh impossible to watch the show without any bias in favor the source material. So, we just think of it as different version of a great story. It will never be as great as the books, but the differences between the mediums are vast when telling such a sprawling story. And in reality the books are still there in all their glory.
Â 
Â 
To quote James M. Cain - â<U+0080><U+009C>People tell me, donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you care what theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve done to your book? I tell them, they havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t done anything to my book. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s right there on the shelf. They paid me and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the end of it.â<U+0080><U+009D>
1828	Joe Essosi	2014-06-08	Tyrion don't laugh, shittin'out another blasfemy/pray to the lord of Death: The Stranger...
Â 
And... why they still mess around with poor Aryia?!
1829	Diablotion	2014-06-08	Tyrion don't laugh, shittin'out another blasfemy/pray to the lord of Death: The Stranger...
Â 
And... why they still mess around with poor Aryia?!


Â 
True, I would have LOVED Tyrion's hysterical laugh and the "snakes don't have hands"-quote.
Â 
A great episode all around, highlight's of the episode were: Sansa's transformation to a player and of course the trial by combat. The Missandrei & Grey Worm thing was time wasting and useless, we could have got so much more instead of that scene!Â 

A solid 9
1830	boojam	2014-06-12	Nope. Read my post again.Â I said that Vikings and Spartacus beats GoT in sheer escapism and pure entertainment value, while The Wire, Sopranos, and BB beat GoT in narrative, character development, dialogue, and plot development. I value the latter traits far more than the former, so clearly I put the latter shows in much higher regard than the former. However, if I were either mentally exhausted or completely wasted off my ass and wanted some quick show to let loose, I might pick the former shows just out of the fact that they're fun and entertaining, and aren't too thought provoking.The Vikings is interesting but is thin on production value.Spartacus was a disaster, the first season's story was sort of interesting, the '300' moronic comic book splatter action ... well one time through on that junk idea was enough to hold one for a lifetime.The rest of the seasons and half season were endless loops of stage bound looping , waste of some good actors too.That was the most wimpy representation of ancient ROME, the city, I have ever seen.
1831	Nevada Milan	2014-06-16	10 just for the delicious shot of oberyns head being splatted....for some of the mistakes i personally feel D&D make with the changes i was so happy the fight and oberyns death was so close to the book....that being said the epicness of ep8 final scene may have ruined the last two eppisodes for me as i felt let down after both and the only reason i can think it the peak for me was ep8's final scene.
Â 
Sansa and Littlefingers creepy come to bed eyes.....no no no! That almost dropped it down to an 9 but her bad ass dress made up for it
1832	Alex7s	2014-06-19	What is up with that beetle story?! I was waiting and trying to figure out what the moral of the story is...None.
loved the fight scene great moves for the viper, but no mention of how he got this nickname or how he applied poison on his spear before that fight. I also loved that sansa scene where she explains to the vale lords how lysa fell.  Sansa joined the game baby!
Â 
I give this ep an 8
1833	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-06-21	Gave it an 8.
Like others have said, nothing really happens for most of the episode til the duel.
I liked the duel, it wasn't perfect but it sufficed plus that ending with Gregor crushing Oberyn's head was gold.
Some of the things I disliked were Arya laughing after hearing that her aunt had passed, I know it was mostly directed at Sandor but it did still look like they were trying too hard to make her badass.
The beetle crusher scene was tedious and could have been handled better IMO.
1834	the_realMG	2014-06-23	That was so beautifully choreographed. And I was in the edge of my seat.  But before I thought they couldn't top it, they surprised me the hound.  I kinda wished the ending of this episode went like this.. http://youtu.be/ESCl6JqYSmk
1835	Aegon XIV	2014-06-25	I gave it a 10.
1836	Baby White Walker	2014-06-30	I'll miss his lusty gaze.
1837	Aendros Wolf	2014-07-19	There are many good things in the book so putting in the beetles conversation is a bit of a let down for me. The whole fight was a let down too. Gregor Clegane supposed to be a beast in full armor,instead we get a baby faced guy who might be big but way too slow. They could have done a better job with a very tall agile guy, a basketball player for example, put him in full armor face covered and have a voice actor. Â I love the show but this is a strong 6 .
1838	Jack Bauer 24	2014-07-27	Amazing!
1839	Lithon	2014-11-09	I have always wondered what would happen if Sansa did not "save" Petyr with her "lie". What would Petyr do to get himself out of this problem? The nobles of the Vale will kill him or arrest him!
1840	Petyr Patter	2014-11-11	You sort of hit upon why I hate that scene.Â  It is presented as Sansa "playing the game."Â  Yet, simultaneously all she had to do was tell the truth and BOOM!Â  Dead Littlefinger.
1841	zaphodbrx	2014-11-12	Show Littlefinger is more into whores than being smart. Actually, he's almost a complete moron.
Â 
So I wouldn't really complain about the scene at this point. It's just a fanfiction anyway.
1842	Darkstar112	2014-11-12	Maybe shes unsure if they would believe her? Shes put her trust in people before and look what occurred, the old Sansa might have....
1843	JonBranRickon	2014-11-12	You sort of hit upon why I hate that scene.Â  It is presented as Sansa "playing the game."Â  Yet, simultaneously all she had to do was tell the truth and BOOM!Â  Dead Littlefinger.


Sansa is not sure whose side the Vale is on.Â  She is safer with LF until she figures it out.Â
1844	CaptainTheo	2014-11-12	I had an issue with this scene. Apart from Sansa suddenly being able to lie convincingly, it made Littlefinger look like a fool by making no plan to deal with the Lords Declarant. I thought it would have been far stronger had it been revealed in that subsequent Sansa/LF scene that Littlefinger had prepped Sansa to do that, which is what happens in the book - it would have been a nice reveal and made LF seem as smart as he should be. (In fact I assumed that Littlefinger had prepped Sansa until it was revealed otherwise.)
Â 
It also perhaps challenges the belief that Sansa will eventually be the ruin/death of LF as here she could have had him taken out, by telling the truth, but instead she got him off the hook.
1845	Colonel Green	2014-11-13	It also perhaps challenges the belief that Sansa will eventually be the ruin/death of LF as here she could have had him taken out, by telling the truth, but instead she got him off the hook.


She has no real reason to destroy him at the moment, since she doesn't know about his various moves against the Stark family (even less than in the book version).
Â 
As to the original question, if Sansa hadn't saved him, he would have been executed for murder.
1846	Annara Snow	2014-11-13	Â 
It also perhaps challenges the belief that Sansa will eventually be the ruin/death of LF as here she could have had him taken out, by telling the truth, but instead she got him off the hook.


Â 
She does the same in the books, doesn't she? She could have told the truth in the books, too, and that would be two witnesses against LF.
Â 
The reason she didn't is that she's scared and finds it safer to be with LF, who she knows won't turn her over to the Queen. I'm not sure that this is so different from what she does in the show, apart from show!LF being considerably stupider and more inept than his book counterpart.

Â 
What is so different in the show is Sansa reveals herself.Â  This means to a certain degree she has already put a lot of trust in the Lords of the Vale, because they now know a secret which can easily get her killed simply by informing the right people.Â  In contrast, in the book she decides it is safer to keep her identity secret.Â  She also is simply doing what Littlefinger tells her.Â  In the show, they make it explicit she left script and revealed her identity (which is dangerous) for the sole purpose of saving Littlefinger.Â  It is one thing to tell his lies, its another thing to make your own lies to save him.Â  Especially when she should realize he's a murderer who kills the people who work for him (Ser Dontos).

Â 
I don't think that "she trusts the lords/but she doesn't trust them" thing that the show has going makes a whole lot of sense, either - or if it does, the show didn't put an effort into explaining why (I could try to come up with explanations, perhaps, but I don't want to do their job for them). But my point is that I don't see how Sansa lying to save Littlefinger because she thinks she's safer with him around - the same thing she does in the book, albeit coached and under different circumstances - means she can't bring him down eventually, any more than it meant when you were reading the books.Â
1849	Dronuspk	2015-02-22	A lot of bookreaders had a major issue with LF's portrayal in this scene, and yes it made him look pretty weak.
Â 
I think he definitely had a way to get out of this situation, or he simply bet a lot on Sansa. Either way, I like show-Littlefinger. I was actually shocked to see how much hate he garnered online.
1850	King Tyrion I	2015-02-23	The show is the show.
Â 
I liked the scene. Because it showed that also LF can be weak.
Â 
And I'm a book reader, too.
1851	Steve Stark	2015-02-23	In the show Baelish says that "some men never take risks" to Sansa early on in the season when he helps her escape. I think he knew it was a risk to put his future in her hands, but I have full confidence that he probably had an escape plan. It would have most certainly set him back a few steps, but I'm sure he had a way to get out of there. Someone paid off to help him escape if it came to it (purely speculation, but he's not an idiot).Â 
Â 
When Sansa took his side his lust/love object took his side in his eyes and gave him something he had always desired. The thing is, I don't think him putting himself in a vulnerable situation was the reveal of his weakness, as I believe that was a part of his plan. His weakness is in fact Sansa herself. He never got what he wanted with Cat, and that's what made him so devious, ruthless, and successful. He hated everyone and all he had was ambition. Now all the power his ambition won him is Sansa's, and she's just learning how to manipulate. I'm not exactly a huge Sansa fan, but I think she's about to become very dangerous.Â

Â 
I am a Sansa fan.
Â 
I thank you for your pov. There's definitely something to it.
Â 
And... we miss you. In a certain thread. ;o)

Just when I thought I was out, he pulls me back in! Â :-D
Â 
She's not my fav character, for certain, but I do think she's got a big part to play and is a well developed character. Martin's got a lot of those, and I have a particular fondness for Starks...obviously. When is this "A Time for Wolves" going to happen, I ask you?! Isn't it their time yet, dang it?Â

The writers make it quite clear in the BTS pieces that nothing like that was happening. Â He had no plan.

Â 
Interesting.Â 
Â 
I'm at a loss then. But I'm not too worried about it, because I hate the guy. If he's an idiot, I'm only too glad to announce it. 
Â 
At the same time, show LF and book LF are two different people. Either way, I despise them both. Not even sure why I was defending him. Let's just say I was simply pushing out observations and suggestions. Truth be told, I want him, Cersei, and Frey to die more than anything. Bad deaths too, mind you. No easy way outs.

I don't think any of them will get 'bad deaths'.
1857	A Prince of Dorne	2015-03-06	The writers make it quite clear in the BTS pieces that nothing like that was happening. Â He had no plan.


Â 
Kind of like the writersÂ
1858	Beric175	2015-03-10	He had a plan. The only question was whether Sansa was going to go along with the prepared story or not, which is what he could have asked her about. We don't know, and inferring something from basically nothing is not good detective work.
1859	teemo	2014-06-02	Anyone else not feeling this storyline? Â I feel like they could have cut this and had maybe a non-brothel scene with Oberyn before his duel. Â I mean, he's an Unsullied for crying out loud. Why? Â Filler?
1860	Petyr Patter	2014-06-06	Not filler, drama.
Â 
Essentially, the "doomed couple," or at last the forbidden couple, is one of the oldest ways to create emotional tension in literature and stage.Â 
Â 
In Arabian Nights, he was burned by a past romance and vowed to never love again.Â  With Romeo and Juliet, its because they belong to two houses at war with each other.Â  In The Scarlet Letter, she is already married and he's a preacher.Â  Pride and Prejudice has a relationship form against class lines.Â 
Â 
Daytime soap operas LIVE off of love relationship that aren't allowed to form.Â  This is nothing new, except the barriers are physical instead of social or emotional.Â 
Â 
I think the show writers thought it a way to give two characters lines and an emotional empathy with the audience.Â  It doesn't work for me.Â
1861	Fool of a Book	2014-06-06	I hated it. Â Boring and out of character for both Missandei and Grey Worm. Â And for Dany, for that matter.
Â 
I suspect it was mostly included for a bit of romance as a counterpoint to the brutality and intensity, not only of the episode, but of the whole series in general.Â 
Â 
All I can think is that it might be part of an "even a eunuch needs a cuddle now and then" plotline in Meereen, which may be important to the future story somehow.
1862	MidnightKiss	2014-06-06	I think it's a replacement for the "eunuch cuddle" plotline as well but I also think it's a way of having a little bit more screen time for some black actors.
Â 
There aren't many black actors in the show simply because most of the story is based in a large "European" continent. I've seen video comments loving seeing Salladhor Saan briefly in this season because they're glad to see a black face in a cast that's predominately lighter. I'm personally happy that the book and show have a good mix of men and women in it so I can understand that some black people would like to see people of their color represented too.
Â 
It's hard to add in black people to the storyline because of where it's set so a small subplot of Missandei and Grey Worm seems a good opportunity to do this. Perhaps a scene...a silent and poignant one of them hugging tightly would be good?
1863	R'hllor the Fabulous	2014-06-06	I hate most show only things. But I don't mind this at all. I think the relationship between an eunuch and a woman is quite interesting.
Besides, Meereen scenes which don't involve Clarke are welcome.

1864	Daske	2014-06-06	I hated it. Â Boring and out of character for both Missandei and Grey Worm.


Â 
It's been building up in their previous scenes this season, so how is it out of character?
Â 
Really it's no different really to say the Sam-Gilly love arc (which I know some do find boring too, but aboutÂ similar relevance to the wider story).
Â 
Anyway, I like it, it's a interesting new PoV, and one of the criticisms of the books has always been that there weren't enough insights into the affairs of the lowborn caught up in the Game of Thrones - it's nice to see the perspective from the angle of the (ex-)slaves.

Â Meaning, Missandei is ten years old in the books, and Grey Worm is a eunuch trained to be ruthless and detached. Â Sam and Gilly actually do have a romantic arc in the books.
Â 
Your point is well-made, however. Â We'll see where the show takes it. Â Like I said, it may be to fulfill the "eunuchs need cuddling" arc without introducing a dozen other characters.
1866	Sand11751	2014-06-06	Meaning, Missandei is ten years old in the books, and Grey Worm is a eunuch trained to be ruthless and detached. Â 


Â 
The initial reason I hated it as well, but then I remembered I'm supposed to love the books and show separately. Unless the future of Meereen, the Unsullied soldiers or something as yet unrevealed hinges on the budding romance between Grey Work and Missendei, this is just boring tripe. I love the book and show versions of both characters, but wish D&D would have given more time to Oberyn's preparation for the duel.Â
1867	WesternOz	2014-06-06	My first thought was the "eunoch cuddle" storyline, but increasingly I think it was just a case of finding a replacement set of boobies now that Emilia Clarke has gone all mainstream and nudity shy.
1868	Hannis	2014-06-06	That, I think, is lame.

As for me its not great drama but I like wondering exactly what are they building to ?
1870	DaveyJoe	2014-06-06	Every moment Grey Worm has is amazing on the show.Â  I love how he's not upset about his mutilation because being Unsullied allows him to work for Dany.Â  The actor is killing it, just like his scene where he says Grey Worm is a lucky name because it's the name he had when Dany freed him.Â  It's a reminder of the good things Dany has done at a time when her character is starting to suffer.
1871	gotgrrrl	2014-06-06	I thought I would hate it when I heard about it on the boards but upon watching I didn't mind so much.Â  I like both book Grey Work and Book Missandei and would have preferred to keep them that way in the show but I thought the scene was very well acted.Â  Not sure of it's ultimate purpose -- to create another "ship" between two attractive actors?Â  to show that unsullied need love too?Â

Â 
I think it is more a matter of certain people, predominately men and including me, not liking "drama" romance plots in almost any media.
1873	Theda Baratheon	2014-06-06	I hate most show only things. But I don't mind this at all. I think the relationship between an eunuch and a woman is quite interesting.
Besides, Meereen scenes which don't involve Clarke are welcome.I really liked it, I found it was very touching.
I also think it might be instead of the "eunuch cuddle" but i don't want grey worm to die!!

Â 
Probably so. Â Another way of looking at it is that there are many sides to a human being, to show that slaves are human beings, and given enough time, even a eunuch can find true love if he found a woman willing to accept his limitations. Â Just something to add a little romance to a story arc that has so far been filled with war, battles, and blood. Â It softens the story arc just a little bit. Â
1875	Plume	2014-06-06	I thought it was very cute and touching. The actors are very talented too so it helped a lot, Nathalie Emmanuel's several shades of emotions showing on screen was very well done on her part.
Â 
And also, this is somehing that the audience needs: to be reminded that love still exists and eunuchs also feel it because they're simply human.
And Missandei was very mature, speaking her mind. They were so frank to each other which is another break from all those liars back at King's landing
1876	fangirl000	2014-06-06	I didn't like the relationship at first, just because it is such a big character deviation from the books. Â But it adds a bit of flesh to the Meereen storyline which is otherwise just going to be Dany failing at politics all next season. Â And I like the actors - I'm okay with them getting more screentime. Â Â
1877	7th-key	2014-06-06	That, I think, is lame.
Â 
Maybe they just want to put some love story to impress women viewers.

It's a generalization, that forgets that the mentioned majority of women who wants sappy love stories doesn't watch GoT in the first place.
It's quite insulting. After all the disproportional t&a and sexual violence, that the show pretends to throw a bone to the female audience, by inserting lame love stories that deteriorates the character and the plots. (i.e. Robb)
What impresses the women viewers of GoT is independent female characters that aren't just someone's love interest.
Strangely as soon as the show writers put Missandrei into a romance, she morphs from cultured translator into dumbed down girl (she should perfectly know all details about the unsullied).
Though my quirk with Mis/GW is Grey Worm's part: he is the leader of the unsullied, and, as defined by their training, he should be one of the most seasoned and focussed.

This storyline humanizes the unsullied for viewers. GRRM had them visit brothels just to cuddle. Certainly Missandei is a suitable alternative.

Â 
"I'm glad you saw me." -- Um, okay? Because you need to see my naked body in order for us to express any sort of affection.
"So am I" -- Huh? He was just apologizing. Now he's saying he's glad he did it anyway!
1889	Gendrys Forge	2014-06-07	Ive said it over and over.Â  Unsullied do not cry while talking about their life before unsullied.Â  Unsullied do not get distracted by emotions.Â  Unsullied do not fall into a dramatic lovestory with pretty girls.Â  They were raised to kill babies infront of the mothers and fed drugs for years to kill their pain receptors or something ffs, they are basically the closest thing to an actual machine in westeros.Â  The whole point of unsullied is they are just a block of soldiers that do nothing except what you tell them to, I always imagined Dany having to tell them 3 timesÂ aÂ day "you have to eat food now."Â  Or "Go relieve yourselves in the bushes",Â  "Its bedtime.Â  Unsullied must go to sleep for 8 hours."
Â 
All that being said, I do understand why they are doing this for television, and I can understand how it could work for some people.Â  I howeverÂ find this to be perhaps one of the top 5 worstÂ original tvÂ subplots yet.Â

I think you completely missed that in Mereen the Unsullied are become less robotic and more human. Â I doubt they are still taking what ever drugs they Â had and Â they are definitely softening if theyre going to brothels for hugs.
1891	QorihnHalfFoot	2014-06-07	As posted above, this storyline is just a sappy love plot they felt the obligation to through in. I think the show is setting up Grey Worm's death. When yunkai comes dany will give up hostages and those that aren't hizdar's family will most likely be filled with characters we know on the show. I don't remeber seeing groleo, and maybe heero will appear but since the show is deviating from the book they might add in some of the known characters for added suspense.
1892	Theda Baratheon	2014-06-07	The unsullied cuddling in the brothel always struck a cord with me, I found it profoundly moving. Sorry some of you would rather just see more blood and guts. Obviously, TV as a medium, is fundamentally different from novels. They need stuff happening in meereen other than dany and her thoughts.

1895	WexPyke	2014-06-07	My first thought was the "eunoch cuddle" storyline, but increasingly I think it was just a case of finding a replacement set of boobies now that Emilia Clarke has gone all mainstream and nudity shy.
This. Emelia Clarke best scenes have been nude and now she won't do them. Not smart.

Â 
its cheesy but Â its not nonsensical. Â Both Â Missandei and Â GW are really good looking people.
1898	VermithorSunni	2014-06-07	Not filler, drama.
Â 
Essentially, the "doomed couple," or at last the forbidden couple, is one of the oldest ways to create emotional tension in literature and stage.Â 
Â 
In Arabian Nights, he was burned by a past romance and vowed to never love again.Â  With Romeo and Juliet, its because they belong to two houses at war with each other.Â  In The Scarlet Letter, she is already married and he's a preacher.Â  Pride and Prejudice has a relationship form against class lines.Â 
Â 
Daytime soap operas LIVE off of love relationship that aren't allowed to form.Â  This is nothing new, except the barriers are physical instead of social or emotional.Â 
Â 
I think the show writers thought it a way to give two characters lines and an emotional empathy with the audience.Â  It doesn't work for me.Â 


Â 
Â 


Every moment Grey Worm has is amazing on the show.Â  I love how he's not upset about his mutilation because being Unsullied allows him to work for Dany.Â  The actor is killing it, just like his scene where he says Grey Worm is a lucky name because it's the name he had when Dany freed him.Â  It's a reminder of the good things Dany has done at a time when her character is starting to suffer.


Â 
For me, IT'S WORKING.
I think it shows the real effect of Dany as Breaker of Chains. Â These people who were formerly enslaved have fuller lives because of her actions. Â She's not just hanging out in Essos waiting for her dragons to grow up.
Â 
Plus, both the actors are totally hot and have super chemistry. Â I almost thought D&D had been reading the boards and decided to give the people who find Dany tedious something to focus on. Â For me, again. Â It's really working. Â I LOVE the scenes between Missandei and Grey Worm.

The book needed stuff happening too. Pity GRRM never thought of something like this.
1901	WexPyke	2014-06-08	I am not so sure the unsullied aren't changing under Dany. They also seem more like normal soldiers in the books.

1902	Aryakills	2014-06-08	I have no problem with it.
Â 
It's two former slaves learning to be human again. Who cares that he's been "cut" and to what degree that may or may not entail. He would simply derive his pleasure from pleasing her. Ever heard the phrase "there's more than one way to skin a cat."? Well, there's more than one way to please a woman.
1903	King Blackbeard	2014-06-08	I disliked this story arc the second it showed up back at the beginning of the season.Â  Also Summer Islanders have been shown to be black, Grey Worm is not black, him being a Summer Islander doesn't work for me.
1904	Addam of Hull	2014-06-08	Certainly not the storyline of the season, but I find the Grey Worm/Missandei angle about a thousand times more watchable than Robb/Talisa, so... it's watchable and I do like the humanizing element for the Unsullied and former slaves.
1905	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-06-08	Â 
Anyway, I like it, it's a interesting new PoV, and one of the criticisms of the books has always been that there weren't enough insights into the affairs of the lowborn caught up in the Game of Thrones - it's nice to see the perspective from the angle of the (ex-)slaves.


Â 
This. Besides, they may play a bigger part in the future -that we don't know of- and this could be a way to keep them visible besides being yesmen to Daenerys.
1906	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	It's ok if some don't like it but is still a good story. And it's 100000 times better than Pod being a sexual tyrannosaur.
1907	Khal Porno	2014-06-08	I thought this was a great addition, and so heartbreaking.Â  Losing your genitals won't eradicate sexual and romantic urges (much of that comes from your brain), so of course they can fall in love and have urges they can never act on.Â  The two actors are also quite good together.
1908	Wussel	2014-06-08	Can't wait to see them produce GreyWorm and Misandei pornographic bed scene. Anybody else missing Irri and Dorea? It is known.

1915	Noneofyourbusiness	2014-06-22	Back in Season 3, I expected Grey Worm to be Missandei's brother, since in the books she had brothers who were Unsullied and they've merged characters to simplify things before.
1916	Primalsplit	2014-08-13	In the book, it was mentioned that some eunuch were going to the brothel to hug a woman for some time. It was explained, even though one lacks the "masculine" organs doesn't mean one also lacks a man's heart. It was a different way of presenting it in the show. Why in the seven hells this bothered you?
1917	IRON BANK	2014-08-14	I for one enjoyed it.Â  I cant stand the stupid brothel scenes and brutality thats included within a story where most actions are quick and sidestepped.Â  We have hundreds of pages packed with emotional content and storyline.Â  I wish the series had more intrigue. instead we get another skin show, r8PE OR, senseless act of violence.Â  I will take the grey worm Messandi story lineÂ over this other garbage any day.

1918	Rupelone	2014-09-17	I think this show has enough nude and sex scene, they did not need to use this "slave romance" trick just to add more sex, this idea adds nothing to the plot or the lore.,imho.
1919	ummester	2014-09-22	I don't mind the idea of the story, but I didn't like the scene with Dany (shouldn't Missandei know whether they remove "the pillar and the stones"?), and I didn't like the last two lines between Missandei and Grey Worm:
Â 
"I'm glad you saw me." -- Um, okay? Because you need to see my naked body in order for us to express any sort of affection.
"So am I" -- Huh? He was just apologizing. Now he's saying he's glad he did it anyway!


Â 
he was apologizing out of guilt for looking, because he liked her (really, what is not to like, she is quite gorgeous  ) but then when she was glad, it removed his guilt and let him express himself more honestly.
Â 
I did find the scene a little corny and forced - doesn't mean it didn't have a logic to the character dialogue.
Â 
Books and film/TV are different mediums. The eunuch cuddle would not have worked as well on TV. For a while, I struggled with whether I thought the book or film of Jurassic Park was better - until I realised that they were both great for what they were. There is no reason it can't be the same with GoTs the show and ASoIaF the books.

1920	CaptainTheo	2014-09-22	I was really disappointed that they added this storyline at the expense of better material from the book, as it feels cliche and I felt it to be totally bland and boring.
1921	Beric175	2014-09-30	I think if Grey Worm dies next season it'll have some gravitas to it because he will have been fleshed out somewhat and Missandei will have to emotionally deal with his death. This could be very interesting and at least it gives us their perspective on certain thingsÂ and I support the only non-sexual relationship on the show because not everything has to come down to sex.
1922	Noneofyourbusiness	2015-03-07	I was surprised by this plotline because in the books Missandei had three brothers who became Unsullied, so I expected the show to simplify things by making Grey Worm her brother.
Â

1923	H.P.	2015-01-06	â<U+0080>¦ your emotional trama caused by Oberyn's death? I remember becoming positively depressed when I first saw that scene. And now, coming to think of it several months later, I still find it hard to think about. My brain doesn't want to accept it. Oberyn wasn't even a favourite character of mine, but I so badly wanted him to win that fight, especially after dominating it so hard in its beginning.Â 
Â 
I think I'm in need of some online counseling here.
1924	King Tyrion I	2015-01-13	Oh, I didn't get a trauma, tbh.
Â 
It was shocking, yes. But it's fiction after all.
1925	DeathYon	2015-01-15	I felt sick for half an hour or so.
1926	Maelys I Blackfyre	2015-01-15	As I was watching the battle, I completely forgot that Oberyn had to die. Every weak leading up to it I was thinking about how it would happen, but when the moment came I was fully hoping Oberyn would win. It was a very satisfying death, to say the least. And a little bit sad too. But that's how you know it was good.
1927	Lars Penry	2015-01-16	I was disturbed for days, no other death has been anywhere near that visceral.
1928	rocksniffer	2015-01-18	i disagree...the first death Â - that of Ned - was the most shocking for me. after that i realized the show would not let actor name recognition stop them from dealing out deathÂ
1929	Lady Meliora	2015-01-19	I knew it was coming, so I didn't have as bad a reaction, but it wasn't a great moment.
1930	rocksniffer	2015-01-20	well i knew it had happened in the book, but there had been enough differences by then and that sean bean was the only well known star lulled me into thinking they (DB and DW) were going to somehow save him...but alas it was not meant to be
1931	Amoracchius	2015-02-03	After reading the scene, I threw my book across the room. After watching it, I poured a stiff drink.
1932	KupoTheBusinessman	2015-02-03	Oh god. His death freaked me the hell out. He was such a cool character and thenÂ *boom*.Â I still can't get over it.
1933	The L.E.D.	2015-02-04	the first death Â - that of Ned - was the most shocking for me. after that i realized the show would not let actor name recognition stop them from dealing out deathÂ 


Â 
I agree with your sentiments here. Ned's fate came as an utter, complete how-is-this-possibly-happening kind of shock â<U+0080><U+0094> I think I was readingÂ A Game of ThronesÂ at the time, and probably hadn't reached the part yet when I saw the episode. "You realize you areÂ going to die," or something along those lines was what Varys said to him visiting the dungeon. I sure didn't until the very moment, or even beyond that. He was the epitome of "fair", and his death drove home the point that "fair" isn't going to cut it.
Â 
But Oberyn was such a marvelous character it was an utter shock to see him go.Â AndÂ he was a man on a mission, which kind of made it easy to root for him, avenging a great injustice.Â AndÂ both the book and show lead the reader/viewer to believe this underdog is actually winning it â<U+0080><U+0093> that actually he isn't the underdog at all. It's a wonderful scene, and especially Martin's writing of it made a huge impression.
Â 
I think with Oberyn he was able to make it even worse not only because he's such a great character but because there seemed to be so much unleashed potential in him. A bit like having Tyrion fall from the Wall and die while taking a leak.
Â 
But as for your original question, I'm not quite sure this is what I'd call coping with it. Â
1934	Lord of the Dreadfort	2015-02-05	I felt sad for one week and i knew he was going to die.

1938	Beric175	2015-02-18	After binge watching season 4 on DVD I dreaded getting to this scene again and sure enough I felt quite sad when I had to say goodbye to Pedro Pascal again because it definitely makes a difference when you are watching it in one go, you get more attached to the character and everything he did and said is super fresh in your mind and to see it ending like that is quite heartbreaking.

Thanks for the quote! I never considered that! So hard not to spoil so forgive me if I do.
Â 
Â 
Speculating on what will probably take to make him 'stronger' I assume that it would now take a certain weapon to destroy him which would result in that quote coming to pass? wow! Â I can't help but to think of Bran's vision of the 3 shadows - the one 'armored in stone' looming over the other two. I wonder if one or both of them will do it.
1944	FreeParking	2015-02-14	Please take book discussion out of this thread.
1945	DireNorthWolf	2014-10-01	The most unbelievable part of this whole episode is that the Hound announced he had Arya Stark there and no word was sent to the Vale. 
This is a key piece of information that she is still alive. Why was it placed there when the books are clearly bent on her being dead?
1946	Ran	2014-05-25	Given that this episode will feature the single combat between Oberyn and Gregor, I wonder how people hope it will come out? Benioff and Weiss state in an EW interview that it's the best fight scene on the show so far, and we've caught glimpses here and there of it so far.
Â 
Anything people are hoping to see in particular? What's been your favorite single combat in the series to date? How about the best duel between two combatants you've ever seen in film or television -- are you hoping the show's combat between the Red Viper and the Mountain that Rides will be up there?
Â 
Â
1947	Konradsmith	2014-05-25	Great of you to chime in, Ran, with the trial by combat just a week away!
Â 
We've seen Oberyn's spear-moves which Pedro Pascal trained with a wushu master to get right. We've seen Gregor holding a massive sword in one hand. We've seen Oberyn and Ellaria have an epic-looking final kiss. Given how much they've built it up with that great Oberyn-Tyrion scene in "Mockingbird" I think they're pretty confidant that it will be good. Alex Graves directed the Hound-Beric duel after all, which was one of the show's best one-on-one fights, particularly because of how they used the small space it was set in to raise the stakes.
Â 
IÂ wonder though ifÂ Oberyn might not get his face punched in because A) Gregor looks to only have leather gloves on rather than mail gauntlets like his brother and B )Â Oberyn related to us that Gregor cut Elia in half instead of bashing in her brains. Maybe that's what will happen to him too.

1948	sati	2014-05-25	My favorite TV fight scene is still Thirteenth! scene in Rome, but in GoT I really liked Hound and Beric. I think this one will top Hound/Beric, maybe even Rome scene, but that would be difficult.
Â 
I hope Oberyn's demise is left the same as in the books. The horrific way in which it happens adds so much to the shock and we saw Mountain cut down some random people already - killing Oberyn with a sword would be dissapointing, and it also has the potential of looking ridiculous if he cuts him in half. So they may as well just attempt to recreate book events, it may be hard to pull it off but not impossible.
Â 
I do hope at least some of Oberyn's lines were kept mainly the chase you through all seven hells line and Say her name!

1949	King Tommen	2014-05-25	They've been very strategic in only showing Oberyn in motion in all the clips they've provided so far. The Mountain has more or less been stationary and we haven't even got a shot of him swinging his sword.
Â 
Clearly, Oberyn is going to be the one doing most of the movement during the duel as that's his fighting style but it's going to be interesting to see how much they showcase the Mountain. An interview recently stated that one of the reasons they got Thor to take on the Mountain 3.0 role is because he had a basketball background which meant he moved very well for a man his size.
Â 
The clips haven't indicated this but for the most part, the clips appear to be only from the very beginning of the duel with Oberyn demonstrating his agility.
Â 
We also don't know how much there will be in the way of verbal taunting that takes place during the duel. I imagine they'll have Oberyn keep his lines from the book (although they may not be word for word). Will the Mountain have any lines and will they be dubbed?
1950	Konradsmith	2014-05-25	^I hope they cut "you're making my head hurt". That would sound kindof goofy, especially in that artificially deepened Gregor voice. (I do think Roy Dotrice sold the line pretty good in the book on tape though. He did a great Mountain voice).
Â 
One point of interest in the duel is that Gregor appears to start off with a helmet on according to some shots we've seen and then later doesn't have it. I guess Oberyn knocks it off, or he throws it off... I'm not sure. I wonder if that red helmet we saw in the costumes featurette is Oberyn's though and he similarly discards it.

1951	sati	2014-05-25	I was watching the promo and it looks like Jaime is one of the spectators in the tent, I can imagine him and Tyrion will exchange many reassuring looks during the scene.
1952	Hath4	2014-05-25	the mountain needs to give his confession, so he will half to say that small monologue.
1953	tyrell19	2014-05-25	One of the few occasions where I hope the violence is slightly toned down. I don't mind a brutal death for Oberyn but I really hope no eye gouging.
1954	King of the Road	2014-05-25	Oberyn will probably end up getting cut in half like Elia allegedly was. That should be pretty funny given the number of people who've compared his fighting style with Darth Maul!
Â 
Hoping Oberyn starts out flamboyant, putting on a show for the crowd, and we gradually see him get increasingly angered at Gregor. If they reflect that in fighting style, as well as dialogue, it would really add to the scene.
1955	King Tommen	2014-05-25	For some reason, I really want them to keep the part with Tyrion throwing up after Oberyn dies. It's the ultimate "Now I'm fucked" capper. They probably won't keep it in but I hope they do.
1956	Hath4	2014-05-25	i think that allegation is wrong, the mountain will set the record straight with how he actually killed her and then provide the example.
1957	Konradsmith	2014-05-25	^I hope so.
Â 
Yeah, Sati, Jaime is sitting in the same place with other royal spectators. Interestingly Mace Tyrell is sitting between him and Tywin.

1959	BrightStar Of The Day	2014-05-25	As long as the fight is good, which I'm sure it will be, all that really matters to me is Oberyn saying " you raped her, you killed her, you murdered her children" over and over again, and yelling EEELLLIAAAAA when he stabs the Mountain. They HAVE to include that or I'm sure a lot of book readers ( if not all of them) are going to be pretty pissed.

Â 
Â 


Â 
1) How it will come out: I expect the end result to be the same (Oberyn dies immediately, Gregor gets poisoned and dies later), but the details will probably vary (I don't expect Oberyn's dialogue to be exactly the same as it is in the books).
Â 
2) What I hope to see in particular: lots of reactions from the non-combatants (Cersei, Tyrion, Jaime and Ellaria in particular) and Oberyn in full-on rage mode.
Â 
3) favourite combat in series so far: the duel between Ned and Jaime (and their retainers) in season 1 tied with the duel between Jaime and Brienne in season 3.
Â 
4) best duel I've ever seen in film or TV: Leeloo vs. goons set to Plava Laguna's aria in The Fifth Element.
Â 
5) I expect Oberyn's duel with the mountain to become my no. 3 favourite duel in GoT.
1961	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-25	If they cut "You raped her, you killed her, you murdered her children" I'll go and kill the Mountain myself.Also, I would looooove to see something like"You know who am ?""Some dead man""I'm oberyn Martell, You killed my sister. You're going to die"
1962	boojam	2014-05-25	I don't know, Alex Graves directs this episode.... he's a good director...have to wait and see.The best fight so far was the 'chicken' tavern fight in episode 1, it surprised meâ<U+0080>¦ since David Benioff and D. B. Weiss directed it. The elaboration and the cutting of the sequence would have made Sam Peckinpah proud!The tiny clip of it looked a bit Chop-Socky , but it was not enough to make a judgment on.

1964	Conchobar	2014-05-25	I hope they do not hold back on Oberyn's death, would be nice to see the stable boy get hit by Gregor as well, just to show how much of a mad bastard he is before he gets sent on his way by Oberyn.

I don't think Oberyn will be cut in half, I think we'll get an eye gouging like this:

1967	binga	2014-05-25	This is one of the most emotional scenes for me, IÂ am going to be shedding some masculine man tears.Â I hope it is emotional for the generalÂ audience as well.
1968	mindingthesnow	2014-05-25	Lena is just awesome when it comes to spoilers! (this and the stoneheart in her garden) I just hope they don't include too many eye-contacts between Tyrion and Cersei/Tywin/Jamie/Bronn/Varys/..., it would just be too much. A goodbye moment between Oberyna and Ellaria as he realises his fate would be nice. Also, I hope they dub my countryman if he (hopefully) gets some lines, -that "Who am I fighting" was quite horrible...

1969	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-25	this is a scene that i really hope stays pretty close to the books. i'm usually not that guy, but it was just so fantastically written. i want the say her name stuff, which i think will be in given oberyn's constant talking about her.
i reeeaaallly want the end to happen just how it did in the book though. i need to see the mountain on his back "oberyn had wings" and the final wrestling match before his head gets bashed in. that will make for some amazing television.

1971	Talbot	2014-05-25	Gut feeling is that the Mountain snaps Oberyn's neck, but hopefully they keep it as gruesome as it was in the books!
1972	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-25	Anything people are hoping to see in particular? Oberyn being an intelligent fighter. Gregor being fearsome. Oberyn's constant chant. Gregor's confession. The more faithful to the novel, the better in this particular sequence. At the very least, it looks to be beautifully-shot. What's been your favorite single combat in the series to date? Easily the Hound vs. Beric, which was also directed by Alex Graves and gives me some hope that he'll do this fight right. The duel is my favorite action sequence in all the books and I hope I feel similarly when I see it on screen.


Â 
As for the Unsullied? I expect a Red Wedding-esque reaction. Anything short will be disappointing.

1979	Konradsmith	2014-05-25	^The National did a concert in Belfast during filming, so there's a slim chance that the singer sang over one of Ramin's backing tracks to make the Dornishman's wife.

Anyways that guy's voice would better suit the Last of the Giants, which it also looks like we won't get.

It kinda looks to me like they are limiting the songs to one per season and we already had Sigur Ros this year. But the National singing again for the show would be really great.
1981	Konradsmith	2014-05-25	^Which is a shame because so far Westeros has only two songs. And both of those songs would really help to addÂ richnessÂ to the Dornish and Wildling cultures.
Â 
If what we've heard of theÂ acoustic guitar in theÂ Dornish theme and the percussion that played when the Mountain was taking down those randoms is enough of an indication though, the duel and end credits will be well-scored anyways. Ramin does a great job. The recorded songs from the booksÂ are just bonuses really.

1991	Konradsmith	2014-05-25	^Well it is based on wushu, which I assume means that there's some practical basis for him to be dancing around like that. He's tiring the Mountain and showing off simultaneously, that seems to be in character at least.

1994	kephv	2014-05-25	I'll be very disappointed if they leave out Oberyn's chant concerning Elia and her children. Even so, I don't have much hope that they'll manage to do the scene justice, as their fight scenes in the show have been very underwhelming so far (though I did like Ned and Jaime's).
1995	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-25	Just found this thread and really don't have time to do the whole thing, I just did want to say that I hope they keep the line about all Oberyn's noise making The Mountain's Head hurt.Â  Since we do learn that he was a migraine sufferer and hence, has too high a tolerance to the poppy juice thanks to that, I think the line would make sense.Â  Besides, then I might be guaranteed some of that after action suffering on his part, LOLÂ  Plus, as a migraine sufferer (my daughter has one right now, poor thing), I did totally understand that line.Â  Well, I understood it once I learned the migraine part of the tale.
Â 
On a quick side note;Â  rewatching the coming attraction clip, I did notice that Mountain 3.0 gave a pretty good rage scream, I was encouraged when I noticed that.Â  Mountain 1.0 had the boiling rage thing down well, and the clip made me see, or hear, the new guy in a better light.Â  The idea he has basketball skills sounds hopeful, too.Â

Â 
The person ends up getting chopped in half. But I hope they include these two key points, feel like it adds an extra kick to the already iconic fight.Â 
Â 
Just re-read the chapter and I hope they include the talk before the fight between Oberyn and Tyrion about their mothers. Also really looking forward to how they show the ending of it and how they will make it happen. They have to include the whole "raped her, murdered her, killed her children" "No I did this_______"Â

Â 
I actually think we might learn of The Dornishman's Wife during this episode, so maybe hear it for the first time as, for example, Oberyn/Ellaria has it played for Tyrion and explains the story of the song or something.
Considering what is to come, The Dornishman's Wife has to become the new Rains of Castamere for the viewers. I also think it is a bit of a cop out to have two versions of Rains as their 'band songs' for two seasons. So there may come a slow and melancholic version of the Wife that is used at the end of the next episode.
Â 
I know, wishful thinking and all, but let's hope they show the increased budget over the years in more than just visuals!
Â 
Now.. when it comes to fights and the OP:
I am hoping this will be the best fight in the series so far, it surely has the potential to and it also is in the books.. When it comes to personal favorites so far;Â 
In the show I really liked Jon vs the Halfhand. It did not disappoint me as it did seem like a real fight, even if every viewer already knew it was a mock fight. My favorite aspect is the small moment of hesitation in Jon after he disarmed him, it was very subtle but I loved that little detail.
2001	Serr Parker	2014-05-26	One of my problems with the duel is I don't think TV watchers know just how great of a warrior Oberyn is, he's had his opening scene where he stabed the Lanister in the wrist, but that's about it. Would have been good to have some stories told about how he actually got the name Red Viper, and other fights he has had.
Â 
Another is how it's going to end, I think the TV watchers like Oberyn too much for him to just lose fairly, perhaps sacrifice himself somehow or lose to dirty tricks but just not fairly.Â 
Â 
I gathered from the book Â (It's been a couple of years since I've read it mind) that after catching the mountain a few times Oberyn could have ended it at any time he wanted, but he wanted to draw out the confession, as long as they keep something like this in Â I'll be happy

I really hope you're right. One of my biggest gripes has been the fact that they've only included two songs (unless you found the Hymn of the Mother for that hot minute). I'm assuming we won't get Last of the Giants, but I have been excited for Dornishman's Wife all season. If the duel credits end with Rains, I'm going to throw things.
2003	sati	2014-05-26	One of my problems with the duel is I don't think TV watchers know just how great of a warrior Oberyn is, he's had his opening scene where he stabed the Lanister in the wrist, but that's about it. Would have been good to have some stories told about how he actually got the name Red Viper, and other fights he has had.


Normally I'd agree but most non book readers seem to think that Oberyn will win. I think there's more to right/wrong thing here. They just can't imagine something like RW happening again where good people are slaughtered. Especially that Gregor was just set up last ep, really, and Oberyn was hyped so much in promos. They don't think it's possible they'll lose him next ep. Oh my this is gonna be interesting to watch.
Â 
Tyrion did mention something about Oberyn beingÂ  a skilled warrior in premiere as well as Cersei when they spoke in the gardens. I'm sure we will get a reminded of his knowledge of poisons before the trial.

Â 
We really hear Rains far too often. I hope Ramin came up with a lot of new music for the last 3 eps.
2004	Frey Pies	2014-05-26	I'm sure they are going to make this scene amazing.Â 
Â 
So far, the huge scenes the show has had to tackle have been are:
Â 
- Red Wedding
- Ned's death
- Dracarys
- Wildfire explosion
- Joffrey's death
Â 
They have aced all of them. I have complete trust in the quality of the scene, especially after how seeing confident D&D are about it.Â

-Robb executing Karstark
-Bran getting tossed out the window
-Arrival of the Walkers/Wights at the Fist (even though we didn't get the subsequent battle)
-Wildling climb up the Wall
Â 
The only "big" scenes they haven't quite nailed (although I do like elements of them) are:
-House of the Undying (the imagery is masterful but they could have done even more if they weren't planning on including the book prophecies)
-Bear Pit (limited by the choice of working with a real bear)
-Jaime vs Brienne duel (good but could have been better)
-Ramsay's betrayal of Northmen and Theon/Ironborn and sacking of Winterfell (weakened severely by choice not to have Ramsay cast at that point in the story)
-Jon's fight with Halfhand (truncated and not set up adequately beforehand)
Â 
Regardless, it's a great batting average and as I said, even when they don't completely stick the landing, there are still things to admire about the scenes.
2006	Rhaquentis	2014-05-26	One small detail is that the new Mountain can't speak English very well and they might have to keep what he says to a minimum (not that he said much in the books  ). Also, I expect that most hardcore fans won't like it, cause they will get hyped and expect too much and will be disappointed anyway. It will definitely be a scene to remember though; here's hoping it will last more than 5 minutes at least

2007	~No One~	2014-05-26	I think there've been some great examples of masterful choreography so far in the show. Short as they were, Hound v Beric and Jon v Quorin spring to mind. Even that Jorah/Grey Worm/Daario fight was well choreographed. 
This, in addition to the fact that D&D both love Oberyn and know how much we all love Oberyn, make me confident that they will do the fight justice.
Based on promos, it's already much different than I envisioned years ago while reading ASOS. So if they change details here and there, I'll be neither surprised nor upset. But what I think they have to include is:
-you raped her, you killed her, you murdered her children (repeat)
-Mountain correcting the order or correcting how he killed Elia just before he shows Oberyn firsthand <- it's practically a written-for-tv-scene!
-Tyrion vomiting

Â 
I did like bear pit but mostly thanks to Locke's hilarious lines and Gwen/Nikolaj acting. It should have been longer. I do think they butchered Jon Arryn/Only Cat thing. Still good scenes but such a far, far cry from the greatness in the book.
2009	Arkash	2014-05-26	I did like bear pit but mostly thanks to Locke's hilarious lines
Â 

Â 
"The fuck ya doing te my bear ?"Â ... Sorry, had to.
Â 
Regarding the helmets, it seems unlikely to me that Oberyn will pull it off Gregor's head. I think the Mountain will take it off cause the Viper moves to quickly and he has to keep him in sight.
2010	Frey Pies	2014-05-26	I quite liked the moon door- the reason it was so good in the books, at least for me, was because it was a moment we weren't expecting due to the ridiculous amount of turns that had taken place over the last few pages. Lysa being pushed out was therefore quite a big shock for me, and made it extremely memorably. Seen without that, I think the show version was extremely well done.Â 
Â 
The one big scene I didn't particularly like was the fight between Jon and Qhorin Halfhand. I thought it started quite abruptly, and the motivations were extremely unclear.

The fact that we lost their whole flight from the Wildlings was so depressing. Some of the best dialogue in the books! Such a shame. 
OT, I think the show's gotten more right than "wrong", so I think the fight will be good. Hoping for epic, but as long as we get some Oberyn/Mountain dialogue and Tyrion barf, I'll call it a win.

2013	maiden of tarth	2014-05-26	The problem will be that non readers don't know who Elia is. My husband has stopped watching the show as he's sick of me having to keep filling in the blanks for him so he can understand the characters.

I think she' been mentioned enough times. If there are some who don't pay attention, it's their problem.

Â 
Anyone who shows the minimum of focus while watching the show should be able to know who Elia is.

Â 
Exactly. I'm so sick of the show actually trying to cater to those people. They just assume the audience don't pay attention and that non book readers are dumb (this whole 'your sister' thing was borderline insulting).
2017	King Tommen	2014-05-26	I think the show has set up Elia just fine. Oberyn has mentioned her three times in explicit conversations this season (first meeting with Tyrion, w/Cersei and Tywin at PW, in Tyrion's cell in E7).
Â 
It's not like the books gave Elia any kind of significant backstory either.
Â 
I'd argue that we've got a better sense of what happened to Elia than what the Mountain's deal is.

2018	Arrowtic	2014-05-26	As I've said before , I really hope to see mountain die at the end , or at least drop down after rising up again . You know , he smashes Oberyn's head and then drops down again in severe agony , just screaming .(I fancy an ending with a mixture of Ellaria's crying and Mountain's agony)
It's confirmed that we'll get a pretty brutal death in this season(one of the staff had said it before , don't remember who . Actually he had said that it was so violent that they had to cut some of it off!) . Well , who else can have a worse death than our beloved prince ?
P.S : God , just imagining that moment . I'll break my record of not crying in years 
My only concern is the possibility of The Mountain not being able to deliver all those feelings(not that he has any!) he had in books during the duel .
2019	Ser Jimmy of House McNulty	2014-05-26	Some of my favorite quotes are from the trial by combat.
Â 
"You're going to fight that?" - Ellaria
Â 
"I'm going to kill that." - Oberyn
Â 
It looks like that will be in there from the promo.
Â 
I'm hoping they keep most of the dialogue from the fight, and especially the part where Oberyn tells Gregor he will chase him through all seven hells if he dies before saying Elia's name. That was so badass and I'm sure Pedro would do it justice.
2020	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-26	BTW all, Pedro Pascal has an AMA going on reddit for anyone interested. So far I've read a few duel-related answers, obviously without spoilers in them. Might be of interest to this thread.


Â 
OMG!!! Â A million thanks, I'm reading it now. Â
2021	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-26	My favourite detail from Pedro Pascal's AMA was that he based Oberyn's accent off of his own dad's. THAT is being a good son.


Â 
I liked that and YOU SIR, look like Oberyn Martell. Â I'm not done reading yet, but ITA, loved the dad thing and all the Chilean love, and NO SPOILERS, LOL
Â 
I still can't believe that he not only filmed the Tyrion cell scene on his first day, but the duel as well. Â That second one surprised me, I'd already heard the cell story. Â Love the admission of being clumsy sometimes. Â I'm still in awe how much this guy has made me love Oberyn even more. Â
2022	BlackTalon	2014-05-26	They have alreay messed up a part of the fight.
Â 
To me one of the most brutal parts is that, after Obery has shouted "You raped her, you murdered her. You killed her children" numerous times Gregor reveals that he killed the children first, possibly with Elia watching, and then raped her, with her children's blood still on his hands. That is a pretty horrifying thought.
Â 
In the shows Oberyn seems to already know that the children were killed first as he tells Tyrion that he killed Elia with their blood on his hands.
2023	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-05-26	I don't know why Oberyn told Tyrion that the Mountain cut Elia in half. That wasn't in the books and it's just stupid to be honest. I really doubt he brought his greatsword with him when he scaled Maegor's Tower just to kill a defenseless woman and her children. Even if he did, I wonder how that went...Â 
Â 
"Here, stand up, Princess. I just raped you and now I have to kill you. By chopping you in half. Step outside of the bedroom, over there in that open space so I can get a clear swing."
Â 
No, he was lying on top of her when he murdered her and when he was finished raping her, he just picked up his heavy mailed glove and dropped it down on her face. Because it was that easy for him. Gregor Clegane doesn't need a sword to completely obliterate someone. And the irony is that Gregor kills Oberyn the exact same way. He emasculates him by entering a missionary position and getting right in his face, "close enough to kiss." Then he delivers those disturbing last lines.
Â 

â<U+0080><U+009C>Elia of Dorne,â<U+0080><U+009D> they all heard Ser Gregor say, when they were close enough to kiss. His deep voice boomed within the helm. â<U+0080><U+009C>I killed her screaming whelp.â<U+0080><U+009D> He thrust his free hand into Oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes. â<U+0080><U+009C>Then I raped her.â<U+0080><U+009D> Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishmanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mouth, making splinters of his teeth. â<U+0080><U+009C>Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this.â<U+0080><U+009D> As he drew back his huge fist, the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening crunch.

Â 
It's a revelation. The ultimate final taunt. No one knew quite how gruesome Elia's death was but the Mountain bellows it loud enough for everyone to hear. Then he demonstrates the same savagery on Oberyn as testament. If they cut Oberyn in half, I will be upset. But the fact Lena Headey has her thumbs over Pedro Pascal's eyes in that photoshoot at least shows that the actors are somewhat aware of how he dies in the books. Which tells me that's probably how he will die in the series. Those photos were most likely taken after season four was already filmed. It won't be exactly like his death in the books and that's alright. I had a hard time imagining Gregor beating Oberyn's face in with one hand while the other hand's fingers were gouging out his eyes anyway.
Â 
These are the things I want:Â 
Gregor's last words to Oberyn - especially "LIKE THIS"
Oberyn dying the same way Elia died
The use ofÂ someÂ sort of special effects on Oberyn's head/face (it has to be absolutely brA1tal)
2024	SoManyVows	2014-05-26	Benioff and Weiss have stated that the duel is one of the best sequences that they have ever done, and I trust them completely. I absolutely believe that they will do it justice and it will quickly become one of the most iconic moments in the history of the series for book readers and Unsullied viewers alike.
Â 
That's not to say that the scene will be 100% faithful to the books. While Oberyn will obviously taunt the Mountain and demand that he say Elia's name, I expect that they will be cutting down the number of times that he actually says "You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children." I believe that he says it at least NINE times in the book, which is fine on the page but would be a little excessive on screen. Even before Oberyn volunteered to be Tyrion's champion, many, many people were already making Inigo Montoya comparisons and jokes. I expect that the producers are aware that if they go overboard with using that line, the scene runs the risk of turning into a parody. Benioff and Weiss aren't going to compromise the integrity of the scene, but fair or not, everyone recognizes that The Princess Bride basically has a cultural monopoly on revenge duels/repetitive monologues with "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." If I know the Internet at all, then within 24 hours there are already going to be 10,000 YouTube videos and gifs featuring Oberyn and the Mountain intercut with Inigo and Count Rugen. That's not a guess - that's an inevitability. The writers could be willing to steer into that skid, but I expect that they'll try to soften the comparison - at least somewhat.
Â 
I can already anticipate the purist outrage if this happens, but whatever. As long as he says it two or three times, I'm good.
Â 
Regardless, I think that the scene will make all but the most rabid book fans quite happy. Ellaria saying "You are going to fight that?" in the trailer basically confirms that we'll be getting at least a variation of Oberyn responding with "I am going to kill that.", which is a nice assurance. There are a few other touches that I hope make it into the show, one of which is the Mountain maiming and killing some unfortunate spectator who gets too close. However, the way that the arena is set up in the show - with the spectators on a elevated platform above the combatants- might preclude that. I'd also like Oberyn to yell "EEEEEEEELLLLLLIIIIIIIIAAAAA" when he deals the Mountain his mortal wound, Cersei to scream in anger when the Mountain falls, and for Oberyn to shoot Tywin and Cersei some taunting looks in the aftermath, while Tyrion quips "I'm feeling more innocent by the moment."
Â 
But the only line that I'm truly crossing my fingers for is the one that Oberyn delivers when he believes that he has the Mountain at his mercy. "If you die before you say her name, ser, I will hunt you through all seven hells". Chills, especially when we know what happens next.
Â 
The part of the duel that I have the clearest mental image of, however, is the end, which will double as the end of the episode. I've pretty much mapped out my ideal version of that scene, shot for shot, far too many times. 
Â 
Clegane brutally delivers the finishing blow to Oberyn - whether by smashing his head in, cutting him in half, or some combination of the two. Immediately following that scene we get two reaction shots in quick succession: Ellaria screams in despair and horror, and Tyrion falls to his knees and vomits. Then, interspersed with a few more shots of Oberyn's ruined body, we get a few stunned reaction shots from the people watching - among them Tywin, Cersei, and Jaime. Everyone is too stunned to speak. With the exception of Ellaria's heartbroken cries, the arena is completely and utterly silent.
Â 
Then Tyrion starts to laugh - softly at first, then louder and louder until he's basically cackling with hysteria. Those around him stare at him uneasily, convinced that he's lost his mind - which he basically has. His laughter mingles with Ellaria's sobs for several uncomfortable seconds before Tywin motions for the guards to take Tyrion away. Tyrion doesn't resist at all as he's half-marched, half-dragged out of the arena, still laughing uncontrollably. The camera lifts away from the scene into an aerial perspective, revealing the full extent of the carnage in the arena: Oberyn and Gregor Clegane lying next to one another in a slowly expanding pool of their shared blood. A tragedy and mockery of justice in one unforgettable image.
Â 
Ellaria's cries and Tyrion's despairing laughter continue to play over this shot until the screen cuts to black. The credits are accompanied by a suitably mournful song, or better yet, total silence.

I'd rather not have Tyrion laughing hysterically. That was a Catelyn thing and they completely messed that up. We see Tyrion laughing at his own misery often enough already. I want him to be completely broken at the end of this duel. Having him on his hands and knees vomiting up the breakfast he had with Oberyn is all that's really necessary. Maybe Bronn or Jaime can be standing next to him and offer some kind of small reaction. Tywin will remain indifferent because he knows this will have consequences in Dorne but Ellaria crying is a must. The way you put it reminded me of Cedric Diggory's death in Harry Potter and how his father sobs uncontrollably in front of the crowd. She needs to be the focus of the reactions.

Your ending to the episode is fantastic!


Â 
Thanks! It's one of those moments that I've played out in my mind so many times that it basically feels like I've seen the episode already (I did something very similar with the Red Wedding last year). But once we get the actual version of the scene, I expect that I'll be very happy with it, and it will quickly replace my own speculation in future reflections.
Â

Â 
Thank you! Good call with the Walt reference - I loved that scene in Breaking Bad as well.The Inigo Montoya comparisons are a reference to a 1987 fantasy adventure film called The Princess Bride (adapted from a 1973 novel of the same name) that's achieved cult status here in the U.S. A subplot the film involves a Spainard, Inigo Montoya, seeking vengeance against Count Rugen, a six-fingered man who killed his father. When Montoya finally confronts Rugen, he says his now-famous line: "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die". As they fight, he repeats that line over and over, at first irritating and then infuriating his adversary.
Â 
It's eerily similar to the duel between Oberyn and the Mountain in many respects. The key difference is that in The Princess Bride, it's the bad guy (Rugen) who deals the good guy (Inigo) a seemingly mortal wound before the good guy rallies and kills him. I have no way of knowing if G.R.R.M. took any inspiration from that particular scene when he was writing the fight between Oberyn and the Mountain, but regardless, he subverts the traditional fantasy-fulling ending of their confrontation in exactly the way that you might expect that he would. 
Â

Â 
I understand your concern. I agree with you that Tyrion's laughter would probably be the hardest part of that scene to pull off without going over the top and ultimately detracting from the moment. It's one of those details I love from the books that might not translate quite as effectively onto the screen. At the very least, it's something that would take a very skilled director and a very skilled actor to pull off successfully. Luckily, Game of Thrones has both of those with Alex Graves and Peter Dinklage. But if it's ultimately excised, I'll understand.

Â 
I agree that there'll be a lot of nitpicking from the book readers for this one, because surely D&D will leave out something that someone wanted to see on screen. Cant make everybody happy after all. As for the Mountain, they could just have someone else speak his lines in ADR (additional dialogue recording) and put that in. Thats how it usually goes - let the actor speak his lines, no matter how horrid his accent, so you have the lip flaps, then cut the dialogue and put ADRed lines by another actor on to match the lip flaps.
2030	King Tommen	2014-05-26	From some of the descriptions here, I have a feeling that there will be some people who are disappointed. You can't have the scene replicated so specifically. The show will do it's own thing and I don't think it's realistic for fans to say "they need to do THIS exactly the way they did it in the books or else the scene will be ruined". Â That's putting expectations at a level that just begs to not be met.
Â 
Enjoy it for what it is. I'm sure it will be great. If they don't have every single line or action from the books, it's not the end of the world.

Exactly, though I still hope they get the broad strokes across: that Oberyn is an intelligent fighter, tries to get a confession out of Gregor and pays the price for it.

Â 
I have no doubt that this will be the case.
2033	SoManyVows	2014-05-26	From some of the descriptions here, I have a feeling that there will be some people who are disappointed. You can't have the scene replicated so specifically. The show will do it's own thing and I don't think it's realistic for fans to say "they need to do THIS exactly the way they did it in the books or else the scene will be ruined". Â That's putting expectations at a level that just begs to not be met.
Â

Â 
Trust me, my own detailed and hopeful speculation about what the scene will look like is entirely a function of me being overly eager to see what the scene will actually look like on the show (and having two weeks to think about it with no new episode to distract me). I trust Benioff and Weiss completely at this point, and I'm certain that they will capture the spirit of the encounter masterfully. The details are fun to think about, but ultimately less important.

2034	Gerg Sknab	2014-05-26	Hey,Â  the TV show has twisted the plot enough around to the point where Oberyn could win....That is good Oberyn has a greater well of character development than Gregor will ever have...but I suppose I'm whistling against the wind here and for once the TV show will follow the plot of books...
Hey, again as far as fighting goes I would suggest pretty much any episode of Starz Spartacus outdoes anything so far that has been on GoT....

The show has always followed the plot of the books. I think that's undeniable. The journey between them may be different, but the major plot points have all been the same.

Huh? Edric? Davos? Jeyne Westerling? Gendry? Samwell? Talisa? Ros? and on and on....you are are close to right on the Easteros plotline however the North and Westeros have taken some queer turns...

At the risk of falling for a troll...
Â 
None of those alter the plot, lol. Gendry and Ros have nothing to do with the story. If Gendry does, I'm sure he'll turn back up. Davos, how? Samwell, how? Talisa/Jeyne, how? RW still happened. Whether she lives or dies doesn't affect the story.

Â 


In no way has the plot been twisted. There have been changes along the way but the story is largely the same.Â
2039	Gerg Sknab	2014-05-26	Where in the books do Stannis and Davos go to Braavos and the Iron Bank..nowhere ...the Iron comes to Stannis and negotiates "only" with Stannis nowhere is Davos involved...
Edric in the books is what Gendry is supposedly in the tv series...not just a stillborn sealed in a glass cylinder on Dragonstone
A much greater deal has been made of Samwell and Davos inÂ  the tv series than the books (even though they happen to be a POV's)
The Ironborn plotline makes absolutely no sense...and where does "Yara" come from?
Who the heck is Talisa Maegyr in the books...no one...and guess what Jeyne Westerling lives with the slight possibilty that she is carrying Robb Stark's child...
2040	Waxfoot	2014-05-26	The duel will be great... But surely Oberyn fans are hoping there is also a pre-duel meal scene with OM and a certain Lannister that might help prove a popular OM theory?

None of these changes the plot. They add to and change parts of theÂ story but the plot remains the same. There is absolutely no reason to assume that these changes would cause Oberyn surviving to make sense, as that not only changes the story but also changes the plot.
2042	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-26	Â 
I don't know why Oberyn told Tyrion that the Mountain cut Elia in half. That wasn't in the books and it's just stupid to be honest. I really doubt he brought his greatsword with him when he scaled Maegor's Tower just to kill a defenseless woman and her children. Even if he did, I wonder how that went...Â 
Â 
"Here, stand up, Princess. I just raped you and now I have to kill you. By chopping you in half. Step outside of the bedroom, over there in that open space so I can get a clear swing."
Â 
No, he was lying on top of her when he murdered her and when he was finished raping her, he just picked up his heavy mailed glove and dropped it down on her face. Because it was that easy for him. Gregor Clegane doesn't need a sword to completely obliterate someone. And the irony is that Gregor kills Oberyn the exact same way. He emasculates him by entering a missionary position and getting right in his face, "close enough to kiss." Then he delivers those disturbing last lines.
Â 
Â 
It's a revelation. The ultimate final taunt. No one knew quite how gruesome Elia's death was but the Mountain bellows it loud enough for everyone to hear. Then he demonstrates the same savagery on Oberyn as testament. If they cut Oberyn in half, I will be upset. But the fact Lena Headey has her thumbs over Pedro Pascal's eyes in that photoshoot at least shows that the actors are somewhat aware of how he dies in the books. Which tells me that's probably how he will die in the series. Those photos were most likely taken after season four was already filmed. It won't be exactly like his death in the books and that's alright. I had a hard time imagining Gregor beating Oberyn's face in with one hand while the other hand's fingers were gouging out his eyes anyway.
Â 
These are the things I want:Â 
Gregor's last words to Oberyn - especially "LIKE THIS"
Oberyn dying the same way Elia died
The use ofÂ someÂ sort of special effects on Oberyn's head/face (it has to be absolutely brA1tal)
Â 


Â 
Thorough and insightful post. That being said, prepare to be let down. My brother works in "the buziness" of post editing in La La land and the rumor that went around about 5 months ago was that originally the scene was filmed exactly as it is depicted in the books, but top brass felt it was way too over the top so they went and re-shot the ending. In episode 7 we see Mountain 3.0 Â hacking savagely at a guy on the ground. Expect the dialogue to stay the same, but also expect it to end with "and I cut her in half, like this." Oberyn will still be mounted and taunted, and have his eyes gouged out. The mountain will just get up after and cut him down the middle.

Â 
These are details. Â Not major plot changes.
Â 
The major plot point is that Stannis acquires a loan from the Iron Bank. The items you mention are details that do not alter that point.
Â 
The major plot points are that Mel performs blood magic with one of Robert's bastards, and Davos lets him go (and also demonstrates that Stannis is willing to sacrifice his own blood). Â Swapping Gendry for Edric is a detail that does not affect these points.
Â 
Jayne Westerling's survival (with potential Robb offspring) so far has made zero plot difference in the books. And the showrunners were in a position to ask GRRM "hey if we kill Robb's wife will that mess anything up?". Â So there is no evidence this is a massive plot change either.
Â 
Etc etc.
Â 
Oberyn dying however? That IS a major plot point, it affects a huge number of future events. Â There's no way they're going to change it so that he lives.

I wouldn't be shocked. Â Honestly while the show has some uncomfortably graphic scenes I don't find it anywhere on the level of a show like dexter. Â The ending of the duel the way it goes down in the book really could be too much.
2045	King Tommen	2014-05-26	I'm not sure I NEED to have the Mountain smashing Oberyn's face in while breaking his teeth and gouging out his eyes at the same time. I'm sure the death will be plenty gruesome on the show but it's not like the only way to honor the books is to show a man's face being squeezed and mashed to a pulp until his brain is destroyed.
2046	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-26	I've totally forgotten to mention this, but I hope one of MY FAV LINES EVER comes up, and that is Oberyn referring to Gregor as The Enormity That Rides.Â  I LMAO every single reread at that.Â  Small chance we get it but......a girl can hope.Â
2047	El Jefe	2014-05-26	I have high hopes for the fight. I'm fine with any changes they make, as long as they keep the idea of Oberyn snatching defeat from the jaws of victory due to his obsession.
I'm not sure how the his screem of 'Eeeeliaaaa' would work on the screen. It could come across as campy, and if so, I won't miss it if they cut it.
I hope that Oberyn's end is sufficiently grusome.
Â 
Favorite duel on the show: Bronn's duel at the Eerie.
Favority duel on tv/movie, discounting martial arts films, is Hector Vs. Achilles in Troy. In a way, it was a fight similar to O vs M. Hector was the larger oponent, and Achilles used a spear.
2048	Impish	2014-05-26	Favourite duel of the show so far: Beric and the Hound. Â I thought they captured a lot of details from the book, and loved the Hound's desperate "howl" at the end as he puts everything into the final blow, and Arya's rage.
Â 
Favourite duel of all time: Michelle Yeoh andÂ Ziyi Zhang at the end of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Â Emotional depth, an absolutely astonishing display of skill, and a wonderfully diverse array of fluidly shifting weapon choices.
2049	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-26	I wouldn't be shocked. Â Honestly while the show has some uncomfortably graphic scenes I don't find it anywhere on the level of a show like dexter. Â The ending of the duel the way it goes down in the book really could be too much.


Â 
Don't hate on my mancrush: Dexter Morgan. I honestly don't think they show anything that's extremely graphic, besides the excessive amount of blood at times. Most of the truly gruesome stuff is off camera IMO

I am sorry but Stannis-Davos/The Iron Bank episode is a major plot deviation...remember Jon Snow and the Night Watch negotiation with Tycho long preceed those of Stannis and there is no clue as to what assurances if any Jon Snow may have given in return for a positive outcome for Stannis...we do know one thing Jon Snow offered up to Tycho..whatever riches the Freefolk have...
The Edric/Gendry plot point goes much deeper than Mel's blood magic even though the blood magic does assist killing three kings...in the books both have a part to play in the plot line and yes I'll give you their part of the plot is murky at this point however there is still two books+ to go...
What changes with Oberyn winning? Tyrion can still be stuffed into a wine keg and uncememoniously presented to Illyio and further his journey....The clash of the Queens and the Faith?...the writers can still come with "Cersei's monster" if necessary...The delay of the Sand Snakes at court?....they can accompany Myrcella on her return to KL....
I'll stop now thanks for reading

2054	King Tommen	2014-05-26	The next time the show doesn't kill off a character when they're scheduled to die in the books will be the first time. If anything, they're more likely to have another minor character die as well who is still alive in the books.

2060	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-26	i think that allegation is wrong, the mountain will set the record straight with how he actually killed her and then provide the example.


This idea I like a lot actually.
2061	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-05-26	As long as the fight is good, which I'm sure it will be, all that really matters to me is Oberyn saying " you raped her, you killed her, you murdered her children" over and over again, and yelling EEELLLIAAAAA when he stabs the Mountain. They HAVE to include that or I'm sure a lot of book readers ( if not all of them) are going to be pretty pissed.

Â 
I've begun to see how much of UnOnlyCat has had an effect on the fandom.. All they have to do is show that Oberyn is trying to get a confession out of Gregor and getting into it vocally. Whatever his choice of words is perfectly fine, as long as we see the same extent of vocal madness.
Â 
But I'm betting that the people here are going to rage when he gets the order wrong.. "You raped her, you murdered her children, you killed her!" <- Fans react badly, start speaking in terms such as: "they can't possibly do any more harm then has already been done, they ruined it!"..
Â 
Cutting the "I smashed her fucking head in, like this" is a deal breaker as well? This fight can't go right.. There's just too many uptight fanbois. I can expect Elio to go: "I liked it, well.. I didn't like that they.. *describes everything about the fight"
Â 


Â 
1) How it will come out: I expect the end result to be the same (Oberyn dies immediately, Gregor gets poisoned and dies later), but the details will probably vary (I don't expect Oberyn's dialogue to be exactly the same as it is in the books).
Â 
2) What I hope to see in particular: lots of reactions from the non-combatants (Cersei, Tyrion, Jaime and Ellaria in particular) and Oberyn in full-on rage mode.
Â 
3) favourite combat in series so far: the duel between Ned and Jaime (and their retainers) in season 1 tied with the duel between Jaime and Brienne in season 3.
Â 
4) best duel I've ever seen in film or TV: Leeloo vs. goons set to Plava Laguna's aria in The Fifth Element.
Â 
5) I expect Oberyn's duel with the mountain to become my no. 3 favourite duel in GoT.


Â 
1. Fully agree.
2. What I hope: Include Tywin and perhaps Shae in that list and we agree. Also, Tyrion puking out of sheer terror of knowing his fate.
3. Favorite fight: Toss up between Ned vs. Jaime, Bronn vs. Vardis Egen and Beric vs. Sandor.
4. Best duel ever: Quigonn & Kenobi vs. D-Maul.. The Narrator vs. Tyler Durden.. Because for make belief, it just feels so real..
Â 


If they cut "You raped her, you killed her, you murdered her children" I'll go and kill the Mountain myself.
Also, I would looooove to see something like
"You know who am ?"
"Some dead man"
"I'm oberyn Martell, You killed my sister. You're going to die"


Â 
Hahahaha! Good to see that at least a part of the fandom still has enough sense of humor!

No, they will say that they white-washed The Mountain.
2068	Unbowed Unbent Unhodor	2014-05-27	In the show my favourite has been hound vs beric
On my recent re-watch of Troy I actually really enjoyed the movie. Theres quite a few good fight scenes in there

(but yeah, you know is the truth!!)
2070	majgat	2014-05-27	Looking forward to the duel. I hope it'll follow books and I think they'll look into Oberyn's past right before the fight. To show that he's even bigger baddass than Unsullied think he is.They HAVE to mention his nickname and how he earned it. I was little bit gutted that Tyrion didn't mentioned it in ep1 straight away. And was hoping a verbal clash between Olena and Elaria, where the Quenn of Thornes called Elaria "the serpant's whore" - my favourite moment, that was only mentioned in the books from Tyrion's POV.
2071	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-27	i really hope the episode ends with tywin saying "the prisoner will be executed on the morrow". or he could say something before the duel about how they will take tyrion's head if they lose. i really want to torment the unsullied. i dont want them to think "maybe he'll just go to the wall". no. they need to feel the feels like we did when we read "why would they waste a breath on the dead".
2072	scolbert08	2014-05-27	Someone on Reddit posted awhile back claiming to be an extra in this scene. According to him, all the main lines from the book are kept during the duel including "You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children", and Oberyn does get his head smashed in, but there are some changes, including Tyrion not vomiting.
2073	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	^In the summer during filming certain sneakyÂ extras on reddit were dead right about the Craster's business (mentioning Karl drinking wine out of Mormont's skull, Jon giving a speech, Bran getting captured etc). Though in theory anyone could lie about that, so far all of the ones I've ever come across were telling the truth.

2074	Widows_Blood	2014-05-27	D&D are always very faithful to the big book moments. I can forgive minor transgressions when they nail the memorable book moments and they always do. There will probably be some minor changes here and there; no vomiting, no random bystander getting cleaved, so i'm sure people will still bitch and moan though. My only hope is that they don't turn Oberyn into Yoda. Also, hope we get Oberyn's nickname.Â
2075	Queen of Whores	2014-05-27	^ There's no way weÂ won'tÂ get Oberyn's nickname, considering that the episode is titled "The ViperÂ and the Mountain." It would be ridiculous for them not to give him the name. They were probably waiting until episode 8 to explain the nickname so it isn't a dead-giveaway what the episode title meant (even though they showed parts of the dual in the trailers).
2076	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-27	I, for one, hope it's true that Tyrion doesn't vomit when Oberyn loses the duel. It's just one of those things that works well on the page, but wouldn't really transfer to the screen all that well, I think. I'm also fine with an innocent bystander not getting killed (seems that element was transposed to the re-introduction of The Mountain, in a sense), and didn't really expect it given the location they chose for the duel.Â
2077	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-27	Â 
I failed!


Â 
Ah, that could have been me, LOL
2078	WonderGray	2014-05-27	Just say her name. After Pedro Pascal's performance, I don't think I could stand seeing his face smashed. Perhaps just the eye gouging? No! Oberyn wins this time! No, sigh, he doesn't . Sorry folks, I'm super invested.

Damn,Â I totally forgot that, The Serpant's Whore, LOLÂ  I do wish they had left some of the specific Tyrell/Martell issues in, without a Willas, I'm not surprised.Â  That reminds me, has the QOT really left already?Â  I'm not certain, I saw her talk about it, but I wonder.
Â 
Can't wait for the duel, damn......reading I smashed her face in.....like this, is upsetting, LOLÂ  Pedro just rocks this role, damn....I'm gonna miss him.Â  He'd have made a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.Â

Â 
While I do have a bit of faith we will get some type of Viper mention, I'm not so sure the episode title is a guarantee.Â  IIRC, they never used Arya's Ghost of Harrenhal, inspite of the epi title, which........had me all kinds of hopeful.Â  Still, I think there is a bigger chance for Viper or Red Viper, especially since the casting call seems to specify the Sand Snakes next year.Â  A Viper breeds snakes, hopefully......they will make that clear.Â
2084	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-27	As soon as I saw Locke's death at the hands of Hodor this season, I felt certain Oberyn would die differently than in the books.
Â 
Hearing that Elia was cut in half in the TV series hardened that certainty. Of course, if Oberyn's line are changed to something like, "You raped her, you cut her in half, you killed her children," then the Mountain could say, "Elia of Dorne - I didn't cut her in half! I killed her like this," and smash his head in with all the same impact of confession. But with the other rumors already reported in this thread, the death will be softened from what's in the books. And that's a judgment call thing. It doesn't always work on screen. For example, Cat clawing her face open before dying at the Red Wedding. It really would have been too much at the end of that brutal scene on screen. And if they shot it and decided it was too much, I'll bet they did soften Oberyn's death scene. But Mr. Martell, he dead.

Â 
I hope they go with the cut in half thing, by the way. I think smashing his head in is a little too gruesome, especially when paired with gouging his eyes.Â

Setting him as this greatest badass on the planet's surface who is on an epic revenge-trip and then killing him off in his first fight due to his own fault..,. it's just too good. Changing it would be ruining it.

Â 
I kind of hope they don't try the cut in half thing with Oberyn.Â  IIRC, we had a somewhat similar halving in Battle of Blackwater......and I think it looked a bit fake.Â  It may be hard to do it as graphically described in the books, but The Hound trying to mash someone's face in during Ep1 this season, and not quite getting a good grip, not quite being able to do it.....makes me think they just may go that route with Oberyn.Â

Â 
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. And Locke's death wasn't a head crushing as much as it was a head wrenching. So using the rule of 3, it points to a more canonical death for the Viper.
Â 
Well, we'll know in five days!
2090	yushkevitch	2014-05-27	I can see the fight and dialogue being very loyal to the books except for the ending. I imagine the Mountain will say the same lines but instead of eye gouging, face caving or chopping in half he pulls Oberyn's dagger and stabs him between each line he speaks. The thrust and look on Oberyn's face as he's getting stabbed would have a similarly dramatic effect as the face punches,but without the gore.

I think there was plenty of gore in the series, not always completely justified, but in this scene it's actually important it stays. It's probably the most horrific death of a 'good character'.

Â 
Yes there has been plenty of gore but I'm not sure how important it is Oberyn has his face caved in? So many posters here constantly say such=and-such has to happen because it's too important in the books - but anything can be changed if you alter what comes next accordingly. Anything.
Â 
But my rationale for a stabbing vs. face smashing is primarily based on the fact that it will be significantly more difficult to pull that off from a visual and realistic standpoint than a stabbing. I'm sure they have a team of highly skilled CGI people just drooling at the prospect of a face being crushed by a huge fist, but that doesn't mean the director feels the same way.
Â 
Short version: Face caving? Maybe, but it will be a very tough scene to do justice to on screen.

What's worse? Book version or stabbing?
Which one is more heartbreaking to witness considering how beloved the character is?
Which one shows better just what kind of a monster Mountain is?
Which one is seldom seen in TV/movies hence more shocking?

We had Tyrion crash someone's face with shield in season 1.
2094	franko99	2014-05-27	That would be more jarring than that awful song in 3x03 end credits


Â 



^Well I doubt they'd do a folk punk rendering. In my head I picture the Dornishman's wife being a moody harmonic minor toned sort of thing. Karliene's cover on youtube is pretty cool too. But as I said, wouldn't we have heard about another band being commissioned to do it by now?


Â 
The Dornishman's wife is a cheerful song, it is the ultimate YOLO song in ASOIAF, as much as I love Karliene's voice, it doesn't fit for a loudly a tavern song.


^I hope we get the Dornishman's wife too (and it would be a perfect fit), but I think we would've heard something by now about it being recorded, wouldn't we?

Â 


I still hope for both Dornishman's wife and the Last of the Giants to be in this season, and the reason we hadn't heard any news is because they did hire a mainstream band to play it, or if they had they made sure to keep it under secret.
Â 
Or maybe I'm just to optimistic
2095	franko99	2014-05-27	Â 
The part of the duel that I have the clearest mental image of, however, is the end, which will double as the end of the episode. I've pretty much mapped out my ideal version of that scene, shot for shot, far too many times. 
Â 
Clegane brutally delivers the finishing blow to Oberyn - whether by smashing his head in, cutting him in half, or some combination of the two. Immediately following that scene we get two reaction shots in quick succession: Ellaria screams in despair and horror, and Tyrion falls to his knees and vomits. Then, interspersed with a few more shots of Oberyn's ruined body, we get a few stunned reaction shots from the people watching - among them Tywin, Cersei, and Jaime. Everyone is too stunned to speak. With the exception of Ellaria's heartbroken cries, the arena is completely and utterly silent.
Â 
Then Tyrion starts to laugh - softly at first, then louder and louder until he's basically cackling with hysteria. Those around him stare at him uneasily, convinced that he's lost his mind - which he basically has. His laughter mingles with Ellaria's sobs for several uncomfortable seconds before Tywin motions for the guards to take Tyrion away. Tyrion doesn't resist at all as he's half-marched, half-dragged out of the arena, still laughing uncontrollably. The camera lifts away from the scene into an aerial perspective, revealing the full extent of the carnage in the arena: Oberyn and Gregor Clegane lying next to one another in a slowly expanding pool of their shared blood. A tragedy and mockery of justice in one unforgettable image.
Â 
Ellaria's cries and Tyrion's despairing laughter continue to play over this shot until the screen cuts to black. The credits are accompanied by a suitably mournful song, or better yet, total silence.


 Â

Why are you not working for HBO???
Â 
D&D could really use someone like you, that was perfect Â
2096	Jinjonator	2014-05-27	Whether or not they keep it exactly the same as the book, I think Oberyn's death definitely needs to retain the same kind of brutality. Something like being cut in half with a sword just seems too... "clean". The thing that makes it shocking isn't just that he dies, but that he's so violently brutalized. And as much as it will break mine own heart, seriously, just imagine the reaction of people seeing a character they've come to love not only die, but die terribly. Imagine it. Imagine their faces.
2097	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-27	Someone on Reddit posted awhile back claiming to be an extra in this scene. According to him, all the main lines from the book are kept during the duel including "You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children", and Oberyn does get his head smashed in, but there are some changes, including Tyrion not vomiting.


 Â Â I hope they were telling the truth. I'd like to see Tyrion vomiting but it's less important to me than keeping the lines and cause of death similar.
2098	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-05-27	I don't understand why people would want the violence to be "toned down" because it's "too gruesome." That's the entire point. The brutality is shocking. It makes you feel things. I don't know if anyone has seen this comic but I stumbled across it this morning and I'm glad I did. It's a perfect portrayal of the duel and an example that the show should follow. Link:Â http://mccomseycomix...-12-page-comic/
Â 
One of the people who left a comment said something that I thought was really awesome. I had always imagined Oberyn felt immense fear and regret once the Mountain grabbed hold of his leg but this guy really put it into words nicely...
Â 
Â 

My favorite bit is the look of shock and very real fear on Oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s face and that he struggles in vain for his life when the Mountain grabs him right at the end. The Red Viper easily could be portrayed as an unwavering defiant caricature of vengeful wrath right up to the end and probably has been before, however this cartoonist gives us something rather different and in my opinion considerably more interesting. Their Oberyn Martell is suddenly confronted with the price he is going to have pay for the confession and vengeance for his murdered sister and realises in the last seconds of his life that he really doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to pay that priceâ<U+0080>¦
â<U+0080>¦but it is already too late!

2099	Jinjonator	2014-05-27	Also, this is HBO, so it's not like they're restricted by how gory they can potentially make it.

Â 
D&D has changed many things from the novels, but they've neverÂ had a character that should have died survive*. There is pretty much a 0% chance of this happening.
Â 
*The inn fight happened way out of sequence, the Hound will probably die from Biter's bite instead which is why they added it.

2102	Arkash	2014-05-27	I dont think Oberyn will be choped in half. The Mountain is supposed to be badly injured at this point of the duel, and lying on the ground. I dont see him managing to cut someone in half in that position.

Yea he's actually pinned to the ground by the spear and is unable to pull it out of his body. Assuming the same thing happens in the show, it would be quite impossible for him to cut someone in half. I like the idea of Oberyn having heard incorrectly that Elia was cut in half, with Gregor showing him first hand what really happened.Â

2104	Colonel Green	2014-05-27	Yeah, I agree that him being cut in half wouldn't make any sense based on how the duel goes.

I haven't been overly impressed with the fight choreography this season, but given the importance of this particular fight, and the length of time devoted to it, I hope they can deliver the goods.

TV Tyrion is quite different from book Tyrion, and it may seem out of character for him to fall into that same fit of hysterics.

I'm one of the few people who is not a fan of Dinklage's overacting - I thought what he did during the trial was waaaaay too much. I do adore him when he is being subtle, like in Tysha's story scene or just last ep with Oberyn. So I'm hoping we get the latter in ep.8 not laughing thing. Just an utter horror of the realization that his last chance is gone.

Â 
Will it actually be good for tv fans? The Starks in the first 3 seasons were thrown in the viewers face as the good guys. Then then they saw first Ned get decapitated, and just when they thought Robb was the ultimate bad ass winning batter after battle he gets his head ripped from his body also.
Â 
Now we have the Red Viper in the exact same situation, it will probably feel like just to much for most of them. Something among the lines " yeah we get it life is not fair, but killing every single character that has some good in them is not exactly real life, its more just cheap trills". I could see them loosing fans over Oberyn's death for this exact reason.

Interesting. I do think Dinklage has a tendency to overact (most noticeably in the trial scene, as you mentioned) but I believe that him laughing at the end of ep 8 would absolutely MAKE the episode. Those chilling, maniacal cackles would confirm just how ****ed Tyrion is.Â

Sure, anything can work if they pull it off  Someone mentioned the similarity to Breaking Bad's Crawl Space episode but hey, it's not like BrBa has monopoly on a scene like that.

Something among the lines " yeah we get it life is not fair, but killing every single character that has some good in them is not exactly real life, its more just cheap trills". I could see them loosing fans over Oberyn's death for this exact reason.


People were saying the exact same things about the Red Wedding, but the ratings have continued to go up in spite of all the good guys suffering. And considering they killed off the major villain of the series, I don't think anyone can rightly accuse the series of only having the good guys die.
Â 
(Also, anyone who responds to deaths with anything like "i get it, life isn't fair" is kind of ridiculous, since his death isn't there to beat some notion of life's unfairness into our heads; it actually serves a function in the plot; a far-cry from "cheap thrills")

Â 
It's not exactly the same situation. In most fans minds, Ned dies ok oh that's real life he dies..his son will avenge him...omg this guy is dead also...then another good guy comes..and another one dies.. see the flow?

I see what you're saying, and I'm pointing out that people said literally the exact same thing about the Red Wedding before it happened. The only difference between what you're saying now and what they said then is that there's one more dead person now. And tbh if anyone expected to make it through the rest of Game of Thrones without anyone else they like dying... they've clearly learned nothing. But people aren't going to stop watching because of it. Imagine how silly someone would look, 4 seasons into Game of Thrones, saying "I'm not watching anymore because they killed someone I like".
2117	FNF	2014-05-28	What are everybody's thoughts on Tyrion laughing at the end of the duel? As much as I want to hear that haunting, maniacal laugh, I doubt the show will include it. TV Tyrion is quite different from book Tyrion, and it may seem out of character for him to fall into that same fit of hysterics.


I wouldn't mind if Tyrion throws up and then looks at Jaime and starts laughing like a maniac. But I do worry if it will work or not.Â

2127	Bane66	2014-05-28	After this week's episode do you think any Unsullied will remember Robb's ass chewing of Edmure last season for chasing the Mountain off when Robb was hoping to surround and kill him? In the books it was Tywin's force he was planning to harry but for some reason they changed to The Mountain for the tv show.....
2128	Arkash	2014-05-28	Well, most Unsullieds have no idea who the fuck is Edmure, and those who'll remember him will not remember it was against the Mountain he did his mistake.
2129	Bane66	2014-05-28	Touche', sometime its painful how much and how quickly they forget.Â
2130	A Prince of Dorne	2014-05-28	As long as the fight is good, which I'm sure it will be, all that really matters to me is Oberyn saying " you raped her, you killed her, you murdered her children" over and over again, and yelling EEELLLIAAAAA when he stabs the Mountain. They HAVE to include that or I'm sure a lot of book readers ( if not all of them) are going to be pretty pissed.

Completely agree. Those lines are essential and I will die a little inside if they are cut or changed. Also, hoping they include Tyrion throwing up and the Mountain crushing his face in
2131	A Prince of Dorne	2014-05-28	If they were to cut "Only Cat" in episode 7 and then changed "You raped her. You killed her. You murdered her children" in the very next episode I think there would be a mutiny

Edmure did hold the stone mill from Gregor's army in the books. But Robb placed no specific importance on killing Gregor himself. He just wanted to lead Lannister forces into a trap. I believe they just included that bit to make Edmure's failure seem worse.Â

They actually lessened the failure considerably, since his failure didn't prevent Tywin's march into the Westerlands.Â  It was just him trying to kill the Mountain.

2137	westerosifitness	2014-05-28	Now, I've never been impressed with any of Jon Snow's choreography. I think the actor is simply a poor fighter.
Â 
Wait, not true, I enjoyed the recent scenes of him training newbies in the yard at Castle Black.
Â 
Normally, his work is shoddy.
Â 
The taking of Yunkai was laughably bad. Daario v. 1 was soooo slow. Jorah did a good job. That actor is excellent in swordplay. Greyworm had his cool spear stuff that was more stunt than combat but it looked good so no complaints there.
Â 
I love spear. I have been looking forward to this duel for quite a long time. I am certain they will do a fantastic job with it.
Â 
You'll see me in a corresponding thread after the episode if I am wrong.
Â 
Ned and Jaime were fantastic, but my favorite will be the Bronn vs. Vardis Egen fight. So real, so no-nonsense. Anti-Hollywood. Loved it.

Â 
I think this is a reasonable point. Some of the people who have replied to you so far have said it's unlikely that people would stop watching the show simply because characters die or because one of their favorites died. And that's true, hopefully. But the point you bring up extends much further--that some of the deaths in the series might come off as relatively empty shock tactics. And I could understand why this would turn people off. They really might draw a conclusion like, "Oh, yeah, this is that show where they kill one of the important 'good guys' every ninth episode to keep viewers guessing."Â 
Â 
To be honest, reading one of GRRM's interviews, I got a similar feeling. When asked about plotting the Red Wedding, he responded about why it had to happen by saying:
Â 
"Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense. I killed Ned in the first book and it shocked a lot of people. I killed Ned because everybody thinks heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the hero and that, sure, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to get into trouble, but then heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do."
That seems like a shockingly shallow explanation of why to do something. Based on this description, some of Martin's choices seem to be not so much about strong narrative and craft as they are simply about doing what's unexpected. And there's something to be said for doing what's unexpected. But it has to be backed up by craft.Â 
Now, personally, I've stuck with the books and the show because I think there's far more to it than that. This might not have been a very good interview, for whatever reason, and, to be honest, the rich complexity of his characters and world points to far more intelligent design than one that just automatically affords ultimate value to what's shocking or unexpected.
Â 
Still, if I were imagining a reader who didn't yet have any context about the Dorne plot in the books and how Oberyn's death functions in relation to that plot, I really could understand how a viewer might see Oberyn's death as a final straw. The ratings may keep climbing, but that doesn't mean a couple viewers with legitimate concerns wouldn't turn their backs on it.

Yeah I'm sure they'll do that. As gross as I'm sure it will be, it will help show just how evil Cersei is - sending him people even though she knows what will happen to them.
2149	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-29	Hey,Â  the TV show has twisted the plot enough around to the point where Oberyn could win....That is good Oberyn has a greater well of character development than Gregor will ever have...but I suppose I'm whistling against the wind here and for once the TV show will follow the plot of books...
Hey, again as far as fighting goes I would suggest pretty much any episode of Starz Spartacus outdoes anything so far that has been on GoT....

Twisted the plot? It's nigh on identical. Stop exaggerating plz.

I would love to see that for many reasons but it just won't happen. Ned was considerably younger at that time so Sean Bean would probably have to be recast for the scene and no one would know any of the characters. Plus, if they show the fight outside the tower, they're pretty much obligated to show a little of what happens inside the tower and that's still one of the biggest mysteries to book readers.
Â

I agree, Spartacus's combat scenes were laughable. They were too flashy and flamboyant to be taken seriously. The only time I've seen the fightÂ choreographers totally fail us is the three man "seige" of Yunkai. Otherwise, all the fights have been realistic and retain a sense of urgency.Â

Â 
I do think it's a valid concern, that some tv only fans may reach a breaking point.Â  It won't be because GOT killed off someone they like, it would be because, in their minds, it seems that is all the show does, kill off characters that are liked, over and over again.Â  I've seen people drop series mid flow for the silliest of reasons, this would be more understandable, I think.Â  I'm not saying I agree with it, but 4 seasons in some may feel that it's just more than they care to handle for purely entertainment purposes.Â

Â 
While I don't personally know anyone that stopped the books for reasons such as this, I do know someone whose family member did so.....and it was during ASOS.Â  The thing that's important to remember here is that people do tend to drop tv shows much more often than they do a series of books.Â 
Â 
Luckily, the ratings have risen so much this season, if I understand correctly, that I doubt the show will take a huge hit.Â  We may have hit the high point with ratings, though, this season.Â  That is a distinct possibility.Â

But I was excited at his death in the books because...it meant Cersei was going to be defenseless. As much as her dad used her, he also protected her. And I hate her (book cersei) with a passion. I was actually reading a bit of Dance the other night (the chapters where she was dealing with confinement and then her walk of shame)...and I actuallly started to feel bad for her for about five seconds. I then chided myself for feeling that way. I think the show made me sympathize with her more due to her Robert scene in season one as well as many scenes after that. And I hate that they hid her shittiness to the world of non-readers, although they are probably about to see her fucked up side.
Â 
Can't wait for the last several episodes, that's for sure!
2165	Bib Fortuna	2014-05-30	I'll admit I did fling my copy of ASOS across the room after the Red Wedding. But it wasn't because of Robb's and Cat's deaths. It was the fact that Arya was inches away from reuniting with her family before they were brutally murdered. And the fact that at the time, I thought that the Hound had killed Arya as well.
2166	ServantOnIce	2014-05-30	I Re Read The Duel last night and instead of picturing and hearing how I imagine Oberyn sounds, now I hear and see Pedro Pascal!!! Wow it has changed the perspective . .. Â  Â
2167	Konradsmith	2014-05-30	^Same! I used to picture Oberyn with a British accent...not anymore. Pedro was a great find from Nina Gold.

I think it's something that could potentially be shown toward the end of the series through one of Bran's tree visions; perhaps when we find out Jon Snow's true lineage.Â 
Â 
I don't expect it to happen, but it would certainly be awesome.Â 


IÂ know this isn't the right place for this, but what if they cut the toj scene in with the ides of marsh? if the reveal happens in the beginning of twow, this might be kind of cool. it can just be a bran dream. they dont even have to do the full reveal. just show the fight (or the pre-fight like in the book). they dont even have to include the baby or lyanna, except for some screaming while she gives birth.
another thing they could do is open the next episode after the stabbing with it. that would be cool.
2169	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-05-30	Stannis cutting through plate as if it was tissue-paper is realistic?


I don't remember that scene but your rebuttal suddenly reminded me of a shirtless Ramsay effortlessly killing two fully armored Iron islanders in close quarters combat. For the MOST part the fights have been realistic...

2170	Fjordgazer	2014-05-31	For the love of whatever god you worship, i hope they don't have Oberyn cut in half. THAT is over the top, not having his head smashed in.
Â 
One detail that i imagined for the scene is Tywin being the first to come out of the shock and pronounce Tyrion's sentence to die. I'm one of those who hope that they keep his puking, for the dramatic image that it brings. And finally, that they show Oberyn having a hard time wielding the 6-ft sword, because that would add one more reason for him to be caught off guard.
2171	Stark11	2014-05-31	It never ceases to amaze me how many people continue to make this prediction, and how every single year the ratings are higher than they were before.

I love this. Shows how good this show is to non book readers. People on here can bitch about it all they want but as long as the story is compelling and well written (to the general viewer) people will continue to watch no matter who dies or lives. We have to remember there is absolutely nothing even close to this anywhere else on TV so those who watch will continue to do so until it's over (even if they just DVR and watch it later).
Also I'd like to point out as long as Jon, Dany, Arya and Tyrion are living they will not lose any viewers. Those are essentially the "main" characters in the TV show to most viewers IMO.
2172	Widows_Blood	2014-05-31	The inspiration for Oberyns fighting style is Wushu.Â

2173	westerosifitness	2014-05-31	I think show watchers will be more concerned with what this means for Tyrion than Oberyn's death. He was a cool character and people will be mad that he is gone, but it is important that they liked Oberyn, otherwise all the Dorne plotlines coming up would seem pointless to them.
Â 
Its funny how we're so excited about this duel, but loathe seeing outcome. Its such a bittersweet fight, and one of the best moments in the series.
2174	Gerg Sknab	2014-05-31	I know I'm a minority of one nevertheless...Oberyn should win....so much more could be done with the character deepens the storyline and it doesn't necessarily twist the plotline outlandishly....
Tywin is still going to die anyway if not through the use of a crossbow but the poision Oberyn gave over dinner will...death by constipation a fitting end
Cersei in a fit of pique could still get Tyrion on a ship to Pentos using Jamie and Varys as her catspaws (Varys as a catpaw... chuckle) seeing that she can't just kill him off
Tyrion can make his Essos trip meet the Griffs, Mormount maybe Dany and dream of as dragons as he wishes...
Oberyn returns to Dorne the conquering champion and has Doran send Lady Nym in his place as advisor
The only thread undone is the fate of Shae but does she really matter in any case unless lets say Varys takes it into his head Shae knows too much and he in fact strangles her and disappears until things quiet down....
All this still allows Cersei to delve into alcholism, paronoia and poor decision making,,,She can still build her "smallest" small council of nobodies and never was'es...she can still become Queen Regent...she can still sitÂ  and stew about the Tyrell's.....
Â However I suppose we'll just have to hear "you raped her" "you murdered her" "you killed her children"...with grunts and "some dead man" in reply....Oh well

The plot is fundamentally broken if Oberyn wins. Tyrion's story arc, as well as the entire story arc of all of Dorne would have to be completely rewritten.

First off, all these ideas to get things to the same destination with Oberyn still alive are extremely contrived and are pretty much impossible to imagine them playing out (I'm trying the visualize a scene where Cersei is saying "well, I can't kill you even though Tywin is dead, so I'm going to put you on a boat and send you to Pentos for some reason" and I can't; also, this would completely remove literally all paranoia about Tyrion, which was a major factor in her mental descent). It also gives Dorne no reason to join the war (or at least, no compelling reason, that viewers would care about). It also takes every interesting scene (Trial by Combat, Tyrion's escape) and makes them significantly less interesting and less dramatic.
Â 
Oh yeah, and having Tyrion not kill Tywin or Shae also completely changes his character. Basically, this is a bad idea, and why are people still suggesting it, this is literally worse than "purple wedding is definitely gonna be in 3x10 guys".

He has to die. I love him just as much as anybody else but he has to die. I was really shocked by his death in the books and although I was upset about it for another hundred pages or so, I thought to myself mostly "damn, that was good." At no point did I wish he had survived because that part of the book to me was so... meaningful I guess you could call it. It's something that gets a rise out of you and that's just great story telling.Â

2192	Shy	2014-06-01	In the book, the buildup to this fight alone felt like nearly a whole chapter.. The tension was off the hook, easily my favourite part of the series so far. I just hope D&D don't do what they did with the Red Wedding and go for gratuitous shock tactics, and almost comical deaths.. This duel needs to be tense and visceral with out being over the top. I'm looking forward to it and dreading it in equal measures.. Both for the outcome and the execution of the scene itself..
Â 
I'm interested to see how it ends.. Obviously Gregor needs to confess at some point. A lot of people seem to think Oberyn will be cut in half, because of what he said to Tyrion about Elia. To be honest I think people are just seeing foreshadowing in everything now.. Has anyone considered they might kill each other? With Gregor landing the killing blow with his dying breath.. I can't see the show utilising the undead Robert Strong it seems a bit far-fetched for a TV audience to me.

Â 
I hope they let Gregor survive the fight and let him die in Qyburn's hands. There needs to be a winner and a loser, it shouldn't look like a draw.
And I hope they make it as gruesome as it is in the books. It makes it a much more powerful scene.
2194	Rikard Stark	2014-06-01	I will hunt David and Dan through all seven hells if they do not get the fight right.
1) Obyren needs to be angry and have the book dialogue
2) Obyren needs to land the final blow on the mountain before the mountain finally crushes his skull.
3) Elliria needs to burst out crying and Tyrion needs to throw up!
Gods i am excited for this. Best fight for me so far was Anikin VS Obi wan in revenge of the Sith. But I reckon this will trump that!
2195	Rikard Stark	2014-06-01	I also kinda want the mountain to chop someone else's head off mid duel, like he killed the stable boy in the books!
2196	Shy	2014-06-01	I agree Oberyn definetely needs to lose his charm and flip his lid, TV viewers need to know how dangerous he can be, as so far they've only seen the debauched, witty side of him. It's unfortunate that Gregor hasn't been quite as built up as the indestructible phenom that he is constantly referred to in the books. The scene with Cersei watching him fight was like a 'hey remember this guy..?'.. My unsullied girlfriend was like "she's picked some random big bloke?" and I had to remind her of the horse beheading at the tourney etc otherwise she wouldn't have drawn the connection.
2197	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-01	He has to die. I love him just as much as anybody else but he has to die.

Â 


Couldn't agree more. It's like a roller coaster ride. One minute you think Oberyn's got him beat and Tyrion is free, then everything goes wrong. Now Tyrion is doomed, then next thing you know he's freed and it leads to another incredibly shocking scene. The KL storyline is gold at the end of ASOS, no way they're changing it.
2198	fangirl000	2014-06-01	They've been very strategic in only showing Oberyn in motion in all the clips they've provided so far. The Mountain has more or less been stationary and we haven't even got a shot of him swinging his sword.
Â 
Clearly, Oberyn is going to be the one doing most of the movement during the duel as that's his fighting style but it's going to be interesting to see how much they showcase the Mountain. An interview recently stated that one of the reasons they got Thor to take on the Mountain 3.0 role is because he had a basketball background which meant he moved very well for a man his size.
Â 
The clips haven't indicated this but for the most part, the clips appear to be only from the very beginning of the duel with Oberyn demonstrating his agility.
Â 
We also don't know how much there will be in the way of verbal taunting that takes place during the duel. I imagine they'll have Oberyn keep his lines from the book (although they may not be word for word). Will the Mountain have any lines and will they be dubbed?

In the jail cell conversation, Bronn did give one hint of what's to come - he told Tyrion that the Mountain is unusually quick for a man of his size.
2199	The Ghost of Rhaegar	2014-06-01	truth is the whole "Oberyn wins!!! oh shit no Gregory just crushed his f****** skull!?!" was one of the best gotcha moments for me reading the books and it should and will have the same effect for the HBO show. Â People will believe Oberyn has done it and saved tyrion, then all of that will be flipped. Â Its gotta stay that way, thats what makes this story so good. Â  
Â 
I imagine the chatter after this episode will go nuts.

Â 
My husband is an unsullied and he's just been saying "Oberyn has to win" and then he remembers the RW and goes "right" and I just want to talk about how nervous I am about this episode and I can't because I don't want to spoil it.

Â I've been worried we might not get any of the pre-battle conversation between Tyrion and Oberyn, but perhaps they will have to do it......just for the poison dialogue alone. Â I just think that the show should tell some of the story of Elia and Rhaegar and Cersei at the very least, as that is one reason that Oberyn is sure that Tywin purposefully issued orders to kill Elia, the slight that Tywin felt from King Aerys over refusing to wed Cersei to Rhaegar. Â I think all of that is important for NOW, and for upcoming story. Â Now I'm more hopeful, just because of the poison, LOL Â I'm still pissed they had Oberyn say it was his father that took them to Casterly Rock though. Â WTF??? Â

I hope to see you and many on the flip side of the episode. Â I just CANNOT watch and post, I want The Red Viper to get all of my attention. Â  Â  Â  Â
2222	Mark Antony	2014-06-01	If it's half as good as this, it'll be the best fight scene ever done on television.


it's got some tough HBO competition, We gon seeÂ
2223	Zeppelin	2014-06-01	AHHHH I'm reaching a point where I'm actually nervous to watch. Â This is how I felt before the Red Wedding Episode.
Â 
This scene in the book was one I had to reread so many times cause I could't believe I actually read it and now with how well Pedro has portrayed Oberyn I'm just a ball of nerves.
Â 
My husband is an unsullied and he's just been saying "Oberyn has to win" and then he remembers the RW and goes "right" and I just want to talk about how nervous I am about this episode and I can't because I don't want to spoil it.
Â 
So I'm here


Â 
I know exactly what you mean!
Â 
I almost don't want this episode to happen. I don't want to lose Oberyn, or more precisely, I don't want to lose Pedro Pescal.
Â 
If any other actor had been portraying Oberyn, I wouldn't be feeling this way. Pescal has nailed this role and i'll be very sad to see him go.
2224	Mark Antony	2014-06-01	i loved itÂ

that is all..................
2227	Mikaele	2014-06-01	Im going to have nightmares
2228	Defeatarion	2014-06-01	Jesus Christ. The screams. The feelings of throwing up when I read the scene in the book are nothing compared to how I feel now.Â
2229	Zman1863	2014-06-01	I think seeing the violence of the conclusion was worse than reading it.
Â 
I particularly liked seeing Tyrion's silent reaction. Really captures the line of "I put my life in my hands and he dropped it." You could put a GIF of that after any subsequent time DeSean Jackson lets go of the ball on the half yardline of what should have been a touchdown run.Â
2230	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-01	Wait!!! He was supposed to chop him in half with his sword!!!Â
2231	Simon Steele	2014-06-01	Man that was tough. I remember being underwhelmed by Ned, and having Arya's reaction to her Aunt's death when I saw the ridiculousness of the filmed version of the Red Wedding. But tonight, man...that crushed me.
Â 
Maybe when I read A Storm of Swords I was so in shock from the Red Wedding that everything that came after felt dull/blunted, I don't know.
Â 
Oberyn got me tonight.
2232	Ice_Specter	2014-06-01	Positives
Oberyn nailed the arrogance and athletic ability
Death was just as brutal as I thought it'd be
Negatives
I thought there were too many cuts
Don't think Oberyn was angry enough
Lack of build up (What happens when you recast a character 3 times)
I would have liked to see Tyrion throw up but I'm fine with the silent reaction. it was just as good
2233	Ran	2014-06-01	There were definitely waaaaay too many cuts.
Â 
Going to go through that fight and cut how many cuts there are. This is Bourne-level amounts of cutting, and while it makes sense there -- close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat, often in cramped spaces -- this didn't let the fight breathe at all.
2234	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-01	We have choreographers.
2235	Chuck88	2014-06-01	I feel sick.
2236	Sarah1128	2014-06-01	I thought it was brilliantly entertaining! I am grieving for Oberyn <U+00F0><U+009F>c Knew what was coming &I was on the edge of my seat...squealing! It was brutal. <U+00F0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F>
2237	A Man Reads	2014-06-01	I loved it. It was shorter than I would have liked and less descriptive than in the book. But for a television adaptation, it was excellent. I don't even care that they cut "EEEEELLLLLLIIIIIAAAAA!"
2238	KalibakCruel	2014-06-01	Brutal is definitely the word for it. I knew it was coming. I knew what was going to happen, and it still just sucked to watch. Poor poor Oberyn.
2239	Lady Arwen	2014-06-01	Wow. Beautifully executed. Pedro is brilliant. And Ellaria got me right in the feels.Â
2240	Emperoreddy	2014-06-01	Brutality I think works a number of ways. Is faithful to the books, but just brings in the utter horror and shock that is implied by what happened for every unsullied watcher. Shock being that not only did an awesome character die, but Tyrion looks doomed too.
2241	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-06-01	I absolutely loved it.
- Battle was epic 
- Kit's lips were as kissable as always 
- "...people die in their beds, people die squatting over their chamber pots" 
- Oberyn was great  Gregor was eh but alright considering
2242	Darth Pipes	2014-06-01	That ending left me legitimately horrified.Â  I was wondering how they were going to pull that off....mission accomplished.
Â 
I thought it was great.Â  A little shorter than I expected (I blame the endless beetle speech for that) and I was waiting for the Mountain to cut down the random spectator like he does in the book but otherwise, job well done.

Â 
Yes, thank you! Where was that endless beetle speech going anyway?Â
2244	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-06-01	Honestly I was underwhelmed. Too short, should have gotten rid of the beetle story and given the fight more time. More of the mountain bleeding as he chased Oberyn around.
2245	hedgeknight001	2014-06-01	The Orgy Guy just wasn't going to defeat *that*.
2246	Boarsbane	2014-06-01	I liked how quickly the tables turned, one second Oberyn is standing over Gregor victorious, going on with his pointless "you killed Elia" and smiling to Ellaria, the next he is on his back screaming while his eyes are gouged out.

2247	Dirk blitzen	2014-06-01	Loved the fight scene.  There weren't too many cuts for me, but the editing itself was choppy.  A sign of poor direction really...  But still good enough to carry the story and get the point across.
Im glad they didn't stretch out the fight.  Oberyns yelling would have gotten so annoying.
  I love that he targeted tywin while yelling though.  Was that in the book?
2248	Gwynbleidd	2014-06-01	The scream adds to the horror of Oberyn's death. As if the gore wasn't enough.
2249	Howdyphillip	2014-06-01	There were definitely waaaaay too many cuts.

I disagree Ran... I personally felt that the cutting in the scene brought the perfect amount of tension. It also allowed for the stunts to be pulled off in an unprecedented fashion for the show. If they filmed it by static camera, it would have lost its impact.
2250	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-01	The fight was really well done- but I did think (or at least hoped) they'd devote a lot more time to it. They dragged feet with a few things, though I did think the whole beetle speech was entirely characteristic of someone about to die. Arbitrary conversation taken to rambling to keep the mind off of what is essentially your impending doom. Talking about something completely off topic, but somehow having it connect to the situation.
Â 
The only thing I disliked was hearing Oberyn cry out, totally justified in that situation of course... but in the books, he died blindsided getting punched, silently. He was probably too stunned, potentially brain-dead, by the first punch to even completely feel the pain of what was happening. This way, it was like Gregor got his satisfaction as much as Oberyn, making him scream, being on top for the end. I know it's nitpicking, but damn it fucked me up. I also don't like how many times Oberyn got knocked down in that short amount of time, it threw the build up out of whack. Oberyn had some close calls in the fight, yeah- but for the most part it was all like "Yeah, he's got this, he's gonna win- OH MY GOD HE'S GOT IT, YES!!!... fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-" It kind of foreshadowed his doom a little bit in a way, where as the book completely shocked. It is probably different from the view of an Unsullied.
Â 
Otherwise, I loved it. It devestated me even worse than the books did. Really. With Arya, I felt that the Wushu she was doing was a little out of place with her suddenly being Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger- but with Oberyn, it was just fuckin awesome. That choreography was almost Yen Woo Ping levels of awesome, Donnie Yen levels of awesome, but a lot more realistic looking.
2251	Ran	2014-06-01	When does "too many cuts" = "static camera"?
Â 
This thing looks like it was cut twice as fast as, for example, the Achilles vs. Hector final fight in Troy (not my favorite fight scene in the world, but given that spears are used at the start, it gives a sense of the sort of ideal cutting when weapons can traverse a long distance).
Â 
And it's definitely much, much faster than the greatest sword fight ever put to film (aka the finale of Rob Roy, which also happens to be a pretty pitch perfect model for how the scene plays out in the books.) That one's chock full of tension without needing to cut the action into near-incomprehensibility.
Â 
And then the decision to go with all the wushu flourishes like somersaults -- stuff that it's quite obvious Pascal wasn't doing, and from the video they released I'm pretty sure we see his stunt double working on the scene with Thor -- meant these crazy crane shots all the time. It was a lot of baffling directorial, editing, and choreography decisions.

2252	MegaMagick	2014-06-01	WOW! They absolutely nailed Oberyn's death. NAILED IT! Â I was still so shocked even though i knew it was going to happen. Nightmare fuel.Â 
Â 
That's what you get for being cocky!
2253	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-01	Hello, I am Oberyn Martell, brother of Elia, you kill my sister, prepare to die.  
Missed the audience member getting chopped up, other than that it was a good scene I thought, it captured what I always took from the book, Oberyn's arrogance got the better of him.
2254	Dirk blitzen	2014-06-01	Rewatching the scene, I think the real problem is all the reaction shots.  That's what's really disrupting the flow of the whole thing.  Gotta have them, but it sacrificed the fluidity of the fight.
It'd have been nice to do a lot of it in say one shot, where the camera circles around and then at key moments like when oberyn stabs gregor, the camera could whip pan to Tyrion and flow back to oberyn shouting his stuff... But this is still tv and there are limits to production... Though, unrelated, the opening tracking shot at moles town that lasted like 2 min was done very well

2255	Lord Varys	2014-06-01	I'd have to second the cutting issue. You (or perhaps only I) can see the cuts, and they are annoying. At times, it really felt as if they had cut large portions out of the fight, so this was really bad cutting.Â 
Â 
But now I must really go to sleep.
2256	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-01	Some things I went nuts over--
Â 
Oberyn's "no, no, no..." got across a ton of his character. He wasn't toying with him in the "this is teh funsies!" sense, but doing what he could, what he dreamed of, to not devolve into complete sputtering rage. He wasn't thoughtless--he was glancing down at the Mountain as he railed at Tywin, but he made one wrong move, drifting a bit too close to Gregor's arm, and as Bronn prophecized,that was the end.Â 
Â 
His screams! SHIT MAN! I don't care how much of a badass you are, you're screeching like a nutcase if your eyes are getting gouged out. Death is a leveller.Â 
Â 
Ellaria's scream! Hit me SO much harder than the book version. I KEENED when she looked so proud--earlier she was nervous, but then she was like "you go babe, get your vengeance." Then her horror...fuck!Â 
Â 
Oberyn letting himself get pushed around just a bit, to give him an advantage. It reminded me of that study about people who are a bit sauced having a better chance of surviving a car wreck. He really was like a snake.Â
2257	Ran	2014-06-01	There's definitely a lot of reaction shots. They could have compressed some of these by simply showing two or three characters in one shot -- i.e. Ellaria and Tyrion together, Jaime, Cersei, Tywin together -- instead of doing individual reactions for each actor, but for whatever reason they preferred the individual shots.
2258	NightStark	2014-06-01	If you watch the 'Learning the Moves' video on YT they explain that the fight was filmed in stages to allow Pedro to get his breath back and speak his lines.
2259	Dirk blitzen	2014-06-01	If you watch the 'Learning the Moves' video on YT they explain that the fight was filmed in stages to allow Pedro to get his breath back and speak his lines.

This is why books will always be superior to tv and film.  Production will always have complications... Like actors needing to breath oxygen... Damnit Pedro!
2260	Fuse Prime	2014-06-01	I loved it. Â I loved how Pascal's tone steadily grew as the fight went on. Â I'll probably need a couple of days to let it stew, and probably another viewing of the episode, but I think it's up there with one of the best duels on TV.
2261	Empress In The North	2014-06-01	My eyes...
Â 
Going to have nightmares for days...
2262	Ran	2014-06-01	Most complicated fight scenes are filmed in stages. I think mostly they meant that some of the stages were simplified to give him more time to get lines out, rather than suggesting they were doing something unique.
2263	Rikard Stark	2014-06-01	The death was perfect, however at no point does the mountain knock Obyren down. That really annoied me, Obyren always out paces him. Fight was good but not as long or decent as I expected.
2264	Colonel Green	2014-06-01	I thought it was very well-done, except that the Mountain's temporary recover looked way too complete.
2265	Defeatarion	2014-06-01	My eyes hurt. I'm still not over it. Also i didnt know all of you were directors hahaÂ
2266	Darkbringer	2014-06-01	A couple of little deviations, but nothing too bad, overall very well done. the horror...

2267	Howdyphillip	2014-06-01	Â Ran,
Â 
I just watched the Rob Roy fight as to your link. There was 22 cuts in the first minute. The first minute of this fight had 32. While not insignificant, it wasn't completely out of sinc for an action sequence.Â The drastic difference between the two is that a lot of the shots in Rob Roy were just tightening or widening the same position while this fight went to completely different content quite a lot. Â Your more detailed post saying that you would have liked to have seen less shots of individual reactions clarifies things though.Â 
Â 
I personally think that the story was told well using that medium as it allowed for better stunts. If you did not like the stunts, that is perfectly understandable.
2268	Rikard Stark	2014-06-01	I loved elliras screams when she knows it is over, but Tyrion could have at least done the laugh. Oh and Obyrens bloody mess of a head was perfect!
2269	sati	2014-06-01	I loved elliras screams when she knows it is over, but Tyrion could have at least done the laugh. Oh and Obyrens bloody mess of a head was perfect!


I loved Tyrion's reaction. I thought it was better than in the book.
2270	Meroveus	2014-06-01	Would have been better if they could have kept Conan Stevens or this new Mountain through all 4 seasons.
2271	A Man Is A Man	2014-06-01	I thought it was well done but it's still, sadly, better in the books. The build of it. And I missed the bit where the crowd is all around the fighters and Gregor cuts the arm off of someone in the crowd, he screams for him to shut up and then chops his head off while the crowd frantically runs away. I also kind of wish they kept it as in the books where Gregor is pinned to the ground by the spear and has to pull Oberyn down to him and clutch him close while he kills him. It's a little silly too that Gregor can just squeeze his head like a grape rather than smashing it in with his armored fist. The later I can buy, the former, not really.
2272	Meroveus	2014-06-01	Â It's a little silly too that Gregor can just squeeze his head like a grape rather than smashing it in with his armored fist. The later I can buy, the former, not really.


I agree. The squishing of the head like a grape was a bit over the top.
2273	Ran	2014-06-01	32 cuts? I count 64 or so cuts in the first minute of the fight.
2274	Gneisenau	2014-06-01	I found the fight hard to follow, but man Oberyn's scream really added to the scene.
2275	Ankou	2014-06-01	I am still as disappointed that he WON and he just couldn't finish it as I was when I first read it. i want to blow my breakfast out.
2276	Gneisenau	2014-06-01	I agree. The squishing of the head like a grape was a bit over the top.

Doesn't Gregor squeeze the eyeballs resulting in Oberyn screaming and then he smashes his head resulting in the outpour of brain matter ?
2277	Ankou	2014-06-01	Yeah but he still squished his head. Over the top even for the Mountain.
2278	JonInVa	2014-06-01	Loved it. Nobody mentioned all the teeth falling to the ground after the first punch? That was book solid and hideous.
2279	Howdyphillip	2014-06-01	32 cuts? I count 64 or so cuts in the first minute of the fight.


Â 
I miscounted... I just watched it again from where the spear is placed in Oberyn's hands. I counted 40 cuts using a stop watch the first minute... Considerable more than Rob Roy. I still think that your issue has more to do with content of the fight rather than pacing of the cuts.Â
2280	Ankou	2014-06-01	Loved it. Nobody mentioned all the teeth falling to the ground after the first punch? That was book solid and hideous.


I misread that as "book solid and hilarious." I thought to myself "Here is a true fan of GRRM."
2281	Ran	2014-06-01	The pacing of cuts tears the content to pieces, is the thing. You can't treat a guy with a two meter sword and another with an 8 foot spear as if they're punching one another -- room is needed for the weapons. And yes, while I hate the wushu acrobatics as a concept for Dornish fighting, in practice it was terrible for the fight because all of those stunts were from a stunt double, meaning they had to resort to various techniques to hide it -- like those crane shots way up in the air that basically just pull you way out so you can't see much of anything.
Â 
Bad decisions lead to poor content, basically.
Â 
I'll do a proper count tomorrow, as prep for our video review.
2282	Defeatarion	2014-06-01	The teeth thing was brutal...the eyes even more brutal...the head....ughÂ
2283	Ankou	2014-06-01	At least the Mountain's wiener rots off.
2284	Oakenfist	2014-06-01	Fantastic duel, so brutal at the end. Crushed his head in like a grape.
2285	Fredwin	2014-06-01	Yeah, the cuts were excessive. Way too fast paced and cinematic. The reaction shots weren't the issue as much as not knowing when to use them. They transformed what was supposed to be aÂ duelÂ into like a sporting event or gladitorial competition. Was hoping to see one of the coolest duels ever put to print played out in epic fashion.
Â 
What I got was serviceable but there was no heart behind it. This wasn't a personal, two-man war between the fricken' Mountain and the Viper it seemed more like some sort of brutal circus act or round of a mortal kombat. I loved the duel between the Hound and Beric so much more and if you think about it they had much less to work with.
Â 
Petty gripes: They should have bulked up the Mountain's armor. He look's huge but not really "The mountain that rides", huge. At one point they showed Oberyn hamstring the Mountain but they really should have been showing how he was strategically targeting the Mountain's joints. All those vulnerabilities in his armor where Oberyn's spear could actually be useful. I think if they only extended the fight by another 2-3 minutes, drew it out longer, and shown how Oberyn had an actual operational plan to take this monster down it would have worked better on the screen.

Â 
^ This, I felt the editing and cuts was a bit off...
2287	Ankou	2014-06-01	The biggest mistake in the scene I feel is making the Mountain Jason Voorhees, lying motionless and then having catlike reflexes. In the book he was pinned and struggling, though clearly a dead man, and it makes the mistake Oberyn made even more hubris.
2288	Widows_Blood	2014-06-01	I loved the choreography of the fight scene. But I will echo others sentiments about the excessive cuts and reaction shots. If I were to give the Duel a score of 10 I would probably give it a 9. The editing, while jarring at times, wasn't enough to detract from the overall fight. Â
2289	andrew_	2014-06-01	They pulled it off well, loved that Oberyns squire before the fight was rubbing his spear-head with what looked like a wet/poison cloth!
Â 
Loved how graphic it was. Thank you Pedro Pascal for a great performance as one of my favorite characters from the book!
2290	TheGreenBell	2014-06-01	I actually thought it was okay. The head crushing though....Â
2291	Defeatarion	2014-06-01	I think we all can say: THANK YOU PEDRO
2292	ServantOnIce	2014-06-01	I think they did a fantastic job.
Â 
1. I was urked that Prince Oberyn did not have a helmet, even a half helm or a shield, and why didn't Ser Gregor have a shield?
Â 
2. I liked the fact that he played up to the crowd and he was fast, rapid fast.
Â 
3. Again, he was cocky and foolish and that cost him his life.
Â 
4. I liked the fact that they kept the dialogue pretty close to the books. They didn't change too much and that was my biggest fear, they didn't do a, "Your Sister" to us.Â 
Â 
Great job overall, great season, I imagined more blood from Ser Gregor as he didn't have much leaking out, but Prince Oberyn, "You win or you die." and he lost.!
2293	AdmiraloftheDothrakiSea	2014-06-01	It was good. The "You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children" line was really good towards the end. Not so much at the start. I wish they had the line from the books where he tells the Mountain that if he dies without confessing then he'd hunt him through all seven hells or something like that. That was one of the most epic lines ever.
2294	Solrac saicam	2014-06-01	Man, that was hard to watch. I Read the books and knew what was coming, but seeing one of my favorite character die like that, gee, pretty brutal. The Grey Worm / Missandei thing there was just filler and I wished it never happened. Still, I believe this was my favorite ep this season.
,Â
2295	Gendrys Forge	2014-06-01	I liked all the reaction shots, especially Jaime, you could just read him.Â  "Holy shit, this guy DOES deserve his nickname.. Tyrion has this in the bag."

Â While I will agree that the scene did leave an entirely different feel than in the books, I would argue vehemently that it wasn't successful in portraying the fight. I watch the show with a bunch of people unfamiliar with the books, and tonight, I had a house full of people with their mouths dropped open in awe and horror. Â 
Â 
Â I even heard one person say that he thought it might be his favorite sword fight. Now, I am in agreement with you about Rob Roy just to let you know, but this fight was incredibly successful. It just captured it on a meta level rather than the micro level that you were looking for.Â
2297	The Sword of the Night	2014-06-01	The scene was amazing. You couldn't ask for that much more.

2300	Starkfaithful85	2014-06-01	the scene was well done and if I hadn't read the boks I would have said it was amazing...i woud have liked to have seen the black liquid on the viper's blade though

I'm not really a complainer but I would have liked to have seen them focus on why he is called the red viper a little more, they had the opportunity in the cell, when Tyrion said, well he is called the red viper, you don't get that name for nothing.
2305	Ice_Specter	2014-06-02	I like Jaime's reaction but at the same time I thought, why is he enjoying the show there? Shouldn't he be... Kingsguarding??


Lol I was thinking this too. Where is his armor?

Ser Pounce was on duty
2307	kephv	2014-06-02	Surprise surprise! They fucked it up. Hell, the Hound's fight last season with Beric was much better than this. Tyrion's look of disappointment at the end said it all.
2308	JonInVa	2014-06-02	Strangely enough you wouldn't think he would have needed poison to kill him with that spear thrust right through the chest. No matter how big you are, pierced stomach or intestines all the way though would kill you for sure. That guy the hound put out of his misery also "wasn't going to get better..". Have to wonder how the Mountain lives long enough to even die by poison with that wound. I didn't really think about that from the books, but seeing it made it come to mind.
Not a nitpick but an observation. Like I said in an earlier post, I loved the spectacle of it all.
2309	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-06-02	I think seeing the violence of the conclusion was worse than reading it.
Â 
I particularly liked seeing Tyrion's silent reaction. Really captures the line of "I put my life in my hands and he dropped it." You could put a GIF of that after any subsequent time DeSean Jackson lets go of the ball on the half yardline of what should have been a touchdown run.Â 


Â 
Haha, as both a GOT fan and an Eagles fan, that's painful yet very funny. Â 
Â 
Both have the "I got this!" vibe.

Â 
He wasn't to know he would get the opportunity to impale him like that.
Â 
The poison was just insurance incase he only got a chance to nick Gregor.

2311	IlAovatar	2014-06-02	I thought they did a fantastic job with the scene. The ending was as horrific and as shocking as it needed to be, and they succeeded in making Oberyn appear cocky and reckless, but not stupid to the point where you could see his death coming.
2312	eumaies	2014-06-02	Oh gods that was so underwhelming.Â  One of the best scenes the in book done in by inferior casting of Gregor Clegane and a lackluster performance by all involved.
Â 
Nice episode otherwise.Â  Total bummer.

Yeah, i always figured that the poison was a back up plan in case he didn't kill him in the duel.Â
2314	of man and wolf	2014-06-02	My wife was just like good job Oberyn, instead of acting cocky and only fighting for your own gain, you could have gotten your revenge while actually fighting for Tyrion to boot.
Â 
I just laughed because Oberyn got his butt whipped.

.............That statement makes no sense, I and everyone else who read that statement, now have a lower IQ, I can understand if people can make rational argument as to why they disliked the scene, but this, this is beyond words, that was a bad comment and you should feel bad.

I think the comments meaning was that tyrion's look of disappointment was due to the scene being done poorly.  
I thought it could have lasted longer, and the missing person that Gregor split in half would have added some umph to the scene, but all in all it still drove home what I got from the book, Oberyn's flamboyance and arrogance/rage made him make that 1 critical mistake, and it cost him everything.
2317	Seneti	2014-06-02	Â 
Yes, thank you! Where was that endless beetle speech going anyway?Â 


Â 
IMO, it was an analogy on the randomness of death and judgement. Tyrion's cousin never gave any reason as to why those beetles had to die, he just did it. The beetles had never done anything to him and they were in no position to defend himself. Tyrion is the beetle, life is the cousin. It keeps trying to squash him at every opportunity for no good reason (other than "you're a dwarf"). Chances are he will never know why, because the people pulling the strings / holding the rock (Cersei, Tywin, the gods) are either unwilling or too insane to give him an answer.
Â 


Some things I went nuts over--
Â 
Oberyn's "no, no, no..." got across a ton of his character. He wasn't toying with him in the "this is teh funsies!" sense, but doing what he could, what he dreamed of, to not devolve into complete sputtering rage. He wasn't thoughtless--he was glancing down at the Mountain as he railed at Tywin, but he made one wrong move, drifting a bit too close to Gregor's arm, and as Bronn prophecized,that was the end.Â 
Â 
His screams! SHIT MAN! I don't care how much of a badass you are, you're screeching like a nutcase if your eyes are getting gouged out. Death is a leveller.Â 
Â 
Ellaria's scream! Hit me SO much harder than the book version. I KEENED when she looked so proud--earlier she was nervous, but then she was like "you go babe, get your vengeance." Then her horror...fuck!Â 
Â 
Oberyn letting himself get pushed around just a bit, to give him an advantage. It reminded me of that study about people who are a bit sauced having a better chance of surviving a car wreck. He really was like a snake.Â 


Â 
Agreed on all of this. Oh good gods, the screaming... Bye bye, sleep, I shall not be seeing you tonight.
Â 


My eyes...
Â 
Going to have nightmares for days...


Â 
Agreed. I'm still feeling queasy. I don't think any amount of kittens, sugar and pinkie pies is going to get the images of Oberyn's squashed head out of my mind.
2318	andrew_	2014-06-02	I think the comments meaning was that tyrion's look of disappointment was due to the scene being done poorly.
Â 


Exactly, how does that make any sense!? When he was writing that comment didn't he realize that they filmed Tyrions' reaction deliberately? They weren't just filmingÂ  Peter Dinklages' off camera reaction to the performances of Pedro and the Giant (forgot his name) and decided to put it into the actual show? Unless I'm missing some sort of poorly translated sarcasm, I wish I never read that comment, it pains me to think some people are that dimwitted.

Because the poster was being sarcastic, and poking fun at the fight scene. 
Gore factor was a 10, but it didn't impact me like red wedding did, and reading the book version did impact me just as much as book version of the red wedding did.  Honestly, it was good, but not spectacular like The Red Wedding on film was.
2322	Relic	2014-06-02	what. the. fuck. was. that.
2323	Arry Lannister	2014-06-02	I love how Oberyn screamed like a girl, the Mountain should have said "And then I made her scream like a bitch, like this".Â
2324	daggerseiuri	2014-06-02	Just watched The Mountain and the Viper. I knew what would happen. I feel like, oh my god. I didn't think they would do it how it was written. But they did and I feel like I did when Drogo died. Except this was so much more gruesome. Pedro Pascal did an amazing job. If anything was ever translated perfectly from page to film, that fight was it. Wow. I know I'm shockingly optimistic, but I loved this fight. The reaction shots are not the fight. I didn't need them. Idgaf how Tywin feels about the fight. I only care about Oberyn's revenge.
2325	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-06-02	Hrm.Â  Surprised people didn't like this.Â  I thought they did a great job on it.Â  Maybe a bit short, but it's pretty damned close to what I envisioned from the book. :shrug:
2326	andrew_	2014-06-02	I can't say I approve of all those spear twirls before and during the fight, if they wanted to show that Oberyn was a great warrior, they should've had Jaimie and Tyrion talk about how he got his nickname and more about his reputation, but still, the fight was done very well, thank the lord they didn't keep season 2 Gregor, that would've been a travesty. Also love Ellaria screaming as she watched Oberyn die. I would've loved to see Tyrion collapse as he does in the book if I remember correctly. The scene was a solid 8.5/10.
2327	Relic	2014-06-02	Â I would've loved to see Tyrion collapse as he does in the book if I remember correctly. The scene was a solid 8.5/10.


Â 
Â 
In the books he vomits peppered eggs, prepared dornish style. Which i would have preferred to watch over the shit in this episode.Â
2328	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	Personally I don't see the reason for the backlash, I thought it was a great episode.
2329	D-A-C	2014-06-02	Well, all I can say is, I am very, very glad that I was able to read this fight before watching it, that was incredibly disappointing compared to the fight we get in the books.
Â 
I actually now feel really bad for the majority of my friends who haven't read the books and rely solely on the T.V show for advancing the story.
Â 
Well, where to begin? I suppose lets discuss the positives:
Â 
1. Oberyn's Darth Maul Acrobatics - Almost perfect, (there will be a slight complaint about it in the negatives though lol) he nailed his fighting style, Pedro has been an absolute revelation this season, making is early departure even more heart wrenching.
Â 
2. Eye Gouge / Death Scream / Lover's Scream - All were absolutely soul destroying and brutal as it they should be.
Â 
Â 
Now, onto the many negatives:
Â 
1. Lack of build up - As always with this show we spend 80% of the episode in other places doing some very boring exposition and general crap, much of which is starting to deviate badly from the books.
Â 
2. No Emphasis on Poison - I will re-watch it, but my initial impression is that it is going to be hard for people to understand Oberyn had a fight strategy of wearing his opponent down, nicking the weak points of his armour, arguably (my own book interpretation) using Poison to increase the likely hood of gaining a confession in public, implicating Tywin for all to see. I mean, we actually had someone cleaning his spear and I immediately thought 'hey, you'll wipe the poison off idiot!'
Â 
3. Over too quickly / Too Much Cutting - There needed to be more time for The Mountain to become exhausted, to fall because of his many wounds, for the words, the importance, the meaning of this fight to be made fully clear to audience members unfamiliar with the books.
Â 
Also I will agree, that there was too much cutting, and for example, moments when Oberyn caught Claganes knee needed close ups to emphasise 'this is the plan people!' death by 1000 cuts until he gets the confession and also wears him down.
Â 
4. Crushing Oberyns head - In a word awful, and for me actually detracted from the horror of seeing Oberyn die in such a way. The punch was spot on, the eye gouging awful but powerful, but he then should have either smashed his head in by repeatedly slamming it on the ground or with crushing blows from a mailed fist not squeezing it like that which is actually just silly now that I think about it.
Â 
5. Tyrion didn't vomit - Enough said, it needed to happen to both reinforce the disgusting spectacle but also as the 'I'm fucked' moment that he experiences
Â 
6. Audience not getting caught up in thingsÂ  - With all the reaction shots being fired around, you would think this would have been a given. It added such a chaotic element to the fight, why not have it?
Â 
7. Lannister Reactions - This one could be completely on me, and because of how I read all the stuff around this fight, both in the build up AND crucially in the aftermath. But Cersie and Tywin both reacted too happily, too nonchalant about the fact a Prince of Dorne just got obliterated in front of them and that the Mountain sort of confessed publicly. Like I said this criticism is probably a very personal nitpicking one, but there was just somthing about the cut to the stands at the end, and I just felt 'is that it? That's you reaction? A smug sense of satisfaction just didnt seem justified, but again, that could entirely be me and my interpretation.
Â 
8. No Passion - Just to remphasise, using star wars an example, it has often been said the Lightsaber fights in New Hope / Empire Strikes are much better than the dazziling display in Episode 1, 2, 3 because they had such emotional charge behind them. This is another example I think were there needed to be more emotion, more passion, more build up to really raise the stakes. Now don't get me wrong I loved Oberyn's fighting style, but if there had been some added passion, some more emphasis on the emotion of this fight for everyone involved it would have been better.
Â 
Â 
Â 
There are probably a few other negatives, and maybe one positive somewhere when I give the scene a closer look, this post is just my initial 'I have just watched it and want to comment post' lol.
Â 
Overall I am, as I said, in the position of someone who is incredibly disappointed.
Â 
For me the T.V show now is nothing more than a tolerable accompanying piece, but the books will be the real Game of Thrones for me. Everything is more rich, more detailed, and better layed out.
Â 
GRRM doesn't keep things going because the T.V crowd just love Arya and the Hound, wasted trips to crastors keep because the audience needs 'action' or will fall asleep, doesn't have to follow this ridiculous 'wait till episode 9 for big battles policy' or play about with constant meeting chances between Starks and he can take as many pages as he likes to set thinks up and then follow them through to their completion.
Â 
For such a pivotal moment I think this one has to go down as a complete f*ck up by the T.V producers, directors etc.
Â 
However, well done Pedro Pascal, you were phenomenal!!! Its just a shame the converting of the source material didn't give you as much to work with as it should have, but fuck me did you nail it anyway! Pedro is now officially who I will be picturing Oberyn as during my re-reads of the series.
Â 
Overall though I am completely disappointed by tonights weak effort, not just with the fight itself, but with the decisions made about what stories to include and advance all with it. It was poorly paced, poorly done ... do you guys get that I didn't like it by now  ?
2330	KalibakCruel	2014-06-02	The books being better than the filmed version? Well that's just unheard of.
2331	Kungsmurfen	2014-06-02	I can't say I approve of all those spear twirls before and during the fight, if they wanted to show that Oberyn was a great warrior, they should've had Jaimie and Tyrion talk about how he got his nickname and more about his reputation, but still, the fight was done very well, thank the lord they didn't keep season 2 Gregor, that would've been a travesty.

Â 
I didn't have anything against the spear twirls but I really wanted them to speak of how Oberyn got his nicknameÂ  
Â 


4. Crushing Oberyns head - In a word awful, and for me actually detracted from the horror of seeing Oberyn die in such a way. The punch was spot on, the eye gouging awful but powerful, but he then should have either smashed his head in by repeatedly slamming it on the ground or with crushing blows from a mailed fist not squeezing it like that which is actually just silly


Â 
  That's probably my only problem with the fight.

He did smash his head on the ground, he was squeezing Oberyn's head and he said 'then I smashed her head in like this' and boom he slammed it down on the ground.
Â 
Edit: Actually now that I watch it on YT he didn't slam it he just pressed on his head.

2333	clawson24	2014-06-02	Didn't dig the Mountain's "WWE-esque" turnaround. Went from seemingly playing dead/not reacting in any way to tripping Oberyn and taking the upper hand instantaneously. Would've preferred to see him struggling to get back up or something.
Â 
Also, the fight didn't last long enough to look like Oberyn wore Gregor down. He basically just flat out beat him with a couple stabs and a spear slash to the ankle/achilles. His victory seemed easier on the show than in the books where it's clear that one little slip and Oberyn's toast. In the show Gregor looked like a somewhat uncoordinated oaf who just happened to be massive.
2334	Envie	2014-06-02	Even though I knew it was coming and even told myself I would not watch the end - I did, and I'm still in shock. I can only imagine what non-book readers must have felt at that moment.
Â 
I really don't see how (yet. maybe tomorrow) people can be so casually nitpicking away at the scene's every tiny detail as if they're putting up white cards that say 6.5, 5.5, 7.0 and remarking on a missed double axle at an ice skating competition. You guys are cold to the core haha.
Â 
But for me, it was one of the most powerful moments in the book and I cried through it long before I read the gruesome ending for Oberyn. I was crying for Elia and tonight I cried again. I don't know why this one gets me so much but I wish I could thank Pedro for bringing it to life as George wrote it. The emotion and desire to avenge her and her children was there. And it ends as sadly as the rest. Pointless but powerful.
Â
2335	Rhaquentis	2014-06-02	Epicness. It was a bit short, but still amazing.Â
2336	Titan	2014-06-02	The pacing of cuts tears the content to pieces, is the thing. You can't treat a guy with a two meter sword and another with an 8 foot spear as if they're punching one another -- room is needed for the weapons. And yes, while I hate the wushu acrobatics as a concept for Dornish fighting, in practice it was terrible for the fight because all of those stunts were from a stunt double, meaning they had to resort to various techniques to hide it -- like those crane shots way up in the air that basically just pull you way out so you can't see much of anything.
Â 
Bad decisions lead to poor content, basically.
Â 
I'll do a proper count tomorrow, as prep for our video review.

Wonderful. (Irony alert) And entirely predictable, Ran. You've clearly built up this moment in the book and expected it to be like the Rob Roy duels for YEARS in your head. This seems perfectly clear based on your endless tweets and postings here with links to the Rob Roy duel over the last two weeks.
That the show fails to live up to that is not the show's fault. It is yours.
And the idea that you will do a proper "cut count" is to prove how un-Rob-Roy this duel is just so endlessly predictable. But go ahead.
-----------
For me this duel was extremely satisfying, and visceral on a level I have never seen. It definitely lived up to my expectation after reading the book. But that is just my take.

Â 
If your not being sarcastic I apologize, but if I am right in interpretating you that way:
Â 
http://www.totalfilm...nie-brasco-1997
Â 
There are plenty of examples of films exceeding the source material. So giving the director, etc a pass because the books will 'always be better and deeper' isn't a valid excuse.
Â 
In my own experiennce my viewing of Shawshank Redemption is a perfect example, I watched the film, then read the book and wnt, 'damn, that was a million times better on screen' 
Â 
However if you weren't being sarcastic, once again, I do apologize.
Â

Â 
He doesn't actually, and if that's what we are supposed to get, then the directors are really messing up how we are supposed to view things alot this season (cersie rape anyone?).
Â 
My interpretation was he has both his fingers gouging his eyes and then squeezed his skull between his hands till it popped in a ridiculous way.

No worries i was mostly just joking with my sarcasm. But yeah it's rare that film surpasses the source material, even rarer even the source material is as well written as asoiaf.

Yeah I edited to that effect.
2340	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-02	They basically did the fight as I expected, but it seemed to come off as less intense than I had hoped.
Â 
Ditch the spear twirling, I agree.
More reaction from the audience - especially Lannisters - would have been nice. These are high stakes. Cersei wants Tywion to die; Tyrion wants to live; and Tywin does not want Gregor confessing about who ordered Elia & her children to be killed.
A longer fight would have been nice, more emphasis on the fact that by the middle Gregor was frustrated and enraged, and then at the end, in agony.
Okay, so he crushed his head instead of punching it with an armoured fist, but I can live with that. Â 
Â 
On a positive note, we got to hear "I'm going to kill that.", and see Oberyn run Gregor through with the spear.
2341	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-02	Just to comment on the Rob Roy comparisons, it's a very different scene. The first big "WTF!" is the clothes-obsessed fop being a murder monkey, then it's the lack of any Hollywood sword banter. Awesome, but notable for it's lack of dialogue and staccato pacing. I don't think it would've worked....Oberyn going from Princess Bride to Rob Roy...
Â 
In the moment, my two quibbles were the odd slowness (and positioning) of slicing the Mountain's calf...total nitpick but kind of weird, and juicing his face. Teeth skittering, AWESOME! Squeezing was a wee bit too X-men for me. But, la, I still squealed when we saw his ruined face and Tyrion's perfect "WTF" expression.

2342	Red Raven	2014-06-02	The editing was pretty crappy. Â Not impressed with this episode. Â 
Â 
Did Pedro have a stunt double? Â He trained pretty hard for the fight, taking lessons from a wu-shu master and practicing the choreography for weeks and weeks.
2343	Stonering	2014-06-02	I was sorely disappointed in the fight choreography - it should have been longer and given us a sense of the progression of the duel. Â The producers succumbed to flashy cuts, overhead shots (due to the double), lots of corny twirls etc. Â Cuts are fine if they are used to cut in quickly to a significant bit of movement, but this didn't happen. Â We didn't get to see the Mountain being worn down, didn't even get to see that he really should have been too close to death to do anything. Â Someone said they saw a squire putting something on Oberyn's spear, but I didn't catch that and I wonder how many did. Â We really should know there was poison on the spear. Â 
Â 
The long scene between Jamie and Tyrion was not that elucidating and should have been cut to give more time to the fight and the build up to it. Â All in all, a disappointing end of the episode. Â Hope the battle at the Wall next week is much, much better. Â
2344	Relic	2014-06-02	Well, all I can say is, I am very, very glad that I was able to read this fight before watching it, that was incredibly disappointing compared to the fight we get in the books.

However, well done Pedro Pascal, you were phenomenal!!! Its just a shame the converting of the source material didn't give you as much to work with as it should have, but fuck me did you nail it anyway! Pedro is now officially who I will be picturing Oberyn as during my re-reads of the series.
Â 
Overall though I am completely disappointed by tonights weak effort, not just with the fight itself, but with the decisions made about what stories to include and advance all with it. It was poorly paced, poorly done ... do you guys get that I didn't like it by now  ?

Totally agree. Especially about the Darth Maul spear twirling. Same exact reaction I had. Honestly, in an episode devoted to filler,they reeeeallllly could have spent an extra 3 minutes building tension and showing tactics in a fight that pitted two of Westeros's biggest badasses against one another. OK so they ditched the Viper's shield, I figured they were going to do that because the viewers with a.d.d. wouldn't like it. But the subtle aspects of OM's approach to beating the Mountain were completely cast aside in favor of cheap theatrics. It looked sort of cool, I s'pose, but took away from any cerebral approach the Viper might have had. 
Par for the course tho, sadly.
2345	D-A-C	2014-06-02	I was sorely disappointed in the fight choreography - it should have been longer and given us a sense of the progression of the duel. Â The producers succumbed to flashy cuts, overhead shots (due to the double), lots of corny twirls etc. Â Cuts are fine if they are used to cut in quickly to a significant bit of movement, but this didn't happen. Â We didn't get to see the Mountain being worn down, didn't even get to see that he really should have been too close to death to do anything. Â Someone said they saw a squire putting something on Oberyn's spear, but I didn't catch that and I wonder how many did. Â We really should know there was poison on the spear. Â 
Â 
The long scene between Jamie and Tyrion was not that elucidating and should have been cut to give more time to the fight and the build up to it. Â All in all, a disappointing end of the episode. Â Hope the battle at the Wall next week is much, much better. Â 


Â 
Yes there is someone wiping down his spear.
Â 
But that actually had the opposite effect for me. It TOOK AWAY from the fact that there was poison on the spear, and I am not sure those unfamaliar with the books will realise that was happening.
Â 
Besides, who the hell entrusts a squire coat your weapon with a poison that is beyond awful (Tywin's possible poison aside lol) in a fight of such importance for the character, it's his vengence for his sister afterall. I think the show de-emphasised this guy was a master of poisons, and the fight scene did nothing to help explain that.
Â 
Even the hits with spear on The Moutain, were brutal and seemed more piercing, not cuts, scratches and scrapes designed to inflict poison on the opponent.
Â 
At least thats my interpretation.
2346	gvewolf243	2014-06-02	It was good, but i still was kinda dissapointed in fight. It seemed to come off less intense than i had hoped, plus lack of some details, like no emphasis on poison, Tyrion didn't vomit and etc. Still Pedro was great as Oberyn and i've gonna miss him.

2348	Arrowtic	2014-06-02	Awesome . 9.5/10
The only problem was that whole Grey Worm part and The Beetle(kuh kuh kuh)
Really can't believe those who are giving The Duel part 6,7 . Did you even watch it ?! What else did you want ?
You raped her : CHECK
I'm going to kill that : CHECK
Mountain's Confession : CHECK
Some dead man : CHECK
Eye gouging : CHECK
Worst death ever : CHECK
So practically one little difference and it sucks ?
Remember that it's TV . There are also other things to care about besides books . Remember that the most of viewers are Unsullieds .

How about the editing being very clunky and having nearly no music at all?

Ok now , first of all , all those problems don't make it a disaster as some are calling it .
I'm not an expert in whole editing part so I'm not gonna comment , you might be right or wrong i dunno , I(as an inexperienced viewer/reader) enjoyed it .
The lack of music imo was in order to maintain its reality and reserve the ending's violence . I myself would've been way less worried if there had been an epic music . Yes it would've made it more epic but also less real . As far as I remember RW didn't have that big of a music either . Even at the credits it was also complete silence .

The Red Wedding is a good comparison. "The Lannisters Send Their Regards" is one of my favorite pieces of music of the season 3 soundtrack. It didn't last for that long, but it captured the betrayal perfectly. Here it didn't feel like a fight to the death, but a tourney. For example they had some cool music playing in the background during the Jaime vs Ned and Sandor vs Gregor fight scenes in season 1.
2353	Pilusmagnus	2014-06-02	How about the editing being very clunky and having nearly no music at all?


The absence of music is absolutely crucial in order to maintain the tension. If there had been an epic music, we would have guessed that Oberyn was going to win. Had there been a dramatic music, it would have been the contrary.
Keep in mind that most viewers are Unsullied, so they need to focus on guessing who is actually going to win that fight. With no music, they can entirely pay attention to both character's strengths and weaknesses. When Oberyn is pushed to the ground but rises again, you really feel how dangerous the Mountain is, because you don't have music to tell you "This is bad". You just see it by yourself and the tension is much more efficient this way.
With music on, the fight would have been way too cartoonesque.

I'm not saying there should have been epic music, I'm saying that there should have been some subtle music in the background.
2355	Batman	2014-06-02	Besides Oberyns death it was pretty disappointing. Gregor's helmet was deflating for some reason. It looked ridiculous, the vulnerable parts were wide open and it fell right off.Â
2356	binga	2014-06-02	The actual choreography and philosophy behind the fight was good and accurate to the books but the filming of it felt a bit rushed. Should have gotten to see more and savor the fight. All in all it was good, it didn't live up to my expectations though. This Mountain to me never felt like the Mountain, he was just some big dude.

Not really -- in the books, the duel is very suspenseful -- the crowd keeps edging up to get a better view, even though the duel is between a guy swing a 2H sword one handed and a guy using a spear, and Gregor actually kills one of the bystanders. Â Oberyn actually uses a shiny shield, and uses it to blind the mountain. Â Both of these things, if they had been included, could have stretched to duel out,
Â 
Basically, when you name your episode after a fight, it should take a while (maybe even cut some scenes into it). Â It shouldn't have felt as rushed as it did.
2359	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-02	Some things I went nuts over--
Â 
Oberyn's "no, no, no..." got across a ton of his character. He wasn't toying with him in the "this is teh funsies!" sense, but doing what he could, what he dreamed of, to not devolve into complete sputtering rage. He wasn't thoughtless--he was glancing down at the Mountain as he railed at Tywin, but he made one wrong move, drifting a bit too close to Gregor's arm, and as Bronn prophecized,that was the end.Â 
Â 
His screams! SHIT MAN! I don't care how much of a badass you are, you're screeching like a nutcase if your eyes are getting gouged out. Death is a leveller.Â 
Â 
Ellaria's scream! Hit me SO much harder than the book version. I KEENED when she looked so proud--earlier she was nervous, but then she was like "you go babe, get your vengeance." Then her horror...fuck!Â 
Â 
Oberyn letting himself get pushed around just a bit, to give him an advantage. It reminded me of that study about people who are a bit sauced having a better chance of surviving a car wreck. He really was like a snake.Â 


Â 
Again, totally get why he screamed in the show- I don't think anyone who could actually feel pain or was still conscious wouldn't scream. I'm just comparing the scenario to the books here, which I think was better done. I got the point that Oberyn dropped the ball, paid for it dearly, revenge blinded him, all that. But, comparing it to the book, leads me to this.
Â 


I love how Oberyn screamed like a girl, the Mountain should have said "And then I made her scream like a bitch, like this".Â 


Â At no point in the books did I think, or think anyone else would think "wow, Oberyn died like a screaming little bitch", that's all.
Â 
Again, not so much dissapointed because I thought,"aww man he screamed like a pussy", but I know that idea would get into a lot of other peoples heads. From experience, knowing dudes who think they'd handle having their skull crushed like Thich Quang Duch when he burned in Saigon: unflinching, and silent as a rock- because, you know, they're real men. I dunno, it's a tiny nit-pick. He died pretty gruesomely in both cases, anyways. I just don't feel the phrase "like a bitch" should be associated with Oberyn, at all. He's not Vegeta. He's Inigo Montoya.
Â 
I still don't think they should have had him getting knocked down so much, or having his first spear broken like that. I really do think it ruined the build-up. Like, all right, this guy has had a few close calls already, not really convinced he'll walk out unscathed- where as compared to the books, he owns it right up until he doesn't.
2360	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-02	Not really -- in the books, the duel is very suspenseful -- the crowd keeps edging up to get a better view, even though the duel is between a guy swing a 2H sword one handed and a guy using a spear, and Gregor actually kills one of the bystanders.

And all of that! Really thought it'd get at least the last 15 minutes from the first "Have they told you who I am" to Gregor squeezing open a packet of Oberyn's Grade A Skull Ketchup

2361	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	It was good, it just needed to be longer, and have more setup. The poison will be mentioned in ep 10, pretty sure. also i feel like they made it out that the mountain was an easy person to fight.
Â 
Also i think it would've been better if they had he original mountain from season 1. Also i would have enjoyed a close up of the mountains face as he was confessing..but i guess they didn't really employ a professional actor, they went for size. Probably their biggest downfall because i felt the audience didn't even know who he was...my brother didn't even remember who he was. They needed to give more screentime to developing who the mountain really was, he's savageness and cruelty. but they stuffed that up by changing the actors every season.
2362	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-06-02	The editing was bad (too many fast cuts), and I felt like it should have been a bit longer (especially considering the fight was shorter than the awful beetle monologue), but other than that, it was perfect. From Pedro's delivery of Oberyn's chant to the Mountain's brutal finisher and the reactions that followed.
2363	Skinnyman	2014-06-02	I'm such a masoquist, yearned two weeks (Oberyn's appearance turned my hype back on) to get my heart crushed like this. I watched the episode an hour ago and I'm still mopey. That scream was horrible, so painful to hear and look at.
2364	Ran	2014-06-02	Just to comment on the Rob Roy comparisons, it's a very different scene. The first big "WTF!" is the clothes-obsessed fop being a murder monkey.That's already been established in the prior 2 hours of the film, however.Â then it's the lack of any Hollywood sword banter. Awesome, but notable for it's lack of dialogue and staccato pacing. I don't think it would've worked....Oberyn going from Princess Bride to Rob Roy...The dialog is all the reason more for why it should have been stretched out rather than rushed. I'm not saying it needs the leisurely pacing and cutting of the Rob Roy fight, which does indeed increase its tension by short bursts of violence (but bursts that you can clearly understand) with tense stares and maneuvering around. But it's less than half the length and has three times as many cuts per second -- that's insanity. Something more like the Hector-Achilles fight -- itself about a minute longer, with a number of crowd reaction shots, but with half as many total cuts despite this! -- would have been much more appropriate.To some degree I think it's all down to two major choreography errors:Wushu acrobatics necessitating stunt doubling. Besides its particular pacing, the real beauty of the Rob Roy scene is that almost all -- perhaps all -- the scenes are the actors themselves; this is all the more remarkable because Archibald Cunningham looks like a "murder monkey", and that's all Tim Roth, who had no stage fighting experience at all. That's a testament to the vision of William Hobbs, who tailored the scene to get the maximum effect out of the actors, and to director Michael Caton-Jones in judging that the more they can sell Roth as a dangerous swordsman when compared to the tall, strapping Liam Neeson, the better. There's too many crane shots to hide the fact that we're looking at the double, but you can tell really -- he's leaner than Pascal is -- and that breaks the reality of the vision of the person you're watching actually being that dangerous.The other issue is that the one-handed sword swings from Gregor sap a lot of the tension out of his attacks. They're not credibly dangerous, and it's worth considering that almost every "dangerous" blow he does in the fight is just his using his strength to throw or kick Oberyn around. The weapon's almost a non-factor because the insistence on sticking to one-handed swings was just wrong. And the thing is, they even acknowledge that the weapon -- a lighter-than-reality prop weapon! -- is too large to be effectively swung around by the world's third strongest man in the post-episode behind-the-scenes video. So why do it? It doesn't even make particular sense since I'm certain that if Gregor Clegane had to fight without a shield, he'd use that sword with both hands. A couple of times to emphasize how strong he is, fine, but it's almost all the time, and every time he does it there's no real feeling of threat to Oberyn.Tailor the scene to the actors, and the cutting wouldn't have to be so insanely fast. Some of that cutting, I assure you, was just to "speed up" the action by cutting out some of the ponderousness of BjA¶rnsson's blows. That's not his fault, that's the fault of the choreographer, the director, and the producers.Better choreography would have led to less cutting, which would have given the movement and space of the fight more impact, and would have allowed Pascal and BjA¶rnsson to be more "present". As it is, so much was blink-and-you'll miss it.ETA:Here's my preliminary calculation of the fight's cutting, using techniques discussed on Cinemetrics, a site for study of film through the lens of cutting technique and cinematography.Total fight length: 107 secondsTotal cuts: 124Average shot length: 0.86587 secondsMedian shot length: 0.765 secondsShortest cut: 0.250 secondsBy way of comparison, here's Rob Roy's final duel:Total fight length: 276 secondsTotal cuts: ~101 cutsASL: 2.732And the final fight between Hector and Achilles in Troy:Total fight length: 166 secondsTotal cuts: ~117ASL: 1.41And from the video I link below, here's a 60 second fight from The Bourne Identity:Total fight length: 60 secondsTotal cuts: 62 cutsASL: .95 secondsShortest cut: .40 secondsAnd the first fight from Hero (where there's a lot of stunt and wire work, admittedly... but it's actually Jet Li and Donnie Yen doing them, because that's just how they roll):Total fight length: 60 secondsTotal cuts: 22ASL: 2.6 secondsShortest cut: .80 secondsIt's the fastest fight cutting I can find via Cinemetrics, and it's apparently faster than the very rapid cutting of one of the Bourne Identity one-on-one fight scenes, according to this. I'm guessing -- but haven't yet gone through with an eye towards this -- that the fight also has a very heavy reliance on close ups, which deemphasizes the particular mechanics of the fight with longer-than-normal weapons.(I know, this is among the nerdiest things I've ever done in discussing the show, but honestly, it feels like some actual empirical data is needed to fully explain why the cutting is bugging me so much; it's symptomatic of poor choices the production made.)

2365	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-06-02	Oh come on people! The fight was awesome. Of course we wish it could've gone on longer, but it's TV, they have limited time. Though, yeah. They should've cut the "beetle" monologue. It was interesting I guess, but did it serve any true purpose?
Â 
The editing was fine. I could understand well enough what was going on. Also, the absense of music made more intense and intimate. It felt more realistic too, because IIRC in the book the Mountain keeps getting his ass kicked by Oberyn. In the episode Gregor gets a few shots at him actually. So the fight was good.
Â 
And there's the ending... Fuck me, that was brutal. That screaming was just haunting.
2366	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-02	That's already been established in the prior 2 hours of the film, however.

I remember commenting about this when they first had the railers coming out for the season. I cited Gregor's "Spaghetti Arm Swings" and I'm glad that you now bring that back up, but it's such a cinema fight scene thing, blows that would literally have no real impact in real life being portrayed as crippling attacks when they connect. Some of his movements really did rob him of the ferocity you would expect, but I also think that it was all rectified by the money shot, for most. Crush.
2367	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-02	By the way, though. For the record- I really did love the fight for the most part. Despite all I've said, but like always, I analyze it to death. I'll have to watch it again, but I can't hear that scream again right now. So brutal.
2368	Red Tiger	2014-06-02	I just feel that the whole ''headsquashing, poking eyes out'' thing at the end was so over the top, jeez. I don't know, the duel was fine but that just annoyed me for some reason.


Keep in mind that in the books Gregor cuts off Vargo Hoat's limbs and feeds them to him, one by one. Over the top killings are what the MOuntain does.
Â 
I also find it ridiculous that people actually nitpick about Oberyn screaming, I don't care how badass you are if somebody is caving in your skull while gouging in your eyes, you WILL scream. Else you simply have a physiological disorder.

2369	hollowcrown	2014-06-02	My only nitpick about the duel was Tyrion's reaction - he should've thrown up like he does in the bookÂ 
1. For Oberyn's horrible death
2. For the fact he's now going to die. That's his last hope gone.
2370	Ran	2014-06-02	but I also think that it was all rectified by the money shot, for most. Crush.You may well be right. As I cite in my review, kind of like in The Rains of Castamere, the show's taken something that could be filled with atmosphere and mounting tension and instead has focused on the big shocking turn or twist. It seemed to work well for many, but for my part I've always been a viewer (and reader) who's more about the journey than the end destination.ETA: And since we're on another page -- or at least I am -- I added some actual numbers to this post to give some comparisons regarding fight editing. Should probably go and link the relevant videos as well, I suppose...

2371	Finch	2014-06-02	The fight was absolutely fantastic, one of the most intense thing's i have seen for years. Visual effects in this scene were absolutely amazing. I haven't read the books, but i believe that this was almost identical to what happened in the books? Although tyrion was supposed to throw up after the fight?Â

Again, I'm not saying that he shouldn't have screamed while dying the way he did in the show, anyone would have, no matter how "tough". I'm just saying I preferred his death in the books because it didn't even make that a discussion. I don't think Oberyn died like a wimp, even with how it played out in the show. I just knew the "like a bitch" comment would be made as soon as I saw it happen, and it was.
Â 
I just feel the need to clarify that because I keep seeing that defense posted right after I bring it up.

I agree with you completely. And that is an incredibly in-depth analysis, I commend you for putting in the time. Certainly the Wushu necessitated that.
2373	Sigrunn	2014-06-02	I'd say that my expectations were too high. If not for the end, it would have looked like sparring.
2374	LordStoneheart	2014-06-02	Can I both like and dislike it? I like that option... and poor Ellaria... I just don't even know what to say about that.
2375	Ran	2014-06-02	Given the huge hyping this episode got -- from producers, from actors, from HBO, from the media -- and that the fight lends its title to the episode, I don't think your expectations were "too high". They set a very high bar for what they were going to provide.
2376	Wade of House Wilson	2014-06-02	I do think we'll see more about the poison next week. I can only imagine that's why they had Sandor mention that poison is a woman's weapon and then Arya's scoffing reaction. Â
2377	Ran	2014-06-02	Next week is entirely focused on the Wall.Given that we had Qyburn around for a couple of episodes, I do suspect they're going to keep Gregor around, though.
2378	Brienne the Wench	2014-06-02	Regardless of what happened at the end of the fight, can we just take a second to really appreciate the fact that this thin little man single-handedly took down THE MOUNTAIN?! Â I mean, everyone thought it was practically impossible to beat the guy! Â But the Red Viper of Dorne seemed to manage just fine... if he had made that final stroke! Â I understand what he was trying to do, but that didn't stop me from wanting to yell at the screen: "FINISH HIM! Â FINISH HIIIIIM!!!!" Â 
Â 
Even knowing what was going to happen, I was still frozen with shock and pain! Â Oh, the horror. Â I thought it played out really well! Â I was afraid they would make a lot of changes, but I really thought it all turned out the way it was supposed to... RIP Prince Oberyn Â :-( Â Paving the way for some Sand Snake rage!
2379	voodooqueen126	2014-06-02	I thought the duel was actually pretty fantastic. Brutal. Disgusting. and so glad they kept the book dialogue.
But that beetle speech was bloody infuriating: the Dornish breakfast would've been a good opportunity to set up Arianne, the Sandsnakes etc for next season.
2380	Ran	2014-06-02	I'm quite baffled by the failure to have the Oberyn and Tyrion scene, I admit, especially given the decision to take the story into Dorne. As it is, they could have had it and still had everything else -- even that bloody beetle scene -- because it's another quite short episode.
2381	Finch	2014-06-02	Maybe if the media didn't hype it so much it might have been appreciated more, saying it's going to be the best fight scene was completely wrong. They set expectations that proved impossible to live up to, Although i must say i was very impressed  Oberyn was one of my favorite characters, i'm just scared after the 7 series he wont be remembered as the great character he was :cÂ 
Â 
That picture of Lena Headey with her fingers in Pedro Pascal's eyes proved to be a huge spoiler in the end...
2382	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-02	R.I.P Oberyn Martell
2383	D-A-C	2014-06-02	Regardless of how you think the scene played out, can we all (or as close to a majority as possible) agree that an episode entitled The Mountain and The Viper that contains roughly about 6.30 minutes of screen time out of 51 minutes that is actually dedicated to the duel by both men (Viper/Mountain) is largely pathetic?
Â 
In fact the time for the two of them is alot less than that, that is just from the moment Tyrion is led out after the beetle speech till the credits.
Â 
Prior to that, at no point did we go to Kings Landing, get any discussions about what all the other characters involved are thinking, Tywin, Cersie, even bystanders like the Martells, none of them.
Â 
The choices for which other stories were included in this episode were actually pathetic when you think about it. Sam blubbering, Gilly talking trash to a whore then a crappy raid, the banishing of Jorah, Moat Carlin's Fall, The Hound and Arya (gotta have them every chance don't we?) Sansa and Littlefinger, that ridiculous Grey Worm love story thing, a Tyrion talky emotional scene (gotta have those cuz fan's love Tyrion!) .... basically 45 minutes of stories that either shouldn't be told or should be told elsewhere and in some cases in better detail.
Â 
So we are left with 6/7ish minutes for one of the major scenes people have been anticipating.
Â 
Well thank goodness episode 9 is coming up, because it has been randomly frickin decided that episode 9 always has to be big, god forbid the pacing of the story would necessitate 9 isn't some large set piece ... sigh.

2384	Pallantides	2014-06-02	I will admit, with how much the series had deviated from the books in a lot of instances, this is one scene where I secretly had hopes that they would deviate drastically and have Oberyn live (not sure how that would change the rest of the series), but that was entirely because I quite like what Pedro Pascal did with the character. I felt he stole every scene he was in. It'll be a shame to see him go, because he truly has some on scree charisma. Hopefully he'll get a lot of prominent roles following this.
For the most part in regards to the duel, I agree with Ran's analysis. A cut more in the realm of Troy (which was incidentally written by David Benioff), would have perhaps suited the fight more. Even just the way Achilles fought in the movie I think would have suited Oberyn's fighting style more than Wushu.
I'd probably give the fight a 7.5 simply because it was exciting to watch (and it's the scene I have been anticipating the most ever since the t.v. series was announced), but there were some small aspects of it that could have just made it so much better and given it those 2 and a half points.Â

Â 
I definitely agree about the time - I for one was waiting the ENTIRE episode to see King's Landing. Â I knew it was gonna be the last scene, I just didn't think it would be such a short time that we were there! Â I wish the fight scene had been longer, and I definitely wish we had spent more time with the KL characters in this episode - all of the other stuff felt so trivial because we were waiting anxiously for the DUEL! Â 
Â 
I still think the scene made it's point- sure it could have been longer, but hey, nothing is perfect! Â It did shock and awe and break your heart (just like the book), and it contained all of the things it needed - Oberyn ended up where he was meant to be, and I was so happy they didn't change that scene too much! Â I was worried they would take out what he was saying, or change the exact manner of his death, but they managed to stay pretty close. Â However short it was, it made it's mark on people - they won't soon be forgetting just how Oberyn Martell met his untimely end at the hands (literally) of Ser Gregor Clegane. Â I honestly feel that the fact that Oberyn kicked so much a** made up for it! Â The fact that he could take down The Mountain (I swear, he's half-giant) is INSANE!
Â 
And yes! Â Episode 9! Â Well, there is something pretty huge that should be happening in the next episode - or more probably, the one after. Â I'm thinking the next episode will be the wildling attack on the wall, and not focus on anything really big elsewhere until the final episode of the season. Â This season, though, hasn't followed the regular pattern - Joffrey's wedding broke the mold! Â That was something huge that happened at the beginning of the season, and then Oberyn in Ep. 8 - I'm thinking the next huge moment comes in Episode 10 of this season.

Wtf were they thinking with the whole episode...How many book plot lines were turned into contrivances...at least four by my count
2390	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-02	That was fucking awesome. Justice done to a fantastic scene. 10/10
2391	Roose Seal	2014-06-02	Fight was extremely underwhelming considering how much time was wasted in this episode, wow. What the fuck was that beetle monologue? Who wrote that shit?
Cut that fucking monologue, cut Grey Worm and Missandei (what???) cut Arya and the Hound, cut Gilly, and use those 15-20 minutes to:
1. Build up the trial. Have people talk about Oberyn's skills. Have people talk about the Mountain. Have Oberyn and Ellaria share a long scene (not in a brothel).Â 
2.spend more time on the actual fight. Show more reactions from the audience. Less of that stupid ass Hollywood jumping around. Show Gregor being worn down by Oberyn. Show Oberyn growing more and more angry.
3. Make longer shots. Start the fight with long shots, and accelerate the rhythm as the fight progresses.
Â 
Reminded me of the RW: it's amazing to me that they consistently screw up the tension in the best scenes because of poor editing and poor directing.
Oberyn Martell has been compared to Inigo Montoya time and time again, but compare the two fight scenes: even without all the theatricals and darth maul jumping around and the gore, Inigo vs Six Fingered man was MUCH more suspenseful and effective.

What's wrong with complaining about the editing? It's just as valid a point as the quality of the acting, writing, directing, etc. Just cause you love the scene doesn't mean others can't have legitimate gripes with it. I will say this though; it wasn't as terribly edited as the Red Wedding, although it comes close.

2394	Ran	2014-06-02	LordStoneheart,That scene is about Tyrion's powerlessness to change his fate -- his mind turns, morbidly, to the meaningless of the deaths of all those beetles, or rather the fact that he couldn't find a reason to explain it. He was powerless then, he's powerless now.It's a short episode. I think the scene is very badly placed where it is. Had I my druthers, I'd have pulled that scene back to somewhere before the Moat Cailin scene. Have that reflect the meaningless, reasonless brutality of Ramsay, while conveying Tyrion's own lack of agency. And then tack on four minutes before the fight for more Oberyn-Tyrion interaction, to set up the next season, to subtly get viewers into the mindset that Oberyn is going to win (because why else make these awesome plans?) rather than his dead giveaway of "Not in this life".I would not have minded a couple of minutes with Jaime/Cersei/Tywin in which Jaime notes the Viper might win, and Tywin and Cersei make it plain that even if he does, Tyrion's going to be person non grata, run out of King's Landing and shoved away where he won't ever be a bother or embarrassment again. Or maybe have that be a part of the Jaime-Tyrion cell scene, when the aftermath of Oberyn's possible victory is discussed and Tyrion and Jaime articulate the fact that his relationship with the main powers of the family is hostile and he'll never be able to live in harmony with them.Which would also help sell the fact that Oberyn then offers an alternative, in going to Dorne, in maybe discussing things related to Cersei and Tywin and the rule of the realm...I don't know. Just spitballing.
2395	LordStoneheart	2014-06-02	@Greg Banks (what you did there, I see it...) I know there were a lot of deviations but some at least appeared to advance things like Sansa. I didn't much care for Missandei and Grey Worm moments but it at least fleshed out characters that kind of need it. But Jaime and Tyrion spending five minutes to basically make fun of an apparently handicapped Lannister added nothing we needed to know more about them. We know Tyrion is smart. we know Jaime is... related to Tyrion. There wasn't much in that conversation for Jaime, now that I think about it. But still, if there's one thing I would single out as 100% superfluous, it would be the beetle scene. Not bad acting, justÂ bad writing.
2396	Mia B.	2014-06-02	What I loved besides Oberyn and the Mountain in the duel was Cersei's presence. She didn't have to say anything or do anything while the duel was occurring but it was strong..
Â 
They had a whole season of fillers and I wish they had used Pedro more to elaborate on Dorne since it will become a huge part of the show in the coming seasons. LOVED Pedro!!Â

It's almost a little better now with the meaningless death aspect... but, still, way too long and out of place. And you would be awesome writing some episodes. At least we have Elyo Grivas.

The episode title wasn't just about Oberyn. A viper is a relatively famous symbol of betrayal (farmer and the viper story). We have Littlefinger in the Vale, we have Theon betraying the Ironborn's trust at the mountainous Moat Caitlin,Â  we have Jorah's betrayal of Dany (notice how Meereen is built on a mountainous rock) and then we have the actual Mountain and the Viper.

2403	voodooqueen126	2014-06-02	yeah. I got the point of the beetle speech (that life is meaningless and cruel) and also that that Cousin Orson the beetle squasher symbolised Gregor: why does Gregor rape and murder peasants, rape&murder Elia Martell, probably killed his sister and father, set his little brother on fire, rape one of Jonos Bracken's daughters, etc... Gregor just does these abhorrent things because he can. He is like a slightly brighter vesion of cousin Orson the beetle crusher.
Nevertheless, I would've preferred a discussion with Tywin and Cersei, and the Dornish breakfast of hot scrambled eggs, exposition and a dash of foreshadowing.

Nope. I'm not sure where I said that?!
I just find it funny. 
I watched the scene and was genuinely pretty amazed at how well they did it. The dialogue was all there which I didn't expect. I was genuinely "fuck yeah" when they did the death properly. 
Then I came here to say that and just read endless "ah but the editing..." Comments and I thought to my self "yep, this is Westeros.org"
And I laughed a merry laugh.
2407	Ran	2014-06-02	BjA¶rnsson was dubbed. I think it may have been the same voice actor who dubbed Ian Whyte's Gregor in season 2. BjA¶rnsson has a very heavy Icelandic accent, so no surprise they'd go the dubbing route.

Not at all mate. I just find it amusing that people still watch the show, when the only result of doing so is 7 days none stop complaining online about it. 
I love the books. I love the show. I love this website. 
Btw, I think Ran mentioned Rob Roy earlier in the tread. I love that film. I love the fighting. It's so... Realistic I guess. Great film.

Â 
But the problems some people have with the editing are legitimate and have reasonable arguments behind them. There wereÂ too many quick-cuts. The scene lacked a certain feel of urgency and intensity that other fights have had (like Sandor vs Beric, and even the fight at the inn at the start of this season). I get what they were trying to go for with the lack of music (to make it "realistic" or whatever). That works in some scenes (the inn fight in 4x1), but when it's a scene with such an epic build-up and the stakes are so high, and this is the culmination and climax of an entire storyarc, I think we really did need to hear some fitting music. Not generic shitty music like during the Red Wedding, but really thrilling and intense music. I also feel like the ending should have been more abrupt and to the point. Instead we got a slow-down in pace and shock, to hear Tywin's words. I get that it's important to know that Tyrion is screwed, but it's pretty much already implied. Ending the episode immediately on Ellaria's screaming or Tyrion's shocked face would have been much better, in my opinion. I know these can be seen as nitpicks, and some might be, but editing is a very important factor of any scene as well.
Â 
ETA: Okay, I've been harping on about the annoying editing for this scene, so I'd just like to quickly praise the single take at the start in the brothel. Sure, it wasn't True Detective level, but it was cool the show kept in an extended take, even if it wasn't necessary. I've got an obsession with long takes in movie and TV, so it was great to see one in Game of Thrones. Okay, I feel I've done enough to ensure some people I'm not just constantly hating on this show. Sometimes it shows moments of goodness

That's stretching things ... alot.

Don't give me the director was going for subtle exposition highlighting how the world is full of vipers and mountains to be overcome ... the episode was named for the duel, simple as.

2412	Carl Rhaego	2014-06-02	There was no tension in this fight, it was too short to build up tension. The Mountain just stood there like a statue. Worst part was the head exploding, it was so overdone that it looked silly, I don't think that's physically possible. They coud put that in the Walking Dead but not a show that wants to be half way realistic and serious.

Â 
i thought he sounded remarkably similar to the last Mountain for being a completely different person.
Fortunately it isn't painfully obvious, like the Dark Knight Rises where re-dubbed Bane speaks at about 12 decibels higher than everyone else.Â

It's very much possible. It takes only 520 pounds of force to crush a skull from the front. (http://thejns.org/do...012.8.PEDS12116). An average adult can exert 289 pounds of force with both hands (http://msis.jsc.nasa.gov/sections/section04.htm#Figure%204.9.3-5). But The Mountain is a LOT stronger than an average adult.Â

Â 
We don't need maths ... as someone very accurately summized the director, writer, whoever went for that big 'jolt' of a shock, rather than a sustained level of audience emotion. Probably because the show is actually quite shallow and bereft of some of the key emotional content of the books.
Â 
Its just the result of a poor adaptation of the source material.
Â 
Squishing his head like that detracted from the power of the scene for some of us, its not really about the 'possibility' of it happening. That is of course an important factor, but it also fits in with other factors that have put some of us off how the scene played out.

Â 
That was my main problem with it as well. It felt like a cheap shock moment. Compare it to how they portrayed Ned's death. That was a really powerful scene, tasteful but shocking. Oberyn's death was so ridiculous that it ruined the impact for me.
2418	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-02	Â 



 Â Â it should be the most brutal, slow, agonizing death....not just that he beat him, but he basically obliterated him....if Gregor is known for killing a man for snoring, he wouldn't just chop a man in half for trying to kill him...crushing/breaking/destroying him with his bare hands, that fitsÂ 


Â 
Â 


Â 
i would be okay with that...no need for a zoom up slow mo of his face caving in...but camera panned on Gregor while he's pounding Oberyn's face in, or while he appears to be crushing something and bellowing his confession...then after he's done, a quick glance to show it was his face he crushed, not just choked to death...
Â 
imo, that wouldn't be tooooo graphic and sufficiently horrific


Â 
Â 
sorry to quote myself but this was exaaaaaactly what i wanted to see so i've never been happier with D&DÂ  Â  Â

2423	Lord Martin	2014-06-02	They pulled it off well, loved that Oberyns squire before the fight was rubbing his spear-head with what looked like a wet/poison

This was a nice touch especially.
2424	Autumn is Coming	2014-06-02	I understand the need to nitpick, but everyone's making it sound like this episode was the worst thing ever put on screen. It wasn't; it was fine.
2425	Roose Seal	2014-06-02	The guy who plays the Mountain pulls fucking big rig trucks with the force of his god damned body, yet people are complaining that he could crush somebodies skull? Are you drunk or too used to Hollywood having people survive getting smacked with massive objects and getting right back up? This guy does thisÂ

Â 
The whole point of the fight both in the book and show is that if he touches you and you don't happen to be Sandor, Jon Umber or Robert Baratheon in his hey day, you're dead.Â 


I don't think anyone is debating whether or not heÂ could do it. People are just saying it looked a little dumb on screen, is all.

2427	The Lord of Cinder	2014-06-02	I thought the fight was excellent and they stayed very true to the book, much more so than The Red Wedding. But you guys just reminded me of why I haven't been visiting these forums that much since season 3. While there's a lot of people who are pleased, and a lot of people have valid reasons to not like something, the overwhelming pessimism and the "I should have adapted the books!" attitude just gets on my nerves. Guess it's easy to please me, because most of the time I enjoy the show a lot without overthinking, overanalyzing or comparing every detail on the show with every detail in the books. You should try it, it makes stuff much more enjoyable. But everyone to their own, I guess. In the end we all are nothing but beetle crushers.

That's stretching things ... alot.
Â 
Don't give me the director was going for subtle exposition highlighting how the world is full of vipers and mountains to be overcome ... the episode was named for the duel, simple as.
Â 
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar as the saying goes  .


How is this stretching things? The MOuntain and The Viper, the title itself is pretty much a play of the Farmer and The Viper and there is plenty of betrayal to go around.

Wrong, GRRM is the beetle crusher. We are just Tyrion trying to make sense of him. 
The only good thing that comes from Oberyn's death is the Martell/Sand Snakes storyline. I can't wait for Dorne next season!

People aren't allowed to criticize something? Everyone has to unite in their complete agreement on how amazing it was?Â

Everyone's allowed to criticize anything, of course. Â But, this fight was awesome and for there to be this much criticizing just further illustrates truly how difficult it is to satisfy this forum. Â  It's one of those things.... when you dramatically criticizeÂ everything, it's kind of hard to take seriously after a while.
Â 
No one cares when people that can't seem to be satisfiedÂ aren't satisfied.
Â 
Â 
Also, to the people complaining about the Mountain crushing his head, it takes about 200 pounds of pressure to crush a human skull. Â  The Mountain is 500 Lbs and the actor likely benches 500+ lbs in real life. Â  heck, Â that guy Â could probably crush a person skull in real life too.

Then blame Martin for putting it in the book that he crushed Oberyn's skull. Â What do you folks think happens when a skull is crushed? Â That it's contents just casually spill out? Â 
Â 
Geez, I thought they did that scene freaking justice. Â
2436	Lady Arwen	2014-06-02	Â 
IMO, it was an analogy on the randomness of death and judgement. Tyrion's cousin never gave any reason as to why those beetles had to die, he just did it. The beetles had never done anything to him and they were in no position to defend himself. Tyrion is the beetle, life is the cousin. It keeps trying to squash him at every opportunity for no good reason (other than "you're a dwarf"). Chances are he will never know why, because the people pulling the strings / holding the rock (Cersei, Tywin, the gods) are either unwilling or too insane to give him an answer.
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â I agree with your interpretation. I get that they were going for an extended metaphor with the beetle discussion, but I felt that it went on a bit too long without building up the anticipation for the upcoming duel sufficiently. The duel scene would have benefited from some epic building-up (as good as it was, IMO).

GRRM made the skull crush, it didn't explode like a watermelon in a cartoon.
2440	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	Loved it. Nobody mentioned all the teeth falling to the ground after the first punch? That was book solid and hideous.


Â 
That got me the second it happened.Â  I could hear the teeth hitting the ground, even though they were somewhat camouflaged in the stream of blood.Â 
Â 
~shudder, I've had too many root canals, hate to see good teeth go to waste, LOL~
2441	Jairion Lannister	2014-06-02	It was arguably a bit on the short side but if it'd gone on it could have possibly dragged. Had an epic finish and Oberyn's lines about his sister were really well delivered.
2442	Starksmustwin	2014-06-02	Regardless of how you think the scene played out, can we all (or as close to a majority as possible) agree that an episode entitled The Mountain and The Viper that contains roughly about 6.30 minutes of screen time out of 51 minutes that is actually dedicated to the duel by both men (Viper/Mountain) is largely pathetic?
Â 


Â 
And the previous episode, entitled "Mockingbird" for Petyr Baelish only had a short ending scene for him as well. Â  This is how they do most of the episodes.

I had already half-covered my eyes by that point because I knew what was coming, but my boyfriend later pointed out the teeth waterfall and the sound of them hitting the ground. Gross. Bye bye, sleep.
2444	Turncloak_	2014-06-02	D&D had one job and they fu**ed it up. This fight should have been superior to the book version in every way. Instead we get bad fighting editing and epic lines edited out creating a subpar experience. D&D think this is the best fight they have ever done? Have they been dropped on their head? Lord Beric vs The Hound is clearly superior and even Jaime vs Ned way back in season 1 was better handled
2445	lostinwesteros	2014-06-02	Loved, loved watching Oberyn's acrobatics and his unrelenting "you raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children" over and over, loved it when he looked directly up at Tywin as the one who ordered it.  But, even knowing what was coming, I was unprepared for how horrific it would be to watch.
2446	Ran	2014-06-02	Yeah, the "Kissed by Fire" fight is definitely the best one the show has done, in my mind. And that's directed by Graves, too. But it tailored the fight to the actors, the setup, the environment. Plus, you know, practical effects. So it's worth noting that that episode has almost exactly the same average shot length as this fight. But what Beric and the Hound had going for it was a more cramped environment, closer in fighting, and a choreography that allowed a lot of medium shots to establish and emphasize movement (doubtless in part because the fire effect on the sword just had to be given its due).It was highly effective, in that context.

The sound of them hitting was more horrifying than looking for them in the bloodfall.Â  I did alot of Ohhhhhhhhh, and eye covering and then....looking at the screen again throughout it.Â  I normally would have rewatched by now, I think I'm still trying to avoid the horror of it all for a bit.Â

Â 
Yeah, I'd agree with you on this. I don't mind seeing some criticism, you're always going to get that and it's fine up to a point, but some people seem to hate everything about what is an excellent adaption of something which is hard to adapt.
Â 
If this was the book version and the show had done what we know as the actual book version, people would probably have complained that the fight was too long and drawn out or something. It's not a perfect adaption, but it's a pretty damn good one and the reaction of non-book readers tells you the scene was done well since it's had a strong effect.

that is so true! allll of my unsullied friends lost their minds after this ep, they all seem to be focused on the right things after this ep, thinking about tyrions fate, worried he's gona die next, worrying how the Dornish will retaliate, impressed with Sansa, recognizing Arya's cold-bloodedness, jorah getting what he deserves ...

2458	Jo cool	2014-06-02	Good job imho. I think this scene captured the quintessence and raw power of the chapter. I'm ok with the differences and direction choices, it is an adaptation after all.
The only way to come up with a 100% noncontroversial version would be to film a somebody's hand turning the book pages I guess. As faithful as it gets.
2459	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-06-02	Â 
That was my main problem with it as well. It felt like a cheap shock moment. Compare it to how they portrayed Ned's death. That was a really powerful scene, tasteful but shocking. Oberyn's death was so ridiculous that it ruined the impact for me.


Â 
So you would have preferred the book version where he smashes his head in on the ground and knocks his eyeballs out of their sockets? (Which is actually much more unrealistic), Or would you have preferred less gore so that you can complain about how they're toning down the violence from the books?Â

Agree. And the sad thing is that all this constant, never ending negativity draws the reasonable people away from this forum. Used to read them everyday and now IÂ rarely read any GoT threads because it will be the same relentless bitching and moaning.
Â 
"Only Cat" was the last straw and a perfect example of people's neurotic behavior. Other examples are people bitching about Jamie's delayed reaction to getting his hand cut off, and what exactly a crushed head should look like. Criticism is one thing, becomingÂ consumed with tearing down this show is completely different.
2461	acacia	2014-06-02	So people are saying The Mountain is a huge powerful beast of a man, unlike any they've seen before. Yet are nitpicking him crushing Oberyns head by squeezing it? Oooook then.
The scene was as perfect as it could've been for TV. Do you really think the Unsullied would've been interested hearing about his fight plan etc. how he was going to wear him down and beat him? Use poison etc.? That would've only been servicing the book readers, people who already knew how the scene played out it would've all been lost on the TV viewers and left them thinking "fuck, this is boring get on with the fight". I often wonder why some book readers even bother watching the show.

Â It still came off as really intense (to me), and I thought the part where he demands to know who gave the orders, and essentially accuses Tywin before all King's Landing after 20 years of him never getting publicly called out for that, was very powerful. Â This guy has made a great Oberyn, and I know it was never in the cards for him to stick around (like Ned), but it sucks to lose him from the show.

Â 
This. I am a book reader and I completely dissociate myself from the nitpickers.
Â 
The fight was the best in the series so far by a long shot, and despite I knew how it was going to end I had my heart racing until the traumatic killing. This is how I know it was great... because it left me with something that no other scene has.
Â 
The beetle storyÂ to build up tension with some gallows humorÂ (because you are just waiting for the damn fight to get on), the Pycelle sendaway with him bowing his head sheepishly, the swagger of Oberyn who was incredible in his delivery of the iconic lines, the ferocity of the Mountain, the cracking of Tywin's icy expression when he realizes that he is getting exposed in front of all KL, Cersei between horrified and relieved, Jaime finding pleasure in watching the fight from a technical standpoint - and his utter disappointment both because Tyrion is doomed, but probably more because he was starting to believe that Oberyn has won. The jump to stab the Mountain, and the final glance at Ellaria were amazing as well...
Â 
The final vulnerability of the trio that lost (Oberyn, Ellaria and Tyrion), with his crying blood, her endless scream and the final shot of Tyrion's face when he realizes that all is lost and he can't talk his way out of this one, were just priceless and the icing on the cake. In five minutes they condensed an incredible amount of emotions and expectations in a mostÂ beautiful but horrific setting.
Â 
It completely blew my mind.
2467	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	Its not nitpicking. overall i liked the scene. but the show has executed big scenes much better than they have this season, with more buildup and anticipation. Let's be honest, the build up to the fight was not well executed and the fight itself went by too fast
2468	Follmann	2014-06-02	What I liked:
- Pascal's performance and specially the growing intensity with which he delivered his lines.
- You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
- The Darth Maul-esque fighting style did fit Oberyn's cockiness.
- Liked the reactions of the other characters.
Â 
What I'm ok with, but:
- The head crush. I would have liked it better if the Mountain just bashed his face in with a powerful punch or two, instead of the exploding head.
- The delivery of "Then I smashed her head in, like this." was weird.
- That's a sad helm, mister Mountain.
- I missed the "sevens hells" line.
Â 
What I didn't like:
- Too. Many. Cuts.
- Why the hell did the Mountain fight one-handed most of the time? I know he was supposed to be able to wield a 6-foot sword like that, but with no shield it just looked dumb and his blows felt powerless. The two-handed portions felt much more brutal.
2469	MarieAntoinette	2014-06-02	I was satifsfied with the duel. The part I liked most was Oberyn accusing Tywin. It was awful to sit through the end of the fight, I'm not such a squeamish person but Oberyn's screams really got to me, the visuals were horrifying too. Pedro Pascal was a great Oberyn, he was one of the best things about this season. Also, I really hated Cersei for the nasty smirk in her last reaction shot. Can't wait for her downfall.

If you're expectations of the show are that low, why do you bother watching it? Just to derive pleasure from complaining about it? The book forums are that way.Â
2471	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-02	I thought the fight was really well executed but I have to agree with the criticism that they did not give time for the tension to build up. They should have seriously cut down on Tyrion's beetle speech and used this time to show the fight or even the arena before the fight (e.g. Oberyn weighing up the Mountain while he is lacing his spear with poison).Â
2472	Ferocious Veldt Roarer	2014-06-02	I'm shocked by how many people are claiming they didn't like the duel. Â Does it suck to go through life without anything meeting your expectations ever?Yes, actually it does, but that's another issue. As for your question - do you think that the duel on the HBO show was the best thing in the history of humanity and if that didn't satisfy me, nothing ever will? That's... weird.
2473	David Selig	2014-06-02	Â 
If you're expectations of the show are that low, why do you bother watching it? Just to derive pleasure from complaining about it? The book forums are that way.Â 


Hey, I enjoyed watching the fight. Just not in the same way as people who thought it was amazingly shot and highly dramatic. 
Â 
I don't watch the show for the action scenes, most of them are pretty mediocre IMO.

2474	Jojosh	2014-06-02	I just can't get over how they ruined the culmination of the fight with that head exploding nonsense and the two shots of it afterward just make a somewhat realistic scene all the more stupid.
2475	taliefer	2014-06-02	i loved the duel, but i think im in the minority...i absolutely loved the beetle speech, more than the duel.
Â 
The speech came across as Tyrion completely not understanding why the world, especially his own family, Â is constantly trying to crush him. and Jaime's "i dont know" response was gut wrenching. He knows his their sister and father have it out for Tyrion, but neither of them really know why. This was good stuff. i loved it.

Yes. Â Thanks for caring enough to ask, but in the future try less victim blaming.
Â 
Also, please consider the well known phrase "ignorance is bliss" next time you say you are happy with something and others are not.
2477	Tankbuster	2014-06-02	The Headsplosion was way too much like WH40K: Space Marine execution moves. I half expected the Mountain to get up after that at full health. OTOH, the way Pedro says those lines, the way he jerks out that spear from the Mountain while saying "no" was very nice.
2478	sj4iy	2014-06-02	LOL.
Who knew that Wetblanketos.org was home to so many directors and choreographers. The Internet is so full of wonder.

Don't forget martial arts experts, weapon masters and cinematographers.  Oh, and they are apparently the only ones who really "get" the story, as well.

True, whenever I hear people say how awesome the Sandor/Dondarrion fight was I get cofnfused, it really wasn't that great.
Â 
Another thing, doesn't Oberyn's fighting style remind you of a more refined version of Arya's waterdancing?
2480	sj4iy	2014-06-02	Â 
The sound of them hitting was more horrifying than looking for them in the bloodfall.Â  I did alot of Ohhhhhhhhh, and eye covering and then....looking at the screen again throughout it.Â  I normally would have rewatched by now, I think I'm still trying to avoid the horror of it all for a bit.Â 

I watched without covering my eyes or looking away.
I don't need to relive the horror.
2481	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-02	I love this forum. You people are all crazy.
2482	Frey Pies	2014-06-02	What show would that be? Not GoT, that's for sure...


Â 
Oh, but it is
2483	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-02	Â 
Again, totally get why he screamed in the show- I don't think anyone who could actually feel pain or was still conscious wouldn't scream. I'm just comparing the scenario to the books here, which I think was better done. I got the point that Oberyn dropped the ball, paid for it dearly, revenge blinded him, all that. But, comparing it to the book, leads me to this.
Â 
Â At no point in the books did I think, or think anyone else would think "wow, Oberyn died like a screaming little bitch", that's all.
Â 
Again, not so much dissapointed because I thought,"aww man he screamed like a pussy", but I know that idea would get into a lot of other peoples heads. From experience, knowing dudes who think they'd handle having their skull crushed like Thich Quang Duch when he burned in Saigon: unflinching, and silent as a rock- because, you know, they're real men. I dunno, it's a tiny nit-pick. He died pretty gruesomely in both cases, anyways. I just don't feel the phrase "like a bitch" should be associated with Oberyn, at all. He's not Vegeta. He's Inigo Montoya.
Â 
I still don't think they should have had him getting knocked down so much, or having his first spear broken like that. I really do think it ruined the build-up. Like, all right, this guy has had a few close calls already, not really convinced he'll walk out unscathed- where as compared to the books, he owns it right up until he doesn't.


I completely agree with you. Don't know why that's what people are getting from this scene. Never once did I think less of Oberyn when I read about his horrific death, and even then I assumed he was screaming his head off as all of this was going on. Oberyn is human, far too human to be honest, and screaming while someone is gouging out your eyes is a realistic reaction. Doesn't make him less of a badass for taking down the Mountain, and in fact, just goes to show that any "badass" would do scream in the same fashion if they had to do endure that kind of horrific pain. I for one was pleased with the duel. I think some of the complaints about the cut were legitimate, but there was plenty enough tension throughout for me. They kept in all the best lines, and didn't deviate from his terrible demise.
2484	Tadco26	2014-06-02	The fight was ok by Game of Thrones standards, though it certainly could have been better.Â  The fight choreography has mostly been bad since season 1, so my expectations have gradually lowered to the point that this fight seems good by comparison.Â
2485	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-02	Â 
Â 
Agree. And the sad thing is that all this constant, never ending negativity draws the reasonable people away from this forum. Used to read them everyday and now IÂ rarely read any GoT threads because it will be the same relentless bitching and moaning.
Â 
"Only Cat" was the last straw and a perfect example of people's neurotic behavior. Other examples are people bitching about Jamie's delayed reaction to getting his hand cut off, and what exactly a crushed head should look like. Criticism is one thing, becomingÂ consumed with tearing down this show is completely different.


Â 
Hear, hear. The 'Only Cat' whining was pathetic.
Â 
I loved the duel!

2486	Meso Eda	2014-06-02	I don't really watch the series, because i don't like how they adapted the whole thing, but i do watch a few important scenes every once in Â a while to see how they filmed them. So i watched this duel and i was laughing the whole time, by the end i was starting to believe i was watching some horror zmovie. Â All that was missing was Mountain screaming in pain like a little girl from poison but he just rolled over ( and died XD) ;_;.Â
2487	SansaSeastar	2014-06-02	For what it matters, I thought the fight was awesome! For me it was perfect, his cockiness, how you could see he already thought he won. They way he looked, the way both him and Tywin looked when Oberyn accused him. & like some already pointed out. Jaime. That was a great addition. He really looked like; 'Oh shit, this guy is winning this fight, this is awesome'! And just this:
'Wait, are you dying? No, no, no, you can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it! Say her name! Elia Martell. You raped her, you killed her children, Elia Martell! Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children! Say it, say her name ... Say it!'

Â 
They really nailed it in my book. Â It's right up there with how they handled Ned's execution.
2490	Wunhopkuendo	2014-06-02	Its not nitpicking. overall i liked the scene. but the show has executed big scenes much better than they have this season, with more buildup and anticipation. Let's be honest, the build up to the fight was not well executed and the fight itself went by too fast


I'm going to guess that you have never been in a real fight, nor have any kind of training in such. I have for the greater part of my life and I was exhausted just watching it.
2491	Indemnity	2014-06-02	No matter what happens on the show, there's always people complaining.
Â 
I liked the duel, it was quite true to the books (compared to most important scenes).Â 
Â 
People seem to forget this is 'only' a tv-series, not a 1,5 hour movie with a 200 million dollar budget. So please stop comparing it to movies, its not realistic.Â 
The acting, scenery, effects and fighting are top notch for a tv-series.
Â 
Most of my friends watch the show but haven't read the books, i've been witnessing total chaos all day long, nobody saw this coming. They all thought Oberyin was the new guy, cool guy and totall badass, they cant kill him, cause then Tyrion will die and that will never happen. They hardly knew a thing about the mountain (most of them didnt even remember the mountain from previous seasons). Im loving it, reactions were the same as with the red wedding.
2492	Ran	2014-06-02	The movie thing is lame. They can take the same amount of time as any film in choreographing one-on-one fight scenes. They have less time and money to actually film it, yes, but the can prep it just the same. The actors have spoken in the past of preparing over weeks for particular scenes.
2493	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-06-02	The actual fight was fine, although I do wish it had been longer. I wanted more Oberyn though, maybe some fight prep scenes, him and Tyrion before the match instead of that beetles crap. I wanted more Oberyn is Awesome build up.

I think some of your criticisms regarding the obscene amount of cuts are legitimate. I don't think the fight was half as bad as some are making it out to be, but certainly the choreography left something to be desired. That being said, the real thematic quality of the fight for meÂ comes from theÂ gradual building of rageÂ in Pascal'sÂ performance.Â The lines were delivered spectacularly,Â precisely becauseÂ we get to watch Oberyn's loss of composure, the slowÂ culmination of his anger into an explosion of emotion as he stands upon the precipice of his revenge. We got most of the key dialogue from the book scenes, an excessively brutal and depressing death, and a fitting end to a character arc that has been arguably more fleshed out in the television series than in the original novels. I think this emphasis onÂ the underwhelmingÂ choreography, while not completely illegitimate, misses the point of the duel entirely.
2496	Ankou	2014-06-02	People are focusing on Oberyn needing a double, but I doubt they could get a double to match the size of their Gregor. No way you're getting great choreography out of that massive dude. I don't care if you prepare for months.Â
2497	Dildo_Baggins	2014-06-02	I checked the forums before i watched the episode and i saw people saying the ending was too much graphic and horrific. I was like meh how bad can it be. I just watched the episode and jeeez that was the most graphic scene i have ever watched. I loved when he pointed to Tywin that he gave the order. I forgot if did this in the book though.Â
2498	Relic	2014-06-02	Man it must suck to be some of you, who can never appreciate anything and pick it a part to the last detail.
Â 
I'm so happy i can enjoy the books and tv show without crying about each episode.


Â 
Clearly, we are all miserable hermits without the slightest idea how to enjoy life. Lol, the hyperbole is ridiculous. I'm not castigating you for enjoying it, am i? why do ya'll feel the need to keep pointing out people who disagree with your love of this show? Grow up.
Â 
That said, ive been a member of this community since GoT was in its first hardback edition, and we have discussed all things aSoIaF related over the years. And will continue to do so. If you'd rather go talk about this show in a place where everyone agrres with you hit up IGN's comments section. Â

2500	Demnia	2014-06-02	I'm a long time lurker (hi guys!) but I made an account just to reply to this topic.
Â 
I'm a book reader, so I knew what would happened. I loved Oberyn already from the books and his brutal death left me speechless and disheartened back then already but Pedro made me fall in love with the character a second time and now, judging by all your comments, I have to say : I'm SCARED to watch the episode. It's been two hours since I can't decide to watch it or not. As someone previously said though, I'm glad I read the books because I'll know when to close my eyes.Â 
Â 
From all the comments I read too, the only thing that will probably disappoint me is that they did not build a little more the Mountain's character... I mean, apparently non readers don't grasp the whole "terror" that Gregor is supposed to be.
Â 
Anyway, I'm scared to watch ^^
2501	Veltigar	2014-06-02	The duel sucked balls:
Â 
1) Not enough build-up. Normally, you can't get D&D away from KL. Even when nothing happens they still stick around. And now they just dropped in right before the start of the damn duel.
Â 
2) The fight was to short.
Â 
3) The fancy spinning and quick cuts made this fight unrealistic and boring. Pedro is such a great actor, use him, instead of having some random stuntdouble do some spins and shit. Overall, they should have taken inspiration from Rob Roy's final duel, not from Darth Maul vs Obi and Liam Neeson.
Â 
4) The end position was lame. The Mountain was speared to the gut and had other wounds as well. And still he managed to work his way on top and kill the RV. Why not keep it as in the book, pull the RV on top of Gregor and then break his face. Pan out and show them lying in eachother's arms like lovers united in death.
Â 
5) The exploding skull just looked odd. Like something from Evil Dead II or II.
2502	mickyd	2014-06-02	The actual fight was fine, although I do wish it had been longer. I wanted more Oberyn though, maybe some fight prep scenes, him and Tyrion before the match instead of that beetles crap. I wanted more Oberyn is Awesome build up.


Â 
Â 
I loved the fight. I thought it was very true to the book, if not in every single little detail ( I was looking forward to seeing the stablehand cut in half lol) however I have always made it a point to watch the late night repeat of the episode, I had to turn the channel when it came to Oberyn's death.
Â 
Seeing that once was enough.Â  Brutal, and definitely captured and exceeded visually what the book expressed in words.Â  Yuck.Â  I don't know about everyone else, I came to love Oberyn's character through Pedro Pascal's portreyal of him as opposed to the book presentation of him.Â  That hurt, even though you knew it was coming.Â  The manner of it, so final, so quick, so brutal even came as a shock. I didn't expect that, even on HBO lmao!
Â 
Â 
I didn't even touch on the Beetle speech in my comments/complaints on the episode, again, not a bad deviation/addition in itself. But as the expense of what, the very telling Oberyn/Tyrion conversation prior to the duel.Â  It would have been a great pt. 2 to Oberyn's tale of his journey to meet the baby monster Tyrion, and what the real purpose of that visit was, and give more explanation as the 'orders' Tywin gave during the Sack of Kings Landing.Â

Heh, one of my friends knows Tyrion somehow ends up in Essos. Earlier he told me about his theory of how Oberyn was going to win, and Tyrion was going to get pardoned, but he would leave King's Landing for good and travel to Essos. He even said that it's obvious that Oberyn has to win since Tyrion survives and they just introduced this badass Dornishman, and therefore he said he wasn't that excited for the duel. He's gonna watch the episode tomorrow. Can't wait to see his reaction!
2504	harsha_nails	2014-06-02	That fight scene ended too abruptly for me. Was it this graphic in the books? I can't seem to remember
2505	The Mountain That Flies	2014-06-02	Am I the only one who found Ellaria Sand to be the true hearbreaker of the scene? Her final lines with Oberyn had me pretty worked up knowing what was coming, and her scream at his death straight ripped me in half. Massive credit to the actress.
2506	oursisthefury69	2014-06-02	No shields.Â 
Â 
What is Gregor even doing with his second hand in the fight?
Â 
Somehow managed to both not desensitize the death as well as make it more unrealistic.Â  I figured one of those would be sacrificed for the other, not that they'd both be entirely worseÂ
2507	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-02	After giving it a second look, I think if they had dumped a lot of Tyrion's dialogue with Jaime about their beetle-crushing cousin, they would have had more time for the duel, to ramp up the intensity.
Â 
Â 


No shields.Â 


Â 
Â 
Alas, yes, there were not shields. Shields and helmets are almost never used in the major fight scenes in the show (or shows, generally).
Â 
The issue of helmets is actually lampshaded in this scene, since Oberyn may have lived if he had been wearing one. (The first punch from Gregor stuns him, and after that he's in a firm grip.)

Â 
Nope, you're not the only one, I thought she did a fantastic job.
My heart broke when she told him, 'Don't leave me in this world alone.' Then her scream at the end made me tear up.

Just rewatched the scene and she was flawless. I really hope they keep her around next season for her "when does it end" line. Wish they had given her more to do all season than brothel scenes.
2510	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-02	It was good. The "You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children" line was really good towards the end. Not so much at the start. I wish they had the line from the books where he tells the Mountain that if he dies without confessing then he'd hunt him through all seven hells or something like that. That was one of the most epic lines ever.


Yep this was the one line they didn't included that was pretty dissapointing to me.Â

Oberyn was wearing his helmet in the books, the punch basically nearly breaks his neck and knocks all his teeth out. The punch doesn't just stun him, he's dead the second that punch hit him, not an immediate death, but he lost half his teeth, he probably had a skull fracture, if not just a major concussion.Â 
Â 
The helm was much more important for Gregor, because it hurts his vision against such a mobile foe while also helping keep no easy way for Oberyn to prick him.
2515	poggo	2014-06-02	Well... the fight was really lame.*
Â 
Much too short. Maybe I was expecting too much,
but when you spend 4 minutes talking about beetles, why not give the fight one more minute?
Â 
*For the standard of such a big show.... And the producers really talked big about this one...
2516	bannor136	2014-06-02	Hello, as with others I've been a lurker for a while and finally have decided to post, just to express my thoughts on this duel.
Â 
I thought it started fairly well, with Oberyn showing off his moves. While some think it was unnecessary, he was doing it first of all because he's cocky (and we love him for it), and also because he was probably trying to show that he had skill to the people. In the fighting, I thought they did a good job; the duel between them had some awesome moments, and they really got the agility I hoped Oberyn would have.Â 
Â 
The problem with the show was that it didn't show Oberyn as being cocky. When he walked around the Mountain, to me, he seemed lifeless. He wasn't moving at all, and he had been stabbed like 3 or 4 times not including the finishing thrust. He should not have been able to move. This is terrible because he all of the sudden goes from unconscious/dead to grabbing Oberyn's leg without seeing it (how did he know where to grab?). This makes it seem like Oberyn died not because of cockiness but because his opponent is immune to damage.This is further made worse because during the fight I didn't feel like the Mountain was dying or weakened, which he should have been; they portray him as if he has full strength, and then after killing Oberyn he collapses, which to me seems more fantasy than I would like in Game of Thrones.Â 
Â 
Edit: Forgot to add, but while rewatching it, the Mountain gets up on top of Oberyn; did he forget that he got stabbed in the hamstring?

2517	Demnia	2014-06-02	Upon watching, yes I finally managed, just a couple comments :
Â 
Yes to you two saying Ellaria is heartbreaking. "don't leave me alone in this world..."
Â 
I'm not picky and I "liked" the scene. My only comment is : "he was speared through, how in holly hell can he come back?" but that's just me being picky? and really, totally in denial ^^
Â 
I was doubtful when Pedro Pascal was cast, and he kept proving me wrong. I will miss him.
Â 
Without wanting to start a war, I don't understand the many complains on this scene. I thought it was great. When you loved a book so much, putting it into movie is extremely difficult (I am thinking of LoTRs), and in both accounts I thought it was finely done, seeing as how much of a challenge it is and as how much you CANT put into pictures some things that are written.
Â 
Well I'm heartbroken but I think they done it well enough. There are things very elusive and I hope it'll be explained (poison, Twyn poisoned etc.) but really it's a TV show made from a book and you'll never grasp it whole without reading the books, I believe. Though even though I say this, I wish they would have portraited the Mountain as the treat, the fear he is supposed to be.
Â 
Man, I'm weeping for Oberyn a second time. Ty Pedro, you were amazing.
2518	Hound's She-wolf	2014-06-02	I liked the fight, I just wanted more build up that didn't include a ridiculous story about beetles. I laughed when Jaime asked who gives a dusty fuck about beetles because that was exactly how I felt about this waste of screen time.
2519	Darryk	2014-06-02	Well that was as horrifying to watch as I feared it would be.
Â 
Why, GRRM, why

2522	HouseHarrison	2014-06-02	The head smash was hilarious and I liked it, but the rest of the fight was just flat-out bad. Made Oberyn look like an amateur.

I disagree, I wouldve liked maybe one knock down from the Mountain instead of like 3. But the spear work, the jumping around, the ass kicking he put on Gregor....he was just as poised to win the fight as he was in the books. But I guess arguing over if he looked like he was winning or not is stupid since....well he lost.
2524	snowleper	2014-06-02	Yeah, I'm irritated that none of the fight scenes ever have helmets, much less shields -- and going by this fight scene ( or the awful fight scene where the bastard of Bolton is shirtless killing fully armored opponents), armor seems really ineffectual in this adaptation.
I wish the fight has been closer to the book. They missed out on the dramatic development because they changed it.
Oberyn should have picked up the mountains sword - and after being grabbed, the mountain needed to bring him closer to his helmeted face so he could calmly whisper Ellia of Dorn before smashing his face in.
This episode really didn't have any of the dramatic tension that you find in the book. Instead they rushed it - and the Oberyn head poping made the already poorly handled fight that much less realistic.
2525	Demnia	2014-06-02	Hello, as with others I've been a lurker for a while and finally have decided to post, just to express my thoughts on this duel.
Â 
I thought it started fairly well, with Oberyn showing off his moves. While some think it was unnecessary, he was doing it first of all because he's cocky (and we love him for it), and also because he was probably trying to show that he had skill to the people. In the fighting, I thought they did a good job; the duel between them had some awesome moments, and they really got the agility I hoped Oberyn would have.Â 
Â 
The problem with the show was that it didn't show Oberyn as being cocky. When he walked around the Mountain, to me, he seemed lifeless. He wasn't moving at all, and he had been stabbed like 3 or 4 times not including the finishing thrust. He should not have been able to move. This is terrible because he all of the sudden goes from unconscious/dead to grabbing Oberyn's leg without seeing it (how did he know where to grab?). This makes it seem like Oberyn died not because of cockiness but because his opponent is immune to damage.This is further made worse because during the fight I didn't feel like the Mountain was dying or weakened, which he should have been; they portray him as if he has full strength, and then after killing Oberyn he collapses, which to me seems more fantasy than I would like in Game of Thrones.Â 
Â 
Edit: Forgot to add, but while rewatching it, the Mountain gets up on top of Oberyn; did he forget that he got stabbed in the hamstring?


Hello, fellow lurker! =)
Â 
As for Oberyn being cocky, sorry, it's just me by being by the books, and honnestly I'm at this point where the "truth" is by the books, so I can't really judge the show without the books. If that makes any sense. Sorry, english not being my first langage, it's a bit hard to explain. My vision is too much based on the books to honnestly judge the show.
Â 
But yes, I will always repeat I don't expect everything being pictured perfect from the show, you have to read to fully grasp, but even I was a bit shocked like ... the guy has been SPEARED THROUGH, how can he just... seriously he should be dead.
Â 
But I just close my eyes because a show can't fully translate what's in the book. Even though it is ridiculous at times.Â

Armor stops 11 year old girls who think they're Rambo cross Jet Li from stabbing you though. So it certainly has niche value.Â
2527	Seneti	2014-06-02	I also find it ridiculous that people actually nitpick about Oberyn screaming, I don't care how badass you are if somebody is caving in your skull while gouging in your eyes, you WILL scream. Else you simply have a physiological disorder.


Â 
This. It's one of the reasons I love Attack on Titan so much. Hollywood may have conditioned us to think that truly heroic and "manly" characters never cry, never scream in pain or never have second thoughts about selfless sacrifice, but truth is: they do. If you don't, then you are either 1) suffering from a serious physiological disorder or 2) someone who has undergone years, if not decades of training specifically designed to turned you into an emotionally neutral fighting machine (think Special Forces elite here).
Â 


Â 
Everyone's allowed to criticize anything, of course. Â But, this fight was awesome and for there to be this much criticizing just further illustrates truly how difficult it is to satisfy this forum. Â  It's one of those things.... when you dramatically criticize everything, it's kind of hard to take seriously after a while.
Â 
No one cares when people that can't seem to be satisfiedÂ aren't satisfied.
Â 
Â 
Also, to the people complaining about the Mountain crushing his head, it takes about 200 pounds of pressure to crush a human skull. Â  The Mountain is 500 Lbs and the actor likely benches 500+ lbs in real life. Â  heck, Â that guy Â could probably crush a person skull in real life too.


Â 
Agreed on all of this, particularly that last bit. Just proves how strong the Mountain really is.
Â 


I'm not picky and I "liked" the scene. My only comment is : "he was speared through, how in holly hell can he come back?" but that's just me being picky? and really, totally in denial ^^


Â 
Actually, it is perfectly possible to ram a spear through someone's belly and miss all vital organs, as anybody who has ever worked in a hospital will be able to tell you. Some people just have an incredible amount of luck. Also, this is the freakin' Mountain we're talking about.

Oh ok I got you. And I agree. The knot in my stomach was the same feel I had when reading. A lot different than any other character death. It's hard to explain. Maybe because of how brutal it was.

Â 
Hey, I know it is. Now please let me find a reason at how "it's not freakin possible, how dared you killed Oberyn, Gregor should be DEAD!" =)
More seriously, yes it is the Mountain we are talking about and my only true reproach to the show : non readers don't grasp the ultimate threat the Mountain is supposed to be. It's one of the few things I really reproach to the show so far if I want to be picky. But I'm not. Because if you want to truelly experience this story, you have to read the books. I love the books =)Â

PS : I SUX at forum features, I try, please bear with me? I don't know how to quote someone that multi quoted =)

2532	Gneisenau	2014-06-02	I don't have an issue with light armor, but come on, why forsake the helmet ? Helmets are probably the most important piece of protection for humans. It is the only piece armor that has been used from antiquity to modern day.
2533	hedgeknight001	2014-06-02	I love how Oberyn screamed like a girl, the Mountain should have said "And then I made her scream like a bitch, like this".

+1.
With the punch to the face so hard that it broke multiple teeth all the way out, Oberyn's brain would have been flung around the inside of his skull, causing an aneurysm -- he would have been unconscious, possibly dead, but not screaming. It's the physics.
Screaming just make him sound bitchy.
2534	MoseStark*	2014-06-02	I think they did a great job with the scene! It was a bit different from the books, but it had a lot of awesome moments in it from the book. I have to agree there were much cuts, but it's TV, so I guess that was necessary.
Â 
However, I still feel a like sick from the gore. I knew it was going to happen, I knew it was going to be horrible, but this was just awful. And that was also because of how great Pedro was this season. I'm going to miss him...
2535	HouseLark	2014-06-02	Wow, this scene has really brought out the "one semester at film school" crowd. I'm not a person who likes to pick the bones out of art of any nature, my view is that all art works best on a visceral level. So for me, the fight was thrilling, I really felt Oberyn's anger, his own thrill as he thought justice was within his grasp. It won't have the same resonance as the Red Wedding but it's a scene that will live long in the memory.
2536	ultimo12	2014-06-02	Screaming just make him sound bitchy.


Which is the point. From ultimate badass to screaming like a girl, that's very powerful. I liked it.

2539	hedgeknight001	2014-06-02	Wonderful. (Irony alert) And entirely predictable, Ran. You've clearly built up this moment in the book and expected it to be like the Rob Roy duels for YEARS in your head. This seems perfectly clear based on your endless tweets and postings here with links to the Rob Roy duel over the last two weeks.
That the show fails to live up to that is not the show's fault. It is yours.
And the idea that you will do a proper "cut count" is to prove how un-Rob-Roy this duel is just so endlessly predictable. But go ahead.
-----------
For me this duel was extremely satisfying, and visceral on a level I have never seen. It definitely lived up to my expectation after reading the book. But that is just my take.

+10. 
I suppose if HBO spent 20 million on this one episode and had two of the most competent actors in the world playing the parts, the fight would have looked better.
The show is doing fine -- not perfect, but the books are far from perfect also. Take the book version of the Viper/Mountain fight: it's ludicrous that an observer would be "cut in half" or involved in the fight in any way. If someone could be harmed, then theoretically *they* could do harm to one of the combatants. The crowd would have been held back, much like was depicted in the show version.
The show should be analyzed on its own internal logic, plot, characterization, etc. not held to some alleged gold standard in a different work of art.

2542	Arthmail	2014-06-02	It was a stupid scene. It was written poorly in the book and showed poorly in the show. The amount of pain from having your teeth smashed out would have been enough, but you're not going to get your fucking fingers very deep into a man's eyes, and hence his brain, without his brain actually shutting down and nothing coming out of his mouth because he's likely brain dead. Certainly not to the point that apparently the human head is a giant zit waiting to be squeezed. Fucking stupid.

While I can accept he would be alive, I just hated the transition from half dead to not even phased by his wounds. I didn't get the feeling that the guy smashing Oberyn was the same guy that had been lying on the ground with more wounds than anyone should be able to take. And going along with that, if the Mountain was still alive, wouldn't those stab wounds drain his energy; i feel like those stab wounds would fatigue him a pretty large amount.
2544	Shy	2014-06-02	the real thematic quality of the fight for meÂ comes from theÂ gradual building of rageÂ in Pascal'sÂ performance.Â The lines were delivered spectacularly,Â precisely becauseÂ we get to watch Oberyn's loss of composure, the slowÂ culmination of his anger into an explosion of emotion as he stands upon the precipice of his revenge.

If they did, Hong Kong's film industry would mostly vanish.I don't get the hyperbole with such things, really. The show shot that scene over four days -- twice as long as some fight scenes in Hollywood, big budget action flicks like Fast and Furious 6 (to pick a random example that I could find while Googling). The actors are people. There's no wire work. Where's this massive cost supposed to come from? Don't get it.

Â 
I think the length is about 1 or 2 feet longer than Oberyn, which is a good enough size, but Oberyn doesn't seem to use the extra reach, and most of the fight used very close shots, which I think creates the impression of Oberyn and Gregor being close.

							Edited by saloneju, 02 June 2014 - 05:34 PM.
2549	22willdo	2014-06-02	I don't think Oberyn's behaviour can even be classified as "cocky". "cocky", in my book, means "overly self-confident". There's no way Oberyn can be "overly" self-confident.
He knows that he's better than any man alive, in every imaginable way. He doesn't even bother to look down on us mere mortals. He just enjoys life, without giving a single thought about how his appearance might be perceived. That may be perceived as "cocky". But it's not.
It's not cockieness that made him unwary. It's anger and rage and fury.
As for the duel itself: I agree with those who say it's depicted way too short. 20 minutes into the episode, I started frowning. 10 minutes later I got worried. At about 00:40-00:45 I was like: W.T.F? Are they actually trying to wedge this duel into a couple of minutes?
Pedro Pascal did an amazing job there. Throughout his whole, shortlived appearance. Whoever the lump was, who depicted the first Daario, he should go back to school and study Pedro's performance, in order to learn how to act a real Alpha Male.
2550	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-02	I don't know why Oberyn told Tyrion that the Mountain cut Elia in half. That wasn't in the books and it's just stupid to be honest. I really doubt he brought his greatsword with him when he scaled Maegor's Tower just to kill a defenseless woman and her children. Even if he did, I wonder how that went...Â 
Â 
"Here, stand up, Princess. I just raped you and now I have to kill you. By chopping you in half. Step outside of the bedroom, over there in that open space so I can get a clear swing."
Â 
No, he was lying on top of her when he murdered her and when he was finished raping her, he just picked up his heavy mailed glove and dropped it down on her face. Because it was that easy for him. Gregor Clegane doesn't need a sword to completely obliterate someone. And the irony is that Gregor kills Oberyn the exact same way. He emasculates him by entering a missionary position and getting right in his face, "close enough to kiss." Then he delivers those disturbing last lines.
Â 
It's a revelation. The ultimate final taunt. No one knew quite how gruesome Elia's death was but the Mountain bellows it loud enough for everyone to hear. Then he demonstrates the same savagery on Oberyn as testament. If they cut Oberyn in half, I will be upset. But the fact Lena Headey has her thumbs over Pedro Pascal's eyes in that photoshoot at least shows that the actors are somewhat aware of how he dies in the books. Which tells me that's probably how he will die in the series. Those photos were most likely taken after season four was already filmed. It won't be exactly like his death in the books and that's alright. I had a hard time imagining Gregor beating Oberyn's face in with one hand while the other hand's fingers were gouging out his eyes anyway.
Â 
These are the things I want:Â 
Gregor's last words to Oberyn - especially "LIKE THIS"
Oberyn dying the same way Elia died
The use ofÂ someÂ sort of special effects on Oberyn's head/face (it has to be absolutely brA1tal)


Well God damn, they just knocked it out of the fucking ball park, didn't they? That was absolutely horrendous. In the best way possible. Oberyn's screams chilled me to the bone. You think just because he's so suave and brave that he wouldn't cry like a bitch the way he did. And that combined with Ellaria's little freak out at the end EASILY made it the most disturbing scene in GoT so far. Well done, HBO. Well fucking done. I think I'm going to need therapy now.

The lead up dialogue about Orson Lannister was utter twoddle though.

Even Dinklage's skills as an actor couldn't disguise it. Like putting lipstick on a pig.

I think it was OK what he did. He's Gregor Clegane, he's a complete sociopathic crazy monster with a never ending, raging temper. The fact that Oberyn (who the Mountain probably found extremely annoying) just stabbed him up with a spear would have really, really pissed him off. Not only would he be in a blinding amount of pain (no pun intended), he'd also be severely embarassed that this girly Dornishman just beat him. You remember how pissed off he got when Loras Tyrell unhorsed him at the hand's tourney in book/series 1? The Mountain was severely weakening, but with that amount of rage and adrenaline, I'm sure in that moment, it became his dying wish to carve Oberyn's head in the way he did his sister's, and it would not have required too much energy for someone as big and strong as the mountain. He put his last bit of strength into doing that before he collapses on the ground and stops moving.

2556	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-02	I find it funny that people are equating Oberyn's screaming to him being some type of wuss. He was getting his fricken eyes gouged out for gods sakes. I don't care how tough you are, you are going to scream.Â

I agree. But the screaming did bring us back down to earth so to speak. God that chapter & scene in the show. It's too real, too sickening. I re-watched it today, and decided I probably shouldn't watch it ever again. I thought they did a great job! But it rubs me the wrong way.Â
2558	teemo	2014-06-02	It was actually better than I expected. Â With the way D&D operate, I figured they'd cut out Oberyn screaming altogether. Â I was going to be livid if they did that. Â I did notice the body double and the cut issues like Ran pointed out, but I'm not sure the casual viewer would really notice. Â Maybe, I don't know. Â 
Â 
I thought it was weird that a kid was cleaning off Oberyn's spear. Â Was he wiping off the poison or something? Â Maybe some attention to Oberyn's spear would have been nice for some foreshadowing, but I guess they want to blindside people with that bit. Â I think they should have cut the beetle monologue out altogether; that was stupid as fuck. Â Could have dedicated more time to the duel and pre-duel instead of that shit.
Â 
Is it just me, or is the Mountain actually crushing Oberyn's skull a little over the top? Â Meaning, is that even possible? Â The eye gouging was cool though. Â Tyrion should have vomited though. Â That would have been perfect. Â 
Â 
It's a shame we couldn't get a non-brothel Oberyn scene before his death instead of some of the really bad scenes they had in there. Â The Missandei/Grey Worm thing is beyond stupid.Â 
Â 
Oh, and Tywin seemed really kind of smug and happy after a Prince of Dorne was obliterated right in front of him. Â IIRC Tywin wasn't too pleased for Oberyn to die like that. Â I can't imagine him being so smug about it.Â 
Â 
I guess I'm a sicko because I've re-watched the fight scene, including the eye-gouging at least ten times

2559	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-02	While I did like the fight I entirely agree that the buildup was terrible. First of all what was withTyrion and Jaime not knowing anything about Oberyn's reputation as a fighter? Jaime's words of reassurance were basically "Well he seems to be confident in himself", as if Jaime has no knowledge about his fighting prowess. Buidling up Oberyn's ability, then watching him beat up on Gregor for 95% of the fight, makes the ending that much more shocking. I have to believe the only reason not to reiterate his penchance for using poision is to make the poisoning of the spear more of a suprise in episode 10?Â

Sadly show Jaime is apparently a shitty fighter and a joke. See Brienne laughing at him and saying his reputation was all lies, Ned Stark shitting on him about not fighting in tournaments because he's got some Northern ninja shit or something and every character he meets saying he's a loser who would be nothing if his daddy didn't protect him with his gold and influence.Â 
Â 
So it makes sense that he has no idea about Oberyn...or the Mountain...or fighting.Â

Those agonizing screams at the end of his life clearly indicate he didn't have a single clue what he was getting himself into. Maybe if he did, he would have been too terrified to even enter the ring with that monster. Oberyn was not ready to die. He was so sure of victory that he lacked the life-saving apprehension which ensured Bronn would not suffer the same fate. I don't think the crying was a sign of weakness; it was a sign that he took no mental preparation to brace himself for death before the fight.

2562	The Emberheart	2014-06-02	I somewhat suspect the spear poisoning will kick off first thing in Episode 9 as the first two minutes with Cregor Clegane screaming and jerking on a brancard, where we learn something is amiss.
I also wonder that if Tyrion had screamed something like "It's my life you're toying with here too, we all know who raped your sister, now kill him and we'll visit some whores together", whether or not Oberyn would have thrust the spear through Cregor's head and be done with it. Probably not I guess.

I think crying in anguish has more to do with having your teeth smashed out by a 400lb muscleman that can deadlift 950lbs wearing plate gauntlets, then having your eyes pushed into your brain before your synapses collapse and you drift into sweet death...to be honest. I think Bronn wouldn't scream because he would be in a pool of his own blood long before he could get a cathartic moment to wax poetic about his plight.Â
2565	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-06-02	Those agonizing screams at the end of his life clearly indicate he didn't have a single clue what he was getting himself into. Maybe if he did, he would have been too terrified to even enter the ring with that monster. Oberyn was not ready to die. He was so sure of victory that he lacked the life-saving apprehension which ensured Bronn would not suffer the same fate. I don't think the crying was a sign of weakness; it was a sign that he took no mental preparation to brace himself for death before the fight.


those screams haunted my dreams last night.

No. It was the sign that his head was being crushed by a monster.


Disagree. I have somewhat of a sick morbid curiosity so I've seen quite a few people die in real life (shootings, beheadings, etc). Some people cry and scream and other people just bear the pain silently. I think it has a lot to do with how your mental state is at the time of death.Â

Lmao. Yeah, it was pretty fukt. Poor Oberyn

2567	Misnthropia	2014-06-02	So, as a book reader, this fight is a pinnacle of one on one combat for me. It was a fight that had immense buildup and it was so well described and had a brutal and sad ending.
Â 
This episode was entitled The Mountain and The Viper.
Â 
The fight lasted 4 minutes and had no Oberyn v Mountain build up in it. Remember how we complained that Crasters Keep was filler? THIS episode was a giant pile of filler.
Â 
Oberyn is hell bent on getting a confession. I thought the pacing, threatening Tywin and him getting louder and louder with his dialogue was good at portraying that.
Â 
I didnt get a sense of Oberyn being the clear victor and him essentially toying with him though the end came so quickly once he was on the ground.
Â 
Overall good fight, but the overall episode really let it down.
2568	Lee-Sensei	2014-06-02	Disagree. I have somewhat of a sick morbid curiosity so I've seen quite a few people die in real life (shootings, beheadings, etc).

Have you ever seen someone get their eyes gouged out and their head crushed after getting your teeth knocked out by 7' guy made of muscle?

2569	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-02	Am I the only one who found Ellaria Sand to be the true hearbreaker of the scene? Her final lines with Oberyn had me pretty worked up knowing what was coming, and her scream at his death straight ripped me in half. Massive credit to the actress.


 Â
2570	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-02	Have you ever seen someone get their eyes gouged out and their head crushed after getting your teeth knocked out by 7' guy made of muscle?


If I said yes...
2571	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-02	That line is great, but "no,no,no, you can't die yet, you have to confess" is pretty great too imo.Â 


Agreed I missed the book line, but I still felt that the replacement line got the same point across.Â
2572	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-02	I agree. But the screaming did bring us back down to earth so to speak. God that chapter & scene in the show. It's too real, too sickening. I re-watched it today, and decided I probably shouldn't watch it ever again. I thought they did a great job! But it rubs me the wrong way.Â 


O yea I can't get the ending out of my head. Truly disturbing and hell we knew it was coming too! I think the Ellaria screams really added to it as well.Â
2573	Raksha 2014	2014-06-02	those screams haunted my dreams last night.


Â 
Â 
I'm so glad that I turned my head (and turned on the mute button in the remote control) at the right moment. Â Some things I just don't want to see. Â
2574	bannor136	2014-06-02	I think it was OK what he did. He's Gregor Clegane, he's a complete sociopathic crazy monster with a never ending, raging temper. The fact that Oberyn (who the Mountain probably found extremely annoying) just stabbed him up with a spear would have really, really pissed him off. Not only would he be in a blinding amount of pain (no pun intended), he'd also be severely embarassed that this girly Dornishman just beat him. You remember how pissed off he got when Loras Tyrell unhorsed him at the hand's tourney in book/series 1? The Mountain was severely weakening, but with that amount of rage and adrenaline, I'm sure in that moment, it became his dying wish to carve Oberyn's head in the way he did his sister's, and it would not have required too much energy for someone as big and strong as the mountain. He put his last bit of strength into doing that before he collapses on the ground and stops moving.


Ok fair point, thinking about it more it seems to make a little more sense, considering that the Mountain isn't really what most would consider human. I'm just trying to ease the pain of Oberyn's passing in such a terrible wayÂ
2575	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-02	Have you ever seen someone get their eyes gouged out and their head crushed after getting your teeth knocked out by 7' guy made of muscle?


Have you ever seen someone have their neck sawed through halfway with a dull knife and then had their head twisted off their body? My sweet summer child...
Â 


I loved the fight. I thought it was very true to the book, if not in every single little detail ( I was looking forward to seeing the stablehand cut in half lol) however I have always made it a point to watch the late night repeat of the episode, I had to turn the channel when it came to Oberyn's death.


I can live without the stable boy being cut to pieces because I feel like the gore from that scene would have taken away from the shock that people would get after seeing Oberyn's brutal death. Also, I found it a little funny in the books how Gregor completely fucks up some random innocent kid right in front of Oberyn and yet he continues to rant about Elia's murder like it's somehow a more greivous crime than the one he just committed. Like he doesn't give two shits, he's just obsessed with killing Gregor. Makes him a little less likeable IMO. The only real complaint I have is that Gregor v.3 wasn't as badass as Gregor v.1. Conan Stevens was bigger and had a more menacing look about him. He was also closer to the same age as the actor who plays the Hound, which is supposed to be his younger brother. And because Conan Stevens's set of armor was too big for Thor to don, a new version was created for him to wear at the duel. Thor's version is missing a lot of cool pieces fromÂ season one's setÂ and it just looked more plain and less protective. I really don't understand why they chose to give him that stupid looking helmet over Martin'sÂ bucket helmÂ or why it got knocked off mid fight but it's not a big deal. I wish Gregor would have said "then I smashed her fucking head in... like this!" over "then I smashed her head... in like this!" but whatevs. Thor didn't do bad. Pedro did fucking excellent. All together an awesome scene.
2576	Martini Sigil	2014-06-02	extraordinary TV... I would imagaineÂ that if one hasn't read the books, they'd be suffering from a serious case of the WTF's
2577	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	I'm going to guess that you have never been in a real fight, nor have any kind of training in such. I have for the greater part of my life and I was exhausted just watching it.


No i haven't been in a fight...do i have to to have an opinion? No.
Â 
Maybe if the fight was exhausting, which im sure it was because those moves were pretty advanced, then they could have added more scenes where the viper was just playing with him, exhausting him like in the book. Slow it down a bit! there was just really cool move after move. I wanted to see the mountain's frustration! I didn't get that. I mean the spear fight choreo was awesome, the mountains not so much..
Â 
It just wasn't as good as it should have been in terms of how it was executed, the pace etc.Â
2578	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-02	OK can we just get Thoros of My in the crowd somewhere if were going to have to watch Qyburn work his magic. And don't give me that "don't think it works that way child" shit, Beric- give up the LOL juice.

Â 
I agree the pace was clearly faster than it the book but perhaps the producers didn't want it to be too slow either, as it might have annoyed the audience at some point, more than anything else. Instead they wanted the viewers at the edge of their seats, the better to shock them in the end by the unexpected turning point of the fight and the crushing of Oberyn's head.
Â 
The book scene is great but perhaps it would not have worked too well on TV. It's about finding the right balance I think, which they might or might not have in this episode. It's a matter of opinion.

2580	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-02	If I said yes...


I'd call bullshit considering I don't even think that's possible with human strength. Â
2581	Jasta11	2014-06-02	It's certainly the most horrific death in the series by its sheer brutality. The Red Wedding came close with Talisa getting stabbed in the belly, but there was no detail there,and the scene went on to other matters. Robb gets a few quarrels in his body then a short stabbing. Catelyn ''only'' suffers a sliced throat for like a second.
Â 
But for Oberyn, we have a lovingly detailed shot of losing half his teeth then screaming in pure agony while his eyes are being gouged. It's even more effective because he always was so sure of himself and in control since the very first time we saw him; suddenly he's a human wreck facing the last seconds of his life in excruciating pain. For me, it was extremely effective, and I can honestly say this is the first time I was as disturbed by something I saw on film/TV.
Â 
The head popping was over the top, however, mostly the sound it made. I guess an extremely strong man like the Mountain could crush a skull, but a skull still isn't a watermelon. You would imagine a sickening crunch, instead it sounded like Gregor was struggling to open a bottle of champagne. That said, Ellaria's wail of despair made up for it. She's a really good actress and I hope we see more of her.
Â 
All in all, as sickening as it was, it made for excellent TV. Sure, the choreography could have been better, but the scene got the point across, big time. The only time my Facebook flared up more was after the Red Wedding.
2582	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-02	I'd call bullshit considering I don't even think that's possible with human strength. Â 


It is possible...but you would be right because I've thankfully never seen a person die yet.Â
2583	teemo	2014-06-02	I thought this was way better than the RW. Â Even though they failed in building up tension just like the RW, at least a lot of the dialogue was spot-on and they didn't cut out Oberyn screaming for Elia. Â That would have been tragic. Â I felt like it showed the most respect to the book's writing than the show usually does. Â I can't believe some people are actually looking away and muting though. Â Are you really that fragile?

Oberyn knew exactly what he was getting into, his confidence doesn't change that. That's why he poisoned the spear. In case he didn't win the fight, and it's obviously a good back up.

Â 
I'm not fragile, I'm ok. with gore and blood. But Oberyn is a character I (and many others) got to love. It was terrible to watch and hear, because he didn't deserve that.

2587	Mad Monkey	2014-06-02	I'm not going to lie, I was kind of hoping that maybe the showrunners would decide to deviate from the books and have Oberyn turn Gregor into a shishkebab.

"Actually, it is perfectly possible to ram a spear through someone's belly and miss all vital organs, as anybody who has ever worked in a hospital will be able to tell you. Some people just have an incredible amount of luck. Also, this is the freakin' Mountain we're talking about."
Â 
Hey, I know it is. Now please let me find a reason at how "it's not freakin possible, how dared you killed Oberyn, Gregor should be DEAD!" =)
More seriously, yes it is the Mountain we are talking about and my only true reproach to the show : non readers don't grasp the ultimate threat the Mountain is supposed to be. It's one of the few things I really reproach to the show so far if I want to be picky. But I'm not. Because if you want to truelly experience this story, you have to read the books. I love the books =)Â

Awww... all that's missing is a caption "No hard feelings".
Â 


I thought it was weird that a kid was cleaning off Oberyn's spear. Â Was he wiping off the poison or something? Â Maybe some attention to Oberyn's spear would have been nice for some foreshadowing, but I guess they want to blindside people with that bit. Â [...]
Â 
Is it just me, or is the Mountain actually crushing Oberyn's skull a little over the top? Â Meaning, is that even possible? Â [...]
Â 
It's a shame we couldn't get a non-brothel Oberyn scene before his death instead of some of the really bad scenes they had in there. Â [...]


Â 
Concerning the poison: Actually, I think it was either the exact opposite (the cloth was trenched in poison) or the poison was on Oberyn's second spear (remember his first one broke during the duel).
Â 
Concerning the head crushing: Yes, it's possible if you exert enough force. Somebody like the Mountain can definitely do it. Remember the human head is essentially a number of bone plates fused together - those fusion points can't withstand everything.
Â 
Concerning Oberyn's scenes: You must have missed his conversations with Cersei and Tyrion then...

He knew he might die but I doubt he really understood how horrible his death was going to be. Hence the screaming. And no, I never said that. The person I was replying to was out to make it seem like Oberyn's death is somehow worse than death that happens in the real world and it's simply not. People go through immense suffering all the time and it was really insensitive and ignorant of that person to suggest it doesn't. But yeah, I'm so proud to have seen that shit. Get fucking real.Â

I meant in that episode...
2592	Gendrys Forge	2014-06-02	I guess ive seen too many liveleak videos of Taliban getting their heads blown off, people setting themselves on fire and being gored by animals, ect like nancy boy up there.Â  People saying they couldn't sleep, or had nightmares after that, wow, really?
2593	Zman1863	2014-06-02	I think my conclusion is that the duel was adequate but could have been better. I don't know much about choreography or direction, but even I noticed that there were a lot of cuts, and I think the scene lacked some of the emotional depth of the book. The Mountain is essentially silent until the end. I also think they could have used the Tyrion/Oberyn breakfast scene as set up. I have no objection to the beetles scene on its own, but since they usually have no problem lapping up Kings Landing scenes, I could have used one more here.Â 
Â 
A minor quibble, I didn't feel like vomiting when I read the scene, but I think it would have been appropriate if Tyrion had seeing it put to screen. It's like that classic scene in animal house when Flounder throws up on the Dean Wormer because they're all going to be expelled.Â

well not everyone watched videos of taliban getting their heads blown off, people setting themselves on fire and being gored by animals.
2596	James Arryn	2014-06-02	I thought it really delivered. A few things I'd want different, but then it wasn't directed for me.
There are IMO 5 levels of criticism.
Pedantic adherence to books. For example, the countless criticisms of the non-puking. Like what?  No one who had not read the books would in any way, shape or form miss the absence of puke. It's a non difference. 
Desire to be faithful to the emotional impact of the scene: this is where it let me down just a bit. I agree it needed a bit more length and build-up, and in my mind's eye Oberyn's death isn't about being cocky so much as the fact that at that point, he's basically communing with the dead/excoriating a lifetime of pain and anger. He builds up to it during the fight and as he wins, he's peaking. So he's almost high. The 'Elia' scream in my mind signifies this. But I'm not sure how well that would communicate to tv. But this came off a bit more grounded and his focus on Tywin gave it a realistic alternative.
Desire to be faithful to the aesthetics/rationale of the scene: in this area it both worked better and worse than I expected. Worse in the somewhat less emphasis on bleeding/tiring the Mountain out. In my mind the book fight is a bit like a bull fight. A conscious, very considered approach to overcome physical power and resilience. So it lacked that a bit.
But where for me it worked better than expected was the whirling and other stuff others seemed to hate. To me, that was very snake like. I've had a couple snakes come at me in the wild, and the visual effect is slight confusion because of how much seemingly extraneous movement is involved, and the way that will suddenly switch to straight ahead snap. Which was how Oberyn's ultimate strike seemed to me: the sudden death strike. So, good and bad. I agree that the Mountain didn't seem as ominous as he needs to be. I am less bothered than some by his sudden recovery. Without the need to replicate the exact 'reaching from the depths' sense the books give that sequence, IMO this could easily be him conserving his dwindling resources given the fact that he has a spear in him. Not exactly playing possum, but going with plan B once plan A had failed.
Desire to be faithful to characters. I thought this was well done. Pascal's smile throughout was just the right touch for me...celebrating the moment of finally being here, finally doing this, and seeing it play out as he had imagined it. Also contempt for the city/land/culture he was forced to step into to get the job done. 
Another touch that worked for me was Jamie's evident approval. More than anyone in the books, Jamie's life revolved around fighting, judging others according to their fighting skill, using fighting metaphors. Selmy comes closest, but he has other issues which occupy his mind. So Jaime the fighter, watching the Red Viper's courage, control, skill and intelligence fighting...well, he would be half smiling. And there's the sense that 'my brother might win this' which I don't think he expected to feel. Of the cut away shots, it was imo the most effective.
Lastly, there's the kind of discussions I remember from film school. Which are great, in their way...but the technical informs the auteur, I was taught to believe, so the first question you ask is: what is the audience feeling? Is it what the director wanted? Seeing is a door to feeling, not it's own room. If you convey that feeling with a Lean sunrise, awesome. It's easier for us to understand the road the director took us down to get there. But whether it's the strength of the books characters or the charisma of the actor, or w/e, while watching I felt a sense of dread and extreme empathy, and an unrealistic part of me hoped somehow it wouldn't end as I knew it would end while simultaneously hoping this would just go on and on. 
So for me, job done director.

2597	RuthBolton	2014-06-02	I laughed the first time I watched, I think because of the balloon-pop head. I went back and watched it slowly and there was a literal explosion moment. I don't doubt that HafA3or is capable of crushing a skull with both hands, but bursting one? Who knows.
The scene was so beautifully paced and horrifying and yet satisfying in the books I expected to hate it on screen, and for the most part it was decent, if far from perfect. They kept the majority of the great dialogue, and conveyed the horror. Ellaria's face and scream were great, and I liked watching Jaime watch.
I think Gregor would have been scarier with a bucket helm with nothing but slits, but obliterating somebody's head kind of makes you scary no matter what. The tension was better than it was with the Red Wedding, at least.
ETA if I were unsullied, I think the only point I would have disliked would have been the head pop. Without the book in mind it was a pretty significant scene, despite the problems many have mentioned.

2598	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	I agree with zman1863
Â 
sj41yÂ I'm not saying the fighting wasn't executed properly, the editing of it was mediocre. How it was executed in terms of post-production.Â
2599	Frostking	2014-06-02	The fight was good and despite the recent lack of Gregor in the show I found this much more satisfying than the RW, which was a huge disappointment (the whole Talisa thing and lack of any of the other named northern lords/ladies hurt that). Â I thought Pedro was the great. Â Still hurts even knowing Oberyn had to die. Â The Red Wedding frustrated me but in the end was brilliant. Â Ned's failings in King's Landing were brilliant. Â The Lannisters successfully defeating Stannis was brilliant. Â But killing Oberyn off the way he did sucked. Â
2600	Frostking	2014-06-02	Oberyn's death also never made sense to me since someone who had been through the life experiences he had and had founded a successful sellsword company wouldn't conduct himself like such an idiot in a combat situation, whatever his agenda. Â It's not like Ned being a good soldier but unfit to rule - Oberyn is known to be a good soldier and it's silly to then write him as dying like a careless fool.

My sense is that surviving was or at least became a secondary motive to him. This was an exorcism and seance as much as a fight, for him. 
He's never going to get the chance to lay the blame where he feels it rests again. This is a one time opportunity. The Mountain dying would only satisfy a small part of what he wants out of this. If it was just winning or killing, poison could get that done with a lot less risk. He wants a lot more than a win, and barring the Mountain's superhumanity, he likely gets it at that point without too much risk. Spear through the cardio-vascular system is usually a pretty powerful sedative.
2602	Joseph Nobles	2014-06-02	It should be said that the scene took five days to do because they had to wait each day for the right light. But as for me, I and my Unsullied TV watching buddy both thought the scene was fantastic. My only quibble was the Mountain collapsing back down after killing Oberyn. My buddy thought he'd died, too. And I guess he could have, but clearly Oberyn died first. It would have been good to see the Mountain panting after he fell back, though. Anyway - good job, D&D and all them and everybody!
2603	James Arryn	2014-06-03	To comment on the comparison with Rob Roy:
Agreed it's the best of all time. (Fans of Hobbs' work would enjoy an earlier examination of a similar realism in the Duelists.)
However, a lot of the space the Rob Roy fight gets to breathe, it earned in the movie leading up to it. So in addition to the realism and sense of exhaustion and sweat and tangible fear, those spaces are also filled with inner thoughts we as the audience are riding along with the characters. We know how each think. We know each are deadly in their own way, we know each if them know it of the other, and we quickly understand the evolution of each fighter's strategy. When Roy adopts the shoulder-roof defensive stance, we see his desperation and that is also quickly followed by Cunningham's exploitation of the inner/outer angle. He has always been confident; now he knows he will win. 
That's all powerfully conveyed, but I doubt it has the same impact if it were secondary characters, nor do I feel most directors would trust it to do so in that case. Additionally, the Mountain is semi-superhuman, so it ought to require semi-extreme exhaustion for the right pay-off, and I doubt the average non-reader would retain enough interest. Maybe more trust pays off with a better scene, but I think this hit a nice middle-point between testing that and short-cutting too much. 
Personally, if it were made for me, I'd have the fight and periphery take up 2/3 of the episode, but I don't think most viewers would enjoy it as much. Don't want to get into studies on tv audience attention spans as differing from film fans, but it might be a consideration. I do agree that the shortened episode seems a bit of a waste.

2604	majgat	2014-06-03	Saw the duel yesterday. I felt overwhelmed by the graphic death of Oberyn when the credits rolled. Which is a good thing. The fight itself could have been a little bit longer. In SoS, I imagined Oberyn going at Gregor again and again.
From my point of view, he was all over him. And the buld up? Fricking beetles? Non-existing Orson Lannister? I just hoped Jamie and Tyrion would stop talking and get on with it. And the most dissapointing moment for me is just mentioning
Oberyn's nickname. "Red Viper of Dorne, he must be baddass to have a nickname like this" what a joke....

Weird, I loved that. 
Imminent fatal decision plus time equals extreme desperation and plumbing anything for significance.
2606	IlAovatar	2014-06-03	What's with all the talk of Rob Roy? Aside from having an underwhelming and predictable ending, the pacing for that fight just wouldn't be right for a fight involving the Mountain in my opinion.
2607	SuperTechmarine	2014-06-03	A bit too quick and too short.
Â 
Otherwise, Oberyn's death was horrific. The sound of his head being crushed...Jesus.
2608	Red Raven	2014-06-03	Oberyn's death also never made sense to me since someone who had been through the life experiences he had and had founded a successful sellsword company wouldn't conduct himself like such an idiot in a combat situation, whatever his agenda. Â It's not like Ned being a good soldier but unfit to rule - Oberyn is known to be a good soldier and it's silly to then write him as dying like a careless fool.


Â 
He should have used his spear to poke out both of Gregor's eyes and/or grabbed his sword and cut Gregor's arms off before taunting him in earnest. Â Even then, if he just had to wrench a confession, do so well out of arm's reach.
2609	Ravi Seaworth	2014-06-03	The mountain is no ordinary foe. Still, I agree that they could have extended the fight a little more, but not much more. The choreography worked with me. I think it showed how skilled Oberyn is as a fighter, and the end was a parallel with the bee story.

2610	The Emberheart	2014-06-03	It seems the director said:
I storyboarded it for, "This is when we're going to use Pedro, and this is when we're going to need some kind of a head that can implode." I sent our makeup supervisor off and he built this head to use for the shots. Then the visual effects guys took it home by putting a little swelling in the head, and making the one eye look really bad. The last composition that we barely got before the sun went down was of the two of them lying dead  the effects team made that even more gruesome. They rearranged some of his brain matter.

So he let it slip the mountain died there and then already? The show might deviate from the books on how the Mountain dies. No poison then, just his wounds?

Â 
Or he's just not spoiling that the Mountain is alive. Or he doesn't even know - is it important for the director of one episode to know that Gregor is dying of poison in the finale?Â
2612	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-03	It was a stupid scene. It was written poorly in the book and showed poorly in the show. The amount of pain from having your teeth smashed out would have been enough, but you're not going to get your fucking fingers very deep into a man's eyes, and hence his brain, without his brain actually shutting down and nothing coming out of his mouth because he's likely brain dead. Certainly not to the point that apparently the human head is a giant zit waiting to be squeezed. Fucking stupid.

Your eyes are beneath your brain, not in front of it.
2613	Veltigar	2014-06-03	What's with all the talk of Rob Roy? Aside from having an underwhelming and predictable ending, the pacing for that fight just wouldn't be right for a fight involving the Mountain in my opinion.


The duel at the end of Rob Roy is one of the greatest (if not greatest) fights over put on film. Why? First of all because it was properly build-up throughout the whole movie. The fight styles, prowess and weaknesses of both combatants were established before they actually engaged in combat. In other words, they made you care for both the fighters and the actual duel.
Â 
Secondly, the flow of the fight was realistic. Very intense in the beginning, before the weight of the swords and the exercise tired them out. And throughout the duel there were longer and longer pauzes and they got slower, because both participants got more exhausted.Â 
Â 
On top of that, the moves of the duelists were realistic. They actually tried to hit each other (a glaring problem in many Hollywood films) and when Tim Roth landed one of his cuts, Neeson bled. And that affected the fight after that, since Neeson acted like a wounded man fighting (not like this Mountain shit who can still move so nimble after he's been speared through the gut).
Â 
And finally, the duel in Rob Roy showed how important it is to use your brains. When Roth and Neeson clashed swords, Roth had the upper hand because he was smarter. He was like a chessplayer, found the opening and landed his cut. This is how Oberyn should have fought, with precision and small adjustments and sidesteps to keep the Mountain at bay. All those ridiculous twists and spins were plain dumb, because Oberyn just tired himself out, without actually achieving something.
Â 
Oh, and one minor issue. In Rob Roy the participants used weapons and gear that suited them and the situation. They didn't wear helmets and armour because it was a duel. And each used the weapon that they could fight the best with. In GoT on the other hand, the Mountain has this nonsensical helmet, which doesn't do anything but fall off (instead of you know, just having him wear no helmet at all) and he fights without a shield! WTF wa up with that, he just looked plain silly. Either let him use both hands to wield that sword or give him a shield, not that akwkard combo of no shield and one hand on his sword.
2614	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-06-03	If I recall correctly, in the books Gregor only hit Oberyn once, and with that one blow he smashed his head. But, here in the TV show, the Mountain swat his skull like the hippo bites the watermelon. It was gruesomely awesome
2615	Talleyrand	2014-06-03	If I recall correctly, in the books Gregor only hit Oberyn once, and with that one blow he smashed his head. But, here in the TV show, the Mountain swat his skull like the hippo bites the watermelon. It was gruesomely awesome 


In the books he shoves his fingers into Oberyn's eyes, punches in his teeth and then crushes his skull

Right?
Â 
I avoided saying anything because so many people seemed to put it on an altar,Â butÂ man that was a dumb fight. The pacing was glaciel and the ending was really stupid.
Â 
Certainly not anything to look to when comparing a fight between a guy who is supposed to be incredibly fast with an unconventional fighting style against a guy who is a brutal and terrifying warrior using a claymore with one hand.
Â 
What a ridiculous example of how this duel should have went. Thank the gods the people on this site aren't responsible for adapting this show.
2618	petertel123	2014-06-03	wasn't jaime supposed to be the greatest fighter in the seven kingdoms? from the fight scenes of jaime and oberyn I'd say that oberyn would rip him to shreds
2619	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-03	Sadly show Jaime is apparently a shitty fighter and a joke. See Brienne laughing at him and saying his reputation was all lies, Ned Stark shitting on him about not fighting in tournaments because he's got some Northern ninja shit or something and every character he meets saying he's a loser who would be nothing if his daddy didn't protect him with his gold and influence.Â 
Â 
So it makes sense that he has no idea about Oberyn...or the Mountain...or fighting.Â 


Â 
I do have to LOL at that observation.Â  I was a wee bit pissed at the Brienne putting him down thing, afterall.....she spends lots of time in the books reminiscing what a good fight it was, regardless of him being weakened from the dungeons of Riverrun.Â  After that mess, I can forgive TVJaime for not knowing how well that The Red Viper may or may not do against The Mountain.Â 
Â 
In my first rewatch just now, I did notice that Mountain at first pulled Oberyn onto him a bit, then turned him over.Â  I get the feeling that it would have been too awkward to shoot with Oberyn on top for the whole face and head mashing job.Â
2620	Gendrys Forge	2014-06-03	Lol, at one point when the viper hits him with the spear, there is an unmistakeable sound effect of a bullet ricocheting off of something.
2621	WTFSalami	2014-06-03	The Jaime/Brienne fight would have been a perfect fight to model after the Rob Roy one, but not Oberyn and Gregor.
2622	Shadrich	2014-06-03	I repeat again - I feel like I tire myself out but.
Â 
This is a TV show for television - the scene took 3 days of shooting in the Croatian sun. This wasn't the grand finale of a 200 million pound film, this was one of five or six huge moments on a 10 hour long TV show. Game of Thrones is at a huge disadvantage in the fact that the storyline is spoiled for alot of the fanbase yet it still amazes me and I look forward to it every week.
Â 


Â 
It doesn't cost 200 million pounds to film a good duel. The duel between Bronn and Vardis Egen in Season 1 I felt was executed properly (or good enough at least). The duel between Oberyn and Gregor was short, unrealistic, senseless and had lack of build up, and the actor who played Gregor was awful (well, he's not even an actor).

Â 
Jaime does say that there are probably 3 people in the 7 kingdoms who could beat him in a fight...
assuming one is Barristan
at that time when he said it, there was a lot of hype about Loras Tyrell, so it is possible he's the second
no idea who the third could have been...i would like to say Oberyn, but Jaime confessed to having no idea of his skill...

Â
2626	AIex	2014-06-03	Does anyone else think that Oberyns death was a bit too extreme? I'm ok with some of the gore, I remember Gregor gouging one of his eyes out while crushing his head with the other one in the books, so that's ok I guess, but it was the screaming and that exploding head which almost made me vomit if I'm honest.
Â 
The battle itself was really cool imo, but they shouldve had Oberyn stay quiet during his death.. wouldve been pretty awesome if had they changed the plot a bit and made him say something like "have fun dying" right before he dies... it felt so bad watching a badass like Oberyn scream like a little girl, I mean of course that shit hurts and everyone would scream, but I'm sure a little lack of realism wouldnt have hurt anyone at that point.
Second thing I didnt like was the head explosion... its definitely possible for a head to explode like that, but not the way Gregor killed him. It would certainly explode like that if Gregor punched him with all of his strength or really slammed his head onto the ground, but as far as I can tell he just squashed his head gradually.. you can literally see his fingers slowly sinking in. The skull shouldve just broken, not exploded like a damn firecracker.
Pretty weird how everyone only started screaming after Oberyns head exploded... I'd be screaming like a baby if my husband's eyes were being gouged out, but overall I really liked the fight. Don't think I'll watch it entirely again though because it makes me wanna cry how this brilliant scene just turns into the most disgusting and brutal death within a matter of seconds... Oberyn is just such an amazing character.
Â 
One more thing though: I really hope we'll get to see atleast one scene of Gregor slowly dying because of the poison and screaming loud enough for the whole red keep to hear it.. that would be pretty satisfying.

The Mountain or the Hound. I doubt he even thought of Oberyn, and aside from that, acting cocky like Oberyn does against a smarter and quicker fighter in Jamie would get him dealt with rather easily anyway.

Â 
Nope, violence should be off putting. Â When you water it down and take away the severity is when it becomes irresponsible.

Â 
i cant really say....Jaime's pretty cocky too if you remember from his fight with Ned...as for speed, again Oberyn's pretty fast, especially at dodging..
Â 
both of them with swords, jaime might have the drop on Oberyn...but jaime's sword vs. vipers spear...Oberyn might have had the better of Jaime since he's more patient than Jaime
2630	sj4iy	2014-06-03	Nope, violence should be off putting. Â When you water it down and take away the severity is when it becomes irresponsible.Agreed. Also, I don't think it was gore for the sake of gore like we see in horror films...this was a character we cared about fighting on behalf of another character we care about.Admittedly, I was queasy afterwards and would never wish to watch that scene again, but I don't think it was done in bad taste or anything like that. And it will be the start of a massive change in the entire story, so I'm fine with it.
2631	Ser Not Appearing	2014-06-03	I've rewatched the duel once now. Satisfying overall. 
Only major gripe is aesthetic - didn't like how absolutely still the Mountain was, then he's full of life and his voice is strong, then he rolled over and is so still again. Effect was something of a brief full resurrection instead of pained, labored and powerful last gasp/grasp.
Minor gripes to the way Oberyn was knocked down a few times, the dramatic fall before he was crushed and the curled-hands-clutching-at-face, full-on 70's horror movie scream from his lady as his head was crushed. Again, mostly aesthetics.
The tone and overall fight was ok, I didn't mind the editing and was surprisingly OK with the twirly flamboyance of Oberyn. I give their portrayal a "good enough" grade.
Much of the rest of the episode was blah.

Â 
I agree.
Â 
I really hope they'll stay close to the books when it comes to Cersei's and Jaime's chapters during AffC and AdwD and include that one scene of Arienne and Doran though. Fighting, gore and all that stuff is cool, but those really deep dialogues are just great, in the books and the show. As of now, Oberyn and Tyrion talking in the dungeon is probably my favourite moment in this season because it is so emotional and brilliantly done by the actors.

2635	Onion Seaworth	2014-06-03	So some people are disappointed....what a shock, Â Â 
Â 
I think it was done atleast 10 times better in the show then the book...and I have read the book before this season even started
Â 
Why?
Â 
1. The fight
It was awesome and REALISTIC believe it or not, the reason it was ''short'' was because you cant fight someone as large as Gregor or someone as fast as Oberyn without getting tired, every time Oberyn dodged he must have really gotten tired, and The mountain swinging his sword would have been one thing if he hit but let me tell you missing a target drains more stamina then actually hitting your target. I have been in fights since a young age and I know that the majority of fights lasts about 2-4 minutes in real life, it should be even shorter with weapons...but I dont fight with weapons. the reason is simply that during bar fights, you just wail on eachother, during MMA and Boxing you got rules to follow and you fight someone equal to you. But the fight between Oberyn and the mountain are not between Equals, Lightweight champion vs Heavyweight Champion.
Â 
2. More brutality. The book disappointed here when I re read it just for this purpose. Gregor Grabs him and punches him a few times untill his head is crushed. (which you don't get detail on FTM. It just said that after Gregor hit Oberyn Tyrion throws up, and Ellaria screams. The show made this so much better, up cloes disturbing footage of oberyns head getting crushed, it made me wish for more like this in Mortal Kombats Fatalities
Â 
3. The scream, I am impervious to gore pretty much, During Ramsays torture scenes on Theon I found myself smiling, during the Flaying on the Ironborn I smiled, Why cause I think it's cool. But this head crushing was beyond words... I went from  to D: in a few seconds the gore, i could handle, but Oberyns scream made this scene so much more powerful then the book did. and guess what, If you got eye gouged by a man who is the 2nd strongest man in the world and weighs more then 5 of you, and whos hands are as big as your face, your head would be a fucking paste, within seconds, and guess what it hurts, and guess what, you would cry and piss yourself and scream like a girl.
Â 
It's realistic as fuck for that matter, Now In the book The Mountain is Bigger and Stronger then Thor is no? so Guess what, the pressure from his weight and strength woulf pop your head like a zit, not even that but Thor could probably do the same.
Â 
Â 
So please get of your horses, 
Â 
(complaints i have heard from random people)
Â 
the camera angles, i agree with, it skipped to much between cameras, but they did not break the 180 rule, so i can live with it.
The ineffective armor, well... sure... But it did still show that he could not pierce his armor unless oberyn used his full weight on his spear.
The many cuts: -.- really.... The many cuts is there for a reason, it's there so people will think Oberyn will prevail, and defeat the mountain with ease.
The mountain Surviving the spear thrust: It happens EXACTLY LIKE THAT IN THE BOOKS he gets pinned to the ground.
Â 
Â 
Give credit where credit is due, I know most of you see the book as a bible, but seriously, I re read and rewatched this enough times to know that this time the show triumphed.
Â 
Of course you are entitled to your opinion... but some of you seem to bash this for something that was unreallistic just to find flaws.
And you should not care about realism in a show with magic and dragons...and even if you do THIS WAS REALISTIC, if you are comparing it to what happens in the books and what would happen in actual real life.

Damn right i enjoy gore in Video games and movies.
It's Gritty, dark and powerful.
There are ofcourse limits to what even I can endure. Guro for example makes me sick to my stomach. But when Gorey violence is done right it's a pure bliss.
And anything tha hurts me or makes me a bit horrified, scared, angry makes me smile... i dunno why. defense mechanism perhaps? (works well during fights lemme tell you)
But enough psychology.
Â 
I gave my opinions why I think the show did it better.

I did not mean it like that. I just meant that it's astonishing how people can't seem to enjoy something so masterfully improved as what GoT did with Oberyns death.

Â 
The majority of this board complained about Season 1 which was about as close to the books you can possibly get. Go read the Season 1 threads, at least people now bring up decent points rather than complain about hair or eye color. It's just the nature of the fandom, best ignore it if you can't stand it.
2645	petertel123	2014-06-03	The Mountain or the Hound. I doubt he even thought of Oberyn, and aside from that, acting cocky like Oberyn does against a smarter and quicker fighter in Jamie would get him dealt with rather easily anyway.


jaime quicker? in the books perhaps but in the series he's not even close to oberyn

Â 
two words....HULK....SMASH!!!Â  
Â 
joking aside though, while yes the spear tip did go through the gut, not necessarily hit the spine...could have been off one side of the spine...the way he swings him on top requires immense deltoid and chest strength, safe to say he's got that even when he's flat on his back...you dont bench 500lbs without immense chest and shoulders...
Â 
after knocking teeth out, he just rolled on top and pushed himself up using push-up motion...and pressed down on the skull...

Â 
There's no reason to state conclusively that Gregor was stabbed through the spine given the angles we have.
2655	Seneti	2014-06-03	Agreed. Also, I don't think it was gore for the sake of gore like we see in horror films...this was a character we cared about fighting on behalf of another character we care about.
Admittedly, I was queasy afterwards and would never wish to watch that scene again, but I don't think it was done in bad taste or anything like that. And it will be the start of a massive change in the entire story, so I'm fine with it.


Â 
Fully agree. I don't ever want to watch that scene again, but not because I didn't like it, but because I know I'm too squeamish and would probably throw up if I did.

Â 
Agreed. Probably missed the spine. It's even possible to spear somebody through the gut and miss all vital organs (although major blood vessels are also a concern here). As for why he managed to get up that quickly to finish Oberyn... adrenaline?

2657	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-03	Â 
Oberyn knew exactly what he was getting into, his confidence doesn't change that. That's why he poisoned the spear. In case he didn't win the fight, and it's obviously a good back up.
Â 


I agree. Plus, how likely was it that he would end up being brutally killed by Gregor's fists as opposed to his Greatsword? The way Oberyn went was certainly a worst case scenario (in terms of pain). The fact that he thickened the poison proves that he had the backup plan. Thickening poison would have no purpose if Gregor died in the duel. In no way am I saying he expected to die, but if he was 100% confident he would get out of the fight alive then why even bother with it?Â

2659	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-03	My sense is that surviving was or at least became a secondary motive to him. This was an exorcism and seance as much as a fight, for him.
He's never going to get the chance to lay the blame where he feels it rests again. This is a one time opportunity. The Mountain dying would only satisfy a small part of what he wants out of this. If it was just winning or killing, poison could get that done with a lot less risk. He wants a lot more than a win, and barring the Mountain's superhumanity, he likely gets it at that point without too much risk. Spear through the cardio-vascular system is usually a pretty powerful sedative.


I 100% agree with everything you said here. I don't get when people attribute Oberyn's defeat to stupidity. If he simply wanted to win the duel he could've done so. He wanted more than that.Â
2660	Gendrys Forge	2014-06-03	I thought it was pretty clear the kid was poisoning the blade.Â  I mean not only was he wiping it down, but he was wearing thick gloves to do it.

2662	The_Gallows_Knight	2014-06-03	I was kind of underwhelming to be honest. I thought there were too many cuts, too much twirling and jumping, I didn't like the eye-gouging and think they should have stuck with the face crushing punch and the gore was kind of ridiculous.
And I think they should have done more to build up towards the fight earlier in the episode.
2663	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-06-03	I'm not sure whether it was the acting or choreography, but the Mountain looked more like a clumsy oaf than a seasoned fighter. Â I particularly liked when he disarmed his opponent and knocked him down, then tried to finish him off by... scraping his sword across the ground like a moron? Â Perhaps he saw a few of those pesky beetles?
Â 
I was initially turned off by Pascal's overly jovial attitude toward the encounter, but when he screamed "You raped her!" I got chills. Â Damn, that guy was awesome.
Â 
As usual, the whole sequence felt a little bit rushed. Â It's one thing for D&D to make sure nothing interesting happens until the very end of an episode, but I don't understand why they don't at least try to extend the lone interesting scene. Â Curious...
2664	Wsaharan	2014-06-03	I'm too traumatized to re-watch the fight scene for a better analysis, so correct me if I'm wrong, but my initial thoughts are as follows:
Â 
Swinging a two-handed sword with one hand might work in the books, but on screen it just looks clumsy. You don't use a sword like that in real life. No stabbing or holding the blade, just wild slow swings.
Â 
Also, too much twirling
Â 
With that said: Wow. But the screams. Oh god the screams.
Â 


Â 
I was initially turned off by Pascal's overly jovial attitude toward the encounter, but when he screamed "You raped her!" I got chills. Â Damn, that guy was awesome.
Â 


Â 
Agree, I was like "stop smiling! the man raped your sister." But in the end... Oh my.
2665	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-03	I watched it again for the 5th time. They did an amazing job. I love how the camera keeps cutting back to Jaime and how he starts smiling more and more as Oberyn is wining. I love how Tyrion is so worried when he doesn't finish him quickly.Â
2666	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-03	If Tyrion had vomited, I probably would have, too. My stomach was queasy enough as it was, seeing someone wretch at that moment would have pushed me over the edge.





Does anyone else think that Oberyns death was a bit too extreme? I'm ok with some of the gore, I remember Gregor gouging one of his eyes out while crushing his head with the other one in the books, so that's ok I guess, but it was the screaming and that exploding head which almost made me vomit if I'm honest.
Â 
The battle itself was really cool imo, but they shouldve had Oberyn stay quiet during his death.. wouldve been pretty awesome if had they changed the plot a bit and made him say something like "have fun dying" right before he dies... it felt so bad watching a badass like Oberyn scream like a little girl, I mean of course that shit hurts and everyone would scream, but I'm sure a little lack of realism wouldnt have hurt anyone at that point.





Fully agree. I don't ever want to watch that scene again, but not because I didn't like it, but because I know I'm too squeamish and would probably throw up if I did.

2669	Jasta11	2014-06-03	The duel at the end of Rob Roy is one of the greatest (if not greatest) fights over put on film. Why? First of all because it was properly build-up throughout the whole movie. The fight styles, prowess and weaknesses of both combatants were established before they actually engaged in combat. In other words, they made you care for both the fighters and the actual duel.
Â 
Secondly, the flow of the fight was realistic. Very intense in the beginning, before the weight of the swords and the exercise tired them out. And throughout the duel there were longer and longer pauzes and they got slower, because both participants got more exhausted.Â 
Â 
On top of that, the moves of the duelists were realistic. They actually tried to hit each other (a glaring problem in many Hollywood films) and when Tim Roth landed one of his cuts, Neeson bled. And that affected the fight after that, since Neeson acted like a wounded man fighting (not like this Mountain shit who can still move so nimble after he's been speared through the gut).
Â 
And finally, the duel in Rob Roy showed how important it is to use your brains. When Roth and Neeson clashed swords, Roth had the upper hand because he was smarter. He was like a chessplayer, found the opening and landed his cut. This is how Oberyn should have fought, with precision and small adjustments and sidesteps to keep the Mountain at bay. All those ridiculous twists and spins were plain dumb, because Oberyn just tired himself out, without actually achieving something.
Â 
Oh, and one minor issue. In Rob Roy the participants used weapons and gear that suited them and the situation. They didn't wear helmets and armour because it was a duel. And each used the weapon that they could fight the best with. In GoT on the other hand, the Mountain has this nonsensical helmet, which doesn't do anything but fall off (instead of you know, just having him wear no helmet at all) and he fights without a shield! WTF wa up with that, he just looked plain silly. Either let him use both hands to wield that sword or give him a shield, not that akwkard combo of no shield and one hand on his sword.


Â 
And I think the duel in GoT/ASoIaF was better. Why? Because I knew Liam Neeson would win the moment I saw him as a Brave Scot in a kilt and his enemy as a Snooty Brit with a wig. He's The Hero against The Villain and The Hero wins because it's Hollywood. I never saw the movie and knew who would win before it even began. The actors can choreograph like they were born with swords in hands, the tension can be built up to ridiculous levels, the stakes can be sky-high, the filmography can give a cinema intern an orgasm, but if you know by convention that The Hero wins then it doesn't help that much to make it a great watch.
Â 
By contrast, the GoT duel might fail a bit on the technical side (mostly Oberyn and his useless jumping around, the Mountain not having a shield is understandable as he wears plate), but it broke the watcher's expectations and went all-out. I knew the outcome of course, but all of the show is a cut above almost anything I saw in mainstream cinema simply because The Hero doesn't always win in the end. The tension this adds cannot be described. A big budget film would never show anything close to the brutality of the Viper vs mountain duel, or have the ''good guy'' lose because he made a stupid mistake and die screaming.
Â 
And honesty I don't see the Rob Roy duel as anything special. Sure, there was tension, but I found Oberyn going from playful to vengeful and angry much more compelling than the usual stoic stares of Liam Neeson. The ''no, no, no, you can't die yet, you haven't confessed'' line was great. And if we're going to nitpick on realism, how many completely superfluous parries were in that duel? Each combatant had a dozen windows to finish the other off but they just parried because it made for better cinema. Plus, the villain's shoulder was split open and there's barely any blood? Cmon.
Â 
Seriously, you don't need to like the scene at all, but acting like Rob Roy should be everyone's golden standard is annoying and you and Ran have been doing it all thread long. Can we talk about something else?

Had Rob Roy wanted to break new ground and do something worth talking about, Roth would have dominated the fight from the beginning, and finished Neeson off with a slow Needle-to-Polliver's-throat like maneuver. Instead...whatever, seen it a million times. 
Not to mention how goofy the last few seconds of that duel was. Rolled my eyes so hard I almost passed out.

2672	Aether	2014-06-03	I'm pretty surprised at how much hate this fight scene is getting. Â I thought it was basically perfect. Â The only somewhat important difference is that he crushes his skull instead of smashing it with a gauntlet, but a 420+ pound man wearing several hundred pounds of armour putting all of his weight and strength on your face with your head pressed against cement... Â  it's not at all unbelievable that he could obliterate his skull like that.
Â 
People complaining that he shouldn't have been able to move after being stabbed, just don't have a very firm grasp of how resilient the human body can be. Â There are people who get shot in the brain and survive, people who get stabbed dozens of times and carry their own intestines to the emergency room and survive.. Â Go watch a show called "I survived..." Â It's just one story after another of people suffering grizzly injuries and managing somehow to survive. Â It's not like when you get stabbed your whole body just shuts down instantly. Â He would be in great pain and his strength would drain as he lost blood from the wound, but it's again, really not out of the question that he could still have the strength to pull down a man who weighs about 300 pounds less than him and smash his face in.
Â 
I'm surprised tbh. Â If this scene wasn't accurate enough for you, my suspicion is that no adaptation of the story will ever be good enough or close enough to the books for you.

Tsss, such poor taste. Oberyn vs. the Mountain could have had that shock effect you claim it had (did anyone really expect Oberyn to win that in the books? Tyrion already escaped once and his role in KL was done. Didn't expect Oberyn to lose in the way he did, but I thought Greg would make mince meat of him) and still be executed to perfection technically. Or at least in a manner that wasn't as braindead as this piece of shit.
2674	D-A-C	2014-06-03	Well, I have talked to death about my disappointment with how it turned out so I won't go on repeating myself. Also, I'll be the one to say it, I don't give a damn about Rob Roy, I come here to discuss game of thrones.
Â 
I understand you guys are paralleling back and forth about it as an example of a well choreographed fight blah, blah, its not the only decent duel in cinematic history, move on already.
Â 
Â 
Anyway, can we all agree, that now what GRRM has to do is write a book detailing the adventures of Oberyn from sleeping with a nobles daughter and gaining his nickname in the ensuing duel, to his adventures in Essos learning about poisons and possibly magic, fighting in the slave pits, taking many, many lovers with Ellaria Sand etc.
Â 
Then we need Pedro Pascal back to film it all 
Â 
We can surely all agree on that?

The duel was a snooze-fest, I never thought Oberyn was in any danger of losing until he did, which makes the ending shocking, but doesn't make the duel suspenseful. Â The fact that it looked like it was tacked on to the end of the episode that was supposed to have it as the main feature didn't help.
2678	yushkevitch	2014-06-03	On second viewing I stick by my earlier observation on why the ending seemed cartoonish: When The Mountain lifts him it looks like Oberyn is a mannequin, his body is completely stiff and seems to be levitating as Clegane holds him up by the neck and punches him.Â 
Â 
I know it's real nitpicking but those few seconds made the entire ending of the fight lose it's impact for me. Again, I applaud the director for attempting a very difficult scene to film but they just missed.

I'm sorry... it just fits my name so perfectly.Â
2681	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-03	I watched it again for the 5th time. They did an amazing job. I love how the camera keeps cutting back to Jaime and how he starts smiling more and more as Oberyn is wining. I love how Tyrion is so worried when he doesn't finish him quickly.Â 


Yep no "I'm feeling more innocent by the instant."Â
2682	pleonasm	2014-06-03	A couple of others thoughts regarding the duel.
Â 
1. The absence / multiple re-casts of the Mountain didn't do the duel scene any favors, nor did the relative lack of screen time of both fighters in the actual episode. A few quick of scenes of both fighters prepping for the battle would have done wonders for the actual dual itself. Especially given the non-entity that the Mountain has been in the series since Season 1 (we all have conveniently forgotten his completely unmemorable appearances in Season 2). Instead we get 5 minutes of Cousin Orson... ugghh.
Â 
2. The duel itself felt very rushed. This was a big moment in the show, building for multiple episodes, indulge... amp the tension, let us see them exhaust themselves, let us hear some commentary from the crowd (instead of the mostly stoic glances from Tywin and Cersei).
Â 
3. For me the most horrific part of the book scene isn't the Mountain head crushing Oberyn, its once the Mountain gains the upper hand, he yells out his confession "I killed the welps. I raped her. I killed her!" That is truly gut wrenching. I wanted that.

2683	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-03	That avatar is pretty funny, if anything. It doesn't look remotely real. It's so obviously a rubber dummy head.
2684	Er Rn	2014-06-03	This, along with Baelor, are the two episodes of this series I never want to watch again. Too heartbreaking.  
The duel itself was ok. I didn't care for all the jumping spin moves over and over. The gouging of the eyes was too much. 
I do wish that rather than Tyrion and Jaime making fun of the mentally handicapped for 5 min we would've had more time with him and Ellaria beforehand. We've had numerous brothel scenes all season but we couldn't get more than a few words between them this ep?
I'm also in the camp that took this harder than the Red Wedding.

Hey guys, like my new avatar?

Â 
Too soon man! Too soon.
Â 
The image is already burned into my memory...I may never be able to re-watch his scenes and look at his head in the same way.
Â 
Â Oh Damn!
2686	sj4iy	2014-06-03	I can look at a picture, that's not the problem.
It's the screaming on top of it that gets me.
2687	DaveyJoe	2014-06-03	Yep no "I'm feeling more innocent by the instant."Â 


Â 
Nope, instead we got the nonverbal reactions of a good actor!
2688	voodooqueen126	2014-06-03	yeah, I can't see the complaints about the fight.
If there is one thing that D&D do right it is aesthetics. They can't write dialogue to save themselves, but they can make things look dramatic.
2689	Shpati	2014-06-03	I read the books, and I knew it was coming. But it got me more than the books. Mainly b/c of the scream.
Â 
Anyway, I got Tywin's death to cheer me up in the finale.Â 
Â 
Â

Yes. Same here. IIRC, in the books, it was one kick punch and he was dead, I don't think he screamed, right?
Â 
That scream is going to be in my head for weeks.

2690	LordStoneheart	2014-06-04	For those of you decrying the references to Rob Roy, I think you're missing the point on why its being brought up. Of course, in story context they're very very different, but as an example of one staged fight its apt. It's how the fight was directed, not anything to do with the content of Rob Roy or how wrong someone interprets the movie (looking at you, Jasta.)
2691	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-04	I'm I the same camp as all of you who took this harder than the Red Wedding-  Again, I knew it was coming for years... I was still shaking and love tapping the wall behind me when it happened. I usually rewatch the episode the next day, but haven't been able to watch the fight past Oberyn's "no, no, no...." It's like " Fuck, Oberyn, just stay at a safe distance and keep prodding him with the spear to punctuate your monologue, Dammit man!" I figure if I don't watch past that point, ever again, I can rewrite it in my head. 
Whoever mentioned an Oberyn prequel is a genius. Much better idea than "GOT- Robert's Rebellion".

Â 
I hope you're not that much of a pretentious asshat all the time. You're really not helping the cliche of book readers being unpleaseable jerks either.
Â 
I guess accepting that people can have different opinions is some sort of superhuman effort.


When it's bad, I call it out. When they do something good, I admit that. This fight was too rushed, poorly edited, unrealistic, clumsy and lacked proper build-up. Now, I can't help it that I have read the books, but I don't think that should stop me from ridiculing the poor choices they made in depicting this duel.

2693	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-04	I don't know if i can look at oberyn again, all i can sdee is his head exploded.
2694	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-04	The screaming wasn't that bad. It reminded me of this.


Â 
I remember when I first found the shot you are using for your avitar.Â  I wasn't even sure if it really was from the show although it was credited to HBO.Â  Now, question, am I the only one who thinks it looks like The Mountain must be squeezing the life out of..........a Planet of the Apes mask?Â
2695	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-04	I think the fight needed more ErrolÂ fucking Flynn!
2696	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-04	I thought it was great. The choreography was excellent, and they really nailed the tension beforehand, the thrill of victory as Oberyn picks the Mountain apart, and then the anguish of sudden and gruesome defeat. The death was even grislier than I imagined in the book.
Â 
I do wish they had kept him shouting "ELIAAAA!" as he pole-vaulted over the Mountain, but I concede that most viewers are too stupid to remember names.
Â 
The duel also could have used some music. Maybe there was some, but I didn't notice any.
2697	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	Swordfight duels - Inigo Montoya vs. Dread Pirate Roberts
Kung fu - Jet Li vs. half of France in Kiss of the Dragon
Â 
This duel seemed to follow the book really closely.Â  They really couldn't vary it too much.Â  They probably left out Tyrion's vomiting so as not to induce mass vomiting in the viewers, as most of our stomachs were pretty much roiling at that point.
2698	Wussel	2014-06-04	That's already been established in the prior 2 hours of the film, however.
Â 
The dialog is all the reason more for why it should have been stretched out rather than rushed. I'm not saying it needs the leisurely pacing and cutting of the Rob Roy fight, which does indeed increase its tension by short bursts of violence (but bursts that you can clearly understand) with tense stares and maneuvering around. But it's less than half the length and has three times as many cuts per second -- that's insanity. Something more like the Hector-Achilles fight -- itself about a minute longer, with a number of crowd reaction shots, but with half as many total cuts despite this! -- would have been much more appropriate.
To some degree I think it's all down to two major choreography errors:
Wushu acrobatics necessitating stunt doubling. Besides its particular pacing, the real beauty of the Rob Roy scene is that almost all -- perhaps all -- the scenes are the actors themselves; this is all the more remarkable because Archibald Cunningham looks like a "murder monkey", and that's all Tim Roth, who had no stage fighting experience at all. That's a testament to the vision of William Hobbs, who tailored the scene to get the maximum effect out of the actors, and to director Michael Caton-Jones in judging that the more they can sell Roth as a dangerous swordsman when compared to the tall, strapping Liam Neeson, the better. There's too many crane shots to hide the fact that we're looking at the double, but you can tell really -- he's leaner than Pascal is -- and that breaks the reality of the vision of the person you're watching actually being that dangerous.
The other issue is that the one-handed sword swings from Gregor sap a lot of the tension out of his attacks. They're not credibly dangerous, and it's worth considering that almost every "dangerous" blow he does in the fight is just his using his strength to throw or kick Oberyn around. The weapon's almost a non-factor because the insistence on sticking to one-handed swings was just wrong. And the thing is, they even acknowledge that the weapon -- a lighter-than-reality prop weapon! -- is too large to be effectively swung around by the world's third strongest man in the post-episode behind-the-scenes video. So why do it? It doesn't even make particular sense since I'm certain that if Gregor Clegane had to fight without a shield, he'd use that sword with both hands. A couple of times to emphasize how strong he is, fine, but it's almost all the time, and every time he does it there's no real feeling of threat to Oberyn.
Tailor the scene to the actors, and the cutting wouldn't have to be so insanely fast. Some of that cutting, I assure you, was just to "speed up" the action by cutting out some of the ponderousness of BjA¶rnsson's blows. That's not his fault, that's the fault of the choreographer, the director, and the producers.
Better choreography would have led to less cutting, which would have given the movement and space of the fight more impact, and would have allowed Pascal and BjA¶rnsson to be more "present". As it is, so much was blink-and-you'll miss it.
ETA:
Here's my preliminary calculation of the fight's cutting, using techniques discussed on Cinemetrics, a site for study of film through the lens of cutting technique and cinematography.
Total fight length: 107 seconds
Total cuts: 124
Average shot length: 0.86587 seconds
Median shot length: 0.765 seconds
Shortest cut: 0.250 seconds
By way of comparison, here's Rob Roy's final duel:
Total fight length: 276 seconds
Total cuts: ~101 cuts
ASL: 2.732
And the final fight between Hector and Achilles in Troy:
Total fight length: 166 seconds
Total cuts: ~117
ASL: 1.41
And from the video I link below, here's a 60 second fight from The Bourne Identity:
Total fight length: 60 seconds
Total cuts: 62 cuts
ASL: .95 seconds
Shortest cut: .40 seconds
And the first fight from Hero (where there's a lot of stunt and wire work, admittedly... but it's actually Jet Li and Donnie Yen doing them, because that's just how they roll):
Total fight length: 60 seconds
Total cuts: 22
ASL: 2.6 seconds
Shortest cut: .80 seconds
It's the fastest fight cutting I can find via Cinemetrics, and it's apparently faster than the very rapid cutting of one of the Bourne Identity one-on-one fight scenes, according to this. I'm guessing -- but haven't yet gone through with an eye towards this -- that the fight also has a very heavy reliance on close ups, which deemphasizes the particular mechanics of the fight with longer-than-normal weapons.
(I know, this is among the nerdiest things I've ever done in discussing the show, but honestly, it feels like some actual empirical data is needed to fully explain why the cutting is bugging me so much; it's symptomatic of poor choices the production made.)


Â 
Â 
While I totally agree with the main points about this fight, I would like to point out that the review is read for other reasons. The fight was anti-climactic to say at least. However that happens a lot to hyped things. The beatle talk was a pain. Tyrion bitching about drinking was even more out of character. Even if he did in the books.
Â 
For the review I would suggest a more descriptive approach. While I do like the judgemental part and often agree, I do read the review for information purpose. Thus means I want facts. I really like the book to screen comparision. I think that is really an incredible service. I would love to get that for episode 8 too. I would prefer, if the judgment will be separated from the descriptive parts and even gets its own headline. Like "the verdict", "good and bads" or whatever you feel apropriate.

Â 
He did.
2701	Juan_Snow	2014-06-04	*slow clap*
Had Rob Roy wanted to break new ground and do something worth talking about, Roth would have dominated the fight from the beginning, and finished Neeson off with a slow Needle-to-Polliver's-throat like maneuver. Instead...whatever, seen it a million times.
Not to mention how goofy the last few seconds of that duel was. Rolled my eyes so hard I almost passed out.


No shit the end of that duel is laughably bad.

Yes. Same here. IIRC, in the books, it was one kick punch and he was dead, I don't think he screamed, right?

Â 
Uh... the editing was fine.Â  I didn't have any trouble following the action.Â  If you want to see a show with bad editing, watch American Horror Story.Â  I'm a big horror fan but I can only watch one episode every couple of months because the clunky editing offends my sensibilities as a professional video editor.

Mentioned this early on in this thread already but I recently saw a post on the comment section of an oldÂ Red Viper vs. The Mountain comicÂ and I thought it was really great. Like they did in the show, this artist portrayed Oberyn as a rat pinned down by a lion, desperately trying to wriggle himself free out of terror and agony.Â 
Â 

My favorite bit is the look of shock and very real fear on Oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s face and that he struggles in vain for his life when the Mountain grabs him right at the end. The Red Viper easily could be portrayed as an unwavering defiant caricature of vengeful wrath right up to the end and probably has been before, however this cartoonist gives us something rather different and in my opinion considerably more interesting. Their Oberyn Martell is suddenly confronted with the price he is going to have pay for the confession and vengeance for his murdered sister and realises in the last seconds of his life that he really doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to pay that priceâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
â<U+0080>¦but it is already too late!

And I have to agree. Oberyn going out like a badass is simply not as interesting. Here's a guy who has been nothing but Mr. Suave, Mr. Brave, Mr. Stoic I-Will-Have-My-Vengeance Always-in-Control screaming bloody murder, flailing his arms around. A man like thatÂ isn't supposed to die... like that. That's half the reason why it's so disturbing. Even though Martin never mentioned Oberyn screaming or the look on his face when Gregor grabbed hold of him in the books, that doesn't mean it couldn't have happened that way. I imagined it as such, and so did the artist of that comic and the showrunners of GoT, apparently. It's up to each individual reader to fill in the details for themselves but I'm glad D&D chose the route they did because it's significantly more compelling.
Â 


Gregor's Nancy BoyÂ is rocking this thread!


Hehehehe

2706	eliogar	2014-06-04	Not a connosseur of the entire series, but I have read all the books so far.Â  From the beginning I decided not to judge the screen writers as they are limited to the amount of information they can use. I must say though, that if I had not read the books and just watched the series I will say they are a good series.
I still can't understand why they deviate so much from the actual books, it seems they change everything to their liking instead of the way the books are leading to, it sure is a nightare to GRRM since now he has to accomodate details in his future writings.Â  That's all for now, just venting a bit.
2707	RandomSmallfolk	2014-06-04	Apparently a certain Martell needs a bottle of Obuprofin
2708	Jasta11	2014-06-04	For those of you decrying the references to Rob Roy, I think you're missing the point on why its being brought up. Of course, in story context they're very very different, but as an example of one staged fight its apt. It's how the fight was directed, not anything to do with the content of Rob Roy or how wrong someone interprets the movie (looking at you, Jasta.)


Â 
I don't mind people going ''I think this is how a properly choreographed duel looks like'' and pointing at an example. I take issue with the same two people plastering it in our face again and again and saying anyone who disagrees with them has ''poor taste''.
Â 
Not liking the scene is fine. Being holier than thou about it is not. Can we at least discuss something without bogging it down with nerdy nitpickings for once?
Â 
Sure, the Rob Roy duel was better choreographed. No problem seeing and admitting that. But since the context of the GoT duel was more interesting, I liked it more as a whole. It's my opinion and I'm bloody well entitled to it without someone putting their hipster glasses and saying I shouldn't like it because reasons.
2709	Ser Not Appearing	2014-06-04	Apparently a certain Martell needs a bottle of Obuprofin Obery(profi)n
2710	7th-key	2014-06-04	Never before did a scene or movie make me physically feel sick. The detail, gore, the voice and sound that goes with it. Horrible to see. I agree that it is totally nescessary to give the scene weight, but I don't know if I can sleep tonight. I'll get over it I'm sure. Great scene regardless.

Â 
I argue it's also the cheapest way to give the scene weight. GRRM spends time leading to the fight, with strategies, building up rage, and then crushes Oberyn's head.
The show, the fight is the first Oberyn scene after he offers to champion Tyrion. Oberyn twirls around, pokes at a static Mountain. The end is the equivalent of half a page of gory description of a head being torn apart.
Â 
I think film is a more satisfying medium for showing fights, so the show could have given it more pathos. It didn't. As it seems obvious at this point, they just go for the money shot.
2711	Alhazard	2014-06-04	From my point of view, the main reason the duel ended so poorly done is that they had to film a scene with a lot of people outdoor.
This means having only a few hours a day for 3 days, with a giant that knows nothing about swords (and even less about recitation).
Changing the actor for the Mountain was a bad move.
They could have him fight with a full helm all the time using an experienced tall fighter for the combat scenes, instead of forcing us to believe that giant version of teddy bear was one of the most cruel man in Westeros.
Honestly imho any mediocre fighter with a spear could have taken down that "mountain" without a worry: he simply did swing his long sword using only a hand (why?).
What they did with Oberyn was even worse...
you have this "really experienced fighter in his early forty" that does pirouettes as if he was a ballet dancer in his twenty...
it's obvious that the battle among a big young warrior and an experienced one with a longer range weapon will be about the latter keeping the first out of range until he's completely exhausted.
That should take at least 10 minutes...we're talking of people that were forced to live with they armor on for months, in any climatic condition and Sir Clegane was probably among the toughest.
Yet Oberin feels like doing pirouettes...
My last complain (not really, but this is getting too long) is that they overused shots from afar.
In my opinion, when you've someone as talented as Pedro Pascal you shoul focus on the face of the two, showing how the rage and the fatigue mix until he does the fatal miscalculation. I would've added a lot of close ups to show that a battle isn't simply something phisical.
In the end they ruined something that really had the potential to be one of the most memorable fights even filmed. A shame.

Â 
Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't this a point in the books, actually? People saying that the Mountain was strong enough to swing a two-hander broad sword with one hand?Â

2716	LordStoneheart	2014-06-04	Â 
I don't mind people going ''I think this is how a properly choreographed duel looks like'' and pointing at an example. I take issue with the same two people plastering it in our face again and again and saying anyone who disagrees with them has ''poor taste''.
Â 
Not liking the scene is fine. Being holier than thou about it is not. Can we at least discuss something without bogging it down with nerdy nitpickings for once?
Â 
Sure, the Rob Roy duel was better choreographed. No problem seeing and admitting that. But since the context of the GoT duel was more interesting, I liked it more as a whole. It's my opinion and I'm bloody well entitled to it without someone putting their hipster glasses and saying I shouldn't like it because reasons.


Â 
Does the context really matter when criticizing the choreography? Your criticism of the story of Rob Roy had little to do with the point being made, and it was rather immature and negative anyway.Â 
Â 
And I think the duel in GoT/ASoIaF was better. Why? Because I knew Liam Neeson would win the moment I saw him as a Brave Scot in a kilt and his enemy as a Snooty Brit with a wig. He's The Hero against The Villain and The Hero wins because it's Hollywood. I never saw the movie and knew who would win before it even began. The actors can choreograph like they were born with swords in hands, the tension can be built up to ridiculous levels, the stakes can be sky-high, the filmography can give a cinema intern an orgasm, but if you know by convention that The Hero wins then it doesn't help that much to make it a great watch.

Â 
this whole quote, especially the bold parts, has no bearing on what was being discussed. Nothing to do with hipster glasses, though it certainly feels like you've found yourself a pair.Â

Were there negatives for the Mountain in the books though? I mean show-Mountain-III is a big guy, but Gregor from the books would dwarf him right?
2718	Alia of the knife	2014-06-04	IMHO, I would have liked to see it center more on KL and builiding up to the duel.
Â 
I also think this venue could even address the Moutnain who I find to be a little unrealistic, (either he is a man or he is something else), his past and his motives beyond being impossible to kill because he clearly isn't stupid as he managed to hide his true nature from even Rhaegar who knighted him. And though its implied in the books, the inability to kill this man gives lie to the idea "anyone can die" and he is fast approaching Michael Myers proportions in his survivability rate, especially regarding the suspicions regarding his ultimate fate.

If the theory is true, Robert Strong is Gregor's headless, reanimated body. He's hardly a man anymore. He died an agonizing death from Oberyn's poison and what was left after that became a tool for Qyburn. Not really the epitome of immortality. He stayed alive so long because he was very valuable to Tywin and "no one could ever withstand him." Afterall, he was a well trained, heavily armored, eight foot tall warrior (and lord in his own right) who served one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, men in all of Westeros.Â

Â 
There's a recent HBO vid about the choreography that tells you exactly where they got it from - from Wushu spear forms (there's even a clip of a Chinese expert helping out).Â  But of course, the same influence is obviously part of the lightsabre choreography too (at least in the prequels, where the lightsabre stuff is light years ahead of the original trilogy in complexity and sophistication).

2730	Jasta11	2014-06-04	Yeah, that's what I thought. The skull is the thickest, most reinforced part of your skeleton. Even if you're an incredibly strong man, simply crushing it with your bare hands (after receiving a crippling wound, no less) seem a bit ridiculous. You have little pressure points yet must apply it to a very tough, smooth and relatively small surface. I'm no expert but I always thought it was highly implausible.

I still think a Mythbusters special is called for.  They should first test if it's humanly possible, and if that fails, they should increase the force based on what they think a fantasy freak of nature like the Mountain may be capable of.

Â 
A friend of mine and me were debating this actually. Â I think the force is something akin to 520 lbs necessary to crush a human skull without any interior pressure. Â Not sure what a "full" and skinned skull would allow for, maybe an extra hundred? Bjornsson, himself, can bench 507 lbs clean and that's at an upward angle....now add in downward force, the assistance of plate gloves, the angle he took (inside of the orbital), and the fact that his character is substantially larger and stronger.....yeah I think it's possible. Â 
Yeah....spent alot of time debating how to make a head explode.

2736	Tankbuster	2014-06-05	Actually, Oberyn pulls the spear out while saying "no, no, no...", and steps over him and I am sure if the mountain punches you with a mailed fist, you may lose a few teeth, just look at what happens to Pia. The only way it could have been better was if Oberyn was on top and the mountain was holding him in a grip.

I stand corrected. In the tv show Oberyn pulls the spear out....but the point remains valid. It's a severe chest wound, and I don't care who you are, you don't get up and act like everything is okay after that. And my second point remains valid as well punching someone's teeth out require you to cock your fist back well behind your head, which is something lying on the ground doesn't allow. Try it. You're punching from AT LEAST twelve inches from your chest.
Â 
Edited to add: I'm not saying you couldn't knock someone's tooth out with only...what. six, seven inches of room to work with, but you definitely couldn't bust someone's grill open from that position.

I don't get what your saying. Oberyn was on top when the Mountain punched him in the mouth, which is my whole point entirely. The Mountain being on top and punching him in the grill is much more realistic and is how I read it in the book. If i missed it then I call "bullshit" post facto.

Yup, completely acknowledged that it's a fantasy world... in fact, it was the first thing I said after the link...Really, it's not that I'm arguing that it shouldn't have been done in the show because " we needs teh realisms"', as much as it is "on a side note, I wonder if that's humanly possible". Man, people feel the need to attack every sort of analysis of the scene that isn't "twas the best that ever was". No need for you to huff, and puff, and take me down a peg. Just thought the article was relevant, seeing how the possibility of this scenario playing out in reality was mentioned more than a few times.
Â 
I wasn't dissatisfied with him crushing his head, though. Yeah- it probably wouldn't have popped like a balloon, but no biggie. Though I'm starting to come around to seeing why people thought the screaming from Oberyn worked, I still think him dying in such a brutal manner was visceral and sickening enough, but to each his own. It obviously worked in disgusting the bejeesus out of even the more hardened and desensitized individuals among the fandom.

I don't recall, but I thought he pole vaulted over the mountain in the book and broke the spear off in him. Â He was holding the mountain's sword when he got surprised, so maybe it was a ground punch in the book. Â All I know is the Red Viper became the Red Mist.

Â 
Whoa!Â  Physics is physics, physiology is physiology, even in a fantasy world with magic.Â  In fact, GRRM's very careful to avoid his magic being such that anything that happens in the world you can say "derp, magic".
Â 
That said, given the parameters of the Mountain's strength, his mass, weight and armor, and his leveraged "grip" in the eye-sockets, the tv version of headsplat is definitely possible, physics-wise.Â 
Â 
Also re. the teeth punching from the ground, you don't need to "chamber" a punch for it to be quite hard, and especially not, given that the solidity of the ground is right behind you - there's a knack to it, not many people know it, but it's quite possible (again, especially given the stipulations of freakish strength and an armoured fist).

In part because Ray Park (Maul) was a wushu expert and was capable of all those moves. So when he somersaults and the like, that's him actually doing it, so the camera stays close in...Not-so-random fact: the average shot length of the "Duel of the Fates" is 2.2 seconds (from its start to the point where Maul and Qui-gon are separated by the force field), and features a lot of medium long shots featuring the full bodies of the performers.
2746	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-05	It's intriguing to me that after reading this whole thread, 99% of the complaints have to deal with:
1. The pre-battle buildup
2. The battle itself
3. Oberyn's death
I only saw one comment which addressed what disappointed me, the point the episode ended at. I get that that's where it ended in the books too, but I would've liked to have seen Tyrion being dragged away and maybe more reactions out of characters(perhaps the show could pull a music-only montage as if it were Lost or something.  )
I don't know, ending the episode with Tyrion wide mouthed just seems like they're intentionally skipping what would naturally come after, as a way to avoid writing it. Eh.
Hell, in that regard, I actually think the beetle speech(which was EASILY the best part of the episode for me personally) would've worked better AFTER the fight, rather than before it.
2747	MarieAntoinette	2014-06-05	I don't get it. People complain that head crushing was not realistic, I get that, but on the other hand a man getting his eyes gouged out has to die in total noble silence. The screams helped to make the death scene more horrifying and realistic in my opinion.
Â
2748	Konradsmith	2014-06-05	^Yeah, a lot of people on reddit, imdb, PTV etc. have said that the scream is what sold the horror of the moment for them.
Â 
As for complaints about how they shot it, we knew from early on that they were doing a lot more crane work this season and doing a lot more multi-camera set ups with new theÂ Arri digital cameras they got their hands on. So of course they're going to utilize all of that in this scene. Most of the show's previous sword fights have also featured a lot of cuts, sometimes cutting every time the swords lock or to get a better look at the space they're in. Okay, so some people like it all to be wider and to see all of the action in the frame at all times, but we can't say it was done badly overall because some of us would have done it differently.

If only Nikolaj had this to take hints from when he lost his hand, and that they didn't ruin the moment with jarring pop punk one second later.
2750	Konradsmith	2014-06-05	^In fairness it wasn't pop punk it was kindof pub rock inflected punk. And D and D and GrrM all danced around listening to it after it was recorded so that makes it worthwhile IMO.
Â 
As for the screams, Pedro's were great but Indira Varma's were top notch. And the movement of her hands over her face was perfect with her fingers fluttering, it looked involuntary. She sold that moment. If you look at how Unsullied responded to it be it on internet comments or reaction videos or just through talking to them, they feel like we did reading the chapter. Which is the point, I thought.

Prince Oberyn moved closer. "Say the name!" He put a foot on the Mountain's chest and raised the greatsword with both hands. Whether he intended to hack off Gregor's head or shove the point through his eyeslit was something Tyrion would never know.
Clegane's hand shot up and grabbed the Dornishman behind the knee. The Red Viper brought down the greatsword in a wild slash, but he was off-balance, and the edge did no more than put another dent in the Mountain's vambrace. Then the sword was forgotten as Gregor's hand tightened and twisted, yanking the Dornishman down on top of him. They wrestled in the dust and blood, the broken spear wobbling back and forth. Tyrion saw with horror that the Mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince, drawing him tight against his chest, like a lover... Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
... He thrust his free hand into Oberyn's unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes. "Then I raped her." Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishman's mouth, making splinters of his teeth. "Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this." As he drew back his huge fist, the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening crunch.

2760	DaveyJoe	2014-06-05	^Yeah, a lot of people on reddit, imdb, PTV etc. have said that the scream is what sold the horror of the moment for them.
Â 
As for complaints about how they shot it, we knew from early on that they were doing a lot more crane work this season and doing a lot more multi-camera set ups with new theÂ Arri digital cameras they got their hands on. So of course they're going to utilize all of that in this scene. Most of the show's previous sword fights have also featured a lot of cuts, sometimes cutting every time the swords lock or to get a better look at the space they're in. Okay, so some people like it all to be wider and to see all of the action in the frame at all times, but we can't say it was done badly overall because some of us would have done it differently.


Â 
  Â In typical fashion, people wanted something very specific and when the show goes in a different direction, they dismiss it as bad editing, bad directing, etc. as if it's an objective fact. Â There is nothing wrong with the editing in this scene. Â I like how the multiple angles didn't just emphasize Oberyn, but the spectacle of the entire scene, often showing the audience watching. Â The audience reactions reflected our own as the tone of the fight shifted drastically.
2761	Jo cool	2014-06-05	I don't know, ending the episode with Tyrion wide mouthed just seems like they're intentionally skipping what would naturally come after, as a way to avoid writing it. Eh.
Â 


Â 
Interesting. I thought ending the episode with Tyrion wide mouthed was a great idea. The viewers are left in Tyrion's shoes, disoriented, dismayed, scared (and staring blankly at the credits). It's a powerful ending imo.

Â 
Absolutely, both the screams and Tyrion's expression are obviously intended to mirror the likely (and intended) audience reaction.
2763	Veltigar	2014-06-05	Â 



Â 
I'd probably go withÂ leanÂ overÂ scrawny, but yeah Â  
Â 
Bjornsson is really thick, but he must carry it well because you don't really notice. Â It's hard to believe he's 5 inches shorter yet almost 100 lbs heavier than Conan Stevens.


Still strange that Conan looks a hell of a lot scarier than Teddybear Bjornsson 
Â 


Thats perfect.
And you and I both know that Bjornsson will likely have a future on "Vikings."Â  


He would make a good minor antagonist  Though, I don't think he's really good enough as an actor to be anything else 
Â 
Â 


1) Oberyn's scream at the end. Understandable given the eye gouging thing, but he deserved better than that. He didn't get his vengeance (or ,forgive the pun, he didn't live toÂ seeÂ his vengeance), but give the guy the gosh darn courtesy to not go out screaming like a little bitch. And now I'm left with that as my lasting memory of Oberyn. Thanks a lot HBO!! Assholes...


I have made my disappointment of this fight quite clear in this thread, but here I have to disagree. The scream was very great addition. If I could redo the whole fight, I'd still keep that in.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Yep, from the prequels containing the least emotionally involving fights in movie history...


True, but the Darth Maul fight was nicely staged at the very least (IIRC, it's been a couple of years since I last saw it).

Â 


Yes, wushu became a big part of what they envisioned lightsaber combat as involving during the prequels. In part because Ray Park (Maul) was a wushu expert and was capable of all those moves. So when he somersaults and the like, that's him actually doing it, so the camera stays close in...
Not-so-random fact: the average shot length of the "Duel of the Fates" is 2.2 seconds (from its start to the point where Maul and Qui-gon are separated by the force field), and features a lot of medium long shots featuring the full bodies of the performers.


Alas, they didn't follow that approach here
2764	Half Man	2014-06-05	I don't get it. People complain that head crushing was not realistic, I get that, but on the other hand a man getting his eyes gouged out has to die in total noble silence. The screams helped to make the death scene more horrifying and realistic in my opinion.
Â 


People who think that it wasn't realistic obviously haven't read the books and don'tÂ understand how strong the Mountain really is. The fight was perfect for me and it was my favorite part in the books.

2766	zaphodbrx	2014-06-05	A lot of people enjoyed the duel, specially TV-only viewers. Agreed, but I think the reason behind it is that the source material is just extremely good and that is what shows. From an adaptation perspective, I think it was disappointing. I'll try to explain why. I'm going to nitpick. Hell yeah.
Â 
The buildup
Â 
The whole episode has no King's Landing stuff in it until the end. And then when you finally think the duel is coming, you get 10 minutes of Orson Lannister crushing beetles. Just who thought this was a good idea. I don't care if it has some philosophical meaning, all the audience can think about is just get on with it already. Just sticks out like a sore thumb. The novels were already so good in this regard. You have these awesome Tyrion-Oberyn conversations which were all cut so that Oberyn could get a dumb line 'today is not the day I die'- Jojen's line, in a completely wrong context. And there is so much sub text in Oberyn's conversations , especially if you accept the Tywin poisoning theories 'Your father may not live forever', Cersei would support Myrcella's crowning, etc. The whole background is just cut. Bad, bad bad.
Â 
The equipment
Â 
Now I understand that you can't have actors wear helmets in film, they have to show their faces. OK, FINE.. as long as you don't DRAW attention to that fact in the freaking script. Now in real life, fighting without helmet would be suicide - it is the most important part of the armor. Sometimes they would fight without a visor just to get a better view, but they would not be bareheaded. Gregors greatsword striking your unprotected top or back of the head would split your skull, with a helm, you could get knocked back and maybe have a concussion but that is a much better deal. In fact in the novels, Oberyn does wear a halfhelm.
Â 
Gregor's case is even worse. He has a completely un historical type of helmet which just falls off. Like, what? I once witnessed a dangerous motorcycle accident at 40 kmph. The dude survived with his helmet still on- because that's the freaking point. A helm that just falls off when you need it the most is just self defeating and stupid.
Â 
A final comment about the spear. In most sparring situations/videos you'll see people using 6' poles because that's the most you can really fit into a car. A more realistic size would be 8' - the same as in the novels. In the show, the spear he uses is extremely short, like 5' or so max, so the entire point of having a longer reach is completely missed.
Â 
Fight choreography
Â 
What Martin describes in the novels is actually pretty realistic fight choreography . You can see a video example here of what it should have been like. Now I didn't expect the show to be anywhere as accurate or realistic. But what we did get was just really really bad.
Â 
The thing with stage combat is: you are trying to show a combat while being as safe as possible - which is exactly the opposite of what you would be trying to do in real combat, ie, to hurt your opponent. The trick is to do it in as realistic a manner while still looking good. This is difficult. Wu shu on the other hand is mainly for entertainment and acrobatic purposes. So when you use that in a fight supposedly to be to the death, it just ends up looking absurd.
Â 
The phantom menace is perhaps the best example of this- the linked video explains clearly why this 'fight' is rubbish. So when you have Oberyn just spinning around and twirling and doing this dance steps, its just hard to take him seriously. If I were in a duel to the death, I would probably learn a martial art that is focused towards, you know, killing people. Not this wu shu or star wars rubbish ( that would instantly get you killed in real life ).
Â 
Gregor is even more of a disappointment . I'm sorry, but this dude can't act. He just looks a little fat and round in his armor and totally not menacing in the slightest. Also, is he drunk or something. He just swings it around awkwardly with one hand as if he has no idea what he is doing.
Â 
The fight
Â 
Now, the fight is already problematic because Gregor is drunk and Oberyn is learning the ballet. But it is also too short and includes none of the cool stuff actually there in the novels that could distract you from the stupid fight choreography. Like the part where Gregor kills the unfortunate bystander, and the Sun comes out and Gregor puts the sun at his back, but Oberyn uses his shield to shine it in his face. Tyrion saying 'I am feeling more innocent every moment'. You know, the cool stuff that's there in the novels. They cut it out for what, Orson Lannister smashing beetles and burping whores and grey worm filler. Yeah..
Â 
The issues with the editing and camera angles have already been covered at length in other posts. I don't know much about this so all I'll say is that i just found it really bad, and awkward.
Â 
The end
Â 
I don't know if is possible to crush a man's skull with bare hands. Certainly it looked very goofy to me. When there was no need for it. They could have had him punch the face with his armored gauntlets, you know, like the novels.Â 
Â 
In conclusion I just found it a disappointing end to a disappointing epsiode.
Â 
Â
2767	ground_control	2014-06-05	Personally I thought the Duel was well executed and acted from start to finish.
Â 
Many of people's criticism of the scene could only be addressed by allocating more time to the duel and I think they gave it enough time to establish what was going on.


My primary objection is that the show didn't allocate enough time to the duel, so (a) obviously, allocating more time would address that complaint, but ( obviously we disagree as to whether or not the show gave it enough time.
Â 
The scene didn't need "time to establish what was going on" -- we've had seven episodes leading up to that scene, if you didn't know there was going to be an epic duel between epic bad-asses determining whether or not the "main" character of the series lives or dies, and that one way or another, the Game was going to change as a result, then no amount of time would be enough to "establish" the scene.
Â 
I didn't want the duel outcome just "established" (read "foraged"), I wanted an scene that lasted long and drawn out and suspenseful enough for me to be able to say, "THIS was what I was waiting for."
Â 
Instead, we got the fantasy version of a romance movie where the guy spends 90 minutes trying to be cute and charming, and finally gets the girl, but instead of getting married, going to prom, strolling hand-in-hand down a beautiful beach at sunset, or whatever, he gets a 2 minute handjob in traffic and a cut to the credits.
2768	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-05	http://www.buzzfeed....actual?s=mobile


That was "simply the best"- especially having Oberyn do that same stabbing over and over- so satisfying. I love hearing Tywin sentence Tyrion to FREEEEDDDOOOMMM.
Â 
Such wish fulfillment.
2769	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-05	Â 


I'm pretty sure Oberyn was on top through the whole thing, in the books. Correct me if I'm wrong, somebody. It's been a while since I read the chapter.



Prince Oberyn moved closer. "Say the name!" He put a foot on the Mountain's chest and raised the greatsword with both hands. Whether he intended to hack off Gregor's head or shove the point through his eyeslit was something Tyrion would never know.
Clegane's hand shot up and grabbed the Dornishman behind the knee. The Red Viper brought down the greatsword in a wild slash, but he was off-balance, and the edge did no more than put another dent in the Mountain's vambrace. Then the sword was forgotten as Gregor's hand tightened and twisted, yanking the Dornishman down on top of him. They wrestled in the dust and blood, the broken spear wobbling back and forth. Tyrion saw with horror that the Mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince, drawing him tight against his chest, like a lover... Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
... He thrust his free hand into Oberyn's unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes. "Then I raped her." Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishman's mouth, making splinters of his teeth. "Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this." As he drew back his huge fist, the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening crunch.
Â 


Ok, the way I read that is The Mountain pulling Oberyn down into his chest to steady him for the pain that's about to come, a bear hug to stop the bugger from squirming. Am I reading it wrong? Or are we in agreement?
2770	Seneti	2014-06-05	Â 
Â 
LOL. He totally did go out screaming like a little bitch. Â How embarassing to be sitting in the driver's seat, ready to call down the thunder on this family you've been plotting against for years....and then you die screaming your head off in front of them. Â 


Â 
Am I the only one who is totally disturbed by the idea that any male character that cries in moments of deep sadness or screams in moments of sheer agony is suddenly considered "a little bitch"? Guys, it's called being human.Â 
Â 


The screams are easily the best part of the whole situation.
If only Nikolaj had this to take hints from when he lost his hand, and that they didn't ruin the moment with jarring pop punk one second later.


Â 
I agree, the screaming sold it for me. I did like Nikolaj's scene though. With an injury like that (quick and sudden instead of drawn out like Oberyn's eye gorging) there's usually a delay in response. It's that moment where you have not yet quite realized what just happened, but then it finally hits you and that's when the pain comes.

You are not alone. That and the fact that some people seem to have a large appreciation of the gore are both deeply troubling. Sadly, not surprising tho.Â

But you're right...it makes sense that there would be a delayed reaction when he saw his hand cut off. It's not as if it were crushed or anything- it was straight up cut off in one swift moment. I cut my finger pretty badly, but it was a sharp knife, and I didn't feel the pain immediately.And I don't see anyone NOT screaming in Oberyn's situation. Calling him a 'little bitch' for screaming in agony is just ridiculous, and was said by someone who has probably never experienced pain on that kind of level.

2775	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-05	Agreed. If anyone where to actually be alive and concious while that happened to their face and skull, they would let out a shriek or two before it finally caved/sploded/cracked. I can't even imagine just the sensation of your face cracking and giving way, even the part of it that wouldn't even necessarily be pain, but that feeling of the pressure finally causing the bones in your face to fracture. Those moments would be horrendous.
Â 
In the books, and the way that comic showed it- I felt like it happened extremely fast, Oberyn being stunned by that first punch and in no position to really react to what was happening to him fully... but the show's version I feel was worse, with Oberyn feeling every instant of it after that first punch, while his head was burst, slowly. Ugh I really haven't been able to watch it after that first time because of his scream. I knew people were going to start saying "like a bitch" once I saw it, though.. and that frustrated me. It's because I know all the difference was made in that he didn't give a more "manly" sounding, gutteral "AAAGGGGGHHHHH", instead of that shrill shriek that he gave out. People instantly jump on it because it's not a "masculine" scream, I feel.Â  Please, like any of us would handle that stone-faced and silent, though. I'm just starting to feel lucky that they didn't go full realistic and have him void his bowels or piss himself.
2776	sj4iy	2014-06-05	Thanx for that video example. You whole post was brilliant.It may have been more 'realistic', but god, was it boring as hell to watch.

You are right about it.
2778	Ran	2014-06-05	It may have been more 'realistic', but god, was it boring as hell to watch.The main difference being that unlike the fellow who is held back by the spear, Gregor keeps pressing forward because he has masses of plate armor. Oberyn scores a lot of hits, but is constantly on the move, trying to keep Gregor at just the right distance while Gregor repeatedly gets in close enough to get cuts at him and his spear. The fight is described as not very linear, either -- it moves "back and forth", it "spirals" -- it's fairly active movement, which means you get more interesting angles of attack then just straight forward.Suffice it to say, it would be much more "interesting" than the video above, in which a single hit ends the play and which the fight is in a limited, straight track.I again cite the Rob Roy fight, simply in the way that it, too, isn't a linear combat, where small hits don't end the fight, where the individual with reach and speed toys with his opponent; something like this exchange makes for excellent, exciting choreography.
2779	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-05	You are right about it.


Haha ok, cool. I was starting to wonder if maybe I had missed something, and been under the wrong impression for the last couple of years. I've had nearly as tough a time re-reading that chapter as I have so far re-watching the fight... and I liked the fight, for the most part... that end, though.
2780	22willdo	2014-06-05	with a helm, you could get knocked back and maybe have a concussion


Â 
Maybe? Â That's a slightÂ understatement, don't you think? Â And then what? Â Regain strength and strike back? Â I don't see how a helmet could have helped him. Â Once struck by The Mountain (resp. his 6-foot broadsword), you're out..
2781	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-05	Â 
Interesting. I thought ending the episode with Tyrion wide mouthed was a great idea. The viewers are left in Tyrion's shoes, disoriented, dismayed, scared (and staring blankly at the credits). It's a powerful ending imo.



For starters, Opeth is a great band.
I would agree with you, if it weren't for the fact that ending ending episodes with character reaction shots has happened literally every season. Starting with episode 3 of season one, onwards we're privy to the vast majority of episodes ending with the camera on their face. ESPECIALLY in recent times, in reactions to surprises. Jaime's episode ends with his scream and his face, Red Wedding ends with Cat's face, the episode before this ended with Tyrion and Oberyn's faces, etc.
Every now and then it works, but it's turned into a cheap way to end scenes two seconds after the twist happens - rather than giving us complete scenes.

Absolutely hilarious.Â
2783	ServantOnIce	2014-06-05	Yeah, that's what I thought. The skull is the thickest, most reinforced part of your skeleton. Even if you're an incredibly strong man, simply crushing it with your bare hands (after receiving a crippling wound, no less) seem a bit ridiculous. You have little pressure points yet must apply it to a very tough, smooth and relatively small surface. I'm no expert but I always thought it was highly implausible.


Â 
TV Gregor practices, "Hokuto Shin Ken" Â Â  
Â 
I did think that was not realistic. I wanted to see the smoking fist . . Â  that Gregor used to finish Prince Oberyn.

I don't think Oberyn's a little bitch, for the record. I think he screamed like one, yeah. But I gave my theory on why he did and it doesn't have anything to do with him being a little bitch. If you want to ignore that post, go right ahead.
Â 
On another note, I found some close up pics of both fighters' weapons. Oberyn's spear had a cool viper slithering up the shaft and more interesting than that... I see the black Clegane hound on a yellow field. I guess they were planning on giving Gregor a shield afterall.Â
2785	D-A-C	2014-06-06	Just to respond to all the 'crushing his head like a melon' is possible crowd.
Â 
Alot of us who didn't like it, don't like it, not because it's not possible physically and ruins immersion, but more it actually appears comical in the midst of a horrifying scene.
Â 
So, bascially I would have prefered it like this:
Â 
1. Oberyn gets lifted one handed, pulled round and punched so his teeth get knocked out exactly as happens
Â 
2. The Hound mounts Oberyn gouges his eyes and gives his speech, the terrible scream, gore, all still fine.
Â 
3. Then, when he comes to the conclusion and says 'then I smashed her head in, like this' instead of squishing his head and it splatting which is just silly looking, not even the physics of it, but its just stupid, why not have him lift one of his giant mailed fists and pummel his face into oblivion?
Â 
That's the change I would make, and not only does it avoid the whole is it possible debate, but its more viceral and consistant with how things would play out naturally.
Â 
Â 
Â 
So that's my problem with the head popping it isn't as terrifying/horrifying as the eye gouging/scream or even close as its so over the top it just actually ends up detracting from the horror that we have just witnessed.

I didn't say Oberyn was a "little bitch", I said he screamed like one. And I also said that it was understandable given the fact that he was getting his eyes gouged out. Now if I would have said "I don't care what happens, you don't scream not matter what because that's what little bitches do", then your argument would have some merit. I just felt he deserved better than that. And now, as recompense, I demand that Tywin scream like a little bitch too. We Oberyn fans are owed a debt, and we better have it paid dammit.

Are you familiar with the phrase 'distinction without a difference'?
2788	Ravi Seaworth	2014-06-06	It was horrifying and that was shown by the reaction of many unsullied. I know many of you may not like this approach, but it is that which they decided to adopt, and to be frank it's not that different from the books. Maybe, a little more buildup could have improved the scene, but everything else was not far off from what I expected. Maybe, that's because I don't create unrealistic expectations for the show.

Well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts... but I doubt we'll get that lovely sounding banshee wail from Charles Dance.
Â 
Just imagine that though? As the shaft buries itself in Tywin's gut (no homo, for Shae,"ho-no-mo") you hear the wonderful harmony of Tywin shrieking like a 7 year old girl while simultaneously loosing a weeks worth of built up sphincter-blocker.

You have these awesome Tyrion-Oberyn conversations which were all cut so that Oberyn could get a dumb line 'today is not the day I die'- Jojen's line, in a completely wrong context. And there is so much sub text in Oberyn's conversations , especially if you accept the Tywin poisoning theories 'Your father may not live forever', Cersei would support Myrcella's crowning, etc. The whole background is just cut. Bad, bad bad.
Â 
The equipment
Â 
Now I understand that you can't have actors wear helmets in film, they have to show their faces. OK, FINE.. as long as you don't DRAW attention to that fact in the freaking script. Now in real life, fighting without helmet would be suicide - it is the most important part of the armor. Sometimes they would fight without a visor just to get a better view, but they would not be bareheaded. Gregors greatsword striking your unprotected top or back of the head would split your skull, with a helm, you could get knocked back and maybe have a concussion but that is a much better deal. In fact in the novels, Oberyn does wear a halfhelm.
Â 
Gregor's case is even worse. He has a completely un historical type of helmet which just falls off. Like, what? I once witnessed a dangerous motorcycle accident at 40 kmph. The dude survived with his helmet still on- because that's the freaking point. A helm that just falls off when you need it the most is just self defeating and stupid.
Â 
A final comment about the spear. In most sparring situations/videos you'll see people using 6' poles because that's the most you can really fit into a car. A more realistic size would be 8' - the same as in the novels. In the show, the spear he uses is extremely short, like 5' or so max, so the entire point of having a longer reach is completely missed.
Â 
Fight choreography
Â 
What Martin describes in the novels is actually pretty realistic fight choreography . You can see a video example here of what it should have been like. Now I didn't expect the show to be anywhere as accurate or realistic. But what we did get was just really really bad.
Â 
The thing with stage combat is: you are trying to show a combat while being as safe as possible - which is exactly the opposite of what you would be trying to do in real combat, ie, to hurt your opponent. The trick is to do it in as realistic a manner while still looking good. This is difficult. Wu shu on the other hand is mainly for entertainment and acrobatic purposes. So when you use that in a fight supposedly to be to the death, it just ends up looking absurd.
Â 
The phantom menace is perhaps the best example of this- the linked video explains clearly why this 'fight' is rubbish. So when you have Oberyn just spinning around and twirling and doing this dance steps, its just hard to take him seriously. If I were in a duel to the death, I would probably learn a martial art that is focused towards, you know, killing people. Not this wu shu or star wars rubbish ( that would instantly get you killed in real life ).
Â 
Gregor is even more of a disappointment . I'm sorry, but this dude can't act. He just looks a little fat and round in his armor and totally not menacing in the slightest. Also, is he drunk or something. He just swings it around awkwardly with one hand as if he has no idea what he is doing.
Â 
The fight
Â 
Now, the fight is already problematic because Gregor is drunk and Oberyn is learning the ballet. But it is also too short and includes none of the cool stuff actually there in the novels that could distract you from the stupid fight choreography. Like the part where Gregor kills the unfortunate bystander, and the Sun comes out and Gregor puts the sun at his back, but Oberyn uses his shield to shine it in his face. Tyrion saying 'I am feeling more innocent every moment'. You know, the cool stuff that's there in the novels. They cut it out for what, Orson Lannister smashing beetles and burping whores and grey worm filler. Yeah..
Â 
The issues with the editing and camera angles have already been covered at length in other posts. I don't know much about this so all I'll say is that i just found it really bad, and awkward.
Â 
The end
Â 
I don't know if is possible to crush a man's skull with bare hands. Certainly it looked very goofy to me. When there was no need for it. They could have had him punch the face with his armored gauntlets, you know, like the novels.Â 
Â 
In conclusion I just found it a disappointing end to a disappointing epsiode.
Â 
Â 


Great post, more or less my exact thoughts.
I was looking forward to this scene, I loved Pedro Pascal as Oberyn, minus the brothel scenes, but those aren't his fault. But they just had to give him Legolas syndrome.
And then there's the Mountain, who seemed to have the opposite problem, he didn't even know how to hold his damn sword. I am not exaggerating when I say that Gregor's choreography was some of the worst I've ever seen.
Such a shame, this could have been a fight which could have ended up on people's "Favourite movie fights" lists for years to come. But they messed up.

Â 
Everyone knows, that in the book, Oberyn had a BUCKLER that he used to his significant advantage against Ser Gregor!
Â 
That was key to the Dornish fighting style and now they've ruined the one chance they had to show this important point about the Dornish character.
Â 
I mean, without the shield, how was he going to reflect the sun into the Mountain's eyes, giving him time to take a shot at the joints in his armor?

I'm getting tired of all the sloppy, poor writing of this season. First, the Hound doesn't have his helmet, then the moon door is in the wrong location, Lysa isn't fat, Roose doesn't get leeched ONCE in three seasons!!
Â 
All those I could have done with, but this whitewashing of Oberyn's character and fighting style was a travesty. I don't know HOW they are going to recover from this one.

2798	Theon_the_original	2014-06-06	Little off topic but if the Red Viper did Kill Gregor by showing how he was a superior fighter and was not foolish enough to get cocky and get killed, would he have been considered the best warrior or where would you rate him. He appears very high on most list despite the outcome. Â

I don't like the "Lysa killed herself" story, but there weren't any other options at that point since Marillion was already gone.
Â 
Sansa's turn to Darth Sansa seemed a little too quick - she's been picking up on the game, but that was very fast.
Â 
Hound/Arya - great laugh.
Â 
The duel. Â They did an alright job with it, the thing that stuck out for me though was that the way Oberyn beat him shows that Bronn or any skilled swordsman could have beaten him. Â There wasn't anything he did that specifically needed the spear to do it. Â  I think the complaint that he did pull a WWE recovery is spot on. Â I do love Tyrions look of "just fucking kill him".

I am wondering still why Jaime was KGing and was a spectator.

Yes, I noticed that too. The artist changed it out with a colored version soon after I posted it the first time (around the same time the episode aired). I guess he was getting pretty hyped about the duel or he knew people were going to stumble across it more often than usual due to all the inevitable internet searches the following day. Which is exactly what happened (check the date all the recent comments were posted).
Â 


Just imagine that though? As the shaft buries itself in Tywin's gut (no homo, for Shae,"ho-no-mo")Â

No one listened because you explained yourself like a bitch.
Â 
Now I shouldn't get in trouble for that because, for reasons only the two of you seem to understand, by calling you a bitch just now I somehow didn't actually call you call bitch...
Â 
Again, there is such a thing as a distinction without a difference.

2810	Arry Lannister	2014-06-06	Â 
Again, totally get why he screamed in the show- I don't think anyone who could actually feel pain or was still conscious wouldn't scream. I'm just comparing the scenario to the books here, which I think was better done. I got the point that Oberyn dropped the ball, paid for it dearly, revenge blinded him, all that. But, comparing it to the book, leads me to this.
Â 
Â At no point in the books did I think, or think anyone else would think "wow, Oberyn died like a screaming little bitch", that's all.
Â 
Again, not so much dissapointed because I thought,"aww man he screamed like a pussy", but I know that idea would get into a lot of other peoples heads. From experience, knowing dudes who think they'd handle having their skull crushed like Thich Quang Duch when he burned in Saigon: unflinching, and silent as a rock- because, you know, they're real men. I dunno, it's a tiny nit-pick. He died pretty gruesomely in both cases, anyways. I just don't feel the phrase "like a bitch" should be associated with Oberyn, at all. He's not Vegeta. He's Inigo Montoya.
Â 
I still don't think they should have had him getting knocked down so much, or having his first spear broken like that. I really do think it ruined the build-up. Like, all right, this guy has had a few close calls already, not really convinced he'll walk out unscathed- where as compared to the books, he owns it right up until he doesn't.


Of course I didn't think that in the books, if I remember correctly in the books Oberyn didn't scream because rather than getting his eyes gouged out he instead got punched (repeatedly).
2811	Kenyatta	2014-06-07	"About" is not the same. I'm done with this stupid debate.

Yeah, exactly what I was getting at... pretty much just that I preferred how it went down in the books. Maybe his character in the books would still have screamed like that in the same situation? Probably would have. Still, it's why I preferred the books... it just left Oberyn a little bit more "intact" in the end, left him a little bit more dignity, I guess. And it was a little bit more believable. Gregor being pretty much incapacitated except for his upper body, grasping, and clenching. and throwing that last devestating haymaker- before the adrenaline he was running on waned.
Â 
However, I am (and will probably always be) a vehement proponent of both show and books, and not on a "the show is an entirely different thing" level. Though one could argue that, really- it's not. It's an adaptation, and a damn good one, for the most part sanctioned by the author. Of course, as readers, we will always have things we wish would stay the same as they are on the page, but I can live with the changes they make for now. I could have even lived with Oberyn surviving 
Â 
@Gregor's Nancy Boy- that avatar really does show how much Oberyn's face looked like a toothless, geriatric chimpanzee right before popping.

Thing is, I knew what was coming, but you still feel like yelling at him to get it over with or get out of the damn way.

Exactly. This isn't a criticism of the book or the show, I know the plot necessitated Oberyn's death- Really though? Had I been in Tyrion's situation, I would have been screaming my head off, like "BACK THE FUCK AWAY FROM GOLIATH, RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! STAB HIM FROM OUT OF REACH IF YOU HAVE TO DO THIS "EXTRACT THE CONFESSION" SHIT! THIS IS YOUR LIFE AND MY LIFE, MAN!" Oberyn may or may not heed the advice, but at least something might interrupt him from his blind-rage, and put enough flaccid in his revengerection for the blood to reach his brain for a second. Fuckin' Oberyn.
Â 
Unless Tyrion did shout to him at that moment, I don't remember it, Tyrion was convinced he had won at that point, too... IIRC. In the show, though, he had that look on his face.

Hear ya... I understand how it can be said, and that was my gripe. Though I still think it's a response that warrants analysis of how anybody else would handle the situation. Joking around about it is fine- If you can admit to yourself, "Hey, I'd probably scream like a little bitch, too" then cool. I've come across a few instances where people are like, "man, he ain't have to scream like a little biitccch, though" In all seriousness.
Â 
But that isn't really my problem with it, it's just that I knew that it was going to come up because of how the show depicted it, and it's difference from the source material- however minor it may be. Like I and others have said, the way it was written in the books- I don't think anyone came out of reading that and said "like a bitch...", or at least not as many. But after the way it went down in the show, I knew that people would be sounding like Freiza after he broke Vegeta's arm in DBZ:A.
Â 
I just knew that the penchant to make the money shot as grizzly as possible on the show was going to leave Oberyn looking a little bit less "bad-ass" in some eyes. And it did. Again, I can deal with it- just my 2 cents. Nothing I'm gonna drop the show over or curse anyone out for.

2822	The Killer Snark	2014-06-07	Arry - Oberyn does indeed get his eyes gouged out in the novel, but it happens a bit more quickly. First he gets his eyes put out when Gregor slams his fingers through them with his mailed glove. After that, all of his teeth are knocked out or splintered with a punch to the mouth. The third blow dashes his brains out. I think pretty much the essence of his death, which is sort of how I expected they'd do things, was caught by the show. If only they'd been more faithful to the letter when Joffrey got his comeuppance; we could have had a more satisfying experience with him clawing through his throat.

2826	rmholt	2014-06-07	There were definitely waaaaay too many cuts.
Â 
Going to go through that fight and cut how many cuts there are. This is Bourne-level amounts of cutting, and while it makes sense there -- close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat, often in cramped spaces -- this didn't let the fight breathe at all.

I'm trying to read everything but maybe I can get a quick answer- from behind the scenes I thought the actors did all the moves (I had thought maybe some doubling but the B t S made me think Pascal did it all. Including the aerials?
2827	kronosrx8	2014-06-07	To be fair the show's portrayal of the kill is not the far off from the books in terms of realism. I watch a lot of MMA and rarely do you see a fighter landing significant punches let alone a knockout punch from the bottom. When lying on your back, there isn't enough space to throw a hard punch. You just can't put your hips and whole body into it to generate power for the 500 pounds of force required to crush a skull (even with steel gauntlets). However, this is the mountain we are talking about. He basically has the strength of a comic superhero so if GRRM says he can smash Oberyn's head while laying on his back, it isn't too far-fetched to think that he can crush it like he did in the show.Â

I was wondering this exact same thing, but forgot to bring it up. Can anyone give us some insight into this?
Â 
They did talk about Pedro being pretty athletic, and that he had started the Wushu lessons before coming to them, as long prep for the role. Would be cool if he did all his moves, but could understand some of the aerials and butterfly kicks being someone else. I pacticed Wushu for a while before I really had those moves cemented.They can be tricky, and you need to be more flexible to do them than one might think. He really did fantastic with that spear, though. He had much of the Compulsory Gun flourishes and movements down pat... all he'd have to do now is kick Gregor in the face with a 360 Crescent kick and land in a split, and we have the new Jet Li.

Â 
Sometimes some stunts are not done by the actors not because they can't but due to safety. If Pascal breaks a leg during a scene, it's a disaster not due to Pascal being hurt but because production and filming needs to stop. If a scene can be done by someone else, then let someone else do it. If it's needed to see the actor's face, then the actor does it.

Very true. Would love to hear that Pascal was one of those "insisted on doing as many of his own stunts as possible"cases, unrealistic as that expectation is. I love what he did with the role, regardless of how many hop, skips, and jumps he performed himself.
Â 
It's when they start bringing in other actors to do your crying, a la Tropic Thunder, that we should be worried about who to credit. Speaking of that, Ben Stiller would have done well as Orson Lannister, if "Simple Jack" is any indication... Imagine him with blonde hair?
2831	Ran	2014-06-08	I'm trying to read everything but maybe I can get a quick answer- from behind the scenes I thought the actors did all the moves (I had thought maybe some doubling but the B t S made me think Pascal did it all. Including the aerials?He did stuff that sort of provided the lead in or out of certain sequences. For example, we see him doing a very slow spear twirling action for his entrance, and we see him do the flourish out of it. The stuff in between is all the stunt man Liang Yang and so they cut it together; the slowness of Pascal's lead-ins and -outs are masked by cutting really quickly.He may have done some sort of jump or something as a lead into or out of the aerials, but he absolutely did not do anything like those aerial stunts. That takes way more training, and Pascal doesn't have the background.

2832	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-08	Awesome to see those shots of the Wushu athlete... Liang Yang, hmm? I'll have to look him up. I haven't watched Wushu for a while, I wonder if this guy currently competes, or if he ever did? He did a great job.
Â 
I guess I was expecting a little too much of Pedro, thinking that he would have the flourishes and twirling down that flawlessly- and at such speeds, with less than a year to train. I still applaud his efforts.
Â 
Thanks for the info, Ran.
Â 
Edit: Wait, so Gregor really just killed Oberyn's stunt double? The perfect switcharoo! I did kind of think that his head looked a little "off" in the shot where it was being squished! Sneaky bastard.. thought the thumbs and brain matter would obscure our view of the face. So Oberyn is really still alive. Right?

2834	Ran	2014-06-08	Decided to go through the fight and try to see how many of the cuts appear to feature Yang. The opening entrance is about 15 cuts, 10 of which are clearly or very likely to be Yang -- the best giveaway is the fact that the sideburn and beard he has are much darker than Pascal's.And you know, a lot more stuff is Yang than I thought it was, including sequences that seemed fairly straightforward. Stunt parts, I suspect they shot things slow with Pascal and then fast with Yang, and intercut. Other times, for whatever reason, some particular cut looked better with Yang and they went with it when it wasn't too clear that it was the double; I am pretty sure it's Yang we see when the camera is set facing Gregor as he falls to his knee, and Oberyn sidles backwards to the camera, which isn't a stunt shot at all.

2835	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-24	Has anyone seen this picture? http://cdn.winterisc...4/06/queen4.jpg (It's from an article of Elizabeth II visiting the GoT sets).
Oberyns duel-armor is on diplay and it has a helmet on it!!! So why in seven hells didn't they use it, when they already have crafted this helmet??? It would have been both according to the books and much more lifelike.
2836	Ran	2014-06-25	Interesting! Seems vaguely modeled on John Picacio's rendition of the fight. I wonder if that's why it exists -- someone pointed the armorers to it, "but make it leather instead of scale", they made something... and then someone said, "Oh, we didn't mean the helmet".I wonder if that means there's a shield floating around as well.
					
					
							Edited by Rantonio Valencia, 25 June 2014 - 03:29 AM.
2837	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-25	There also is a video from the queen's visit, where you can see the helmet from the front (best seen at min 15:00 to 15:30).
Â 
http://www.youtube.c...d&v=CGuYV2uTOyQ
Â 
Edit: I found this official-looking picture: http://38.media.tumb...4pi7to1_400.jpg
It seems, that at one point in production, there was a helmet and a short sword also (which can be seen better here:http://i.imgur.com/4CqBdBY.png), but still no shield with the Martell sigil.
Â 
Edit2: The helmet even was on set during filiming of the trial: http://winteriscomin...2/RVEllaria.jpg (you can see the helmet just under the flag of house Martell). But still there is no shield, and likely never was.

2838	jakelamotta	2014-07-17	To be fair the show's portrayal of the kill is not the far off from the books in terms of realism. I watch a lot of MMA and rarely do you see a fighter landing significant punches let alone a knockout punch from the bottom. When lying on your back, there isn't enough space to throw a hard punch. You just can't put your hips and whole body into it to generate power for the 500 pounds of force required to crush a skull (even with steel gauntlets). However, this is the mountain we are talking about. He basically has the strength of a comic superhero so if GRRM says he can smash Oberyn's head while laying on his back, it isn't too far-fetched to think that he can crush it like he did in the show.Â 


Â 
Grrm is not per definition describing it more realistically. To me it seems to be easier (albeit not easy) to crush a skull like he does in the show and virtually impossible to do it as its described in the book. Unless you are a giant perhaps. The strength is not in the arms as you say and lying on the back you cant put your body into a punch and it will be significantly weaker.
Now the most realistic would probably be having a combo, that is him being in the postion he has in the show while crushing his skull with a powerful blow or two like in the book. I do not know how big the Mountain is suppose to be though and is obv restricted by the size of the actor here, though he is huge.
And this is not the part I have the most problem with, but its the fact that the Mountain gets a spear through his belly, if his stomach is pierced he would die within minutes from sepsis, it doenst matter how big he is. I guess he can be lucky and the spear missed all major organs and arteries which still seems unlikely but as its described in the show he coughs up blood which means either it was the stomach or the lungs. Either way he's a dead man, poison or no posion.

Uh, no.  He might die from sepsis in hours, but there's no way he would die of it in only a few minutes.  He could die in a few minutes from blood loss, but only if a major blood supply was hit.
2840	jakelamotta	2014-07-17	Uh, no. He might die from sepsis in hours, but there's no way he would die of it in only a few minutes. He could die in a few minutes from blood loss, but only if a major blood supply was hit.


Â 
Perhaps not, I have no clue, it was my sister (nurse) who said so. Might not have been sepsis but that he would die within minutes from a stomach wound. Anyway, the spear through the gut should do it given, I assume, they dont have the tech to fix internal wounds.

2844	Grbauc	2014-06-01	Loved the twist with Sansa Ive read the books a few times and I was wondering what was going to happen..
Loved the Mountain Viper fight I knew the outcome but was shocked all the same... This whole season has been great
2845	Corvinus	2014-06-01	The end of the duel
Sansa's lies
Arya's lol
The way they did Moat Cailin was pretty nice.
2846	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-01	Love the New Sansa. Welcome to the Game Princess
Loved the laughter from Arya. Another dead relative.
The duel was everything I expected for two weeks and entirely too short. (Of course it could have been the entire episode and I wouldn't have minded!)
Â 
Hated the outcome even though I knew it was coming.
2847	The Santa of House Claus	2014-06-01	I loved Arya laughing, it was just so perfect. Also the last 2 scenes with Sansa were great. (I am leaving out the duel and Missandei because, well, they were the easy and obvious answers.)
Â 
I was said about Jorah, but knew it had to happen eventually, that was another outstanding scene.
2848	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-06-01	- Loved Sansa!
- Arya & The Hound as always
- Arya laughing when they told her Lysa died 
- Tyrion's story about the beetles 
- I would kiss the sh*t out of Kit Harrington's lips 
- The battle was epic! Found my self rooting for Oberyn just like when I read it even though I knew what would happen

The fight scene was excellent, although I had to look away. 
I also liked the Grey Worm / Missandei scene.

Sansa's outfit change. She looked damn hott.

Robyn's face and demeanor when talking to Petyr. Seems motivated.
The eye part with Oberyn, BRUTAL.

A small thing, but I was really happy they had Ygritte 'save' Gilly and her baby.

Sansa's hair.
Chamberpot. That had me choke right out loud.
Sansa's lies. Sansa's tears. Sansa's "I know what I'm doing face." Sansa's innocent sounding "yes" when Littlefinger enters her room. Sansa's "I know what you want." Sansa's hair.Â 
The Red Viper's "You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children."
Cersei's bitch face at the end.

2863	dtones520	2014-06-01	Well, I'm going to go on record as saying that the Nathalie Emmanuel boob/ass was the highlight of the episode. She is so damn hot. Sorry girls, you deserve a good nudie scene some day. You did get some Daario ass last week though.
2864	hallam	2014-06-01	I liked the new Sansa, not a character I have cared for up to now in the series or the books. Neither did GRRM it seems as there isn't a lot of Sansa material.
Â 
The fight scene was very well done. After two major scenes that are not in the books, it seemed the fight might have gone the other way right till the end.

Â 
Sansa Stark serving Katniss Everdeen in that dress. Loved everything about her confession scene. Don't want to think how it doesn't make sense logistically within the story. It was good acting.Â 
Â 
Roose Bolton is back. The actor has such a soothing voice.Â 
Â 
Tyrion and Jaime. GRRM should have had them interact more. I think they only had two scenes together in the books: once at Winterfell and then in the Black Cells. I wish we could have seen them be brothers more.Â 
Â 
"Today is not the day I die." Ummm, that's Jojen's line. And... who told you that? Melisandre? Â
2869	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-01	Arya's laugh made my day.Â 
Â 
Girl never even got to meet Lysa and still knew her death was funny
2870	shiola	2014-06-01	I thought the Jorah exile scene was very well done, Dany was so disgusted she couldn't even look Jorah in the eye.

2872	Ankou	2014-06-01	Sansa's mysterious constant sewing finally had a purpose, she was inventing the push-up bra! Baelish approved.
2873	StrollofShame	2014-06-01	Hound's rather SOL on the reward, eh? Another reason for Arya to laugh long n'hard. Also, he referred to her as his "traveling companion". I found that mighty amusing.

2875	juanml82	2014-06-01	Missandei and Grey Worm. Poor guys. It lampshades the reality of Dany's previous statement of "let priests discuss about good and evil. Slavery is real and I can end it. I will end it". And we also get a bit of Dany's Dokrathi not-quite-roots with the whole "she saw you naked? Big deal!"
Â 
Dany banishing Jorah
Â 
Arya's laugh. Poor girl.
Â 
Dark Sansa. Not so much Littlefinger's trial, but the scene at her bedroom and her final appearance. Seven hells, cut the beetles and give us more Dark Sansa!
Â 
The Night's Watch reaction to the attack on Mole's Town. Specially Edd's closing line "The last one remaining be a good lad and burn the bodies. When I'm done with this world, I don't want to return"
Â 
The fight was well done and for a moment it actually seemed like they could have changed it and let Oberyn live but, and I can't believe I'm writing this, it's was mostly just action tossed at the end of a dramatically heavy episode.

- the other brothers being really supportive - just goes to show how close these guys have become

- naked UnsulliedÂ  Â 
- naked MissandeiÂ  Â 
- Missandei + Grey Worm - I love those two together, although now I'm really afraid that something awful is going to happen to one of them

- Ramsay's squid analogy
- Moat Cailin looks very nice and atmospheric
- Theon clearly struggling when telling his story to the IB
- "he'll be just as he was with me" - oh boy
- shot of flayed iron born - great (and very disturbing - I'm glad I was halfway through my dinner already)
- The conversation between Roose and Ramsay was really good, particularly with the call back to the convo with Theon: who are you really?

- Sansa telling the truth, spiced with a few lies to get the perfect outcome - well played!


D&D skipping over the bulk of Sansa's AFFC arc.


- Agreed. This is good news.
- "they die in their beds [Robert Baratheon], they die at their dinner tables [Joffrey], they die squatting over their chamber pots [this is going to be great]"
- Sansa's dressÂ  
Â 
- everything about Jorah's banishment - from Barristan doing the honorable thing by coming to Jorah first, to Jorah trying to save his hide and Dany being unable to look him in the eye when she accuses him
- also: beautiful background shot of Meereen

- the Hound's wound still giving him trouble
- the look on the his face when he found out that Lysa's dead + Arya's laugh

- Jaime + Tyrion = treasure trove of humor 
- the beetle analogy almost made me cry, because it kind of sneaks up on you, but when you think about it...
- "you could at least wear a helmet" - oh god, Tyrion, why did you have to tempt fate... WHYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
- "I'm going to kill that"Â  Â 
- Martell costumes looking really good
- rejoice book readers - all your favorite lines are inÂ  Â 
- Oberyns death was so gory, I had to look away. Thank the gods I had finished dinner. I'm actually still kind of queasy. How did that not get a "graphic violence" warning? Â

2896	A Man Reads	2014-06-02	I really enjoyed meeting the Vale lords. I won't provide any book spoilers, but their interaction with Sansa and Littlefinger struck me as much more authentic. When Robb Stark was proclaimed king and when Cately went to meet Renly, the lords were really just background characters. Tonight we got much more personality and character from them than we normally do in the series.
Â 
Also, I liked Arya's laughing. It made me laugh too!

Smush smush goes the Oberyn dome.
Â 
I really loved this episode.Â
2898	Oberyn's Squire	2014-06-02	I've read the books twice and watched the first three seasons thrice and this is the first time I've liked Sansa. Sophie Turner did a good job with the character in the past but this is the first time I've liked Sansa.
2899	ezraeqonem	2014-06-02	Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve never posted on here before, though Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been reading this forum and watching the show since season 1. But I loved so many things about this episode; I just had to write something.Â 
Â 
I was thinking about the Tyrion/Jaime conversation about how thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a word for every kind of killing, and kind of ticking off in my head how many weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen so far, and then it hit me: Jaime killed his cousin, Alton, back in S2. And here he immediately brought up that thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no word for cousin-killing, like even though the psychological aftermath of that scene was never really explored on-screen, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s still been haunting him all this time. I found that really poignant.Â 
Â 
I also liked Ramsayâ<U+0080><U+0099>s line to â<U+0080><U+009C>Reekâ<U+0080><U+009D> about identity: â<U+0080><U+009C>Remember what you are, and what youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not.â<U+0080><U+009D> I think that the theme of lost identity or â<U+0080><U+009C>forgetting what you areâ<U+0080><U+009D> was kind of stitched through this entire episode. On one hand we have people who do seem to â<U+0080><U+009C>remember what they areâ<U+0080><U+009D>: Sansa reveals who she is; Arya reveals who she is; and Reek kind of goes back to Theon (if whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s who he really is). On the other hand we have people who donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t remember who they are: Theon, again, who is now Reek; Oberyn, who convinces himself that he is invincible, only to be proved horribly wrong; and Ramsay himself, who is given this new identity as a Bolton. The bastard connection especially is so fascinating because Ramsayâ<U+0080><U+0099>s advice to Reek is really just a twisted version of Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s advice to Jon in S1 (i.e. â<U+0080><U+009C>Let me tell you something, Bastard. Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.â<U+0080><U+009D>)Â
2900	TheBlackViper	2014-06-02	I'm too distraught to talk about this episode, but one detail I really loved were the runes in Bronze Yohn's cape.
Â 
And what I hope was Ser Daemon Sand making an appearance.

2901	MotherofStrife	2014-06-02	Arya's crazy laughter was funny but when the fuck is this thing with the Hound going to end?? Enough already!
Â 
Theon and Ramsay
Â 
Indira Varma's perfect costume and her perfect hair and .... she's just perfect.
Â 
Oberyn's death was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen , I'm still nauseous , ughh
2902	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-02	Gaaaah this thread stems my "are you not entertained?!??!" rage.
Â 
To note a few less-mentioned....
Â 
Theon's heartbreaking "can we go home?" OMG Alfie Allen you can't just do this to me!Â 
Â 
The Ironborn guy turning on his "staunch and stupid" commander. Sry Theon, it wasn't "just you"...just your Starkish desire for a glorious last stand. Loved the parallel...what was left of Theon seemed to see his corpse and see the ghost of himself, and realize how foolish he was not to book it.
Â 
Ehee, Ramsay sinking to his knees before Roose....put me in the middle of that sandwich.... 
Â 
"I need a bath." You get yer bath....I hope Winterfell has a Harrenhal-style tub arrangementÂ   Oh the character drama!
Â 
SANSA! Fucking Sansa, mah bb girl growing up.I loved her demure shakedown of Baelish. "Yeah, dood, I saved your ass and don't you forget I have a thousand-year-old name and you have a Braavosi grandpa."
2903	NightStark	2014-06-02	Sandor actually referring to himself as 'The Hound'
2904	Allison of Tarth	2014-06-02	Dark Sansa, holy crap. So good. Roose being his typical BAMF self. Oberyn's mask of cocky swagger boiling over into rage and bloodlust, followed by the horrendous reversal. The fight itself was meh for me but the emotional notes were perfectly executed.
Arya's laugh (which I took mainly to be at the Hound's expense), and the brotherly interactions between Tyrion and Jaime.

2905	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	Really loved Jorah and Dany dynamic this episode
2906	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	Â 
Arya's laugh (which I took mainly to be at the Hound's expense)

Part of it really was schadenfraude on her part. "lololol you dont get yer ransom! SUCKER~" But also her going "dude, all this traveling and bullshit and that bitch is dead. Fucking...looooool"
2907	Jorah the Explorer	2014-06-02	Missandei's body.
Dolorous Edd the scene stealer.
Sophie Turner acting.
Oberyn twirls.
Roose. Â Looks like he needs some leeching though, is starting to age.
2908	Sun	2014-06-02	I loved Orson's Beetles. Absolutely adored that scene.Â 
I also loved Arya laughing. Classic PTSD reaction.
2909	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-06-02	The fight and the ending. Damn, Oberyn's screaming will give me nightmares. Pedro Pascal gave one hell of a performance. Kudos.
Sansa's new look and her "truths".
Arya LOL'ing at Lysa's death.
And also, for some reason, Ramsay, Reek and Roose riding for Winterfell gave me goosebumps. I guess it just felt good seeing the good ol' place again after a season-long absense.
2910	Red Tiger	2014-06-02	Strange, I thought the duel would be the highlight of the episode for me, but it was Sansa from start to finish.
Â 
I also loved the scene with the BOlton army and Missandei's beautiful naked body.
2911	Revenge of the Imp	2014-06-02	The Ramsey Snow/Bolton and Theon Greyjoy/Reek finally going "full circle" and wrapped with a bow at this point.
Â 
Theon, going from Prince of the IB, to Reek which obviously been going on for a while now.Â  Last episode or two, the sister states her brother is dead when she was running back to the boat from the failed rescue.Â  I don't feel too sorry for Theon given the bbq job he did in Winterfell to those farmer's children.
Â 
On the other hand, Ramsey has gone from being a Snow (aka bastard child) to gradually gain favor with his dad, Lord Bolton.Â  This episode Ramsey Snow is now a recognized Bolton and became warden of the north.
Â 
One has been losing everything while the other gained everything.Â  It feels like Ramsey just took it from Theon.Â  Don't get me wrong, Ramsey is a sick SOB but I just thought it was pulled together well.
Â 
The Mountain and Red Viper Battle was epic.Â  The details used when The Mountain was giving the Viper the eye message was pretty cool (Viper's teeth truly looked jacked up).Â  The battle was well choreographed. I thought the tie went to the runner as they both died (like in baseball) but I guess that's not the case with poor Tyrion (talk about taking defeat from the jaws of victory- definately a swing of emotions there for the Imp).Â  Sersei's look was pretty cool at that point as she looked like she just ate a Snicker's Bar (Snicker's satifies).
Â 
Sansa's dye job....looks like she's finally "womaning up" from being a "little girl" mentally (catapillar to butterfly).Â  I'm a little worried about her though after hearing Littlefinger's little speech about Sansa not really knowing him as wellÂ  as she thinks she does.
Â 
Also, wth is up with the villagers?Â  I thought they knew wildlings were around attacking other villages.Â  Why were they getting drunk and unprepared for an attack?Â  Let's see...get drunk, get killed and become a hors derve for the Thenn?...get the hell out of the village and hide in the woods?....have a watch and prepare for battle?Â  I don't know but the last two options seem more appealing than option 1.
Â 
Overall a very good episode.
Â 
Â
2912	Sigrunn	2014-06-02	I was pleasantly surprised by Arya's laughter and Sansa's lies.
2913	LordBloodraven	2014-06-02	Oberyn screaming while the Mountain was gouging his eyes out. Gruesome death. I don't "like" it but...
Â 
Sansa playing the game, at last. How happy right now must be the Sansans 
Â 
The Meereen scenes.
2914	Koi No Yokan	2014-06-02	- Basically the entire cutting of Sansa's AFFC arc. Thank you.
Â 
- While Sophie Turner has been great all season, this was by far my favourite Sansa episode.
Â 
- Arya's laughter. I don't even... just too dark, cute, funny, all rolled into one.
Â 
- Dany dealing with Jorah. Them feels.
Â 
- Missandei and Grey Worm, love this addition.
Â 
Â 
Â 
- Oh, and the duel was fantastic, except for... you know. Me hating George all over again.
2915	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-02	I haven't seen the episode yet (I must wait till today afternoon :-( ), only watched the Roose/Ramsay scene on yt (because I missed Roose and was too curious); Boltons + Reek + huge army riding to Winterfell gave me so goosebumps and I also loved their dialogue, somehow it really reminded me on Simba/Mufasa at the beginning of "The Lion's King" 
-Roose: "Look, Ramsay. Everything the light touches is our kingdom."
-Ramsay: "Wow."
-Roose: "A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Ramsay, the sun will set on my time here, and will rise with you as the new king."
-Ramsay: "And this'll all be mine?"
-Roose: "Everything."
-Ramsay: "Everything the light touches..."
XD
2916	Hippocras	2014-06-02	I really quite loved it when Arya started cackling on news of Lysa's death.
Â 
Really quite a perfect way to express both her, and viewers' frustration at all the near-reunions that keep getting messed up by events. It made it possible for the show to get away with yet another missed reunion, and also have us fear for Arya's sanity after all she has been through.
2917	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-02	I loved how much agency they gave Sansa. It made me do a little wee in my pants.
2918	Batman	2014-06-02	Mountain fatality ending was good.
Â 
Any Edd.
2919	Queen of Whores	2014-06-02	- Oberyn's sneaky little line about Tyrion being in a fighting pit. Hehe....
- Littlefinger's sneaky line about dying on a chamber pot. Lawwwlll....
- The extended single take at the start of the episode in the brothel. That was nice and unexpected.
- And of course,Â Nathalie Emmanuel. My goodness, that woman....Â  Â 
ETA: Also, the actor that plays Roose seriously owns every scene he is in, however short. I could listen to him talk all day. The scene where Barristan goes to Jorah with the letter was quite powerful to. The slow look of dread of Jorah's face was very tragic.Â

2920	Cat Alayne	2014-06-02	One of my favourite episodes of Game of thrones so far!
Â 
I loved Oberyn's fighting style, the easy confidence combined with utter hatred that pedro portrayed was sublime. I really am going to miss him and i felt genuine sadness for hours after i watched it.Â 
Â 
Ellaria's scream at the end was amazing

Watching the lannister children's reaction during the fight, particarly Jaime when oberyn stabbed him
Â 
I didn't think the beetle speech was a waste at all, i thought it was so Tyrion but also reflected the mountain i thought.
Â 
Also NKW my darling you and your melancholy looks at tyrion give me so many feelings. Episode ten will kill my soul.
Â 
I loved Arya's scene. On first watch i laughed because of how funny it was, but on the second watch it made me really really sad. Arya has gotten so dark and that was her last hope to be with family and it was just extinguished brutally. Yet she is so far gone she can only laugh hysterically.Â 
Â 
Sansa's scenes. Wow. I have never felt such creeps watching GOT before. I never even got these vibes from the books (excepting pedofinger lusts).Â It kind of feels like she's luring him on and nothing freaks me out more. I loved the introduction of the lords declarant. I have been missing straight noble characters in the series so Anya Waynwood and Bronze Yohn Royce are welcome to me.Â 
Â 
I have just been loving the wall scenes this season too, even though they have been largely uneventful. I have gone from really disliking Kit Harrington to looking forward to all his scenes. This scene gave me so much hype for next week.
Â 
Roose and Ramsey's scene was awesome. Michael is such a powerful actor and Iwan is so creepy looking. It was strange on surface value the scene seems like a heartfelt exchange between father and son. Knowing who they are its so incongruous.
Â 
ALFIE!! Not enough credit is given to this awesome actor.
Â 
I also really liked the opening scene. Some funny dialogue, really immersive and then some fun wildlingsÂ
2921	MoIaF	2014-06-02	Â 
I loved the no eye contact thing, too!


Â 
Emilia catches a lot of flack for her acting (sometimes warranted) but I thought she did a great job with this scene. Ian was excellent as per usual.
2922	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-02	Sansa was amazing. 
Jorah getting vannished was great. 
Theon taking most callin was great. 
Lords declerant were awesome. 
I loved everythig apart from one or two scenes
2923	Ser Hugh BuckweII	2014-06-02	Seeing Winterfell for the first time in just under two seasons was very pleasant.
Â 
I also liked Jaime's line about the pedo maesterÂ
2924	HelenaExMachina	2014-06-02	Anya Waynwood, what a glorious casting that turned out to be. Also liked Yohn Royce.
2925	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-06-02	This was such a great episode, there was nothing that I didn't like. Â 
I LOVED the scene between Missandei and Grey Worm and that actually had me in tears. The acting was so so good.
Â 
I enjoyed Sansa's deviations from the books and finally my DH likes Sansa b/c she's doing something and coming off as strong.Â 
Â 
I loved Arya LOLing at the news of her aunt's death. That was perfect.
Â 
The creepiness of Ramsay becoming a Bolton.Â 
Â 
I enjoyed Tyrion's story although I'm still mulling over it. It was powerfully delivered.
Â 
I thought the fight scene was perfection as well. I really wanted to see him pull that same feeling I had in the book when he repeats what the Mountain did to Elia and her children and Pedro Pascal was spot on.
Â 
I liked the little quiet moment between Missandei and Dany - it's those little moments that we've been missing from Dany's story. Â I liked the feeling of ambiguity that we were left with when Dany banished Jorah.

2932	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-02	Omg love everything Sansa did. I had to watch the lie scene twice so good! And did you see her step out at the end?! New dress, new do, new attitude ughhh so good. Great job Sophie
Arya's laugh! Funny thing for me is that I bursted into laughter like a second or two before she did so that made it an even better moment
Ellaria Sand's outfit. Dornish wear is in this season- Westerosi shoulder pads edition! Oh and her scream at the end was just...
Cersei "Queen B!tch's smile at the results
Tywin dismissing Pycelle
I liked the Wall scene only because it had Jon and his inner circle only (Sam, Grenn, Edd & Pyp) but I didn't really care too much for what they were saying
I liked Gilly standing up for herself against that wretched whore. God those were some dirty whores
Oh and the duel of course... Was it just me or did anybody else think that when the squire was "oiling up" or cleaning Oberyn's spear or w/e he doing, that he was actually lacing it w/ poison?
2933	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-02	Anya Waynwood, what a glorious casting that turned out to be. Also liked Yohn Royce.Anya Waynwood, what a glorious casting that turned out to be. Also liked Yohn Royce.

Right?! And her hairdo was particularly cute
2934	voodooqueen126	2014-06-02	Sansa's look at LF when she is crying on Anya Waynwood's shoulder.
Ellaria's scream. The dual was pretty good actually.
"Some men die on their chamber pots."
Ygritte sparing Gilly.
2935	BuggerThemAll	2014-06-02	Arya laughing. That had my hubby and I rolling.  Mostly because that's exactly how we would have reacted.
Sansa's lies. The actor is doing a phenomenal job.
The dying over chamber pots quote by Petyr.
Jorah's storyline being pushed further.
Missandei and Grey Worm. God, they're gorgeous.  So precious, too.
Roose Bolton's sexy voice.
2936	Mel_Rose	2014-06-02	Loved the episode!
Â 
Loved Sansa's new attitude and her new frock and that beautifully-lit scene in her bedroom.
Â 
Not sure I can say I loved the duel, it certainly traumatised me more than any other scene ever. So, yeah, it was awesome.
Â 
Loved: the beetle speech/analogy. Gods/fate/nature killing millions, billions of people for no discernible reason. If one went in the realm of death, they'd see dead people as far as the eye can reach.Â  A condemned man pondering the meaning of life.
Â 
Roose Bolton, you are so hot and I have missed you.
Â 
Love watching Ramsay and Theon. Their acting is superb imo.
Â 
Hats off to Pedro Pascal, you'll be sorely missed - took a minor-ish badass-y role and made him truly memorable. In reddit every single person sings his praises re: his portrayal of Oberyn and justly so.

Good to find someone who also enjoyed this scene. It's like Tyrion said god thenselves were simpletons, amused with all the beetle mashing. Maybe this comparison is only over my head, I don't think Tyrion intended to make this analogy.

I was skeptical at first. But he was a damn fine Oberyn. He could've used more screentime though...
2938	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-02	Theon absolutely destroyed me. His voice was shaking the whole time in Moat Cailin, and when that guy spit in his face and started yelling at him, he completely fell apart, and it was horrifying.
2939	noelle	2014-06-02	Sansa's lie was well done... I was misled by trailer 
For the first time I liked Theon and Ramsay part.
Ygritte and Gilly scene.
Â 
my favourite:Â Ayra's psycho laughter
Â 
But still I'm very sad about Oberyn.
2940	ground_control	2014-06-02	I liked thinking of Sandor and Arya as Jay and Silent Bob..."I'm Sandor Clegane (The Hound), and this is my platonic traveling partner, Arya Stark."
2941	joachim	2014-06-02	I had felt that it would be perfect if his banishment scene were the first time Jorah actually said "Daenerys," and it was perfect.
2942	shiola	2014-06-02	I haven't had a chance Â to read all your thoughts yet, but what I've seen so far is great! Â I love people hopping on board this thread each week. Â You all point out the most wonderful things. Â Makes an incredible show evenÂ better! Â Thank you all
2943	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-06-02	I liked everything but I have to make a special mention to the addition of Missandei/Grey Worm and the beetle's story, so many analogies can be made, from the way the gods entertain themselves to the Mountain's mindless killing...
2944	ground_control	2014-06-02	Also, was I the only one who thought the entire Moat Cailin / Roose + Ramsey scenes this episode were pretty close to this movie:Â http://www.youtube.c...n02xr7o#t=3m30s
2945	Angmar	2014-06-02	Sansa dress.Â That look like the result after Melisandre and Margaery had sex with each other. Their love child.
2946	Scrambled Aegon	2014-06-02	There's this thing Ramsay's actor does that I really love. Last season, all we saw of Ramsay was over-the-top batshit mode, because that's where he was in the storyline. This season, he's been much more cordial with people, so it's easy to forget that he's the same horrifying guy we dealt with last season. But every now and then, when he wants Reek to do something, his actor does this thing where he changes his tone of voice for just a second to make himself threatening, and then goes back to being normal and cordial.
Â 
The first time we saw the specific thing I'm talking about was in the bath scene a few episodes ago: Ramsay says "Remove your britches"; Reek doesn't do it; Ramsay says "...now." I loved his delivery of that line.. it wasÂ right on the verge of being angry but without actually losing his cool, and was just enough to make the viewer and Reek remember that this guy is in control and this guy is fucking scary, because if you don't do what he tells you to do, heÂ will punish you.
Â 
He did the same exact thing again this week. I still haven't rewatched the ep, so I don't remember exactly when it was, but I'm pretty sure he said, "Now..Â who are you?" I can't really describe it, you have to listen for it, but the way that he changes the sound of his voice there and in that part in the bath scene is incredible. It'sÂ just enough to remind you how scary this guy is and it's really, really chilling when he says those things to remind Theon, "I'm being nice to you now, but if you're ever thinking of disobeying me,Â don't forget what I've done to you." There's no direct threat at all -- it's just the way that he sounds when he makes his demands that's so intimidating.
Â 
eta: "What do you tell them?" was the line I was thinking of this week

2950	Seneti	2014-06-02	Everyone keeps talking about Oberyn's squished head but how bout the super flayed iron born fatty, flayed to gills where you can see his lungs inside his rib cage. YIPES.


Â 
Yeah, that was gruesome, too, but... I don't know... for me it's the sound effects that really sold Oberyn's death for me. That, and I get queasy every time I watch somebody get an injury to their eyes or tendons, because in my head I immediately get the image of how painful and crippling that would be. *shudder*
Â 


Â 
I was thinking about the Tyrion/Jaime conversation about how thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a word for every kind of killing, and kind of ticking off in my head how many weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen so far, and then it hit me: Jaime killed his cousin, Alton, back in S2. And here he immediately brought up that thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no word for cousin-killing, like even though the psychological aftermath of that scene was never really explored on-screen, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s still been haunting him all this time. I found that really poignant.Â 


Â 
Yeah, that one completely passed me by until I read about it on TV Tropes later, but it's a really nice callback. Also, Jaime's sudden admission of "Maester XY... *ugh* tried to touch me once" had me going "WUT?"Â  Â  
Â 


Part of it really was schadenfraude on her part. "lololol you dont get yer ransom! SUCKER~" But also her going "dude, all this traveling and bullshit and that bitch is dead. Fucking...looooool"


Â 
That's how I saw it, too. And I couldn't help but laugh with her.
Â 


Oh and the duel of course... Was it just me or did anybody else think that when the squire was "oiling up" or cleaning Oberyn's spear or w/e he doing, that he was actually lacing it w/ poison?


Â 
I thought so, too, the moment I saw that scene.Â
2951	The Lord of Cinder	2014-06-02	Unlike a lot of people, I really like the Theon and Ramsay scenes. It's almost more horrifying to see what Theon has become than it was to read about it. Also, I almost felt happy for Ramsay when he became a Bolon, but then I remembered who he was.
Â 
The Eyrie scenes were great, and I just love how Sansa is turning into one of them, into a convincing liar, a manipulator, a player in the Game of Thrones. Arya's laugh was both funny and scary at the same time, and it kinda reminded me of the crawl space scene where Walter loses it. Poor Hound, everyone who's around Arya always has the worst luck.
Â 
I actually liked the beetle conversation, as it can mean many things to both Tyrion and the watcher. Maybe it was a look at how pointless all our striving is. What is important to one person may seem meaningless to another. You could compare it to someone spending most of their time watching television or playing games or commenting on forums. What's the point? What do we achieve? We enjoy it, sure, but you could as well be crushing beetles. More likely it was about how there rarely is any justice in the world. You can't really understand why the stuff that is happening is happening, and you can't really understand why Orson had to kill all those beetles. Or it could just be about GRRM crushing the hearts of readers and viewers.
Â 
And of course the duel. I knew what was going to happen, and it was horrible. I was shaking afterwards, and I doubt I'll be able to remove the image of Oberyn's bleeding eyes or his crushed head. Why?! He was such a cool guy!
Â 
Oh, and naked Missandei

Fanservice: appreciated.Â Â  Â
2954	GHOSTSTARK	2014-06-02	thought it was a really good episode minus the Missandei and Grey Worm filler. I really liked Sansas scene and how it was different from the book. its nice to see her finally doing something for herself. Interested to see how they will finish Arya and Sandors scenes.

Iain Glen's acting.
2958	Indigocell	2014-06-02	It's cool how Roose's "Who are you?" to Ramsay was directly linked to Ramsay's "Who are you?" to Theon.Â  It really shows the influence of the father on the son.Â  Consider how Jon turned out having grown up accepted among the Starks contrasting with Ramsay who was rejected and has clearly never gotten over that.
2959	Hath4	2014-06-02	well ramsay was raised by his mother and reek. Both of them kept reminding him of his rights. they are the ones who created him. roose did not meet him until he was an adult. that's why they have such different styles. ramsay wants to be his father. His main desire is to be a Bolton. that's why he killed his brother. So no one could stand in his way. roose is stuck with him and ramsay knows that. both are psychopaths the main difference being that ramsay is also a sadist who is even turned on by his own twisted ness. Roose while cruel usually commits crimes when he fells it's pragmatic to do so. he is not one for random violence, ramsay well his hunts tell you all you need to know on that front. They are extreme and evil, but they go about it in extremely different ways.

2960	Indigocell	2014-06-02	What you are saying goes entirely to my point.Â 
Â 
That being that if Ramsay had been raised by Roose instead, he would still be an evil prick, but probably less of a sadist and would likely not have the same chip on his shoulder.Â  Hence why I referenced the impact a father can have on their son by simply accepting them.

2962	Gneisenau	2014-06-02	Moat Cailin scene and Roose giving Ramsay the decree.
2963	MoseStark*	2014-06-02	Was it just me or was the acting in this episode really good? I mean, normally Emilia Clarke is not the best actress in the world, but she was great in her scene with Jorah... Iain Glenns acting was superb as ever. Sophie Turner just nailed all her scenes. Maisie Williems laugh was awesome and her scene with Rory McCan was of great acting (I have to say, Maisie is one of the most constant factors in the series, her acting is always on spot). Nikolaj Coster Waldau en Peter Dinklage have a great chemistry. Alfie Allen was so good delivering his speech at Moat Cailin. And of course a moment of silence for Pedro Pascal, who I'm missing already.
Â 
Things I loved:
- Arya's laugh
- Jorah's departure and his scene with Barristan
- Dany talking about the Dothraki (we hear to less about her past with Drogo and the Khalasar)
- The fight
- Ellaria's scream
- The monologue about the beetles just made me laugh
- The new look of Sansa
- Theon/Reek's "Can we go home now?"
- Roose being an ass
And well, actually everything in this episode.
2964	Queen of Whores	2014-06-02	I loved the cinematography of Roose and Ramsay's talk. You could feel the isolation and coldness of the North and it's hills. I could feel the bitter wind blowing as they talked. Northern Ireland was such a great choice for a filming location.
I also loved the scene mixed with the music of the Bolton army marching to Winterfell, with the Bolton flags all but consuming Winterfell. If this is the last scene we see of them this season, it was a very good one.

Ughhh as much as I hate to admit but yes I liked that shot of Bolton's army as well. Actually I agree w/ all your points except the exile, I needed to feel a bit more anguish from Danaerys. Remember in the books when she was all like "TELL HIM JORAH! TELL HIM ITS A LIE YOU WERE THERE FROM THE FIRST, MY WEDDING, WE TRAVELED THE RED WASTE TOGETHER AND SURVIVED QARTH. TELL HIM!" that whole bit.
And I love love love your avatar haha
2966	BearQueen87	2014-06-02	I thought Emilia Clarke did well as Dany--coldly angry, unable to even look at Jorah. Iain Glen is wonderful as always. I knew this scene was coming even though I had hoped that they wold bypass this moment from the books. I love Dany and Jorah so seeing the scene on TV broke my heart a bit.
Â 
The duel---WOW. Just WOW
Â 
Sansa is entering the Game. The look she gives LF as she comes down the staircase..oh boy. She might have the upper hand on him.
2967	A Man Reads	2014-06-02	I loved the cinematography of Roose and Ramsay's talk. You could feel the isolation and coldness of the North and it's hills. I could feel the bitter wind blowing as they talked. Northern Ireland was such a great choice for a filming location.
I also loved the scene mixed with the music of the Bolton army marching to Winterfell, with the Bolton flags all but consuming Winterfell. If this is the last scene we see of them this season, it was a very good one.


I loved that scene too. Their walk up the moor was another visual symbol of the rise of the Boltons (there was another when Roose climbed onto the roof of the Twins at the beginning of "Mysa," S3E10). Also the Bolton host marching to Winterfell paralleled the Stark departure scene from "The Kingsroad," S1E2. It's a perfect closing scene for the Bolton story line this season.

2968	Hath4	2014-06-02	the scene of the boltons and reek riding towards winterfell was perfect, roose quiet and reserved, ramsay hungrily looking at his new castle and poor reek wondering just how humiliating the bath he has to give ramsay will be.
2969	Young Nan	2014-06-02	I love how "Positive Nitpicking" is by far the shortest topic LOL. Â 
Â 
Anyhow, I really liked Indira Varma's reactions and facial expressions during the fight scene. Â I think she's doing a great job as Ellaria Sand. Â 
Â 
Also enjoyed *most* of the fight scene between the Red Viper and Gregor. Â I know people thought the spins and flips were over-the-top, but to me, that is consistent with his character- he wanted the fight to be a spectacle and was over-confident. Â 
Â 
I also thought Sophie Turner is really coming into her own as an actress, and it showed in this episode. Â It's nice to see that her range also shows her being more sly and intelligent, up to this point they have just portrayed her as a whiney victim. Â
2970	Paulo Passos	2014-06-02	Loved Arya laughing
2971	Tywin	2014-06-02	Missandei's naked body.

2972	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-06-02	I love how "Positive Nitpicking" is by far the shortest topic LOL.Â

2975	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-06-02	I just have to say one of the best moments in the episode for me was Ellaria Sand's reaction to Oberyn's death. Just STUNNINGLY acted. Indira Varma as Ellaria this season overall was just perfect.Â 
Â 
Other awesome moments were Ramsay/Theon/Moat Cailin. I actually felt so bad for that Iron born who got flayed. The acting involved in those scenes from everyone was impeccable.Â 
Bolton army marching- evil version of Dany's marching with her new Unsullied last season.Â 
Oberyn scene.... I Â can't believe he's gone Â
2976	Talleyrand	2014-06-02	Arya's laugh, Ellaria's scream and Pascal's delivery of the Dornish version of the Inigo Motoya speech
2977	lostinasia	2014-06-02	I just have to say one of the best moments in the episode for me was Ellaria Sand's reaction to Oberyn's death. Just STUNNINGLY acted. Indira Varma as Ellaria this season overall was just perfect.Â 


Glad to see other people are commenting on that as well. I don't often think TV screams are "bad" - unlike screamed "Nooooooo!" scenes, which are best left on the cutting room floor - but Varma's scream was one of the first times I've reallyÂ feltÂ some of the anguish coming through.
Â 
Also loved when Sansa came down the stairs, not exactly because I like the direction (undecided yet), but more because of the giddy "Wow! I don't know where this is going next!" feeling that's going to become more and more common over the next season or two. Definitely liked that she's taking more control.
Â 
Arya's laugh was so wonderful and funny and sad.
Â 
And one thing that amused me: I spoiled my mother long ago on much of the series, up to and including the Purple Wedding (at her request!); I refused to tell her who would win the fight. And she really really wishes I'd told her, because she didn't like the shock. I can see her point. I'll re-watch the episode, but I may not watch the last few seconds of the fight ever again.
2978	go joff go	2014-06-02	Sansa's look at LF when she is crying on Anya Waynwood's shoulder.
Ellaria's scream. The dual was pretty good actually.
"Some men die on their chamber pots."
Ygritte sparing Gilly.that look sansa gave lf was pretty awesome .it could mean so many things yet she was able to make it look like a mask. One of my favorite moments for sure
2979	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-06-02	Tyrion and Jaime interaction. That scene was unnecessarily long, but I loved the start of it.
Arya's laugh. She's just thinking, "Oh for fuck's sake." I would have been thinking the same.
2980	Emperoreddy	2014-06-02	the scene of the boltons and reek riding towards winterfell was perfect, roose quiet and reserved, ramsay hungrily looking at his new castle and poor reek wondering just how humiliating the bath he has to give ramsay will be.


Â 
Music was spot on. Hint of the Stark/Winterfell scene just made it seem like a sad twisted return to the city.
2981	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-02	Also love Ellaria's screaming. It haunted my dreams last night. Add me to the group who won't watch the last minutes of the fight again. Knowing didn't help, it was one of the goriest things I've seen on cable or TV (and I grew up watching the Vietnam War on television!)
Â 
Love Sansa finally entering the Game of Thrones. She has spent an enormous amount of time watching the best in the game, now it's time to put that knowledge to use. She may become Petyr's master if he isn't careful.
Â 
Dany's performance. So many people hate her but this time she was spot on. Just the right mix of angry, betrayed woman and hurt friend. Unable to look him in the eye for fear of breaking down. I feel for Jorah but, the past always comes back to haunt us. My question was: did Tywin send another copy of the letter? Or did the child still have it from the original handover?Â 
Â 
Now that the Oberyn/Mountain fight is over, bring on Stannis and the Wall. I have a feeling that by the time that is all over with, Jon Snow will know something, if not everything!
2982	Edmure's Floppy Fish	2014-06-02	Arya's lol.
Sansa's hair.
Chamberpot. That had me choke right out loud.
Sansa's lies. Sansa's tears. Sansa's "I know what I'm doing face." Sansa's innocent sounding "yes" when Littlefinger enters her room. Sansa's "I know what you want." Sansa's hair.Â 
The Red Viper's "You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children."
Cersei's bitch face at the end.

2986	Bear Island	2014-06-03	I had some major, major issues with the episode but there were also some things I liked a lot.
- Although I despised how they put LF at Sansa's mercy, I love love loved Sophie's performance. I thought she did a fantastic job, even if the content was out of character and weird.
- I thought the Ramsay Snow legitimisation scene was very well done, and it made it seem like Roose maybe actually cared about the North.
- Apart from all the stupid twirling, I thought Pedro Pascale did a fantastic job expressing Oberyn's rage and desperation to hear The Mountain's confession.
- Even though it didn't belong there, I really love seeing Braavos on the map, with the Titan and the coins travelling down the aqua ducts.
- I had no issue with the beetle scene apart from how long it went for, I love Jaime and Tyrion's dynamic.
- I was surprised to see The Hound and Arya this episode, but I liked their scene even if it was problematic. Theirs is another dynamic I greatly enjoy.

You do have a point though I think the show has decided to simplify Daenerys's current personality, all her inner turmoils from the Meereen period has been excluded so far (meaning her inner battle about sleeping with Daario or not sleeping with Daario because Oh she still misses Drogo but he is dead, but she still feels like cheating on his memory etc, or her moments of insecurity about whether she's doing the right thing and whether she's a good ruler etc) these aren't really portrayed on the show, this season she's majorly shown as a confident and ruthless ruler with a strong sense of justice. I think the scene channelled this perfectly while still showing that she was shaken to learn of Jorah'a treachery. 
Haha, thanks

Also this exchange cracked me up:
Â 
Jorah: "Khaleesi"
Dany "Don't call me that"
Â 
Reminds me of all the show only watchers who call her "khaleesi" and all the book readers responding with "That is not her name!"
2997	Krutoon	2014-06-03	Although the drawn-out beetle monologue was not my favorite, Jaime's "he tried to touch me" made me giggle. NCW does the best he can with what he is given.
Â 
I don't know if any of y'all play Dragon Age, but Sansa's costume change from scared little girl (pawn) to evil Disney queen (player) reminded me of Anders in DA2 when he gets his black costume later in the game. But I liked it.
Â 
Pedro Pascal is the best. He did a great job with the duel scene and conveying that behind all the flash, Oberyn at his core is driven by getting justice for his family. That goal surpassed all else.

Unfortunately that's Nestor Royce. The show once again decided to mix up/combine characters, and they made Waymar to be Nestor's son. I still hope we get to see Bronze Yohn Royce, and he should be played by someone imposing, who can show that he can fight.

Per the imdb, it is Bronze Yohn Royce (http://www.imdb.com/...ef_=tt_ov_st_sm)
Â 
I wouldn't be surprised if we never hear of Nestor, since it looks like the whole Lord's Declarant story line is being skipped.

Mole's town getting hit

True. Feathered shoulderpads ftw.

Dany and Jorah. Emilia did a good job with this scene, this was her best work in this season so far.
Oberyn getting increasingly angry and calling out Tywin
Roose legitimizing Ramsay as his heir. The scenery of the North and the Bolton banners flying, very well done.
Ellaria's scream. Ellaria and Oberyn together in their last scenes. They were the best couple on this show.  I knew what was coming, but Oberyn's gory death hit me hard.

Yea I agree maybe they can include the inner turmoil stuff next yr when hopefully they start the Sons of the Harpy storyline and instead of braiding hair and talking stones & pillars w/ Missandei, she can sort of let her guard down a little and lean on her since they're becoming close. I'd much rather them start having a more intimate, personal relationship (away from court of course) since Missy is older and finally show the wisdom w/in her we know her to be capable of. I mean she cant share her doubts and woes w/ Barristan or Daario. Also I'd like to hear them talk more about Rhaegar and maybe an appearance from Qaithe?

Â 
I think the hair braiding thing wasn't as pointless as it seemed. I mean, yeah, it was kinda pointless and they could have spent those 2 minutes on something better (like talking about Rhaegar or Hizdhar or Daario or something relevant), but the setup itself did say something about Daenerys. You know, back in S01, she was the one getting her hair braided by Irri learning Dothraki and talking about men with Doreah, and now she's a confident grown up woman and she's the one braiding Missandei's hair and the more experienced with romance. So in a way that scene was a nice motif showing how the roles changed and how she's so different now. Other than that, I absolutely agree, they are throwing screentime out of the window and purposely delaying important plot lines just so ASOS can take up 2 entire seasons which it wouldn't, in truth, if they pulled themselves together and paid just a tiny bit more mind to the story.Â 
Â 
I doubt Qaithe will appear. I had really high hopes for frequent Rhaegar references after the first episode, but alas... I also had very high hopes for a medal with Elia's portrait inside that Oberyn would show somebody (not just because I'm a hopeless Elia fan, but also because it would have materialized her and why Oberyn is here and kinda made it memorable for the audience) or something similar. I expected just a brief conversation between Ellaria and Oberyn about Elia, we got to see too little of them too... Well, what I'm saying is that's all about hopes and expectations Â 
Â 


Â 
Ellaria's scream. Ellaria and Oberyn together in their last scenes. They were the best couple on this show.  I knew what was coming, but Oberyn's gory death hit me hard.

"People die squatting over their chamber pots."

Wait for it........


Is it just me or does no spoilers actually mean NO SPOILERS!!! As in NONE, NOTHING, NADA! 8 out of the 10 topics for this episode are for spoilers and you still can't help yourselves. Pathetic.

Â 
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve never posted on here before, though Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been reading this forum and watching the show since season 1. But I loved so many things about this episode; I just had to write something.Â 
Â 
I was thinking about the Tyrion/Jaime conversation about how thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a word for every kind of killing, and kind of ticking off in my head how many weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen so far, and then it hit me: Jaime killed his cousin, Alton, back in S2. And here he immediately brought up that thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no word for cousin-killing, like even though the psychological aftermath of that scene was never really explored on-screen, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s still been haunting him all this time. I found that really poignant.Â 
Â 
I also liked Ramsayâ<U+0080><U+0099>s line to â<U+0080><U+009C>Reekâ<U+0080><U+009D> about identity: â<U+0080><U+009C>Remember what you are, and what youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not.â<U+0080><U+009D> I think that the theme of lost identity or â<U+0080><U+009C>forgetting what you areâ<U+0080><U+009D> was kind of stitched through this entire episode. On one hand we have people who do seem to â<U+0080><U+009C>remember what they areâ<U+0080><U+009D>: Sansa reveals who she is; Arya reveals who she is; and Reek kind of goes back to Theon (if whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s who he really is). On the other hand we have people who donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t remember who they are: Theon, again, who is now Reek; Oberyn, who convinces himself that he is invincible, only to be proved horribly wrong; and Ramsay himself, who is given this new identity as a Bolton. The bastard connection especially is so fascinating because Ramsayâ<U+0080><U+0099>s advice to Reek is really just a twisted version of Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s advice to Jon in S1 (i.e. â<U+0080><U+009C>Let me tell you something, Bastard. Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.â<U+0080><U+009D>)Â

that thing about jaime is a great idea. i totally forgot about that. that made that scene so much better.

Â 
I am now on a mission to find a copy of Sansa's statement necklace she wore at the end. It looks so contemporary and striking; I could wear it and not feel like I'm wearing "Ren-Faire dress-up jewelry." I'm going to haunt Etsy. And I am not the only one; Lucky fashion magazine had a squeeing article on that necklace. I predict it's going to be a hot item for holiday gifts: Â http://www.luckymag....f-thrones-dress
3016	lil' ghost	2014-06-04	there were bits of the episode i'll have to get on track with, since it's not exactly the same as the books, but overall i loved this episode.
3017	Nicholi2789	2014-06-04	Â Oh gosh, that was an incredible episode. I had hoped the duel would be everything they built it up to be after three episodes of waiting for it. I've read the books several times, and many times throughout the HBO series I was disappointed with how they twisted the original story. This episode was not one of those times.Â 
Even though I knew what was going to happen to Oberyn, I still was just in utter shock at the end of the episode after seeing it played out on the screen. It was gutwrenching in a way that the duel in the books just didn't compare to (for me at least). I really liked Oberyn, he was a very charismatic character, and easy to like. Not to mention one of the only people in King's Landing with a sense of justice. It was cool to see him wield that spear like that and do rolls and flips across the Plaza, dance around the Mountain while antagonizing him, and getting tossed like a ragdoll.. The look on Ellaria Sand's face when Clegane punched him and his teeth go clattering across the ground, and the death wail screech she makes when he pops his head like a waterballoon. Just absolutely gut-wrenching. I was just speechless after that. Alas, Red Viper, I shall miss you. May you ride forever in the nightlands, err, or whereever Dornish princes go when they die.
Sansa, Sansa, Sansa, Sansa. Finally. You have embraced the Game. Finally she stepped out of her meek, mousy shell and got it done. Pretty soon Baelish will be wrapped around HER finger. Her character is really blossoming on the show.Â 
The scene between Jamie and Tyrion was great. Definetely the best scene of them together yet. I had to laugh a few times.Â 
Missandei naked.. Ooh man she's hot. Though in her defence, I would feel awkward with a Eunuch looking at me like that too. Meat and potatoes, or just potatoes? Our sweet Queen asks. LOL.Â 
Man this was a great Episode. Maybe almost great enough to rival Blackwater bay. Though I'm not sure anything can top that.

Â 
Grey Worm/Missandai scenes where great. Not filler scenes imho, justÂ great additons. LovedÂ Grey Worms "jamaican acccent" (sayingÂ I instead of me).Â I don't care if they're in the book or not. If they're going toÂ show those two kissing and perhaps cuddling or something, that'd be beautiful.

3023	King Tam Stark	2014-06-04	Loved Arya's laugh but I've noticed most people think she was laughing at another dead relative and although I agree am I the only one who thinks there was more to it and she was laughing at how p.h.ucked The Hound is?
3024	HelenaExMachina	2014-06-04	I thought she was laughing at the...i suppose irony? the irony of it all. Yoren plans to take her ti WF but is killed en route. After going with the Hound she arrives at the Twins in time for her brother and mother to be slain, ending any hope of ransom and rescue. Then she is dragged all the way to the Vale only to find her Aunt died three days earlier? Its a drwadfully similar story and shows her hutter hopelessness
3025	Gus Petch	2014-06-04	What I liked about this episode?
Â 
The fight between Prince Oberyn and Gregor.Â  The soap opera between Dany and Jorah in Meereen.Â  That touching moment between father and son between the Boltons.Â 
Â 
What I didn't like about the episode?
Â 
Bran was not on it.Â  Maisie Williams' obnoxious laugh.Â  Ygritte finding a heart all of a sudden.Â  Baelish appearing weak and unprepared.Â Â
3026	Alayne Stone	2014-06-04	Jamie's face when he mimed crushing the beetles. I giggle every time I think about it.
3027	ToTheWolves	2014-06-04	I'm sure someone mentioned it but littlefingers line "some people die hovering over their chamber pots"

3029	Slingingstones	2014-06-04	Loved Sansa werkin' it walking down those stairs all in black. Â Like Scarlett O'Hara @ Tara.
3030	Er Rn	2014-06-04	I loved Oberyn and Ellaria, what little time we had with them
3031	Zarinna	2014-06-04	Sophie Turner owned that episode. Her delivery to the Lords Declarant" was incredible.Â
3032	Seneti	2014-06-04	I thought she was laughing at the...i suppose irony? the irony of it all. Yoren plans to take her ti WF but is killed en route.

Â 
I think it was a mix of this...
Â 


Loved Arya's laugh but I've noticed most people think she was laughing at another dead relative and although I agree am I the only one who thinks there was more to it and she was laughing at how p.h.ucked The Hound is?


Â 
... and this. And it was perfect. I actually started chuckling when the guard told them that Lysa was dead, because of the irony. When Arya started laughing right after that, I started full-out laughing, too (I think my room mates have gotten used to my Sunday night emotional outbursts by now).
3033	RottenAppleFossoway	2014-06-04	I liked, very much, the casting of Bronze Yohn Royce and Lady Waynwood. Seemed perfect to me.
 I liked Royce in particular though. Very proud and haughty but with steel backing it instead of just bravado and arrogance. The entire scene came off realistically to me. I assume the third guy was Ser Lyn Corbray? 
 Well played Lady Sansa, well played. Sophie has been excellent this season. 
 Regarding the Arya scene: I read an interview with Maisie where she says it's the Hound that she's actually laughing at, not her penchant for near misses with family. She laughs because he's all "I'm gonna get paid and finally be rid of you, you little pain in the ass!" And Arya is all "neener neener!"
 I thought it was pretty funny, in an otherwise un-funny episode.
 Pedro was perfect and I'll miss him greatly. His and Indira's screams were just awful to hear.
3034	green_caitlin	2014-06-04	'Today is not the day that I die'. Apparently even the greatest ones make mistakes. 
Plus, surprisingly enough, the monologue on the beetles. I hope Dinklage appears in better films in the future, he absolutely deserves it. This man is able to make the most uninteresting lines sound riveting.
3035	teemo	2014-06-04	The scenery was so gorgeous when Roose told Ramsay he was legitimized. Â That was a beautifully filmed scene, I'll have to admit that. Â Is it just me, or is Iwan Rheon incredibly good-looking? :X Â He's way too sexy for Ramsay....it's not right. Â
3036	ormurin	2014-06-04	I think the most amazing part in this episode is seeing Baelish on trial for a mistake he made. It is a rare case of him being dependent on fate AND on others. Or maybe these turn of events shows Baelish's success winning over Sansa's heart? Either way, Sansa has changed her personality, she changed the game, and she Changed Baelish. Awesome.Â
3037	Corvinus	2014-06-04	Per the imdb, it is Bronze Yohn Royce (http://www.imdb.com/...ef_=tt_ov_st_sm)
Â 
I wouldn't be surprised if we never hear of Nestor, since it looks like the whole Lord's Declarant story line is being skipped.


Â 
hmm, I swear I had read somewhere that Nestor had been cast. If that's Yohn, it's one of the few poor choices of casting in the show.
3038	CatelynStrk	2014-06-04	I liked, very much, the casting of Bronze Yohn Royce and Lady Waynwood. Seemed perfect to me.
I liked Royce in particular though. Very proud and haughty but with steel backing it instead of just bravado and arrogance. The entire scene came off realistically to me. I assume the third guy was Ser Lyn Corbray?

Â 
Ellaria made me tear up, I'm not going to lie.Â  I've loved Indira Varma for many years and her face/scream said it all.. it just added that much more to the scene.Â  She didn't want him to "leave her alone in this world.."Â  Just sadness.

3044	Rysler	2014-06-05	Aight, I've complained enough, time for some praise.Â 
Â 
-The duel had it's faults, but Oberyn was really cool and his death was even more unsettling than I'd thought.Â 
-Sophie's acting, which was a very pleasant surprise.
-I really liked the Bolton scenes. The plot moves with no nonsense and both the acting and characterization works, especially Theon's breakdown and Roose's cold authority.Â 
-Jorah's acting during the banishment.
-Lannister boys' brotherly bond (though I don't appreciate the beetles).
3045	Peter George Stewart	2014-06-05	I liked, very much, the casting of Bronze Yohn Royce and Lady Waynwood. Seemed perfect to me.
I liked Royce in particular though. Very proud and haughty but with steel backing it instead of just bravado and arrogance. The entire scene came off realistically to me. I assume the third guy was Ser Lyn Corbray?


Â 
Yeah, I have to say Royce and Lady W were beautifully cast, those actors were great in the roles, pitch perfect.
3046	Grail King	2014-06-06	Basically everything:
Â 
I really liked the Sansa reveal, I truly felt that Sophie ruled this night and her facial expressions were deadly.
Indira Varma's screams ! as her lover died.
Arya's laugh
Hated seeing the Boltons heading to Winterfell.
Â 
Â 
Â Nathalie Emmanuel Â  Â  
Felt bad for Jorah and Gray Worm, and Sam
Loved Dolorus Edd, but feeling uneasy for Pyp and Grinn
Â 
Sansa's little Black DressÂ  Â  Â

3048	Theda Baratheon	2014-06-06	people die in their beds, at the dinner table, squatting over their chamber pots
Â 
very subtle petyrHahahahha - i proper laughed at this bit.
3049	NightStark	2014-06-06	I think the beetle scene  was actually good in retrospect. There's a line from King Lear that makes it a bit clearer;
'As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods. They kill us for their sport.'
3050	VermithorSunni	2014-06-07	people die in their beds, at the dinner table, squatting over their chamber pots
Â 
very subtle petyr


Â 
I thought that meant:
Robert Baratheon died in his bed.
Joffrey died at the dinner table.
Â 
Â 
Do you sometimes think D&D are writing to keep the book readers particularly entertained?
Â 
I loved Sansa and Arya.
We saw Sansa playing the game, lying (and telling the truth about her identity) to improve her personal situation, and then transforming herself into Alayne Stone, and older more sexually confident woman with dark hair, ready to travel the Vale with her uncle Petyr and Sweet Robin, the heir to House Arryn. Â Honestly, I think all the people over on the Sansa thread are wondering if she slept with LF only because she's now PLAYING an older woman. Â I am certain she's still a maid.
Â 
And didn't she look like Catelyn coming down the stairs??
Â 
Arya: Gotta love a girl who's basically walked from KL to the Twins to the Eyrie in the middle of a war and still has a sense of humor.
Â 
There was so much that concerned people's names. Â Ramsay Snow Bolton, Reek, Dany forbidding Jorah from saying her name, Sansa revealing her name (and choosing a Â new one), Arya revealing her name. Â You've got to know your name.

3051	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-09	I just read, that the German dubbing actor for Ramsay is really named Konrad BA¶sherz, which translates literally to Konrad Evil-Heart. Now isn't that a fitting choice?
3052	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-08-03	This actually might be my favorite episode overall. I loved theon, gilly, the fight, not so much the beetles, arya, and especially sansa. she was so fantastic. I'm really excited to see what they do with her next season.
3053	Bungholes First	2014-05-31	Oberyn Martell has become the favorite new character for the Unsullied just as he was mine when I first read aSOS. Every other watcher mentions how they harbor romantic feelings for him. This sunday I forecast that many people will run low on sheets of tissue paper.
I don't think any thing will ever match the visceral outpouring of emotion unleashed by the Red Wedding or the unbelievable shock of Ned Stark's execution. However it seems that the majority of the Unsullied I've listened to are quite sure that The Red Viper will win because they don't think the show will kill off a fan favorite so quickly after his introduction, and also because will will also lead to the death of Tyrion who is the most popular character of all. I think this moment will be up there among the greats when it comes to shock value.
So is anyone going to exploit their friends and family by secretly filming them to share their anguish for all and sundry?
Unfortunately I'm not going one of those people this Sunday, because I'm going to be away from town, and half of my Unsullied friends aren't yet caught up.
3054	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-01	No point, Oberyn didnt have enough screentime to attract mass unsullied to care enough.

3055	Arkash	2014-06-01	^ You'd be surprised by how many of them only swear by his name.
3056	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-01	I wont be surprised. It's not gonna achieve what the red wedding did lol.
3057	NewJeffCT	2014-06-01	Loved him in the book, but he was a pretty minor character there - only in a few scenes until the duel.
Â 
They've jacked up his presence on the show to make more people care about him and like him (easy to do - he's pretty cool and Pascal is doing well with the part)
Â 
However, I don't think it will make as big an impact as the Red or Purple Weddings just because he hasn't been around long enough.
3058	Mordos_Kull	2014-06-01	The whole recording reactions trend is old hat.
Â 
It didn't work with Joffrey.
Â 
It won't get as big as the Red Wedding.
3059	ebevan91	2014-06-01	Recording reactions will work for "For the Watch" next season.
3060	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-01	When Tywin dies in finale is more worthy than this episode.
3061	DarkerStar	2014-06-01	Recording reactions will work for "For the Watch" next season.


I expect lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth after that one. I think it has to happen in a season finale though for maximum effect.
3062	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-01	It didn't work with Joffrey.

It didn't work with Joffrey because that made people happy. It's not funny when people are happy.
But, with that said, I agree nothing will ever match the RW reactions, except maybe Daggers in the Dark next season.
3063	Azul DeLaRosa	2014-06-01	My sister is in love with him and thinks he will find Dany and take back the iron throne. She thinks he will kill the mountain and accuse Tywin and Cercei of Joffrey's murder because she thinks they killed him to get Tommen on the throne because he's easier to manipulate. I feel sad for her. She has this whole scenario of Tyrion racing to get Dany and coming back with Dragons to kill Littlefinger and save Sansa from molestation. And somehow she thinks Arya is going to join the Nights Watch and become Lord Commander while Rickon becomes King of the Wildlings. I have no idea how any of this makes sense, but i will be calling her in a few hours to listen to her cry about the love of her life getting his face crushed.
She thinks Bran will turn out to be a wizard and that Sam will kill his father somehow and give Gilly his Castle. I tell her to write fanfiction, because i want to read the one about Sam killing his father in single combat.
3064	Snowisnobastard	2014-06-01	Someone should do a reaction video for this one, I didn't think so at first but I just watched it, even already knowing what was going to happen from reading the novels, my jaw was on the floor. Holy brutality.
3065	BloodSausage	2014-06-01	I expect lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth after that one. I think it has to happen in a season finale though for maximum effect.

Will that really come as early as next year?
3066	Corvinus	2014-06-01	I'm sure the Ides of March will bring out some good reactions, whenever that comes.
3067	Banner Without Brothers	2014-06-01	I feel a little queasy after watching that. It was pretty gory. I kind of didn't expect it to be so quick either. It was just like GRAB.SQUEEZE.POP.Â 
Â 
That poping sound....
3068	Lady Arwen	2014-06-01	It was certainly gruesome and evoked a lot of horrified/incredulous responses in my household. The eye gouging alone...ick.

Even if you knew who was going to win, the pop was quite a surprise.
Â 
At one point I was thinking that the producers had changed the plot completely... After all Sansa just did the reveal of who she was unlike the books then Arya arrives at the Erie unlike the books. Maybe Tyrion is staying in KL...

Also, there's no way Tyrion's staying in King's Landing. Especially now that Jorah has been exiled.Â
3073	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-01	I think it would have been a good idea to have a camera on me for my reaction. when his head got squished i was like "FUUUCCCKKK"
3074	Azul DeLaRosa	2014-06-01	I just finished crying and gave myself an ice cream cone to make myself feel better. :candle:
3075	candyman82	2014-06-01	I wish I had recorded my roommate. He's not handling it well.
3076	Bratchild	2014-06-01	...I made the mistake of eating a slice of cheesecake for desert. After watching that fight,I an regretting that choice.
Â 
Ugh...I thought it was horrible in the book but seeing it on tv was way worse.
3077	StrollofShame	2014-06-01	The Unsullied hubby was frantic for Tyrion...can't imagine how he'll be "saved" now---damn, these season-ending eps force me to bite my tongue til it bleeds!! And this after congratulating me for making him watch the show all these years, just to see a fabulous Sansa-payoff finally!
3078	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-01	My family went apeshit
Â 
I think my dad was having PTSD or something because he just kept repeating, "But...he was winning, why did he die?" for 15 minutes straight
Â 
My mom was like, "tell me his fucking family is going to avenge him. Tell me!", and I was like, "yeah, yeah, sure!" and inside I was thinking "don'tÂ 
hold your breath"
3079	IlAovatar	2014-06-02	As a reader, the duel shocked me far more than Ned's death, the Red Wedding, or the Purple Wedding. And even watching the episode now knowing perfectly well what would happen, my jaw dropped a bit at how horrific it was. I can only imagine what some of the reactions will be like from viewers who didn't know the outcome.

Â 
Yes it was horrible...
3081	zJordan	2014-06-02	I actually thought that was one of the most.. horrible deaths I've ever seen, sure Robb Stark's death was horrible but I expected it to be, I didn't expect this to be worse than the books.
3082	The Ghost of Rhaegar	2014-06-02	i knew it was coming, i thought i was ready for itâ<U+0080>¦ i was wrong. Â it still got me. Â man that was baaad. Â i was shaken for about 15 minutes afterwards. Â even harder to watch the second time.
Â 
totally awesome though...
3083	Seneti	2014-06-02	Honestly dunno if its just cause im ill atm - but i actually feel quite sick.
Â 
Its something about the eyes that make me gagÂ 


Â 
I hear ya. I actually looked away as soon as Oberyn hit the ground but the sounds... oh gods... and then I looked again when I fought it was over only to get a nice aerial shot of head-squashed Oberyn... *ugh*
Â

I don't even want to think about watching this for a second time.Â   Â Don't get me wrong: it was a very good fight scene, but still...Â
3084	Unbowed Unbent Unhodor	2014-06-02	My unsullied brother was shocked. He just sat up from the couch and stared at the credits then went to his room without saying anything. And my mum yelled at the tv haha
3085	daggerseiuri	2014-06-02	My sister is in love with him and thinks he will find Dany and take back the iron throne. She thinks he will kill the mountain and accuse Tywin and Cercei of Joffrey's murder because she thinks they killed him to get Tommen on the throne because he's easier to manipulate. I feel sad for her. She has this whole scenario of Tyrion racing to get Dany and coming back with Dragons to kill Littlefinger and save Sansa from molestation. And somehow she thinks Arya is going to join the Nights Watch and become Lord Commander while Rickon becomes King of the Wildlings. I have no idea how any of this makes sense, but i will be calling her in a few hours to listen to her cry about the love of her life getting his face crushed.
She thinks Bran will turn out to be a wizard and that Sam will kill his father somehow and give Gilly his Castle. I tell her to write fanfiction, because i want to read the one about Sam killing his father in single combat.

Your sister must be adorable.
3086	Envie	2014-06-02	I don't know how many of you are also Walking Dead fans, but after 4 seasons of that, you'd THINK I would be really kinda desensitized to all the gory disgusting SOUNDS human heads make when they are gored, crushed, chopped, poked and stabbed. But no. NO. Nothing prepared me for that scene not even having read it and knowing it was coming. I can't imagine what all the unsullied Oberyn fans must have done. I would love to see some video reactions. I am sure it still wan't quite the dramatic freak out we saw with the Red Wedding but man, there's still some good reactions there even from us book fans! I'm still in shock. I think I'll go back to watching weeks of walker heads being smashed instead.
3087	Mark Antony	2014-06-02	My brother threatened to be done with the show.  he said if Jon and Tyrion die he is done. Now I just gotta wait for "for the watch"
3088	Inv1ctus	2014-06-02	My sister is in love with him and thinks he will find Dany and take back the iron throne.

Â 
Haha that's actually pretty awesome. She has some very interesting ideas, too bad some dreams must be shattered.
3089	Dreams Of Spring	2014-06-02	To be honest, I was not happy when Oberyn met his fate in the books, however I was even more disgusted with it on the show, it was too gruesome to say the least. The fight scene was amazing, until the Mountain snatched Oberyn up, I certainly will never watch that scene again. On another note, my unsullied husband was quite irritated with Oberyn dying, he wanted justice for Oberyn (I did too) and then he said he wanted to know what the hell was to happen with Tyrion because he was getting sick of it. I don't really blame him, all the killing off of the best characters gets rather annoying, I told him to just wait until the last episode and we will both see if they (HBO) can make it worth it. I guess we will see...
3090	A rose by any other name	2014-06-02	I was also one of those people who knew what was coming and thought I was ready...I was not ready at all. I wish someone had recorded me. I screamed and covered my eyes. I didn't even hear Ellaria scream...all I heard was the squishing and poping noise (which caused me to squeak and scream more). This was way worse that the Red or Purple wedding for me. I'm usually fine with gore, but this one really got me.
Â 
They really should not run episodes like this one on sunday nights. It makes my monday even worse.
3091	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-06-02	Didn't record, but I've had two weeks of my Unsullied friends constantly asking me, "Does Oberyn kill the Mountain? Â He's gotta kill the Mountain, right? Â He can't die cause then Tyrion is screwed!" So, Oberyn wins, right?" Â On, and on, it went, up until the episode finally started and we had silence in the realm that is my buddy's living room. Â Watching that scene, and hearing them root for Oberyn each time he dodged a slash, and landed a hit on the Mountain with that fancy spear, the "yes'!', and 'nice's! they would utter couldn't help but bring a smirk to my face, knowing the Viper wasn't long for Westeros. Â And when the Mountain finally, and gruesomely, ended that duel, I asked them all if that answered their question as to who wins.
Â 
Seriously, you don't bet against the 7'11'' guy clad in full plate that uses a two handed greatsword one handed.
Â 
Now a week of "But what's going to happen to Tyrion!?" followed by replies of, "Well, put down Facebook and pick up a real book." Â 
Â 
Not that I'm not used to that question by now.
Â 
Wanted to also say, like most book readers, I've been anticipating AND dreading this scene since the title of this episode was released. Â There really is nothing you can do to prepare yourself to watch someone be killed in the most brutal way possible. Â Ellaria Sand/Indira Varma's blood curdling scream says it all. Â 
Â 
Once you see it, you can't un-see it!

3092	Bridgeburners	2014-06-02	For those saying that the audience probably wouldn't be as "shocked" with the scene as with the RW....
Â 
I don't know, but I must say that when I read aSoS 9 years ago, I was far more thrown back in a "holy shit" moment with the Mountain and Viper fight than with the Red Wedding. And it's not that I was more invested or anything; I wasn't all that invested in Oberyn at all, and Gregor hardly had any scenes anyway. It's just that, stand-alone, the way that entire scene was written was absolutely brilliant and magnificent. In just a couple of pages, I went from not knowing Oberyn that well to being completely invested in his cause, even forgetting about Tyrion for a bit (well, until Tyrion reminds us of his presence when Oberyn says "confess your crime, confess your crime", and Tyrion was whispering another chant, "fall down and die, fall down and die", lol).
Â 
The thing is, that could have just been a short story on its own, and it still would have been brilliant. In a quick stroke, he takes us from wondering about the fight, to being completely invested in Oberyn and his cause and enjoying the results, to being stupefied and horrified. Compare that with the Red Wedding, where we simply go from reading a boring scene we don't care about all that much to being stupefied and horrified. Maybe with the baggage that came before, the Red Wedding gets more impact, but as a stand-alone scene, the Viper vs Mountain fight was more powerful and more shocking by far, IMO.
3093	flrtwtrble	2014-06-02	I got a text from a friend that he was having the worst night ever -- first the Blackhawks lost, then Â Oberyn's dead and WTF Tyrion lost his trial.Â 
Â 
And that was just gruesome the way they killed Oberyn. I could barely watch it.Â
3094	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-06-02	It was pretty horrifying. I didn't think to record my hubby, but I should have - his reaction was very similar to that of the Red Wedding, except he got over it sooner. It was shocking even knowing what was going to happen and Ellaria's scream - Oh my goodness!
3095	Boltons on the Iron Throne	2014-06-02	This is the best response ever to this episode, taken from the misc forums.

Â 
I'm fuking fuming right now. I hate this show so badly. It's brought no joy in my life all it's brought is agony. Wat a bullshyt ending. Back in season 1 I backed my boy Ned Stark and that neckbeard decides to kill him off. It stung but I got over it and I started backing his son Robb. He was younger, hotter than his dad and had a direwolf on his side so I figured it was a trade-up. Then that POS GRRM kills him and his whole family off in the most brutal way possible at a fuking wedding and then to add salt on a womb we see that sick shot of his body on his direwolfs head. Wat kind of fuked up human being thinks up stuff like that. I was devastated after last season. The Starks who represent everything that is good in this world were in shambles. Bran is going to like antarctica. Sansa is having a borderline pedo relationship in the moon door castle and Arya has been walking around for like 3 seasons doing jackshyt. I used to like Daenerys because she has banging titties and dragons but nope she's too busy playing judge judy in a pyramid rather than fuking shyt up in king's landing. Instead of showing us any of that we get painful friendzone scenes with Jorah every episode that reminds me of my high school days. Who the fuk am I supposed to root for in this show? Ok you bring in Prince Obrien this season and I was balls deep into him the minute they introduced him. He kinda looks like me and was an alpha fighter and lover and had some cheeky lines. I was rooting for him hard to become the king but nope that neckbeard writes him the most gruesome sickening death ever. Why couldn't he have just died in 5 seconds atleast the pain wouldn't have been so bad nope you gotta have him die that way. WTF is wrong with this show. Just when I think I was gonna make it this show takes everything I love and face fuks it to death. Great maybe we'll get more scenes with that phaggot mountain character who has an IQ comparable to shweezy (my sports misc boys know wat i'm talking about). Meanwhile the POS Lannister and Tyrell family gets away unscathed again. So many lucky bounces going Tywin and Cersei's way I hate them so fuking badly. My golden son Jamie in captured by Robb Stark? Oh look his beta mom sets him free. About to get fuked in the blackwater by Stannis? Nope Tywin puts in a last minute cheat code and in come the Tyrell's with unlimited ships and money to help save the day. How do I get rid of Robb Stark in season 3? I'll just scheme some hail mary play with Roose and Waldy to kill off all the Starks at a wedding without losing a single person on my side. My grandson Joffrey gets poisoned. No big deal we'll have his younger, more aesthetic, kinder, smarter brother become King and not a single fuk was given. Oh about to have the mountain killed and my shady as fuk past revealed in King's Landing? Naw at the last minute Prince Obrien is slaughtered and I just moonwalk away again without a scratch. I hate this show and I'm done with it. And from the preview next week it looks like my boy Jon Snow is gonna get fuked up by the wildling army next week. dfw the most likeable character left on the show is Stannis Baratheon who has a swag rating of 14/100. I swear by season 7 this show will basically be the Lannisters/Boltons/Freys holding gay orgies in King's Landing while Stannis and Davos conjure up a plan every episode to fuk them up but at the last minute it gets fuked up like the Pinky and Brain. Fuk that neckbeard GRRM. Fuk this show. Fuk the misc and all of you.

It strikes me as something that will take place at the end of a season, and I can't see them waiting until the end of the 6th out of what is planned to be 7 seasons.

3103	mynameisniamh	2014-06-02	Oh, right, thanks for replying! I just thought considering everything that happens on the Wall, in Kings Landing, at Winterfell, on The Iron Island, in Dorne annnnd in Meereen it just seems like a lot to put into next season unless they take most of Winds of Winter into season 6 apart from For The Watch. 
I don't know, maybe that's just me wanting to delay that scene for as long as possible!
3104	dbunting	2014-06-02	I have a friend who will be watching today, have his reaction tomorrow, but he is sure that Oberyn will win, because it means Tyrion lives."for the watch" will likely be the cliff hanger next season. Books 6 and 7 will likely be seasons 6 and 7, so at the end of next season the show will be even with or past the books.
3105	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-02	I'm thinking Jon boy will become a fast favourite with the next two episodes and next season so "for the Watch" should bring excellent reactions. Another family member of House Stark and 'The Good Guy' being repeatedly stabbed...yep, that will be classic.
Â 
Since there is not aÂ 'Unsullied friends thoughts and predictions' thread then I will just use this one.
Â 
My friend is getting annoyed with all the characters being killed...wonders how Westeros is even populated.
Â 
Can't be bothered with the Reek stuff.
3106	SansaSeastar	2014-06-02	My sister is in love with him and thinks he will find Dany and take back the iron throne.

I feel sad for her. She has this whole scenario of Tyrion racing to get Dany and coming back with Dragons to kill Littlefinger and save Sansa from molestation. And somehow she thinks Arya is going to join the Nights Watch and become Lord Commander while Rickon becomes King of the Wildlings. I have no idea how any of this makes sense, but i will be calling her in a few hours to listen to her cry about the love of her life getting his face crushed.
She thinks Bran will turn out to be a wizard and that Sam will kill his father somehow and give Gilly his Castle. I tell her to write fanfiction, because i want to read the one about Sam killing his father in single combat.



Poor thing LOL, offer her my condolences XD
3107	Angmar	2014-06-02	Blegh, probably the most gruesome thing the show's ever done.
Â 
My jaw dropped and i felt a bit numb afterwards, kinda like Tyrion's reaction. And I couldn't feel my arms for a good 15 minutes.Â  
Â 
And tonight i'm watching it again with my mother...Ugh.

Â 
Yeah this is way more problematic for the viewers, since tv seasons are condensed much closer together then books. So to them it might seem that the whole unpredictability is becoming predictable in itself. I know many people said that Oberyn will probably die, because he's a great character whom everyone loves and they were correct.Â
3117	King Zee	2014-06-02	I think this may actually have hit them harder since they did a better job making Oberyn a fan fav than with Robb.
3118	Isy	2014-06-02	Watched with the hubby. Both book readers... and we were still shocked. Those FX were incredibly - felt pretty darn nauseas after watching. Was gruesome!!

Glad to hear I'm not the only one!

I got a text from a friend in three parts which was just "Oh." "My." "God." and I just paced around my house for 15 good minutes before I could do anything else. Now to watch it with company again tonight!

3124	Blazfemur	2014-06-02	Not for nothing, the biggest reaction video this season, even more profound than Tywin dying, will be the debut of The Lady. THOSE are reaction videos id like to see
3125	Stormlandian	2014-06-02	My boyfriend freaked the fuck out. Â lol. Â He was CONVINCED Oberyn would win. Â I now wish that I had recorded his reaction.
3126	Tetro	2014-06-03	I really would have wanted to record my own reaction, when the Mountain was down on the ground and I knew it was coming up I just covered my mouth and started shaking. And I can't help it, when it comes to the eyes, It's just horrifying. It was hands-down the strongest emotion I felt for watching the show so far.
3127	petertel123	2014-06-03	I haven't watched it yet but I think I will just skip the death scene, I hate gore
besides I loved oberyn so much I probably cant stand to hear him scream like a girl
3128	SlowLoras	2014-06-03	I wish I'd recorded Mr Slowloras's reaction - "What?! No way!! Holy fucking shit!!!" repeated constantly over a period of ten minutes, complete with wide eyes and slack jaw. He really thought Oberyn had won. Priceless.
3129	Rhaquentis	2014-06-03	This is the best response ever to this episode, taken from the misc forums.


 Â  Â
3130	Crixus	2014-06-03	I read these books years ago before there was any whisper of a show and I spoilt my husband all the way through, well, nearly. I couldn't contain my shock or horror or grief at all the classic WTF moments so I'd tell him the story. FF years later and by the time the show rolled around he knew about Ned, he knew about the RW and the PW... thankfully I'd stopped random sharing around the time I read the PW.Â 
Â 
The result? Last night was the first time he wasn't spoiled and his REACTION!! It.Was.Epic. He was speechless and stunned and pissed and sad... it was beautiful. He had been utterly convinced Oberyn would win. He kept saying, 'but he won!'. Lol.Â 
Â 
No more spoiling! I am now eagerly anticipating his reaction when Tywin fails at shitting gold.Â
3131	Rysler	2014-06-03	My friend sent me three texts - and forgive my language
Â 
1) WHAT THE FUCK
2) OBERYN
3) HOLY FUCKING SHIT NO
Â 
And a bunch of crying emoticons, broken hearts and a ;_____;
3132	ambi76	2014-06-03	My book reaction was: Eeewwww. (And I didn't even like Oberyn in the books) 
My show reaction is: Ew ew ew eeeeeeewwwww ... EWWWW!!!! 
Â 
Though considering how squeamish I usually am when it comes to gore, I'm taking it rather well actually.
Â 
EW.

3133	dbunting	2014-06-03	Ok, my friend watched a day later and I got his response just now.Basically it was, "what the Fu**" that was gruesome, what the hell was he doing! I would have kept stabbing him, why did he get close to him?! All my favorite characters are dead, HE (GRRM) is a dick!
3134	majgat	2014-06-03	Loved him in the book, but he was a pretty minor character there - only in a few scenes until the duel.
Â 
They've jacked up his presence on the show to make more people care about him and like him (easy to do - he's pretty cool and Pascal is doing well with the part)
Â 
However, I don't think it will make as big an impact as the Red or Purple Weddings just because he hasn't been around long enough.


I don't think he's a minor character at all. On the contrary, his death sparked a lot of uproar in Dorne, so in this case, he's very similar to Ned Stark in the North. He's just never been POV character and appeared later in the books.
His contribution to other POV or minor character is quite big.
3135	messem	2014-06-03	I don't think he's a minor character at all. On the contrary, his death sparked a lot of uproar in Dorne, so in this case, he's very similar to Ned Stark in the North. He's just never been POV character and appeared later in the books.

He is petty minor character during first read. He has a similar importance as Garlan Tyrell. His importance increases exponentially after his death. One might love him during a reread but I always smile when I read that people loved him right from the beginning.
3136	Dragon Queen	2014-06-03	My brother texted me-
Bro: Wow GoT
Bro: That was brutal.
Me: I know that was awful
Bro: My friend heard a rumor that all of next episode is at the Wall
Me: The episode name is "The Watchers At the Wall," I think it may just have something to do with the Wall lol
Bro: I hope Jon Snow doesn't die now too
Â 
My Unsullied husband was distraught and in shock for about 20 minutes afterword, just sat there unable to move. He seemed to believe that despite it all, Tyrion would make it through this trial unscathed, position in court intact, and things could go on with Tyrion being in King's Landing with the rest. He's forced me to tell him his fate but he's not happy with Tyrion joining someone else's cause, he said, "I want Tyrion to be the hero on his own, not stand next to somebody else."
Â 
It's kind of fascinating how different fans lose their ASoIaF innocence at different points. For some people, seeing Ned die was enough. For others, they went from Ned to Robb and after the RW, they knew no one was safe. For others, I think it's taken until now to really let it sink in that no one is safe. For me personally, I wrote Ned off and thought he was an idiot after throwing a hissy fit in court about Robert wanting Dany assassinated. After every further bad decision, I was more and more pissed at him until he died. With Robb, there was a sense of foreboding as everything seemed to be going wrong for him too. So at the time of the trial, I didn't really get who Oberyn was, but I believed wholeheartedly that Tyrion was safe and that he couldn't lose. It was a major shock I didn't know how to deal with that Oberyn lost the fight for Tyrion. I lost my ASoIaF innocence at that point.
Â 
Thanks for the poster who posted that really funny rant from misc. I tried to cheer my husband up, so I showed him the rant. After reading it, my Unsullied husband smiled again, saved the post, and seemed to recover.
3137	AnCatDubh	2014-06-03	I honestly wanted to throw up. And I looked away as soon as I saw the fingers in the eyes and so did my boyfriend. Well I actually covered the screen with my hands so he had no choice lol.
waaay worse than the red wedding to me, gore-wise.
Â 
I hope they don't have quentyn and the same death for him as in the books... I wanted to throw up just reading the description of his face and it's worse when you actually see it.

I'm fuking fuming right now. I hate this show so badly. It's brought no joy in my life all it's brought is agony. Wat a bullshyt ending. Back in season 1 I backed my boy Ned Stark and that neckbeard decides to kill him off. It stung but I got over it and I started backing his son Robb. He was younger, hotter than his dad and had a direwolf on his side so I figured it was a trade-up. Then that POS GRRM kills him and his whole family off in the most brutal way possible at a fuking wedding and then to add salt on a womb we see that sick shot of his body on his direwolfs head. Wat kind of fuked up human being thinks up stuff like that. I was devastated after last season. The Starks who represent everything that is good in this world were in shambles. Bran is going to like antarctica. Sansa is having a borderline pedo relationship in the moon door castle and Arya has been walking around for like 3 seasons doing jackshyt. I used to like Daenerys because she has banging titties and dragons but nope she's too busy playing judge judy in a pyramid rather than fuking shyt up in king's landing. Instead of showing us any of that we get painful friendzone scenes with Jorah every episode that reminds me of my high school days. Who the fuk am I supposed to root for in this show? Ok you bring in Prince Obrien this season and I was balls deep into him the minute they introduced him. He kinda looks like me and was an alpha fighter and lover and had some cheeky lines. I was rooting for him hard to become the king but nope that neckbeard writes him the most gruesome sickening death ever. Why couldn't he have just died in 5 seconds atleast the pain wouldn't have been so bad nope you gotta have him die that way. WTF is wrong with this show. Just when I think I was gonna make it this show takes everything I love and face fuks it to death. Great maybe we'll get more scenes with that phaggot mountain character who has an IQ comparable to shweezy (my sports misc boys know wat i'm talking about). Meanwhile the POS Lannister and Tyrell family gets away unscathed again. So many lucky bounces going Tywin and Cersei's way I hate them so fuking badly. My golden son Jamie in captured by Robb Stark? Oh look his beta mom sets him free. About to get fuked in the blackwater by Stannis? Nope Tywin puts in a last minute cheat code and in come the Tyrell's with unlimited ships and money to help save the day. How do I get rid of Robb Stark in season 3? I'll just scheme some hail mary play with Roose and Waldy to kill off all the Starks at a wedding without losing a single person on my side. My grandson Joffrey gets poisoned. No big deal we'll have his younger, more aesthetic, kinder, smarter brother become King and not a single fuk was given. Oh about to have the mountain killed and my shady as fuk past revealed in King's Landing? Naw at the last minute Prince Obrien is slaughtered and I just moonwalk away again without a scratch. I hate this show and I'm done with it. And from the preview next week it looks like my boy Jon Snow is gonna get fuked up by the wildling army next week. dfw the most likeable character left on the show is Stannis Baratheon who has a swag rating of 14/100. I swear by season 7 this show will basically be the Lannisters/Boltons/Freys holding gay orgies in King's Landing while Stannis and Davos conjure up a plan every episode to fuk them up but at the last minute it gets fuked up like the Pinky and Brain. Fuk that neckbeard GRRM. Fuk this show. Fuk the misc and all of you.

3139	snowy	2014-06-03	I love watching the reactions from Burlington Bar in the Chicago area. The bartender records and posts. Go to YouTube and search for the bar's name and Game Of Thrones together in search.
3140	tito5601	2014-06-03	my friend is still super pissedd but is convinced tyrion will escape
3141	snowy	2014-06-03	my friend is still super pissedd but is convinced tyrion will escape Husband thinks he will escape somehow, and that Jamie will be a participant.   Oh, my unsullied husband was quite bummed after the episode. He usually discusses and debates for an hour afterwards, but this time he stood up, left the room, and immediately started playing one of his network games. He did not discuss any thoughts or ideas until last night.
3142	Pure Guava	2014-06-03	Just shared that rant post with a co-worker who's also aÂ ASoIaF fan and she cracked the heck up. I think "salt on a womb" and "Obrien" are my favorite parts.

Â 
That was amazing. My favourite part was the bearded dude in the white T-shirt shaking his head in mute horror at 2:48, with a close second being another bearded dude surreptitiously high-fiving someone else after Oberyn dies (book reader, maybe?). Awesome!
Â 
I wish we'd had a similar large gathering reaction vid for the Red Wedding.

Â 
I wish I had a bar nearby that had GOT get-togethers. I'd go, too!
3153	Left Wondering Whether	2014-06-03	I just got the chance to re-watch with my Unsullied husband (his first viewing) and he lost it beyond what I was expecting. He literally got up, cursed out GRRM and refused to watch next week until I swore that his favorite 3 or 4 characters would survive the season. I was expecting surprise and dismay, but he was completely outraged. I was actually kind of proud to be there to witness this ASOIAF right of passage.Â
3154	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-03	Ugh, I just can't participate in the schadenfreude on this one. The RW reactions I could find funny because I really hated Robb on the show. But I love Oberyn so much, and his death was so gruesome, I just can't find the funny this time.
3155	Mel_Rose	2014-06-04	I don't know how many of you are also Walking Dead fans, but after 4 seasons of that, you'd THINK I would be really kinda desensitized to all the gory disgusting SOUNDS human heads make when they are gored, crushed, chopped, poked and stabbed. But no. NO. Nothing prepared me for that scene not even having read it and knowing it was coming. I can't imagine what all the unsullied Oberyn fans must have done. I would love to see some video reactions. I am sure it still wan't quite the dramatic freak out we saw with the Red Wedding but man, there's still some good reactions there even from us book fans! I'm still in shock. I think I'll go back to watching weeks of walker heads being smashed instead. 


Â 
That's what I told a friend afterwards: I have watched all of TWD but this was the most horrific, nauseating, disgusting thing I have seen.
Â 
It says something when even us Sullied are reacting like this. I was in quite a state after the end of the ep.
3156	lyanna_maria	2014-06-04	My flatmate says she was one of the fans that were sure that Oberyn would die because he was so likeable and everybody loved him. She herself was kind of indifferent to the character, I think, but still she absolutely freaked out: she started screaming and, in fact, she covered her face most of the time and so we had to rewatch it! Then for a whole day she was traumatised and would whisper "Oberyn..." everytime she heard the words "head", "eyes" or anything similarÂ  
Â 
I have another friend who was ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with Oberyn: I think it was her favourite character in the show so far, and she certainly wasn't expecting this. She told me she actually cried when she saw it and that she's finding hard to move onÂ  Â  
Â 
I don't blame any of them: I knew what was coming and still I was completely horrified at the scene and in the verge of tears.
Â 
PS: I'm becoming quite addict to this reaction videos. My flatmate won't allow me to tape her, but I hope to see lots of reation videos to Lady Stoneheart

3157	Angmar	2014-06-04	Eh, I don't find reaction videos that funny. they're getting old already. sure Â the red wedding video was a novel, but seriously is this trend going to last throughout all the show? Was there a reaction video when Lysa dropped? Like will people care enough to react once Tyrion offs Shae?

3158	dbunting	2014-06-04	To me the reaction videos are great and if I was GRRM I would watch them all and use them as inspiration to get the next book out. The passion and general emotion his writing has envoked is amazing and he should be smiling from ear to ear.
3159	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-04	Â 
that post made me laugh soooo hard....especially " by season 7 this show will basically be the Lannisters/Boltons/Freys holding gay orgies in King's LandingÂ "Â 
Â 
 Â  Â  


Â 
That is fucking hysterical, along with the Stannis swag rating!!Â

Â 
The sound effects for this episode were some of the best I've ever heard, period. Â The wildlings in the brothel when Gilly is below and Oberyn's screams and the skull for sure!
3161	Ghost wind	2014-06-04	I for one couldn't look since the moment he gets the fingers in the eyeballs... UGH! I was shocked for like 2 minutes and then cheered because it was awesome!Â 
Â 
Then I've got a friend who had read the books until SoS and she liked it so much that recorded the last two minutes and says that the best part was the head-exploding... Sick bastard!
Â 
We were talking about it and an unsullied friend heard us say that someone was going to die. His first reaction was: please tell me is not any of the Starks! Oh god it can't be Sansa. And then: I hope it is Stannis! I mean that was kind of my same reaction when I was reading the books... Please don't kill more Starks, please don't!Â
3162	Aethermancer	2014-06-04	Â Like will people care enough to react once Tyrion offs Shae?


Â 
I've been reading the totally Unsullied forums and their speculation.Â Â  You have NO IDEA how much that scene is going to cause THEIR heads to explode.Â  Almost every single speculation from the Unsullied seems to include a statement such as "I really hope that Tywin doesn't kill Shae in front of Tyrion."
Â 
Let that sink in a bit, a common concern for them is that Tyrion will have to watch Tywin kill Shae.Â  I've invited my Brother-in-Law over for a GoT dinner for the explicit purpose that I want to watch him watch that scene.

Just out of curiosity: Who are your husband's favourites? Better not be Tywin, Shae and Jon...Â

Baahahahaha! From the ptv unsullied forums. The reactions there are golden
3169	Newstar	2014-06-05	It's been pointed out that what the Burlington bar is doing--hosting public viewings of a pay cable TV show (as opposed to private viewing parties at someone's house)--is not actually above board. I wouldn't be surprised if HBO brings the hammer down. AMC has done that in the past with unauthorized public showings of Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead.
3170	Noelle Snow	2014-06-05	ButÂ  if they're paying for the subscription, why can they not show the channel on their TV?
3171	Ralph	2014-06-05	Paying the subscription allows you to watch it in a private environment with your friends. Public viewing requires a commercial license. Same as sports bars.
3172	Shadow Tower	2014-06-05	I went away inside when the scene began... I begin to understand little Tommen better now...
Â 
Do we know for sure that LS will be on the show? If yes, this should bring us some interesting reactions.
3173	Inv1ctus	2014-06-05	If we can judge by Lena's twitter pictures from the past I say yes. Because she obviously does hint some things occasionally. Before I was pretty sure LS wouldn't be in the show. But now I think it's more likely than not, that she will be. I hope she appears cause I will love to hate that character.
3174	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-05	Brienne was pointed toward the BWB in her last episode. That wouldn't have happened if LS weren't in the show. Also, seeing as meeting her is looking to be the climax of Jaime & Brienne's story, there's literally no way to do the story without her.
3175	Shadow Tower	2014-06-06	After so many changes in this season I wasn't sure anymore... but Lena's pic would be quite cruel if it wasn't meant as a spoiler...
3176	Peter George Stewart	2014-06-06	So sick of these. "Haha! Look at your face when GRRM rips yet another character away from you!" Enough, already.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Oh I dunno, sure it's just schadenfreude for some, but for many, it's just fascinating.Â  We don't often get a chance to observe strong, engaged human reactions in that way in a non-harmful context, and the show does bring them out.
Â 
And also, in a way, it's a kind of bonding or initiation ceremony.Â  We've all been through the hurt ourselves, and the shows make us like brothers and sisters in a bizarre kind of Night's Watch situation
3177	Kara99	2014-06-12	My husband was still for a few minutes then he said " that's it, I'm done with this show". Â I had to give him quite a few spoilers to convince him to keep watching!
3178	JDNight	2014-06-20	Not for nothing, the biggest reaction video this season, even more profound than Tywin dying, will be the debut of The Lady. THOSE are reaction videos id like to see


Â 
I agree.Â  That will be something that could not be predicted by ANY unsullied.

Spoiler alert!

I have mostly stage experience. So I've never done anything as challenging as this. We filmed in Croatia at the Hotel Dubrovnik, which is basically abandonedâ<U+0080><U+0094>it was destroyed during the war. There was this amphitheater right over the water that the crew set beautifully. It was the most insane production team I'll probably ever work with. It was thrilling and scary, grueling and beautiful, and delicious, and fun. David and Dan, in their adaptation, still refuse to completely betray the books, but they keep surprises hidden.

Uhmm, no. That was and still is Elia and her children's deaths.
3230	Jinjonator	2014-05-13	Uhmm, no. That was and still is Elia and her children's deaths.


My memory is ever fuzzy, but Dorne had stayed out of the war completely, and it was Oberyn's death that made the Sand Snakes want to incite war, no? I know Doran had some different stuff planned before against Tywin and them, but surface-level, everything had been calm on the Dornish front before Oberyn died.
3231	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	Elia's death brought Dorne to boiling point. Doran kept it simmering whilst trying to focus a realistic plan, which Oberyn may have been executing and succeeding at, then his death makes it start to boil over.

Â 
They'll probably do it in episodes 7 or 8, just to keep it more fresh in the Unsullied's mind. As for Ser Gregor- we don't need to hear it, the same way we've never heard Sandor Clegane.
3234	TheEvilKing	2014-05-13	Is still dont understand why they havent referred to him as the Red Viper yet


Â 
Yeah it makes no sense. They could have thrown in a "they call him the Red Viper of Dorne" when Tyrion is waiting for him to arrive.
Â 
ETA: They have referred to The Mountain as "Gregor Clegane" more than once, from memory.

I can seriously not see Oberyn doing anything that Quentin did, it would just kill Oberyn's charcter in a much more gruesome way than even the Mountain ever could.

Maybe he tells the story to Tyrion next ep before the offer? Or they have a scene before the trial?
Â 
In weeks ahead promo Oberyn says 'All those who have wronged me...are right here" - so I think he does speak to someone right before the fight
3240	LEX_12345	2014-05-13	Oberyn must die so that Sand snakes rage can be exploited. They must show Qyburn starting work on ser Robert Strong.Â
3241	Northern_Star	2014-05-13	Nice how everyone gets carried away about how the death of Oberyn got Dorne involved.Yes the dorn is boiling after the news reach them but do we see war happening ? No! So its kinda pointless for the show unless the skip Aegon. Oberyn has made it pretty clear in the show how much they hate the Lannisters. Lets face it they are not going to introduce 10 new characters in the next season. They don't want to confuse the unsullied. Doran Martell, Arianne and maybe only just maybe they introduce Darkstar, Quentyn is not gonna happen.
Â 
They could have the viper kill the mountain and him being badly injured. It would be good for the audience to see that not even the red viper a fearsome warrior is not able to mount a dragon.
Â 
Â 
Might not happen - but it could.
3242	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	If Oberyn lives, Tyrion wouldn't have much reason to murder his father and Shae, would he? Why jeopardise his newly acquired freedom?
Â 
As others pointed out, it would be completely OOC for Oberyn's character to act in any way like Quentin did.Â
3243	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	Is still dont understand why they havent referred to him as the Red Viper yet, as opposed to the mountain which they also havent referred to as Ser Gregor.


Â 
Me neither. Red Viper is much catchier than Oberyn and easier for the audience to remember. It would make sense if the characters would address him as "Prince Oberyn" but talk about him as the "Red Viper of Dorne".
Â 
EDIT: P.S. Come to think of it, has Olenna ever been called the Queen of Thorns on the show?

Are you kidding me?? Quentyn Martell will definitley make it into the show. Who else would try to steal her dragons and then get burned alive in the process?
3249	AzorAhai42	2014-05-13	As others have stated, this won't work because it would mean that Tyrion is innocent. It would ruin his necessity to flee, and that's a plothole that I don't see being easily remedied. Other than that, Oberyn and Quentin really don't seem anything alike one another to me. One is brave and bold and extremely confident. The other is not, to say the least (and Quentin's moment of hesitation is what gets him killed).Â 
Â 
I'm sorry to say, that even if this could work, I would not want them to change the story like this. It would be a character assassination to either character to try to combine the two.Â

Â 
He'll likely be included because it sets up Dorne's motivations moving forward, but I don't think he's an absolute necessity. We also haven't gotten very many prophecies in the show, and that particular one is about Khal Drogo being normal again. It's basically MMD's way of saying "never."

Â 
You think Drogo is going to come back? I agree that Quentyn could be viewed as a Sun that rises in the west and sets in the east, but the end part of what she says ("then he will return") kind of indicates that it's not a prophecy so much as MMD's way of saying "he's gone."
Â 
Â 
Â 
"When will he be as he was?" Dany demanded.
Â 
"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east," said Mirri Maz Duur. "When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."
3257	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	I thought Dany's Dothraki past and Drogo represented Drogo and both did come back when those things happened (well, one actually beforehand and one at teh very end of the book)

I don't know, but the sun rose in the west and set in the east (if you accept Quentin as that sun/son of Sunspear), the seas went dry (if you take the drought of the Dothraki sea as the 'seas going dry'), and if you remember correctly Dany, arguably, has a miscarriage near the end of her arc in DwD. So, most of it has come true. Maybe Drogo is coming back, or maybe the prophecy doesn't really mean Drogo is coming back, but that Dany will have a strong husband again? I don't know, but I do know that the evidence is compelling for the prophecy being fulfilled.Â

I think when everyone was on the small council meeting this past episode talking about Danny taking over Mereen with her dragons, that that's when Oberyn had that look like, "hey, I should totally tell my brother about this and see if we can get the upperhand by sending over Quentyn to ask her hand in marriage"

Â 
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like I said, I expect him to be in, but I won't be shocked if they go a different direction. I'm wondering if we're going to get any of Arianne's backstory (thinking she was going to be disinherited) and if they'll bring up the original marriage contract, but that seems like a lot to explain. Will be interesting to see how the Dornish are handled, moving forward.

Completely agree, Dorne for some reason really peaks my interest. So I hope to see great things from there, also I'm curious when they will show Marcella and if they will still cut her ear off. It seems like they foreshadowed it when Oberyn made that comment that little girls don't get hurt in Dorne.
3264	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	Original marriage contract will be in it. Doran's speech is gold and before it ends on "Fire and Blood", the line about how Arianne's betrothed was killed will be a great "did he just say... Does he mean..?" Line for show watchers. 
I really hope Oberyn's past in the second sons is mentioned, followed by a cut to Daario, just to fuel speculation and build the Martells are pro Targ flames. Then Doran can look to quash them in season 5 and disappoint the viewers and turn it around again with that speech...

Yeah this is true, Doran was planning to destroy the Lannisters with Viserys marrying Arianne and afterwards Quentyn marrying Danaerys, this was long before Oberyn died.

No that's correct. Doran had the marriage contracts, but Oberyn's death was the catalyst for all the sudden treasonous talks (Sand Snakes asking for war, Arianne wanting to crown Myrcella). They didn't know about Doran's longplay.
I mean after RR there was definitely contempt on Dorne, but not outright warmongering.

Â It wouldnt take long, they wouldnt introduce all of the sand snakes because it would be too much. They would only expand on Â Ellaria who has already been introduced. Â and a dialogue of like 4 minutes at the end of this season to introduce Doran and his relation to Oberyn along with Quentyn and Arianne. They already mentioned him the first episode by saying that he is too old to travel to kings landing for the wedding.Â 
Â 
I hope they emphasize the part where Oberyn screams out what the mountain did to his sister as he is attacking him and have the mountain beat the crap out of pedro. I really hope they execute it as well as the trial scene

3273	Jinjonator	2014-05-14	Ellaria isn't one of the Sand Snakes. She's Oberyn's paramour, not one of his daughters.
3274	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-14	Obviously he'll die, he just HAS to.
3275	Ice_and_Fire	2014-05-14	Yeah he has to die. The whole Dorne story follows on with the repercussions from his death, and the mountain needs to be wounded to lead into Robert Strong (allegedlyÂ  ).
I don't see how it would work if they dramatically alter the fight, plus the unsullied reaction to his death will be brilliant!Â
3276	Pilusmagnus	2014-05-14	I don't think it's going to happen, but theyÂ couldÂ make him survive if he yields to the Mountain before getting killed. A trial by combat is not necessarily to death, is it?
In the first Dunk and Egg adventure, Duncan's adversary just yields so why not Oberyn?
But again, it is very unlikely...

Â 
Oberyn would sooner suck the Mountain's cock than yield to him imo....the way they have built his character so far, would be the worst possible thing and not to mention cause HUUUUUGE ripple effects and D&D would lose a huge audience base
Â 
stick with your first instinct...not going to happen, Oberyn dies in 3 weeksÂ
3278	Pilusmagnus	2014-05-14	Yep, I'm absolutely sure that he is going to die, but I was just pointing the fact that technically, he could survive without altering the plot.
3279	Stark11	2014-05-14	Oberyn is going to die. We've seen scenes of Tyrion and Varys running though the tunnels in the black cells in trailers before. Why would they be doing that if Tyrion would have won his trial by combat?
3280	Dildo_Baggins	2014-05-14	I cant help but wonder if the unsullied will feel sad because the show just lost an awesome character or because Tyrion will be judged guilty.

Â 
I think initial shock will be "oh no, oberyn died, i was just starting to like him! Â " and then eventually a few seconds later...."oh shit! tyrions fucked!!!Â   "Â
3282	The Amethyst Empress	2014-05-14	Do you think they will keep the talking during the fight??I hope they do

"When will he be as he was?" Dany demanded.
Â 
"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east," said Mirri Maz Duur. "When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."


Â 
Â 


I don't know, but the sun rose in the west and set in the east (if you accept Quentin as that sun/son of Sunspear), the seas went dry (if you take the drought of the Dothraki sea as the 'seas going dry'), and if you remember correctly Dany, arguably, has a miscarriage near the end of her arc in DwD. So, most of it has come true. Maybe Drogo is coming back, or maybe the prophecy doesn't really mean Drogo is coming back, but that Dany will have a strong husband again? I don't know, but I do know that the evidence is compelling for the prophecy being fulfilled.Â 


Â 
It appeared to be a miscarriage, but she has yet to bear a living child.Â  A lot of people speculate Drogo will return in her living child.Â  Personally, this theory suits me, but it won't happen until at least TWoW, if it's going to at all.
3284	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-05-14	I hope they are going to combine Quentyn and Oberyn, making Oberyn propose to Dany and then die by fire 
Â 
Â 


I can't see Dany rejecting Oberyn. He makes Daario and Hizdahr look like mud.Â
3285	SarahApril	2014-05-14	No way. It would change the ENTIRE story.


Â 
It's been already chnged, unless Dany kicks Jorah from her side. When is that going to happen and how is he gonna meet Tyrion? They've ready twisted that plot, so I wouldn't be surprised if Oberyn would be kept alive for a few more chapters.
3286	Gneisenau	2014-05-14	Book Gregor smashed Aegon and Oberyn's head. TV Oberyn said Gregor chopped Aegon's head off, so will TV Gregor chop Obery's head ?
3287	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-05-14	this is like asking if walder frey lets robb walk out of the twins alive
3288	The Amethyst Empress	2014-05-14	I can't see Dany rejecting Oberyn. He makes Daario and Hizdahr look like mud.Â 


That's true...Even she wouldn't be stupid enough to reject him
Grrr why didn't Doran send Oberyn to Meereen in the first place to marry Dany?
Stupid,stupid Doran
3289	Uldra I	2014-05-14	Book Gregor smashed Aegon and Oberyn's head. TV Oberyn said Gregor chopped Aegon's head off, so will TV Gregor chop Obery's head ?
Yeah!  Bet you're right.  So much easier than showing a bashed head.  Actually was wondering how they'd show a bashed in skull.  :-)

Â 
I'm pretty sure we seen the start of Jorahs downfall last episode:
Â 

	Spoiler  Small council meeting before trail: Tywin asks Varys if his little birds could get as message to Dany, he asks Tyrell to fetch him quill and parchment.
3291	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-15	I'm all for adaptations trying to improve the source material when required and I do think Oberyn's death was a mistake. I know it's probably an unpopular opinion, but I think Martin was wrong by sacrificing a very colorful and engaging character just for a moment of shock.
Â 
That said, Oberyn surviving would have huge repercussions and it would be a very, very significant deviation, so he has to die
3292	Jinjonator	2014-05-15	He didn't do it for a moment of shock. He did it because it was necessary for the plot (you practically admitted as much). If Oberyn lived, Tyrion would've been found innocent, and there would be no escaping and no going to Essos.

Â 
Well, using poison in a trial by combat is illegal tho. In that case he would've been found guilty too and both of them would have to flee.

Either that or the Mountain won't get his famous lines. In the season 4 premiere Oberyn says that Elia got "split in half" by his greatsword.

None of it is confirmed it's just another fan speculation based on a single line from premiere which imho has absolutely no connection with anything other than putting emphasis on how brutal Mountain is.
3301	Half Man	2014-05-15	I honestly have no clue why it's up for discussion that the Viper will live or not...

I'm not sure which is more puzzling - that discussion or discussion over Shae's fate. I know showrunners change stuff but these two are major events. They can change details but not the outcome.

Exactly, these two HAVE to die. Shae will most definitley die, the only question everyone should be asking is HOW these two characters will die. I can see Oberyn taking a sword through his stomach and up his rib cage for some reason. Shae I can see dying with Tyrion just choking her with his own hands.

There would be no logical reason for that scene to be in if it doesn't happen. Don't say it is there to make the Mountain seem more brutal, crushing her head with his bare hands is brutal enough. Add to that that Pedro Pascal interview where he says they change some things but stick overall to the books after talking about the duel... Don't make this seem like an impossible scenario

Tv audience has no idea of this. They changed it in the show. Hence the line about the sword.
Â 
Yes they might have changed some things but in no way did he indicate they chanced the way he dies.
Â 
I'm not. You do seem convinced this is 100% what will happen though, I'm just pointing out that one line in premiere is not enough.

For me slashing him with a sword doesn't come close to what happened in the books. They do change stuff around but Gregor basically treating a good, heroic man like Oberyn like a rag doll and destroying his face is what adds to the huge shock of the scene. There needs to be some distinction between the deaths of some nameless men he kills in Sunday's episode with his sword and this.

  Â it should be the most brutal, slow, agonizing death....not just that he beat him, but he basically obliterated him....if Gregor is known for killing a man for snoring, he wouldn't just chop a man in half for trying to kill him...crushing/breaking/destroying him with his bare hands, that fitsÂ

Nah, the way he dies in the book makes sense, being in a dominant position but being too confident and being pulled to the floor and killed could happen. Gregor getting his sword back and getting into a position to cut down Oberyn? Far less likely
3313	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-15	And it will be so lame if Oberyn just cuts Gregor then dies, the impact of the whole thing was that Oberyn was completely sure of winning, everything was done and if he hadn't stepped in, he'd still be alive. That feeling of hope and then sudden despair was something the reader shared with Tyrion from when the Snake vaulted the Mountain to when he had his face crushed
3314	Red Tiger	2014-05-15	I think Oberyn will have him on the ground, then he turns his back, Clegane gets up and grabs him.

Oberyn acting like an idiot and pulling the most cliche move in a fight scene and turning his back? I hope not.

But that's the thing, what he does in the books is every bit as stupid. He had Clegane, all he needed to do was wait and let the poison do it's job. OR take that GIGANTIC sword and get some distance and slice at his more vulnerable parts. He did THE most stupid thing possible.

This does not explain why he did it from that close. He could have hacked or poked at Clegane's joints form a distance and tortured him into confessing.
3319	Hath4	2014-05-15	The red viper already knew he had killed him. he got close to look into his eyes and hear him confess. he no longer cared for his safety, the only thing that matters was justice and for him the mountain had to confess for it to be true justice.

completely agree...i hope they do it exactly like the in the book
3321	Beastman	2014-05-15	I wonder if they will make Oberyn's death graphic. Most main characters don't get a totally graphic death unless your Joffery (which still wasn't all that). I also wonder if there will be any other casualties in the battle, such as an innocent by stander getting cut in 1/2 or something.

Well Cat's death was quite graphic. But Oberyn's death is quite...unique.
Â 
I don't even know how they would go about showing that thing with fist in the mouth and teeth crushing in pieces. The only reason I see for them changing anything is if there is no way to make it look....realistic.

i would be okay with that...no need for a zoom up slow mo of his face caving in...but camera panned on Gregor while he's pounding Oberyn's face in, or while he appears to be crushing something and bellowing his confession...then after he's done, a quick glance to show it was his face he crushed, not just choked to death...

Maybe parts of teeth in the air as the mountain punches Oberyn's face as well?
3327	Volverin	2014-05-15	I wonder how are they going to show his death. Its like D&D were disucssing the death of Ned Stark, they had to decide in which frame(!) to cut to not show the sword beheading Ned.
Â 
They can't go too far, I think they will show The Mountain getting Oberyn to the ground and then taking his head and smashing it to the ground with full force and cut the frame at the moment when the head touches the floor.Â 
Â 
I strongly believe they won't ruin it, they must show Oberyn's superiority in this fight, they must show he is the better fighter and greatly skilled warrior.
3328	sati	2014-05-15	On the other hand they did show Hound stabbing that dude in the inn in eyeballs. That was pretty gross...so who knows maybe they go wild with Oberyn

3331	Gneisenau	2014-05-15	Have you guys ever watched Rob Roy ? The fight could be like the last fight in Rob Roy where Oberyn holds Gregor at spearpoint, but then Gregor grabs the poisoned spear and then cleaves Oberyn.

3333	The Lizard King	2014-05-16	Â 
Me neither. Red Viper is much catchier than Oberyn and easier for the audience to remember. It would make sense if the characters would address him as "Prince Oberyn" but talk about him as the "Red Viper of Dorne".
Â 
EDIT: P.S. Come to think of it, has Olenna ever been called the Queen of Thorns on the show?


Â 
No.

BjA¶rnsson has a pretty thick Icelandic accent from everything that I've read about him. If Ser Gregor has lines in Episode 8 (and I hope he does), then they'll probably need to be dubbed.

Not plenty of lines i guess.We've seen one at the trailer and it was basically "AAAAAAAARRGGGGGH". And than i guess he'll have his lines from the book :
â<U+0080><U+009C>Elia of Dorne,â<U+0080><U+009D>.....â<U+0080><U+009C>I killed her screaming whelp.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  â<U+0080><U+009C> Then I raped her.â<U+0080><U+009D> .... â<U+0080><U+009C>Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this.â<U+0080><U+009D>

I wonder if they'll even bring this up? They already put an idea in Unsullied minds that Jaime will fight ('Will you fight for him now?") - the idea is ridiculous, but from what some non book readers told me they really think Jaime will volunteer to fight..

Bronn was also curiously absent from last episode. There are Jaime/Tyrion and Tyrion/Oberyn scenes this week, I'm not sure there is time for 3 cell scenes. Maybe Bronn just bailed already?
3342	Arkash	2014-05-16	^ They could always aaaanother training moment between Bronn and Jaime before Bronn says something like : "Hey, if you got to see ya brother, tell him I aint gonna be his champion !" and then transition to the Jaime / Tyrion scene.
Â 
This would have to be after Cersei names the Mountain as her champion which could happen early in the episode (possible first scene).

Â 
Wow, it is like break up with your girlfriend with a text message, even the book Bronn is better than that, he at least had the decency to tell Tyrion himself
3344	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-16	For the purpose of the plot, Oberyn must die. 
Â 
I think his death will hit the Unsullied hard and having Dany somehow involved in that will dirty up her popularity. The show won't want that.


Â 
"Well we mustn't disappoint Dany" (cue Tyrion cell jpg..)

3345	Cold Feet	2014-05-17	Man I can't wait to see the fight, the split second clips in the season 4 trailers looks intense with Oberyn tiring Gregor out, but I will be sad to see his character go. Since he's been introduced, his knowledge, sarcasm, and humor has been perfect, especially how he remains sitting back chillin when Tywin enters the room.

Â 
I think he's the been the standout this season so far  . Just like how S1 was Ned Stark's season, this one looks to be Tyrion/Jon and Oberyn Martell's.

Â 
Oberyn also made it easier for the show to keep up the high number of nudity scenes. How will they manage once he's gone?

I am sure Oberyn's lines before and during the fight will make it abundantly clear who Elia was and who raped her.

Most of the Unsullied I spoke to and a glance at forums/comments indicates that, yes, they all think Jaime will be involved in the fight. It makes for pure drama (Tywin unwilling to let his beloved son risk his life and he might lose both sons, or maybe Jaime will be forced to defend the Crown and perhaps he will lose intentionally to save Tyrion, lots of interesting ideas, I like them) Also, unlike the books, viewers can't see his inner thoughts where it is clear he is struggling with the sword, they all think he's had some practice and is good to go.
Â 
With Bronn, I wonder whether he will refuse after Cersei picks the Mountain. Perhaps he'll say something like "sorry, no way I can beat him". Of course, Oberyn offering to champion Tyrion might come first, so there'll be no need to bring Bronn in the picture.
Â 
It seems likely that Bronn will be the one to escort Jaime to Riverlands,Â  and I do hope the next episode won't reveal that there was Bronn's betrayal re:Shae.

Don't be so sure. My Unsullied friend didn't understand a word of Oberyn's introduction scene, and when I began trying to explain it he stopped me and said "Wait, wait: what'sÂ Robert's Rebellion? And when did Tywin sack King's Landing? I thought he lived there!"

Â 
Sure, most unsullied might not get the full background story, but they will understand that Elia was Oberyn's sister, and of course Oberyn keeps repeating what the Mountain has done to her and her children. I assume many show viewers might not care so much about the when and why.
3354	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-17	Â 
Me neither. Red Viper is much catchier than Oberyn and easier for the audience to remember. It would make sense if the characters would address him as "Prince Oberyn" but talk about him as the "Red Viper of Dorne".
Â 
EDIT: P.S. Come to think of it, has Olenna ever been called the Queen of Thorns on the show?


Â 
Ha! That's how she's introduced!
3355	Arkash	2014-05-17	Nope, "Queen of Thorns" was never used on the show.

You think Drogo is going to come back? I agree that Quentyn could be viewed as a Sun that rises in the west and sets in the east, but the end part of what she says ("then he will return") kind of indicates that it's not a prophecy so much as MMD's way of saying "he's gone."
Â 
Â 
Â 
"When will he be as he was?" Dany demanded.
Â 
"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east," said Mirri Maz Duur. "When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."


watch elio and lindas video on the prophecies...the third video explains this whole thing as a "set of conditions" rather than prophesy that were (maybe) accidently set forth cause of the magical element that surrounds Dany. Â Interesting stuff

3377	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	I kinda wish Oberyn will survive the duel; Pedro has just been such a surprise package and definitely the highlight of the season thus far.

His death is such an iconic moment in the book, and I want Unsullied to feel the rage that I did... but I think I'd be alright if they decided to let him live. I mean, I highly doubt they'd change it, but... I feel so conflicted!

3385	Defeatarion	2014-05-19	It's a shame this season has been pretty dull. There was so much material yet they cut out a lot of it for pointless scenes (Like Yara Asha whats her face). This scene and a certain scene at the end of book 3 will define the season. Oberyn living would ruin it. I love his character, but he's gotta die, and died the right way. Splintered teeth anyone?Â
3386	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Oberyn is season 4's Ned.

Yes and isn't anyone looking forward to the Sand Snakes. Ned died-war started. 
What do you think The Red. Vipers daughters will do?
3387	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	I wonder if they will make Oberyn's death graphic. Most main characters don't get a totally graphic death unless your Joffery (which still wasn't all that). I also wonder if there will be any other casualties in the battle, such as an innocent by stander getting cut in 1/2 or something.


Â 
I disagree.
Â 
They didn't shy away from Robb!Wind or gut stabbing a pregnant lady.
Â 
It will be likeÂ this scene. Â
3388	kjm16216	2014-05-19	Everybody suggesting that Oberyn survives needs to just stop.Â  It completely changes the character of major threads from now on.Â  This isn't merging Edric Storm and Gendry, this isn't a diversion to go fight again at Craster's keep, this isn't making Robb's wife an Essosi.Â  This would mean Tyrion was innocent at trial and has no reason to escape, kill Tywin, head for Essos.Â  It would mean that the Sand Snakes don't start their little coup d'etat and spoil the reveal of Doran's long game.Â  I like the character too, I think Pascal has done a fabulous job of it, but if you think this is going to happen, we're not reading the same books.Â  And on top of all that, his death will be GREAT TV.Â  It will be shocking to the Unsullied as much as it was for readers, it will be brutal and graphic Hello, my name is Oberyn Martell... you killed my sister... prepare to die!
Â 
Coming in close to the Mountain isn't just arrogance, it isn't just making him confess, he's not just trying to prolong the Mountain's pain, he also wants to hear that Tywin ordered it.Â  And just as foreshadowed with Bronn, one mistake and... BAM.Â  And Tyrion pukes because its brutal and he knows he's dead.
Â 
But I wonder what they are going to do with Bronn?Â  Are they really going to just let him disappear?Â  They could send him with Tyrion but that will mess up a lot of things in that thread.Â  They could send him with Jamie to the Riverlands, like they did with Pod and Jamie, turn a lot of the internal thoughts into dialog.

3392	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-19	Ran has said that it is not confirmed that HBO Canada will air the episode. There's no logical way that the episode is aired next week anywhere.
Â 
Oberyn will definitely die; D&D make small adaptations but the main story is always going to be in tact.Â 
Â 
I think the bigger question is WILL WE SEE OBERYN SOMEHOW POISONING TWYIN? I've never been a big fan of that theory but cannot deny the validity of it and it remains one of the most unique and interesting ones, IMO.Â 
Â 
Now, if we are not shown Oberyn poisoning Tywin or he doesn't offer some quip to Tyrion before the battle about "ensuring justice will happen regardless of if I win or not" etc, etc, does that put the theory to rest? Even if he does offer something along those lines in a pre-battle quip should we take that as meaning something deeper or just that he's fighting Gregor with the poisoned spear?Â 
Â 
That's what I'm really looking forward to with the episode.

Â 
Well plot-wise, Oberyn poisoning Tywin is moot, because Tywin dies at Tyrion's hands. So Oberyn poisoning him in the books may just be a little Easter egg for readers who look for it, but because it never amounts to anything, the show will likely not focus on it.
3394	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	The Unsullied are going to feel something they haven't felt since Ned died once the Red Viper meets the same fate. "We only get one season of this guy?! Fuck!"

That's a big reason why I've never really been on board with the theory because since Tyrion kills him, it's irrelevant. But I still am curious to see if D&D give any weight to it because of what it would mean for some of the other big theories out there and if they will ever come to fruition or not.
3396	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	I think the show is humouring the theory and leaving little clues but nothing will be revealed.
Â 
In the last episode Oberyn said he will start with his justice on Gregor. This highly suggests he is going after Tywin too.
Â 
I just want to see how much the show empathises the stench of Tywin's corpse- itÂ can easily be skipped if not relevant and mute the theory.

Its relevant to whether he knows who is in his bedroom, or if she was planted there.
I think he may have been poisone, but not necessarily fatally (just something to keep him occupied on the toilet), and not necessarily the viper.
3400	Widows_Blood	2014-05-19	As someone who has HBO Canada please air the episode next week. That being said, it would not make much sense for that. So many spoilers would make it online ruining it for the unsullied. The episode will end up being torrented anyways and thus a week later the viewing numbers would probably decrease for that reason alone. So they may as well not skip Memorial Day weekend.Â
3401	King Tommen	2014-05-19	I have HBO Canada and next Sunday I can see from my program guide on my DVR that they're showing a movie at 9:00PM followed by a repeat of E5. So no, they aren't showing a new episode and I have no idea where that rumor would have come from.
Â 
If anything was going to happen, they would have not shown Mockingbird this past Sunday as it is actually our long weekend (Victoria Day) and then they could have played it next weekend when we don't have a holiday to catch up to the U.S. But HBO Canada mirrors the US schedule religiously so I always expect them to be in lockstep with whatever the mothership is doing.
3402	drstrangelove	2014-05-19	I always interpreted the stench as Tywin just being really evil son of a b-tch. And that it  was a good literally method of showing  it.  I never looked past that.

3404	RobertF	2014-05-20	So did anyone else here throw the book across the room after finishing the duel between Oberyn and Gregor Clegane?
Â 
Gregor gets his ass kicked by Oberyn, impaled with a poisoned spear, and still managed to kill Oberyn? Didn't seem terribly realistic.Â
3405	Mr Hodor	2014-05-20	Just wonder what people think about the vipers...
Â 

	Spoiler  death. I belief that he will kill the mountain but not die as in the books. I hope they are going to combine Quentyn and Oberyn, making Oberyn propose to Dany and then die by fire 

Â 
We have seen alot of differences so far, this is one i would welcome. How about you guys?


Â 
Â 


Nice how everyone gets carried away about how the death of Oberyn got Dorne involved.Yes the dorn is boiling after the news reach them but do we see war happening ? No! So its kinda pointless for the show unless the skip Aegon. Oberyn has made it pretty clear in the show how much they hate the Lannisters. Lets face it they are not going to introduce 10 new characters in the next season. They don't want to confuse the unsullied. Doran Martell, Arianne and maybe only just maybe they introduce Darkstar, Quentyn is not gonna happen.
Â 
They could have the viper kill the mountain and him being badly injured. It would be good for the audience to see that not even the red viper a fearsome warrior is not able to mount a dragon.
Â 
Â 
Might not happen - but it could.


If viper lives Tyrion is innocent, then tywin is alive and cersei does not do all the idiotic things, Varys does not flee KL, Kevan lives, Jaime is back at the rock, Dorne is peaceful.
Quentyn is a major POV character in the books i doubt that they will cut him off completely.
Â
3406	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-20	You'd be better off trying to figure out who didn't have that kind of reaction to that fight. The way Gregor killed Oberyn was realistic enough. It's the fact that an alleged seasoned fighter would deviate from his strategy before his opponent was dead, WHEN HE IS IN POSITION TO KILL HIM, that is unrealistic to me.
3407	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-20	The rest of the Martells and the Sand Snakes better be fucking amazing in the show to make up for this loss! In fact, all of Dorne should be aces.
Â 
I am going to need some extra large dark nipples to fill the Oberyn-shaped hole that episode 8 will leave on my life

If viper lives Tyrion is innocent, then tywin is alive and cersei does not do all the idiotic things, Varys does not flee KL, Kevan lives, Jaime is back at the rock, Dorne is peaceful.
Quentyn is a major POV character in the books i doubt that they will cut him off completely.
Â 

Until teh viper starts taking his revenge on the others like Tywin, you mean?
3411	RobertF	2014-05-20	Reread the passage - it is through the belly. But there's a huge artery passing through the abdomen, which Oberyn would have aimed for. Shock and blood loss would have finished off Gregor quickly, he wouldn't have the strength to crush a man's head.
3412	Starry	2014-05-20	The viper has to die or Tyrion would be proven innocent.

In one of the first trailers was a scene with Tyrion where he says something like "Come for a last look". Seems to be the scene after the fight when Jamie comes to free him.

Â 
By the way, I know the talk is all about the trial, but the other scenes look to be incredibly well done also. That Sansa scene looks incredibly tense and well done (like all Sansa scenes this season), and the raid of Mole's Town will give us some welcome Wildling action. Most of all though (apart from the trial), I am excited for Theon and Ramsay's scene, which looks to extremely eerie. If they pull all these moments off, I can see it becoming my all time favourite episode of the show (I can also see them topping it with the very next episode, and topping even that with The Children).  I can't wait for the things we will witness in the next four weeks!

Well, either one or the other is happening in episode 8. The way I see it, the bones would just be presented in 8 and early in 10 we'll see the dragons getting chained and Drogon escaping. Later in the episode, Dany banishes Jorah. But now that I think about it, your way makes more sense.

Â 
I don't see how the fight dialogue could be skipped. It's integral to the entire scene. Without it, we don't see Oberyn's or Gregor's characterization reach their zeniths. First of all, Oberyn's hubris would come off as empty if his misstep doesn't come from his obsession to bring justice to Elia by forcing her murderer/rapist to admit his culpability. And the reason the scene is so interesting for the Mountain is that it adds an element to his character--taking him beyond the cliche sadistic, brutish giant--when he calls attention to Oberyn's slip-up about the order in which the crime unfolded. To me, his dialogue shows a new level of weird, cold calculation on his part.Â 
Â 
Now, if any dialogue is cut, it'll be Clegane's, I would think. Maybe the showrunners will want to keep it simple and keep him a vicious brute. But the fight wouldn't be "the culmination of 20 years of anger and hatred and thirst for vengeance coming to a head," as Weiss has described it, if we don't get some incarnation of Oberyn's lines.

I noticed that too. Can't have it be any other way; Tyrion needs to start his descent towards becoming a grayer character in the show.Â
3437	Konradsmith	2014-05-20	^And he has already, so they're on the right course. The trial broke him and he's been pretty dark and moody of late. Him doing the deed will still shock and surprise people but they've made it emotionally plausible now.

Since Tywin is so much more likeable on the show, I wonder if people will actually be upset at his death. I can already foreseeÂ certain viewersÂ complaining that having him sleeping around ruins his character, despite that being the whole point of that particular reveal.

Yeah the trial scene did start to turn it around but the killings will really get his hands dirty and officially begin the journey IMO. Still, that material and the Oberyn-Tyrion scene in Ep.7 were Dinklage's Emmy-nom reel this season undoubtedly since he really nailed them.
Â 
You're right to think that people will probably react that way as well. The show did a great job of never hinting at it (that Tywin sleeps around, not that he had Shae taken since that was made clear), as you'd expect, but since we had so much more Tywin in the show than the books because of no POV chapters that was a street they could have walked down and I'm glad they never did.Â

When he met Ellaria for example when he said "charmed" he seemed to be sizing her up. Also when Tywin barges in on Oberyn at the brothel in 403, he looked at the girls as they passed him (he did it discreetly but I saw it). Not to mention his remarkÂ to Cersei at the wedding breakfast, telling herÂ to send Shae to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
Â 
Since Alex Graves will be directing the Tower of the Hand confrontation I think he put in these Tywin moments with the future revelation in mind. Or maybe I'm overanalyzing.

Right-I included the Shae one; interesting on the other points-I'll have to go back post-season and rewatch to catch them so good catches on your part. I should have been more clear; we've been around Tywin a lot, since Season 1, and I don't think there's ever really been any mention or subtle hints period prior to this season, where the examples you've offered, aside from Shae, are the subtlest of hints, if you can even call them that, possible. They're almost more of a goody for acute watchers such as yourself to pick up on along the way before we get to Ep. 10. Though now I will need to see at some point when I'm sick over a weekend or something and watch the first three seasons over if there were ever any other subtle hints, gestures, etc.

I'll have to watch again, but I was pretty sure that during Tyrion and Jamie's exchange during Ep 7, Tyrion briefly mentions his previous marriage to a whore, and Jaime gives him a concerned look (because he knows the truth). I think they will definitely have Jamie reveal to Tyrion what really happened with Tysha.

Maybe, but I think the contrary: it would have been very easy to reestablish Tysha during that conversation, so it doesn't look like it comes out of the blue when Jaime tells him the truth in Ep 10. They just needed to add something like "I fell in love with a whore... again" or something to that effect. So I actually think they've cut the whole "Tysha wasn't a whore" thing. And, let's face, anyone who isn't bing watching will probably not going to remember about that scene back at season 1.

It's a shame that Oberyn will have to die again, I think the show has just reached such a bad level in regards to general direction and writing that I'd fully support such radical changes if they kept the better characters in it for longer. It would also make things a lot more interesting as we'd all be unaware of what was going to happen, the show is never going to be perfect tv so why not have the suspense and wonder. Shame that of all the annoying changes that happens it won't be this one.
3457	Grayven	2014-05-21	I can think of a way to proceed with an Oberyn victory that allows the Tyrion plotline to continue as written; poison is against the rules for a trial by combat, isn't it? Â If you don't mind losing the Sand Snakes, that could work.
Â 
But I expect them to definitely allow the Dorne/Snakes plot to develop, so it would then have to be a pretty serious departure from the books. Â Oberyn proceeds to nail audience member and revenge target Tywin with the dripping spear? Â Tyrion and Oberyn awaits the headsman in the same cell? Â Flee Kings Landing together? Â 
Â

I always had the notion that book Renly was a pretty cool dude and then the show sort of just ruined him.

Plus everything about Dorne and Essos was so much more fun for me than most of the Iron Island stuff which I could care less about, really.


Â 
Renly in the book was a huge squid. A man ready to kill children he believed to be his real nephews and openly talked about killing his brother, all in the name of personal ambition.
Â 
I also never liked how he made fun of Shireen or Brienne behind her back.
Â 
In the show he was portrayed a little weaker but didn't seem like a bad guy.
3465	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-22	I'll have to watch again, but I was pretty sure that during Tyrion and Jamie's exchange during Ep 7, Tyrion briefly mentions his previous marriage to a whore, and Jaime gives him a concerned look (because he knows the truth). I think they will definitely have Jamie reveal to Tyrion what really happened with Tysha.


Â 
your right, i did notice that....thats why im really hopeful....but unless they show that scene in the recap of that ep, unsullied wont get it for sure!Â
3466	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-22	Â 
Yeah, my unsullied friends were showing this meme around after the trial episode:

Â 
 Â  awesome!Â
3467	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-22	Â Â  awesome!Â 

Ah, so that's where whores go
3468	Ginevra	2014-05-22	It's a shame this season has been pretty dull. There was so much material yet they cut out a lot of it for pointless scenes (Like Yara Asha whats her face). This scene and a certain scene at the end of book 3 will define the season. Oberyn living would ruin it. I love his character, but he's gotta die, and died the right way. Splintered teeth anyone?

Â 
I would disagree. Â For me, this season has been the best season so far, by far, when I really didn't expect they'd be able to top Season 3 with this season's material. Â But they have, according to the average ratings, at least.
Â http://graphtv.kevin...s.com/tt0944947
Â 
The orange, periwinkle, and green lines for the first three seasons all have a midpoint that's just barely above or barely below nine. Â But the pink regression line for Season 4 has a midpoint that is slightly above 9.25, which is a big jump considering how close to 9 all of the other midpoints are. Â And these are how fans are rating the episodes. Â 
Â 
The viewership ratings for first viewings of Season 4 episodes has been ridiculously higher, http://en.wikipedia....hrones_episodes, but that could be from the hype of the Red Wedding and not necessarily because the episodes this season are better.
Â 
I do agree that the Asha scenes were insanely bad to the point that the story, and certainly Asha's character development, would have been better off without them. Â I wonder if there is a story behind why these scenes were so messed up. Â Could there have been something cut in between the dogs in their cages and Team Asha running for the boats that got cut because it was too graphicly gruesome? Â There is a strong feeling of discontinuity between those two scenes that also makes me think something was cut out at the last minute. Â Or would we have heard about that?

3469	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-22	I felt like the biggest difference in this season compared to the last 2 especially is that there have been lots of ups and downs...like s3 for example, other than ep 4 and sack of astapor, i dont rmr there being another really action packed or really "HOLY SHIT!" moment till Red Wedding...so it was a steady build up till the end...
Â 
this season, being a second half of a book, started off with a bang, purple wedding...and since then lots of really high moments, comparatively some scenes like Asha or Crasters seemed out of place...even E07, after the amazing Trial, I had huge expectations for it to top that ep and just be bigger and grander...doesnt make it a bad ep, but felt slow, out of place or something...
Â 
but...only 3 to go now...
best fight scene ever this ep
best battle scene ever in ep 9
and wrap up plus next season build up ep 10
Â 
so hopefully it goes only uphill moving forwardÂ
3470	Milcov	2014-05-22	Book Renly a badass? Really? I don't know, I tend to take Donal Noye's thoughts on the Baratheon brothers as the most definitive statement on them, and he's none too kind to Renly. Other than that I totally agree with you, and I'm super pumped we might get Dorne! (I'm one of those weirdos who loved the Arys Oakhart subplot)


I think Donal Noye's thoughts are pretty worthless considering that he regards Robert as "true steel", Robert who was a drunken oaf who beat his wife and took no part in attempting to rule or be a just ruler in any way. Donal Noye is a blacksmith who saw Robert as a good warrior who had a bit of charisma, Stannis was a warrior but who would rub everyone the wrong way and be a bit stiff whereas Renly wasn't a warrior at all. It's no surprise that Donal Noye didn't associate Renly with anything positive though it says more about who Noye was than Renly.

Â 
Regarding the first bolded part- the ratings have been rising in between episodes, which shows that it is more than just the Red Wedding hype (that would have only affected Ep 1 and maybe 2). This shows that the episodes themselves have been stellar enough to retain people's interests and get them to watch the next one.Â 
Â 
Regarding bolded part 2- Bryan Cogman himself said that parts of it were cut- it was meant to be a much bigger fight. We also saw footage from the scene in the trailer that wasn't there in the show. This could be because Ramsay probably does something to Myranda, and they had gotten sick by the stupid controversy that people were creating about the show and the baseless claims that it is mysogynist. I wish we could have had the entire scene
3472	Frey Pies	2014-05-22	By the way, I usually look at IMDB ratings as a means to see how well the show is doing in relation to previous seasons, since quite a large number of people view there, providing a better representative of the average person's views on the episodes.Â 
Â 
So far, if we consider Episodes 1-5 of each season, the average rating per episode, until each seasons midway point, is:
Season 1: 8.82
Season 2: 8.76
Season 3: 8.86
Season 4: 9.10Â 
Â 
Season 4 is miles ahead when compared.
Â 
Also, it looks like it will easily have the highest average rating for Episodes 6-10 also.
So far, for 6-10, the average ratings are:
Season 1: 9.24
Season 2: 9.16
Season 3: 9.06
Â 
S4E6 and S4E7 got a 9.8 and a 9.3 rating respectively, which averages out to an astounding average of 9.55. The last 3 episodes, I am sure, will all end up with 9.5 plus, so the average will stay stagnant or will ascend even higher.
Â 
I agree with the general consensus, that this has been the best season, by far. There is negativity in some places, sure, bet there always is at this time of the season. Last year, almost everyone on facebook was saying that Season 3 is extremely boring, etc. However, after the last 3 episodes air, it all changes. I'm sure the extremely small minority of people who don't like the season will change their minds after the coming trio.Â

Â 
not just that...but the whole drama after Jamie/Cersei in Breaker of Chains ep too...
Â 
i feel bad for D&D, they not only have to worry about lack of time, and budget and GRRM's inability to finish the books...now they have to cave to these criticism and change their show, leading to the declining quality of the show....
Â 
they are in a lose-lose-lose-lose-small win-lose-lose situation
3474	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-22	I think Donal Noye's thoughts are pretty worthless considering that he regards Robert as "true steel", Robert who was a drunken oaf who beat his wife and took no part in attempting to rule or be a just ruler in any way. Donal Noye is a blacksmith who saw Robert as a good warrior who had a bit of charisma, Stannis was a warrior but who would rub everyone the wrong way and be a bit stiff whereas Renly wasn't a warrior at all. It's no surprise that Donal Noye didn't associate Renly with anything positive though it says more about who Noye was than Renly.


I'm sorry, but I highly doubt that Martin was using this opportunity to shed light on the inner depths of Donal Noye's psyche, a relatively minor side character despite his awesome demise. Dialogue like this gives us important insight in further understanding the Baratheon brothers, as Noye seems like a relatively detatched third party all things considered, and honestly it would be poor writing if it was thrown out there for no reason. Robert was as you said a "drunken oaf" but he never lacked for internal fortitude, and if nothing else, had the strength not only to usurp the throne, but to keep the Seven Kingdoms together afterwards. Noye is likely speaking both towards his strength as a warrior, his charisma, and the strength of his convictions. All in all, even with his drinking and whoring, the Seven Kingdoms wasn't really all that bad off under Robert in comparison to Joffrey, Tommen, or Aerys, and that's not really saying much but it's something. Saying he's the "true steel" doesn't neccessarily imply he doesn't have a good deal of faults, however. As for the other two, his thoughts on Stannis are completely accurate, and totally reflected in everything we've seen of him in the novels. I guess you can debate the Renly point, but I certainly had the sense that despite his people skills Renly himself was arrogant and weak. And not just weak in terms of being a warrior. Olenna's quote also reinforces this point: "He knew how to dress and he knew how to smile and he knew how to bathe, and somehow he got the notion that this made him fit to be king."
3475	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-05-22	About how Oberyn will die, Lena and Pedro (Cersei and Oberyn) were on a magazine together, and there was ->Â this interesting picture. I saw someone speculate that they might be hinting at Oberyn's death, and that would mean it stays the same as in the books. I don't really know what to think of that, but it would be pretty crafty.


Â 
Â 
Oh, damn...It's going to be as gory as it was described in the books. Â That's a brutal way to go, perfect for GoT and the Mountain.
3476	Frumpus	2014-05-22	He had a man made into soup in order to keep Shae a secret. Not a paragon of virtue.


Â 
Ned Stark would have done the same thing (maybe not killed him in that way but had the man killed somehow). If that man had lived, everything Tyrion worked for would have been undone at that point.
3477	The Prophet of Patch	2014-05-22	^ lolwut. Ned was the whitest of white hats.
3478	Ankou	2014-05-22	Wasn't the soup guy a jerk?
3479	HarlQuinn	2014-05-22	I have never loved a character in the book and now in the show the same way I love Oberyn; while him living would be the the most glorious moment of S4 (along with Joffs death) I think his death is necessary.
Speaking of deaths though shouldn't...
	Spoiler shouldnt Sando be dead as well if im not mistaken Polliver= the battle that horribly wounds Clegane. Anyone else tgnk his bite will fester and he'll die?

Absolutely. Unless he has another fatal encounter which would just be getting repetitive and weird. It makes me sad though. Such a small bite... why the show gotta do this

Â 
That actually makes a lot of sense. The episode was I think 7 minutes short, I didn't understand why Ramsay was covered in blood/cuts when he encountered the iron born, and the line "this is turning into a lovely evening" seemed out of place if he was just talking about "had sex, now I get to fight!"
Â 
Also, this article definitely suggests that they'll be filming Dorne in Spain next season, so I hope with so many people dying in the next few episodes, we'll get some awesome Dornish cast members to match the beautiful locale. They could probably even use Spain for Tyrion scenes on the Rhoyne.

I know I want them to do his character justice. I actually like Sandor a lot. I will admit though extending his time on the show has been a pro for me Team f@#$ the King ftw. (The actors have great on screen chemistry the scene where she cleans his wounds is like a daughter doting on her father).

Well some characters are certainly misogynistic, just ask Roz after the second bolt broke her flesh. Â  There are plenty of examples of philogyny too, especially from the Red Viper. Â I agree that the controversy is stupid, but I see where the unsullied are led to errant conclusions. Â Sheep. Â Mere sheep.

Well they definitely need to give a good amount of screen time to Young Griff. I could see it being 4 episodes, then Volantis, where Tyrion is captured by Jorah in ep. 5, and the rest of the season to finish that arc

Highly unlikely! There will be a bit of Dorne and Jorah will meet Tyrion quite early!They have to fit in the Ironborn as well asÂ  Cersie, Jon/Winterfell.I'm pretty positive that we will see new stuff from episode 9 (season 5) onwards if not earlier.
Sansas arc is almost finished so is Brans. I doubt they pass a season without those actors.

As much as I'd like it to happen- I doubt it. The websites looking to create controversy are going to report it anyway, and there'll be tons of criticism about including it.

I doubt Martin intends it to be totally about Donal Noye but he's also aware that the dialogue he writes from his characters have to come from them, and not simply his own views of those characters (Baratheon's). Noye's assessment of Stannis is pretty spot-on, but he's way off on Robert. You can say that the Seven Kingdoms did okay under Robert, but that's because he just buts out and lets Jon Arryn reign. Which means that at his best Robert can be compared with Tommen who also leaves actual ruling to others. The difference of course being that Tommen is a child. Any assessment of Robert as "true steel" is so far off base that I can't trust the character judgement of any who makes it. On Renly I side more with you and Olenna than Renly's view of himself as he doesn't seem to think things through very well, but I don't trust Noye at all.

I don't think his assessment of any of them was particularly accurate. Stannis is not inflexible, he's made plenty of compromises and bent the rules when he's had to. Even Renly can't have been the frivolous peacock, he managed to win over the Stormlands from his brother and ally with another powerful house to assemble the biggest army in Westeros. If it hadn't been for inflexible Stannis making a shadow baby with a sorceress (truly the action of a hide bound conservative!) he'd be King by now.
IMO Noye was used to summarise how the Baratheon brothers were viewed in Westeros and as readers we're expected to decide if that's really true. Unfortunately the TV show Stannis is such a travesty I'm genuinely wondering if I can carry on watching it, though Davos is bang on the money so maybe I'll half close my eyes and concentrate on him.

In fact I did it was a nice bit of foreshadowing if you ask me and I think it wad a way to extend his death because in all honesty him dying a few episodes later wouldnt hurt. I wish they could do the same for Overyn, but his abrupt death is what trigger many storylines. Looking forward to next Sunday and yet dreading it.
3500	Le Cygne	2014-05-24	Oberyn, I guess it depends on what they are going to do with the Dorne storyline. I agree, his death is what triggers the rest of the story there.Sandor, who knows, seems like if this was going to fester, it would happen sooner, rather than later. There's a big fight scene ahead, how is he going to fight in a weakened state?Brienne fell into a fever pretty quickly, and was very weak, but she didn't die from the bite.

Nymeria is slowly reading the message, refusing to believe the message's contents.Â  Obara drops her spear and falls to her knees, and Tyene remains emotionless and quiet.Â  Afterwards, Nym and Obara decide to set out and find Doran.Â  Tyene stays behind, and pulls out the poem Oberyn wrote in season 4.Â  Tyene begins to read it aloud to herself.Â  It will reveal the Myrcella plot to the viewers, and perhaps even a hint/instructions to kill Tommen.
3503	Konradsmith	2014-05-25	Given some of this discussion on how the Sandor "death" will go down, I recommend (re)watching the "weapons and training" featurette on the GoT youtube channel. C.C. Smiff the swordmaster for the show talks about how the Hound is powerful and can "just chop you in half". Over this we don't see a single bit of the Inn fight from episode one but we do get looks at Rory and Maisie when they filmed in Iceland in the cliffy sort of area they've used for the Vale thus far this season. These snippets show a fight, though they purposefully confuse the viewer as to who the fight will be with. We do get a look at some Knights of the Vale in the video so that settles it for me.
Â 
This much alone leads me to believe that Sandor will be in "good form" (as Cersei said of Gregor last ep.) when he faces his last (for a while at least) fight. And given the glimpses of Arya training in the same video she may well help out a good deal too. The Mountain and the Viper may well be the best episode of the show so far, that is until ep. nine and ten come along.

I prefer if they were introduced as they were in the book - pleading to Doran to take action with their own plans. Except all at once, taking turns.
3505	Arrowtic	2014-05-25	the red viper is one of my favorite characters from the show now. Â i wish there was a good way for him to survive. Â i like the idea of him being disqualified for poison, sentenced to death and then he and tyrion taking off together. Â jorah isn't there (at the moment) to hook up with tyrion so maybe some more plot changes do lie ahead.


He's my most favorite character ever , but still Â I hope he dies ! That kind of death will make him immortal in people's minds , just like Ned Stark . The way you suggested will decrease his charisma deeply and it'll destroy that aura around him . I just hope that The Mountain dies in the same episode and his death won't be postponed to episode 10 so at least Prince Oberyn will dies just before getting his long awaited revenge .
P.S1 : I don't think I'll be able to endure his violent death 
P.S2 : Just think about Prince Doran's line in the next season : Vengeance , Justice , Fire and Blood .
3506	boojam	2014-05-25	Just wonder what people think about the vipers...Â 
	Spoiler  death. I belief that he will kill the mountain but not die as in the books. I hope they are going to combine Quentyn and Oberyn, making Oberyn propose to Dany and then die by fire 
Â We have seen alot of differences so far, this is one i would welcome. How about you guys?I tell you the book confused me on this issue, because in Feast Gregor just flat dies ... even if Qyburn did the Dr. Frankenstein thing to him, the walking dead is dead!So here's my confusion, where they going to wait and see if Gregor dies or not?What happens in this â<U+0080>trial by combatâ<U+0080><U+0099> thing if both combatants die? Is it a draw and they have to do it again until there is somebody dies? Or is the way of it whoever dies first? That does not seem fair.Yeah, I know, Cersei was out to get him anywayâ<U+0080>¦ but that means that Tywin loses Dorne as an ally which he does not want. The Wiki says that Tywin was willing to sacrifice Gregor , and that sounds reasonable, tho I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t remember it from the book. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seems that Tywin loses worse than Tyrion by what is in the book.

3514	GHOSTSTARK	2014-05-27	As much as I would love to see him survive, it is just too pivotal a moment to deviate from.


 Â Â
3515	Daenor	2014-05-27	I don't think they're gonna change the outcome of Mountain vs Viper.Oberyn needs to die and the Mountain to survive, so that Tyrion is declared guilty.And of course as other people mentioned Oberyn's death is what practically triggers the Dornish arc
Also i think they'll make it more clear at the show about Mountain turning to un-Gregor.
3516	Waxfoot	2014-05-27	Oberyn's death is also important characterisation for Oberyn himself. It really sums him up that he died that way, so hungry for the confession even though he'd already nailed the Mountain. Without the death, Oberyn hasn't gone to quite the same length to drag the confession out. He must die, as all men must.
3517	Waxfoot	2014-05-27	"Tywin, you must try my delicious Dornish pepper stew..."

Â 
If I was a betting man, the smart money is that the credits will come up seconds after Oberyn's defeat. Which means The Mountain will die in Episode 10.

Is it really though, at this time it's pretty much predictable, like we get it Martin , nobody is safe into this world, the problem being is when you doing too much it's not really that groundbreaking anymore. In fact i was more shocked for Joffrey's and Tywin's death in the book than Oberyn dying, which pretty much says something about that .
3520	acacia	2014-05-28	Im not sure how i want The Mountains death to play out, on one hand it would be good to eventually see him fight Sandor if he's revealed in the future books. But at the same time, the being brought back to life minus a head just seemed absolutely ridiculous and cheesy in the books at the time.
Â 
I think id prefer for him to actually survive the fight and either be paralysed from the poison or whatever, but the Lannisters lie and say he's dead to everyone.

I was under the impression that the head sent to Dorne was not actually his head, and that he was preserved as the zombie kingsguard.

Â 
Right, my point being that he wasn't brought back to life without a head as the previous post said.Â  In the books, they send his skull to Dorne.Â  Instead, some other head (probably a gorilla or plaster cast or something) was sent to Dorne while the intact body of Gregor was Frankensteined into Robert Strong.

Â 
i have no idea why...but i immediately pictured Sandor's head sewed on to Gregors body to make Robert Strong...now wouldn' that be something!Â
3528	Misnthropia	2014-05-29	I think its a bit absurd we are even considering the notion of Oberyn surviving. He MUST die. Yeah ok, hes a fan favourite but thats the theme for ASOIAF, noone is safe from Death. So much comes from this fight that it would be a far stretch for even D&D to alter this one.
Â 
I dont think it will be a huge loss, sure Pedro is a fantastic actor and Oberyn is a great charachter but Oberyn has dropped a massive hint that Darkstar is coming. D&D can turn Darkstar into the new fan favourite. We know that GRRM was surprised he didnt take off and I think he will come across to the TV Viewers in the way that GRRM initially intended and will fill that void left by Oberyn.
Â 
I can see the episode ending with Oberyn being killed (impaled, cut in two, smashed in the face w/e) the Mountain laying on the ground and Tyrion throwing up and bang credits.
Â 
Next episode, open up with the Mountain withering in pain akin to Joff, screaming in agony.
3529	Jinjonator	2014-05-29	What was the Darkstar hint?

That was more foreshadowing if anything than a hint, they could still do that plotline with another character, it doesn't have to be Darkstar .

I was thinking the same thing. I don't get why people like the Darkstar so much? Is it because he has such a cool nickname or that he is mysterious and people can make up a lot more about him to fit what they like? Because his only major action in the book is a pretty terrible thing, trying to murder a child.

Â 
As for Darkstar, he's of the night.Â  But honestly what do we know about him? Other than kinda-sorta foiling Arianne, what else does he do?Â  I don't remember any significant deeds.Â  He's no big baddy or anti-hero...at least that was not my impression at all.Â 
Â 
Take Victarion: a great character who is legitimately scary to me, so I hope he makes it into the show.Â  Hmm, lemme go check the casting forum.Â  But Vic is more like the new Hound...another wannabe fratricide.
3542	westerosifitness	2014-05-31	Pedro's Oberyn is so different from the book version. You don't sympathize with the Viper the way we've sympathized with Pedro. He has more dimensions and is less of a firecracker.Â

I think it will be harder seeing TV Oberyn go than it was for book Oberyn. Book Oberyn was cool and edgy fun and to watch. Pedro, along with those things, is a sympathetic character.Â

I had never heard of him, but I trusted in D&D to make a good choice for such a part.

Â 
100% agree with you. It is only now I am in my first re-read, and thanks to this forum that I have been able to get all the subtle hints and exposition GRRM drops in lots of chapters.
Â 
Realizing Viper was basically Game of Thrones Boba Fett x a million is actually only fully realized A. After his death B. With the ripples that it causes in other peoples chapters C. In all the subtle hints and info we get from other characters
Â 
You are completely spot on my friend.
Â 
For example, whenever he, and Dorne in general were introduced I rolled my eyes, and went this whole plot sucks, stick with what works GRRM! Now, I would say that Dorne is arguably the realm of the 7 Kingdoms I want to spend more time in! Lol.
Â 
Great post.
3558	Dudu42	2014-06-02	About how Oberyn will die, Lena and Pedro (Cersei and Oberyn) were on a magazine together, and there was ->Â this interesting picture. I saw someone speculate that they might be hinting at Oberyn's death, and that would mean it stays the same as in the books. I don't really know what to think of that, but it would be pretty crafty.


I'm starting to think that Lena and Pedro got along pretty well in real life. Whenever I see both of them in the pictures they seem to have such a great time.

Yep, it's the first rule of screenwriting.

Â 
I understand that tv is a different medium. They had to show him fight early on to let viewers in on his skill and they (sort of) did. But they could have then thrown in a few lines from other characters discussing his abilities and reputation. Maybe have Jaime talk about him a bit. Build him up slowly over the course of a few episodes and then have him talk to Tyrion in his cell before the trial. Instead they chose to show him twirl that spear like Darth Maul at the start of the combat because...oh yeah he's a bad ass.Â 
Â 
As for Robb Stark, that's a whole other conversation.Â
3564	Mel_Rose	2014-06-02	Well, considering almost everyone in the audience loved him to bits, I'd say whatever the writers/producers did + his incredible acting worked.
Â 
I have seen dozens of comments on reddit today from book readers that said that they liked him as a character in the book but they loved him in the show. I am one of them.

Until they watched the episode 7 scene with the Mountain.
3566	Ankou	2014-06-02	It'd be worse if we heard the screams and Tyrion just narrated what was happening.Â
3567	Robbie Hood	2014-06-02	It was everything I'd hoped for.
3568	Sand11751	2014-06-03	I just watched inside the episode, which I always love for D&D's take on things:Â https://www.youtube....h?v=RB3vgeMijCc and Â at 8:55 the word "poisoned" is used referring to the Mountain - if I hadn't known the story it would have been a WTF moment. I don't remember it being explicit in the book. So I'm glad D&D are keeping with the book. How hard would it be for viewers only to make the connection between the duel and the sudden appearance of a new KG member in a future season? Especially if they keep the same actor.

3571	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2014-06-03	Okay, I still need to re-read the chapter before I address this in the book threads, but actually seeing the fight on screen made me realize something that never quite stood out to me on the page:
Â 
Oberyn's carelessness around The Mountain reaches horror-movie levels of stupidity and it sort of cheapens his death a little in my eyes.
Â 
Again, maybe re-reading the chapter will make me realize that this is just how it was portrayed on screen, but seeing it all play out (to my memory) more or less how it was on the page, I was struck by just how stupid it would be for a seasoned fighter like Oberyn to be so careless around Ser Gregor.
Â 
Don't get me wrong, thematically it all makes sense that his bloodlust and unquenched desire for vengeance is what does him in.Â  But it just seems like the way it played out required Oberyn to not just become blinded by his rage but actually flat out careless and stupid, on a level normally reserved for horror movie victims and members of House Stark.

Â 
Oberyn's carelessness would bother me less if it wasn't a moronic cliche shoved down our throats in every single fight sequence this season.
Â 
Polliver doesn't care about his friend dying a few feet behind him at Arya's hand because the Hound just has such an interesting face...
The Ironborn are no match for Ramsay as he slowly turns his back on his armed foes because, OMG, he has a magic key...
Karl instantly forgets about Jon Snow lying on the ground, despite having just been engaged in an intense fight with him...
Rorge doesn't care that the Hound just killed Biter for their attempt on his life. Â He's perfectly happy to stand there like a moron while Arya stabs him in the heart...

To their defense, I heavily doubt Rorge was expecting to get stabbed by a little girl, Karl had to his knowledge incapacitated Jon and had to deal with the stabber behind him, Ramsay is just plain creepy, would cause just about anybody to give pause.Â  I mean, fuck, he walks into the dungeon half naked covered in blood pre-fight.Â  Would you bum-rush that?Â  And as far as fighting the Hound, I'd never take my eyes off of an opponent like that, especially to watch some little girl fight.
Â 
Also, Oberyn had pretty much done in Gregor and practically pinned him to the ground with a spear.Â  He was worried that he'd die without confessing, so why not get a little closer?

Darkstar tried to kill Myrcella just like Jaime tried to kill Bran. Jaime is one of the most liked characters on the show now. I'm not saying Darkstar will end up a fan favorite but I don't think the Unsullied really care about attempted murder on a child if the character who did it is a likable one. Besides, the last thing Darkstar does in the series is that. Then he goes missing. It would be a complete shock to those just watching the show. I could easily see the showrunners building him up to be charismatic and interesting then throwing that curve ball at the end of Arianne's little journey. The only thing is, he'll most likely have far less screen time than Oberyn and no one will want to embrace someone like that so soon after Oberyn's death.Â

I have said this a thousand times but I would stand like six feet away and prod his testicles with my spear. It's not only a more effective method to get someone talking, but it'd keep him alive. It'd also feel really good to stab your sister's rapist in the balls.Â

Karl is understandable, he was just stabbed. The pain would make anyone lose their head. And it's not like he was a genius either.
Â 
Polliver is also kinda OK, I mean it's the friggin Hound, you can't expect anyone to have great awareness when facing such a ferocious opponent.
Â 
But yeah, Rorge standing there just waiting to be stabbed was stupid, and the entire scene of shirtless Ramsay thwarting a party of seasoned, heavily armored reavers with his knives and dogs is utterly ridiculous. Beric vs the Hound is still the best fight of the series and they failed to touch it in terms of quality this season.

Gotta remember Rorge is a pretty demented individual, and we can't ascribe the best logic and reasoning on him...it appeared it the show that he realized he wasn't going to kill the Hound, and was focused on not letting the Hound kill him at that moment. Â Not realizing the skinny girl would just calmly walk up and stab him in the heart. Â (side note - these on screen Arya kills are making me way too proud of her considering her circumstances - what a sick show GRRM).
Â 
Beric and the Hound was a fantastic fight - the spinning attacks with the flaming sword, close quarters, sufficiently grizzled and serious fighters - and then the wildly graphic kill shot - just fantastic. Beric's lines are also great in that scene, from the "you'll be fighting me" to his last line after he is resurrected. Â

3594	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-05	I think Pedro might even have made Oberyn more personable, still cocky and dangerous- but a guy that (if you didn't bring up his sister's death) you'd want to have a few drinks and a chat with. He made him seem pretty open minded and good-humored where Lannisters and Lannister bannermen weren't concerned. In the books he was also probably my favorite "supporting" character, tied with Bronn... but much like Bronn, he benefited greatly by being brought to life on screen by a great actor. Despite (or maybe even because of) how much they played up his sexuality. His clear love and affection for Ellaria and the playfulness between them really spotlighted how much of a, dare I say it, "loving" guy he could be, granted it's not quite as hard to love someone who gives you free reign to stick it to whomever you may desire. And that scene with Tyrion in the dungeon, before he tells him he would be his champion- now one of my favorite scenes in the entirety of the show.
Â 
As I've said in other threads, I knew what was coming- but I had gotten so re-attached to Oberyn that I still felt blindsided by the brutality and needlessness of his death. That scream from Ellaria, after beseeching him "not to leave her alone in this world", ughhhh.

3595	Blackfyre Gateau	2014-06-23	I have to confess to not really rating or paying much heed to the Red Viper when I first read A Storm of Swords. I had him pegged as an arrogant, exuberant hot head. I love his portrayal in the HBO series. Yes he still has his impulsiveness as an achilees heel, but he radiates the same kind of intelligence and deep-seated sense of justice that you get from Doran Martell by the end of ADWD.Â 
Â 
Pedro Pascal's performance was really quite something. I'm hoping they do as well with the Doran Martell casting next season.Â

3597	diaur	2014-06-06	Haha the best thing was when my boyfriend came home saying he talked to someone at work whose girlfriend read the books and he said they changed so much because in the book Oberyn was using a poisoned spear and he won but got disqualified because the poisoned spear was considered cheating. It was hilarious
3598	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-06-06	My unsullied husband is very worried about Tyrion's fate and hopes Jaime does something to save his brother.
3599	Moshroom	2014-06-06	My bf thought, this episode was kind of lame. As the duel started, he wasn't very excited and said it wasn't good, but as soon as Oberyn's head got smashed in, he was furious and didn't expect it. Now he's totally worried about Tyrion and says, if the show kills him, he's gonna stop watching..
3600	WesternOz	2014-06-06	I could barely contain my composure when a few days before the show aired an Unsullied friend said that she couldn't guess who would win the duel, but that knowing George R.R. Martin's style that she speculated that both would die.
3601	gotgrrrl	2014-06-06	Husband's reaction to Oberyn's death -- "the guy just couldn't let it go".Â  He also wondered what was to be gained by the Mountain's confession.Â  If the Mountain had said, "yes Tywin ordered me to kill Elia", what then?Â  War between the Lannisters and Dorne? I guess we'll never know...
Â 
He hopes that Tyrion will be able to talk his way out of his execution somehow or that Jaime will save him (I scoffed at this). Â 
Â 
He's pretty sure the Hound is toast and will die of an infection just like Drago.Â 
Â 
He's kind of bummed that it at least seems like both Tyrion and the Hound, his favs, are doomed.Â
3602	Plume	2014-06-06	Two of my colleagues are so worried for Tyrion. One is saying that he's going to die now it's "obvious"

3606	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-06	I got my aunt into this show really bad about two years ago since I lent her the first two seasons on DVD. I told her about Sean Bean getting his head cut off long before I even considered she would actually watch the show so that was ruined for her. Then I couldn't even enjoy her reaction to the Red Wedding because "The Rains of Castamere" was the first episode she watched out of all of season three so she ruined it for me.Â But this... this was going to be good, of all things. She was steadily watching every episode as soon as it aired and each week we would talk about it on the phone. I told her from the get go she was going to love this guy Oberyn and that he was one of my favorite characters from the books. We had a talk on the discussion he had with Tyrion in the dungeons and I explained his entire backstory in depth to her including the full story of Elia's death. I knew then on she was going to be very upset over his demise. Which I relished greatly...
Â 
"YES! He's going to kill every one of those evil Lannisters one by one!"
"Is Oberyn going to beat the Mountain?"
"WHY DON'T YOU EVER TELL ME THINGS?"
Â 
I myself was shocked by the brutality of his death, even as a book reader, hoping upon hopes that it would live up to the savagery in the books. So I knew this wasn't going to be pretty. She didn't pick up her phone for an entire day. When I finally got a hold of her...
Â 
Me: "Hey."
Her: "HEY! :D"Â 
Me: "Did you watch Game of Thrones?"
Her: "Yes... >:E"
Me: *uncontrollable, unintentional laughing episode"
Â 
She said she was "distraught" and every time I would try to sympathize on how messed up it was, I would just start laughing again ):
Â 
We're not on speaking terms at the moment because I won't tell her if Tyrion lives or if Gregor died.Â

As I said in other topics, my flatmate was really shocked and in fact covered her eyes during the who,e scene and we had to rewatch it. She had a hard time getting over it although she didn't particularly love Oberyn or anything, and although she says that she was expecting him to lose because this is GoT. She wishes Oberyn would stop being cocky and just kill him already.
Littlefinger is still one of her favourites characters and she even has kind of a crush on him, actually. She was also shocked at the wildlings' brutality as well and their slaughter of men and women, armed or not.

Â 
Well played! I did something similar to my dad, making sure he understood Oberyn's backstory completely so he would be fully involved in the combat not just for Tyrion's sake.
3610	lyanna_maria	2014-06-07	I've asked my best friend if he understand better now the break-up of Jon and Ygritte (which he was outrsged at) but he says he doesn't like or care about Jon anymore (so I guess he won't  like the next episode...)
He was convinced Oberyn would win because his agility, expertise and confidence would beat the Mountain's strenght. He maintains that he was right since "Oberyn did win the fight, he just got stupidly carried away by hs feelings in the end and fucked everything up". He says it was the most shocking scene of the show and that for him it hurted more than the Red Wedding. He didn't like that a man like Oberyn went that way, though.
He's not worried about Tyrion, he's sure he's going to survive.

3613	Gendrys Forge	2014-06-07	He figured the story is shifting towards arya and sansa more, and he pretty much nailed sansa's pawn to player story.Â  He thinks the hound has nothing left to live for now that he cant get money, has a bounty on his head and his brother/arch enemy is dead.Â  So he's going to take arya on a lannister killing spree.
3614	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-08	Copy and pasted from my facebook chat!
Â 



I honestly thought he would win, but it'll make a better Tyrion story now that he lost. So, Tyrion will escape. There is no way he gets to live in Kingslanding after everything that happened, even if LF comes back and was like, I killed Joffrey,here's how, and here's proof. However, there is no way that the show is going to kill him off.






I see someone helping him. In order of likelihood: Jaime, Spider, Sansa, Whore, Tywin. They will accomplish this in one of two ways, either a standard prison break, or a faked suicide/other death. Tywin is the least likely, but would be the most powerful. it would show that he actually does care about his family, and is tired of putting up with Cercei's shit. I don't think it would happen, but it could.









Â 



As for Sansa, it would give her a useful piece (her husband) for use in her diplomatic fuckery. And for Varys, I feel like he understands Tyrion's worth, and could benefit from having Tyrion alive on the outside of Kingslanding










Depending on how they do it, if it's a prison break type deal, people will be pissed, especially Cersei, and a party will be organized to hunt him down. if it's a fake his death deal, people will be disappointed, but start focusing on other things, and Cersei will be pissed, because she wanted to kill him herself



Â 



Tyrion could then go to 1 of 3 places. 1. The Vale, to see Sansa. 2. The wall. 3. Somewhere else that doesn't really matter, because it's about the journey, not the destination

Â 



or, if Varys frees him, wherever the fuck varys wants him to go XD








Some fun stuff here. haha
3615	SlowLoras	2014-06-08	Mr SlowLoras thinks Doran Martell and his crew are going to come over and crack heads in King's Landing. He also thinks Oberyn's spear was poisoned, citing the squire polishing the spearhead & Oberyn's reputation as his reasons.
Â 
He also thinks Sansa's going to screw over Littlefinger (but not in the way LF's hoping for) and that Jorah's going to travel south to join with Stannis's army.

He's not sure if Tyrion will die or not but can't think of a way he might survive. Oh, and he thinks the Hound will die of his infected wound and Arya will go to Braavos.
3616	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-08	One of my friends was freaking out after the episode. I told him ep. 9 was going to be 100% at the wall, and he said he doesn't give a shit about Jon or the wall, that Jon was probably just going to be heroic and save the day somehow and he doesn't give a shit xD. My other friend, who was quietly sitting in the corner, piped in saying he thinks Jaime will smuggle Tyrion out. How astute of him. They thought it was bullshit that the mountain died but Oberyn still lost. I told them it was a bit more complicated than that with the mountain. Arya laughing at her aunt dying was hilarious, and Sansa's transformation went over well, as did Missandei's disrobing. And they think Dany is dumb for giving in to Twyin's tricks
3617	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	General remarks:
-Absolutely HATE both Daenerys and Tywin
-Thought Oberyn's death was much worse than the Red Wedding
-Loved Arya's laughter and Sansa's transformation
Â 
Don't much care about the Wall being a big focus for episode nine, and they're even less excited to hear that it will be mostly battle. As one of my friends remarked, "the fight stuff is always so boring. KL is definitely the best part of the show, can't believe they would leave it out for a whole ep."
3618	Kungsmurfen	2014-06-08	I think this season has done a horrible job of setting up the wall fight.. I haven't heard any unsullied that are really excited to see what happens there.
Most peoples reaction to this episode was "eew" and "if Tyrion dies I quit watching" but there were a few that thought it was awesome.

Â 
Those are some pretty good predictions. Congrats to your Unsullied for keeping up with all the crazy characters and story lines.
Â 


[1] Mr SlowLoras thinks Doran Martell and his crew are going to come over and crack heads in King's Landing. He also thinks Oberyn's spear was poisoned, citing the squire polishing the spearhead & Oberyn's reputation as his reasons.
Â 
[2] He also thinks Sansa's going to screw over Littlefinger (but not in the way LF's hoping for) and that Jorah's going to travel south to join with Stannis's army.
Â 
[3] He's not sure if Tyrion will die or not but can't think of a way he might survive. Oh, and he thinks the Hound will die of his infected wound and Arya will go to Braavos.


Â 
1) Good to see that at least some Unsullied manage to deduce what happened to the Mountain based on what we saw/heard about Oberyn.
Â 
2) Jorah travelling south (from Meereen) to join up with Stannis (in Bravos/Dragonstone)?Â  Â I think the poster for next season should be a map of Westeros (and Essos).
Â 
3) Spot on regarding Sandor and Arya, I see.Â

I'm so impressed by your Unsullied, it seems that he/she really keeps track of, and also knows and understand, all the characters and the situation in general.
Â 
I'm worried that next episode will bore the Unsullied too, unless it's extremely good, because none of them seem very invested in that plot. My best friend not only is not interested, but he doesn't like Jon or his plot at all. I'm a bit disappointed too that none of my Unsullied guessed the poison thing.
3621	majgat	2014-06-09	Unsullied GF was only dissapointed with Oberyn's faith. I thought she was gonna go mental, because she really liked him and likes Tyrion very much. She wouldn't dare to guess how he's gonna escape.
Not that interested in the Wall plot. I hope it's good, because let's face it, the expectations are very low.
She now digs Sansa and believes her transformation. (my note: though Turner's acting might be convincing, I'm not convinced by the "sudden" change within the plot)
Thinks Missandei is hot piece of ass (I know:-).
Well, Arya was hilarious and pretty much doesn't have a place to go.

Â 
Oops. My error, not his
3623	Bird	2014-06-09	My friends have all but given up trying to predict what will happen but general comments were:
Â 
-- Sadness and surprise about Oberyn, they had just started to really appreciate his character. Concern about what becomes of Ellaria now.
-- Hope that Tyrion lives (of course, as does everyone) and that Jamie is the one who helps him. They think Tyrion will die but that this is to obvious; his death will be more of a shock to us (like Red Wedding).
-- Sansa and Arya join up and re-establish the Stark reign at the Vale, with the Hound as protector.Â 
Â 
It's fun that I know some of the answers to their comments but to others, we still have no idea! But, I can't say anything to them because if I say that I don't know Tyrion's fate then they know he at least lives through another 1 or 2 episodes. So I have to keep quiet.Â
3624	Dolorous Gabe	2014-06-12	My sister had a look of shocked horror on her face when The Mountain started eye-gouging Oberyn and her hands stayed over her face well beyond the end credits. She's still terrified that Tyrion is going to die. She wanted to know whether there are any major deaths so I told her there would likely be at least three major deaths (that was before the airing of Ep9). She thinks one might end up being Jaime because "they like killing people off who are going through a redemptive story arc".
Â 
My dad was like, "well that's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen on television!" - he prefers to just enjoy the show's ride and doesn't tend to follow the intricacies of the story. Occasionally I explain things because I think it would add to his enjoyment but he doesn't always seem receptive.
3625	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-06-21	I have a non-reader friend who loves it when I tell what's going to happen in advance. So she basically knows the key stuff that's going to happen in each episode.
That said, she still woke me up in the middle of the night to scream and shout how shocking and upsetting that ending was.
3626	Veltigar	2014-06-04	Let us continue
3627	RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon	2014-06-06	I aint gonna bother mentioning Beetles or LF's newfound idiocy but:
Â 
1) Where is the Shaveplate? Seriously how can you introduce him next season after Dany's been in Mereen for so long. If he's cut, why? I mean he is a seriously colourful character who will freshen up Dany's scenes. At the moment they are a handful of dull peops hanging around a temple. No culture of Mereen no learning or enaging with the populace, introducing the Shaveplate & his troops will be a great way of adding depth that simply isn't there at the moment.
Â 
2) As mentioned the watch have 100 odd against 100,000, it's just treating the audience like babies that don't understand against the odds unless its crazy odds.
Â 
3) Sansa's speech went on for way too long telling us things we already know before she got onto the crux of it. That could have been handled so much better and shorter to give us more time with the Mountain & the Viper who the episode should all of been about. 
Â 
We needed:
- Tywin's reaction to Red Viper being named as champion. Tywin maybe stating how they lose either way, no one punished for Joff's murder or a dead Prince of Dorne. Poss include Cersei's reaction
- Oberyn mentioning the Cersei - Ellaria marriage situation adding a bit more venom against Tywin, maybe mention the Myrcella plan.

I agree.Â  Currently re-reading Dance and the Merreen chapters are actually quite interesting.Â  Martin provides a lot of detail about the history and culture of Slavers Bay that we aren't getting at all in the show.Â  I'm hoping Merreen gets a bit more fleshed out next season and that they show the political and economic effects of Dany stopping the slave trade (although clearly there won't be a visit from Xaro as in the books).Â
3629	Theda Baratheon	2014-06-06	Beetle story took too long.
3630	Relic	2014-06-06	Ugh,  why do we have enough to call it nitpicking? It's as of the show is sooooo good that the only criticisms one could possibly level against it are of the petty and trite variety.
3631	Lady Sansa Stark	2014-06-06	Yes, that Beetle story was far too long. It was good, but far too long. A sort of last supper of Tyrion and Jaime could have been handled differently if you ask me. And I kinda liked the whole Sansa transformation, but seriously, are they really going to make Littlefinger that stupid and idiotic? Please. He started the War of the Five Kings, chaos is a ladder and all, but they will have us believe that he can't handle Sansa, at this point?

3633	The Emberheart	2014-06-06	I wonder if the beetle story is an inside joke, as a reference to GRRM himself. As a reaction to all those viewers who keep asking if GRRM keeps killing off so many characters merely for sport.

Â 
Â 
uh huh...
3636	Mad Monkey	2014-06-07	The thread does run the gamut from serious criticisms of the show's structure to complaining because Littlefinger said "your sister" instead of "only Cat". It's not like everything here is Serious Stuff, and most of the really major criticisms tend to get their own threads anyway -- this is more for things that really aren't that big of a deal, like the part where they write "KILL THE MASTERS" in English in Meereen -- kind of weird, but not really interesting enough to justify a whole thread.Â Yes, that Beetle story was far too long. It was good, but far too long. A sort of last supper of Tyrion and Jaime could have been handled differently if you ask me. And I kinda liked the whole Sansa transformation, but seriously, are they really going to make Littlefinger that stupid and idiotic? Please. He started the War of the Five Kings, chaos is a ladder and all, but they will have us believe that he can't handle Sansa, at this point?Honestly, the beetle story ran so long that I was worried they were going to push the duel off to the next episode and just end this episode with Tyrion being led out. I'm glad they didn't do that, but if they had summarized a bit more they probably could have spent more time on the duel.I'm not sure why people think that Littlefinger can't handle Sansa at this point. I haven't rewatched the episode but I honestly got the vibe that he was just trying to get into her head a little bit. Littlefinger's schemes still seem to be running, he is just trying to figure out how much he can rely on Sansa to play a part in them.

3637	mcmnky	2014-06-07	Should we assume Arya's whole storyline has been aborted? I don't see any plausible story line that does not have Sandor and Ayra going to LF in the Eyrie, and once there, how does she get out and to Braavos?Do the guards at the gate beleive the Hound has Arya Stark? Probably not, but they do know who he is, and the lords will interested in talking to him no matter who he is with.Lysa's death is actually better for Sandor and his plan to ransom Arya. Lysa had never met Arya and could easily beleive the Hound picked up some low born girl about Arya's age as a scam. LF will know Arya from Kings Landing. (Aside from Sansa certainly recognizing her sister.) He'll also not be interested serving the Lanister's ends and so won't turn Sandor in for the bounty.And the Hound will likely know this. "Lysa's dead? So who is lord of the Eyrie?" "Young Robert Arryn is lord." "Yes, but he's a child. Who is in charge?" "Lord Baelish is regent." "Oh great, he'll know Arya. And I know his reputation as master of coin; he'll have plenty of gold for ransom. Off we go."How else could the situation play out? Sandor just shrugs his shoulders and walks away?
3638	Theda Baratheon	2014-06-07	Sandor wouldnt walk away from seeing Sansa again would he...
3639	Woman of War	2014-06-08	Sansa is a different Sansa, she has a position of her own now. Would she even want to leave with Sandor, as much as he might want to "save" her, and return to being nothing but someone's little bird?
Actually, far more important, I believe for plot's purpose they will never meet face to face since then the whole complicated Sansa/Arya relationship would have to be brought up and the moment is not there within the plot yet.
3640	Floop	2014-06-08	Didn't care about most of what happened in the episode.
Â 
The stuff in Essos - didn't care. If they wrote Dany off the show tomorrow, I wouldn't complain.
Â 
Didn't care about what was happening in Moletown with Gilly and Ygritte or at the wall with Samwell as a result. I just don't have an investment in any of those characters and the showdown at the wall is moving along at a frustratingly slow pace. It feels like things are being painfully stretched out right now.
Â 
The stuff in the Eyrie - didn't care. I love Baelish and all that he is able to accomplish, but hate the new moustache-twirling depiction of him. I understand that Sansa is being expanded into more than just a human pinata, but it's still hard to care about her right now. I would have rather seen a charming Baelish outsmart the guests than Sansa, but charming Baelish has been replaced by blantantly diabolical Baelish, so I guess that's out of the question anyway.
Â 
Didn't care about Oberyn or the replacement Mountain either. Oberyn barely made an impression on me before he died in the book, and the show's expanded depiction of him didn't change my overall feeling that he was a character that was obviously invented to do trial by combat for Tyrion and little else, and is therefore not worth being invested in. I guess that one is more of a complaint about the book.
Â 
You know what didn't bother me? The stuff with Tyrion and Jaime, including the beetle speech, with the exception of the insulting impersonation of a handicapped child. I don't care if it was too short, too long, too invented, or whatever else, at least it was between two characters that I actually care about.

WTF was the point in the drivel?Â
3642	Stormlandian	2014-06-02	Was anyone else kind of hoping Yara to be with the ironborn at Moat Cailin? Â I didn't expect her to die with the rest of the ironborn, but I was at least hoping for an appearance. Â I feel like the ironborn plot has been lacking this year. Â We still haven't even seen/heard about Balon's Death!!!
3643	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-06-06	I am confused about her plot timing and where or how she has been traveling for sure.
3644	HairGrowsBack	2014-06-06	She pulled a Gendry and is still rowing somewhere between the Dreadfort and Pyke.
3645	Hippocras	2014-06-06	Was anyone else kind of hoping Yara to be with the ironborn at Moat Cailin?

Â 
Balon's gonna die in episode 10, Euron will be mentioned as being back, but will not be shown (I don't think he was cast for this season). Remeber, Euron appeared the day after Balon died, so the two things need to happen together on the show.
Â 
So Yarra will be shown in episode 10 back in Pyke for her father's death.
3646	The_Turncloak	2014-06-06	I didn't think she would be at Moat Cailin but I'm disappointed about how they're treating the Ironborn too.
I'm afraid we're not even going to see the Euron/Victarion relationship if they keep ignoring them like this and that they're going to melt them both into an only character (no Kingsmoot, maybe a little conflict with Asha/Yara about the heirloom and then VictEuron will go east as Victarion does in the books). I really hope they keep both Euron and Victarion but if they keep treating the Ironborn like they are some sort of filler I don't think that's going to happen.
3647	Hippocras	2014-06-06	I think the opposite. The Ironborn story just doesn't do much in the current part of the timeline. The show went out of their way, in fact, to give Yarra something to do this season so she would not be forgotten. The Dreadfort scene was otherwise not necessary - it was included to remind show viewers about the Ironborn.
Â 
If Yarra had been at Moat Cailin she would have died, so be glad.
Â 
Their storyline ramps up when Euron arrives, and that could not be included this season,Â  but will be there next season. Balon's death in episode 10 will set it up.

3650	boojam	2014-06-06	I am confused about her plot timing and where or how she has been traveling for sure.Well by adaptation standards it's lucky we even see Balon and (Asha) Yara Greyjoy, since they hardly appear on the page in the first three books.George does not really pick up the Greyjoys until Feast.I give it to D&D they, squeaked them in in Season 2 and 3, and invented a story of Yara in season 4.I wonder if we even see they in S4E10 ... Gemma sure has had little screen time.Now Theon does appear in GOT and Clash but I don't think at all in SoS.Lot of Greyjoy stuff , sort of, in Feast, but no Theon, he's not back till Dance.So the show runner's have been trying to keep the Greyjoys somewhere in the audience awareness.I hope this is a fore shadowing that the crazy crew of Asha's uncles will become a new thread in the show, they do perk things up.I wonder if D&D have ever explained their , shall we say, re-imagining of the Grejoys , on Pyke?They are a 'pirate-like' lot in GRRM's books , but on the show they opted for a Sea-Salt-flinty type of Pirate-Viking spin.I think to make them even more distinct than they are in the books.Purposely homely-fying Gemma Whelan as they did Gwendoline Christie , since Gemma is attractive enough to have been outfitted as GRRM's version, but they wanted that 'hard-bitten' look.I am used to it now , if not the character name!

Â 
Which is why YarAsha is probably heading back to Pyke.

3659	Hippocras	2014-06-08	I predict she will have a small scene with her father tonight, probably discussing Theon's state, to remind viewers the IB exist.
Then next week, Balon will die, leaving the succession as a cliffhanger for next season. The Kingsmoot will be very early in season 5, probably the very first episode.

If that is were they are filming I think its just the other side of Ballintoy Harbour.
I had expected them to use the Giants Causeway for the Kingsmoot.

3662	Stormlandian	2014-06-13	I was really hoping for this:
Â 
That Yara would have retreated to Moat Cailin (probably the nearest Ironborn stronghold) after her failed raid of the Dreadfort. Â She would then tell all of the Ironborn how Theon was "dead", before receiving a raven/news about Balon's death and her uncle's arrival at Pyke. Â She would then of course flee back to Pyke before Theon and the Bolton's show up. Â Imagine all of the Ironborn's confusion when "Theon" shows up after Yara told them all he had died. Â  
Â 
But instead we got...... nothing. Â Yara has been in ONE freaking episode this whole season.

Well, that does reduce the chances of seeing her.
On the other hand I am not sure there is a scene that they could show there that would have any useful information. If all she is going to do this episode is learn of her father's death it doesn't really need any reminder information.
Did anyone else get the impression from that, that the Hound fight will be against Vale knights? He told them who he was...

3666	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-06-03	Can someone help me understand Jorah's pardon? Â Wasn't he already pardoned back in Season 1 just before the wine merchant's attempt on Dany's life? Â So my questions are:
Â 
1) Was he being pardoned for a second time and, if so, what where his crimes subsequent to the first pardon?
2) Does the Hand even have the authority to issue a royal pardon?
3) If this recent pardon was simply a reissuance of the original pardon-
Â Â  a] How did Tywin even know about the original pardon?
Â Â  b] Since the original pardon produced no effect whatsoever, what possibly expectation would he have for reissuing it?
4) Why does Dany care so much about an alleged betrayal which occurred years ago and basically had no ramifications?
5) Were her marriage and pregnancy supposed to be secrets? (if so, the big wedding ceremony was a pretty stupid idea...)
6) Doesn't the fact that Jorah was pardoned many years ago and still chose to remain by Dany's side speak to his devotion to her?
Â 
Â
3667	HTN02	2014-06-06	Tywin resend that royal pardon to barristan, exactly hoping that dany would do what she does: send away a valuable advisor
Â 
so:
1) nope, still the same pardon
2) yes, he has every authorithy the king has, as long as the king doesnt overrule him on something.
3) a; Varys probably b; check the council scene in laws of gods and men; they talk about this. at the end of the scene, Tywin asksÂ commands Mace to fetch quill and paper...
4) its an emotional 16 year old girl? and its not years ago, i think its about a year in real life.
5) Her marriage, no. but having the enemy king knowing you are pregnant before your husband, i can see the problem in that. plus, it started attempts on her life. added with the 16 year old girl thing again.
6) it does, but dany doesnt seem to have a eye for it.
3668	SynthFG	2014-06-06	5) Were her marriage and pregnancy supposed to be secrets? (if so, the big wedding ceremony was a pretty stupid idea...)
Â 
Her pregnancy was what triggered the attempt on her life,Â 
And remember she had been on the run from RobertsÂ assassin'sÂ (Real and Imagined) for all of her life,Â 
Jorah hadÂ essentiallyÂ been betraying her to her childhood monstersÂ

3670	zaphodbrx	2014-06-06	Yea this xerox copy thing is really starting to annoy me.

3672	dbunting	2014-06-06	Damn, missed the Yara copy too!I don't think she would have reacted that way if he had come to her after the wine merchant and confessed, then pledged his loyalty to her.
3673	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-06	I have to admit, I'm not sure I remembered that Balon had burnt the letter Asha/Yara later read to her men before the Theon rescue attempt.
Â 
More importantly than whether or not there are lots of easily obtained carbon copies of important paperwork throughout the Realm, I'm wondering how Tywin's copy of the pardon reached Mereen almost as fast as a FAX would get there? Â
3674	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-06-06	Â 

Can someone help me understand Jorah's pardon? Â Wasn't he already pardoned back in Season 1 just before the wine merchant's attempt on Dany's life? Â So my questions are:
Â 
1) Was he being pardoned for a second time and, if so, what where his crimes subsequent to the first pardon?
2) Does the Hand even have the authority to issue a royal pardon?
3) If this recent pardon was simply a reissuance of the original pardon-
Â Â  a] How did Tywin even know about the original pardon?
Â Â  b] Since the original pardon produced no effect whatsoever, what possibly expectation would he have for reissuing it?
4) Why does Dany care so much about an alleged betrayal which occurred years ago and basically had no ramifications?
5) Were her marriage and pregnancy supposed to be secrets? (if so, the big wedding ceremony was a pretty stupid idea...)
6) Doesn't the fact that Jorah was pardoned many years ago and still chose to remain by Dany's side speak to his devotion to her?
Â 
Â 

Â 


Â Â Â  This was shown a couple episodes ago, when Tywin asked Mace to get him some paper and a quill. That's what he was doing then, is forging a pardon from Robert Baratheon. He reissued it for the exact effect that it had: tearing Dany's group apart. He probably gave instructions for it to be handed to Selmy instead of Jorah. He would easily know about the initial pardon from Varys. From Dany's standpoint, she doesn't know that Jorah was already pardoned once before. That's the point. As far as she knows, this is his first pardon, just finally reaching him. So she had no reason to know he was still devoted.

3675	fangirl000	2014-06-06	5) Were her marriage and pregnancy supposed to be secrets? (if so, the big wedding ceremony was a pretty stupid idea...)
Â 
Her pregnancy was what triggered the attempt on her life,Â 
And remember she had been on the run from RobertsÂ assassin'sÂ (Real and Imagined) for all of her life,Â 
Jorah hadÂ essentiallyÂ been betraying her to her childhood monstersÂ 


Â 
The attempt on her life was what finally convinced Drogo to head to Westeros and win her - and their child - the throne. Â And in traveling to Westeros, Drogo and Rhaego were killed.Â Dany is putting all those consequences on Jorah's shoulders.

Â Â Â  It would be normal for people to send more than one copy of important letters to ensure it reaches its destination, but I agree, since Ramsey's letter was attached to a box, it was unusual that there was a second copy. My guess is that D&D would explain this by saying that Ramsey sent an extra letter in case the one that was suppose to come with the box got lost.
Â 


Apparently they had carbon copies of pardons in Westeros.


Â They often make more than one copy and sent more than one raven/messenger to ensure the information reaches its destination. I think there is a scene in the novels where 3 copies of an important letter are sent.

Â 
4) It did have ramifications. Learning about her pregnancy led to Robert ordering an assassination attempt, which lead to Drogo preparing to head to Westeros, which led to the raid on the Lazareen (slaves grab), which led to MMD and eventually the deaths of Drogo and Rhaego.
Â 
5) Her marriage probably not, but her pregnancy? Yes.
Â

Â 
I hadn't noticed that about Ramsay's letter to the Greyjoys! Kind of hilarious in hindsightÂ  
As for the xerox pardon: Does anybody know what happened to the original pardon that was handed to Jorah? Did he destroy it? Did Varys' little birds get it back somehow? Personally, I think the new pardon was a forgery, written by Tywin. Remember that it's not usually the king who writes those things - it's his Hand. The king only signs and stamps it and I'm pretty sure they have Robert's seal and some document with his signature lying around the read keep, making it very easy to forge a pardon.

Pretty much this. Â Whether it is right or not, Jorah is to blame in her eyes - also by staying loyal to the people who killed her family.
3679	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-06	I rewatched the scene with Balon getting the "Theon is in the box" letter. He does not burn it, he only sits near the fire and screws the letter in his hands.

The little bird specifically called to Lord Barristan, so that looks to be true - that he was intended to receive it, with Tywin knowing how he would react and what he would do

Â 
I suppose that's rather my point. Â If the Usurper had been trying to kill her her entire life then the information about her pregnancy didn't trigger anything. Â It would be one thing had she been trying to keep her pregnancy a secret, but since it was public information it's not as though Robert wouldn't have learned about it in due time without Jorah's help.
Â 
Dany mentions that the pardon was signed by Robert during the year that she and Jorah met, so if she weren't a complete moron she'd probably wonder why it took so long to arrive and why it came to Selmy and not Mormont. Â If she assumes that this is the first time that Jorah is learning of the pardon I suppose it legitimizes her discontentment somewhat.
Â 
I still don't understand how Tywin would know that (1)Â Dany and Semly had no prior knowledge of the original pardon, (2) Dany would respond to it so completely irrationally (nevermind why someone immature enough to respond that irrationally would be considered any type of threat in Westeros - I guess "dragons"), and (3) why Jorah would be the target of his scheme in the first place.
Â 
What exactly does removing Mormont from the equation accomplish for Tywin? Â And come to think of it, how does Tywin even know that Selmy has joined up with Dany (let alone that he'll respond to the pardon as irrationally as the teenage girl)?

Â Â  Robert kept his eye on Dany for awhile, but the knowledge of her pregnancy was what accelerated him into action at that point. That's what led to the scene with Ned leaving.Â 
Â  Considering the message had to pass the narrow sea and then make its way to Slaver's Bay, I don't think it would be that unusual for a message to get delayed, especially if delays occurred en route. The ships that are carrying the messages don't usually care about the messages aboard, so if something comes up causing them to change course instead of heading straight to Essos, messages could be delayed many months or longer. Sometimes ships will sink or messengers will be killed. In their time period, I think they would get used to receiving messages extremely late.
Â Â  Tywin had nothing to lose. If Dany already knew about the original pardon, then the only thing he lost was a piece of paper and his time writing the forgery. But if Dany didn't already know, then he had an opportunity to estrange her from Mormont, who was acting as a seasoned advisor to her. Why wouldn't he try to do that? In addition, as a bonus, it creates a chance that Mormont might come back to King's Landing and tell them every single detail of what Dany has been up to and is planning.
As for why Dany would act so harshly? From her perspective, Mormont may have been acting as a spy right up until the present time. The fact that he wasn't honest with her earlier was his downfall.
Â

3684	Titan	2014-06-07	Is this pardon business really that hard to grasp??? It seems freakin' obvious to me.
Â

Â It would be one thing had she been trying to keep her pregnancy a secret, but since it was public information it's not as though Robert wouldn't have learned about it in due time without Jorah's help.

Â 
Word would have reached Robert eventually, but Dany was faaar away by this point in the middle of the Dothraki sea. Remember that Jorah rode to Qohor to send word as soon as he found out, to make sure the info got to Varys/Robert ASAP. Yes, Robert already wanted Dany dead, but after finding out that she was pregnant, he became even more desperate to kill her.
Â 

Dany mentions that the pardon was signed by Robert during the year that she and Jorah met, so if she weren't a complete moron she'd probably wonder why it took so long to arrive and why it came to Selmy and not Mormont. Â If she assumes that this is the first time that Jorah is learning of the pardon I suppose it legitimizes her discontentment somewhat.

Â 
Of course she realizes that it was sent to sow discord, since it was sent to Selmy - not Mormont. But once she knows that he has betrayed her, she has to do *something* about it. Tywin gambled on the fact that Mormont would not have told her.Â 
Â 


I still don't understand how Tywin would know that (1)Â Dany and Semly had no prior knowledge of the original pardon, (2) Dany would respond to it so completely irrationally (nevermind why someone immature enough to respond that irrationally would be considered any type of threat in Westeros - I guess "dragons"), and (3) why Jorah would be the target of his scheme in the first place.

Â 
It's a gamble from Tywin, sure. The worst possible outcome is that Dany has already forgiven Mormont. The best possible outcome is that this weakens Dany by forcing her to kill or remove one of her trusted advisers. But all it cost him was "postage", so why the heck shouldn't he?
Â 
What is it that you don't understand?
Â 
------------------
Â 
And BTW, this was probably not a forgery. Just a copy that was made at the time the pardon was issued by Robert. It seems quite logical that many copies of royal decrees and messages would be made. Tywin could simply at the meeting written an order for the royal archivist to dig up a copy of the pardon.

3685	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-08	Yup, very sad. Jorah was actually Dany's enemy when they first met, because spying on her and Viserys. If he betrayed anyone, it was the Iron Throne, because he turned his back on them to protect and serve her for real.
Â 
However, Dany does not see it this way.
Â 
Actually, I think the real story is Dany most of all hated knowing Jorah loved her. That was the real friendship-poison, and this is a handy excuse to get rid of him.
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â Sending the pardon to Selmy had a fair chance of producing the desired effect.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Yup. Tywin is good at treachery. That "pardon" message went exactly where it was supposed to go - namely to to Jorah directly.

Â 
I'm not 100% sold on this. She's deeply conflicted in the books. It's clear that she loves Jorah, it's just not the same kind of love he has for her - it's love without the desire, if you like. She thinks of him as her bear, and she does entertain the idea of that kind of relationship with him (though ultimately concludes that she doesn't want it.)
Â 
Assuming Jorah never tried to put the moves on her again, I think Dany might have been fine with keeping things as they were. This goes double for the show, where Jorah's never actually made a move on her.

3689	OnlyOne	2014-06-08	He wasn't pardoned for a second time. His original crimes were selling people into slavery to appease his wife and he brought shame upon his house-hence Mormont Sr. Gives the family sword to Jon Snow. He did betray her and decided to save her from the poisoned wine after he had started falling for her. This was a huge betrayal.

Â They didn't replace the Dreadfort with Moat Cailin. It was Moat Cailin that Theon claimed back for the Boltons in the novels as well.

He's talking about the intro to the show where all the locations of that episode are shown on the map. The Dreadfort was replaced with Moat Cailin. I was also wondering the same thing. With all the cuts they do, why would they even introduce a new location and have it CGI rendered just to show the Unsullied once? It doesn't seem like something they'd do. Before this season started, I was seriously wondering if they'd even include Braavos since Arya is the only character who actually goes there in the books. But I guess to compensate for that, they sent Stannis there beforehand. I find it very odd since I don't think they ever once mentioned the importance of Moat Cailin in the show. That's how the Starks held the north for thousands of years. It's a key fortress that was treated as a run of the mill castle. They go through this big effort to capture it and then it's off to Winterfell in the blink of an eye. And Robb was supposed to go there in season one during his march south but most of his scenes took place at random encampments instead. Up until this point I thought it wasn't important but I'm starting to think otherwise.

The Ironborn were holding a castle in a foreign land being besieged by Roose Boltons force from the south since after the Red Wedding till Theons arrival. They would have little to no supplies which leads to either starvation or eating of things you shouldn't, like rats, that cause disease.

Yeh rats can carry disease it's true, the plague is a good example, but they just carry the disease though, they don't create it. And it's unlikely that sort of disease would be at Moat Cailin.

Â 
Didn't like how Arya was outright revealed. As if the guards are just going to let them go after that, and they are most certainly going to tell Baelish which opens a whole can of worms.Â 
Â 
Didn't like how they didn't rewrite the duel so Oberyn doesn't dieÂ

This is really nitpicky but i wish they said 'first i killed her screaming whelp, then i raped her, then i smashed her fucking head in, like this". I thought the delivery was a bit off. Only niggled me on second watch because i was too busy despairing on my first.

Beetles - now I am starting to understand what that dialoque meant, but still, I would have placed it sooner in the episode. The way they did it had me freaked out about the time left for the duel.
Greyworm and Mel - I just don't care about them
that guard at the gate said Lysa died 3 days ago....so in 3 days, the lords of the Vale got message about her death, had time to make their way to the Eyrie, hear LF and Sansa out and make their decisions? seems like too short a time for me...
Thank Gods attack on the Wall isÂ  in next episode. They've been drawing it out for far too long. Mance moves at a snail pace and I am afraid that the unsullied viewers lost interest in this storyline already.
3715	Enmity	2014-06-02	-Missendei/Grey Worm

-Littlefinger being put into Sansa's hands
Â 
-Arya and the Hound turning up at the bloody gate, how the hell is that going to work? If they go back without an opposing force from the Vale that's just horrible writing.
Â 
-Beetle convo went on for too long
Â 
-Dany scenes were horrible as usual
Â 
-Jaime smirking at every shot in the duel, the fuck is so funny?
Â 
-Tywin sentencing Tyrion to death. Should have just left it with silence like the books
Â 
-Tyrions fucked up expression at the end was just confusing as hell. It looks like someone took candy away from him.

Hahaha, I was going to start this thread and name it The Beetle Edition if you hadn't beat me to it.Â  WTF?Â  I actually find the beetle thing to be bigger than a nitpick, but I digress.Â  Some scene needed to give and go to give us a bit of the Tyrion and Oberyn prefight stuff.Â 
Â 
Beatles, not beetles.......ughhhhhhhhhhhh.Â 


Â 
I think it was bigger than a nitpick too (it was downright problematic). My only guess is Tyrion's going to mention his cousin's name instead of Moon Boy to Jaime in E10. According to the "inside the episode," the beetle moment was Tyrion's way of being like, "man, what does it all mean?" I feel there were probably better ways to get that across.
Â 
Also, very small nitpick, but in the tavern when the prostitute was burping a song, and the guy guessed Rains of Castamere, and then was told to guess again, the other guy immediately was like "Bear and the Maiden Fair!" And all I could think was "oh, I know what song--the only other one in Westeros!" It's not like it would have confused audience members if someone had shouted out "Ballad of Danny" or something. The scene wasn't super important.Â 
Â 
Sorry, the music has been my nitpick all season long.

Yes! I was literally coming onto this thread to say that. When I was watching the scene I'm like "well yeah no shit, there's only one other song in this world apparently."Â

Â 
I even understood that and other angles of the 'beetle barding' but I still spent most of that scene watching the clock, rolling my eyes at the times and places where D&D feel the need to try and 'write,' and bitching that even with all that......it was going on waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long.
Â 
And LOL at the only other song in Westeros.Â  My dumb ass was actually shouting out for The Dornishman's Wife and hoping it might come up.Â  I never learn do I?Â  Or........is it that I always manage a bit of optimism?Â
3719	Greg1	2014-06-02	1- Littlefinger's "bad guy" voice. Â It still bothers me that they think we're so stupid we can't follow his arc without his voice become dark and rough.
Â 
2- Arya and and the Hound showing up at the Eyrie. Â And, of course, Arya's laugh. Â
3720	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-02	Not feeling Moles Town at all. When that woman started being nasty to Gilly I thought it was a bit shit. What? Every single person regardless of station is a complete twat to everyone?
Would have liked some live flaying at the moat but it's enough what was there.

3724	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	While I do like the angle of the Grey Worm and Missandei situation, I didn't think this episode was the best place for it.Â  Some of their scenes this week rank as a choice of something that could have been given up for MORE OBERYN!!Â Â Â 
Â 
Also, they are not siblings in the books, but Missandei does have two brothers, one is killed in the Sons of the Harpy storyline, one is a commander of one of the companies of free men, I believe.Â
3725	The Daly Raven	2014-06-02	As much as I enjoyed Sophie's monologue and appreciate the showrunners are trying to speed up her transition from pawn to player, I felt they did Litttle finger a great disservice by placing him entirely in her mercy as if he had no real plan to consolidate his control of the Eyrie. At this point in the books Littlefinger is at his most devious and overtly powerful position manipulating the Lords Declarent- not expecting to be removed as Lord Protector.
Â 
Jorah begging for forgiveness was also a subtle yet significant scene change. Whilst book Dany desperately wanted to forgive him, she felt his stubborn refusal to admit he was wrong could not be overlooked without undermining her authority. In the show, however, the ever haughty Emilia Clarke dismissed him far more ruthlessly as he pleaded for mercy. Of late I have found show Dany to be very irksome, she seems entirely lacking of any warmth or vulnerability and far too black and white in the way she interacts with people.Â

To be fair, Daenerys as a character does have a very black and white view of the world too.
3727	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	Oh Missendai and Grey worm. Lol

Â 
No, not that we know of. She has two Unsullied brothers, one of whom is Mossador (he was killed), but I don't think Grey Worm is the other. Not that it really matters; she was also 6 in the books. I do wonder if they're setting up Grey Worm to die, though.
3728	Croyd	2014-06-02	Last nights episode is the last straw. The show has been on a steady decline since season 1 and last night's episiode made me feel stupider after watching it.

GreyWorm /Missendie, I was 10 seconds from turning the show off but the scene ended.
Why is Dany doing Missande's hair? Dany's the Queen FFS.

I would have REALLY liked to see maybe a little Red Viper and his paramour together alone before the fight, just the two of them, no orgies, since it's Pedro Pascal's exit.
Â 
I actually like the GW and Missandei storyline, but they could have put that somewhere else not in this episode.
Â 
I must the only one who was underwhelmed by the fight scene, although Pascal's acrobatics were cool. Â And the new Mountain just doesn't do it for me really.
Â 
Is Sansa auditioning to be the new Maleficient? Â That was very strange.

The wildlings do raid all the time though.... We only just heard about it in the books. The show is really showing us how messed up it is. One of the few things I applaud them for, showing that relatively likable characters like Tormund and Ygritte are still violent killers.

3734	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-06-02	All in all I really liked this episode. There were only 2 things that bothered me:
- Sansa - I thought her acting was phenomenal, absolutely loved the wardrobe change  but  is she getting into LF perverted come ons?  GROSS 
- Missendei & Grey Worm - the romance doesn't bother me, it's here nor there. What bothers me is Missendei covers herself when she catches GW looking at her, acts like she is traumatized over it when talking to Dany about it  then  tells GW she is glad her saw her. All the while her mouth is saying "I'm glad you saw me" her face is saying "You kinda freak me out." I think she could've smiled at him or something at the end. It felt very contradictory.

3735	Veltigar	2014-06-02	It's strange, on the one hand I found it a good episode. But when I pause to think about it all, than it just falls flat.
Â 
1) The fight... I mean there was no preparation at all. It was just fucking there... with no build up at all. Usually D&D can't be pried away from KL even when you put a gun to their heads and now, when there is actually something major going down they just... drop in at the spot without build up? At all?
Â 
2) The fact that the Mountain was speared to the gut, but was still able to crush Oberyn bothered me immensely. He should have pulled Oberyn top of him like he did in the books, not the other way around.
Â 
3) The fucking beetles scene
Â 
4) Everything GW and Missandei oriented. I guess it's nice we see Missandei's goodies, but this was just lame fucking filler. Say what you will about Craster's keep, but at least there were some people killing each other to make it interesting.
Â 
5) The part about the song is really annoying too. No sense of worldbuilding
Â 
6) Moat Caillin. It just looked of, I mean it was just a weak castle on a hill somewhere in the plains. No mention of crannogmen, no bogs, no snakes. It didn't look like the swamp from the books. The Ironborn were also boring (and I say this as a big Ironborn fan), the book was superior in every freaking way!
Â 
7) Roose and Ramsay. The acting was fine and all, but was I the only one who expected the Bolton version of Simba and Mufassa's conversation in the beginning of the Lion KinG?
Â 
8) Again about the fight scene... It was just cheap. I mean the quick cuts and the twirls and shit, we get it, Pedro is a fine actor but not a stuntman. But it was so glaringly obvious that it wasn't him that did those supercool moves. If D&D really think that this is the best fight scene they ever done, than they are just plain pathetic. It just annoys the crap out of me that Ned Stark vs. Jaime Lannister is still the best fight this show ever had
Â 
Things I did like:
Â 
1) Sansa's storyline. Sure hate on the dress, but I liked her speech (eventhough it did a disservice to LF) and Sophie did a very good job.
2) Liked the guy that played Royce. Not exactly the intimidating specimen from the books, but he acted very good.

Â 
These are my main concerns, too.
Â 
Especially LF being unprepared at the questioning. BookLF is way too smart to be caught like that and he wouldn't trust Sansa with his life without a backup plan. In the books, he has Marillion blamed for the assassination, which is clearly more believable than Lysa just deciding to take a dip through the Moon Door, but even if BookLF wanted to blame it on suicide, he wouldn't have been so careless, IMO. In the show, he's almost surprised that the Lords of the Vale wanted to question Sansa, like he didn't foresee that, but that's just not LF.

Â 
Book!LF's plan is contingent on the Vale Lords not seeing through a bottle of hair dye. He's careless in the books as well, just about different things. The show is speeding this up, so they're moving his missteps around. But I don't think it's changing the nature of his character too much.
3743	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	I don't remember the book version of Arya and the Hound finding out Lysa was dead...but the show having them literally at the gates and she says she's Arya Stark....

Â 
Meh, by changing that he's at least sort of formed as a character. It's not as if there's too much to ruin from the books: he's really just another unsullied but with a name and a position. It was arguably a bit pointless since it was time that could've been spent elsewhere, but it doesn't really ruin the character since there isn't a lot to ruin.

Well Show!Jon knows Bran is alive, Show!Brienne knows Arya is alive, so maybe Show!Sansa will know Arya is alive too? It wouldn't be the biggest change, but one I don't see as being necessary.

Â 
Jorah's pardon...just idiotic. Why didn't he say it was forged? And why would anyone bother to arrange it for this piece of paper to travel halfway around the world just to screw over Jorah?
Â 
Missandrei and Grey Worm...so dumb. Yeah, it was so worth it for Grey Worm to get castrated and brainwashed just to be able to ogle and chat with a hot woman 20 years later, that makes total sense...

LOL, only I guess if you don't pay attention, because if Sansa and LF knew Arya was alive they would go get her. Â Yes, it's not a big thing, just one more example of the show setting up situations that only work in the moment and have actually large plot ramifications which are then summarily ignored. Â

Â 
I'm trying to remember exactly where it happened (maybe that village The Hound and Arya worked at? or the Inn?) but I think I recall something about Arya thinking how The Hound's dream of selling her to Lady Lysa dies maybe at the foothills to the Vale, proabably near the Inn?Â  Then, he may be back to the idea of The Blackfish and Riverrun?Â  Something like that, and Arya is thinking how she was always trying for Riverrun and never makes it?Â 
Â 
I'm going to guess that the show will have Arya and The Hound leave, or get into a fight with the guards, or both......and never believe that it was Arya.Â  But, I suppose this will also add to the rumors, just like the books, about them being together before she again cannot be found?Â  Maybe, though, it might make too much sense for them, there's always that concern.Â  LOL

Â 
Yeah I'd definitely agree with that part. Was kind of watching it thinking, "this is nice and that, but what's the point?" It was time that should've gone to KL to build up to the battle, with reactions to the fact that it was the Viper who was fighting for Tyrion since that was a pretty important point for people like Tywin and the like.
Â 
Although I didn't really mind Grey Worm the characters plot point though. As I say, it's a development on a character who's undeveloped in the books and is just there so the unsullied have someone with a name who leads them.

yeah, i like the grey worm, missandrei storyline, i like that she's not another savant genius child but an adult, but THIS was not the episode for a long drawn out segment.
3754	Tyrion4President	2014-06-02	Messandi and Grey Worm scene was pointless but I still found the "pillars and stones" line pretty funny. I was expecting Messandi to blurt out "Are you missing both your pillar and stones?" and Grey Worm responding "all I have is a grey worm"
3755	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	I'm wondering, do we even know for sure that they said;Â  Pillar and Stones?Â  I thought it might have been pillow and stones, like LF to Varys on the show and, iirc, that's the phrase used in the books?Â  Now, I'm not even sure about any of it, LOLÂ
3756	PatrickStormborn	2014-06-02	I think the show has officially jumped the shark.
Missandei/Grey Worm. I can't even put into words how cringeworthy everything was.
Dany is braiding her handmaiden's hair now??? Ok. Glad to see she's having such a great time of being queen that she can just act like a handmaid.
Why was Missandei even bathing in a lake?Â 
Show-Missandei isn't even close to being as intelligent as book-Missandei, despite being an adult. WTF?
Jorah's exile was way too rushed, which is ridiculous considering all the time they've had this season to build up to it. He was also completely whitewashed, and in true D&D style they chose to focus on his mainpain instead of Daenerys, who just found out she was betrayed by her only friend.
The beetle scene...
Whose idea was it to have the Arya scene end with her laughing? It was so unconvincing and awkward to watch. And despite the Hound being wanted by the crown, he just reveals himself to the guards? And there's not even a follow-up scene dealing with the repercussions of this?
Sansa becoming Maleficent. Lol what even.
Pedro Pascal, Indira Varma and Lena Headey (despite having no lines) saved the episode tbh. Nikolaj and Peter were terrible. It felt like they were playing completely different characters.

I think Dany was going for construction terms (sounded like pillar). I think Ygritte's made the most sense (bone and stones), but whatever. Interesting Dany was suddenly modest about the whole thing.

3759	AZAXD	2014-06-02	Really hoping Grey Worm and Missandei comes into play somehow... not writing it off just yet - it's like I wondered why they bothered with Gilly in Mole's Town but this episode proved to me it kind of was a good way to put the Town out there and make sure people know it's close before the Wildling attack. So maybe it'll matter later. I guess I can't be too mad at something that gave us naked Nathalie Emmanuel!
Â 
Sansa's dress looked like some poorly done Hunger Games cosplay of one of Katniss' Mockingjay (almost a Mockingbird haha) dresses...
Â 
The gosh dang beetles. Eeeeeeeeeeeh? I know it's symbolic of something but I don't know what yet and it was just a little off.
Â 
Oh yeah Dany's pillars and stones, really? Just makes me more mad at her for not being shown fucking Daario.

I guessed at the time that the cousin (Olton? Orson? What was the name), might become Tyrion's "Moon Boy" in his line to Jaime (she's been fucking Lancel...), but hardly justification for it.

My nitpick is that a lot of the time D&D try that, writing something themselves, it's a bit clunky, takes too much time, and there's usually something from the book that would have been better.Â  Like........letting Oberyn and Tyrion (and Jaime, too, if we had to have some beetle) have a bit of the talk about Elia, Cersei, and Rhaegar, it would have been good for the show.Â  It would have explained why The Red Viper was certain that Tywin issued the orders to have Elia slaughtered, just as he did with the Reynes and Castameres.Â

Tywin sent the letter: Hello!Â  "Mace, get me a quill and paper."
Its purpose is to rid Dany of one of her two wise andÂ experienced soldiers, as told by Varys.Â Tywin doesn't worry about Selmy because he's old.

Varys ends up weakeningÂ Dany's campaign with nothing but words, knowing Tywin will do somethingÂ pragmatic.Â Â

Â 
Lol I've watched a lot of TV and I can safely say that monologue was one of the worst scenes I've ever witnessed.Â 
Â 
And I'm sorry but why are you using the word "plagiarize"? This show is an adaptation of ASOIAF. If D&D were competent, they would take as much dialogue from the books as possible - it takes a lot of talent to be able to translate dialogue from book to screen successfully. There are pretty much two main reasons they don't use more book dialogue: they've weakened the characterisation of the characters so much that a lot of it wouldn't make sense, and because of their arrogance. They think their writing is on-par with GRRM's. Unfortunately for us, they couldn't be more wrong.

3783	Bridgeburners	2014-06-02	Do any of you watch Vikings? It's this show that, while not especially well written or anything, is very self aware. So it doesn't try too hard to be profound or anything. For that, I really enjoy it. Everything fits the tone, and it's really exciting to watch. But that's not why I bring it up. There was one scene in particular where the main character, Ragnar Lothbrok, and his vikings are raiding a town in England (which involves a lot of indiscriminate slaughter). At that point the show was trying to sell us the idea that Ragnar had some compassion. While he and his comrades were looking for treasure in a little house, Ragnar spies a little English child hiding in a corner. He looks back, looks at the child, and then puts a cloth on top of him and walks away. That's all the show needed to tell us.
Â 
But with the modern GoT Dawson's Creek style writing, of course that's not enough for us, the plebeian audience. They have to make sure that we know what's going on. Instead of simply having her close the curtain and walking away, allowing us to digest the incredibly obvious fact that she's acting from compassion rather than simply being too bored to deal with Gilly, they have to give us that little shot of her saying "shh" and putting her finger over her mouth, so that Ygritte and Gilly can clue us in on their little secret. Of course these writers have to go that extra mile for those of us in the audience whom they perceive to be absolutely fucking retarded and in need of every non-subtle explicit explanation of what's happening.
Â 
I know this is a small deal, but it's just one of the many stupid displays of zero subtlety in the GoT writing that made me want to throw a boot at the TV screen.

Here's something else... when Ygritte skewered that brothel owner who made herself out to be an antagonistic shit-head earlier in the scene... were we supposed to applaud and cheer? I don't know, that's what it felt like the writers were trying to do with that, but maybe it's just me. I mean, she still ruthlessly just murdered an innocent person that she never met.

I think the book they say "root and branch".
Anyway Sansa's jewellery in her Mockinjay dress, also the cleavage was not really appropriate for mourning.
Greyworm gazing at Missandei.... the man was castrated before the age of 5, I am going to go out on a limb and say that he would not necessarily develop a standard heterosexual male sexuality given the lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Friendship, and the need to be held sure, but probably less interested in bewbs..
Sweet Robin's lack of mourning for his mother.
Burping sex workers in Mole's Town.

I haven't seen Vikings, but that's a great example. Another is True Detective. When Rust is undercover with the bikers and they're raiding a drug stash-house, Rust searches all the rooms to look for anyone else, and when he finds a small boy, he unsentimentally and briskly takes the boy by the arm, puts him in the bathtub and tells him to stay down.
A very simple yet telling scene. Rust is not a sentimental hero in the traditional sense by any means. He's a dark, haunted and morally ambiguous cop, yet he still has a small bit of basic human decency left in him, so he makes sure the kid is relatively safe. No cheesy music or camera zooms, just showing it how it is, and not spoon-feeding the audience by saying "hey look at this! Isn't s/he a great and compassionate and deep person because s/he spared a kid?? How deep is this?? Did you see it??? Did you see the looks in their faces???"
Anyway, rant over. The scene would have been fine had Ygritte just given Gilly and the baby a glance, close the curtains and walk away. The simplicity of the scene would have been more affecting, in my opinion, than a long and cheesy series of close-up shots on faces.

Will do. I remember watching about the half of the first episode when it first came out and not being overly impressed, but I'll definitely give it another shot and be a bit more patient. It has Gabriel Byrne in it, so that's one reason right there I'll watch it a bit more, since after binging the first season of In Treatment a while ago I was amazed at his performance.

3797	Arya Stark Rules	2014-06-02	One of the worst episodes I have watched since starting to watch this show.
Sansa's dress was horrible, she looked like Diana Ross about to perform in feathers.

Arya's laugh was soo cringe-worthy, and the whole stark sibling about to reach their sibling and something happens is getting old.
Â 
Tyrion talking about beetles, I don't even want to talk about that part.
Â 
The Jorah whitewashing, really needs to stop at this point. Most of the unsullied are rooting for Jorah in that situation, whiles in the book he clearly did worse, such as his creepy desires for Dany etc.
And the whole banishment was rushed, Dany didn't even take time to consider it.
Â 
Kit Harrington is showing no improvement on his acting, I am starting to wonder why someone else wasn't casted as Jon.
Â 
Ramsey scenes are such a bore fest.
Â 
The only good thin about this episode was the duel, I was really disappointed in this episode.
Â 
.
3798	Arya Stark Rules	2014-06-02	I think the show has officially jumped the shark.
Missandei/Grey Worm. I can't even put into words how cringeworthy everything was.
Dany is braiding her handmaiden's hair now??? Ok. Glad to see she's having such a great time of being queen that she can just act like a handmaid.
Why was Missandei even bathing in a lake?Â 
Show-Missandei isn't even close to being as intelligent as book-Missandei, despite being an adult. WTF?
Jorah's exile was way too rushed, which is ridiculous considering all the time they've had this season to build up to it. He was also completely whitewashed, and in true D&D style they chose to focus on his mainpain instead of Daenerys, who just found out she was betrayed by her only friend.
The beetle scene...
Whose idea was it to have the Arya scene end with her laughing? It was so unconvincing and awkward to watch. And despite the Hound being wanted by the crown, he just reveals himself to the guards? And there's not even a follow-up scene dealing with the repercussions of this?
Sansa becoming Maleficent. Lol what even.
Pedro Pascal, Indira Varma and Lena Headey (despite having no lines) saved the episode tbh. Nikolaj and Peter were terrible. It felt like they were playing completely different characters.


I agree with everything you said especially the last sentence
3799	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-02	Did not see the reason for the Missandei/Grey worm scenes - It felt unnecessary unless they are actually going somewhere important with it and it is going to be of relevance.
Â 
The Hound and Arya arriving at the Bloody Gate really rings with idiocy - Surely the fact that Arya Stark (presumed dead) and the Hound (currently has a bounty) turning up would alarm the guards and invite more questions? If they both turn around and leave for elsewhere without any repercussions then the inclusion of this scene is surely a bad idea.Â 
Â 
I like that the show portrayed Sansa's transformation from a dim-witted girl with dreams to a girl who is more a realist, I think her revelation of her true identity to the Lords Declarant is a questionable move from the showrunners at this point. Littlefinger's eventual plan to reveal Sansa's identity did not even occur at the end of AFFC, so it seems that they have gone too far with Sansa's arc
Â 
However, I do feel like they did the Trial by Combat justice (although they spent way too long on Tyrion's beetle speech- they should have devoted this time to the fight) but it is sad too see Oberyn die - I think that Pedro Pascals performance and portrayal of the Red Viper this season has been amazing

3800	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-02	One of the worst episodes I have watched since starting to watch this show.
Sansa's dress was horrible, she looked like Diana Ross about to perform in feathers.
Arya's laugh was soo cringe-worthy, and the whole stark sibling about to reach their sibling and something happens is getting old.
Â 
Tyrion talking about beetles, I don't even want to talk about that part.
Â 
The Jorah whitewashing, really needs to stop at this point. Most of the unsullied are rooting for Jorah in that situation, whiles in the book he clearly did worse, such as his creepy desires for Dany etc.
And the whole banishment was rushed, Dany didn't even take time to consider it.
Â 
Kit Harrington is showing no improvement on his acting, I am starting to wonder why someone else wasn't casted as Jon.
Â 
Ramsey scenes are such a bore fest.
Â 
The only good thin about this episode was the duel, I was really disappointed in this episode.
Â 
.


Â 
What exactly was he supposed to do? He was silently brooding like JonÂ was supposed to be doing. Â 
Â 
I think he has been great this season and people overdo the whole 'crap acting' card with him, confusing it for underwhelming scenes. Jon is a sullen character (one who doesn't display emotion on his sleeves) so I don't know what people are expecting.Â I'm going to hold myÂ judgement for next week when he has a real emotional scene (Ygritte dying).
Â 
My nitpicks-
Â 
Beetle scene was meaningful but too long.
I would have liked to see more Oberyn-Â Pedro is a fantastic actor and Oberyn a character with limited time. USE him!
Sansa's dress (Queen Ravenna from Snow White?)Â andÂ I feel as if LF/Sansa shippers are being fed. Â Â 
Burping whores...at least have her burp 'The Dornishman's wife' in honour of Oberyn.
Other than that,Â great episode!

3801	MarieAntoinette	2014-06-02	Sana's storyline at the Eyrie and transformation to player feels a bit rushed. I hope this is only because there is a lot for her in store next season and in WOW.
3802	ARYa_Nym	2014-06-02	Â 
I'm trying to remember exactly where it happened (maybe that village The Hound and Arya worked at? or the Inn?) but I think I recall something about Arya thinking how The Hound's dream of selling her to Lady Lysa dies maybe at the foothills to the Vale, proabably near the Inn?Â  Then, he may be back to the idea of The Blackfish and Riverrun?Â  Something like that, and Arya is thinking how she was always trying for Riverrun and never makes it?Â 
Â 
Â 


Arya finds out in AFFC.

Â 
"The lady of the Vale was her mother's own sister. "Lady Lysa," she said," is she?" "...dead?" finished the freckled boy whose head was full of courtesans. "Aye. Murdered by her own singer." "Oh." It 's nought to me. Cat of the Canals never had an aunt. She never did. Cat lifted her barrow and wheeled away..."

Â 
In the books he wanted to take her to the Vale. She never wanted to go (she wanted to go to the Wall) but the path there was blocked and/or too dangerous.
3803	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	Arya finds out in AFFC.
Â 
In the books he wanted to take her to the Vale. She never wanted to go (she wanted to go to the Wall) but the path there was blocked and/or too dangerous.


Â 
Thanks, I think I'm remembering now......the plan for The Vale died, not Lysa herself, LOLÂ
3804	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-06-02	My only nitpick is the Hound and Arya's scene. Â The "Lol Heard 'Round the World" was great. Â Announcing, "Hey, here's the missing Stark girl," not so much.
Â 
Why so much hate for the Beetle scene? Â I thought it was clever, and funny as hell. Â It was a rare chance to see Jaime and Tyrion acting like brothers before the world got crazy. Â What else are you going to do the night before your Trial by Combat then to get drunk with your brother (Jaime wasn't drinking though) andÂ reminisce about a mentally handicapped cousin that made you laugh while giving insight into GRRM's mind.
Â 
I also thought the Meereen scenes were great. Â Yeah, Missandei/Grey Worm was filler, but he is an awesome secondary character, and I enjoyed seeing him portrayed as still a man. Â Dany dismissing Jorah was perfect. Â She was just as cold in the books as in the show. Â In her thoughts, she wanted to forgiver her bear, but in reality she came across as harsh.
3805	yushkevitch	2014-06-02	Sana's storyline at the Eyrie and transformation to player feels a bit rushed. I hope this is only because there is a lot for her in store next season and in WOW.


Â 
I think (hope) that it's because the writers realized that the whole Vale angle in the books was way too long and - so far - seemingly unnecessary to the overall story.
Â 
With all that is happening elsewhere are we really supposed to be concerned about Sansa/Alayne keeping a sickly, annoying brat's fits under control? It would seem the show writes decided to fast-track the entire storyline and I for one thank them for that

Â 
Have you ever seen the MetRx world's stongest man competition?
Â 
I can assure you, those dudes could easily make a skull explode with their bare hands.Â
3808	Tadco26	2014-06-02	Littlefinger slipped back from mastermind to "lucky that worked out for me".Â  Then Sansa becomes evil queen of the night.Â  Lots of people know Arya and Sansa are alive now, hard to believe someone with connections to Varys wouldn't.Â 
Â 
Â 
The whole Jorah thing felt so rehearsed.Â  It was like she already knew from Barristan what had happened,Â and was passing judgement on a random stranger who had betrayed her, rather than her closestÂ confidant.Â  Why not show her reaction when she first finds out?Â  There was a lack of emotion.Â  Of course theyÂ reduced Jorah's lust for Dany, and Jorah's strained relationship with Barristan.Â Â Not denying the pardon as a forgery was also questionable, as well as a copy of the pardon even existing.Â Â Â 
Â 
Messendei and Greyworm romance seems like there are better things to spend screen time on, and someone turned into a eunuch at ~5 is pretty unlikely to have sexual feelings towards a woman.
Â 
The beetle speach wasÂ way too long for what, if anything, it added to the show.Â  So much original dialogue is cut due to lack of time, to spend that much time on smashing beetles.Â 
Â 
What are the Ironborn doing?Â  Balon is still alive.Â  If Balon had still been alive when Theon tried to retake Moat Cailin, then Victarion and his men would have still been there.Â  They left Moat Cailin weakly defended because they all left to attend the King's Moot.Â  So why are they so weak, sickly, and unsupported in the show withÂ nothing to distract them?Â Â No mention of the bog devils either.

Have you ever seen the MetRx world's stongest man competition?
Â

Yeah, i read it takes about 500 pounds of pressure to crack a skull, so it's not a ridiculous thing to imagine a guy of the Mountains size and strength doing. Â Not anymore than what he does in the book imo.
3810	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-02	Do any of you watch Vikings? It's this show that, while not especially well written or anything, is very self aware. So it doesn't try too hard to be profound or anything. For that, I really enjoy it. Everything fits the tone, and it's really exciting to watch. But that's not why I bring it up. There was one scene in particular where the main character, Ragnar Lothbrok, and his vikings are raiding a town in England (which involves a lot of indiscriminate slaughter). At that point the show was trying to sell us the idea that Ragnar had some compassion. While he and his comrades were looking for treasure in a little house, Ragnar spies a little English child hiding in a corner. He looks back, looks at the child, and then puts a cloth on top of him and walks away. That's all the show needed to tell us.
Â 
But with the modern GoT Dawson's Creek style writing, of course that's not enough for us, the plebeian audience. They have to make sure that we know what's going on. Instead of simply having her close the curtain and walking away, allowing us to digest the incredibly obvious fact that she's acting from compassion rather than simply being too bored to deal with Gilly, they have to give us that little shot of her saying "shh" and putting her finger over her mouth, so that Ygritte and Gilly can clue us in on their little secret. Of course these writers have to go that extra mile for those of us in the audience whom they perceive to be absolutely fucking retarded and in need of every non-subtle explicit explanation of what's happening.
Â 
I know this is a small deal, but it's just one of the many stupid displays of zero subtlety in the GoT writing that made me want to throw a boot at the TV screen.

Omg you are in my effing head seriously! I was very, very upset that they made her do that. I thought the subtlety of them observing each other, understanding the situation and having Ygritte just close the curtain and walk away saying nothing would have much more powerful.
And its funny you say that D&D dumb things down and have to explain everything to the audience which in some cases I completely agree w/ you. But I was just today reading a review article from an unsullied viewer, by Vanity Fair no less, and the author not only found himself having to wiki Most Cailin and its strategic importance to the North (and therefore why Roose needed Ramsey to get this castle back) but he couldn't figure out why Cersei wants Tyrion dead so badly.
So either this guy is not paying attention and should not be writing review articles or Dan & Dave need to be better at picking their moments of subtlety vs the overtly obvious.
3811	Colonel Green	2014-06-02	This isn't a new nitpick, since the previous episode had the same thing, but whatever:Â  the writers seem to have forgotten that Lysa and Robin lived in King's Landing until Jon Arryn died.
3812	northernmonkey	2014-06-02	Why was Missandei even bathing in a lake?Â 


Â 
Is this the stupidest criticism of an episode ever? Why does anyone bathe in a lake? To get clean, obviously.

To be fair, though, we don't really find out why Cersei truly wants Tyrion dead so badly until well into aFFC with her flashback dream. Nor do we ever really realize how truly terrified of him she is until her PoV (until then we probably thought she was just being a bitch and faking her horror of him to gather sympathy from other lords).

Can't exactly be going around the vale looking like Sansa. someone would put two and two together. Â Plus she only revealed to the 3 people in the room during the trial. She'll still be Alayne to everyone who doesn't already know.

Â 
Why not? Â She already trapsed through the Vale and right up to the door with the red hair before she pulled her hood up with the long red hair sticking out, LOL. Â And then had the red hair while she was there...with all the servants able to see her red hair.
Â 
And then, one day, Black Sansa.
Â 
While it's true that the book stretched credulity a little that no ever checked out the "daughter" that showed up exactly when Sansa disappeared....at least they had the hair black before she gets to the Vale where no one but a handful of LF people sees her.
3821	Bridgeburners	2014-06-02	Okay I have something else to air my grievances over, although I'm not sure anything can out-douche Ygritte's abominable shushing.Â 
Â 
Who the fuck thought it would be a good idea to make Oberyn dance like a ballerina? Yes, all of his flips and double spin-jumps and spear-twirling is impressive, I'm sure it takes a lot of practice. It just doesn't do shit for a fight. I would have been okay with his initial display to impress the crowd if, afterwards, he went into regular fight mode. Instead, he kept the ballerina act throughout the whole fight. That is not a way to get the audience invested in a fight at all. When you suspend reality to that degree, we can no longer really make sense of what the character's struggle is any more. Gregor just knocked Oberyn to the ground? Should we be worried about this potential positional shift in advantage? In a real fight, yes, but who know if Oberyn can fly into a fancy double spin jump from the ground from Gregor's next sword swing? Whoops, there he goes.
Â 
I loved the way it was described in the books. Oberyn went through great lengths to keep the distance between them to use the advantage of his superior ranged spear (unlike in the show where he went into swinging distance, like, 20 times). He keeps his ground and avoids the parries with careful side-steps. It's described so brilliantly, that every moment there's tension, and the way he's described to move at just the right time, meanwhile giving us the impression of what could have happened if he didn't, or how delicate his motion is. Well in the show, where he's a fucking flying fairy, we have absolutely no notion of the impending danger or tension.

I imagine it would be very pragmatic against unarmored/lighty armored opponents, like chinese fighters for example.

But a 7 feet guy with a plate armor on? No freaking way.
3824	Milcov	2014-06-02	Honestly this show is terrible, I just love the source material too much. I love Umberto Eco's novels but my only gripe with them is that sometimes I feel like Eco writes them purely for himself because the level of knowledge to get most of his writing is so ludicrous that you feel only he really gets his books, this show is the opposite. I feel like the writers assume I'm a five year old with severe memory loss from the past 4 years. The writing and directing are pathetic, the production and set design is mind-blowing though. Specific gripes for this week:
Â 
- Oberyn's fight, it was like Darth Maul. Stupid, it looks flashy but it's so absurd that you couldn't take it seriously as a fight.
- Beetles. Jesus Christ, were they letting their school teachers know that they read Wittgenstein, or are they just hack writers. Who knows.
- Darth Sansa. The hair has come at a completely illogical time, but what was with the feathers and necklace.
- Arya. She's a terrible actor and the writing is terrible. 3edgy5me crap. We're back to "Nothing is nothing." and "Death is my God."
- The Mountain. 3rd time was not lucky, the guy can't deliver a simple line. "I smashed her head. In like this." rather than "I smashed her head in. Like this."
- Everyone is stupid. Sandor declaring himself and Arya, no one doing anything about it. Yohn Royce just accepting that since Sansa is who she says that LF should remain Lord Protector
Â 
I could go on and on. The show just can't be subtle, or have any good original dialogue.
3825	Kyrion	2014-06-02	I have my fair share of criticisms, but that was ridiculous.
Â 
Ragnar put the blanket over the child rather than leave the child.
Â 
He took an action.
Â 
Ygritte did a shh motion rather than just leave, doing an action.
Â 
Both did a single action...wtf?
Â 
Anyways...surprised noone has said Moat Cailin. No mention of Victarion or anything, and why the hell did they change the scene that was so easy to do? All you needed to do was do it exactly like it was in the books, there was no more characters to be casted or anything, have it so that Reek actually does stuff besides just present the letter. Why this change? Again, I think they wanted the stupid visual of the guys head, and they think they know better than George, thats just ridiculous.
Â 
The Arya laughing.....this was just terrible. Why? Now the people at the Bloody gate know the Hound, a wanted man mind you, has Arya Stark? Knowing D&D they will just show the hound collapse somewhere back in the riverlands this last episode, skipping over they part of the people tellng the Lords of the Vale that they HAVE ARYA STARK!!! This was stupid.
Â 
Sansa showing her power over littlefinger way too early, in AFFC this went over many peoples heads and even though I made a topic about how Sansa will use Littlefingers attraction towards her over her when he asked for his kiss at the end, it was at the end of AFFC....this seems like Sansa is advancing way too fast with no time to reflect or anything. Also we get the hair dying AFTER going to the Vale rather than before wth? D&D think they know better than the writer.....ugh and its made to make Sansa look even more like Catelyn, so we assume Sansa is exerting even more power over Littlefinger....way too fast for Sansa's development. Shes not a intrigue master yet D&D .

Ragnar's action was analogous to Ygritte closing the curtain on Gilly, in that they're both necessary to keep the potential victim hidden from their blood thirsty comrades. It wouldn't make sense if they hadn't done that. Ygritte "shushing" her was completely and absolutely unnecessary, and it only served one purpose: to tell us, the audience, that Ygritte intended to keep Gilly's presence hidden from the rest of the wildlings. The writers decided that if she had seen Gilly and then just closed the curtain and walked away, we wouldn't understand what happened, so they had to make Ygritte tell us exactly what happened. Or I'm sure Gilly was thinking "oh shit, well I was going to just wail in terror but now that you mention it, it is a good idea for me to keep quiet, thanks for sparing me!" Ygritte closing the curtain and leaving her there would have been powerful. Shushing her turned it into a Looney Toons cartoon.
Â

- The Mountain. 3rd time was not lucky, the guy can't deliver a simple line. "I smashed her head. In like this." rather than "I smashed her head in. Like this."

Haha, now that you mention it, I'm surprised nobody brought that up. You're right, that was a completely awkward delivery there. I chalked it up to him just being exhausted and catching his breath in the middle of giving his line, but still, it just felt pretty cringeworthy.Â

Sure I'm overdoing it a bit, but all the best dialogue that there's been in this show has been from the books or a very close adaptation from the books. D&D's original stuff results in Beetles and Nothing is nothing. The writers of the show need to just accept their limitations and use good existing dialogue that's in place. Compare the writing on this, to something like The Sopranos or Mad Men and you'll find that Game of Thrones is very dumbed down and lacking any real subtlety or depth.

2.Â  Beetle cousin story/ Jamie even seeing tyrion before he frees him.
Â 
3.Â  Overall Moat Cailin and lack of Ironborn story.
Â 
4.Â  The fact they simultaneously made Oberyn's death less realistic and more grotesque.Â  If anything I figured they desensitize the murder and in turn make it less real, somehow managed toÂ make it worse in each aspect.
Â 
5.Â  Sansa and Littlefinger, SansaÂ basically jumping to WoW material already.Â  Bronze YohnÂ is pretty bad too

6.Â  Hound revealing Arya/ them not tying up their episode scenes, are we evenÂ going to hear from them next week?Â  Basically anything in and around theÂ Vale.
Â 
7.Â  The manner Jorah is banished, absurd.
Â 
8.Â  Jon, Sam's scene.Â  NW numbers scaled down to 100 while wildlings up too 100,000 too dumb too comment on really
Â 
9.Â  No shields?
.10Did I mention grey worms a eunuch?Â Â Â Â Â ;Â and im sure theres a few more thatre more intricate than critiquing sansa's dress , or the ygritte scene, maybe consider that ygritte herself didn't know what she was going to do at first

Agree that Arya is literally "cracking up". Felt that was alright, makes sense in context. But the Hound calling himself the Hound and then revealing he had Arya Stark and the idiot guard not taking him from her was just awful.

Â If you're going to make up a scene, please, just make it good. Â Â I thought the scene and dialogue with Tyrion and Jaime was just terrible. Â And I'm actually surprised there hasn't been more backlash aside from its quality on what seemed like a totally unnecessary mockery of a mentally challenged cousin. Â Don't get me wrong, I don't expect GoT to be PC. Â But that was an overall ridiculous scene in every way IMO.

Chaos is a ladder was a bit too obvious for me, it destroyed Littlefinger. That was the scene that removed the mystery from his character and just had him boasting about how great he was and all his plans to Varys. One of their better bits of dialogue mind, just not fitting with the character saying it. Good dialogue but a horrendous lack of subtlety as to a character's motives and means of operations.
Â 
And don't know how I forgot about the absurd numbers at The Wall. Polybius couldn't make that stuff up, Helm's Deep has to be about as outrageous as it gets at ~300 vs 10,000 for a traditional fortification assault scene. But just over 100 against 100,000 is absurd. It's like the writers didn't believe that being outnumbered 10-1 would sink in to viewers as overwhelming odds. More proof that they think we're all idiots.

Polybius couldn't make that stuff up, Helm's Deep has to be about as outrageous as it gets at ~300 vs 10,000 for a traditional fortification assault scene. But just over 100 against 100,000 is absurd. It's like the writers didn't believe that being outnumbered 10-1 would sink in to viewers as overwhelming odds. More proof that they think we're all idiots.


Â 
Â 
Yeah, but TV LF has been talking smack since the beginning with Varys, so they already ruined the idea of no one knowing he's a power player. Â He has never been mysterious or subtle since the first season.
Â 
I am waiting to laugh my ass off when the Hound and Arya announcing who they are...is totally ignored by the show....LF and Sansa will not know or speak of it....and the next time we see Arya and the Hound, I predict, they'll be back on the road....having been let go at the Vale.
3835	Lord Joker	2014-06-02	Â 
Â 
Agree that Arya is literally "cracking up". Felt that was alright, makes sense in context. But the Hound calling himself the Hound and then revealing he had Arya Stark and the idiot guard not taking him from her was just awful.
Â 
Why couldn't they at LEAST put some runes on Â Yohn's armor? Like...how hard would that have been? Why show him in his armor without making it look like it's described in the books? Just...baffling.Â 


Maybe because it changes nothing and would cost money for nothing, in a season where i'm sure they are tight with money considering the next episode?
Â 
Not sure how baffling that is...lol

Yeah, weirdly some of the best dialogue on the show but it's just so totally bad writing of those characters. The two characters that should embody mystery and subtlety are completely devoid of it on the show, which is a real shame. This isn't just a gripe of the adaptation, but the general role they fit in as 'puppet-masters' or 'chess grandmaster' should be one that requires careful dialogue which doesn't blurt out grand plans or aims. The writers just can't actually do that or don't want to. Which tells me they're either bad writers or don't rate the faculties of their audience.
Â 
Agreed, completely ridiculous. It'll be like Jon with Stannis.
3837	Matoro	2014-06-02	Apparently the showwriters want to build Missandei-GreyWorm -romance instead of something actually useful, like DanyxDaario, which has even a plot relevance. Hell, why waste time discussing Grey Worm's penis if you could have last Oberyn scenes before his untimely death?
Â 
And Gilly is just boring. Everything in Mole's Town is boring.
Â 
Greatest nitpick, though, is what they did to Tyrion. Some kind of beetle cousin story? What? C'mon, it's his last scene before the trial and you waste it by making Dinklage do monologue about BEETLES? Why not doing, for example, a scene where Oberyn and Tyrion discuss about the fight? Or really anything other that stupid beetles.

Decreases a bit of the immersion and world-building. Considering the insane detail they put into costumes on the dresses I don't see how it would be so hard, or if they didn't want to make the armour yet all they had to do was make him wear standard clothing.

Â 
Like I said, they are random. Â Remember that super moving speech Cat made about the young Jon Snow almost dying. Â Sure, it was a nice scene...but completely pointless, it had no purpose, no relevance to anything...I remember at the time people trying to defend based on the Robb will theory, but of course, there is no will in the show.
Â 
The botching of the Jon and Stannis plots makes me really worry that its going to be Dany who survives and not Jon Snow in the end and I am wrong....because, why the fuck else have they destroyed that whole plotline?? Â 
Â 
I doubt TV viewers even remember Stannis was going to go North, because TV Stannis appears to have totally forgotten he was going to go North as it hasnt' been mentioned at all this season. Â
3840	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-02	I don't remember another episode in which so many potentially good things were removed in favor of subpar writing:
Â 
1. Instead of Oberyn telling Tyrion the ending of the story "Bi-Curious Oberyn goes to Casterly Rock" and Tywin's true reason to kill Elia we got: the beetles, man! The damn beetles!
Â 
2. Instead of Littlefinger showing his impressive manipulation of the Lords Declarants through Nestor and Corbray we got: him being a complete moron with no back-up plan whatsoever. Also, Sansa raided Angelina Jolie's closet, apparently
Â 
3. Instead of that great little scene of Kevan (or Tywin in the show, I guess) just placing the warrants in front of Tommen so he could sign them we got: Roose teaching Ramsay the cardinal points and renacting that scene of "The Lion King" (if Scar had won)
Â 
4. Instead of the sheer horror and drama of Moat Cailin we got: a watered-down, rushed version of Moat Cailin. It seemed they just wanted to be done with it
Â 
5. Instead of developing the increasingly irritating Dany so she could resemble more an actual character we got: Missandei and Grey Worm, a love story for the ages, I'm sure
Â 
Also, I just gotta say it: even if book!Tormund has probably killed his share of people there's a reason why Martin didn't show it: because then we would have been rooting for his death instead of rooting for him.
Â 
I guess I should have known the episode was going to be inferior, since it started with a burping whore

Understandable, but many main characters don't even wear the colors of their house like the books, so i'm not surprised a minor character doesn't get every single detail.
3842	Croyd	2014-06-02	All of the things that make the "Books" and the "First Season" so great have been watered down into stupidity.
The Book and the Show are for people of average to smart intelligence.The writers have turned an unfinished masterpiece into a pile of mud that only pigs would find attractive.
Never watching the show again. If I want retarded dribble I can watch regular non cable TV with commercials. The Screenplay writers for GoT must have been hired directly from the StarWars prequels.
Nonsense story lines, nothing holds the attention, which character is supposed to be Jar Jar?
Â 
Dany's crap acting/Horrid editing .
She isn't even looking at Jorah....
She should be looking down at Jorah and spiting him. This was obviously filmed with a green screen, she doesnt even know where the man ,that she hates the most in the whole world, is at the moment.
Â 
George, is there anything you can do to stop them from mutilating your masterpiece or has that ship sailed already?
Nevermind , even George has sold out by telling fans that he will write more about Osha , who has nothing to do with the plot anymore.
Paraphrasing GRRM, "She will be written about because she is a good actress"
Hey GRRM ,didn't you say that you set out to write ASOIAF because it was something that never could be adapted to TV or the BigScreen.
Â 
Â 
GRRM=SELLOUT

His armor is mentioned like everytime anyone talks or sees him in the books. It would have cost them next to nothing to have it etched into his beast plate, and it would have given the viewers an easy way to identify him in the future.
Also, I feel like the guy playing him should be playing Mace and they could have gotten someone slightly more formidable for Yohn.

All through that speech I was just shaking my head at how it went against her other interactions with Jon, even on the show. But I suppose it was better than most of what they've written. But compare that to Jaime's scene in the bath.
Â 
It's not even going North, which they've also totally neglected to mention but the fact that Jon knows about Bran. Will they even keep Stannis' offer of Winterfell, the major defining decision of Jon's character? Because now he's stealing his younger brothers Lordship. Hardly the same decision. The same with Sansa and Arya, Sansa will know Arya is alive. Or maybe they could have Littlefinger find out and keep it from Sansa, which depending on where they go in TWoW/ADoS could move that story. But as of now, it's looking stupid by everyone involved.

They obviously used old armor not to spend more money on a whole new set just for him, though.
Â 
I definitely agree with the second part though, he should have been a bit younger.
3846	Wings	2014-06-02	I was so disappointed with the lack of screen time for Oberyn. He is obviously a fan favourite - not just from the books, but also in the show itself.
The whole filler scenes about the beetles and Grey Worm's pillar were not all that good and I would have much more preferred to see the book scene of Oberyn before the fight. It would also have been a great way of introducing Daemon Sand.
And maybe it was because I already knew what was going to happen, but Oberyn's demise was not the big surprise I would think it to be. The timing of both shots and actors seemed just a bit off.
3847	Brother Walfrid	2014-06-02	The emphasis on The Mountain's last words was totally weird.
Â 
Â 
'Then I smashed her head,pause, In like this"

should have been

Â 
One thing I don't understand about these intern writers that are working on GoT.
The final 2 books haven't been written yet, why are you idiots rushing the timeline of the story and inserting filler everywhere?
You have so much material to work with that you can turn 7 books into 20 seasons.
The show has been a hit since season1 , what is possesing you to waterdown all of the intelligent writing into daytime drama TV?
If you tell HBo, "It's 7 books , the show is a PHENOMANal hit , we are going to need to do 20 seasons" Do you think HBO will get mad, are you CRAZY?
They would love to hear this, a hit show that will go on forever! , Why rush through the good parts and feed the masses dribble.
Are you in a rush to be unemployed? What gives?
Â 
The show is a hit because of the writing GRRM put into books, if it works, dontfix it. You are not a better writer than GRRM.
I hope this show gets canceled before it finishes.

Â 
I was just thinking "why"? Â How about some Northern lords instead. Â Or I might have been thinking 'why doesn't she just bash Talisa's head in right now?"
Â 
It beats the hell out of me how they are going to make Jon's rejection of Stannis offer have any meaning, other than ignore the fact that Jon Snow would never even consider usurping his brother's place for a nanosecond. Â Again, stupid move that didn't even serve any dramatic purpose in the show...Jon knows Bran is alive, so what? Â He's not doing jack about it, is he?
Â 
I can't see how Stannis and his new Braavosi army of sellswords, I guess?, showing up in the nick of time to save the Wall is going to be anything but abrupt and a head scratcher....because apparently Red Dress cracking jokes and taking a bath was more central to the plot than a couple of lines on the North....
3850	oursisthefury69	2014-06-02	I love how they consider it such a brilliant fight scene as well...Â Â Â  Don't get me wrong im not going to sit here and pretend to critique simulated swordplay however

Â 
Nope, they reach some village near the High Road to the Eyrie, but that's as far as they get

I honestly don't know how they'll made their way out of this one. Even if Lysa is dead Littlefinger and Sansa would obviously pay any ransom to get Arya

Exactly... And if episode 9 is all about the Wall then there's going to be an awful lot of strings to resolve for the last one.

Yeah, the one major drawback Â of inventing the storylines for people like Asha. You can't make any major changes since it'd screw things up a lot in the future. Asha would have most likely buried a hatchet in ramsay before he could let the dogs out, but since you can't just kill off Ramsay without severely screwing theon's story. She has to stand there and let him open the cage.
3861	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-02	Wasn't Petyr Baelish's grandfather the Braavosi sellsword? Not technically inaccurate that his GGF would be, but still, I thought it was: Grandfather: sellsword ---> knight, father: knight ---> minor lord, LF: minor lord ---> major lord.

Â 
It's lazy plotting. Â If they felt they had to have Asha try to save Theon, surely they could have figured out a more realistic way for them to lose than stand around watching Ramsay trash talk them, turn his back on them to release the hounds.
Â 
So, it isn't so much the changes per se...but that they are executed in the wider context very poorly. Â We know Asha and the IB would have either killed Theon, taken Theon with them, killed Ramsay or all died trying. Â The one thing they would not have done is left the heir to Pyke in a fucking kennel as a prisoner of a pcychopath and then stood around while said psycho turns his back on them.
Â 
Same with the Bran/Locke/Craster's Keep plot..doing something like that in itself isn't so bad...but the way they did it..super illogical if you think about it for any amount of time...Locke would have never left the witnesses alive, Jon would never do nothing knowing his brother is alive...
Â 
They create scenes that work as scenes and then go on to the next one. Â Ignoring plot holes and inconsistencies they create. Â

F*** THE MOTHERF***ING UNIVERSE FOR MURDERING THE BEST F***ING CHARACTER OF THE SEASONÂ  LAST THREE SEASONS
 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  
^
that was my reaction to the end of the duel
Â 
Moving on, because this is Game of Thrones and we have to.Â 
Â 
- Yes, please please waste more time on a completely made-up, irrelevant, uninteresting, unnecessary and ridiculous romantic storyline between an eunuch and handmaiden played by a hot actress because it so has a future, since Grey Worm has never been, isn't or never will be a bloody EUNUCH.Â 
Â 
- And yes please waste even more time on Sam bitching about how he should have never left Gilly in Moles Town. YES, dude, you should have never left Gilly in Moles Town, that is known. God, Sam is supposed to be smart of what the hell, book Sam would never be such a dumbass to do something like that. This was no more than a stupid excuse to waste more screentime on Gilly and Sam, just so they won't have to get ahead with the actual plot.Â 
Â 
- Mance Rayder's army has been very close since 8 damn episodes, hit me with some news, Jon Snow.Â 
Â 
- WHAT THE FUCK with the eyes?! He was just supposed to break his neck, it was supposed to be quick. And for god's sake, nobody can fucking crash a skull with his bare fucking hands. Even Gregor needed a wall to crash Aegon's head.Â 
Â 
- FOUR GODDAMN MINUTES of talking about Cousin Whatshisname and his fucking beetles. FOUR MINUTES. WHO gives a DUSTY FUCK about beetles?Â 
Â 
Seriously, this episode pissed me off beyond words. In case you weren't able to tell yet.Â
3865	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	What the friggen hell has gone wrong with the opening credit sequence?
So this time we get Moat Cailin ... Braavos...(not in this episode) and then again no Eyrie.

Â 
Agree, they were so good with it...and now it seems they totally forgot about it. Â Weak.

- The eyes thing did basically happen in the book. And this is the Mountain - he's like an evil Andre the Giant, so I wouldn't pout it past him.
Â 
- Yeah, beetles scene. When they started talking about cousin-icide, I was hoping to see something more re: Jaime (who casually strangled one of his cousins, "Alton", in Season 2). Instead we got the endless tale about beetles.

3871	PatrickStormborn	2014-06-02	I also thought the Meereen scenes were great. Â Yeah, Missandei/Grey Worm was filler, but he is an awesome secondary character, and I enjoyed seeing him portrayed as still a man. Â Dany dismissing Jorah was perfect. Â She was just as cold in the books as in the show. Â In her thoughts, she wanted to forgiver her bear, but in reality she came across as harsh.


Â 
First of all, I don't think it's right to say that he's "still a man" just because he can develop feelings (sexual or romantic) for a woman... Why can't he still be a man if he just wants friendship, or even just romance? They really didn't need to sexualise him (or Missandei).
Â 
But more importantly, your assessment of book-Daenerys is as far from the truth as possible. I can literally only think of a couple of times in the books where Dany could potentially be described as cold: the deaths of Viserys and Mirri Maz Duur. Every other time, Dany's problem is that she's too fiery. When she finds out that Jorah betrayed her, she doesn't turn cold and dispassionate - she blows up. She wants to forgive him, but she decides that she can't because he's too stubborn and unapologetic.
Â 
If the showrunners wanted to present Jorah in a better light, they certainly succeeded. But it's only done a huge injustice to Dany's character. In the books, she was wrong to exile him... because in reality, she should have punished him or pardoned him, as she realises straight away. But she was ultimately justified to get rid of him.Â

Â 
Is this the stupidest criticism of an episode ever? Why does anyone bathe in a lake? To get clean, obviously.

Â 
Lol this is a "nitpick" thread, what are you expecting?
Â 
I meant that Missandei serves Daenerys and lives with her at the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen... But she goes alllllll the way down from the very top of the pyramid to bathe in a lake rather than taking a bath in her own quarters??
Â 
Of course it's a very particular nitpick, and obviously it's not an important plot hole... But this is a nitpick thread, so who cares?Â

Isn't that a cleansing ritual? I know the Unsullied cleanse in saltwater in the books.
3873	PatrickStormborn	2014-06-02	Isn't that a cleansing ritual? I know the Unsullied cleanse in saltwater in the books.


Â 
The Unsullied have a very specific cleansing ritual (which is how they avoid catching the Pale Mare), but there's no reason for Missandei to do so, particularly when the show hasn't even established that the Unsullied have this ritual.
3874	NewJeffCT	2014-06-02	I thought Sansa's dress looked like Jennifer Lawrence from Mockingjay. Â However, I thought she looked amazing overall in the dark color with dark hair.
Â 
Agreed on the beetle speech. Â It was too long, and ended up not having a point. Â If there was some sort of moral to the story (Olson Lannister is similar to the Mountain - both just bash heads in?)
3875	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	This isn't a new nitpick, since the previous episode had the same thing, but whatever:Â  the writers seem to have forgotten that Lysa and Robin lived in King's Landing until Jon Arryn died.


Â 
LOL Â I noticed that, too. Â Granted, in the books we can go with Robin was young enough not to remember much......but I'm thinking that excuse is difficult to go with here. Â
3876	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	Â 
Why not? Â She already trapsed through the Vale and right up to the door with the red hair before she pulled her hood up with the long red hair sticking out, LOL. Â And then had the red hair while she was there...with all the servants able to see her red hair.
Â 
And then, one day, Black Sansa.
Â 
While it's true that the book stretched credulity a little that no ever checked out the "daughter" that showed up exactly when Sansa disappeared....at least they had the hair black before she gets to the Vale where no one but a handful of LF people sees her.


Â 
Ok, this is a nitpick but as a medium brown haired girl........this is bugging me. Â BookFakeSansaActingasAlayne was said to have chestnut brown hair, I believe, LOL Â I'm tellin ya, us brown haired brunettes get no respect, even when we do have blue eyes. Â

Well, you know they think the audience is stupid, so they would have to go black hair to make sure it wasn't overlooked. Â LOL. But then who knows, they could sure have made some of the secondary characters easier for TV viewers to remember if they made their clothing a little more distinctive.

3882	Simon Steele	2014-06-02	I don't know if DandD are bad writers, but they definitely think there is little intelligence to the audience. For example, when Dany asked Missandei if she knew about how much was taken from the Unsullied when they were cut. In case the audience was confused Dany had to spell it out for poor dumb Missa, and say "you know, the pillar and the stones." And the Missa goes "oh, I don't know. But I think about it all the time." All the time? Not enough to understand exactly what Dany meant without some crude metaphor to make it more clear.
Â 
Then there is the Moat stuff where the tough old Iron Born guy is like "hell no we won't give up." Then out of nowhere one of his guys hatchets him in the head? Really? Had they been planning this before? I mean how did that guy know the other Ironborne wouldn't hatchet him--why did he get to make up the guy's mind, and then on top of that, why didn't they just knock him out, discuss it and then kill him? It was so rushed and dumb.
Â 
I liked the duel, but then I realized: WHERE THE HELL ARE THE TYRELLS? Just because they don't have lines doesn't mean they wouldn't be there. Mace at least should have been there, and maybe I missed him, but you'd think Margaery would've been there too or at least someone might have mentioned why the widowed queen didn't come to the trial of her husband's suspected murderer.
Â 
These guys who made this show really messed it up. It is awful.
Â 
Oh yeah, and when the Hound and Arya are just back on the road next week I'm going to be pissed. No way in hell they would have walked out of there free and clear.

Â 
Agreed about the Missandei thing. It's like they even forget what they write. Back in s3 they said the Unsullied were castrated cock and balls. Hell, Missandei herself said it as she was translating for Kraznys!
Â 
And they forgot that Robin and Lysa used to live in KL as well
Â 
Mace was there watching the duel, by the way, but I didn't see Margaery. The Tyrells always seem to vanish during the last episodes. It was the same last season

Â I'd be more surprised if that didn't happen than if it did at this point.Â 
Â 
I'm still curious how they are going to make the Iron Born a threat in the future with them being so incompetent now.Â  With Balon still alive, there is no reason that Moat Cailin should be so weak and unsupported.Â  Basically the Ironborn sent Yara to the other side of the continent to save Theon when they didn't care about him at all when they left him unsupported at Winterfell, and have spent the rest of their time losing the north to the Boltons.Â  With most of the forces returned home for the King's Moot this made some sense in the books since Balon died before Robb.Â  With Balon still alive in the show, what has Victarion and BalonÂ been doing all this time?

Mace Tyrell is the fat guy sitting to Tywins left
Â 
Arya and the Hound walking towards the Bloody Gates... WTF is wrong with the editors and writers?? 2 episodes before this Arya and the Hound are arguin about getting horses, the episode ends with Arya on a new pony.
Vanishing Ponies and horses? WTF. I could be 9 years old and think the writing is atrocious, GTFO.

					
					
							Edited by Croyd, 02 June 2014 - 03:17 PM.
3887	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	I'd say the chances that we will see Arya and the Hound somewhere else with no mention or explanation of how or why they got out of The Vale at about 90%.
3888	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	I'll just repeat the question 


Â 
I suspect there could be something to this, too. Â I suspect she is bones somewhere under the Dreadfort. Â Then again, did it seem to you that after Roose snuck North to scold Ramsey that.....he must have went South to be let back in the North? Â Or was it that Ramsey just went back towards Dad who was still....North? Â I am dizzy. Â 
Â 
Your point also brings me to this: Â Since at least the past two episodes looked to run short.....why couldn't they have stuck some Missy and Grey Worm there (I do kinda like them, last night just wasn't the time for all of that), stick some of the Beetles there, and let Oberyn and Tyrion (and Jaime and the cousins and the beetles) have a bit of that talk about Elia, Rhaegar, and Cersei. Â
3889	Ye_Olde_Huorn	2014-06-02	The fact that the damn script had the gumption to tell us that Locke was a useless diversion.Â 
Â 
The Hound and Arya scene at the Bloody Gate, and the feeling I have that they'll just turn up leaving the Vale in episode 10.Â 
Â 
The constant inconsistencies that pop up between episodes and seasons. We established the Unsullied are cut 'root and stem' last season - why are they discussing it now?
Â 
Alex Graves. Sadly, he was solid last season, and I was anticipating his expanded role here. He directed some of the stronger scenes (Jaime in the bath, the Night's Watch muntiny). Unfortunately...this season he has just missed the mark time and time again. This duel was just another hit on his kill list; what on this earth possessed him to think histrionic cutting, the shots mere milliseconds in length, of weirdly framed close-ups of feet and weapons were engrossing? Why shoot extreme wide-angles so we can get Martial Arts movie stunts? Bleh, I'm genuinely worried about the big moments in episode 10.Â

Due to recent attacks by better-than-usually-armed Mountain Clansmen, the Department of Vale Security has declared the approach to the Bloody Gates to be AsHighAs Level 2 (Akite), so only uniformed, on-duty Knights are allowed to approach the Final League while mounted. Â Visitors may park their mounts (ponies and horses only, no elephants or dragons) at the Waiting Stable, where black courtesy ravens are available to arrange local transportation.

3894	Tadco26	2014-06-02	Yeah Locke never coming back means they are probably dead...Â  We need to send someone to go hunt them down, but since we haven't heard from him, let's forget it and assume that they are no threat.
Â 
Missendei not "knowing" about unsullied was silly.Â  They could have had the same end result of that conversation, which was clearly done for viewers benefit, without making her look like the book's 10 year old version of MessendeiÂ is 10 years wiser.
3895	Bori	2014-06-02	Cutting out Littlefinger's whole extremely clever plot...The Lords of the Vale: You little shit! You are just an outsider, who was only married to Lysa Arryn, and she was just a Tully, and the ARRYNS own this f*cking Vale (yeah, we know a lot about history!)
Â 
Littlefinger: hmm...it was suicide
Â 
The Lords of the Vale: no it was not suicide
Â 
Sansa: I am Sansa Stark and it was suicide
Â 
The Lords of the Vale: Alrighty! Lord Baelish, the Vale is yours. Please remind us, who was our liegelord before you?
Â 
Littlefinger: hmm...you know, the Arryns. And there is still an Arryn boy somewhere around...
Â 
The Lords of the Vale: Really? OK, then the last offspring of our liegelord is also yours.

Â
3896	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-02	To be fair, though, we don't really find out why Cersei truly wants Tyrion dead so badly until well into aFFC with her flashback dream. Nor do we ever really realize how truly terrified of him she is until her PoV (until then we probably thought she was just being a bitch and faking her horror of him to gather sympathy from other lords).

Yes true and now that Maggy the Frog is being cast for next season we know we'll get that insight hut still D&D do leave room for misunderstanding for unsullied and then other times clunks them over the head
3897	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-02	Your point also brings me to this: Â Since at least the past two episodes looked to run short.....why couldn't they have stuck some Missy and Grey Worm there (I do kinda like them, last night just wasn't the time for all of that), stick some of the Beetles there, and let Oberyn and Tyrion (and Jaime and the cousins and the beetles) have a bit of that talk about Elia, Rhaegar, and Cersei.YES!I was expecting some Rhaegar info and the whole tale of how Tywin got his revenge at Elia for marrying Rhaegar.
3898	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-02	I have a nitpick and I think its a good one... Arya & the Hound. No not the laugh I actually thought it was cute, it may have seemed forced but the idea/reasoning behind it I liked. I actually started to lmao like a second or two before she did. No it wasn't that both she and Hound revealed themselves to the guards, which was silly but necessary if they had any chance of getting through. My concern is the fact that they made it all the way through the High Road to the Bloody Gates completely unscathed. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure the High Road is littered w/ mountain clansmen just waiting for some unsuspecting travelers to just jump out on? And aren't there also shadowcats and other creatures prowling around as well? When Cateyln took Tyrion prisnor and they were on the High Road to the Eyrie- they were attacked, after Tyrion was released and he and Bronn headed back to his father's camp- they were ambushed. So how is it that one man and a little girl aren't swarmed as well? Lol

I think it's the writing for Emilia. She's clearly being told to try and act regal all the time rather than having a human side. And Maisie is a bad example, the combination of the writing and her acting has made Arya absolutely unbearable the past two seasons for me.

Â 
While I agree with JonCon, it's obvious that Oberyn thinks Tywin did issue the order, too, that in itself was important for the show along with the entire story and it would help the show going forward.

3908	Blood of the Trout	2014-06-02	The beetles talk. My least favorite scene in the show by far.

LF's idiocy. Seriously, he had no back-up plan regarding the Lord Declarants? Ok, then.
Â 
Daenerys not looking down at Jorah while exiling him was a strange choice of directing.

Â 
Or....Maybe...just maybe....She chooses this angle cause it is much harder to play someone who is told/must to act regal but inside is still a human that in this moment looses someone dear to her...I can really imagine it...She gives the speech "go away , traitor bla bla boa how dare you!" in a Queen-of-everything-and-everybody like outburst. Then she cuts to silence we can see the rage in her eyes shifting to sorrow Â only to go steely again "Go." she says flatly... -hhahah sorry for the bad writting skills but all I wanted to say is...it always can be and has to be the both aspects of Dany showing in one scene...otherwise she loses the appeal.
3910	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-06-02	As much as I enjoyed Sophie's monologue and appreciate the showrunners are trying to speed up her transition from pawn to player, I felt they did Litttle finger a great disservice by placing him entirely in her mercy as if he had no real plan to consolidate his control of the Eyrie. At this point in the books Littlefinger is at his most devious and overtly powerful position manipulating the Lords Declarent- not expecting to be removed as Lord Protector.
Â 


Â 
Abso-freakin-lutely.
Â 
LF goes completely out of character by turning into a moron with no plan at all, only to be saved by Sansa going completely out of character and showing strength/cunning/deceit we've already established she doesn't possess.
Â 
Every time D&D diverge from GRRM it seems to result in pitiful excuses of writing such as this. Â It doesn't bode well at all for when the show surpasses the books chronologically. Â Even with GRRM providing the outline, unless he's writing the initial draft of the scripts this show is going to sink like the Titanic. Â

Bit of a difference. Hardly able to admit to killing Elia when there's an incredibly volatile Martell marching about demanding vengeance. Had some dangerous Stark renowned for his skill with poison been strutting about King's Landing I bet he'd be less eager to take credit and would pass it onto Walder Frey.

No problem, I just think that Tywin likes to tell himself these things. Â There's lots to learn about the Reynes and Castamere's, how many of them really needed to die to make Tywin feel better about being dissed?? Â Yes, we can look at the difference with Elia and saying a highborn woman, but he, iirc, just talked about not ordering a rape, and not thinking of Elia at all. Â I think it's that he doesn't want to think it about it, LOL Â Now, LOL Â  That's how I see it anyway, but the whole story was important for Cersei going forward, too, I think. Â

Or....Maybe...just maybe....She chooses this angle cause it is much harder to play someone who is told/must to act regal but inside is still a human that in this moment looses someone dear to her...I can really imagine it...She gives the speech "go away , traitor bla bla boa how dare you!" in a Queen-of-everything-and-everybody like outburst. Then she cuts to silence we can see the rage in her eyes shifting to sorrow Â only to go steely again "Go." she says flatly... -hhahah sorry for the bad writting skills but all I wanted to say is...it always can be and has to be the both aspects of Dany showing in one scene...otherwise she loses the appeal.


I agree that the show's depiction of Dany is terrible, but it's so regal and wooden in her interactions that it has to be the role of the writer or director. If they wanted a more human Dany they'd tell Emilia to show more emotion and loosen up a bit, but instead it just gets more and more. No actor could go so off-script and get away with it, certainly no young actress with no other big roles.
3915	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-02	Wait, where is Sansa supposed to have even got that outfit from?? Did Lysa just have it lying around? Did someone make it for her???I'm guessing Little Bird went and massacred all the ravens in the Eyrie? LOL and RMELysa had it to roleplay with Littlefinger: she was the raven, he was the mockingbird, I dunno The dress was so meeehh.... it's true, they don't know subtlety: "hey! how do we show that Sansa has become a player? Let's dress her sexy! sexy = power!". Oh, come on! how isn't that sexist? F U...
3916	Thelastsanson	2014-06-02	I usually let it slide when the shows tweaks or adds something because I understand that changes are necessary, but yesterday's episode just made me cringe a lot of times.Â 
-I've read somewhere that some people think that Emilia's acting tends to be bad but that last night's was great. I think otherwise. IMHO, she was always freaking great as Dany except for this episode. As I watched her exile Jorah, I could not help thinking that her acting was off. Maybe it was just because of the situation, or the camera angles, but to me there was something not right about the way she expressed herself.
-Missandei/Grey Worm? Cute, but not interesting. It was awkward and quite unnecessary when so many things are happening in Westeros of importance with our main characters.
-Arya's laugh was not right. I got why she laughed and everything but the laugh itself was off and weird. I couldn't join in her laughter because it disconcerted me somewhat. Plus, what is are they doing in the Vale? That never happened.
-And Sansa... omg. Everything's happening so fast!
Few things were awesome in this episode, Theon/Reek and the duel.

Â 
She Â has become ridiculously wooden, but it must be then that all--actress, writers, directors, D&D--are in agreement with the Regal All The Time depiction, otherwise, she wouldn't do it.

-Hahahaa...Idk man...Her face when she sees Dario naked not so much "great" acting....It was sooooo off putting...I could not help but to laugh 
-I do hope they are getting somewhere with this Grey Worm testosterone defying love story....I mean...If not we just wasted so much of precious screen time...
- Laugh...Yeah weird writting...I can't imagine what they will do since they already got there...As you said this never happend in the books.
-Sansa was totally epic in that first scene ,but the reaction of the lords of the veil was retarded... "oh well if this girl who claims Peter is her only friend claims that he didnt kill Lysa there is no possible way she is lying"

Â 
I'm just counting down the days until she hops on Drogon and flies back to her home planet or something.
Â 
And then Meereen will be only the (hopefully) badass Barristan kicking ass and taking names, and the lovely, lovely Missandei
Â 
Ugh, and the lovesick Grey Worm. Well, guess you can't have it all
3920	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-06-02	What was with Sansa's dress?
Am I missing something? What happened to Arya and Sandor's horses?
Missandei and Grey Worm isn't doing anything for me. Why is he looking at her like that, seeing as Unsullied are, at least in the books, completely castrated?
Would've liked more Oberyn before the duel.

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Arya's laugh- I thought i was the only one that was like umm ohkay.. glad to know i'm not. I felt like I was in The Office for a second and pulled a Jim face to the a non-existent camera lol.
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â No mention of Fake Arya, hopefully in episode 10. And it was not stated they are going to WINTERFELL and I guarantee a lot of show viewers didn't even realize they are going there.
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Every time Littlefinger looks at Sansa i want to take a shower so gross but I guess that's the point

Didn't read all of it, but if Unsullied are cut pre-puberty, why is he interested in her if he's never produced any testosterone?

3926	Shadrich	2014-06-02	The frickin Mountain. I know he isn't an actor and all, but his moves looked really lame. There was no anger in that, he kinda just lifted his sword and went 'meh' with each swing. The guy from Season 1, Conan Stevens, would have been a lot better. Anger and fury was bursting from that man.
And he has that shitty helmet, that is knocked off, he should have had a great-helm, and a different voice.Â 
Â 
and a shield, of course
Â 
eta: and no slashed boy, and no "my fucking head hurts" and "shut. up!"

3927	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-06-02	Unsullied do not feel emotion, and they certainly don't get turned on by hot girls.Â  They are totally ruining Grew Worm.

Doesn't the book have Unsullied buying whores just to cuddle with them? That pretty much negates the idea that they have no emotion...
3928	Cas Stark	2014-06-02	I, too hated this Mountain, I don't care if he's the strongest man in the world or whatever the fuck. Â Get an ACTOR why don't you? Â But, it's a moot point now. Â Still, they are batting zero from me on their replacement casting.
3929	Croyd	2014-06-02	Doesn't the book have Unsullied buying whores just to cuddle with them? That pretty much negates the idea that they have no emotion...


Yes
3930	Young Nan	2014-06-02	1. Â Beetles. Â OMFG.Â 
Â 
2. Â Littlefingers total lack of a plan. Â At first, when Sansa was like "Sorry, Lord Baelish, but I have to tell the truth", and then told that whole suicide story, I thought that was all pre-rehearsed with Littlefinger and was all part of his plan, but when I found out later that it was all Sansa, I was like.. no fuckin way. Â 
Â 
3. Â Missandei and Grey Worm. Â He doesn't have a dick or hormones. Â So....I don't get it. Â It's filler. Â 
Â 
4. Â Dani is starting to talk more and more like Queen Amidala from Star Wars with every passing episode. Â Also, why was she styling Missandei's hair? Â Maybe next she'll bring Missandei something to eat, and help her get dressed. Â 
Â 
5. Â The Mountain crushing Oberyn's skull with his hands. Â I thought it was cool until then, but found that last part cheesy. Â Indira Varma's facial expressions were great though, I really like her as Ellaria Sand. Â 
Â 
6. Â Beetles. Â ugh. Â
3931	Young Nan	2014-06-02	Also...Roose Bolton's 3 o'clock shadow/beard. Â This is totally a stupid nitpick but he looks depressed or something. Â Maybe it's stressful being Warden of the North. Â

Â 
I said the same thing. Â When we first saw him I figured he hadn't shaved because he was smuggling himself through the IB lines and...no time for hygene.
Â 
Now, it is annoying, he looks like a kindly old grandfather who needs his pipe, not a stone cold killer.
3933	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	Doesn't the book have Unsullied buying whores just to cuddle with them? That pretty much negates the idea that they have no emotion...


Yes yes they did. In fact, i wouldnt be surprised if that piece of information is dropped sometime next season and helps Dany (and Missandei) understand fully how Grey Worm feels.Â Like Grey Worm may even be the one to mention it. "One of Unsullied was caught in brothel."Â 
Dany: "But why? In a brothel? They cannot feel..."
Grey Worm: "He wished simply to lie with them and feel their company....*meaningful look at Missandei*"
Â 
I really think thats how thats gonna happen.
Â 
Anyway, the Jon scene kinda let me down cuz they are still not looking like they are preparing for a massive battle at the Wall. Oh well.Â 
Â 
Moat Cailin, we did need a hint as to why those Ironborn were sick and many dying. Come on, a bogdevil drop could have been hella neato.Â 
Â 
While i loooooooooved Sansa's stuff, im still kind of on the fence about the costume change. It feels so sudden~ I understand the imagery its invoking (and im pretty cool with that) and what it means for her. Im just still kinda coming to terms with the look and style.Â 
Â 
Not gonna lie, kinda wanted the cornball "ELIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!" scream from Oberyn. Oh well.
3934	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	Also...Roose Bolton's 3 o'clock shadow/beard. Â This is totally a stupid nitpick but he looks depressed or something. Â Maybe it's stressful being Warden of the North. Â 


lol im not liking scruffy Roose either. He needs a shave. I dont think Beard of Absolute Villainy works on him.

Â 
Agreed. Â Much cooler when he looks like Vladimir Putin. Â
3936	High Sparrow Little Bird	2014-06-02	In my opinion, the show is making Littlefinger take bigger risks because I feel one of his risks is going to backfire on him. It all started with his interaction with Cersei in Season 2 "Power is Power".
3937	Young Nan	2014-06-02	I forgot about whore burps. Â I hated that scene. Also how there are only two songs that exist in Westeros. Â I knew he was going to say "bear and the maiden fair". Â
3938	Skore	2014-06-02	Beetles and the Missandie/Grey Worm scenes are my only nitpicks.
Â 
Apart from Jaime's dusty fuck, the rest of the dialogue was stupid and I don't understand why they need to be inventing ex-slave romances, particularly when one of the lovers lacks the full set of equipment.
3939	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-06-02	Â I don't understand why they need to be inventing ex-slave romances, particularly when one of the lovers lacks the full set of equipment.


Â 
...or any discernible personality.
3940	Simon Steele	2014-06-02	Â 
I know, right? Tytos really let Casterly Rock go to shit.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Agreed about the Missandei thing. It's like they even forget what they write. Back in s3 they said the Unsullied were castrated cock and balls. Hell, Missandei herself said it as she was translating for Kraznys!
Â 
And they forgot that Robin and Lysa used to live in KL as well
Â 
Mace was there watching the duel, by the way, but I didn't see Margaery. The Tyrells always seem to vanish during the last episodes. It was the same last season


Â 
Okay, at least Mace was there. I liked the duel, but as much as I did, it really needed more buildup--I think throwing us back into in the last 10 minutes after Oberyn's awesome talk with Tyrion last episode was a huge disservice to the character. He needed buildup, he needed to be more underdog, and it needed to be less gory. I know the book was gory too, but seeing it on the screen cheapened it.
Â 
Back to the Missandei thing--I am rereading A Storm of Swords right now and just read that part where Daenerys is negotiating for the Unsullied, and the book definitely says everything is removed. I am glad you confirmed that season 3 did this too. I have a sneaking suspicion the writers are going to retcon this so Greyworm can have some romance.
3941	Daenor	2014-06-02	I just watched the episode so i haven't read the previous 12 pages of posts.Therefore please forgive me if people have already mentioned what i'm gonna write(well actually it's bitching):
What's going on with the Stark children???????In the books out of the 4 , 3 are presumed dead and one to be a fugitive.Very few people know the truth.And what do we have in the show?All Stark kids to be alive and all Westeros will know that if they keep announcing themselves inÂ  publiv wherever they go.What's the point of such a huge change?How the hell does it serve the plot or makes it more interesting?
And what's that lame thing with a romance including a eunuch?I guess D&D got jealous of Peter Jackson "Hey that dude can have a dwarf-elf romance in Tolkien's world??Well we're gonna surpass him by having a romance between a hot girl and a eunuch". But hey that leaves some very good options open.Like ,now that magic is coming back because of the dragons, GreyWorm will have man's parts again!Daenerys Stormborn,Khaleesi,Mother of Dragons,Mother of Dicks.
Seriously now, with all those changes at least i don't think we'll have spoilers from WoW since the show writers will make their very own story in the end.

Â 
I don't think we got that line. Â 
Â 
I loved that line because he literally does haunt him in the afterlife (and Tywin if you subscribe to that theory).
Â 
Although, when Oberyn suddenly yells "YOU KILED HER CHILDREN!" I got goose bumps. The acting was flawless and Ellaria spoke for the audience with her reaction.

3943	Tywin	2014-06-02	That beetles dialogue was completely crap. Even Peter Dinklage's talent couldn't dress it up.
Â 
Petyr Baelish being at the mercy of Sansa Stark. No, no and no. Littlefinger would never get into such a situation without having thought out the repercussions.
Â 
Had the following scene when he enters her chamber been more a 'well done my pupil' as opposed toÂ  'why did you help me?' it would have been consistent with the idea of him slowly grooming her.
Â 
Daenerys' reaction to Jorah betraying her. Cold anger from her and nothing more. Acting for Jorah was great. You could see that the decisions he made weighed heavily on him and he looked tortured for it. Daenerys was just... coldly pissed. If they'd given a bit more spotlight on her to make it seem as if she was troubled or saddened I'd have been fine with it.
Â 
Â 
Theon/Reek still doesn't look as physically decrepit as I'd like to see him. Alfie Allen does well enough, but it's not enough for me if I am honest.

I do feel it is time to point out two things......first, the heart can't be castrated away. Â I think Missandei has touched him, and I suppose it would only be natural to wonder what he is missing.

Come on peoples - that was the whole point of the "pillar and stones" conversation. If the pillar was removed, but the stones remain, then the hormones will flow... That actually makes it a pretty interesting, if not unique, love (lust?) story. The desire is there, but, well, how to proceed?

3954	ground_control	2014-06-02	Did the beetles ate the gold of Casterly Rock?


Lol @ Golden Dung Beetles
Â 
Golden Dung Beetles are hatched from gold created when a Lannister shits, and they eat regular gold. Â Tywin had assigned Orson as the Chief Underbeetler, and he was responsible for destroying the beetles before they could eat the gold out of the mines. Â Tyrion failed to figure out Orson's true purpose, so when Orson died, and Tyrion was in charge of the drains, he failed to replace Orson, and the beetles subsequently overran the mines.

I won't argue that Grey Worm can't feel attached to Missandei, of course he can, I would just argue that he shouldn't desire her.
Come on peoples - that was the whole point of the "pillar and stones" conversation. If the pillar was removed, but the stones remain, then the hormones will flow... That actually makes it a pretty interesting, if not unique, love (lust?) story. The desire is there, but, well, how to proceed?If anything, they'll remove the testicles and leave the penis. There's no point to cutting someone's penis off other than to cause them pain and stop them from having sex. Why on earth would the Masters do this? The point of castrating the Unsullied is to remove sexual desire, which could affect their discipline. To do this, you need to remove the testicles.
I'm no biologist, for the record, so if there's anyone more learned than me here, please correct me if I'm wrong.

yeahÂ this. I also get the beef that theres a little too much time on it. But ehh. Im ok with GW/Missandei overall.

Â 
You're going to have to explain that one to me; the brain doesn't produce testosterone. I won't argue that Grey Worm can't feel attached to Missandei, of course he can, I would just argue that he shouldn't desire her.

Yeah see im not so sure he does desire her like that. Hes seeing her naked body and experiencing feelings for her. Hes not a dumbass so he can make the connection that an Ordinary Man would feel a more base attraction and i think hes trying to figure out what that feels like. That and hes coming to terms that he is likely in love with her and if he could give her that one thing she might want. (spoiler: he really cant.) Their conversation afterwards sorta spells that out for us. Missandei doesnt feel shame anymore for his peeping because he really isnt leering at her. There was another thought process there and its a deeper, more honest type of attraction. She knows this. This is why she goes "Im glad you saw me."
3959	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-02	Yeah I should've known. 
You're going to have to explain that one to me; the brain doesn't produce testosterone. I won't argue that Grey Worm can't feel attached to Missandei, of course he can, I would just argue that he shouldn't desire her.
If anything, they'll remove the testicles and leave the penis. There's no point to cutting someone's penis off other than to cause them pain and stop them from having sex. Why on earth would the Masters do this? The point of castrating the Unsullied is to remove sexual desire, which could affect their discipline. To do this, you need to remove the testicles.
I'm no biologist, for the record, so if there's anyone more learned than me here, please correct me if I'm wrong.


Â 
Well, look......if you don't understand the brain's role in it, I'm afraid I can't help you, nor I am really interested in explaining it. Â There is more to relationships than hormones, granted, they HELP start one but there is more to it than that. Â I've nitpicked all over, and I've nitpicked these scenes, nitpicking is not my issue at all, I do it all the time. Â If you don't understand what I mean, I'm pretty sure I don't feel like explaining it.

3960	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-02	Tyrion season 1 I have a sift spot for cripples bastards and broken things
Tyrion season 4 yeah I liked picking on orson with the others it made me fit in


Â 
Oh, yeah, this.
Â 
The thing is, that I have the feeling that this is where Tyrion's arc in the books is heading (for some reason I think he's going to kill Doran MartellÂ   ), but just not yet.
Â 
I think they're rushing his transformation, just like they're doing with Sansa
Â 
Granted, GRRM's character development in the books can be excrutiatingly slow at times, but this "sudden change" approach of the show is not working for me either
3961	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-06-02	Yeah see im not so sure he does desire her like that. Hes seeing her naked body and experiencing feelings for her. Hes not a dumbass so he can make the connection that an Ordinary Man would feel a more base attraction and i think hes trying to figure out what that feels like. That and hes coming to terms that he is likely in love with her and if he could give her that one thing she might want. (spoiler: he really cant.) Their conversation afterwards sorta spells that out for us. Missandei doesnt feel shame anymore for his peeping because he really isnt leering at her. There was another thought process there and its a deeper, more honest type of attraction. She knows this. This is why she goes "Im glad you saw me."I've done some thinking, and I've decided that you're right. It's absolutely possible for him to be attracted to her, just not in a sexual way. Upon reflection, the staring was probably not a sexual thing.

3962	Alia Atreides	2014-06-02	Â 
I do feel it is time to point out two things......first, the heart can't be castrated away. Â I think Missandei has touched him, and I suppose it would only be natural to wonder what he is missing. Â It seems his heart his telling him so. Â Also, not that I begrudge a nitpick, especially being as I think these scenes took up too much time THIS WEEK, but I do feel it is time to point out: Â The greatest sexual organ is: Â The Brain. Â 
Â 
Still, I'm wishing they hadn't given so much time to all of it, not this past week anyway. Â 


Â 
I didn't quite look at it that way until you pointed it out like this; I was seriously confused on the whole thing since he doesn't have an testosterone for any sexual feelings but yes what about the heart what is it telling them both. Â I do agree way too much time was spent on something that can't ever be at least on that level.Â
3963	The Emberheart	2014-06-02	I wonder if the beetle scene was actually ad-lib. It feels like Peter and Nikolaj having some giddy fun after being told they need to stretch filler scene by being creative. I guess the whole meaning is double. Tyrion has a sympathetic heart, while Cregor likes to kill stuff in horrible fashion because he too was probably dropped on the head.
On Grey Worm, I don't know. My old neighbours have a cat, he's fully castrated. Yet still he tries to hump the other cats. I think the whole Grey Worm scene is meant to depict pure love: he can't think with his willy, so it's purely from the heart or something. But I don't know if I want Grey Worm to be a round character, he seems so perfect as the flat character you love for how he is.

3964	The ~ Red ~ Viper	2014-06-02	The daenerys scene with jorah at first a thought she couldn't look him in the eye but on my second viewing I noticed he wasn't even in the same room when filming and they fucked the scence up and couldn't re do it the duel was good but rushed in the book he tires the mountain out on the show the viper would of tired himself out if that went longer and the beatles scene was not needed a wasted scene when we could of had him and the viper talking people say it meant something but at the end even tyrion said what was that all about so even he didn't know

3965	new djinn	2014-06-02	Lol @ Golden Dung Beetles
Â 
Golden Dung Beetles are hatched from gold created when a Lannister shits, and they eat regular gold. Â Tywin had assigned Orson as the Chief Underbeetler, and he was responsible for destroying the beetles before they could eat the gold out of the mines. Â Tyrion failed to figure out Orson's true purpose, so when Orson died, and Tyrion was in charge of the drains, he failed to replace Orson, and the beetles subsequently overran the mines.


So, another reason for Tywin to hate Tyrion. He truly is the ruin of House Lannister!
3966	Bowen	2014-06-02	I'm afraid if you've read the books it's impossible not to nitpick but I reckon I'd still be nitpicking had I never read the books based on the drop in performces since season one actually?
One thing we know about D&D is they will NEVER do subtlety,Sansa becoming bat woman in three days is just mental and ridiculous,it sort of casts her as a villain whereas in the books she's well at the mercy of Littlefinger with his plans to marry her to Harry the Heir ect.
Missandie is eleven in the books,totally pointless that crap with Grey Worm even if there is a point to it.
Sam is bugging me too,give him a book or something to study rather than moan about Gilly.
Overall I'd say Theon scene was good but I'd of liked a Bog Devil but overall it was good.
Oberyn and the Mountain scene was good though,the work with that spear was mega but I don't understand why he never picked up Gregors sword?
It was as upsetting as the books though on reflection.
I truly don't want to be nitpicking on here but D&D are getting soo bad aren't they?

Â 
Honestly, I'm talking about imagination vs mindless f*cking on one point, but if you want to, we could get technical and start analyzing three glands off the top of my head..........like the pineal gland, the pituitary gland, the thyroid......just for starters, and all the different hormones they put out. Â But, I find it hard to believe that the idea that the imagination can play a part in wanting to do something for or with someone you love, or care about, regardless of testosterone, or tons of estrogen for that matter, that hard to fathom? Â If you want to bring hormones into it, I'd be glad to go get my daughter, she's better at that then I am......but, it's my understanding that there are lots of things science and medicine do not understand about the brain........and ALL the glands throughout the entire body, and the parts they play in many things.

It must be a freezeframe because HBO is credited under the picture of well, the not so special, special effects. Â Did someone really freezeframe and find this shot of the Oberyn mask all mushed up? Â You have to scroll down all the pictures. Â
3969	Croyd	2014-06-02	I forgot about whore burps. Â I hated that scene. Also how there are only two songs that exist in Westeros. Â I knew he was going to say "bear and the maiden fair". Â 


I know of 4 songs off the top of my head and I'm sure there are more
1 Reynes of Castemere
2. Bear and the Maiden FAir
3 The Dornishmans Wife
4. The Rat King Cook

Yeah its love and admiration. If Missandei wasnt so calm, so intelligent, and so kind, i dont think Grey Worm would even give her a second thought. He looks at Dany and sees his salvation made flesh. His will to fight and free those in bondage. When he looks at Missandei, hes seeing a reason to be more than just another Unsullied. He sees happiness and peace. Its actually kind of lovely, to be honest. But..kinda in the wrong season. I like the story growing between them but the timing is wrong...
3974	Petyr Patter	2014-06-02	Nitpick with impunity?Â  OK.
I said early in the season that the show should spend less time on Danaerys and more time on her companions.Â  I got my wish, but now I regret it.Â  A romance which cannot be pursued due to outside factors? ClichA©, uninteresting, and almost certainly nothing is going to come of it.Â  Not having a penis is somewhat novel compared to â<U+0080>our families are ancient rivalsâ<U+0080><U+0099> or â<U+0080>I am betrothed to anotherâ<U+0080><U+0099> or â<U+0080>he is immortal and I am not.â<U+0080><U+0099>Â  It doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter, it is still soap opera writing.Â  I think a much better choice would have been to have them interact with Jorah and Barristan discussing Westeros, or the â<U+0080><U+009C>revenge killingsâ<U+0080><U+009D> happening in Meereen.Â 
Emilia Clarkeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s acting is just not showing a lot of range.Â  Everytime she talks, we get one of the three flavors of Danaerys: stoic, angry, or â<U+0080>declarative conversational.â<U+0080><U+0099>Â  Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve complained enough about her performance elsewhere, so just know she didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything for me here.
Are you telling us Missandei, who basically was a sales rep for the Masters of Astapor, doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know the specifics of Unsullied castration?Â  Because of course she does.
Jorah never said the line â<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted to go home,â<U+0080><U+009D> which is how he defended his espionage to Danaerys.Â  Such a poignant line, especially Danaerysâ<U+0080><U+0099>s response, â<U+0080><U+009C>I was going to take you home.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Moleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Townâ<U+0080>¦ I sort of liked this, but I sort of didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.Â  Why are the wildlings killing everybody?Â  It takes away the subtly of their villainy.Â  How about just killing the men.Â  Why kill the prostitutes?
Moat Caitlin was not envisioned properly.Â  It looked like a strong fortressâ<U+0080>¦ but one easily bypassed.Â  I did like the other Theon, Ramsay, and Roose scenes, though.
Sansa had an opportunity to get Littlefinger killed, all she had to do was tell the truth.Â  She didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t take it.Â  If this is suppose to be â<U+0080><U+009C>new Sansa,â<U+0080><U+009D> she is stupider than the old one.Â  Â At least Sansa from season 1 when siding with Joffrey lied by saying she couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t remember what happened.Â  Now, she is actively assisting the villainâ<U+0080><U+0099>s defense by inventing some lies.Â  This isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t being a player, it is still being someoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dupe.Â  Or, put it this way, if Baelish promised to help her if she helps him, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>d all call her an idiot for trusting him.Â  Instead, she helps him without even being asked, apparently.
Hound and Arya.Â  It appears they have written themselves into a corner.Â  Sandor Clegane, a wanted man, just shows up with a girl he claims is the daughter of one of the most famous noblemen in all of Westerosâ<U+0080>¦ albeit dead.Â  There is no way the guy up front just turns around and lets them go.Â  Which means they will be taken to the Eyrie for questioning, at least.Â  Plus, Brienne is probably not to far behind.Â  Actually, it looks like we have a plotline pileup happening in the Eyrie.Â  OK, I am interested in seeing how it all shakes up.
The bug conversation.Â  This is what I call â<U+0080><U+009C>stoner philosophy.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  There is question we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know the answer to.Â  WHOA!Â  No one else seems to be pondering this question.Â  WHOA!Â  The fact I am trying to answer it must mean I am super deep or something.Â  WHOA!Â  Whatever the writers were going for here, they failed.Â  It didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t call back anything, it answered nothing, and went nowhere.Â  This scene is the quintessential filler.
Maestar Pycelle provided over the opening speech?Â  He is a maestar, not a septon.Â  I know the show has Paul Bentley play the High Septon, and he does oration just fine.Â  Did Pycelle need more lines for contract reasons? Â I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know, but doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make sense.Â  Also, Tywin apparently rushed through the ceremony when Pycelle was slow.Â  This is important, this is really important.Â  Plus, no matter what the outcome is probably bad for him.Â  A dead Oberyn means trouble from Dorne.

Â 
That's funny.Â  And yeah, that freezeframe must have been instantaneous on the actual show.Â  I had no idea the Oberyn head prop looked so terrible during the eye gouging bit, or that his chin disappeared, though I loved the look of the overhead shot where he no longer had a head to speak of. (Loved it from a stagecraft perspective, that is)
3977	Edmure's Floppy Fish	2014-06-02	They are 2 different stories! It doesn't bother me that they put new material in. Although littlefingers voice is pathetic! But I don't see much difference in D&d's filler and GRRM's last 2 books. I mean the plot moves at the speed of smell after this season. 
The beetle scene was off, but I think they were trying to say that people in westeros attack and bully the weak.I.e., How tywin, Cersi , and the rest of KL are treating Tyrion unjustly because he is lesser and different and they can, just as his cousin was able to kill beetles so he did.? ?? I don't know, I'm sure some brighter mind could find the message in that dialogue. 
But I don't think D&D are doing a bad job nor do I judge the show based on how closely it stays to the book. In fact, The true test for the show will be D&D cleaning up GRRMS mess plot wise over next season. I wouldn't bash the show just bc it adds new scenes because you can't have an hour of "world building" on a tv show and spend the last 2 minutes moving the plot an inch like the books did with each chapter of the last 2 books.

Â 


Â 
Â 
I was surprised at Pycelle's being the Duel presenter; didn't think that was part of a Maester's duties. Â Wouldn't there be a king's herald or something?
Â 
I did think the discussion of beetles went on far too long, even if was metaphorically interesting. Â Still beetles.
Â 
Sansa might be hedging her bets; keeping Littlefinger alive and at her side as a backup in case the Lords of the Vale decide to marry her off against her will or sell her to Cersei. Â Ditto the Lords of the Vale. Â If she has them both on her side, Sansa has more layers of protection in a world that has destroyed her family and condemned her first to an unhappy marriage and then to death.
Â 
I agree that the guardsman at the gate was colossally stupid. Â Or maybe the writing was. Â An infamous Lannister sword announces that the kid with him is the long-missing Arya Stark, daughter of a fallen Great House and the niece of the late Lady of the Vale and the Guard doesn't order them sent up to the Eyrie for questioning, or at least yell for backup? Â Made no sense.
3979	zaphodbrx	2014-06-02	Filler episode. Ridiculously bad all around.
Â 
A good example of what happens when D&D try to 'write'. They come up with retard stuff like 'nothing is nothing' and beetles beetles beetles.
Â 
I'll just point out one that I don't think has been mentioned yet. If Balon Greyjoy didn't die yet, where is Victarion and his 10,000 strong ironborn army? Not at Moat Cailin apparently.Â

I think they're going to save all the ironborn stuff for season 5, i mean they are going to have to fill it with something. In a season with so many plot climaxes, balon's death can be postponed for more effect.

4. The Rat King Cook
Â 
Anyone know of other songs that I have forgotten?
I know there is more , these are the first that came ot mind.

Yeah I know that.  I should be clearer...I mean in the show version of westeros.   I feel like it shows a lack of creativity that the only two songs they keep mentioning are the bear and rains.
3985	Hound's She-wolf	2014-06-02	Yeah I should've known. 
You're going to have to explain that one to me; the brain doesn't produce testosterone. I won't argue that Grey Worm can't feel attached to Missandei, of course he can, I would just argue that he shouldn't desire her.
If anything, they'll remove the testicles and leave the penis. There's no point to cutting someone's penis off other than to cause them pain and stop them from having sex. Why on earth would the Masters do this? The point of castrating the Unsullied is to remove sexual desire, which could affect their discipline. To do this, you need to remove the testicles.
I'm no biologist, for the record, so if there's anyone more learned than me here, please correct me if I'm wrong.


Â 
Testicles produce the most testosterone but the adrenal glands also produce small amounts of testosterone. Woman obviously do not have testicles but do have a low level of testosterone.

Kinda thought his thing about cousin killing was sorta just that?
3993	Tetro	2014-06-02	Kinda thought his thing about cousin killing was sorta just that?


I guess, I probably mentioned that just because I still can't get over it =D
But it's weird that they would talk about such things, with Jaime mentioning killing cousins, and he has not the slightest emotion showing. What they could have done maybe was Tyrion would actually bring killing cousins up, and Jaime goes pale, Tyrion would follow up by saying "Come on, you didn't actually kill a cousin of ours ?". It would have built up on the anger that Tyrion might feel towards him when Jaime tells him about Tysha (If that scene ever happens).
At least it would have given some point to this whole scene.

3998	Bear Island	2014-06-02	I'm normally not that much of a nitpicker, but although the episode was great from a TV perspective it really irritated me as a book reader.
My first, and biggest gripe:Grey Worm perving on the aged-up Missandrei.
When I first saw it I couldn't believe they were going through with it. I thought it was corny and silly to give Missandrei and Grey Worm their little romance angle in the previous episode, but this took the cake. At first I thought they might be retconning the 'neither root nor stem' thing, but then Dany and Missandrei confirm that actually, no, that's correct. They're cut before the onset of puberty so it makes no sense for Grey Worm to feel aroused by naked Missandrei. I wondered briefly if it was a hint Grey Worm isn't actually a eunuch, but the chat he had with Missandrei afterwards nixes that idea. It's completely shoe-horned in and unnecessary. It feels like that's the only reason they aged up her character, to give her a dumb love story and flash tits. Viewers would probably care about her far more if she was the sweet little girl who Dany let her guard down around and shares her bed with.Over 40 Oberyn-free minutes in an episode called 'The Mountain vs. The Viper'.
They dedicated 5 minutes to the fight, and gave Oberyn only a handful of lines and one brief scene. This was his last episode and I wish they'd taken some time to give us one more scene with Oberyn and the obscenely talented Pedro Pascale. Not anything that would hint at the fact he would be dying, just a scene with him visiting Tyrion or talking with Ellaria about Dorne or his time in the Second Sons, just a little more time with him before they oust him forever.LF having no control over Sansa, who lies to cover up for him.
That was weird for me. In the books Littlefinger has a clear plan as to how to get the Lords of the Vale to do what he wants them to do (arbor gold and lies), and does it very smoothly in a way that makes the Lords of the Vale think the plans and ideas were all their own. Even without Marillion to blame I fully expected to see LF enact his plan to control the Vale, for him to bribe Cobray and then feed them lies and Arbor Gold until he was safe. In the books, he does this without letting Sansa in on his plans in advance and Sansa of course never reveals herself as Sansa.
To see Petyr totally our of control was uncharacteristic for the show, for a man who thrives on unexpected twists and turns. Sansa was way too comfortable lying on the show compared to how she is in the books, and in the books she never really lies of her own volition unless they're small lies she tells herself are 'kindly meant'. It feels like they're setting up Sansa to be Littlefinger's equal or possibly apprentice in a very heavy handed way.Ser Barristan discovering Jorah is a traitor.
From the earlier episodes when Ser Barristan has just joined the Queensguard I'm 99% sure I remember him saying something to Jorah that basically equated to 'I know you were spying on Dany but I'm not telling'. Am I going crazy? I could have sworn Barristan intimated that he knew Jorah hadn't been loyal and told him as much, but when he gets the pardon sent by Tywin he acts as if this is all news to him. I freely admit I could be wrong about this, though.
Speaking of Jorah's dismissal, I expected to actually tear up over it, but to me their responses (Dany's and to a lesser degree Jorah's) didn't get across just how utterly devastated both of them are when this happens. I know Dany manages not to cry and manages to be strong in the book but I didn't see any hint of the panic or fear or hurt or sadness she's struggling to hide, either. Jorah didn't seem like a broken man, either, though he wasn't 100% broken until Yunkai in the books.
ETA: I think people who come to the nitpick with impunity threat to nitpick about people nitpicking should be banned. It's 'nitpick with impunity' and that's what we're doing.Â  
You can write an essay about the things that are wrong with a piece of media but it doesn't mean you dislike it or you're punishing yourself by watching. There was plenty that I liked about the episode too, and I defended it as a whole in one thread. I just like analysing the little details that irk me with other people who like analysing little details that irk them.

I give the show credit when it deserves it, the fight was very satisfying imo and it's probably the strongest rush of emotion I felt with the show so far.

Actually, I just watch the show to hate-watch it. Â It's so bad it makes me want to vomit. Â They have no idea what they're doing and butchering books I've been reading way before the show existed. Â The writing is bad. Â It's mostly filler. Â And they have no respect for GRRM's work. Â If you call almost an hour of bad filler and a lame story about a beetle and a romance between a eunuch and an aged-up girl they're using just to show her tits then that's your deal. Â

Â 
I don't have a a huge issue with aging up Messandi, and I think the commentary on Gray Worm and her would be an interesting story if it didn't lead down the path to some sort of "new" romance; what I have an issue with is that they felt the need to do it THIS episdoe. Which brings be to your point about Oberyn: the fact that the episode only focuses on Obery for about 10 mins altogether is a a major flaw. There was stuff that could have been reduced or cut altogether. Cut the Gray Worm and Messandi storyline and save it for next season. Reduce time spent on the beetles.
Â 
As for the Dany/Jorah scene, I did think it had an emotional punch--particualrly from Iain Glen's performance--but I do wish they had used some of the really hard hitting dialogue from the book. Especially:
"I wanted to go home"
"And I was going to take you there."
That's sort of the core of their relationship, they want the same thing: home. To not have "home" being tossed around in that moment feltÂ  like a bit of a disservice to the scene.

That was a huge down side of Sansa's sudden Power Turn (the other being its suddenness, no buildup from terrified girl to self-possessed new Player in just a day or two).

I believe D&D know Sansa's ending/journey, so maybe down the line there's a ton of material to cover that we simply don't know about. Could be a reason they're flying through her arc.
And most of her current arc is nearly impossible to translate over to television, so ...

It could have been as quick and simple as Kenning telling Theon "your uncle Victarion told us to hold Moat Cailin, so we did."

I was totally taken aback when LF came to her room asking why she saved him.  If they had not done that, and had instead indicated that LF had instructed her to tell the Lords Declarant what she did, it would have been much more believable and in-character for both of them.

The beetle speech was shitty and a total waste of screentime, but it was not nearly as illogical as this.  The second worse thing was Arya and the Hound announcing who they were, and nobody caring.

4021	Bori	2014-06-03	You're going to have to explain that one to me; the brain doesn't produce testosterone. I won't argue that Grey Worm can't feel attached to Missandei, of course he can, I would just argue that he shouldn't desire her.

Well, brain does not produce it, but the supradrenal glands do, in a small amount (and testosteron is produced even in females). However, I agree with you, he shouldn't feel any kind of sexual desire for her. I also do not understand why the unsullied (and Varys, for that matter) have normal deep male voices (the voice break during pubertation is also caused by the male hormones produced in the testicles)...
Â 
More biologist nitpick: the arthropod Tyrion plays with is a woodlouse. Which is a crustacean, not a beetle.

Exactly! Â I believed that I yelped in surprise when LF revealed his lack of knowledge of Sansa's testimony. Â Of course, TV-LF is not as smart as his counterpart in the books, but still...that he'd trust a nervous teenager who just watched him murder her aunt not to fall apart under the inquisition of the Vale-lords is a bit much. Â Can't believe Littlefinger wouldn't think that the Vale lords would bring Sansa in for questioning, either. Â Sheesh.

Â 
Even if LF was taken into custody after Lysa's death, he would have still been able to coach Sansa before they notified the Eyrie of Lysa's fall; since TV-Lysa trailed around without guards or stooges.

I don't see anywhere in the rules stating that I can't come in here and disagree (*ahem* - or "trolling ... " since most people here consider having a different opinion = trolling) with the nitpickings, so I'm not in the wrong - at all.
Â 
I'm more curious about why you sound so mad all the time, but that'll bring the thread off-topic. I'm interested in discussing these nitpickings with those that aren't furious because a television show isn't adapting your beloved books (terrible after ASoS and GRRM's shitty prose doesn't help - but, again, off-topic) word-for-word.


Â 
Most of us are furious because the show pales in comparison to OTHER TV SHOWS. If you put the beetle monologue or Grey Worm/Missandei beside anything from Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Wire, or The Sopranos, it would be clear how poor the quality of the show has truly become.
Â 
And here's the thing: had they stuck to the book, the show would easily stand alongside the best TV dramas, and potentially even surpass them.

Â 
That was a huge down side of Sansa's sudden Power Turn (the other being its suddenness, no buildup from terrified girl to self-possessed new Player in just a day or two). Â I find it hard to believe that Littlefinger did not prepare Sansa for the testimony he had to know she would be compelled to give. Â They could have worked it in by having Sansa deviating from LF's planned testimony and deciding on her own to reveal her identity. Â 


Â 
this so much. the show makes littlefinger all-powerful then has him be completely non-existent in his own defense for murder? that was really poorly done. i like this solution much more since it makes sansa's move far more of a powerful strategic move than how it was shown on the show.
4026	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-06-03	Mormont says "This is the work of kywin Lannister" not Tywin, this really bugs me.How could they not hear that and do a retake.

I only watched the episode once but in the same scene the first time Dany says Drogo I swear she says  Drago

Â 
Yes, this is true. Â Compared to those types of shows the dialogue is pretty bad. Â If it was taken from the books, however..it could be a different story. Â I was just watching some of The Sopranos tonight, my favorite show ever, and the quality between the two isn't even close. GoT had potential to be so much more than it is and it failed hard.Â

Â 
This is a consistent theme with d&d. Â Jon Show is a consistent example since Season 2.
Â 
The whole wall stuff is AGAIN a complete disaster. Â WTF is going on there, Jon hasn't mentioned his brother. Â He takes a raiding party 65 miles to Crasters and comes back and no one notified Moles town about the killer wildlings that are loose.Â 
Â 
Sam decides to send Gilly there to be safe, but doesn't tell them either. Â 
Â 
Then they just decide Locke is a throwaway. Â 
Â 
Apparently, as long as they keep showing the major battles and amazing settings, people will keep watching so they have no incentive to keep any character or stryline consistency.

That pardon showing up out of the blue was worse that the entire wall debacle. Â I forgot about that.
4034	Bear Island	2014-06-03	Â 
I don't give a shit if he does or doesn't. He's pulling the same shit I am by relentlessly quoting my posts and telling me to get out. I found it to be funny.
Â 
I actually came in this thread specifically to nitpick (and I did - I had issues with how they set up Littlefinger), but I also saw a bunch of responses that I disagreed with, so I felt like responding. Your assumption that I came in here to annoy (because I'm annoyed by) nitpickers is completely off-base.



I actually made no such assumption, and the fact that you posted criticism wasn't lost on me. I was just responding to what you said here.
I was stunned when it was revealed LF wasn't behind Sansa's lies too. I was genuinely stunned. I never thought for a second they'd take away his control and it was the worst thing in the episode as far as I'm concerned. Grey Worm was a close second but at least that's not basically undermining the story in a significant way.
4035	King Tam Stark	2014-06-03	I still don't like where they have taken The Hound and Arya and wonder where exactly they are taking it but I did actually like Arya's laugh and I did like Sansa's dress it's the first time I've found her to be attractive.
Â 
Meereen is just stupid the GW/Missandei romance is pointless filler when so much interesting stuff is happening elsewhere and the worse of all was Dany doing Missandei's hair. Is this the same Dany who is staying in Meereen to rule but is now doing a slaves hair?
4036	zaphodbrx	2014-06-03	I should have realized something was very very wrong, when the episode started out on burping whores. Trust me, you can only go downhill from there.
Â 
Might be wrong about this but I think almost every bad episode also started out bad. As far as I recall, 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair' started out with Blackfish interrupting Cat and the Talisa butt scene. 'The Night Lands' started out with 10 minutes of Ros and LF spying on a dude spying on some sex.

This is what hurts the most, season 1 was at that level of show. The rest have been abysmal. Like comparing the Da Vinci Code to Foucault's Pendulum when you look at the writing for GoT compared to Mad Men. And lol at the trolls in here.
4038	mormont	2014-06-03	[mod] Drop the bickering.

4039	Viserion12	2014-06-03	You people are a bunch of whiney bitches.
Â 
The beetle speech is a reference to common people and howÂ Tyrion knows the past follies of rulers and cruelty to common people, and he has learned to be better hence not squashing the beetle.Â  It's all a lead into his future role as Dany's future Hand of the Queen.
Â 
For all the haters: Try and write yourself, sense you are all experts. I bet it will be crap, unless you plagiarize Martin's words.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
The funny thing about writing a show based off his book, is that you're ALLOWED to plagiarize Martin's words! Â I think everyone's points about this beetle scene is that there is so much (existing) great material that they could have used to set up the duel, but instead they fabricated this weird and way-too-long story about beetles. Â I see the metaphor. Â But they could have used a much clearer and concise metaphor. Â 
Â 
I also think it's a little far out to be prepping Tyrion as Daenerys' Hand in the show watcher's mind's. Â They wont make the connection between this scene and his selection as Hand, because that is most likely far off. Â That's a weak excuse to include this scene.
4040	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-03	Just rewatched the episode finally, and I think my main nitpicks are still.....entirely too much beetle time, entirely too little Viper time.Â  Why am I now hearing Hammer Time in my head?Â
4041	Cas Stark	2014-06-03	I didn't mind Arya laughing. Â I do mind them showing up and announcing their true identities and then somehow getting away and no one knowing about it...which is certainly going to happen.
Â 
The only way to deal with the Sansa/LF change is to do some mental gymnastics, such as LF had a plan for either the truth or her backing him...or that he was sure she would back him...except that they didn't act the subsequent scene in that manner, but in the manner that he isn't sure why she supported him...so, pretty bad characterization....the puppetmaster of Westeros, when faced with his most public and serious obstacle....he only hopes Sansa will help him. Â LOL Whatever.
4042	Hound's She-wolf	2014-06-03	If it's nitpicking we're talking...

Â

Â 
For a man that was suppose to be a walking bag of silver, Sandor was pretty vocal about who they were, wasn't he? They were also the most un-informed people in the Vale. Biter and Rorge knew more intel than they did, how did they make it to the Bloody Gate without hearing ANYTHING about Lysa's death?
Â 


Â 
Â 
That pardon showing up out of the blue was worse that the entire wall debacle. Â I forgot about that.


Â 
Â 
I think Jorah was right and that was sent by Tywin to Meereen a couple episodes ago. Tywin did that to cause discord and break up Dany's small group of advisors.
4043	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-03	I didn't mind Arya laughing. Â I do mind them showing up and announcing their true identities and then somehow getting away and no one knowing about it...which is certainly going to happen.

I did just rewatch and I noticed something in relation to the LF and Sansa spilling the truth scene.Â  As she was continuing to tell her story, I did notice some subtle pride coming from him.Â  As if.......perhaps he didn't know exactly what she would do but may have suspected?Â  The more she continued, the more he couldn't look at her without aÂ hint of pride or admiration?Â  Then again, I might have just enjoyed the subtety of silent Littlefinger?Â  When he's silent....he's not doing his gravely Batman voice, it could have been that, Lol

Â 
Those two lines were a LOT better than what we had in the show. Â Again, no reason not to use them, they're good, they're simple and straighforward and convey a lot of meaning.

Oh well. Â That's D&D for you. Â Why eat the filet mignon you've got in the fridge when you can order pizza. Â

Â 
That's what I thought when I watched it as well initially. Â He watches her and is confirming to himself what a good teacher he is and what a nice pupil he's got.....but, then, the scene later is all wrong for that, or at least sort of wrong for that. Â Plus, D&D, let's face it, they are not that subtle. Â
4046	R'hllor the Fabulous	2014-06-03	The fight felt very anticlimactic to me. There was no real buildup in the episode which removed a lot of tension it could have had. I also found the lack of music jarring, the lack of music can work. But when there's no tension it just becomes pointless.
The actual fight itself left a lot to be desired, the mountain wasn't scary at all. In the books he's a, well... mountain of a man. And not just that, he's covered from head to toe in plate armour. In the show he has aÂ  poor excuse for armour, and a laughable helmet which he loses within 5 seconds.
In the books we know Oberyn is very skilled because he actually manages to injure the mountain while he's wearing full plate armour, instead we just get a lot of unnecessary spear twirling, because that displays actual combat skill, I guess. Also, Oberyn's "armour" was completely pointless, normal leather isn't going to stop anything, let alone a sword. He'd actually be better off not wearing anything.
And last but not least, the Mountain couldn't even hold a sword properly, it looked so terribly awkward.
Â 
Oh well, Oberyn's death was done decently enough.
4047	Miodrag	2014-06-03	I don't remember Tywin writing a letter the other episode, but if he did, and if it really was about Jorah's pardon that Tywin used to cause the rift in Dany's camp, then it has to be one of the absolutely stupidest tings ever designed in this show. Like, how the hell would that idea even work in Tywin's head, especially with the information he has? It's on par with the Locke's "plan" for kidnapping Bran from the Craster's.
Â 
Speaking of Tywin, after this episode I hope nobody will ever claim Charles Dance "brings Tywin to life". It doesn't have to be Dance's fault, because he doesn't write the scripts (even if it is true that he's not a stranger to blackmailing writers into giving him more screen-time), but TV Tywin is an uninteresting, unbelievable, inconsistently written and ultimately flat creation that seems unable to respond to anything: if Oberyn's public accusations and death sentence for Tyrion can't make him abandon the protocol just a little, I'm curious to find out how are the show-writers going to make his affair with Shae work at all.
Â 
As for the beetles scene, the fact that the couple of incompetent writers thought this monologue is a good way to impress award juries doesn't mean the monologue isn't awful. Because it is. If you take a character, and build him as a hero of your show for more than three seasons, and have him facing death for at least fourth time, and you can't come up with anything more imaginative than a sudden revelation that it's oh-so-dreadful to be not in control of your own fate, and you can't think of any better way to convey that conclusion than a mockery of a character that is so unimportant he actually doesn't exist outside that monologue... well, sorry, but writing is definitely not something you excel in.
4048	Jamie Lannister	2014-06-03	Why did they give us that beetle story instead of fleshing out Tyrion and Oberyn's partnership a bit more? Why didn't Oby put forward the prospect of Tyrion travelling to Dorne with him to make Myrcella the queen and take over CR?

Hell with that bullshit, KRUNK KRUNK KRUNKÂ

Like, how the hell would that idea even work in Tywin's head, especially with the information he has?


Â 
I thought that as well. It just seemed really stupid that Tywin's big plan to deal with Dany is to make her and Jorah have an argument. It's not like Jorah's a renowned fighter/military genius/political mastermind anyway. It just seemed really stupid to me.

Â 
Does Tywin even know the extent of Dany and Jorah's realtionship? ie: does he know how devoted Jorah is? Because if Tywin's goal is to rip them apart, he'd have to have some sort of information that Jorah was more than just a part of her guard. He'd have to know how deeply Dany trusts him and what sort of emotional effect learning of Jorah's betryal would cause her.

What is more, why would Tywin expect Dany to believe the letter?Â  All Jorah had to do is say "This is an obvious and clumsy plot to sow discord between us, why else will they it?" and everyone would've believed him that the pardon was forged.

Â 
Not really, Jorah's reaction to Barristan was pretty telling, as well as his awareness that Robert hated Targaryens and would have them all killed makes it all pretty plausible. He's asked on the spot and didn't want to lie to the woman he loved, and instead thought to reason with her/ask for forgiveness. It happens literally every day, not everyone is a lying shit when confronted with their past. Jorah is certainly not the type to lie to Dany anymore.
4055	ground_control	2014-06-03	Just rewatched the episode finally, and I think my main nitpicks are still.....entirely too much beetle time, entirely too little Viper time.Â  Why am I now hearing Hammer Time in my head?Â 



Â 

Every time you see me
The Viper's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm poison on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With Tywin claiming orders that just don't fit
I've toured around Essos, from Braavos to the Bay
It's "Viper, go Viper, The Red Viper, yo Viper"
And the rest can go and play
4056	Matthew Marzolf	2014-06-03	Â 
I was just thinking "why"? Â How about some Northern lords instead. Â Or I might have been thinking 'why doesn't she just bash Talisa's head in right now?"
Â 
It beats the hell out of me how they are going to make Jon's rejection of Stannis offer have any meaning, other than ignore the fact that Jon Snow would never even consider usurping his brother's place for a nanosecond. Â Again, stupid move that didn't even serve any dramatic purpose in the show...Jon knows Bran is alive, so what? Â He's not doing jack about it, is he?
Â 
I can't see how Stannis and his new Braavosi army of sellswords, I guess?, showing up in the nick of time to save the Wall is going to be anything but abrupt and a head scratcher....because apparently Red Dress cracking jokes and taking a bath was more central to the plot than a couple of lines on the North....


Â 
Here's my theory on how the show will handle that. There's no Wex, right? Instead of Manderlay producing Wex for Davos, Stannis will offer Jon Winterfell, Jon will tell Stannis Bran (and maybe Rickon?) is alive and Stannis will send Davos - either to Manderlay to offer finding Bran for his help or simply send Davos to find Bran and sway the northern Lords to his side, eliminating Manderlay at all. Thoughts?
4057	BearQueen87	2014-06-03	Â

It happens literally every day, not everyone is a lying shit when confronted with their past. Jorah is certainly not the type to lie to Dany anymore.


Â 
I agree. He was hoping that she would forgive him based on everything he's done for her since. And if he had lied, and she found out, it would have been a lot worse in the end. Jorah had a small hope that Dany would recognize how much she needs him.
4058	Ser Not Appearing	2014-06-03	If we're nitpicking, they should have refilmed that laugh from Arya. Just wasn't pulled off well, imo. At all.
4059	Bridgeburners	2014-06-03	I don't get why they didn't do the Arstan Whitebeard approach. It's still a compelling plot element, even if most viewers (or those who care enough to research if they forgot what Selmy looked like in S1) would have known. Just because they lose that twist element for us, that doesn't mean they could have done away with it. In fact, it might have even felt more intriguing to unsullied who realized that Barristan Selmy was in her ranks and thought of how it would play out. His original intention for disguising himself was to trick Jorah, right? So that he can gauge Jorah as a spy without letting Jorah catch on to what he's doing. Then they could have had that double interrogation between Dany and them, which I thought was a fantastic scene. Hell, they didn't even need Strong Belwas for the Whitebeard plot.
Â 
But then, in D&D's minds, if you remove the "twist" aspect of it you have nothing left. They believe that "the twist" is everything in GoT, which is why they poured so much effort into building up Oberyn's character, or building up the romance between Robb and Talisa, etc. The idea that it may just be an intriguing and interesting dynamic that works as a great catalyst for the event of her banishing him is probably lost on them.
Â 
Also they would hate for some of the unsullied to not realize that he's Selmy while others do, because they have to explicitly club us over the head with what's going on all the time. No viewer left behind and whatnot.Â

4060	solidviper	2014-06-03	Besides the brotherly love between him and Jaime, I hated the beetle scene. Lasted too long, and I felt like I didn't get the point.Â 
Â 
The Dany/Jorah scene felt anti climatic as well.Â
4061	Ser Not Appearing	2014-06-03	Nitpicking GRRM, I still dislike the Jorah dismissal. A lot. The guy was working towards something for years, had orders from possibly the most powerful man in the world and betrayed it all for her. Granted that Dany isn't the sharpest tool in the she'd but I struggle to accept that she doesn't see through this very standard and lame storytelling device.
Lol at trusting Barristan and not Jorah. I just struggle with this plot point.
4062	El Guapo	2014-06-03	Â 
Does Tywin even know the extent of Dany and Jorah's realtionship? ie: does he know how devoted Jorah is? Because if Tywin's goal is to rip them apart, he'd have to have some sort of information that Jorah was more than just a part of her guard. He'd have to know how deeply Dany trusts him and what sort of emotional effect learning of Jorah's betryal would cause her.


Â 
He was basing that off of Varys who told him at the small council meeting that Jorah was completely devoted to Dany.
4063	BearQueen87	2014-06-03	I think one of the biggest problems with the Jorah/Dany scene (and there are a few problems as many of us have pointed out) goes back to a choice the writers made in S2 which was to not show the full extent of the House of the Undying. The prophecies Dany gets in that chapter affect her. She becomes rather obsessed with trying to figure it out, and wants to put everyone she meets into a tiny box to match the prophecy. In the book, during the Jory dismissal, her internal monologue really reflects her conflict over how she cares for Jorah vs. what this might mean vis a vis the prophecy and future betrayal. Her hatred for anything Lannister or Baratheon clouded her judgement here. The show hasn't done a good enough job of showing how the prophecy affected her and how literally she takes it because they short changed the HofU scene like crazy (still bitter about that one).
Â 
So the whole Dany/ Jorah exchange in this episode comes across and sudden and confusing (because WTH was Tywin thinking??) and feels like they need to create conflict of Dany and Jorah to push into S5 but there is no real understanding of why Dany let him go.
4064	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-03	Nitpicking GRRM, I still dislike the Jorah dismissal. A lot. The guy was working towards something for years, had orders from possibly the most powerful man in the world and betrayed it all for her. Granted that Dany isn't the sharpest tool in the she'd but I struggle to accept that she doesn't see through this very standard and lame storytelling device.
Lol at trusting Barristan and not Jorah. I just struggle with this plot point.


Â 
I don't understand how hard it would be to say "Look, before I met you or had any reason to care about you, a man approached me saying I would be able to return to my home and restore some honor to my name and House by selling information about you. I don't know any man who could turn that down. When I got to know you, and learned that Robert had meant to poison you and your child, I betrayed him for you. I gave up home, redemption with my father, seeing my family again, all because I came to love you and would die for you. I stopped selling information entirely and have been your faithful man since. I'm sorry for how we came to meet, but ultimately it was a blessing since I got to follow who I think should be the monarch in Westeros and you received your most loyal advisor."
Â 
Sure she can be pissed off, and even punish him, but there's like no opportunity to talk sense. It's like those cheesy 80's/90's teen shows where the girl freaks out after finding out the guy only started dating her because of a bet or something stupid.
4065	BearQueen87	2014-06-03	Â 
He was basing that off of Varys who told him at the small council meeting that Jorah was completely devoted to Dany.


Â 
Ok, yes. But that doesn't mean that Tywin understands how Dany will react. Jorah being deovted to Dany is great, but neither Tywin nor Varys udnerstand Dany's psychology and how much she trusts Jorah, right? And how this betrayal will affect her?

yes, this. In the book, IMO, Dany's anger is a bit more understandable because of all the prophecy but also because GRRM really drives home her hatred of all things Lannister and Baratheon.

Â 
That's true I didn't think of that, but it still felt like a evil witch outfit more than a mourning outfit (maybe it was due to her evil grin?). It does make me feel better now that you said that tho.Â 
Â 
I'm not against Sansa's character change (I don't mean from the books), though. I thought she got a lot more agency and did what was best for her this time around. Â She showed the audience how smart she is for sure.Â

Â 
It might have been the mourning colors for her aunt, but it was the design of the dress, coupled with the slow motion-esque staircase descent and the Sansa/LF scene before where she has the upper hand. The dress scene felt more "evil" than just simple "I am in mourning clothing"

Â 
That's just your mind taking something simply. Who says Sansa is going to start being bad? She went from being a girl to a woman (maturity wise), accepted her fate and decided to roll with it rather than complain and brood. She's not wearing, for example, a pink cloak with drops of blood on it that features the likeness of a man hanging upside down with skin literally peeled off him, you know, something that would make the bad guys seem to obvious. /rolleyes.

There's also the element that, in the book, Jorah admits to having informed on her as late as when they were in Quarth, and I remember her thinking how shocked she was because she assumed he stopped well before that. Plus he was very belligerent, refusing to ask for forgiveness and basically sticking to his justification, all the while bitter about her acceptance of Barristan who made his relent very gracefully. The contrast between the two was palpable.Â

Â 
Yeah, book! Jorah is very different in the scene than show! Jorah. But that's not really new with Jorah, I guess. However, I do wonder if the writers moved away from GRMM's version for a specific reason (outside of pretty actors having chemistry together so give them drama!)--like Jorah and Dany meeting again in WOW, ect.

Â 
Like I said, I like her character getting some power for a change. I like her even plotting for her own safety. I think all that is cool and interesting, but the Final Fantasy VIII costume just felt cheesy like I could see it on Charlize Theron in the Snow White movie.
4078	Petyr Patter	2014-06-03	For a man that was suppose to be a walking bag of silver, Sandor was pretty vocal about who they were, wasn't he? They were also the most un-informed people in the Vale. Biter and Rorge knew more intel than they did, how did they make it to the Bloody Gate without hearing ANYTHING about Lysa's death?


Â 
I actually thought that this was the best way to initiate the ransom.Â  The only way to reach the Eyrie and Lysa was through the Bloody Gate.Â  A really intelligent character might have thought of a lie to get them through without revealing the game, but Sandor isn't and the truth should work.Â  Admittedly, he is making himself vulnerable.Â  The captain could just order the men to shoot the Hound and take custody of Arya himself.Â  Of course, that would be random, nonhonorable, and capricious.Â  Still, a risk.Â 
Â 
Regardless, I'd say the strategy worked to well.Â  Even with Lysa dead, the Lord of the Vale is Arya's cousin.Â  There is still no reason for them to not present themselves and at least ask for a ransom.Â  Actually, I would love to see the Arya and Robin discussing execution strategies.Â  Moondoor versus stabbing?
Â 
I would go so far as to say the writer's have written themselves into a corner.Â  How will Sansa and Arya avoid meeting without some huge plot contrivance?Â

Â 
Actually, it would be utterly cheesy and teen-show-ish if Jorah suddenly became so calm and reasonable and astute, and respond to Dany the way you suggest. In essence, it would be throwing away everything his character represented up to that point. Thankfully, Martin uses the characters he created in a very natural way, which is why his Jorah acts in that situation the same way he always acts, because he desires Dany the way he desired anyone and everything else in his life. And that's how he loses her, too. As for TV Jorah, well, I'm not so sure about him. Nor about TV Dany. In the show, yeah, it kinda looks like those cheesy 80's/90's teen shows.
4081	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-06-03	I don't remember Tywin writing a letter the other episode, but if he did, and if it really was about Jorah's pardon that Tywin used to cause the rift in Dany's camp, then it has to be one of the absolutely stupidest tings ever designed in this show. Like, how the hell would that idea even work in Tywin's head, especially with the information he has? It's on par with the Locke's "plan" for kidnapping Bran from the Craster's.

Â 
I'd say your first reaction was much closer to the truth. Sansa isn't wearing black at the questioning, even though her aunt is already dead. And, when she starts wearing black, Lysa's son doesn't, just like Lysa's husband doesn't, so there's no valid reason to think Sansa's wearing black because of mourning. It's just one more example of this board being much more creative in "explaining" D&D, than D&D are in writing. (Not to mention the possible change in her hair color. I'm still not sure was it a change or some strange effect of light, but if she dyed her hair black too, then the show reached the whole new level of unsubtle.)

Â 
It was a low-cut black dress with feathers in the shape of pauldrons and a high rear neck band.Â  You can't blame people for seeing the witch bit in it.Â 
Â 
I don't know that I'd argue they're showing her being all of a sudden "bad" quite like the above poster, but they are showing a definite and undeniable sea change to the audience, and not just in the dress.Â  The way she says "Shall we go?" has a definitely sly delivery, she has a rather mischievous look in her smile, and make sure to listen to the dramatic musical cue that for some reason suddenly starts playing when she enters the scene and cascades down those steps.Â 
Â 
Or maybe I'm just wrong.Â  Surely, it must be all innocence, nothing very new, just a (mature) woman wearing a simple mourning dress.Â  This show isn't the most subtle in the world about these things.
4087	Buckbeak	2014-06-03	I agree with mostly everyone else about the beetle scene. Did not see where that was heading, then it just cut to another scene and I was like 'eh?'
Â 
I also found the Jorah scene was not portrayed as well as I would have liked. It was a big deal to Dany when he betrayed her, she was just cold and I felt it was rushed.
Â 
The Sansa/LF scene made LF look like he was foolish. My boyfriend has not read the books but even he mentioned that it seemed out of character for Littlefinger to be so unprepared and clueless. LF is so manipulative and devious and I hated how he was portrayed!

Â 
The witch thing never crossed my mind upon watching. If they wanted her to look "evil" or "dark" they didn't do a great job. To me she just looked like someone in a more adult dress (Cleavage) that happened to be black and feature feathers. Since someone linked an article on here about the detail they put into dresses I'm pretty confident the feathers aren't a coincidence. You're not wrong at all, the scene is supposed to mark a change in attitude, maturity, etc., but not a "Sansa is capable of evil now" like everyone seems to think, and honestly it's a really childish way to interpret that scene.
4089	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-03	As much as I enjoyed Sophie's monologue and appreciate the showrunners are trying to speed up her transition from pawn to player, I felt they did Litttle finger a great disservice by placing him entirely in her mercy as if he had no real plan to consolidate his control of the Eyrie. At this point in the books Littlefinger is at his most devious and overtly powerful position manipulating the Lords Declarent- not expecting to be removed as Lord Protector.
Â 
Jorah begging for forgiveness was also a subtle yet significant scene change. Whilst book Dany desperately wanted to forgive him, she felt his stubborn refusal to admit he was wrong could not be overlooked without undermining her authority. In the show, however, the ever haughty Emilia Clarke dismissed him far more ruthlessly as he pleaded for mercy. Of late I have found show Dany to be very irksome, she seems entirely lacking of any warmth or vulnerability and far too black and white in the way she interacts with people.Â 

I agree with all of this. 
Watching it, I was thinking "as if Littlefinger wouldn't already have this situation fully under control before it even began". It was cool to see Sansa being all awesome though.

Here's my theory on how the show will handle that. There's no Wex, right? Instead of Manderlay producing Wex for Davos, Stannis will offer Jon Winterfell, Jon will tell Stannis Bran (and maybe Rickon?) is alive and Stannis will send Davos - either to Manderlay to offer finding Bran for his help or simply send Davos to find Bran and sway the northern Lords to his side, eliminating Manderlay at all. Thoughts?


Â 
If they eliminate Manderlay and "the North remembers" and everything about that chapter I will picket HBO myself.
Â 
So much depends on what hasn't been written yet, ya know? Â I tend to think that Bran isn't coming back from the far North and the Weirwood tree, which means it has to be Rickon on Skagos. Â But since we don't know what happens with Davos and Rickon...who knows.

I don't think there was a Wex, but they could make "Wex" any random IB or just have Davos go to White Harbor to get support from the Northern lords...where he will then learn that Bran and Rickon are alive.
Â 
Well, except that it won't be big news to anyone...since Jon will know it, so presumably Stannis will know it and around and around we go with the butterfly effect.

4097	Bridgeburners	2014-06-03	The Dany & Jorah scene is a great testament to how a show of this scope cannot survive the 10 episode per season 50 minute per episode (yeah, average episodes are around 50 minutes, many are less; it's not a full hour like other HBO dramas) format. Nothing can be set up properly, and all the scenes seem to just happen scattered at random. There was no rift building up between them nor indication in the recent past that Jorah had any remorse over his secret history of being a spy. Yet the writers were thinking "oh shit, we're getting close to the end of season 4, how do we make this happen?" And then BOOM, BOOM, two scenes and five minutes later, Jorah goes from her most loyal advisor to being banished from Mereen forever. And for all we know, this was all the same to Dany as decreeing for a farmer to get triple the price of his burnt sheep.

Good point. in fact, if you're a casual audience member who has not read the books, and all you've seen for the past few seasons now is Jorah doing his hardest to get Dany home and believes in her with his whole heart (his words!), would you even remember the deal he made with KL back in S1?

You're not the only one  I didn't make the witch connection myself. I got what they were trying to do (and I didn't like that Sansa didn't wear black when questioned by the Lords declarants), but I just didn't like her new outfit. But that was just a nitpick

Â 
I believe it's a matter of degrees.Â  There are those of us (I am one) who immediately thought of witches when we saw the outfit just by simple association, but who also didn't think they were necessarily implying that she's now ultra witchy or bad by it.Â  Then there are those who think this is definitely what's going on.Â  Probably a bunch in between, and a bunch like you.

My interpretation, for what it's worth:Â  I think they're showing a Sansa who is now willing to lie (which she does), willing to potentially manipulate others (which she does), and who is learning from Peter, who doesn't hide his amoral tendencies from her even if his goal is unknown to her.Â  The books don't show how far down the road she goes yet.Â  We'll have to see.Â  And yes, the books and show give information differently.Â  But the books are not entirely ahead.Â  The show has hinted at a few things the books haven't yet.Â  For instance, Melisande saying to Arya that they'll meet down the road (presumably after Arya has done with her assassination training).

4107	Miodrag	2014-06-03	Jaime wondered how there is no word for cousin killing, I think kinslayer just about covers it!


Â 
However, the show can't go there. Not after what Jaime did to poor Alton in Season 2. If they start establishing kinslaying now, they'd only reveal how stupid Jaime/Alton scene actually was. Because of that, better not to mention kinslaying at all. D&D are not about to start jeopardizing their reputation.

Â 
Those "Inside The Episode" videos are usually more logical and reasonable and informative and interesting than episodes themselves. It would be cruel to take those away from showrunners.

Â 
It's too bad they didn't have a scene with Oberyn and Elleria before the duel, where this could have been hinted....
Â 
Oh right, i forget, we needed a very long existential beetle monologue and another long segment on Grey Worm and Missandei....
Â 
It's a shame they used the whole 60 minutes too, not a minute to spare.

The reason Jaime brought it up to begin with was because he slew his cousin.Â

4112	Miodrag	2014-06-03	I'm just glad the relatively incompetent and uninteresting Sansa is now a thing of the past.


Â 
TV Sansa uninteresting and incompetent? You're probably not watching the same show as I do. In the show I watch, Sansa thinks "shift" is a vulgar word, is loved and protected by none other than our very own golden-heart-whore Shae, and gets that ever closed Margaery to finally talk about her sex life. And, last but not least, D&D bravely cut that GRRM's nonsense with her and Sandor. Sansa's actually way improved in the show.

4114	Bridgeburners	2014-06-03	I honestly must say I didn't notice Sansa's dress at all... or barely noticed in passing and didn't remember. I'm surprised how much it has gotten mentioned. But then, I'm generally not very fashion conscious.Â

Â 
I think it's a pretty easy to understand concept that before his maiming, if Jaime needed to kill his cousin to get back home to Cersei, he would kill his cousin (That he barely remembers or cares about) but by all means please keep providing these riveting, pedantic comments. As a sidenote, Jaime recalls Alton in episode 1 this year.

I assume you mean TV Jamie, since Book Jamie hasn't killed any of his cousins or turned into a kinslayer, he managed to make it back to his bitch sister without killing any fellow Lannisters. Â Imagine that. Â LOL.

Â 
You obviously don't understand the concept, sir. You're pedantic. And childish.
4121	vividox	2014-06-03	I have only the slightest nitpick with Grey Worm - Missandei scenes. Really don't have a problem with them having a relationship in general (even if he doesn't have a pillar and stones, stranger things have happened in the history of sexual attraction), but the scenes seemed a little dragged out and lengthy for what they were. The View of Missandei was worth it though, IMO.
Â 
Also didn't like the waxing philosophical about the beetles, but for a different reason than most - I just didn't like them painting Tyrion as moping about the unfairness of the world. That doesn't really seem like it's in Tyrion's character to me. At least, not until he starts searching for where whores go.
Â 
Liked pretty much everything else.

Do you really think Jaime wouldn't have killed a distant cousin from a cadet branch of the family if it were his only means of escape (prior to the whole Hoat and Brienne journey) and he was given the chance?

4124	eumaies	2014-06-03	thanks all for this thread.Â  Painful to suffer through the butchering of this show's best raw material alone.
Â 
Now that they've done a truly mediocre viper vs mountain fight and turned Littlefinger into a mastermind with no game plan, they can get on with killing Tywin in nonsensical fashion and then I'll stop watching the show.Â  That they can fail to make a good show out of material this good does not bode well with what they'll do with GRRMs more chaotic future work.

Season 1 was the bomb.Â  Then they just fell apart.Â  Not a great show.Â  Unique, but it's just TV.Â

Â 
kinslaying is a huge taboo in Westeros. Â Even Roose Bolton won't kill his insane serial killer nut job of a son who killed his rightful heir because of the kinslaying taboo. Â So, no, in fact, I don't know if Jamie would have killed his cousin, I do know that the Original Jamie Lannister didn't kill his cousin and so far, isn't a kinslayer. Â It was a stupid change, done for who knows what stupid reason by D&D.

Â 
Kingslaying is pretty taboo also. Roose Bolton didn't need to escape a cell, and he can actually make use of Ramsay. Actually Roose is a bit of a weird example since all of his motivations seem to make little sense. Book Jaime didn't kill his cousin, because God forbid an irresponsible, incestous, arrogant Kingslayer with "Shit for honor" kill a man he barely knew which is obviously a whole lot worse than attempting to kill the child of a great lord, that could have (And basically did) start a massive war, or would have gladly killed that Lord's other child to satisfy his sister. Heaven forbid the showrunners demonstrate that Jaime would do almost anything in his power to get out of his cell and back to his sister, short of killing his brother or the few things/people he actually gives a shit about.

Â 
They showed someone, his squire I assume, wiping the blade with a cloth which i took to be him putting poison on it. I doubt many unsullied viewers picked up on that and made the connection nor do I know if I would have had I not read the books.
4128	Miodrag	2014-06-03	Kingslaying is pretty taboo also.


Â 
Which is probably why Jaime waited until the last possible moment, when literally nothing else could be done about the Mad King.
Â

Â 
You're right. Looks like GRRM is also failing to understand some concepts there.

Â 
And what a fine demonstrations it was! And logical, too! Can't find a single nit to pick - aside from the question you seem to be intent on not answering: what did Jaime kill Alton for exactly? How did that murder get him closer to Cersei?
4129	Wsaharan	2014-06-03	"Ku-GUNNK" - Brace yourselves, gifs are coming.

So here's what we're going to do. We'll take those four awfully long beetle-minutes with Olson or Orson or the fuck his name was and we're gonna put them away for ever.
Insert more pre-duel Oberyn, mention of Rhaegar and the sack of KL.
Please?
Â 

Â
4130	Veltigar	2014-06-03	Yeah, the problem wasn't that Jaime wouldn't kill a random cousin (Alt was so far down that it probably didn't even count as kinslaying). The problem was that Jaime had no fucking reason to kill Alton. I mean why didn't he just tell his plan to Altos and try and escape together?Â
4131	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-03	Â 
If they eliminate Manderlay and "the North remembers" and everything about that chapter I will picket HBO myself.
Â 
So much depends on what hasn't been written yet, ya know? Â I tend to think that Bran isn't coming back from the far North and the Weirwood tree, which means it has to be Rickon on Skagos. Â But since we don't know what happens with Davos and Rickon...who knows.
I don't think there was a Wex, but they could make "Wex" any random IB or just have Davos go to White Harbor to get support from the Northern lords...where he will then learn that Bran and Rickon are alive.
Â 
Well, except that it won't be big news to anyone...since Jon will know it, so presumably Stannis will know it and around and around we go with the butterfly effect.


Â 
LOLand congratulations.Â  You've made me as dizzy as D&D do at times.Â  Still. somehow, someway, I'm thinking we will have to get Manderly eventually.Â  They seem to love Roose, I'm dying to see them all locked in a snowbound Winterfell.Â

Just curious how you didn't notice -- Petyr is talking to Robin when he looks up and sees Sansa enter the scene backlit by a ray of blazing sun, virtually encased in a holy aura. Â She was quite literally more radiant than she has ever been shown before. Â Since it's obviously Petyr's POV, it couldn't have been less subtle unless the show had his jaw drop to the floor and his tongue roll out like a carpet like this:Â http://www.youtube.c...h?v=ZsxCMPQzqvk

Â 
Truth be told, I don't think Jaime would ever find himself in a position to commit kinslaying. He probably would if a kin of his is threatening him (or Cersei) somehow, but that's the thing with kinslaying: it's a product of the family-centered culture that is so meticulously built in the books. That's why kinslaying applies to everyone: not only to Jaime, but to his cousins, too. Not only that kinslaying prevents Jaime from killing a cousing, but it also prevents a cousin from threatening Jaime. It doesn't mean it's impossible for Jaime to find some cousin in his way (for example, a cousin could find out about the twincest), but it'd have to be some drastically unusual and atypical case. And escaping prison is not such a case. Yes, it's terrible to be imprisoned, and Jaime definitely hates it, but it wouldn't be a good enough reason to commit a crime as sinful as kinslaying.
Â 
Of course, the show doesn't have to respect the culture built in the books, just like it often doesn't. I find the show vastly weaker because of it, but OK, let's say stranger things happen. However, Jaime killing the only person that is both willing and capable of helping him in his escape (cousin or not), is just plain stupid. The whole scene was a festival of the worst cliches: million people walking around the pen at one moment, and then not a living soul there at the next; Karstark junior going into the pen without the backup; Karstark junior turning his back to Jaime; Jaime strangling Karstark junior so easily; Karstark junior not going for his weapon... And so on.

Â 
You would think. Â But, their pointless stupidity of Jon knowing Bran is alive puts a fairly big logical wrinkle in how that whole thing played out....of course the D&D MO is to introduce dumb plot twist, execute it, and then ignore it. Â So they could easily just have Jon know Bran/Rickon are alive and never tell Stannis and ignore he knows it going forward and do the Manderly thing same as in the books....even though of course Jon would know and Stannis would know that Stannis helping the Northern lords get their liege lord back would put them on his side in the blink of an eye. Â But, you know, logic isn't HBOs strong point in this show.

I had given up on FakeArya a loooooooooooooong time ago.Â  But, hear me out, I think I've found a way to do that, or for them to do it.Â  I highly suspect that we'll find out the guards laughed at Arya and Sandor (just like the KL guards didn't believe who she was) BUT perhaps, word will get to LF, and that'll give him the idea for a FakeArya from the brothel.Â  A young Ros, oh joy, LOLÂ  It would be right up their alley, the way they dumb down LF.Â

Â 
Even so, why was it necessary for Jaime to kill Alton? Two of them working together is much more logical and exciting. And if Alton has to be killed, then let him be killed by the search party (of-screen, if need be). All that would've been way better than what they actually did.

I'm not saying I agree, even the first time I watched that cousinslaying (it could use a word, LOL), I thought immediately of the 'whitewashing' Tyrion complaints.Â  In the books, Tyrion sent the men to break Jaime out, and I suspect, it was still all about not giving him a body count.Â

I agree, I am pissed what it did to Jaime's character.Â  Not only would he not kill a cousin like that, I find it hard to believe that he would kill a regular ordinary Lannister soldier in that situation, either, a brother in arms if you will.Â  Commadarie with men in the field seems to something he enjoys and takes seriously, too.Â

Â 
Again, I'm not on the jamie is redeemed bandwagon...but I can't see him killing a) his cousin, and  someone who was at the time hero worshipping him, who he had just bonded with over tourney stories and FOR NO REASON...because it didn't help his escape...and um, ya know, if he felt he needed to kill him...he could have enlisted his hero worshipping cousin who could have FAKED IT and then there would be two of them, better odds for him to get away, yes, of course.
Â 
I wish I hadn't been reminded of that stupidity.
Â 
Back to fake Arya, if there is no fake Arya and no wedding to Ramsay what are they going to do at Winterfell? Â I guess Roose could call them all together on some pretext, but it would be kind of weak. Â I will be seriously bummed out if there is no Lady Dustin and no trip to Chekov's Crypts of Winterfell.

Yeah, but, the perfect time to hint at fake Arya would have been when granpa whitebeard Bolton tells Ramsay eh, screw it, those Stark boys are probably dead...right? Â Then again, despite what people like to write on this forum, the show is not very big into foreshadowing, they SURPRISE.

I've believed they would do fake Arya all along because the Winterfell stuff is so intense..but they have really screwed with the plot in many ways. Â

Â 
Not only to the character, but to the show as well. I mean, everybody keeps repeating this is a show where stakes are high. But, if stakes are high, how come Jaime is able to escape prison so easily? How come Jon was freed the moment he killed Qhorin? How come a group of Ironborn can attack a castle in the middle of The North and then just run back without any trouble worth mentioning? How come certain Locke can enlist in the NW only to potentially find information about Stark boys: are NW vows so easy to break (not to mention that he had no reason whatsoever to think Jon or anyone in the NW has any info on Stark boys)? I'm honestly amazed every time someone tells GOT is a show were nobody's safe.
4147	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-03	Â 
Yeah, but, the perfect time to hint at fake Arya would have been when granpa whitebeard Bolton tells Ramsay eh, screw it, those Stark boys are probably dead...right? Â Then again, despite what people like to write on this forum, the show is not very big into foreshadowing, they SURPRISE.
Â 
I've believed they would do fake Arya all along because the Winterfell stuff is so intense..but they have really screwed with the plot in many ways. Â 


Â 
I agree, on the surprises and the screwing.Â  Keep in mind the LF transporter, LOLÂ  and of course, Tywin's fax service.Â  A SURPRISE, SURPRISE FakeArya could be in Winterfell in no time, hell....maybe she's there waiting?Â  I'm kind of kidding, but....kind of not.Â
4148	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-03	Â 
Not only to the character, but to the show as well. I mean, everybody keeps repeating this is a show where stakes are high. But, if stakes are high, how come Jaime is able to escape prison so easily? How come Jon was freed the moment he killed Qhorin? How come a group of Ironborn can attack a castle in the middle of The North and then just run back without any trouble worth mentioning? How come certain Locke can enlist in the NW only to potentially find information about Stark boys: are NW vows so easy to break (not to mention that he had no reason whatsoever to think Jon or anyone in the NW has any info on Stark boys)? I'm honestly amazed every time someone tells GOT is a show were nobody's safe.


Â 
Hell, I still want to know what the hell was Locke's plan if he should have gotten ahold of Bran?Â  By himself, beyond the wall in the middle of no where without Hodor to help him.Â It's obvious murder wasn't his plan, elsewise, he'd have slitÂ all their throats, not try to carry Bran off.Â Â Â What would have made sense in that mess of a story, I'm not sure, but.....seems to me that slicing all their throats, returning to the Wall with Jon to kill him on the way, or later, made the most sense.Â  Whatever.Â  Can't say it's easy to rewrite some of their mess or that I'm much interested in doing so.Â

Â 
Yeah, my fake Arya faith is wavering a little. Â Just as I first was convinced they were NOT going to have Stoneheart, and then decided they would, and now am not sure anymore if they're going to have her because it seems like they have so much to wrap up in 2 shows and goodness knows that Tyrian Dinklage will get huge screen time for his escape/patricide and however they dispatch Shae the hooker with the heart of gold, and since the shows are like 50 minutes now...
Â 
I hope to hell they don't have Sansa wearing that crazy costume going forward.

Â 
I do think we're getting Stoneheart still, I confess.....I was pretty certain she'd be treating Freys like tapestries, but they do seem, sometimes, to be in such a rush that I'm a little worried on the Brienne stuff coming now.
Â 
That dress, Lawwwwwwwwwwwd, some angles and shots it looked ok, but mostly it looked like someone stitched themselves a Halloween costume.Â 
Â 
On the whole, it's hard to tell for sure what they intend to slow down, storywise, and where they are engaging the warp drive.Â  I'm suspecting that with the apparent Sansa progression, Arya's FM training might be just a few episodes next season?Â  I'm really confused on the timing they will employ for a lot of different things.
Â 
I suspected the Tyrion stuff would take lots of time on Episode 10, but after the way The Red Viper stuff seemed condensed, I'm not so sure now.Â  I think it's gonna take a couple episodes next season to work all the timing differences out.Â

Couldn't say which is worse. If she keeps wearing it (and it's not impossible, considering how nobody changes the clothes in this show ever), then it'd probably become the most ridiculous costume on TV. If she never wears it again - then what the hell was she wearing it for this time?! Impressing Robin? Auditioning for the remake of Gone with the Wind (going down the stairs and everything - in which case Littlefinger is the new Rhett Butler)? MOURNING???!!!
4152	7th-key	2014-06-03	Â 
The reason Jaime brought it up to begin with was because he slew his cousin. I


Â 
I think they only brought it up to make Tyrion list all the -icides up to patricide, so it'd tied up with Littlefinger's speech about [paraphrasing] "anyone can die anywhere, even while on a chamber pot..."
*wink wink, bookreaders, now excuse us while we screw up organic plots to have as much 'BAM!' moments as we can.*
Like the poison on the Viper's spear, it need to be surprise.

Â 
Of course, the show doesn't have to respect the culture built in the books, just like it often doesn't. I find the show vastly weaker because of it, but OK, let's say stranger things happen. However, Jaime killing the only person that is both willing and capable of helping him in his escape (cousin or not), is just plain stupid. The whole scene was a festival of the worst cliches: million people walking around the pen at one moment, and then not a living soul there at the next; Karstark junior going into the pen without the backup; Karstark junior turning his back to Jaime; Jaime strangling Karstark junior so easily; Karstark junior not going for his weapon... And so on.
Â 


Â Totally- his cousin openly asked how he could help Jaime escape. Â Jaime could have easily said..."Ok, I am going to pretend to choke you, and you play dead, and then when the guard comes in to check on you...." Â It made no sense why Jaime had to actually kill him when the dude just offered to help him escape. Â The guy was more than willing to play along with whatever escape scheme that Jaime had. Â He probably even would have taken one for the team and let Jaime escape while he stayed captured. Â He obviously idolized Jaime. Â It was a really stupid scene in many ways. Â

LSH for sure, but I admit Fake Ayra might be something they forgo at this point. Either that or 410 is going to be TONS of stuff squeezed into 52 mins.

It is MUCH worse if she keeps wearing it. I never want to see her in that get up again. Â I will be expecting her to start flinging mardi gras beads around and demanding LF make her a specialty cocktail.

4158	Hath4	2014-06-03	If they cut the farya, there would be no reason for theon to break out of his reek presona and espape from Ramsay. It would destroy his excelent winterfell storyline. and his redeption. Him saving her from Ramsay is what redems him in many peoples eyes. He had know reason to save her yet risks more mutilation to do it. It is a call back to his orderd murder of the millers boys. The boys did not matter so in his mind they could die. Then after he sees that was wrong and saves an innocent girl because he relizes that humanity is specail. Only a person striped of their huanity and turned into something lower than a dog can can truley see that.
4159	Balerion06	2014-06-03	The whole Sansa plotline annoys me. Unless they completely diverge from the books after this season, then I'm dreading what they plan to do with her going forward.
D&D have already shown that 90% of the time they're incapable of writing anything original in a half-decent fashion, and I fear what was one of my favourite arcs from Feast is going to be adapted abominably.

That was so fucking dumb. I really just wanted to punch them at that point. The storyline was fucked anyway (yeah, Jon knows Bran's alive and of course sooner or later everyone goes to CK right? He's got to be there!), but they could have salvaged something from the wrecks. Like when Jojen saw the fire on his hand I thought "oh, cool they can work with this".
Â 
So, when Locke came in , discovered Bran and prepared to take him away, I thought "oh, right he wants to go to a secluded spot and torture the shit out of Bran to know where Rickon might be. Afterwards, he'll just slit his throat and join the NW-members on their way back to the wall and then later leave". But the idiot actually wanted to run away with him, instead of staying with the safe NW!
Â 
And even worse, D&D ruined perfectly good fire build up. Instead of leaving Hodor & co alone, which didn't make sense at all (been pointed out time and time again), they should have had Lock throw a lamp or torch into the straw near Jojen. That wouldn't have been difficult right? It would not even cost a minute extra and it would explain why he didn't slit their throats to silence them, cover his dumb lie about dangerous dogs in the cabin and offer some more suspense to the Unsullied, because they had just seen Jojen's vision burn.

You've put more effort into rewriting their mess than I have. Â Honestly, what was the point, after all Roose basically called the whole thing a Red Herring.

They are just hacks. And it's a real shame. In part I think the problem doesn't just lie with their lack of talent, it lies in the fact that they just do to much. I mean they wrote like eight out of ten episodes this year, directed an episode, did the general story outline and probably took care of a million other small things. I mean how is that even possible? When you look at Hannibal, a network show that has had only two seasons they have had like 14 writers!!!
Â 
They need to bring in more writers (especially a woman, because some of the things D&D write...) and burden themselves less. Let them run the show instead of getting their grubby hands on every piece of dialogue on this show. Next year, Cogman will write two episode, GRRM and their assistant one. Still, to much imo. Dumb&Dumber should limit themselves even further.

Â 
Well, the show doesn't elaborate on it, but the Bolton position is much stronger having taken Moat Caitlin.Â  They have just returned their army to the North, and it looks like they have gone ahead and occupied Winterfell.Â  Roose sent his best man after the boys, so there really isn't a plan B.Â  If he starts a big manhunt, then people know the Starks are still alive and Roose is actively trying to kill them, which is very bad for Roose.Â  So, he going forward he pretends like they are dead, and hopes their youthful, and in the case of Bran crippled, status makes them unlikely to generate an opposition movement.

Â 
I kinda agree with this. I think that the show has done a poor work about introducing the background of certain characters that are gone but are important nevertheless. I know in this case is hard to portray conversations and analysis about Rhaegar Targaryen on screen, but they didn't even show him during Dany's visions, nor showed Elia and his baby. Rhaegar is probably the most named dead character of the whole story, including his family.

I don't doubt it. Â I'm sure it takes lots of rewatches for Unsullied to even get all the details the show bothers to give. Â We cling to them like gems sometimes, but they don't always know which details are important in the long run. Â
4169	Bear Island	2014-06-03	Â 
If they eliminate Manderlay and "the North remembers" and everything about that chapter I will picket HBO myself.
Â 
So much depends on what hasn't been written yet, ya know? Â I tend to think that Bran isn't coming back from the far North and the Weirwood tree, which means it has to be Rickon on Skagos. Â But since we don't know what happens with Davos and Rickon...who knows.
I don't think there was a Wex, but they could make "Wex" any random IB or just have Davos go to White Harbor to get support from the Northern lords...where he will then learn that Bran and Rickon are alive.
Â 
Well, except that it won't be big news to anyone...since Jon will know it, so presumably Stannis will know it and around and around we go with the butterfly effect.


Â 
This, so much. 'The North remembers' is one of the best lines in the entire series, and that arc is really important. I can see them cutting Wex, but I think it's important for the show to show that there are Northerners still loyal to the Starks (apart from, you know, one small girl on Bear Island), and Manderlay and his revenge are a huge part of that. Their loyalty to the Starks is ancient. Plus, it's a good way to call back to the Red Wedding and it brings the Freys back into things.

Â 
Agreed. I can say for certain that if I was watching the show without reading the books first I could care less about Jon's real parents (or it's relevance), who is or isn't a Targ, what happened between the Mountain, Elia and her children and about a dozen other details that us readers obsess over and analyze/speculate to death.
4171	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-03	I guess, I probably mentioned that just because I still can't get over it =D
But it's weird that they would talk about such things, with Jaime mentioning killing cousins, and he has not the slightest emotion showing. What they could have done maybe was Tyrion would actually bring killing cousins up, and Jaime goes pale, Tyrion would follow up by saying "Come on, you didn't actually kill a cousin of ours ?". It would have built up on the anger that Tyrion might feel towards him when Jaime tells him about Tysha (If that scene ever happens).
At least it would have given some point to this whole scene.


I think we might get the Tysha talk in episode 10.Â 
Â 


Just rewatched the episode finally, and I think my main nitpicks are still.....entirely too much beetle time, entirely too little Viper time.Â  Why am I now hearing Hammer Time in my head?Â 


http://www.youtube.c...Z5N4&feature=kp
youre welcome.
Â 


Â 
Yeah, book! Jorah is very different in the scene than show! Jorah. But that's not really new with Jorah, I guess. However, I do wonder if the writers moved away from GRMM's version for a specific reason (outside of pretty actors having chemistry together so give them drama!)--like Jorah and Dany meeting again in WOW, ect.


Yeah Book!Jorah is different from Show!Jorah. Book!Jorah had a fucking fedora firmly planted on his dome. He was forcibly kissing Dany, demanding things of her, covered in back hair, and being an entitled shit head. I really dont blame them for changing him up to look more like an exiled knight who fell hopelessly in love with the woman he began serving, but him trying to keep quiet about it as long as she was happy. And spied on her in order to get home before he became utterly devoted to her. Show!Jorah > Book!Jorah in the eyes of the viewer and if he is to remain sympathetic, it was a necessary change.Â The fact that people were sympathetic to Book!Jorah gives me the fucking collywobbles. Ewww. The show wants us to root for DanyÂ and Jorah and root for him to do something hella cool.Â 
Â 


Â 
Good point. in fact, if you're a casual audience member who has not read the books, and all you've seen for the past few seasons now is Jorah doing his hardest to get Dany home and believes in her with his whole heart (his words!), would you even remember the deal he made with KL back in S1?


Nonsense. Most viewers remember it especially if reminded of it. There was a lot of "Ohhh Yeahh!! thats right!" going on.
Â 


Â 
They showed someone, his squire I assume, wiping the blade with a cloth which i took to be him putting poison on it. I doubt many unsullied viewers picked up on that and made the connection nor do I know if I would have had I not read the books.


The lack of credit people give show-only fans here really rustles my jimmies. My mum was all "that spear was poisoned..." because of how Oberyn was using it. Needed no help from me. Most of my unsullied friends actually assume the spear was poisoned. Hasnt Read The Books =/= Not Genre Savvy. 
Â 


Who am I kidding, I'm fairly certain the FakeArya ship has sailed.Â 


Hehaha no.Â 
In fact, im almost positive this is why Arya's identity is out in the open. The show didnt have a Jeyne Poole and everyone thought Arya was dead. But if there was an Arya Stark wandering around and people got wind of it, that would mean someone can just pull up an Arya Stark because "oh she was last seen near the Vale..." We all know Arya herself is going to wind up on a boat to Braavos, but in-universe, no one knows that. Littlefinger is like to get wind that an "Arya Stark" tried to knock on the door of the Vale. What will he do? Keep it from Sansa as much as he can, dig up some hapless poor girl to pose as Arya and give her to the Boltons. That way he can keep Sansa for himself and still profit from a new faction.Â 

The plot point can still work. Its just gonna do so very differently.

Yes, it was season 2, when Jaime was Robb's captive before Catelyn released him.   It does seem to be impossible for unsullied to follow.  I avoid talking with them about the show sometimes, because all they seem to get out of it is "boobs, swords, cooool". They don't know half the characters' names, let alone remember their backstories.  I overheard a conversation between some "diehard" fans of the show today at work...Bran was "the kid who got thrown from the tower because he saw those siblings having relations" and someone was like "did he die, I can't remember?".  I don't even bother trying to explain if that's all they grasped so far.

A lot of it has to do with the genre the show is in. Being genre savvy has a lot to do with people being able to put pieces together. I do agree that at times, the show feels fragmented. But if you know how most fantasy stories go and even political stories and stuff, you might be able to predict or at least get a good idea about how some stuff plays out. People have seen Fast Little Guy vs Big Immovable Fucker fights before and how the former often either tires out his opponent or just doesnt play fair and uses some other means. (what they didnt expect is for Oberyn to lose.) Thats why you have unsullied going "Well im sure the Mountain is toast anyway. Hes either gonna die from wounds or Oberyn poisoned the spear." Cuz lets face it, The Red Viper has "poison tactics" written all over him.Â 
Â 
One of my unsullied friends, who is by all means, not the most attentive bloke in the world, predicted that Oberyn might not make it through the fight. He gets people's names mixed up all the damn time, but he remembers key plot points. One of my unsullied friends figured out R+L=J, however, he is not exactly typical. Hes into rewatching and pouring through the details finely. My mum also figured out R+L=J. Some of them are just in it for the ride and arent analyzing the show that deeply, but since they are familiar with various stories, seen a lot of movies, etc, they can catch on to stuff. (every one of my unsullied friends thinks Sansa's gonna end LF somehow. Some even speculate this season.)Â 
Â 
Oh yeah, theres also that one unsullied question: "WHERE IS RICKON??" I think its interesting that they will remember Rickon.Â Even i forget about Rickon from time to time.
Â 
One of my favorite things about this show is that, now that Joff is toast, the unsullied fans i know will just be casually like "how about dat Ramsay, yo. Dat shit right dere.Â Maannn. There better be some fuckin' Jon Snow killin' his ass. I CANT GOOGLE BECAUSE SPOILERS AHHH!"Â 
Â 
Makes me giggle.

4175	Shpati	2014-06-03	I definitely agree about the
Â 
"-Beetles
-Missendei/Grey Worm"
Â 
Not very worthy imo. Those scenes could have been removed to make more room to build up the duel. I am disappointed to not see a scene where Tyrion names the Red Viper as his champion and the Viper stands up and says itÂ in frontÂ of a full court. I am also disappointed to not see the Red Viper and Tyrion moreÂ before the duel. The duel had that "alright, let's get this over with" feel to it. It needed a scene or 2 to build up.Â
4176	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-06-04	Maleficent appeared in the theaters friday and sunday Sansa gave homage. Wow the timing was superb. On thing I have been wondering about, it was'nt in this ep,, has'nt been anywhere, the death of Balon, or did I miss it. I remember where Mel drew the "Kings blood" for that one, perhaps it's performance anxiety, can't quite .........
4177	kkae	2014-06-04	I really have hard time enjoying the show because of the all changes and additions. Not that there is nothing inherently wrong with them but they often feel just bad and pointless.
I hope that at some point I stop caring about the differences and just roll with it but until then I have to grind my teeth like Stannis.
Â 
Back in season 2 when Jaime killed his cousin I think that the one of the producers said in the Behind the Episode video that people needed to be reminded what kind of monster Jaime is (or something like that).
I feel like many of their interpretations of the characters are based on their first impression they never bothered to change or they are deviating for some other reason.

Â 
Right.Â  I think the importance of this or that event, detail, or character is naturally going to be related to how much screen time they get.Â  So in a way, things that a general TV audience would be liable to forget maybe aren't that big a deal anyway in the context of the show.Â  I know only one other person who watches this, and probably the last thing he read in his life was Fox in Socks.Â  I'm going to ask him tomorrow, "What happened to Rickon?" to see if he even knows what I'm talking about.
Â 
I'm pretty surprised at the reasoning for the poison spear.Â  I would have figured most who consider Gregor to be finished would come to that conclusion from maybe the single eviscerating thrust Oberyn managed, which looked pretty close to what seppuku is supposed to be about, or maybe because of the overhead shot, where Gregor looks pretty clearly spent.Â  One of the fan reaction vids that I watched on this had one of the viewers saying "So it's a draw!" LOL.
Â 
Anyway, I was just trying to say that - at least in my case - declarations of what show-only viewers likely can or can't understand or piece together is as much an indictment of what would be my own hypothetical savvy in putting all this stuff together as anyone else's, to allay the rustling of your jimmies a bit.Â  It's not always a very judgmental or imperious thing from we all-knowing book people, I don't think.
4179	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-04	Jimmies firmly unruslted, mate. Some of the finer plot points would be tricky for me if i didnt read the books. But man i see some gnarly posts about how everyone who hasnt read the books is pretty damn dumb and dont really think about what they see. And the almighty book reader knows how to properly enjoy the series and everyone else is doing it wrong.
Â 
One thing is almost certain: unsullied fans who really get into this show always wind up getting the books and reading them anyway.
4180	Annara Snow	2014-06-01	Welcome to the 11th Discussing Sansa thread. I've been asked by Mladen to start this one on his behalf, and I'm starting it early to avoid the expected overload after the episode airs.
Â 
This is a thread for a discussion of Sansa's role in the episode 4.08 "The Mountain an the Viper". Please try to limit the conversation - whether it's speculation before the episode, or discussion of the episode after it has aired - to Sansa's appearance in this episode and anything that is relevant to it, instead of making general comments about Sansa. However, the discussion may contain book spoilers for Sansa's entire arc in the books, so don't read it if you have, for instance, read only up to A Storm of Swords.
4181	TheLadyNym	2014-06-01	I think and hope that they're going to emphasize on Sansa being in control of the situation e.g. deciding Petyr's faith, by choosing to tell the truth or lie. Those few moments where you get to see Sansa play the game of thrones herself, or discussing strategy with LF are so important to me! Â
4182	Natalie Underfoot	2014-06-01	I think and hope that they're going to emphasize on Sansa being in control of the situation e.g. deciding Petyr's faith, by choosing to tell the truth or lie. Those few moments where you get to see Sansa play the game of thrones herself, or discussing strategy with LF are so important to me! Â 

I agree. I have a friend who doesn't believe me that Sansa can play the game and I'm tired of hearing about how much she sucks compared to the other Starks.
4183	Jslay427	2014-06-01	Sansa is going to show tonight that she is starting to change from the sheltered little maiden into a legitimate budding player. And Sansa is not even close to being a favorite character of mine. At this point in the books she Atleast becomes interesting IMO.
4184	Newstar	2014-06-01	Alex Graves sounded pretty pumped about Sansa's bit in this episode and Sophie Turner's performance in particular. Should be good! (Get hype.)
4185	ohpooratlas	2014-06-01	I read the Alex Greave's quote about "the trial of Littlefinger" and how Sophie supposedly really comes into her own for the scene.
Â 
I'm very much looking forward to it.
4186	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-01	i think many people are going to be surprised at how much Sansa has grown since leaving Winterfell. I feel she's going to really shine tonight. Other than the fight, this is what I'm looking forward to the most.
4187	Chebyshov	2014-06-01	So confirmed, the Vale Lords know her identity. Wondering if Sansa believes LF is truly her only friend.
Also loving how good of a liar she is.

Â 
yes, it looks like twow stuff. and yes, she's definitely come a long way in the art of lying.
4189	Raksha 2014	2014-06-01	TV-Sansa looks like she is subtly encouraging Littlefinger's lust for her; which I don't like.

Â 
in all honesty she doesn't look like she is subtly doing anything. very interesting but as i said in the discussion thread, it feels too quick. this should have happened a little later.
4191	ohpooratlas	2014-06-01	No, I'm fine with this progression. And I'm glad she lied without him telling her to do so.
Â 
And was I mistaken, or was her hairÂ blackÂ in that final scene? Or was it just the lighting?

4193	Zman1863	2014-06-01	It sort of changes the dynamic of what the role of Alayne means for Sansa. This portrays it as just her playing a part and everyone who matters already knows who she really is. It seems she cannot ever assume the persona as deeply as she did in the books. Perhaps the ability to assume the role of Alayne with great depth is irrelevant to her progression in the book.Â
4194	Colonel Green	2014-06-01	And was I mistaken, or was her hairÂ blackÂ in that final scene? Or was it just the lighting?


Just the lighting.
Â 
The writers of the show are really fond of zero-to-sixty character shifts.Â  This is one of the more dramatic ones even by their standards (complete with vampy wardrobe change).Â  I like seeing the character portrayed as competent, but they really could have stood to ease into this.
Â 
One thing I will say (I noted this before somewhere else), but Sophie Turner is one of the only actors on this show (Conleth Hill, perhaps, being the other, though with Varys' murky motivations it's hard to tell) who plays her character acting as if she possesses all of the acting skills of Sophie Turner, without any actorly cues to convey that she's being dishonest (Natalie Dormer's Margaery, for instance, is so obviously dissembling whenever she's "playing the game" that it's a wonder anyone believes her; and I love Dormer, don't get me wrong; Aiden Gillen is another obvious example).
Â 
I'm kind of unclear why they cast somebody to play Corbray on the show; his part in the story would seem totally unnecessary.Â  I was uncertain about the guy they cast to play Bronze Yohn, but even though he doesn't really fit the novel's physical description, I liked his portrayal.Â  Very dry.
4195	GinesthoiOfIce	2014-06-01	Speechless. Sansa reveals herself to the Lord Declarants. Uncharted territory entered now. Seven hells I don't know how to react. And now she's Brown/Black haired with a Dark Phoenix/ Katniss/ Gothic Vixen look ? This is just too much to deal with. I'm quite concerned about the many possible implications of what we've seen.
4196	jons nissa	2014-06-01	And was I mistaken, or was her hairÂ blackÂ in that final scene? Or was it just the lighting?


Â 
her hair does look black. in fact, her entire look was black - her jewelry was large and black, her dress was black and seemed to have feathers on it, and her expression looked black. it would seem that sansa has gone over to the dark side.
4197	Alia Atreides	2014-06-01	I was .amazed at Sansa's performance; she has become quite the actress strictly speaking I must say I did enjoy this switch up more than her still hiding in the shadows within the books. It also makes me love her even more than before; I can't wait until next week to see what is to come next.Â
4198	Newstar	2014-06-01	Was it just me or did Sansa look like Maleficent?


Â 
I was thinking more that Sansa went full Black Swan...although considering that some have said that the idea of Sansa is essentially that of a Disney princess parachuted into a Crapsack World, that she dresses up like a Disney villain to mark her transformation would be fitting.
4199	Juan_Snow	2014-06-01	Speechless. Sansa reveals herself to the Lord Declarants. Uncharted territory entered now. Seven hells I don't know how to react.

I don't think it's anything to flip out over but I definitely consider that WoW spoiler material.  Lord Royce knows who she is. That's huge.

Don't really mind the changes that much compared to other ones this episode, Wanna see how it plays out but also wonder how soon we will get to twow material. Sophie Turner was awesome as always

4201	ViennaGirl	2014-06-01	I kind of loved Maleficent Sansa, but I'm also totally speechless. Yes, I loved her. Maybe this means she'll be the one to rally the north... Huge spoilers that the Vale lords know her.

4203	FNF	2014-06-01	Hate to be that guy, but I pretty much called Sansa confessing who she was. I like the change personally. She's an active game player now...
4204	Faint	2014-06-01	This is what happens when you publish only three Sansa chapters in fourteen years.
4205	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-06-01	IMO, I loved the black tones of the last Sansa scene. Sansa usually wears brighter colors, especially blues... this scene had a "stark"ness to it (pun intended!). Or perhaps it's just the shadow of Alayne hanging over her.
Â 
I am another person wondering about TWOW spoilers. I'm not concerned, I want to be spoiled!  I wonder if this episode can imply or confirm that the Lords Declarant know who Sansa is in AFFC.

Only because she flat out told him who she was though.Â

4208	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-06-01	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Â 
*Gloats like MoFo!*
Â 
Ohhhhh, I was CRAZY thinking she'd reveal her identity. LMAO. I've been on POINT this season! Phew!
Â 
...But onto more substantial talk...
Â 
Her hair was wet, that's why it looked dark. And now we know that 'Angry' Sansa walking through the corridor is in episode 10.
4209	nothatso	2014-06-01	I'm more concerned with the ripples this might cause.
Â 
If the lords of the Vale know she's with Littlefinger, then how long before everybody else knows? What effect does this have on Littlefinger's relationship with the Lannisters? Wouldn't they demand she be returned or otherwise know he's plotting against them?
4210	FNF	2014-06-01	https://www.youtube....h?v=j0iNPkx8vnE
Â 
Pretty much confirms GRRM played a part in bringing Sansa's arc forward imo.
4211	LordStoneheart	2014-06-01	I was rather pleased with it... It kept me on edge even though if done "right" it shouldn't have. I like that we're getting a spoiler, but is it though really? At least to us boarders who speculate a lot, it comes as no real surprise that the Vale lords know her identity. They were bound to find out sometime.Â
4212	Colonel Green	2014-06-01	If the lords of the Vale know she's with Littlefinger, then how long before everybody else knows?


Royce, Waynwood and Corbray were in the room, plus like one random guard, I think.Â  The way they left things here, I think the implication is that they'll all keep their mouths shut.
Â 
To nitpick the logic here, Sansa sticks with Littlefinger because he's the devil she knows; okay, that's the same as the book.Â  But the revised version of the plan hinges completely on Royce and co. being all "woo, Team Stark!", so how is that any less reliant on others?
4213	Newstar	2014-06-01	Her hair was wet, that's why it looked dark. And now we know that 'Angry' Sansa walking through the corridor is in episode 10.
Â 
Maybe that bit with Sansa stalking angrily through a corridor was cut from Season 4? Her hair looked dyed in that shot, not wet. It would be weird for her to go back to her Sansa dress after so much was made of her transformation.
Â 
It does change the flavour of the Vale storyline if the Lords Declarant are readily working with Littlefinger instead of actively trying to undermine him...although I suppose Littlefinger has brought so many of them on board by the end of AFFC that that might have been the way the books were going in any event.

Â 
Perhaps you're right. Maybe they cut that scene. Seem to me it would have looked perfect/been perfectly placed after the testimony scene. Although, I don't see the point of dying her hair now. She's not taking on the "Alayne Stone" personality and the Lords of the Vale already know who she is.

4219	Grizzly Mormont	2014-06-01	TV-Sansa looks like she is subtly encouraging Littlefinger's lust for her; which I don't like.

She said "I know what you want...." and he said "when you know what someone wants, you can control them." Â Take it from there.

Â 
This.Â  Nicely done.
Â 
Things I noted:
Â 
1. Women's weapons.Â  The hound repeated the line 'poison is a woman's weapon' -- Martin emphasizes that Sansa does not have access to any other type of weapon:
Â 
http://www.youtube.c...h?v=j0iNPkx8vnE
Â 
Â 
Sansa used tears to save LF and herself -- Lysa used the Tears of Lys to kill her husband.
Â 
Possible foreshadowing of Sansa, the black falcon, using poison.Â  The journey from pawn to Lucrezia Borgia continues.
Â 
2.Â  The show is now ahead of the book.Â  I think we will see the controversial chapter by next season.
Â 
And a question
Â 
No HTH thus far -- does that mean that LF really wants SR to recover?
Â 
edit: the board ate half my post

4221	Darth Pipes	2014-06-01	I liked the Sansa stuff a lot.Â  Her revealing herself to be Sansa Stark was a legitimate surprise.

I wonder if LF is trying to set up Robin in the Harry the Heir role.Â  Or, barring that, Harry is his back-up plan when he realizes Robin is a lost cause.
4222	Raksha 2014	2014-06-01	But if they're letting Robin go running around the Vale, possibly in the fosterage of others, how will LF get control of the Eyrie/Vale? Â I haven't seen LF being named Lord Protector yet; and he wants that almost as much as (possibly more than) he wants ultimate possession of Sansa.
4223	Lady Arwen	2014-06-01	I...what...what the...
Â 
I don't know what to make of any of this. I'm still trying to wrap my head around Sansa revealing her identity to the Vale Lords. And Sansa acknowledging LF's lust. And Sansa apparently dyeing her hair...?Â 
Â 
TWOW spoilers? I have no clue. I'm confused.Â
4224	JonDunn	2014-06-01	Sansa was the star of the episode
4225	Colonel Green	2014-06-01	But if they're letting Robin go running around the Vale, possibly in the fosterage of others, how will LF get control of the Eyrie/Vale? Â I haven't seen LF being named Lord Protector yet


Royce and Waynwood were the only people in the books challenging him for the protector status, and they're on his side now, from what we saw here.
4226	Newstar	2014-06-01	I guess the idea is that she will continue to be "Alayne Stone" to everyone else--soldiers, servants, etc.--but that Royce and Waynwood, in addition to Sweetrobin (well, Robin in the show), will be in on the secret.
Â 
And Sansa acknowledging LF's lust.
Â 
Yup.
4227	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-01	*pitches camp in the thread*
I drink your tears, fandom. I guzzle them!
Â 
Im so smug right now,Â I can barely stand me. Wowowowowwowow.Â 
So...Sansa totally plays LF like a fucking fiddle and its awesome. His visible shock was fantastic. While hes still convinced shes on his side and for now, i think she is. Because she doesnt knowÂ things yet. (she dont know about Ned yet. Thats when i think that shoe will drop.) She goes for a Villainous Costume Change. Or at least thats what it looks like. That dress is kinda vampy and im not convinced that Lysa actually had that in her closets. Hoo well, at least her hair is not red and shes gone full Alayne.Â 


Royce and Waynwood were the only people in the books challenging him for the protector status, and they're on his side now, from what we saw here.


Yeah see umm..i think these guys are going to actually not be super behind LF in the show either. They are gonna back Sansa and the idea of her union with Sweetrobin. I actually think this is whats up there.
4228	Another Locust	2014-06-01	Interesting situation... I do hope that Sansa's subtle affection for Petyr is just "lies and Arbor Gold." I am also 95% sure that this was TWoW material (partially, at least.) I'm a little bit frightened as well... Sansa did seem devious in black. The terror and possibilities and spoilers, scary indeed.
4229	ohpooratlas	2014-06-01	I really don't see how the Lords Declarent knowing who she is is a spoiler. We all pretty much assumed this is going to happen anyway, right? Littlefinger told her this was his plan. They're just moving things forward at a quicker pace in the show.
Â 
What I took from all the scenes is that: Sansa is in command of her agency now (revealing her identity to the Vale Lords without consulting Littlefinger). The Vale Lords know her identity, but they promised to keep it secret. It benefits no one to reveal her, and there is the fondness they have for her father as well. That was made clear when they mentioned Eddard running up and down the halls of the Eyrie. The final scene was the official arrival of Alayne Stone/Baelish with her black hair. Going forward she will pretend to be Baelish's niece.Â 
Â 
I'm very interested in how this storyline progresses forward. There's a different psychological component at work here now.

I like how that scene with Littlefinger and Sansa was cryptic. She says she knows what he wants. Does she really? I think she has an idea, and I think she thinks she factors into what he "wants." And yes ... using that might be a little disturbing, but LittlefingerÂ didÂ tell her that he loved her mother. Littlefinger told Lysa he loved her mother before pushing her out the moondoor. And Littlefinger said "You're more beautiful than she ever was." She knows Catelyn was a huge motivational force for him. Now she seems to be intentionally assuming that role.
Â 
Like I said ... should be interesting. I'm okay with the changes.
Â 
Mostly though? She has her black hair. That excites me more than anything, really.Â

4236	jarl the climber	2014-06-01	Was Sansa being in black, was that about her being in mourning for Lady Lysa? Even with her being Petyrs neice Alayne, she is his ward, so it would probably be appropiate for her to be wearing black as Lysa was Petyrs wife. I like the whole Dark Queen thing but maybe people are reading a little to much into this

In inside episode 8, D&D confirm that Sansa knows how to manipulate LF and she knows that she is his weakness and plans on using that to her advantage.
4239	ohpooratlas	2014-06-01	Also, I have to mention: almost every reaction to Sansa I've seen for this episode (with the exception of my boyfriend le sigh) has been overwhelmingly positive. Lots of people getting behind "goth Sansa" lmao.Â 
Â 
The feathers are what really put the look over the top I think lolz.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â I saw George's comments. 
Â 
I was only suggesting that Sansa does not, in fact, knowÂ everythingÂ Littlefinger wants. But she has an idea. And that's a start for her.
Â 
I don't think anyone knows what Littlefinger's actual end game is. That's almost as big a mystery in the series as who Jon Snow's mother is.

Â 
Heh, as it was a bisected circle, it looked like a "No" sign (like the "No" part of a "No smoking" sign). That would be an apt choice for a pendant to show to Littlefinger, sort of like the jewelry equivalent of a chastity belt: "NO ENTRY PERMITTED."
Â 
There was a thin, long metal thing dangling at the end of the pendant chain. It looked almost like a fancy silver pen (like Joan from Mad Men's pen necklace), but it couldn't be a pen, obviously. It was awfully modern-looking as a piece of jewelry.

Absolutely love the Dark Willow comparison! I just finished watching Buffy, and Willow was hands down my favorite character. In a lot of ways she could be paralleled to Sansa... not just the hair!
Â 
I definitely did not mind the changes in tonight's episode. Definitely think that Sansa only revealed herself to those she needed to be... revealed to. I think she will continue under cover outwardly for now.Â

Nah i saw it as a dove who sits in a cage and doesnt watch whats happening. To the transition of a raven.Â Always watching. Ravens in this universe are messengers and agents.Â You know, like before they were demonized as nothing more than carrion birds and creatures of ill tidings. They also have minds of their own or are a part of a greater purpose. While i think Book!Sansa will be more like the falcon of Arryn,Â the show is using raven imagery. Its still bird imagery however, Â so that link is still there. (and its neato)

It's not ambiguous at all. People are just baselessly speculating on absolutely nothing.Â
4262	juanml82	2014-06-01	TV-Sansa looks like she is subtly encouraging Littlefinger's lust for her; which I like.


Fixed 
Â 


Â 
I was thinking more that Sansa went full Black Swan...although considering that some have said that the idea of Sansa is essentially that of a Disney princess parachuted into a Crapsack World, that she dresses up like a Disney villain to mark her transformation would be fitting.


I think the costume designers truly thought that when making that outfit.
Â 

And a question
Â 
No HTH thus far -- does that mean that LF really wants SR to recover?
Â 
edit: the board ate half my post


Well, the books are not the show and it does look like the show is setting things up to omit HtH. We should remember that book!LF doesn't benefit from SR's quick demise - quite the contrary.
Â 


But if they're letting Robin go running around the Vale, possibly in the fosterage of others, how will LF get control of the Eyrie/Vale? Â I haven't seen LF being named Lord Protector yet; and he wants that almost as much as (possibly more than) he wants ultimate possession of Sansa.


Well, since he's the one deciding that Robin will go on a tour of the Vale, deciding on his future and even asking his evidently not-fellow Lords what side they are, I think he had pretty much turned into Lord Protector without even asking.
Â 


I don't think show Sansa is a maiden anymore.


Interesting issue. I'd think Sansa is better off by keeping him desiring for the time being. But the scene is ambiguous and Show!Sansa clearly took Cersei's advice.
Â 
Â 
Anyways, gotta love dark, cold bitch Sansa Stark. Maybe she will indeed sacrifice Walder Frey to the Old Gods after all!

If this were the case it would have been made more obvious. They aren't going to not make such a huge moment unclear or that ambiguous; they may not show them doing the deed but I imagine it would be similar to Daario-Dany in episode 7. It would be so dumb for Littlefinger to say "Oh hey Sansa remember when I banged you that one time" in season 5. If anything the scene was playing up the sexual tension and maybe foreshadowing it in the future.Â
4273	Newstar	2014-06-01	The dark feather collar on Sansa's dress is driving me crazy. I know there's a specific visual reference point for that and I know I've seen it somewhere before, and I can't quite place it. I want to say McQueen, but I don't think that's it, although McQueen has used feathers for dresses before in a big way.

It depends on how the want to play the relationship between them, and whether they want to focus in Sansa's first fuck or not. As it stands, I think it was made to look ambiguous. And if we disagree on this, well, we're just two strangers disagreeing on the Internet.

Perhaps you're right. Maybe they cut that scene. Seem to me it would have looked perfect/been perfectly placed after the testimony scene. Although, I don't see the point of dying her hair now. She's not taking on the "Alayne Stone" personality and the Lords of the Vale already know who she is.

GRRM did say words to the effect that the bumped Sansa TWOW chapter would kick off a new storyline for Sansa, although I don't think "Vale tour for Sweetrobin with the Vale lords behind Littlefinger" was the new storyline fans had in mind.
Â 
Even though we seem to be vaulting past the books, I think Season 5 might "double back" and seemingly "leftover" AFFC material might find its way piecemeal into Season 5: Sansa could still meet and have a similar conversation with Myranda (...although Bronze Yohn might entrust her with the secret, I guess), Sansa could still wind up playing mother to Sweetrobin, Littlefinger could still start poisoning Sweetrobin slowly, etc.

Sad thing is that George has no one to blame but himself for this. He's had plenty of time to finish this series but he is milking this cash cow for all that is worth at the expense of his series, potential, legacy. If the show finishes before the books it just will not be the same as it could have been. George has said in many of interviews he enjoys his dump trucks full of money. The world traveling, the writing an episode a season, the side projects, the tv spots, etc are all things that take GRRM out of the one room he will write in and further delay the release of this damn book, let alone another after it. And it's looking more and more like the show is going to pass the books before it's all said and done, especially knowing that TWOW is not coming out this year. It will be a real slap in the face to his avid readers for them to have to avoid the internet for 5 years while he finishes ADOS because he wanted to cash in.

4290	Newstar	2014-06-01	Was I the only one reminded of this when Sansa appeared at the top of the staircase?  ("Laney" sounding like "Alayne" is probably a coincidence...OR IS IT????? )
Â 
Even though it looks like Season 5 will leave the Eyrie and therefore the need for climbing mules in the dust, there could still be a Mya Stone character who was pretty much exactly like Mya except for the mule part. Maybe TV Mya could handle the horses, or something.

TV-LF deserves to get played like a chump; he's less than half as smart as his book counterpart.

I assumed at first that was all part of the act, but the scene afterward with the two of them made it seem like it wasn't, which makes him look like a dumbass.

Â 
Agreed. What made Book LF so clever is that he was much better at controlling all potential outcomes so that he would always come out on top no matter how things shook out. However, TV LF was screwed in that moment and knew it, as D&D say on "Inside the Episode."
Â 
It does tend to diminish Sansa as a budding player if the only way to level the playing field is to dumb down Littlefinger significantly. Outfoxing TV Littlefinger is not nearly as impressive as outfoxing Book Littlefinger would be.

4298	sastelise	2014-06-01	I'm just so glad to see Sansa isÂ finally playing the game, more overtly at this point than in the books; actually I'm quite surprised. The fact that they rushed into this new material, Sansa revealing who she is, seems like there are good things in store for her character next season. And I think the unsullied who can't stand Sansa may have a new appreciation for her after this episode. I can't wait to see how this develops.
Â 
Oh, and the hound showing up with Arya at the blood gate? Obviously Arya has to get to Bravos, but could there potentially be a new storyline for the hound at the Vale? It would seem silly for them to turn back now.
It wasn't clear whether Sansa revealing her identity is going to be kept a secret, so if the hound knew that Sansa is at the Eyrie...

Â 
The Vale storyline is not turning out great for voices. Someone on the recap thread stated that Sophie Turner has one of the worst actress voices they've ever heard, and although I think that's overstating it, she does have an irritating voice. Put her voice and Littlefinger's garbled-Irish-by-way-of-a-Batman-voice-imitation in a scene together, and it's like nails on a chalkboard.

He's had plenty of time to finish this series but he is milking this cash cow for all that is worth at the expense of his series, potential, legacy. If the show finishes before the books it just will not be the same as it could have been. George has said in many of interviews he enjoys his dump trucks full of money. The world traveling, the writing an episode a season, the side projects, the tv spots, etc are all things that take GRRM out of the one room he will write in and further delay the release of this damn book, let alone another after it. And it's looking more and more like the show is going to pass the books before it's all said and done, especially knowing that TWOW is not coming out this year. It will be a real slap in the face to his avid readers for them to have to avoid the internet for 5 years while he finishes ADOS because he wanted to cash in.

The kid who plays SR is in his teens, so it would be weird to portray him as a sickly little boy, and the show has always been conscious about the economy of characters, so the tv show may go on a different arch where LF grooms Robin to be a good figurehead for the Vale. LF's main motivation for making Harrold the heir of the Vale(or at least he claims) is because they need a strong adult leader rather than a sickly boy.

I believe in the end that Sansa will be directly responsible for the end of Cersei, and once she knows LF's part in her father's death, LF himself. Maybe even Meryn "f-ing" Trant.  "What do we do to those who hurt the ones we love?"

And nobody outside of that meeting room knows Sansa is in the Vale, so no wonder her sister was turned away at the gate.

Good point! At first I was like, "why is he letting him go away with Royce and the rest when in the books he wanted the exact opposite?", but that's because LF wants Robin to stay in the Eyrie so he can poison him.
Â 
However, if he means to use it as a replacement of Harry then it makes perfect sense to send him to the other lords, get them to know each other, to teach him how to fight, and in general, to be the figurehead LF needs to unite the Vale

I thought he sent Robin off so he's blameless if anything happens to him, clean hands and everything. And now LF is convincing the Vale Lords to open rebellion, well it wouldn't be hard to label an assassin as the Hands catspaw. Its actually more clever than in the books if they go that route.
4315	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-06-02	I don't have a problem with Sansa's feathery dress. The Arryn sigil is the falcon, so I'd assume the lady of the Vale whose clothes Sansa is borrowing would have bird like features. The same way the Tully armor looked like fish scales last year. It's not a "feather, omg evil" thing at all.

We have no real idea of what their story next season will be like, but it's possible that they're going to play this as Littlefinger realizing that Robin is just not king material (even puppet king) in the course of their tour, and begins looking for a replacement.Â  Robin's fate seems like it's meant to be a big deal in TWOW's Sansa story, and under the current plan there's no reason he would ever be in danger.
4318	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-02	Well, the books describe LF's trips through the Vale, but Sansa only hears about them secondhand. I think they're just going to expand on that, like they expanded on Reek's recounting of his torture, even though we never actually saw it happen
4319	Rapsie	2014-06-02	Ah bugger, I kinda hoped she'd stay Alyane. Ah well, C'est la vie.
Anyway, haven't seen the episode, but I do wonder if her reveal is the controversial chapter? Also I am wondering if there is a lot to her storyline in TWOW as they have skipped Feast. Bodes well for lots of Sansa chapters in the next book hopefully.

Â 
She is not. She's wearing a fancy new ring on the index finger of her right hand, but it's a different ring.
Â 
It seems odd that Sansa's ring--which was never actually identified as a wedding ring--was used to mark the delineation between "Sansa Stark" and "Alayne" in this episode, much like her dress. A better choice would have been that dragonfly necklace, since Sansa was wearing it way back in Season 1 and she's worn it at various points since, (as well as dragonflies being a recurring motif in Sansa's outfits), but of course once they swapped out the PW hairnet for a necklace, TV Sansa couldn't exactly take the dragonfly necklace with her.
Â 
That last scene almost seemed like a finale-type scene to tie off Sansa's arc for this season and set up the next, with Littlefinger talking about leaving the Vale and Sansa unveiling herself in full Dark Alayne drag. I'd been assuming we'd get a 4x10 scene for Sansa's arc along with all the other major characters, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe just a quick scene with LF, Sansa and Sweetrobin setting off for the Vale tour?

Or with the idea that Valyrian was a gender neutral language, so that valonqar could refer to a younger sibling of either sex. Sansa is after all, Robb's younger sibling
Although I am of the opinion that Sansa does end up with Tyrion. Which will be tragic for her.

We can always hope he dies young or gets Greyscale so can't touch her. 
Another thought, I wonder if the controversial chapter is her taking credit for poisoning Joff? A sort of Lucrezia Borgia comparison would be interesting especially as she got out of her marriage due to non-consummation and despite her reputation probably never poisoned anyone (still hoping she is not stuck being a Lannister).
4329	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-02	Speechless. Sansa reveals herself to the Lord Declarants. Uncharted territory entered now. Seven hells I don't know how to react. And now she's Brown/Black haired with a Dark Phoenix/ Katniss/ Gothic Vixen look ? This is just too much to deal with. I'm quite concerned about the many possible implications of what we've seen.


Â 
Yeah, I am stunned.
Â 
This changes ... well, everything. The Alayne "persona" is basically vaporized. The Lords Declarant / Baelish tension is annihilated.
Â 
I mean, basically that's the whole of her AFFC storyline and it now is one big moot point.
Â 
(And that stings, because I've liked her acting this season.)

Â 
I think this was the controversial chapter. It's in this episode... It's hinted at, that's how I saw it but my friend disagrees.
Â 
Basically the scene when Sansa tells Petyr, "I know what you want" and then the scene skips, I believe she gave him what he wants... Which is "HER". She gave herself to him, you can see it from the way she's looking at him in the next scene and the way he's looking at her too... My friend says I'm just a sick horny **** but yeah that's the shocking 'chapter' I believe.
4331	Rapsie	2014-06-02	Had the five year gap been in place the tension with the Vale Lords would have been mainly resolved anyway. Building up consistent characterization is not a strong point if the show so the turn around of Sansa's character is done in one scene. It also depends how much filler D&D decide to add next year. Although a Vale tour does suggest she could bump into Sandor if he remains alive.
4332	Emperoreddy	2014-06-02	Oh I am an idiot. The black dress, the feathers, the dark hair. It is Sansa fully adopting the persona of LF's niece. Feathers for the Mockingbird cigil, the darker color to match his darker clothes completely separate from the innocent Sansa. It also shows her fully becoming the "student" of LF.
4333	Envie	2014-06-02	I just want to interject (I bowed out of the Sansa debates a couple of episodes back) ... for a moment:
Â 
Did anyone else get the weird impression for just one brief moment, that this feathered outfit she saunters down the stairs in, the deceptive play of color change and attitude change - it was JUST like The Hunger Games, hahaha... Sansa is Katniss in her "Mockingjay" dress!Â

Â 
Well, not "vaporized": Alayne will still exist for those not in the know (those three lords/ladies of the Vale have promised to keep her secret), thus the dyed hair. However, the dramatic tension of "Alayne" with reference to the Lords Declarant--will they find out her identity?--has indeed been wiped out, as has any tension between the Lords Declarant and Petyr Baelish, at least for the moment.
Â 
I agree that D&D have essentially wiped out Sansa's AFFC storyline, although I guess they could incorporate bits and pieces later on (Sansa mothering Sweetrobin, Littlefinger starting to poison Sweetrobin, etc.), not to mention changed the power dynamic between Sansa and LF completely, but I'm not really bothered by this. I think it's kind of hilarious that D&D decided to throw out Sansa's entire AFFC arc, like "Yeah, that's not happening, can't be bothered with that shit." Also, the fact that they're choosing to gloss over it could mean that there's lots of juicy material down the line for Sansa and they're trying to get to it as quickly as possible, and I am 100% in favour of that. If they are sticking to this seven-season plan, then they are probably going to try and frontload as much story as possible, and my hope is that if D&D are speeding through Sansa's AFFC arc, that means there must be a lot going on in Sansa's chapters post-ADWD.

					
					
							Edited by Newstar, 02 June 2014 - 02:29 AM.
4335	Hippocras	2014-06-02	My thoughts:
Â 
1. Yes, Sansa knows LF wants her and is playing it. LF implies she doesn't know what he wants, but clearly he does want Sansa, so he is vulnerable there even if Sansa doesn't know what he wants, otherwise, in the game - ie his intended power goals.
Â 
2. Sansa was modifying Lysa's dress when LF walked in to talk with her. She was adding "wings" to it. The Eagle is the sigil of House Arryn, and I am suspecting the goal is to make people mentally associate her with authority in the Vale and the Arryns.
Â 
3. She mentioned while revealing her identity to the Lords Declarant that the Lannisters have spies everywhere. I think everyone involved knows she needs to still play the part of Alayne. Her hair and new, regal, Arrynesque costume is for the part of Alayne - which is different than in the books. In the show Alayne is LF's niece, not a bastard, and LF is in charge in the Vale as Robert's guardian. Alayne will be betrothed to Robert Arryn, so her dress was modified to invoke House Arryn.
Â 
4. The Vale is officially in mourning for Lysa. That is why she was wearing black. So was LF you might have noticed. It is not about looking evil, but looking like she was in mourning. A mourning dress with Eagle wings. Brilliant.

Â 
Â 
Well, I can't see any particular rational reason why the Lords Declarant needed to know that Sansa was Sansa. The most wanted criminal in Westeros is staying at the Eyrie, and they just assume that loose lips won;t sink ships? That is not LF's style, nor should Sansa be that cavalier about her own safety.
Â 
I understand that the show has nipped a bit into Sansa's AFFC story with having the Vale lords there at all, but remember that Sansa has zero time in ADWD, so if they burn through her AFFC stuff too fast, or negate it, what have they got left? (One episode of her coming down the mountain with Robin, at most?)
4337	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-02	I just want to interject (I bowed out of the Sansa debates a couple of episodes back) ... for a moment:
Â 
Did anyone else get the weird impression for just one brief moment, that this feathered outfit she saunters down the stairs in, the deceptive play of color change and attitude change - it was JUST like The Hunger Games, hahaha... Sansa is Katniss in her "Mockingjay" dress!Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
Perhaps this was the show doing a friendly shout-out to the HG gang.

4338	Hippocras	2014-06-02	my post is already buried so I will repeat - the wings were to evoke House Arryn, added to a black mourning dress. It was a clever move to have everyone who sees "Alayne" associate her with authority in the Vale.
4339	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	Sansa is playing LF and they are making it seem that LF is falling for it...I don't know what i feel about it. Book LF would not fall for that or be reliant on Sansa but tv!LF i guess would.Â 
I don't believe Sansa 'gave herself' to LF. She is making it seem like she wants him

4340	ahighbornlady	2014-06-02	Interesting situation... I do hope that Sansa's subtle affection for Petyr is just "lies and Arbor Gold." I am also 95% sure that this was TWoW material (partially, at least.) I'm a little bit frightened as well... Sansa did seem devious in black. The terror and possibilities and spoilers, scary indeed.


Â 
I felt like she was being genuine when she said he was her only friend, sadly. I don't doubt she feels some loyalty and affection towards him at this point.
Â 
I thought it was kinda early for her to be giving him a coy smile as she struts down the stairs though.
4341	ahighbornlady	2014-06-02	I don't have a problem with Sansa's feathery dress. The Arryn sigil is the falcon, so I'd assume the lady of the Vale whose clothes Sansa is borrowing would have bird like features. The same way the Tully armor looked like fish scales last year. It's not a "feather, omg evil" thing at all.


Â 
I thought the feathers were a nod to her taking on Littlefinger's mockingbird sigil as Alayne.
4342	Petyr Patter	2014-06-02	Let me throw out a question.Â  Does anyone else suspect Littlefinger is going to be dead by the end of the season?
Â 
Basically, in this episode Littlefinger gets the Lords of the Vale on his side.Â  This is something he was still working on in A Feast for Crows.Â  Harold Hardyng seemed like a means to that end.Â  At this point, we are out of published book material for Sansa.Â  Suposedly, the Sansa chapter cut from A Dance of Dragons started a new plot for her.Â  The woods witch the Brotherhood goes to did prophecy Sansa would slay a giant... which is Baelish's family sigil.Â  So, a lot of poster think she will kill Baelish.Â  Maybe that death is coming sooner than we think.
Â 
Now, they could have used the entirity of next season to show Sansa developing her skills.Â  The only thing they needed to show was Sansa's skill as at lying, and that would have been enough.Â  Instead, they are RUSHING her as a "player."Â  Perhaps for a reason.Â 
Â 
Other thoughts.
All these thoughts of black birds, and no one thinks "crows," aka the Night's Watch where the only family Sansa knows is still alive is?Â  Worth to think about.
Sansa made that dress herself.Â  I think this is an intentional call back to episode 1, when she tells Cersei she makes her own dress.

Oh hey! That and the bastard image. Nice one, mate.Â 

Â 
Instead, they are RUSHING her as a "player." Perhaps for a reason.Â 

Yeah i think theres some sort of plot point that drops soon that may require a bump up in her development. Its a little quick and in-your-face, but i do know its more than just a ploy to get us to like her more. I know where part of her future plot is going but im not sure about what comes after that. So its kinda exciting. I think the raven dress is a bit much too soon but we'll see.
4344	Newstar	2014-06-02	Sansa made that dress herself.Â  I think this is an intentional call back to episode 1, when she tells Cersei she makes her own dress.
Â 
The fact that Sansa made it herself, along with jewelry that she herself selected, is a neat way of underlining that she is taking control of her own destiny. The purple Blackwater dress she was wearing earlier in the episode was one she received in KL that was probably made for her by the Lannisters, just as the ring she was wearing was one she received from the Lannisters.
Â 
The costume designer has talked about Sansa imitating her female role models through her hair and dress at various instances, but it's clear with her new hair and dress in the show that she's done imitating others, as her decisions to dye her hair and to dress as she does are entirely her own.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Yeah i think theres some sort of plot point that drops soon that may require a bump up in her development.
Â 
Maybe. It occurred to me after my initial excitement about D&D speeding through Sansa's AFFC arc that this Vale tour could just be a non-book filler arc to kill time.

Nah not this season. Too soon. Next season? Maybe but i dunno. That feels like a season 6 bomb.
4347	JonDunn	2014-06-02	I think LF dies in TWOW, 100 percent.Â
4348	Lady Sansa Stark	2014-06-02	Well, I have to say that they kinda killed book!Sansa in the show here, but booooooy how I loved this episode. I've separated book from show some time ago, so I don't really mind what they did in this episode. Sansa is becoming a player, and a lot faster than we think. I honestly haven't seen any negative comment about Sansa with regards to this episode (not on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr etc.) which makes me more happy than it should.Â

4350	Sun	2014-06-02	I keep wondering if Sansa in the Black Widow costume is a spoiler. I can't help thinking that it is.Â

I think with the changes they fast tracked Sansa's arc here, psychologically and mentally, past where we are in the books.Â

4351	Emperoreddy	2014-06-02	My guess is the storyline they are moving forward with from here with her is a Vale conspiracy story. The Lord's know who Sansa is, and I assume the wedding with Robin is still at least planned. LF's speech about about backing Robin since Robb Stark is dead. So the first time is to get the whole of the Vale to see Robin as a growing strong leader, not the weak sickly boy, and also for LF and I assume Sansa to get their fingers around him. Suddenly the Vale has a willing partner in the heir and the key to the north and her "mentor" and they can grow the power to push back the Lannester's and make their own play.
Â 
If their is any tension about Sansa's identity it will come from outside the Vale. The Bolton's or Cersei possibly learning who she is.
Â 
Though I do wonder about Robin. LF's speech about everyone dieing and then Sansa just appearing saying "ready to go?". I REALLY got this vibe that Robin isn't coming back from his tour of the Vale and these two know it.

Â 
Except that if Robin doesn't come back from their tour, what pretext does Littlefinger have for being Lord Protector of the Vale? Â With Robin dead, Royce & co. are likely to send LF packing while they keep Sansa and marry her to Harry-the-Heir (or, if they think she was complicit in the boy's death, send her to King's Landing in chains. Â Littlefinger needs Robin to live while he solidifies his hold on the Eyrie/Vale.

Â 


Â 
Â 
No, Sansa and LF still have to win over Sweet Robin - last interaction, Sansa slapped him while in the books he starts to think of her as both his mother and bedmate by the time they leave the Eyrie.
Â 
Also, Sansa needs to be shown to be gaining political skills, and to be piecing together slowly what LF is up to.
Â 
LF will not die this season. Maybe next season, but if so, not until near the end. The show has just changed up the order of things a bit for Sansa.
Â 
But for the rest of this season, Sansa's storyline will be pure plot development and no more major drama. The battle at the Wall, Tyrion's exit from KL, Stannis's arrival and Ramsay's betrothal to fArya will the the major drama points of the rest of this season.
Â 
And Arya leaving for Braavos I guess.

I drink your tears, fandom. I guzzle them!
Â 
Im so smug right now,Â I can barely stand me. Wowowowowwowow.Â 
So...Sansa totally plays LF like a fucking fiddle and its awesome. His visible shock was fantastic. While hes still convinced shes on his side and for now, i think she is. Because she doesnt knowÂ things yet. (she dont know about Ned yet. Thats when i think that shoe will drop.) She goes for a Villainous Costume Change. Or at least thats what it looks like. That dress is kinda vampy and im not convinced that Lysa actually had that in her closets. Hoo well, at least her hair is not red and shes gone full Alayne.Â 
Yeah see umm..i think these guys are going to actually not be super behind LF in the show either. They are gonna back Sansa and the idea of her union with Sweetrobin. I actually think this is whats up there.


Â 

I can't agree more.Â  My initial reaction was WTSF?, but then I realized that it actually didn't change too much of anything from a functional standpoint, especially considering Nestor Royce's non-existence.Â  Still, I can't help but feel like this is the episode where the show and the books officially became two completely separate entities.

Â 
Â 
She's a very pretty girl, but the dark hair didn't suit her and the hairstyle made her face seem more puffy. Â They could have dyed her hair a medium brown, it would have suited her complexion better.
4358	jons nissa	2014-06-02	My thoughts:
Â 
1. Yes, Sansa knows LF wants her and is playing it. LF implies she doesn't know what he wants, but clearly he does want Sansa, so he is vulnerable there even if Sansa doesn't know what he wants, otherwise, in the game - ie his intended power goals.
Â 
2. Sansa was modifying Lysa's dress when LF walked in to talk with her. She was adding "wings" to it. The Eagle is the sigil of House Arryn, and I am suspecting the goal is to make people mentally associate her with authority in the Vale and the Arryns.
Â 
3. She mentioned while revealing her identity to the Lords Declarant that the Lannisters have spies everywhere. I think everyone involved knows she needs to still play the part of Alayne. Her hair and new, regal, Arrynesque costume is for the part of Alayne - which is different than in the books. In the show Alayne is LF's niece, not a bastard, and LF is in charge in the Vale as Robert's guardian. Alayne will be betrothed to Robert Arryn, so her dress was modified to invoke House Arryn.
Â 
4. The Vale is officially in mourning for Lysa. That is why she was wearing black. So was LF you might have noticed. It is not about looking evil, but looking like she was in mourning. A mourning dress with Eagle wings. Brilliant.


Â 
actually when i first saw the outfit the only thing i could think of is she's truly becoming a bird now and i saw it as a reference to her "little bird" name but with a clear twist: she's not a parrot but more of a predator bird due to the black coloring. i would be very interested in hearing hbo's comments about this new look for her since they have been very purposeful with what she wears.
4359	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	Based on the "inside the episode" commentary, it seems like they're viewing this episode as her "pawn to player" moment. It feels rushed to me, but mayhaps her TWOW has a lot of content or something, so they needed an early jump on it?

4362	voodooqueen126	2014-06-02	We can always hope he dies young or gets Greyscale so can't touch her.
Another thought, I wonder if the controversial chapter is her taking credit for poisoning Joff? A sort of Lucrezia Borgia comparison would be interesting especially as she got out of her marriage due to non-consummation and despite her reputation probably never poisoned anyone (still hoping she is not stuck being a Lannister).


Well. Being married to a leper would be dangerous.. however...
years ago my Dad's first wife was at a butcher, and she listened to this conversation between two women it went something like this.
"Well Doris, you've finally done it, he's dead"
"Yes Barbara, and all it took was 12 years of feeding him nothing but roast pork."
Given that people with dwarfism are quite prone to obesity, so it wouldn't be hard to feed Tyrion until he develops obesity related heart failure and diabetes and dies at an early age.
All without poisoning anyone. And she'd be what? 27, that's still young enough to remarry and have children that aren't related to Tywin Lannister or Joffrey.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Well, I can't see any particular rational reason why the Lords Declarant needed to know that Sansa was Sansa. The most wanted criminal in Westeros is staying at the Eyrie, and they just assume that loose lips won;t sink ships? That is not LF's style, nor should Sansa be that cavalier about her own safety.
Â 
I understand that the show has nipped a bit into Sansa's AFFC story with having the Vale lords there at all, but remember that Sansa has zero time in ADWD, so if they burn through her AFFC stuff too fast, or negate it, what have they got left? (One episode of her coming down the mountain with Robin, at most?)


Â 
My reaction to this scene was "OMG Sansa is a big idiot in this scene! Does the name Tywin Lannister mean nothing to her?" Â She could never reveal herself until atleast Tywin was dead.


Sansa is playing LF and they are making it seem that LF is falling for it...I don't know what i feel about it. Book LF would not fall for that or be reliant on Sansa but tv!LF i guess would.Â 
I don't believe Sansa 'gave herself' to LF. She is making it seem like she wants him


I think LF and Tyrion have something in common: they (and frankly most humans) want their lovers to genuinely love and desires them, rather than some reward. I don't think LF would trust a Sansa who more or less tells him "I know you want me and I will screw you to get what I want"*. For LF to be destroyed by Sansa, he has to genuinely trust her, frankly that sewing scene with Sansa... she was only marginally more trust worthy than Margaery Tyrell.

I agree with you there. Mourning wear is supposed to be modest, yet the dress was rather vampish... Which seems rather inappropriate for a girl who is pretending to mourn her aunt's suicide.

Yeah that too.

And I agree that her story is likely very full in WoW - so that is why things are moving fast for her here.
4365	High without honor	2014-06-02	I really wonder how they will advance the plot, since they basically skipped all the remaining chapters and radically changed Sansa. I would have loved to see the scene where LF is negotiating with the Lords of the Vale, that was pretty good.

4367	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-02	So is it safe to assume Sansa fans can put the term "agency" to bed for one single week?Â

Â 
no it is really not that complicated. They rearranged things to make the season better, but some of the stuff they skipped over will be used now in a different way.
Â 
They will show her gaining Robin's trust.
Â 
They will show her piecing together LF's actions.
Â 
They will show her building relationships in the Vale.
Â 
Shuffling her story around a bit was about pacing the show in general IMO. This way her story could climax on it's own, and not be overshadowed by the battle at the Wall and other climactic events this season. I think it was smart.
Â 
The stuff they left out will be used now, and more engaging to watch because of all the intrigue and character transformation that surrounds it.
4369	jet199	2014-06-02	The necklace she wears looks somewhat like a leash. (I see some awful Sadomaso fanfic coming...)


It actually reminded me a bit of the Meereenese costumes. I wonder if we have Dany in the "tokar" next season the show will be drawing comparisons between the two of them.

Yes, given how few published Sansa chapter's there were after the Purple Wedding, they really should've paced things out more slowly, like they completely left out the the scene at the Fingers, or the fact that Lysa tells her to dye her hair... I have no idea why they jumped into (if this scene foreshadows TWOW winter material) what should have been late season 5 or early season 6 material.
And sure they were going for Pawn to Player, but couldn't this have been done a little bit more subtly, i mean she sort of went straight from a girl who was like "Can my family come to my wedding with Loras" to "I Know what you want Petyr"...
Â 
And yes that necklace was awful, not at all suitable to a girl with such small/delicate features.Â

The second she revealed herself, I cursed at the second likely spoiler of the season. Since then, however, I have altered my view on the situation. LF was played like a trump card by an empty-headed girl, and that was significant. And that smile she gave LF was one of the creepiest, most disturbing things I've seen this season.
4372	greensleeves	2014-06-02	Her reveal to the Vale Lords kind of fits (I think most people suspect that some of the Book!Lords know anyways). Â It's nice to see her gaining agency. Â The TV show is doing it in a more sudden, in-your-face manner, but that's TV for you.
Â 
Sansa 'taking the black' was pretty dramatic. Â It wouldn't seem to support the image she's trying to project politically, but the outlandish badass element makes up for the illogic in my book.
4373	Hippocras	2014-06-02	sign.
Â 
Think how badly the season would have been paced if they had done all those things in the same order as the books.Â 
Â 
We would have Sansa on a road trip with LF, Arya on a road trip with Sandor, Pod on a road trip with Brienne and a bunch of random talk between Tyrion and visitors. All development and no action.
Â 
The shifts made in Sansa's storyline were absolutely essential to making an exciting and smooth season.
Â 
The stuff they left out can be used now, as the other stories climax, and early in season 5, when it will be ok for her story to be all development and no action because our curiosity about her future is piqued and because the action will be elsewhere.
Â 
It was a really good move.
Â 
Now Sansa and LF are leaving with Robin on a tour of the Vale. They will go to the Fingers soon.
Â 
Meanwhile it is ok to add another road trip to the show now, because Arya's is ending, and Brienne's will soon enough as well.

4374	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	I think it was a good move too. And seeing as we're at the halfway point in the story (according to D&D), showing that she isÂ not a silly, empty-headed girl but in fact very astute and in control I think was essential. The TV audiences don't benefit from her internal monologues. I think they needed her to have a move like this to keep their interest.
Â 
I am wondering if we won't be seeing her in 4x10 though. That last scene with her bird of prey outfit felt very much like a season cliffhanger.
4375	Beorn Snow	2014-06-02	Count me in the camp that says this was too quick of a change. But alright ... guess this means someone has to finish TWOW asap!

Yes, I wonder what the repercussion of the Vale Lords knowing about Sansa will be.
Also that moment where Sansa looked at Baelish whilst Anya Waynwood comforted her was the moment when I switched from "Why is the show making Sansa such an idiot" to "OMG they are aiming for smart, but just don't understand how to do it".
4377	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-06-02	Sansa is confirmed in Episode 10. We will probably see her again, in at least one scene.
Â 
Now that's it's been some hours, I can safely say that this episode was not what I expected at all. First, Sansa revealed who she was to the Lord Declarants - That was actually very surprising and I had to keep myself from yelling OMG because I especially thought that was quite spoiler-ish. I think there's also a big foreshadow about the Vale Lords declaring for Sansa. ("Robb Stark is dead.") I think that may be material for 4x10, or the episode could end in the book!scene where Petyr reveals his plans to Sansa (Which would be weird now, that she has gained the upper hand).
Â 
That Sansa planned that was quite interesting, and It was obvious they wanted to show Sansa's development from Pawn to Player (Even if at LF's expense), and the bedroom scene was also quite straight-forward, where Sansa basically says that she knows what LF wants. That, combined with Sansa's last scene, walking down the stairs, fully dressed like Alayne, makes me wonder. That's certainly not book!Sansa. At least, not yet.
Â 
The dress reminded me of Petyr rather than Disney Villains. It tried to convey some mockingbird connection, or at least it seemed from my point-of-view. LF wears black, and Sansa seems to mimick him in her attire as Alayne. Which makes sense, since she is his niece (Is Alayne Bastard in the series?)
4378	ToTheWolves	2014-06-02	Was my mind playing tricks on me? She did dye her hair in last nights episode correct? It looked black as she was glowing coming down the stairs.
4379	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-02	I'm guessing theyre advancing past a bunch of boring crap GRRM wrote for her in aFFC...I loved her story but we dont need to see a chapter of her descending from the Eyrie with SR and whatever useless plot dragging there was that I've blocked out.
Â 
They can easily twist her advanced plot arc around by adding her being more involved in Vale intrigue...theres a reason they fast forwarded her. We'll find out next season.
4380	High without honor	2014-06-02	I think it was a good move too. And seeing as we're at the halfway point in the story (according to D&D), showing that she isÂ not a silly, empty-headed girl but in fact very astute and in control I think was essential. The TV audiences don't benefit from her internal monologues. I think they needed her to have a move like this to keep their interest.
Â 
I am wondering if we won't be seeing her in 4x10 though. That last scene with her bird of prey outfit felt very much like a season cliffhanger.


Â 
Either they cut some scenes or we will see more of Sansa in episode 10. Like this one for example:Â http://youtu.be/W1Wv1sPygc4?t=11s

4381	ArabellaVidal	2014-06-02	Let me throw out a question.Â  Does anyone else suspect Littlefinger is going to be dead by the end of the season?
Â 
Basically, in this episode Littlefinger gets the Lords of the Vale on his side.Â  This is something he was still working on in A Feast for Crows.Â  Harold Hardyng seemed like a means to that end.Â  At this point, we are out of published book material for Sansa.Â  Suposedly, the Sansa chapter cut from A Dance of Dragons started a new plot for her.Â  The woods witch the Brotherhood goes to did prophecy Sansa would slay a giant... which is Baelish's family sigil.Â  So, a lot of poster think she will kill Baelish.Â  Maybe that death is coming sooner than we think.
Â 
Now, they could have used the entirity of next season to show Sansa developing her skills.Â  The only thing they needed to show was Sansa's skill as at lying, and that would have been enough.Â  Instead, they are RUSHING her as a "player."Â  Perhaps for a reason.Â 
Â 
Other thoughts.All these thoughts of black birds, and no one thinks "crows," aka the Night's Watch where the only family Sansa knows is still alive is?Â  Worth to think about.Sansa made that dress herself.Â  I think this is an intentional call back to episode 1, when she tells Cersei she makes her own dress.

That's a good call regarding the dress. I was watching a YouTube review for this episode and the non book reader commentator said that she looked like she was dressed for the Night's Watch. That immediately made me think that this is a subtle hint towards the Jon Snow connection that Sansa makes at the end of AFfC.
I don't think Petyr is going to die soon. Not unless they change the story and have Arya and the Hound actually meet her this season. At this point, Sansa realises that Petyr is willing to go to severe lengths for her. He promised her vengeance and killed Lysa to protect her. She wants Winterfell. Petyr is the only person within miles with sufficient cunning to get that for her. She has consciously decided to use him for this. I believe this might be a hint to the lengths that Sansa will go to achieve her ends, and what Ran alluded to when he said that a future Sansa chapter in tWoW will be controversial amongst her fans.
I do think though that again the show has short-changed LF. However, how good was the reference to his Braavosi roots? A definite nod to fans.
4382	Bran's Legs	2014-06-02	Sansa's transformation is now complete, and the show did an excellent job of condensing a lot of GRRM's meandering prose into one episode, so bravo there. Here's my take on Sansa â<U+0080><U+0094> where she has come from, and then a stab at where she's going.
Â 
I posted this first thought on the discussion thread, but I'll repeat it here. Many people have argued that Sansa's character development has been rushed, but the opposite is actually true. Sansa has been learning the game since the first book and her education has been the worst kind. She was manipulated and used first by Cersei and then by Littlefinger, two of the most duplicitous characters in King's Landing. She was tortured by Joeffrey, beaten by Meryn Trant, coerced into selling out her father and then forced to watch Ned's execution. Sansa is like the pawn that survived the chessboard and now she has been transformed into a queen.
Â 
Put another way, Sansa's new persona as a player in the game is a product of Cersei and Littlefinger. I view Cersei as Sansa's "game mother" and Littlefinger as Sansa's "game father." In the Blackwater episode in Season 2, when the high-born ladies are holed up in the Red Keep, Cersei gets drunk and tells Sansa something important: "Have I shocked you, little dove. Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it."
Â 
Fast-forward to The Viper and the Mountain and we see Sansa finally using her womanhood as a weapon in the game. There has been a lot of hot air on this board about Sansa being seduced by Littlefinger, but it's actually the other way around. It was Littlefinger himself who told Sansa, "when you know what someone wants, you can control them."
Â 
LITTLEFINGER: "Do you think you know me?"
SANSA: "I know what you want."
LITTLEFINGER: "Do you."
Â 
And then the slightly open-mouthed seduction lookâ<U+0080>¦all while knitting her new raven dress...
Â 
The next scene with Sansa we see her getting ready to leave the Eyrie with Robyn. Sansa emerges from the corridor with the sun at her back to accentuate her "wings." This "little bird" has flown the coop. So many bird reference for Sansa â<U+0080>¦ "little bird" from the Hound, "little dove" from Cersei and then there is Robyn and that little weirdo always wanting to "make the bad people fly" and, of course, Littlefinger has chosen a mockingbird for his new sigil.Â 
Â 
Lady, Sansa's wolf, was killed early in the first book, and I'm still trying to work through its symbolism. At first I thought that meant Sansa would be the first to die (or sacrificed, to be more specific) to the game. Now I just think it set up a long slow burn throughout the entire series that will end with Sansa killing Cersei.
Â 
EDIT: Oh, almost forgot, Cersei in Blackwater tells Sansa, "tears aren't a woman's only weapon"â<U+0080>¦ and then Hound in the Mountain and the Viper tells Arya, "poison is a woman's weapon"â<U+0080>¦.Pretty sure you can figure out the rest.

Â 
yes it's possible that the Lord Arryn tour of the Vale road trip will be mostly next season. There will be one more scene with her I think, but it will be development not action - so I am thinking something that shows LF's bribes and manipulations, and Sansa taking over as Robin's "mother".
Â 
Her new outfit will probably be her outfit for much of the next season I suspect - as long as she is Alayne. The costumes don't change all that often.
4384	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	Â 
I think LF and Tyrion have something in common: they (and frankly most humans) want their lovers to genuinely love and desires them, rather than some reward. I don't think LF would trust a Sansa who more or less tells him "I know you want me and I will screw you to get what I want"*. For LF to be destroyed by Sansa, he has to genuinely trust her, frankly that sewing scene with Sansa... she was only marginally more trust worthy than Margaery Tyrell.
Â 
Â 
*(Winterfell and vengeance on the Lannisters)
Â 


Well that may very well be true. All LF wanted was Catelyn to love him, now he has a catelyn mini-me, Sansa and he can't help but falter around her. I think this episode completely undermined LF's character more than it did Sansa. We all knew Sansa would get to the player stage, although i think they have done this a little too soon, in such a crowded episode they could have saved this for another episode or future season. So Sansa suddenly having some balls wasn't surprising, a bit oddly placed though. They seem to be passing over development and theres no 'gradual' in this season, it's very straight to the point. What pissed me off is that LF would NEVER come into a trial situation without a plan, or even conversation with Sansa before hand to confirm the story, and whilst he lives, LF would never be played by someone like Sansa. and Sansa would never be so obvious about her intentions.Â 
Â 
For LF to be surprised or even lost for words is absolutely ridiculous. he is an experienced player. Sure Sansa has seen a lot in Kings Landing but it was just last episode where she didn't know anything and now suddenly, she knows how to lie and manipulate? No. If this was Arya, yes. Sansa is not like this.

4386	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-06-02	Sophie Turner stating that Sansa starts to manipulate the unmanipulatable just really came to make sense this episode. Damn, that was anÂ interesting twist and very quick as well (not thatÂ i am complaining) butÂ it does seem that Sansa has some large amount of content and some very awesome stuff coming down the roadÂ in TWoW & ADoS. Otherwise, thereÂ is NO reason to just change her from pawn to player within one episode.Â

Â 
Kind of how I felt about it, but I think her "gradual" arc that she has in ASOS/AFFC wouldn't have worked so well through the TV medium.Â 
LF is getting sloppy in AFFC, but it is odd that he had such a lack of any plan. And I agree Book!Sansa wouldn't be that obvious, but I think without us being privy to her thoughts, Show!Sansa has to take more of a direct route.
Â 
But overall, I just loved it. It was the Sansa mothafu**ing Stark Â of Winterfell show this week and it was glorious.
Â 
Also, my last comment on her dress, but it was definitely warlock tier 8.
4388	Hippocras	2014-06-02	Frankly her transformation has spanned the entire season. I don't know why people are calling it sudden.
Â 
Right away on the boat with LF we could SEE her processing the fact that she needed to become a player. We can see her trying to figure out the game. When he touched her hair on the boat she knew she could use his attraction to her, just as Cersei told her during the battle of the blackwater that she could, and as Shae told her there was only one thing men want with women.
Â 
We could see her calculating looks in scenes with Lysa and Robin too.
Â 
It was NOT sudden, anyone saying so just did not pick up the clues.

Â 
Any ideas what ep10 could entail for her? (If she's in it at all)
Â 
We know from previews that there is a scene with Sansa emerging from a room looking major pissed but she still has her red hair in that so it must've been cut 
Â 
Then there is the scene showing LF in what looks like golden pyjamas, could Sansa be visiting him in the night?
4390	Mithras	2014-06-02	Â 
Let me throw out a question.Â  Does anyone else suspect Littlefinger is going to be dead by the end of the season?


Â 
I would not be surprised to see that. You know that I believe in the theory that LF will try to rape Sansa and she will slay him. It is only a matter of time.

4392	JonBranRickon	2014-06-02	I agree, I really thinkSansa has always been able to get what she wants.Â  The only change in IMO is that under Petyr she sno longer acts like a child.Â  She has been a manipulator all along.Â

Â 
Yeah, that angle last night made me a little queasy, but just because Show Sansa does it, I don't know if Book Sansa will since IMO, HBO Sansa is a lot smarter than Book Sansa. Â 
Â 
I guess we know, but then, I suppose we always knew, that the Vale lords will find out who she is and back her. Â It was Â little bit of a let down for a such a huge plot element
4394	Banner Without Brothers	2014-06-02	On the boat she was being taught the game. The episode after that she's still on the boat, in the cabin this time and all she does is repeat what LF had told her last time. The episode after that she's building snow castles. This episode she's the female Machiavelli. It is quite a transformation.

Â 
NoÂ idea what to think ,because until now,Â i had the notion that he will try to rape her andÂ it will be the breaking point for Sansa that causes her to stab him with the dagger thus fulfilling the prophecy as well. But after this episode.....
Â 
IÂ think that Sansa will start to question/find answers (what LF did to Ned) next season. With Bronze Yohn Royce mentioning Ned and all that...she will probably start putting things together. Also the fact that her outfit pretty much mimicked a crow, couldÂ it be aÂ subtle reference to Jon? Â They could be the first Starks to meet after all.Â

4397	Lord Damian	2014-06-02	All of this confirms for me that Sansa will known in the books, if not already, by high lords in the Vale to be who she is. I wonder how the Mad Mouse will play into this in the books? Sansa though,I believe will be Aegon VI queen in exchange for Vale swords in his attempt to take the Iron Throne. She will be the younger, more beautiful Queen that casts Cersei down, not Arianne Martell, there is no connection to Cercei there but there is with Sansa, big time. This also makes me think Margeary will lose her trial and be removed in order to make room for this to move foreward.
4398	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	She already is.Â  You don't have to have sex to manipulate someone.Â 


Â 
Agreed. But Paperweaver has often argued LF is going to rape/attempt to rape Sansa (and provided a lot of textual evidence to support this). I'm saying that after this episode, it seems likelier that a physical encounter between the two would be of a different nature than an attempted rape.

I believe she has been manipulating people all along.Â  Joffery, didn't touch her, The Hound basically reapeated her words back to her whe her at the battle of Blackwater, Tyrion couldn't/wouldn't have sex with her,Â  Petyr is doing her bidding.Â  Only perhaps Joffrey was not under her spell but he was crazy.Â Â Â  The onlything changing here is that she no longer using her child like manipulation.
4402	Ranzadule	2014-06-02	The differences between the Sansa of this episode and the Sansa of the book are numerous and I think portentous. (Is that a word?)
One of the great things about this series is that the differences with the book offer some answers, questions and insights. I am certain now that Sansa is making the dramatic change from "stupid little rich girl" to a marvelous Machiavellian femme fatale with a hitlist at least as long as her little sister's. I approve. Â
4403	Inv1ctus	2014-06-02	Sad thing is that George has no one to blame but himself for this. He's had plenty of time to finish this series but he is milking this cash cow for all that is worth at the expense of his series, potential, legacy. If the show finishes before the books it just will not be the same as it could have been. George has said in many of interviews he enjoys his dump trucks full of money. The world traveling, the writing an episode a season, the side projects, the tv spots, etc are all things that take GRRM out of the one room he will write in and further delay the release of this damn book, let alone another after it. And it's looking more and more like the show is going to pass the books before it's all said and done, especially knowing that TWOW is not coming out this year. It will be a real slap in the face to his avid readers for them to have to avoid the internet for 5 years while he finishes ADOS because he wanted to cash in.


Â 
Blame himself for what? I really doubt he feels bad about this. He is doing a lot of things now instead of writing yeah, but before the series began he was probably spending a huge amount of time for the books. So I say let him live a little.  About the slap in the face, I think the slap will be just fine towards many of spoiling morons out there, the tables will be turned a little bit, which is fun. By this time next year, the show will be ahead of the most storylines from the books. I really believe his motivation for writing is gone. He knows how the story ends and he also knows that the story will be told either way, if he ever writes all the books or not.Â

She'll have about the same screen time as she did this season. Like Theon, they can't push her aside. She is a main character.
4410	ArabellaVidal	2014-06-02	/@Bran's legs
You're forgetting that Margaery has also had a part in Sansa's development in the show, if not in the books. 
I also think that the show has rapidly changed her because the actress is much older and is sort of a compensation for book-Sansa's developing sexuality. The Hound is not ever present in her thoughts on the show, there is no Dontos pursuing her constantly, no Tyrion baring himself before her sexually and being rejected, no Marillion trying to rape her. There is just Petyr. The Sansa of the novels is already on a rapid sexual trajectory that the shows just hasn't explored yet. The book reader is aware that she has her own particular leanings and is in some way capable of dealing with this side of Petyr. The show hasn't done that and they need the viewer to know that Sansa is not a naive little girl anymore. Shows usually have a more visual way of conveying this. Sophie Turner hadn't been the right age to portray her sexual development in a show that would have garnered a negative response to any such scene. They apparently are making up for all that lack in this one episode.

Love it. I want a supercut of everyone who's ever underestimated her (Cersei saying there's not much of the North in her, Olenna saying she was boring, etc.) and then splice it next to her "let's blow this joint" moment.
Â 


I suspect Season 5 will have less of Sansa and more GreyJoy and Martell -Â  Also, when is Baylon going to mysteriously die?


Â 
Yeah, I'm thinking that her role will be paired down (though firmly in TWOW material). Balon may die early next season to setup the Kingsmoot. I thought this might be cut at first, but they were creating buy-in with Yara and her Dreadfort adventures, so now not so sure.

4413	LordToo-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse	2014-06-02	Sansa, the black swan made me remember
Â 
Rogue prince spoiler:
Â 

	Spoiler The Lyseni became especially loathed, for they claimed more than coin from passing ships, taking off women, girls, and comely young boys to serve in their pleasure gardens and pillow houses. (Amongst those thus enslaved was Lady Johanna Swann, a fifteen-year-old niece of the Lord of Stonehelm. When her infamously niggardly uncle refused to pay the ransom, she was sold to a pillow house, where she rose to become the celebrated courtesan known as the Black Swan, and ruler of Lys in all but name. Alas, her tale, however fascinating, has no bearing upon our present history).


Â
4414	Mithras	2014-06-02	Thinking about it, I think the show is also moving to the point that LF will purposefully rape Sansa to get her completely under his power and decrease her value as a precious maid. From LFâ<U+0080><U+0099>s point of view, Sansa might offer her hand to a lordâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son to have them arrest LF for the crime of killing Lysa and Joffrey. LF has no army whereas the Vale lords might raise 20k swords quickly.
Â 
If LF rapes Sansa and claims her maidenhead, Sansa cannot convince the Vale Lords about the true nature of LF. They will think that Sansa and LF are lovers and conspired together to kill Lysa. After all, she told them about the kiss and the jealousy of Lysa and how she committed suicide. These will all be questioned if she goes to them sobbing and claiming that LF raped her.
Â 
This strategy of LF (i.e. raping Sansa) sounds somewhat similar to how Vargo Hoat maimed Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand for the book readers.

Sophie Turner hadn't been the right age to portray her sexual development in a show that would have garnered a negative response to any such scene. They apparently are making up for all that lack in this one episode.


In the past her sexuality was one of being unaware of her sexuality (girlish) ... The show has turned her into a women much like Cersei.Â  That is a big change not yet explored in the books.
4418	voodooqueen126	2014-06-02	it was good scene at the end when Sansa finally stands proud. I just don't like her progression. Especially this early in the series. I don't agree with it at all.


Â 
I too would love a scene where Sansa manipulates LF, befriends Anya Waynwood and Bronze Yohn Royce... however in the former, LF should notÂ knowÂ that he is being manipulated, for the reason below.


Â 
I don't see neither book LF nor show LF like to be manipulated. Book LF clearly hated Tyrion for outplaying him. Show LF saw that Sansa is not Lysa.


Basically LF, doesn't like being manipulated (nobody does frankly) or being beaten (though LF is an unnaturally sore loser), so LF should believe the whole time that Sansa is a sweet innocent little girl, and truly believe it when she seems to come to love him... until that absolute moment when the axe falls.

Isn't Bran? He's in 4 episodes this season.


I meant that her screen time will remain consistent with previous seasons. Bran hasn't had much screen time in previous seasons either.
Â 
Exactly voodooqueen126, its just too early. totally out of character, and yes too obvious. LF now knows Sansa can be a master manipulator and that she is using him, unless he is completely blinded by his infatuation with her. Would not be surprised, honestly, they have already done so much disservice to his character.

4420	Ranzadule	2014-06-02	All of this talk of Sansa has gotten me interested enough to rewatch the episode. I was sitting there watching but thinking "C'MON!!!! Â Let's get to the Viper and the Mountain ALREADY!!!!!!!"Â 
I need to have another look. My kid was devastated by the duel.Â

You're forgetting that Margaery has also had a part in Sansa's development in the show, if not in the books.
I also think that the show has rapidly changed her because the actress is much older and is sort of a compensation for book-Sansa's developing sexuality. The Hound is not ever present in her thoughts on the show, there is no Dontos pursuing her constantly, no Tyrion baring himself before her sexually and being rejected, no Marillion trying to rape her. There is just Petyr. The Sansa of the novels is already on a rapid sexual trajectory that the shows just hasn't explored yet. The book reader is aware that she has her own particular leanings and is in some way capable of dealing with this side of Petyr. The show hasn't done that and they need the viewer to know that Sansa is not a naive little girl anymore. Shows usually have a more visual way of conveying this.

Great point. I don't remember the Tyrion bit, though.

Â 
I think it just depends. Theon's screentime was cut down this season. Don't get me wrong: I'm hoping for as much Sansa screentime as possible. I'm just saying there's probably room for her role to be paired down a bit moving forward.

Â 
I agree, and Book!Sansa does play her cards very close to her chest. I don't think Show!Sansa has the luxury to be so subtle, because then the showrunners would risk her being misunderstood as actually being the stupid, silly little girl. I don't like how heavy-handed it was, but I understand it, and am excited for what it means moving forward.
4423	ctid1977	2014-06-02	Just a minor point but I really liked the actors who played Yon Royce and the female lord (who I remember is in AFFC but her name escapes me). Even without any introductions they did a good job and had enough presence to threaten Littlefinger.Â 

I'm with you there. I've seen them both before too. Getting suitable gravitas in two new and minor roles was really well done.
As for the rest of the sansa scenes, I didn't mind any of the changes. I really enjoyed it and it was great to watch sansa play everybody including littlefinger. I missed yohn's runes though.
4424	Dreams Of Spring	2014-06-02	I've read the books but one thing I never could understand is who Alayne is supposed to be, is she going to be Petyr's protege? Please tell me that Sansa is not going to be another Cersei... I can't bare it, I love Sansa, but seeing her in all black and lying just made me sad ...

Â 
Hmm, good points re: Sansa's sexual development in the book. I suppose the frustrating part about show!Sansa for me is that we're obviously not in her head, so there's no way of truly understanding her emotional progression. This makes the sudden transformation feel insincere to me.Â
4426	Grayven	2014-06-02	Just a minor point but I really liked the actors who played Yon Royce and the female lord (who I remember is in AFFC but her name escapes me).Â 


Â 
It was an interesting visual, as well. Â There were several moments where they appeared to be almost a painting.. as if they were sitting in a mural, with only the actors faces peering through a round cutout face.

Would not be surprised, honestly, they have already done so much disservice to his character.


FOr all the manipulative stuff LF has done, it is abundantly clear that he is a one man woman.Â  It is also easy to see that he will do anything for the woman he loves and remains loyal even when the object of his obsession is married and in love with someone else.Â  Is it possible that the sole reason for his manipulation and his participation in the game was for Catelyn?Â Â  If so, his desire transfererd to Sansa and unlike her mother, Sansa is more capable and willing to use her power.Â Â 
Â 
In short, I don't see LF seeing himself as being manipulated.Â  Love is his blind spot.
4428	Muggle	2014-06-02	Speechless. Sansa reveals herself to the Lord Declarants. Uncharted territory entered now. Seven hells I don't know how to react. And now she's Brown/Black haired with a Dark Phoenix/ Katniss/ Gothic Vixen look ? This is just too much to deal with. I'm quite concerned about the many possible implications of what we've seen.


Â 
The black dress is a sign of mourning for her aunt lysa
4429	JonBranRickon	2014-06-02	While obvious, I never thought about the color.Â  I was focused on the feathers and her coming out as a woman.

LF is a one woman man, yes. But he's also not stupid. He always has a plan, hence marillion, hence having lords present during and after the wedding. LF wanted to gain power to somehow impress Catelyn and win her back, he also wanted power because lack of it cost him a lot in his childhood- embarrassment and not being 'good enough' as a match for Catelyn. Now Catelyn is dead. LF is supposed to slowly falter around Sansa because she is the link to his only weakness- Catelyn and he slowly puts trust in her as she proves herself worthy of keeping secrets. The fact that Sansa had to save his ass from the lords of the Eyrie just makes LF look amateur, which he is definitely not in the books, more of an evil mastermind.
Â 
LF has complete control over Sansa in the books. In this episode it showed that in fact Sansa had control over LF's fate. Which is completely wrong in my opinion. What will drive Sansa to finally become a player or act out in the books is her tiring of being used all the time. LF wants to use her to gain power of the north, vale and riverlands. That's why he saved her. He does not actually love her- he might desire her, but these are two different things. And Sansa certainly does not lead him on. But Sansa doesn't know yet that LF wants to marry her to harry the heir. So why would she go all sansa stark on him. she's supposed to be quiet Alayne.
4431	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-02	I'm still working out how I feel about this. See, my problem with the whole thing right now is that, based on D&D's track record, I just can't be sure if this is actual character development from TWOW that they've moved forward, or if it's just more character assassination in service of making Sansa a "badass," like they've already done for Robb, Brienne, Dany, Arya, etc. -- just erasing the confused, lonely, insecure aspects of all their characters to make them more palatable for the audience.

I would agree with everything you've said if GRRM did not have a penchant for making his characters gray and I believe you are making my point.Â  What is LF motivation?Â Â  I believe it is love, it is the only thing that makes LF human/likeable and again a blind spot.

I tend to agree with this, LF is basically a sociopath, I think his notion of love is completely different from what normal people think of as love.
I've said it before, and I will say it again: Littlefinger is like a super intelligent version of those men who throw acid on women's face as revenge for being rejected. Catelyn rejected him, and he therefore destroys not only her family, but also her whole country.
It would be like me somehow inciting a war against Â Jordan, because a Jordanian guy rejected me in high school.
That's why Book Sansa has to play her cards so close to her chest: LF can't think for a moment that Sansa could be a threat to him, because the man would ruthlessly destroy her if he thought it was in his self interest.Â

Â 
My point is LF wants power (for reasons stated in my last post) full stop. He is not motivated by love, and if he is it's one sided, so by definition can't be love. Love is when two individuals share the same feelings. Thats my point, LF isn't supposed to be likeable in the book, he is an absolute asshole to everyone including Catelyn, the only thing he didn't do to her is organise her death. and this is because he 'loves' her and has some sick fantasy they can be together.

  Â thank you. Sansa needs to be inward about her motivations or else LF will be rid of her at the first chance he gets. The only reason she is getting by now, is that he thinks she is on his team. My problem with this episode is book!LF would see straight through Sansa's attempt to be...seductive? I don't know what it was. Maybe it was the way it was scripted, acted or shot, it just wasn't right.
4435	Chebyshov	2014-06-02	I think you guys are giving LF way too much credit. This is a guy who's plan hinges on the Vale Lords not seeing through a bottle of hair dye (which they obviously do; this episode confirms that they know who Sansa is). He's losing his touch, and both Book and Show!Sansa understand his weakness. She'll be giant-slaying in no time.
4436	voodooqueen126	2014-06-02	Having said that, ages ago, I was reading GRRM's not a blog on livejournal and he was like "go watch Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby... Btw Baelish shares a few characteristics with Jay Gatsby, however the Littlefinger of the show is a whole other creature." so maybe GRRM regards Littlefinger as romantic in the same way that Jay Gatsby is romantic.
Even if Littlefinger comes across as a sociopathic, hyper intelligent version of an acid thrower to me, it is possible that this is not the author's intention. His weakness really could be 'love'.

Sansa is playing her cards right and LF is a sociopath all that is true.Â  I'm really tryinig to explain how/why show Sansa, is more brazen at this point?Â  No doubt he doesn't realize it and it because all he can see is a younger better looking Catelyn.Â  He gets to relive his fantasy all over again.Â  From his perspective it is love - not by the norms of rational people.

Â 
Show!Sansa is more brazen because I think D&D were worried any subtlety would be lost in the TV medium. I disagree with that assessment, but I don't Empowered!Sansa, so I have no problem watching it.
Â 
In the "inside the episode" (on HBOGo), D&D are very clear that Sansa has "figured out what LF wants" and that she knows she's a weird hybrid of his childhood fantasy/almost daughter fantasy. As to if LF knows he's being played, I think he knows she's no foolish girl. But he might just have a hard-on thinking that he's taught her well, rather than fearing for himself (like he should). But I doubt he totally trusts her, given she looked him in the face and said [paraphrasing] "you're the devil I know."

Yes...now you see my point.Â Â  In addition is it not unlike GRRM to take the thrill of LF's death away from us?Â  I can see his last words being about love and how Sansa has betrayed him.Â  We will then be left with this juxtaposition of LF being the romatincÂ  and Sansa being the puppet master of the worlds greatest puppet master.Â  If Sansa knows anything, it is child like romances and how to nurse one.

i dont think you're giving him enough credit. even if the vale lords secretly knew about alayne being sansa, the show proves nothing. they had to take this direction because they didn't have marillion. I agree towards the end of AFFC he is loosing his touch. but his murder of Lysa was calculated and in no way would Sansa overpower him in this moment.

Show Sansa has nothing to do with her book component at this point. She is brazen because they had to have her lie and say that story to the vale lords because lack of marillion, the scape goat.

It was a strange comment, because GRRM made LF sound almost positive you know? Â Like his love, rather than his use of power to gain love, was what he had in common with Jay Gatsby.
(Though obviously they have that in common as well)
Â 
Â 
I for one actually think that Jay Gatsby a creep, but the book makes it clear that Daisy is shallow and her husband is an awful human being...

When I refer to her being brazen, I am actually talking about her choice of provoactive clothing at the end of the episode.Â  The Vale lords rant was more helpless Sansa.Â  She is now a woman, sure of her sexuality and flaunting it brazenly in front of LF.Â

Â 
Yeah, she knows she's gotten the upper-hand (as does he), because she knows his weakness, and she isÂ using it. It was also very bold of her basically say this to him (with that look).

There was no Marillion equivalent because they wanted to do it this way, not the other way around.
Â 
Unrelatedly, after this, I find the "niece" change even weirder.Â  A lot of us thought that Sansa was going to pull the "daughter" card in this episode, but obviously that didn't happen, so...why was her pretending to be his daughter a line the show apparently thought too far to cross?

We see LF slipping at the end of AFFC, but it's obvious the show is going to whip through that content (and barely touch it), so they needed to show him slipping earlier. And have this Sansa moment earlier.

I would argue that "Sansa moment" has not yet occurred in the books, LOL, despite it being obvious it will occur sooner or later.
Â 
I can't disagree w/GRRM interpretation of his own character, but LF as Jay Gatsby? WTF. Â LF is a destructive, malevolent asshole who kills people to get ahead. Â Jay Gatsby was a bootlegger. Â However, I guess that does tell us that LF love for Cat was real, something that has been much discussed.

Â

Yes, i agree and I also believe they needed to develop a Stark finally getting the hang of things with Jon, Arya and Bran's storyline developing more in the next book.

Â 
Yeah, but, as per usual...they've opened themselves up to a lot of plot complications...with the Vale lords knowing she is Sansa Stark.
Â 
I wonder if this means that the Harry the Heir marriage, where LF intends to reveal her true identitiy, is never going to happen, because everyone would already know it. Â What do you think?

Sansa revealing herself to the Vale lords was a neat bit of insurance. If LF acts up or something happens to him, she can go crying to the lords for protection, and if the Vale lords act up or try to sell her out, she can fall back on LF.
Also, Sansa effectively disarmed LF by taking away his source of power over her: that he was her only protector and the one who could expose her secret. She "shot the hostage," essentially, by pulling the Sansa Stark trigger on her own terms to maintain control rather than waiting for someone to pull it for her.

Â 
I think the Vale Lords already knew who she was in the books. There's no way Waynwood would have gone along with the potential betrothal otherwise (plus her whole "gently bred" comment, Royce recognizing her, and Â Sansa blurting out "Jon Snow?!" in front of Myranda). So this was the TV's way of streamlining it.
Â 
I'm not sure either way about HTH being introduced in the show though. I have a feeling this union isn't going to come to pass in the books, but if it does, then it could be her E10 scene.

I know a lot of people think that, but I never did, really. Â HTH might be too much to introduce this season, but otherwise Â not sure how they will end her story, revealing a presumed future BF arrival would be giving too much away too soon I think. Â

Â 
Exactly. They could have stretched out her arc this season because there was enough material.Â Yet, they decided to skip all that and go rightÂ intoÂ it. Sansa might have a lot of materialÂ in both ADoS and TWoW. Maybe they don't want to crampÂ itÂ in the end with the other characters. Also,Â haven't D&D already planned Season 5?Â i remember reading something like that before season 4 started.
4462	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-02	Â 
in all honesty she doesn't look like she is subtly doing anything. very interesting but as i said in the discussion thread, it feels too quick. this should have happened a little later.


Completely agree. I like the direction they are going with Sansa, but I feel like it is being very rushed, especially her relationship with Baelish. This is just one of the pacing problems I feel the show has at this point.Â

Â 
I think they lay everything out about now, but in order to plan this season they had to be looking forward to season 5 anyway (which is why Dany's parked her butt in Mereen already). I'm sure they know where they're going with her. I'm just glad we're getting new content (I don't care which medium it's in).
Â 
Also, pretty good episode summary here:Â https://31.media.tum...6obgro1_500.gif
4464	Ranzadule	2014-06-02	LF saying she was his niece would be silly. These people would certainly want details and the story would easily be undone. Saying that her mom was one of his brothel employees makes these people not care and believe. Sansa playing her cards and making it look like she is doing LF a favor was cool.Â
4465	Grey Guardian	2014-06-02	I wasn't certain about whether her hair was black or if it was just the lighting, but after seeing this production still I can say with certainty that her hair is now definitely black. Makes me wonder why they didn't do it earlier, I assumed that they didn't do the Alayne transformation because Sophie Turner didn't want her hair dyed or something like that. I guess doing it now is to emphasise that Sansa is fully on Littlefinger's side now?

4466	ARYa_Nym	2014-06-02	Sansa, the black swan made me remember
Â 
Rogue prince spoiler:
Â 

	Spoiler The Lyseni became especially loathed, for they claimed more than coin from passing ships, taking off women, girls, and comely young boys to serve in their pleasure gardens and pillow houses. (Amongst those thus enslaved was Lady Johanna Swann, a fifteen-year-old niece of the Lord of Stonehelm. When her infamously niggardly uncle refused to pay the ransom, she was sold to a pillow house, where she rose to become the celebrated courtesan known as the Black Swan, and ruler of Lys in all but name. Alas, her tale, however fascinating, has no bearing upon our present history).


Â 


T4p for that. It made me think of Arya because of this line from ACoK:

Â 
Thirty yards from shore, three black swans were gliding over the water, so sereneâ<U+0080>¦Part of her wanted to be a swan. The other part wanted to eat one. 

Â 
Plus, in terms of Swan Lake she has a rival who is pretending to be her and is taking her place. Although Jeyne Poole would be more like the white swan Odette and Arya is more like Odile.
Â 
ETA: That excerpt also made me think of the KM offering her to go from lady to courtesan.
Â 
Anyways, on another site many said it looked more like the cheap looking outfits on that Once Upon A Time show.
Â 
Â 


My reaction to Sansa in this episode was

Â 
Probably because the show writersÂ rarely analyse the changes they make as deeply as you just did, and don't expect their "average" viewer to either.Â  Just like Arya and the Hound announcing themselves at the gate and no signs that they are being taken into custody.Â  Certainly one would expect that someone with connections to Varys would know about Sansa and Arya after this.

1) Better intro for the Lords needed, and Petyr should have been shown at least trying to coach Sansa (or gauge her likely reactions), and then failing to convince the Lords, and then Sansa saving the day. Â Basically, it felt like an establishing scene was missing.
Â 
2) In episode 4, Petyr flat out says what he wants ("Everything"), so it just seemed clumsy to rehash the dialog here, at least without Sansa clearly taking it to the next level.
Â 
3) Some sort of comment on (reason for) the new look would have been nice, other than just putting her in black like she's a new Sith Lord. Â Something about wanting to become a widow (since she had mentioned the forced marriage to Tyrion) or something.

Anyway, hoping that regardless of how, the last words she says to LF end up being, "Only Ned" (lol, "my father" for the show).

4481	ohpooratlas	2014-06-02	The show has not done nearly as good a job of highlighting the importance of forging alliances, not just with political marriages ... but with the use of fostering children. I really think the fact that Ned fostered with Lord Arryn and grew up with all the Lords who were children with him heavily factored into the reason the Vale Lords were so accepting of Sansa. It ties into Ramsay and Roose saying "so long as a Stark lives, the North will rally behind them." One of House Stark's biggest strengths is their ability to inspire loyalty.
Â 
Anyway, that production still of Sansa really cements my interpretation of her fully assuming the role of "Alayne Stone/Baelish."
Â 
The Vale Lords know who she is, but the rest of the Vale does not and if they are all going to tour the Vale holds with Robin Arryn, Sansa will not be able to get away with wearing a hood forever. The dress is black, for their mourning of Lysa Arryn. The material for the clothing is no where near as ornate as the silks and lace Sansa is used to wearing, because "Alayne" would not wear it. The feathers identify her as Baelish's niece, similar to the scale pattern you see in all of Dany's clothes, the lion embroidery on Cersei's dresses and the direwolf we used to see on Sansa's dresses.
Â 
I think the pendant she's wearing is what vamps up the dress. It accentuates the deep v line of her dress. Not to mention she's already fair skinned. Black clothing, black hair = vampy. But there you go.
Â 
I'm okay with this. I'm very excited going forward.
Â 
And again ... I've seen overwhelmingly positive comments from the unsullied about Sansa. I've also head a lot of "I retract my previous statements about Sansa Stark being stupid."
Â 
Frankly, it's about time.
4482	Sand11751	2014-06-02	I wasn't certain about whether her hair was black or if it was just the lighting, but after seeing this production still I can say with certainty that her hair is now definitely black.

I guess doing it now is to emphasise that Sansa is fully on Littlefinger's side now?


Â 
It makes sense that she changed her hair only after declaring who she was; anyone who had seen her at Winterfell would remember a redheaded Sansa Stark, not black-haired. I make no assumption that Sansa is on LF's side; she is, as she has always been, on her side. When I look at TV Sansa's arc, this girl will do and say what she needs to in order to get from point A to point B. Whether that's marriage to Joffrey and staying in King's Landing to now staying at LF's side. Those coy smiles aren't new; Sansa's been good at playing pretend for some time.
Â 


Â

Â 
Absolutely agree. I was watching with non-book readers who wanted to know "WTF's up with these three farts?" It's not a scene for pleasant introductions and explanations of why these people are questioning LF. So I had to pause the show and explain the lords of the Vale. As for them, they may be suspicious of LF, still wary of even Sansa's explanation of Lysa's trip out the moon door, but it's more plausible and palatable than all the thoughts running through their heads before she started speaking.

4483	ohpooratlas	2014-06-02	I'd be slightly concerned about Arya, less so about Sansa where Varys is concerned.
Â 
Then again, people could always write off the Hound claiming he has "Arya" as a way to get his ransom.
Â 
And maybe "rumors" turning up about girls claiming to be the Stark girls will move the "Jeyne Poole" storyline forward for the Boltons, but we know very well the Lannisters/Boltons aren't going to be hearing it from Varys.

Â 
Agreed, this is why I'm okay with it feeling slightly rushed/a bit over the top.
Â 
Also agreed with what you were saying about the dress. Plus, she knows that her sexual appeal is LF's weakness, so she made it in such a way that would play it up. That's why LF's look on his face is a little bit like "oh shit." He knows she has the upper hand. And it serves as a nice completion to the scene where she's sewing it. The look she gave him when he asked if she really knew what he wanted was like, "oh please, just wait," and then she turns her focus back to the dress.
4485	ohpooratlas	2014-06-02	And now we all know what that "new dress" Sophie was hinting at in an interview is.
Â 
Not to mention her new hair.

4486	ahighbornlady	2014-06-02	Â 
I think if she told them she was raped they'd believe her. They're already super suspicious of LF, and have no reason to trust him.Â 
Â 
We may have to disagree, but that episode showed me that Sansa can/does/will manipulate LF. Their power dynamic has completely shifted.


Â 
Yeah, I don't think LF will rape her. She knows he wants her and she'll use that to her advantage.
4487	Ser Not Appearing	2014-06-02	Â 
no it is really not that complicated. They rearranged things to make the season better, but some of the stuff they skipped over will be used now in a different way.
Â 
They will show her gaining Robin's trust.
Â 
They will show her piecing together LF's actions.
Â 
They will show her building relationships in the Vale.
Â 
Shuffling her story around a bit was about pacing the show in general IMO. This way her story could climax on it's own, and not be overshadowed by the battle at the Wall and other climactic events this season. I think it was smart.
Â 
The stuff they left out will be used now, and more engaging to watch because of all the intrigue and character transformation that surrounds it.I largely agree. Don't think this is a spoiler story so much as a replacement story. Instead of a girl who is learning passively and doesn't really make a move in the books, she has made a move and yet still has much to learn... and now she'll do it elsewhere in the show.
If the end product is a learned, ready to play the game Sansa who either loathes/distrusts LF or has been taken in by him, (depending on where the books go), this change won't matter to they overall story.
4488	John Dorian	2014-06-02	Since this has been a topic of...discussion, Sophie Turner was still 17 when she filmed this season.

4491	Raksha 2014	2014-06-02	Having said that, ages ago, I was reading GRRM's not a blog on livejournal and he was like "go watch Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby... Btw Baelish shares a few characteristics with Jay Gatsby, however the Littlefinger of the show is a whole other creature." so maybe GRRM regards Littlefinger as romantic in the same way that Jay Gatsby is romantic.
Even if Littlefinger comes across as a sociopathic, hyper intelligent version of an acid thrower to me, it is possible that this is not the author's intention. His weakness really could be 'love'.


Â 
I hope that GRRM meant that the characteristics that Baelish and Jay Gatsby shared were the strength and cunning to pull themselves up from nothing (a poor, socially low-status, background) to the top of the heap or close to it. Â Littlefinger hasn't been romantic since he was 15 and daring (foolishly) to fight Brandon Stark for Catelyn Tully's hand.Â 
Â 
I'm not sure that either show or book-Littlefinger is actually capable of love; he might be a sociopath. Â But Littlefinger does, I think, believe that he loved Cat and is now focussing that obsessive love onto her daughter with terrifying intensity; and men (and one woman) have already died for it. Â I do agree that Littlefinger's obsession with Cat and Sansa (because one bleeds into the other) is a major weakness and could ultimately destroy him, but I don't think it's love, at least as far as I understand love.

Yeah, I think we might still get it.
Â 
Hopefully they have LF taking control of the situation again. As much as I'd love to see Sansa steam roll everyone from here on out, people would probably grow to hate her if everything just ends up going her way. And LF has already been downplayed so much in the TV series.

4506	juanml82	2014-06-02	I found a striking resemblance between Alayne's dress andÂ this. I'd imagine that the Daedra had a hand in this somehow...


Daedric Armor? I don't personally don't see the resemblance, but that's me.
Â 
I've read some people claiming her change to the Dark Side was sudden, I think there was progression in her arc. Impeded, of course, by the second half of season 3 where she acted as if Hodor was warging her or something.
Â 
We have snippets of Darth Sansa all the way back to season 1, when she almost throws Joffrey off the battlements (sorry Tyrion, Sansa had it in her to be a murder for years. Gee... husbands who think they know their wives ). Then she tries to goad Joffrey into dying at the Blackwater (fails, but what can she do to ensure the outcome?) and tells Tyrion she's praying for his death. While we can't tell for sure, we know she prays for Robb's victory in season 3, and that should include assorted heads on assorted pikes. Finally, her smile at LF's question about those who hurt they ones they love should really make it clear that Arya isn't the only Stark with a list and that Sansa likes the idea of killing them all.
Â 
As for "Sansa can't lie", it has its roots during Season 2, when her lies can not be believed nor they are meant to: Really, Joffrey had you publicly beaten and stripped and you love him and don't want the betrothal to end? Nobody is supposed to buy that.
By the start of Season 3, she recognizes her father got killed because of telling the truth and, while she still tells the truth to Olenna and Margery, her assessment of the world she lives in is already better than her father's. Granted, that doesn't mean much.
Now, this doesn't mean Sansa is a good liar. She lies to LF in Season 3, when she tells him that she doesn't want to be rescued out of fear for his safety. LF doesn't buy it - there isn't a truth at the core of the lie and they both know they aren't friends - but Sansa could have gotten away with it if Loras kept his mouth shut. Of course, then we move into sheep shift territory and there isn't any more opportunities for Sansa to hone her lying skills.
Â 
She doesn't lie through the PW, there is no reason for that. Finally, she's confronted by Lysa at the scene when Lysa squeezes her hand:
"Why did he rescue you" - Sansa knows by now that he did it because he wants to bang her until the day Cersei becomes a competent ruler, but she can't say it. She tries to come up with something on the fly "I'm half Tully, she loved my mother..." wrong buttons to press, but the issue is not the quality of the lie. And then we have:
"He loves you" True as far as Sansa knows
"He says I'm a stupid little girl" Lie. LF never told her that. I actually think none in the show was ever rude enough to tell her that
"Who believes in songs" Distorted truth. Years ago LF told her that life isn't a song and the moment of realization would hurt her. That doesn't mean he said it during the present
"Who can not lie" Distorted truth. LF told her everyone was a better liar than her... back in Season 2, when her lies couldn't possibly be believed.
"And should always tell the truth and that's what I'm saying" Lie. LF never told her she should always tell the truth.
Â 
Â 
So I think it's all there. The scene in her bedroom even combines the teachings of at least three different mentors:
She redesigns a new outfit to work as a symbol of her new position, as Septa Mordane taught her
She recognizes another person's goals so she can manipulate him, as Littlefinger taught her
She uses her womanhood (I don't mean specifically her genitals) as a tool, as Cersei taught her
(Hopefully, she didn't make use of Margery lesson about how man who have plenty of sex with whores are better lovers than Loras)
4507	King Endymion Targaryen	2014-06-02	Was it just me or did Sansa look like Maleficent?


The first time I saw her I thought of it!She was exactly the same!Â 
Besides that I don't think she believes LF is her friend cause she knows he killed Joffrey and accused Tyrion.

Â 
We see LF slipping at the end of AFFC, but it's obvious the show is going to whip through that content (and barely touch it), so they needed to show him slipping earlier. And have this Sansa moment earlier.


Can anyone please tell me what kind of slips everyone seems to have in mind save for me?

4516	Petyr Patter	2014-06-02	I think the new dress might be as simple as "rule of cool."
If this was suppose to be Sansa's transformation into a player... it was a colossal failure.Â  The show presented a situation where Littlefinger is in a bind and guilty of a terrible crime.Â  The people judging Baelish are highly suspicious.Â  If Sansa tells the truth, that Baelish murdered Lysa... he is a goner.Â 
There is NO rational reason for Sansa to keep Baelish around.Â  Maybe the show will make a case later for keeping alive and in power, but somehow I really doubt it.Â  Baelish is very dangerous.Â  He framed her and Tyrion for regicide.Â  He murdered Dontos and Lysa right in front of her.Â  While Sansa might not realize it, he betrayed her father and delivered him to the Lannisters.Â  She does know he secured the alliance that saved King's Landing from Stannis.Â  While the politics are not straightforward, helping the Lannisters is hurting Robb and Catelyn and it ended with their deaths.
In the books, Sansa works with Baelish because she is wanted for regicide and is sheltering her.Â  So, to play along with his lies makes some measure of sense.Â  However, once she revealed herself as Sansa Stark, that motivation is gone.Â  The Vale Lords will either protect her, or they won't.Â  Eitherway, Baelish is redundant.Â 
So, if Sansa can't do the very sensible thing and get Baelish killed... how is she a player?Â  Looks awfully like a dupe to me.
We are asked to believe that Sansa thinks she can control him.Â  Really?Â  The show has repeatedly told us how dangerous Littlefinger is, and how he thrives on chaos.Â  If nothing else, if he can't extradite himself from the situation he created by killing Lysa, is he really worth trying to side with now?Â  What exactly does Sansa have over Baelish?
Sex?Â  That is what Cersei taught.Â  Think about that.Â  Do we want a Sansa who takes lessons from the most evil woman in Westeros, or one who while willing to bend the rules remembers she is daughter of Eddard Stark? If the heroes must become villains to "win," that isn't winning.Â 
Also, George Martin showed exactly what using sex as a tool gets you when Cersei offers herself to a Kettleblack in exchange for killing one High Septon and lying about Maragery to the second.Â  A patsy who will turn on you.Â  Cersei is now a prisoner of the Faith and was shamed in front of all of King's Landing.Â  Sex is not a weapon.Â  It can be something you sell.Â  It might get weak men very loyal to you, but as we read of Tytos Lannister's mistress, everyone else will get jealous and spiteful.Â  Sansa will never become Baelish's partner if the only thing she offers is the possibility (or reality) that she will become his whore.
A much better answer to the bedroom question when Littlefinger asks what "he wants" was "power."Â  Think about it.Â  Even if it isn't the entirely correct answer, it would have established clear parameters for their relationship going forward.Â  She knows he wants advancement (and he does), and suggests she will help him get it.Â  She is NOT offering love, sex, or affection.Â  However, this would just make Baelish desire her all the more, seeing not only Catelyn's beauty in her, but a mind like his own.Â  Yet, he can't have her... which once again just make him want her more.
I wonder if the show runners actually thought in terms of "agency" when writing this scene.Â  Yet, what is the point of agency when one uses it against one's own self interest?Â  Still, I do see one way they can make sense of this episode's Sansa's scenes, which I posted about earlier, http://asoiaf.wester...-9#entry5852404 .Â  Simply put, if Baelish is dead by the end of the season.Â
4517	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	Anya Waynwood - She is a distant relative to the Starks.


Ooooh shit, i forgot she was related to the Starks! This explains her warmth with Sansa after the reveal. Cuz if Sansa won anyone over, its Lady Waynwood.
Â 


/@Bran's legs
You're forgetting that Margaery has also had a part in Sansa's development in the show, if not in the books.


Yes. While the development feels really rapid, the costume change and her sudden burst of manipulative ability is a culmination of things. (im going to go by the show here cuz in the books, it was difficult to say whether or not Sansa paid that kind of attention. She likely did but didnt acknowledge it in an obvious manner. Anyway..)Â 
Cersei's "worldly wisdom" on the ways of being a lady in power. Sansa originally wanted to be like Cersei, the good queen. But she found out Cersei is a villain and horrible. She didnt want to be like Cersei. However, Sansa acknowledges Cersei's point about weaponizing her womanness. Sansa also comes to the conclusion that "I will make them love me."Â 
Â 
The Hound. His showing Sansa that knighthood is not as noble as it seems helped her see that things are never what they seem. "Save yourself the trouble and tell them what they want to hear."Â 
Â 
Margaery. Sansa idolized Marg. Marg was the figure she could look up to and see as an older sister. Margaery had her own brand of wisdom and showed how to make people have high opinions of someone. Have the guise of compassion but also be guarded. Marg would also tell not-truths a lot. Part of Sansa's Alayne costume is modeled a bit after Marg's more bold outfits. Sansa also learned that Marg cannot ultimately be trusted...
Â 
Tyrion. In the show, Sansa watches Tyrion. While her feelings are that of disgust and anguish at being married to him, she observes his movements. Shes close enough to him in that respect that she can silently pick out how Tyrion operates. Shes not in entire agreement with that either since Tyrion lost so much control over his own situation. So she picked up on how to not lose too much control over her own situation. Tyrion has a silver tongue but also it gets him into trouble. Sansa is aware....
Â 
Even Shae had a hand in Sansa's development. Shae attempts to clue Sansa in on LF's intentions. Sansa ultimately dismissed this, but she didnt ignore this piece of advice. Shae was right, but she wasnt right about LF's full intent. Hanging in the back of Sansa's mind while on that ship to the Vale, was Shae's weedy voice going "All men want one thing."Â 
Â 
Finally, Littlefinger himself. "Everyone here is a liar and all of them, better than you." This line resonates with her so strongly, sheÂ uses it in a weaponized form. "Im just a stupid little girl with stupid ideas and stupid dreams!" This lowered Marg's guard initially and also lowered Lysa's roiling rage later on. She is using this weapon and pointing it at the Vale Lords by telling them the not-truth. "I really didnt quite understand...I had no friends in King's Landing. My aunt was a jealous woman...she was accusing me of things...i didnt quite understand why...And then she threw herself out the Moon Door.." But that weapon is now loaded with ALL OF THAT OTHER AMMO she picked up on.Â 
Â 
....I will make them love me.....
Â 
"Who do we rally for then? Robb Stark is dead."Â 
Â 
...I will make them love me....
Â 
"I know what you want."Â 
"Do you really?"
Â 
Sansa looks at LF with a pointed and meaningful look.Â 
Â 
...I willÂ make them love me....
Â 
Shes good. This is only the prelude to what i often theorize will be her Kung Fu Movie Moment. And itsÂ awesome.

Â 
actually women have used sex as a tool for centuries and continue to do so. and while it isn't as detailed, sansa is answering the question of what he wants from her which is perfectly in line with his teaching her to find out what someone wants as a means of determining their area of weakness. frankly, the books have been setting up sansa as littlefinger's weakness from the very beginning and that weakness definitely does not occur because he sees her as his partner.

Â 

Â 

Maybe. But she thinks she knows Baelish weakness (and she might be right), while she knows little to nothing about Lord Royce, Lady Waynwood and Lord Filler. On top, LF offered her everything a young Westerosi orphan can desire in life. And by that I mean murder. Royce and Waynwood haven't yet offered anything.

Â 

Yes to the bolded part. She remembers she's the daughter of Eddard Stark. She also remembers Eddard Stark got killed for acting like Eddard Stark.
And I'd say that if the White Walkers are contained plus the Boltons, Freys and remaining guilty Lannisters are sacrificed to the Old Gods, well, it counts as winning in my book. Heroes are turning into villains in this series.

The main issue I have with that is that the plan still hinges completely on the Royce, Waynwood and Corbray being all "woo, Team Stark!".Â  If they aren't, the whole thing goes south pretty quickly.

Â 
Well they aren't behind the "damn Lannisters" and when questioning Petyr on who to support their first (only) option was Robb Stark, even though the Vale was also recent friends to the Baratheons.
Â 
They also looked a bit abashed when reminded of Catelyn's plea for help that Lysa denied
Â 
I'm also conscious of Myranda's less than sincere comment to Sansa about Lysa being the soul of wisdom (non-verbatim) when Sansa discussed Lysa keeping the Vale out of the War of 5 Kings though that's a book conversation that probably won't occur in the show.

4523	Lady Sansa Stark	2014-06-02	I was always sure that Sansa would make it to the end. However, after this episode, I am not so sure anymore. I mean, yes, Littlefinger wants Sansa, but he is not stupid. I have the feeling that she vastly underestimates Littlefinger and his possibilities, and "what he wants". She doesn't really know what he wants. Having Sansa is not his total endgame, I just cannot believe that. That scene when she walks off the stairs, all being badass in black, and seeing how Littlefinger was watching her, that smile she gave him, that look in her eye like "I know what you want, so here it is" just had me thinking about what will happen next. I have the feeling that this won't end as well as I thought before.Â

Â 
of course it's not his endgame. it's not even his endgame for sansa! but it is what he wants from her and she will be able to manipulate him because of this desire for her much more than she will because of his desire for power or to gain winterfell, both of which he also wants. it is his desire for her that she can directly and immediately manipulate.Â

you hope. frankly, i think she'll hit a moral horizon suitable for her and her arc before rebounding, just as we've seen with other characters. so no, i don't think she'll be all stark all the time. bran hasn't been, arya hasn't been and jon hasn't been. i don't see why sansa will be different.

his moral horizon is warging hodor which is all about his desires, not a stark motive. especially since he knows how much it disturbs and frightens hodor when he does it.Â

Â 
To nitpick the logic here, Sansa sticks with Littlefinger because he's the devil she knows; okay, that's the same as the book.Â  But the revised version of the plan hinges completely on Royce and co. being all "woo, Team Stark!", so how is that any less reliant on others?


It does rely on that, unless they are going to bring other elements of the Sansa/Little Finger story forwards, as yet unseen in the books...

That scene when she walks off the stairs, all being badass in black, and seeing how Littlefinger was watching her, that smile she gave him, that look in her eye like "I know what you want, so here it is" just had me thinking about what will happen next. I have the feeling that this won't end as well as I thought before.Â 


I sort of think the opposite. Sansa is shaping into a grey, or outright evil, character. So if she dies because of it, her death would look like moralism. Kind of how in Disney type of movies, a bad guy may atone for his sins, but still die nonetheless.
And since I think this is going in the opposite way, I'm more inclined to think that she'll survive.
Â 


Â 
his moral horizon is warging hodor so which is all about his desires, not a stark motive. especially since he knows how much it disturbs and frightens hodor when he does it.Â 


Plus casual cannibalism to survive starvation

Â 
Didn't they all (Stark kids) lost their Stark motives nd went "native" with whatever group they were hanging out with? So I dont see why Sansa wouldn't do the same and in the long run fight for herself not for House Stark. Getting revenge for the destruction of her house might be a goal but not he main one in the end.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Maybe it will go south pretty quickly - won't that be fun?!!!


Â 
It might not go that much south because Royce, Waynwood and Cobray were manipulated even worse than LF was. Even if does go south she still gains something from it. If those three manage to see through her deception Sansa's safe because she's an asset and also the key to the North as Robb Stark's. But, in the same time, if the whole plan blows up in their faces, Lf's pretty much done ... he's getting a first class ticket on Moon Door Airways and she still manages to eliminate one of her father's betrayers.

Â 
it does look like they are immersing themselves in their "lessons" and will probably continue to do so in book 6 but i suspect they will rebound back to the stark moral center a bit by the end of the series. not completely, but a bit. they will always be ned and cat's kid's but stronger, better, smarter, more ruthless, etc. than their parents ever were as a result of their mentors teachings which will advance house stark far more than ned or cat could have ever dreamed.
4534	Facebookless Man	2014-06-02	Of course it goes south.
The idea that Sansa would suddenly get off her ass, make all the right moves, and become a powerful and influent player without ever failing or compromising her supposedly pristine morality... that was dumb long before this episode aired.

4535	shadowfire	2014-06-02	I'm not sure backing him against the Vale Lords is particularly smart. She knows he is a dangerous guy and after the kissing/elimination of Lysa it is at least likely that hisromantic advances could escalate. But again she does not know anything about the Vale Lords - they will not necessarily protect her against Lannisters or LF or may even sell her out. It was a big risk for her to take to reveal her identity to strangers - I don't think she would have done it unless a) she thought it would procure more support for war against the crown in the Vale (unlikely as they are loyal to Robin, not Starks. But I can see how LF would be useful to gather support) orÂ it would give her some protection against LF's advances (also strange considering she could have eliminated them/him altogether, though obviously she would be more protected by the Lords as a Stark than as some bastard daughter/niece of a Lord the nobles do not like). Again neither one of these possibilities seems compelling enough to trust her identity to strangers she barely knows, risking assassination, betrayal from them or anyone they happen to tell. It's a rational decision but hardly a power play.Â 
Â 
Again, I don't get how stoking his lust is a good move. The first time she asks him what he wants on the boat, it seemed like he was already creeping on her (rubbing her arm with a pregnant pause?). Later Lysa is hysterically jealous of her and she lies to her about what he told her. When she asks him a second time what he really wanted/why he killed Joffrey, it seems almost like she is trying to force his hand. The way its been filmed there is no way she is unaware at this point that he is attracted to her. Her forcing the question again seems to deliberately push it out in the open and obviously it works because he kisses her.
Â 
Her statement that she knows what he wants (could be a grab for the throne, but is likely herself as well) will also force him to be more bold. The sexy dress and cocky attitude will have the same effect. If she is gambling here - trying to make him desire her so that he will not hurt her and do what she wants while simultaneously avoiding sexual advance from him - it makes little sense to me because he already wants her as a second Cat and is risked a lot to smuggle her and killed Lysa. Her confronting his lust and vamping it up for him makes her more vulnerable IMO.

actually women have used sex as a tool for centuries and continue to do so. and while it isn't as detailed, sansa is answering the question of what he wants from her which is perfectly in line with his teaching her to find out what someone wants as a means of determining their area of weakness. frankly, the books have been setting up sansa as littlefinger's weakness from the very beginning and that weakness definitely does not occur because he sees her as his partner.


Â 
True but will she use sex like Cersei?Â  Giving it up completely? Or Margaery?Â  Dangling the forbidden fruit in front of her target to get what she wants? There's a difference.Â  I would think Sansa's situation is more aligned with Margaery.Â  A young girl being used as a pawn and whose value is weighed by her inheritance and maidenhead.Â  Cersei's situation and stage in life, although again being forced into marriage, is vastly different, requiring different strategy.Â

I think these are all valid points. A thought, however. On your statement that Sansa is "trying to make him [LF] desire her so that he will not hurt her and do what she wants while simultaneously avoiding sexual advance from him". Are you sure that's what she's doing? There might not be that much "avoiding" going on here - she might have decided that this is the way to make her move. Though yes, a very dangerous game, and she'll have to be very careful how she plays it.

Â 
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?! Various commenters further up the thread are talking about this being a WoW spoiler. In a way that's correct (if this is indeed a view of things that have not yet been revealed in the books, but will be), but I'm not sure that that is the right way to view it. The way I see it, both formats are authentic sources of ASOIAF/GoT lore - nothing is changed in the tv shows that seriously effects the main arc of the story - so we are now simply at a point where the tv show can tell us things that we have not yet learnt from the books. No longer is it a case of those of us who have read the books smartly knowing everything that will happen in the show. It's not a spoiler, it's just that we are now in a situation where we can all be surprised, and learn a bit more about the world of ice and fire, whatever format we are enjoying. How awesome is that?
Â 
Ah, and given that this is a Sansa thread - this has never happened to me before, but I think I might actually have fallen in love with a character of a tv programme. The new "vixen" Sansa - OMG - a lump in my throat.

Â 
Truth. She could be trying to get him to make a move on her. But this is also not a good move, at least not now. She could kill him while his guard is down (i.e. when he makes his move on her): this would be easier to explain (especially considering how well her waterworks worked on the Vale Lords before) and rationalize to herself, as she would not be directly proactive (such as poisoning him). On the other hand it will be unpredictably timed because a lot depends on his actions - no guarantee that her plan would work and she would lose her virginity. I think if she wanted to make a move and vamp it up she should wait until he consolidates the Vale/Riverlands behind her, marries her to Robin. Its too soon to start seducing before she has a backup plan, particularly as he seems very receptive already.
Â 
BTWÂ I don't think she wants him - she knows he murdered twice and uses people pretty cruelly, I just don't see it b/c she is a romantic at heart, but you never know he might appear sympathetic later and she breaks.
4546	Lee-Sensei	2014-06-02	I think its an issue that Sansa revealed herself to the Vale Lords. Here they're pro Team Stark (even putting Robb over their own Lord and completely ignoring the Baratheon option). Why shouldn't she trust them?
4547	Gogossos	2014-06-02	I honestly don't think we're in uncharted TWOW territory. Except for one thing, Sansa doesn't do anything that she didn't do in AFFC. That one thing is coming out explicitly to Lords Royce and Corbray and Lady Waynwood. Her alias is still intact, hence the hair and dress. She didn't dye her hair until now because she was stuck in the Eyrie.
Â 
LF's little tale about Lysa's demise wouldn't have fooled those guys; LF's tale with Alayne's corroboration would have fared only slightly better. It is Sansa Stark's name and presence that seals the deal. Basically, the prime Vale Lords discover they have bigger fish to fry than Lysa's death, something they will revisit some other day. But for now they have to wonder how to deal with Sansa's presence in their midst. I think that was the same dynamic in the books too, the elaborate lie that Sansa participated in only got accepted pretty much because Sansa was telling it. I think D&D made a smart change, they let Sansa accept that the ruse will not fool anyone and let her deliberately leverage her own name. That's why I think we are still in AFFC with Sansa, her TWOW material will be explored next season. In this episode, it was stated that Robin is sickly - so they will need time to establish that.Â 
Â 
Sansa is now explicitly doing what she subtly does (or is trying to do) in the books. I don't think we sped/skipped forward that much.

I can't disagree w/GRRM interpretation of his own character, but LF as Jay Gatsby? WTF. Â LF is a destructive, malevolent asshole who kills people to get ahead. Â Jay Gatsby was a bootlegger.

A Gatsby Parallel
I might have known you liked Great Gatsby, George. It's a masterful book, a soulgaze into both the American psyche and the soul of a romantic that came so close to achieving what he wanted, yet could never quite reach it. And your review didn't disappoint; looks like I'll have to see that movie now.
It makes me wonder whether you included a parallel character to Gatsby in your seminal work, as you have with Shylock and the Three Stooges.
I might be reaching, but I think I might have found one: Petyr Baelish. He's a man who stops at nothing to chase after the memory of the woman he loves, even if he has to use the enterprises of the underworld to get there. He's a much more ruthless character, more sinister and slimy, yet his goal seems the same. Perhaps Baelish has lost sight of that obsession in search of power, but I hold on hope that the remnants of that pure passion lies somewhere underneath. It would almost make me root for him, if that were the case.

Re: A Gatsby Parallel
Yes, there's a lot of Gatsby in Littlefinger. Book Littlefinger, anyway. TV Littlefinger is a different sort of creature.
4551	Uldra I	2014-06-02	Know this has all been said in this thread already, but just want to throw in my two cents
Â 
The transformation of Sansa all in this one episode was shocking and IMHO unbelievable.Â  Others rightly point out that she has been learning the game since leaving WF, but only last episode, Sansa was still the little girl, building her snow castle, her childish (although justified) outburst at SweetRobin about the castle, and her shock and confusion over Petyr's kiss.Â  Now suddenly she has been transformed from the meek, obedient, girl to ?femme fatale?.Â  Huh?Â Â  Talk about character whiplash.Â 
Â 
At LF's hearing, I believe Sophie delivered the best acting she's done on the show in her lies to the Lords Declarant.Â  She already knew that the Lords would be sympathetic to a Stark because of overhearing an earlier conversation between them and LF.Â  So, her move to reveal her identity was brilliant.Â  Now she will not be forced to live under LF's thumb.Â  She will find protection from the Lannisters and from LF (if need be) from The Vale.Â  The Vale will most likely help her win back WF from the Bolton/Frey/Stannis people, with or without her having to marry SweetRobin or Harry the Heir.Â 
Â 
When she is being consoled by the Lady Declarant and reassured she'd be safe now, the look she gives Petyr didn't look like desire to me.Â  It seemed she was saying, "See I can play the game too, now."Â  I sensed a bit of forewarning toward him, letting him know she will not be his pawn.Â  Petyr's look seemed to beam pride back at her that she is learning the game so well.Â 
Â 
Finally,Â  THAT DRESS!Â Â  Â Â  Know there's been lots of speculation about it's symbolic meaning... but that was no 'girls' dress for sure.Â  The only thing I'd like to add about it is that I don't think it is meant for Petyr's enjoyment, but more as her statement that she is no longer going to be treated like a child with no control over her own life.Â 
Â 
It'd be wonderful if show people will clarify their intent a little bit.Â  ETA:Â  unlike others on this thread I don't yet get the sense that she necessarily has some grand scheme up her dress.Â  I think that will grow from her new found self-confidence.Â  But definitely not with LF up her dress.Â  If he ends up there (and I think he will)Â it won't be of her choosing.

					
					
							Edited by Uldra, 02 June 2014 - 09:13 PM.
4552	Raksha 2014	2014-06-02	I hope that GRRM is referring to Gatsby and Littlefinger's both being men of low social standing and poor backgrounds who levered themselves up to the highest echelons by their wits and ruthlessness. Â I never saw Gatsby as a sociopath; and Littlefinger seems very close to one if not the real thing.Â
4553	jarl the climber	2014-06-02	Completely agree. I like the direction they are going with Sansa, but I feel like it is being very rushed, especially her relationship with Baelish. This is just one of the pacing problems I feel the show has at this point.Â 


Â 


I don't mind the plot changes, but the writing was a bit weak.
Â 
1) Better intro for the Lords needed, and Petyr should have been shown at least trying to coach Sansa (or gauge her likely reactions), and then failing to convince the Lords, and then Sansa saving the day. Â Basically, it felt like an establishing scene was missing.
Â 
2) In episode 4, Petyr flat out says what he wants ("Everything"), so it just seemed clumsy to rehash the dialog here, at least without Sansa clearly taking it to the next level.
Â 
3) Some sort of comment on (reason for) the new look would have been nice, other than just putting her in black like she's a new Sith Lord. Â Something about wanting to become a widow (since she had mentioned the forced marriage to Tyrion) or something.
Â 
Anyway, hoping that regardless of how, the last words she says to LF end up being, "Only Ned" (lol, "my father" for the show).


Adressing 3, I thought she was wearing the dark dress because she was in mourning for Lysa Arryn. While I think the dress did serve a symbolic purpose, it represents her deception in covering up the truth about her Aunts death among other things, there is a practical reason for her to be wearing a black dress, she is nominally Petyrs niece and ward and Lysa was his wife.Â
4554	jarl the climber	2014-06-02	Oh, I was curious, does anyone else think that its starting to be implied that Robin is Petyrs son, at least in the show universe?
4555	Jon-Michael Pearson	2014-06-02	I am not sure why people think the show as jumped the books there is so much that as not happened, at least two more seasons.
Â 
We need the whole Dorne storyline in Dorne, Quenten Matell journey to find Daenrys, Aryra whole story in Bravos, Aegon story, Davos story with Manderly, there is so much in ADWD.Â  There is also hte whole Tully stroyline and the best character in the whole book Black Fish
4556	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	Â 
About the "trial": was anyone else reminded of the Lannisters dragging Sansa from her bed to give evidence way back in season 1? I haven't seen it some time, but the way they urged her on etc. really reminded me of that scene.

"You have nothing to fear from us, child."Â 
Yes. This was a very deliberate call back both in-universe and out. Sansa knows this, its written on her face. "I was here before. Only those people were different and my father was standing there. Lady...I had to sayÂ something. So i told them i couldnt remember. Arya...She called me a liar. Lysa....she tried to kill me. Lord Baelish...you will see. Not everyone is a better liar than me." I thought that scene was really great for that reason.Â

Â Add to it all her lies about her father and how she had to appease Cersei & co. at her father's trial with lies, and halftruths... Now she uses honesty, and wins it!
Great Catch!Â

4558	hallam	2014-06-02	It sort of changes the dynamic of what the role of Alayne means for Sansa. This portrays it as just her playing a part and everyone who matters already knows who she really is. It seems she cannot ever assume the persona as deeply as she did in the books. Perhaps the ability to assume the role of Alayne with great depth is irrelevant to her progression in the book.Â 


I think they are skipping the Alayne part and good riddance.
Â 
Novels and TV have different requirements. A novel can have a minor character in every scene without ever giving them a proper role. A TV series can't have a character on the set every day for four seasons without giving them a proper role.Â 
Â 
Sansa is obviously going to be more important in book 6 onwards. GRRM has killed off everyone else. But Sophie Turner can't wait for a whole new season just to get a character the viewers don't hate.
Â 
It makes sense to make more of Sansa in any case. Because without Sansa, no more Baelish. And now he's out of KL, no more Varys to spar with, no more small council.
Â 
But I think there is another part to it and that is that Baelish is very similar to Cersei in that he spends a lot of time scheming but it does not get him as far as he imagines. Baelish is the nominal lord of Harrenhal but hasn't set foot there.
Â 
I have the feeling that Baelish is going to end up poisoned or otherwise disposed of by Sansa.

Yes. This was a very deliberate call back both in-universe and out. Sansa knows this, its written on her face. "I was here before. Only those people were different and my father was standing there. Lady...I had to sayÂ something. So i told them i couldnt remember. Arya...She called me a liar. Lysa....she tried to kill me. Lord Baelish...you will see. Not everyone is a better liar than me." I thought that scene was really great for that reason.Â 
Â 
Â 
Whoa there, cowboy. Where did you get that impression?


Well, I have a friend who watches the show who has not read the books and that was his guess. His reasoning was that they had been having an affair on and off for quite some time, that Robin and Petyr seem fond of each other, that he killed Lysa to protect Robin as well as Sansa and that his endgame is to secure the Vale for his son. He was just wondering if he was barking up the wrong tree and I told him that some people who read the books think its possible. I don't really subscribe to this at this point but it does make some sense.

well there was a moment when LF was telling Sweet Robin that he could grow up despite being sickly... that I thought he was about to say "I was a sickly little boy, and look at me now"
4561	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-02	Â Add to it all her lies about her father and how she had to appease Cersei & co. at her father's trial with lies, and halftruths... Now she uses honesty, and wins it!
Great Catch!Â  


Â 
 Yeap. Her honesty is peppered with halftruths and its really interesting.

Well, i know in the book forums, theres a theory about that. I was just wondering how the show was hinting at it. (while not the worst out there in terms of theories, im just not a fan) Â I dunno..thats kind of i dunno. #ambivalent
4562	Rapsie	2014-06-02	I suspect the talk D&D had with GRRM earlier last year may have made them realize they have to hurry up with her character development which has been largely ignored and muddled in season 3. Also she may have a lot of material in TWOW and ADOS, or D&D have a lot of "cool" filler they have dreamed up. 
Also D&D are not good at subtle characterization, so they have Sansa turn in one episode. In fact they should have had her singing "Let it Go" while she was sewing her new dress.
4563	We Pay Our Debts	2014-06-02	I'm not going to read the entire thread (fun as it might be), but man, did they change absolutely everything now!
Â 
They didn't just streamline Feast, they fucking skipped it and jumped right at WoW instead!
Â 
Robin is going, LF is practically declaring war against the Iron Throne, Sansa is Maleficent...I mean, just give us Harry the Heir in the next episode and be done with it!


Â 
Yet Ygritte and Balon Greyjoy are still alive.
4564	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-06-02	Phew! Man. I go eat some Salmon and come back to 12 more pages. Ok, so, now that I'm caught up...


Â 
Let me throw out a question.Â  Does anyone else suspect Littlefinger is going to be dead by the end of the season?
Â 
Â Maybe that death is coming sooner than we think.


Â 
You know, that thought occurred to me this morning; that perhaps Petyr dies in episode 10. And while I think that's entirely possible, I don't think its plausible. I think he'll still serve some sort of purpose to her storyline even if it is ultimately to make her a killer (meaning, she kills him). I do agree though, that his death will probably come sooner rather than later,
Â 


Well, I have to say that they kinda killed book!Sansa in the show here, but booooooy how I loved this episode. I've separated book from show some time ago, so I don't really mind what they did in this episode. Sansa is becoming a player, and a lot faster than we think. I honestly haven't seen any negative comment about Sansa with regards to this episode (not on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr etc.) which makes me more happy than it should.Â 


Â 
We must follow very different people on Tumblr. A couple of people I follow are having kittens. Granted, I think it has a lot to do with the utter disapproval of the potential Sansa/Petyr 'seduction' storyline, but I also think it has a lot to do with upholding some sort of innocent/virginal/angelic/ideal Sansa that they've built up in their minds. And while I understand the desire to keep her "good" (because I desperately want that myself), I'm not of the opinion that these changes make her "bad". On the contrary, I think it gives her control over the events of her life and whether she sinks or swims, at least she'll have died trying. See, I've heard a lot of reasons as to why people don't like Sansa but the most consistent complaint has always been her lack of....'fight'. She's passive. The perpetual 'damsel in distress'. This change of character/personality has really served to kind of put those complaints to bed and more importantly, it has given both breath and depth to the argument that a lot of Sansa fans--and even Sophie Turner herself--have made; that a person can be 'badass' and have power without ever needing to wield a sword. Â  Â 
Â 

But for the rest of this season, Sansa's storyline will be pure plot development and no more major drama.


Â 
I don't know. I'm taking a wait and see approach. Ok. So, now that we all know that Sophie wasn't 'trolling' in all of her interviews/comments regarding this season....there's something she's said that makes me think we might yet get something big in episode 10. In a recent interview Sophie said something about the finale being huge and "hopeful". That word sticks out to me the way her saying "seduction" stuck out to me previously. "Hopeful"? What's there to be hopeful about? So! As is my wont, let me launch into my first bought of speculation. I think the finale will have a vision. One of Bran's visions. And that vision will give us a glimpse into some of the 'endgame' scenarios for "The Children" (i.e. The Stark kids, Tyrion/Jamie/Cersei, the Dragon, etc). Also, Sophie has said that she's a "Dark Horse". I'm not sure if that means something different in the UK, but over here, I associate that term with an underdog in either sports or politics seemingly "coming out of nowhere" and winning the whole damn thing. So.....maybe.....a Bran vision of Sansa on the Throne (or in some sort of position of power)? I'm leaning towards this speculation.Â 


...theres a reason they fast forwarded her. We'll find out next season.


Â 
Indeed we will. And I'm cautiously optimistic about it. 

Â 


Their power dynamic has completely shifted.


Â 
And that is the greatest thing in the world to me. Â  I mean, it gives Sansa the upper-hand (which is something she has never had throughout the whole series) and it finally makes the story about HER. This is HER storyline now. It's not Petyr's, it's not King's Landing, it's not anyone else's. Its hers. And that the majority of people are COMPLETELY into and riveted by it (finally) gives me a sense of vindication, you know what I mean? Like...yeah...she's amazing. She's always been. I'm glad you guys are finally catching on and seeing it.
Â 


I've read the books but one thing I never could understand is who Alayne is supposed to be, is she going to be Petyr's protege? Please tell me that Sansa is not going to be another Cersei... I can't bare it, I love Sansa, but seeing her in all black and lying just made me sad ...


Â 
This right now is probably my biggest 'secret' fear. That she'll end up becoming another Cersei. As of right now though, I'm convincing myself that it's, "possible, but not probable".
Â 


On the plus side, the power balance shift means no LF foisting kisses and such on Sansa. No daddy/daughter roleplaying, either. Less child molesting is always a good thing.
Sansa revealing herself to the Vale lords was a neat bit of insurance. If LF acts up or something happens to him, she can go crying to the lords for protection, and if the Vale lords act up or try to sell her out, she can fall back on LF.
Also, Sansa effectively disarmed LF by taking away his source of power over her: that he was her only protector and the one who could expose her secret. She "shot the hostage," essentially, by pulling the Sansa Stark trigger on her own terms to maintain control rather than waiting for someone to pull it for her.


Â 
Have I ever described my secret love and affection for you? Because it's there. Ohhhhhhh, it's there. Â  THIS (your post). All of THIS.Â  Â
4565	We Pay Our Debts	2014-06-02	I might be in the minority, but I hated the portrayal of Sansa in this episode. She completely changed into a different character in the snap of a fingers. And she looks like freaking Maleficient, when she's supposed to blend in the background. I'm not surprised. D&D have no idea what the definition of subtlety is.
Â 
And having Sansa reveal her identity was stupid as fuck. Ugh. And she only dyes her hair now? That makes no sense. Nothing in this show makes no sense.

Adressing 3, I thought she was wearing the dark dress because she was in mourning for Lysa Arryn. While I think the dress did serve a symbolic purpose, it represents her deception in covering up the truth about her Aunts death among other things, there is a practical reason for her to be wearing a black dress, she is nominally Petyrs niece and ward and Lysa was his wife.Â 


That's possible, but based on the comments I've seen, nobody really knows, so it seems to me like something was missing from the scene. Â There were three separate scenes at the Eyrie, and that was the conclusion of the last one, so I think it's a valid complaint if nobody really knows what it was supposed to mean.

Â 
You're absolutely right. 100%. Someone once said that if Sansa was going to make it to the end, she was going to have to engage in some questionable things. And that's true. Hell, I think that's true for EVERY character, not just Sansa. I'm not sure why there's an opinion that Sansa is going to be 'spared' or protected from terrible things when literally, NO ONE ELSE has been. And to clarify...that doesn't mean that I think she'll turn evil, or that she'll start sleeping with half of Westeros, but I do think it means that we're going to see exactly what we saw...a 'mature' Sansa who is more than willing to use her feminine charms and seduction to get to what SHE wants.
Â 
As a side, I've read some horrified reactions from certain people (not on this forum). As if this change is COMPLETELY a fanfic of D&D. I'm confused by this perspective. I mean, wasn't her Book character headed in that direction anyways? Except, she was supposed to "seduce" Harry. So, why is it horrific for TV Sansa but perfectly acceptable for Book Sansa? Or is this just a, "What D&D writes is of the DEVIL! But if GRRM writes the same exact thing...it's a masterful work of art"?

Bolded, yikes. People actually assume that? Says more about them than the character. I doubt Sansa is gonna let go of her maidenhead any time soon. She certainly isnt gonna give it up to a chump like Littlefinger.Â 
And you touched on the book-reader elitism which is a festering boil on the backside of the fandom.  Sansa aint gonna be like Cersei. She might not even be like Marg. Shes gonna be her own creature and shes gonna watch everything.Â Sansa knows should be a meme.
4572	teemo	2014-06-02	I hate that she's his niece instead of daughter. Â Being a bastard humbled Sansa a bit, so I don't like that change. Â Also, her giving up her identity to those people is a pretty huge book deviation. Â LF had her manipulated in a way that she would never do that. Â Hated this scene.

Ned sends LF to Slynt. LF takes a detour to Cersei's chambers and goes to Slynt with a different proposal. Nobody outside the Small Council will know LF's role in Slynt's decision.
Â 
LF puts a dagger in Ned's throat while Ned attempts to arrest Cersei. All Stark soldiers are killed, Ned is never allowed to speak with Sansa. The only ones who know are the rank and file goldcloaks, who might not even know who Littlefinger is, the Kingsguard, Slynt, Cersei and Joffrey.
Â 
Oh, and the Hound. As in, that guy who's agonizing at the Vale, who likes Sansa and hates liars like Littlefinger.

I don't know. If we disregard the second half of season three when they dumb her down (should we, though?) it really seems a progression. See her interactions with Littlefinger in Season 3 and how her interactions develop through Season 4.
We should also remember that her context was changed. During Season 2 and 3, she was a prisoner, even if it was only shown by a bunch of Lannister guards barely visible at the edge of the frame. Once she reaches the Eyre, she's no longer a prisoner. She doesn't need to hide her feelings when looking at Joffrey and smile when she'd rather have them all killed. And she doesn't want to be a prisoner again. She's free now.

Truth. She could be trying to get him to make a move on her. But this is also not a good move, at least not now. She could kill him while his guard is down (i.e. when he makes his move on her): this would be easier to explain (especially considering how well her waterworks worked on the Vale Lords before) and rationalize to herself, as she would not be directly proactive (such as poisoning him). On the other hand it will be unpredictably timed because a lot depends on his actions - no guarantee that her plan would work and she would lose her virginity. I think if she wanted to make a move and vamp it up she should wait until he consolidates the Vale/Riverlands behind her, marries her to Robin. Its too soon to start seducing before she has a backup plan, particularly as he seems very receptive already.
Â 
BTWÂ I don't think she wants him - she knows he murdered twice and uses people pretty cruelly, I just don't see it b/c she is a romantic at heart, but you never know he might appear sympathetic later and she breaks.


Â 
You have to remember that as far as she's concerned, he murdered those people to protect her. She seems him as brave and bold, not evil. Why does everyone think she's going to kill him? I don't see that happeneing unless she finds out about his involvement in her father's death, and how would she even find out? Who's going to tell her? Cersei? People are projecting their own hate for LF onto Sansa. Sorry but there is no way she's plotting his demise at this point.

Â 
True. And I strongly believe neither Littlefinger nor Sansa think that Sansa losing her maidenhead now would be wise: she can only prove that her marriage to Tyrion was not consummated and can thus be annulled if it is still intact; and we now that Septons check.

So? Her father wasn't poisoned. As far as she knows, Jon Arryn died a natural death. And even if she realizes, somehow, that Lysa poisoned Jon Arryn, what is it to Sansa? She doesn't know Ned went to KL to investigate Jon's death. She doesn't know he was put on the trail of the bastards and the incests by Lysa's letter and LF's machinations. All she knows is that Ned appeared to claim that Joffrey and the boys were bastards and she probably heard that Stannis made the same claim.
Unless she meets the Hound, or Cersei spills everything, I don't think she has a way to realize what happened.

GRRM sat on his arse for too long -- the show will take Sansa into a character arc that inevitably and necessarily will progress differently than the books.
Season 5 will begin filming in late summer, which means a different arc for Sansa is a done deal.
Edited: I like the game-player, Malificent Sansa take of the show. Her performance before the Vale lords puts her into Fooking Legend territory.

Â 
The first time she questioned him on the murder, he told her that he could not trust Joffrey and basically implied that he needed new allies that were predictable. She says "Who could trust you?". She is basically suspicious of him, he's not brave and bold, he's just a shady guy. Not to mention he framed her for murder. The next episode (I feel she forces his hand here...) he confesses he killed Joffrey because he loved her mother. That was a revenge kill per his explanation, not protecting Sansa. His daddy kiss prompts Lysa to go crazy. Instead of calming her down or sending Sansa away, he manipulates and kills Lysa.Â 
I think she realizes his attraction for her and his need for more power and decides that instead of manipulating pity (like she did to Lysa, Vale Lords), she will try to control him through sex.
I think she does not want him to make any advance. In which case her vamping is a bad play. He is already doing everything she wants - protecting her, building allegiances, without her needing to gamble particularly as she would need proof of virginity to annul her marriage to Tyrion. She is just making herself more vulnerable.
Other people said that she is deliberately stoking his lust. I don't think she wants him or wants to lose her virginity to him. The only other thing would be to kill him off when its convenient. But again, in my view she doesn't not want him to make an advance.
4590	Raksha 2014	2014-06-03	I have no objection to the concept of Sansa making some moral compromises in order to survive and thrive; she cannot stay innocent forever. Â But how far will those compromises go? Â If Sansa goes along with Littlefinger's poisoning Robin and does nothing to try to save the boy, that's too far. Â If Sansa is forced or coerced into having oral sex with Littlefinger, and goes along with it and says nothing, that's too far. Â If she decides to have oral sex with Littlefinger to strengthen her hold on him or have him do something specific for her (not because she's interested in having oral sex), I would think less of Sansa. 
Â 
I don't think Arya's becoming a Faceless Assassin makes her badass, I think the transformation is shocking and sad; a child as strong and brave and honorable as Arya becoming a hired murderer because she is orphaned and abandoned and can't think of another way to survive after all she has seen and done. Â If Sansa becomes a sophisticated vamp who survives by having sex with power brokers to get ahead, I will be saddened. Â If she becomes a sophisticated vamp who uses her wits and charms to get ahead, without having to trade her body to men she does not love or like, I will cheer; and hope she will one day get a position of power or at least security.

4591	High without honor	2014-06-03	So? Her father wasn't poisoned. As far as she knows, Jon Arryn died a natural death. And even if she realizes, somehow, that Lysa poisoned Jon Arryn, what is it to Sansa? She doesn't know Ned went to KL to investigate Jon's death. She doesn't know he was put on the trail of the bastards and the incests by Lysa's letter and LF's machinations. All she knows is that Ned appeared to claim that Joffrey and the boys were bastards and she probably heard that Stannis made the same claim.
Unless she meets the Hound, or Cersei spills everything, I don't think she has a way to realize what happened.


Â 
There is still Varys who knows about it. At least in the show LF and Varys will meet again I believe.Â

4592	Lee-Sensei	2014-06-03	I doubt Royce's opinion of Littlefinger has changed much in the TV show. For Sansa's sake, they have accepted the story of Lysa's death - but if either Sansa or Robin turned up dead one day, none of the Lords of the Vale would put up with Littlefinger a second longer. But Littlefinger fell through the Moon Door? No one would shed a tear.


You think they'd be okay with Lysa being murdered?
4593	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-03	Â 
Agreed, but I think the show was kinda implying that Royce accepted LF's plot to go against the Lannisters


Â 
Unless they're also playing along, like we think they're doing in books.

Royce could be playing along in the show, though
4595	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-03	I have no objection to the concept of Sansa making some moral compromises in order to survive and thrive; she cannot stay innocent forever. Â But how far will those compromises go? Â If Sansa goes along with Littlefinger's poisoning Robin and does nothing to try to save the boy, that's too far. Â If Sansa is forced or coerced into having oral sex with Littlefinger, and goes along with it and says nothing, that's too far. Â If she decides to have oral sex with Littlefinger to strengthen her hold on him or have him do something specific for her (not because she's interested in having oral sex), I would think less of Sansa. 
Â I don't think Arya's becoming a Faceless Assassin makes her badass, I think the transformation is shocking and sad; a child as strong and brave and honorable as Arya becoming a hired murderer because she is orphaned and abandoned and can't think of another way to survive after all she has seen and done. Â If Sansa becomes a sophisticated vamp who survives by having sex with power brokers to get ahead, I will be saddened. Â If she becomes a sophisticated vamp who uses her wits and charms to get ahead, without having to trade her body to men she does not love or like, I will cheer; and hope she will one day get a position of power or at least security.

The essential thing for Sansa is survival and where possible the re-establishment of the Stark name and power.  She has the opportunity to do that now. She actually holds all the Cards.  She is betrothed to Robyn--the Vale Lords would want that.  She can always recant what she said about Lysa committing suicide if LF becomes too much of a bother.
I'm sorry if you think less of her if she initiated oral sex with LF, but she knows how much he desires her. Sansa on the show still lives in a Medieval world where women have very little choice in regards to sex.  It is agency for Sansa to set the terms of a relationship where she has say and power over such a decision.  More than Dany did.
Meanwhile, she is safe, touring the Vale with Robyn and will learn and grow.
I can see Sansa  wanting revenge on the Freys and strategizing how to get back RiverRun back..

Â 
Funny you mention that, because I've consistently maintained the position that if Sansa knowingly and willingly participates in the poisoning and death of Robin Arryn, I would cease to like her. She would, in that moment, stop being my favorite character. It would just be too damn much for my blood. That sort of thing would completely cross the moral 'event horizon' for me. I mean, its one thing to kill your enemies, but it's something completely different to kill an 'innocent' child (who looks at you as a mother) simply because, what, you want his kingdom? Smh. I don't care how much I die of love for Sansa/Sophie Turner...that's just too much for me. That plot point would truly indicate to me that the woman has lost her soul and is now an antagonist (rather than a protagonist who does "questionable" things to either survive and/or advance). So, yeah, on that point, I completely agree with you. I'm ALL IN with manipulation and seduction and only God knows what else...but killing the kid....I couldn't. I just couldn't. 
Â 
In other news though, I'm super excited to see where Sansa's storyline goes because I want to know what her motivations are. What does SHE want? Does she want Winterfell? Does she want to rule the 7Ks? Does she just want vengeance? Like...what is HER driving force? I hated that the books ended with what LF supposedly wanted, but there wasn't really any indication of what Sansa wanted. Every character is driven by something. Tyrion wants Casterly Rock and vengeance. Arya wants to kill everyone. LF wants power. Varys wants to sit Aegon on the IT, etc, etc. Everyone wants something. And now--with the show having advanced Sansa's plotline as far as it has--I'm extremely interested in finding out what Sansa wants. Here's hoping we get insight into that and sooner, rather than later. Â

Â 
Well said bit there. I too think Sansa is reveling in a little power for a change. Instead of always being the victim, she's learning to play the game with the weapons she's been taught to use by Cersei and everyone else around her. It has to be somewhat empowering to make that decision and go with it.
Â 
Does it really matter if she's faking it or really going along with Littlefinger? Either way the old Sansa is gone.
Â 
Also, with the bird analogy - she knows now how a mockingbird plays - it fakes it's way by pretending to be other birds. Littlefinger's deception is perfect for her to mimic herself.
4598	ahighbornlady	2014-06-03	Â 
The first time she questioned him on the murder, he told her that he could not trust Joffrey and basically implied that he needed new allies that were predictable. She says "Who could trust you?". She is basically suspicious of him, he's not brave and bold, he's just a shady guy. Not to mention he framed her for murder. The next episode (I feel she forces his hand here...) he confesses he killed Joffrey because he loved her mother. That was a revenge kill per his explanation, not protecting Sansa. His daddy kiss prompts Lysa to go crazy. Instead of calming her down or sending Sansa away, he manipulates and kills Lysa.Â 
I think she realizes his attraction for her and his need for more power and decides that instead of manipulating pity (like she did to Lysa, Vale Lords), she will try to control him through sex.
I think she does not want him to make any advance. In which case her vamping is a bad play. He is already doing everything she wants - protecting her, building allegiances, without her needing to gamble particularly as she would need proof of virginity to annul her marriage to Tyrion. She is just making herself more vulnerable.
Other people said that she is deliberately stoking his lust. I don't think she wants him or wants to lose her virginity to him. The only other thing would be to kill him off when its convenient. But again, in my view she doesn't not want him to make an advance.


Â 
Sansa literally says that she wishes she was like him. I'm not saying she's right to admire him, but it's pretty obvious she does by AFFC.

Well, I think her compromises should go as far as to make a Via Apia of Freys and make sure Walder Frey is the last one to die, after watching how every single one of his surviving relatives are executed.
How does it compare to a blowjob?

George says it best about her motivations for going the direction she's going:Â https://www.youtube....=em-uploademail
4601	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-03	In any case LF in the books is even more predatory.  We should remember that in the books nor the show there is no 911 or Lord Declarants on speed dial for Sansa. 
 Her family, as far as she knows are all dead with the exception of Jon Snow,  who can do nothing to help her. Her home is destroyed and she was reliant on the kindness of strangers.  In the book and on the show she is aware that she is mostly sought after as the assumed heir to Winterfell.  Not valued for herself.  Her only living relative is Robyn Arryn to whom she is betrothed.  Revealing herself to the Lords Declarant, in the show, was a smart move, it will willing bind them to her.   In the books, it could be more tricky, but with Cersei on trial, it seems like she might reveal herself and we know LF plans for her to when she marries Harry.  Which leaves Robyn in serious danger from LF and possibly Sansa.  Less so in the show, at least at the moment.
If Sansa participates in murdering Robyn Arryn she will lose an essential part of herself by literally killing the last link to her father and mother. She might survive, even prosper but she will be even hollower than Cersei, who at least was trying to protect her children while fulfilling her ambitions. Sansa would be lost to herself and her heritage. She would become un-Sansa, soulless.
That is the big question for Sansa, has she absorbed the lessons and internalized LF's, Cersei's, and the Court's political game playing to the exclusion of who she is.  Is she still the brave person who risked Joffrey's wrath to rescue some drunk knight from death. Or a shallow game player bent on advancing herself, and taking revenge on those who wronged her and her family. Ready to sacrifice her cousin, an innocent child, to do it.
I'm betting there is still a core of Stark/Tully decency that remains in Sansa.

4602	Ladywhiskers	2014-06-03	Loved Sansa's dark hair and her demeanor at the end. She was barely recognizable as Sansa, with her dark hair and arch demeanor.
Â 
Being betrothed to the appalling Robyn Arryn is a good enough reason not to interfere with the poisoning LF is commencing. I'm afraid Sansa is vanishing before our very eyes, as she submerges into Alayne Stone, who is something of a dark lady. Interesting that her name is Stone, and Cat's is Stoneheart. All of the Starks seem to be undergoing similar transformations, losing their humanity and their "Starkness."
Â 
Littlefinger won't want to kill Robyn Arryn until Sansa is pregnant by Harry, at which point he will probably engineer the deaths of both, and marry Sansa himself, thereby becoming Lord Protector of the Vale. In order to enjoy an uninterrupted reign, he'll probably kill Harry first. But of course he won't allow Robyn to come of age.

Â 
No, being betrothed to Robin Arryn is not a good enough reason to stand by and let LF poison the boy. Â Don't forget, in the book, he is a young child, Sansa's own kin. Â That's not right. Â Even the TV-Robin, as bratty and spoiled as he is, has not hurt anyone; and hasn't tortured any animals. Â He could still be properly guided and taught.

Â 
I do think you're right about LF's plans; though I think he'd wait to kill Robin until Sansa has delivered one or two healthy children by Harry.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, if Sansa is party to SR's murder to steal his Kingdom and the Vale Lords find out about it, Ned's daughter or no, Bronze Yohn Royce will probably personally introduce her to the Moon Door and send her the way of dear old Aunt Lysa. Luckily, Sansa's one of the most compassionate and caring characters in the series so I doubt she will.
Â 
Sansa's arc is taking a strange turn. Where are they going with this? I don't know. I can't wait to find out.

It's unlikely Harry is going to happen on the show and in the books he's hardly someone who will put up with LF. In the book, he'll be as dead as Joffrey or he'll kill LF or Sansa may orchestrate them killing each other and rescuing SR from them both.

I hope Sansa won't be morally so far gone that she'd kill Harry just for being inconvenient. Â If he's plotting to kill Robin, that's another story and Sansa can engineer his death with my blessing (not that she or GRRM need it!).

I think justifying Sansa killing SR would be a bridge too far for GRRM, unless he means her to become Cersei 2.0

Â 
there has been a ton of references to poison being a woman's weapon on the show and of course, in the books, sansa still has the poisoned necklace. it's really not much of a stretch to assume that sansa will eventually kill littlefinger by poison even though i think it would be more painful for him to be exposed and made powerless then left to struggle. grrm seems to have other plans for him if we go by all the mention of poison and sansa's obvious move to the dark side.
Â 


I hate that she's his niece instead of daughter. Â Being a bastard humbled Sansa a bit,Â 


Â 
not only did being a bastard humble her, it was an interesting way to illustrate and explain the changes in her behavior: i will be bastard brave. i will be older and bolder. the show isn't give much reason for it. i will be more responsible and realistic and have no time for things like dancing.

I hope she doesn't kill Harry either. One does not simply walk into the Vale of Arryn and kill Arryns.

Â 
To the Sansa as a Player theorists, kudos. It is not a theory I have ever personally espoused. From my read-
ing of the books, I have gotten a still sweet girl who wants desperately to be loved and wanted for herself and
not as the heir to Winterfell. She sticks with Petyr because she has simply no other choice and if she goes
along with him, it is because she is a conciliator by nature, not a contrarian like Arya. The idea that she will
seduce LF and poison Sweet Robin, all to amass power so she can weld the Vale like a weapon against her
enemies has always and still does strike me as ludicrous. LF has implicated and entangled her in three mur-
ders (Joffrey's, Dontos' and Lysa's) and has positioned her to take the fall for Sweet Robin's. Her consenting
to killing her tiresome cousin and then turning the tables and murdering LF does not seem to me to be some-
thing to celebrate, but a great sadness, a corruption. Revenge is, like magic, a sword without a hilt. I don't see
her triumphing once she takes someone's life. It will simply make it more plausible that she was actively involved
in those other murders.
Â 
I don't want Sansa to turn into Arya. I think Arya's story arc is pathetic, the little tomboy turned into the little assassin. She's one dimensional, stuck on one note - kill, kill, kill...revenge, revenge, revenge. GRRM is all
about gray but everything is black or white for Arya, like the decor at Faceless Man's Hogwarts. I was appalled
by the "Mercy" chapter. So she kills Ralf the Sweetling. So what? Lommy's still dead. She's still an orphan
stuck on the wrong side of the Narrow Sea being exploited by an organization that murders people for money
.....lots of money. She's not badass, she's sad.
Â 
As for Sansa's new look....there was a word thrown around a lot about Gregor 3.0's first scene this season
- cartoonish. That describes it exactly.

Â 
Â 
I've always thought Arya's evolution from plucky tomboy to trainee assassin to be tragic rather than exciting. Â Jeez, that poor little girl has been exposed to so much violence, not to mention having to kill to survive (and at far too young an age to develop any mature way to handle it), that she's killing without compunction. Â And she's being taught to be a thug for hire. Â Wow. Â The only way she's different from the Unsullied is that she hasn't been mutilated (at least not permanently) or been forced to kill babies or puppies (yet). Â And there's still a bit of Arya that holds onto House Stark and the family she's lost. Â 
Â 
I wouldn't mind if Sansa eventually killed Littlefinger (after learning how he manipulated and betrayed her father), but I would hate to see her become Littlefinger Lite, using and discarding 'loose ends'. Â And she's got to try to save Robin in the books, or she'd be turning her back on everything she was born to be, all of her parents' teachings (not all of which were useless or frivolous).
4614	zaphodbrx	2014-06-03	I think people are hating on Littlefinger a little too much..
Â 
Stop confusing show!Littlefinger with book!Littlefinger, they're not even close to the same character. Show!Littlefinger is mainly a whore management expert, who tries dabbling in politics now and then but usually results in bumbling idiocies like 'Power is power' scene, trying to come on to Cat, monologuing to Varys about his exact plans, and so on. He himself said in season 3 that 'whores are the real challenge'. Why is it so surprising that he comes across as an idiot with no plan whatsoever about the Lords of the Vale. It's just a logical conclusion to his character development.Â 
Â 
I actually don't mind the deviations any more.. Seeing the evil whore monger become a boy-toy for Darth Sansa is rather amusing in my book.

It is funny how people forget that she was always a little manipulative.Â  She tried to manipulate Joffrey to fight in the vanguard is one example.Â  Sanasa, is a lot smarter than people think.Â  She consistently uses her power when sheÂ  thinks has leverage over someone and when she has none, she makes herself small, irrelevant and throws herself at their mercy.Â  It's a very compelling strategy.Â
4616	The Reader Lisa	2014-06-03	A little more re: Sansa as a Player and I'm done, I promise:
Â 
All these scenarios about Sansa (ruling the Vale, the North, marrying Faegon) hinge on her being the heir
to Winterfell.Â  But Sansa isn't the heir to Winterfell. At some point, Lady Mormont and Co. are going to
emerge from the Neck with Robb's will which disinherits Sansa in favor of Jon Snow whom he has legitamized.
The remembering North is going to take martyred St. Robb's last request very seriously. And, no, most of
us don't think Jon is dead like in dead-dead. And Howland Reed might be part of this entourage and weÂ 
might finally have Jon's parentage confirmed. (A Stark and a Targaryen! Yowser!) A legitimate Targaryen
too, thanks to Robb.
Â 
Meanwhile, we have Davos off to Worst-Vacation-Spot-Ever Skagos to rescue Rickon. So, we might have
the Manderleys producing Rickon as the heir to Winterfell, trailing ShaggyDog to give him proper Stark
cred, at some point.
Â 
Bran is also alive. Okay, he's becoming a tree but it's early days yet and it might not be permanent. And
meanwhile, he's added some interesting tools to his skill set. Maybe he could run the North by tree-mail.
Â 
Arya's still alive and Braavos has already messed with Cersei by endorsing Stannis. I'd assumed they
would use Arya's Faceless Girl's skills to kill Cersei but producing a Stark heir would also create some
mischief for her.
Â 
And last but not least, we still have Jeyne Westerling who just might turn out to be pregnant after all.
Perhaps moon tea, like guest right and death, isn't what it used to be.
Â 
So, what's a Sansa to do? Step graciously aside for her siblings after having whored and murdered
her way into power? Or will Westeros have the Dance of the Wolves like it once had the Dance of
the Dragons? A song cycle Sansa was most engrossed in the night of the Hand's tourney. Fore-
shadowing?
Â 
As for Faegon, I wouldn't rely on him much as a Sansa empowerment tool. I figure he's going to die
sooner than later of cockiness, greyscale or, if he ever runs into Dany, be made into S'mores by
Drogon. (I just can't envision Dany being too thrilled with sharing power with that little twerp)
Â 
And don't forget Mommy Dearest. I can't see UnCat being pleased that Sansa consorted with LF even
if she does ultimately kill him. UnCat isn't exactly reasonable or forgiving and maybe before Lord
Beric rezzed her, she found out somehow that Sansa went tattling to Cersei about Ned's plans. Bad
girl! Or maybe that ridiculous dominatrix outfit would be enough to get her hanged by her mother.
4617	jentario	2014-06-03	Â 
Â 
She said "I know what you want...." and he said "when you know what someone wants, you can control them." Â Take it from there.


Exactly. It ties with what Littlefinger said, that hiding his true motivations makes him unpredictable and gives him power. She knows his motivations, and he is almost powerless to her.
Also, can anyone link the angry Sansa shot? I don't think we'll see her again this season, but if there's proof...
4618	AryaNymeriaVisenya	2014-06-03	Â 
No, being betrothed to Robin Arryn is not a good enough reason to stand by and let LF poison the boy. Â Don't forget, in the book, he is a young child, Sansa's own kin. Â That's not right. Â Even the TV-Robin, as bratty and spoiled as he is, has not hurt anyone; and hasn't tortured any animals. Â He could still be properly guided and taught. Â And in himself, he does not pose a definite threat to Sansa's physical safety.
Â 
I do think you're right about LF's plans; though I think he'd wait to kill Robin until Sansa has delivered one or two healthy children by Harry.


Â 
Maybe that is the point, we see her in season one not backing up her sister for her own interests. We all expect her to right herself after that but what if she just goes to the next level and offs her cousin because he is in the way.
4619	Rapsie	2014-06-03	Also the Jaime / Tyrion conversation about cousin killing might be foreshadowing (as well as a reference to Jaime). I hope she doesn't help to kill SR but I suspect she will be lured towards it by LF. In the books it seems as if it will be unwittingly, but all the Starks are facing dark choices in their development, it is just how far along that path they go. 
It will be interesting to see if they kill Sandor off or not. If he does survive, then the Grand Tour of the Vale hints at them meeting again. As she became his moral compass in ACOK maybe he will become hers in TWOW. Also an interesting version of rescuing each other.
4620	hallam	2014-06-03	Â 
It might not go that much south because Royce, Waynwood and Cobray were manipulated even worse than LF was. Even if does go south she still gains something from it. If those three manage to see through her deception Sansa's safe because she's an asset and also the key to the North as Robb Stark's. But, in the same time, if the whole plan blows up in their faces, Lf's pretty much done ... he's getting a first class ticket on Moon Door Airways and she still manages to eliminate one of her father's betrayers.


LF is gonna get the chop from Sansa, sure. But not through the moon door. The whole set was struck. So they are unlikely to return to the Erie. And lets face it, GRRM does not find it difficult to think up innovative ways to kill of characters.
Â 
We have already had two Moon door deaths.
Â 
I have a feeling that LF is going to meet Lady Stoneheart before the end as well.Â
4621	Rapsie	2014-06-03	They may have Sansa kill LF differently in the books to the series. As things progress they may start changing major details from the books, it could very well end up that some characters in the show have completely different endings to the books.

I think you'll see her in the last episode.Â  I think everyone who is alive gets their 3 minutes of fame.
4623	Chebyshov	2014-06-03	I think you'll see her in the last episode.Â  I think everyone who is alive gets their 3 minutes of fame.


Â 
IMDB says she's in (not the most reliable source though), as well as a Royce (I believe it was Nestor, have to check again). If it is Nestor maybe Sansa will find out Ayra is alive? Of course she's disguised now, so that's not incredibly likely.
Â 
I think we'll be seeing every main character except Theon/Boltons.
4624	Janicia	2014-06-03	With both Sansa and Arya, people bitterly complained that the girls didn't have enough agency in their escapes from Kings Landing and Harrenhal, but then the show turned around and gave those characters agency in spades a little later on. Â 
Â 
Sansa is still a virgin. Â The show cares deeply about Sansa's journey into womanhood and won't gloss over that bit. Â One of the first things out of her mouth in the pilot was explaining to Cersei that she hadn't gotten her period. Â We saw her first kiss, the souring of her first love, we saw her get her period, we saw her sex education from Cersei and Margery, we saw the first wedding night. Â When she loses her virginity, it won't be ambiguous. Â 
Â 
During the sewing-on-a-bed scene, it felt to me like Sansa was reconciling herself to teaming up with Littlefinger and playing the game for real. Â Then she put on her new dress representing a new Â identity and she transformed. Â
4625	jons nissa	2014-06-03	They may have Sansa kill LF differently in the books to the series. As things progress they may start changing major details from the books, it could very well end up that some characters in the show have completely different endings to the books.


Â 
this may be true but so far, most (possibly all?) the show deaths have matched the book deaths, right?
4626	Chebyshov	2014-06-03	this may be true but so far, most (possibly all?) the show deaths have matched the book deaths, right?


Â 
For the most part. There are exceptions (Mago dies in the show and not in the books, for instance), but for the most part the manner has been the same. Or when the manner is different (Rast, Karl), the plot following resets to be the same.Â 
Â 
I don't think the endings will be different. Because of the difference in medium, the paths from point A to point X may be different, but X is unlikely to change. Otherwise, they wouldn't have sat down with GRRM and hashed everything out.
4627	Janicia	2014-06-03	I liked that Sansa revealed herself to the Lords Declarant. Â That gets her partially out from under Littlefinger's thumb. Â She knows he wants her alive, and now if he mistreats her, she has recourse. Â Given how far she is from Kings Landing now, and how hard the Vale is to assault, it makes sense to balance the risk of Cersei finding her against the risk of being at Littlefinger's mercy. Â 
Â 
It is a real problem for the show that the characters are increasingly spread out. Â It makes a lot of sense to fast forward through some of the isolated parts and get characters back into position to do something that matters to other people on the show. Â With Arya going into complete obscurity next season, hopefully Sansa and Littlefinger's plotline will have ramifications in Kings Landing. Â 
Â 
Ok here is a thought: it seems likely that Cersei will suspect one or both of the Stark girls are in the Vale next season (Arya's announcement was hardly discreet and even Pod knows Sansa probably went to the Vale). Â If Varys is remotely competent, he should point her in that direction, particularly since he hates/fears Littlefinger. Â While her central conflict will be with the Tyrells, Cersei could become obsessed with invading the Vale rather than screwing around with a bunch of new characters. Â If the show wanted to veer far off the path of the books, they could send the Ironborne straight for Dany rather than invading the Reach, and could send Loras with the Tyrell army toward the Vale. Â Given Sansa and Loras' history, that could be kinda fun. Â

Â 
And by "confessing" she also has something on Littlefinger now, officially making him her bitch. If he ever steps out of line she can always tell the Lords Declarant what really happened and claim that LF forced her to lie to them because everybody knows how dangerous he is. That would basically be Darth Sansa's word against LF's but considering how much they "like" him and the fact that she's almost family to them, Baelish would definitety get a one way ticket to the Moon Door.
4629	Hippocras	2014-06-03	The Moon Door has exited the stage.
Â 
People need to stop pretending everyone is still at the Eyrie. In the show they are about to leave to tour the Lord of the Vale around his territory. It says so. Sansa says "shall we go".
Â 
In the books they were on their way down, past several way-castles last we saw. No more Moon Door, at least until the last book.
4630	Rapsie	2014-06-03	this may be true but so far, most (possibly all?) the show deaths have matched the book deaths, right?

Talisa (Jeyne Westerling is still alive) Most of the Dothraki, The Undying, reason for Axel Florent's death etc. have all had different deaths or changes. While most of these characters are minor the show is changing more and more as it progresses and as more filler is added they are changing the characer motivations and endings to suit their ideas. 
The show is still hitting major plot points but the characters are becoming very different from the books: mainly simplified or truncated versions of themselves. So with Sansa we lost her development from S3 and now they have rushed her development taking away many aspects of the book character. Her growing sexuality in the books was made non-existent on the show and now she is suddenly turning femme fatale. It wouldn't surprise me if they have their own invented death for LF that is different from the books (where it is highly likely due to Chekov's Hairnet that he will be poisoned with the Strangler). So possibly either way he ends up poisoned, but it becomes slightly different in execution.

Â 
Agreed. Plus the show tore down the Eyrie set, so I wouldn't be shocked if we never saw it again, even in the ADOS season(s?).

Or maybe that's the show's way of saying stop trying to make Chekov's Hairnet happen. It's not going to happen (in either medium).

4632	Lord Damian	2014-06-03	Just a reminder to everyone. Show Sansa has no idea that it was Littlefinger that had Jon Arryn poisoned and killed nor does she know that it was he that gave the gold cloaks to Cersei and betrayed Ned in the throne room. Book Sansa does not know about the Gold cloaks and the throne room either. I wonder what will happen if she ever does?
4633	Sand11751	2014-06-03	One thing I had wondered about was whether the show would revisit LF meeting Arya at Harrenhal. D&D have done lots without purpose; dear departed Ros, I'm thinking of you and the ghastly sexposition. There had to have been some purpose behind making LF aware that Arya was still very much alive - he never let Tywin know one of the last Starks was right under his nose, eating his food, even though LF clearly recognized her as she did him, Will LF ever let Sansa know he has seen her sister? Keeping the hope that she she is still alive and they might be reunited will mean something even to Sansa 2.0. Will Arya's solo journey be delayed now? Â Â

Â 
i was going to mention talisa but everyone connected with the show has gone to great lengths to iterate that she is not jeyne so i didn't mention her. and yes, minor characters have had different endings but the major characters all have most of their arc be the same. we may see a difference in the future but so far, they've matched up pretty closely even if there are significant differences in some of the circumstances. even here, marillon was missing but lysa still flew at the hands of littlefinger.

Â 
Oh man, just rewatched that scene (you're right about him telling Sansa that Arya's alive), and what fantastic foreshadowing to her moment from this episode. "Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself."
4638	iheartseverus	2014-05-18	https://www.youtube....h?v=3C4Qjly9sFE
Â 
Here's the promo.Â  Let's hope we get the recap this week!
4639	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-18	Here's this, in case my thread isn't approved:
Â 
(If something is italicized, it is merely speculation. If not, it is concrete information.)
-
As far as I can tell, these storylines will not be featured: Arya, Bran, Daenerys, Davos/Stannis, Brienne/Podrick
Â 
In King's Landing, the day of the duel arrives and a verdict on Tyrion is reached. Presumably, we will get the scene bewteen Tyrion and Oberyn before the duel, in which the Red Viper prepares for his fight and it is implied that he has poisoned his spear. I do wonder how far the showrunners will go with Oberyn's death; they haven't shied away from brutal deaths (Talisa, anyone?), but the Red Viper's demise is arguably more gruesome. I also wonder whether they will finally name him as the Viper or not. For the episode name's sake, I hope so.
Â 
I'm assuming, in this episode, we'll get the scene between Tywin and Cersei in which she voices her concerns for Tommen: "You'll fight over him like beasts until you tear him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen." Although it would work better in the finale, as a set up to her storyline next season (which the quote heavily foreshadows), so who knows?
Â 
Ygritte, Tormund and the Thenns attack Mole's Town. I wouldn't worry about Gilly. Hannah Murray said in an interview that her character will be in an episode that took place entirely at the Wall (which is, by all acounts, episode nine). I'm guessing the wildlings take her with them for some reason. The Night's Watch reacts to the news of the sack of Mole's Town.
Â 
Reek, disguised as Theon Greyjoy, takes a peace banner to the ironborn at Moat Cailin to offer them Ramsay's terms. The ironborn surrender, but we don't know if the Bastard of Bolton flays them like in the book. Even if he does, will we see the dreadful aftermath as depicted in the book? This is turning into a bloody disturbing episode. Afterward, Roose and his army will eventually regroup with Ramsay's (there's a shot of this in the first trailer), but I'm uncertain as to whether this happens in episode eight or ten.
Â 
Sansa I from AFFC. The Lords Declarant arrive to investigate Lysa's death and interrogate Littlefinger and Alayne. I wonder if Sansa is coached to lie for Baelish (as in the book), or if she surprises him. I'm assuming there won't be a fall guy (Marillion) and that Baelish will pass it off as a drunken accident.
Â 
If Dany is in the episode: Dany finds out about Jorah's spying because of saboteur Tywin's meddling. She summons him to her throne room to give him a chance to explain. He does not beg forgiveness and denies any wrongdoing. Dany banishes him, but not before threatening to have his head should she ever see him again. That's how it happens in the books, at least. I can see the adaptation diverging, for example, by having Dany exile him for the simple discovery of his treachery and his failing to excuse it, instead of his insistence of having good intentions.
Â 
If Arya is in the episode: Arya and Sandor reach the Bloody Gate, where the Knight of the Gate denies them entrance to the Eyrie. Sandor starts a fight and is badly wounded, but gets away with Arya. Too weak to ride, Arya attempts to treat his wounds until she realizes he is beyond saving. Sandor is left for dead after Arya decides he doesn't deserve the gift of mercy.

4640	DaveyJoe	2014-05-18	Sam sheds a tear in that preview, if something bad happens to Gilly I'm going to write a strongly worded letter to the producers.Â
4641	~No One~	2014-05-18	^"This is turning into a bloody disturbing episode." Not really speculation! 
I'm expecting the duel to be the last scene, so as to leave viewers with the horror/realization that Tyrion dies. Episode 7 was quite jumpy due to lots of storylines, so I for one am hoping that the whole episode is as tight as you described it above.
I also feel that Arya will leave the Hound and sail away all in episode 10, but that's based mostly on personal preference. Especially after their little moment together this week, they need some time to dislike each other again
4642	Arkash	2014-05-18	I wouldnt be surprised if Gilly actually escapes with her son and warns the Watch. After all, she's a wildling and survived North of the Wall
Â 
And apparently, it is a non-Dany episode, which I'm glad of ! Second of the season. This episode needs room !
Â 
I bet we're gonna see Arya and the Hound as well. Not a word about them in the synopsis nor a glimpse in the preview. I think all their stuff is too spoilery.
Â 
Wildcard : Brienne and Pod ?

					
					
							Edited by Arkash, 18 May 2014 - 10:59 PM.
4643	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-18	Oh, Dany has at least one, if not two scenes. The pervy site mentioned we will finally get Missandei bathing in the lake, and Dany is with her.
Â 
I also think we will get Arya.
Â 
But I still don't think that adds up to 53 minutes.
4644	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-18	Since Episode 9 is entirely The Wall, 8 should touch on most of the storylines.
Â 
Maybe we get a quick check-in with Bran? Or is he really going to be entirely absent e6,7,8, and 9?

4645	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-05-18	That kiss in the preview between Oberyn and Ellaria looks so epic.. i'm gonna be gutted by this fight  . It's one of my favorite moments in the whole series so I hope they do it justice.Â
4646	DaveyJoe	2014-05-18	I wouldnt be surprised if Gilly actually escapes with her son and warns the Watch. After all, she's a wildling and survived North of the Wall

Â 
I hope you're right, I just get so worked up over Gilly. Â My logic tells me that the show will bring her story back to where it needs to be, but my heart nags at me with doubt. Â If something bad happens to her I will flip tables and do cart wheels of rage.
4647	Winterfell is Burning	2014-05-19	Damn it, I already care about Oberyn more than I've ever cared in the books. This is going to be awful!
4648	Frey Pies	2014-05-19	This episode, as far as we know, will probably have:
Â 
- Arya scene, where she abandons the hound
- Conversation with Tyrion before, and then Oberyn vs the Mountain (I expect this to be about 15 minutes long)
- Dany and Missandei bath scene
- Ramsay instructing Theon, and then Theon taking Moat Cailin
- Sansa confessing to the Lords of the Vale (intrigued by this one)
- Ygritte and co. attacking Mole's Town
- Gilly escaping to the wall, informing Jon and co. Getting ready for the epic Episode 9.Â 
Â 
Â 
That's quite a lot of things to fit in this episode. I have a feeling that the Dany and Jon stuff will not take that long. I expect the longer scenes to be Arya, Sansa and Theon. --> 38 minutes in total for all that. Then, of course, the last 15 minutes will be all Oberyn.

I think it's more likely that Jon and co. learn of Mole's Town from the top of the Wall. He and Sam were sent up to patrol...
Â 
I don't see Gilly escaping.
4650	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-19	Also, since "Only Cat" was e7 I'm not sure what to make of Littlefinger's line "I want to know which side you're on" from the first trailer.
Â 
and Yara. I don't know what's going on with her. I thought maybe we'd see her at the Moat tonight and hear about Balon, or maybe that'll happen episode 8 right before Theon comes along.

Him telling Sansa to lie for him, of course. Mere seconds after Lysa's murder. In the very same room. Or not?
4653	Seneti	2014-05-19	This episode, as far as we know, will probably have:
Â 
- Arya scene, where she abandons the hound

Â 
Good summary. I agree that Gilly will most likely be the one informing the NW of the attack on Mole Town and Arya abandoning the Hound makes percet sense being in this episode, as it would basically be the "end" of both Clegane brothers.
Â 
And I agree with Ignorant Bog Woman: this episode will be really disturbing (by which I mean more than usual).
4654	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-19	Him telling Sansa to lie for him, of course. Mere seconds after Lysa's murder. In the very same room. Or not?


OH ok, the figure did look like Sansa to me, but theÂ why eluded me. That could be it.

Â

Â 
I think Gilly's actress said something along the lines of being in an episode focused entirely on the wall. So I'm pretty sure she makes it.

Â 
Unfortunately, Isaac Hempstead Wright confirmed that he's in only 4 episodes this season 
Â 
At least the screen-time he does/will have this season was amazing, unlike in previous seasons, when it mostly didn't feel too engaging. The writers have gotten much better at this imo.Â
4657	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-19	Here's this, in case my thread isn't approved:
Â 
(If something is italicized, it is merely speculation. If not, it is concrete information.)
-
As far as I can tell, these storylines will not be featured: Arya, Bran, Daenerys, Davos/Stannis, Brienne/Podrick
Â 
In King's Landing, the day of the duel arrives and a verdict on Tyrion is reached. Presumably, we will get the scene bewteen Tyrion and Oberyn before the duel, in which the Red Viper prepares for his fight and it is implied that he has poisoned his spear. I do wonder how far the showrunners will go with Oberyn's death; they haven't shied away from brutal deaths (Talisa, anyone?), but the Red Viper's demise is arguably more gruesome. I also wonder whether they will finally name him as the Viper or not. For the episode name's sake, I hope so.
Â 
I'm assuming, in this episode, we'll get the scene between Tywin and Cersei in which she voices her concerns for Tommen: "You'll fight over him like beasts until you tear him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen." Although it would work better in the finale, as a set up to her storyline next season (which the quote heavily foreshadows), so who knows?
Â 
Ygritte, Tormund and the Thenns attack Mole's Town. I wouldn't worry about Gilly. Hannah Murray said in an interview that her character will be in an episode that took place entirely at the Wall (which is, by all acounts, episode nine). I'm guessing the wildlings take her with them for some reason. The Night's Watch reacts to the news of the sack of Mole's Town.
Â 
Reek, disguised as Theon Greyjoy, takes a peace banner to the ironborn at Moat Cailin to offer them Ramsay's terms. The ironborn surrender, but we don't know if the Bastard of Bolton flays them like in the book. Even if he does, will we see the dreadful aftermath as depicted in the book? This is turning into a bloody disturbing episode. Afterward, Roose and his army will eventually regroup with Ramsay's (there's a shot of this in the first trailer), but I'm uncertain as to whether this happens in episode eight or ten.
Â 
Sansa I from AFFC. The Lords Declarant arrive to investigate Lysa's death and interrogate Littlefinger and Alayne. I wonder if Sansa is coached to lie for Baelish (as in the book), or if she surprises him. I'm assuming there won't be a fall guy (Marillion) and that Baelish will pass it off as a drunken accident.
Â 
If Dany is in the episode: Dany finds out about Jorah's spying because of saboteur Tywin's meddling. She summons him to her throne room to give him a chance to explain. He does not beg forgiveness and denies any wrongdoing. Dany banishes him, but not before threatening to have his head should she ever see him again. That's how it happens in the books, at least. I can see the adaptation diverging, for example, by having Dany exile him for the simple discovery of his treachery and his failing to excuse it, instead of his insistence of having good intentions.
Â 
If Arya is in the episode: Arya and Sandor reach the Bloody Gate, where the Knight of the Gate denies them entrance to the Eyrie. Sandor starts a fight and is badly wounded, but gets away with Arya. Too weak to ride, Arya attempts to treat his wounds until she realizes he is beyond saving. Sandor is left for dead after Arya decides he doesn't deserve the gift of mercy.


Â 
Dead on I'd say.
4658	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-19	Â 
Unfortunately, Isaac Hempstead Wright confirmed that he's in only 4 episodes this season 
Â 
At least the screen-time he does/will have this season was amazing, unlike in previous seasons, when it mostly didn't feel too engaging. The writers have gotten much better at this imo.Â 


I agree that she'll make it. They didn't upgrade Hannah to regular status for no reason. But I don't think she'll escape. I stated above that the wildlings will capture her and either recruit her for the assault or use her as a bargaining chip or something, I don't know...
4659	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	^She won't die though. She said in an interview that she's in an episode centered around the Wall. So she'll feature in episode nine in some way, it's just a question of how.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 19 May 2014 - 02:56 AM.
4660	VladimirDulud	2014-05-19	This episode, as far as we know, will probably have:
Â 
- Arya scene, where she abandons the hound
- Conversation with Tyrion before, and then Oberyn vs the Mountain (I expect this to be about 15 minutes long)
- Dany and Missandei bath scene
- Ramsay instructing Theon, and then Theon taking Moat Cailin
- Sansa confessing to the Lords of the Vale (intrigued by this one)
- Ygritte and co. attacking Mole's Town
- Gilly escaping to the wall, informing Jon and co. Getting ready for the epic Episode 9.Â 
Â 
Â 
That's quite a lot of things to fit in this episode. I have a feeling that the Dany and Jon stuff will not take that long. I expect the longer scenes to be Arya, Sansa and Theon. --> 38 minutes in total for all that. Then, of course, the last 15 minutes will be all Oberyn.


Â 
It should also contain a slice of the Tyrells, hopefully. Tommen's reign must needs be addressed.

Are you replying to me?
If so... GORAMMIT, I keep saying I DON'T EXPECT HER TO DIE. Re-read my posts!
4662	The hairy bear	2014-05-19	I'm not very satisfied with the CGI view of Moat Catlin. Mereen and Braavos have been spot on, but I really don't like the direction they've gone with the moat.If Arya is in the episode: Arya and Sandor reach the Bloody Gate, where the Knight of the Gate denies them entrance to the Eyrie.

I think there's no nees to include another fight (those last three episodes are already very crowded with action), and the groundwork has already been done with the Hound refusing Arya to burn his wound.

4663	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	I was more replying to the general thread of speculation Ignorant Bog Woman. I didn't mean to imply that you had implied that. But other posters had, so the Hannah Murray interview tidbit seemed pertinent.
Â 
The hairy bear, but we do know that there will be another Hound fight because of the "weapons and training video" and that it will be in the Vale. We also know from that video that the Hound will give one last lecture to Arya and say "men kill with steel", presumably in response to a line of dialogue that Maisie alluded to about Joffrey in a post-PW interview she did, "I would've killed him with a chickenbone if I had to".

As Konradsmith said, we know Hound will fight Vale knights. It's possible the neck bite infection gets him in the end, but he will be wounded in the fight against the Vale soldiers as well. Also, Rory said he was in (paraphrasing) "3 or 4 fight scenes this season." There's the inn fight in episode one, and the one in this episode. Needs one more or he was way off. He's definitely fighting one last time. Only question is whether it will be in episode eight or ten.
4665	ovis alba	2014-05-19	Damn it, I already care about Oberyn more than I've ever cared in the books. This is going to be awful!


Â 
This. I sort of did like him in the book, but I also appreciated the way he died, because it felt like a twist on all the evil mastermind that need to first give a speech about his whole plan, before killing the hero, which of course always makes him fail.
In the show the whole role is just even more charismatic and I like how he mixes up things, e.g. in the council scene as a counterpart to Mace especially.
I know for the story it really has to happen, but it's not like a certain wedding, where I sort of looked forward to the moment, but at the moment the fact that the character will be "lost" sort of hurts more than the excitment about the scene.
4666	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	So if we also get a Brienne fight (that ear-biting has to show up sometime soon, doesn't it?)Â and a Hound fight this episode along with the raid on Mole's Town, the trial by combat and Moat Caillin, this will be a very action-y episode.
Â 
I'm sure I missed something too. Man. A lot to come and two weeks to speculate and ponder about it.

4667	Hath4	2014-05-19	TVLINE | How much did you know about flaying before you started doing this role?
[Laughs] I had no idea about flaying at all. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pretty gruesome. Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something, which youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see later on, which is very interesting.

( Alfie Allen interview form tv line possibly refering to moat cailin).
4668	Frey Pies	2014-05-19	So if we also get a Brienne fight (that ear-biting has to show up sometime soon, doesn't it?)Â and a Hound fight this episode along with the raid on Mole's Town, the trial by combat and Moat Caillin, this will be a very action-y episode.
Â

Â 
I think that ear bite might be Brienne's resistance to getting caught by the BWB. They will capture her anyways, and take her to LS. So it can potentially be in Episode 10.Â 
Â 
But, either way, this will be an action packed episode.
4669	Father of Dragons	2014-05-19	I really hope we get a recap this time. After watching it on YouTube (after the episode officially aired), it was clearly just a mistake on someone's part. A mistake I hope they don't make again.In the North
Theon and Ramsay ride to Moat Cailin to "negotiate" with the Ironborn. If there's any chance of Yara, it'll be before they arrive. We will be getting more of Yara, because there's a shot of her in her boat in the day. It could be her rowing to Moat Cailin, or to another ship beyond the Moat. Personally, I think the Moat looks pretty good. This scene should play out kinda like the books, but I'm not sure to what extent they will follow. IMO, Theon still looks like Reek. He's not..whole enough to pass as Theon. But I guess we'll just see where it goes.In the Riverlands
I had hoped that Brienne/Pod and Hound/Arya would be headed for collision, or at least a near-miss, but since they this week arrived at the Inn of the Kneeling Man (I assume, of course. Could be the Crossroads) it'd be a big fuck you to logic if they did. Arya and Sandor have been travelling to the Vale for close to a whole season. Brienne left only a few episodes ago. If they met, it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. If however, Brienne arrived at the Inn at the Crossroads, then coming across each other, or at least being very close, is possible.
However, either way, I do not believe that they will collide. It seems more likely that this episode, either the Hound's wound will grow worse, and he will start a fight at the Bloody Gate, or it is just one of them. Whether or not he will get left behind in this episode, I'm not sure.
Brienne-wise, this episode seems the most likely to contain the biting of the man's ear. I dint know who it'll be, or where it'll happen. I just hope she is knocked unconscious and gets taken away.At the Eyrie
It is clear that the Lords & Lady don't trust Baelish, so they will ask San - sorry - Alayne: "Lord Baelish has told many lies." My theory on this is that they will say that Lysa simply slipped and fell. When Alayne says "I have to tell the truth", Baelish might worry, or he might have confidence in her to lie. I think she will tell the Lords & Lady that Lysa was drunk and didn't say immediately to protect her memory.In Meereen
If we get anything, it will be Tywin's letter arriving and Jorah being exposed. He'll definitely be banished in episode 10.In Mole's Town and at the Wall
It's clear that the wildlings attack Mole's Town, and Gilly's life is put in danger. I don't think she will does on another note, the way Ygritte is holding the knife makes me think that she will hold it to someone's neck rather than stab someone. It's possible a whore will shout "They're here for the wildling!" and Gilly will ehat her escape or be taken prisoner.
If Gilly arrives, Sam's tears are because he thinks he is an idiot who out Gilly's life in danger.
If Gilly does not arrive and is a prisoner, Sam's tears are because he thinks he is an idiot who got Gilly killed.In King's Landing
Undoubtedly the saddest and most shocking part of the episode. I don't care if the Unsullied complain we haven't got enough Oberyn, because no matter how much they get, they can always appreciate his (somewhat limited) badassery.
"You're going to fight that?"
Oberyn's line "I'm going to kill that" better follow.
Anyway, we'll get a scene or two with Oberyn and Tyrion. Definitely one before the fight, possibly one near the beginning of the episode as well. Cersei's line about "burning our house" could be this episode, but as someone else said, if it was in the finale, it'd be more obvious foreshadowing for next year.
I loved the "Say her name!" "Elia of Dorne!" lines in the books, and that makes me think that they'll be omitted from the show. I doubt he'll do his big twirl while shouting "Elia!". I also hope they keep in the skull-smashing. My guess is, Gregor will say his lines, raise his fist, and the camera will cut to Tyrion or Tywin or Cersei or Ellaria as blood squirts up from where Gregor is punching.
4670	iheartseverus	2014-05-19	Â 
I hope you're right, I just get so worked up over Gilly. Â My logic tells me that the show will bring her story back to where it needs to be, but my heart nags at me with doubt. Â If something bad happens to her I will flip tables and do cart wheels of rage.


Hm, don't think I've ever actually seen cart wheels of rage--please have someone tape you doing this, and bring it here to share!
4671	Hath4	2014-05-19	I really do not see any reason why the Moat  Cailin scene should be any different than the books. i do not think it's too gruesome for the show to show the aftermath of the ironborn tied to poles flayed. the show has done more graphic things in the past.
4672	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-19	Since Episode 9 is entirely The Wall, 8 should touch on most of the storylines.
Â 
Maybe we get a quick check-in with Bran? Or is he really going to be entirely absent e6,7,8, and 9?


Could Bran be featured in episode 9, we know it takes place at the Wall, but technically it includes beyond the wall as well
4673	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-19	So if we also get a Brienne fight (that ear-biting has to show up sometime soon, doesn't it?)Â and a Hound fight this episode along with the raid on Mole's Town, the trial by combat and Moat Caillin, this will be a very action-y episode.

Â 
Could Brienne bite off the Hound's ear?
Â 
It would be pretty exciting if they clashed.
Â 
Again, wishful speculation that probably won't happen, unless Arya uses it as an opportunity to escape (which would ruin her final moment with Houndy)

4678	Arkash	2014-05-19	Yeah, they put the night filter on... this makes me wonder if we will see Yara again this season. I'm not sure she'll show up at the Moat, but I hope we see her at least in 10.
Â 
So, we have two wildcards this episode : the two roadtrips : Hound/Arya - Brienne/Pod. We're not a 100% sure they'll appear this episode (although I'd be ready to bet we'll get Arya and the Hound) and we dont know for sure what's gonna happen to them (apart from the small clues of videos, promos and leaks).
Â 
As for Gilly, there are two options :
Â 
1 - She is taken prisoner by the wildlings ( or maybe they find out she's a wildling and want to take her with them).
2 - She escapes (I prefer that) and warns the Wall. It would be nice for the character to show her under such a good light and not just that dumb girl.

4679	~No One~	2014-05-19	I wouldnt be surprised if Gilly actually escapes with her son and warns the Watch. After all, she's a wildling and survived North of the Wall
Â 
Â 
Wildcard : Brienne and Pod ?I agree Gilly survives, if for no other reason than she helps with Sam's S5 arc.
Also, there can't bee too much of Brienne & Pod! Love them!

4681	Stark11	2014-05-19	Do you guys think they will show the scene where Oberyn declares to the court he is fighting for Tyrion.. Or are they gonna just gloss over that. I would love for that to be the first scene of the episode, then the last would obviously be the duel. 
I've never been big on them having exact quotes right or anything like that (like "only cat") but I really want them to include "I'm going to kill that" and all his lines during the fight. Him yelling "Elia" and "you raped her, murdered her" really made that chapter for me in the books. Plus I think they should to show the unsullied just how good of a fighter Oberyn really is, that he can basically play around with a man everyone fears.
4682	Nuts and Boltons	2014-05-19	Oh, Dany has at least one, if not two scenes. The pervy site mentioned we will finally get Missandei bathing in the lake, and Dany is with her.
Â 
I also think we will get Arya.
Â 
But I still don't think that adds up to 53 minutes.

Â 
In the episode 8 preview, Ellaria says "You're going to fight that?, so I'm pretty sure Oberyn is going to say "I'm going to kill that."
4684	Arkash	2014-05-19	As much as I'd love for Oberyn to declare himself the champion in front of the court, I dont think that's gonna happen. It will probably be Cersei and Tywin mentioning it in the beginning of the episode.
Â 
In other things, I really like what seems to happen with Sansa, saying she wants to tell the truth. It seems obvious she's gonna lie (after all, aint she becoming a pretty good one in the end ?). I really wonder what the lie will be : "She was drunk." - "She tripped and fell." - "She was pushed by one of her guards." ...
4685	pntrlqst	2014-05-19	Arya will be in this episode, as there is a picture of her accompanying the episode on HBO.com.
4686	sgolvera	2014-05-19	This probably not going to happen but it could be a departure from books.Â  Oberyn survives the fight with the Mountain andÂ returns toÂ DorneÂ .Â  This would mean that Tyrion goes free however his life is still in great danger from Cersei.Â  He can still murder Tywin and Shae before he flees.Â  I just like the character Oberyn and don't want him to be gone so soon.Â  Wishful thinking.

Â 
The letter in show is replacing Barristan in the books.. I am curious though to learn about it's contents as I suspect it'll be something more clever than "LOL JORAHS A SPY LOL" I expect it will almost mention that in passing but that mention will be what Dany focuses on and maybe Barristan will have to, maybe begrudgingly, fill her in.

I think they'll realize she's a wildling and she'll be forced to be a part of the attack. Then, Sam will kill her in the battle. On accident, of course.

I hope we see the scene where Arya leaves the Hound to die, and the scene where Jorah is busted in receiving a letter from Varys. In that case the story for the final episode will be where Arya boards the ship for Braavos, and Dany banishes Jorah for spying her.

Â 
Makes me convinced S5 is going to wrap up ADWD and AFFC material. And some characters (Bran, Sansa, Brienne) may even be in TWOW territory next year.
Â 
EDIT:
At the very least Dany's storyline will end where it does in ADWD. No way they have a fan favorite park her butt in Mereen for a season and a half without flying off on Drogo.

Â 
Yep. IMO the only question for Dany's arc next season is if her dragon flight will occur in the season finale, or episode 7/8.
4698	King Tommen	2014-05-19	As far as Moat Cailin goes, I think there's zero chance that Yara is there or appears in this episode. It doesn't make any sense for her to go there, she'll head back to Pyke and I'm hoping in the finale we'll finally have Balon die, either when she gets there or right before. They better not have him die off-screen as that would be ridiculously anticlimatic and since we aren't subject to the POV limitations of the books, they have no reason not to show the 3rd of the leech prophecies actually occurring. Make it mysterious if you have to hide the nature of the death but just show it for crying out loud. "Oh Yara, BTW's, your dad died a while ago. Weird huh?" would suck ass.
Â 
I also don't think they'll be anything in the way of "action" at Moat Cailin. I think they'll stick to the books and have Theon ride in to the decimated lands with all the dead bodies (as we saw in the trailers) find all the Ironborn in really rough shape, convince Ralf Kenning to surrender and they'll ride out to Ramsay and he'll do something nasty to them (probably more implied than anything too lengthy).
Â 
It also appears as if Ramsay is prepping Theon for his mission outdoors somewhere and not at the Dreadfort so it wouldn't surprise me if Ramsay is coming with Theon and camping not that far away from Moat Cailin. This means they won't have to bring everyone back to the Dreadfort and then back to Moat Cailin again to meet with Roose's army. Ramsay will be right there to accept the surrender. This also means we might get the entire sequence of Ramsay meeting Roose's army afterwards which basically would close off that arc for the season.
4699	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	^I think the Boltons and Reek will all return for the finale as well. At least for a minute or two to set up the greatness that is to come from themÂ next season. They could give us "rue the day" or "I owe you much and more". Something to hold us over for a year. That's not just wishful thinking (though obviously it is in part) but I think the finale will feature every storyline just like the previous ones. There'll just be massive moments as well as set up and falling action.

4700	~No One~	2014-05-19	^This is what I'm expecting wrt Theon and the Boltons. It wouldn't surprise me if Balon died in ep 10 right after, or right before, a conversation at the Wall about Mel's powers. 
I'm also hoping for as few story lines as possible next episode, but that said, does anyone think we'll get more of Brienne? Every scene with her and Pod has advanced either the story or her character development so far. Whose ear does she rip off, do y'all think?
4701	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-19	My anticipation is at an all time high for RV vs. The Mountain.. "You're going to fight THAT?!"Â 
2 weeks seems like AN ETERNITY!!!
4702	Hath4	2014-05-19	I do not think ramsay and roose will reunite in episode 8. To stuff the entire moat cailin sequence and the ramsay roose conversation into one epiosde is too much considering all the other strorylines that will occur in a 53 minute episode. plus the ramsay roose scene makes more sense in 10 as that episode is titled the children. I think their sequence in 8 will end with reek presenting the ironborn to ramsay and him betraying them. Then in 10 roose arrives and reunites with ramsay.

4703	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-19	As far as Moat Cailin goes, I think there's zero chance that Yara is there or appears in this episode. It doesn't make any sense for her to go there, she'll head back to Pyke and I'm hoping in the finale we'll finally have Balon die, either when she gets there or right before.Â 


Her appearance is unlikely, but Moat Cailin would be a shortcut back to Pyke, no? Didn't she only sail around the whole of Westeros for subtlety in attacking the Dreadfort? "The Children" definitely applies to Balon/Yara as well. So many possible meanings.
4704	Father of Dragons	2014-05-19	The Ramsay/Roose scene in the finale might end with Ramsay being legitimised. Or a promise to legitimise him, because I doubt he'll just have the document there with him.
4705	King Tommen	2014-05-19	Her appearance is unlikely, but Moat Cailin would be a shortcut back to Pyke, no? Didn't she only sail around the whole of Westeros for subtlety in attacking the Dreadfort? "The Children" definitely applies to Balon/Yara as well. So many possible meanings.


Â 
I might not be 100% familiar with the waterways of Westeros but I don't think there's any way to sail her huge longship "through" Westeros back to Pyke. I think she has to go back the way she came.
Moat Cailin is basically landlocked. It's on the causeway that has a bunch of bogs and swamps around it. It's not on the Narrow Sea or anything like that so unless Yara's planning on jogging halfway across Westeros to get home, I don't get why she'd bother with Moat Cailin.
4706	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-19	As Konradsmith said, we know Hound will fight Vale knights. It's possible the neck bite infection gets him in the end, but he will be wounded in the fight against the Vale soldiers as well. Also, Rory said he was in (paraphrasing) "3 or 4 fight scenes this season." There's the inn fight in episode one, and the one in this episode. Needs one more or he was way off. He's definitely fighting one last time. Only question is whether it will be in episode eight or ten.


Yea I'm leaning towards 8 simply because there is so much going on in episode 10, while I feel there may be some room in episode 8 for that scene. Not to mention I would expect the only Arya scene in episode 10 to be her getting on the boat to Braavos.Â
4707	WheelofIceandFire	2014-05-19	Arya will be in this episode, as there is a picture of her accompanying the episode on HBO.com.



Does this actually mean she will be in the episode or could they just be using a picture of her from earlier in the season?
4708	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-19	Does this actually mean she will be in the episode or could they just be using a picture of her from earlier in the season?


No, it is from the episode eight. Location looks exact as to where they fight the knights.

The stakes get higher when they take Winterfell, plan FArya (so they can legitimately rule the North) and start interacting with Stannis and Jon. Not sure FArya is even gonna happen, but once most of what I mentioned comes up, the Unsullied will definitely have greater interest. This season pretty much just deals with the Reek transformation.
Â 
At the moment, the Bolton/Greyjoy chess piece game isn't as engrossing as the trial by combat, an incoming wildling attack or the Eyrieneese Knot (with Sansa there and Brienne and Arya on the way). Can't blame the Unsullied.
4714	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	Thanks, Lord Carson. Yeah, that's from next episode for sure.

Â 
They should troll the show-only people by having Roose say something to Ramsay like "we've captured 'Arya Stark' and you will be marrying her". But of course "Arya Stark" isn't actually Arya Stark.
Â 
But don't show any Arya scenes afterwards.

Â 
Thinking the same except Ser Pounce doesn't make anymore appearances this season (jk).. but I'd love a scene of Tommen signing royal decree's for the lulz with Ser Pounce walking across the table - would be a nice "Dammit Tommen.. you're awesome but don't sign that one!" kind of thing.
4717	Uldra I	2014-05-20	I'm not very satisfied with the CGI view of Moat Catlin. Mereen and Braavos have been spot on, but I really don't like the direction they've gone with the moat.Can't they make the Hounds "death" be a consequence of the neck wound he's received from Biter in 4x07? I think there's no nees to include another fight (those last three episodes are already very crowded with action), and the groundwork has already been done with the Hound refusing Arya to burn his wound.
Me too. Hound's bite is going to fester, just like Arya said.  Ironic that ,this time, fire could've saved his life. Yeah, time to send Arya to Braavos.
Really going to miss the Brienne/Rorge/Biter scene though. . Maybe we'll get a glimpse of unCat instead.

We're likely to get an equivalent though. Here's an interview of Daniel Portman (Pod) :
Â 

â<U+0080><U+009C>
Vulture: Gwendoline Christie seems positively gleeful about a scene she has coming up in which she bites off someoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ear.

Â 
Daniel Portman: I was there for that scene, and at the time, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think it was so funny! It was an incredibly demanding shoot for her, and she did an incredible job with it, and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to be a phenomenal scene. It was incredible to witness â<U+0080><U+0094> it was so violent. But the joy of it is that we can walk away at the end of the day and talk about this cool stuff weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re getting to do, like biting off somebodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ear or stabbing a spear through somebodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a nice thing to have on your C.V. in Westeros.
â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 

Â 
I'm thinking we'll get the LS reveal shortly afterward.
4719	Konradsmith	2014-05-20	Since Gwendoline Christie and Daniel Portman filmed a bit in Iceland, I'm curious if that means they'll actually make it into the Vale. Though I do think the season will end with them coming across LSH, I don't see how that would be logistically possible if they also spend some time in the Vale.
Â 
Still my guess for the rundown is they fight some Freys and are all captured by the BWB. That may be wishful thinking on my part because I'd hate forÂ any ofÂ our favourites in the BWB to lose an ear.

4720	Konradsmith	2014-05-20	As to whether or not we'll see Bran in 408, maybe he and his merry group will witness Mance's army marching to the Wall this episode.Â It's true Isaac said that he only appears in four episodes this season, but there is the chance that he is incorrect about this since Alex Graves directed his appearance in both number two and his coming appearance in episode ten. Since Jon said that he spotted Mance's army's fires on the way back from Craster's, it stands to reason that Bran and his group would at least hear the oncoming horde.

4721	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-20	Â 
Good summary. I agree that Gilly will most likely be the one informing the NW of the attack on Mole Town and Arya abandoning the Hound makes percet sense being in this episode, as it would basically be the "end" of both Clegane brothers.
Â 
And I agree with Ignorant Bog Woman: this episode will be really disturbing (by which I mean more than usual).
I wouldn't count on Gilly warning the Watch. We Sam crying, and this is presumably in response tonews of the attack. If Gilly had brought the news then he wouldn't be so upset. My guess is Ygritte (or someone else) makes some mention of her as Craster's wife and takes her captive for some reason. The warning imo will either come from some Black Brother digging for buried treasure, or more likely they see the smoke to the South. 
Sansa's scene looks intriguing. I have to tell them the truth... interesting. I wonder what 'truth' she will tell them. If she says something like "It was my fault" I can imagine something like "Now now, you mustnt blame yourself." hopefully from Yohn Royce, to get the viewers to see hik and the Lords Declarant as "good". Imo the story will be that she fell whilst drunk or something similar, since we have no.scapegoat. I hope we get Robert's reaction to her death, his obsession with making people fly would make this all the more tragic for him.
Also sounds like we get the great lines from Ellaria and Oberyn:
"Are you going to fight that?!"
"I'm going to kill that."
Hope they keep Ellaria around for next season when we get to see Dorne
4722	misak	2014-05-20	Anyone else dissapointed thatÂ Yohn RoyceÂ known as Bronze YohnÂ is wearing a lame generic steel armor? When they announced that his character will appear I was well stoked for his awesome rune covered bronze armor  Budgetary reasons maybe?

It's certainly not the first time they've left out somebody's nickname. "Red Viper", "Giant of Lannister", "Florian/Jonquil", etc.

I did think they reference him as the Red Viper, when Tyrion Pod and Bronn were waitting for him....
4725	protar	2014-05-20	I was a bit worried that they'd kill Gilly off from the preview, but thinking about it a bit more it seems stupid to think they would. Sam getting laid is one of the cornerstone's of his character development. I hope she'll be the one to warn the NW of the Wildlings, to give her a bit of agency and pro-activity. Given Sam's explicit instructions not to employ Gilly as a prostitute I think there'll also be some tension there. Like she'll be duped into it, but just before she's forced to sleep with someone the Wildlings will attack.Â

4736	Konradsmith	2014-05-20	James Hibberd who D and D and HBO give showÂ info to all the timeÂ has an interview with them about the Trial by Combat on the EW website. I'd link it but I can't. It's easy to find on GoT's imdb page though. It's mostly just a teaser but there are a few tidbits of interest in it.
Â 
Apparently the reason they recast Gregor is because they needed a massive guy who could pull off the athletics needed for the fight. Since Halfthor used to play basketball, he can move faster than your average bulked up gentleman which was a major incentive for hiring him.

Considering that this is the penultimate episode of the season for every storyline (except the Wall), it's safe to assume that most of the characters will appear. Arya, Brienne and Dany don't seem to be ready for the climax of their storylines yet. Besides, I can't believe they won't show Dany in two episodes in a row.

Confirmed storylines:

-KL. Trial
-Wall. Wildlings are near, attack of the village.
-Theon. Taking the Moat.
-Sansa. Post Moondor.

In addition to those, I bet these will appear.

-Dany (Missandrei naked and some other stuff leading to the finale)
-Arya (fight at the Bloody Gate?)
-Brienne (biting someone's ear off?)

-Stannis (obvious)
-Bran (it seems they've decided not to give him a full arc, and nothing is really needed before the finale )

Sorry, 10 minutes for Jon/Sam delivering irrelevant exposition? That's incredibly awful. And the Hound/Arya will get much more than 5 minutes; they're getting a fight scene.

Yeah, Dany was even in "Rains of Castamere" last year when I was certain it was a pure Stark episode. Though to be honest, her Mhysa moment would have benefited a lot if her E9 scenes accompanied it in the finale.
4746	sati	2014-05-20	I'm sure the trial by combat will be given plenty of time - it's one of those big events, like PW and Tyrion's trial. I'm betting with Ellaria/Oberyn kissing/talking, Tyrion's speaking to him before the fight and the actual fight there will lots of screen time devoted to it.
4747	Hath4	2014-05-20	Reek in moat cailin will get more than 5 minutes. we will have a scene of him being coached by ramsay back at his armies camp. then we have him riding in, presenting ramsays terms to them, convincing them to surrender. Then riding back to the camp and presenting them to Ramsay. then ramsay breaking the bargin and taking them captive. that will be more like 10 minutes. ( the flaying will probably occur in between 8 and 10.)

4748	sati	2014-05-20	In the Foreshadowing special there is a quick shot of Sam and Gilly which I don't think we saw yet - at 0:13 - perhaps she escapes and goes to the Wall?
4749	Arkash	2014-05-20	Well, Gilly is our PoV for Mole's Town. The show could play on her Wildling ascent during the attack or have her escape. Anyway, she deserves some screentime, imo.
Â 
We will probably see the attack from her eyes and her escape. Cut to the top of the Wall. Jon and Sam sawing MT burn. Sam crying for Gilly. Meeting Gilly down in CB. Jon warning about the battle coming.Â 
Â 
I wonder where they'll end Reek's storyline this week. We know we have Ramsay coaching him and the Moat scene in itself (already quite some time). And then ? End on Ramsay ordering his men to capture the unarmed Iron Born maybe.

Â 
Arkash, you're right and that's likely the main reason they put Gilly in Mole's Town, other than just giving her something to do. As far as Ramsay goes, one would hope that Roose somehow shows up given that he's mentioned in the summary. It would probably make more sense for him to arrive again in episode ten though.

Yep, that one!
Â 
I was looking for some screencaps in promos that were released and I also noticed Jon's 'the whole world has fallen apart' speech, I initially thought it's gonna be in later eps but it looks like it was deleted from premiere episode, if I remember correctly and we didn't hear it in the show.
They put more stuff in promos that ended up deleted this year than last year, I wonder if we will even get that scene with Cersei yelling at Tywin about Tommen.

Roose arriving in the moat and reuniting with ramsay fits better in episode 10. episode 8 is only 53 minutes.

That one was all about her sucking up to him to get him to judge against Tyrion, so she wouldn't yell at him like that then. It's not too out of sorts to think that they'll have a scene together in episode eight or ten where Cersei gets all pissed off about either Tommen's nuptials or something to do with the trial. As people have said, that sets up season five pretty nicely.

4754	Arkash	2014-05-20	Maybe Tywin will ask her to withdraw her accusation on Tyrion because it is too dangerous to risk Oberyn Martell's life and Cersei doesnt like it and starts yelling at her father.
4755	of man and wolf	2014-05-20	Yeah, Dany was even in "Rains of Castamere" last year when I was certain it was a pure Stark episode. Though to be honest, her Mhysa moment would have benefited a lot if her E9 scenes accompanied it in the finale.


The RW should have been the only thing happening in that episode really.
4756	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-05-20	So is HBO canada viewing this on the 25th?
4757	Konradsmith	2014-05-20	^No.
4758	Seneti	2014-05-20	Apparently the reason they recast Gregor is because they needed a massive guy who could pull off the athletics needed for the fight. Since Halfthor used to play basketball, he can move faster than your average bulked up gentleman which was a major incentive for hiring him.


Â 
Pragmatic casting... I like it. It's sad that they had to recast, but I think Halfthor is going to make a wonderful Mountain that Rides.Â 
Â 
Â 
Btw, do any of you good sirs know: Where do helmets go?
4759	MR92	2014-05-21	i find it kind of hilarious that its taken arya and the hound an entire season to get from the riverlands..to the riverlands (almost at the vale maybe shes there now idk) but it will take stannis two episodes to sail to east watch and then treck it castle black. Â We should of gotten SOMETHING of them reminding us they are going to castle black in this past episode. Â

4760	MR92	2014-05-21	It's certainly not the first time they've left out somebody's nickname. "Red Viper", "Giant of Lannister", "Florian/Jonquil", etc.


yeah its weird...we got giant of lannister 3 seasons later when shae says it at the trial...likely we might get a reference to the red viper next episode, though hell die. Â Id like to hear someone call dany silver lady again like Mirri in season 1! this mhysa stuff is lammeee

If they wanted it to be a surprise then why did they make the letter scene so explicit at the end of S3? Completely ignoring that now doesn't feel like it's a mystery where Stannis is going, it feels like D+D have just forgotten that Stannis is supposed to be going to The Wall.

He means it needs to be a surprise when Stannis' forces show up in the nick of time.  As it stands now in the show, it looks like they won't make it in time.

Â 
Well, in all honesty in the show it looks like Stannis has forgotten about the North entirely. It's like to preserve the mystery D+D deliberately wrote Stannis' arc as messily as possible so there was no way anyone could guess where Stannis will be showing up in E9. I agree that his arrival needs to be a surprise, but the way D+D have handled the surprise (especially as they could have just handled it in the same way Martin did) is awful.

While I have very high opinion, unlike the writers, of non book readers' ability to remember stuff, I'm quite sure most of them forgot all about the storyline of someone 'they consider so boring'. Add to that all the hints towards Stannis going to KL and not stating that he is going to the North explicitly and you have a surprise.
4768	Patchfaith	2014-05-21	It was always going to be difficult adapting the long pause of hearing nothing but remote rumours about Stannis in the book. Most Unsullied seem to believe he's now going to attack the Lannisters, so that worked out, if a bit messy.
4769	protar	2014-05-21	Save your thought till after episode 9


Â 
It won't make any difference. No matter how badass Stannis' arrival is it doesn't change the fact that the lead up to it was handled terribly.

Â 
That's exactly my point. At the end of S3 they do explicitly tell us that Stannis is going to go North and rescue the NW. But in S4, all mentions of fighting the WWs have vanished and it's treated as though Stannis is still hellbent on taking Kings Landing. There's a complete disconnect between the story we were promised for Stannis at the end of S3 and the story we got in S4. And that is the only reason viewers consider the plot boring - because Stannis' arc has been written so terribly. It'll be a surprise, but it will be one that doesn't make any sense.

4772	Northern_Star	2014-05-21	My prediction:
Â 
Â 
Opening Scene:Â Â Â Â  Shae in bed with Tywin asking if she could come to see the fight, which he denies. He leaves to meet the small Council.; goes straight to ->
Â 
Small Council:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Oberyn declares that he'll be Tyrions Champion. A very unhappy Cersie
Â 
Follow up Arya:Â Â Â Â Â  Hounds wounds have festered and Arya leaves the Hound after he has received more wounds in another inKeep fight; goes straight to ->
Â 
Follow up Brienne: Stop at the same keep where they find the Hound and get attacked by the BWB
Â 
Follow up Theon:Â Â  Theon is Reek impersonating as Theon -mentioning Reek alot
Â 
Follow up Sansa:Â Â  She will tell the Lords of the Vale that she pushed Lysa back while she attacked her in an argument over her slapping the little prick Lord which made her fall backwards through the moon door.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Littlefingers lies wont look too bad because he was protecting his little daughter. No one will punish her since everyone was sick of Lysa anyways and since it was an accident...

Â 
Â 
Follow up Jon:Â Â Â Â Â  Small folk fleeing to Castle Black. John sees Moletown burning at night.
Â 
Kingslanding:Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Trial will turn out unexspected:
Â 
Final Scene:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Tyrion shakes his head in disbelief and looks at Cercie which is grinning towards him, Jaime watches her and leaves in disgust.

4774	Arkash	2014-05-21	Another take on how the episode might happen :Â 
Â 
- Opening on Ramsay and Reek. Ramsay briefs Theon.
- Moat Cailin events.
- Reek returns with the Iron Born. Ramsay smiks and order to enchain them.
Â 
- Small Council. Oberyn declares he'll be the champion.
- Reactions.
Â 
- Stuff at Meereen.
Â 
- Vale. Sansa tells the Lords Declarants a lie about what happened, protecting Littlefinger.
- Maybe an after scene. Littlefinger thanking Sansa for what she's done.
Â 
- Attack on Mole's Town. Gilly escaping.
- Jon and Sam spotting MT burning from atop of the Wall. Sam cries for Gilly. Jon says they have to go down to Castle Black.
- They meet Gilly who has just arrived there. Jon gives a speech.
Â 
- Arya and the Hound. I really dont know how this one will turn out.
Â 
- Duel.

Â 
It matters because it's bad writing. Absolutely terrible writing. Not only may it impact how people see the climax of Stannis' story, but it's also dull to watch in it's own right. At the end of S3 we're told quite explicitly that Stannis will be going to the Wall. At the start of S4 he's brooding in Dragonstone with no indication whatsoever that he has any plans to go to the Wall. That isn't a red herring, that's just stupid. I guarantee you, when episode 9 comes around and all the Unsullied reflect on Stannis' arc they won't be saying "WoW what a great red herring Stannis' sulking was." They'll say "damn, the was some godawful writing there."

Â 
Terrible writing is that Dany/Daario scene last week. Not telling the audience things that spoil surprises is not terrible writing. Would you like to see Tywin checking out Shae's ass or random people mentioning 'I heard brotherhood is led by lady Stark'? I think not.
Â 
And I'm not sure in what universe was that bank scene 'dull'.

Okay, your opening scene is bloody awful (sorry, but that's the brutal truth). It needs to be a surprise for the audience and Tyrion at the same time. And it's also very soap opera-ish.
Â 
I think Cersei + Tywin will react to Oberyn's decision in their scene together.
Â 
I'm not sure how far we'll get with the Hound in this episode. The fight, surely. But Arya abandoning him? If that happens in this episode, it will be RIGHT before the trial by combat. You don't put something big like the Hound dying in the middle of the episode.

Â 
Yes it is immediately, in the sense that S4 E1 follows on directly from S3 E10.Â 
Â 
I fully support D+D's decision to not spoil the surprise. But that's the thing - they did spoil the surprise in the S3 finale, but then they backtracked and pretended Stannis was going to do something different. Rather than keeping things a surprise through narrative devices they're trying to keep things a surprise by bending the setting to accommodate the surprise, in ways that don't really make sense.

Â 
What I would have done is similar to what Martin did, obfuscating what the letter Davos read was. Dragonstone's S3 arc would climax with the 3 leeches in E8, with episode 10 having a follow up scene - Davos bonding with Gendry perhaps. Then Dragonstone's S4 arc would go as follows:
Â 
E1: Davos receives the letter from the Night's Watch, warning about the White Walkers.
E2: Absent
E3: With Joffrey and Robb dead (and I'd have killed Balon by this point as well) Stannis is convinced of Mel's powers and seems close to agreeing to sacrifice Gendry - which Davos of course opposes.
E4: Davos saves Gendry, gets taken to Stannis and reads the NW letter. As in the books, it is left ambiguous what the letter is and what Stannis will be doing next.
E5/6/7: Stannis and co. are absent.
E8: The battle at the Wall
E9: Stannis offers Jon Winterfell, set up for the LC election
E10: Jon is elected LC.
Â 
ETA: This includes the Dragonstone crew for a good portion of the season (hopefully enough to satisfy contracts) and it also provides something for Gendry to do in S4, however little. It keeps the surprise of Stannis arriving at the Wall without needing to resort to contrived misdirection.

Â 
Right, but I don't think the producers have been that deceptive, Stannis' goal was clearly laid out in season 3.Â  It was up to Davos to rally troops to their cause.Â  Season 4 is about Davos making that goal a reality by getting gold and swellswords.Â  Joffrey's death just means it's Stannis' time to remind the realm that he still has a claim, he never says anything about attacking King's Landing, when Stannis saves the Wall he can talk about putting the horse before the carrot or a similar line, and it will all make sense.Â  The claim that the writers are trying to forget Stannis' last scene in Season 3 is silly, his season 4 is a direct continuation of that scene, trying to build up Stannis' army so they can go to the Wall.

What I would have done is similar to what Martin did, obfuscating what the letter Davos read was. Dragonstone's S3 arc would climax with the 3 leeches in E8, with episode 10 having a follow up scene - Davos bonding with Gendry perhaps. Then Dragonstone's S4 arc would go as follows:
Â 
E1: Davos receives the letter from the Night's Watch, warning about the White Walkers.
E2: Absent
E3: With Joffrey and Robb dead (and I'd have killed Balon by this point as well) Stannis is convinced of Mel's powers and seems close to agreeing to sacrifice Gendry - which Davos of course opposes.
E4: Davos saves Gendry, gets taken to Stannis and reads the NW letter. As in the books, it is left ambiguous what the letter is and what Stannis will be doing next.
E5/6/7: Stannis and co. are absent.
E8: The battle at the Wall
E9: Stannis offers Jon Winterfell, set up for the LC election
E10: Jon is elected LC.
Â 
ETA: This includes the Dragonstone crew for a good portion of the season (hopefully enough to satisfy contracts) and it also provides something for Gendry to do in S4, however little. It keeps the surprise of Stannis arriving at the Wall without needing to resort to contrived misdirection.


So the climax of S3 Dragonstone is Davos talking to Gendry? That's a pretty lousy climax. In fact, according to your season-season outline, absolutely nothing would happen in season 3 for Stannis. Again, I've said it before and i'll say it again, the decision to split SoS into two seasons has hurt Stannis storyline because they are trying to spread thin material through two seasons. Deciding to go to the wall was a logical way to end a season because it pays off Stannis by promising something big next season and provides a plan of action for team Dragonstone. Without it, literally nothing of import happens in Dragonstone that season.Â

Â 
The climax would be the three leeches scene, and ideally Dragonstone wouldn't appear for the rest of the season. But if they do need a follow up scene that's not a big problem. For example Arya's story in S3 clearly climaxed at the RW, but the E10 scene was still a good scene. My projection has Stannis doing nearly as much as he actually did in S3. Changing the climax doesn't change the fact Stannis does virtually nothing.
4795	DaveyJoe	2014-05-21	In my opinion they are trying to make the audience forget.


Â 
But nothing in Stannis' season 4 scenes have indicated that his plans have changed.
4796	King Tommen	2014-05-21	Although in the books they never explicitly stated they were going to the Wall, wasn't the letter that Davos reads a pretty massive hint that was what was going to happen? Especially as it followed the NW sending ravens out to all the Kings in Westeros asking for help.
Â 
Almost like how in the S3 finale, Davos tells Stannis that they can't go to the Wall until he has the men and ships necessary and that he would work on securing those things for him. And then this season, Stannis asks a couple of times what the progress is on this front to Davos. He even says that both he and Davos are running out of time.
Â 
Do they say "remember, we've got to get to the Wall like we said last season"? No. That's obviously by design. It creates the surprise in a different way the books does and is leaving information out on purpose to create this surprise (just as the books do). But on re-watch (or re-read) the audience can see that they were definitely working towards this all along, it just wasn't being made explicitly clear.
Â 
I much prefer this approach to every episode someone mentioning "Man, we better get to the Wall soon like we said we were going to".
4797	DaveyJoe	2014-05-21	No, it's terrible writing because they aren't reminding us why they are building an army!
4798	Seneti	2014-05-21	OOOH GUYS! I know how they'll get around Marillion! They'll say Lysa offed herself! lol


Â 
More likely, Sansa and LF will try to stay as close to the truth as possible (the closer a lie is to the truth, the easier it is to make it sound convincing), i. e. they will say that:
Â 
- Sansa and Robin got into an argument
- Sansa let her temper slip and hit him
- Lysa attacked sansa because of it (here's the first lie, because the fight was not about Robin, but about LF)
- LF came in and tried to separate the two
- in doing so, Lysa tripped, fell and went out the moon door (second lie, because it was not an accident).
Â 
As a matter of fact, the more I think about, the more I believe that Sansa slapping Robin was put in specifically for that reason.
4799	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-21	Dragonstone has been handled very badly post-Blackwater. Doesn't matter if the Stannis arrival is awesome. The lead up to it will always be botched.
4800	King Tommen	2014-05-21	I'll agree with another poster who stated the decision to give 20 episodes to ASoS was going to be beneficial to some storylines and detrimental to others. This is one of the latter.
Â 
This is the sum total of what happens in the books in this storyline in ASoS:

Â 

Â 
1.Davos Seaworth is washed ashore on a rocky island in the Narrow Sea, having been nearly killed in the epic Battle of the Blackwater. He is found by bannermen loyal to Stannis and taken back to Dragonstone. Along the way Davos comes to blame the red priestess Melisandre for Stannis' defeat and resolves to murder her. 
Â 
2. Upon his arrival he is immediately locked up for treason: Melisandre saw his intent in her flames. Melisandre talks to Davos and reveals that Stannis was defeated because she was not at the battle (at his bannermen's request), and asks for Davos simply to be true to his king. She also tells him that there are not seven gods but two: R'hllor, Lord of Light and Fire, and his enemy, the Great Other, Lord of Darkness and Cold, whose war has raged since the dawn of time. 
Â 
3. Stannis releases Davos and asks him to serve as his Hand. Davos agrees and begins to learn to read and write to better fulfill his office. 
Â 
4. Davos meets Edric Storm, one of King Robert's many bastards whom Stannis is keeping safe from the Lannisters. Davos is horrified to learn that Melisandre wants to sacrifice Edric and his royal blood to her fires to awaken the 'stone dragons', which she thinks are the great statues that guard the castle. Stannis rejects this decision and instead gives some of his blood to the fires instead, naming the names of three men that he wants dead: Balon Greyjoy, Joffrey Baratheon and Robb Stark. 
Â 
5.The success of Melisandre's spell has convinced Stannis sacrifice Edric Storm to the flames to wake the dragons. However, Davos smuggles Edric to safety. Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason, but Davos is allowed to read the letter that lately arrived from the Wall. The news stuns Stannis and, more importantly, Melisandre.
Â 

Â 
That's it. For two seasons (or 18 episodes until they arrive at the Wall at the very end of E9).
Â 
So either you sideline these characters for large chunks of both these seasons, making them even more irrelevant than the audience already finds them or you have to come up with some additional material without getting away from what their ultimate destination is going to be at the end of ASoS. I really like the Shireen and Selyse introductions and the way Stannis got to interact with both of them. I like Gendry being used for Edric Storm as it gives the audience a more well-known character to use in that spot and also allowed for Melisandre to share scenes with Thoros and Arya, which I found interesting. And I liked the Iron Bank excursion as both an excuse to see Braavos and a great way to show Davos' value to Stannis and Stannis' complete seething rage and discomfort of having to be in this position.
Â 
So I think for the most part, they did well. There's some stuff there that I wish they'd done differently (like the way Davos is imprisoned and maybe allowing for Stannis and Davos to have a scene or two with friendlier rapport). But the characters are all more or less stuck in isolation at Dragonstone for 18 episodes and there's only so much you can do with that.
Â 
I wasn't enamoured with the storyline as a whole while reading the books until Stannis actually got off his ass and went to the Wall so I'm not surprised that viewers would feel the same way. I do think that by giving us additional material here, the show has given us more insight into the dynamics between Stannis/Mel/Davos/Shireen/Selyse and that should hopefully pay off later.
4801	mothbomb	2014-05-21	Davos seems like a survivor, beyond even Stannis. I think Davos has some role to play in the endgame, he is a good negotiator, hes essentially the Tyrion of the Stannis storyline. Another mutilated broken character who has lost everything but never seems to come across as being a dark character. his crimes of smuggling really seem minor considering the brutality of his punishment. Davos would make a great hand of the king to any faction.
4802	Colonel Green	2014-05-21	More likely, Sansa and LF will try to stay as close to the truth as possible (the closer a lie is to the truth, the easier it is to make it sound convincing), i. e. they will say that:

I don't think that's very likely.Â  As far as explanations goes, that's basically "yeah, I killed her, but it was totally by accident!"Â  Even if they believed him, no way would they leave him in charge.

Â 
It's gotta be suicide as that's the only thing that absolves LF completely and the Lord Declarants would be more inclined to buy this given how crazy they know she is. LF and Sansa just have to come up with a good reason that Lysa would do it. They're both smart kids, I'm sure they'll figure something out.

It's likely, but I do wonder what reason they'll come up with. It's very unlike Lysa to kill herself and leave her son (who is everything to her) behind.

These are all valid points. I understand the difficulty in having to stretch out a character arc that already drags in the books over the course of two seasons, and the need for some added material, I just don't understand the decision to color Stannis in such an overtly negative manner. Some more friendliness with Davos would have helped, but it wouldn't have made up for the burning of "infidels" (The Alester Florent side-plot is a far more nuanced and compelling one) or his desire to execute Davos even after he sees the letter from the Night's Watch (that is until Mel tells him otherwise, which further deprives him of any autonomy). And it's not really just a matter of making Stannis look bad, so much as it is these events that have been, at times, needlessly altered, are a hell of a lot less morally complex than in the novels. The other problem is that Stannis' best dialogue in SoS has been largely cut, or streamlined in a way that makes him seem unambiguously sinister. I mean yeah, if they end up sending Stannis off towards some redemption arc that'll be interesting, but goddamn have they put him through the ringer. I do like the family dynamic, however. I think it's interesting how Shireen has become Stannis' one redeeming quality in the show.Â
4806	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-21	Since so many guys dabating here about Stannis' arrival and if it's gonna be a surprise; that are some posts from the NeoGAF / PTV Unsullied:
Â 

Stannis. Sailing north or south?


I think we're pretty close to seeing Stannis invading King's Landing again and finally becoming king which will be interesting to see if he keeps to his honor or will be influenced by Melisandre (once again similar to real history with the Vatican and other religious figures).


The problem is I want the fight to be decent but don't want it to take up too much because I'm selfish and realize this season is close to ending with a lot of plots still needing to advance in some sort of meaningful way. I mean, Stannis obviously won't be invading while this trial is going on so that means I have to wait even longer for the inevitable invasion and coronation and it's driving me crazy. I want to see if Stannis is going to be the type of king he would have been before he met Melisandre or if he'll be a zealot making things worse because of her. That and we know he's one of the few to worry about the White Walkers meaning we won't see some major action with them until he's king in my opinion. I'm hoping the end of this season has those crazy bastards starting to invade at least.


But the Stannis story is heading somewhere now. I suspect we might see the conclusion of that story arc soon, one way or another. (I'm fairly sure they're heading to King's Landing).


Where are they sailing to? I just don't see anything happening as far as his claim to the throne because even with all the money in braavos and their ships he still only has 4,000 men. Unless they hire sell swords, which I doubt, it's still going to be a while before he attacks.


The timing would be a bit off to be honest, but the way I see, if this invasion of Kings Landing is going to happen it's going to happen by the end of this season. Or else it'd happen at the end of the next season, dragging out over the entire season. I'd like to think that the show writers have heard people's complaints about dragging storylines out and would avoid doing so.


Yeah, I'm prepared for the next episode to be a total emotional rollercoaster. I think Oberyn will beat the Mountain, and it will be an awesome battle. But with all the slow wind going on with Stannis' plot, and Melisandre's conversation with Selyse... I'm half expecting Stannis to bust in un-announced with an army of mercenaries and start indiscriminately slaughtering everyone in sight. But only after Oberyn's triumphant victory over the Mountain. Because that will be the point most people will stop being prepared to lose a favorite character.


Shit, the season tag line, "All men must die" could mean be this. Stannis coming in unannounced and just slaughtering everyone.


It would make sense for Stannis to rally the north around him first then take King's Landing, but then again it's seems blackwater bay is a pretty good place to launch an attack from considering most of his force got wiped out and he still took the beach and breached the walls.


Blackwater Bay again? I don't see it happening unless he uses a two pronged approach. Like you said he would have to rally the north. But how? Payouts? ...


... Saving them from the White Walkers, but that seems like a while away


One minute into the fight the bells will sound throughout King's Landing....Stannis is coming

Â 
I'm very stunned about their preditictions (and have to laugh extremely about them XD) ... But I will admit: It's very, very difficult for me to put myself in Unsullied's shoes, I'm not sure what I'd think if I hadn't read the books... But to everybody who thought "The Unsullied aren't so dumb, they won't forget the scene in 3x10", well, it isn't a thing of forgetting (not only, Imo), it's more a mix of
Â 
- Nobody mentions even one word like "North", "Night's Watch", "Others", "Wildlings" or whatever. And nobody really says where they're heading to this whole season, or how they're going to use their new gold, for what they build again an army
Â 
and
Â 
- Of course all the talk about rights, Stannis' claim mustn't be forgotten, the situation changed after Joffrey's death, the Lannisters (and KL) are getting weaker, Stannis gets more gold/men...
Â 
Well, I think that's how hardcore Unsullied should see it: Stannis is still obsessed with his rights, the fight for the IT seems more important for him, Joffrey's death changed his opinion about their next steps (I agree that doesn't fit to the events of 3x10, but remember: That's how Unsullied sh/could see it, especially if they don't know him well!), and if he has the chance to invade KL and get the throne, why wouldn't somebody as Stannis use this?!... Now, all they have to do is giving these Unsullied a phenomenal ninth episode (and still avoiding every spoiler, e.g. NO Stannis in the Recap and the Preview!) and then the super nice talk with Jon in episode 10, about rights / duties and winning and throne / saving the kingdom and the only enemy/fight that matters, and -> their surprise worked! Â  (IF this will really work, I'll be very satisfied!)
Â 
Especially if these people thinking the ninth episode will be Blackwater 2.0 and Stannis will slaughering a bunch of beloved characters in KL mean this seriously and then he shows up at the Wall in the ninth episode and saves a bunch of beloved people (and the whole realm), I'm looking forward to their reactions! (The people are way to traumatised after 1x09 and 3x09, their panic what will happen this year is somehow cute).
Â 
Â 
I know Unsullied who see his decision how to use his new gold and army now as a decision between KL and the Wall, so you could say KL / his rights / the fight for the IT or The Wall / his duties / the fight for his realm and his people against the only enemy that matters.
When people think he's going to choose invading KL, then they swallowed the red herring and not only episode 9 will surprise them, also Stannis' next actions, decisions, his awesome development, which fits to his coming storyline.
Â 
And Imo, won't any Unsullied say something about terrible writing (especially when the arrival is awesome), rather they'll think they got trolled/confused, but then -when they reflect about the whole sitation- they'll realized that it was The Wall all the time, and they was wrong about Stannis and hopefully begin to see him in another, better, light...

4807	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-21	Here's what I don't understand about Brienne meeting up with LS by the end of the season. We last see Brienne in AFFC meeting with LS. The next time we see her is when she meets with Jaime towards the end of ADWD. Jaime's arc is not nearly as far along as hers is, I assume we won't reach any of his AFFC material until season 5, since he needs to stick around KL until episode 10 for his scene with Tyrion. So what exactly is she going to do all next season?? Were just going to get filler with her all season 5 until she meets up with Jaime? Why not just stick to the story and have her meet LS in season 5? Then the LS reveal can be the same as it was in the epilogue of ASOS to close out this season. Seems so much more neat to me.Â

I'm happy to see this as I've been hoping Stannis's arrival at the wall will come as a complete shock to most viewers. The fact that he has gold now (how much who knows?) could actually make his appearance at the wall even more admirable. He chose to save the kingdom to win the throne. God I hope that line is included in the show.Â
4809	Arkash	2014-05-21	I guess Brienne wont appear next season until episode 8 or 9. They can probably work that out with Gwen's contract and it would be the best thing, imo.
4810	Hath4	2014-05-21	this year they have been willing to leave main characters out of multiple episodes. reek and bran will end up with only 4 appearances. Arya will end up with 6. So I think we will see more of this in season 5.
4811	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-21	I think Brienne+Freys will meet LS in the finale, where Freys get hanged, and we are left to the Season 5 premiere to await Brienne's interrogation by LS. Then she appears only toward the end of Season 5 to whisk Jaime away.
4812	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-21	I guess Brienne wont appear next season until episode 8 or 9. They can probably work that out with Gwen's contract and it would be the best thing, imo.


Yes I suppose if they are going to have her meet up with LS in the finale this would be the best way to handle it. It would certainly be preferable to some filler storyline for most of season 5.Â

Would they really leave a cliffhanger for 8-9 episodes though? Cutting a main character from most of the series is one thing, but LS will be a shock factor and likely cliffhanger (what will happen to Brienne? this applies even if LS doesnt hang her this season)

I think Brienne simply sees Catelyn this finale - she acts horrified and the episode ends. Next season in premiere perhaps the hanging occurs and then she shows up again near the end.
4816	WheelofIceandFire	2014-05-21	I can see Arya (and The Hound) getting about 10 minutes overall in this episode (2 scenes).
Â 
There is a brief clip of The Hound telling her about how 'men kill with steel' as they walk side by side (this is most likely before their fight)
Â 
There are also a few shots of Arya practicing with needle and quicky turning around on a cliff and then a shot of her climbing on aÂ rockÂ (she looks suprised so i am guessing that the Hound gets attacked whilst she is practicing and she reaches him just in time to kill the last attacker)
Â 
I can see her saving his life in this episode before they show up again in the finale and the Hound asks her to give him the gift
4817	Chebyshov	2014-05-21	I think Brienne simply sees Catelyn this finale - she acts horrified and the episode ends. Next season in premiere perhaps the hanging occurs and then she shows up again near the end.


Â 
I think that's very possible. The hanging would be a hell of a long scene to set up in an episode that already has to cram in a lot.

Â 
If Brienne isn't hung until next season, then it could work. Then again, they weren't willing to give Stannis an 8-9 episode cliffhanger this year...

But to everybody who thought "The Unsullied aren't so dumb, they won't forget the scene in 3x10", well, it isn't a thing of forgetting (not only, Imo), it's more a mix of
Â 
- Nobody mentions even one word like "North", "Night's Watch", "Others", "Wildlings" or whatever. And nobody really says where they're heading to this whole season, or how they're going to use their new gold, for what they build again an army
Â 
and
Â 
- Of course all the talk about rights, Stannis' claim mustn't be forgotten, the situation changed after Joffrey's death, the Lannisters (and KL) are getting weaker, Stannis gets more gold/men...
Â 
Well, I think that's how hardcore Unsullied should see it: Stannis is still obsessed with his rights, the fight for the IT seems more important for him, Joffrey's death changed his opinion about their next steps (I agree that doesn't fit to the events of 3x10, but remember: That's how Unsullied sh/could see it, especially if they don't know him well!), and if he has the chance to invade KL and get the throne, why wouldn't somebody as Stannis use this?!... Now, all they have to do is giving these Unsullied a phenomenal ninth episode (and still avoiding every spoiler, e.g. NO Stannis in the Recap and the Preview!) and then the super nice talk with Jon in episode 10, about rights / duties and winning and throne / saving the kingdom and the only enemy/fight that matters, and -> their surprise worked! Â  (IF this will really work, I'll be very satisfied!)
Â 
Especially if these people thinking the ninth episode will be Blackwater 2.0 and Stannis will slaughering a bunch of beloved characters in KL mean this seriously and then he shows up at the Wall in the ninth episode and saves a bunch of beloved people (and the whole realm), I'm looking forward to their reactions! (The people are way to traumatised after 1x09 and 3x09, their panic what will happen this year is somehow cute).
Â 
Â 
I know Unsullied who see his decision how to use his new gold and army now as a decision between KL and the Wall, so you could say KL / his rights / the fight for the IT or The Wall / his duties / the fight for his realm and his people against the only enemy that matters.
When people think he's going to choose invading KL, then they swallowed the red herring and not only episode 9 will surprise them, also Stannis' next actions, decisions, his awesome development, which fits to his coming storyline.
Â 
And Imo, won't any Unsullied say something about terrible writing (especially when the arrival is awesome), rather they'll think they got trolled/confused, but then -when they reflect about the whole sitation- they'll realized that it was The Wall all the time, and they was wrong about Stannis and hopefully begin to see him in another, better, light...


Â 
I think another thing is that the show(and the books) can be unpredictable in many ways. Â So viewers are just making constant predictions and then second guessing themselves. Â Sometimes your imagination just gets carried away while speculating. Â When Stannis saves the wall, viewers won't think it was terrible writing, they will realize that it was spelled out last season and the characters have just been building to this moment.
4821	Konradsmith	2014-05-21	^Indeed. Though really this Stannis spec would be better suited to the ep. nine thread.
Â 
Here'sÂ my two cents, with a large cast you have to sideline characters from time to time. They've gotten better at doing that, especially this season with Bran and Theon's storylines only showing up when they have something to do of interest. They are playing a bit of a game with the Stan writing and trying to make us think he has his eyes on KL now, but that will sell his arrival. It's supposed to be a surprise, so they're making it one. How that's bad writing I don't know. It will also make his decision to go to the Wall more impressive when really he COULD have tried a Blackwater 2.0 if he wanted to now with a great deal more success but he chose not to for the sake of the realm. But as I said, this is really for the other thread.

4822	DaveyJoe	2014-05-21	The solution, of course, is to just make it like the books.
4823	King Tommen	2014-05-21	If it was like the books, Stannis' first appearance this season would be in the last 5 minutes of the ninth episode.

4825	Father of Dragons	2014-05-22	I shall now address those of you who think/hope Oberyn will not die.
First off, you are crazy.
Secondly, Spain has been a confirmed new area for filming to begin for season 5. This is more likely to be Dorne that somewhere Essosi*. Specifically, for those interested, it is in the Andalusia (Southern) region.mif Dorne appears, they will not turn Oberyn into the new Qarth and let him survive.
*However, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of somewhere in Essos at least until the season is done.

Not that it really changes your point, but Spain hasn't been confirmed for shooting. They're just scouting it.

I very stupidly posted that before actually looking at pictures of Andalusia anyway.
Secondly, I am also crazy.
4829	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-22	all this talk of Oberyn surviving reminds me of ADwD and Quentyn....who could have believed or imagined such a sudden end for him...or even Renly for that matter...
Â 
we all love Oberyn and Pedro's performance is so great that we're fooling ourselves in to believing he will survive and we will get to see more of him...
Â 
but this is GRRM's work after all...as they quoted once on the show (believe it was Ramsay) "if your still looking for a happy ending, you really haven't been paying attention"Â
4830	Grayven	2014-05-22	Hopefully, the group can intellectually understand the difference between saying how "something could happen" versus that "something will/should happen". Â

Â 
no offence to anyone, but discussions of things "could" happen that are so drastically different from the book are very odd imo...
Â 
could happen that Jaime never leave KL and decides to help Cersei rule better...i would prefer to see him getting more screen time in KL than with randomz in the riverlands...
Â 
could happen that Ygritte doesn't die at the battle at the Wall and Jon and her carry on a secret romance in Mole's town...i very much enjoyed their scenes together and would like to see more...
Â 
could happen that Arya decides not to go to Bravos and instead tries to find Nymeria...would love to see them back together sooner rather than later...could happen that she takes Nymeria with her to Bravos
Â 
you get my point....toooooo many could's, not worth discussing in terms of the show...at least not so huge changes...
now should's or smaller could's...those are fine...
or even large could's in the thread regarding TWoW or ADoS
4832	Frey Pies	2014-05-22	Anyone else worried that people will start hating on Oberyn because he didn't kill the Mountain when he had the chance and that Tyrion now has to suffer the consequences?

Â 
i hope not...if his death is brutal enough all they should feel is depressionÂ
4834	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-22	Â 
no more Dany for now please! i would like to see -Â 
Â 
5mins of Sansa/LF/Vale
5mins of Cersei/Tywin pre-fight scene, along the lines of "what the fuk do we do if the Viper wins" or "damn, we didnt see that one coming"
5mins of Theon/Ramsay Moat Cailin stuff
5mins of Hound getting weaker or wound festering
10mins of Jon/Sam on top of the wall, laying the gravel and talking about possibilities for strategy when the wildlings attack (they should show some build up of why Sam left Jon would be the best LC even being so young and all) then scene ends with 2 horns, wildlings attacking!Â 
15mins Mountian vs. Viper
Â 
i'm probably setting myself up for disappointment, but that is what would make me...if the Mountain vs. Viper (not just the fight but stuff leading up to it as well) is not at least 10 mins, will be really disappointed...and the actually fight should not be quick or sudden...i wana see them really going at each other...wana see Oberyn reaaaally toying with him...


Â 
sorry to quote myself but just found this HBO synopsis -Â 
Â 
"Moleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Town receives unexpected visitors. Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s motives are questioned. Ramsay attempts to prove himself to his father. Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fate is decided."
Â 
build up for the battle
LFÂ maneuvering himself as acting lord of the vale
moat cailinÂ 
awesomenessÂ  Â 
Â 
â<U+0080><U+008B>so maybe 5mins of jon/sam andÂ 10mins of arya hound?
and no 5 mins Cersei/Tywin but 10 mins of moat cailin?Â 
Â 
thoughts? predictions?Â
4835	Seneti	2014-05-22	Since so many guys dabating here about Stannis' arrival and if it's gonna be a surprise; that are some posts from the NeoGAF / PTV Unsullied:
Â 
[snip]


Â 
Thanks for collecting those quotes! I hope people will put up lots of reaction vids for the last three episodes.
Â 


Here's what I don't understand about Brienne meeting up with LS by the end of the season. We last see Brienne in AFFC meeting with LS. The next time we see her is when she meets with Jaime towards the end of ADWD. Jaime's arc is not nearly as far along as hers is, I assume we won't reach any of his AFFC material until season 5, since he needs to stick around KL until episode 10 for his scene with Tyrion. So what exactly is she going to do all next season?? Were just going to get filler with her all season 5 until she meets up with Jaime? Why not just stick to the story and have her meet LS in season 5? Then the LS reveal can be the same as it was in the epilogue of ASOS to close out this season. Seems so much more neat to me.Â 


Â 
Well, either they do this:
Â 


I think Brienne+Freys will meet LS in the finale, where Freys get hanged, and we are left to the Season 5 premiere to await Brienne's interrogation by LS. Then she appears only toward the end of Season 5 to whisk Jaime away.


Â 
Or they shorten Jaime's travelogue. I think it's going to be a combination of both.
Â 


Anyone else worried that people will start hating on Oberyn because he didn't kill the Mountain when he had the chance and that Tyrion now has to suffer the consequences?


Â 
Not at all. From everything I've read in the "What your unsullied friends/families think" thread, Oberyn has become the new Ned. They love him, they cheer for him and they will be heartbroken (doubly so because one favourite character dies and another favourite character now seems doomed).
4836	Vivianne	2014-05-22	Â

Right? I keep seeing multiple predictions where Brienne And The hound show up at the Vale wtf?
4837	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-22	^Well tbf they are both heading to the Vale, apparently, even though I agree that having them meet would be problematic.
4838	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-22	18 minutes for King's Landing (3 scenes - Tywin/Cersei, Oberyn/Tyrion, Oberyn/Mountain)
10 minutes for Arya/Hound (1 or 2 scenes, an extra one if they get as far as her abandoning the Hound)
8 minutes for Moat Cailin (I think this will all be 1 sequence)
8 minutes for Night's Watch/Wildlings (at least 3 scenes: Mole's Town, Sam/Jon, Jon warning brothers)
6 minutes for Sansa (2 back-to-back scenes: Sansa getting coached, Sansa lying)
3 minutes for Dany (one or two scenes: Missandei bathing?)
Â 
sounds about right to me

4839	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-05-22	I haven't read this far in the books so I don't know who is supposed to go where when and all that. I have enjoyed this season but... I have to confess to being one of those who feels Stannis' actions aren't getting enough explanation. He gets the letter from the NW - and then the letter isn't mentioned again. I finally figured out the money he wanted from the Iron Bank was for an army, but didn't know if it were for the Wall or King's Landing. It would be strange to have an invasion during the trial and that one reason is what led me to Stannis headed to the Wall.
Â 
As a semi-Unsullied I would have appreciated a little more clarification but not if it goes against what is in the books. I do believe in remaining somewhat true to source material.
Â 
As to the Oberyn/Mountain storyline - I too would love for Oberyn to survive, but that owes to the fabulous performance of the actor. When awards season rolls around again, how will anyone be able to forget that scene? Well written, well delivered, no flaws - just two amazing actors. I tear up each time I hear "But what about what I want?"Â 
Â 
Personally right now I am eager for Tyrion escapades and the death of lying whores (and cruel fathers!). Knowing the outcome doesn't change the experience, which is the hallmark of a great adaptation. As I discovered with "Lord of the Rings", so many times the directors and writers seem to have reached into my head and pulled my imagination straight out.
4840	Arkash	2014-05-22	18 minutes for King's Landing (3 scenes - Tywin/Cersei, Oberyn/Tyrion, Oberyn/Mountain)

Â 
I hope for 10 minutes of the Wall storyline but I think you're right.
Â 
There's still the possibility of Brienne and Pod appearing this episode, but that's really a wild card.

4842	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-22	Wonder what's gonna happen to Gilly. Â Does she just wander back to The Wall after Moles Town is raided?
4843	Arkash	2014-05-22	^ Most logicaly and probably. I hold hope that she is the one to warn the Wall, although Jon and Sam will also spot it burning from top of the Wall.

4844	~No One~	2014-05-22	^You'd think someone would have warned them that a bunch of Wildlings are on their way...they had time to go to Craster's, but couldn't do a quick run to Mole's Town?

Â 
So Sam will probably think Gilly didn't make it, then all of a sudden there she is at the Wall?
4846	Arkash	2014-05-22	Yeah, more or less I think something like that happens.
Â 
Or she's taken captive by the Wildling since she's one of them and escapes or is rescued during the battle (maybe by Sam). In either case, I think we'll have some Gilly action in the next episodes.
4847	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-22	Â 
So Sam will probably think Gilly didn't make it, then all of a sudden there she is at the Wall?


Well Sam was crying in the preview. So at some point he must surely think Gilly has died in the raid. My own guess is that we wont know she survived, but she will show up again in Episode 9, either by herself (having fled from Mole Town) or as a captive of the Wildlings.
4848	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-22	About that, can anyone explain to me the point of having her in Moletown in the first place ?

So he decided to take her to a super dingy, "breathe and you'll get STDs"Â brothel instead. Makes sense.

Â 
At Mole's Town there are women who will willingly have sex with men of the Night's Watch, Gilly is much less likely to be raped there than on the Wall where she is the only woman.
4853	Arkash	2014-05-22	Because the writers wanted to introduce Mole's Town brothels since it is a fairly important part of the Watch's life and it adds some emotions to the Sam / Gilly relationship.
4854	Konradsmith	2014-05-22	And they wanted to raise the stakes for the attack there. So they put Gilly in somewhat ham-handedly but I imagine it will be a cool sequence anyhow. And people will give somewhat more of a shit about what's happening because Gilly's there.

Â 
imo, these go from "could's" to crackpot theories pretty quick....
Â 
Hound meets up with Brienne who will bite off his good ear and that is how he will die and Arya gets mad and stabs Pod and runs away to Bravos in the confusion while Brienne is grieving over Pod's body...then she gets mad and starts seeking Arya as revenge and runs in to LSH who reminds her of her oath so she decides to leave Arya be and gets Jaime for LSH...
Â 
there is a perfectly sound "could happen" on the show...but i'm sure you all see why we are no GRRM's or D&D's...Â
4856	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-22	^Fair points, y'all. Still think it was weird, though.
Â 
Re. Brienne and the Hound :Â  I think it would be very tempting for the writers to have them meet up : they seem quite eager on the "let's have people who've never/barely met in the books talk" front and both those characters parallel each other quite a bit.
However, it's probably too much of a risk , on many levels, so my guess is they'll have a "near meeting" A  la Jon/Bran.
4857	Konradsmith	2014-05-22	I just rewatched the costumes feature from a month or two ago and in it we see Brienne on a mountainy area where she shot in Iceland. Also she says that she just shot a fight in her new armour. I amÂ still holding out forÂ her fighting Freys and then the BWB business unfoldingÂ but I don't know what Freys would be doing in the Vale.

Yep I'm thinking the sole purpose is to create a dramatic scene where Sam believes her to be dead.Â
4865	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-22	About that, can anyone explain to me the point of having her in Moletown in the first place ?


Â 
other than the suggestions by the others, no point, fear of rape etc...i think their plan for that is that
Gilly will escape when the wildlings attack and she's the one who brings word to the Wall about Mance's army being that close...
similar to the kid coming to warn them about Tormund and Ygritte...
Â 
this leads me to think show!Sam might be the one to suggest to Jon to send her away later with the baby...will be odd
4866	Chebyshov	2014-05-22	I don't think Gilly will die either, but I'm kind of confused about her plot purpose? To help with Sam's characterization? Her point in the books is to be a wetnurse to Mance Jr, and I don't see that being thrown in.
4867	Konradsmith	2014-05-22	^Well according to some theories, the point of her is to get one of Craster's sons to the Wall. I guess they won't have the baby switchÂ  (Mance hasn't shown up yet and I doubt they'll establish his havingÂ a preggo wife and all in ep. 409) so I can't see how they'd get the infant to stay there though.

I bet someone will say to you it's too late for resurrection but is it?....Stoneheart is supposed to be messed up and they don't follow the book in so many aspects, why would they with 3 day thing?

They'll need to do something - she has no scratches in the show.

Blue would probably make the audience confused, so how about freaky, discolored eyes? She needs to look creepy.

4875	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-22	I bet someone will say to you it's too late for resurrection but is it?....Stoneheart is supposed to be messed up and they don't follow the book in so many aspects, why would they with 3 day thing?
Â 
Though I think we do see her revived, up and about, hanging people. If they wanted to show the resurrection they would have last year.


Â 
i thought about that too, supposed to have been soon after RW or was it PW? but ya, might say its too late...but nothings been established that resurrection has to happen in 3 days...all they confirmed is cant bring a man who lost his head...so still have hopes! Â

They'll need to do something - she has no scratches in the show.
Â 
Blue would probably make the audience confused, so how about freaky, discolored eyes? She needs to look creepy.


I think having her very pale, with a gruesome throat injury would be enough. The wouldn't take the risk to have her too corny-looking.

Besides, if they do bring Michelle in as Lady Stoneheart (which I am.still hoping for) they are limited with what they can do creepiness wise
The bright blue eyes just screams "The Others" which Beric and Lady Stoneheart obviously arent the same as. Especially with Beric not having.such eyes.

Yeah initially I was like ' no, come on too late', but hell, they changed so much stuff and this is detail. In the books in 3 days after RW. I'm not sure how much time from RW passed till now in the show but she surely wouldn't be completely decomposed. And it's fantasy show, so...who knows:)

I like this one - http://37.media.tumb...c1zu7o1_500.png - it has scratches but the eyes thing is nice, creepy

They should do something with the hair too. Her hair was such a distinctive feature.

I don't think they can do it without Michelle. The audience has to recognize her the moment they see her and Stoneheart is not that unrecognizable from Catelyn, certainly not to the point they'd need another actress.

floaters decompose at a slower rate ... hows that?Â  
Â 
i dont wana just see her all revived and riding around with Bw/oB like in the books...since they cant show Brienne/LS now and UnCat is very strongly rumored to have shot a scene this season, this would be the best way imo...watching her randomly riding around all revived and shit isnt as dramatic

Well for me it would be dramatic enough, I'm so messed up - on one hand I just cannot wait to see how they show her in the series, on another I had bad dreams after that epilogue and I'm probably gonna be watching that final scene while covering myself with the blanket  But I do think we see her walking around, otherwise they wouldn't speed up/change Brienne's journey so much.

4886	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	quiproquo ? The Hound thinks she's hunting the girls for the Lannisters (Oathkeeper, Lannister belt, etc..), and she thinks he means to harm them (she doesn't know him and he has a pretty dreadful reputation)But what would be the point? Why tear down what they built up over several seasons (that both are Team Stark)? Misunderstandings happen, but what story does that tell?It would be a better story for them to fight on the same side, or better yet, not meet at all. We already saw what happens when story worlds collide when Jaime and Brienne came home too early.

Maybe she stays? Sorry, Sam. Those were some fun boat times.
This is what I think. Surely Sam doesn't need to drag lover and baby all the way to Oldtown. He will have Aemon, I think, til he passes on, & that should be enough. If it happens this way, (& I am one who believes in a REASON for the last Craster baby to mean something), then Sam & Gilly will probably become lovers before Sam heads out on his mission for Jon. The memories will have to tide him over.

4888	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-22	I think the purpose of Gilly in Mole's Town is to bring her and Sam closer together. They're likely gonna kiss once he sees her again, if the first few seconds of the Foreshadowing video are anything to go by. Sets up their little romance next season.
Â 
As for LS... I'll be really disappointed if we don't get a hanged Frey as foreshadowing.

4889	Konradsmith	2014-05-22	I do wonder why they're having Brienne getting as far as the Vale. I doubt they'll have her and the Hound fight (despite how awesome that would be to the "could x beat y" sort of fans), but I'm still curious why they'd have her get so near them, especially if she's going to run into the BWB by episode ten.
Â 
The Hound story will end like it does in ASOS though or else they wouldn't have had him say "that's where the heart is" in last episode.

4890	DaveyJoe	2014-05-22	It's also interesting to note that he's saying "that's how you kill a man" right before Biter nips him in the shoulder.
4891	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-22	If Arya and the Hound are in the Vale by now,.will she leave from Gulltown rather than Duskendale?
4892	Colonel Green	2014-05-22	If Arya and the Hound are in the Vale by now,.will she leave from Gulltown rather than Duskendale?


The way the show is handling the geography of the Bloody Gate is confusing, but Arya is still closer to Saltpans than to Gulltown.Â  Not that it really matters either way.

4894	Seneti	2014-05-23	About that, can anyone explain to me the point of having her in Moletown in the first place ?


Â 
1) because there are lots of former rapists at the Wall, so a place with lots of women would be "safer" and
2) because Sam didn't know about the Wildling approach from the South (at least that's what I gathered from his last conversation with Jon where he was basically like "WTH, Jon, why didn't you tell me about this - I just send Gilly to Molestown")
4895	Natasi	2014-05-23	I wonder what else they have in store for Brienne, since Biter is dead? Instead of the cheek biting? Maybe just a cut.
I've wondered the same. Though, in the book I felt it was unnecessary for her to suffer such a disfiguring injury. She's already famed for her homely looks and receives criticism from everyone for it... What plot /character development can arise from worsening this? I think the show will just have her be grievously wounded in some other way. Tyrion got to keep his nose, afterall.

Well imo, her injuries in the books serve two purposes.
1) Just because you are a great and honourable fighter, doesn't mean you are immune to injury and dirty tricks in a fight (Biter wasn't actually fighting her if you recall, he took her by surprise after she killed Rorge). The life of a knight is not all shiny armour, tourneys and gallant acts. I feel that Martin wants to show that in his books. Life is not a story, as Littlefinger would say.
2) The injuries that Brienne gets in her fights (iirc she is also hurt slighfly at the Whispers) are further nods to her possible descent from Dunk, who was also somewhat unlucky when he got into scraps (though he eventually wins his fights, as Brienne does)
In the show however, its not really necessary. They have already made it so that Brienne isn't "freakishly ugly" as in the book (Christie is very pretty imo) so I am doubtful they add lasting disfigurement. Just look at Tyrion's nose and you will catch my.meaning.

If the facial injury happens to be important later on, they can just give her a scar like they did with Tyrion. No need to have horribly disfigured.

Â 
i'm with you on this....the budget for this show is sky high already, no real need for even more makeup/CGI for facial injuries for Brienne...though it was a bit disappointing to see Tyrion's nose i remember the show making a nice excuse, cersei looking at him and saying "they made it sound much worse than it is" i thought that was a clever way for the show to get out of extra costs...

having said that....LS needs to be disfigured for sure...at least something like Berric's...she's not gona have much screentime for now anyway, they should spring for serious injuries....without them, the creepy effect would go down significantlyÂ

It could have been had it not been canceled, but they had to cram a large amount of history into a very small amount of episodes during season 2. It felt rushed for that reason. I whole heartedly agree about Polly Walker. Kevin McKidd would be my personal choice for Jon Connington, though from what he's said in interviews he'll never be apart of GoT because he's bitter about Rome being canceled.

I'm currently watching it right now. I'm on episode 4 of Season 2. I love it so far. Too bad they didn't have more seasons, it is getting really good. It's cool to see Edmure Tully, Ellaria Sand, and Mance Rayder in their roles. My GF was like, "hey! that's that goofy dude, who married the pretty Frey girl." lolÂ

Alright, I'll try distracting myself from my immense sorrow by predicting how the episode will go down:
Â 
- Sansa confession scene with Littlefinger (4 min)
- Follow-up Sansa scene (the order can be swapped) (3 min)Â 
- Cersei and Tywin short scene (Tywin asking Cersei to withdraw the claims- "I'll burn my house to the ground") (3 min)
- Mole's Town attack (3 min)
- Ramsay tells Theon to go take Moat Cailin (long, single sequence) (8 min)
- Danaerys bath scene (maybe end with her getting a letter) (4 min)
- Arya and the Hound fight the Knight at the Vale (4 min)
- Arya leaves the Hound (4 min)
- Gilly escapes and arrives at Castle Black, informs about the wildlings. Jon looks beyond the wall and notices the wildlings are there. (5 min)
- Tyrion, Oberyn conversation (3 min)
- Trial by combat! (12 min)

05-Small Council, Oberyn announces as Tyrion's champion
06-Mole's Town attack

08-The Wall
09-Moat Cailin

That's a little too long for the trial, I think. Doubt the fight will last longer than five minutes. And two or three minutes for before the fight (setting the scene and getting the combatants into place). So seven or eight minutes total. Give some time to the second Hound scene, lol, it needs more weight. It's his final one.
4921	KeeperOfOaths	2014-05-24	How long is this episode anyway? There was a thread, I think, with the duration of all episodes, but I don't seem to find it. Could you help, please?
Â 
I think in the promo we hear Tyrion asking someone if he/she thinks that Oberyn could win. With whom do you guys think he is talking? Jaime? I haven't seen you specualtions wether Jaime is in this episode or not.Â 
Â 
As regards Brienne, I see that almost all of you are positive that Brienne meets LS in this season. For me it doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and I think it works worse this way than eNding the season with a scene of the Brotherhood talking and then suddenly the woman appearing, removing her cloak and BANG!!!! I may be mistaken, of course. I was also sure that Bronn will go with Jaime to the Riverlands and look how this one has turned out.
Â 
But if Brienne meets LS this season, we will havd one dramatic and climatic moment. If we see LS first this season, in the last scene os this season, we will have one hell of a dramatic moment now. And then when Brienne meets LS in season 5, we will have another dramatic moment. I think it works much better this way.
Â 
Plus the fact that if Brienne meets LS this season, there will be almost nothing for her to do in season 5, just a couple of epiosdes, because Jaime will need probably the most of season 5 to get to the point of meeting Brienne.
Â 
Plus the fact that Brienne must warm up more to Pod, in order to reach that level of emotionality required for the whole Brienne&/Jaime/Pod thing.
Â 
Plus the fact that they need to show Brienne thinking of Jaime etc, in order to reach that level of emotionality etc...
Â 
Besides, there are far too many events in this season..Thery need to leave something for next season, as well.
Â 
I would vote for this season to end with the Brotherhood talking about how Beric died etc, talking about LS, and then showing her, removing her cloack, and the season ending with the terrible, cruel image of her! The biggest suprise ever!!!
4922	ladyinblack	2014-05-24	I really do not see any reason why the Moat  Cailin scene should be any different than the books. i do not think it's too gruesome for the show to show the aftermath of the ironborn tied to poles flayed. the show has done more graphic things in the past.

It's the perfectly sensible thing to do given the situation. It's the NW leadership that looks like idiots for not taking his advice. Their response to Jon saying the Giants will ram through the gates is that "the gates are strong". So we know how that's going to go.

4930	Lord Carson	2014-05-24	Ok , now I'm scared . I was watching the trailers and this new mountain doesn't look promising at all . I mean in most of the scenes only his hands are moving and other body parts are just staying where they are ! take a look :

He's a huge dude with a huge sword fighting a guy with a spear. As long as his sword is in the right place, he doesn't really need to move much else. It looks like that's the beginning of the fight since he still has a helm, so I think it's just showing how confident he is and how easy the fight's going for him until Oberyn starts getting more crafty.

I really hope that you're right . In a few of 'em he did look actually good but well only in like 5 percent of those scenes .
All a man can do now is to hope !
4932	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-24	Â 
It's the perfectly sensible thing to do given the situation. It's the NW leadership that looks like idiots for not taking his advice. Their response to Jon saying the Giants will ram through the gates is that "the gates are strong". So we know how that's going to go.


Might be my timeline is all messed up. Is it discussed before the battle or after in the books ? My memory's hazy atm.

Â 
It's discussed in an entirely different context (i.e. well after the battle). When Marsh suggests it then, there is no imminent battle where the forces at CB are hopelessly outnumbered. So Jon is right in saying at that time that it's not the right strategy.
The way the show has set up this battle (Mance's army of 100,000 coming down on a ragtag group of 100 NW men), hunkering down and taking out the only real means Mance's army has of gaining entrance en masse makes a lot of sense.Â  Thorne's retort that it wouldn't allow them to easily go out ranging after the battle is magically won as well as the fact the bars on the gates are strong enough to hold off the giants is ridiculous.Â  Jon (and the audience) knows that it's just a matter of time before the tunnels will be breached.Â  If Stannis doesn't end up showing up, that's exactly what would have happened (in the books and the show).Â  So taking that extreme action is incredibly justified as will be proven to the audience in E9 once Mance's army shows up.
Â 
The whole scene is there to demonstrate the old guard NW are arrogant and unwilling to recognize the real threat while Jon (having experienced what he has North of the Wall and with the wildlings) knows exactly what's coming and the best way to defend against it.
4936	Arrowtic	2014-05-24	expecting motion in still shots doe?


No , expecting good poses in still shots(look at Oberyn) . All those stills are from trailers , just watch 'em to see what I meant .
4937	King Tommen	2014-05-24	There's an interview that was posted recently that stated Mountain 3.0 was hired specifically because for a big man, he can still move very well. Thor has a basketball background.

4938	Father of Dragons	2014-05-24	I doubt that at the Wall, Jon and Sam will see the "southern" wildlings charging, 'cause it'd be stupid to have the full episode be just the battle and no real preparation like in "Blackwater". We know the battles on both sides are simultaneous, and while the shots of the south are at night and the shots of the north are early morning, it wouldn't make sense to have a battle - prepare for the second while watching Jon grieve - then have the second battle. Also, Tormund will wait for Mance to "light the biggest fire the North has ever seen!"
I found it odd last year that Mance said that then just disappeared with no mention of where exactly he was going or giving any hints to attack other than a big fire.
4939	aussiegirl	2014-05-25	I really really hope that this is the last episode forÂ the Hound, at least for this season. IÂ wasn't a fan of this part of his story in the books but I amÂ tiring of him now.
Â 
It is funny that he accused Polliver of being a talkerÂ in the first ep because the Hound can't actually stop talking.
Â 
I would love it if they have him doing his delusional ranting and Arya just looks at himÂ with that magnificent dead eye look that Maisie does and then starts saying:
Â 
'You're a talker. Talkers make me thirsty. And hungry.'
4940	WexPyke	2014-05-25	If the Mountain and the Viper fights ends next week in this episode, how far will they go?Â  Will the Mountain die too? Will the escape be set up?
4941	aussiegirl	2014-05-25	Pykewex, originally the Mountain was slated to be in three episodes. If that is still the case, he might be in episode 10.
Â 
Unless he was meant to be in 6, 7 & 8 and they cut him out of 6 for some reason.
4942	~No One~	2014-05-25	^If they end with the fight, ep. 10 will likely have some fallout from the battle, just as happened with Joffrey. Maybe even some Qyburn action, to set things up for next season?
4943	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-25	^Yes they might show that he 1) is still alive 2) has been poisoned by Oberyn 3) is going to be the subject of Qyburn's experimentations.

Despite Stannis always saying "Ser Davos", the fact that Shireen called him the Onion Knight twice is a good enough reason for the Unsullied to just say that. Not a single non-book reader I know actually calls him "Davos".

My m-i-l and sister haven't read the book, and one of the biggest problems they have is keeping track of all of the characters. That's why it kills me when book readers complain when little or unimportant characters are cut out, because the show is already so filled with them that non-book readers need a chart to keep up with who's whom. My m-i-l calls me after each episode so that I can help her get everything straight that happened in the episode.

I tried starting a thread asking what was going on in the General GoT forum, but apparently was not approved by the mods. Maybe I was posting in the wrong forum, or it's against the forum rules, or whatever; it's probably the same thing as last year: holiday day in the USA, so they skip a sunday to avoid a low rating in such an expected episode.
Â 
I'm ok with it, but I think it's pretty lame from HBO not informing this. In the guide it is listed as if today we are getting an episode, and I surely didn't notice the date change in last sunday promo (if they showed it).

What makes you think 'child bones' will happen in episode eight and not ten?
4967	Konradsmith	2014-05-26	^Well, maybe the bones being presented will be in episode ten but the attack itself will be in eight, I think. We know that there's a scene of Missandei and others bathing outdoors in episode eight and since episode eight will be packed with important scenes, I can't see them showing a scene of nudity for its own sake unless it cuts to something else important happening nearby. It looks as though they'll be giving generous screentime to King's Landing, Moat Caillin andÂ the ValeÂ (with both Stark sisters' storylines) in this episode. When we drop by Meereen I assume it will be for something important. The two major things they have to doÂ in that part of the worldÂ before the season ends are the dragons' chaining and the banishing of Jorah. Since they only have two episodes in which to do this, I imagine we'll get touches of both in episodes eight and ten.

4968	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-26	^I figured that, since they'd already shown Drogon roasting that goat, they would make the child's death happen off-screen, but your argument makes sense.
4969	Konradsmith	2014-05-26	^The only reason I think it will be onscreen is because the bathing funny business would be a pretty good lead-in to it. A pretty strong contrast between a lighter scene outside Meereen into a more horrifying one. Of course I could be very wrong.
Â 
However it plays out, I can't wait for the Goatherd to confront Dany (that's Goatherd number 2, not the one we already saw in episode six). There was an interview with Darren Kent who plays him that came out in theÂ fallÂ and he said that the whole crew was crying after the scene. Whether its in this episode or ten, I imagine that Dany assumes his goats were killed and gives him the same offer (to be repaid three times over) that she gave the previous goatherd. Then he'll unveil the bones and say "how can you repay me my daughter three times over?"
Â 
I wonder if they'll have him speak English/the Common tongue to make the scene more powerful. (Though I doubt a Meereenese goatherd would somehow know it, they have no reason to after all).

Yeah, there's quite a lot to cover in Dany's storyline if it has to end with Jorah's banishment and the chaining of the dragons, and they only have two episodes.

Â 
I love that idea! Would make for an awesome scene Â 
Â 
I think that another possibility could be, however, that she is in the lake, and then a messenger comes in with a letter from Tywin telling her about Jorah. Her scene could end with an angered expression her face. I prefer your idea, but I think that there might not be enough time to set-up Jorah's betrayal if they don't go down that road. Also, they're going to have an awesome dragon scene in the finale anyways, so they might ignore this one.Â
4972	Konradsmith	2014-05-26	^Either way, I will never complain about the gratuitousness about such a scene featuring Nathalie Emmanuel. She is STUNNING.
Â 
I do wonder how the Tywin meddling with Dany's court will play out. Taking the info to her would be interesting. It'll be great to see one last destructive political move from Tywin before he bites the dust. Even in his death throws he's soÂ good at fucking people over. Since he's doing it through Varys, I wonder how much this will throw off the Spider's plans regarding Dany. Or if we'll get any inkling of what those might be through how this Meereen intrigue plays out.

Â 
Scene in 0408: Dany and Missandei in the lake, Tywin's letter arrives (I think Tywin's letter was a great idea, as, finally, we see a bit of connectivity between the two storylines).Â 
Â 
Scene 1 in 0410: Dany calls Jorah for questioning, banishes him.
Â 
Scene 2 in 0410: Continuation of scene 1. The court is set in order after the banishment, and Hazzea comes in with more bones. Dany says that she's not in the mood to deal with frivolities like goats. He says it's not a goat and presents the bones. Ash-stricken look on Dany's face.
Â 
Scene 3 in 0410: Epic lock-up of the dragons, as Drogon escapes. Dany's arc wrapped up for the season.
4974	Konradsmith	2014-05-26	^They'll have to do it concise like that since they've left all of this until now. I'm not sure how much of all of that will be in episode eight and how much will be in ten, but that looks like a very realistic rundown of what we're getting.
4975	boojam	2014-05-26	No episode today WTF!!!Someone on this thread should mention this is all the fall out of season 2 ep. 9, The Blackwater.The show was on a steady climb in viewer ship season 2 then Blackwater (the most anticipated and praised episode of season2) was shown on Memorial Day (a USA Federal holiday) weekend. The graph (it is kept on Wikipedia) of the first showing on Sunday in 2012 shows a drop of ~ half a million viewers.That (we never got official word) stung! HBO, so season 3 skipped Memorial Day weekend in 2013.Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a bit of a puzzle to me, even if it makes sense that people may not be at homeâ<U+0080>¦ because from the buzz and word of mouth I heard that week viewers must (may ) tuned in , in record numbers for the rest of the showings. But the graph only shows numbers for the first night. Interestingly S2 E10 added ~ 1 million viewers of the show, in fact the first time the show broke 4 million. I think that was all on the strength of episode 9. Looks like we are stuck with this â<U+0080>skip Memorial Dayâ<U+0080><U+0099> weekend thing till the end of days!

4979	Father of Dragons	2014-05-26	In the promo, Theon's line is:
"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon."
Now, if you listen carefully, it does sound like there should be more to what he says, but it is cut out. Now, if they couldn't have him say everything, for whatever reason, why should they choose to include "Son of Balon"? I think this hints that Theon will arrive at the Moat, be told that Balon is dead, and that both Victarion* and Yara have both sailed back to the Iron Islands, rather than Yara receiving the news.
*Assuming that they keep him, of course
4980	Tyrion1991	2014-05-26	lol
Â 
They probably won't do it but I may as well suggest it.
Â 
What if the bathing scene with Missandei leads to Jorah kissing Dany, except rather than simply cutting like it does in the books when he says hes the most loyal man ever, Barristan comes in with the letter from Tywin and then we roll into the "dam you Selmy" bit in ASOS with Dany in a state of disbelief. Then in episode 10 we rap up him being formally banished.
Â 
I just can't understand what could be achieved having a bathing scene with Missandei and Daenerys. This feels like something that should have came earlier in the season to build Missandei as a character or explain Danys feelings about Daario/Jorah with somebody she can trust. Feels very late in the season when everything in most stories should be going at a frenetic pace. Unless, nudity as somebody mentioned before.Â 
Â 
I don't think it can be the dragons because she has to be in her throne room and we need to be as surprised as her so I doubt we will see the dragonattack. But we will see the childs bones. So this would be later I assume.Â 
Â 
I really hope they don't make it Jorahs advice to chain the dragons. The show really is making him the fall guy for Danys ADWD mistakes and its just going to create a problem of why shes still following his advice to stay in Meereen, learn to be a good peaceful Queen and keep her dragons chained; after shes exiled him for being a traitor... Which is why I am convinced/hope the dragon reveal will be AFTER Jorah is exiled.
Â 
Â 
Why has the promo not shown more of Danys scenes? Either that means its just a short cosy scene with Missandei, or they can't show the scene without giving too much away.
Â 
BTW has it been 100% confirmed by HBO that all of episode 9 is being spent at the wall?

Â 
I am not 100% convinced that the Missandei bathing scene is supposed to turn out in the attack of Drogon. It could and I'd like it but I wonder if the purpose of the bathing scene aint only to develop Grey Worm / Missandei romance ?
Â 
And then, even that could happen : romance between the two, Drogon shows up, roasts Missandei or Grey Worm (I'd hate for that to happen but we know the show is not shy on killing characters that are still alive in the books).
Â 
Â 

BTW has it been 100% confirmed by HBO that all of episode 9 is being spent at the wall?

Â 
More or less. The synopsis refers only to the batlle, it's a Neil Marshall-like episode, they wanted to top Blackwater, the title is explicit and some people (Hannah Murray) have confirmed an episode will entirely take place at the Wall.

4982	Tyrion1991	2014-05-26	Well then odds are that Danys parts in episode 8 will either address Jorahs exile or the dragons. Unless a big chunk of episode 10 is dedicated to Daenerys I can't see them handling both the dragons and his exile. Â 
Â 
IMO it makes much more sense to exile Jorah before she has to make any decision on what to do with the dragons. The show seems to have wanted to have portray their version of the character as the smart voice of reason so exiling him before this crisis with the dragons makes sense.Â

Â 
I think they will set-up the scene this episode, but have it in the finale. I do think Dany will get at least 10-12 minutes in the finale, seeing how important of a character she, and due to it being 66 minutes long. I expect Dany and Tyrion to have the most screentime, with scenes that follow one-another instead of being dispersed throughout the episode.
4984	boojam	2014-05-26	BTW has it been 100% confirmed by HBO that all of episode 9 is being spent at the wall?From the interview Neil Marshall gave (I only saw that one) he did not mention being anywhere than Belfast. I am going to say it is 100% Wall , I am 100% convinced. It is one of the last most important chapters in SoS.. itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s on page unlike Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s conquests of Yunkai and Meereen which were told in flashback on page (those were actual battles in the books, not clever end runs as in the showâ<U+0080>¦ but thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ok). It should be interesting since Marshall was not contracted on short notice this time and put a lot of time and effort into episode 9.Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not that Marshall could not do a full multi-sequence episode after all he has made a 4 feature films and is working on 2 more. I can say he does do very good Action work, but, I have seen all his feature films and well he may be a work in process because those theatrical films were 60%-ersâ<U+0080>¦ not awful but nothing to write home about. I have not seen his other TV work, he did do two Black Sails.

Â 
Twelve minutes doesn't feel like enough time. I imagine the caging of the dragons and Dany going to visit them under the pyramid will be quite lengthy scenes without having to add her exiling Jorah in as well. I suppose her exiling Jorah could immediately follow with her finding out about the petitioner with the bones but I think that would just detract from Jorahs exile as we would be rapidly switching focus to the dragons. Be a bit like "and now for something completely different".Â 
Â 
I think it makes more sense for him to be exiled and gone in 8. Then have Dany see the bones and react to the dragons in episode 10. More or less guaranteed that the season ends with Dany turning her back on her dragons and sealing them in the pit IMO.
4987	sati	2014-05-26	I think it would be strange to have such a big scene with the characters who have been in one story since 1x01 separating happen before finale.
Â 
On the other hand please God no more than 12 minutes of Dany in finale.
4988	King Tommen	2014-05-26	12 minutes is a long time. I know it doesn't seem that way, but it is.
Â 
Just for reference, Tyrion's trial, which includes Tyrion being led into the throne room, hearing the testimony from Trant, Pycelle, Cersei and Varys, the recess where Jaime talks to Tywin, Shae's testimony and finally,Tyrion's speech takes roughly 14 minutes total.

Â 
Even if they give it 15 minutes total (which I don't think they will), that still leaves plenty of time for the rest.
Â 
An entire episode worth of screentime is left for everything else. I don't imagine Arya, Sansa and Reek taking too long.Â

4990	boojam	2014-05-26	On the other hand please God no more than 12 minutes of Dany in finale.If it locking up the two dragons and dealing with 'ornory Drogon, it will be worth it.
4991	Tyrion1991	2014-05-26	So you think episode 10 Dany will be
Â 
- Start in throne room Jorah exiled
Â 
- He taken out, bones brought in. Dany distraught.
Â 
- Dany leads Viserion to cage. He screams.
Â 
- Unsullied rush Rhaegal and Drogon. One captured, the other flees.
Â 
- Dany goes to meet dragons and turns her back on them.
Â 
Â 
@sati - Hes just being exiled, hes not being killed. It would be like Bronn not being part of Tyrions story anymore and thats not in the finale. Losing the dragons has much more importance, especially with the casual audience.Â 
Â 
I simply think it would be better to have a seperate episode for Jorahs exile as regards Danys story. Having the dragon thing as well will only serve as a big distraction and doesn't add anything to the drama of him being exiled. Plus everyones focus will be (rightly) on the dragons and that sort of makes his exile a bit of a footnote if it happens in the same episode. So I can't see how pushing his exile into the final episode would add to the sense of moment, mingling it with the exile of the dragons would diminish it IMO.

Â 
I think it fits better in the finale in terms of storytelling- it provides a good transition to annoyed Dany during the Hazzea scene. Jorah's banishment is not a that big of a moment in comparison to the others- regardless of where it is put, it will be overshadowed. As such, while being an emotional scene, it serves better as a transition to the finale moment.
Â 
Â 
Dany banishing Jorah- 5 minutesÂ 
Hazzea- 2 minutes
Dany chaining up the Dragons- 3-4 minutes (far longer than it appears; the entire Dracarys sequence, from beginning, to end, was only 7 minutes)

Â 
You are underestimating the power of 'Jorah loves her' subplot among female viewers
4994	King Tommen	2014-05-26	I don't think the chaining of the dragons will be a long sequence. More than likely, after the bones are presented and Dany gets a look of realization, they'll cut to a shot of them wrangling Rhaegal and Viserion with Dany looking on and then when they try and get Drogon, he'll fly off. Quick couple lines of dialogue and then, that's it. It's a minute long scene max. I'm not sure what people are expecting here but the CGI can't really be a whole lot more than this. This isn't the Dracarys scene, not even close.
4995	Le Cygne	2014-05-26	I hadn't noticed they actually gave a second thought to the romantic subplots female viewers want to see, though. (Or male viewers, for that matter.)

I don't really see how the transition would add anything to either scene. We go from her exiling her advisor to suddenly having to cage her dragons in the space of ten minutes. An act which changes everything for her should be given its own episode.Â 
Â 
So how would you guess the sequence of events will be for episode 8 with Dany?

@Sati A plot which which continues into ADWD and their parting words in the book more than imply that this was not the last we had seen of Jorah.

Theres supposed to be really expensive CGI shot which a lot of people are convinced is going to be the dragons being caged including myself. We haven't seen the dragons that much this season so I am convinced that its because big budget stuff later on.Â 
Â 
Plus we have seen shots of Dany under the pyramid slowly walking to see her dragons.
Â 
They won't make it a few snippets. Theres a lot of pathos and need to set the tone in these scenes. The show obviously wants to make this much more of a big moment than it ever was in the books (which IMO gave the impression the problem would resolve itself which...it did)

The show obviously wants to make this much more of a big moment than it ever was in the books (which IMO gave the impression the problem would resolve itself which...it did)I agree, it seems like they'd make that the finale moment, and the Jorah moment in episode 8.
5002	King Tommen	2014-05-26	You can only do so much when it comes to wrangling the dragons. It's not like it's going to be some extended French Connection style chase through the streets of Meereen. There may be some extensive CGI work done but the scene can't go on for very long. I would think it would be very similar to the goat scene or the scene in E1 with them all fighting over the food and Drogon snapping at Dany.
5003	Tyrion1991	2014-05-26	Â 
Letter from Tywin arriving- look of realization on Dany's face.


Â 
That would be a very weak way to end Danys part of that episode. Especially since we would have no clarification on what she has read for another two weeks and Jorah gets exiled fairly quickly before we have to focus on the dragons being caged. It makes much more sense to devote more time to having him exiled rather than spend a few minutes building tension with Missandei before she gets Tywins ridiculous hate-mail (honestly she will look so stupid if she exiles Jorah because Tywin essentially tells her to: this being the mighty Tywins master plan). HBO have promised big event episodes but what you describe sounds like filler.

Â 
It still makes more sense to make effective use of Danys time in episode 8 and exile Jorah. Episode 10 has to end every single characters storyline whereas episode 8 only has Tyrion, Arya? and Theon from what I've seen in the promo. It makes much more sense to get one of Danys things to do out of the way when they have time rather than having to resolve both in the final episode.
5005	Seneti	2014-05-26	I think that another possibility could be, however, that she is in the lake, and then a messenger comes in with a letter from Tywin telling her about Jorah. Her scene could end with an angered expression her face. I prefer your idea, but I think that there might not be enough time to set-up Jorah's betrayal if they don't go down that road. Also, they're going to have an awesome dragon scene in the finale anyways, so they might ignore this one.Â 


Â 
I think thats exactly how it's going to go down.Â 
Â 


Here's how I expect it to go down.Â 
Â 
Scene in 0408: Dany and Missandei in the lake, Tywin's letter arrives (I think Tywin's letter was a great idea, as, finally, we see a bit of connectivity between the two storylines).Â 
Â 
Scene 1 in 0410: Dany calls Jorah for questioning, banishes him.
Â 
Scene 2 in 0410: Continuation of scene 1. The court is set in order after the banishment, and Hazzea comes in with more bones. Dany says that she's not in the mood to deal with frivolities like goats. He says it's not a goat and presents the bones. Ash-stricken look on Dany's face.
Â 
Scene 3 in 0410: Epic lock-up of the dragons, as Drogon escapes. Dany's arc wrapped up for the season.


Â 
I like this outline, but if they go with that, then I jope that Dany's 3rd scene will not be the last scene of the episode.
Â 


In the promo, Theon's line is:
"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon."
Now, if you listen carefully, it does sound like there should be more to what he says, but it is cut out. Now, if they couldn't have him say everything, for whatever reason, why should they choose to include "Son of Balon"? I think this hints that Theon will arrive at the Moat, be told that Balon is dead, and that both Victarion* and Yara have both sailed back to the Iron Islands, rather than Yara receiving the news.
*Assuming that they keep him, of course


Â 
Good idea. It would certainly help in keeping Balon's death as unceremonious as it was in the books. Also, I do think Victarion will be in. If any iron born is in danger of being cut from the story, it's Aeron.
5006	Tyrion1991	2014-05-26	@Frey Pies
Â 
The letter is a horrible idea.
Â 
It makes Dany look incredibly stupid because she does what her enemies tell her to do and makes it far too explicit that this isn't in her interests. In the books Jorah gets called out by the greatest and most honorable knight in Westeros, in the TV series its by a baby killing sociopath and the man who betrayed her father....
Â 
It diminishes Tywin. His only plan to deal with Dany is to send a nasty letter badmouthing her closest advisor in the hope that she kills him. Especially when that leaves her with the fabled Barristan Selmy. The book Tywin, if he had known about Daenerys (which he never did) would have done a lot more to deal with the problem. Instead the show has had to make him look like an idiot by dismissing the threat of a Targaryen with three dragons and the best army in the world. The fact is that such a reveal would massively change the story. Making him a glorified shit stirrer just makes him look petty. Hes got no way of knowing that Dany will exile him, especially since him telling her involves verifying that Jorah has went against them. In the books, he never expressly goes against Varys and we only have his word that he stopped reporting at Qaarth. This is one of the things that appauls Dany the fact that he never told his masters "that you were my man now". Tywins letter would actually end up vouching for his loyalty to Dany; not the other way around. Â 
Â 
Â 
They haven't brought the stories together at all. HBO is just pretending it has and having the characters talk about one anothers stories without considering the implications and without any consequences. For example, if Dany had known that Westeros was ripe for the taking then she would probably not have felt she needed to stay in Westeros. In the books she felt that Westeros wasn't going anywhere and there was no incentive to rush to the prize because she was not aware of the situation in Westeros. If the only result of this is that Tywin gets Jorah exiled instead of Barristan then thats a shockingly weak way to try and tie the two stories together.

5007	koke	2014-05-26	Wellâ<U+0080>¦. I, for one, think Jorah is going to be exiled in episode 10. People often talk about Jorahâ<U+0080><U+0099>s banishment as not that big event but I think is HUGE for the Daenerys storyline and is going to be really heart breaking Â for the audience. I would argue that is as important or even more than the chaining of the dragons. My bet is that Dany will probably find out about it in episode 8 and they will leave the audience wondering Â what she is going to do about it. I could see my unsullied friends freaking out at the thought of Dany killing Jorah in episode 10.
Â 
And just an idea I read somewhere else, nobody has thought of him having a role in the chaning of the Dragons scene?Â  It could be quite epic if thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the deadly mission Dany sends him with some men instead of the Meereen infiltration as in the books.
Â 
By the way, there is an interesting line delivered by Jorah in one of the trailers that hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been on the show yet: 'When you chain good men like beasts, then beasts is what you make of them'Â 
Â 
http://youtu.be/iPWTunF4bRkÂ  (1:04)
Â 
At least I think that's what he says. I thought it was: "when you treat good men" but someone pointed out in another place that it sounded like 'chain' and is all I can hear now, not sure though, English is Â not my first lenguage.
Â 
Â
5008	Tyrion1991	2014-05-26	I think he said that last episode about the mission to Yunkai.
Â 
Â 
Theres no reason to ask him to try chaining the dragons. Dany leads Viserion of his own free will as she wouldn't leap to violence straight away on her own children. Also, Jorah can't capture two dragons. Well, he could help capture Rhaegal I guess.

Â 
No, he didn't say that line last episode, that's why I'm intrigued, It could have been from last episode and they just cut it Â of course, Â but if he says "chain" it doesn't make sense because Dany didn't talk about chaining anyone.
Â 
About the chaning of the Dragons: I don't think Jorah is going to catch two (or three) Dragons and chain them all by himself, that will be just crazy, but he could lead the mission somehow. Â Somebody has to do it anyway.... and it's a quite a dangerous one, more than fighting Meereen's champion.
Â 
Jorah or nor Jorah I'm really curious about how they are going to do it in the show.... hope is not offscreen. How does it happen in the books? i can't remember it...

Â 
I think that it's fairly certain at this point Tywin's letter will be the instrument that reveals Jorah's spying to Daenerys. But your concerns about it diminishing Daenerys and Tywin are probably overstated, because I doubt very much that the letter is addressed directly to her. I expect that it will play out in a more insidious fashion than that.
Â 
In "The Laws of Gods and Men", Tywin asked Varys if it would be possible to "get your little birds inside Meereen". Varys responded that he could, and it was then that Tywin asked Mace to fetch him his quill and parchment. Now, if he sent that letter directly to Daenerys, it would alert her to Jorah's former activities, but approaching her so directly would also make it easier for her to dismiss such news as a piece of enemy propaganda designed to sew discord in her camp (which it is). At the very least, it would give Jorah some measure of plausible deniability. He might not have the world's best poker face, but unlike in the books, there's no one present in Meereen to stand witness against him (since Barristan didn't sit on Robert's Small Council). Furthermore, he hasn't been making overt, unwanted romantic overtures towards her in the show. His love for her has been more chaste, so their relationship isn't strained by her suspicions on that count (unless he makes a move on her in this episode - which I doubt). Daenerys might angrily confront Jorah with the knowledge of his past deeds, but unless he screws up royally, he would have a fairly decent chance at defending himself.
Â 
Tywin's a smart guy - he knows this. That's why I personally think that it's more likely that Tywin will leak that knowledge to Daenerys without making it explicitly clear to her that he's the one who's pulling the strings. Rather than delivering a letter to Daenerys signed with his name and marked with the Lannister seal, it would be far more effective for Varys' little birds to plant evidence of Jorah's past deeds and then arrange for one of Dany's other confidantes to discover it inadvertently. That way, when they tell her, it will appear as though Jorah was willfully concealing things from Daenerys (Come to think of it, Jorah might still have the Royal Pardon that Robert granted him back in the first season tucked away somewhere in his belongings. We never did see him get rid of it). If they can make it look like Jorah is still actively spying on Daenerys, then it will be much harder for him to argue his case to her. Let's say that she confronts him and basically says "Grey Worm/Missandei/Barristan found evidence that you've been spying on me. Tell me that this isn't true." In that context, his confession that he actually was spying on her back in the first season (but stopped) will come across as at least partial conformation, and it will likely cause Dany to treat him with further suspicion and hostility, to the point where she decides to banish him even though their relationship in the show is stronger than their relationship in the books.
Â 
As for your claim that "the show has had to make [Tywin] look like an idiot by dismissing the threat of a Targaryen with three dragons and the best army in the world", you're overlooking abundant evidence to the contrary. Yes, Tywin was dismissive of Dany and her Dragons when he talked to Joffrey in "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" last season, but this year we have seen two scenes that make it explicitly clear that he takes her seriously as a threat. There was his conversation with Oberyn in "Breaker of Chains" and the aforementioned Small Council meeting in "The Laws of Gods and Men". You may feel differently, but I think that they've done a far better job of making Tywin look informed and competent when it comes to Daenerys on the show than he was in the books, where he was almost entirely ignorant of her capabilities. Likewise, I think Dany is both more ruthless and less impetuous on the show than she is in the books - a consequence of her being aged up. Jorah's betrayal may have played out differently in the show than in than in the books, but I have faith that the show will serve all of the characters in this particular plotline effectively.

5011	Le Cygne	2014-05-26	At least I think that's what he says. I thought it was: "when you treat good men" but someone pointed out in another place that it sounded like 'chain' and is all I can hear now, not sure though, English is Â not my first lenguage.I'm hearing chain, but other lines weren't said like that on the show. I think either bits were cut or they pieced scenes together.
5012	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-26	Have some of you stopped to consider that maybe Tywin will send not a declaration of Jorah's betrayal, but correspondence asking for his current observations and that he hasn't said anything since writing about her baby or dragons, etc? That's for more damning. Or it could even, *gasp*, be something else altogether! How about you wait and see before writing long-winded essays on how something that never happened diminishes Tywin's character?

5013	~No One~	2014-05-26	I agree, it seems like they'd make that the finale moment, and the Jorah moment in episode 8.
I agree. It seems like they could make more of their time in ep 8. I mean, really, he should have been gone by now, but I do like how next season we'll have a nice comparison as to how much harder ruling/trusting people is without her Bear.
Â Â You can only do so much when it comes to wrangling the dragons. It's not like it's going to be some extended French Connection style chase through the streets of Meereen. There may be some extensive CGI work done but the scene can't go on for very long. I would think it would be very similar to the goat scene or the scene in E1 with them all fighting over the food and Drogon snapping at Dany.Â 
Not to mention that chasing dragons by running down streets seems fairly futile 
Â 
It still makes more sense to make effective use of Danys time in episode 8 and exile Jorah. Episode 10 has to end every single characters storyline whereas episode 8 only has Tyrion, Arya? and Theon from what I've seen in the promo. It makes much more sense to get one of Danys things to do out of the way when they have time rather than having to resolve both in the final episode.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there will be more storylines than just these three. At the very least, there is Jon and Sam stuff, as well as some Wildling action. Also, Sansa/LF backlash, with the Lords Declarant. Apparently also a bathing Missandei.
5014	koke	2014-05-26	I'm hearing chain, but other lines weren't said like that on the show. I think either bits were cut or they pieced scenes together.


Â 
Thanks! Yes,that could be it. Â I was convinced that line was going to be part of last week episode untill it aired.
Â 
BTW, Â for those who are trying to figured out how much time Dany will have in the last episodes and how they are going to wrap her storyline. There's another very minor scene with Jorah picking up his things that we know it's going to be on the show because it was written in a production board in Croatia.Â I guess it will be a really quick scene after his banishment but it will count for some seconds of screentime Â Also, it could be followed by some dialogue or images of him leaving the city or even of Dany alone in her chambers reflecting on it. Somehow it feels weird to me having that scene standing alone, I don't know why.Â

That sequence should be a show stopper. Just saying.
5016	Colonel Green	2014-05-26	It diminishes Tywin. His only plan to deal with Dany is to send a nasty letter badmouthing her closest advisor in the hope that she kills him.


Nowhere is it said this is his "only" plan. It's a preliminary salvo, the easiest card he has to play.
5017	boojam	2014-05-26	Nowhere is it said this is his "only" plan. It's a preliminary salvo, the easiest card he has to play.I think I see where the letter biz is going, but since neither Tywin or Meereen are in episode 9, only two episodes to go, by the end of episode 10 Tywin won't have any more cards to play, if catch my drift.
5018	Le Cygne	2014-05-26	My guess is episode 10 will end on the caging of the two dragons the yellow one and the green one and the escape of the black one.

I know they love the big moment that comes out of nowhere, but she's been calling them her children all this time...  She seems to have an affinity for "the black one"... I wonder why, maybe his name is a clue... I just want to hear her say it...

She definitely hasn't said their names but at the very least, HBO's named them....

5020	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-26	For all we know Tywin has just written a letter of invite for Dany to "The Greatest Showdown in Westeros History! Oberyn Martell vs Gregor Clegane"
Â 
And she'll be like: "Fuck Mereen, I need to check this shit out!"
Â 
And it turns out to be a trap. Much like everything is.
5021	Joyful Union	2014-05-26	Maybe they thought that the biggest dragon's name being one letter removed from Dragon was moronic, and therefore shouldn't come up in the show. Though I guess they could have changed his name. But then the book readers who complained about the lack of names in the first place would be upset. Show-only viewers don't give a shit. So I guess there's no real benefit.
5022	Le Cygne	2014-05-26	But you name your children. You ever name your pet. Hell, some people name other things, too.And it's not actually "moronic" to name the dragon after Drogo when that's all tied to her identity.Any more than it's "moronic" for anything to have meaning... but names often do in stories.
5023	Joyful Union	2014-05-26	Eh, George could have done a better job then "Drogon", if it had to refer to Drogo.
5024	Le Cygne	2014-05-26	I guess Charlie wouldn't have quite done the trick. But seeing as he named Drogo that way in the first place... Seems like it was meant to be, maybe that was the point.
5025	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-26	Eh, George could have done a better job then "Drogon", if it had to refer to Drogo.

5026	Tyrion1991	2014-05-26	Â 
I think that it's fairly certain at this point Tywin's letter will be the instrument that reveals Jorah's spying to Daenerys. But your concerns about it diminishing Daenerys and Tywin are probably overstated, because I doubt very much that the letter is addressed directly to her. I expect that it will play out in a more insidious fashion than that.
Â 
In "The Laws of Gods and Men", Tywin asked Varys if it would be possible to "get your little birds inside Meereen". Varys responded that he could, and it was then that Tywin asked Mace to fetch him his quill and parchment. Now, if he sent that letter directly to Daenerys, it would alert her to Jorah's former activities, but approaching her so directly would also make it easier for her to dismiss such news as a piece of enemy propaganda designed to sew discord in her camp (which it is). At the very least, it would give Jorah some measure of plausible deniability. He might not have the world's best poker face, but unlike in the books, there's no one present in Meereen to stand witness against him (since Barristan didn't sit on Robert's Small Council). Furthermore, he hasn't been making overt, unwanted romantic overtures towards her in the show. His love for her has been more chaste, so their relationship isn't strained by her suspicions on that count (unless he makes a move on her in this episode - which I doubt). Daenerys might angrily confront Jorah with the knowledge of his past deeds, but unless he screws up royally, he would have a fairly decent chance at defending himself.
Â 
Tywin's a smart guy - he knows this. That's why I personally think that it's more likely that Tywin will leak that knowledge to Daenerys without making it explicitly clear to her that he's the one who's pulling the strings. Rather than delivering a letter to Daenerys signed with his name and marked with the Lannister seal, it would be far more effective for Varys' little birds to plant evidence of Jorah's past deeds and then arrange for one of Dany's other confidantes to discover it inadvertently. That way, when they tell her, it will appear as though Jorah was willfully concealing things from Daenerys (Come to think of it, Jorah might still have the Royal Pardon that Robert granted him back in the first season tucked away somewhere in his belongings. We never did see him get rid of it). If they can make it look like Jorah is still actively spying on Daenerys, then it will be much harder for him to argue his case to her. Let's say that she confronts him and basically says "Grey Worm/Missandei/Barristan found evidence that you've been spying on me. Tell me that this isn't true." In that context, his confession that he actually was spying on her back in the first season (but stopped) will come across as at least partial conformation, and it will likely cause Dany to treat him with further suspicion and hostility, to the point where she decides to banish him even though their relationship in the show is stronger than their relationship in the books.
Â 
As for your claim that "the show has had to make [Tywin] look like an idiot by dismissing the threat of a Targaryen with three dragons and the best army in the world", you're overlooking abundant evidence to the contrary. Yes, Tywin was dismissive of Dany and her Dragons when he talked to Joffrey in "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" last season, but this year we have seen two scenes that make it explicitly clear that he takes her seriously as a threat.

Jorah's betrayal may have played out differently in the show than in than in the books, but I have faith that the show will serve all of the characters in this particular plotline effectively.


Â 
Why would Tywin bother with Jorah? Hes just a knight whose most well known accomplishment was storming the walls of Pyke. This isn't Jon Connington we're talking about here and whilst the show has portrayed him as fairly smart (sort of in the books as well) theres no way that Tywin or even Varys would be aware of this. Jorah has never been in a position of command or leadership. Its very much making a big assumption that Tywin is magically aware that Jorah is actually a better advisor than Barristan (in the shows portrayel). But he has no reason to assume that. Barristan was a member of the Kingsguard and has actually commanded armies in mutliple wars and experienced the poltiics as a member of the Kingsguard. For example he led the conquest of one of the Iron Islands. Jorah really should not be Tywins priority when it comes to removing Danys advisors; from Tywins perspective Barri is the real threat. Oh thats right, the show wants Tywin to do something with Dany so its making him responsible for something which is going to happen anyway because they want to trick viewers into thinking that Danys arc is part of the main story. Its a pointless deviation. Tywin should be focusing on assasinating Barri and Dany herself; not Jorah. Its just because Jorah gets exiled that they've decided "we'll make the mighty Tywin shit stir to get rid of Jorah". This is weak on HBO's part to try to make a subplot of Tywin influencing events in Meereen by making him responsible for book events that had nothing to do with him.
Â 
Um, no. Tywin in the previous episode said "Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years, armies win them all the time" he is STILL very much dismissing the threat posed by the dragons. And his "opening salvo" is lets get her to exile Jorah. WTF? If Tywin had known about Dany it would have been the absolute focus of his policy. He should be raising EVERY soldier in the Westerlands, recruiting advisors and experts who would know how to deal with dragons. Every expert would tell him that one dragon could defeat any army and destroy Casterly Rock; that Dorne only won by NOT fighting the Targaryen dragons and that a dragon can only be killed by another dragon or by insane levels of luck. He should be 100% aware that Oberyn tried to raise Dorne in rebellion for Danys brother and are diehard Targ loyalists; he shouldn't be considering allies. If anything he should have pre-emptively invaded Dorne before they could join Dany. Made peace with the Ironborn rather than have a war on two fronts and worse leave the door open for them to ally with Daenerys (which they intend to do under Euron and Vic). The show has made a COLLOSSAL deviation from GRRM story in making Tywin aware of Dany so early and it would have had dramatic implications for the actions of every faction in Westeros. But, the show doesn't want to make big changes just to give the impression that the stories have something to do with eachother. Plus, hes dismissing DRAGONS... Which his oh so accurate reports should have told him went from being hand sized hatchlings to 12ft monsters in the space of less than a year. Thats near 10 times bigger. They are obviously going to become fully grown, but again, Tywin being aware of that would mean he would devote much more effort and this would change the story too much. So they make him a dumbass and dismiss the threat posed by the dragons. One of whom could kill all 60,000 of his men and melt his castle with ease in another year. The man discovered the enemy has nukes and has flat out dismissed them. Mark of an idiot.

I've always wondered if there's supposed to be a big difference in personality or demeanor between Rhaegal and Viserion.

Â 
Viserion is the cute and lovable one; particularly towards Dany. Hes always portrayed wanting to be close to her and acting like hes smaller than he really is.
Â 
Drogon is the alpha predator, he is brutal, vicious and violent.
Â 
Rhaegal, lacks any real characterization. I guess he comes across as brooding and dangerous. Although I think hes mentioned as having a really loud roar that could "send a hundred lions running". He seems to have a bit of a love hate thing with Viserion. They fight and claw at eachother in ASOS in the chapter when Jorah kisses Dany yet later in ADWD when Quentyn tries to ride Viserion he helps his brother by burning the character. Seems to like Drogon as they are coiled together basking in the sun in Danys first Meereen chapter.

Â 
While they may be "trained" that does not imply that they were ever domesticated to the point that they were "tame". Hawks were trained but they never became domesticated and remained "hawks" same is true for the Dragons. Dragons were "trained" to accept 1 rider at a time. Anyone else got too close and they became a nutritious snack.Â

Â 
Thank you, voice of reason! Why does everybody think that Tywin would address the letter directly to her? 
If he was that stupid, he would have put his name and seal under Walder Frey's invitation to Robb...
Â 
I have to agree with everyone about the dragons, though. It's about time they named them....
5045	Tyrion1991	2014-05-27	Again, he has an easy way to get rid of Jorah, so he uses it.Â  Jorah is established in the scene as being an important advisor (and if you think the book version has insufficient status for that, assume the show version did something more impressive).Â  Tywin wants him gone (and he has no way of predicting Dany won't kill him, rather than exiling him).Â  It would also serve to make her more paranoid about her advisers, given that her longest-serving one was revealed as a fraud.

Â 
Its not easy at all. Calling on Varys assets in Meereen risks their exposure and if discovered would prevent further action. Hes taking a big risk calling on those assets and for very little gain. Also, Tywin should be planning more than just getting rid of Jorah as his opening salvo. The only reason he isn't is because the show isn't actually changing anything, its just trying to make him responsible for something Barristan was meant to do. He has no idea it will make her more paranoid unless he broke the 4th wall and read the end of ASOS. He does not know that Jorah is Danys closest friend, nor does Varys even imply it. The show has not expressly changed any of the lore surrounding Jorah or Barristan exploits; the history and lore stuff in the DVD makes express mention of what they did. Barristan is a much more capable and experienced battle commander by repute. Again, Tywin has no way of knowing, nor is he told by Varys, that Jorah is as capable as Barri and more central to Danys plans than Barri. I don't get how you can't see that this is like Crasters Keep and Yara at the Dreadfort, a pointless and nonsensical deviation that doesn't change anything but eats up screentime. Its purely because HBO did not like that GRRM decided to separate Danys story from the Kings Landing arc for so long and decided to change it without actually changing it.
Â 
Â 
Â 
The show has shrank the world down immensely in HBOs version hence the rapid travel of news. Its been implied that Dany could have fast traveled with her fleet of 93 ships down the Blackwater before Tywin could have found out ie next episode. So whilst in the books it is true she is a world away in the show she isn't. Also, the Lannister army is demobilized between ASOS and AFFC. The dragons can EASILY kill his army but that doesn't preclude him trying because he knows that Dany will execute him. But the Tywin of the show is being stupid. He knows that Dany has rapidly growing dragons and that three of these things managed to conquer Westeros. Note that he doesn't dismiss Danys dragons because they are small he dismisses them because "armies win wars all the time dragons haven't won a war in 300 years"; he flat out dismisses them even if they were fully grown. This is him being stupid so the show can explain away why hes not focusing all of his attention and resources on the threat. Â Â 
Â 
Â 
That Varys is telling Tywin ANYTHING is beyond stupid. The man is a diehard Targaryen supporter and wants Aegon to marry Dany; with his friend Illyrio already calling on his assets for them to meet up. He would never compromise her by revealing vital information to Tywin. Like in the books he would deliberately misinform him. This is a change purely to convenience their change and note how no other story is aware of Dany yet? Why hasn't Melisandre or Stannis heard of her yet if rumors have travelled so quickly back and forth across the Narrow Sea.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
It does diminish Tywin. The last letter he sent resulted in the Red Wedding and the death of a King and his entire army. His genius plan this time is to exile Danys best friend...thats quite a disappointing, almost petty climb down. Shouldn't he be building up some mega plan to destroy Dany in a single fell swoop rather than petty sniping at her best friend?Â 
Â 
As opposed to Danys counter salvo next season where the Ironborn and the Martells essentially ally with her.

5046	boojam	2014-05-27	It's always odd having Jorah around saying 'they are wild' , while true, he must know they can be trained? "
Â While they may be "trained" that does not imply that they were ever domesticated to the point that they were "tame". Hawks were trained but they never became domesticated and remained "hawks" same is true for the Dragons. Dragons were "trained" to accept 1 rider at a time. Anyone else got too close and they became a nutritious snack.Â That is 100% correct.
I looked into becoming a falconer once and found out either you had to rich or a pauper with a ton of time on your hands , I suppose you could be retired , but you'd have to live in the county.
I don't know , if in medieval Europe or any where else in the world if world 'small folk' were allowed to train falcons.
The short of it is that the 'high born' employed trained Falconers.
It is a hell of a process that takes patience close to madness!
Falcon's must be keep as close to be 'wild' as possible , it must not become a pet.
I always remember the point comes where the falconer flies a falcon 'at Hack'.... where you let a young falcon hunt on it's own and the trainer avoids as much contact as possible.
Your young falcon may just fly away! Those Falconers have more than one flying raptor in training.
If your training produces a fine hunter, at the end of season, a falconer releases the bird into the wild out respect.... and starts over again.
(Anyway you can not keep a falcon in captivity, it will stop hunting.)
True falconers were extraordinary people.
In the west it is now practiced as a hobby and , I think, in the East falconers still practice.
There are people who do train falcons and hawks to do 'trained' flying but few hunt with them.
The Peregrine Falcon, I might note, was nearly driven extinct by the use of DDT.
As for dragons. Despite movies and books, how do you train a dragon to be a War Dragon, so you are not eaten or your allies!?
Like predatory cats in our world tigers, leopards, jaguars, cheetahs, and cougars can be raised from childhood to favor a person or persons, it's not the same as domestication.
They can turn dangerous.
Dragons are a fantasy creature ,one supposes connecteded to magic, the laws of this world would not apply...
As we know something happens in Dany's story leads to the situation of living with a large dangerous dragon who does not eat her and even protects her... that seems maybe the beginnings of a 'training' or 'mastering' , it will be fascinating to see how George goes about this.
Will Dany wind up with three War Dragons like Aegon I Targaryen?
I hope so , that would indeed "take the biscuit!".

5047	SoManyVows	2014-05-27	Not sure if someone's already linked to these, but several promotional photos for "The Mountain and the Viper" have just been posted by SpoilerTV. http://www.spoilertv... and the Viper/
Â 
Among the highlights:
Â 
-Multiple shots of the Hound and Arya walking along the path that leads to the Bloody Gate, flanked by soldiers wearing the sigil of House Arryn.
Â 
-One picture of the Knight of the Gate
Â 
-Multiple shots of Dany sitting on her throne, looking particularly severe.
Â 
-A shot of Jorah, sans armor, staring up at her, and another shot of him exiting the throne room
Â 
-Two shots of Jorah standing on what appears to be a balcony over looking the ocean, but could be the deck of a ship. He's bent over a map with some kind of writing on it. It looks like either numbers (5505?) or letters (SOSS?) depending on which way you look at it. Or it could be something else entirely.
Â 
-A few shots of Sansa in the Eyrie, preparing to testify.
Â 
-Tywin and Ellaria at the trial by combat. Also a random shot of Pycelle.
Â 
-The Greyjoy banner hanging from one of Moat Cailin's towers.
Â 
So at the very least,Â  Arya, the Hound and Dany are all confirmed to appear this episode. It looks like most of the speculation in this thread about what might happen with those characters this week was correct: the Hound will attempt to gain entrance to the Vale, be denied by the Knight of the Gate, and a skirmish will ensue. Dany will confront Jorah about something (almost certainly his past betrayal), and most likely banish him.

Â 
Nice find! Thanks a lot. Have we ever seen these many promo picture of an episode before? Kind of surprising.
Â 
So, Jorah is definitely getting banished this episode. I was almost certain that this would happen in Ep 10, but I'm glad it's happening here!

5049	salmonsnake	2014-05-27	Wow those promo pics
Â 
What a huge episode, does anyone know its length? The HBO website in the past sometimes (for episode 6 at least) displayed the duration before airing, this time it's not shown, it seems.
5050	Frey Pies	2014-05-27	It's 53 minutes long.
5051	salmonsnake	2014-05-27	Sounds quite short.
Â 
I'm more surprised that they will also have a scene of Jorah setting sail. I wonder if this means he'll have a 'solo' scene in episode ten, and I wonder what that could be.

Poor Jorah Â .Â Gonna miss his neckerchiefs for the rest of the season.
Â 
Don't evenÂ bother dyeing your hair for the Vale Lords, Sansa. Not that they shouldn't have prior to the Eyrie anyway, but this makes LF seem plain stupidÂ  Â .

Â 
He could go to a whorehouse and ask for a girl with pale blonde hair? Don't see what else he'd do in between now and running into Tyrion, so it is curious they're willing to spend the time on it.
5056	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-27	Well, at least we know the ring wasn't an oversight. She actually does take it off this episode. It serves a purpose after all.
5057	Father of Dragons	2014-05-27	I'd say the writing on Jorah's second map is "Essos". That river and area of water is the Skahazadan and Slaver's Bay, and of course the map above (the one he is probably looking at) is one of Westeros.
Damn, I was ninja'd.

I suppose, if the letter from episode 6 has reached Meereen by episode 8, it'd be, in the show's peculiar universe, easily enough time for him to reach Volantis (but also King's Landing, haha). But I doubt they'll introduce us to a whole new city with an entirely different landscape/architecture/culture/atmosphere/vibe than in anything we have seen thus far. Unless they skip the sort of arrival scene that Braavos had.

Â 
Yeah, my initial impression was that he was on a boat because the ocean is so clearly visible in the background. I took a second look, however, and the hanging fabrics that I thought were parts of a ship's sail were revealed to be shades or curtains of some kind. This scene could certainly take place before Dany summons him to the throne room, in which case Jorah could be devising some form of military strategy. Or it could take place after Dany banishes him (but before he departs Meereen), in which case he could be trying to decide where in the hell he should go.

5066	Ordos	2014-05-27	I've written a list of all the events that happened in book 3 that have yet to happen in season 4. As they happen in the remaining episodes, I will cross them off.
Â 
It really looks like there will actually be book 3 material in season 5! Shows you how much a beast of a book it is.
Â 
Â 
Here is the list:
Â 
Gregor vs. Oberyn (next episode obviously)
Â 
Tyrion escapes and kills Tywin and Shae
Â 
Battle on the Wall both north and south. Ygritte dies. Stannis to the rescue.
Â 
Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander
Â 
Arya leaves The Hound
Â 
Balon falls off a bridge
Â 
Jorah is banished
Â 
Lady Stoneheart
Â 
Where is Rickon? (not so much the book but sources say he will appear this season)
Â 
Coldhands and Bloodraven (Bloodraven is in book 5 but again sources say he'll appear but I know Coldhands has been cut)
5067	King Tommen	2014-05-27	What Book 3 material would be in Season 5? I'm drawing a blank. All the events mentioned above have a very strong chance of occurring this season.

Also I'm not sure how they will handle the battle on the wall and the aftermath and squeeze it all in just 2 episodes.

Â 
I think there's a very good chance we get Balon dying in the finale. I also think they can put in an abridged version of the LC election in the finale (there's no way they're going to have it nearly as involved as it is in the books). You can get through all the post battle stuff at the Wall in 10 minutes during the finale. It's not that difficult.

I think Balon falling off the bridge works perfectly as a cold opening to next season- better for both Yara and the Kingsmoot in my opinion.

Jorah's getting banished on Sunday
5072	sati	2014-05-27	I think it will go like this - judging on the pics Jorah is staring at some maps outside and Barristan comes over. He is somehow gonna get a hold of that letter there. The next scene is banishment at the court.
5073	Colonel Green	2014-05-27	Jorah's banishment.


That'll be either in episode 8 or episode 10 of this year.Â  We've seen footage of it.

And to be honest, that's exactly what I DON'T want. I'm tired of Sansa being under anyone's...anything. I even hate the characterization that, "LF is going to teach her how to play the game." What exactly is he going to "teach" her? To manipulate? To lie? Because she already did those things (albeit, not very well, but she did them and of her own accord with her own survival in mind). I would HOPE they'd add a crazy plot twist and make HER the one who leads the horse by the bit. Otherwise, she remains nothing but a pawn under a different banner.

Â 
Yeah, well it's frustrating, but hopefully with them blowing through her AFFC material, we'll get to her being a player (not pawn) in the game sooner rather than later. Â She can lie and manipulate, but in KL her end game was survival/escape. LF is now showing her strategic planning in the form of political moves. Sansa is catching on to his game, and able to figure a lot out for herself. I have a feeling her becoming the giant slayer won't be far off, and we can only hope that the show accelerates this development, which is why I'm hoping for the Harry the Heir reveal at the end of this season.

Â 
Both Sophie Turner and Aiden Gillen have given interviews in the past few weeks wherein they hint that Sansa may be starting to manipulate Littlefinger to a certain degree without his knowledge. Of course, actors are actors and their interpretations of their characters' thoughts and motivations don't have to be taken as strict canon, but make of that what you will.
Â 
Personally, I think that Sansa's going to lie to the Lords Declarant in this episode about what happened to Lysa, and she'll do it without Littlefinger having coached her on exactly what to say. Littlefinger may still believe that he's got her completely under his thumb, but after the events of last week, I think that her eyes have been opened.

I should clarify. Littlefinger probably will have given her instructions on what to do (I agree that it would have been foolish of him not to, knowing the stakes). But I think that Anya Waynwood and Yohn Royce will be heavily skeptical of their initial story, and Sansa will independently come up with some form of embellishment during her testimony that hinges on the Lords' assumption that she's this innocent, naive girl without a deceptive or politically-minded bone in her body. It will be her version than ends up convincing the Lords Declarant, leaving Littlefinger impressed and convinced that he can mentor her to a greater extent. Sansa, however, is looking out only for herself at this point, and is willing to play along with Littlefinger's schemes in order to keep herself free and safe.

Â 
See, this is what I originally thought as well. But it has suddenly dawned on me to wonder WHO exactly can she lie and manipulate (or "play the game" with)? She can't interact with anyone outside of the Vale because she's wanted for regicide (thus making the scope of her game rather limited), and it would actually be in her best interest to tell the Lords who she really is as they'd be more inclined to support the niece of Lysa/Daughter of Ned and Cat rather than the bastard niece/daughter of Littlefinger (who they resent anyways). I'm honestly perplexed about where her story is going.
Â 


Â

Â 
THIS TOO. I keep waiting for what Sophie and Aiden have been saying to materialize because I don't think they were trolling. In the end, when LF asks Sansa, "Who's side she's on," I want her to say "MY SIDE". That way, she keeps him guessing throughout the testimony and it adds some damn UMPH to character. Shit man! Give me UMPH! Also, it'll make clear to the audience that she's not in the mood to be played or used by anyone anymore and that she'll be an active participant to her own damn life!

This, essentially. I think Littlefinger will give his own testimony (as well as introducing his niece Alayne) and the Lords Declarant end up putting him in a corner. Then Sansa comes to the rescue with a heartfelt speech.

I haven't read every one of your reactions to the new pictures, but from them it's evident we will be getting Jorah's exile. That isn't him on a ship though, that's a balcony overlooking Meereen that we've seen in some of the production videos.
Â 
With the Hound and Arya, the Bloody Gate is this week. I wonder how the fighting will break out because with all of those archers and whatnot we saw in "First of His Name" there is no way either of them could get out alive. Unless the number of guards has been reduced due to whatever is going on in the Eyrie with LF and Sansa and the Lords Declarant.

I really have a hard time seeing how they're going to get away from that location, if they walk all the way up to the Gate.Â  Unless the fight only starts when they get back to the entrance, there's a long passageway lined with archers, from what we saw in episode 5.

Jorah is given the boot, Arya and the Hound fight off the Knights of the Vale and the Hound is mortally wounded, the Wildlings attack Moleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Town, Theon and Ramsay take Moat Cailin, Sansa plays the Lords Declarant like a pro and to top it all off - the trial by combat! 


The fuck? I said that at WIC. That is a direct quote by me from WIC.
5097	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	What do you all think that Pycelle is doing on what looks to be the duel arena? Maybe it's like a sit-in protest. "I won't leave this spot until you cancel this duel!"

What do you all think that Pycelle is doing on what looks to be the duel arena?


Maybe he is announcing the trial? Saying something about leaving it to the gods to decide? He seems to be sitting next to Cersei during the trial and I cannot imagine having Pycelle change his location near the ending of the ep
5099	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	That would be a hilarious bit of dark comedy though. Everyone's stunned becauseÂ a certain loveable someone gets his face bashed in and then the crowd has to sit while Pycelle dodders his way down for five minutes. Everything is silent except for the buzzing of flies and his maester's chain a-rattling.
Â 
That said, you're right of course.

Oh God  As delighted as Cersei will be with the result even she would eye roll at that.
Â 
From the book, right before the trial:

Â 
The High Septon shuffled forward in his tall crystal crown, and prayed that the Father Above would help them in this judgment, and that the Warrior would lend his strength to the arm of the man whose cause was just.

Maybe they give this role to Pycelle.
5101	iheartseverus	2014-05-27	The fuck? I said that at WIC. That is a direct quote by me from WIC.


OK, nothing to get upset about...Â  She just said she saw it at another site, is all.
5102	El CapitA!n	2014-05-27	Sorry if this was already mentioned but I couldn't browse all 24 pages... did you guys see the Hound next to the House Arryn sigil in the preview? I'm guessing they are going to make it to the Eerie, only to find out that Lysa is dead.
5103	Annara Snow	2014-05-27	Â 
See, this is what I originally thought as well. But it has suddenly dawned on me to wonder WHO exactly can she lie and manipulate (or "play the game" with)? She can't interact with anyone outside of the Vale because she's wanted for regicide (thus making the scope of her game rather limited), and it would actually be in her best interest to tell the Lords who she really is as they'd be more inclined to support the niece of Lysa/Daughter of Ned and Cat rather than the bastard niece/daughter of Littlefinger (who they resent anyways). I'm honestly perplexed about where her story is going.
Â How would she know that, and for that matter, how would you know that? Sansa Stark is wanted by the Crown for regicide. The Vale stayed out of the war. Yes, it was Lysa who decided not to get involved, but it's not like the lords from the Vale rebelled against her and proclaimed their desire to go to war on Robb's side. And that was when he was still alive. Why would Sansa assume that they are going to support her and, what, start a war against the Lannisters and their allies,  Boltons and Freys, all on their own, since there is no Stark or Tully force now? And why? What does it have to do with the Vale? Why should they support her just because she's Sansa Stark,  rather than turning her over to Tywin and Cersei,  which they would demand  as soon as they got word that Sansa is in the Vale - and something like that would be impossible to hide with lots of people knowing it?
Sansa announcing her identity at this point makes zero sense, just as it did in the book. She doesn't even know these people or what they want. At least with Littlefinger she knows that he wants to keep her alive and away from King's Landing. She's not trying to get support as his daughter/niece/whatever, she's trying to remain unnoticed and survive. 
Â 
THIS TOO. I keep waiting for what Sophie and Aiden have been saying to materialize because I don't think they were trolling. In the end, when LF asks Sansa, "Who's side she's on," I want her to say "MY SIDE". That way, she keeps him guessing throughout the testimony and it adds some damn UMPH to character. Shit man! Give me UMPH! 
Â  I hope not. It's bad enough that they've made LF and Margaery painfully obvious on the show. They should at least let Sansa retain the mask of a naive, scared young girl (which Sophie has said in interviews Sansa is doing, and which she was doing with Lysa) that he thinks he can mold into what he wants - which is her best chance to manipulate him, and others. It would be absurd if she was all "look at me, I'm a strong young woman who will take no shit from you!" just because some viewers would think it's cool.

He took the role of the High Septon during Ned's confession (and a couple of other times that I can't recall, maybe while Ned was holding court?) so I'd imagine he's taking that job again here.
5105	jentario	2014-05-27	OK, nothing to get upset about...Â  She just said she saw it at another site, is all.


Not upset, just surprised. Why would anyone take a random speculative comment from WIC as fact?

Personally I'd be delighted if they really fight Eyrie men and not Brienne - having her run into Hound and Arya would be the last drop to make this whole 'everyone runs into everyone' thing too ridiculous.
Â 
I'd love for her to have a scene this ep, but it looks like she won't.
5108	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	^Well we've seen no evidence of her appearing in this one yet, but I hope she does, otherwise she'd need a shit ton of screentime in "the Children" when that screentime will be needed elsewhere.
Â 
The pictures of Arya and the Hound seem to track a series of reactions of theirs. We've got one of them looking up, likely at the Eyrie, then one of Arya smiling, then one of them looking disappointed and then concerned at the end. I wonder what happens in the Bloody Gate to lead to that whole trajectory of emotions from the two.

Probably taking the place of a Septon and announcing the duel, the victor determining guilt yadda yadda yadda

Well Jorah and Hound scenes being in ep. 8 leave some room in ep.10. But if Brienne does end up getting captured I think it would work better if it happens in ep.8 than somewhere in ep.10, depending on whether or not we do see her in...one more scene in finale
5111	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	Well regardless these last three eps. are shaping up. I hope that all of them get 10s here and straight A grades on the AV Club.

I think Stannis has been on an upswing in the show recently. Every scene since the burning was good (even the one directly after the burning). So I have hopes that they deliver on Stannis here and especially in season 5 when he goes on his march to free the North.

(Amazing what trivial details we can focus on when there's this long wait between episodes!)
5120	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	^Yeah, he's standing on a balcony. We saw in one of the first production videos that came out. I think it was the production design introducing the new lady to the job. I think it overlooks Meereen.

Anyway, I think in this episode it's Jorah and Daario who will try to prove themselves and Daario will stay while Jorah is gone.

It's definitely a Westeros map. Behind it is a map of the Free Cities. One annoying detail is that Craster's Keep is on the map, but that's a nitpick

It looks like it matches up with one of the pics of Dany looking stricken, and Jorah looking upwards. The past has come to bite Jorah in the @ss, big time. Glad they're doing it this episode! That means all her episode 10 stuff can be "if I look back I am lost"!
Also, the shot in one of the trailers of Sansa marching through a doorway seems to match (costume-wise) to this episode. Granted, Sansa has been wearing the same thing for 4 years, so feel free to contest that comment   So maybe Sansa is angry with herself for corroborating LF's lies? Resigned? Just plain ol' scared?

Looks like assassination attempt during pregnancy will be the final straw in the show too
5132	Lord Carson	2014-05-27	I knew that shot of Tormund unsheathing a blade looked like a good opening shot, looks like it will be.
5133	scolbert08	2014-05-27	What's with the brief Grey Worm/Missandei recap scene? Missandei is supposed to have her bathing scene this episode, but beyond that I don't know what it's for.
5134	Blockfetcher	2014-05-27	I really hope they don't put anything Lady Stoneheart related in the final episode recap. Ugh, I'm having bad visions of them putting Catelyn getting slit and then the Beric 'how many times have I been brought back' scene. It's so obvious now what's going down in each episode. I understand that not all the viewers can remember every little thing but I hope for that they have the sense to let that be the shocking reveal it should be (assuming it's actually in the finale).Â
5135	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-27	http://m.youtube.com...h?v=c-v7DP7t4uw

So I think we can safely predict that this will be the order of the scenes:
Â 
1-Attack on Mole's Town and reaction at Castle Black
2-Some romantic scene between Grey Worm and Missandei
3-Moat Cailin
4-Lords Declarant in the Eyrie
5-Jorah is banished
6-Oberyn vs Mountain duel
5136	Lord Carson	2014-05-27	Plus Arya and the Hound.
5137	Newstar	2014-05-27	No gift of mercy reference in the recap...maybe they're saving that for 4x10? We know from stills that Arya and the Hound are in the episode.
5138	Chebyshov	2014-05-27	Note they made sure to show Not!Satin witnessing Ygritte killing his parents again. Definitely going to be the one to shoot her.
Â 
Oberyn's lines that they picked means we're definitely getting the "you raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children" part (as if there was any doubt).
Â 
Are we getting eunuch cuddles?
5139	sati	2014-05-27	I really hope they don't put anything Lady Stoneheart related in the final episode recap.

Â 
After seeing both the promotional photos and the recap, that's what I'm thinking now. The Hound attempting to gain entrance to the Vale and fighting the Knight of the Gate should be a fairly elaborate set piece in an episode that will be tight for time, so it will probably end with him and Arya escaping somehow. The gap between Episode 8 and Episode 10 should provide even more time for the Hound's wounds to fester (both the bite he received from Biter and whatever injuries he sustains this week). That would leave two scenes for the finale: one in the early part of the episode where Arya denies him the gift of mercy and leaves him, and then another one closer to the end where she meets the Braavosi captain and boards the ship.
5142	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-27	Are we getting eunuch cuddles?

Â 
We might get some Missandei/GW cuddles... I hope.
5143	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-27	I think they would use Beric and perhaps a scene where Brienne swears to Cat


Since I think Brienne's hanging/trial is best left for Season 5, the premiere probably, then I hope the recap uses THAT scene then. Not S4 finale.
5144	~No One~	2014-05-27	First, I love that the recap is out so early!
Second, there's nothing that I find too surprising about this. I think posters here have already nailed down most of what HBO has promo'd. 
Third, I love ANY glimpse at all of Ned! Love!
5145	Arkash	2014-05-27	Yeah, no real surprises in the recap.
Â 
Apart from the confirmation that Jorah's banishment will take place there.
Â 
Not sure about the gift of Mercy being in 8 or 10. I can see them putting in at the end of the Bloody Gate fight but not wanting to spoil it in the review.
Â 
Missandei bath scene seems to serve only her romance with GW, nothing more.
Â 
Episode opening on Mole's Town, I like it.
5146	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-27	This has all probably been mentioned, but this is what I learned from the recap:

-Confirms that Jorah will be discovered and he will bring up the time he saved Dany from the wineseller.
-Jorah will probably be incriminated with a pardon from Tywin.
-Grey Worm/Missandei relationship will develop further. He's probably the one spying on her while she's bathing butt-naked, lol.
-More of Olly looking at Ygritte. He's definitely killing her.
-Episode will start with Mole's Town getting attacked.
5147	Father of Dragons	2014-05-27	-Confirms that Jorah will be discovered and he will bring up the time he saved Dany from the wineseller.
I think it's more likely that she brings it up, but if he does, and says something like "Remember I saved you from that wine seller?"
To which she will say, "Holy shit, that's how you knew! I just thought you were magical so I never actually bothered to ask you how you knew, even if it was just a lucky guess - which is incredibly unlikely!"
-More of Olly looking at Ygritte. He's definitely killing her.Possibly in a Boromir fashion.
5148	Arkash	2014-05-27	In other news, that Greyjoy flag on the Moat (we can see in promo pictures) makes me hope we'll get a Victarion or Euron mention this episode ! Apart from episode 10, it is the last opportunity to hint at them now, unless they are cut.
5149	iheartseverus	2014-05-27	My guess, and hope, is that while Sandor is wounded in this episode (probably because he's already weakened and feverish from that bite), they don't take it right to the Gift of Mercy in this episode, but let it play out a bit, let it linger until ep.#10.Â  There's great drama for viewers in watching this ferocious, tormented man slowly brought down, along with all the attendant questions--will he die?Â  Will Ayra help save him?Â  Should he die, does he deserve to die, or not?Â Â  Its good drama, should be allowed to play out, allowing the viewers time to talk it out, to wonder, worry, cheer, hope, whatever, before the final answer is delivered.Â
5150	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-27	Sansa's hair is...more darker in the promotional pictures. Did she change her hair color? Or is it the lighting?
Â 
Either my eyes are playing tricks or there is an actual difference.
5151	Tyrion1991	2014-05-27	So the recap confirms Jorah getting exiled.
Â 
Â 
I am kind of looking forward to it but dreading at the same time because the shows really ruining Danys story IMO.Â 
Â 
What I hope is that...
Â 
1- They don't alter the dialogue, just go with what GRRM wrote. I don't know why when it comes to Dany the show writers have been much more willing to make changes and second guess GRRM on Danys sections..Â 
Â 
2- They don't spend all their time establishing that "Tywin did it" when this is actually a trivial and unimportant detail. How its revealed isn't relevant. What matters is Danys reaction to it and that they put time towards that. Its daft and silly enough that they're going with the Tywin hate mail as it is.
Â 
3- That Emilia Clarke does a good job this time. As I mentioned above, she needs to pull the scene off without looking melodramatic, schizophrenic or like an imperious bitch. However her acting lately has been really flagging and inconsistent lately. The same goes for Ian Glen of course, I hope he does a good job as well but in that scene Dany has to do a lot more and express a lot more nuanced emotion than Jorah. So the pressure is on Emilia Clarkes performance.
Â 
4- Remember that Dany and her reaction should be the focus of the scene; not Jorah. I am only adding this because I don't know why they would bother with details like him getting his things and being on the boat planning where to go.Â 
Â 
5- Have the Grey Worm/Missandei bath stuff be brief. They really don't have the time to properly develop this and it just feels irrelevant to what else is going in Danys story.
Â 
Still annoyed the show decided to cut Jorah kissing Dany, hopefully they can make his other important scene good. It'll certainly be overshadowed with the Vyper/Hound fight and I sort of feel like they should have done this in an earlier and less busy episode.

I can't imagine this Jorah refusing to apologize, and that's the only reason Dany banished him. She wanted to forgive him but he made it virtually impossible with his combative attitude.

Â 
I agree, especially in this season he is a completely different character. Jorah is the guy who even in the show said "Rhaegar died" for his honour but they've instead tossed that out and now hes the one telling Dany to be good and moral in her treatment of the slavers; something which she decides to do herself anyway. Jorah is a character who tells Dany to put aside her morals because its a cruel world and you want to win; not the other way around because suddenly Dany is a ruthless character in ADWD. Aside from that he loves Daenerys and shares the backstory he has very little in common with the book character.Â 
Â 
A lot hinges on Emilia Clarke. They need to convey that she feels utterly hurt and betrayed; especially because we the audience already know what Jorah did. If she does her whole "Queenly" act then she will look like an unreasonable bitch when really Jorahs the one being unreasonable by not accepting full blame ala books.Â

Yes we're really sure they're from episode 8.
5159	boojam	2014-05-27	Yes we're really sure they're from episode 8.No source was ever cited that I saw, some of those stills are obvious ... but that was from HBO?Why stills of the Hound and Arya and not of Brienne and Pod who I thought were in Ep 8?

Â 
There is no confirmation that Brienne and Pod are in E8, that's just fan speculation. They have been absent from both the promo and previously on.
5161	Arkash	2014-05-27	Really curious about the dialogue that will take place at the Bloody Gate. I wonder how the Hound will manage it there ? Will he say straight away he has Arya Stark (I doubt it) ? Or will they decide to turn around when they hear Lysa's dead ? Or will the Knighs of the Gate try to kill him on spot as soon as they recognize him ?
Â 
I really wonder how Arya and the Hound will get off tthe fight. Not easy to run away for this narrow path and if they have archers, it's gonna get messy !Â
5162	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	I don't think it's possible that either of them could escape alive if they fought them at the path itself. In the shots from the "weapons and training" video showing glimpses of the upcoming fight, they looked like they were on more of an elevated area. I think that they'll turn away but some Knights might go after them for some reason or another.

5163	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-27	How would she know that, and for that matter, how would you know that? Sansa Stark is wanted by the Crown for regicide. The Vale stayed out of the war. Yes, it was Lysa who decided not to get involved, but it's not like the lords from the Vale rebelled against her and proclaimed their desire to go to war on Robb's side. And that was when he was still alive. Why would Sansa assume that they are going to support her and, what, start a war against the Lannisters and their allies, Boltons and Freys, all on their own, since there is no Stark or Tully force now? And why? What does it have to do with the Vale? Why should they support her just because she's Sansa Stark, rather than turning her over to Tywin and Cersei, which they would demand as soon as they got word that Sansa is in the Vale - and something like that would be impossible to hide with lots of people knowing it?
Sansa announcing her identity at this point makes zero sense, just as it did in the book. She doesn't even know these people or what they want. At least with Littlefinger she knows that he wants to keep her alive and away from King's Landing. She's not trying to get support as his daughter/niece/whatever, she's trying to remain unnoticed and survive.
Â 
I hope not. It's bad enough that they've made LF and Margaery painfully obvious on the show. They should at least let Sansa retain the mask of a naive, scared young girl (which Sophie has said in interviews Sansa is doing, and which she was doing with Lysa) that he thinks he can mold into what he wants - which is her best chance to manipulate him, and others. It would be absurd if she was all "look at me, I'm a strong young woman who will take no shit from you!" just because some viewers would think it's cool.


Â 
Why would the Vale Lords support Sansa (and not turn her into the Lannisters)? Well, we should probably begin with the fact that the Vale Lords think it was the LANNISTERS who killed Jon Arryn. So, you know, there's that. Add onto that the fact that Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon were known and liked in the Vale when they were Jon Arryn's wards. There's also the fact that the Knights of the Vale were/are angry that Lysa did not assist Robb in his war (which indicates to me a loyalty to the Stark family), and I'm fairly certain the Vale Lords and Knights wouldn't be entirely comfortably with forking her over so easily. Also, weren't Bronze Royce and Ned Stark really good friends? I think I recall reading that. Why...pray tell, would Ned Stark's 'homeboy' hand over his daughter to the Lannisters (or let anyone else do it, for that matter)?Â 
Â 
And who said anything about anyone going to war? I personally didn't mention anything about anyone going to war for Sansa. I'm only talking about her revealing her true identity. Where you got this war business from is beyond me. ALTHOUGH....for conversation sake...isn't that Littlefinger's plan? To reveal her identity to everyone so that the Knights of the Vale will "fight to win back her birthright"? Maybe your question about why the Vale Lords would fight for Sansa should be directed to HIM. Hell, that's HIS idea.Â 
Â 
Also, I disagree. Sansa doesn't know what LF wants. Hell, NO ONE knows what he wants. Which is why we have copious amounts of topics discussing it. Futhermore, I would consider it a step UP (for her character) to take her own damn destiny into her hands (by revealing her own identity) rather than sit around and trust LF--or anyone else--to keep her "safe". I would have thought that as a Sansa 'fan', you'd prefer THAT outcome rather than a perpetual 'damsel in distress' characterization. I don't know, maybe some people are fine with Sansa sitting around, looking pretty, and playing stupid, but I'm not. Let her be a proactive player in her own life rather than a reactive participant to everyone else.

Brienne and Pod are not confirmed, Arya and the Hound are. The promo pictures come from HBO and the episode is listed on their website with a picture of Arya that also appears in these photo sets.
5165	Colonel Green	2014-05-27	And who said anything about anyone going to war? I personally didn't mention anything about anyone going to war for Sansa. I'm only talking about her revealing her true identity. Where you got this war business from is beyond me. ALTHOUGH....for conversation sake...isn't that Littlefinger's plan?

Maybe your question about why the Vale Lords would fight for Sansa should be directed to HIM. Hell, that's HIS idea.


Revealing Sansa's identity in a public forum this large (apparently consisting of a large assemblage of the nobility) would be impossible to keep secret (much the same as in the books).Â  The Lannisters would demand her return.Â  Based on their characterization I think Royce and at least some of the others would feel honour-bound to say no, but that would lead to another phase of the war, this time in the Vale of Arryn.Â  It's not something Sansa would bank on happening (and based on her own characterization at this point, I don't think she's looking to personally initiate a new round of bloodshed).
Â 
It is Littlefinger's plan, which Sansa doesn't know about, but Littlefinger's plan also envisions the gradual weakening of the other side followed by convincing the Vale to enter the war.
5166	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	For all we know, all Sansa will tell them is that she's not his niece Alayne, she's his daughter Alayne and that's what LF lied about. They could spin it any number of ways from there.

5167	Colonel Green	2014-05-27	For all we know, all Sansa will tell them is that she's not his niece Alayne, she's his daughter Alayne and that's what LF lied about.


That speculation has become increasingly plausible, just because the "niece" change has seemed so totally inexplicable (the show has already had Littlefinger say she could have been his daughter like three seconds before kissing her, so even the idea that it was some totally arbitrary line in how creepy the show was willing to take that relationship doesn't really work now).
5168	Konradsmith	2014-05-27	In two of the three Sansa pictures released she's crying. I wonder why exactly, is it put-on as part of the Lords Declarant testimony ploy or does she have a reason to cry for real this episode?
Â 
I also wonder how they're gonna play the "so close but so far" business this episode. Will they have LF notice the two figures at the Bloody Gate and order the Knights to go after them (if he recognizes them). Will they have Sansa glimpse them and only recognize Sandor (mayhaps thinking Arya is his squire), prompting LF to jealously order the Hound killed? Who knows but there're some possibilities afoot.

5169	Ordos	2014-05-27	I'm really curious to see how the Moat Cailin thing will play out. Will Reek perhaps find the castle nearly empty and have at least a reference to Balon falling off a bridge?
Â 
I'd like that to happen on camera though but it is looking increasingly unlikely to happen this season.
Â 
Back to episode 8: If no reference to the rest of the Greyjoys, maybe Roose leading his remaining army up from the neck and congratulating Ramsay..
5170	Colonel Green	2014-05-27	Will they have LF notice the two figures at the Bloody Gate and order the Knights to go after them (if he recognizes them).


As set up in the previous episodes, the Eyrie is way too far away from the Gate for anything like that, even if there was direct line-of-sight.
Â 
I do wonder whether the Gate guards will recognize the Hound (he's supposed to be a fairly recognizable figure).Â  You would expect that Littlefinger at least would be told about something like that.
5171	King Tommen	2014-05-27	I highly doubt Moat Cailin will have anything to do with any Greyjoys outside of Theon. It will go down as it does in the books. People expecting some kind of Yara/Balon/Victarion shoutout will probably be disappointed.
Â 
The Yara/Balon stuff will be addressed in the finale IMO, as it should. We won't hear anything about uncles until the following season when they're ready to appear.
5172	jentario	2014-05-27	I really hope they don't put anything Lady Stoneheart related in the final episode recap. Ugh, I'm having bad visions of them putting Catelyn getting slit and then the Beric 'how many times have I been brought back' scene. It's so obvious now what's going down in each episode. I understand that not all the viewers can remember every little thing but I hope for that they have the sense to let that be the shocking reveal it should be (assuming it's actually in the finale).Â 
They put nothing Shae related in The Laws of Gods and Men recap, so have some hope. I'd imagine they'll just show Berric and not Cat. And they'll at the very least separate the scenes.
5173	Arkash	2014-05-27	I highly doubt Moat Cailin will have anything to do with any Greyjoys outside of Theon. It will go down as it does in the books. People expecting some kind of Yara/Balon/Victarion shoutout will probably be disappointed.

Â 
I dont know... Ralf Kennig is, supposedly, holding the Moat on the orders of Victarion. They could easily have him say to Theon : "Your uncle orders are to hold the Moat, we cant leave it like that" or something in those lines.
5174	Seneti	2014-05-28	Not sure if someone's already linked to these, but several promotional photos for "The Mountain and the Viper" have just been posted by SpoilerTV. http://www.spoilertv... and the Viper/

Â 
Sweet. Indira looks gorgeous in those shots, not to mention the details in the costumes... *swoon*
Â 


I've written a list of all the events that happened in book 3 that have yet to happen in season 4. As they happen in the remaining episodes, I will cross them off.
Â 
It really looks like there will actually be book 3 material in season 5! Shows you how much a beast of a book it is.
Â 
Â 
Here is the list:
Â 
Gregor vs. Oberyn (next episode obviously)
Â 
Tyrion escapes and kills Tywin and Shae
Â 
Battle on the Wall both north and south. Ygritte dies. Stannis to the rescue.
Â 
Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander
Â 
Arya leaves The Hound
Â 
Balon falls off a bridge
Â 
Jorah is banished
Â 
Lady Stoneheart
Â 
Where is Rickon? (not so much the book but sources say he will appear this season)
Â 
Coldhands and Bloodraven (Bloodraven is in book 5 but again sources say he'll appear but I know Coldhands has been cut)


Â 
Episode 8:Â Gregor vs. Oberyn (next episode obviously),Â Jorah is banished, possiblyÂ Arya leaves The Hound
Episode 9:Â Battle on the Wall both north and south. Ygritte dies. Stannis to the rescue.
Episode 10: Tyrion escapes and kills Tywin and Shae, Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander, Arya leaves The Hound (if it didn't happen in ep. 8), Jorah is banished, Lady Stoneheart, Bloodraven.
Â 
Balon falls off a bridge will most likely happen either at the beginning of next season, or it will be mentioned by the guards at Moat Cailin next episode. Coldhands has been cut.
Â 


http://m.youtube.com...h?v=c-v7DP7t4uw
Recap is out.


Â 
Woohoo! So, Jorah is definitely getting banished. Can't wait. I'm also really looking forward to Gilly's story.
Â 


So I think we can safely predict that this will be the order of the scenes:
Â 
1-Attack on Mole's Town and reaction at Castle Black
2-Some romantic scene between Grey Worm and Missandei
3-Moat Cailin
4-Lords Declarant in the Eyrie
5-Jorah is banished
6-Oberyn vs Mountain duel


Â 
We know Sandor and Arya are going to appear, too, possibly before or after the Lords Declarant. Other than that... sounds about right.
Â 


I highly doubt Moat Cailin will have anything to do with any Greyjoys outside of Theon. It will go down as it does in the books. People expecting some kind of Yara/Balon/Victarion shoutout will probably be disappointed.
Â 
The Yara/Balon stuff will be addressed in the finale IMO, as it should. We won't hear anything about uncles until the following season when they're ready to appear.


Â 
Either this, or were going to get something like this:
Â 
Reek: I am Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon Greyjoy, heir to the II!
Random II soldier: Balon Greyjoys dead.
Reek: Â Â 
Â 
But, yeah, only introducing that plot line next season certainly makes more sense.
5175	Ordos	2014-05-28	Episode 8:Â Gregor vs. Oberyn (next episode obviously),Â Jorah is banished, possiblyÂ Arya leaves The Hound
Episode 9:Â Battle on the Wall both north and south. Ygritte dies. Stannis to the rescue.
Episode 10: Tyrion escapes and kills Tywin and Shae, Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander, Arya leaves The Hound (if it didn't happen in ep. 8), Jorah is banished, Lady Stoneheart, Bloodraven.
Â 
Balon falls off a bridge will most likely happen either at the beginning of next season, or it will be mentioned by the guards at Moat Cailin next episode. Coldhands has been cut.

I read the list of cast members on the Season 4 Game of Thrones Wikipedia page earlier this year. Page might have been updated since.
5178	Konradsmith	2014-05-28	^Art Parkinson did film in Belfast at the same time as GoT shooting but some people say that was for a Dracula movie. I also think he lives there too, so there's that. I can't see how he could possibly show up but who knows.
5179	Father of Dragons	2014-05-28	Game of Thrones wiki is a Wikipedia for Game of Thrones. That means it's also just as unreliable. I remember after episode 4, the wiki seemed to be obsessed with the white walker appearances. They were very confident in saying "The White Walker that appeared at the end of the episode is none other than the dreaded Night's King." Despite the change on the HBO guide changing just a few hours later  the wiki didn't change it for a few days.
Anyway, my point (which I probably should have started with) is that the wiki is filled in by people just like us, with no prior knowledge to what happens on the show, it's all speculation. Clearly, they got the Rickon info from somewhere, and I assume it was a sighting, of shooting another movie or just living nearby, as Konradsmith suggested.
If he was on fact filming for Game of Thrones, it might be a deleted or unused scene, like the one for Lysa and Robin last year.
5180	SM4e	2014-05-28	I highly doubt Moat Cailin will have anything to do with any Greyjoys outside of Theon. It will go down as it does in the books. People expecting some kind of Yara/Balon/Victarion shoutout will probably be disappointed.

Natalia Tena has hinted (but never confirmed) that she she has a scene this season, which implies Rickon as well.
Also, she was added to the cast list of episode 10 in IMDB, we just don't know if it was her agent who added her or some random speculating fan.

5189	Annara Snow	2014-05-28	Â 
Why would the Vale Lords support Sansa (and not turn her into the Lannisters)? Well, we should probably begin with the fact that the Vale Lords think it was the LANNISTERS who killed Jon Arryn. So, you know, there's that. Add onto that the fact that Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon were known and liked in the Vale when they were Jon Arryn's wards. There's also the fact that the Knights of the Vale were/are angry that Lysa did not assist Robb in his war (which indicates to me a loyalty to the Stark family), and I'm fairly certain the Vale Lords and Knights wouldn't be entirely comfortably with forking her over so easily. Also, weren't Bronze Royce and Ned Stark really good friends? I think I recall reading that. Why...pray tell, would Ned Stark's 'homeboy' hand over his daughter to the Lannisters (or let anyone else do it, for that matter)?Â 


Â 
He visited Winterfell once, that hardly makes him "Ned Stark homeboy". The Knight of the Vale may have thought Lysa should assist Robb and her father and brother in the war, but Robb is dead and Edmure is a prisoner and there is no Stark or Tully army now to assist. The North is in the hands of the Boltons and the Riverlands are in the hands of the Freys, all Lannister allies. And the Vale lords aren't from the North, they aren't Stark bannermen, and experience has shown that even your own bannermen can't be trusted. Heck, even your own family can't be trusted, as Sansa has come to know. And even if some like Bronze Yohn could be trusted (though I don't know why Sansa would trust someone she's seen once in her entire life), they are hardly a monolith, it's not like some other Vale lord couldn't betray her. Plus it would be naive to think that there are no spies around (Varys', for starters) and no one who would try to betray her to the Crown for gold or some other reason.
Â 

Â 
And who said anything about anyone going to war? I personally didn't mention anything about anyone going to war for Sansa. I'm only talking about her revealing her true identity. Where you got this war business from is beyond me.

Â 
Uh, the Lannisters would? Because they wouldn't react well to Sansa Stark, a "traitor" wanted for the murder of king Joffrey, being in the Vale under the protection of the Vale lords. An information like that can't remain hidden.
Â 

Â 
ALTHOUGH....for conversation sake...isn't that Littlefinger's plan? To reveal her identity to everyone so that the Knights of the Vale will "fight to win back her birthright"? Maybe your question about why the Vale Lords would fight for Sansa should be directed to HIM. Hell, that's HIS idea.

Â 
No. Littlefinger's idea is that she should betroth and be about to marry Harry, future lord of the Vale (i.e. lord of the Vale, when SR dies, since LF's plan includes SR dying before Sansa's marriage) - which would mean that the Knights of the Vale would fight to win the birthright of the future Lady of the Vale for the benefit of the future son and heir to the house of Arryn that she will be expected to give birth to. That would give the Vale lords an interest in the matter. Why else does LF's plan include Sansa marrying Harry? Why doesn't he just tell her she will reveal her identity and everyone would fight to win back her birthright?
Also, LF's plans is supposed to come to fruition in future at a time when the Lannisters are considerably weakened, which has been gradually happening with Tywin's death andÂ  Cersei's fuck-ups - and LF is monitoring that situation, he has his spies near Cersei. That's not the case at this point, with Tywin still very much alive.
Â 
(And even that's if we assume that LF is telling the truth to Sansa and that he really expects the Vale lords to be ready to go to war the moment they learn that.)
Â 

Â 
Also, I disagree. Sansa doesn't know what LF wants. Hell, NO ONE knows what he wants. Which is why we have copious amounts of topics discussing it.

Â 
Nah. We have a pretty good idea about some of the things he wants, as does Sansa. He wants to fuck her, for one thing, and fulfill his fantasy about her as both Cat replacement and his and Cat's imaginary daughter. But he wants her to accept him and want him, which is why he's trying to groom her, so he won't outright rape her. He also wants to use Sansa as a political pawn in his own schemes and power grabs. We don't know the details, but we - and Sansa - know that his plans and desires, both political and personal/sexual, depend on Sansa staying alive and not being sent to KL to lose her head.
Â 

Â 
Futhermore, I would consider it a step UP (for her character) to take her own damn destiny into her hands (by revealing her own identity) rather than sit around and trust LF--or anyone else--to keep her "safe". I would have thought that as a Sansa 'fan', you'd prefer THAT outcome rather than a perpetual 'damsel in distress' characterization.

Â 
As a Sansa fan (I don't know what a Sansa 'fan' is), I want her to take her own damn destiny into her hands. But certainly not by revealing her own identity at this point, since that would mean she is either an idiot, or suicidal. And as a Sansa fan (as opposed to a Sansa 'fan') I know she's neither. Not being an idiot who gets oneself killed =/= being a perpetual damsel in distress. "Playing stupid" is a her best way to stay alive and manipulate people - although the show doesn't seem to understand that, since every schemer in the show is practically announcing in every scene: "Look at me! I'm dangerous! I'm a player! I'm manipulating people! Look at how cool I am!" It makes you wonder how Littlefinger or Margaery are ever able to fool anyone. At least Sansa has escaped that fate so far.
Â 

Â 
I don't know, maybe some people are fine with Sansa sitting around, looking pretty, and playing stupid, but I'm not. Let her be a proactive player in her own life rather than a reactive participant to everyone else.

Â 
You sound like one of those people who think that Sansa was weak and stupid for not telling off Joffrey and Cersei or for not fighting her way out of King's Landing. You must really dislike Sansa and be frustrated with her behavior in the books, since she is not revealing herself to the Vale lords or anyone else in the Eyrie in AFFC.

5190	Arkash	2014-05-28	From the Pycelle promo pic, we can safely say that he'll be the one giving a speech before the duel happens. Something like in the name of Tommen Baratheon, titles, titles... and that now only the Gods can judge the men.
5191	boojam	2014-05-28	Uh, the Lannisters would? Because they wouldn't react well to Sansa Stark, a "traitor" wanted for the murder of king Joffrey, being in the Vale under the protection of the Vale lords. An information like that can't remain hidden.Right.In the books , if logic prevailed, ... and maybe it will, I don't see how in the world, in the long run, LF's ass is not grass. The fact that he spirited Sansa away can not be kept a secret forever, I just don't see it. When that becomes known, it's not just the Lannisters, or the Vale, it's many others in Westeros who can put two and two together, hell even HighGarden would want to pin regicide on him to get rid of him. I don't think he holds any ace on them, and they outrank him by light years.Don't know what George plans to do, maybe the Others finally threaten the south and all bets are off?
5192	salvatoredamon90	2014-05-28	Game of Thrones wiki is a Wikipedia for Game of Thrones. That means it's also just as unreliable. I remember after episode 4, the wiki seemed to be obsessed with the white walker appearances. They were very confident in saying "The White Walker that appeared at the end of the episode is none other than the dreaded Night's King." Despite the change on the HBO guide changing just a few hours later the wiki didn't change it for a few days.
Anyway, my point (which I probably should have started with) is that the wiki is filled in by people just like us, with no prior knowledge to what happens on the show, it's all speculation. Clearly, they got the Rickon info from somewhere, and I assume it was a sighting, of shooting another movie or just living nearby, as Konradsmith suggested.
If he was on fact filming for Game of Thrones, it might be a deleted or unused scene, like the one for Lysa and Robin last year.


There was no scene filmed with Lysa and Robin last year, it was rumored by the same people that said that Uncat was supposed to be the final scene in season 3, for some reason it stuck even though it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, why would they film scenes with them last year when they aren't supposed to be important until this point in this story, GOT is not a tv show that brings people and pays them to shoot scenes and then deletes them for no reason. The Mad King scene was something special because this was before they made the no flashbacks rule in the show, so leaving that one scene would have been weird .

Littlefinger plans to topple anybody who would care about him killing Joffrey in the long-term, as I think should be obvious from his plans by this point.
5194	FNF	2014-05-28	Honestly,I think Sansa's plot is going to brought forward by a long way. We know that the Eyrie set was brought down after filming ended so that makes it likely that they will begin the descent from the Eyrie next season. Now, if that means Sansa will confess to the Lords of the Vale that sheÂ is Sansa Stark next episode? I'm not sure. All I will say though is that I find it unlikely that Sansa will hand Littlfinger's ass to the Lords next episode and other than her confessing to be Sansa, I don't see what else she could be confessing to...

She's spinning some cover story about Lysa.Â  That's fairly obvious.

Considering how many of his enemies he's already destroyed, and with the Lannister-Tyrell alliance well on its way to combustion, I'd hardly say he's overestimating his chances (not that I think his plan will work out, of course, but he's got no reason to think that suddenly now things are going to stop going his way when he's more powerful than ever and his enemies have never been weaker).

In Alayne II, a Feast for Crows, she leaves the Eyrie and descends to the Gates of the Moon, as the Eyrie is closed for the Winter due to the difficulty of getting foodstuffs and other supplies up there in the snow.
So if they dismantle the Eyrie this season, either they are descending the the Gates of the Moon this season (which appears to be the Bloody Gate in the show.) or they are just cutting the descent and will mention next season why they have moved elsewhere (since the path to the Eyrie is never focused on in the show, I doubt they would spend long on them leaving. Just a shot of the Eyrie household heading down the path, with Sansa giving a last look back to the eyrie. Could even be the last shot of Season 4 for Sansa)

The Lannister-Tyrell alliance will cease to exist before to long, as I think should be obvious to most people.Â  The Lannisters are all but a spent force, and the Tyrells are engaged on multiple fronts.Â  He's evidently quite aware of what's happening in the East.Â  As to the North, we haven't seen his reaction yet (but the numbers of men involved in the Northern war are at this point quite miniscule in comparison to everywhere else in Westeros).
Â 
Again, I'm not saying nothing will go wrong; things almost certainly will.Â  But it's silly to say that Littlefinger's plans are dumb, considering all his other plans to date have gone off pretty much without a hitch.

The Bloody Gate appears to fulfill much of the gatekeeping function of the Gates of the Moon, but the GotM's location isn't terribly relevant.Â  They'd just need to say "we're moving the Arryns' winter castle, which is over here".

Stannis had about 5000 men, less now after being stuck in the snow so long.Â  Roose has something in the area of 7-8000 men, though many of those of dubious loyalty.
Â 
We know that Littlefinger is already preparing for the War of Three Queens, one of whom is very likely Dany.

Â 
Â 
The only bad thing about the long holiday weekend was no newÂ Game of Thrones! What's up with Sansa now that Littlefinger killed her aunt?Â â<U+0080><U+0094> GeorgiaBecause she's the only witness to what happened to the Lady Regent of the Vale, the eldest Stark daughter is suddenly thrust into a position of power. AsÂ this previewÂ implies, Sansa holds Littlefinger's fate in her hands. But will she actually testify against the man who helped her escape King's Landing? Let's just say that her choice will show exactly how far she's come in playing the game.
Â 
Glad to see TV Sansa will be more pro-active than Book Sansa, well at least that what it sounds like from this.
5211	Colonel Green	2014-05-28	Is HBO giving out any advance information on the final episodes, or is that just an assumption based on what happened in the books?

yes they have. they get advanced screenings and/or spoilers from the shows. they are generally right. but idt Sansa will testify against LF, it would be a dumb thing to do, even if planned. i guess we will see her struggling to do the right thing but in the end she will lie to safe her life and LF.

5222	jentario	2014-05-28	If Littlefinger tries to say Lysa fell by accident or something, Sansa could say he's lying and that she was a crazy bitch for awhile, so crazy that she decided to kill herself. The Vale lords know she was exactly that, so they would definitely buy that.
Â 
Also, I would LOVE for Sansa to say that she is his bastard daughter as a rebellious act to tell Littlefinger where the boundaries are.
5223	Le Cygne	2014-05-28	I don't think that particular boundary is a problem for Littlefinger.

Yes, but it's her way of saying "no".
This is the first time he's tried anything with her in the show, she still doesn't know how rapey he is and how much he doesn't care...

Well, alone no. But I meant that would just be one part of it. She tells something contrary to Lf's account, only it doesn't implicate him. For example, LF tells them Lysa fell, Sansa says "No, she was distraught over this that and this and killed herself." or something like that. She could even says Lysa was distraught over the death of Cat, and while talking about her family was overcome with emotion or something. That way she gets the Vale Lords sympathetic towards the Starks. Again, just an example, but my broad suggestion is that she spins a lie that contradicts LF's version of event, without incriminating him
5229	jentario	2014-05-28	I think the Vale lords will call Littlefinger out on his bullshit, so Sansa will have to say he lied a bit there to cover his ass. Time will tell.

It's possible there are extras there to serve for other lords, but there haven't been any other known castings, and none of them are really needed -- those three are the ones with actual roles in the story (if they don't actually cover all AFFC Alayne I, I'm surprised they cast Corbray at all for this year).

I wasn't suggesting that Littlefinger would be averse to it.Â  I think it's all prearranged (though the show might have Sansa make the second story up on the spot, which would make Littlefinger look rather dumb).
5244	xanman	2014-05-28	I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this before but I was thinking about the title a bit more today and how it applies to this episode now that we know more about what will be in it. At first I thought "The Mountain and the Viper" was too obvious and only applied to the trial by combat. After some contemplation however, I feel it applies to all of the stories in this episode in one way or another. I'll break it down briefly per storyline:
Â 
-Kings Landing
Â 
The Mountain: Gregor Clegane
Â 
The Viper: Oberyn Martell
Â 
-The Vale
(two stories here)
Â 
The Mountain: 1. The Eyrie
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  2. The whole Vale (represented by the Lords Declarant)
Â 
The Viper: 1. The Hound and Arya trying to get into the Vale
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  2. Petyr Baelish
Â 
-Dreadfort
Â 
The Mountain: Moat Calin
Â 
The Viper: Theon Greyjoy
Â 
-Meereen
Â 
The Mountain: Dany on her throne (arguably her whole pyramid is the mountain)
Â 
The Viper: Ser Jorah 'FriendZone' Mormont
Â 
-The North
Â 
The Mountain: The Wall
Â 
The Viper: The Wildlings
Â 
Â 
I may be way off base here but after thinking about it like this I warmed up to the title and enjoy it now. It also isn't too big of a spoiler for Unsullied because Oberyn hasn't even been called The Red Viper by anyone yet.

I haven;t read through the whole thread, has anyone suggested that she might simply admit her true identity to the Lords Declarant, in this version of the story Lord Robert does know he she is, Lysa told him. She might say that Lysa got drunk and they started talking and she started feeling guilty for not supporting her family, the Starks and the Tullys out of fear for her child but she that she had promised Sansa that she would help her, that she must help her, but when they started talking about Cat and her brother Edmure, she went mad and jumped out of the Moon Door. Not sure it will go exactly like that but something like that would make sense. The fact that Robert can confirm her identity will seal the deal and LF can say, "Hey, when Lysa was here she could have gotten us involved in the war, married Robert to Sansa but I must act more cautiously and I will do nothing without you consulting you Lord Declarants and will hold off until I have your full support" or something to that effect which will eliminate his motive, nominally his power will be less than what it was when Lysa was alive and nominally he will be beholden to the Declarants in order to stay in power.

She might say that Lysa got drunk and they started talking and she started feeling guilty for not supporting her family, the Starks and the Tullys out of fear for her child but she that she had promised Sansa that she would help her, that she must help her, but when they started talking about Cat and her brother Edmure, she went mad and jumped out of the Moon Door. Not sure it will go exactly like that but something like that would make sense.

The big theory we've been discussing is that Sansa confesses to being Littlefinger's bastard daughter rather than his niece, and that Lysa killed herself when she found out.

Although they could go in a number of different directions, I'd be ok with it playing out this way as it's more than plausible.

Difficulty confirming it was never the issue.Â  The suggestion has been made, but it makes very little sense for the story, since everybody else not knowing who Sansa is (or maybe knowing and nudging around the issue) looks to be rather important.Â  It would also be rather difficult to keep secret.
Â

Yeah, that's a good point (though that may fall into one of the logic holes that emerge when changes are made).
5251	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-28	Lord Baelish has told many lies.
Â 
I have to tell the truth.
Â 
It was not his fault that Lady Lysa killed herself.Â 
Â 
Something about drinking too much, grief, maybe throw in a tidbit of Sweetrobin having his illness (maybe in the show it's traumatic moments that causes it and he can't remember it was LF who did it...might be a stretch I know).
Â 
Regardless I'm interested in how it plays out. Though a bit sad that the way it looks we won't have LF's amazing speeches with Sansa about his plans (especially the Corbray scenario over 'bewitching them")

Given that they cast Corbray, one assumes they will do that one.

5256	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-05-28	So, I know everyone's on the lords declarant talking point atm, but I'm pretty sure I know what's going to go down in Meereen. We know we have Jorah getting banished, and it's most likely due to the letter that Tywin sent. We also know that we have a scene with Missandei bathing and the promo shows the scene with Missandei and Grey Worm.Â 
Â 
In that scene, we have Missandei teaching Grey Worm how to read. I believe Grey Worm must be the one to receive the letter, and take it to Missandei (whom he finds naked, and something probably happens there), but the information gets relayed to Dany through them. That would tie in the GW/Missandei scene, and it'll show that the letter wasn't sent directly to Dany.
5257	Goldfinger	2014-05-28	Sansa says:"Lord Petyr Baelish was already married....with me!"
Good enough for Lysa to go flying. ...

If Jorah is banished this episode, she has only Barristan , Grey Worm, Daario and Missandei. In Dance the Shavepates showed up , even tho not former slaves really seemed loyal to Dany. So will Skahaz mo Kandaq show up next season? I guess the show will follow the Daario hostage story. There are , I think, five companies of former slaves who one would think would stay loyal to Danny. The show has fustercluked the Sellswords all around , I don't know why Second Sons is a better name to keep than Stromcrows, unless it's another one of those inane name phobias the show has about people becoming confused about 'Crows' and 'Stormcrows'? Will Barristan form Ruling council of Meereen when Dany disappears?A ton of narrative , which has to be streamlined from Dance, takes place in Meereen. In fact putting Feast and Dance together, KL recedes to the background.All this is going require some imaginative invention.The curse of trying to tell this story in 10 ~ one hour bites a year.

We then.have a new commander of the Second Sons rise the ranks, one Brown Ben Plumm (or equivilent) who.defects and joins the Yunkish and other Slavers after Dany looks set to lose.
I think if we dont get any of the former Meereenese nobilty (Skahaz in particular) then we will have Hizdhar as Dany's loyal man. Possibly

I think Balon falling off the bridge works perfectly as a cold opening to next season- better for both Yara and the Kingsmoot in my opinion.


I actually think the cold open for next season will be Maggy the Frog's prophecy. I read somewhere that she has been cast (or the show runners are currently looking to cast her - can't remember which!), and since the show never does flashbacks, the only place I can see her scene fitting in comfortably is in a cold open.
Maggy's prophecy would also be a great way to start the season, thematically. Â We'll be seeingÂ downfalls of a lot of characters in season 5 (Jon, Dany, Cersei) and the prophecy ties in well with those depositions. Â

I agree. If it IS going to be a flashback, it has to happen in the cold open, before the credits. It would fit nowhere else. If it's just rearranged to be in the present, than it can be anywhere.

Â 
How? Grey Worm is getting close to Missandei, that only makes it less likely. If he is going to cuddle with someone, it would be her, he would have no need to go to prostitutes.
Â 
It does make sense though that Grey Worm has desires for intimacy/romance, he was the one who told Dany about Stallwart Shield and that not having a man parts does not mean not having a man's heart - it sounded like he knew what he was talking about and could understand Stallwart Shield.
Â 
And he's not Missandei's brother in the book, not that we know of, anyway. (Would she be able to recognize any of her brothers? I've been wondering about that.)
Â 
Â 


^If so then he'd be more her "cuddler" than her lover. But that's a possibility for sure.


Â 
Well, "lover" can mean someone in a romantic relationship with someone, not necessarily in a sexual relationship. And technically, the word is "lover", not "sexer" or "fucker", so he could still be her lover.
Â 


First , in the books it's not even "or something", Missandei does have two brothers in the Unsullied, but, so far, in the books, Grey Worm is not one of them, nor do I think he will ever be.

EDIT: Yeah, here...http://insidetv.ew.c...-fourth-season/
"Further on in a few episodes, theres going to be the biggest fight Ive ever seen. Its going to go on for so long, you wouldnt believe. Theres going to be so much blood and guts, and I cant wait for everyone to see it. Theres going to be some right shockers  people wouldnt even imagine whats going to happen. Its funny how the fans think they know whats going to happen, and then theres going to be a right angle turn, and theyre going to either think its great or go, What the hell is going on?

If I remember correctly, Missandei was heartbroken and cried a river when one of her brothers was killed by the sons of the harpy, so yes, she is able to recognize them. Also, as pointed out byÂ HelenaAndTheMachine, the books tell us who her brothers are. Stalwart Shield and Grey Worm are totally unrelated to book-Missandei.

Â 
Well, one theory is that "king's blood" is actually just Valyrian blood, and that Melisandre doesn't really believe Mance or his child truly have "king's blood".
Â 
My theory has always been that "king's blood" is about perception; power resides where men believe it resides, and thus magic is about the perceptions of the performer. Dany believed khal Drogo was a king, and she also believed Rhaego to be the true king of Westeros; hence when she walked into the pyre using their deaths to awaken the dragons, it worked because she believed both of them died as kings.
Â 
But anyway, the show's use of Gendry and the leeches means they've already established the belief that there's power in the blood of kings. Cutting the baby swap just simplifies the plot slightly and takes away some of Jon's authority and ruthlessness.

Â 
I'm pretty sure Martin's intent in having Drogo and Mance count as having King's Blood is to reinforce the notion of power residing where men believe it resides. There is nothing special about a king save for the people that follow him and if Melisandre could get people to follow some random schlub then she wouldÂ be able to use his blood.Â So no offence but I think you've rather missed the entire point of all that.

Â 
Well it keeps being called "King's Blood" which appears to infer that the person has to be declared the King of something. And just about anyone can do that. It's a loophole and probably not entirely that well thought out. I don't think Mel has mentioned anything about Drogo and I don't think he was supposed to wield any kind of mythical power within his lineage. The whole thing with Dany walking in the pyre is pretty clearly not to do with Drogo or Rhaego, it's that she's a Targaryen and certain members of this line have an affinity to fire and a connection to it. Â It has nothing to do with Mel's "King's Blood" pronouncements.
Â 
And if this "power resides where men believe it resides" is supposed to be the prevailing theory, then why is it only limited to Kings? Doesn't the LC of the NW have power amongst his men? The High Septon? The heads of the Iron Bank? There's power everywhere all over this world so I don't think this theory flies at all. How many people have to follow this individual for their blood to suddenly have magical properties? Does it get passed on to their children after they become powerful or does it still work if they come into power after the kids are born?
Â 
It's a silly notion and the less the show delves into it the better. I'm betting Martin doesn't really follow through on it much in the remaining books anyways.

Â 
Drogo very much is related to the Kings Blood stuff. Mel is attempting to use Kings Blood to "wake dragons from stone" after all, and if we interpret Khal Drogo as a king that is exactly what Dany does. Now obviously anyone can call themselves King but people aren't necessary going to follow anyone who names themselves King. That's the key. As for why any prominent leader can't be used I would argue that is because the concept of a King (or it's cultural equivalent e.g a Khal) holds a position above that of a simple LC or High Septon.Â 
Â 
If you think it's a silly concept then that's fine, but it's a concept which Martin is clearly using. It seems rather arrogant to say "well I think it's stupid soÂ surelyÂ Martin will ditch it in the last two books."
5291	aussiegirl	2014-05-29	Regarding Arya and the Hound, if the knights of the vale do attack there is really no way that either could survive, particularly Arya. She has no armor and she's tiny. We have also seen her in a scene where she is riding her horse in a rocky area and has no injuries.
Â 
To keep it realistic, I was wondering if somehow they accept that she is a Stark, say yes to them going through the gate but then only let Arya through. That way she would be out of the fight but it would also anger her towards the people at the Vale.
Â 
She somehow escapes without ever getting to the Eyrie and finding out that Sansa is there.
Â 
Audience gets to get angry about another near miss Stark reunion, Hound presumed dead and Arya heads towards her next storyline.
5292	King Tommen	2014-05-29	I'm going by the fact that the show appears to be jettisoning the Mance baby entirely. If it was important in the books, they'd keep it in. Gilly's going to have a baby with her, they just decided to make it her own (it appears).
Â 
And the whole "Drogo is the one that made the dragons hatch" notion is really strange. Is this a thing? Dany's a Taragaryen and therefore has a special connection with dragons through her lineage. What the hell does Drogo have to do with that?

5293	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-29	I had a very different take on all this...
Â 
iv never believed in "power in king's blood"...I definitely agree "only death can pay for life"....Targs have power in their blood from the magic of old valyria...Starks have it from the First men which likely came from the Children of the Forest
Â 
Melisandre burning the leeches worked (at times I like to believe it was one of her R'hollors true powers others i think it was just coincidence) because of the Targ blood Baratheons are said to have...Starks warging and greenseers are clear indication of CotF magic...Jojen has it probably like other northerners because they too mixed with CotF like the Starks...i have a theory that its stronger and more noticeable in the stark children because the direwolves somehow brought the connection to their magic out...
Â 
Dany's magic, combination of Valyrian blood plus "only death can pay for life" brought 3 dragons to life...im sure over the yrs plenty of others tried to hatch dragon eggs like Euron, at least one or more must have tried human sacrifices (judging by melisandres obsession with burning roberts bastard to awake the dragon at Dragonstone and what we know about some of the mad Targ kings)...
but something about Danys valyrian blood magic must have been what made it work...she had no reason to walk in to that pyre other than to prove to a bunch of rag tag dothraki that fire cannot hurt her...must have been some deep buried instinct that made her walk in to the flame giving the dragons life....
Â 
stuff like House of Black and White...i wouldn't classify what they can do as magic, more skill and science...like the potions arya was made to drink...however, House of Undying...that was clearly magic...Qauithe, must be magic...the maegi who caused khal drogos infection(dancing with shadow demons), must be magic (perhaps her magical blood also contributed to dragons birth?)
Â 
so its probably safe to say that across the narrow sea, Essos and the rest, there's genuine magic there that does not have anything to do with Targ or Stark blood...might be from old Valyria, might be something else?
5294	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-29	oh and Mel wanting to burn Mance's baby, thats just pure desperation cuz she's out of options...grasping at straws...
Â 
i rmr even Jon thinking that Mance was no king, his son wouldn't have any real "kings blood"...
Â 
but she might also be under the impression that wildlings have stronger concentration of magic in their blood from CotF or giants or such...
Â 
i dont believe burning Mance's kid would have any stronger effect than sacrificing the real rattleshirt
5295	King Tommen	2014-05-29	Yeah, I'm a fan of fantasy and understand the necessity for magic to be a part of these stories in order to drive the plot. But if you're going to have magic in your story, you need to define the rules for it very specifically for your audience so that you aren't cheating. Letting magic dictate things too often as a plot device runs the risk of making magic into your convenient deus ex machina, which cheapens your story at the end of the day.
Â 
"King's blood" in the books is way too vague a notion. Either define what the hell you mean by it or don't let it dictate your endgame to a significant degree.
5296	TommenIV	2014-05-29	I'm thinking we will see Melisandre burn Mance and perhaps some Wildlings early on in S5, leading Jon to rush Aemon out of Castle Black, along with Sam (and Pyp?). I could see Sam deciding on his own to take Gilly with him, not wanting to leave her yet again after whatever happens in Moletown.

Â 
Martin specifically disagrees. He's said before that he hates giving magic defined rules. It's a juggling act, but seeing as almost all of Martin's magic is a problem and not a solution, or else comes at a heavy cost I think it works fine.
5298	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-29	I'm going by the fact that the show appears to be jettisoning the Mance baby entirely. If it was important in the books, they'd keep it in. Gilly's going to have a baby with her, they just decided to make it her own (it appears).
Â 
And the whole "Drogo is the one that made the dragons hatch" notion is really strange. Is this a thing? Dany's a Taragaryen and therefore has a special connection with dragons through her lineage. What the hell does Drogo have to do with that?


Â 
Dany believes that Drogo, Mirri and Rhaego paid for the lives of the dragons.Â 
Â 
Melisandre and her followers believe that two kings are required "to wake the dragon" - the father first and then the son, so both die kings. If Melisandre is correct, it would mean Dany's dragons required two kings to hatch: Drogo, who Dany believed was the great Khal, and Rhaego, who Dany believed was the king of Westeros.Â 
Â 
It's ultimately Dany who wakes the dragons, of course. But in a conversation about Mance's baby and the idea of "king's blood" being a necessary component to wake the dragons, it is important to look at who Dany sacrificed.
Â 
(Personally I believe Melisandre's idea that two kings are needed to wake dragons from stone is all just misinterpretation, as per usual. Two "kings", father and son, were sacrificed to wake Dany's dragons, so perhaps she "sees" that in a vision (or in a prophecy, whatever) and assumes that it is some kind of formula to wake dragons rather than just being part of a process in one particular scenario that has already passed.)

Â 
GRRM has always said that he doesn't want his magic to have clear rules - it's supposed to be instinctive and mysterious. But that doesn't mean it is a "convenient deus ex machina" - his magic always has limits, and it always has a price (Dany paid dearly for her dragons, and she continues to pay dearly for them; however, UnCat is probably the best example).
5299	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-29	This episode is going to be fantastic.Â 
Â 
- Arya & The Hound attempting to enter the Vale, with Sandor being mortally injured.
- Theon negotiating the surrender of Moat Cailin.
- Attack on Mole's Town, with Jon & Sam realizing that the battle is nigh.
- Dany banishing Jorah; Greyworm & Missandei's 'relationship' being touched upon.Â 
- Follow-up on Littlefinger murdering Lysa, with Sansa testifying to the Lords of the Vale.
- Oberyn versus The Mountain.Â
5300	Father of Dragons	2014-05-29	So this is the effect of a two-week break. A topic starts and ends in a page, and four pages later someone else has brings it up, with a few unrelated things. Damn you, HBO.
5301	Annara Snow	2014-05-29	Â 
Â 
Dany believes that Drogo, Mirri and Rhaego paid for the lives of the dragons.Â 
Â 
Melisandre and her followers believe that two kings are required "to wake the dragon" - the father first and then the son, so both die kings. If Melisandre is correct, it would mean Dany's dragons required two kings to hatch: Drogo, who Dany believed was the great Khal, and Rhaego, who Dany believed was the king of Westeros.Â

Â 


Â 
But Rhaego was not sacrificed to wake Dany's dragons, in even the broadest definition. He had been sacrificed to save Drogo/bring him to life. I don't see how he could have been already sacrificed for Drogo, and then, already dead, sacrificed for the dragons.
Â 
It's pretty questionable with Drogo, too, since Dany killed him because he was a vegetable, but I guess one could assume that she already knew she would burn him to hatch dragons so this can just squeak through as a sacrifice for dragons. However, Rhaego as a sacrifice for dragons just can't work. If only death pays for life, then one can say Rhaego paid for Drogo and Drogo paid for the dragons; you can't buy something twice with the same money, the second time you don't have it anymore. And Rhaego wasn't even burnt at the pyre that hatched dragons; the only ones who were burnt were Mirri Maz Duur (alive), the horse (recently killed for that purpose) and Drogo (dead already, questionable if he can be considered a sacrifice, but I guess we can accept it). Well, and Dany stepped into the fire.
Â 
I've never been sure how the hatching of dragons worked in terms of "only death pays for life". I'm really confused as to which death paid for which life. (I'm only sure that Rhaego couldn't have anything to do with it.) The most logical explanation would be that three dead beings burnt at the pyre = three live dragons; but the confusing thing is that MMD previously sacrificed a horse for Drogo, but still sacrificed Rhaego, too. That's two lives - unless a horse's life doesn't count, which doesn't seem right. If a horse's life doesn't count, what does it do? And if a horse's life doesn't count, whose life paid for the third dragon?
Â 
Unless Dany had to step into the fire and offer her life as some kind of a...collateral (?) for dragons to be hatched, or just for Drogon (he hatched after she stepped into the fire, didn't he?). Otherwise, what was she, some kind of a catalyst? Or was the horse a catalyst? It's all damn confusing....Â 
Â 
It's all like some sort of bargaining  - "What, an unborn child? Add a horse to it and I'll give you the khal"; "That's not enough for three dragons! What, a horse again!" "But hey, I'm giving you a live maegi!" "OK, but give me your life as a collateral and then I'll give you three dragons! Deal!"
5302	Here Shaggydog	2014-05-29	I hope they show Oberyn kick Clegane's ass as much as he does
in the book. He basically controls the whole fight. I think Arya needs to warg into Nymeria before
she leaves for Braavos otherwise that means no Arya wolf dreams and
no Lady Stoneheart.

They've really cut down the direwolf stuff since seasons 1 and 2, so I for one am not expecting anything.
I'm not sure how that means Arya won't have wolf dreams in Braavos, or that LS won't appear? Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean

Even if Arya was having wolf dreams right now in the series, they wouldn't show her fishing out Catelyn's body.Â  It's totally contrary to the producers' style.

Re watch last episode.Â  Sandor has already received his wound that will fester.Â  They made quite a point of Arya telling him to burn away the rot before it takes and him saying no.

He will probably be further injured in this episode, though. He still has a big fight scene we haven't seen yet, and McCann appeared with much more "injury make-up" in some featurettes.

Â 
This isn't really the right thread for it, so I won't say much. You make some great points, and I'm inclined to agree with you... But in ACoK Dany thinks that the dragons were paid for by Drogo, Mirri and Rhaego, and IMO it's Dany's beliefs that are essential.Â
5310	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-30	this is an interesting interview from the director. two things near the end really have me excited.
"Because of who Oberyn, the Red Viper, is, and as portrayed by so perfectly by Pedro, he has a real level of style and finesse that, obviously, nobody on â<U+0080><U+009C>Game of Thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D> has in wielding weapons. I mean, it's usually, â<U+0080><U+009C>Cut, rip, kill,â<U+0080><U+009D> and you got the Hound, you bump into the Hound at the grocery store and it's like, â<U+0080><U+009C>You're dead.â<U+0080><U+009D> So, I thought it should have a very elegant, slick style, especially because of the way it ends, it would set up a contrast."
what ever the end is, its going to be brutal. so thats good
"One of my favorite scenes, actually, and Sophie [Turner] really came into her own and is so wonderful in it, is the scene with Littlefinger, it's the â<U+0080><U+009C>Trial of Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+009D> as we called it. That scene is brilliant, and she's incredible, they all are, but that's the beginning of a big storyline and especially with Sophie pulling off the shell game of the trial."

Â 
All points to gruesome, book ending. As someone pointed out they would need to have Mountain correct the hearsay Oberyn heard - about him killing Elia with sword, so that the way they die is the same. It's such a cruel irony.

Plus no word on what happened to Brynden Tully, or Edmure. And what about Balon Greyjoy? I also wish they would have made Theon's appearance more extreme, at least make his hair white, he looks almost the same.

The Sansa one and the duel one are new! Oh my God, I really think the internet is gonna break after that episode. People seem to love Oberyn more than Cat and Robb and from the polls it seems they think he'll win.

The whole "poison spear" thing is considerably less of a feat of skill when the other guy doesn't have a helmet.

I think it'll get knocked off. Wasn't there a shot of the Mountain with a helm at the beginning of the duel? I agree stuff like that is frustrating. I mean, why give the Hound a really cool helm that we never see? But that's just one of those things that might work in a book but on TV, less so.

Â 
Yeah, that seems more logical. And given this new actor, the less he talks, the better (not that the other Mountains were particularly loquacious).Â
5321	jentario	2014-05-30	I think he takes it off with frustration that the Viper moves quickly and his eyesight is slim. I don't think he'll have many lines, though. The only thing I care about is the one line "You raped her murdered her you killed her children." That's all. If it's in (which is likely) I'll be a happy man.
5322	Here Shaggydog	2014-05-30	Yeah they definitely need to mention the poison before the fight. I also hope they show Oberyn using the sun somehow to his advantage like he does in the book, although I'm pretty sure he doesn't have his bronze shield to do so. Do you guys think they will have him impaling the Mountain pinned to the ground with his spear?
5323	Arkash	2014-05-30	I think it'll get knocked off. Wasn't there a shot of the Mountain with a helm at the beginning of the duel? I agree stuff like that is frustrating.

Â 
Â 

Â 
I think the Mountain will take it off during the duel. Oberyn dances around him and I can totally see the Mountain removing angrily his helmet to keep him in sight.
Â 
Â 
I love the new Sansa picture and her testimony at "Littlefinger's trial" is one of the many things I'm really looking forward this episode. I feel like we'll finally see a Sansa we all want to see and Sophie can definitly pull her off !
5324	Annara Snow	2014-05-30	Is Sansa sewing in that picture?
Â 
Another thing I've learned from the Alex Graves interview: he's one of those people who like to use the words "sociopathic" and "psychopathic" even though they don't understand what they really mean. But that's not the first nonsense he's said in interviews...

Â 
Oh Damn! Now i'm majorly excited.
5329	Here Shaggydog	2014-05-30	Yeah, I'm just wondering who they can encounter for Sandor to get "mortally" wounded. Rorge and Biter are dead, as well as Polliver and his goons. Who else could they run into? The mountain clans? That would be kind of repetitive though. Unless his wound from Biter gets infected. All these changes are going to have a butterfly effect. Like for Brienne, no fight with Rorge and Biter, Shagwell, Pyg, and Timeon were never introduced, if I remember correctly. Who else is there for Brienne and Pod to encounter now? Her story is moving really fast. Any thoughts?
5330	Annara Snow	2014-05-30	Yeah, I'm just wondering who they can encounter for Sandor to get "mortally" wounded. Rorge and Biter are dead, as well as Polliver and his goons. Who else could they run into? The mountain clans? That would be kind of repetitive though. Unless his wound from Biter gets infected. All these changes are going to have a butterfly effect. Like for Brienne, no fight with Rorge and Biter, Shagwell, Pyg, and Timeon were never introduced, if I remember correctly. Who else is there for Brienne and Pod to encounter now?

1) some Freys
2) the BwB
3) first some Freys, then the BwB
But yeah, her story is probably going to move very fast.
Brienne not meeting Rorge is an example of Butterfly effect - it's a consequence of Brienne having no history with him, which in itself is a consequence of the elimination of the Bloody Mummers and Weasel soup from the show.

Â 
So maybe option 3 is the likeliest. She bites the ear off a Frey but is wounded (I guess not in the same fashion) and then the BwB show up?

I think it would make the most sense - They see her fighting Freys and they figure she shares a common enemy with them so they take her to their leader.
Â 
Capturing Brienne as a foe would probably lead to her hanging in finale and that would be rushed.
5334	Here Shaggydog	2014-05-30	Yeah you're right maybe Brienne is more likely to encounter the Brotherhood, which would be cool. Also Gendry may show up. I wonder if Sansa will meet Mya Stone too. It's hard for book readers to speculate with a lot of things being up in the air now. I just hope they don't add another made up character in the next few episodes they already have a plethora to choose from.

I think Joe Dempsie who played Gendry said he is not in this season, of course he could have been sworn the secrecy  But I think it's more likely he is not in this season. I'm sure he'll show up next year.

Â 
I'd assume that as well. I think it'd be odd if he showed up now. Show!Gendry was betrayed by the BwB and then sent on a boat back to KL(?). I don't think he'd want to rejoin them in a hurry, or be in a position to do so.

Plus no word on what happened to Brynden Tully, or Edmure. And what about Balon Greyjoy? I also wish they would have made Theon's appearance more extreme, at least make his hair white, he looks almost the same.


i was never a big fan of the white hair. it always seemed kind of weird. i think what they have done with him is fine. his acting makes up for him not looking too terrible.

I've found the quote (on the internet) I was looking for, but I can't remember when exactly they said this in the books:"You are aware that Lord Varys has sent fishermen into the waters around Dragonstone. They report that only a token force remains to defend the island. The Lyseni are gone from the bay, and the great part of Lord Stanniss strength with them."
"Well and good," announced Pycelle. "Let Stannis rot in Lys, I say. We are well rid of the man and his ambitions."
"Did you turn into an utter fool when Tyrion shaved your beard? This is Stannis Baratheon. The man will fight to the bitter end and then some. If he is gone, it can only mean he intends to resume the war.Â Most likely he will land at Storms End and try and rouse the storm lords. If so, hes finished. But a bolder man might roll the dice for Dorne. If he should win Sunspear to his cause, he might prolong this war for years. So we will not offend the Martells any further, for any reason.Â

I'm pretty sure that 1) the dress from the VF photoshoot was the PW dress and 2) Sansa is indeed sewing a dress in that scene, as the high-res version of that shot of Sansa reveals. It looks like darker material, making it a good candidate for an Alayne dress.
Sansa's still wearing her Sansa dress during LF's trial, so I guess she must not finish the dress in time to wear it...unless she only starts sewing it once she "outs" herself as LF's bastard...although she's still wearing the ring in the shot where she's sewing, even though she removed it in one of the other shots where she's wearing her Sansa dress, so I dunno.

I think the episode will end with Oberyn's death and Tyrion losing his shit (or his lunch, depending if they go with the whole vomiting bit). It closes out a chapter in ASOS, and chapter closers make good episode enders (Petyr shoving Lysa, Cersei screaming for Tyrion's arrest, etc.), for obvious reasons.

You do realize that some book fans DO have a soft spot for Fat Walda and Her Roose, don't you? Â Being one of them, I can tell you that not only do I nurse hope that irregardless of The Bastard that she lives, but I want Fat Walda and Roose to be returned to The Dreadfort and to live happily ever after, the expected baby is included in my wishes and hopefully.......many more to follow. Â  I'm just hopeful that the above actress can give the spunk and spirit that is required for the role.
Â 
ETA: Â Considering Arya has been wearing the same outfit since at least S2, is she pretty enough for me to wish she would receive a change of clothes? Â Or, is it the fanbase complaint? Â

Seriously, Sansa had fans long before there was any type of pretty face attached. How odd that someone can't imagine people genuinely admiring her resilience.

Â 
To be fair, Book Sansa is described as pretty or beautiful many, many, many times...to the point where, as I recall, many fans complained at great length about Sophie Turner's casting when the news came out on the basis that she wasn't sufficiently beautiful to play Sansa. It's not a TV Jorah vs. Book Jorah situation.
Â 
With that said, I'd say Sansa's popularity gets far more of a boost from her status as one of the core POVs and as one of the Stark POVs than from her beauty. There are other characters in the series who are also described as beautiful whose fanbases are comparatively small: Cersei, Arianne, Margaery, Val, etc. ASOIAF's crawling with beautiful female characters, so that alone won't get a character very far.
Â 
Sure whatever. Â  Here's a thought experiment for you smart guys. Â  Would any of you even care about Sansa if she looked like this:

Â 
Right, because no one cared about Book Arya despite her being described as plain, or about Book Brienne despite her being described as hideously ugly. Oh, wait, they did. I'd even say Arya--in both TV and book incarnations--is far more popular than Sansa, despite being far less conventionally attractive in the book and the show.

True. But there's not really an actual image attached to the description. I can't really see someone who doesn't care much for her personality and such still liking her because she's described as pretty, ya know?

5418	Newstar	2014-06-01	Nina Gold has never let us down, as far as I'm concerned.
Â 
I do think her batting average has been amazing so far, considering the dozens--hundreds?--of speaking roles cast to date, and it seems like the ones I had the most questions about have been the ones who turned out to impress me the most (Alfie Allen, who knew?)....buuuuuuuut I'm still not impressed by Emilia Clarke's acting, four seasons in, as gorgeous and charismatic as she is. Not that Tamzin Merchant, the original Daenerys, would have been an improvement, but I still have my doubts about the wisdom of casting Emilia Clarke. It seems petty to harp on one role when Nina Gold has so rarely missed the mark in casting so many others, but if you're going to get one role right in casting this thing (apart from Tyrion), that's the one to get right. Before Season 4, I would have added Kit Harington to my admittedly short list of casting blunders, but the actor finally seems to be showing signs of life just as Jon's storyline is gearing up.
Â 
Even though I've made my peace with Kit Harington, and even though Harry Lloyd was perfection as Viserys, I'm still kind of bitter that we could have had Harry Lloyd playing Jon Snow and missed out. (I'm not fussed about the other Jon Snow might-have-beens, like Alfie Allen and Joe Dempsie.) He even looks like the description of Book Jon Snow, for crying out loud. Long face? Check. Slender? Check. Targ-worthy bone structure? Check.
Â 
And really, even though Nina Gold has had so many casting successes (especially with the child actors, my goodness), what does it say about her abilities that of the three core leads of this series--Jon, Dany, and Tyrion--the casting for one of them was pretty much a foregone conclusion she had no part in (since D&D made it clear the series wouldn't have been made without Peter Dinklage), and the casting for the other two is still a subject of controversy?
Â 
Â 
^I think Ed Skrein was a mess-up
Â 
I realize I'm in the minority on this one, but I loved Ed Skrein's Daario--even though I suspected that his dialogue was dubbed--in all his cheesy, eyeroll-inducing glory.

					
					
							Edited by Newstar, 01 June 2014 - 12:58 AM.
5419	DaveyJoe	2014-06-01	^ I totally get what you're saying, I agree with the criticism for Clarke and Harrington, but they were not the first choice for either role, so I don't count them as a strike against Nina. Â Lloyd was amazing as Viserys and is clearly a talented actor so I'm sure he would have been a great Jon Snow. Â I didn't care for Kit in the first 3 seasons, but he's definitely improved and I'm enjoying his performance this season, but such an integral character could and should have been great from the beginning. Â I think Clarke is uneven but has hit higher peaks through the first few seasons than Kit has, but her story is often rushed, it's hard to leave an impact when the show is essentially just checking in. Â I know nothing about Merchant, but I agree that both Kit and Emilia are the weakest of the cast, which is a shame considering the importance of their characters. Â They've both had great moments, though, and I don't blame the casting director since neither were the first pick.
Â 
As for Ed Skrein, I have mixed feelings about the Daario thing. Â I thought Ed really nailed the arrogance of the character, yeah the performance was a bit over the top, but I felt like that was totally fine for the character. Â The tri colored beard and golden mustache wouldn't really work on the screen, so they let the cheese seep into the performance. Â Even though neither actors looked the part, I felt Ed Skrein conveyed the general Daarioness a bit better. Â I think Daario 2.0 feels like a more three dimensional character and has a much more subtle performance, and is a more convincing love interest for Dany. Â It's tough, I like different aspects of each performance. Â Daario 2.0's appearance doesn't bother me because it supports the Daario=Benjen theory which I'm completely on board with now.
5420	Defeatarion	2014-06-01	Kit has been WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better this season, and Clarke waaaaaaay worse. Just very dull. Of course this is the time in the books she becomes dull anyway

Dude, the show character is much better. I loved book Oberyn too. I thought his path to revenge would land him a POV. My heart sank reading that chapter. That being said, Pedro Pascal has been brilliant, and we can see more of Oberyn. Instead of the rumors of poetry, bisexual, and all that, we get to see it. (Although they laid the bisexual thing on a bit too much)Â

Â 
Kit's a big fanboy of the books just like Emilia. Â They are among the few actors who actually read ahead. Â I think AG/Littlefinger has also read the books, I'm convinced that he is a method actor that is trolling everybody on a meta level. Â The comments about being more fatherly toward Sansa is proof, I bet he changed the Only Cat line just to troll book readers on a meta level, Littlefinger is victimizing the characters and the fanbase.

Â 
I knew about Tamzin Merchant, and about Michelle Fairley replacing Jennifer Ehle (although Gillian Anderson alluded in an interview to turning down a GOT role, and I think it must have been Catelyn), but Kit Harington being a replacement is news to me. Who was the first choice for Jon Snow?
Â 
Â 
Â 
Lloyd was amazing as Viserys and is clearly a talented actor so I'm sure he would have been a great Jon Snow. Â I didn't care for Kit in the first 3 seasons, but he's definitely improved and I'm enjoying his performance this season, but such an integral character could and should have been great from the beginning.
Â 
Absolutely agree. It's great that Harington's finally finding his sea legs, but I would have liked to see that three seasons ago. I have seen speculation that Kit Harington's pain from his injury during filming Season 3 was impairing his acting, but I dunno.
Â 
There are some actors and actresses in the show who seem to improve the acting of whomever they're acting opposite in any given scene and seem to draw better performances out of their scene partners--Maisie Williams for example seems like a lightning rod for good acting, for whatever reason--but I don't think any of them are in the Wall storyline...although it's not really fair to put Kit Harington's problems on the lack of such actors and actresses in his storyline. Sophie Turner has had the benefit of acting opposite some of the "lightning rod" actors, which has resulted in some cracking scenes, but I've seen her wither without them, resulting in some truly painful scenes. I suspect that's why SanSan in Season 2 was such a mess, although to be fair the writing did it no favours: Rory McCann was shaky enough as it was, and throwing Sophie Turner into the mix just compounded the problem. Separate the two, put Sophie Turner opposite the KL acting heavyweights, put Rory McCann with Maisie Williams, and bam! Instant improvement on both sides. We judge Kit Harington more harshly than Sophie Turner, but I wonder: is she a better actor than Kit Harington, or just luckier?
Â 
Â 
I know nothing about Merchant
Â 
I saw her as Catherine Howard in The Tudors, and you did not miss much.
Â 
Â 
Â

  Â Cheers, buddy. Â This is what a one week hiatus does to us. Â The other night I had a dream about Dinklage playing the Joker in a new Batman movie, it was weird. Â I am so ready for Sunday night.
Â 


Lloyd is a terrific actor. A shame he had to go so soon.Â 


Â 
Agreed, but it's a good thing that actors like Lloyd, Addy and Pascal ( ) were so effective at bringing their characters to life, because that makes the jaw dropping moments of this series more memorable.
5433	Konradsmith	2014-06-01	My theory on Kit is that he does better when he films on sets or indoors rather than outdoors which gives him less takes to work out the dialogue. Had they given the part to Harry Lloyd or Iwan Rheon, I think they might have sold the season two and three writing better than Kit. That said he's not THAT bad and has been on par this season. He still gets overshadowed by the other actors around him like John Bradley and Owen Teale, but he's done a good job handling his "becoming a leader" arc.
Â 
I'd likely be having some rye with or without the hiatus, DaveyJoe and as for dreams about the show, I once dreamt that Steve Coogan was cast as Bowen Marsh, as strange as that sounds.

Right! Forgot about him. I can't really see Iwan Rheon as Jon Snow, even aside from things like whether or not he looks like Book Jon Snow (since Kit Harington doesn't, either, apart from having dark hair).

Though I love Jennifer Ehle, I have to be glad about herÂ dropping out of the roleÂ because Michelle Fairley was one of the best parts of the show. (And will be hehehee)

I think Jennifer Ehle's Cat likely would have been closer to Book Catelyn--colder, more dignified, more refined, etc.--but Michelle Fairley rocked the part.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Also I'veÂ heard thatÂ Evangeline Lilly was up for Cersei, so make of that what you will.
Â 
Well, she does have green eyes, so that's something, I guess? The idea of LOST's Kate as Cersei tickles me, since Jaime is basically the Westeros version of Sawyer from LOST. I'm just saying, is all I'm saying.

5435	DaveyJoe	2014-06-01	Nobody on the show is truly awful, but I'm bit more critical of the actors that need to carry the story like Jon and Dany. Â You have supporting characters like Roose, Tywin, and Oberyn, and they totally steal the show. Â Part of the problem is the adaptation process, we're not in Jon or Dany's head in the show, but they're allowed so much more depth in the books thanks to the different medium. Â The show needs to take these characters and condense their story but make them their story feel relevant and dramatic, and the only tools are the writing and acting. Â Say what you will about the writing but at least Stannis and Sansa have had consistently great performances to drive their story in the show.
5436	Konradsmith	2014-06-01	I don't have anything TOO harsh to say about Clarke and Harington, but the fact that they're bothÂ extremely good looking played a very large part in their casting I think.
Â 
That said and having seen the discussion drift in an off-topic direction, how about them "the Mountain and the Viper"s?

Emilia has been described as taking the books to work and referring to them mid-shoot. Kit has read the books as well, but not yet ADWD.

Â 
I think here'sÂ Â where you're wrong. Â Even without a image attached, people form pictures in their own head. And a character who's described as beautiful will cause the reader to associate the character with being attractive in their head, and that will often lead to some readers liking them more.
Â 
Now I am not saying that the only reason people like Sansa is because she's described as pretty, it's certainly helps her popularity though. But I also think one of the reasons so many people like Jaime is because he's described as very handsome. I don't think this is exclusive to Sansa. Â I don't think Jaime would have nearly as many fans if his appearance were described to be similar to Chett.
5439	Woman of War	2014-06-01	To be fair, Book Sansa is described as pretty or beautiful many, many, many times...to the point where, as I recall, many fans complained at great length about Sophie Turner's casting when the news came out on the basis that she wasn't sufficiently beautiful to play Sansa.

There are other characters in the series who are also described as beautiful whose fanbases are comparatively small: Cersei, Arianne, Margaery, Val, etc. ASOIAF's crawling with beautiful female characters, so that alone won't get a character very far.

I'd even say Arya--in both TV and book incarnations--is far more popular than Sansa, despite being far less conventionally attractive in the book and the show.
True, there are many beautiful women.
But I believe that Sansa as character invites far more romantic shipping than anyone of those female characters described as beautiful. The other ones have more edges and corners, they are more determined and  fleshed out in their goals, they do their "shipping" themselves, they promise so much more than a romantic storyline and with Sansa we have yet to wait.
5440	aussiegirl	2014-06-01	I think the attractiveness of some characters certainly plays a part in whether more casual viewers like them or not. Those on their 48th read with millions of posts on message boards? Not so much.
Â 
I really miss Viserys. I preferred him to Dany. I always feel guilty because she is really the only female who was going for the Iron Throne. And part of me feels like I should support her in that. But yeah, I kind of don't.
Â 
On topic, finally a new episode tomorrow. I'm having serious Mad Men withdrawals so this episode better be damn good. And they better give poor Maisie something to do.
Â 
And Yara/Asha. If she is in this episode, I hope they treat her much better than the last time she was in an episode.

I'm a major Sansa fan. And I happen to find red-heads (and blondes for that matter) to be rather ugly. Had I been writing the books, I would have given Sansa Â black hair and the beauty that tends to accompany it, and made Arya the ginger.*

And while we're all going to miss him, Pedro Pascal is going to end his time in GoT with possibly one of the most epic sequences the show has ever done, destined to be remembered forever. So don't feel to bad for him.

5445	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-06-01	I'm still not impressed by Emilia Clarke's acting, four seasons in, as gorgeous and charismatic as she is.


To be completely fair, she was good in season one. I don't think it is Nina's fault.
5446	Konradsmith	2014-06-01	^She had some sub-par moments there too. I cringe at "you SOLD SLAVES" and her "why?" that follows it. Her season 1 material was stronger but I think that reflects there being more book material to draw from and more prominent characters besides her around. In season 2 she had to carry the storyline more with varying degrees ofÂ success.
Â 
Once again though, how about that "the Mountain and the Viper"?

Â 
Yeah, I rewatched S1E4 two nights ago, and I cringed at that line too. However, I think that, for the most part she is really good. I think it's just some lines she says, like that one, "Where are my dragons?" and "I will answer injustice with justice" that make the fanbase have a bad opinion of her. For the most part, though, she is pretty great.Â

5450	Hath4	2014-06-01	should be interesting to see Allen's performance in this episode as he treats with the ironborn. I'm sure he will knock it out of the park. This year pascal and allen have been excellent and are really the Mvps of this season.
5451	Konradsmith	2014-06-01	^Yeah, he's almost at full on Tropic Thunder "dude playing a dude disguised as another dude" status.
Â 
The idea of having your personality destroyed and being turned basically into a dog and then being made to play yourself again is beautifully twisted. Seeing it onscreen will be even more so. Though Roose is my liege lord, I must concede that Ramsay is pretty clever when it comes to psychological fuckery. But the son is the shadow of the father.

5452	jentario	2014-06-01	They've been setting up Moat Cailin since episode 2, but I don't remember it being a particularly thrilling moment (especially since they've already proved what Reek is willing to do in the Yara scene). I can hardly remember the scene in the books. Was it really that great?
5453	Father of Dragons	2014-06-01	I think of Moat Cailin is in the opening, it will take the place of the Dreadfort. They have a bad tendency to show locations on the opening that don't actually appear (Vase Dothrak, anyone?) so I hope that they change that since Theon and Ramsay are actually there.
There's been very little talk of the Moat Cailin scene in this thread. At least, in the more recent pages.
5454	Arkash	2014-06-01	Nope, from the recap we can be sure the episode opens on the attack on Mole's Town.

Â 
It wasn't. However, from what we've seen of it in the promos so far, the atmosphere seems to be pretty epic. Also, Alfie Allen has a knack of knocking meh material out of the park. We can safely assume that this scene will be great!

It is important because it is the begining of theons rebirth. For the first time in along time he feels just alittle bit like theon again and has flashes of what he once was. Plus it gives us a different view of the ironborn. Up unitl that point they had been savages, but we see in that scene that they are just starvard soldiers disanfranchized form command just looking to go home. It is verry apocalspe now. it is not an action scene, it is more of a pycholgical scene and a big step on the reek theon journey.

5458	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-01	I'm looking very forward to this scene and I adore all, Allen, Rheon and McElhatton (okay, Roose isn't in this episode as far as we know, but I mean adore generally). None of them actually looks very much like their book counterparts, but yet I couldn't think of somebody other for Theon/Ramsay/Roose. 
Always loved Alfie Allen as Theon and was always impressed by him, in Winterfell, with Robb, at Pyke, with the Boltons... He's one of the guys, when I read the books I imagine him as his book character. Definitely for me the maybe best cast / one of the best.
And even I first was a tiiiny bit sceptical about Show!Roose and Show!Ramsay, God, they washed every doubt away! It may sound odd, I don't know, but I'm enjoying them very much (same as I absolutely loved Reek's chapters in ADWD). Not the torture scenes in season 3, hell no, but the Boltons/Theon scene in 4x02 is so far my most favourite scene in the entire series. Also loved Reek/Ramsay in 4x06, and ooh, the Roose scenes with Jaime and Brienne in season 3 - wonderful!
I will also admit my favourite (very short) scene of "The Rains of Castamere" was the eye-exchange of Roose and Cat, their glances, when he looked down to his sleeve and then Cat recognize the hauberk and they look again in each others' eyes, man, these few seconds are some of my most favourite overall.
Iwan Rheon playing Ramsay makes him even more disturbing (especially if you know "Misfits") and somehow I find Show!Ramsay is more alike / similar to his father than Book!Ramsay... I'm looking so forward to more of them in season 5!
I'm just glad my grandma isn't THIS time present while me and my family watch GoT... Once she visited us, sat on our couch and just in this moment we began watching: Episode 4x02, so the first thing she ever saw of GoT was the Ramsay-hunting-scene -.- I've tried to distract her the whole time, but of course she understand what happend there. She's 80 years old, has no clue about GoT (and this isn't really her genre) and I fear her surface impression of it wasn't very positiv XD
And I always found Moat Cailin very important in Theon's story, you guys already said why and you're also right about the view on the Ironborn, aso. And what we have seen so far in trailers (e.g. Theon riding to it, wearing armour and carrying this white banner) looks impressive!

5459	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-01	It's going to be funny tonight when I stay awake till (here) 3 a.m. to read between 3-4 a.m. every post in the "Discussing the episode" thread while Americans (and others?) are able to watch it and I have to wait till tomorrow midday/evening :-(
But I love reading the comments there (Thank you to everyone who posts during an episode!), sometimes it's even better than watching by myself, especially when there are comments as during the WW-baby-scene where everybody just wrote "OMG! What happens there?!" or "What I'm watching now?!" or "Wooah, that's incredible..." - and me: "WHAT???? What are you talking about? What exactly happens?" XD 
(This hour is always very hilarious and exciting)
I have the feelings the posts when Oberyn dies will make me sad :-( And then I'm sad, because Oberyn dies and angry, because I can't see how he dies, and I'm anyway usually super-excited every monday night and then don't sleep after 4 a.m... this time (or actually the next three mondays) it will be even worse...

Â

Patience and GoT do not go hand in hand
5463	Annara Snow	2014-06-01	Â 
I think here'sÂ Â where you're wrong. Â Even without a image attached, people form pictures in their own head. And a character who's described as beautiful will cause the reader to associate the character with being attractive in their head, and that will often lead to some readers liking them more.
Â 
Now I am not saying that the only reason people like Sansa is because she's described as pretty, it's certainly helps her popularity though. But I also think one of the reasons so many people like Jaime is because he's described as very handsome. I don't think this is exclusive to Sansa. Â I don't think Jaime would have nearly as many fans if his appearance were described to be similar to Chett.


Â 
Why do so many people (book readers) love Tyrion, then? He is more popular than Jaime, or at least was before ADWD (not sure how exactly it stands now). You also get lots of people having hots for characters who are explicitly described as ugly/disfigured (Sandor) or plain-looking/not beautiful (Asha) - and you even get some amusingly far too good-looking fan art and people who imagined these characters as more attractive than they're supposed to be while reading the books.
Â 
I'd be willing to bet that there are people who are less likely to like a character if they are described as beautiful. It certainly seems like that with many Sansa haters who have pegged her as some sort of a "cheerleader" stereotype that they hated in high school and can't let go off it. And I'm pretty sure that there are lots of people who love Tyrion or Quentyn among other reasons because they are not supposed to be attractive, judging by the amount of Nice Guy Â<U+0099> arguments where they rant against attractive female characters for not falling at the knees of their favorite male characters and being overjoyed to fuck/marry them, even if they had zero reasons to do so even if we disregard the physical attractiveness aspect; again, an example of people throwing logic out of the window and somehow managing to read high school romcom "popular pretty girl must fall for the unattractive nerd guy or else she's a bitch" stereotypes where it doesn't belong.

5464	jentario	2014-06-01	Still, I'd rather watch it in a low-quality live stream than read comments about it... And I am very aware of the problem of impatientiance, I have it as well. In the morning when I wake up I always check the review scores on this site and others and read through the shorter comments (which tend to be "great episode!"). Then of course I have the issue with having to avoid the longer comments, which is hard... I usually end up spoiler ing myself on a detail or two from the episode, and sometimes photos pop up which are unavoidable. But I definitely don't mine for spoilers! That does not seem self serving :/

Yes, I spoiler myself and I can say: It's a big flaw of mine. It was worse in the past (reading the last pages of a book; looking for the end of a movie on wikipedia; searching for every spoiler I can find in the internet, aso...), but I'm trying to avoid such things more and more; my goal is that once TWOW is released I'm able to read it from the beginning to the end (instead of first reading the POVs I'm most interested in and looking if my favourites are still alive at the end).
But I still love spoilers and to spoiler (if someone allows me to).
And since I already know ASOIAF I have no problems with reading the posts about GoT (despite the many changes and whatever), quite the opposite: Reading the reactions without watching what happens is extremely funny for me! 
And yes, I'm also too impatient... "Sky" airs GoT here (in English and tomorrow this season also starts in German), but instead of waiting till monday afternoon, I'm thankful for every person already writing during an episode 
(And luckily, I had my last school day ever last week, the written exams are done, now I have a break of a month till the oral exams and gratuating school; so I've at the moment no problem with staying awake monday nights)

Wow, you sound exactly the same as me. We have identical goals for TWOW 

Glad to hear I'm not the only one 
It will be very, very hard for me when I'd see e.g. "Theon"/"Asha" -> "Daenerys" -> "Davos" -> "Daenerys" -> "Jon"/"Melisandre" (Hypothetical order) and then I'd have to force myself not to skip Dany... The temptation would be very huge...
5472	jentario	2014-06-01	To be fair, Dany's chapters will probably start to get interesting in TWOW. She has to get to Westeros at some point...
5473	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-01	Â 
Well, she does have green eyes, so that's something, I guess? The idea of LOST's Kate as Cersei tickles me, since Jaime is basically the Westeros version of Sawyer from LOST. I'm just saying, is all I'm saying.


Â 
LOLLLLLLLLLLLL and LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL Â Lost's Kate does seem too young to be Cersei, though. Â But still, Jaime is like the combo of Sawyer and Prince whatshisface from one of the Shrek movies, I think it is? Â
5474	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-01	To be fair, Dany's chapters will probably start to get interesting in TWOW. She has to get to Westeros at some point...

Okay, I guess, you have a point 
It's actually less my dislike for her POV and more my love for the POVs in the North.
5475	Colonel Green	2014-06-01	I suspect that's why SanSan in Season 2 was such a mess, although to be fair the writing did it no favours: Rory McCann was shaky enough as it was, and throwing Sophie Turner into the mix just compounded the problem. Separate the two, put Sophie Turner opposite the KL acting heavyweights, put Rory McCann with Maisie Williams, and bam! Instant improvement on both sides. We judge Kit Harington more harshly than Sophie Turner, but I wonder: is she a better actor than Kit Harington, or just luckier?


I don't really see how either of the actors could be why the interactions between Sansa and the Hound were "such a mess" in season 2 (I agree that McCann wasn't especially good early on, though the Hound himself was barely there to begin with, which just goes back to the writing); they had all of two scenes (plus that one deleted scene), and no real story foundation.Â  That's a writing issue, 100% (McCann not coincidentally started to improve when they actually started to give the Hound meaningful dialogue).
Â 
I think Sophie is consistently one of the show's stronger performers, particularly as her character has struggled with weak writing so much of the time.Â  The idea that the only difference is her scene partners is silly.Â  Even in this season, where the writing for the character has improved from the season 3 nadir (where half the time you could see Turner trying to add nuance to a character being written as a one-dimensional dumb joke), she's pretty much singlehandedly holding up the character's scenes with Littlefinger, due to Aiden Gillen's cartoonishly broad performance (and none of the other great actors on the show have been able to draw anything better out of Gillen in the last few seasons, whether Conleth Hill, Lena Headey, or Charles Dance).

5482	Newstar	2014-06-01	(I agree that McCann wasn't especially good early on, though the Hound himself was barely there to begin with, which just goes back to the writing); they had all of two scenes (plus that one deleted scene), and no real story foundation.Â  That's a writing issue, 100%
Â 
I have to disagree. Lack of story foundation or lack of number of scenes together does not excuse poor acting. Watch Charles Dance and Diana Rigg tearing into each other in that not terribly well written and kind of random scene in Season 3 where they're facing off over Loras and Cersei for an exemplar. They'd had no scenes together before and none since (except group scenes), but the scene--questionable writing aside--pops. Now, you might say it's not fair to compare Sophie Turner to them, but I'd say they're an excellent example for how poor writing is no excuse for actors letting their scenes fall flat as Sophie Turner's scenes with Rory McCann did.
Â 
Â 
Â 
(McCann not coincidentally started to improve when they actually started to give the Hound meaningful dialogue).
Â 
Dialogue had nothing to do with it: that "chickens" bit was unworthy of Tarantino, let alone Shakespeare. The difference was swapping out Sophie Turner with an actress who could draw a decent performance out of him.
Â 
Â 
Â 
I think Sophie is consistently one of the show's stronger performers
Â 
Disagree. She has her moments, but she can also fall dreadfully flat, especially without a decent screen partner to act against. I often get frustrated with her, because there's just nothing there.
Â 
Â 
Â 
particularly as her character has struggled with weak writing so much of the time
Â 
Not really an excuse, as I said. All the characters in the show get weak writing here and there. Sophie Turner's hardly special in that regard. The better actors are able to sell weak writing. The best actors can make that weak writing sound like the most eloquent words ever put to paper. Sophie Turner doesn't fall into either category.
Â 
Â 
Â 
The idea that the only difference is her scene partners is silly.
Â 
Sophie Turner has benefited from strong scene partners who force her to raise her acting game. The actress admitted as much in a recent interview, saying she didn't like her performance in Season 1 but that being around certain actors helped her acting improve. I think she has improved since Season 1, although I'd characterize that improvement as less "from good to great" and more "from mediocre to mostly serviceable."
Â 
Â 
Â 
Even in this season, where the writing for the character has improved from the season 3 nadir (where half the time you could see Turner trying to add nuance to a character being written as a one-dimensional dumb joke)
Â 
I'd disagree with both these statements. The writing for the character didn't hit a nadir in Season 3, and there was very little in Sophie Turner's performance to suggest a concerted attempt to add nuance. She may have been trying to do so, as indicated by interviews where she insisted that Sansa's scared, dumb child act was just a facade, but that didn't come across in her performance. Intent =/= execution.
Â 
Â 
Â 
she's pretty much singlehandedly holding up the character's scenes with Littlefinger
Â 
Again disagree, although Aiden Gillen's acting does him no favours, either. There's very little that's impressive about the acting at the Eyrie, and I'm concerned about the lack of strong screen partners now that Sansa is in the same position as Dany and Jon in terms of holding up her own storyline. I guess we'll see, but I'm not particularly reassured.

5485	DaveyJoe	2014-06-01	^The show tends to mention upcoming characters/locations before hand to plant the seed. Â Stannis was talked about a bit in the first season so it didn't seem like he came out of nowhere. Â When they mentioned Doran and the Sand Snakes this season I knew they'd be in the show. Â I'll be watching closely for Vic/Euron references, that'll be a guarantee that they are in. Â The audience needs a reminder that Theon has uncles that might be relevant, it would be sloppy if they just came out of nowhere to affect the plot. Â If we don't hear about them, I'll be skeptical about their future in the show.

As for tonight's episode, my body is ready.

That would be cool, yeah... but somehow I doubt we'll get a Vic/Euron mention... Nevertheless, I'm sure they won't be cut! (wishful thinking?)
I actually wish we'd see / had seen a stamping Tommen scene this season  Just for the Unsullied who believe he will be a good king and no puppet to show them e.g. how he legalizes Ramsay aso...

Â 
  The reason why the season 2 SanSan interactions were poor was that they barely existed, which goes back to the primary reason - D&D can't write good interactions between the two to save their life, judging by the deleted season 2 scene (now, that was a mess, and no actor could save it, since the writing for Sandor makes no sense at all*), unless they're 100% replicating the dialogue from the books. Which also has a lot to do with not being that good in writing Sansa in general, and really struggling to write Sandor as well.
Â 
And anyway, Sophie was great in her Blackwater scene with Sandor, which should be enough to disprove this hypothesis, especially since it was one of the total of two scenes in the show (not counting the deleted scene) in which they exchange dialogue that consists of more than two lines.
Â 
* Kind of like the character of Shae, one of the characters Sansa has had most interactions on the show, for whatever reason. Sibel Kekilli's performance is hardly great, although she's been fantastic when acting in German, but I'm not that critical of her since the writing for her character has been ridiculous so much of the time. (I'm rewatching season 3 now and just saw Dark Wings, Dark Words yesterday... gods, the writing for KL scenes is just cringeworthy. Shae tells Sansa she should come to her if Littlefinger bothers her with sexual advances [which everyone is aware of, apparently], and she'll make him stop? WTF, really?)

5488	Arkash	2014-06-01	Someone on another board mentioned that during tonight's Theon scenes, he'll be watching/listening for some mention of Victarian and/or Euron, as an indicator of whether we can expect to see Theon's uncles next season.Â  Good point.Â  Of course, if we don't hear mention of them, its not absolute proof that we won't see them next season, but if we do hear them mentioned, then, they're in!


Â 
Actually that's what I'm most looking forward during the Reek storyline tonight.
Â 
We know Ralf Kenning will be there as the face and voice of the Iron Born holding the Moat and it is stongly possible that he says something like "Your uncle Victarion ordered us to hold the Moat, I take my orders from him not you." to Theon.

Â 
From what I've been told the actor will only appear in episode 10 (unless they changed around his scenes).

Â 
Unless Kenning is one of Yara's crewmember, then I feel like yeah, we will only see him in 10.
Â 
Nevertheless, the IB will need a face and a voice during the Moat scene.

Â 
He also tweeted a picture of himself around the time they were filming, and wrote something like "Getting ready for a hunt." With this info I have a feeling that Ramsay (after capturing Moat Cailin) will let the IB "go", only to hunt them down.
Â 
Could it be we're only getting Theon entering MC in this episode? Then again they might have moved what was originally supposed to take place in episode 10 to episode 8.

5493	Hath4	2014-06-01	That was imbd that listed him for 10 and it is extremely unreliable so I think he is only in this episode. as for a hunt do not really see that happing, that would be stupid.

5501	oursisthefury69	2014-06-01	What do people think about how the whole Tyrion Jamie arch will conclude this season?Â  Jaime showing up to KL so early has changed (ruined imo) a lot of his storys Â dynamics;Â  Would he actually believe Tyrion if he told him he killed Joff at this point?
5502	HelenaExMachina	2014-06-01	I dont think Jaime really believes he.did in the books either. So that much I think will be the same...I wonder though, will Tyrion just mention Lancel and Cersei? Or will he suggest some other favourite of Cersei too?
5503	jentario	2014-06-01	I think Tyrion won't tell him he killed Joffrey and will resort to just telling him Cersei fucked Lancel. But we'll see how they handle it.
And I'm loving TyrionXJamie this season. Aside from the rape scene, he's been fine. I guess he could have been a little bit more pro freeing Sansa early on, but that's my only (fairly minor) complaint.

You know, he can't just say "She's been fucking Lancel", he has to explain "She's been fucking our cousin who disappeared after season 2, the son of our uncle, Tywin's younger brother, who disappeared even earlier" 
Or otherwhile the poor audience won't know what he's talking about XD
5505	oursisthefury69	2014-06-01	@HelenaandthemachineÂ  I think It may be Jaimes last chapter in Storm when he and Cersie are discussing Joff sending the assassin that failed to kill Bran Stark.Â  Jaime then thinks to himself how if Tyrion were able to connect the dots the way he and Cersie just had, considering he was blamed and almost died Â for the attempt on Brans life that that may be what caused Tyrion to kill him.Â  In addition theres the simple fact that he didn't witness the wedding, or any of the over exaggerated joff tyrion confrontations leading up to it

The Oberyn-Tyrion scene was one of the best scenes that they have ever done, and the show has somehow managed to make me want to root for him in the duel more than I even did in the books.

I don't think Turner and McCann had any particular scene chemistry either (though they had so few scenes that it almost wasn't an issue), but the writing did them no favours there.Â  You can develop chemistry that may not "naturally" be there, but I really have no idea what the relationship between Sansa and the Hound is supposed to be on the show.Â  From her perspective he's some dude who for some reason helped her out a few times, and then blew her off in the only actual conversation they had prior to Blackwater; from his perspective, she's...what, exactly?Â  If you're looking for script cues as to his motivations, they're in short supply (that one deleted scene shows some part of the book Hound's sexual attraction, but that's totally absent from the handful of other scenes they have).

I didn't like the cut scene at all although I think it's very similar to what the book is like, which brings us to why didn't film it with the semiromantic overtones.  There is no way to shoot it without having pedo overtones, which would have irrevocably sullied the hound. You can do it with lf because he is a villain, but if you did it with the hound the arya wouldn't be the same.
5520	Konradsmith	2014-06-01	BTW in correction of someone above, Bryan Cogman wrote the deleted SanSan scene. He confirmed as much on twitter a month or two ago. It was supposed to take place between Sansa's dinner with Cersei, Tommen and Myrcella and her scene where she met Shae.

5521	Newstar	2014-06-01	Yeah, the deleted scene clearly went in 2x03. I assume Tyrion was randomly inserted into what was a bastardized version of Book SanSan interactions to explain how Tyrion came up with the idea of having Shae serve as Sansa's handmaiden, which explains why Shae shows up in Sansa's chambers.

5530	Lee-Sensei	2014-06-01	Why would the Vale Lords support Sansa (and not turn her into the Lannisters)? Well, we should probably begin with the fact that the Vale Lords think it was the LANNISTERS who killed Jon Arryn. So, you know, there's that. Add onto that the fact that Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon were known and liked in the Vale when they were Jon Arryn's wards. There's also the fact that the Knights of the Vale were/are angry that Lysa did not assist Robb in his war (which indicates to me a loyalty to the Stark family), and I'm fairly certain the Vale Lords and Knights wouldn't be entirely comfortably with forking her over so easily. Also, weren't Bronze Royce and Ned Stark really good friends? I think I recall reading that. Why...pray tell, would Ned Stark's 'homeboy' hand over his daughter to the Lannisters (or let anyone else do it, for that matter)?Â 
Â 
And who said anything about anyone going to war? I personally didn't mention anything about anyone going to war for Sansa. I'm only talking about her revealing her true identity. Where you got this war business from is beyond me. ALTHOUGH....for conversation sake...isn't that Littlefinger's plan? To reveal her identity to everyone so that the Knights of the Vale will "fight to win back her birthright"? Maybe your question about why the Vale Lords would fight for Sansa should be directed to HIM. Hell, that's HIS idea.Â 
Â 
Also, I disagree. Sansa doesn't know what LF wants. Hell, NO ONE knows what he wants. Which is why we have copious amounts of topics discussing it. Futhermore, I would consider it a step UP (for her character) to take her own damn destiny into her hands (by revealing her own identity) rather than sit around and trust LF--or anyone else--to keep her "safe". I would have thought that as a Sansa 'fan', you'd prefer THAT outcome rather than a perpetual 'damsel in distress' characterization. I don't know, maybe some people are fine with Sansa sitting around, looking pretty, and playing stupid, but I'm not. Let her be a proactive player in her own life rather than a reactive participant to everyone else.


This again.
Â 
1) Some of the Vale Lords wanted to ally with the Starks to fight the Lannisters.
Â 
2) LF's probably telling Sansa what she wants to hear.

There is no way to shoot it without having pedo overtones, which would have irrevocably sullied the hound. You can do it with lf because he is a villain, but if you did it with the hound the arya wouldn't be the same.

The scene was not similar to the book. It has a few similar lines to the book, but they are completely taken out of context and have lost all meaning. In the book, Sansa has come back from a meeting with Dontos; Sandor holds her when she is wobbly at the stairs and figures immediately that she's lying about where she's been. She's scared, not of him, but of being caught meeting a guy who is offering to help her escape. Sandor makes it clear that he knows she is lying, and tells her she is a bad liar (in that line that they decided to give to LF) but then he covers for her in front of Boros Blount. He also mocks her love of songs about chivalry and true knights, but says (pretending to be joking) that he would like to hear her sing such a song for him. He also tells her a meaningful story about the way his grandfather and his dogs saved lord Tytos, ending it with another great line: "A dog will die for you, but never lie to you."
He's drunk in that scene and talks a lot, and among the many things he says, he makes a comment about her developing body but adds that she's still a "stupid little bird" even though she looks "almost like a woman". But I don't see why it would be impossible to write that scene decently for the show if you want to leave out any signs of physical attraction, there is so much going on in that scene and their other interactions that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with romantic or sexual undertones. Like, for starters, the actors themselves talked about a "beautiful empathetic relationship" and that Sandor was bullied and abused by his brother so he finds it hard to see her abused and bullied by Joffrey, so, uh, how about him telling her his story, as he does in the books?
In the deleted scene, however, he just randomly comes up to her, tells her Joffrey is going to be raping her now (as if she doesn't know that already) and is just scaring her because....I don't know, he's a weirdo creep, I guess? And yells her he would like her to sing for him, which comes off as something completely random and lacks context, since the show has completely cut all references to songs or true knights (even LF'S famous "Life is not a song" line). It all ends with Tyrion as a good guy coming to Sansa's rescue from the bad Hound and telling him off. So, no, it's not like the scene from the book at all.
If Cogman wrote it, then he is really awful at writing Sandor and the Sansa/Sandor dynamic. Didn't he also write the fight with Beric where Sandor laughs instead of crying?

I'll say one thing for the show's portrayal of SanSan though: surprisingly, they had Sandor practically tell Sansa - in that scene where he was "blowing her off" - that he will kill Joffrey to protect her if necessary ("you will be grateful for the hateful things I do one day when I'm all that stands between you and your  beloved  king") - though I'm not sure if Sansa registered that (many of the viewers don't seem to have).

Â 
Well, maybe they could have pulled it off back then, too, if they had some meaningful, decently written scenes with more than a couple of lines of dialogue. There was one - the Blackwater one, which was good in the context of what their relationship was in the show, and that was a good scene, the way it was written, shot and acted, I loved Sophie's acting in it in particular. It's hard for actors to have 'chemistry' or to see if they have chemistry if most of their scenesÂ  consist of "stand there, look at each other in a weird/awkward way, say nothing".

5532	Zorn Gottes	2014-06-02	I have to disagree. Lack of story foundation or lack of number of scenes together does not excuse poor acting. Watch Charles Dance and Diana Rigg tearing into each other in that not terribly well written and kind of random scene in Season 3 where they're facing off over Loras and Cersei for an exemplar. They'd had no scenes together before and none since (except group scenes), but the scene--questionable writing aside--pops. Now, you might say it's not fair to compare Sophie Turner to them, but I'd say they're an excellent example for how poor writing is no excuse for actors letting their scenes fall flat as Sophie Turner's scenes with Rory McCann did

In fact I think it's an unfair comparison 
Olenna doesn't have much psychological depth and her interaction with Tywin is certainly much easier to play than Sansa and Sandor's. Scenes like "Tywin vs Olenna" allow a plain histrionic acting (like Diana Rigg's) whereas Sansa and Sandor's interaction walks on a very fine line and is much more challenging to put on screen.
It ain't the same ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport 
IMO, the lack of story foundation is indeed one of the problems, how can you express such a subtle connection when the characters happen to meet, like, twice? and just seem to talk randomly about things which don't have any backstory?
