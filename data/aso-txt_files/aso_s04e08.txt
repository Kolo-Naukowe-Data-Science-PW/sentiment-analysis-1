"MissHarington",2014-06-02,"just oh my god thanks to spoiler i knew what would happen at the fight but that ew disgusting i nearly cried i am traumatised â arya was awesome the hounds face priceless her laughter made me laugh â sansa had truly something of katniss everdeen she now understands the game â daenerys so cold whew edited by missharington 02 june 2014  0630 am"

"valirpaz",2014-06-02,"wow i certainly did not expect that good that i did not bet on the outcome of the fight too bad weve already lost oberyn again but surely somebody must save tyrion â i like where theyre going with sansas story thats going to be interesting bride to be to the king of the vale whos being educated by his stepfather who happens to have a thing for his niece  daughter in law â can somebody no spoilers explain to me how you interpreted aryas laughter edited by valirpaz 02 june 2014  0540 pm"

"XTwipz",2014-06-03,"holy shit what the f of that â the mountain was dead oberyn threw his lance in his body â he was supposed to die and not to stand up and how the hell he was able to crush his head i loved oberyn anyway great week episode though hard wait for the next one  edited by xtwipz 03 june 2014  0640 am"
"Zigster",2014-06-03,"for me the duel was a bit disappointing by now i know that a main good guy is probably going to die a brutal and humiliating death at around this point of the season so it wasnt very shocking that it happened but i felt like the head popping was over the top it was like the writers had sat around and brainstormed about how they could make the death as shocking as possible punching him in the face and caving in his skull or smacking his skull against the ground would have been better imo squishing his head like an orange just didnt work for me and thats regardless of whether thats the way it happens in the books or whether it could theoretically be done irl it just looked too ridiculous in the context of the show imo i was also getting strong princess bride vibes and the whole taunting the enemy when they appear to be beaten and then them coming to life and kicking your arse was a bit of a cliche im sure everyone saw that coming from a mile away which makes me wonder how the hell this great warrior oberyn didnt yeah he was emotional hes still a highly trained warrior who should know better â not sure about ramsay dont know whether i really give a crap about his story arc but maybe its really just a pit stop for theon but then theon seems like hes down and out and now were following ramsay primarily and not theon frankly not sure how ramsays still alive after fighting theons sisters gang without any armour it was nice that he got made a bolton and everything but yeah still unconvinced â i really like roose bolton though and i feel like roose is sort of the northern version of tywin and that could be a good rivalry id prefer to see more of him instead â the ironborn really suck in the show which is a shame because theons dad seemed like a badass its funny because theon taking winterfell seems like the most impressive thing that any of the ironborn have done in the show even though he totally cocked it up theyre damn quick to mutiny and surrender ramsay took them out really easily disappointing â danny sending jorah away was a stupid move why does she think she can trust the dude who was the kingsguard commander for robert and briefly joffrey and a sellsword who cut off his commanders heads at the drop of a hat jorah saved her from the poisoning and has been by far her most valuable advisor and risked his life for her about a million times its obvious hes totally pussy whipped and devoted to her there seemed to be a suggestion that jorah was involved in the death of dannys child as well i guess danny probably would love to believe that all her stupid decisions that led to the death of her child and drogo were a result of jorah betraying her and not just her own stupidity maybe im being too cynical â i dont care about the romance between grey worm and missandre i feel like the show already spends too much time analyzing the sexual desires of men whove had their bits cut off with varys and theon dont need another whole subplot devoted to that topic imo happy to see more of their characters but not in a romance sub plot hopefully this was a one off â bad changes for danys story all round â i love jaimie and tyrion not sure about the whole beetles thing but i like seeing them get some quality bro time â nice to see sansa growing up a bit didnt like how little finger seemed to manage to get himself where he was at the mercy of sansa though amateur hour was good to see baelish take charge of the vale and robin though baelish knows whats up and could definitely be a proper contender with the vale behind him sansa in the black dress was a bit obvious though â hound and arya are just great worried about his bite wound though sounds like its infected badly and theyve just been humanising him in the last few episodes which is what they generally do just before they kill characters off thats going to suck balls edited by angalin 03 june 2014  0228 pm removed spoiler"

"XTwipz",2014-06-05,"or closer to the person she would have been without being a victim go sansa i totally agree with you sansa has been a victim the whole time til now shes powerful and she know what littlefinger sees in her like a lost love of a dead woman who was his mother if you see what i mean so she has some sort of power on him and she doesnt have to obey to orders anymore"

"valirpaz",2014-06-05,"i agree with ormurin it would be an interesting change if baelish was defeated by his feelings kissing her was definitely not so smart but from what weve seen so far that would be quite a change of character sansa has been a victim the whole time til now no not the whole time initially she was not joffreys victim she wanted to be his queen and she wanted it so badly that she sacrificed that boy at the river who hit joffrey in a fight instead of saving him by telling the truth sacrificed the direwolf still kept her mouth shut in that i think we could already see that when she really wants something she can be reckless"

"Rockroi",2014-06-01,"for all those people upset about obyren martell i have this to say â httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv48h34ukfe8g â and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what happens to overrated men who speak when they are not spoken tooâ â â i loved a lot about this episodeâ it was great â what i liked â the queen of thrones the transformation of sansa stark from the dove that cersei picked on at winterfell to the dark brooding figure oozing through the vale has been an epic success one of the highlights of the showâ dd should be very proud of thatâ the show slowly carefully and with great pain and pressure made sansa the power broker behind petyr baelish and not the other way aroundâ even the way she surprised him and the way she used the truth to manipulate everyone was epicâ they made littlefinger reliant on sansa and not sansa reliant on lfâ they made her â<U+0080> â they made sansa stark the one who knocksâ<U+0080> â watching sansa grow even with her foibles imperfections scars and insecurities â<U+0080><U+0093> is tremendous because each step along the way has been believableâ she knows now what is so important to playing the game of thrones know what motivates other peopleâ once you know that you can work with itâ ned never learned it robb forgot about it renly was blind to it so they all lostâ sansa knows what motivates lf and she can work with that she can work with robyn and she can win the game of thronesâ the show has masterfully brought that truth to the forefront of the showâ â the blast from the past i never liked obyreyn martel for a simple reason he was a loudmouth who was more style than substance talked a big game and never backed it up a man whose reputation far exceeded the man he was and who seemed preoccupied with being right more than he ever was occupied with winningâ so he lostâ he lost because he could not keep his mouth shut he lost because he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t as good as he thought he lost because he underestimated a man whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation belied underestimation he lost because he thought he was touched by gods when in fact he was just touched by a mountainâ â and he lost because he thought he had one up on tywinâ yeahâ<U+0080> noâ â i cheered just like i did in the books just like i knew i would watching itâ the fight and the buildup were perfect the fight could have been longer but â<U+0080> getting two actors who have limited swordspear fighting abilities to choreograph a fight is â<U+0080> really fucking hard anything more would have been greedyâ plus the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to switch around from the books left us all wonderingâ<U+0080> hey could oberyn win this thing â and he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t it was fucking amazingâ â sad clown faces for everyoneâ â oh one more thingâ<U+0080> he screamed like a girlâ<U+0080> haâ â â the brothers kingslayers i love tyrion and jaime my two favorite characters along with stannisâ watching then poke fun at a â<U+0080><U+009C>simpleâ<U+0080><U+009D> relative was fantastic gallows humor for a man who was actually facing the gallowsâ and tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s preoccupation with a relative who squashed bugs was eerily similar to jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship with a king who killed people for byinlarge the same reasons â<U+0080><U+0093> because he couldâ listening them try to keep up their own spirits was touching and equally morbid like laughing at a funeralâ and it workedâ â the laughter of the girl with nothing to lose aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reaction to her auntâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was picturefucking perfectâ at that point how could you not laughâ no seriously whose alive at that point fuck it just sail to braavos and start life over as a monk who kills peopleâ ohâ<U+0080> wait â<U+0080> â the mother of the friend zone danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reactions to both melassandi and to jorah mormont were very good wise and emotionally chargedâ she trusted mormont she loved him and she wanted him to be by her side all the days throughâ but he was a spy he did lie to her and she had to throw him outâ i wish they had delved more into danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s conflict about the episode and how it hurt her to make him go and how she almost tried to keep him but she didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>tâ while i think that emilia clark did a lot of that with her face at the end its at best ambiguous as to whether or not tvdany is that conflictedâ i would have liked to see her at least upset over itâ her acting with mel assandi was also very good as she asked the questions that we probing and tough and showed a deft handâ â honorable mention to selmy who seemed to fit nicely in the whole episodeâ â on the fence on â the most deep meaningful and beautiful love story i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give a fuck about melassandi and grey wormâ<U+0080><U+0099>s emotional love story its depth honesty and beauty â<U+0080><U+0093> even the beauty of their two bodies in the water the unflinching charm of both a man and a woman admitting that they are pleased with seeing the other â and how the gruesomeness of grey wormâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mutilation makes mel wonder about him even the way they speak to each other it was deep rich and i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give one fuck at all about it not even a littleâ â they are thirdlevel characters in a single subset of a story and they are utterly uninteresting to the overall story arcâ i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about them i find it hard to believe anyone would careâ it was beautiful and rich and well done and extremely tasteful fuck we even had a very tasteful nude scene that did not make me want to question the mental health of the people making this show and i could not possibly care any less nor give less fucksâ if i had a fuck i would not give it to learn more about them or their love storyâ â dude we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t careâ â still it was touching and rich and bored the fuck out of meâ â i am ygritte the killer but â<U+0080> oh look babiesâ<U+0080>  i get why ygritte didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kill gilly but the place was literally flowing with bloodâ ygitte is like darth vader she can kill whomever

eyedkiller myselfâ i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know how come gilly and the baby deserve her mercy but not the girl whose throat she slashed just a few seconds beforeâ so sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s still good

scenes there was an opening and then a final cut dialog was spoken and heck there was actual plot development and story advancementâ yeah â â that was entirely â<U+0080> okayâ â â and nothing really of interestâ we saw everything we had seen before at winterfell ironborn turning on their own and with ramsey he goes back on his word because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a fucking assholeâ reek is scared of his own shadow and roose bolton is great when he is talkingâ itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not anything we had not seen before â â<U+0080> very â<U+0080> mediocreâ â what i did not like â arya stark is

scenes earlier roose was talking about his power when he was reminded that the two youngest starks are still aliveâ<U+0080> so he â<U+0080> does fucking nothingâ but here we have aryaâ and â<U+0080> and â<U+0080> nothing â yeah because thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s realistic because lf would not want to know because the realm would not want to knowâ why would you do thatâ why would you put that scene inâ yes i know the pay off was great arya laughing the absurdity of it allâ got itâ butâ<U+0080> holy hellâ<U+0080> people now know sansa is alive andâ<U+0080> nothingâ â yeah failâ â anyway this was an incredible episodeâ yeah it had a few uneven parts that were very â<U+0080><U+009C>mehâ<U+0080><U+009D> but the highpoints were exceptionalâ this is a great segue into the final two episodesâ â and

nice if you donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about all the stuff being eliminated from the books to incorporate their romanceâ but what was with missendeiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s delayed reaction in covering

on the head during his epic speech about capturing winterfellâ loved theon regressing into reek when challenged and then regaining his theonness when that guy was killedâ i liked how they showed the renaming of ramsay and the explanation that the boltons now  the northâ however they have done away with all other northerners in the show umbers mormonts etc so it will be strange ifwhen they show any sort of reactionrebellion against the boltonsâ also why did ramsay refer to â<U+0080><U+009C>a new homeâ<U+0080><U+009D> before he was legitimized â<U+0080><U+0093>he hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been

subsequently switched allegiencesâ wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a pardon from joffrey have made more senseâ<U+0080><U+0094>since that would demonstrate recent betrayalâ also i thought dany should have shown some indecision here based on the many things that jorah has done for herâ she always seemed ungrateful in the books but even there she wanted to forgive him and this made her seem doubly soâ

"Mladen",2014-06-01,"with a few misstep here and there this was rather interesting and for me as sansa fan truly memorable episode long story short sansa and oberyn ruled this unfortunately in different directions â the end was as gory as it should have been i know some viewers dont like it but the books leave no imagination to what has happened there and the duel was nicely done the oberyns mobility was something expected and there was a nice flow to it liked how he handled the spear it was indeed nicely done i loved the keeping you raped her you murdered her you killed her children and pascal was absolutely phenomenal in making each of those times slightly more irritated i am sincerely pleased at how show maintained the twist we have in books and how our hopes were crushed in the very same cruel way it was done in the books i assume the unsullied rage has went over the top â on the other hand we have from aurora to maleficent sansa stark the end is there this is all we have from sansa in terms of book material and i believe that we have concluded with her this year how i feel about this is another story this was truly from zero to hero transformation and although it felt a bit too fast this was something that truly opens entire array of possibilities now we can either conclude that alayne stone is the mask that never went deep in sansas psyche or at least that is where the show is heading tbh there is a huge gap between sansas alayne in tv and sansas alayne in the books this transformation was in terms of her playing the game phenomenal but there is a feeling that tv sansa is going into if not warrior princess mode than in some sort of ice queen which again can be problematic i do find her acknowledgement of what lf wants rather interesting and i assume that this indeed is twow spoilers in which sansa realizes what lf wants from her as for the vamp costume we should never forget one thing  she sow it she made that costume she was the one who made her look that way not lf or anyone else sansa has turned herself into a player and that can go in many directions all and all if we are to end her storyline this year it is in many ways interesting ending now at least no one can argue that she is silly little girl â eta let we not forget a bit crowish appeal of sansa bloodraven much â in conclusion interesting episode with sansa and oberyn taking the crown this week both turner and pascal were amazing and truly wonderful addition to the cast i am going to miss pascal as i miss oberyn edited by mladen 01 june 2014  1020 pm"

"go joff go",2014-06-02,"really found to episode to be excellent and actually pretty hysticarical which was needed given the weight of the oberyn death scene the serious turn with jorahs departure and tyrions impending change of sceneryâ â that stretch of 10 minutes or so though where we got arya laughing after hearing her aunt was dead while sandor stands dumbfounded littlefinger mentioning some people die on their chamber pots wink wink nudge nudge and then the faces jaime and tyrion make while imitating the beetlesmashing was just fantastic if someone findsmakes a gif of that last scene please let me know its gold â great ep imo everyone is focusing on the chamber pot comment but does anyone think the dying on the bed and at a dinner comment is actually foreshadowing too lot of people speculate that cersei will be strangled in her sleep i wonder who might die at a dinner"
"Alex21",2014-06-02,"â thought it was an excellent scene showed us tyrions mental state with the fear of possibly facing his own death that is completely out of his own hands and trying to find meaning behind the possibly meaningless like wondering if god or the gods are just a kid with a magnifying glass burning aunts when he gets bored â â â yes exactly tyrion spells out why asoiaf is so compelling the horror of insatiable sociopaths running amok â also provided a nice recap of the entire episode wildlings slaughtering people in moles town ramsay needlessly flaying and killing every ironborn littlefinger being littlefinger â there are a lot of ways to interpret tyrions dialogue but as i see we all get similar conclusions is for this kind of dialogues why i like the series because the showrunners make you think and analize what is really happening and not only show you sex blood and war"
"Tony Stark",2014-06-02,"happy to see im not alone here  my least favorite episode to date i love the justifications im seeing here for the beetle scene as well because using someone with a mental handicap as an analogy for the blind evils in the world somehow became synonymous with good writing on a positive note the fight was accurate enough for me not to have any glaring complaints regardless of how difficult it was to watch â â i see a heartfelt and introspective monologue illuminating the fundamental values and beliefs your beloved soon to be dead brother lived by just as good as what grrm has in the books labeling it as bad writing because it isnt true to the mythos of the books or whatever absurd criteria you have is just bad form considering there are too few scenes to even compare it too in the series you can ignore the books and be glad they get character developemnt like this in the show if you dont like the rare chance to have a 5 minuteish stretch for one character to show his chops and really delve into his character i dont know why you are even still watching the show edited by tony stark 02 june 2014  1206 am"

"Not Dead Just Broken",2014-06-02,"there is one incorrect way to interpret it and its this that its pointless and adds nothing to the narrativeâ that story adds a lot to tyrions character development where his character is going why he suddenly slips into sherlock scan mode in adwd material and a layer of absurdity in this world of cracksack it also reflects on a lot of other arcs aryas murder motives briennes fruitless search cerseis idiocy and handling the realm ramsays brutality danys fumbling of the responsibilities of ruling etc â its there for a reason and it works sorry beetle haters but deal with itâ â definitely not pointlessâ i thought it as more of a hey were about to do something that will make no sense to you and we realize weve been doing this for a while kind of prepping the nonreaders for tyrion losing the trial by combat"

"Damorian",2014-06-02,"not bad and while it was gorliy effective in terms of what was there im slightly gobsmacked they left the much hyped trial by combat to the last rushed five minutes much as per the bear pit scene in e08 last year â couldnt believe it when i looked at the clock it was nearing the 50 min mark and the fight had only just got going presumed that like the purple wedding it was pretty much locked to be a 1520 minute segment at least weird â overall all i love the show and the hard work that goes into it so will be sticking with it in s5 but tbh by this point in s4 they also seem to have replicated the massive problem of season 2 with their finale big time ie left way too much for even a marginally extended final episode â the certain upshot now since e09 seems solely centred on the wall and the battle for castle black is that one or more of the remaining plotlines will end up feeling rushed and shortchanged in a 60 minute finale and no it wont be 66 at all after titles credits andor recap more like 60 tops knowing that is sadly based on past experience â thats not really a statement of opinion having followed this show from the beginning and watched how it either allocates too much time or subtracts too little time from scenes  especailly when placed under pressure of the clock  its more one based on mathematical fact â the good news i fully expect them to nail tyrions climactic scenes in 4x10 but at what cost whose story will end up becoming the new what the hell just happened with theon at winterfell or houses of healing condensed and truncated into baffling insignificance which massively powerful moment will come out robbwinddisappointing in the wash â since theyve clearly excised aryas vision of nymeria this is arguably the episode that should at least have established some hanging freys showing up with salt stuffed in their mouths in the riverlands they didnt so if ls does show prepare yourself for cries of jumping the shark  deus ex machina from nonreaders because of that frustrating oversightâ  zero set up has been done â ideally this one would have been a longer 5859 mins cut â they needed to check in with bran and co â they needed to effect the hounds demise at least in part much better set up here admittedly and get arya in position ready from braavos â they needed to squeeze at least one iota of emotion from kit harrington who has been appalling this season where ive always defended his acting in the past â ditto emilia clarke whose coldly imperious queen routine is wearing so thin now it almost robbed another rushed hugely rushed through scene in the banishment of jorah of any real sense of this being a twoway tragedy so thank god for ramins score and ian glenn â its also worth bearing in mind that as good as it may be the watchers on the wall is highly unlikely to surpass blackwater in peoples minds especially since characters like jon ygritte  stannis are among the lesser favourites performancewise compared to the kings landing crowd it can compete sfxwise but thats about it most likely â which means that taken as a whole so much is riding on the finale as to how s4 will be remembered success or patchy failure â trashing things is not in my nature so hope springs eternal and all that  but my gut feeling by this point if im honest no matter how hard i try to banish it is that despite some standout scenes in individual episodes time is running out to stop season 4 becoming the runt of the litter â prove me wrong show prove me wrong â â  edited by damorian 02 june 2014  0340 am"
"ovis alba",2014-06-02,"the beetle story was weird i sort of got the point put it just felt like it took away time from other stuff and i was waiting the whole time for some sort of evil tyrion who in the end admits that he just started smashing beetles himself to see what is the point and realised it just feels damn good and powerful and then smashing the beetle in his hands"
"aussiegirl",2014-06-02,"that was a very good episode and very rough to watch â i honestly can say that there wasnt any scene i didnt like and the acting was top notch except for sansas scene where she is sewing sophie turner swallowed half her words there â loved the whole aryahound scene like that there are so many interpretations about why she laughed and their discussion about killers although im not sure how they are going to end them for the season they only have one more episode left and that one is packed â really liked littlefinger in this episode i hope they are going to do something interesting with little robin because hes not supposed to make it i actually hope he does i hope he grows up to become lord of the vale in his own right and screws everyone elses plans up â roose is back i only like ramsay when he is with roose still dont care about theonreek â im not sure why everyone keeps saying that arya outed herself it was the hound that did that"

on the head during his epic speech about capturing winterfellâ loved theon regressing into reek when challenged and then regaining his theonness when that guy was killedâ i liked how they showed the renaming of ramsay and the explanation that the boltons now  the northâ however they have done away with all other northerners in the show umbers mormonts etc so it will be strange ifwhen they show any sort of reactionrebellion against the boltonsâ also why did ramsay refer to â<U+0080><U+009C>a new homeâ<U+0080><U+009D> before he was legitimized â<U+0080><U+0093>he hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been

less likely it is to stay a secretâ also it looks like they may be heading for â<U+0080><U+009C>relationsâ<U+0080><U+009D> between â<U+0080><U+009C>manipulativeâ<U+0080><U+009D> sansa and petyrâ not

subsequently switched allegiencesâ wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a pardon from joffrey have made more senseâ<U+0080><U+0094>since that would demonstrate recent betrayalâ also i thought dany should have shown some indecision here based on the many things that jorah has done for herâ she always seemed ungrateful in the books but even there she wanted to forgive him and this made her seem doubly soâ instead we got her imperiousness daenerys stormbornâ also why wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t she looking at jorah when condemning him the way she was looking over him seemed stupid to meâ i would have been okay if i thought it meant indecision but it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t appear to â a random crackpot theory popped into my head in this sceneâ<U+0080><U+0094>barristanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dismissal from the kg by cersei and joffrey was a sham and a way to get him into danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s inner circle so that he can hurt her from within her own army â the hound and arya â<U+0080><U+0093> nice foreshadowing to her future as a faceless person including her ability to kill people in whatever manner was availableâ i liked the irony of them arriving at the eyrie after lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s deathâ however i would have preferred it to be clearer that her laughing was hysteria not humorâ<U+0080> â as much as i adore jaime and tyrion together i thought that scene was painfully longâ i would have preferred to spend the time with oberyn â the trial â<U+0080><U+0093> pedro pascal is the man and killed this scene until it killed himâ his lines could have been cheesy but he delivered them wellâ that flipping around and fighting was awesomeâ only issues i had were no â<U+0080><U+009C>eliiiiiaaaaâ<U+0080><U+009D>but ill survive and the exploding melon headcâ<U+0080><U+0099>mon special effects you could have done betterâ iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not a fan of seeing bodily functions on the screen but tyrion vomiting would have been great hereâ this scene could have been a couple of minutes longer too to include more of the preparation the pardon wasnt 3 years late nor from robert baratheon but was rather a cunning tywin lannister removing one of danis two seasoned westerosi advisers by exposing his past transgressions they talked about her a couple episodes back in a session of the small council and tywin was informed that she has able advisors at her side in classic tywin fashion he sent a letter in a dead mans name that he knew would drive a wedge in her advisors and of course poor robert baratheon will get the blame for the exposing of norah while tywin keeps his hand clean like he did with the red wedding by letting the hate fall mostly on the freys"

"Haldebrandt",2014-06-02,"not bad and while it was gorliy effective in terms of what was there im slightly gobsmacked they left the much hyped trial by combat to the last rushed five minutes much as per the bear pit scene in e08 last year â couldnt believe it when i looked at the clock it was nearing the 50 min mark and the fight had only just got going presumed that like the purple wedding it was pretty much locked to be a 1520 minute segment at least weird â overall all i love the show and the hard work that goes into it so will be sticking with it in s5 but tbh by this point in s4 they also seem to have replicated the massive problem of season 2 with their finale big time ie left way too much for even a marginally extended final episode â the certain upshot now since e09 seems solely centred on the wall and the battle for castle black is that one or more of the remaining plotlines will end up feeling rushed and shortchanged in a 60 minute finale and no it wont be 66 at all after titles credits andor recap more like 60 tops knowing that is sadly based on past experience â thats not really a statement of opinion having followed this show from the beginning and watched how it either allocates too much time or subtracts too little time from scenes  especailly when placed under pressure of the clock  its more one based on mathematical fact â the good news i fully expect them to nail tyrions climactic scenes in 4x10 but at what cost whose story will end up becoming the new what the hell just happened with theon at winterfell or houses of healing condensed and truncated into baffling insignificance which massively powerful moment will come out robbwinddisappointing in the wash â since theyve clearly excised aryas vision of nymeria this is arguably the episode that should at least have established some hanging freys showing up with salt stuffed in their mouths in the riverlands they didnt so if ls does show prepare yourself for cries of jumping the shark  deus ex machina from nonreaders because of that frustrating oversightâ  zero set up has been done â ideally this one would have been a longer 5859 mins cut â they needed to check in with bran and co â they needed to effect the hounds demise at least in part much better set up here admittedly and get arya in position ready from braavos â they needed to squeeze at least one iota of emotion from kit harrington who has been appalling this season where ive always defended his acting in the past â ditto emilia clarke whose coldly imperious queen routine is wearing so thin now it almost robbed another rushed hugely rushed through scene in the banishment of jorah of any real sense of this being a twoway tragedy so thank god for ramins score and ian glenn â its also worth bearing in mind that as good as it may be the watchers on the wall is highly unlikely to surpass blackwater in peoples minds especially since characters like jon ygritte  stannis are among the lesser favourites performancewise compared to the kings landing crowd it can compete sfxwise but thats about it most likely â which means that taken as a whole so much is riding on the finale as to how s4 will be remembered success or patchy failure â trashing things is not in my nature so hope springs eternal and all that  but my gut feeling by this point if im honest no matter how hard i try to banish it is that despite some standout scenes in individual episodes time is running out to stop season 4 becoming the runt of the litter â prove me wrong show prove me wrong â â  thank you for expressing my feelings exactly â pillars stones and beetles wasted at least 10 invaluable minutes"

"Lord Martin",2014-06-02,"i love the double meanings of some episode titles â the mountain and the viper is facially a reference to oberyn and gregor clegane â but a second mountain looms large in this episode the eyrie â the only question is who is the viper sansa or little finger â â i thought this was one of the elite episodes i even liked the bit with the beetles â"
"Girlicious",2014-06-02,"but his arrogance got the best of him instead of being satisfied with what he had he overreached and it cost him his life â i disagree with that oberyn is kind of arrogant selfconfident for sure but the reason why he dragged the fight on is because he wanted a confession out of gregor he wanted to confront tywin about the order he most likely gave gregor he got careless i would give you that but not arrogent"

"SerArthurHeath",2014-06-02,"i liked the sansa changes and think they may mirror what happens in the book possibly revealing herself is still the ace she has left though it will play out differently with other characters there lf looked really dangerous when he asked sansa if she thought she knew him and that reminded us that frankly we have no idea what he really plans theres no way hes been square with sansa or anyone hes revealed his motivations to in the book or the show the arya reveal will lead to nothing could have done with longer wall scene liked dany didnt mind the grey worm stuff jaime and tyrion is always good but i too would rather have dorne and the martell kids and myrcella mentioned liked the trial comments about promising not to die aside oberyn really looked like he was going to win and the mountain was good we are going off the book plot and i can see big differences in the next season but i also think the overall ending will change so im not too fussed the things they are missing im guessing they will try and shove into next season which will be clumsy but is their mo some plot holes theyve made for themselves but the acting rescues this and the odd sequential order of the episode because everyone smashed their roles out of the park this week and the new stuff is hit and miss but entertaining at least i was really happy with sophie gillen pedro and alfie in particular"

"northernwarg",2014-06-04,"i read this on another board about the orson story â i laughed for about five minutes after this episode aired dont misunderstand me its tragic what happened tonight the show introduced a compelling character and spent the majority of the season fleshing him out beautifully giving him purpose and deftly balancing his humor with pathos he heroically fights for tyrion in a visceral battle with the mountain filled with kinetic bravado and just when you think hell achieve catharsis hes thwarted he gets his confession as his eyes are gouged out and hes cranially decimated cersei smiles tywin sentences his son to death and tyrion stares dumbfounded why refer to the penultimate scene between tyrion and jamie they talk of their simple cousin who spent his days smashing beetles tyrion is fascinated by his moronic actions while family legacies and targaryen dragons fade into the background all thats left is the sound of the killingsâ and i still couldnt figure out why he was doing it and i had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reasonâ orson gave no answer and he kept on killing until he was kicked in the chest by a mule and died this is coen brothers level absurdity and at the end of this episode not only did oberyns death make sense but everything else did as well suddenly everything from the red wedding to ned starks death was put sharply into perspective george r r martin is the cousin killing beetles and the only thing left to do isâ laugh beautifully put i loved how pascal and the writers brought oberyn to the screen  equally the tyrionjaimie scene was masterful â i thought the change of pace the existential absurdity of the beetles monologue the chemistry between two brothers remembering shared moments of their childhood together and  as you point out the structural emphasis it gives to the pointlessness of the game was excellent until you linked to the arya laughing gif i hadnt consciously realized that this too was my overall reaction to oberyns heroic fail tyrions predicament and of course aryas"

"ohpooratlas",2014-06-01,"my highest rated episode of the season i gave it a 9 there were so many fantastically acted scenes alifie allen as theonreek jorahs banishment sansa during the trial and the end omg â the beetle monologue was just wtf though â missendei and greyworm are very endearing but again  it would have been nice if they used that time to build up the actual title of the episodeâ"

"Dirk blitzen",2014-06-01,"gave it 9 i loved all the plotlines this episode the writing was top notch for dd the rest of their episodes this season were mediocre for me i agree with ran regarding the editing of the fight scene but it still was effective no idea why people are complaining about the beetle speech feels like to me that people were just mad that it replaced the oberyntyrion scene with the poisoned spear the speech had humor pathos and a great fucking metaphor also to the poisoned spear not being mentioned it was set up with the houndarya scene and will obviously pay off in episode 10 i think the show did it better then the book honestly knowing the spear was poisoned before the fight began always took out all investment for me cause either way the mountain would die boring sansas acting was top notch sophie turners acting as sansa acting was also top notch it was only a 9 out of 10 cause the whole jorah pardon strained credibility for me edited by dirk blitzen 01 june 2014  1010 pm"
"Gvn2Fly",2014-06-01,"i voted a 7 but i debated giving it a 6 â the fight was amazing but there were other parts of this episode i didnt care for fyi  i am not a book reader i was not interested in the grey worm romance the bolton stuff was kind of dull and the beetle story went on too long with no payoff â the jorah banishment felt rushed â as far as dany knows jorah was still spying on her because he made no mention of ever stopping â even it would have made no difference i would have rather seen him try to defend himself than one of the grey worm scenes â i really expected better"

"SweetJeyne",2014-06-01,"1010 this was my favorite episode of the season and i thought it built up nicely the slamdunk ending i liked the shading in of sansas character and her growing adroitness at playing the game as well as the subtle hints that shes knowingly using littlefingers attraction to her and possibly reciprocates it â i actually kinda like the missandeigrey worm subplot in large part because both actors are gorgeous im glad they agedup missandei â the fight was possibly the best fight ever on the show though im heartbroken we wont see pedro pascal again and the look on ellarias face when her beloved prince of dorne dies was also heartbreaking theirs is one of westeross few enduring loves and i really believed their passion for and devotion to each other as well as ellarias absolute faith in oberyn edited by sweetjeyne 01 june 2014  1019 pm"
"jarl the climber",2014-06-01,"i gave in an 8 i agree that the scene with arya did not really make sense robin arynn is her cousin there is no way that she is not let into the vale at the very least a message would be sent to determine what should be done and in the meantime she is going no where now i could see them not believing that she is arya but this guy at least acted like he bought it so it doesnt work i think i can see where they are going with it and i think it could have been handled better sansas stuff was more good than bad but it was a little mixed nothing else really stands out to me right now im interested about lindas exact criticism and why she rated it so low its not perfect episode certainly its not great as an adaptation but from what i have seen the more casual fans who have not read the books found this episode very enjoyable"
"SerJeremiahLouistark",2014-06-01,"pretty good episode oberyn carried it with his performance the bolton now bolton scene was cool dont care for the grey worm love angle whats that about and the modifications in sansas arc are intriguing overall it was a good episode oh missed the dude getting chopped up during the duel and wow clegane squished his head like a grape"

"Ice_Specter",2014-06-01,"wrestled with the score for this one and ive decided that im just going to go all in with it  its a 6 for me thats the third episode ive rated a 6 across the whole series â why littlefinger the man without a plan dimishing the character yet further and needlessly dark queen sansa so hamfisted aryas reveal and the sinking feeling that the next time we see the hound and arya theyll be trudging back down the high road unmolested with no one think that maybe they should inform robin arryn or petyr baelish the endless orson speech the heartfelt promise that he wouldnt die telegraphing that he was indeed going to die the horribly frenetic editing of the fight scene the direction choices that left it impersonal the choreography that necessitated so much stunt double work which meant less intimate scenes and poor pacing it just was not good at all for what should have been the most memorable fight scene in the novels they turned in something that was frankly forgettable up to the final moment â the good stuff the attack on moles town the missandeigrey worm material the sansa and littlefinger dialog after she revealed herself to the vale lords moat cailin pedro pascals performance â agree"
"Ser Not Appearing",2014-06-01,"so much naturally begins to feel rushed with this many storylines in play overall and in a single episode i dont mind that except when they add unnecessary stuff that i view as lacking of added value like missandeigrey worm dont add any of the stuff you had to cut from the books just cut that story line and flesh out other parts of the episode and itll improve the product good and bad in the fight scene but i expected that satisfied with the ending but still this episode was a microcosm of my overall feel which is that the show is good but i always feel it could be better its a solid adaptation and one im very happy exists i look forward to it every week the source material is so good though and so much of this show is pure success that it makes the misses that much more of a let down edited by ser not appearing 01 june 2014  1024 pm"

"Ruin",2014-06-01,"some of the added content was really hard to watchâ the duel was goodcouldve been longer wo the beetle speechâ in fact i wish they had a scene with tywin raving about duel acknowledging that itll turnout bad for house lannister no matter the outcomeâ the scene with littlefinger talking to the vale lords about whose left to contend with the lannisters left it wide open for tywin to now express the inevitable shitstorm that could errupt in dorne â the bolton scene was great father and sonâ theon was also really goodâ i only wish we couldve got a victarion or euron namedropreference here â instead of all the really bad filler content why not use the book materialâ its not that difficult"

"The Dragon Demands",2014-06-02,"i rated it an 8 well maybe 85â it was very strong acting throughout though marginally the episode wasnt as solid as last weekâ elyo didnt seem to like the daenerys vs jorah acting that she should have been raging at him think how she raged at viserys it will be the last time you have handsbut i think what they were trying to do was have her in tranquil fury modeâ she didnt rave at mirri maz duur she just coldly killed herâ being terse like that indirectly hints that she is deeply hurt but trying to hold back her anguish along with her rageâ yeah it could have been more but on the other hand you cant have everyone overacting and raging all the timeâ i thought it entirely goodâ as for the ongoing missandeigrey worm stuff its obviously a departure from the books shes a ten year old hes a eunuchâ but that doesnt make it inherently bad its written and acted well enough i just get nervous about where theyre headed but thats for another dayâ but i remember the line in the books that just because a eunuch does not have a mans parts does not mean he also does not have a mans heartâ as elyo said good to see that theyre treating the secondary characters in daeneryss storyline as having emotionssubplots outside of herâ moles town short but too the point castle black scene also short and perfunctory but entirely fineâ so the storylines at the wall and in meereen were fine all of the ramsayreekroose scenes were amazingâ this leaves us with the eyrie and kings landingâ well to start with the tyrionjaime beetles thing wasnt really bad its just that it wasnt worth 4 fing minutes of screentimeâ it was confusing at first but by the end i understood tyrions point about wondering why senseless violence beyond our control happens and hed feel better just knowing a reason whyâ in contrast to elyo i thought it well acted and nothing was inherently wrong with it and i didnt quite feel it dragged but it should have been shorter as for the fight itselfyeahâ the acting was fineâ but the fight choreography we can blame squarely on the directorâ i mean compare this to the intimacy of the nedjaime fight or bronnvardis fight from season 1â they didnt have enough closeup shotsâ possibly because they needed to use stunt doubles for oberynâ it wasnt an outright bad fight choreography it just wasnt the stunning fight described in the booksâ i like it more on rewatchâ elyo often has strong opinions on the actual fight choreography let me clarify that im actually not as versedopinionated on that frotn what im annoyed about is the editing and cinematography of the fight the cameraworkâ it doesnt outright detract from the episode for me i just wanted it to be even more intenseâ i can see why you would compare this to the tv red wedding though theyre also quite different categories to compare while tv first fans were in awe at the simple fact that they killed off robb which is something martin and not the tv show invented the actual choreography of the massacre would have been better with a few tweaksi dont know if a tv show can build up dread as easily as a book can without spoiling whats about to happen but they could at least have had the moment where dacey mormont is the only one who nearly escapes the hall only to be killed by the boltons as the enterâ but i digress long story short only complaint so far is that the camerawork on the oberyngregor fight should have been much more intense akin to the last trial by combat between bronn and vardisâ not that it outright detracts from the show for me i usually dont worry about action stuff but plottingâ and the beetle discussion wasnt actually bad it just shouldnt have taken up four full minutes  because that time could have been given to other kl characters as for the eyrieyeah â well the first and biggest thing is the massive change of having sansa reveal her identity to the high lords of the vale though only 3 of them and they promise to keep it a secretâ then they flat out have the hound announce that arya stark is at the bloody gatewhen arya has been presumed dead for about three years nowâ again as elyo pointed out this isnt necessarily bad but it raises major questions about where theyre heading with all of thisâ i thought the arya reaction bitterly laughing about her bad luck was entirely noteperfectâ it reminded me of that moment in titus andronicus when after titus learns that his daughter has been maimed her hands and tongue cut off his two sons sentence to death and the emperor said he might pardon them if titus cut off his own hand and sent it to hima messenger returns with his two sons heads and his hand sent back in mockeryâ titus then bursts out laughing because he has not a tear left in his head anthony hopkins was amazing in thisâ aryaâ when will this fearful slumber have an end theyre all over the place with littlefinger and while his acting was okay now i still wish theyd shown him with more of a plan though i acknowledge that changing around a reveal of sansas identity may have necessitated this or enough that i dont mindâ so my only real complaints wereâ the duel editing of possibly the biggest one on one duel in the narrative needed to be a lot better than it was though it was servicable enough in writingactingâ apparently directors minahan and kirk who directed the nedjaime and bronnvardis fights in season 1 havent been working on the show since early season 3 and graves once was one of my favorites for kissed by fire but has lost major points after the debacle of the jaimecersei scene in breaker of chains though im not sure if the writers ordered him to film it that wayâ second the beetle scene was fine but should have been two minutes not fourâ thirdwtfâ okay they reveal sansas identity but only to three lords who then promise to keep it a secret and whom littlefinger was going to reveal her identity to eventually in the booksbut aryaâ just announcing arya stark is alive  not inherently bad but where are they going with this"

"Velociraptor",2014-06-02,"this episode was weak filled with unnecessary things from the very beginning the whole gilly in molestown seemed like a stupid idea from the very first but at least i was hoping it would lead to interesting consequences that depart from the books i should have learned from the example that was set by previous episodes of course it didnt as per usual the writers make a departure from the books and then seems like they dont have the balls to follow through with the consequences so they make up some silly situation which brings the things back on track and renders pretty much the entire setting to pointless filler its as if someone on the writing team suddenly said wait guys this is a poor idea lets scrap that and they didâ same issue with jorah receiving his pardon several years late he actually already received his pardon back in season 1 why would another arrive so late well the simple explanation would be the writers going oh shit we totally changed that and created a butterfly effect but now we have to get things back on track with the book so lets write around the things we changed hopefully no one will notice the plotholes granted the very dismissal scene was powerful enough thanks to iain glens great acting and even emilia clarke managed to show what remotely resembled emotion so i guess i could pardon that what i couldnt pardon however is the absolutely pointless thing that is the missandeigrey worm romance i mean really seems as though they were just filling the amount of tits per episode quota perhaps as an apology for skipping out on daenerys sex scene in the last episode which i didnt mind because missandei is gorgeus but afterwards were given a conversation that is so clichee its cringeworthy such scenes serve no purpose other than to cater to the shallow watchers either those who watch the show for the tits or watch it to get teary eyed at cute romance couplesâ â the jaimetyrion conversation started out well enough i just love the scenes between these two this is what you do when you make a change from the books if youre gonna have jaime in kings landing earlier you give him more scenes with tyrion which works out very well since both are amazing actors on the other hand the conversation about beetles dragged on for far too long consequently the trial felt rushed more about that later i did like the entire theon and the boltons sequence especially how they showed roose the show needs more scenes with him seeing how many nonbook readers i know have a hard time grasping who the guy is at allâ â now the thing everyones been looking for the trial well the combat itself was done well enough skipped out on realism in favor of cinematic spear spins and leaping around but i guess i can live with that movies and tv shows always overexaggerate combat scenes but the whole thing felt rushed nonetheless i wish they had taken several minutes out of unnecessary scenes like scrapped missandeigrey worm romance and added that to the trial characters more dialogue more exposition more crowd reactions more everythingâ â all in all i felt like this episode was very lackluster while it delivers the sort of unexpected gutpuncher ending as has become the series trademark in both the books and the show it failed to deliver in nearly every other scene i would rank this a 4 out of 10 to me this was the weakest episode this season by far and quite possibly the weakest episode in the series altogetherâ"

"amaterasu",2014-06-02,"i liked this episode very much this is why i rated it with 910 there are several scenes i adored and overall i believe the episode was very well made even though the beginning is perhaps a little boring compared to our possible expectations to be read â<U+0080><U+009D>fight in the first seconds of the episode pleaseâ<U+0080><U+009D> i do think that every unsatisfactory sentiment towards the matter has been erased at the end of the episode oh and what an endingâ i thought in the beginning that i wasnt going to find out anything about prince oberyn in this episode and was disappointed because of it however i was glad to find out in the end that the episode was still about the fight between oberyn and clegane the mountain after seeing their fight and finishing the episode i concluded more or less happily that this was a splendid episodeâ â now lets explain why i liked the episodeâ first and foremost i loved the fight â the duel between clegane and oberyn i expected to seewatch something quite overwhelming and the show didnt disappoint me in that i found myself hating the author hating the show hating everything after oberyns death as i kept him as a very dear character and liked him very much hoped he wouldnt die after recollecting myself i realised i loved everything about it it was so well made i liked oberyns show before the duel i loved the way he duelled even though his death would have been avoided if he wasnt so arrogant so conceited but hey thats the thing i liked about him in the first place besides his handsomeness and accent the mountain played his role flawlessly the beast the killing machine the mad man  compared to oberyn he was indeed a horrible beast the contrast was amazing i liked the way they fought and i would love to rewatch it but i am afraid the disturbing way in which oberyn died is too much for my heart it was stupendous stupendous is such a freaky word i just think the fight was exciting even though i felt extremely sad after oberyns death sobsob cerseis smile claiming her victory with a perfect expression i dislike cersei  i always have but what i must say is that the character in itself deems sometimes some sort of peculiar respect she is a strong character maleficent ugly yet she doesnt fail in shinning and getting whatever she wants this time as well we could all see her triumphant smile glad the mountain killed oberyn glad she would finally see the imp die i really really dislike cersei and like tyrion as a matter of fact but i have to admit that i loved and hated that smile it was just realistic and it pointed out perfectly cerseis character desires plans etc it was a very good moment i believe â arya starks laughâ was insanely refreshing somehow i loved the way she laughed  i wondered whether she laughed at the irony of her life everyone is dying look the aunt died as well isnt it funny it was refreshing in an insane way because it could not possibly be positively refreshing i wonder if she wanted to take it as a joke i am curious about the next episode regarding her outcome  i really dont want her to end up â<U+0080><U+009D>underâ<U+0080><U+009D> baelishs â<U+0080><U+009D>wingâ<U+0080><U+009D> however even though aryas appearance was too poor in this episode because of her few appearances she played her part flawlessly as far as i am concerned she is one of my favourite characters but i am afraid to confess we just know how the author kills everyone â sansas comebackâ or should i say â<U+0080><U+009D>sansas reinventionâ<U+0080><U+009D> i am not sure about this though i liked how she started to lie about lysas death  dont like either of them so i didnt really care about it but it is a nice turn of events and i am curious about how rotten sansa can become i have huge expectations with regard to this matter maybe if she becomes rotten enough and overcomes her stupidity maybe then she will be at least interesting and not only annoying i liked the way she lied yes because for the first time in her life she didnt bore me or plainly annoyed me period â ser jorahs dismissalâ and prince oberyns death were the saddest and best moments of this episode as far as i am concerned i like jorah and dont want him to leave khaleesis side but i guess he has to and i really wonder what he is going to do i loved the scene because he had very nice expressions and dani was so bitchy with him that the entire moment was worth it what can i say i felt like crying then because i presumed jorah would get either killed either pardoned and ignored  but no even worse than that he was dismissed to return to his â<U+0080><U+009D>mastersâ<U+0080><U+009D> to kings landing somehow i thought this to be much more tragic than getting killed or ignored i am already missing him  i think it was a very important detail in this episodeâ ramsay snow becomes ramsay bolton isnt that something we should be celebrating i like this characters twisted mind and expressions and overall i believe he does a very good role i like him therefore i like the moments in which he appears  it was somehow interesting to be given the name of his father finally  the moment wasnt so important i suppose but i do think that some important things might come out of this i think this is one of the moment when we fully understand his character and his power of driving others mad look at poor reek past theon greyjoy a toy in a snows hands isnt he the little twisted fellow it wasnt much compared to other episodes but i think it was an important moment and again â the mountain killing oberyn  one of the most disturbing scenes in the entire series i was overwhelmed petyr baelish hadnt had any interesting scenes in this episode i like him because of the complexity and simplicity of his character he is a moron and i am really looking forward to his death which i dont think will come any time soon  i am not reading the books it is just a mere wish one has he has such a nice face it would look good on a spike i also want to see how robin is going to â<U+0080><U+009D>evolveâ<U+0080><U+009D> i have my presuppositions regarding his fate but i will keep any other comments for myself for the being momentâ john snow didnt appear much in this episode and i wasnt moved by sams sentimentalism what moved me was the other guys speech i dont know his name the one who poured the wine and said that whoever dies last should be a good fellow and burn all the others i am curious about how the night watch is going to react whenif the wildlings attack them looking forward to this  the scene when the wildlings killed those people didnt move me as it was expected but i liked how ingrid didnt kill sams girlfriend and her child that was perhaps a good sign at least an interesting one â liked the episode though the duel was the biggest hit of the episode  its what made it so greatâ"

"The onion wight",2014-06-02,"there are posters whod give a got episode a nine or ten if they broadcast a blank screen anyhoo i gave this weeks effort a seven liked anything north related like the bolton scenes theyre much more prominent than in the books and rightly so just disappointed that when ramsay got all mushy after roose legitimized him roose didnt turn around and put him in his place with that line sansa scenes ok like how theyre going with her character but unfortunately by making lf look like a pussy jorah being banished whats her name playing dany couldnt act her way out of a wet paper bag she has one expression and my god shes going to use it but the actor playing jorah was as usual excellent and he just about saved it big disappointment for me was the dual damn that sucked arse it was too short and mostly consisted of the red viper performing silly ballet dancing in cut aways and twirling his spear around a lot it was bloody silly the whole point of the scene which i thought they were going to show after making a big deal out of oberyn going in with light armor was the difference in speed and reach but nope the mountain was felled by a guy piercing plate armour with a wooden spear fuck me so all in all a slight meh not bad but could have been better almost unforgivable how they messed up one of the greatest mano o manos in fantasy literature and lets hope for better next week"

"Tywin's bastard",2014-06-02,"a bit up and down but the main thing that lingers with me is oberyn pedro pascal has been amazing in this role and has really brought life to the character in that way that a tv show or a movie can do better than a book  if the actor is up to the task its been a bit different but thats fine by me as a good book will always tell a longer story better so im happy with getting to experience this story in a different way so its not just an inferior version the death of oberyn touched me more than i thought it would and thats all due to the presence that pascal has brought during this season well done â as for the mentioned thing about he signaling his death by saying that hes not going to die thats no different than tyrion and jaime doing the standard build up of the seemingly insurmountable threat so the victory will be surprising and even sweeter so i dont buy that the show told the ending in advance"

"Rashtibram",2014-06-02,"im honestly surprised by all the people claiming the beetle monologue served no purpose or that they didnt understand its significance after all the complaints about how overthetop the show is and how it spoonfeeds things to the audience nobody seems to understand whats happening when they decide to throw in a minor dose of subtlety â i suppose it has many interpretations but i think the intended one was this orson represents the gods who are supposedly judging tyrion at his trial the gods who are responsible for the red wedding and all the atrocities committed in the show so far and tyrion was desperately searching for a reason for these atrocities only to find that there was none and that the gods were simply handicapped people smashing beetles an intelligent viewer might have analyzed that scene and the delicious transition into the start of the trial and concluded that oberyn was indeed going to be another smashed beetle and that makes it extremely important in its own way you can argue the metaphor was hamfisted but please stop postulating that the writers were only thinking duh we like nikolaj and dinklage lets give them a scene together becauseâ<U+0080> when they wrote the scene â eta about the duelâ<U+0080>i think they and us hyped it up far too much it was never going to match expectations at least not in the way blackwater and the rains of castamere did i do think they could have made a lot more out of it added some appropriate music the realism vibe isnt something to strive for on this occasion imo made the cinematography more closeup and involved shown oberyns growing rage and drive for vengeanceâ<U+0080>but these are all things iâ wish i could have seen and not things that were bad about what i saw as such being letdown doesnt equate to thinking the episode was bad it was a great hour of tv even by got standards i place it 15th out of 38 on my evergrowing besttoworst scale below a golden crown and ahead of the ghost of harrenhal edited by haldir monark 02 june 2014  0338 pm"

"Ravi Seaworth",2014-06-03,"unlike many of you i liked the first half of the episode as usual set up simply i think the acting was good especially in the eyrie and with the boltons the scene with missandei was normal but the interaction between danny and jorah was good different from everything we have seen from daenerys moles town was indeed a little more of â redundant violence given what we saw in previous episodes aryas seemed ridiculous at first but to the unsullied viewer it is actually an appropriate reaction nothing ever goes as planned its so ridiculous that you can only laugh jaime and tyrion was somewhat boring but their conversation was a lyric introduction to the fight compared to the trial this clearly lacked a greater emphasis but i prefer rushed to dragged out i guess they really tried a different approach that didnt work with many people to me it was fine not perfect i agree since i was not totally impressed but not knowing what was coming would have helped to increase the shocking effect overall a solid 8 worthy of being amongst the second best episodes but not there along with the typical wow episodes as episode 9 should be"

"mediterraneo",2014-06-04,"i liked this i was critical with some of the others because of the dumbed down dialogues but the late episodes where people lie on things happened during this season suffer less from this problem the duel was gruesome as it should violence is better represented here than in some other added scene like sandors numerous killings or what bienne and jaime did back in season two and three violence has consequences i was fearing and i read unsullied sites and it seems it is not that the way in which the viper dies could have been too much for the viewers in a jumping the shark way my fear was the reaction im tired of the gimmick of letting me affectionate to something just to kill it more and more gruseomly it seems people writing blogs over this are not expressing that feeling we will see next weeks ratings for the common peoples reaction i liked the long time on the settings too fewer longer scenes by geography without juxtapositions separated histories in the same container it worked today"
"Bridgeburners",2014-06-04,"i was all in all very frustrated with this episode a lot of it just reminded me of how downhill the writing in this show has gone â first there was ygritte shushing gilly with her finger even the show vikings which isnt supposed to be as well written as got had the subtlety of just letting ragnar conceal the little english kids so his raiders wouldnt see him and then walk away they show didnt have to bash us over the head with the fact that he was sparing him out of compassion and ygritte simply looking at her then closing the curtain and walking away would have been both subtle and powerful with us taking in the obvious realization that shes sparing her but nay say the got writers the audience with under 20 iq wouldnt understand what happened and we certainly cant leave any audience member behind so like in a saturday morning cartoon they add that shushing detail just to clue us all in â danaerys banishing jorah was way too rushed and haphazard the writers realized that they didnt do any setup for it at all and thought oh shit were near the end of the season we have to do it quick so boom boom and two quick scenes and five minutes later hes banished it was one of the most emotionally charged scenes in the book and in the show it felt like she was just dealing with another shepherd with burned sheepâ â the symbolism of the beetle scene just barely relates at all to the forthcoming scene or anything in the near future with tyrion really i mean the best thing i can really connect it to is gregor clegane who takes lives without much consideration was oberyns spear supposed to be the donkeys leg that kicked the cousin to death either way for such loose symbolism that scene didnt at all deserve the time it got especially since the fight scene seemed pretty rushed and could have had its own setup â finally what was with oberyn dancing around like a fairyprincess in a manner that doesnt at all apply to a real fight im okay with his initial display to impress the fans but after that twirling your spear around is not how you utilize its range to keep your opponent at bay not that he really cared about doing that while the book went through such painstaking detail about how he constantly tried to keep gregor out of swinging distance with his spear and even mentioned that one time he put himself in serious danger when he did slip into distance showoberyn must have gone into gregors swinging distance at least 10 times because he cared more about making a fancy impressive display than actually keeping himself alive and what with his being able to do triple figureskating spin jumps which are completely unrealistic in the scope of a fight all immersion is lost because we dont get to understand the intricate points of his danger for example in a normal fight if someone was knocked to the ground and the oppressor had the height advantage wed understand that the other guy is in a bad position but what about oberyn is this a dangerous position that hell have to work hard to get out of or will he be able to just do one of his triple spin jumps out of it whoops there he goes â anyway those are my major grievances they handled oberyns death well and it was one of my favourite scenes in the book series however as a whole this episode was pretty bad edited by bridgeburners 04 june 2014  0908 am"

"Bridgeburners",2014-06-06,"though im a reader i base my criticism of the show i gave this ep a 3 btw based on my comparison of it to other shows if you compare it to like the wire or sopranos the writing is just extremely juvenile lack any form of subtlety whatsoever and is an obvious attempt to keep everybody in the audience up with whats happening while insulting the intelligence of most of them and its not like i have an amazing memory and can remember characters twothree seasons later im very susceptible to forgetting these kinds of details but thats what recaps are for you cant cater to forgetful people like me at the expense of the flow of the story â even with my latest big grievance with the show i compare it to the show vikings which is actually not all that well written but at least is self aware i compare ygritte sparing gilly to ragnar lothbrok sparing a little english child during a raid ragnar sees him then covers him with a cloth and walks away leaving us the audience to understand the painfully obvious fact that he spared him out of compassion but doing so in a way that doesnt kill the actual impact of the scene ygritte when she shushed gilly ie put her finger on her mouth and said shhhh was the got writers needing to go the extra mile for us because were such fucking idiots that we couldnt have figured out what happened had they gone the more impactful and less cartoonish route of her just seeing gilly and covering the curtainsâ â then remember that scene with brienne and hot pie im totally fine with them feeling the need to condense her story though it was one of my favourites in ffc and having them use their own creative license to have her see hot pie thats cool and sure maybe for that not so humorous angle you can have her annoyed by his kidney pie speech but then they continue that frustration in the most absolutely absurd way when he comes back to talk to them and she opens with not about kidney pie again and tells them that he saw fucking arya then begins to tell her the story and she says the quick version please are you fucking kidding me the quick version you just got this miracle fucking lead of a guy who saw arya with his own eyes and youre so annoyed by his kidney pie story that you have to rush him no sit the fuck down and squeeze every little detail out of him that you can but the show has to be all sassy and relevant and relate to us by having brienne get annoyed with the fat kid who talks about kidney pie i remember in ffc how difficult it was for her to scrape any fragment of a minor detail from people and how she grilled people down to every last detail if she thought she got just a scent of the right directionâ â â this is not them being blasphemous by straying from the source material most of us critics are not that irrational this is just bad writing the thing thats most shameful to us readers is that a brilliant book series with amazing writing is being adapted into this high fantasy with teen drama level writing"

"Dolorous Gabe",2014-06-06,"â â the book was definitely better but i question whether a true adaptation would have worked first how ominous can you make the episode before you completely give it away that something bad is going to happen for example when i read the books i knew from the moment greywind tried to attack the frey that something very bad was going to happen also you put it really beautifully about the struggle of robbs men to protect their king but would that work for the show they never really made any of robbs fellow northmen prominent enough in the show for the audience to have any type of investment in them by the time the red wedding came and i dont know if i can blame them because theres only so much time you can spend on each character it was easier to make talisa the focus than a few commanders i would have liked it the other way but as ive said all day it was another change that didnt really bug me that muchâ â this â i agree with whats being said about shock value everything is amped up in the show for effect i dont think what dd have done is bad though i may never have gravitated to the books if it werent for their screen adaptation so i have to be hugely thankful to them for that i think if you can switch off your knowledge from the books the show is very entertaining and engrossing there was never any chance that the subtleties and scope of the books could translate completely effectively onto the screen because as mediums they are vastly different i think they have made a fair few mistakes but not enough to turn great source material into rubbish"

"MidnightKiss",2014-06-06,"i think its a replacement for the eunuch cuddle plotline as well but i also think its a way of having a little bit more screen time for some black actors â there arent many black actors in the show simply because most of the story is based in a large european continent ive seen video comments loving seeing salladhor saan briefly in this season because theyre glad to see a black face in a cast thats predominately lighter im personally happy that the book and show have a good mix of men and women in it so i can understand that some black people would like to see people of their color represented too â its hard to add in black people to the storyline because of where its set so a small subplot of missandei and grey worm seems a good opportunity to do this perhaps a scenea silent and poignant one of them hugging tightly would be good"

"SoManyVows",2014-05-26,"benioff and weiss have stated that the duel is one of the best sequences that they have ever done and i trust them completely i absolutely believe that they will do it justice and it will quickly become one of the most iconic moments in the history of the series for book readers and unsullied viewers alike â thats not to say that the scene will be 100 faithful to the books while oberyn will obviously taunt the mountain and demand that he say elias name i expect that they will be cutting down the number of times that he actually says you raped her you murdered her you killed her children i believe that he says it at least nine times in the book which is fine on the page but would be a little excessive on screen even before oberyn volunteered to be tyrions champion many many people were already making inigo montoya comparisons and jokes i expect that the producers are aware that if they go overboard with using that line the scene runs the risk of turning into a parody benioff and weiss arent going to compromise the integrity of the scene but fair or not everyone recognizes that the princess bride basically has a cultural monopoly on revenge duelsrepetitive monologues with hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die if i know the internet at all then within 24 hours there are already going to be 10000 youtube videos and gifs featuring oberyn and the mountain intercut with inigo and count rugen thats not a guess  thats an inevitability the writers could be willing to steer into that skid but i expect that theyll try to soften the comparison  at least somewhat â i can already anticipate the purist outrage if this happens but whatever as long as he says it two or three times im good â regardless i think that the scene will make all but the most rabid book fans quite happy ellaria saying you are going to fight that in the trailer basically confirms that well be getting at least a variation of oberyn responding with i am going to kill that which is a nice assurance there are a few other touches that i hope make it into the show one of which is the mountain maiming and killing some unfortunate spectator who gets too close however the way that the arena is set up in the show  with the spectators on a elevated platform above the combatants might preclude that id also like oberyn to yell eeeeeeeelllllliiiiiiiiaaaaa when he deals the mountain his mortal wound cersei to scream in anger when the mountain falls and for oberyn to shoot tywin and cersei some taunting looks in the aftermath while tyrion quips im feeling more innocent by the moment â but the only line that im truly crossing my fingers for is the one that oberyn delivers when he believes that he has the mountain at his mercy if you die before you say her name ser i will hunt you through all seven hells chills especially when we know what happens next â the part of the duel that i have the clearest mental image of however is the end which will double as the end of the episode ive pretty much mapped out my ideal version of that scene shot for shot far too many times â clegane brutally delivers the finishing blow to oberyn  whether by smashing his head in cutting him in half or some combination of the two immediately following that scene we get two reaction shots in quick succession ellaria screams in despair and horror and tyrion falls to his knees and vomits then interspersed with a few more shots of oberyns ruined body we get a few stunned reaction shots from the people watching  among them tywin cersei and jaime everyone is too stunned to speak with the exception of ellarias heartbroken cries the arena is completely and utterly silent â then tyrion starts to laugh  softly at first then louder and louder until hes basically cackling with hysteria those around him stare at him uneasily convinced that hes lost his mind  which he basically has his laughter mingles with ellarias sobs for several uncomfortable seconds before tywin motions for the guards to take tyrion away tyrion doesnt resist at all as hes halfmarched halfdragged out of the arena still laughing uncontrollably the camera lifts away from the scene into an aerial perspective revealing the full extent of the carnage in the arena oberyn and gregor clegane lying next to one another in a slowly expanding pool of their shared blood a tragedy and mockery of justice in one unforgettable image â ellarias cries and tyrions despairing laughter continue to play over this shot until the screen cuts to black the credits are accompanied by a suitably mournful song or better yet total silence edited by somanyvows 26 may 2014  1100 am"

"Lady Fevre Dream",2014-05-27," theres no way weâ wontâ get oberyns nickname considering that the episode is titled the viperâ and the mountain it would be ridiculous for them not to give him the name they were probably waiting until episode 8 to explain the nickname so it isnt a deadgiveaway what the episode title meant even though they showed parts of the dual in the trailers â while i do have a bit of faith we will get some type of viper mention im not so sure the episode title is a guaranteeâ iirc they never used aryas ghost of harrenhal inspite of the epi title whichhad me all kinds of hopefulâ still i think there is a bigger chance for viper or red viper especially since the casting call seems to specify the sand snakes next yearâ a viper breeds snakes hopefullythey will make that clearâ"

"Tyrion Hand of the King",2014-06-01,"he has to die i love him just as much as anybody else but he has to die i was really shocked by his death in the books and although i was upset about it for another hundred pages or so i thought to myself mostly damn that was good at no point did i wish he had survived because that part of the book to me was so meaningful i guess you could call it its something that gets a rise out of you and thats just great story tellingâ â couldnt agree more its like a roller coaster ride one minute you think oberyns got him beat and tyrion is free then everything goes wrong now tyrion is doomed then next thing you know hes freed and it leads to another incredibly shocking scene the kl storyline is gold at the end of asos no way theyre changing it"
"fangirl000",2014-06-01,"theyve been very strategic in only showing oberyn in motion in all the clips theyve provided so far the mountain has more or less been stationary and we havent even got a shot of him swinging his sword â clearly oberyn is going to be the one doing most of the movement during the duel as thats his fighting style but its going to be interesting to see how much they showcase the mountain an interview recently stated that one of the reasons they got thor to take on the mountain 30 role is because he had a basketball background which meant he moved very well for a man his size â the clips havent indicated this but for the most part the clips appear to be only from the very beginning of the duel with oberyn demonstrating his agility â we also dont know how much there will be in the way of verbal taunting that takes place during the duel i imagine theyll have oberyn keep his lines from the book although they may not be word for word will the mountain have any lines and will they be dubbed in the jail cell conversation bronn did give one hint of whats to come  he told tyrion that the mountain is unusually quick for a man of his size"
"The Ghost of Rhaegar",2014-06-01,"truth is the whole oberyn wins oh shit no gregory just crushed his f skull was one of the best gotcha moments for me reading the books and it should and will have the same effect for the hbo show â people will believe oberyn has done it and saved tyrion then all of that will be flipped â its gotta stay that way thats what makes this story so good â â i imagine the chatter after this episode will go nuts â i expect the escape scene will be left for episode 10 though edited by the ghost of rhaegar 01 june 2014  0315 pm"

"Emperoreddy",2014-06-01,"brutality i think works a number of ways is faithful to the books but just brings in the utter horror and shock that is implied by what happened for every unsullied watcher shock being that not only did an awesome character die but tyrion looks doomed too"

"Dirk blitzen",2014-06-01,"loved the fight scene there werent too many cuts for me but the editing itself was choppy a sign of poor direction really but still good enough to carry the story and get the point across im glad they didnt stretch out the fight oberyns yelling would have gotten so annoying i love that he targeted tywin while yelling though was that in the book"

"Boggsy Cyvasse",2014-06-01,"the fight was really well done but i did think or at least hoped theyd devote a lot more time to it they dragged feet with a few things though i did think the whole beetle speech was entirely characteristic of someone about to die arbitrary conversation taken to rambling to keep the mind off of what is essentially your impending doom talking about something completely off topic but somehow having it connect to the situation â the only thing i disliked was hearing oberyn cry out totally justified in that situation of course but in the books he died blindsided getting punched silently he was probably too stunned potentially braindead by the first punch to even completely feel the pain of what was happening this way it was like gregor got his satisfaction as much as oberyn making him scream being on top for the end i know its nitpicking but damn it fucked me up i also dont like how many times oberyn got knocked down in that short amount of time it threw the build up out of whack oberyn had some close calls in the fight yeah but for the most part it was all like yeah hes got this hes gonna win oh my god hes got it yes fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu it kind of foreshadowed his doom a little bit in a way where as the book completely shocked it is probably different from the view of an unsullied â otherwise i loved it it devestated me even worse than the books did really with arya i felt that the wushu she was doing was a little out of place with her suddenly being zhang ziyi from crouching tiger but with oberyn it was just fuckin awesome that choreography was almost yen woo ping levels of awesome donnie yen levels of awesome but a lot more realistic looking"
"Ran",2014-06-01,"when does too many cuts  static camera â this thing looks like it was cut twice as fast as for example the achilles vs hector final fight in troy not my favorite fight scene in the world but given that spears are used at the start it gives a sense of the sort of ideal cutting when weapons can traverse a long distance â and its definitely much much faster than the greatest sword fight ever put to film aka the finale of rob roy which also happens to be a pretty pitch perfect model for how the scene plays out in the books that ones chock full of tension without needing to cut the action into nearincomprehensibility â and then the decision to go with all the wushu flourishes like somersaults  stuff that its quite obvious pascal wasnt doing and from the video they released im pretty sure we see his stunt double working on the scene with thor  meant these crazy crane shots all the time it was a lot of baffling directorial editing and choreography decisions edited by ran 01 june 2014  1028 pm"

"Dirk blitzen",2014-06-01,"rewatching the scene i think the real problem is all the reaction shots thats whats really disrupting the flow of the whole thing gotta have them but it sacrificed the fluidity of the fight itd have been nice to do a lot of it in say one shot where the camera circles around and then at key moments like when oberyn stabs gregor the camera could whip pan to tyrion and flow back to oberyn shouting his stuff but this is still tv and there are limits to production though unrelated the opening tracking shot at moles town that lasted like 2 min was done very well edited by dirk blitzen 01 june 2014  1036 pm"
"Lord Varys",2014-06-01,"id have to second the cutting issue you or perhaps only i can see the cuts and they are annoying at times it really felt as if they had cut large portions out of the fight so this was really bad cuttingâ â but now i must really go to sleep"
"PhoenixFlame",2014-06-01,"some things i went nuts over â oberyns no no no got across a ton of his character he wasnt toying with him in the this is teh funsies sense but doing what he could what he dreamed of to not devolve into complete sputtering rage he wasnt thoughtlesshe was glancing down at the mountain as he railed at tywin but he made one wrong move drifting a bit too close to gregors arm and as bronn prophecizedthat was the endâ â his screams shit man i dont care how much of a badass you are youre screeching like a nutcase if your eyes are getting gouged out death is a levellerâ â ellarias scream hit me so much harder than the book version i keened when she looked so proudearlier she was nervous but then she was like you go babe get your vengeance then her horrorfuckâ â oberyn letting himself get pushed around just a bit to give him an advantage it reminded me of that study about people who are a bit sauced having a better chance of surviving a car wreck he really was like a snakeâ"
"Ran",2014-06-01,"theres definitely a lot of reaction shots they could have compressed some of these by simply showing two or three characters in one shot  ie ellaria and tyrion together jaime cersei tywin together  instead of doing individual reactions for each actor but for whatever reason they preferred the individual shots"

"Fredwin",2014-06-01,"yeah the cuts were excessive way too fast paced and cinematic the reaction shots werent the issue as much as not knowing when to use them they transformed what was supposed to be aâ duelâ into like a sporting event or gladitorial competition was hoping to see one of the coolest duels ever put to print played out in epic fashion â what i got was serviceable but there was no heart behind it this wasnt a personal twoman war between the fricken mountain and the viper it seemed more like some sort of brutal circus act or round of a mortal kombat i loved the duel between the hound and beric so much more and if you think about it they had much less to work with â petty gripes they should have bulked up the mountains armor he looks huge but not really the mountain that rides huge at one point they showed oberyn hamstring the mountain but they really should have been showing how he was strategically targeting the mountains joints all those vulnerabilities in his armor where oberyns spear could actually be useful i think if they only extended the fight by another 23 minutes drew it out longer and shown how oberyn had an actual operational plan to take this monster down it would have worked better on the screen"

"D-A-C",2014-06-02,"well all i can say is i am very very glad that i was able to read this fight before watching it that was incredibly disappointing compared to the fight we get in the books â i actually now feel really bad for the majority of my friends who havent read the books and rely solely on the tv show for advancing the story â well where to begin i suppose lets discuss the positives â 1 oberyns darth maul acrobatics  almost perfect there will be a slight complaint about it in the negatives though lol he nailed his fighting style pedro has been an absolute revelation this season making is early departure even more heart wrenching â 2 eye gouge  death scream  lovers scream  all were absolutely soul destroying and brutal as it they should be â â now onto the many negatives â 1 lack of build up  as always with this show we spend 80 of the episode in other places doing some very boring exposition and general crap much of which is starting to deviate badly from the books â 2 no emphasis on poison  i will rewatch it but my initial impression is that it is going to be hard for people to understand oberyn had a fight strategy of wearing his opponent down nicking the weak points of his armour arguably my own book interpretation using poison to increase the likely hood of gaining a confession in public implicating tywin for all to see i mean we actually had someone cleaning his spear and i immediately thought hey youll wipe the poison off idiot â 3 over too quickly  too much cutting  there needed to be more time for the mountain to become exhausted to fall because of his many wounds for the words the importance the meaning of this fight to be made fully clear to audience members unfamiliar with the books â also i will agree that there was too much cutting and for example moments when oberyn caught claganes knee needed close ups to emphasise this is the plan people death by 1000 cuts until he gets the confession and also wears him down â 4 crushing oberyns head  in a word awful and for me actually detracted from the horror of seeing oberyn die in such a way the punch was spot on the eye gouging awful but powerful but he then should have either smashed his head in by repeatedly slamming it on the ground or with crushing blows from a mailed fist not squeezing it like that which is actually just silly now that i think about it â 5 tyrion didnt vomit  enough said it needed to happen to both reinforce the disgusting spectacle but also as the im fucked moment that he experiences â 6 audience not getting caught up in thingsâ  with all the reaction shots being fired around you would think this would have been a given it added such a chaotic element to the fight why not have it â 7 lannister reactions  this one could be completely on me and because of how i read all the stuff around this fight both in the build up and crucially in the aftermath but cersie and tywin both reacted too happily too nonchalant about the fact a prince of dorne just got obliterated in front of them and that the mountain sort of confessed publicly like i said this criticism is probably a very personal nitpicking one but there was just somthing about the cut to the stands at the end and i just felt is that it thats you reaction a smug sense of satisfaction just didnt seem justified but again that could entirely be me and my interpretation â 8 no passion  just to remphasise using star wars an example it has often been said the lightsaber fights in new hope  empire strikes are much better than the dazziling display in episode 1 2 3 because they had such emotional charge behind them this is another example i think were there needed to be more emotion more passion more build up to really raise the stakes now dont get me wrong i loved oberyns fighting style but if there had been some added passion some more emphasis on the emotion of this fight for everyone involved it would have been better â â â there are probably a few other negatives and maybe one positive somewhere when i give the scene a closer look this post is just my initial i have just watched it and want to comment post lol â overall i am as i said in the position of someone who is incredibly disappointed â for me the tv show now is nothing more than a tolerable accompanying piece but the books will be the real game of thrones for me everything is more rich more detailed and better layed out â grrm doesnt keep things going because the tv crowd just love arya and the hound wasted trips to crastors keep because the audience needs action or will fall asleep doesnt have to follow this ridiculous wait till episode 9 for big battles policy or play about with constant meeting chances between starks and he can take as many pages as he likes to set thinks up and then follow them through to their completion â for such a pivotal moment i think this one has to go down as a complete fck up by the tv producers directors etc â however well done pedro pascal you were phenomenal its just a shame the converting of the source material didnt give you as much to work with as it should have but fuck me did you nail it anyway pedro is now officially who i will be picturing oberyn as during my rereads of the series â overall though i am completely disappointed by tonights weak effort not just with the fight itself but with the decisions made about what stories to include and advance all with it it was poorly paced poorly done  do you guys get that i didnt like it by now "

"gvewolf243",2014-06-02,"it was good but i still was kinda dissapointed in fight it seemed to come off less intense than i had hoped plus lack of some details like no emphasis on poison tyrion didnt vomit and etc still pedro was great as oberyn and ive gonna miss him edited by gvewolf243 02 june 2014  0248 am"

"Ran",2014-06-02,"yeah the kissed by fire fight is definitely the best one the show has done in my mind and thats directed by graves too but it tailored the fight to the actors the setup the environment plus you know practical effects so its worth noting that that episode has almost exactly the same average shot length as this fight but what beric and the hound had going for it was a more cramped environment closer in fighting and a choreography that allowed a lot of medium shots to establish and emphasize movement doubtless in part because the fire effect on the sword just had to be given its dueit was highly effective in that context edited by ran 02 june 2014  0823 am"

"Gregor's Nancy Boy",2014-06-02,"i dont know why oberyn told tyrion that the mountain cut elia in half that wasnt in the books and its just stupid to be honest i really doubt he brought his greatsword with him when he scaled maegors tower just to kill a defenseless woman and her children even if he did i wonder how that wentâ â here stand up princess i just raped you and now i have to kill you by chopping you in half step outside of the bedroom over there in that open space so i can get a clear swing â no he was lying on top of her when he murdered her and when he was finished raping her he just picked up his heavy mailed glove and dropped it down on her face because it was that easy for him gregor clegane doesnt need a sword to completely obliterate someone and the irony is that gregor kills oberyn the exact same way he emasculates him by entering a missionary position and getting right in his face close enough to kiss then he delivers those disturbing last lines â its a revelation the ultimate final taunt no one knew quite how gruesome elias death was but the mountain bellows it loud enough for everyone to hear then he demonstrates the same savagery on oberyn as testament if they cut oberyn in half i will be upset but the fact lena headey has her thumbs over pedro pascals eyes in that photoshoot at least shows that the actors are somewhat aware of how he dies in the books which tells me thats probably how he will die in the series those photos were most likely taken after season four was already filmed it wont be exactly like his death in the books and thats alright i had a hard time imagining gregor beating oberyns face in with one hand while the other hands fingers were gouging out his eyes anyway â these are the things i wantâ gregors last words to oberyn  especially like this oberyn dying the same way elia died the use ofâ someâ sort of special effects on oberyns headface it has to be absolutely bratal well god damn they just knocked it out of the fucking ball park didnt they that was absolutely horrendous in the best way possible oberyns screams chilled me to the bone you think just because hes so suave and brave that he wouldnt cry like a bitch the way he did and that combined with ellarias little freak out at the end easily made it the most disturbing scene in got so far well done hbo well fucking done i think im going to need therapy now edited by gregors nancy boy 02 june 2014  0604 pm"

"bannor136",2014-06-02,"i think it was ok what he did hes gregor clegane hes a complete sociopathic crazy monster with a never ending raging temper the fact that oberyn who the mountain probably found extremely annoying just stabbed him up with a spear would have really really pissed him off not only would he be in a blinding amount of pain no pun intended hed also be severely embarassed that this girly dornishman just beat him you remember how pissed off he got when loras tyrell unhorsed him at the hands tourney in bookseries 1 the mountain was severely weakening but with that amount of rage and adrenaline im sure in that moment it became his dying wish to carve oberyns head in the way he did his sisters and it would not have required too much energy for someone as big and strong as the mountain he put his last bit of strength into doing that before he collapses on the ground and stops moving ok fair point thinking about it more it seems to make a little more sense considering that the mountain isnt really what most would consider human im just trying to ease the pain of oberyns passing in such a terrible wayâ"

"James Arryn",2014-06-02,"i thought it really delivered a few things id want different but then it wasnt directed for me there are imo 5 levels of criticism pedantic adherence to books for example the countless criticisms of the nonpuking like what no one who had not read the books would in any way shape or form miss the absence of puke its a non difference desire to be faithful to the emotional impact of the scene this is where it let me down just a bit i agree it needed a bit more length and buildup and in my minds eye oberyns death isnt about being cocky so much as the fact that at that point hes basically communing with the deadexcoriating a lifetime of pain and anger he builds up to it during the fight and as he wins hes peaking so hes almost high the elia scream in my mind signifies this but im not sure how well that would communicate to tv but this came off a bit more grounded and his focus on tywin gave it a realistic alternative desire to be faithful to the aestheticsrationale of the scene in this area it both worked better and worse than i expected worse in the somewhat less emphasis on bleedingtiring the mountain out in my mind the book fight is a bit like a bull fight a conscious very considered approach to overcome physical power and resilience so it lacked that a bit but where for me it worked better than expected was the whirling and other stuff others seemed to hate to me that was very snake like ive had a couple snakes come at me in the wild and the visual effect is slight confusion because of how much seemingly extraneous movement is involved and the way that will suddenly switch to straight ahead snap which was how oberyns ultimate strike seemed to me the sudden death strike so good and bad i agree that the mountain didnt seem as ominous as he needs to be i am less bothered than some by his sudden recovery without the need to replicate the exact reaching from the depths sense the books give that sequence imo this could easily be him conserving his dwindling resources given the fact that he has a spear in him not exactly playing possum but going with plan b once plan a had failed desire to be faithful to characters i thought this was well done pascals smile throughout was just the right touch for mecelebrating the moment of finally being here finally doing this and seeing it play out as he had imagined it also contempt for the citylandculture he was forced to step into to get the job done another touch that worked for me was jamies evident approval more than anyone in the books jamies life revolved around fighting judging others according to their fighting skill using fighting metaphors selmy comes closest but he has other issues which occupy his mind so jaime the fighter watching the red vipers courage control skill and intelligence fightingwell he would be half smiling and theres the sense that my brother might win this which i dont think he expected to feel of the cut away shots it was imo the most effective lastly theres the kind of discussions i remember from film school which are great in their waybut the technical informs the auteur i was taught to believe so the first question you ask is what is the audience feeling is it what the director wanted seeing is a door to feeling not its own room if you convey that feeling with a lean sunrise awesome its easier for us to understand the road the director took us down to get there but whether its the strength of the books characters or the charisma of the actor or we while watching i felt a sense of dread and extreme empathy and an unrealistic part of me hoped somehow it wouldnt end as i knew it would end while simultaneously hoping this would just go on and on so for me job done director edited by james arryn 02 june 2014  1111 pm"

"James Arryn",2014-06-03,"to comment on the comparison with rob roy agreed its the best of all time fans of hobbs work would enjoy an earlier examination of a similar realism in the duelists however a lot of the space the rob roy fight gets to breathe it earned in the movie leading up to it so in addition to the realism and sense of exhaustion and sweat and tangible fear those spaces are also filled with inner thoughts we as the audience are riding along with the characters we know how each think we know each are deadly in their own way we know each if them know it of the other and we quickly understand the evolution of each fighters strategy when roy adopts the shoulderroof defensive stance we see his desperation and that is also quickly followed by cunninghams exploitation of the innerouter angle he has always been confident now he knows he will win thats all powerfully conveyed but i doubt it has the same impact if it were secondary characters nor do i feel most directors would trust it to do so in that case additionally the mountain is semisuperhuman so it ought to require semiextreme exhaustion for the right payoff and i doubt the average nonreader would retain enough interest maybe more trust pays off with a better scene but i think this hit a nice middlepoint between testing that and shortcutting too much personally if it were made for me id have the fight and periphery take up 23 of the episode but i dont think most viewers would enjoy it as much dont want to get into studies on tv audience attention spans as differing from film fans but it might be a consideration i do agree that the shortened episode seems a bit of a waste edited by james arryn 03 june 2014  1224 am"

"Veltigar",2014-06-03,"whats with all the talk of rob roy aside from having an underwhelming and predictable ending the pacing for that fight just wouldnt be right for a fight involving the mountain in my opinion the duel at the end of rob roy is one of the greatest if not greatest fights over put on film why first of all because it was properly buildup throughout the whole movie the fight styles prowess and weaknesses of both combatants were established before they actually engaged in combat in other words they made you care for both the fighters and the actual duel â secondly the flow of the fight was realistic very intense in the beginning before the weight of the swords and the exercise tired them out and throughout the duel there were longer and longer pauzes and they got slower because both participants got more exhaustedâ â on top of that the moves of the duelists were realistic they actually tried to hit each other a glaring problem in many hollywood films and when tim roth landed one of his cuts neeson bled and that affected the fight after that since neeson acted like a wounded man fighting not like this mountain shit who can still move so nimble after hes been speared through the gut â and finally the duel in rob roy showed how important it is to use your brains when roth and neeson clashed swords roth had the upper hand because he was smarter he was like a chessplayer found the opening and landed his cut this is how oberyn should have fought with precision and small adjustments and sidesteps to keep the mountain at bay all those ridiculous twists and spins were plain dumb because oberyn just tired himself out without actually achieving something â oh and one minor issue in rob roy the participants used weapons and gear that suited them and the situation they didnt wear helmets and armour because it was a duel and each used the weapon that they could fight the best with in got on the other hand the mountain has this nonsensical helmet which doesnt do anything but fall off instead of you know just having him wear no helmet at all and he fights without a shield wtf wa up with that he just looked plain silly either let him use both hands to wield that sword or give him a shield not that akwkard combo of no shield and one hand on his sword"

"Tyrion Hand of the King",2014-06-03,"â oberyn knew exactly what he was getting into his confidence doesnt change that thats why he poisoned the spear in case he didnt win the fight and its obviously a good back up â i agree plus how likely was it that he would end up being brutally killed by gregors fists as opposed to his greatsword the way oberyn went was certainly a worst case scenario in terms of pain the fact that he thickened the poison proves that he had the backup plan thickening poison would have no purpose if gregor died in the duel in no way am i saying he expected to die but if he was 100 confident he would get out of the fight alive then why even bother with itâ"
"sj4iy",2014-06-03,"just saw the inside the episodedidnt mention anything about the poisoncould you send the link you saw this in i figured it would be a bit of a spoilerâ my unsullied friends who were thinking oberyn would use poison since his name is viper after all none are thinking about poison nowtoooooo shocked by his deathhe did say it very clearly"
"Tyrion Hand of the King",2014-06-03,"my sense is that surviving was or at least became a secondary motive to him this was an exorcism and seance as much as a fight for him hes never going to get the chance to lay the blame where he feels it rests again this is a one time opportunity the mountain dying would only satisfy a small part of what he wants out of this if it was just winning or killing poison could get that done with a lot less risk he wants a lot more than a win and barring the mountains superhumanity he likely gets it at that point without too much risk spear through the cardiovascular system is usually a pretty powerful sedative i 100 agree with everything you said here i dont get when people attribute oberyns defeat to stupidity if he simply wanted to win the duel he couldve done so he wanted more than thatâ"

"iknownothingjonsnow",2014-06-03,"im not sure whether it was the acting or choreography but the mountain looked more like a clumsy oaf than a seasoned fighter â i particularly liked when he disarmed his opponent and knocked him down then tried to finish him off by scraping his sword across the ground like a moron â perhaps he saw a few of those pesky beetles â i was initially turned off by pascals overly jovial attitude toward the encounter but when he screamed you raped her i got chills â damn that guy was awesome â as usual the whole sequence felt a little bit rushed â its one thing for dd to make sure nothing interesting happens until the very end of an episode but i dont understand why they dont at least try to extend the lone interesting scene â curious"

"Aether",2014-06-03,"im pretty surprised at how much hate this fight scene is getting â i thought it was basically perfect â the only somewhat important difference is that he crushes his skull instead of smashing it with a gauntlet but a 420 pound man wearing several hundred pounds of armour putting all of his weight and strength on your face with your head pressed against cement â its not at all unbelievable that he could obliterate his skull like that â people complaining that he shouldnt have been able to move after being stabbed just dont have a very firm grasp of how resilient the human body can be â there are people who get shot in the brain and survive people who get stabbed dozens of times and carry their own intestines to the emergency room and survive â go watch a show called i survived â its just one story after another of people suffering grizzly injuries and managing somehow to survive â its not like when you get stabbed your whole body just shuts down instantly â he would be in great pain and his strength would drain as he lost blood from the wound but its again really not out of the question that he could still have the strength to pull down a man who weighs about 300 pounds less than him and smash his face in â im surprised tbh â if this scene wasnt accurate enough for you my suspicion is that no adaptation of the story will ever be good enough or close enough to the books for you"

"pleonasm",2014-06-03,"a couple of others thoughts regarding the duel â 1 the absence  multiple recasts of the mountain didnt do the duel scene any favors nor did the relative lack of screen time of both fighters in the actual episode a few quick of scenes of both fighters prepping for the battle would have done wonders for the actual dual itself especially given the nonentity that the mountain has been in the series since season 1 we all have conveniently forgotten his completely unmemorable appearances in season 2 instead we get 5 minutes of cousin orson ugghh â 2 the duel itself felt very rushed this was a big moment in the show building for multiple episodes indulge amp the tension let us see them exhaust themselves let us hear some commentary from the crowd instead of the mostly stoic glances from tywin and cersei â 3 for me the most horrific part of the book scene isnt the mountain head crushing oberyn its once the mountain gains the upper hand he yells out his confession i killed the welps i raped her i killed her that is truly gut wrenching i wanted that edited by pleonasm 03 june 2014  0925 pm"

"Wussel",2014-06-04,"thats already been established in the prior 2 hours of the film however â the dialog is all the reason more for why it should have been stretched out rather than rushed im not saying it needs the leisurely pacing and cutting of the rob roy fight which does indeed increase its tension by short bursts of violence but bursts that you can clearly understand with tense stares and maneuvering around but its less than half the length and has three times as many cuts per second  thats insanity something more like the hectorachilles fight  itself about a minute longer with a number of crowd reaction shots but with half as many total cuts despite this  would have been much more appropriate to some degree i think its all down to two major choreography errors wushu acrobatics necessitating stunt doubling besides its particular pacing the real beauty of the rob roy scene is that almost all  perhaps all  the scenes are the actors themselves this is all the more remarkable because archibald cunningham looks like a murder monkey and thats all tim roth who had no stage fighting experience at all thats a testament to the vision of william hobbs who tailored the scene to get the maximum effect out of the actors and to director michael catonjones in judging that the more they can sell roth as a dangerous swordsman when compared to the tall strapping liam neeson the better theres too many crane shots to hide the fact that were looking at the double but you can tell really  hes leaner than pascal is  and that breaks the reality of the vision of the person youre watching actually being that dangerous the other issue is that the onehanded sword swings from gregor sap a lot of the tension out of his attacks theyre not credibly dangerous and its worth considering that almost every dangerous blow he does in the fight is just his using his strength to throw or kick oberyn around the weapons almost a nonfactor because the insistence on sticking to onehanded swings was just wrong and the thing is they even acknowledge that the weapon  a lighterthanreality prop weapon  is too large to be effectively swung around by the worlds third strongest man in the postepisode behindthescenes video so why do it it doesnt even make particular sense since im certain that if gregor clegane had to fight without a shield hed use that sword with both hands a couple of times to emphasize how strong he is fine but its almost all the time and every time he does it theres no real feeling of threat to oberyn tailor the scene to the actors and the cutting wouldnt have to be so insanely fast some of that cutting i assure you was just to speed up the action by cutting out some of the ponderousness of bjarnssons blows thats not his fault thats the fault of the choreographer the director and the producers better choreography would have led to less cutting which would have given the movement and space of the fight more impact and would have allowed pascal and bjarnsson to be more present as it is so much was blinkandyoull miss it eta heres my preliminary calculation of the fights cutting using techniques discussed on cinemetrics a site for study of film through the lens of cutting technique and cinematography total fight length 107 seconds total cuts 124 average shot length 086587 seconds median shot length 0765 seconds shortest cut 0250 seconds by way of comparison heres rob roys final duel total fight length 276 seconds total cuts 101 cuts asl 2732 and the final fight between hector and achilles in troy total fight length 166 seconds total cuts 117 asl 141 and from the video i link below heres a 60 second fight from the bourne identity total fight length 60 seconds total cuts 62 cuts asl 95 seconds shortest cut 40 seconds and the first fight from hero where theres a lot of stunt and wire work admittedly but its actually jet li and donnie yen doing them because thats just how they roll total fight length 60 seconds total cuts 22 asl 26 seconds shortest cut 80 seconds its the fastest fight cutting i can find via cinemetrics and its apparently faster than the very rapid cutting of one of the bourne identity oneonone fight scenes according to this im guessing  but havent yet gone through with an eye towards this  that the fight also has a very heavy reliance on close ups which deemphasizes the particular mechanics of the fight with longerthannormal weapons i know this is among the nerdiest things ive ever done in discussing the show but honestly it feels like some actual empirical data is needed to fully explain why the cutting is bugging me so much its symptomatic of poor choices the production made â â while i totally agree with the main points about this fight i would like to point out that the review is read for other reasons the fight was anticlimactic to say at least however that happens a lot to hyped things the beatle talk was a pain tyrion bitching about drinking was even more out

"Veltigar",2014-06-04,"thats already been established in the prior 2 hours of the film however â the dialog is all the reason more for why it should have been stretched out rather than rushed im not saying it needs the leisurely pacing and cutting of the rob roy fight which does indeed increase its tension by short bursts of violence but bursts that you can clearly understand with tense stares and maneuvering around but its less than half the length and has three times as many cuts per second  thats insanity something more like the hectorachilles fight  itself about a minute longer with a number of crowd reaction shots but with half as many total cuts despite this  would have been much more appropriate to some degree i think its all down to two major choreography errors wushu acrobatics necessitating stunt doubling besides its particular pacing the real beauty of the rob roy scene is that almost all  perhaps all  the scenes are the actors themselves this is all the more remarkable because archibald cunningham looks like a murder monkey and thats all tim roth who had no stage fighting experience at all thats a testament to the vision of william hobbs who tailored the scene to get the maximum effect out of the actors and to director michael catonjones in judging that the more they can sell roth as a dangerous swordsman when compared to the tall strapping liam neeson the better theres too many crane shots to hide the fact that were looking at the double but you can tell really  hes leaner than pascal is  and that breaks the reality of the vision of the person youre watching actually being that dangerous the other issue is that the onehanded sword swings from gregor sap a lot of the tension out of his attacks theyre not credibly dangerous and its worth considering that almost every dangerous blow he does in the fight is just his using his strength to throw or kick oberyn around the weapons almost a nonfactor because the insistence on sticking to onehanded swings was just wrong and the thing is they even acknowledge that the weapon  a lighterthanreality prop weapon  is too large to be effectively swung around by the worlds third strongest man in the postepisode behindthescenes video so why do it it doesnt even make particular sense since im certain that if gregor clegane had to fight without a shield hed use that sword with both hands a couple of times to emphasize how strong he is fine but its almost all the time and every time he does it theres no real feeling of threat to oberyn tailor the scene to the actors and the cutting wouldnt have to be so insanely fast some of that cutting i assure you was just to speed up the action by cutting out some of the ponderousness of bjarnssons blows thats not his fault thats the fault of the choreographer the director and the producers better choreography would have led to less cutting which would have given the movement and space of the fight more impact and would have allowed pascal and bjarnsson to be more present as it is so much was blinkandyoull miss it eta heres my preliminary calculation of the fights cutting using techniques discussed on cinemetrics a site for study of film through the lens of cutting technique and cinematography total fight length 107 seconds total cuts 124 average shot length 086587 seconds median shot length 0765 seconds shortest cut 0250 seconds by way of comparison heres rob roys final duel total fight length 276 seconds total cuts 101 cuts asl 2732 and the final fight between hector and achilles in troy total fight length 166 seconds total cuts 117 asl 141 and from the video i link below heres a 60 second fight from the bourne identity total fight length 60 seconds total cuts 62 cuts asl 95 seconds shortest cut 40 seconds and the first fight from hero where theres a lot of stunt and wire work admittedly but its actually jet li and donnie yen doing them because thats just how they roll total fight length 60 seconds total cuts 22 asl 26 seconds shortest cut 80 seconds its the fastest fight cutting i can find via cinemetrics and its apparently faster than the very rapid cutting of one of the bourne identity oneonone fight scenes according to this im guessing  but havent yet gone through with an eye towards this  that the fight also has a very heavy reliance on close ups which deemphasizes the particular mechanics of the fight with longerthannormal weapons i know this is among the nerdiest things ive ever done in discussing the show but honestly it feels like some actual empirical data is needed to fully explain why the cutting is bugging me so much its symptomatic of poor choices the production made"

"zaphodbrx",2014-06-05,"a lot of people enjoyed the duel specially tvonly viewers agreed but i think the reason behind it is that the source material is just extremely good and that is what shows from an adaptation perspective i think it was disappointing ill try to explain why im going to nitpick hell yeah â the buildup â the whole episode has no kings landing stuff in it until the end and then when you finally think the duel is coming you get 10 minutes of orson lannister crushing beetles just who thought this was a good idea i dont care if it has some philosophical meaning all the audience can think about is just get on with it already just sticks out like a sore thumb the novels were already so good in this regard you have these awesome tyrionoberyn conversations which were all cut so that oberyn could get a dumb line today is not the day i die jojens line in a completely wrong context and there is so much sub text in oberyns conversations  especially if you accept the tywin poisoning theories your father may not live forever cersei would support myrcellas crowning etc the whole background is just cut bad bad bad â the equipment â now i understand that you cant have actors wear helmets in film they have to show their faces ok fine as long as you dont draw attention to that fact in the freaking script now in real life fighting without helmet would be suicide  it is the most important part of the armor sometimes they would fight without a visor just to get a better view but they would not be bareheaded gregors greatsword striking your unprotected top or back of the head would split your skull with a helm you could get knocked back and maybe have a concussion but that is a much better deal in fact in the novels oberyn does wear a halfhelm â gregors case is even worse he has a completely un historical type of helmet which just falls off like what i once witnessed a dangerous motorcycle accident at 40 kmph the dude survived with his helmet still on because thats the freaking point a helm that just falls off when you need it the most is just self defeating and stupid â a final comment about the spear in most sparring situationsvideos youll see people using 6 poles because thats the most you can really fit into a car a more realistic size would be 8  the same as in the novels in the show the spear he uses is extremely short like 5 or so max so the entire point of having a longer reach is completely missed â fight choreography â what martin describes in the novels is actually pretty realistic fight choreography  you can see a video example here of what it should have been like now i didnt expect the show to be anywhere as accurate or realistic but what we did get was just really really bad â the thing with stage combat is you are trying to show a combat while being as safe as possible  which is exactly the opposite of what you would be trying to do in real combat ie to hurt your opponent the trick is to do it in as realistic a manner while still looking good this is difficult wu shu on the other hand is mainly for entertainment and acrobatic purposes so when you use that in a fight supposedly to be to the death it just ends up looking absurd â the phantom menace is perhaps the best example of this the linked video explains clearly why this fight is rubbish so when you have oberyn just spinning around and twirling and doing this dance steps its just hard to take him seriously if i were in a duel to the death i would probably learn a martial art that is focused towards you know killing people not this wu shu or star wars rubbish  that would instantly get you killed in real life  â gregor is even more of a disappointment  im sorry but this dude cant act he just looks a little fat and round in his armor and totally not menacing in the slightest also is he drunk or something he just swings it around awkwardly with one hand as if he has no idea what he is doing â the fight â now the fight is already problematic because gregor is drunk and oberyn is learning the ballet but it is also too short and includes none of the cool stuff actually there in the novels that could distract you from the stupid fight choreography like the part where gregor kills the unfortunate bystander and the sun comes out and gregor puts the sun at his back but oberyn uses his shield to shine it in his face tyrion saying i am feeling more innocent every moment you know the cool stuff thats there in the novels they cut it out for what orson lannister smashing beetles and burping whores and grey worm filler yeah â the issues with the editing and camera angles have already been covered at length in other posts i dont know much about this so all ill say is that i just found it really bad and awkward â the end â i dont know if is possible to crush a mans skull with bare hands certainly it looked very goofy to me when there was no need for it they could have had him punch the face with his armored gauntlets you know like the novelsâ â in conclusion i just found it a disappointing end to a disappointing epsiode â â"

"Jo cool",2014-06-06,"for starters opeth is a great band i would agree with you if it werent for the fact that ending ending episodes with character reaction shots has happened literally every season starting with episode 3 of season one onwards were privy to the vast majority of episodes ending with the camera on their face especially in recent times in reactions to surprises jaimes episode ends with his scream and his face red wedding ends with cats face the episode before this ended with tyrion and oberyns faces etc every now and then it works but its turned into a cheap way to end scenes two seconds after the twist happens  rather than giving us complete scenes â ok i see it more as a trademark although sometimes unoriginal andor unsuccessful i concur than a way to cop out anyway im sorry it bothered you and yeah  opeth "
"LordStoneheart",2014-06-06,"imo their best ending so far has been the march of the unsullied from astapor not exactly what this last episode should end like but its different than just reaction shots"

"R'hllor the Fabulous",2014-06-06,"a lot of people enjoyed the duel specially tvonly viewers agreed but i think the reason behind it is that the source material is just extremely good and that is what shows from an adaptation perspective i think it was disappointing ill try to explain why im going to nitpick hell yeah â the buildup â the whole episode has no kings landing stuff in it until the end and then when you finally think the duel is coming you get 10 minutes of orson lannister crushing beetles just who thought this was a good idea i dont care if it has some philosophical meaning all the audience can think about is just get on with it already just sticks out like a sore thumb the novels were already so good in this regard you have these awesome tyrionoberyn conversations which were all cut so that oberyn could get a dumb line today is not the day i die jojens line in a completely wrong context and there is so much sub text in oberyns conversations  especially if you accept the tywin poisoning theories your father may not live forever cersei would support myrcellas crowning etc the whole background is just cut bad bad bad â the equipment â now i understand that you cant have actors wear helmets in film they have to show their faces ok fine as long as you dont draw attention to that fact in the freaking script now in real life fighting without helmet would be suicide  it is the most important part of the armor sometimes they would fight without a visor just to get a better view but they would not be bareheaded gregors greatsword striking your unprotected top or back of the head would split your skull with a helm you could get knocked back and maybe have a concussion but that is a much better deal in fact in the novels oberyn does wear a halfhelm â gregors case is even worse he has a completely un historical type of helmet which just falls off like what i once witnessed a dangerous motorcycle accident at 40 kmph the dude survived with his helmet still on because thats the freaking point a helm that just falls off when you need it the most is just self defeating and stupid â a final comment about the spear in most sparring situationsvideos youll see people using 6 poles because thats the most you can really fit into a car a more realistic size would be 8  the same as in the novels in the show the spear he uses is extremely short like 5 or so max so the entire point of having a longer reach is completely missed â fight choreography â what martin describes in the novels is actually pretty realistic fight choreography  you can see a video example here of what it should have been like now i didnt expect the show to be anywhere as accurate or realistic but what we did get was just really really bad â the thing with stage combat is you are trying to show a combat while being as safe as possible  which is exactly the opposite of what you would be trying to do in real combat ie to hurt your opponent the trick is to do it in as realistic a manner while still looking good this is difficult wu shu on the other hand is mainly for entertainment and acrobatic purposes so when you use that in a fight supposedly to be to the death it just ends up looking absurd â the phantom menace is perhaps the best example of this the linked video explains clearly why this fight is rubbish so when you have oberyn just spinning around and twirling and doing this dance steps its just hard to take him seriously if i were in a duel to the death i would probably learn a martial art that is focused towards you know killing people not this wu shu or star wars rubbish  that would instantly get you killed in real life  â gregor is even more of a disappointment  im sorry but this dude cant act he just looks a little fat and round in his armor and totally not menacing in the slightest also is he drunk or something he just swings it around awkwardly with one hand as if he has no idea what he is doing â the fight â now the fight is already problematic because gregor is drunk and oberyn is learning the ballet but it is also too short and includes none of the cool stuff actually there in the novels that could distract you from the stupid fight choreography like the part where gregor kills the unfortunate bystander and the sun comes out and gregor puts the sun at his back but oberyn uses his shield to shine it in his face tyrion saying i am feeling more innocent every moment you know the cool stuff thats there in the novels they cut it out for what orson lannister smashing beetles and burping whores and grey worm filler yeah â the issues with the editing and camera angles have already been covered at length in other posts i dont know much about this so all ill say is that i just found it really bad and awkward â the end â i dont know if is possible to crush a mans skull with bare hands certainly it looked very goofy to me when there was no need for it they could have had him punch the face with his armored gauntlets you know like the novelsâ â in conclusion i just found it a disappointing end to a disappointing epsiode â â great post more or less my exact thoughts i was looking forward to this scene i loved pedro pascal as oberyn minus the brothel scenes but those arent his fault but they just had to give him legolas syndrome and then theres the mountain who seemed to have the opposite problem he didnt even know how to hold his damn sword i am not exaggerating when i say that gregors choreography was some of the worst ive ever seen such a shame this could have been a fight which could have ended up on

"jakelamotta",2014-07-17,"to be fair the shows portrayal of the kill is not the far off from the books in terms of realism i watch a lot of mma and rarely do you see a fighter landing significant punches let alone a knockout punch from the bottom when lying on your back there isnt enough space to throw a hard punch you just cant put your hips and whole body into it to generate power for the 500 pounds of force required to crush a skull even with steel gauntlets however this is the mountain we are talking about he basically has the strength of a comic superhero so if grrm says he can smash oberyns head while laying on his back it isnt too farfetched to think that he can crush it like he did in the showâ â grrm is not per definition describing it more realistically to me it seems to be easier albeit not easy to crush a skull like he does in the show and virtually impossible to do it as its described in the book unless you are a giant perhaps the strength is not in the arms as you say and lying on the back you cant put your body into a punch and it will be significantly weaker now the most realistic would probably be having a combo that is him being in the postion he has in the show while crushing his skull with a powerful blow or two like in the book i do not know how big the mountain is suppose to be though and is obv restricted by the size of the actor here though he is huge and this is not the part i have the most problem with but its the fact that the mountain gets a spear through his belly if his stomach is pierced he would die within minutes from sepsis it doenst matter how big he is i guess he can be lucky and the spear missed all major organs and arteries which still seems unlikely but as its described in the show he coughs up blood which means either it was the stomach or the lungs either way hes a dead man poison or no posion"

"Hath4",2014-06-02,"well ramsay was raised by his mother and reek both of them kept reminding him of his rights they are the ones who created him roose did not meet him until he was an adult thats why they have such different styles ramsay wants to be his father his main desire is to be a bolton thats why he killed his brother so no one could stand in his way roose is stuck with him and ramsay knows that both are psychopaths the main difference being that ramsay is also a sadist who is even turned on by his own twisted ness roose while cruel usually commits crimes when he fells its pragmatic to do so he is not one for random violence ramsay well his hunts tell you all you need to know on that front they are extreme and evil but they go about it in extremely different ways edited by hath4 02 june 2014  0310 pm"

"Ser Dank the Jedi",2014-06-02,"didnt record but ive had two weeks of my unsullied friends constantly asking me does oberyn kill the mountain â hes gotta kill the mountain right â he cant die cause then tyrion is screwed so oberyn wins right â on and on it went up until the episode finally started and we had silence in the realm that is my buddys living room â watching that scene and hearing them root for oberyn each time he dodged a slash and landed a hit on the mountain with that fancy spear the yes and nices they would utter couldnt help but bring a smirk to my face knowing the viper wasnt long for westeros â and when the mountain finally and gruesomely ended that duel i asked them all if that answered their question as to who wins â seriously you dont bet against the 711 guy clad in full plate that uses a two handed greatsword one handed â now a week of but whats going to happen to tyrion followed by replies of well put down facebook and pick up a real book â â not that im not used to that question by now â wanted to also say like most book readers ive been anticipating and dreading this scene since the title of this episode was released â there really is nothing you can do to prepare yourself to watch someone be killed in the most brutal way possible â ellaria sandindira varmas blood curdling scream says it all â â once you see it you cant unsee it edited by ser dank the jedi 02 june 2014  1029 am"
"Bridgeburners",2014-06-02,"for those saying that the audience probably wouldnt be as shocked with the scene as with the rw â i dont know but i must say that when i read asos 9 years ago i was far more thrown back in a holy shit moment with the mountain and viper fight than with the red wedding and its not that i was more invested or anything i wasnt all that invested in oberyn at all and gregor hardly had any scenes anyway its just that standalone the way that entire scene was written was absolutely brilliant and magnificent in just a couple of pages i went from not knowing oberyn that well to being completely invested in his cause even forgetting about tyrion for a bit well until tyrion reminds us of his presence when oberyn says confess your crime confess your crime and tyrion was whispering another chant fall down and die fall down and die lol â the thing is that could have just been a short story on its own and it still would have been brilliant in a quick stroke he takes us from wondering about the fight to being completely invested in oberyn and his cause and enjoying the results to being stupefied and horrified compare that with the red wedding where we simply go from reading a boring scene we dont care about all that much to being stupefied and horrified maybe with the baggage that came before the red wedding gets more impact but as a standalone scene the viper vs mountain fight was more powerful and more shocking by far imo"
"flrtwtrble",2014-06-02,"i got a text from a friend that he was having the worst night ever  first the blackhawks lost then â oberyns dead and wtf tyrion lost his trialâ â and that was just gruesome the way they killed oberyn i could barely watch itâ"

"majgat",2014-06-03,"loved him in the book but he was a pretty minor character there  only in a few scenes until the duel â theyve jacked up his presence on the show to make more people care about him and like him easy to do  hes pretty cool and pascal is doing well with the part â however i dont think it will make as big an impact as the red or purple weddings just because he hasnt been around long enough i dont think hes a minor character at all on the contrary his death sparked a lot of uproar in dorne so in this case hes very similar to ned stark in the north hes just never been pov character and appeared later in the books his contribution to other pov or minor character is quite big"

"Dragon Queen",2014-06-03,"my brother texted me bro wow got bro that was brutal me i know that was awful bro my friend heard a rumor that all of next episode is at the wall me the episode name is the watchers at the wall i think it may just have something to do with the wall lol bro i hope jon snow doesnt die now too â my unsullied husband was distraught and in shock for about 20 minutes afterword just sat there unable to move he seemed to believe that despite it all tyrion would make it through this trial unscathed position in court intact and things could go on with tyrion being in kings landing with the rest hes forced me to tell him his fate but hes not happy with tyrion joining someone elses cause he said i want tyrion to be the hero on his own not stand next to somebody else â its kind of fascinating how different fans lose their asoiaf innocence at different points for some people seeing ned die was enough for others they went from ned to robb and after the rw they knew no one was safe for others i think its taken until now to really let it sink in that no one is safe for me personally i wrote ned off and thought he was an idiot after throwing a hissy fit in court about robert wanting dany assassinated after every further bad decision i was more and more pissed at him until he died with robb there was a sense of foreboding as everything seemed to be going wrong for him too so at the time of the trial i didnt really get who oberyn was but i believed wholeheartedly that tyrion was safe and that he couldnt lose it was a major shock i didnt know how to deal with that oberyn lost the fight for tyrion i lost my asoiaf innocence at that point â thanks for the poster who posted that really funny rant from misc i tried to cheer my husband up so i showed him the rant after reading it my unsullied husband smiled again saved the post and seemed to recover"

"MooseHB",2014-06-03,"this is the best response ever to this episode taken from the misc forums quote â quote â im fuking fuming right now i hate this show so badly its brought no joy in my life all its brought is agony wat a bullshyt ending back in season 1 i backed my boy ned stark and that neckbeard decides to kill him off it stung but i got over it and i started backing his son robb he was younger hotter than his dad and had a direwolf on his side so i figured it was a tradeup then that pos grrm kills him and his whole family off in the most brutal way possible at a fuking wedding and then to add salt on a womb we see that sick shot of his body on his direwolfs head wat kind of fuked up human being thinks up stuff like that i was devastated after last season the starks who represent everything that is good in this world were in shambles bran is going to like antarctica sansa is having a borderline pedo relationship in the moon door castle and arya has been walking around for like 3 seasons doing jackshyt i used to like daenerys because she has banging titties and dragons but nope shes too busy playing judge judy in a pyramid rather than fuking shyt up in kings landing instead of showing us any of that we get painful friendzone scenes with jorah every episode that reminds me of my high school days who the fuk am i supposed to root for in this show ok you bring in prince obrien this season and i was balls deep into him the minute they introduced him he kinda looks like me and was an alpha fighter and lover and had some cheeky lines i was rooting for him hard to become the king but nope that neckbeard writes him the most gruesome sickening death ever why couldnt he have just died in 5 seconds atleast the pain wouldnt have been so bad nope you gotta have him die that way wtf is wrong with this show just when i think i was gonna make it this show takes everything i love and face fuks it to death great maybe well get more scenes with that phaggot mountain character who has an iq comparable to shweezy my sports misc boys know wat im talking about meanwhile the pos lannister and tyrell family gets away unscathed again so many lucky bounces going tywin and cerseis way i hate them so fuking badly my golden son jamie in captured by robb stark oh look his beta mom sets him free about to get fuked in the blackwater by stannis nope tywin puts in a last minute cheat code and in come the tyrells with unlimited ships and money to help save the day how do i get rid of robb stark in season 3 ill just scheme some hail mary play with roose and waldy to kill off all the starks at a wedding without losing a single person on my side my grandson joffrey gets poisoned no big deal well have his younger more aesthetic kinder smarter brother become king and not a single fuk was given oh about to have the mountain killed and my shady as fuk past revealed in kings landing naw at the last minute prince obrien is slaughtered and i just moonwalk away again without a scratch i hate this show and im done with it and from the preview next week it looks like my boy jon snow is gonna get fuked up by the wildling army next week dfw the most likeable character left on the show is stannis baratheon who has a swag rating of 14100 i swear by season 7 this show will basically be the lannistersboltonsfreys holding gay orgies in kings landing while stannis and davos conjure up a plan every episode to fuk them up but at the last minute it gets fuked up like the pinky and brain fuk that neckbeard grrm fuk this show fuk the misc and all of you loved beyond anything ever spawned of the internet for all the bolded reasons aboveâ especially bold italics"

"kjm16216",2014-05-19,"thats a big reason why ive never really been on board with the theory because since tyrion kills him its irrelevant but i still am curious to see if dd give any weight to it because of what it would mean for some of the other big theories out there and if they will ever come to fruition or not its relevant to whether he knows who is in his bedroom or if she was planted there i think he may have been poisone but not necessarily fatally just something to keep him occupied on the toilet and not necessarily the viper"

"Boggsy Cyvasse",2014-06-05,"i think pedro might even have made oberyn more personable still cocky and dangerous but a guy that if you didnt bring up his sisters death youd want to have a few drinks and a chat with he made him seem pretty open minded and goodhumored where lannisters and lannister bannermen werent concerned in the books he was also probably my favorite supporting character tied with bronn but much like bronn he benefited greatly by being brought to life on screen by a great actor despite or maybe even because of how much they played up his sexuality his clear love and affection for ellaria and the playfulness between them really spotlighted how much of a dare i say it loving guy he could be granted its not quite as hard to love someone who gives you free reign to stick it to whomever you may desire and that scene with tyrion in the dungeon before he tells him he would be his champion now one of my favorite scenes in the entirety of the show â as ive said in other threads i knew what was coming but i had gotten so reattached to oberyn that i still felt blindsided by the brutality and needlessness of his death that scream from ellaria after beseeching him not to leave her alone in this world ughhhh edited by boggsy cyvasse 05 june 2014  1014 pm"
"Blackfyre Gateau",2014-06-23,"i have to confess to not really rating or paying much heed to the red viper when i first read a storm of swords i had him pegged as an arrogant exuberant hot head i love his portrayal in the hbo series yes he still has his impulsiveness as an achilees heel but he radiates the same kind of intelligence and deepseated sense of justice that you get from doran martell by the end of adwdâ â pedro pascals performance was really quite something im hoping they do as well with the doran martell casting next seasonâ"

"Rashtibram",2014-06-08,"general remarks absolutely hate both daenerys and tywin thought oberyns death was much worse than the red wedding loved aryas laughter and sansas transformation â dont much care about the wall being a big focus for episode nine and theyre even less excited to hear that it will be mostly battle as one of my friends remarked the fight stuff is always so boring kl is definitely the best part of the show cant believe they would leave it out for a whole ep"

"The_Turncloak",2014-06-06,"i didnt think she would be at moat cailin but im disappointed about how theyre treating the ironborn too im afraid were not even going to see the euronvictarion relationship if they keep ignoring them like this and that theyre going to melt them both into an only character no kingsmoot maybe a little conflict with ashayara about the heirloom and then victeuron will go east as victarion does in the books i really hope they keep both euron and victarion but if they keep treating the ironborn like they are some sort of filler i dont think thats going to happen"
"Hippocras",2014-06-06,"i think the opposite the ironborn story just doesnt do much in the current part of the timeline the show went out of their way in fact to give yarra something to do this season so she would not be forgotten the dreadfort scene was otherwise not necessary  it was included to remind show viewers about the ironborn â if yarra had been at moat cailin she would have died so be glad â their storyline ramps up when euron arrives and that could not be included this seasonâ but will be there next season balons death in episode 10 will set it up edited by hippocras 06 june 2014  0606 am"

"BearQueen87",2014-06-02,"â im normally not that much of a nitpicker but although the episode was great from a tv perspective it really irritated me as a book reader my first and biggest gripegrey worm perving on the agedup missandrei when i first saw it i couldnt believe they were going through with it i thought it was corny and silly to give missandrei and grey worm their little romance angle in the previous episode but this took the cake at first i thought they might be retconning the neither root nor stem thing but then dany and missandrei confirm that actually no thats correct theyre cut before the onset of puberty so it makes no sense for grey worm to feel aroused by naked missandrei i wondered briefly if it was a hint grey worm isnt actually a eunuch but the chat he had with missandrei afterwards nixes that idea its completely shoehorned in and unnecessary it feels like thats the only reason they aged up her character to give her a dumb love story and flash tits viewers would probably care about her far more if she was the sweet little girl who dany let her guard down around and shares her bed withover 40 oberynfree minutes in an episode called the mountain vs the viper they dedicated 5 minutes to the fight and gave oberyn only a handful of lines and one brief scene this was his last episode and i wish theyd taken some time to give us one more scene with oberyn and the obscenely talented pedro pascale not anything that would hint at the fact he would be dying just a scene with him visiting tyrion or talking with ellaria about dorne or his time in the second sons just a little more time with him before they oust him foreverlf having no control over sansa who lies to cover up for him that was weird for me in the books littlefinger has a clear plan as to how to get the lords of the vale to do what he wants them to do arbor gold and lies and does it very smoothly in a way that makes the lords of the vale think the plans and ideas were all their own even without marillion to blame i fully expected to see lf enact his plan to control the vale for him to bribe cobray and then feed them lies and arbor gold until he was safe in the books he does this without letting sansa in on his plans in advance and sansa of course never reveals herself as sansa to see petyr totally our of control was uncharacteristic for the show for a man who thrives on unexpected twists and turns sansa was way too comfortable lying on the show compared to how she is in the books and in the books she never really lies of her own volition unless theyre small lies she tells herself are kindly meant it feels like theyre setting up sansa to be littlefingers equal or possibly apprentice in a very heavy handed wayser barristan discovering jorah is a traitor from the earlier episodes when ser barristan has just joined the queensguard im 99 sure i remember him saying something to jorah that basically equated to i know you were spying on dany but im not telling am i going crazy i could have sworn barristan intimated that he knew jorah hadnt been loyal and told him as much but when he gets the pardon sent by tywin he acts as if this is all news to him i freely admit i could be wrong about this though speaking of jorahs dismissal i expected to actually tear up over it but to me their responses danys and to a lesser degree jorahs didnt get across just how utterly devastated both of them are when this happens i know dany manages not to cry and manages to be strong in the book but i didnt see any hint of the panic or fear or hurt or sadness shes struggling to hide either jorah didnt seem like a broken man either though he wasnt 100 broken until yunkai in the books eta i think people who come to the nitpick with impunity threat to nitpick about people nitpicking should be banned its nitpick with impunity and thats what were doingâ you can write an essay about the things that are wrong with a piece of media but it doesnt mean you dislike it or youre punishing yourself by watching there was plenty that i liked about the episode too and i defended it as a whole in one thread i just like analysing the little details that irk me with other people who like analysing little details that irk them â â i dont have a a huge issue with aging up messandi and i think the commentary on gray worm and her would be an interesting story if it didnt lead down the path to some sort of new romance what i have an issue with is that they felt the need to do it this episdoe which brings be to your point about oberyn the fact that the episode only focuses on obery for about 10 mins altogether is a a major flaw there was stuff that could have been reduced or cut altogether cut the gray worm and messandi storyline and save it for next season reduce time spent on the beetles â as for the danyjorah scene i did think it had an emotional punchparticualrly from iain glens performancebut i do wish they had used some of the really hard hitting dialogue from the book especially i wanted to go home and i was going to take you there thats sort of the core of their relationship they want the same thing home to not have home being tossed around in that moment feltâ like a bit of a disservice to the scene"

"Bridgeburners",2014-06-03,"i dont get why they didnt do the arstan whitebeard approach its still a compelling plot element even if most viewers or those who care enough to research if they forgot what selmy looked like in s1 would have known just because they lose that twist element for us that doesnt mean they could have done away with it in fact it might have even felt more intriguing to unsullied who realized that barristan selmy was in her ranks and thought of how it would play out his original intention for disguising himself was to trick jorah right so that he can gauge jorah as a spy without letting jorah catch on to what hes doing then they could have had that double interrogation between dany and them which i thought was a fantastic scene hell they didnt even need strong belwas for the whitebeard plot â but then in dds minds if you remove the twist aspect of it you have nothing left they believe that the twist is everything in got which is why they poured so much effort into building up oberyns character or building up the romance between robb and talisa etc the idea that it may just be an intriguing and interesting dynamic that works as a great catalyst for the event of her banishing him is probably lost on them â also they would hate for some of the unsullied to not realize that hes selmy while others do because they have to explicitly club us over the head with whats going on all the time no viewer left behind and whatnotâ edited by bridgeburners 03 june 2014  1209 pm"

"BearQueen87",2014-06-03,"i think one of the biggest problems with the jorahdany scene and there are a few problems as many of us have pointed out goes back to a choice the writers made in s2 which was to not show the full extent of the house of the undying the prophecies dany gets in that chapter affect her she becomes rather obsessed with trying to figure it out and wants to put everyone she meets into a tiny box to match the prophecy in the book during the jory dismissal her internal monologue really reflects her conflict over how she cares for jorah vs what this might mean vis a vis the prophecy and future betrayal her hatred for anything lannister or baratheon clouded her judgement here the show hasnt done a good enough job of showing how the prophecy affected her and how literally she takes it because they short changed the hofu scene like crazy still bitter about that one â so the whole dany jorah exchange in this episode comes across and sudden and confusing because wth was tywin thinking and feels like they need to create conflict of dany and jorah to push into s5 but there is no real understanding of why dany let him go"

"Rapsie",2014-06-02,"had the five year gap been in place the tension with the vale lords would have been mainly resolved anyway building up consistent characterization is not a strong point if the show so the turn around of sansas character is done in one scene it also depends how much filler dd decide to add next year although a vale tour does suggest she could bump into sandor if he remains alive"

"Alayne's Shadow.",2014-06-02,"sansa is confirmed in episode 10 we will probably see her again in at least one scene â now thats its been some hours i can safely say that this episode was not what i expected at all first sansa revealed who she was to the lord declarants  that was actually very surprising and i had to keep myself from yelling omg because i especially thought that was quite spoilerish i think theres also a big foreshadow about the vale lords declaring for sansa robb stark is dead i think that may be material for 4x10 or the episode could end in the bookscene where petyr reveals his plans to sansa which would be weird now that she has gained the upper hand â that sansa planned that was quite interesting and it was obvious they wanted to show sansas development from pawn to player even if at lfs expense and the bedroom scene was also quite straightforward where sansa basically says that she knows what lf wants that combined with sansas last scene walking down the stairs fully dressed like alayne makes me wonder thats certainly not booksansa at least not yet â the dress reminded me of petyr rather than disney villains it tried to convey some mockingbird connection or at least it seemed from my pointofview lf wears black and sansa seems to mimick him in her attire as alayne which makes sense since she is his niece is alayne bastard in the series"

"Gogossos",2014-06-02,"i honestly dont think were in uncharted twow territory except for one thing sansa doesnt do anything that she didnt do in affc that one thing is coming out explicitly to lords royce and corbray and lady waynwood her alias is still intact hence the hair and dress she didnt dye her hair until now because she was stuck in the eyrie â lfs little tale about lysas demise wouldnt have fooled those guys lfs tale with alaynes corroboration would have fared only slightly better it is sansa starks name and presence that seals the deal basically the prime vale lords discover they have bigger fish to fry than lysas death something they will revisit some other day but for now they have to wonder how to deal with sansas presence in their midst i think that was the same dynamic in the books too the elaborate lie that sansa participated in only got accepted pretty much because sansa was telling it i think dd made a smart change they let sansa accept that the ruse will not fool anyone and let her deliberately leverage her own name thats why i think we are still in affc with sansa her twow material will be explored next season in this episode it was stated that robin is sickly  so they will need time to establish thatâ â sansa is now explicitly doing what she subtly does or is trying to do in the books i dont think we spedskipped forward that much"

"hallam",2014-06-02,"it sort of changes the dynamic of what the role of alayne means for sansa this portrays it as just her playing a part and everyone who matters already knows who she really is it seems she cannot ever assume the persona as deeply as she did in the books perhaps the ability to assume the role of alayne with great depth is irrelevant to her progression in the bookâ i think they are skipping the alayne part and good riddance â novels and tv have different requirements a novel can have a minor character in every scene without ever giving them a proper role a tv series cant have a character on the set every day for four seasons without giving them a proper roleâ â sansa is obviously going to be more important in book 6 onwards grrm has killed off everyone else but sophie turner cant wait for a whole new season just to get a character the viewers dont hate â it makes sense to make more of sansa in any case because without sansa no more baelish and now hes out of kl no more varys to spar with no more small council â but i think there is another part to it and that is that baelish is very similar to cersei in that he spends a lot of time scheming but it does not get him as far as he imagines baelish is the nominal lord of harrenhal but hasnt set foot there â i have the feeling that baelish is going to end up poisoned or otherwise disposed of by sansa"

going to be dead by the end of the season â â maybe that death is coming sooner than we think â you know that thought occurred to me this morning that perhaps petyr dies in episode 10 and while i think thats entirely possible i dont think its plausible i think hell still serve some sort of purpose to her storyline even if it is ultimately to make her a killer meaning she kills him i do agree though that his death will probably come sooner rather than later â well i have to say that they kinda killed booksansa in the show here but booooooy how i loved this episode ive separated book from show some time ago so i dont really mind what they did in this episode sansa is becoming a player and a lot faster than we think i honestly havent seen any negative comment about sansa with regards to this episode not on twitter facebook tumblr etc which makes me more happy than it shouldâ â we must follow very different people on tumblr a couple of people i follow are having kittens granted i think it has a lot to do with the utter disapproval of the potential sansapetyr seduction storyline but i also think it has a lot to do with upholding some sort of innocentvirginalangelicideal sansa that theyve built up in their minds and while i understand the desire to keep her good because i desperately want that myself im not of the opinion that these changes make her bad on the contrary i think it gives her control over the events of her life and whether she sinks or swims at least shell have died trying see ive heard a lot of reasons as to why people dont like sansa but the most consistent complaint has always been her lack offight shes passive the perpetual damsel in distress this change of characterpersonality has really served to kind of put those complaints to bed and more importantly it has given both breath and depth to the argument that a lot of sansa fansand even sophie turner herselfhave made that a person can be badass and have power without ever needing to wield a sword â â â but for the rest of this season sansas storyline will be pure plot development and no more major drama â i dont know im taking a wait and see approach ok so now that we all know that sophie wasnt trolling in all of her interviewscomments regarding this seasontheres something shes said that makes me think we might yet get something big in episode 10 in a recent interview sophie said something about the finale being huge and hopeful that word sticks out to me the way her saying seduction stuck out to me previously hopeful whats there to be hopeful about so as is my wont let me launch into my first bought of speculation i think the finale will have a vision one of brans visions and that vision will give us a glimpse into some of the endgame scenarios for the children ie the stark kids tyrionjamiecersei the dragon etc also sophie has said that shes a dark horse im not sure if that means something different in the uk but over here i associate that term with an underdog in either sports or politics seemingly coming out of nowhere and winning the whole damn thing somaybea bran vision of sansa on the throne or in some sort of position of power im leaning towards this speculationâ theres a reason they fast forwarded her well find out next season â indeed we will and im cautiously optimistic about it â their power dynamic has completely shifted â and that is the greatest thing in the world to me â i mean it gives sansa the upperhand which is something she has never had throughout the whole series and it finally makes the story about her this is her storyline now its not petyrs its not kings landing its not anyone elses its hers and that the majority of people are completely into and riveted by it finally gives me a sense of vindication you know what i mean likeyeahshes amazing shes always been im glad you guys are finally catching on and seeing it â ive read the books but one thing i never could understand is who alayne is supposed to be is she going to be petyrs protege please tell me that sansa is not going to be another cersei i cant bare it i love sansa but seeing her in all black and lying just made me sad  â this right now is probably my biggest secret fear that shell end up becoming another cersei as of right now though im convincing myself that its possible but not probable â on the plus side the power balance shift means no lf foisting kisses and such on sansa no daddydaughter roleplaying either less child molesting is always a good thing sansa revealing herself to the vale lords was a neat bit of insurance if lf acts up or something happens to him she can go crying to the lords for protection and if the vale lords act up or try to sell her out she can fall back on lf also sansa effectively disarmed lf by taking away his source of power over her that he was her only protector and the one who could expose her secret she shot the hostage essentially by pulling the sansa stark trigger on her own terms to maintain control rather than waiting for someone to pull it for her â have i ever described my secret love and affection for you because its there ohhhhhhh its there â this your post all of thisâ â"

"ovis alba",2014-05-19,"damn it i already care about oberyn more than ive ever cared in the books this is going to be awful â this i sort of did like him in the book but i also appreciated the way he died because it felt like a twist on all the evil mastermind that need to first give a speech about his whole plan before killing the hero which of course always makes him fail in the show the whole role is just even more charismatic and i like how he mixes up things eg in the council scene as a counterpart to mace especially i know for the story it really has to happen but its not like a certain wedding where i sort of looked forward to the moment but at the moment the fact that the character will be lost sort of hurts more than the excitment about the scene"

"Father of Dragons",2014-05-19,"i really hope we get a recap this time after watching it on youtube after the episode officially aired it was clearly just a mistake on someones part a mistake i hope they dont make againin the north theon and ramsay ride to moat cailin to negotiate with the ironborn if theres any chance of yara itll be before they arrive we will be getting more of yara because theres a shot of her in her boat in the day it could be her rowing to moat cailin or to another ship beyond the moat personally i think the moat looks pretty good this scene should play out kinda like the books but im not sure to what extent they will follow imo theon still looks like reek hes notwhole enough to pass as theon but i guess well just see where it goesin the riverlands i had hoped that briennepod and houndarya would be headed for collision or at least a nearmiss but since they this week arrived at the inn of the kneeling man i assume of course could be the crossroads itd be a big fuck you to logic if they did arya and sandor have been travelling to the vale for close to a whole season brienne left only a few episodes ago if they met it wouldnt make a whole lot of sense if however brienne arrived at the inn at the crossroads then coming across each other or at least being very close is possible however either way i do not believe that they will collide it seems more likely that this episode either the hounds wound will grow worse and he will start a fight at the bloody gate or it is just one of them whether or not he will get left behind in this episode im not sure briennewise this episode seems the most likely to contain the biting of the mans ear i dint know who itll be or where itll happen i just hope she is knocked unconscious and gets taken awayat the eyrie it is clear that the lords  lady dont trust baelish so they will ask san  sorry  alayne lord baelish has told many lies my theory on this is that they will say that lysa simply slipped and fell when alayne says i have to tell the truth baelish might worry or he might have confidence in her to lie i think she will tell the lords  lady that lysa was drunk and didnt say immediately to protect her memoryin meereen if we get anything it will be tywins letter arriving and jorah being exposed hell definitely be banished in episode 10in moles town and at the wall its clear that the wildlings attack moles town and gillys life is put in danger i dont think she will does on another note the way ygritte is holding the knife makes me think that she will hold it to someones neck rather than stab someone its possible a whore will shout theyre here for the wildling and gilly will ehat her escape or be taken prisoner if gilly arrives sams tears are because he thinks he is an idiot who out gillys life in danger if gilly does not arrive and is a prisoner sams tears are because he thinks he is an idiot who got gilly killedin kings landing undoubtedly the saddest and most shocking part of the episode i dont care if the unsullied complain we havent got enough oberyn because no matter how much they get they can always appreciate his somewhat limited badassery youre going to fight that oberyns line im going to kill that better follow anyway well get a scene or two with oberyn and tyrion definitely one before the fight possibly one near the beginning of the episode as well cerseis line about burning our house could be this episode but as someone else said if it was in the finale itd be more obvious foreshadowing for next year i loved the say her name elia of dorne lines in the books and that makes me think that theyll be omitted from the show i doubt hell do his big twirl while shouting elia i also hope they keep in the skullsmashing my guess is gregor will say his lines raise his fist and the camera will cut to tyrion or tywin or cersei or ellaria as blood squirts up from where gregor is punching"

"HelenaExMachina",2014-05-20,"â good summary i agree that gilly will most likely be the one informing the nw of the attack on mole town and arya abandoning the hound makes percet sense being in this episode as it would basically be the end of both clegane brothers â and i agree with ignorant bog woman this episode will be really disturbing by which i mean more than usual i wouldnt count on gilly warning the watch we sam crying and this is presumably in response tonews of the attack if gilly had brought the news then he wouldnt be so upset my guess is ygritte or someone else makes some mention of her as crasters wife and takes her captive for some reason the warning imo will either come from some black brother digging for buried treasure or more likely they see the smoke to the south sansas scene looks intriguing i have to tell them the truth interesting i wonder what truth she will tell them if she says something like it was my fault i can imagine something like now now you mustnt blame yourself hopefully from yohn royce to get the viewers to see hik and the lords declarant as good imo the story will be that she fell whilst drunk or something similar since we have noscapegoat i hope we get roberts reaction to her death his obsession with making people fly would make this all the more tragic for him also sounds like we get the great lines from ellaria and oberyn are you going to fight that im going to kill that hope they keep ellaria around for next season when we get to see dorne"

"Blockfetcher",2014-05-21,"â it matters because its bad writing absolutely terrible writing not only may it impact how people see the climax of stannis story but its also dull to watch in its own right at the end of s3 were told quite explicitly that stannis will be going to the wall at the start of s4 hes brooding in dragonstone with no indication whatsoever that he has any plans to go to the wall that isnt a red herring thats just stupid i guarantee you when episode 9 comes around and all the unsullied reflect on stannis arc they wont be saying wow what a great red herring stannis sulking was theyll say damn the was some godawful writing there â i can tell you this now they really wont give a damn all theyre going to care about is how awesome and surprising stanniss arrival at the wall to save the day will be and that finally hes doing something worthwhileâ"

"DaveyJoe",2014-05-21,"in my opinion they are trying to make the audience forget â but nothing in stannis season 4 scenes have indicated that his plans have changed"
"King Tommen",2014-05-21,"although in the books they never explicitly stated they were going to the wall wasnt the letter that davos reads a pretty massive hint that was what was going to happen especially as it followed the nw sending ravens out to all the kings in westeros asking for help â almost like how in the s3 finale davos tells stannis that they cant go to the wall until he has the men and ships necessary and that he would work on securing those things for him and then this season stannis asks a couple of times what the progress is on this front to davos he even says that both he and davos are running out of time â do they say remember weve got to get to the wall like we said last season no thats obviously by design it creates the surprise in a different way the books does and is leaving information out on purpose to create this surprise just as the books do but on rewatch or reread the audience can see that they were definitely working towards this all along it just wasnt being made explicitly clear â i much prefer this approach to every episode someone mentioning man we better get to the wall soon like we said we were going to"

"mothbomb",2014-05-21,"davos seems like a survivor beyond even stannis i think davos has some role to play in the endgame he is a good negotiator hes essentially the tyrion of the stannis storyline another mutilated broken character who has lost everything but never seems to come across as being a dark character his crimes of smuggling really seem minor considering the brutality of his punishment davos would make a great hand of the king to any faction"

"The Onion Sleight",2014-05-21,"since so many guys dabating here about stannis arrival and if its gonna be a surprise that are some posts from the neogaf  ptv unsullied â stannis sailing north or south i think were pretty close to seeing stannis invading kings landing again and finally becoming king which will be interesting to see if he keeps to his honor or will be influenced by melisandre once again similar to real history with the vatican and other religious figures the problem is i want the fight to be decent but dont want it to take up too much because im selfish and realize this season is close to ending with a lot of plots still needing to advance in some sort of meaningful way i mean stannis obviously wont be invading while this trial is going on so that means i have to wait even longer for the inevitable invasion and coronation and its driving me crazy i want to see if stannis is going to be the type of king he would have been before he met melisandre or if hell be a zealot making things worse because of her that and we know hes one of the few to worry about the white walkers meaning we wont see some major action with them until hes king in my opinion im hoping the end of this season has those crazy bastards starting to invade at least but the stannis story is heading somewhere now i suspect we might see the conclusion of that story arc soon one way or another im fairly sure theyre heading to kings landing where are they sailing to i just dont see anything happening as far as his claim to the throne because even with all the money in braavos and their ships he still only has 4000 men unless they hire sell swords which i doubt its still going to be a while before he attacks the timing would be a bit off to be honest but the way i see if this invasion of kings landing is going to happen its going to happen by the end of this season or else itd happen at the end of the next season dragging out over the entire season id like to think that the show writers have heard peoples complaints about dragging storylines out and would avoid doing so yeah im prepared for the next episode to be a total emotional rollercoaster i think oberyn will beat the mountain and it will be an awesome battle but with all the slow wind going on with stannis plot and melisandres conversation with selyse im half expecting stannis to bust in unannounced with an army of mercenaries and start indiscriminately slaughtering everyone in sight but only after oberyns triumphant victory over the mountain because that will be the point most people will stop being prepared to lose a favorite character shit the season tag line all men must die could mean be this stannis coming in unannounced and just slaughtering everyone it would make sense for stannis to rally the north around him first then take kings landing but then again its seems blackwater bay is a pretty good place to launch an attack from considering most of his force got wiped out and he still took the beach and breached the walls blackwater bay again i dont see it happening unless he uses a two pronged approach like you said he would have to rally the north but how payouts   saving them from the white walkers but that seems like a while away one minute into the fight the bells will sound throughout kings landingstannis is coming â im very stunned about their preditictions and have to laugh extremely about them xd  but i will admit its very very difficult for me to put myself in unsullieds shoes im not sure what id think if i hadnt read the books but to everybody who thought the unsullied arent so dumb they wont forget the scene in 3x10 well it isnt a thing of forgetting not only imo its more a mix of â  nobody mentions even one word like north nights watch others wildlings or whatever and nobody really says where theyre heading to this whole season or how theyre going to use their new gold for what they build again an army â and â  of course all the talk about rights stannis claim mustnt be forgotten the situation changed after joffreys death the lannisters and kl are getting weaker stannis gets more goldmen â well i think thats how hardcore unsullied should see it stannis is still obsessed with his rights the fight for the it seems more important for him joffreys death changed his opinion about their next steps i agree that doesnt fit to the events of 3x10 but remember thats how unsullied shcould see it especially if they dont know him well and if he has the chance to invade kl and get the throne why wouldnt somebody as stannis use this now all they have to do is giving these unsullied a phenomenal ninth episode and still avoiding every spoiler eg no stannis in the recap and the preview and then the super nice talk with jon in episode 10 about rights  duties and winning and throne  saving the kingdom and the only enemyfight that matters and  their surprise worked â if this will really work ill be very satisfied â especially if these people thinking the ninth episode will be blackwater 20 and stannis will slaughering a bunch of beloved characters in kl mean this seriously and then he shows up at the wall in the ninth episode and saves a bunch of beloved people and the whole realm im looking forward to their reactions the people are way to traumatised after 1x09 and 3x09 their panic what will happen this year is somehow cute â â i know unsullied who see his decision how to use his new gold and army now as a decision between kl and the wall so you could say kl  his rights  the fight for the it or the wall  his duties  the fight for his realm and his people against the only enemy that matters when people think hes going to choose invading kl then they swallowed the red herring and not only episode 9 will surprise them also stannis next actions decisions his awesome development which fits to his coming storyline â and imo wont any unsullied say something about terrible writing especially when the arrival is awesome rather theyll think they got trolledconfused but then when they reflect about the whole sitation theyll realized that it was the wall all the time and they was wrong about stannis and hopefully begin to see him in another better light edited by the onion sleight 21 may 2014  0417 pm"

"HelenaExMachina",2014-05-21,"i guess brienne wont appear next season until episode 8 or 9 they can probably work that out with gwens contract and it would be the best thing imo would they really leave a cliffhanger for 89 episodes though cutting a main character from most of the series is one thing but ls will be a shock factor and likely cliffhanger what will happen to brienne this applies even if ls doesnt hang her this season"

"WheelofIceandFire",2014-05-21,"i can see arya and the hound getting about 10 minutes overall in this episode 2 scenes â there is a brief clip of the hound telling her about how men kill with steel as they walk side by side this is most likely before their fight â there are also a few shots of arya practicing with needle and quicky turning around on a cliff and then a shot of her climbing on aâ rockâ she looks suprised so i am guessing that the hound gets attacked whilst she is practicing and she reaches him just in time to kill the last attacker â i can see her saving his life in this episode before they show up again in the finale and the hound asks her to give him the gift"
"Chebyshov",2014-05-21,"i think brienne simply sees catelyn this finale  she acts horrified and the episode ends next season in premiere perhaps the hanging occurs and then she shows up again near the end â i think thats very possible the hanging would be a hell of a long scene to set up in an episode that already has to cram in a lot â â would they really leave a cliffhanger for 89 episodes though cutting a main character from most of the series is one thing but ls will be a shock factor and likely cliffhanger what will happen to brienne this applies even if ls doesnt hang her this season â if brienne isnt hung until next season then it could work then again they werent willing to give stannis an 89 episode cliffhanger this year"

"DaveyJoe",2014-05-21,"since so many guys dabating here about stannis arrival and if its gonna be a surprise that are some posts from the neogaf  ptv unsullied â â im very stunned about their preditictions and have to laugh extremely about them xd  but i will admit its very very difficult for me to put myself in unsullieds shoes im not sure what id think if i hadnt read the books but to everybody who thought the unsullied arent so dumb they wont forget the scene in 3x10 well it isnt a thing of forgetting not only imo its more a mix of â  nobody mentions even one word like north nights watch others wildlings or whatever and nobody really says where theyre heading to this whole season or how theyre going to use their new gold for what they build again an army â and â  of course all the talk about rights stannis claim mustnt be forgotten the situation changed after joffreys death the lannisters and kl are getting weaker stannis gets more goldmen â well i think thats how hardcore unsullied should see it stannis is still obsessed with his rights the fight for the it seems more important for him joffreys death changed his opinion about their next steps i agree that doesnt fit to the events of 3x10 but remember thats how unsullied shcould see it especially if they dont know him well and if he has the chance to invade kl and get the throne why wouldnt somebody as stannis use this now all they have to do is giving these unsullied a phenomenal ninth episode and still avoiding every spoiler eg no stannis in the recap and the preview and then the super nice talk with jon in episode 10 about rights  duties and winning and throne  saving the kingdom and the only enemyfight that matters and  their surprise worked â if this will really work ill be very satisfied â especially if these people thinking the ninth episode will be blackwater 20 and stannis will slaughering a bunch of beloved characters in kl mean this seriously and then he shows up at the wall in the ninth episode and saves a bunch of beloved people and the whole realm im looking forward to their reactions the people are way to traumatised after 1x09 and 3x09 their panic what will happen this year is somehow cute â â i know unsullied who see his decision how to use his new gold and army now as a decision between kl and the wall so you could say kl  his rights  the fight for the it or the wall  his duties  the fight for his realm and his people against the only enemy that matters when people think hes going to choose invading kl then they swallowed the red herring and not only episode 9 will surprise them also stannis next actions decisions his awesome development which fits to his coming storyline â and imo wont any unsullied say something about terrible writing especially when the arrival is awesome rather theyll think they got trolledconfused but then when they reflect about the whole sitation theyll realized that it was the wall all the time and they was wrong about stannis and hopefully begin to see him in another better light â i think another thing is that the showand the books can be unpredictable in many ways â so viewers are just making constant predictions and then second guessing themselves â sometimes your imagination just gets carried away while speculating â when stannis saves the wall viewers wont think it was terrible writing they will realize that it was spelled out last season and the characters have just been building to this moment"
"Konradsmith",2014-05-21,"indeed though really this stannis spec would be better suited to the ep nine thread â heresâ my two cents with a large cast you have to sideline characters from time to time theyve gotten better at doing that especially this season with bran and theons storylines only showing up when they have something to do of interest they are playing a bit of a game with the stan writing and trying to make us think he has his eyes on kl now but that will sell his arrival its supposed to be a surprise so theyre making it one how thats bad writing i dont know it will also make his decision to go to the wall more impressive when really he could have tried a blackwater 20 if he wanted to now with a great deal more success but he chose not to for the sake of the realm but as i said this is really for the other thread edited by konradsmith 21 may 2014  0836 pm"

"Tyrion1991",2014-05-26,"â letter from tywin arriving look of realization on danys face â that would be a very weak way to end danys part of that episode especially since we would have no clarification on what she has read for another two weeks and jorah gets exiled fairly quickly before we have to focus on the dragons being caged it makes much more sense to devote more time to having him exiled rather than spend a few minutes building tension with missandei before she gets tywins ridiculous hatemail honestly she will look so stupid if she exiles jorah because tywin essentially tells her to this being the mighty tywins master plan hbo have promised big event episodes but what you describe sounds like filler"

"SoManyVows",2014-05-26,"the letter is a horrible ideaâ it makes dany look incredibly stupid because she does what her enemies tell her to do and makes it far too explicit that this isnt in her interests in the books jorah gets called out by the greatest and most honorable knight in westeros in the tv series its by a baby killing sociopath and the man who betrayed her father â it diminishes tywin his only plan to deal with dany is to send a nasty letter badmouthing her closest advisor in the hope that she kills him especially when that leaves her with the fabled barristan selmy the book tywin if he had known about daenerys which he never did would have done a lot more to deal with the problem instead the show has had to make him look like an idiot by dismissing the threat of a targaryen with three dragons and the best army in the world the fact is that such a reveal would massively change the story making him a glorified shit stirrer just makes him look petty hes got no way of knowing that dany will exile him especially since him telling her involves verifying that jorah has went against them in the books he never expressly goes against varys and we only have his word that he stopped reporting at qaarth this is one of the things that appauls dany the fact that he never told his masters that you were my man now tywins letter would actually end up vouching for his loyalty to dany not the other way around â â â they havent brought the stories together at all hbo is just pretending it has and having the characters talk about one anothers stories without considering the implications and without any consequences for example if dany had known that westeros was ripe for the taking then she would probably not have felt she needed to stay in westeros in the books she felt that westeros wasnt going anywhere and there was no incentive to rush to the prize because she was not aware of the situation in westeros if the only result of this is that tywin gets jorah exiled instead of barristan then thats a shockingly weak way to try and tie the two stories together â i think that its fairly certain at this point tywins letter will be the instrument that reveals jorahs spying to daenerys but your concerns about it diminishing daenerys and tywin are probably overstated because i doubt very much that the letter is addressed directly to her i expect that it will play out in a more insidious fashion than that â in the laws of gods and men tywin asked varys if it would be possible to get your little birds inside meereen varys responded that he could and it was then that tywin asked mace to fetch him his quill and parchment now if he sent that letter directly to daenerys it would alert her to jorahs former activities but approaching her so directly would also make it easier for her to dismiss such news as a piece of enemy propaganda designed to sew discord in her camp which it is at the very least it would give jorah some measure of plausible deniability he might not have the worlds best poker face but unlike in the books theres no one present in meereen to stand witness against him since barristan didnt sit on roberts small council furthermore he hasnt been making overt unwanted romantic overtures towards her in the show his love for her has been more chaste so their relationship isnt strained by her suspicions on that count unless he makes a move on her in this episode  which i doubt daenerys might angrily confront jorah with the knowledge of his past deeds but unless he screws up royally he would have a fairly decent chance at defending himself â tywins a smart guy  he knows this thats why i personally think that its more likely that tywin will leak that knowledge to daenerys without making it explicitly clear to her that hes the one whos pulling the strings rather than delivering a letter to daenerys signed with his name and marked with the lannister seal it would be far more effective for varys little birds to plant evidence of jorahs past deeds and then arrange for one of danys other confidantes to discover it inadvertently that way when they tell her it will appear as though jorah was willfully concealing things from daenerys come to think of it jorah might still have the royal pardon that robert granted him back in the first season tucked away somewhere in his belongings we never did see him get rid of it if they can make it look like jorah is still actively spying on daenerys then it will be much harder for him to argue his case to her lets say that she confronts him and basically says grey wormmissandeibarristan found evidence that youve been spying on me tell me that this isnt true in that context his confession that he actually was spying on her back in the first season but stopped will come across as at least partial conformation and it will likely cause dany to treat him with further suspicion and hostility to the point where she decides to banish him even though their relationship in the show is stronger than their relationship in the books â as for your claim that the show has had to make tywin look like an idiot by dismissing the threat of a targaryen with three dragons and the best army in the world youre overlooking abundant evidence to the contrary yes tywin was dismissive of dany and her dragons when he talked to joffrey in the bear and the maiden fair last season but this year we have seen two scenes that make it explicitly clear that he takes her seriously as a threat there was his conversation with oberyn in breaker of chains and the aforementioned small council meeting in the laws of gods and men you may feel differently but i think that theyve done a far better job of making tywin look informed and competent when it comes to daenerys on the show than he was in the books where he was almost entirely ignorant of her capabilities likewise i think dany is both more ruthless and less impetuous on the show than she is in the books  a consequence of her being aged up jorahs betrayal may have played out differently in the show than in than in the books but i have faith that the show will serve all of the characters

most well known accomplishment was storming the walls of pyke this isnt jon connington were talking about here and whilst the show has portrayed him as fairly smart sort of in the books as well theres no way that tywin or even varys would be aware of this jorah has never been in a position of command or leadership its very much making a big assumption that tywin is magically aware that jorah is actually a better advisor than barristan in the shows portrayel but he has no reason to assume that barristan was a member of the kingsguard and has actually commanded armies in mutliple wars and experienced the poltiics as a member of the kingsguard for example he led the conquest of one of the iron islands jorah really should not be tywins priority when it comes to removing danys advisors from tywins perspective barri is the real threat oh thats right the show wants tywin to do something with dany so its making him responsible for something which is going to happen anyway because they want to trick viewers into thinking that danys arc is part of the main story its a pointless deviation tywin should be focusing on assasinating barri and dany herself not jorah its just because jorah gets exiled that theyve decided well make the mighty tywin shit stir to get rid of jorah this is weak on hbos part to try to make a subplot of tywin influencing events in meereen by making him responsible for book events that had nothing to do with him â um no tywin in the previous episode said dragons havent won a war in 300 years armies win them all the time he is still very much dismissing the threat posed by the dragons and his opening salvo is lets get her to exile jorah wtf if tywin had known about dany it would have been the absolute focus of his policy he should be raising every soldier in the westerlands recruiting advisors and experts who would know how to deal with dragons every expert would tell him that one dragon could defeat any army and destroy casterly rock that dorne only won by not fighting the targaryen dragons and that a dragon can only be killed by another dragon or by insane levels of luck he should be 100 aware that oberyn tried to raise dorne in rebellion for danys brother and are diehard targ loyalists he shouldnt be considering allies if anything he should have preemptively invaded dorne before they could join dany made peace with the ironborn rather than have a war on two fronts and worse leave the door open for them to ally with daenerys which they intend to do under euron and vic the show has made a collossal deviation from grrm story in making tywin aware of dany so early and it would have had dramatic implications for the actions of every faction in westeros but the show doesnt want to make big changes just to give the impression that the stories have something to do with eachother plus hes dismissing dragons which his oh so accurate reports should have told him went from being hand sized hatchlings to 12ft monsters in the space of less than a year thats near 10 times bigger they are obviously going to become fully grown but again tywin being aware of that would mean he would devote much more effort and this would change the story too much so they make him a dumbass and dismiss the threat posed by the dragons one of whom could kill all 60000 of his men and melt his castle with ease in another year the man discovered the enemy has nukes and has flat out dismissed them mark of an idiot edited by tyrion1991 26 may 2014  0505 pm"

"Le Cygne",2014-05-26,"grrm likes shakespeareâ youve got many books that have the same basic idea when you look at them its all in the execution originality is great but its an overrated virtue i think shakespeare wasnt very original he was just very very good he could write exactly the same story that someone else had previously put down but the way he did it elevated it to an all time classic as opposed to whatever had been beforehttpwwwyoutubechvcnbvf5rfpkw edited by le cygne 26 may 2014  0615 pm"

"Annara Snow",2014-05-27,"â see this is what i originally thought as well but it has suddenly dawned on me to wonder who exactly can she lie and manipulate or play the game with she cant interact with anyone outside of the vale because shes wanted for regicide thus making the scope of her game rather limited and it would actually be in her best interest to tell the lords who she really is as theyd be more inclined to support the niece of lysadaughter of ned and cat rather than the bastard niecedaughter of littlefinger who they resent anyways im honestly perplexed about where her story is going â how would she know that and for that matter how would you know that sansa stark is wanted by the crown for regicide the vale stayed out of the war yes it was lysa who decided not to get involved but its not like the lords from the vale rebelled against her and proclaimed their desire to go to war on robbs side and that was when he was still alive why would sansa assume that they are going to support her and what start a war against the lannisters and their allies boltons and freys all on their own since there is no stark or tully force now and why what does it have to do with the vale why should they support her just because shes sansa stark rather than turning her over to tywin and cersei which they would demand as soon as they got word that sansa is in the vale  and something like that would be impossible to hide with lots of people knowing it sansa announcing her identity at this point makes zero sense just as it did in the book she doesnt even know these people or what they want at least with littlefinger she knows that he wants to keep her alive and away from kings landing shes not trying to get support as his daughterniecewhatever shes trying to remain unnoticed and survive â this too i keep waiting for what sophie and aiden have been saying to materialize because i dont think they were trolling in the end when lf asks sansa whos side shes on i want her to say my side that way she keeps him guessing throughout the testimony and it adds some damn umph to character shit man give me umph â i hope not its bad enough that theyve made lf and margaery painfully obvious on the show they should at least let sansa retain the mask of a naive scared young girl which sophie has said in interviews sansa is doing and which she was doing with lysa that he thinks he can mold into what he wants  which is her best chance to manipulate him and others it would be absurd if she was all look at me im a strong young woman who will take no shit from you just because some viewers would think its cool edited by annara snow 27 may 2014  0144 pm"

"Ignorant Bog Woman",2014-05-27,"this has all probably been mentioned but this is what i learned from the recap confirms that jorah will be discovered and he will bring up the time he saved dany from the wineseller jorah will probably be incriminated with a pardon from tywin grey wormmissandei relationship will develop further hes probably the one spying on her while shes bathing buttnaked lol more of olly looking at ygritte hes definitely killing her episode will start with moles town getting attacked"
"Father of Dragons",2014-05-27,"confirms that jorah will be discovered and he will bring up the time he saved dany from the wineseller i think its more likely that she brings it up but if he does and says something like remember i saved you from that wine seller to which she will say holy shit thats how you knew i just thought you were magical so i never actually bothered to ask you how you knew even if it was just a lucky guess  which is incredibly unlikely more of olly looking at ygritte hes definitely killing herpossibly in a boromir fashion"

"iheartseverus",2014-05-27,"my guess and hope is that while sandor is wounded in this episode probably because hes already weakened and feverish from that bite they dont take it right to the gift of mercy in this episode but let it play out a bit let it linger until ep10â theres great drama for viewers in watching this ferocious tormented man slowly brought down along with all the attendant questionswill he dieâ will ayra help save himâ should he die does he deserve to die or notâ â its good drama should be allowed to play out allowing the viewers time to talk it out to wonder worry cheer hope whatever before the final answer is deliveredâ"

"TeamLemonCakeBraavos",2014-05-27,"how would she know that and for that matter how would you know that sansa stark is wanted by the crown for regicide the vale stayed out of the war yes it was lysa who decided not to get involved but its not like the lords from the vale rebelled against her and proclaimed their desire to go to war on robbs side and that was when he was still alive why would sansa assume that they are going to support her and what start a war against the lannisters and their allies boltons and freys all on their own since there is no stark or tully force now and why what does it have to do with the vale why should they support her just because shes sansa stark rather than turning her over to tywin and cersei which they would demand as soon as they got word that sansa is in the vale  and something like that would be impossible to hide with lots of people knowing it sansa announcing her identity at this point makes zero sense just as it did in the book she doesnt even know these people or what they want at least with littlefinger she knows that he wants to keep her alive and away from kings landing shes not trying to get support as his daughterniecewhatever shes trying to remain unnoticed and survive â i hope not its bad enough that theyve made lf and margaery painfully obvious on the show they should at least let sansa retain the mask of a naive scared young girl which sophie has said in interviews sansa is doing and which she was doing with lysa that he thinks he can mold into what he wants  which is her best chance to manipulate him and others it would be absurd if she was all look at me im a strong young woman who will take no shit from you just because some viewers would think its cool â why would the vale lords support sansa and not turn her into the lannisters well we should probably begin with the fact that the vale lords think it was the lannisters who killed jon arryn so you know theres that add onto that the fact that ned stark and robert baratheon were known and liked in the vale when they were jon arryns wards theres also the fact that the knights of the vale wereare angry that lysa did not assist robb in his war which indicates to me a loyalty to the stark family and im fairly certain the vale lords and knights wouldnt be entirely comfortably with forking her over so easily also werent bronze royce and ned stark really good friends i think i recall reading that whypray tell would ned starks homeboy hand over his daughter to the lannisters or let anyone else do it for that matterâ â and who said anything about anyone going to war i personally didnt mention anything about anyone going to war for sansa im only talking about her revealing her true identity where you got this war business from is beyond me althoughfor conversation sakeisnt that littlefingers plan to reveal her identity to everyone so that the knights of the vale will fight to win back her birthright maybe your question about why the vale lords would fight for sansa should be directed to him hell thats his ideaâ â also i disagree sansa doesnt know what lf wants hell no one knows what he wants which is why we have copious amounts of topics discussing it futhermore i would consider it a step up for her character to take her own damn destiny into her hands by revealing her own identity rather than sit around and trust lfor anyone elseto keep her safe i would have thought that as a sansa fan youd prefer that outcome rather than a perpetual damsel in distress characterization i dont know maybe some people are fine with sansa sitting around looking pretty and playing stupid but im not let her be a proactive player in her own life rather than a reactive participant to everyone else"

"Annara Snow",2014-05-28,"â why would the vale lords support sansa and not turn her into the lannisters well we should probably begin with the fact that the vale lords think it was the lannisters who killed jon arryn so you know theres that add onto that the fact that ned stark and robert baratheon were known and liked in the vale when they were jon arryns wards theres also the fact that the knights of the vale wereare angry that lysa did not assist robb in his war which indicates to me a loyalty to the stark family and im fairly certain the vale lords and knights wouldnt be entirely comfortably with forking her over so easily also werent bronze royce and ned stark really good friends i think i recall reading that whypray tell would ned starks homeboy hand over his daughter to the lannisters or let anyone else do it for that matterâ â he visited winterfell once that hardly makes him ned stark homeboy the knight of the vale may have thought lysa should assist robb and her father and brother in the war but robb is dead and edmure is a prisoner and there is no stark or tully army now to assist the north is in the hands of the boltons and the riverlands are in the hands of the freys all lannister allies and the vale lords arent from the north they arent stark bannermen and experience has shown that even your own bannermen cant be trusted heck even your own family cant be trusted as sansa has come to know and even if some like bronze yohn could be trusted though i dont know why sansa would trust someone shes seen once in her entire life they are hardly a monolith its not like some other vale lord couldnt betray her plus it would be naive to think that there are no spies around varys for starters and no one who would try to betray her to the crown for gold or some other reason â â and who said anything about anyone going to war i personally didnt mention anything about anyone going to war for sansa im only talking about her revealing her true identity where you got this war business from is beyond me â uh the lannisters would because they wouldnt react well to sansa stark a traitor wanted for the murder of king joffrey being in the vale under the protection of the vale lords an information like that cant remain hidden â â althoughfor conversation sakeisnt that littlefingers plan to reveal her identity to everyone so that the knights of the vale will fight to win back her birthright maybe your question about why the vale lords would fight for sansa should be directed to him hell thats his idea â no littlefingers idea is that she should betroth and be about to marry harry future lord of the vale ie lord of the vale when sr dies since lfs plan includes sr dying before sansas marriage  which would mean that the knights of the vale would fight to win the birthright of the future lady of the vale for the benefit of the future son and heir to the house of arryn that she will be expected to give birth to that would give the vale lords an interest in the matter why else does lfs plan include sansa marrying harry why doesnt he just tell her she will reveal her identity and everyone would fight to win back her birthright also lfs plans is supposed to come to fruition in future at a time when the lannisters are considerably weakened which has been gradually happening with tywins death andâ cerseis fuckups  and lf is monitoring that situation he has his spies near cersei thats not the case at this point with tywin still very much alive â and even thats if we assume that lf is telling the truth to sansa and that he really expects the vale lords to be ready to go to war the moment they learn that â â also i disagree sansa doesnt know what lf wants hell no one knows what he wants which is why we have copious amounts of topics discussing it â nah we have a pretty good idea about some of the things he wants as does sansa he wants to fuck her for one thing and fulfill his fantasy about her as both cat replacement and his and cats imaginary daughter but he wants her to accept him and want him which is why hes trying to groom her so he wont outright rape her he also wants to use sansa as a political pawn in his own schemes and power grabs we dont know the details but we  and sansa  know that his plans and desires both political and personalsexual depend on sansa staying alive and not being sent to kl to lose her head â â futhermore i would consider it a step up for her character to take her own damn destiny into her hands by revealing her own identity rather than sit around and trust lfor anyone elseto keep her safe i would have thought that as a sansa fan youd prefer that outcome rather than a perpetual damsel in distress characterization â as a sansa fan i dont know what a sansa fan is i want her to take her own damn destiny into her hands but certainly not by revealing her own identity at this point since that would mean she is either an idiot or suicidal and as a sansa fan as opposed to a sansa fan i know shes neither not being an idiot who gets oneself killed  being a perpetual damsel in distress playing stupid is a her best way to stay alive and manipulate people  although the show doesnt seem to understand that since every schemer in the show is practically announcing in every scene look at me im dangerous im a player im manipulating people look at how cool i am it makes you wonder how littlefinger or margaery are ever able to fool anyone at least sansa has escaped that fate so far â â i dont know maybe some people are fine with sansa sitting around looking pretty and playing stupid but im not let her be a proactive player in her own life rather than a reactive participant to everyone else â you sound like one of those people who think that sansa was weak and stupid for not telling off joffrey and cersei or for not fighting her way out of kings landing you must really dislike sansa and be frustrated with her behavior in the books since she is not revealing herself to the

"Arkash",2014-05-30,"i think itll get knocked off wasnt there a shot of the mountain with a helm at the beginning of the duel i agree stuff like that is frustrating i mean why give the hound a really cool helm that we never see but thats just one of those things that might work in a book but on tv less so â â â i think the mountain will take it off during the duel oberyn dances around him and i can totally see the mountain removing angrily his helmet to keep him in sight â â i love the new sansa picture and her testimony at littlefingers trial is one of the many things im really looking forward this episode i feel like well finally see a sansa we all want to see and sophie can definitly pull her off "

"Nick_Scryer",2014-05-30,"this is an interesting interview from the director two things near the end really have me excited because of who oberyn the red viper is and as portrayed by so perfectly by pedro he has a real level of style and finesse that obviously nobody on â<U+0080><U+009C>game of thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D> has in wielding weapons i mean its usually â<U+0080><U+009C>cut rip killâ<U+0080><U+009D> and you got the hound you bump into the hound at the grocery store and its like â<U+0080><U+009C>youre deadâ<U+0080><U+009D> so i thought it should have a very elegant slick style especially because of the way it ends it would set up a contrast what ever the end is its going to be brutal so thats good one of my favorite scenes actually and sophie turner really came into her own and is so wonderful in it is the scene with littlefinger its the â<U+0080><U+009C>trial of littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+009D> as we called it that scene is brilliant and shes incredible they all are but thats the beginning of a big storyline and especially with sophie pulling off the shell game of the trial i think were going to get some great sansa stuff httpwwwibtimescterview1592009 â oh damn now im majorly excited"
"Here Shaggydog",2014-05-30,"yeah im just wondering who they can encounter for sandor to get mortally wounded rorge and biter are dead as well as polliver and his goons who else could they run into the mountain clans that would be kind of repetitive though unless his wound from biter gets infected all these changes are going to have a butterfly effect like for brienne no fight with rorge and biter shagwell pyg and timeon were never introduced if i remember correctly who else is there for brienne and pod to encounter now her story is moving really fast any thoughts"

"Annara Snow",2014-06-01,"â i think heresâ â where youre wrong â even without a image attached people form pictures in their own head and a character whos described as beautiful will cause the reader to associate the character with being attractive in their head and that will often lead to some readers liking them more â now i am not saying that the only reason people like sansa is because shes described as pretty its certainly helps her popularity though but i also think one of the reasons so many people like jaime is because hes described as very handsome i dont think this is exclusive to sansa â i dont think jaime would have nearly as many fans if his appearance were described to be similar to chett â why do so many people book readers love tyrion then he is more popular than jaime or at least was before adwd not sure how exactly it stands now you also get lots of people having hots for characters who are explicitly described as uglydisfigured sandor or plainlookingnot beautiful asha  and you even get some amusingly far too goodlooking fan art and people who imagined these characters as more attractive than theyre supposed to be while reading the books â id be willing to bet that there are people who are less likely to like a character if they are described as beautiful it certainly seems like that with many sansa haters who have pegged her as some sort of a cheerleader stereotype that they hated in high school and cant let go off it and im pretty sure that there are lots of people who love tyrion or quentyn among other reasons because they are not supposed to be attractive judging by the amount of nice guy â<U+0099> arguments where they rant against attractive female characters for not falling at the knees of their favorite male characters and being overjoyed to fuckmarry them even if they had zero reasons to do so even if we disregard the physical attractiveness aspect again an example of people throwing logic out of the window and somehow managing to read high school romcom popular pretty girl must fall for the unattractive nerd guy or else shes a bitch stereotypes where it doesnt belong edited by annara snow 01 june 2014  0811 am"

"Newstar",2014-06-01,"i agree that mccann wasnt especially good early on though the hound himself was barely there to begin with which just goes back to the writing they had all of two scenes plus that one deleted scene and no real story foundationâ thats a writing issue 100 â i have to disagree lack of story foundation or lack of number of scenes together does not excuse poor acting watch charles dance and diana rigg tearing into each other in that not terribly well written and kind of random scene in season 3 where theyre facing off over loras and cersei for an exemplar theyd had no scenes together before and none since except group scenes but the scenequestionable writing asidepops now you might say its not fair to compare sophie turner to them but id say theyre an excellent example for how poor writing is no excuse for actors letting their scenes fall flat as sophie turners scenes with rory mccann did â â â mccann not coincidentally started to improve when they actually started to give the hound meaningful dialogue â dialogue had nothing to do with it that chickens bit was unworthy of tarantino let alone shakespeare the difference was swapping out sophie turner with an actress who could draw a decent performance out of him â â â i think sophie is consistently one of the shows stronger performers â disagree she has her moments but she can also fall dreadfully flat especially without a decent screen partner to act against i often get frustrated with her because theres just nothing there â â â particularly as her character has struggled with weak writing so much of the time â not really an excuse as i said all the characters in the show get weak writing here and there sophie turners hardly special in that regard the better actors are able to sell weak writing the best actors can make that weak writing sound like the most eloquent words ever put to paper sophie turner doesnt fall into either category â â â the idea that the only difference is her scene partners is silly â sophie turner has benefited from strong scene partners who force her to raise her acting game the actress admitted as much in a recent interview saying she didnt like her performance in season 1 but that being around certain actors helped her acting improve i think she has improved since season 1 although id characterize that improvement as less from good to great and more from mediocre to mostly serviceable â â â even in this season where the writing for the character has improved from the season 3 nadir where half the time you could see turner trying to add nuance to a character being written as a onedimensional dumb joke â id disagree with both these statements the writing for the character didnt hit a nadir in season 3 and there was very little in sophie turners performance to suggest a concerted attempt to add nuance she may have been trying to do so as indicated by interviews where she insisted that sansas scared dumb child act was just a facade but that didnt come across in her performance intent  execution â â â shes pretty much singlehandedly holding up the characters scenes with littlefinger â again disagree although aiden gillens acting does him no favours either theres very little thats impressive about the acting at the eyrie and im concerned about the lack of strong screen partners now that sansa is in the same position as dany and jon in terms of holding up her own storyline i guess well see but im not particularly reassured edited by newstar 01 june 2014  1118 am"

"Lee-Sensei",2014-06-01,"why would the vale lords support sansa and not turn her into the lannisters well we should probably begin with the fact that the vale lords think it was the lannisters who killed jon arryn so you know theres that add onto that the fact that ned stark and robert baratheon were known and liked in the vale when they were jon arryns wards theres also the fact that the knights of the vale wereare angry that lysa did not assist robb in his war which indicates to me a loyalty to the stark family and im fairly certain the vale lords and knights wouldnt be entirely comfortably with forking her over so easily also werent bronze royce and ned stark really good friends i think i recall reading that whypray tell would ned starks homeboy hand over his daughter to the lannisters or let anyone else do it for that matterâ â and who said anything about anyone going to war i personally didnt mention anything about anyone going to war for sansa im only talking about her revealing her true identity where you got this war business from is beyond me althoughfor conversation sakeisnt that littlefingers plan to reveal her identity to everyone so that the knights of the vale will fight to win back her birthright maybe your question about why the vale lords would fight for sansa should be directed to him hell thats his ideaâ â also i disagree sansa doesnt know what lf wants hell no one knows what he wants which is why we have copious amounts of topics discussing it futhermore i would consider it a step up for her character to take her own damn destiny into her hands by revealing her own identity rather than sit around and trust lfor anyone elseto keep her safe i would have thought that as a sansa fan youd prefer that outcome rather than a perpetual damsel in distress characterization i dont know maybe some people are fine with sansa sitting around looking pretty and playing stupid but im not let her be a proactive player in her own life rather than a reactive participant to everyone else this again â 1 some of the vale lords wanted to ally with the starks to fight the lannisters â 2 lfs probably telling sansa what she wants to hear edited by leesensei 01 june 2014  1049 pm"
"Annara Snow",2014-06-02,"i agree on sansa hound dynamic i didnt like the cut scene at all although i think its very similar to what the book is like which brings us to why didnt film it with the semiromantic overtones there is no way to shoot it without having pedo overtones which would have irrevocably sullied the hound you can do it with lf because he is a villain but if you did it with the hound the arya wouldnt be the same the scene was not similar to the book it has a few similar lines to the book but they are completely taken out of context and have lost all meaning in the book sansa has come back from a meeting with dontos sandor holds her when she is wobbly at the stairs and figures immediately that shes lying about where shes been shes scared not of him but of being caught meeting a guy who is offering to help her escape sandor makes it clear that he knows she is lying and tells her she is a bad liar in that line that they decided to give to lf but then he covers for her in front of boros blount he also mocks her love of songs about chivalry and true knights but says pretending to be joking that he would like to hear her sing such a song for him he also tells her a meaningful story about the way his grandfather and his dogs saved lord tytos ending it with another great line a dog will die for you but never lie to you hes drunk in that scene and talks a lot and among the many things he says he makes a comment about her developing body but adds that shes still a stupid little bird even though she looks almost like a woman but i dont see why it would be impossible to write that scene decently for the show if you want to leave out any signs of physical attraction there is so much going on in that scene and their other interactions that doesnt necessarily have anything to do with romantic or sexual undertones like for starters the actors themselves talked about a beautiful empathetic relationship and that sandor was bullied and abused by his brother so he finds it hard to see her abused and bullied by joffrey so uh how about him telling her his story as he does in the books in the deleted scene however he just randomly comes up to her tells her joffrey is going to be raping her now as if she doesnt know that already and is just scaring her becausei dont know hes a weirdo creep i guess and yells her he would like her to sing for him which comes off as something completely random and lacks context since the show has completely cut all references to songs or true knights even lfs famous life is not a song line it all ends with tyrion as a good guy coming to sansas rescue from the bad hound and telling him off so no its not like the scene from the book at all if cogman wrote it then he is really awful at writing sandor and the sansasandor dynamic didnt he also write the fight with beric where sandor laughs instead of crying ill say one thing for the shows portrayal of sansan though surprisingly they had sandor practically tell sansa  in that scene where he was blowing her off  that he will kill joffrey to protect her if necessary you will be grateful for the hateful things i do one day when im all that stands between you and your beloved king  though im not sure if sansa registered that many of the viewers dont seem to have â â colonel green i am not the biggest fan of sophie turner i think she has one of the worst actress voices out there i find her extremely hard to listen too she is up there with melanie griffith and holly hunter in irritating voices for me â but even i have to agree she has come into her own in particular this season i still dont much care for her character but i would really like to see a scene between her and the hound now i think they could pull it off now â well maybe they could have pulled it off back then too if they had some meaningful decently written scenes with more than a couple of lines of dialogue there was one  the blackwater one which was good in the context of what their relationship was in the show and that was a good scene the way it was written shot and acted i loved sophies acting in it in particular its hard for actors to have chemistry or to see if they have chemistry if most of their scenesâ consist of stand there look at each other in a weirdawkward way say nothing edited by annara snow 02 june 2014  0818 am"
"Zorn Gottes",2014-06-02,"i have to disagree lack of story foundation or lack of number of scenes together does not excuse poor acting watch charles dance and diana rigg tearing into each other in that not terribly well written and kind of random scene in season 3 where theyre facing off over loras and cersei for an exemplar theyd had no scenes together before and none since except group scenes but the scenequestionable writing asidepops now you might say its not fair to compare sophie turner to them but id say theyre an excellent example for how poor writing is no excuse for actors letting their scenes fall flat as sophie turners scenes with rory mccann did in fact i think its an unfair comparison olenna doesnt have much psychological depth and her interaction with tywin is certainly much easier to play than sansa and sandors scenes like tywin vs olenna allow a plain histrionic acting like diana riggs whereas sansa and sandors interaction walks on a very fine line and is much more challenging to put on screen it aint the same ballpark it aint the same league it aint even the same fuckin sport imo the lack of story foundation is indeed one of the problems how can you express such a subtle connection when the characters happen to meet like twice and just seem to talk randomly about things which dont have any backstory edited by zorn gottes 02 june 2014  0158 pm"
