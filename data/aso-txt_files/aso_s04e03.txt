1	Ran	2014-04-20	Non-spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who've not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion, taking each episode as it comes.This topic should open automatically when the show begins airing.
2	AryaSansa	2014-04-21	Overall, was decent.Â  Didn't like Hound stealing, or how Danaerys' loverboy killed the champion.
Â 
Didn't like how they were suddenly in fog, when Sansa escaped.
Â 
Loved Tywin's talk, as well as Shireen though.
Â 
So when is Stannis going to the wall?Â  It seemed pretty urgent, but Stannis is taking his sweet time.
Â 
Oh, I think the entire Danaeyrs plot should be in Valyrian 
Â 
Predictions:
Â 
Littlefinger will take Sansa to Braavos, where she will meet Arya.Â  Sam will make out with Gilly, I hope they show the nude scene for that 
Â 
Also, Tyrion will somehow survive his ordeal - he's too popular a character to die 
Â 
And when is Yara going to rescue Theon?Â  Some plot lines are taking too long!Â
3	Raffi lannister	2014-05-08	i hate the jaimie cercei thing
Â 
Â 
but after that it was a good episode
4	Ran	2014-04-06	Have at it!

5	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-20	A strong 8 until Daenerys.
Dropped to a 6.
6	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-20	Seven seems fair for this ok episode.
7	Bloodhair Petyr	2014-04-20	I think that was the best Daenerys scene since drogon rosting the astapori guy
overall was good, sam was super boring, so 9
8	WTFSalami	2014-04-20	9.
That last speech was epic. The command that Clarke has over that language is so got damn hot.
9	tito5601	2014-04-20	i liked the wildling attack and littlefingers accent changed, its creepier noww an 8 for me
10	Lord Godric	2014-04-20	This episode to me really was on par with last week (which to me was good but not great) it just lacked the ending. Â Joffrey's death is a lot better than a flat Dany ending. 7/10.Â
11	KalibakCruel	2014-04-20	Besides the Sam scenes, I liked the episode. Dany didn't bore me to tears like usual. I thought they set up things pretty well.
Minuses go to the Jaime portrayal, that was just bad and to the champion fight. Anti climatic as hell.
Also new Daario still sucks imo, and they had a chance to show off some moves and they had him go with the cop out shot instead.
Will have to rewatch before I give a grade though.
12	DreamSongs	2014-04-20	This was one a the few times I was actually happy to see Dany and Mereen. Â Emilia Clarke did a fabulous job.
Â 
Tywin, as always, was a show stealer.
Â 
What I really hated was the suggestiveness that the sex in the sept was less than consensual.

13	FNF	2014-04-20	Seven seems fair. It's a transition episode so I wasn't really expecting anything, but I feel like the ending could have been waaaay better. It just fell flat on it's face.
14	Dany's Silver	2014-04-20	8/10 but that may change when I rewatch it.
Â 
I couldn't quite believe it was over so soon.
15	darksellsword	2014-04-20	I gave it a 9 I really liked this episode seemed so short obviously because I was enjoying it.My only pet pee-ve was wishing
Daario had of pissed on the Champion to make up for strong Belwas not taking a shit. I think it was a bit of a cop out to be honest.
16	Fez	2014-04-20	8/10
Â 
It was a solid episode throughout, but not much stood out as outstanding either. I didn't much like Sam's scenes, but that's about it for my complaints.*
Â 
Â 
*Except one. I don't usually have any issues with the show's production designs, but it looked embarrassingly warm and sunny during the wilding raid. What happened to winter? If it weren't the Starks' words, viewers could be forgiven for thinking winter already came and went and now its early summer.
17	C0bR	2014-04-20	7/10, too much D&D butchery to my liking

18	boojam	2014-04-20	A strong 9 until Dany.Then a 10!Emilia can really nail it when she is speaking High Valyrian.She was excellent this episode.I thought all the dialog was unformly better written this episode

19	Zman1863	2014-04-20	There were some good scenes, but there were also some bad ones. That Jaime/Cersei scene was horrible and made no sense. They are too set in their characterizations. Cersei and Tyrion get consistently lightened as characters, but when Jaime goes through an actual in book transition, they are resistant to following through with it.Â
20	libertine	2014-04-20	This one was a 9 for me. Tyrion & Pod, Tywin & Tommen, Tywin & Oberyn, Littlefinger & Sansa all were really great scenes. I also liked the ending, although the fight could have been a little more entertaining. But nevermind, it shows that Daario is super badass. Sam's scenes sucked a little though.
21	TheHouseHB	2014-04-20	A 10. Best episode of the season.Â
22	Shitmouth the Wise	2014-04-20	Very good episode considering nothing really big happened.
23	Ran	2014-04-20	8. I looked back over my votes for the first three episodes over the previous seasons, and this one has had the best results from me (yes, even outdoing season 1 -- Lord Snow got a 7), so kudos to them for a solid start. Reviewed it in more detail here, where I think it's fair to say that it's actually a fairly elegantly written episode. I'm a sucker for stories with a strong thematic through-line, though.
24	Darth Pipes	2014-04-20	8/10.Â  A solid episode although not even close to the last two.Â  At times it felt like the more exposition-heavy episodes of Season 1.Â  But definitely a number of good scenes...I liked Tywin/Tommen a lot for instance.
25	Montey14	2014-04-20	They Twin/OberynÂ  scene was the best of the episode.....the Sam scenes were blahhhh.....I would have liked to have seen the scene where Littlefinger tells Sansa about the true poisner of Geoffry....Aria scenes were also very blehhhh.....and too bad they cut out the big Eunich....
26	RenlyTheOneTrueKing	2014-04-20	7
I must be like the ONLY one who likes Sam
Liked the new Daario, except for when he peed
Littlefinger is so pervy, but that's awesome
Dany was good, Jon was good
Not a fan of the Jamie/Cersei scene
Oberyn still comes off as Meh to me
Tywin is beast as per ush
It looks like Margaery didn't know of the plot and Olenna is awesomely Awesome
Davos is too good for Stannis (even though I totally ship them)
Also, yay Shireen in another episode!
Tommen is better like this for me
Laughed at Aryas "you're the biggest ****" to the Hound
Used to love Arya series 1, hated her 2+3, now love her again, strange
I love Pod, and liked Tyrions wittiness
Wildling attack was Amazing, still love Tormund
I think that's pretty much the episode, haha

Â 


Yeah, the Sam scenes. Â The second one wasn't so bad, but the first one was hard to get through.
28	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-20	I thought it was awesome. Enjoyed it more than episode 2 actually. I feel like they've finally figured out how to accurately pace each episode. If the rest of the episodes are like the first three this season will turn out to be the best by far. 
					
					
							Edited by TheWhiteRabbit, 20 April 2014 - 09:20 PM.
29	Baltan	2014-04-20	A 9, I really cracked at Arya and the Hound scene with the stew.
Â 
I actually found myself asking what had Davos figured out, couldn't relate the Bank of Braavos loan that early in the story.
Â 
I'm not sold into the Gilly in Mole Town story, but well, she can't be around in the Battle of Castle Black.
Â 
New Daario is ok, but not super cool like Daario should be. Total hottie either way.
Â 
Olenna and Tywin were superb, specially Papa Lannister educating Tommen over a yet not so cold Joffrey corpse.
Â 

*Except one. I don't usually have any issues with the show's production designs, but it looked embarrassingly warm and sunny during the wilding raid. What happened to winter?

Â 
Where I live, in winter, if we have a polar wave, the polar winds clear up the sky. Those sunny days are usually the coldest ones.

30	Widows_Blood	2014-04-20	I gave it an 8. Only thing I didn't like was the Sept scene and I could have gone without the Sam/Gilly stuff.Â
31	Widows_Blood	2014-04-20	Also, I think the pacing is the best its ever been. The writing seems to be more confident and everything just flows seamlessly. Usually the first few episodes are the worst, so the fact that I have really enjoyed the episodes thus far should mean good things for later in the season.Â
32	boojam	2014-04-20	Ran, man!, our perceptions of Dany sure differ.I mean in the books, George made her a Juggernaut until Dance.I don't agree with the analysis.
33	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-20	7/10. The best scene by far was Tywin quizzing Tommen -- THAT is the right kind of deviation. It perfectly established the kind of thoughtful, positive counterpart Tommen will be to Joff, and Dance killed it as usual. Excellent scene.
Â 
Shame it was followed by, uh, that.

34	Batavian	2014-04-20	I gave it a 5 mainly for the silliness in front of Meereen.
35	Ran	2014-04-20	boojam,Eh? Juggernaut? She's stuck besieging the place for a good long stretch, almost gets killed, and discovers one of her most trusted advisors has been selling her out. She's not that much of a juggernaut in ASoS.
36	Bonifer Tasty	2014-04-20	I liked the Cersei/Jaime scene in teh sept, but it was definitely creepy. Â Was really excited to see Sansa reunite with Littlefinger, but the scene ended up flat for me...not sure why. Â And why did he throw the necklace into the boat with Dontos? Â Doesn't Sansa still have the hairnet in the book - seems like that could be important! Â  I really thought Margaery might be in on the poisoning, but this made it seem like she didn't know at all. Â Sam scenes WERE boring...we know, you LOVE her, just get on with it. Â  Also not sure I'm going to like the trip up to rout out the Craster rebels...seems unnecessarily risky! Â I gave it a six, maybe I should change it to a seven.
37	shiola	2014-04-20	I give it a 6 until I re-watch it. Â The dialogue wasn't engaging in most of the scenes. Â A lot of the acting felt kind of off. Â The way Jaime was handled really, really bothered me. Â New Daario just doesn't work for me so far. Â Margaery not being involved in the murder was disappointing to me.
Â 
The good things: Seeing Grenn again. Â The episode actually managing to shock me with the scene of the wildling massacre. Â The Hound/Arya are a pleasure to watch. Â Cersei in the very beginning of the episode was good.
Â 
ETA: Was gonna give it a 5, but I bumped it up to a 6 for Shireen<3

38	Sir Dominus	2014-04-20	Solid 8 from me
39	shiola	2014-04-20	Forgot to mention that I hate, with every inch of my being, the TV version of Littlefinger. Â I can hardly stomach his stupid, skeevy, breathy voice. Â To me, there's nothing compelling or interesting or intelligent about him at all.
40	Ser Creighton	2014-04-20	6, it was ok, nothing stood out, except I felt the acting was a bit over the top all around. It felt more melodramatic than dramatic to me. Oberyn keeps doing the same thing, raise chin, stare, cock head to the side a bit make a quip. Not really sure if that was Stannis panic but he never seems to have the answer to anything. Dink is pushing his accent to hard, it's like he is speaking to children all the time. Sort of incest rape, a lot of Sam not doing much, a little of Jon being broody but not much else. The Wildlings, I am going to eat mommy and daddy, yes I know your so bad and scary, you can't act but so scary, really. Oh god and little finger elongating every word he could. Speaking of bad acting Tywin and Tommen what was that? It was like some dark version of school house rocks. Arya and the hound came off almost like a comedy schtick to me, meet the Odd couple. I thought the gate to Meereen was the best part in terms of production and melodrama, Dany has always been a bit melodramatic, so fit right in with her.
Drama or Soap Opera can be a fine line at times, I don't think D&D would know a fine line if they tripped over it, probably hit it with a sledge hammer like most things if they did. I don't mind the changes, or anything, just thought the acting, themes, and plot were a bit off tonight, and I didn't find much interesting in the episode.

Ellaria Sand probably bothers me the most. Â Her acting is like something from a bad telenovela. Â JMO.
42	ohpooratlas	2014-04-20	Was kind of a flat episode for me until the siege of Meereen.Â That brought it up to a 7 forÂ me.
Â 
Episode needed more creepy Littlefinger.
43	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-20	8.. on par with the last few weeks and pacing was good, felt it ramping up to the ending bits..
Â 
Tyrion/Pod
2nd half of Arya/Sandor
Night's Watch stuff (Sam/Gilly felt like it dragged along but what can ya do)
Tywin/Tommen conversation - very Socrates'esque as a friend of mine pointed out.
Mereen - just the scope of it felt very grand compared to seasons past and I enjoyed that despite my not being the biggest fan of that story
Edit; How could I forget Dontos/Sansa/LF - seems we'll get more into the 'necklace' next week.
Â 
All highlights for me..
Â 
Will save the cons for nitpicking thread..

44	Gannicus	2014-04-20	Mediocre episode
Â 
Some good moments..
Â 
-The Tywin/Tommen scene worked
-Sansa/LF was executed well
-Tyrion/Pod was nice
-Kit Harrington has learned how to act
Â 
Some bad moments...
Â 
-Jaime/Cersei WTF, either that scene was misdirected or misacted because I doubt they were trying to do a rape scene
-Sam and Gilly will continue to bore us to tears for many an episode I'm sure
-How many Dornish pornos are needed before we get that Oberyn is a passionate bisexual man.
Â 
...and of course we need to be subjected to another insufferable Dany badass scene(well acted though) while Stannis tells Davos he's running out of time.

But you gave it a 6?
46	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-20	I really liked this episode. There was a few cheesy parts, like when Grey Worm, Mormont, and Barristem all took turns asking to fight the lone warrier, and then each took on a puppydog face when Dany turned them down. But overall, great episode, and I'll have to watch it again to be sure, but it might be my favorite of the 3 so far...
47	chicagostatecougars	2014-04-20	5. It was aight.
48	ServantOnIce	2014-04-20	7/10 Â Â 
Â 
1. Sex scene with Oberyn was too long
Â 
2. I loved the Thenns scene, but it was too, "Lord of the Ringish" and doesn't fit into ASOIAF/GOT
Â 
3. The Duel scene was great . . . Â  but I miss Strong Belwas . . . Â  Â 
Â 
4. Everything else was solid, except for Sam sending Gilly to a filthy brothel to raise a kid. Â Dumb Sam!
49	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-20	I'm torn. Most of the episode deserves a 9 or me... but Jaime turning into a rapist does not. I don't know how I'll reconcile the two and rate this one. I might have to see how they handle it in interviews and in next week's episode because apparently they didn't mean for it to come across the way it really, really did.
50	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-04-20	4. Weakest episode in the entire series.
51	chicagostatecougars	2014-04-20	Jaime scene was disturbing as hell. I imagined it as more consensual than that. To me it was a powerful scene in the novel, one of the most memorable. But the depiction from the show was disturbing as fuck.
52	lil_z	2014-04-20	Loved this episode, thought I might be biased as a book reader. I LOVED Daenerys scene, this episode held a lot of promise and setup for next episide.
Â 
There are many who seem disappoitned, but you need these episodes to both save budget, and to build up to the next episode. Seems we have impending Wildings attack. Sir Davros is hatching a plan we don't know what yet. Tywin and Oberyn are working togethers (though uneasy) and Meeren, Sansa has found her way off of Kings Landing finally shows the tension of who the slaves will react to The Queens speech and show.
Â 
In context this was a fantastic epidsode, call it the cliff hanger before the climax of several plots.

That last speech was epic. The command that Clarke has over that language is so got damn hot.Agreed. I gave it an 8. Loved cocky Daario vs Meereen's champion. Kissing one of his "ladies" was a nice touch. The rest of the episode was just ok, but the ending was great.

56	YourMomsBox	2014-04-20	Hmm I thought it was the best episode of the three. Last weeks was a bit disappointing just because I expected a little more from it.
There was a couple of things that I didn't like however. Primarily the Jaime/Cersei scene. Jaime is one of my favorite characters and he has been in the process of a very good redemption arc since last season. I was slightly distracted during that scene but it seemed like he pretty much raped Cersei. Was that in the books? I can't recall.
And yeah the Sam scenes were boring but the storyline w/Gilly never interested me to begin with so I didn't expect much. I can't think of anything else that I disliked to be honest. The Arya/Hound scenes tend to have some lines that really crack me up. 
Everything else was pretty good in my opinion. I think Ser Creighton, your getting much too critical about the episode. It's a TV show and not everything can be perfect. I don't see how LF and Tyrion's voices/accents are an issue at all. The wildlings should be presented in a somewhat darker light. I'd agree that the whole cannibal thing isn't necessary but attacking that village the way they did felt kinda fitting. Makes them actually feel threatening to some likeable characters from the NW (Jon/Sam/Pyp/Ed etc). 
I don't know how the Tommen/Tywin scene was terribly acted...at all. I liked that Tywin basically admitted that Joff was a crap ruler and the part about 'strength' not being the most important characteristic of a ruler.
Good episode, a solid 8.

59	goddessoftitsandwine	2014-04-20	8 overall.
Â 
The Jaime/Cersei scene gets a pitiful 1 from me, in terms of adaptation, character development, and for adding unnecessary rape into a show overloaded with violence against women. Â 
Â 
On the other hand, I really loved Sansa's escape. Â I've never been a fan of Aidan Gillen's acting, but the scene was still beautifully shot. Â I also loved Dany's final 10 minutes. Â I don't get the hate for her, I think that was awesome.Â
60	IvanStark	2014-04-20	without Dany scene it would be 5, with her I raised to 6
Â 
Sam scenes really killed the episode for me. I don't know what will happen with him and this baby, but instead of all the other interesting characters we would like to see and feel (Bran, Jon, Rickon, more Martells...) we get 10 minutes of borring Sam and Gily. 
Â 
I hate how they represented Jaime, while we are starting to like him in the book show is representing him as a total jerk, that even Cercei seems likable in comparison to him.
Â 
Sansa and Littlefinger scene could be even more epic in my opinion.
Â 
Arya and Hound were interesting but still waste of time.
Â 
Wildlings scene was great.
Â 
Tywin nailed it in both scenes, especially with Oberyn. "Categorically" was perfect!
Tommen scene was also good. I am starting to like Tommen!
Â 
New Daario was finaly likeable (and it could be more stylish without pissing), I see here that some peple disliked short "fight", but for me it was perfect, that pain in the ass on the horse is theatrically preparing as he will do a heroic thing and before everything starts he is down  I was so excited!
Â 
Waiting for more!

Before I rate the episode, because my screen isn't in the best conditions... I have to ask: did we see Oberyn's ass? That might get the episode a few more points.

I think that a good birthday present for the Hound, would be the Emily Post Etiquette Handbook.
64	Jslay427	2014-04-20	To the farmer the Hound robs- LF is Lord Paramount of the RL now so you can't blame raiders on Walder Frey.
65	Ser Creighton	2014-04-20	But you gave it a 6?

Yeah I gave it a 6, was going to be a 5, but being under the weather and probably more critical than normal I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave it a 6. Look I thought it was mediocre, but there are far worse things out there than that. You ever see into the Blue or any of those fast five movies? Those are like 2's and 3's, this was better than that by a bit, so 5 or 6.

67	Ser Creighton	2014-04-20	Before I rate the episode, because my screen isn't in the best conditions... I have to ask: did we see Oberyn's ass? That might get the episode a few more points.

Nope he had pants on while having sex.
68	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	Nope he had pants on while having sex.


Â 
I HATE HBO!!!!
Â 
THIS IS WORST THAT THE STANNIS BUTCHERY JAMES RAPERY TYRION WHITEWHASHERY CERSEI VICTIMIZATION!
Â 
I give the episode a 5.
Â 
Wait, I already voted.

Â 
I doubt he signed on to that sort of thing, or I'm sure we would have seen it by now. Brb, getting pitch forks for HBO riot.Â

Â 
Overall it was a decent episode, however I find it completely ridiculous how new Tommen has been shoehorned in so fast. I can only imagine how utterly random it must seem to a lot of non-readers. I actually liked his coversation with Tywin, and unlike some of the show's other casting screw ups (e.g. Ramsay) the actor isn't necessarily wrong for the role,.. I just think the timing of the change is so off that it's tantamount to inventing a new Stark child and giving them an important role in the next episode like they've been there the whole time.
Â 
And yet again I found myself rolling my eyes at their portrayal of Daenerys. They seem to be trying to re-create the same scene over and over again with a show of power followed by the cheesy delivery of a Valyrian word.

Â 
Well, when would have been a good place to insert him? The last time we saw Tommen before the Purple Wedding was the Battle of the Blackwater.
72	Corvinus	2014-04-20	Sansa's escape = 8 - what was up with Littlefinger's accent?
Margaery & Olenna = 6 - not a bad scene, but nothing special either
The Sept of Baelor = 10 - between Tywin immediately taking Tommen under his wing and the one sex scene that was not gratuitous, this was excellent
Arya & The Hound = 10 - great chemistry between the two
Sam & Gilly = 6 Â - more awkwardness from Sam, but interesting setup with Mole's Town
Dragonstone = 7 - started with more Stannis butchery but he did say one line the real Stannis would have said (the pantry line, not the history book line) + Shireen continues to impress and +1 for Monty Python reference
The Brothel = 1 - seems the Red Viper is getting the Stannis treatment from the writers; at least they finally touched on his poison knowledge; still no mention of his nickname
Tyrion & Pod = 10 - very touching and great acting
The Wildling Attack = 6 - the cannibalism is going a bit too far, but a fairly good action scene
Castle Black = 9 - Other than reducing the NW's numbers much more than they should have, the rest of the scene was pretty good; Kit continues to impress this season
Daenerys = 7 - Meereen looks great; I was not too impressed with the duel (too short, and the whole positioning was a bit awkward); nice use of mangonels, though I hope they won't Â have the slaves do all the fighting
Average grade = 7.3/10, rounding down to 7 for the vote.
73	Belisarius09	2014-04-20	Liked this episode the least out of the first 3 so far.
Â 
Those Sam and Gilly scenes were numerous and boring...
74	Queen of Whores	2014-04-20	A strong 7. I would have given it an eight but for Stannis threatening to kill Davos, Jaime raping Cersei and the hero worship of Daenerys. The orgy was also dumb and unnecesary. We get it, Oberyn fucks guys as well. Big deal. Other than that, pretty good episode. My favourite of the three so far by a long margin. I really don't like the new Tommen, but his scene with Tywin was good, if only for the huge exposition dumps from Tywin that I loved. I really like that Jon and Alliser seem to have a grudging respect/appreciation for each others' decisions and knowledge. Also, was that Bowen Marsh that was naming all the brothers and said they should dump the wildlings from the Wall? Classic Bowen, if so.Â
75	Mr Smith	2014-04-20	7. It almost managed to pull itself up near the end, but not quite. Some absolutely outstanding scenes up against some very, very poor ones.
Â 
What I liked:
Tywin teaching Tommen about the virtues of Kings. Up there with my favourite scenes from this show ever.
Sam looking after Gilly. We didn't get to see much of this in the books, with the wildlings a lot closer to the Wall. Great character development.
Arya and the Hound. Excellent from start to finish. Endearing the Hound to us while reminding us what he truly is, and Maise Williams continues to kill it.
Tywin negotiating with Oberyn. Top draw stuff from both actors, and finally some good dialogue.
Â 
What I hated:
Jaime borderline rape of Cersei. How was that necessary, please someone explain that to me. Fuck.
Tyrion's selflessness. Why do D and D think the sun shines out of Tyrion's arsehole? Can't we get a little bit more of his dry sarcasm and mutterings of vengeance? (I did however think throwing suspicion onto Tywin was a nice touch)
Sansa's escape. Not only was it horribly rushed, but then we had to have Aiden Gillen and his stupid accent trampling over all of Sophie Turner's good work. He has utterly ruined that character.
Â 
Parting thoughts: the dialogue was much improved, but poor decision making by the creators regarding the development of critical characters damaged the scene. Episode remained solid overall.
76	DogLover	2014-04-20	Hated this episode so very much. Probably the worst one yet.
77	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-20	Better than the second episode, not as good as the premiere.
78	IlAovatar	2014-04-20	Â 
Well, when would have been a good place to insert him? The last time we saw Tommen before the Purple Wedding was the Battle of the Blackwater.


They should have forseen the age issue to begin with and picked someone as old as the other child actors to play Tommen right from the start. Or at the very least, they should have given us glimpses of a new Tommen last season. It just seems so forced and ridiculous how this random boy showed up magically only moments before Joffrey died, and now suddenly he's going to be king.

79	Seneti	2014-04-21	8 out of 10. Liked everything except for:
- the end of that scene between Jaime and Cersei (shame, because the beginning and middle were really good)
- Gilly being so mean to Sam
- no tokars - I was hoping for some seriously flamboyant, complicated dresses for the Meereenese and instead we got the same old master's garb
80	yushkevitch	2014-04-21	Overall it was fine, lots of buildup esp. with Tyrion.
Â 
But alas, no Strong Belwas. I'm still saddened by this.
81	TheGreenBell	2014-04-21	9. If it werent for tje Jaime-Cersei scene, i'd rate it 10.Â
82	TheEvilKing	2014-04-21	Gave it a 7. The Dragonstone scenes felt rushed. Jaime rape scene set his redemption arc back about 2 seasons, well done. Littlefinger's acting is worse than ever, it's hilarious though. I hated how they didn't explain the conspiracy properly like in the books, Unsullied are going to be so confused.
Â 
The rest was pretty solid, but the ending was a bit of an anti-climax, I thought we were going to see the slaves start killing the masters. It's like they just ran out of time.
83	Haymaker	2014-04-21	I would give it a 9.5/10 so rounded up to 10... Kinda suprised how varied the opinions are on this really good episode.Â  Didn't think any scene was too cheesy or fell flat.Â Â Â  Most were fantastic with exceptional dialog and acting imo.Â  Littlefigner/Sansa scene and dialog very much like I remember from the book and done well.Â  Pod/Tyrion, emotional ending and its always great to hear Tyrion try to put the pieces together; Tywin teaching Tomman while essentially taking him under his wing away from Cersei as quickly has he can; Jon Snow finally being a character I care about again, after the debacle of his story line the last two seasons (espcially s2).Â  The other scenes not mentioned provided some good setup for future episodes. The only scene that was meh to me was the 1st Sam/Gilly one.
Â 
Yes the Jaime and Cersei scene came off too rough unfortunately (espcially for non-book readers) but I think the intention was the same as the books (backed by a quote from the director of this episode here:
goo.gl/qSq8LV). So not getting my panties in a bunch over it.
84	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-21	7.Â  I really enjoyed Davos and Shireen, and even the Stannis and Davos scene.Â  Tywin and Tommen's scene was quite good.Â  Tywin and Oberyn was good; the scene that preceded it...we get it...Oberyn likes everything.
Â 
Sam's stuff seemed to drag a little, but I still love him and his "family".Â 
Â 
I hoped they'd let go of the man-flesh angle with the Thenns, but it seems that's not going to be the case.
Â 
I hope we'll see the Mountain next episode.
Â 
Pod was good this episode, but him taking Kevan's role irked me a bit.
Â 
Jon and Dany's arcs were ok.Â  Hope we get to see Bloodraven, Leaf, or Coldhands next episode.
85	Alboin	2014-04-21	I don't think I liked synopsis of the episode. Scenes alone are good, some are better then the others as usual, and its normal, but after KING"S DEATH I would expect to see more of an aftermath. Â Seeing Sam and Gilly running around Mole's town in such dramatic place of the story was just boring for me.Â
86	Eira Seren	2014-04-21	Gave it an 8.Â  Enjoyed the scene with Danaerys.Â  Was afraid the new Daario wouldn't be able to pull it off, but he acquitted himself rather well.
Â 
Thought the scene with Sam and Gilly worrying about the NW men got a bit drawn out, enjoyed the wildling fight and the Tywin scene.
Â 
Seems they thought Jamie was appearing too nice, so had to scuff him up a bit?Â  In the book it's usually Cersei who's behaving atrociously.
Â 
Littlefinger as icky as ever.
Â 
I almost got a little teary when Tyrion ordered Pod to leave KL.
Â 
ETA: They have got the Dornish right.

Â 
Yeah, I think some of us may have missed the consensual part, I definitely didn't see it.
88	Hoo	2014-04-21	Dialogue was great as usual.
Love that Jaime went for another child without hesitation.
Balish took the claim to North from Tywin. Â I am very interested to see what he has in mind as far as Tyrrion's trial. Â North is a mess, Castle Black can't call for troops? Â Rebellion was crushed but it is not? Just a weird story line.
I like Arya and the Hound, I just wish they would get to where ever they are going. Â There was no point in the scenes this episode, other than to say winter is coming, maybe.
Daenerys's story line has been meaningless for the last two seasons. Â  I like that they Â kept it to minimum and hope it stays that way.
89	Beric175	2014-04-21	I gave it an 8 because of the Jaime:Cersei scene not sitting all too well with me and because I do not yet see what they're setting up with Gilly. Other than that, superb acting and dialogue and the last scene made me feel that the new daario is a nice compromise between the one from episode 1 of this season and the one from last season. Keep writing him like that D&D, please. Lots of great speeches in the episode.
90	T.C	2014-04-21	5, worst of the season so farÂ
91	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	7.
This episode was pretty good but not spectacular. Nothing memorable.
Â 
Plus points - Tywin and Oberyn, Pod's farewell, Hound being smart, Wildling attack, Dany at the Gates.
Minus points - Sam scenes, should have shown more Cersei and Jaime, especially after the sex.
92	bluemoon	2014-04-21	This one was a 9 for me. Tyrion & Pod, Tywin & Tommen, Tywin & Oberyn, Littlefinger & Sansa all were really great scenes. I also liked the ending, although the fight could have been a little more entertaining. But nevermind, it shows that Daario is super badass. Sam's scenes sucked a little though.


Â 
^^ This
93	Sun	2014-04-21	A very good episode. For the first time since season 1 Dany and her storyline doesn't bore me to tears. or make me cringe with second hand embarrassment. I like the homage to Indiana Jones they did with Daario's champion fight. Â This episode gets an 8 for that miraculous feat alone.Â 
Â 
What's going on with Aidan Gillen? In every other show I see him in, and there are plenty, he delivers decent performances. Come to GOT and he's a prime roasted ham of the first order. What is going on? Also, LF in now Irish apparently?Â 
Â 
The Jaime/Cersie scene was a let down on many levels, least of them that it came off as borderline rape. The scene leaves very little room for interpretation but I can live with it, however I can not live with the timid and reticent acting, and the way the scene was blocked and directed was mediocre at best. It drew all the power away from what should have been a very emotionally powerful and cognitively controversial scene.
Â 
Â 
I'm editing this for the record:
Â 
I initially said above that it was borderline rape, but after rewatching the scene several time, noticing little things like Cersie pushing Jaime's face away from her as she sobs and says don't, I have changed my mind. It's not borderline rape, it is rape.
Â 
The reason I'm editing now is because frankly I'm getting sick of the show writers and director flip flopping on the issue. first saying rape then not, then rape, then not again. Â So I thought I should have it stated clearly what I think for the forum record, if there is such a thing.Â

94	scotcat	2014-04-21	Yeah, I think some of us may have missed the consensual part, I definitely didn't see it.
Same here. 
In the book, it was definitely consensual - now Jaime is a rapist (ok sleeping with your sister isn't exactly a badge of honour, but still). If the directors intention was to show she gave her consent he failed miserably. I don't know how this is anything other than character assassination in the part of D&D I'm afraid. (And I'm someone who has been supportive of these two on the whole).
As for the rest of the episode, it was solid enough. It wasn't on a par with the last two eps, but it did it's job. The whole scene in the sept just leaves a very bad after taste for the whole ep.

95	Aeva Demetre	2014-04-21	I feel the redeeming scenes included how masterfully they depicted Cersei feeling extremely threatened and almost trapped, Daario killing the 'champion' from Meereen and the Hound's rather accurate advice to Arya after stealing the farmer's silver.
Â 
Jaime and Cersei.. the rape scene.. I mean this woman is the only one mourning the loss of her child, and after listening to her father insult her dead child and display his powers of manipulation using her other son and effectively the ruler, she is raped by the only person she trusts and cares for otherwise.. right next to her dead son's corpse. I mean damn.
Â 
Daario was just plain awesome.. the way he stood there waiting after winking at Dany.. waiting.. lol thinking of the best way to kiss that knife, look sexy and glance at Dany at the same time.. then in two seconds he finishes off the arrogant 'champion'. Swag.
Â 
That bit where the Hound blew his nose was a bit gross haha, but he was on point with his later advice to Arya after stealing the silver. Weak people aren't going to survive, let alone through winter. I really began to like and pity the farmer and his little daughter; they were kind and trusting. It was difficult to hear the Hound's reasoning afterward, but it was so (distressingly) true. It felt like a necessary juxtaposition to have someone who has harnessed strength from past suffering and who has a greater likelihood of survival, and others who have good intentions but likely won't make it much further in a world full of strife.
Â 
The rest of the episode was pretty good, but these scenes stood out to me.

96	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-21	Jaime was upset over the rape of Elia and her children. He saved Brienne from rape at the expense of his hand. At one point he says that, if he were a woman, he would rather die than be raped.
Â 
In this episode he goes on to rape Cersei in the sept. There is no argument to be made here, by the way, because it was obviously rape. This undermines his character to start with, as well as the development that he's gone through since the second season.
Â 
Now I know how Stannis fans feel.
97	Ran	2014-04-21	200 votes in, average score of 7.24, median score of 8, normalized average (top/bottom 5% removed) of 7.37.
98	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	7
Â 
Some scenes were fantastic. Some were flat, and some really suffered from what were obviously time constraints
Â 
Fantastic
Tywin/Tommen/Cercei - really loved this scene. Tywin broke the chain Cersei thought she had on Tommen. And Tommen showed there is hope for the future
Tyrion/Pod - A really well paced scene from gifts to gradual ramping up of the bad news, the climactic 'Pod. This is goodbye.'
Tywin/Oberyn - brilliantly showed Tywin's sharp political mind and added depth to Oberyn and a shrewd operator.
Quite Good
Demonstration of Wildling threat
NW meeting at Castle Black showing their dilemma
Sam/Gilly at Moles Town
Meeree CGI, Dany's Valyrian and the bombardment
Neutral
Oberyn/Ellaria - meh, we get it
Baelish/Sansa - It just felt flat, possibly because I don't buy in to the TV Baelish.
Could Have Been Better
The dog and the wolf - started well but I thought it fell flat. Would rather have seen them stay there, so next time they could be attacked and have the opportunity for a discussion about the Gift of Mercy
Stannis/Davos - Clearly rushed. Actors racing through their lines to save time. Dramatic effect suffered
Davos/Shireen - Clearly rushed. Actors racing through lines etc - see above
Sansa/Dontos - Clearly rushed to save time. The image of her in the hood is truly beautiful and one I was looking forward to, but the whole escape taking barely a minute but moving from early afternoon to evening meant it lost so much.
Sam/Gilly at CB - I feel this would have been better played if there had been some actual menace displayed to Gilly and Sam was reacting to a clear and present danger. It is sweet they are trying to set up a romance but it just felt it missed the mark.
Champion of Meereen - I have no problems with the rapid take-down by Daario, but I just felt the scene construction was wrong - the angle the charge happened on, the position of Dany etc as it happened and whatnot.

99	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-21	+ Really like Tommen-Tywin scene
+ It still seemed clear to me that Cersei was only partly resisting
+ Show Alliser continues to kick ass and be just reasonable enough to be much more interesting
+ Jon Snow's arguments were sound
+ IN ITSELF these Dragonstones scene are cool
+ Dany was on fire
+ Tyrion is okay with Pod testifying against him, shows Shae will have to go the extra mile
+ No spoonfeeding us that Ygritte and Tormund are the "good" wildlings
+ Sam has real flaws
- Meereen fight was way too short
- Could do with less Oberyn sex

100	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-21	A half hearted 5. Some great parts, some really slow poorly done parts. Not up to the first two of the seasons standards.
101	Lord_Dustin	2014-04-21	8/10
Â 
Lena Headey is blowing me away with her portrayal of Cersei this season. Â The subtlety of her performance during the Tywin/Tommen exchange was captivating. Â I wonder whether the show is paving the way for Cersei to become more like her book counterpart. Â 
Â 
Is it just me or does Emilia Clarke's performance improve markedly when she starts speaking Valyrian? Â Her speech at the end was wonderful. Â I also enjoyed the 'twist' about the crates containing collars, although a reminder about the mile markers would not have gone amiss. Â Daario was perfect.
Â 
One of the thing that struck me about this episode was the lighting. Â Nothing short of spectacular. Â Especially the scenes featuring Sansa's escape, within the Great Sept of Baelor and the wildling assault. Â Although some of the directorial choices were peculiar at best.
Â 
As for the downsides: the Sam/Gilly scenes felt tedious although they did develop Sam's character. Â Similarly, I feel like I have seen the scenes with Arya and the Hound before. Â 
Â 
Going forward, I am really looking forward to the scenes at the Wall. Â I have never said that before, but Harington is doing a great job as Jon this season. Â The tension really is beginning to ramp up.
102	Lord of Winterhell	2014-04-21	Gave it an 8.
Â 
Mainly because Sam's scenes were really boring, as well as Marg/Olenna, and even tho I don't mind brothel scenes and understand why they must be in the show, this one was seemed absolutely useless to me. Oh and I also think Sansa's escape could've been handled better.
Â 
Everything else I found good or awesome.
Â 
Tywin/Tommen, Tywin/Oberyn, final Castle Black scene, and esp. Dany's scene was great. I don't get why people are calling this "flat". It was here best scene since Dracarys.
Â 
Anyway, Pyp won the episode: "I don't think I can kill a hundred wildlings"
103	direwoofwoof	2014-04-21	6. Not very exciting.  Glad to see Arya and Hound again. Wilding scene good. Great Dany speech and catapulting. Did not like or enjoy Sam/Gilly scene, Oberon scene, or the great Cersei/Jaime sexual reunion.

liked the wildlings scene, and Danny.
Disliked Sam's boring scenes and Jamie the rapist? No
Â 
Also Oberyn is the coolest bisexual ever, fact.
105	iliasb	2014-04-21	Oberyn, as always awesome!
Sam was boring.
Liked Dany and Mereen
Battle at Castle Black is coming (but first Craster's keep (wut?))
Twincest next to joffrey - laughed.
Loved to see Cersei angry with Tywin....
106	Javi Marcos	2014-04-21	Awesome as an TV transition episode, mediocre adaptation. Overall, an 8.
107	Night's_King	2014-04-21	6.
Â 
The Daenerys Scene at the ending was soooo bad. Emilia Clarke just can't act.
108	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-21	6.
Â 
The Daenerys Scene at the ending was soooo bad. Emilia Clarke just can't act.


I agree. So torrid and flat.
109	ipsuel	2014-04-21	Rated it a 5 -- mainly because I honestly only enjoyed about 50% of it. The filler, the overuse of whores and the character assassination is just too much for me at this point. Fingers crossed next ep will be better.Â
110	Red Tiger	2014-04-21	6, I thought this episode was quite boring by GOT standards.
111	The Killer Snark	2014-04-21	I gave this an unreserved 10. It had absolutely everything you'd want it to, and was practically perfect. A few pacing issues maybe with the Sam and Gilly scenes, but nothing too serious. Martin made a bit of a rush-job on his own material last week and the alterations were pretty variable and the end results were patchy. It was a very good episode which should have been much more. Changes here were minor and worked in terms of the series, but overall this was the most source-sensitive and character-consistent episode we've had in quite a while. All of the King's Landing scenes were perfectly dialogued and judged, especially the much needed bonus scene between Oberyn and Tywin, and the heartbreaking scene between Tyrion and Pod in the Tower. The Meereen scene at the end was just epic. They've changed the order of events around between the taking of Meereen and Yunkai, and it's Daario, not Fat Belwas, who kills the champion outside the gates. But the alterations, dramatically speaking, are improvements, especially since we can now see how much Dany's favouritism of Daario is alienating Jorah Mormont. There's nothing significant I can fault with this. If it keeps on going on this tack instead of randomly screwing around with what wasn't broken, the rest of the season will be a blast.
Â 
Note: The low marks it has been getting are indicative of how well it succeeds in what it is doing. We need more steadily built and paced episodes like this one instead of those which barge through events just to get to the next big moment of drama, in order to do real justice to the immersiveness of the books.

112	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	They had Jaime full on rape Cersei... Was good otherwise, but I'm beginning to agree with those who think the writers have their favourites and Anti favourites and will drastically change the tone of things to suit this
113	Ser Graymax	2014-04-21	Another 7 from me earned entirely by Lord Tywin and aided by Pod.
The rest of the episode was meh.
Â 
Didnt like what they did with The Hound this episode but it is probably setting up Arya leaving him.Â 
Â 
No Fat Belwas, Jamie out of character as a Rapist, Oberyn being Oberyn (again),Â  big buildup then letdown when the championship fight becomes a pissing contest..Â  Would have at least liked a better look at the City Champion, being filtered through the Unscrotumed did the costume and character no justice.Â 
Â 
Dany, on the other hand was perfect.Â  Her speech was delivered cold, emotionless and without inflection just like the rest of her acting but here it worked!!!Â  Maybe it was because I would rather read the subtitles than watch her.

114	Andros Sotherton	2014-04-21	6 out of 10.Â 
Kind of regret my low rating when I come to think of it. Just finished the episode, maybe should have at least given it a 7.Â 
Really liked it but what brought it down in rating was the differences from the books. Of course that doesn't affect the show but to me as a reader it was in my face quite clearly.Â 
Two important things, what the hell was that with Jaime and what deflection are Weiss and Benioff taking with Craster's Keep?Â
115	Ser Shaft of Hightower	2014-04-21	A 10. Best episode of the season.Â 


 
Â  I give it a nine.5
Â Acting, and the pace of direction/editing was the best of this season by far!
Â Â  I'm not wild about all of the book deviations (season two was the main offender in this regard, though) - but TV is rarely this well-made anyways, as this episode amply demonstrates. Maise truly added a lot to her role here,as it seems her acting chops just get stronger. Sansa/Dontos/LF was just about spot-on, and the Tywin scenes are Mr. Dance's pleasure, it seems. What a smooooth talker, heh.
Â 
This one only misses a 10 due to the sam&gilly scenes being reducible to about a minute of story, instead of ten. And I know the budget only gives us so much of them because it's complicated to produce greatness, but: ~no dragons~ 
Still a great epi, tho.
116	iliasb	2014-04-21	Two important things, what the hell was that with Jaime and what deflection are Weiss and Benioff taking with Craster's Keep?Â 


Â 
That's what I keep asking myself (about Craster's Keep).Â
117	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-21	I also gave it an unreserved 10. I thought the episode was fantastic except for portraying Oberyn and Eleria Sand as sex maniacs. I think that has gone too far and certainly way beyond anything the books give us.
Â 
The Sansa/Littlefinger section was great and I am glad to see that they are sticking to the book. I am curious to see how things play out and if the ending of the season is the same as the end of book 3, SOS.
Â 
Actually I thought the whole episode was great and love how they end with strong Dany scenes more often than not. I think Emilia Clark is doing a great job as Dany.
Â 
This forum seems to have very harsh critics. I think this is the best show on television and really look forward to the episodes all week.
118	Ferrum Aeternum	2014-04-21	I gave it an 8.Â  Not an action-heavy episode but very well written with some excellent scenes.Â  The show has gotten so much better in how it presents expository dialogue.Â 
Â 
Highlights:Â 
Â 
- Sansa's escape was well-handled and dramatic without getting silly.Â  Essentially it's exactly what I envisioned from the book.
- Tywin/Tommen/Cersei was an excellent scene all around.Â Â  I know opinions vary on this, but I think new Tommen was a great casting choice.
- Tywin/Oberyn was a fun exchange that made a lot of sense.
- Pod/Tyrion was so incredibly well-played by both actors.Â  I was surprised at how it affected me emotionally.
- Dany the breaker of chains was fine, although as an audience memberÂ it made me want toÂ scream WHERE ARE YOUR DRAGONS?
Â 
Lowlights:
Â 
- Damn you, Cersei/Jaime scene!Â  Why have the gods cursed you with such inept directing?Â 
- New Daario still doesn't register with me and I'm not sure he ever will.Â  He's dull as fuck and he and Dany's "flirting" interplay comes across as forced in a manner not often seen in this series.
119	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-21	This episode was kind of a let down.  Strong Belwas was missed.
120	Turncloak_	2014-04-21	Â 
That's what I keep asking myself (about Craster's Keep).Â 

From the spoilers given in comments at wic. net we might know what's going to happen at Crasters keep. Bran and co are going to stumble there and most likely get captured. Jon and Grenn lead a mission there to kill the nights watch traitors and as a result they unknowingly free Brand group. Rast uses one of Crasters baby's as a hostage and challenges Jon to single combat. Rast tries to push Jon to a fire to no effect (strange that D&D are going with that angle considering that Jon was burned by a lantern in season 1). The mission is successful and Jon takes the baby back to castle black. This is probably a replacement to Mance's baby which I also find odd
121	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2014-04-21	6/10Â 
This episode was not based on the books.
122	Mexal	2014-04-21	I gave it an 8. Don't care that Strong Belwas wasn't there since we really don't need yet another character in the show. Didn't like the directing of the Jaime/Cersei scene. Definitely not clear enough that it wasn't pure rape even though that's what they were trying to do (she does kiss him throughout though).
Â 
Otherwise, I was a fan. I like episodes like this where it's more focused on the character interactions and also giving a sense of how some of the little people are affected. I don't need shock and awe every episode and I felt this was a well paced episode with some excellent scenes though they still had their big finish with Dany.

123	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-21	This was one of those episodes where it seems the enormous amounts of shit going on kind of just took control because you get a snippet of this then zoom to something else, then again then again then again and then shows over.
124	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	Also, I'd forgotten how unsubtle Gillen's LF has become. Why change why he says he killed Dontos too?
125	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-21	Â 
I HATE HBO!!!!
Â 
THIS IS WORST THAT THE STANNIS BUTCHERY JAMES RAPERY TYRION WHITEWHASHERY CERSEI VICTIMIZATION!
Â 
I give the episode a 5.
Â 
Wait, I already voted.Lets see how they handle Shae. She is not the bitch she was in the books. This could only look darker than in the books.
Daenerys however, stays as whitewashed, supercool and badass as ever.
126	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-21	Daenerys however, stays as whitewashed, supercool and badass as ever.


Â 
That's debatable. I find Show Dany pretentious and boring.Â
127	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	Dany's insanity becomes more clear in the books once she's in Meeran though
128	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-21	Dany's insanity becomes more clear in the books once she's in Meeran thoughHer worst crime ever was Astapor. And it has been whitewashed.
129	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-21	7. It wasn't bad or anything... it was like Sam trying to start a fire. Sparks and all, but no fire at the end of the day.Â 
Â 
I don't get why people say Emilia Clark can't act. I don't see how she's any worse than Sophie Turner or Lena Headey. I'm just fine with her.Â 
Â 
The Gilly filler was way too long and absolutely pointless in every possible way. How could Gilly possibly be more safe in a town where people go whoring all the time with nobody to protect her than at Castle Black among people sworn to celibacy whose majority would even protect her (including Sam, Aemon, Jon, Pyp, Grenn and Edd)??? That's -1 in itself.Â 
Â 
Boobs - check, deaths - check, Charles Dance being awesome - check, humor - check... but overall it was still just one big Meh.Â
130	lostinasia	2014-04-21	Turncloak, you probably want to put all that about Craster's in spoiler tags. That's a rather detailed giveaway for upcoming episodes!
Â 
I'll give it an 8.5, rounded down to 8 because 9 is pretty much the highest score I give. Really enjoyed this episode. Not quite as good as the first episode this season Â (although I may have been rating that a bit higher simply because it was great to see new episodes again), but just as good as last week's. An excellent start to the season.
Â 
Liked Jamie/Cersei because it was disturbing. As Bald Move pointed out in their instant podcast, this episode was wonderful at undercutting expectations. Oh, so you like Ygritte and Tormund? Watch them kill villagers. Like the Hound now? Watch him beat up someone and steal his gold. Like Jamie? Watch him rape his sister.
Â 
I'm very curious what King's Landing is going to be like next season with, um, only Cersei? Oh, and Tommen and the Tyrells I guess. It's not going to be the same.
Â 
Enjoyed Sam and Gilly, although I can see why people think those scenes are a bit slow.
Â 
Like many others, I'm glad to see Jon Snow becoming an interesting character. Plus the interplay between him and Alliser is great.
Â 
Not entirely fond of whatever happened with the sound mix this time. There were a bunch of lines I had to replay to catch.
Â 
Is Daenerys channelling some kind of Italian thing when she speaks Valyrian?
Â 
Pod and Tyrion fantastic. I'm curious how he's going to wind up with Brienne.
Â 
By far my biggest gripe: Littlefinger's voice. I know the guy can act, so what is going on with his voice in this show?! Minor gripe: while the payoff of Oberyn asking Tywin if he wanted a seat was great, I'm not sure it was worth justÂ how long the preceding scene was.
131	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-21	7...the best scene was the conversation between Tywin and oberyn. I believe it clarified things more to the non book readers. But still i couldn't understand the need for the sam and gilly 15 minutes scene
132	dbunting	2014-04-21	Also gave it a 7. Sam and Gilly scenes were just in the way of a better episode and pulled it down. I would have much rather heard more from Edd and ??? Grenn?? Name slips me right now.Did not like Jaime/Cersei scene. Would have made more sense for Cersei to use her feminine "weapons" to try to get Jaime to kill Tyrion and Sansa. They made it look like a rape, when in the book it was not.
133	lostinasia	2014-04-21	Did not like Jaime/Cersei scene. Would have made more sense for Cersei to use her feminine "weapons" to try to get Jaime to kill Tyrion and Sansa.


There's a strong possibility she did try that - that she started kissing him, then turned away, using that refusal as a weapon to make him kill Tyrion. And Jaime decided he would have none of that - hence the "hateful woman" line, his acknowledgement and indeed realization of how she's trying to control him. That's how I read the first part of that scene, although of course there are other ways to interpret it.
134	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-21	7. It wasn't bad or anything... it was like Sam trying to start a fire. Sparks and all, but no fire at the end of the day.Â

That's -1 in itself.Â 
Â 
Boobs - check, deaths - check, Charles Dance being awesome - check, humor - check... but overall it was still just one big Meh.

I agree with you that Emila Clark is a decent actress, however, please don't compare her to Lena Headey. Lena is an amazing actress. EC could never humanize Cersei the way Lena has.
135	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-21	A strong 8. I liked Tywin's interference into Cersei's grief and his history lesson. The birds and bees lesson he started giving to Tommen was hilarious. So, nice outside the book dialogue writing. Also, useful for the viewers who haven't read the books. Since you can, pls tell D&D to stop playing pranks with book readers. Trailer for episode number 3 was suggesting that Gilly and Sam were on their way to somewhere else, but Moletown (no spoilers here). My heart stopped there for a second. I'm not sure why D&D decided to expand Gilly&Sam arc, but since I love Sam, I think that's fine. Dragonstone was an interesting out of book context that will tie up well with the book in the end. Kudos for Littlefinger/Sansa scene. Gillen was as creepy as humanly possible without being menacing. The only big objection is portrayal of Jaime's behavior in the sept.Â  I don't think it's character consistent and useful at all. Hence, 8 out of 10.

136	The hairy bear	2014-04-21	It's been a 5 for me. A very average episode. The only thing that was outstandig for me was Tywin mentoring Joffrey, but most of the other scenes felt real flat for me.
137	FaHaZe	2014-04-21	Gets a 9 from me. Loved it!
Â 
The beginning (Sansa's escape) was good, well edited.
Â 
The Tywin-Tommen interraction was pretty cool.
Â 
The Cersei rape scene didn't shock/bother me since I don't really care about Jamie and his character development, neither in the book nor in the show, so...whatever. Jamie could have killed a puppy in this episode, I wouldn't have cared.
Â 
The Dornish orgy. Gods bless the Martells for providing us the sex scenes this season! (I can only imagine how Arianne's introduction next season will be...) And then the Tywin-Oberyn dialogue (Tywin's badass moment #2 for this episode). I remember how last summer many people here worried that Pedro Pascal didn't look Dornish enough or that heÂ couldn't conveyÂ Oberyn's badassery. LOL!! Pedro is perfect for this role imo.
Â 
The wildling attack was scary but awesome at the same time. (Although I did chuckle when the big bad Styr said "mama" and "papa". I doubt those words would exist in the Common Language, let alone a wildling know them or use them. But it was funny.) Also, it reminded me a bit of a scene from Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers.
Â 
Arya and the Hound are hilarious.
Â 
The Meereen scene was quite amazing as well (and it didn't even have dragons!!). Unlike the old Daario, the new Daario can act and isÂ better looking. At least now I can understand Dany being attracted to him. Dany delivering a speech in High Valyrian is always a plus. And attacking the city with the collars of the former slaves was a nice twist (I don't remember that being in the books?...). Talk about saving the best for last.
The ending was perfect.
Â 
Overall, episode 3 was infinitely better than episode 2 (which was an absolute bore - save for the ending - and all over the place. I didn't even bother rating that one since I didn't know how to rate it.) and as good as episode 1 as far as I'm concerned. I only gave it a 9 because the Sam-Gilly scene went nowhere, the Lannisters kept interrupting the hot Dornish sex scenes (just like in episode 1) and because there were no dragons.
138	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-04-21	Gave it a straight 7. Good episode throughout, my only gripe is Littlefingers constantly changing voice/accent.
139	Awale	2014-04-21	4 for me... I slightly liked the Dany scene but I see what you mean about how they've turned her into this one note character that keeps giving off these speeches. Belwas will be missed but Naharis (>_> BROWN haired Naharis) did good, I salute.
Â 
I'm surprised so many people love the wildling scene, it was bad ass in its own odd way but as a book reader, knowing what the Thenns are really like and what the Magnar of Thenn, Styr is really like- it's painful watching them being degraded into wild, savage cannibals. Aren't the Thenns in the books supposed to stand out amongst the wildlings because they're much more civilized than most free folk ?!
Â 
Jaime raping cersei was painful to watch, I mean... What hell, D&D?
Â 
I just didn't like this episode. Mereen looked amazing btw, though if they have enough money to pull those kinds of environments off- why didn't they just go all the way and make the pyramids colourful or give the mereenese their insane hairstyles?
Â 
Ahh, I maybe give it a 5 at best, all in all
140	George Sapp	2014-04-21	I gave it a 4. Worse episode to date. 
We get it D&D...OBERYN LIKES MEN!!!
141	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-21	I voted 8 because other than some questionable direction choices in the Jaime/Cersei scene I thought this was actually a great episode. The dialogue and overall thematic unfolding of the episode was great.
142	Panther2000	2014-04-21	Seven seems fair. It's a transition episode so I wasn't really expecting anything, but I feel like the ending could have been waaaay better. It just fell flat on it's face.


I have to agree.Â  It was hard to follow the last 2 shows this week.Â Â Â  The show started out great, & moved along very well.Â  Like many others until Sam stuff just fell way short ( meanwhile the Wall other business was good).Â Â Â  I have been so over dani for the past 2 seasons it isn't even funny.Â  Her Birth right Blah Blah Blah.Â Â  JM even told her that her family came over & took the throne from that king, not unlike Robert B.Â Â Â  Who ever gets there & wins it, it belongs to them until the next.Â Â Â 
Â 
But, her Mother of Dragons & her birthright speeches has turned me off.Â  & I think that, is what suppose to happen.Â Â  She seems to be getting full her herself( Which is what a King/Queen usually does).Â  But, without the killing of children,Â  she seems to have the Targ mental issues, just to a lessor scale right not.Â Â Â Â 
Â 
As for the rest.Â  My Fav of course:Â  Tyrion & Pod.Â Â  Good God, I started to tear up.Â Â  I know come next week I will probably be in full Crying mode .Â  Him sending pod away because he knows that Pod too is also in danger of getting killed because of him.Â Â Â  He is truly alone ( except for Jamie),Â  I think with the show they may have fixed a problem for me from the books.Â Â  A certain person turns on him from out of no where & for no reason.Â  Now, with the show you can see why they turn on him.Â Â Â Â Â  The Jamie & Cersi thing Eh, whatever.Â Â  At least we did not see her MB.Â Â  I did not know what to make of it.Â  She kept saying no & this isn't right however, she was hugging & kissing & such.Â  Again, whatever.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Tywin, Mr. Badass.Â Â Â  He knows that Kings Landing & His family is in much trouble & needs help.Â  In order to get that help he must give up his PET.Â Â Â Â  I also , loved the fact that he stepped right in & took over Tommen from Cersi ( being that she did such a wonderful job with Joffrey).Â Â  I think that Sansa is finally opening her eyes, but she still doesn't see.Â Â  Finally we get to see some WW action come next week.Â 
Â 
In the end, I don't think that there will be any Iron Throne

143	OnlyOne	2014-04-21	i liked the wildling attack and littlefingers accent changed, its creepier noww an 8 for me

I agree. Super creepy. Sansa needs to wise up. You'd think by now she would have learned...something....anything. Ugh. I hope she kills him and grows a few brain cells. Am I the only one who would love to see Sansa and Tyrion wind up together?
144	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-21	7/10
Â 
I still think the standard is high and Season 4 is shaping up to be very gripping and interesting. However, some scenes dragged the episode down for me.
Â 
Good-
Â 
Tywin- His exchanges with Tommen and Oberyn were done very well, especially the grandfatherly/advisor nature he shows towards Tommen. It almost reminded me of his Season 2 scenes with Arya.
Â 
Arya and the Hound- "Are you going to pray to all seven of the fuckers?Â  "Father!"Â  
Â 
Â I also liked the mention of how disgraceful the RW was ('The Gods will have their vengeance') and how the riverlands (and North) have gone to the dogs since Frey rule.
Â 
I will never tire of Dany speaking in Valyrian and I loved the broken slave collars in the barrels
Â 
Jon coming across as more demanding of respect/authoritative. I also liked how he was holding that little boys shoulder for support/comfort. 
Â 
Bad-
Â 
Jaime raping Cersei...It WAS rape!
Â 
Oberyn+ Whores + I AM BI-SEXUAL!!Â You'd think that'sÂ all he has going for him with the added desire for vengeance.
Â 
Stannis is a Dick, Period. I don't see any duty or dry humour...

145	OnlyOne	2014-04-21	I voted 8 because other than some questionable direction choices in the Jaime/Cersei scene I thought this was actually a great episode. The dialogue and overall thematic unfolding of the episode was great.

That part truly was a huge mistake. I'm disappointed.
146	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-21	Gave it a 7. Sam always bores me, even in the books, I did like Tywin and Tommen, and Tywin and Oberyn. Idk why everyone has this whitewashed image of the sept scene, even in the book it was kinda the same tone. Gillen is trying too hard. He was solid in the wire but in this, idk, it's like he's at his acting limits or he's intimidated by the talent around him and trying to be something he's not, weird. Solid but not anything special.
147	Old Man River	2014-04-21	I thought this was the weakest episode of the series thus far.Â  Too many stupid clumsy things.Â  Dany stands directly behind Daario while a mounted man charges at him?Â  Yeah so much for not risking the important people!Â  Sure they wanted to have the two of them in the shot together and have him turn and do his little wink, but that was idiotic.Â  This one didn't have that sense of being "well done" for me.Â  I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.
148	OnlyOne	2014-04-21	I think that was the best Daenerys scene since drogon rosting the astapori guy
overall was good, sam was super boring, so 9

I loved her scene and yes Sam was well; typical Sam.
149	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-21	Sansa's escape = 8Â Along with picking up at the Purple Wedding and Joffrey's little lifeless corpse. Again, the lack of panic and disorder, mainly due to lack of shots of the wedding party, made everything feel off. Tywin shouted at no one, as if the orders of 'no one leaves' at this point could be followed. The awkwardness of Kingsguard extras standing stupidly in the background, Tyrion being carted away awkwardly at the behest of an obviously deranged Cersei felt stupid. Sansa and Dontos' escape was rushed, but I enjoyed it. People complain about LF's voice. Yea, its annoying. I don't know why he's talking like that. But w/e, I'm glad to see him back.
Margaery & Olenna = 4Â I honestly pretty much forgot this scene already.
The Sept of Baelor = 7The Tywin/Tommen bit had a point but it went on too long and was boring. Jaime didn't rape Cersei, she went along with it, but also was conflicted because of the locale. Yea, she was saying "not here" but she didn't quite fight him with determination. She was conflicted. I think they should have kept it more clearly by the book. How strong this scene would have been if they hadn't made Jaime arrive three episodes early.
Arya & The Hound = 5Â I'm not enjoying Arya this season. I'm seeing the actress coming through the acting and it takes me out. She's made herself too much of a joke with the audience outside of the show and its bleeding into her performance. 'She's the cute little girl who is also a badass.' The Hound's Winter lesson was a good darkening of the character, but somewhat out of character, unless he is beginning to despair for some reason, but they haven't set anything up for that so it just appears like sloppy writing.
Sam & Gilly = 2Â Boring as seven hells. Should have stopped with the "and what about you" line. Sam is a very annoying character when he is being wimpy and since he's back basically a season too early at the wall they have to give his character filler crap to do, which hurts the character. Was a big waste of uninteresting time for this not too exciting episode. It drug.Â 
Dragonstone = 2Â I honestly forgot most of this already. Why isn't he at the wall? Even my Unsullied family members were like "what's he doing?" The poor choices the writers have made with the timeline is basically turning the rest of this season into a damn spoiler fest until the stupid attack on the wall can finally happen, which just has to wait until episode 9 for some dumb reason when it could have happened this episode. (The first attack from the south, but again they've brought Alister and Janos back too early so now they have to do some stupid crap with them. Ugh filler fest).
The Brothel = 4Â I'm a MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR fan of the Viper. First, they've cut the nickname and his affinity for poisons and made it into a stupid exposition line for Tywin to bring up. That cuts like half the character. Too much "hey we like sex" as people have already said. The point of him coming to KL was to be on the Small Council, but they changed it in the show to just attending the wedding, which seems a little stupid. Why would Tywin bribe him with basically nothing that the Viper cares about excluding Gregor. Why would the Viper want a seat on the stupid small council? That would be the most boring thing to him. Why would he want to help the Lannisters at all? Gahh just so much dumb. I'm waiting to see where they are taking this arc before I judge it too harshly. Having Tywin promise Gregor takes away so much of the character's drive and motivation.
Tyrion & Pod = 4Â Stupid whitewashing of Tyrion and Bronn. Now Pod has a more graceful exit from his service so that is ok. I forgot most everything else that happened in this scene as well.
The Wildling Attack = 1Â "The Horselords took your land. Burn every village!" Are teh wildlings bad guys mum? I'm not sure. Oh, cannibalism is bad, so yes tehy are bad too. Yayyyyy
Castle Black = 2Â What happened? Oh, filler attack Craster's camp. WHat? Aren't the wildlings like just about to attack your damn wall with 100k men? Didn't you just say being drawn out was a stupid idea? Now you want to march TOWARDS the main host to kill a bunch of people who have useless information? Such poorly contrived filler. And why is everyone listening to Jon now? I figured since Thorne hates him he would, like, NOT listen to him. But yea something happened let's ask Snow's advice he probably knows what's best he's like 20 years old now.
Daenerys = 4Â Yeaaa, again just a bit wut. March that close up to the enemy gates. Why would the Meereneese allow you to do that? That's a pretty tight little pass you just marched your army through. Woulda been a great place for an ambush or for, say, 300 uber warriors to make a stand so that the overwhelming numbers of your army are nullified. Glad to get some more of Captain Expo (Ser Jorah) spouting off amazing lines like "He is a Hero of Meereen." Oh, ok, I would never have gotten that. Poor man's Daario is poor man's Daario. Its like his understudy is playing him. The placement of the fight was just awkward as hell and its obvious the Daario actor has no physical training. The whole chains thing would have been cool if Dany didn't have a cool switcheroo move to pull every single time she ran into an enemy ever. Its predictable and expected at this point.
I don't have a calculator, so overall, like, a 5? I guess? Still gonna watch it again just cause I love GoT so much.
150	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-21	That part truly was a huge mistake. I'm disappointed.


Â 
I rewatched the scene and it was more obvious to me that it was partly consentual, but the way it ended was weird. Just have Cersei look somewhat into it if a little conflicted, rather than an ambiguous zoomed in tug of Jaime's clothes. I think too many will focus on it though, and it's a shame because the episode was really well written and there was clear direction and purpose to every scene.
151	The Tickler.	2014-04-21	I gave it a 6, most probably a bit harsh, but Sam and Gilly are just so boring.
Â 
I don't now why they are giving them airtime that adds nothing to the story. Â
152	jarl the climber	2014-04-21	Â

I think too many will focus on it though, and it's a shame because the episode was really well written and there was clear direction and purpose to every scene.


It was supposed to be a disgusting scene and I think they captured it accurately. Jaimie is likable and charismatic but he is a vile human being who has done terrible things which I think book readers have a tendency to overlook. Jaimies feelings towards Cersei have always been more solid and consistent, Cersei however is more fickle and moody. Jaimie wants to be honest and out in the open with their relationship and Cersei thinks it is madness.Â 
Â 
I think think the writers were actually trying to subtle with this scene and its not something they usually do, maybe they botched it, I have to rewatch it. As far as people complaining about the Unsullied reaction, I disagree about the rape but it was repulsive and sacreligious, a Â despicable act and if the Unsullied have a negative reaction to it maybe readers, more hardcore fans need to pay attention to this and not blame the writers for botching the scene which I thought they did a good job with.
153	The Monkey	2014-04-21	9/10
Â 
Mostly everything worked. The dialogue was great, and they really have figured out the pacing. I didn't really mind the Jaime/Cersei scene. It didn't seem like a rape at all to me, but I understand if people view it differently.Her "no"s didn't seem to come from a woman who was raped (and all the psychological terrors that come with it), but rather someone who likes it, but isn't sure that this is the best time and place. Also, Charles Dance is magnificent, can't say that enough.
Â 
1 point off for the dull Sam/Gilly scenes.

Â 
Started reading this forum couple of days ago and to be honest Im starting to regret it. Instead of just enjoying the show Im starting to take part in silly conversations about every little thing that happened in the episode. Im losing all the joy of the episode I watched because people in here can criticize every little detail. You're over-analysing stuff instead of just enjoying the series. This isnt the book, its a show thats just based on the book but was never going to be exactly the same. Things are different, characters are presented in a different way and some storylines are different as well. No need to point every little detail.

155	Bearson	2014-04-21	Gave it a 3.
Â 
Dialogue was rather cheesy this episode, and the Magnar of Thenn was over-acting his part and his dialogue in the raid made me facepalm. It was way too over-the-top, but unfortunately I think that's how they're gonna keep portraying the Thenn. I think they pulled off that scene with Joffrey in the sept pretty well. They did after all do that at the sept, in the book and it wasn't described as being all that...."nice" there, either. Otherwise, it was just a stepping stone to the next episode.

156	House Targlannistark	2014-04-21	8. Best episode this season, so farÂ  
If there had been a a longer scene at Mereen with Strong Belwas, it would get a 10 easily!
Â 
Loved the Tyrion - Pod scene and the Davos scenes.

Well, Magnar of Thenn is being played by a Russian actor. So, he has to be the evilest of evil. The stereotype demands it.
158	Ran	2014-04-21	343 voted, 7.15 average, 8 median (barely), 7.27 normalized average.
159	King Tyrion I	2014-04-21	Okay. After rewatching it, it's a solid 9 from me.
Â 
Because of:
Â 
- Tywin/Tommen
- Tywin/Oberyn
- Shireen/Davos
- Pod/Tyrion <= My favorite scene of the episode.
- the choreography of that village-raid by the Thenns and the Wildlings
- Arya/The Hound
- Jaime/Cersei
Â 
Sam and Gilly: I don't know yet what to make of this one.
Â 
Danaerys. Uhm. Don't know what to say about her. But the slave taking up the collar and looking at his master was certainly great, and I liked it.
Â 
Sansa/LF: Sansa's great. Her "No more lies" takes the cake.
EDith: the Qot was witty, and Margaery a bit too worried about her status as queen. That's it.

160	Ser Blake	2014-04-21	I'm really really confused by the low rating of this episode.Â  I feel like people are focusing to heavily on that one controversial scene, that is clearly open for interpretation, instead of focusing on the episode as a whole.Â  Outside of the controversy of that one scene and the boring Sam/Gilly scenes I felt this was an extremely strong episode.Â  Not quite sure how/why it has one of the lowest ratings of the entire series.
161	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-21	I'd rate it an 8.5/10 (B+), but went with an 8 for the poll.Â 
Â 
I felt like this episode had one of the strongest dramatic through-lines of the series (on a thematic level), in terms of the idea of protection and protecting the people you care about/are supposed to take care of.Â
162	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-21	Agreed. The low rating is shocking. This episode was a thousand times better than the episodes from season 3 and 2 that had about the same rating.Â

These forums are pretty well known for over-the-top reactions, particularly when something is presented differently than it was in the books.Â 
Â 
You'd think they showed Ser Davos killing babies the way the community is "outraged" about it, so all of that invented disgust just to be a part of something seemingly controversial unfortunately overshadows what was easily the best written episode of this season so far.Â

Â 
I'm somewhat surprised as well (only somewhat, I know this forum). The episode wasn't great, but it was consistently strong (except Sam), and far better than a couple of real duds that are in previous seasons.

Touche. I've lost count how many times I've seen the phrase "character assassination" or I fault this episode because one scene was "different from the books." I wish people wouldn't be so sensitive and realize the show is completely separate from the books.Â

Â 
True it really isn't that shocking, but it's disappointing because the quality of this episode was fantastic. I guess I'm just not so picky that I will fault an entire episode if I don't enjoy one scene. The funny thing is I've seen amazing reviews from non-book viewers. I heard one person say it was his favorite episode ever because he loved the dialogue so much. A little extreme, I know, but I can certainly understand his opinion more than someone who gives the episode a 5 because one scene caused them to blow a gasket. Â The fact is last night's episode was probably better than anything else we'll see on TV until the next GOT episode airs.Â

Â 
It's not just the concept of the show being different than the books, it's that the community as a whole has become a more blatant circlejerk than most subreddits. Try to read through a single thread without seeing "Agency, male gaze, gratuitous, butchered, character assassination, heavy handed" or whatever the newest hot word on the forum is. So some people voice outrage and then suddenly everyone comes out to declare how something relatively ambiguous caused them such distress and physical pain that they're giving the show one last chance before abandoning it.
Â 
But another contributing factor is that nothing major happened, really. Some people will rate last week's episode higher just because Joffrey died, as the impact of that single episode is considerably more memorable.
167	RadoLukacs	2014-04-21	8/10.
Â 
The immediate follow-up to the last episode's ending was greatly done, especially Sansa's escape and her meeting with Littlefinger. I was pleased by Lena's acting in the last episode and in this one she continues to do a brilliant job. The actor who really stood out for me in the Arya's scenes was Finbar Lynch as the farmer. John Bradley also did an amazing job, as well as Pedro Pascal and Charles Dance (I am very hopeful that the plot around Tyrion's trial and Elia will be great). Tyrion's farewell to Podrick was quite sad, to be honest. 
	Spoiler The one thing that I found cheesy was the fact that they established a minor character (Guymon from the village south of the Wall) solely for the purpose of having a character of importance kill Ygritte out of revenge. It at least seems like that is what they are going to do. Not necessary for me.
 The Meereen scene was well-done, I liked almost everything about it (particularly Great Worm - Jacob Anderson did not disappoint so far; Dany's speech and her acting overall except a few weird close-up shots; Daario is good and serves the purpose, Huisman knows what he is doing and it sure looks like they are moving into A Dance With Dragons material this season, if not significantly plot-wise, then at least concerning characters' relationships and motivations; and it is good to see that they introduced Hizdahr as a familiar face).
Â 
I really liked the episode, it was better than the premiere (at least regarding action scenes), but did not outdo the second episode in my eyes. There was some remarkable acting, visual quality and despite some moments of action (created mainly by photography, visual effects and momentary suspense), I see this episode as a conclusion to the previous episode and a quality build-up for the events to come.
Â 
Â 
Episodes 1, 2 and 3:Â Â  7;10;8/10.

168	Clariana	2014-04-21	I thought it was incredibly well balanced with a few stand out moments Tywin/Oberyn, QoT, "I can't kill a hundred wildings...", Stannis getting desperate.
Â 
8
169	Ser Lawrence	2014-04-21	Gave it an 8.Â  I am loving this season way more than last (despite the RW).Â  This episode was so good I was surprised when the credits rolled.Â  If it wasn't for the Sam, Mole's Town, stuff... it would have been nearly perfect in that regard.
Â 
I didn't care about Book-Tywin much, but amÂ LOVING Dance's portrayal.Â  As the show correctly points out, "all men must die", so when the time comes I will miss that actor very much.
Â 
Kind of liked the Queen of Thornes in the books, but am liking her even more in the show.
Â 
Pod seems like a more significant character in the show, when compared to what I took away from the books.
Â 
Also loved Tywin quite literally taking Tommen away from Cercei in the sept.Â  I feel like he may be a better "father" for him than he was for this three jacked-up kids!
Â 
Jamie and sister in the sept just as creepy as in the book, if not more.
Â 
I too like the pacing this season way more than last... sorry for too much overlap with previous eight pages of posts.
170	rmholt	2014-04-21	8 some good dialogue + trebuchets of collars responsible for two of those pts.
171	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-21	Solid 8.
Â 
Didn't like the rape of Cersei. Is Jaime going to be a bad guy again now?
Return to type for Arya, so I liked that. At the end of the first episode she seemed to have gone to the dark side.
Liked the scenes in the north, but I'm not really sure why we need them. Are they slowing things down to give Stannis time to get to the Wall in time to save the day? I thought he was going to set sail immediately at the end of Season 3, but he's still down in Dragonstone, so I guess he needs time.
Nice opening and good to see LF again. Also some of the best dialogue since it came from the book. The dialogue in most other scenes was solid but not inspiring.
Liked Dany's scenes. Where'd she get those ballistas?
Â 
Good episode overall, but the book was better,
172	SarahApril	2014-04-21	9.
That last speech was epic. The command that Clarke has over that language is so got damn hot.


Â 
That was my only comment on twitter. I could never learn that speech. hands down.
173	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-21	Deserves nothing more than a 3. The first scene with Sansa and Littlefinger was very good, even if it was a bit rushed. But it got worse after that scene. I won't even mention the disgusting scene between Jaime and Cersei (I can't believe they added rape!), but the rest was all very disappointing. The older Tommen just isn't working for me. I had expected a young kid who plays with kittens and has no clue what's going on. This Tommen however seems to know what's up (even though he's being manipulated by Tywin). Btw, I don't think Tywin actually believed the rumor that Dany has Dragons in the books? (or at least he said he didn't believe it). The last scene however was the most disappointing, not a big surprise I suppose.
174	Died a Hero	2014-04-21	9
Â 
Would have been a 10 if not for Samâ<U+0080><U+0099>s go nowhere bullshit and Jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s implied forcing of Cersei. The Wilding raid was unnerving, in a good way. Littlefinger got some of his â<U+0080><U+009C>whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Littlefinger up to?â<U+0080><U+009D> mystique back. Jon is way less Emo. And Emily Clark can speak High Valyrian for the whole show from now on and I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think anyone would mind. I loved the collars from the dead slaves in the caskets; very nice touch. Every once in a while D&D hit the mark with their add-ons.Â

Â 
What?! Nothing happened! I thought they'd make the Cersei/Jaime scene next to Joff's corpse more funny, but nothing important happened. I even thought the dialogue (except for Dany's last speech) was a bit weak compared to former chapters.
176	Volverin	2014-04-21	Im sick of people bitching about the rape scene. What is the big deal? The book is the book and the TV series are the TV series. Jaimie is being shown in dark light again, is that such a problem? I really dont get all the fuss.

7/10. Â It would have been 9/10 had the director not turned Jaime into a rapist. Â Why is it such a big deal? Â Because the character has been irrevocably been damaged. Â Rapists are only accepted by those who don't think rape is such a bad thing.

I gave it a solid 7, which means its as good as or better than anything else I will see on TV in a given week. They seem to have gotten over the season two blues and are continuing with the mostly strong episodes they have had since season three all though I would say that season 1 was still the best season to date. This is a high budget TV show, it deserves a 3 or a 4 just for its production value and ambition.
179	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-04-21	It seems this episode was the most boring episode so far this season, because there are not any big moments. But, there are several scenes I really like such as Tywin/Oberyn conversation, Wildling raiding, Sansa's escape and especially the Meereen thing. My rate would be somewhere beetween 7 and 8.

Here's the problem I have with this whole discussion about rape that seems to have taken over the discussion of this scene. I've always seen this as one of the most profane and disgusting scenes in the entire series. So if they had to make it a little rapey to be sure that they really drived this home it doesn't bother me. I was a little distracted watching this last night, so I have to rewatch it and drop my book prejudice because I did not pick up on this, I sort of thought Cersei was saying no but meant yes but I might be wrong. Still I've always seen Jaimie as a scumbag, just not a total one, maybe hes 75% scumbag and 25% OK guy, who just happens to be good at being a scumbag, it fits him well, so hes able to get away with it. Still I think that since there is some contoversy over this they seem to have gotten this one right.

Â 
So there is no problem at all! GRRM said himself he doesnt know if book Jaimie raped Cersei or not because it was a POV. He left that free to interpret. So the show didnt damage anything, he just showed Jaimie forcing himself on Cersei. Why do you call that damage? This character never meant to be good, he pushed a kid out of the window, killed a king, has babies with his sister.Â 
Â 
What we saw was character developement in the show, no matter how cruel and disgusting the scene was. Book is the book and show is the show.
Â 
That is nonsense to give a lower rating to an episode because you didnt like the way they are developing the character. You should rate the way they showed it. I think that scene was very real and authentic, no matter how much innapropriate and wrong so Im giving it a high rating.

Yep and thats one of my fav plots from the book. Its just falling apart on the big screen.Â
183	Ran	2014-04-21	Volverin,George's POV remark is solely about the immediacy of understanding what's going on in Jaime's head whereas you can only try to decipher it by what you see on the screen. There's at least two paragraphs where he focuses on Cersei's desire and hunger for Jaime.

Â 
Even then I still don't understand the reactions. People should have realised long time ago the show is NOT the book. Instead of trying to enjoy it as an independent work people compare it to the books on every step of the way and find ways to criticize the show for not making everything like in the books.Â 
Â 
I read all the books of course and Im just very happy I can watch high class actors act out the main events from those books, no need to analyse every second of every episode.
Â 
For example only after Ive read on here that LF is creepy and is a bad actor Ive started paying attention to him more and finding problems with his performance where I didnt find them at all before. Thats not right.
186	Zeppelin	2014-04-21	Disappointed in this episode!
Â 
60 Seconds after Joffrey dies, Cersei and Tywin are wondering where Sansa is. Littlefinger now has an Irish accent to go with his creepy sleeziness. Jamie is a rapist! Sam and Gilly, could that have dragged that boring scene out any longer?!Â  Stannis ... ho hum boring!
Â 
Tywin and Tommen's exchange over Joffrey's body. I normally like everything Charles Dance/Tywin does, but I found that scene also dragged on too long. I can see the importance of this conversation, but I lost interest. As soon as I saw Daenerys strutting on her horse again, I thought oh no, not more. A cheesey wink and would she realistically be standing that close to a charging horse?!
Â 
I never thought i'd say this, but i'm also over Oberyn and his naked romp sex scenes. Ok, we get it, he's bi .... move on.
Â 
Highlights for me ..... Tyrion and Pod, I know it's not the same as the book, but it was a touching scene and appropriate for their relationship in the tv show. Tywin and Oberyn discussing and revealing more history. Arya and the Hound, there was some aspects I didn't quite like, but once again, some funny exchanges. "Just point out the next map shop and i'll buy you one"

Â 
When you obsess on a daily basis about ASOIAF, it's kinda hard to see the show in a different light and not compare it to the books. Personally, I've gotten better at separating the two, but they will never be fully separated. Unlike in the first two seasons, I have started with the 3rd season to appreciate the non-book stuff, but I still cheer and clap when a favorite scene from the books is well portrayed. So that's that.
188	rmholt	2014-04-21	What's worse is D&D don't think it's rapey.
189	Volverin	2014-04-21	I agree that it might be difficult for some people. I read all the books but I can't say Im obssesing over them on daily basis. I love the story but Im not involved in theory making and that stuff. For example I just found out there is a strong theory that Aegon is fake. I was pretty sure he was a real deal when I read it. Or a theory that Jon is a son of Lyanna, lol. Â 
Â 
And about the show - of course I too always get more excited when we see a scene which was in the book.
Â 
It might be a little my fault that I didnt take this under consideration. People who actually live this story might find it hard to seperate book and a show.
190	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-04-21	Gave this one a 6 - I saw it as a transitional episode and I found it a bit uneven in places.
Â 
I'm not going to join in the controversy over the J/C scene - I have my own thoughts about the layers and I certainly wasn't outraged. Â Let's move on.
Â 
What I liked:
Sansa's escape (Gillen notwithstanding - he's getting worse and has now become pantomimesque in his awfulness)
Sam and Gilly - can't understand why these two bore some viewers, but each to his own
Tywin/Tommen - and that gorgeous little quiver of the lip from Lena when Tywin said Joff was not a good king. Â At that one moment I felt for Cersei as the mother of a dead son and nothing else.
Jon finding some agency at long last
The return of Edd and the lads
Arya/Hound - 'Is he going to go through all seven of the fuckers?' was my line of the night
Tywin/Oberyn
Pod/Tyrion - saw Daniel Portman in the godawful Thronecast after the show and was astounded to hear the actor with a very strong Scottish accent. Â There's certainly no hint of it in the show. Â He's a lovely character and Daniel is playing him so well.
Dragonstone - it had Dillane in it, which is all I need  Â Love the relationship building with Shireen and Davos.
Â 
Indifferent
Olenna/Margaery it seemed that this scene had to be inserted to eliminate at least one suspect (Marg). Â In retrospect it might have been a bit better to leave these two until the next episode to keep up the suspense
Oberyn/Ellaria and friends - the sex in this show never bothers me - I've lived far too long to be offended by gratuitous sex on TV
Â 
Disliked
Styr - another caricature in the making. Â You see, there were characters in the books who I thought were caricatures (Vargo Hoat for instance) who have been made better on the show IMHO (Locke). Â Styr was a bit of a nondescript but honourable wildling (they all started to blur into one for me, I'm afraid) - but here they have worsened him. Â I don't think I'm going to be able to stand him for much longer. Â Pull it back, lad, for God's sake. Â 
Â 
Meereen - where do I begin? Â I am sorry, but I can't join in with those who believe that speaking in tongues improves Emilia. Â I loved her in Season 1. Â She has just been on a slippery slope ever since, although she did manage to find a bit of light and shade in her voice tonight. Â Even so, I am getting a tad tired of seeing Dany and her CGI'd hordes on some vast sanded ground giving the same speech and taking another city, and I am a Dany fan as a reader. Â On a good note, Meereen itself looked magnificent, and I guess the trick from Daario was OK, if underwhelming. Â The pissing contest was just as puerile as the piss/shit in the books - sorry they kept it in. Â I did think the trebuchets flinging broken slave collars was a nice touch though.
Â 
Hoping for a return to form next week.
191	Leto Atreides	2014-04-21	One of the worst epsiode since the show has been on.
Â 
Far too many departures from the book.

Â 
It has nothing to do with book vs. show. Â It has to do with killing off any interest I might have had in what happens to Jaime, in the show. Â If they kill him off in the next episode, I'd be delighted. Â I'd enjoy that almost as much as the purple wedding.
193	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-21	Maybe double D had to do something visually to help drive that wedge between Cersei and Jamie.  I didn't like the rape, didn't think it was needed, and it felt as if they tried to again make Cersei likable, but I completely disagree with character assassination of a sister fucking, child killing, stab a helpless dude in the back coward like Jamie Lannister.
194	Carey Snow	2014-04-21	1
Â 
They totally killed Jaime's arc by not having his sex scene with Cersei be consensual. Jaime is not a rapist and there was nothing in that scene that ever showed that Cersei consented like she clearly did in the books.
Â 
I did not like the change for the Hound either. In the books, he does not harm any of the villagers and leaves peacefully with his fairly earned wages. In this episode he just seems like a bully, which he really is not. Maybe they are going to set Arya up to save him somehow.
Â 
After the Cersei/Jaime scene, I just could not get into the Red Viper sex scene.
Â 
And is Sam really going to send Gilly to Mole Town's brothel? He would never even consider that.
Â 
Just really strange dark changes in this episode that I did not like, and I do not think they can save Jaime's arc now.

195	Carey Snow	2014-04-21	Volverin,
George's POV remark is solely about the immediacy of understanding what's going on in Jaime's head whereas you can only try to decipher it by what you see on the screen. There's at least two paragraphs where he focuses on Cersei's desire and hunger for Jaime.


Â 
Â 
Agreed. To quote the book:
Â 
"Hurry," she was whispering now, "quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime. Her hands helped guide him. "Yes," Cersei said as he thrust, "my brother, sweet brother, yes like that, yes, I have you, you're home now, you're home." She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair.
Â 
Obviously the above was not how the show did it. Now, maybe the show is trying to go a different direction with Jaime and Cersei and maybe I will come to respect it. But if they try to continue Jaime on the same arc as in the books than they blew it because it simply will not work.
Â 
The show Jaime is now clearly a rapist.
196	Carey Snow	2014-04-21	Â 
When you obsess on a daily basis about ASOIAF, it's kinda hard to see the show in a different light and not compare it to the books. Personally, I've gotten better at separating the two, but they will never be fully separated. Unlike in the first two seasons, I have started with the 3rd season to appreciate the non-book stuff, but I still cheer and clap when a favorite scene from the books is well portrayed. So that's that.


Â 
Also, just because you realize that the books and the shows are different, does not mean that you have to like the changes. Especially when Jaime's arc changed so dramatically.Â  Some book readers will like this change others will not.

198	Lady Isis Stark	2014-04-21	First time poster, long time reader. I've read the books multiple times. Love this forum.. Thanks for being so entertaining. 
To get this out of the way: re: Jaime and Cersi.  I'm shocked (proud!) they kept the scene in. Consent wasn't something they were clear about, to be sure. I am reminded how manipulative Cersi is. After weeks of cock-blocking Jaime, after years of being apart and celibacy ( for Jaime, anyway), it's Cersi who initiates the passionate embrace. This after pleading for vengeance. Then she rebuffs him after his fires are lit. He acknowledges he is cursed to love her but wants to hate-grieve-fuck her anyway. Pretty much on top of his dead son, while in church. There is so much 'wrong' with this scene that it's interesting to see how we focus on the consent part but miss the bigger picture. In the book I always felt like part of this scenes obscenity comes from the combined passion/grief of the two of them. In my world BookCersi was all over that. In the church on her dead son. 
Speaking of the books vs the show. When I love a story and characters, I read it over and over and feel as though I create the characters in my mind, their nuances and just how that shit would go down. My own mind is canon. So yes, Talisa bothered the fuuuuuuuck out of me.. When the show doesn't hold true to my mental image, there's dissonance and some people just can't deal. Even book canon can't be perfectly translated onto screen. 
LF is reminding me of Tom Cruise and not in a good way. His voice. LF must have taken up smoking. 
Marg and QOT: doughy lump. 
Tywin grooms Tomm so well. Hell, I'd trust Tywin after that speech. Breaking Robert down. I hope Jack had to sit there with those stones on his eyes. 
The Hound is a dog. The Worst Dog shit. How many Starks do they have to behead..
Sam is sweet but if no Mance-baby, why is Gilly still here? No. Other. Work.   More Bran!! 
Jon: he's got a little more fur on his balls. Finally. Red needs to die already. 
Stannis: why is Balon still alive !?! No medic-alert bracelet for him. He needs to fall and not get up. Go to the Wall already. 
Shirleen: that actress is growing fast. Davos line about how Stannis lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. Perfect Stanno description. 
Oh look! The swingers are swinging. At least show me a plump, round, man-bottom. Tywinn setting up a way to both appease Dorne and get rid of them, too. If they'd stop showing the soft-porn-Dorne, maybe we'd learn about those fantastic daughters. 
Tyrion: I want the God of Tits and Wine. Not 'Where the Red Fern Grows'. But only whatshernames name was mentioned.. We didn't have to hear her speak. To bear witness to the same redunkulous arguments. God. Send Pod to Brie. 
Rangers Returning. Fuck. Yes. 
Ug. Disclaimer: Dany is The Great White Savior at my house. I am so over her plot line. Not since Khal Drogo. And I love me some dragons but god she's so boring and stupid. I do like the broken collars as symbols though. Oh yea.. How silly are we that we get excited about a penis sighting? Even a prosthetic pissing penis is, what, progress in a sea of female full frontals? I hear South Park's: Wiener, wiener-wiener theme. Progress indeed.

199	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-21	What's worse is D&D don't think it's rapey.

What are you talking about? They say in so many words that he raped her if you watched their inside the episode interview.
200	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-21	One of the worst epsiode since the show has been on.
Â 
Far too many departures from the book.

Very thought provoking.
201	rmholt	2014-04-21	What are you talking about? They say in so many words that he raped her if you watched their inside the episode interview.

I saw it somewhere else I guess. No problem being wrong about that. Is that HBO? Still bad.
202	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-21	I saw it somewhere else I guess. No problem being wrong about that. Is that HBO? Still bad.

 Yes, HBO. I agree about it's being pretty bad. I'd like to play devil's advocate for second, but I hope I don't come off as insensitive. If there was no consent at all would Cersei really be ok being alone with him in the next episode? We left the scene in the middle of the act. Who knows how it ended.
203	doghouse	2014-04-21	I gave it a five. This was an episode that hyped us up for future events but won't have any actual memorable scenes once we get to the end of the season.Â
204	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-21	I gave it a five. This was an episode that hyped us up for future events but won't have any actual memorable scenes once we get to the end of the season.

What do you mean by memorable? There was no action? The plot didn't really change? Because I agree that neither of those two things occurred in this episode, but since the writing was fantastic, acting solid as usual, and the scenes seamlessly went from one to the other I really enjoyed it.
205	doghouse	2014-04-21	I mean that the events that precede this and the events that follow will be more memorable. The Samwell/Gilly scenes were cringe-worthy. The incest in the sept was not handled well although I do like GRRM's response to the outrage. I am also finished with Stannis pouting and doing nothing. I wouldn't rate the Tywin-Tommen interaction higher than the Tywin-Arya diologue but I like Tywin the grandfather just eviscerating Joffrey the King while Joffrey the Corpse was right there decaying. I liked the final scene with the chains but I agree with the people who don't like the new Dario. He looks just like everyone else. I know people didn't like the actor from Season three but he had a real hair metal throwback look that at least made him stand out.Â
206	Ryuho Martell	2014-04-22	-How many Dornish pornos are needed before we get that Oberyn is a passionate bisexual man.
Â 

+1 
He looks more like a perv than a cool Prince from Dorne.
Also, I wish they had included Strong Belwas in the show. But Daario worked fine for that scene. I may like thid new Daario better than the other one.
I give this episode a 7.
207	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-22	I liked the final scene with the chains but I agree with the people who don't like the new Dario. He looks just like everyone else. I know people didn't like the actor from Season three but he had a real hair metal throwback look that at least made him stand out.Â 


Yes that is the point. Daario is supposed to stand out with his ridiculous appearance in the books. Ed Skrein was able to stand out, the new Daario looks like poor man's Eric Bana with beard.Â

What did GRRM say? The director said it was not rape:http://www.ibtimes.c...roversy-1574209
After I read that article I made my mind up. If the director says it's not rape I think it's very irresponsible for people to keep saying it is. It's fine to say the director did a terrible job. People are just getting really heated over this scene when they think it wasn't consensual. And the purists are up in arms because now "Jamie's arc was ruined" when really it was just a directorial blunder not D&D destroying dogma.
209	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-22	Yes that is the point. Daario is supposed to stand out with his ridiculous appearance in the books. Ed Skrein was able to stand out, the new Daario looks like poor man's Eric Bana with beard.I KNEW I wasn't the only one thinking they were twins!
210	Cubarey	2014-04-22	Gave the episode an 8/9. the Jaime/Cersei sex scene came off quite close as I imagined it in my mind when I read it in the books. It was ambiguous as to whether it was consential. at times Cersei seemed to be fighting it at other times she seemed to be a willing participant and Jamie seemed not too concerned as to how Cersei was reacting (which is what I thought his reactions were in the book). All other scenes were good. Really do not see why people hated the Sam scenes they were sweet. Only thing that I thought was overdone was the Oberyn sex scene. We get it he is a very sexually active bisexual but really does he have to prove it in every scene he appears in?
211	Cubarey	2014-04-22	Gave it a 8/9. Liked the Jaime/Cersei sex scene came off like I remember reading it; ambiguous. Did not mind the Same scenes. Tyrian and Tywin scenes were excellent. The portrayal of Oberyn is getting a little bit over the top. Yes, he is an active bisexual, but does he have to prove it in every scene he appears in? LF accent is definately "stronger" then I remember it, but I liked the scene. Liked everything else, think the new Daario is a better actor but really think he would look better with blue hair.Â
212	Genre Monkey	2014-04-22	I gave this episode a 6 (after re-reading my episode critique, perhaps I should have given it a 7, but some of the things that bothered me about the episode, really rubbed me the wrong way). It was still better than most TV shows by a long shot, but judging it against the first two episodes of the season, this one felt the most disjointed to me. I just didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think it flowed as well as I wished it had.Hereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s some of what I enjoyed of the episode:
Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s escape was well done, and pretty much adhered to the book version. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m very glad to see Sansa get out of Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing. I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait to watch Sophie Turnerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s handling of the character going forward.
The scene between Tywin and Tommen was quite good, and concisely re-established Tommen as a major character. I also thought the actor playing Tommen did a nice job.
By Thor, I love the scenes between Arya and The Hound. Some of Maisieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s facial expressions throughout the scene were priceless. And Rory McCann keeps impressing me with his surliness, snot rockets and all.
Shireen and Davos were great together, as usual.
I thought some of the best acting of the episode was brought forth by the excellent Tyrion and Pod farewell scene.
The Wilding attack in my opinion was handled with aplomb. It was well shot (no pun intended) and contrary to what some might opine, I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t consider it too Lord of the Rings like. Pretty much any show placed in a fantasy setting resembling our own Medieval history will bear similarities when depicting warfare.The things I thought could have been improved in this episode:
I wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t feeling the Jamie forcing himself on Cersie scene. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t recall the book version being slanted in that direction. My wife, who out of the four of us watching, is the only non-reader of ASOIAF, really didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like that scene. She still holds a strong grudge against Jamie for pushing Bran out the window (which I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t blame her for, as she doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get the benefit of his POV later in the story), but she was coming around a bit to his slow redemption storyline. I think that rape scene under the dead body of their son, pretty much put her back on the I hate Jamie bandwagon.
I like Sam and Gilly, but I too thought the Sam and Gilly scenes could have been tighter. They just dragged, and brought the whole of the episode down a peg.
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve accepted the fact that weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re more than likely not going to get the character of Strong Belwas, but I was still hoping for a more spectacular fight between the Champion of Meereen and Daario. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think the whole Raiders of the Lost Ark like simplicity with which Daario took down The Champion of Meereen endeared new Daario to the fans like a well fought duel would have, but that is just my opinion.
Â
213	redriver	2014-04-22	Gave it a solid 8.Enough good scenes to out weigh the not so good ones.The production values remain outstanding.
Â 
On the Cersei/Jaime scene,I think Cersei was protesting about where they were "doing it" more than anything else,-repeating "Its not right".Much as I love the books,I didn't like this scene there either.
Â 
No one's complaining about Cersei requiring Jaime to kill Tyrion, I note.
214	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-22	I give a solid 6. And think that is a good thing. This was a completely aÂ set up ep (which GoT has not done much of), andÂ itÂ  really needed it to be one.Â Â There are many turns in most of the story lines, going forward, and they did a solid job of setting things up. They also did not try to go too big w/ this ep, and that too is a good thing.
Â 
Sansa/LF, Arya/ the Hound, Tommen/Tywin, Tyrion/ Pod,Â men of NW, Dany andÂ Wilding were all well done, (even w/ the messed up Thenn). Each storyline did what it was needed to do and did not try to over reach.
Â 
Sam/ Gilly was a bit too much, too soon, and took more time then it neededÂ at this point.
Â 
I still hate all of the Dragonstone storylines. They should have already happened last season, and doing them nowÂ just doesn't makeÂ a lot of sense to me. Davos did what he needed to do in ep 1, and they could skip this, and do other things that need more air time.
Â 
I am on the fence w/ the Cersei/Jaime. It might be the most brilliant thing they have done, but it just feels wrong. The have in short order flip-flopped them. It makes some sense,Â as show Jaime has not learned all that book Jaime did before this scene. TheyÂ have had the riff between them, and it has been growing, but is theÂ moment between them. I think they can nowÂ move forward in the story, w/o having to change anything they have already set up. It might cause some problems in a few season, but nothing anytime soon.

Â 
I won't complain - because it's really clear that Cersei's in grief and desparation. Of course she accuses her valonqar once again because she holds him responsible for The Joff's death.
Â 
And she wants Jaime to do it - not as her twin but as a member/LC of the King's Guard.
Â 
But we can certainly discuss this elsewhere I suppose.Â
217	The Killer Snark	2014-04-22	I don't want to stir the waters, really, on the consensual or not thing re: Cersei and Jaime, but I need to excuse myself. On the thread I saw about this subject, I immediately thought the OP was making a reference to something that happened in the novels, so I immediately voted with just the word 'No'. On this board before, I've heard people opine with such nuggets as 'Ygritte raped Jon' and 'Lysa raped Petyr.' In these PC days of dangerous collectivist and bureacratic over-authority, people's definitions of many words have ludicrously broadened or altered, and among the most dangerous of those broadenings from a gender-relation point of view is to the word 'rape.' So I thought, "Here we go again", and just stuck a 'No' down to the OP's question. Then I watched the episode and saw where they were coming from, because there isn't really any getting away from the fact the sex is forced and not wholly consensual, so Jaime effectively does commit rape, or at least it's hair-length borderline. There's no indication anywhere that their sex lives have ever been based on such domination long before.
Â 
So, the questions are...was it really necessary to portray it, and was it a 'character assassination', to use the board cliche, and should it hinder my full marks to the episode? My answer is that I think the writers and director did the best they could with some problematic alterations to the context of the characters which have been long running in previous episodes. I'll explain:
Â 
1. Jaime's story arc has been rushed through since the third season. He's reached King's Landing too early, and went through a character redemption arc too soon. Even in the novels, the speed of his moral about-face takes a little suspension of disbelief to get used to. In the show it takes a bit more, for the reason that I've mentioned, so they had to show that in certain psychic areas he's still fundamentally conflicted and flawed,
Â 
2. Cersei has for a while now been treated over-sympathetically. In the novels, of course, the distance between Cersei and Jaime is drawn further with Jaime's refusal to commit further incest as soon as he starts taking his Kingsguard vows more seriously. Not so in earlier episodes, so they had to do their best leading on from debatable earlier decisions and draw the wedge between them another way. Since she's more victimised against and more sane than she is in the novels, they have to give her some pretext for her imminent ' batshit evil Cersei' psychological collapse. It's not the route I would have taken with either character, but what happened in the episode was in keeping with the context of the show.
Â 
Apologies if I'm retreading old ground that other folk have trod too much already. I'm simply justifying why, with my customary nits against series changes to plotting and context, I'm not worried about this role reversal in the series. I'm actually more pissed off at the hamfisted way the prior episodes have sympathised Shae.
218	Young Biff	2014-04-22	7/10 Â Â 
Â 
1. Sex scene with Oberyn was too long
Â 
2. I loved the Thenns scene, but it was too, "Lord of the Ringish" and doesn't fit into ASOIAF/GOT
Â 
3. The Duel scene was great . . . Â  but I miss Strong Belwas . . . Â  Â 
Â 
4. Everything else was solid, except for Sam sending Gilly to a filthy brothel to raise a kid. Â Dumb Sam!

Â 
One of my favourite episodes in the show's run up to this point. They got everything right except the Cersei-Jaime scene. Apart from Kissed by Fire, it was the perfect set-up episode.
221	The Killer Snark	2014-04-22	For me, the only problem was the Sam and Gilly scenes. They weren't bad, and they were sensitive to the novels, but they simply dragged a little and arrived a bit too soon.
222	The Anti-Targ	2014-04-22	So now Jaime is a rapist! screw that. Serious marks off for such character abuse. I see no justification for that. I can see they needed to create significant estrangement between Jaime and Cersei, but making him rape Cersei was a quick and cheap solution and simply showed a lack of creativity. Awful decision.
Â 
I didn't much like Hound steraling the silver either, but it was a slightly more understandable, and a little less character destroying way to drive Arya back to hating him.
Â 
For an otherwise reasonably episode those negatives drop the episode down to 5/10 for me. The Danny ending was a tad weak, and hardly a cliffhanger, but it moved her story forward a bit. And she does an amazing job Monologuing in High Valyrian
223	growflet	2014-04-22	The whole Jamie/Cersei rape scene really bothered me. Â 
I just went back and reread the chapter In the books and watched that scene on HBO go.
Â 
In the book:
Cersei initiates with a kiss, and Jamie turns into a ball of lust. Â  Â 
Reading that chapter it is made clear:
1) Cersei wants to do this thing, but isn't giving consent initially because of where they are and fear of getting caught.
2) Before he has sex with her she literally says "quickly, do it now, do me now". Â Literally. Â At that point you have unambiguous consent.Â 
Afterward, she chastises him "that was folly, what if we got caught".
What is not clear, is that if she hadn't swapped to "yes yes yes omg yes" - would Jamie have stopped.
Â Â 
On the show Jamie initiates and Cersei does kiss him. Â But then puts up major resistance
Just like a mother over her dead child would. We see no desire from Cersei at all.
With subtitles on you see: Â "no, no, no, stop, please Jamie don't" Â (crying)
She was actually crying as he did that to her. Â  That kind of makes it kind of unforgivable.
Â Â 
His next paragraph in the book was to propose marriage, damn the world, let them be together.
Â 
This is bothersome to me because Jamie starts out as a bad guy. Â 
You learn he does what he does for love and his sense of honor and start to like him. Â 
Â 
I actually liked that GRRM ended up making me like a character I hated at the start.
Â 
In raping her like that they've basically taken all that character growth away from him.
Â 
Of course, the director does not think that scene was rape at the end. Â So.... Yeah.
Maybe the director sees the two versions of the scenes as the same. Â That's disturbing.
Â 
Anyhow.
Â Â 
Tywin was awesome, as usual. Â Especially with Tommen.
Â 
I agree with others, the Sam scenes were somewhat meh. Â Â 
Â 
The Dany scene at the end was rather awesome, that bumped it past a 6 for me. Â  I give it a 7.
I liked the guy holding up the collar, you knew what was coming next.

Re: Jaime's changes in Breaker of Chains
This is off topic here. This is the section for comments about Junot Diaz and Anne Perry and the Cocteau's author program.
Since a lot of people have been emailing me about this, however, I will reply... but please, take any further discussion of the show to one of the myriad on-line forums devoted to that. I do not want long detailed dissections and debates about the TV series here on my blog.
As for your question... I think the "butterfly effect" that I have spoken of so often was at work here. In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffrey's death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself, that she has lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before her. Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her.Â 
The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and he and Cersei have been in each other's company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why Dan & David played the sept out differently. But that's just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.Â 
Also, I was writing the scene from Jaime's POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You don't know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing.Â 
If the show had retained some of Cersei's dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression -- but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline.
That's really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing... but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.
Now, if you please, I'd appreciate it if we could get back to Junot Diaz and Anne Perry and the subjects of the original post.
228	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-22	Aside from the Sept rape, and LF's bizarre changing accent and OTT acting, it was good.
229	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-22	I gave it an 8, without the rape scene and if they would have shortened Sam's scene and given more of that to Jon Snow - it would have been a solid 9 and maybe 10. Â It was overall an excellent episode - just really wish they would have rethought that rape scene. Yuck!

The lack of available thoughts (both during and looking back on scenes from characters) is a big obstacle, but TV directors should know this. Show, don't tell, and if you show rape, that's what the audience will see
231	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-22	I don't know how many times I can say this. Jamie is NOT a rapist!!!!

Â 
The director said it was consensual. Just read the last paragraph of this article:

It's fair to criticize the director, but to call Jamie something he's not, because the director screwed up is unfair.Â 
Â 
BTW, Ser Arthur Heath, is that a picture of Cuthbert???

237	Abaddon	2014-04-22	I struggled but finally gave it an eight.Â  Was leaning towards seven strictly on the horrible, terrible, awful rape scene.Â  Honestly, that really soured the whole episode for me.Â  Otherwise I thought it was good to great.
238	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-22	I mean that the events that precede this and the events that follow will be more memorable. The Samwell/Gilly scenes were cringe-worthy. The incest in the sept was not handled well although I do like GRRM's response to the outrage. I am also finished with Stannis pouting and doing nothing. I wouldn't rate the Tywin-Tommen interaction higher than the Tywin-Arya diologue but I like Tywin the grandfather just eviscerating Joffrey the King while Joffrey the Corpse was right there decaying. I liked the final scene with the chains but I agree with the people who don't like the new Dario. He looks just like everyone else. I know people didn't like the actor from Season three but he had a real hair metal throwback look that at least made him stand out.Â 

He looks like Eric Bana to me and someone said it earlier that scene was straight out of Indiana Jones and morphed with a Lord of the Rings scene.  The only thing missing was Legolas sliding off the nose of the horse at the end.

Yeah OK but the number of people on here who give a GoT episode, even the sub par ones (and there have been a few) automatic 8s, 9s and 10s is ridiculous. I thought the first episode was solid, the last two have been pretty weak. They've been a bit labored at times, especially the KL scenes. Episode 2 depiction of the PW was just flat and disapointing, I'd had it built up in my head as something majestic, opulent to the extreme, decadent and outrageous, instead we got a pleasant garden party with dwarves, just poor. This episode seemed to meander along with no real point. We had at the end of the last season, or so I thought, Davos setting up Stannis riding north to the wall, but no that's all been forgotten as he is slapped in the face with a plot device to involve the Iron Bank and the Golden Company...great. Then we have Littlefinger doing his best impersonation of a 1920s screen villain, at one point I thought he was going to twirl his waxed moustache I kid you not. Saving grace was Sandor and Tywins scenes, which involved two really good actors making the most of what they'd been given.Â 
Â 
And really? The best thing on TV? Compared to the cinematic brilliance of True Detective, six minute tracking shots and all. Anything comparable in GoT? Howsabout the brilliant dialogue and stylistic flourish of Mad Men? GoT is not shit, it's OK and sometimes it's really good, but it's also over hyped and at times displays lazy writing and direction.Â

Sister fucker, coward, backstabber, child murderer and child neglecter, worst kings guard ever, of course.   But not a rapist.
241	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-22	I honestly think people are too harsh on some of the actors- Emilia, Kit (not so much so far) and Aiden.
Â 
Emilia- Really does a fantastic job with the Valyrian dialogue and is written to be seen asÂ a Badass. She also nails the intense Dany gazes from the books. In Season 1 she did great with playing vulnerable Dany but hasn't been given the material to show that again...the show are really playing the Badass card with her (unsullied viewers dig that) and she nails that.Â The only scene where I haven't been impressed was her facial expression during the Dead slave girl pointing the way to Mereen.
Â 
Kit- Granted people aren't moaning as much about this one but the 'he has got better at acting' comments are grating. He is supposed to be allÂ emo and he did really good withÂ sullen Jon is Season 1. His portrayal sufferedÂ at points inÂ season 3 but I would say that was more down to the writing and soppy love scenes. I think some people just can't see past pretty boy Jon as opposed to his book counterpart.Â Also, he isÂ only getting into his authoritative/badass Jon stuff and so far Kit is doingÂ great with it. He portrays more confidence in his voice but looks under heavy burden if you watch closely. Admittedly, I've moaned about how we haven't seen any Stark grief from JonÂ (yet and vocally at least)Â but from his posture you canÂ tell he is troubled/exhausted.
Â 
Aiden- His accent marks him out as sly and dangerous which really suits Littlefinger.
Â 
Anyway, these points aside. Charles Dance was excellent in this episode...I couldn't imagine anyone elseÂ playing Tywin!

Where did you get all this?
243	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-22	Sister fucker, coward, backstabber, child murderer and child neglecter, worst kings guard ever, of course. But not a rapist.


Â 
Sister Fucker- yes, that one is obvious. Also add in the fact that his sister is married to the King he serves so 'Worst Kings Guard' ever also links into this one.
Â 
Coward and Backstabber- Killing the mad King proved that he wasn't a coward, he saved hundreds of people while betraying his King and facing possible punishment and scorn. That was very brave and I'm not sure some of the other Kingsguard would have done such a thing. Yes, he backstabbed Aerys but thatÂ is perfectly justifiable in my opinion. He was never really loyal/friendly with Robert in the first place...so liar or disloyalÂ would be more appropriate for this one. I think a 'backstabber' suggests a true bond of trust or loyalty that is broken, making it very personal. He never had this with Robert, it was all a farce before it even began- any man who married Cersei would never have his full loyalty.
Â 
Child murderer- Granted he was trying to kill Bran. Although, he has changed since then.
Â 
Child neglecter- He was in no position to act all fatherly towards his kids seeing as that would be odd and raise suspicion, possibly leading to their deaths. I also think he wants to be their father- suggested when he wanted to marry Cersei.
Â 
Worst Kings Guard ever- True...towards Aerys and Robert.
Â 
On the show-
Â 
Rapist- He did rape Cersei which also makes him a hypocrite when he saves Brienne from being raped.
Â 
Kinslayer- He kills his cousin
Â 
It makes me wonder why they even bothered cutting out the "Jaime Lannister sends his regards" line .
Â 
IÂ think Jaime is officially their model 'grey' character which doesn't bother me but it does when Cersei is being cleaned up at Jaime's expense.

245	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-22	Where did you get all this?
Sisterfucker he does sleep with his sister and has children with her, children he has neglected.  A lot of that is because of fear of Robert I get that, and throne legitimacy I get that, but he isn't even a decent uncle.  
Coward, having all your goons surround Ned Stark and kill off all his men isn't cowardly?  Pushing a child out of a window isn't cowardly?  Being part of the family that had to use deceit and false accusations to murder a king and his mother and their entire crew under the guise of guest right isn't cowardly?
Child killer - guess i should have said attempted, my bad.  
Worst kings guard ever, how many kings have died with him as a member?  3 so far?  Not a great record.
The point is why get bent out of shape when he rapes Cersei.  The guy is a despicable human being to begin with.  It's like Vic Mackey.

Wow. You made up your mind about all of this regardless of what's happening in the book? Good for you.
247	marsyao	2014-04-22	Here is GRR Martin's comment about this rape scene, sum up, all he says here is "I have nothing to do with this scene"
Â 
"This is off topic here. This is the section for comments about Junot Diaz and Anne Perry and the Cocteau's author program.
Since a lot of people have been emailing me about this, however, I will reply... but please, take any further discussion of the show to one of the myriad on-line forums devoted to that. I do not want long detailed dissections and debates about the TV series here on my blog.
As for your question... I think the "butterfly effect" that I have spoken of so often was at work here. In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffrey's death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself, that she has lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before her. Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her.
The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and he and Cersei have been in each other's company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why Dan & David played the sept out differently. But that's just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.
Also, I was writing the scene from Jaime's POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You don't know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing.
If the show had retained some of Cersei's dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression -- but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline.
That's really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing... but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.
Now, if you please, I'd appreciate it if we could get back to Junot Diaz and Anne Perry and the subjects of the original post."

Â 
Interesting, I haven't seen it in full. Thanks for posting this! 
Â 
People keep using the "she is as hungry for him as he is for her" part toÂ argue the show scene wasn't a rapeÂ but GRRM is clearly establishing the two scenes being different.
249	Three sisters	2014-04-22	I give it an 8. The episode is well acted and well executed. The music score is of high quality, and so are the costumes and decors.Â 
Â 
I reread the second part of SoS recently, and HBO sticks to the story mostly. Even the Cersei/Jaime scene is kinda like the book depicted. Minus the moon blood detail though.Â 
Â 
The only thing is that GoT is going really fast, faster then I thought they would, and I think the series will overtake the books at some point. Although I like the tempo, I would like to finish the books first.Â

Â 
The point is not whether the scenes are different. I think most of us agrees with this. Rather, the concern is whether Jaime will still be an interesting character in the show, at least for the non-readers. I can't tell yet. My friends clearly though it was rape, but I am not sure if they felt bad about it. They were more shocked by the fact that it happened next to Joffrey's coffin.
Â 
The same applies to every difference from the books. Often, people complain about the differences and not about their impact in the quality of the show. Or at least, people often measure the quality of the show in terms of its distance from the books. We can have a good show even if the story and characters are not strictly the same. The main events are there. As for the characters, I am more conservative about deviations, but changing the motives of a character, like they did with Stannis, does not ruin the character for me entirely, as long as ultimately he behaves in a similar fashion to the books.

251	flamingothegreen	2014-04-22	I give the episode a solid 7.
Â 
Â 
What I liked:
- Tywin/Tommen - I really like Tommen's character so far and I'm definitely glad that they recast him considering how young the last actor was. Tywin is great as per usual - he's one of those characters I try to dislike since I feel like I should, but actually really like anyway. ._.
- Hound/AryaÂ - they always amuse me and I really like that the Hound is still there for now. c: One of the things I love about the Hound is how he sees things. It's not some bullshit act he tries to keep, and IÂ really respect that. While the host was a nice one and I felt bad that the Hound stole from him (darn you Hound!), I still like how the Hound was able to rationalize his actions - and there was truth in what he said.
- Tywin/Oberyn - just...two awesome people being awesome together. I really like Oberyn so far.
- LF/Sansa - nice and creepy, and LF showing how he really is in front of Sansa.
- Sam/Gilly - I think they're adorable and not boring at all .
- Jon - surprisingly, I actually enjoyed the scene with Thorne. I usually don't like Jon in his scenes and I thought it was cool that Thorne actually asked for his opinion about the matter.
- Wildling Raid - Thennnnnnnns!
- Shireen - 'cause she's cute. ._.
- Tyrion/Pod - not so much Tyrion in this scene, but I'm a sucker for Pod. Made me a bit sad even.
Â 
What I disliked:
- other than Dany being able to speak her languages well, I disliked the whole Mereen scene (though I loved the look of the city itself). I don't like Dany as a character to begin with, and the whole thing seemed bland to me. Daario was less than cool and the champion fight was...too smooth, too fast - and totally not cool that he returned the piss. (also - catapults of shackles...why would they do that when it could have easily killed some of the slaves?)
- the rest of the Oberyn scene (totally lied about the no more hot scenes with Oberyn!). It's cool that he's very passionate and they recognize that, but it was just too much.
- the Hound's violation of his own code. Though his reasoning is fine imo, I don't like how they made him contradict himself. That seems out of character for me and gives me a few sads.
- Jaime/Cersei - well, it's not because it's poorly done or differs from the book (in both cases, it's rape that turns somewhat conensual) but that it was just creepy. Not the kind of creepy I like either.
- Stannis/Davos - well, it was just too fast for my liking. I barely even remembered the scenes, even the one with Shireen, until I read a comment regarding them. I really like the Stannis story and would like to see non-fleeting scenes with him and Davos.
Â 
Eugh, that's what I remember. I still have to rewatch the episode though.
252	TimEaston	2014-04-22	I enjoyed it I can't wait until the next episode.Â 
Â 
I am disappointed that a as usual the women were shown fully naked but the men were only showed from behind.

You are absolutely entitled to be disappointed in the PW, or disagree with the way Littlefinger is being portrayed.Â  But, I don't recal you giving the episode a 2, either.
Â 
But, you make my point for me.Â  I watched one episode of "True Detectives" and vowed never to waste my time with another second.Â  As a person who likes Woody Harrelson and loves (man-crush) Matthew McConaughey, I thought it was a big piece of dog-doo.Â  While we may disagree, I am not going to go on any blogs for the show and paint with those same broad strokes because I have an axe to grind, or it did not meet my expectations.Â  I don't like the show, I won't comment on their blog (if they even have one).
Â 
I like GoT, I have my own disappointments, and surprise likes, but I won't waste your time with scathing venom and rash generalizations.Â  Or, even more amusingly, list ten things I hated and give the episode an 8.Â
254	boojam	2014-04-22	- Wildling Raid - Thennnnnnnns!You liked the one thing that I thought was the worst thing!Inside the Episode have Dave and Dan spouting some nonsense about that sequence.

All that is in the book.
258	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-22	Is this episode the one with the least canon content to date?
Â 
Tyrion capture, Sansa escape, Cersei/Jamie, events at Meereen were 'basically canon'
Â 
Everything else? Arya and the Hound, Sam + Gilly x 2, Night's Watch, Tywin/Tommen, Tywin/Oberyn, Team Dragonstone = not canon.

					
					
							Edited by Ser Desmond Wine's Bane, 22 April 2014 - 05:09 PM.
259	Andros Sotherton	2014-04-22	I thought this was the weakest episode of the series thus far.Â  Too many stupid clumsy things.Â  Dany stands directly behind Daario while a mounted man charges at him?Â  Yeah so much for not risking the important people!Â  Sure they wanted to have the two of them in the shot together and have him turn and do his little wink, but that was idiotic.Â  This one didn't have that sense of being "well done" for me.Â  I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.


Â 
The whole thing is off. When they film her standing behind Daario the attacker must be coming straight from Meereen. Look at how the Unsullied stands in the background. But when they film the champion and when he is died his charge came from the side. Weird...Â
260	m'arya'n	2014-04-22	6. Nothing really happened.other than Samwell/Gilly and Arya/Sandor, I enjoyed the other story lines alot. especially Tyrion/Podrick scene. Also, quite excited for sansa, I hope she has a more interesting story from here on!!!
261	Bonifer Tasty	2014-04-22	Â 
So there is no problem at all! GRRM said himself he doesnt know if book Jaimie raped Cersei or not because it was a POV. He left that free to interpret. So the show didnt damage anything, he just showed Jaimie forcing himself on Cersei. Why do you call that damage? This character never meant to be good, he pushed a kid out of the window, killed a king, has babies with his sister.Â 
Â 


Â 
I have often ended up in disputes here on this board with people over issues of what was going on, and I eventually realized that in the majority of cases (as with Sansa, or Tyrion, or Catelyn) the dispute was basically centered on my reading of the POV as biased (as written by Martin to provide an interpretation by the specific character) while the person who disagreed with me saw the narrative as pure reportage, to be relied upon. Â I'm not sure why some people can't appreciate the layered treatment of the POV structure. Â It is clear that Tyrion, as witty as he is, describes things in such a way as to make himself the victim (and yes, sometimes he really IS the victim!), and Catelyn's chapters are increasingly written as though by a person succumbing to depression, including her "stupidity" that people so often hate, she is increasingly detached from real events. Â Cersei's POV is riddled with alcoholic misperception. Â Sansa's with a shocking self-centeredness. Â Etc. Â It's one reason to love the books! Â  And Martin is basically saying in the interview he gave on the "rape" that Jaime was the POV and Jaime would never have perceived that event as a rape, no matter what really transpired. Â

263	rmholt	2014-04-22	I saw it somewhere else I guess. No problem being wrong about that. Is that HBO? Still bad.

Or I confused them with Graves.

Seems to be some divergence of opinion in this threat about that.

I know the AV Club had a nice critique of the Jaime - Cersei scene. Perhaps, like for me, one scene gone terribly awry was offset for some by the greatness of the rest.
265	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-22	I gave this episode a four. I loved the scenes with Shireen, Tommen, and Jon. The rest was a bit of a fail for me, and too loose an interpretation for my taste.
Â 
Emilia Clarke's acting was pretty bad in episodeÂ  2, but she seemed to be better this time... she is so good at learning how to speak the languages, you can see she is putting a lot of effort into it, and it shows. I'm glad to see some authenticity in the shows at least. Trying to look on the bright side.
266	Starry	2014-04-23	I gave it a 4. Liked the scenes with Daenarys and Tommen.
Â 
With the rest I was disappointed.
Â 
Jamie/Cersei scene was poorly handled in my opinion.
Â 
In the books the Lannisters didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in the existance of the dragons. In the show Tywin tries to get the Dornish on his side with telling Oberyn about Danaerys and the dragons. But why should the Dornish help to protect the Lannister claim to the Iron Throne against Dany. It would be logic if the Dornish would support Danaerys to throw down House Lannister. (Did they not have a spare room in the Red Keep. Oberyn seems to live at the brothel.)
Â 
I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like the wildling attack on the village. The wildlings in the show come accross like monsters. Most of all the Thenns. I never understood them as cannibals in the books. In the show they feast on whole villages.
Â 

	Spoiler How could Jon admit cannibals behind the wall? They would eat all people at Castle Black and then the whole realm. 

Â
267	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-23	A 5 for me. I expected a fallout from a big event episode to be a bit of a come down, but there was a few extra bits that wasn't working for me either.
Â 
Negative
- Jaime/Cersei rape scene was terribly handled and not how it is supposed to or should have gone down. Discussed at length in another topic so don't need to get into it.
- The Sam/Gilly scenes were crap quite frankly.
- Stannis/Davos was not that riveting and unless you've read the books I think Davos realising to use the Iron Bank to help Stannis' cause would have gone over a lot of people's heads. The "not enough men to raid a pantry" line was great though (finally more of Stannis dry wit!), and Davos' general grumpyness when he first starts his reading lesson was funny. But not enough to save those scenes.
- Never thought I'd say this but too much Tywin talking this week. Great they brought Tommen straight into it, but that Tywin lesson about what makes a great king went for too long, especially considering he had another long (but more necessary) convo with Oberyn later.Â 
- Dany. Please stop trying to make everything she does epic D&D, that catapulting the broken chains thing was lame.
Â 
Positive
- Hound/Arya. Knowing that not much happens with these two until Arya leaves for Braavos was a bit of a concern coming into this season. But once again just really funny stuff. The way Maisie delivered that line of 'you are, the biggest SHIT! in Westeros' was just amazing. Could watch these two all day.
- Wildings raid and warning to Night's watch. Brutal and just what we needed to realise they need to be taken seriously so we are invested in the upcoming battle at Castle Black.
- Tyrion/Pod. That was a sweet scene.

Â 
A lot of late voters have had more than one watch and picked up on more details and potential inconsistencies. Perhaps this is a cause for the drop,
Â 
I have heard podcasts from Unsullied who have described it as the best non-Ep 9 episode yet. It also appears to the episode with highest level of non-canon content. This could be a reason why it has been marked lower by so many readers.
Â 
Disclosure: I gave it a 7 and voted before I rewatched the episode

Not really. What counts are the unsullied viewers, not ASOIAF obsessed readers like our mad lot here. People show a high level of conservatism and devotion to the cannon, but we see that D&D managed so far to tie back all the canonical knots they untied. However, I think Jaime/Cersei scene was the one to bring the overall rating down. And for a good reason, because if Jaime's "rape" is not explained, his whole redemption arc is in serious jeopardy. D&D risk being mobbed by Jaime fans. :-)

So, we all like to say this show doesn't have good and bad characters, that all of them are grey.... and yet, we expect to see a traditional "evil conflicted guys gets a redemption arc and becomes pure and perfect" story?
I'm tired of all the discussion on that scene (from such a modern angle), but I will say that I'm glad they haven't made Jaime a purely good character.

Well, I'm not saying this as a fan of Jaime. I say this, because the sept scene did damage his book arc. Hence, the reaction of the book connoisseurs. Jaime is not a purely good character in the books, but meeting Brienne and losing his hand changed him profoundly. All I said that, if the rape scene is not explained in the future episodes, Jaime in the show will turn into another Shae - quite a different character from the one in the books. Different, not necessarily better or worse.
277	Queen of Whores	2014-04-23	You are absolutely entitled to be disappointed in the PW, or disagree with the way Littlefinger is being portrayed.Â  But, I don't recal you giving the episode a 2, either.
Â 
But, you make my point for me.Â  I watched one episode of "True Detectives" and vowed never to waste my time with another second.Â  As a person who likes Woody Harrelson and loves (man-crush) Matthew McConaughey, I thought it was a big piece of dog-doo.Â  While we may disagree, I am not going to go on any blogs for the show and paint with those same broad strokes because I have an axe to grind, or it did not meet my expectations.Â  I don't like the show, I won't comment on their blog (if they even have one).
Â 
I like GoT, I have my own disappointments, and surprise likes, but I won't waste your time with scathing venom and rash generalizations.Â  Or, even more amusingly, list ten things I hated and give the episode an 8.Â  


Â 
May I ask what you hated so much about True Detective? I've seen a lot of "excellent" TV, as some would say, like The Wire, The Sopranos, Deadwood, etc, and I honestly thought the first four episodes* were some of the most flawless TV I've ever seen in my life, and normally I'm a very critical person when it comes to TV and films. Also, even if you didn't like the storyline or pacing, I find it hard to believe anyone that's watched both Game of Thrones and True Detective (especially the six minute long-take in episode 4) can say Game of Thrones is better directed. Cary Fukunaga (the director of all of True Detective's first season) is leagues better than any director on Game of Thrones, imho.
Â 
* The show steadily started losing steam and brilliance in episodes 5 and 6, and episodes 7 and 8 were pieces of shit, in my opinion, at least compared to the first half the season, but the first half is incredible beyond just about anything I've seen on TV.

279	Neumond	2014-04-23	I gave a 5 because it is still better than most tv-series but it really felt like a weak episode to me. (At least in comparison to other episodes of this show.) I have the feeling the show is now just jumping from one bloodbath (or rape-club-session) to another. I really miss some base-work on character development or story telling... But this is of course, just my opinion.

Hey, but once again, the issue seems to be "it's different from the books" rather than "they ruined the show-character!".
Â 
Meeting Brienne changes Jaime, and that's apparent in the show. Does that mean he becomes a purely good character who would never do anything bad? No. Thankfully, he's still a realistic conflicted and morally ambiguous character who's trying to figure out what's right and wrong.
Â 
I can't understand how "having sex with his sister in front of their son's corpse" doesn't damage his redepmtion arc in the books, but "forcing his sister to have sex with him in front of their son's corpse" is suddenly so much worse in the show.
We are talking about a very conflicted relationship with a lot of anger, hatred, spite and narcisism, not an ideal love story.
And this doesn't mean I hate Jaime. I don't like or love characters depending on how badass or how evil they are. I like characers because they are complex and interesting.

Â 
IMHO, the average ratings of episodes, specially when they belong to different seasons, are not comparable. I don't think much people really believes "Breaker of Chains" is the worst episode of the series. I'm convinced voters are not maintaing consistent ratings among seasons, as there is no any indication about how episodes should be evaluated: what's a 5? an average GoT episode? an average TV episode? an average episode of an HBO show? a weak episode that still gets a pass because its my favorite show in TV? an episode that met my expectations? ...
Â 
Myself, I'm surely evaluating episodes from those past two seasons much harsher than in the first ones. At the beginning, I was excited just with the great scenarios and casting. Now, I take those things for granted and my expectations are much higher.

I think that's a fair point. If everyone was rating each episode in comparison to how they would rate episodes of other tv shows then i'm sure each episode would be getting 9's and 10's. Expectations are obviously pretty high now, but we also have 3 seasons worth of episodes to now compare against, so I believe every rating these days is a fair rating. In season 1 every episode would probably have been given a higher score than it would now simply due to the excitement that this series is being made so well.

Though to be honest, that episode was probably brought up by the Joff hype so maybe, when all is said and done, there we were closer to the truth.

You seem quick to blame supposed book purists getting whiny over changes, and yet you don't consider the real reason it was rated low by some was maybe because of how boring and unnecessarily long and pointless some scenes were (Sam and Gilly), or how rushed and underdeveloped others were (Stannis and Davos). The entire final scene outside Meereen was weirdly directed and edited, and this episode also featured another pointless brothel scene that doesn't develop Oberyn any further than "hey remember how this guy is bisexual and sexually active? Yeah... he still is...". Characters like Jaime and Sandor acted randomly out of character, and some glaring continuity errors popped up, like how Sansa and Dontos leave the wedding in the middle of a perfectly clear warm day, and it's foggy and night in a couple of minutes. 
These kind of things are also detractors for an episode's overall quality. Don't get so defensive before you consider other things apart from "hardcore book fans" and this "crazy overblown internet faux-outrage." While I wouldn't say this was the worst episode of the series (that 'honour' goes to The Bear and the Maiden Fair), and not even the worst of the season (that'd be The Lion and The Rose in my opinion), it was definitely in my top ten least favourite episodes of the series.

Â 
I'm not certain on which points you and I are in disagreement. You said yourself it's not the worst episode of the series. I said the same.Â 
Â 
As for internet faux-outrage, well, it is. Do you think mainstream media care one bit about Jaime's character arc and the supposed damage to it? Do you think they protest because Jaime raping Cersei means the show condones rape, glamorizes and romanticizes it? That this, after all the shit that has happened on the show, is somehow the most morally reprehensible act we've ween? No. They jumped on the bandwagon because they saw the potential for clickbait. Just look at the dates of the published online material. The media outlets had these episodes for weeks in advance. Almost no one made a big fuss over the scene. Actually, many respectable critics noted the interesting deviation from the books and expressed interest in how it will turn out. Then the net explodes in outrage and suddenly everyone publishes articles on inappropriateness of the scene. So, yeah, where media and the internet culture are concerned, it's faux-outrage, an opportunity to stand on a soapbox and show just how progressive they all are. Then they can pat each other on the back and sayÂ mission accomplished.

The internet frenzy is really dumb, yes, and I too hate how people are parading around their "anti-rape" views like it makes them some kind of hero. I'm not in disagreement with you there. But other stuff, like the actual characterization of Stannis, Jaime and Sandor has been very weak and random these past couple of episodes, and fans of the characters have the right to be annoyed at the show screwing around with perfectly fine characters that have been developed rather well until this point (well, except Stannis).
291	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-23	My ratings so far:
Ep 1: 6.
Ep 2: 6.
Ep 3: 7.
Â 
So i personally feel this was the strongest of the first three episodes.Â

Â 
Oh I agree that fans have every right to voice their displeasure if they don't like something.Â 
Â 
Though, I must say that I don't agree with your points on Stannis, Jaime, and Sandor. I won't reiterate my thoughts on Jaime (I've done it enough already on these boards); I'll just say that in my view this was a very brutal and ugly turn of events that was nevertheless grounded in established Jaime-Cersei dynamics and I am quite interested to see how the writers will address this in the future. I truly don't think that this amounts to character assassination derailing Jaime's Redemption TrainÂ<U+0099>. Writers definitely took a big gamble and we have yet to see how it'll turn out. I am intrigued by the narrative prospects of this decision. Let me leave it at that.
Â 
As for Sandor, I'm not sure what the problem is. He was always a hard and brutal man. The first thing we see of him is when he kills a defenseless boy for running away. He's one of Martin's most complex creations and I don't doubt for a second that he's able to club some peasant over the head if there's motivation enough. Yeah, in 4x01 there was that cool man's gotta have a codeÂ line, but I saw that as simple a funny retort to Arya's point, not as the acknowledgement that he's this uber-principled man that never stoops to theft. Sandor's and Arya's scenes this episode are really great in my opinion, revealing a fantastic character dynamic between these two unlikely "partners".
Â 
On Stannis I agree to a point. Not because I think they botched his characterisation, which I don't, but because Dragonstone seems to be the biggest victim of ASOS's partition into two seasons. Stannis doesn't have that much to do until 4x09, so they're keeping him in limbo mode, going in cirlces and restating all the relevant momets already covered in the last season. So yeah, here I'd have to agree that the Dragonstone material is definitely lacking and isn't all that interesting. But that in my view is a consequence of not enough meat on them bi-seasonal bones and not of Stannis characterisation. Don't worry, by the end of S4 and into S5 he'll be the Stannis you love.

293	The Killer Snark	2014-04-23	I personally don't mind the Jaime/Cersei scene, because it's apparent from both the novels and the series that Jaime isn't a whiter than white hero, so there's not much to 'assassinate' even if you like him and believe in his redemption arc. How is being a bit rapey with his sister, who he's previously been sexually involved with, any worse than crippling a child?
294	gvewolf243	2014-04-23	I give it a 6.
295	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Mr Fixit is a voice of reason as always, here and on wicnet. I'm extremely surprised that this episode has been rated so lowly. It was strong and consistent and moved the plot along a helluvaÂ  lot without being clunky about it. Currently it has a nine on imdb and a ninety-five on Rotten Tomatoes. I gave it an eight. But really do people think this episode is worse than "the Night Lands"? I just don't see that. Besides the over-politicised and overblown objections to THAT scene (which I by no means share), I can't see why anyone would consider this the worst episode of the entire show.

Â 
Thanks. Â 
Â 
Yes, Breaker of ChainsÂ is very strong for a transitional episode that checks in on quite a few storylines. Aftermath of the PW was handled very well containing multiple strong scenes with Tywin, Cersei, Tommen, Oberyn, Tyrion, Pod, Tyrells and yeah, THAT SCENE. As a fan of lore, I was especially pleased with Tywin's recounting of various kings of old as well as with the mention that Dorne withstood the Targaryen invasion. 
Â 
Arya and Hound were a delight as usual and a welcome peak into the lives of smallfolk in war-torn Riverlands.
Â 
The Wall moved things at a nice clip, introducing both the WIldlings' plans to draw out the NW out of Castle Black by raiding the Gift and Jon's plan to eliminate the mutineers at Craster's for very sensible reasons - if Mance gets to them first, he'll know that there are only 100, not 1,000 black brother left at CB and then it's Game Over. Sam and Gilly had a nice setup scene that will probably play a role down the line, though it was a bit repetitive, as it didn't reveal anything we didn't already know about them. However, since the show had to re-introduce them this season, I'm willing to cut them some slack on this point.
Â 
Dragonstone scenes viewed in isolation are actually quite good. I really enjoyed Davos and Shireen and his Iron Bank plan. (There's certainly a lot of new plans being put into motion this episode, right?) However, I do agree that Dragonstone material feels pretty stagnant since Stannis essentially broods for a season and a half. I look forward to some action here.
Â 
Finally, Dany was a blast; an absolutely fantastic scene. Everything there rang true. I giggled at Daario the Inconsequential, apparently the only guy in Dany's inner circle that's no big deal if he dies. I liked how anticlimactic the duel was with the whole Indiana Jones vibe. And Emilia Clarke's command of Valyrian... unbelievable how good and charismatic she is.Â 
Â 
A very strong episode, no doubt about it. Around 8.5 or even better.

An expected reaction by hardcore book fans, fueled by this crazy overblown internet faux-outrage. Does anyone really think this was the worst episode of the show? Come on. It's not even close. Just how last episodes's average was no doubt brought down considerably because of Stannis faux-outrage. Though to be honest, that episode was probably brought up by the Joff hype so maybe, when all is said and done, there we were closer to the truth.
Â 
I find the Unsullied reaction a good barometer: this Jaime thing barely registered as something inconceivable and unforgivable on their radars.


Â 
I thought it was the worst episode of the series because so many things were clumsy.Â  This has been a very high quality series thus far and I don't like seeing bad staging.Â  Not to mention that every storyline looks like it is in danger veering completely away from the source material.Â  We didn't need the hound's asshole scene because he should be gone from the story by now.Â  Jon Snow doesn't defend the wall from both sides with a few men before reinfocements arrive?Â  Instead he is going to lead some strike team back to Crasters keep?Â  Huh?Â  No Coldhands?
Â 
Hopefully we'll get back on track but the bloated storyline issue is starting to catch up with the show despite everything they've trimmed.
298	grumdin	2014-04-23	Â 
May I ask what you hated so much about True Detective? I've seen a lot of "excellent" TV, as some would say, like The Wire, The Sopranos, Deadwood, etc, and I honestly thought the first four episodes* were some of the most flawless TV I've ever seen in my life, and normally I'm a very critical person when it comes to TV and films. Also, even if you didn't like the storyline or pacing, I find it hard to believe anyone that's watched both Game of Thrones and True Detective (especially the six minute long-take in episode 4) can say Game of Thrones is better directed. Cary Fukunaga (the director of all of True Detective's first season) is leagues better than any director on Game of Thrones, imho.
Â 
* The show steadily started losing steam and brilliance in episodes 5 and 6, and episodes 7 and 8 were pieces of shit, in my opinion, at least compared to the first half the season, but the first half is incredible beyond just about anything I've seen on TV.


The first half of True Detective was some of the best film making I've seen on any media in years. The last episode was risible dog shit, which is 100% the fault of the writers and producers. So compaing to GoT what's the issue? Well for me it's how boringly safe the direction is. It doesn't look right for a start, the costumes are all wrong, they're swanning around in suits and dresses with modern cuts and materials. The scenes are poorly directed overall, poor use of close ups, everything shot in medium frame with apparently unmoveable cameras, yes Mr. Direcor we're watching a TV show as you will never let us forget it. Where are the risks, where is the desire to dirve the show forward at a decent narriative pace? They will have the biggest budget of any TV show I reckon, and yes they have a big cast, but attempting to bring some art into the most important part of film making should not be an issue of money.
299	Inevittable	2014-04-23	8 from me.
Â 
Dany's scene was excellent, her speech made me giddy.
Tywin's lecturing to Tommen while Cersei is silently standing by was awesome.
Tyrion's scene with Pod was touching.
Â 
But the Jaime/Cersei scene was horribly uncomfortable viewing.
300	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	^Which it would've been even if she'd said yes. The books and show have gotten us so used to incest now that we seem to forget that it is as fucked up as a good many other things.

Incest isn't as fucked up as rape, imo. At least one is consensual, no matter what the circumstance.
302	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-23	hmmmÂ Surely, this ep. does not merit anything less than a seven(8 Imo) but a 5 or 4 let a lone 2 or 1, Wow! I didnt know people could be so harsh. I can only imagine what they think of half of other crap on Tv. Thats no excuse or anything, im just saying...
Â 
Holding it to book standards should be a crime in and of itselfÂ 
Â 
Except, where Stannis is concerned
303	ovis alba	2014-04-23	I think a main "problem" of the episode is that it deals with a lot of stuff either after an important event or leading up to another big event. It's a lot of people "getting ready for something" or "discussing what just happened" and not much that stands on it's own. That's basically what I got from everyone I talked to bookreader or not, you feel a lot of stuff is getting planned but you sort of wait all episode for things to get going and although Dany's scene actually has stuff going on, it's still her getting ready to take the city, so that even ends with somthing like that.
This in combination with an episode right before which turned a lot of things around, makes it sort of a filler, which is not really "bad" but just doesn't have that big impression to people.
304	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Queen of Whores, in some places incest is the more taboo offense. And in most cases incest isn't consensual, a la Craster. But really I shouldn't keep up this line of conversation because I want us to get talking about Oathkeeper's promo. Of course that would require that the mods approve of the Oathkeeper threads that are pending...
305	BuggerThemAll	2014-04-23	I rate it a 6. The Cersei/Jaime scene made me very uncomfortable, and screwed up the idea that Jamie is on a path to redemption. 
I enjoyed that the writers tried to include a little more backstory and lore. Ex: Tommen and Tywin's talk.
Podrick and Tyrion parting ways broke my heart. And, unlike many others,  I enjoyed the interaction between Sam and Gilly.
Littlefinger laid on the villain voice a little too hard. And, as much as I love the Hound, I think the writers messed up by having him be the bad guy again so soon after mentioning he has -a code-.
Very happy with Dany and Daario.
306	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Its not as though they forgot that the Hound said he had a code. The only reason the Hound said he wasn't a thief was to set up him being a thief later on, otherwise that would have been a pointless aside. D and D wrote eps. one and three so that "inconsistency" (as many have called it) was purposeful. I don't know why they chose to have him say one thing and then do another, but it wasn't accidental or forgetful on their part. That line was clearly meant to set up this episode's scene.

Â 
The guy was being flippant and facetious. Arya put him on the spot there and he dismissed her with a funny retort. While I believe that Hound does have a code, stealing from gullible peasants doesn't strike me as something he's opposed to on principle. He stole in the books as well. Remember the ferrymen incident?

308	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Though admittedly, as people said on the "Two Swords" thread, he doesn't have gold in show canonÂ because the BWB pilfered his shitÂ not because of his lack of foresightÂ when he leftÂ KL. So really he could've just said "those outlaws you loved so much robbed from me" and that would have shut her up. I don't think it was OOC for him to rob that poor fellow though and it prompted him to give Arya a nice (albeit cynical) lesson.

309	Count Balerion	2014-04-23	I gave it a 7, although Tywin and Daenerys almost raised it to an 8, and there were some good references to earlier seasons in the Sansa and Cersei scenes (that alliterates).Â  The QOT also didn't disappoint.Â  And the Pod farewell, quite touching.
Mainly Charles Dance raises the bar in practically every scene he's in, although 
	Spoiler Tywin seems so much more sympathetic than in the books that it'll be rather sad when he gets offed.Â  And I'm afraid we won't be getting Ser Pounce and the gang.


The principal reason I gave a star to the Daenerys scene was the Valyrian speech.Â  And I'm now wondering if the Unsullied's training included voice lessons.
Not too sure about the Arya/Hound scene, though it does give the perspective of the ordinary people, which is a pretty important theme in the books.Â  Even less sure about the wildling raid, which shows us that that cannibal guy is icky, which we already knew.Â  Of course it segues into the Night's Watch, but I'm not sure it was needed.Â  Good to see more of Aemon.
Â 
Too much sex, of course, and of not terribly good quality; but that comes with the territory and is true of the books as well.

310	boojam	2014-04-23	Since episode 1 Season 1 I have used the following criterion in grading an episode.These two things are fixed:1) Production value, costumes, sets and VFX work - +3 points.(I really did not know how good the VFX were for the first season until I saw that 'behind the scenes' making off.)2) The actors. 95% are so good (a couple are uneven but I give them a by because they come through now and then). - +3So I give an automatic 6 points right up front.3) Direction and cinematography ... 2 points this can go as +1 or -1. Never seen a case of -2 but +2 is common.(Direction is closely tied to the teleplay so that takes some thinking In the general cinematography has been out standing.)4)Writing and episode composition. +1,-1, or a +2 or -2.This is difficult since sometimes awkward dialog seems to have slipped through a lot of competent hands.Being a fan of visual narrative drama I cut slack for this show, since I have read the novels too, and consider them very very difficult to translate to a 10 episode format.Not a purist so sort that of thing does not bother me, doing the Talisa thing was both to add some poignancy and some expedience (people going to sit around for years wondering where Oona Chaplin was?)(Only thing I did not really like was the unexplained Asha - Osha weirdness , maybe it's out there but I have never heard Dave and Dan address it.)Other changes and condensations have been ok with me.If the show were not so well acted and the production values so high I would probably grade harder on the episode compositions, there are excellent segues but things jump around like a room full of cats in a lightning storm!I am used to it now.

311	Er Rn	2014-04-23	I gave it a 6. 
Positives:
Tywin and Tommen
Jon Snow
Stannis and Davos, Davos and Shireen
Arya and the Hound
Wildling raiders
Negatives:
Jaime and Cersei
Oberyn's orgy 
Littlefinger's accent
I'm kinda neutral on the Dany scene. I liked her speech in Valyrian but I don't understand hurling the barrels of the former slaves' collars. I get the idea behind it, but it seems likely to me they could've crashed into the slaves standing there, causing more harm than good.
312	Petyr Patter	2014-04-24	So, I just rewatched this episode.Â  In another post I called it the "DARKEST" episode of Game of Thrones to date: http://asoiaf.wester...36#entry5683224 .
Â 
Now, having watched this episode twice, I don't think I will ever watch it again.Â  The only other episode I feel that way about is the Rains of Castamere, and even then just the Red Wedding itself.Â  This episode is just unpleasant from start to finish.Â  Even the scene I did find pleasant, Davos dealing with Shireen's bossy questions, was literally dark. We get it, Dragonstone is a creepy place.Â  Still, how about a conversation in the sun once in a while?Â  You are Baratheons, not vampires.
Â 
Which is not to say the episode was bad, but I feel like it was bad.Â  While sometimes the unpleasantness showcased a coming threat, such as the wildlings, or sometimes unpleasantness is what the hero must endure to triumph.Â  Here, it mostly was just showing a crappy world that no one was trying to make better.Â  This is not why I watch television.
Â 
And the rape was just ten times more sickening the second time around.Â 
Â 
5/10
313	Ran	2014-04-24	549 votes in, 6.97 average, 8 median, 7.08 normalized average.
314	DolorousKim	2014-04-24	I rated it a 7, which to me is a good rating, indicative of a solidly entertaining episode which had far more elements to recommend it than condemn it, but still not being an especially brilliant episode representative of all the best features of what this series can deliver.Â  I can't understand the "one" ratings for this episode any more than I can understand the "ten" ratings, but to each his/her own...
Â 
What really worked for me:
Tywin - Tommen scene - I loved everything about this scene from the way that it was filmed, to the content of the dialog, to the actors' body language and facial expressions (including the "background" characters -- Lena Headey killed it without having to say a word).Â  Grandpa delivering a not so subtle smackdown of Joffrey's reign in the presence of his corpse while swiftly taking the heir apparent in hand was masterful from start to finish to my mind.
Tyrion - Pod scene - I found this scene to be ridiculously touching while still managing to deliver some key exposition as to the way things currently stand for Tyrion.Â  The quiet dignity that Peter Dinklage imbued Tyrion with despite his condition and surroundings was a thing of beauty, and this leave-taking was handled better than the way things played out in the book in my opinion.
Arya - Hound dinner scene - some great funny stuff here!Â  Maisie and Rory have wonderful chemistry, and I really enjoy every interaction between their two characters.Â  While not really "liking" each other, it's clear that they have a large amount of grudging respect for each other and it's a joy to see.
Tywin - Oberyn scene - Such great menace and crackling animosity delivered in such a wonderfully understated way.Â  I love watching these two powerful predators stalking each other.Â  Leaving the acceptance (or not) of handshake offer ambiguous at the scene's end was brilliant.
What didn't work for me:
Â 
Cersei - Jaime sept scene - I'm no book purist, but why on earth change this scene to introduce the element of non- or dubious at best consent?Â  Isn't the fact that the relationship between these two is so freakishly dysfunctional that they are willing to indulge in consensual sex in the realm's most holy location in the presence of their dead son's corpse powerful enough?Â  Really bad decision on someone's part to add the consent question here (or really poor execution if it was meant to be consensual).Â  This scene as filmed undermines the fact that Cersei and Jaime are both victims as well as perpetrators in the severely twisted relationship that they share.
Thenn cannibalism - This element being present once again in an otherwise successfully executed battle scene brought the whole segment down.Â  The systematic wiping out of the population of a peaceful village was already brutal enough, why push things to a sickening extreme by shoving in the cannibalism?Â  Way too over the top for me.Â  Are the Thenns supposed to be hardened, disciplined soldiers or some escapees from The Walking Dead?
315	The Killer Snark	2014-04-24	Someone else mentioned Littlefinger's accent. That was bugging me a bit as well. I know he's actually Irish, but Aidan Gillen's accent was never as broad as that in previous seasons. I wonder if he's a method-style actor, and the part he plays in Calvary was to blame. "Top of the mornin' to ye, me lady Sansa, it's a terrible thing the lad Joffrey dyin', i'tis, i'tis, but you be comin' with me now, they'll be arter ye and no mistake."

I'm not certain on which points you and I are in disagreement. You said yourself it's not the worst episode of the series. I said the same.Â 
Â 
As for internet faux-outrage, well, it is. Do you think mainstream media care one bit about Jaime's character arc and the supposed damage to it? Do you think they protest because Jaime raping Cersei means the show condones rape, glamorizes and romanticizes it? That this, after all the shit that has happened on the show, is somehow the most morally reprehensible act we've ween? No. They jumped on the bandwagon because they saw the potential for clickbait. Just look at the dates of the published online material. The media outlets had these episodes for weeks in advance. Almost no one made a big fuss over the scene. Actually, many respectable critics noted the interesting deviation from the books and expressed interest in how it will turn out. Then the net explodes in outrage and suddenly everyone publishes articles on inappropriateness of the scene. So, yeah, where media and the internet culture are concerned, it's faux-outrage, an opportunity to stand on a soapbox and show just how progressive they all are. Then they can pat each other on the back and sayÂ mission accomplished.

323	Rashtibram	2014-04-24	I thought this episode was the weakest of the season so far, but that isn't saying much considering how much I loved the last two. Ultimately, I thought it was very solid, with pitch-perfect pacing and more than a few scenes worthy of individual praise. There wasn't really anything that elevated it into "seven" territory though, and in the end it wasn't an extraordinarily memorable hour of TV, which can count as a legitimate negative in a show usually so jam-packed full of memorable events.

324	I love Cersei	2014-04-24	It's hardly hard to say that this was the best episode for a long time. There was nothing really outstanding, noÂ aha experience of any kind. So I won't give it a 10, but a well-earned 9 it is. I felt it was over so fast and I never got bored. Most of all, no single very bad scene was included. Usually, there's at least one of those.
Â 
Dany speaking High Valyrian is sooo good! They could not possibly have found a better actor for that role thanÂ Emilia Clarke.
325	YesYourLordCraig	2014-04-24	I thought it was a good/ok episode. ill watch it again now and that may change. You really can't be surprised by Jamie's ways, i mean the craziest, weirdest things and situations seem to sexually turn him on. I think Dany may be getting a little too power hungry, which may not work in her favor.
326	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-25	I am going to try very hard not to step in any of the big piles of shit, that surround this rape topic.
Â 
I did not see anybody else bring this up, or post a link (I didn't read all 17 pages). I read a article from one of the guys behind the scene. He was going on how well the scene went, and how he thought it played straight w/ the books, in that Cersei fought it at the start and then gave into it later in the scene. I kind of saw what he was saying, but w/o CerseiÂ saying the words she said in the book, it did not come off quite that way.

POSSIBLY she says sth next ep to tell us it was consensual. Possibly the goal was to have Jaime "hit bottom" morally, but IMHO that already happened and in any case this was going well already. In the book he just grows away from Cersei as a reaction to her rejections. Easily done on TV. If the director thought it was a turn on he needs help.
328	The Killer Snark	2014-04-25	Black Wolf Smith - If people dropped the tone of PC-induced faux outrage at the 'butchering of Saint Jaime', they might realise that the way the scene played out was in context to the changing of the sexual power dynamic of the two characters which has been going on for episodes now without anyone mentioning it, but I moaned about that at the time and have learned to live with it. I do believe that the low ratings this ep has been getting, which is far superior to last week's, is mostly down to that one scene.

Â 
I think it is just something the show has added in as a bit of world building and it also helps the actors pretend to be 'dead'. With something covering your eyes you are less inclined to move your eyeballs automatically when hearing a noise and if you do, the camera doesn't see it. Jon Arryn had the same stones.
331	legba11	2014-04-25	This was a great episode, really one of my favorites which doesn't included anything HUGE. Â However, the completely bungled direction of the Jaime/Cersei scene is problem and that brought it down to an 8.

Â 

Alright! Thank you. Even though it's a guess I don't remember it from the books so it could be true.Â 
Yeah I remember the stones from him as well. Thanks mate!Â
333	TepidHands	2014-04-25	I gave it a 5. I don't like the Oberyn being turned from this scary-sexy-super-intelligent guy of the books into an oversexed sleazeball who sounds like Inigo Montoya-meets-Puss 'n' Boots from "Shrek." I don't like the Thenns as single-minded parent-eating monsters. I don't like Paedofinger and his rasp. I don't like rapey Jaime.Â
334	Jambottle Jeebus	2014-04-25	It wasn't rape. She says No then makes out with him... she doesn't really resist, she wanted it...for sure... Give Alex Graves the benefit of doubt...
Afterall , Jaime's relationship is anything but normal to begin with.. Cercei get off on being manhandled.
335	I love Cersei	2014-04-25	Before reading the comments here it never ever crossed my mind that THE SCENE could be interpreted as anything else but consensual sex. It all seemed so natural a part of their game. Passion and hunger on both sides. I think both actor's did a great job in putting that across.
Â 
Obviously, I think wrong. ;-)

Well, kissing someone, saying No, kissing him again, pulling at his clothes, and finally putting your arm around his neck and kissing him again as he bears you to the floor, certainly sent out mixed messages to me too - and I'm female. Â But this one will run and run - at least until the next episode where we hopefully get some resolution to what exactly it was that happened in the Sept. Â I know that at the end of the scene I had the same reaction I did when reading it, i.e. that those were two seriously fucked up people. Â In the book I was more disgusted with Cersei than Jaime to be honest. Â Whatever Joffrey had been, the last thing I'd want to do is shag over the corpse of my firstborn. Â But each to his own.
337	7th-key	2014-04-25	Scenes going too long, clichA©s, again wasted time on bordellos, wildling as boogeymen... all already mentioned above here or there.
Â 
And the scene we dare not shut up about: screwed by the direction, dismissive of the attention that such subject requires when presented ambiguously and sacrificing of character development. All for shock value.
Â 
It's a 6, which I'm tempted to give a 4 for shock value.
338	boojam	2014-04-25	This was a great episode, really one of my favorites which doesn't included anything HUGE. Â However, the completely bungled direction of the Jaime/Cersei scene is problem and that brought it down to an 8.Welcome back!This sure was an oddly controversial episode, for such a generally standard narrative episode.The Jamie/Cersei scene looked more like a writing boggle than anything else, I was kinda MEH about it.
339	Danelle	2014-04-26	5.
Â 
The Â strongest moment for me was Tywin discussing history and politics with Tommen.Â 
The weakest moment, was of course, Jaime and Cersei in the sept. It's not just about the impact on Jaime's character, but on Cersei's as well. She was a depicted as a weak and passive person, and this is far from accurate. I wonder what their next scene is going to be about.Â
340	Danelle	2014-04-26	A question about THE scene:
Why does Joffrey have stones on his eyes?

That's a really interesting question.
As far as I can tell, there was no mention of coins placed on his eyes during the funeral.
In fact, although funerary customs are mentioned, that particular practice doesn't appear in the books.
My guess is that it is a vague reference to the belief that the soul of the deceased has to a pay a fee to the ferryman on its way to the underworld.
Even nowadays, it is not unusual to place coins on the eyes of the deceased.Â 
But unlike Charon's obol, which was a coin, Joffrey has stones on his eyes, painted as another pair of eyes.
Perhaps it was a subtle reference to the fact that it was important for Joffrey to be there, watching his parents having sex?
Perhaps it was a reminder of the fact that while Cersei cannot escape their past, Jaime wants to continue?Â 
Besides, Joffrey was their firstborn and the only child left to them.
The Martells got Myrcella, Tommen was taken by Tywin, all Cersei has got is Joffrey's corpse.
I am really looking forward to the next Cersei-Tommen scene.Â

I dont really have an answer to the original question, but they also did it with jon Arryn in the first season. So they kinda had no choice but to do this with joffrey also, i think
Â 
Other than that i have no clue

Yes!!!
I forgot about that!
You are right!
In the books though, Jon Arryn never appears, but there were stones on his eyes as well.
I remember thinking, while watching that scene, that perhaps it was a reference to a custom from the Vale, since stones and mountains are an important aspect of the local culture.
Another possible explanation is that since both men were highborn and their bodies were exposed before the funeral, placing stones on their eyes, ensured that ravens wouldn't eat them.
Perhaps the scene from episode 1. was a foreshadowing to the scene from episode 3. In both scenes, Jaime and Cersei discuss their relationship, in front of a dead body, and they talk about the prospect of being caught. Â

Why does Joffrey have stones on his eyes?

Ser Desmond Wine's Bane explained it, but I'd add the idea was taken from the Romans who put coins over eyes of the dead, so that they can pay a fare for being ferried over the river Styx to the underworld. What I find a bit inconsistent with the world GRRM created is the choice of eyes painted on stones. This would make more sense in old God's religion with faces on weirwood trees. But, in the end â<U+0080>¦ it's ok. That's how D&D see it.

Â Show Jaime doesn't know about the others (not sure if any of them have happened on the show) but this is suppose to be a turning point for both of them. I agree the power dynamic between has been slowly turning, from this point on Jaime doesn't see her the same way, Sex is only a small part of it.
Â 
I believe that this show tied 3:1 w/ the highest ratings, mostÂ on HBO since the Sopranos final.
346	The Killer Snark	2014-04-26	It's been getting low ratings here, though. I joined this site about a year and a half ago, and I've never rated an episode with less than 7, and it's taken a fair amount of nitpickings for me to get that low. To an extent, though I'm always dubious about changes to the source, occasionally some of the larger ones are improvements. The Daenarys story arc in season 2 is dramatically stronger than it is in ACoK. And I'm willing to suspend my own biases on occasion when I think an episode would work for me much better if I hadn't read the books, so certain leeway has to be made for non-readers. The one thing which I am concerned about is that non-readers might be getting made to feel too much sympathy at this stage for Cersei, because the way she's being presented now is going to clash with how she is in AFfC, which is pretty much how she's always been in the novels. It won't seem narratively consistent. But to approach what must be seen, on the show, as a more gradual sinking into evil and insanity is going to undermine just how entertaining her pantomime battiness really is.
347	Ran	2014-04-26	Beg to differ on Daenerys in S2, and I'm not the only one. For a lot of people it was the first sign that when they go "off-book", their sense of storytelling might well be dramatically inferior to GRRM's. I think S2 remains the lowest rated season on the forum overall for these sorts of reasons, despite also containing one of the most hailed episodes.
348	The Killer Snark	2014-04-26	I'll wait and see. I still stand by my opinion re: second season Daenarys, but I may wind up fully agreeing with you depending on how they treat the ramifications of those changes. in the adaptation of Dany's chapters from ADwD.

I think S2 remains the lowest rated season on the forum overall for these sorts of reasons, despite also containing one of the most hailed episodes.Dany only has 5 chapters in COK. A great amount on the page is inner thoughts. Dany IV is visions, visions, visions... I think Dave and Dan threw up their hands and outlined something 'actionable' , so to speak.Then didn't write very good dialog for Qarth, and George did not write a single sequence there(I mean the show).They hired an actress to play Quaithe and hardly involved her.I thought the first two episodes of season 2 were ok.What they were going to do with the HoUD must have been a challenge, Dany's visions there, only two, worked for me, and the action in her escape was ok, with a bit of clumsy dialog.All and all do you think , if D&D were not interested or were flummoxed that they could have looked for a writer to have transfered all the difficult content of Dany's Qarth chapters into good visual drama?I mean it would have taken some imagination, it might have come out , so to speak, sort of 'abstract'... not exactly box office with most viewers.I think something could have been done with another writer but they did not make the effort.They are really over worked so dont know if I can blame them...

Â 
There was some good stuff like Tyrion and Pod. Tywin and LF had ok scenes.
Â 
There was some dull scenes too, Sam and Gilly.
Â 
But what really tarnished the episode was the Sept scen with Jaime and Cersei.
Didn't like the Hound robbing the family either.
And the cartoon villainy of the Thenns really didn't help.
Â 
Could do better...
352	The Killer Snark	2014-04-26	I agree with boojam. Dany's chapters there were at least largely unadaptable. I think they did the best they could with what they had.

I really don't like how they had her lock X and the handmaiden in the tomb.Â  I could see killing them, but that's too horrible and IMO out of character.Â  So I just pretend it didn't happen.Â  WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS was also kind of lame.

416	booknerd2	2014-04-20	I love you, Sam.

419	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-20	Oh Jesus fuck. Thanks a bunch, D&D...
420	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-04-20	also the jaime rape scene was so unnecessary, hes not the type
421	.Nymeria	2014-04-20	Jaime rape: One of the truly perplexing choices I've seen the show make. I thought for a minute that they simply thought the twincest in front of the incest child's corpse was a bit too icky. So what do they do? They make it worse by taking away consent.Â  

Perplexing indeed. In the book this is the first time Jamie seems to get a sense of how much Cersei uses their relationship to manipulate him. Getting tired of HBO putting her on a pedestal.
422	Newstar	2014-04-20	Man, TV Stannis is a dick. I mean, more so.
423	Wmarshal	2014-04-20	They give all the lannisters who go down in character bum in character, but Jaime who does get a character bum in book is brought down show wise. Yeah they are just taking a shit on book readers.

Â 
I think it's more to do with Cersei being shown as a Victim. She is the manipulative and controlling one in their relationship but Jaime raping her is kind of making him look like the 'bad guy' and her the weaker one.
457	Warhawk137	2014-04-20	Â

They already began portraying Cersei as "the victim" when the show had Joffrey order Robert's bastards killed, and not her.

Aye, but wasn't the whole thing that he changed while traveling with Brienne? I'd like to think he has a better sense of morals and such now... Or at least in the books.

Â 
I'll give you that, although, as a poster noted above, this is a trend from the very beginning of the show.Â  For whatever reason, Benioff and Weiss decided to change Cersei's character from the one found in the books.
469	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	=( Pod
470	Warhawk137	2014-04-20	There are so few whores in Westeros, male or female..

On the other hand, those few whores must be richer than the Lannisters with all the business they do.Â  Talk about demand outstripping supply.

Styr. Although to be fair, all the wildlings in his group with the shaved, scarred heads are implied to be cannibals.

514	Viserion Stormborn	2014-04-20	I love Dany's theme song. Although the chain link catapults are slightly less badass than Dracarysing the fuck out of someone.
515	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2014-04-20	Strong ending, loved the bits at the Wall, Oberyn\Tywin, and Tyrion's scenes, but the rest of the episode, not so much. Next week looks pretty good, though.
516	FNF	2014-04-20	God that ending... After a pretty good transition episode, the ending was pretty flat for me.
517	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	I want a scene of Oberyn next to Sansa.
518	tito5601	2014-04-20	those thenns are brutal
519	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-20	God that ending... After a pretty good transition episode, the ending was pretty flat for me.


Same.Â 
Emilia's acting is just cringeworthy.
520	Pretty Meris	2014-04-20	Tyrion is being portrayed as too angelic! Also, my heart aches for lack of Strong Belwas. Otherwise, thought it was a decent episode, but was mainly setting up for future plots. The sept scene was good, charles dance is just fantastic
521	Aypeeootrek	2014-04-20	Loved the ending. From the wildling raid to the assault on Merreen. But was sooooo hoping they were gonna throw Belwas in there. Very disappointed they didn't. Would of been an awesome cameo
522	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-04-20	the d&d text massacre continue. and now the impending trial? let the butchery begin
523	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	Yeah, sucks not Belwas and not Coldhands but whores. Whores, whores, whores. Whores everywhere, women and men.
524	Chebyshov	2014-04-20	I'm not pleased with the Jaime rape scene. Otherwise pretty solid. I'm digging the new Tommen oddly. Also this is confirmation of no Coldhands? Looks like the NW is going to take care of Dirk instead.
525	kaanchanoone	2014-04-20	I haven't even seen it yet (near to 18 hours to go) but just reading this is probably funnier than every "joke" in the episode!

Hear Hear!
526	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-04-20	im gonna miss tywin, great scene
527	Lady Lurksalot	2014-04-20	After that, I'm finding myself warming up to this new Daario. He's still no Strong Belwas, but he might do after all.
528	jobmartell	2014-04-20	Yeah, sucks not Belwas and not Coldhands but whores. Whores, whores, whores. Whores everywhere, women and men.

Whores go to HBO. Finally we know!
529	Michael Brown	2014-04-20	You know one poor slave probably ended up dying from those barrels at the end. The ironyÂ
530	MoIaF	2014-04-20	I love the scenes where Dany speaking High Valyrian, so very good.
531	ViennaGirl	2014-04-20	that was too rapey - Jaime wouldn't rape Cersei. Loved the manacles = log shrapnel at the end in Mereen. Arya and Shireen should rule the world. I hope Shireen makes it out alive. Maybe the Hound won't get hurt - maybe he'll get to the sellswords and Arya will lose him in Bravos? Pod and Brienne have to meet up and take off pretty soon - next week when Cersei delegates Sansa to Jaime.
532	Bastard of Boston	2014-04-20	This was actually my favorite episode of the season, mostly on the strength of the Sept scene. There was some great stuff going on there, all around. Lena played the shit out of that scene.
Â 
True to the books, Dany's head is now so full of fire, blood, and ego, her bravado is becoming a cliche. I do get a hardon whenever she speaks in High Valyrian, though.
533	.Nymeria	2014-04-20	I'm not pleased with the Jaime rape scene. Otherwise pretty solid. I'm digging the new Tommen oddly. Also this is confirmation of no Coldhands? Looks like the NW is going to take care of Dirk instead.

Also upset over the Jamie rape scene. Just doesn't make sense at all. I'm wondering if the show's given up on Benjen's storyline or if this means he for sure isn't Coldhands?
534	Chebyshov	2014-04-20	Also upset over the Jamie rape scene. Just doesn't make sense at all. I'm wondering if the show's given up on Benjen's storyline or if this means he for sure isn't Coldhands?

If he is or isn't, I think the show just decided it isn't impactful or influential in enough in the story to devote screen time to it. I usually trust their decisions, but it's a shame,  because I rather like CH
535	Arataniello	2014-04-20	I'm not pleased with the Jaime rape scene. Otherwise pretty solid. I'm digging the new Tommen oddly. Also this is confirmation of no Coldhands? Looks like the NW is going to take care of Dirk instead.

In Bran's tree vision last week, we saw brief glimpse of a horse.  Am thinking that it was Coldhand's mount.
536	ViennaGirl	2014-04-20	I wish Littlefinger would stop breathing right into Sansa's eyeballs. He's so scary. When he and Lysa get together it will be a freak festival.
537	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-20	Pretty boring episode. Â Not gonna complain too much since the first two were great. Â I feel like Petyr tries too hard to sound different for some reason. Â I swear he didn't sound like that season 1 and 2. Â Glad to see the Hound toe the line of paragon and renegade. Â The Tywin/Oberyn exchange was pretty good. Â Tywin guiding young Tommen away from Cersei is a nice indicator of future events where he tries to separate the next in line from being manipulated from a psycho woman.
538	Oakenfist	2014-04-20	What's going on with Littlefinger's voice? It's like every season it changes.
539	Father of Dragons	2014-04-20	In Bran's tree vision last week, we saw brief glimpse of a horse.  Am thinking that it was Coldhand's mount.

Pretty sure that was the Wight mount from the end of season 2.
543	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-20	I want a scene of Oberyn next to Sansa.


Â 
I kept waiting for Loras to show up in that orgy.Â  Waited in vain.
Â 
However, the most important development of this episode is, obviously, that DOLOROUS EDD LIVES.Â  Edd is back and D&D avoid making a grievous continuity error in their adaptation.Â  Whew.
Â 
Kit is stepping up big time so far this season.Â  Easily the most improved thus far, or maybe it's just that the script is getting better.Â  I'm kinda digging Thorne and Snow skirting close to actually seeing Eye To Eye.Â  Next Week Preview seems to suggest this will be undone soon enough, however.
Â 
Davos getting the Iron Bank idea was a bit too much "Eureka!" for me, but Liam Cunningham is such a good Davos that I'll look the other way.Â  Also, there is no such thing as Too Much Shireen.
Â 
Daario?Â  Whatever.Â  Daario's Naked Lady Daggers?Â  HELL YES BEST PROP EVER (at least until Mace's special chair shows up next year).Â  That's how you squash a jabronie.Â  Also, Emilia Clarke is at her best when she's yelling at people in a fake language.
Â 
Tywin almost looked like a normal loving human grandfather there for a minute or two.Â  And I love the touch of Jaime asking "how are you?" seeing Tommen as a person and not just as the next king.Â  Maybe even as a son...?Â  We'll see.
Â 
Guess Sansa won't have Chekov's accessory this go-around.Â  Littlefinger's accent is weird almost to the point of distracting me.Â  However, we got the "a bag of gold buys silence for a while, a crossbow bolt buys it forever" line, and while it's not a direct translation from the book, at least it's there.Â  And LF is bringin' the creepin' on Sansa, as he should.
Â 
More thoughts to follow as they leak back to me.
544	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-20	What's going on with Littlefinger's voice? It's like every season it changes.


Literally just said the same thing. Â Couldn't agree more.

547	Lady Lurksalot	2014-04-20	What's going on with Littlefinger's voice? It's like every season it changes.

His changed this episode, and The Hound sounded like he let some of his Scots accent in at one point, too.

Tywin almost looked like a normal loving human grandfather there for a minute or two.Â  And I love the touch of Jaime asking "how are you?" seeing Tommen as a person and not just as the next king.Â  Maybe even as a son...?Â  We'll see.
Â 
Guess Sansa won't have Chekov's accessory this go-around.Â  Littlefinger's accent is weird almost to the point of distracting me.Â  However, we got the "a bag of gold buys silence for a while, a crossbow bolt buys it forever" line, and while it's not a direct translation from the book, at least it's there.Â  And LF is bringin' the creepin' on Sansa, as he should.
Â 
More thoughts to follow as they leak back to me.

I approve this message 100%
Also Shireen is my new favorite show character.
551	Pretty Meris	2014-04-20	What's going on with Littlefinger's voice? It's like every season it changes.


Distinctly irish this time. Perhaps it's his special smuggler accent
552	jons nissa	2014-04-20	LOL, Shireen is going to end up winning Stannis' war and not Melissandre 


Â 
i have to say this episode is making me think shireen might really have a chance at winning this thing! so many changes to a book character are met with moaning and groaning but making shireen more of a round, dynamic character is a great improvement, imho.
Â 
Â 


After that, I'm finding myself warming up to this new Daario. He's still no Strong Belwas, but he might do after all.


Â 
yes, he might be alright. to be fair, if he'd been cast in the first place, i think i'd like him better. it's just that the first daario really looked the part so much. this one seems to act the part. i'll get used to him, i'm sure.
Â 
Â 


I love the scenes where Dany speaking High Valyrian, so very good.


Â 
totally love it when she talks high valyrian! i also liked the symbolism of the broken collars. nice.
553	Raksha 2014	2014-04-20	Â 
Er... standing.Â  Think he was wearing blue?Â  They cut to him about a half dozen times.Â  He was the one who was looking very fascinated with Dany.


Â 
The lean-faced guy with the mustache, kinda good-looking?
554	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2014-04-20	Yeah but if he was in the show he wouldn't be on an elk.


Â 
But he's not in the show, so its not his horse because he doesnt ride a horse, he rode an elk.
555	NightStark	2014-04-20	Â 
But he's not in the show, so its not his horse because he doesnt ride a horse, he rode an elk.


If he is on the show in the future he won't be on an elk.
556	Chebyshov	2014-04-20	Oh also we pretty much got confirmation it was the QoT who did the actual poisoning, yeah? Even though the framing made no sense for it
557	Newstar	2014-04-20	Also...
Â 
Who the hell is King Orys? Murdered by his own brother? The hell?
Â 
Orys Baratheon was Hand, but never king himself. I guess this is just show canon, but still. Weird.
558	Colonel Green	2014-04-20	Sequence-by-sequence review:
Â 
Sansa's escape:Â  My God was that woefully handled.Â  One of the worst-staged moments on the show since Arya ran out of the Brotherhood's cave and tripped over the Hound like three seconds later.Â  Sansa's barely out of the courtyard, in broad daylight, when Cersei starts screaming and Tywin starts barking orders, with no real chaos or anything in the crowd, and yet they somehow just run out of what should be a highly secured area down to the waterfront and get in a boat, then smash-cut to them at night.Â  Yeesh.Â  Sansa's been trapped in that city for 2+ seasons, and that's the best they could come up with for her departure?
Â 
Sansa/Littlefinger scene:Â  Decent.Â  Gillen's ever-changing accent still bugs me, but for what it was (and given the constraints the show has already imposed, like Dontos being a total non-entity), it was okay.
Â 
Dragonstone:Â  TV Shireen and Davos continue to be delightful.Â  I guess Stannis was implying he would kill Davos if Davos didn't shape up, which is...about par for the course on this show, I guess.
Â 
Arya/Hound:Â  I liked the peasant guy's character, and the loyalty shown there to House Tully, which has really gotten short-shrift in the TV show.Â  As the Hound robbing those people, I do hope this isn't supposed to be a "harsh lesson" in that what the Hound says is supposed to be true, because that's absurd, as Arya correctly stated.Â  I suppose the stealing here is reasonably consistent with the Hound's behaviour last year.
Â 
Tywin/Tommen:Â  Nicely done, though I'm sure the GoT Wiki writers will be frustrated as all get out over that new Targaryen king they created.
Â 
Jaime/Cersei:Â  Terrible adaptation choice.
Â 
Tywin/Oberyn:Â  I liked this quite well, though I'm not clear, if Tywin has explicitly promised vengeance against Clegane here, he's going to renege on that in order to force Oberyn to seek justice via championing Tyrion.
Â 
The Wall:Â  Turning all the Wildlings into coldblooded peasant-killers is going to pretty much kill any sympathy for them, though I suppose, again, that was already true based on last season.Â  I liked Sam's interactions with Gilly.
Â 
Dany:Â  Decently handled, though trying to figure out the acoustics of that moment just distracted me through the whole thing.

Â 
yes, the one with the curly afro-ish sort of hair with the mustache. he was leaning over and the showed him at least 3 different times.
561	boojam	2014-04-20	Kudos to David Peterson , I think that is the longest High Valyrian he has ever had to write!
562	Lord Bored	2014-04-20	This was without a doubt the most well written and paced of the season so far.Â Loved the Dragonstone scenes as well as those belonging to Silly (Sam + Gilly shipping lol). Also loved the foreshadowing with the mentioning of the Martell/Targ alliance, Golden Company, etc.
Â 
Having said that, I do have to agree that the Jaime/Cersei sept scene was just cringe-inducing (probably the sole negative aspect of the episode for me), made even worse by the fact that Cogman confirmed that it was intended to look 100% consensual.
563	CincyBastard	2014-04-20	I don't usually hate on the tv show (im pretty laid back and can usually understand the changes they make) BUT I HATE THAT THEY MADE JAIME RAPE CERSEI.
Â 
He is supposed to be in the midst/final transition of becoming a better man. Even before his redemption he would have never raped her!Â 
Â 
Now I know how the Stannis fans feelÂ
564	Newstar	2014-04-20	About Tommen's age and his marriage to Margaery...
Â 
Did anyone notice that as Tywin and Tommen were walking away, Tywin was telling Tommen about the need to marry and continue the family line?
Â 
The rest of the conversation went like this:
Â 
Tywin: To continue the family line. Do you know how that happens?
Tommen: Yes.
Tywin: Has anyone explained the details to you?
Tommen: I don't think so.
Tywin: It's all relatively straightforward...
Â 
Hmmm. Sansa and Tyrion never wound up consummating their marriage, either, but Tywin giving Tommen the talk? I wonder.
Â 
TV Tommen is...interesting. Despite being older, he still seems easily manipulated by Tywin...although, to be fair, Tywin was not wrong in anything that he said.

The symbolism was great. 
***
On different topic I really don't understand what D&D were trying to accomplish with the Jaime & Cersei rape scene.  Their relationship is about consent, why would D&D distort it this way?
567	Chebyshov	2014-04-20	Â

I thought he threw it off, on top of Dontos's body
568	Pretty Meris	2014-04-20	I think the Iron bank has had a mention in every episode thus far
569	HouseHarrison	2014-04-20	Best written and directed ep of the season, though the deviations with Jamie and the Thenns irked me.
570	ViennaGirl	2014-04-20	Â 
He eventually swept it off the rail and onto The Late Ser Dontos.


Â 
And Dontos stayed in the boat, so if the boat goes ashore and they find him and the necklace, it will frame him and Sansa. Right?

Littlefinger pretty clearly demonstrated that all the other stones are just made of glass or whatever, I thought, based on that.
Â 
Though that raises problems of its own, since that necklace doesn't seem to have a "front" or "back", so Sansa could easily have put it on with the poisoned one on the other side.
572	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-20	About Tommen's age and his marriage to Margaery...

Â 
That was fantastic.
Â 
Partly because I think Tywin Lannister is one of the last people I'd want the "The Birds And The Bees" speech from.Â  Poor Tommen.
573	aovalle	2014-04-20	Did Sansa leave KL with LF in book 3 happen right after the purple wedding like they show it in? Or am I correct to think she didn't leave until book 4? Memory is kind of fuzzy
574	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-20	Can't figure the Orys I thing.Â  If they meant to say "Aerys I", maybe there are rumors that he was offed by Maekar? (Rumors he was offed by Bloodraven might work too, but Bloodraven was his uncle...)
Â 
Maybe Orys is the missing Targ king ruling between Jaehaerys I and Viserys I? It's the only place he'd fit in, unless he ruled for only a couple days and was killed by one of the kings already on the list and so no one counts him or something.
Â 
(Can't imagine Orys Baratheon actually ruled, and can't imagine Aegon I killing him either.)
575	Hound's She-wolf	2014-04-20	Hate that they had the Hound steal, after he said he wasn't a thief and hated that Jaime raped Cersei.
576	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-20	Going to guess that Gilly ends up on the throne. The amount of time wasted on her in the books has now bled into the show.
577	Newstar	2014-04-20	Can't figure the Orys I thing.Â  If they meant to say "Aerys I", maybe there are rumors that he was offed by Maekar? (Rumors he was offed by Bloodraven might work too, but Bloodraven was his uncle...)

Â 
Could be. Or maybe the writers just made shit up. (Just saying.)
578	Stannis I	2014-04-20	Well, I don't know why everybody is so upseted about Jaimie/Cersei sex scene. It was not rape! In the book, he finds her alone with Joff's body and takes her right there, while she says "stop, Jaimie, please, not here, not now".Â 
What's the difference?
If that was rape, so it was in the books. The problem, I see, is that book Cersei doesn't care about it, she just accept the rape thing so she can control others (just like happens with one of the Kettleblacks).
579	Darth Pipes	2014-04-20	Distinctly irish this time. Perhaps it's his special smuggler accent


Â 
Definitely.Â 
Â 
Though he managed to be Creepy Uncle Littlefinger, invading Sansa's personal space the entire time.
580	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-20	I think the "Jaime rapes Cersei" thing totally messed up the end of A Feast For Crows with the "I love you, I love you, I love you" letter from Cersei to Jaime, doesn't it? If she still writes him that letter after being raped, that is F*KKED UP.
581	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-20	Ahh! Wth just happened? Worst episode so far for me. Jaime raping Cersei?! Gilly is in Moles town & the wildlings have all gone mad! Very disappointing. Loved the Tywin/Tommen & Tyrion/Pod exchange. Sansa's escape scene was almost too bad to watch. I love Dany tho & thoroughly enjoyed the last scene. Miss Strong Below as  but Daario is bad ass! So glad they changed his actor.
582	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2014-04-20	Did Sansa leave KL with LF in book 3 happen right after the purple wedding like they show it in? Or am I correct to think she didn't leave until book 4? Memory is kind of fuzzy

Dontos snuck her out that night.

And Dontos stayed in the boat, so if the boat goes ashore and they find him and the necklace, it will frame him and Sansa. Right?



Yup Yup Â  LF goin all in on making Sansa feel culpable.Â  Of course, he's right about Cersei wouldn't let a little thing like Total Lack Of Evidence stop her from convicting Sansa of the assassination.Â  But it's definitely all about LF making Sansa convict herself in her mind, so she'll be more afraid, more dependent, more compliant.
Â 
OOOH OOOH ALSO:Â  I guess they didn't have time to have Sansa do her epic climb down the cliff, which is regrettable, but at least Dontos got the "you're stronger than you know" line in, even though it's not going to be a memorable detail to most.
584	sertravisredbeard	2014-04-20	So was anyone else getting the vibe that Tywin sanctioned the Joffrey hit besides me? Â Or is that silly?

Aerys was king for like a decade, not a year, and he wasn't known for being "just".

588	Chebyshov	2014-04-20	So was anyone else getting the vibe that Tywin sanctioned the Joffrey hit besides me? Â Or is that silly?

Well Tyrion even posited it...my guess is he might have maybe suspected something was being plotted, but didn't bother to do anything at most. I don't see him taking an active role in it.
589	Lightning Tiger	2014-04-20	When Arya and the Hound were eating at that guys guys, i laughed when he prayed for his daughters virginity at the dinner table (her virtue right?)

Â 
hmmmmm. so much for her poisoning him with the remaining stones. or i suppose that could still happen in the book and the show will do it differently but it looks like that will not be the way littlefinger meets his ends.
Â 
Â 


I don't usually hate on the tv show (im pretty laid back and can usually understand the changes they make) BUT I HATE THAT THEY MADE JAIME RAPE CERSEI.
Â

Â 
Now I know how the Stannis fans feelÂ  


Â 
yes, i really didn't like the scene and don't understand what they're doing with jaime. so next week he's off to find sansa? with brienne, i suppose? weird.
Â 
as for stannis, this is the first time i really don't like what they've done with him. why is being so mean to davos? and with davos seemingly ready to sneak off to the iron bank, i'm sure the stanstans will be up in arms at the lack of agency of their hero.
591	Stannis-the-Mannis	2014-04-20	The good:
Â 
Shireen/Davos is awesome
New Daario is looking more promising
Tommen looks like he'll be interesting to watch (having Charles Dance talk to him over Joffrey's corpse was a bit heavy-handed though)
Tyrion/Pod was fairly moving
Â 
The glaring bad:
What in the actual fuck was that Jaime/Cersei rape scene
Valuable time is wasted to basically just remind the audience that Oberyn is bisexual
Stannis is still murderous and completely incapable of making any decisions of his own, ever......and I'm still wondering why cram the Gendry stuff into the last episode of S3 after 1 king had fallen when he's done nothing since
Â 
Overall, this episode has the same problem nearly every other episode has...D&D have to sacrifice theme to keep the plot moving, so it always looks like collection of random scenes strewn together. ThereÂ seemsÂ to be an emphasis on the idea of mentoring (Arya/The Hound, Tywin/Tommen, Tyrion/Pod, Sansa/LF) but it's all over the place, so nothing coherent ever emerges.Â

Â 
Â 
That's one Â problem in making Tommen, what, 12 or 13 instead of the 9-or-10-year old I think he was supposed to be at Joffrey's death; it will be less believable that Tommen, as King, will still act in a childish way. Â This boy looks a bit too old to be outlawing beets and getting pleasure banging down the royal seal and playing with his kittens. Â 
Â 
Tywin wasn't wrong, necessarily, but he came off as rather self-serving, as if he was practically directing the kid to shut up, appoint Grandpa Hand, and do what the Hand/Council says forever. Â
593	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-20	So was anyone else getting the vibe that Tywin sanctioned the Joffrey hit besides me? Â Or is that silly?

594	ViennaGirl	2014-04-20	I think the "Jaime rapes Cersei" thing totally messed up the end of A Feast For Crows with the "I love you, I love you, I love you" letter from Cersei to Jaime, doesn't it? If she still writes him that letter after being raped, that is F*KKED UP.


Â 
I agree that he raped her in that scene, but she's very messed up and could later tell him she loves him. I mean, yes, f-ed up, but also par for the course for Cersei.

Â 
I doubt he approved of it in advance, but once the shock wore off I'm sure he saw the potential upside.Â  He was already worried about what kind of a king Joff was becoming. In the book he was able to say "He's only 13, there's time," but with Joff being aged up in the show, he basically had to accept that Joff wasn't going to improve.
Â 
Tommen, on the other hand, shows no psycho tendencies and is young enough to be trained, something Tywin set about taking care of almost before Joff's body was cool.
597	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-20	No he shoved it off the railing into the boat with Dontos. The necklace that is. Tried to put the question in here but I'm new to all this :-/

Â 
Yes. They could leave off the kittens, the beets-outlawing, etc., and still make Tommen a credibly pliable puppet. Tywin seemed to have him in hand in this episode with just a few shrewd words. Tommen need not be hopelessly childish, just sweet, trusting, and easily manipulated, like Sansa circa AGOT.
Â 
He didn't steal it, he paid the iron price 
Â 
Did the Hound kill the guy? I thought he just clubbed him.

Â 
i was wondering if i just didn't remember them being so brutal. i mean ygritte seems to be out of control. all that just because she was dumped? sad. really sad.

Littlefinger pretty clearly demonstrated that all the other stones are just made of glass or whatever, I thought, based on that.
Â 
Though that raises problems of its own, since that necklace doesn't seem to have a "front" or "back", so Sansa could easily have put it on with the poisoned one on the other side.


I thought Lady Olena in the show fixed both sides of Sansa's hair so perhaps she just grabbed whichever stone came off easily. The other stones looked firmly fixed.
Â 
In the book Sansa still has the hairnet so maybe the show is wrapping up the speculation that Sansa will poison LF using a stone in tWoW.
Â 
Â 
I LOVED Tywins speech to Tommen and of course the entire Arya/Hound relationship. Honestly I was kind of hoping to see Ser Jorah walk though the sewers to get into Mereen but I guess we wont find out about his betrayal until later (if at all)
609	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-20	really dug this episode. the jaime thing was kind of meh, but i dont mind that much. i think they're doing his arc differently, so i'll let that play out before judgement
littlefinger seriously sounds more and more like batman every season
tywin/tommen was amazing. loved it
stannis cracked me up. i think that was a really good scene for him. and nice shout out to the gc.
arya/sandor was fantastic as usual. when she said "father!" when the hound interupted the guy, i was literally rotflol. how she said it was sooooo funny. and i was fist pumping for the tully love
i usually hate dany, but i really liked her scene. the duel was cool and i really liked the broken collars.
sam and gilly are sooo cute. love them
and are we supposed to know that the qot poisoned joffers yet? i was kind of confused about that.

I haven't seen the episode yet, I'm going on what's been reported here -- that a "King Orys" was mentioned as being killed by his brother.
Â 
There's an unexplained gap in the Royal Targaryen House tree at http://awoiaf.wester...Family_tree.jpg


Â 
There was a Great Council after Jaehaerys to decide the successor and Viserys was chosen.
611	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-20	Hate that they had the Hound steal, after he said he wasn't a thief and hated that Jaime raped Cersei. 
Me too. But "You are the worst SHIT in the seven kingdoms!" Was great. I love Arya
612	NightStark	2014-04-20	Â 
Why not? King Thanduil rides an (Irish) elk in The Hobbit movies.


Â 
Think of the logistics of it in the show, they can't show the direwolves for more than 2 seconds because of the budget and people expect a guy riding an elk.
613	Zman1863	2014-04-20	The opening scene was pretty bad too. Like instantly everyone knows Sansa has run off. Completely implausible that Cersei and Tywin would be aware of that so soon. And the fact of their knowing makes it implausible that Sansa would successfully get away.Â
614	marsyao	2014-04-20	Something doese not feel right, if Tywin promised red vipe the let him "have a conversation" with Mountain, then why would red vipe want to be Tyrion's champion? He did this in the novel exactly because Tywin refuse to sacrifice Mountain

Â 
It doesnt really matter though because the character isnt in the show. So, its highly unlikely that was his mount.
Â 
Even moreso since he rode an elk and not a horse.
616	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-20	Could Orys be a substitute for Aenys? He was followed by Maegor the Cruel.


Â 
Hah, could be they changed Aenys' name because "Aenys" makes people snicker. (We were talking about that on the "strange names" thread recently.)

Oh I'm sure Tywin will double cross him at some point.
Â 
Or Oberyn will get SMOKING GUN evidence that Tywin gave the order.Â

Either Tywin goes back on his word (which would be kind of ridiculous considering that he just made the offer like two days earlier), or they're going to have Oberyn become champion because he's convinced by Saint Tyrion's goodness and innocence.
623	HouseHarrison	2014-04-20	I assumed this "King Orys" was a King of one of the Seven Kingdoms pre-conquest. Maybe even a Lannister. The story certainly doesn't match any Targ King.

Â 
I suppose that's possible, except I got the impression Orys was a Valyrian name, which is why Aegon's half brother had it and it has that "ys" ending (like Rhaenys, Viserys, Daenerys, etc. ad nauseum.) Unless Orys Baratheon was named by his mother and she was a Westerosi...ugh.
Â 
I don't know why D&D would need to add more lore. Isn't there already enough in the books for them to work with? *Headdesk*

Â 
totally agree. to be honest, cersei's reaction to all of this has seemed to be too quick to me, starting with last week when she began accusing tyrion before one full minute had passed after joff's death.
627	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2014-04-20	Wasnt there an Orys Baratheon? Maybe he was referencing a Storm King?

Â 
Â 


Â 
He doesn't, necessarily.Â  He's just throwing it out there because he thinks it might help sway Oberyn.
Â 
Also if I recall the Tywin/Joffrey convo last season it's less that Tywin thought it was complete bullshit and more that she was too far away to matter.Â  So if he, in his mind, overstates the "clear and present" aspect of Dany's danger and makes it more persuasive, then it serves its purpose.

Â 
Â 

Don't know if he believes in it, just saying that because he thinks it's will have more impact on Oberyn accepting his proposal. 
Also thought that scene was sweet since Oberyn should know about Doran's plan. Now he will be on the inside and gets the chance to "meet" the Mountain! 2 for 1's!!
631	Seer of Green	2014-04-20	Pod meets Brienne outside KL now?

I think he'll meet up with Brienne as she's leaving. Tyrion told him to get out of Kings Landing so there's the logic for him leaving with Brienne.

Orys Baratheon was the King's Hand for Aegon the Conqueror, and rumored to be a bastard Targaryen. He founded the Baratheon line, but never sat the Iron Throne (in the books, anyway!)

Yeah, just went and read his wiki entry. Think I had his name in my head from reading the sample chapter of World of Ice and Fire. Guess it was just the show inventing a character. Silly since there are so many Targ kings they couldve used.

Â 
1. TV Tyrion demands Pod flee for his own safety, while Book Tyrion does no such thing (even though it would have been equally prudent advice).
2. TV Tyrion refuses to believe that Sansa had anything to do with Joffrey's death, while Book Tyrion strongly suspects she was in on it, even if he knows she could not have done it alone. (I suppose TV Tyrion could change his mind over the course of the season, but still.)
Â 
Maaaaaan, it's going to be one hell of a turn for the character when he murders Tywin and Shae. Yikes. The viewers will all have whiplash.

Uhm, Tywin never said he is going to *kill* the Mountain. So then ,during the trial, Oberyn assumes Tywin offers him the chance to kill the Mountain, like he promised. It would make sense for Tywin, he kills two birds with one stone - acquitting his son Tyrion and keeping his promise to Oberyn.
Tywin, on the other hand, who doesn't care too much about his son, is ok with whatever outcome the trial has  Either his enemy Oberyn is killed on his own accord, or he comes out happy because he got his revenge. 
The perfect strategy, right? What did I miss?
647	Ran	2014-04-20	Well, the possibility never comes up because it's highly unlikely. After all, no one bothers to question him about Tyrion, or to try and get him to testify against Tyrion. He's just a boy that most people think is a lackwit because he can barely talk.
648	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	TV Tommen is...interesting. Despite being older, he still seems easily manipulated by Tywin...although, to be fair, Tywin was not wrong in anything that he said.

Â 
To quote King Robert re: Jon Arryn.Â  "it's not his fault I didn't listen."

While Cersei probably at least listened to Tywin's lecture series on Political Science she seems to have misinterpreted the message/drawn the wrong conclusions.Â  To Tywin's enduring chagrin.

Mole's Town really doesn't seem safer than Castle Black to be honestÂ

658	ohpooratlas	2014-04-20	Creepy!Littlefinger is back! This both excites me and disturbs me all at the same time.

Â 
Davos/Shireen, the Wildling raid and the siege of Meereen minus the show down with the champion (which felt really anticlimactic to me) kind of sort of saved it.
Â 
I'm going to pretend that horrific Jaime/Cersei scene did not happen.

670	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-20	All this talk about how Tyrion has been white washed made me think: I guess I always thought he was a good guy. As far as Pod goes he didn't have the opportunity in the book to tell Pod to run for his life. They weren't threatening/questioning Bronn so there wasn't any reason for Tyrion to make the parallel to Pod. They never asked Pod to testify & if I remember correctly when Tyrion asks Pod if he thinks he did it Pod indicates that he does or at the very least doesn't answer. What did he do in the books that was so bad? I love Tyrion btw so maybe I'm blind to his evilness? He is a shit sometimes but I felt like he was a pretty decent guy in the books...
671	booknerd2	2014-04-20	Also, didnt the hound say he wasn't a thief two episodes ago?

I would imagine the point being that the Hound is a hypocrite who is as bad as the men he condemns.
675	Rockroi	2014-04-20	Were you listening?
Â 
What I liked
Â 
The Counsel We Keep: The episodeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s overarching theme seemed to be, â<U+0080><U+009C>Just Who Do We Listen Toâ<U+0080><U+009D> and it has ever-lasting consequences.Â  Its true if you are the new ruler of Westeroes; its true of you are Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Wife and need to go away; its true if you are the Mother of Dragons and its true if you are Pod.Â  Who do we listen to?Â  
Â 
Tywin Lannister, once again, without question, owned.Â  We know that; we knew it before, it is known.Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not just that Tywin was giving sage counsel to a worthy vessel.Â  Its that not only did Tywin get Tommen to move TOWARDS Tywin, but that it was who Tywin got Tommen to AWAY from.Â  
Â 
In other words, Cersei is not going to ruin two kings.Â 
Â 
Â 
And nobody is going to rape Gilly.
Â 
And when your mother says â<U+0080><U+009C>runâ<U+0080><U+009D> YOU RUN! 
Â 
And a fool and his silver are soon parted.
Â 
And Stannis is about to get some money.
Â 
And when you see a bunch of broken shackles getting thrown over the wallâ<U+0080>¦ whoa re YOU going to listen to?Â  
Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the thing about wise counsel- it comes in all forms.Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s who we chose to listen to that matters most. Â ThisÂ was even clear in the scene with Thorn and John Snow- wisdom is wisdom, even when it sucks and you have to turn your backs (in this case literally) on people who are helpless. Â (And I loved Pyp- I don't think I could kill 100 wildlings either).
Â 
The Deals We Make: Sansa and Peytre was very well laid out; we know why that deal is happening.Â  Sansa wanted out and Petyr wants in (and yes- thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a double entendre right there).Â  And obviously, Tywin and Obyrn Martell is about two men getting what they want, and that sometimes you are a powerful man and a pawn all at the same time.Â  But sometimes- you just canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say â<U+0080>no.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  And sometimes, we just need to talk to our brother.Â  Tyrion reaching out to Jaime is going to be great.Â  
Â 
The One True Hand: Tywin is the King in everything but name.Â  So, therefore, I think the best Hand in the show is Davos, and its incredible how he speaks to his King and how that is a worthy and deserved dialog.Â  I hope hope HOPE that viewers appreciate that Stannis is actually the wisest ruler of them all BECAUSE he listens to wise counsel.Â  Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s why he is still out there and Robb, Renly, Balon and Joff are worm food.Â  
Â 
And listening to Davis bitch about Stannis to his daughter was gold.Â  
Â 
Not So Sure:
Â 
It Should Have Been Selmy: Look, it was a fine scene, but â<U+0080>¦. At some point I kinda want to see what makes him a great swordsman other than lip-service.Â  We already saw Daario fight and we have seen Mormont kill like 20 guys; it would be nice to see Selmy do SOMETHING other than look tired.Â  I thought that was a perfect opportunity.Â  NO biggie but â<U+0080>¦. 
Â 
The Hound and The Actor We Now Know People Want To Watch In a Meaningless Scene:Â  I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t dislike the Hound and Aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene and I thought it had a great message at the end, but there is a part of me that wonders if we could have gotten more accomplished in those 8 minutes.Â  I think the scene told us a bunch of stuff we already knew- that the Hound is an asshole (Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m cool with that) and that he is a difficult and angry man who will do what it takes to survive.Â  The scene we saw- while funny and fun and interesting was also â<U+0080>¦. Something we already sort of knew.Â  I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099> need to see it again.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t MIND seeing it but â<U+0080>¦ We could have NOT had that scene and been just as well off.Â  I think the show knows what the viewers like and â<U+0080><U+009C>Aryaâ<U+0080><U+009D>: trends well on Twitter.Â  Soâ<U+0080>¦. Yeahâ<U+0080>¦ Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind but I think its pandering.Â  
Â 
What IÂ didn'tÂ Like:
Â 
Nothing specifically.Â  
Â 
I felt this was a slow episode that did a lot of things very well.Â  Certainly, it slowed the pace considering 2 of the last 4 episodes has had a major, story-altering death.Â  This episode slowed things up, reminded the viewers where we all were and toned down the pacing.Â  I thought it was a third-best episode of the season, and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actually a good thing. Â

Oh, snap.
Â 
Yeah, that is dumb. He made it pretty clear he had a code.Â 


Who needs continuity when you have bewbs.
677	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	Â 
Since Sansa has nothing to do with death of the King, how could she know her life is in danger? Following a strange to someplace Gods know where would be much more dangerous.


Â 
Because she knows that KL is the worst place for her to live? Besides, Dontos says it clear: if she doesn't follow him, she might die. Maybe Sansa thought she might have died for real if staying, like they were meant to be all murdered, like the Red Wedding.
678	nara	2014-04-20	Â 
Having said that, I do have to agree that the Jaime/Cersei sept scene was just cringe-inducing (probably the sole negative aspect of the episode for me), made even worse by the fact that Cogman confirmed that it was intended to look 100% consensual.


If that is what the showrunners believe is consensual sex, I think they have a very warped perspective on sex.Â 
Â 
Â 


About Tommen's age and his marriage to Margaery...
Â 
Did anyone notice that as Tywin and Tommen were walking away, Tywin was telling Tommen about the need to marry and continue the family line?
Â 
The rest of the conversation went like this:
Â 
Tywin: To continue the family line. Do you know how that happens?
Tommen: Yes.
Tywin: Has anyone explained the details to you?
Tommen: I don't think so.
Tywin: It's all relatively straightforward...
Â 
Hmmm. Sansa and Tyrion never wound up consummating their marriage, either, but Tywin giving Tommen the talk? I wonder.
Â 
TV Tommen is...interesting. Despite being older, he still seems easily manipulated by Tywin...although, to be fair, Tywin was not wrong in anything that he said.


Â 
The moment they aged up Tommen, I started to wonder if he would consummate the marriage to Marg.Â  This convo supported that idea...
Â 


Well, I don't know why everybody is so upseted about Jaimie/Cersei sex scene. It was not rape! In the book, he finds her alone with Joff's body and takes her right there, while she says "stop, Jaimie, please, not here, not now".Â 
What's the difference?
If that was rape, so it was in the books. The problem, I see, is that book Cersei doesn't care about it, she just accept the rape thing so she can control others (just like happens with one of the Kettleblacks).


Â 
In the book, she says no kind of feebly but then gives in to their passions.Â  Here, she was saying no the whole time.
Â 
Okay, clearly like most people, I was disturbed by the Jaime/Cersei sept scene, which I confess I liked in the books.Â  It did feel rapey and the only reasons for it that I can think are 1) to make Jaime less sympathetic because he had become so in Season 3 and 2) to push off Jaime/Brienne shippers, because there is no way Brienne can end up with a man who raped his sister.Â  He has paid the price for Bran with his hand, but this was nuts.
Â 
I also think they felt that they made the Hound too funny and nice, so they had him steal the silver to keep him grey.
Â 
Love the new Tommen.Â  Unlike Joff, he actually looks like he could be Jaime's son.Â  I liked the convo with Tywin, but I thought it strange that Tywin would be so insensitive to Cersei.Â  This is the man who didn't want her to know that that Tyrells had rejected the marriage between her and WIllas.Â  It looks like they are setting up for a break between Tywin and Cersei...
Â 
I liked new Daario (especially his naked woman hilted dagger -- which I thought was a nice detail from the books) and I thought this was a reasonable way to continue the Dany/Daario relationship.Â  I thought they could have drawn out his fight a little more.Â Random thought-- during the pissing match, the thought popped into my head "I wonder if the actors were told to come to the set with their bladders full?"Â 
Â 
I thought Sansa's escape was fine, but yeah, how did it suddenly become dark?Â 
Â 
When LF told her to call him Petyr, I was immediately grossed out.Â  Also, I get that she's a tall actress, but somehow he's less scary when he's so much shorter than her.Â  Can they not put some lifts in his shoes?
Â 
Wildling attack was great and well done.Â  Loved that Ygritte shot the first arrow.Â  ANOTHER example of them greying a character that had become too sympathetic.Â  Same with Jon suggesting that going after the mutineers was more important that protecting the smallfolk who were being attacked.Â  Starting to see signs of the Lord Commander who forced Gilly to leave her child.
679	Newstar	2014-04-20	All will be forgiven if Tyrion eventually starts cursing Sansa for abandoning him later on or starts thinking she's too dumb to pull off something like that.
Â 
Yes. It seems like TV Tyrion thinks Sansa's too nice to poison Joffrey, not that she's too stupid to pull it off by herself. That could change, of course. It's a bit early to pass judgment on that bit. Tyrion and Pod, on the other hand...
Â 
Book Tyrion: Doesn't give a fuck about Pod's safety, tells him "You've been a good squire to me. Better than I deserved."
TV Tyrion: Tearfully sends Pod away from KL for his own protection, tells him "There has never lived a more loyal squire."
Â 
...You see where I'm going with this?
Â 
Â 
Â 
"Elyo Grivas"?!
Â 
Ran, are your ears burning? 
Â 
Â 
The moment they aged up Tommen, I started to wonder if he would consummate the marriage to Marg.Â  This convo supported that idea...
Â 
Well, the notion of Sansa/Tyrion sex was bandied about in a few non-book conversations in the show, and that marriage wasn't consummated either, so I don't know that the conversation Means Something in terms of a deviation from the books, but yeah, I wonder.

680	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-20	All this talk about how Tyrion has been white washed made me think: I guess I always thought he was a good guy. As far as Pod goes he didn't have the opportunity in the book to tell Pod to run for his life. They weren't threatening/questioning Bronn so there wasn't any reason for Tyrion to make the parallel to Pod. They never asked Pod to testify & if I remember correctly when Tyrion asks Pod if he thinks he did it Pod indicates that he does or at the very least doesn't answer. What did he do in the books that was so bad? I love Tyrion btw so maybe I'm blind to his evilness? He is a shit sometimes but I felt like he was a pretty decent guy in the books...


Â 
Tyrion is a pretty good guy given his upbringing and the society he lives in, but he's also the guy who, among other things, had a guy who tried to extort him murdered and then disposed of the body in a public food source (YUCK!).Â  That's not really a "decent guy" sort of thing to do in my book.Â Â
681	NightStark	2014-04-20	Â

Â 
Exactly, it would click with her when he said that that she'll be a suspect.
682	Zman1863	2014-04-20	I don't have too much problem with the Tyrion/Pod scene. As Ran said, the show and the book present different situations. In the book Pod is completely under the radar while in the show, he is not. I think if presented with such a situation, book Tyrion would not have been as indifferent to Pod at the end as he had been.Â 
Â 
Still, in general, D&D seem to be set in their ways in how they portray characters. They are hell bent on portraying a sympathetic Cersei, bad Jaime, bad Stannis and good Tyrion.Â
683	johnnysd	2014-04-20	Â 
i have to say this episode is making me think shireen might really have a chance at winning this thing! so many changes to a book character are met with moaning and groaning but making shireen more of a round, dynamic character is a great improvement, imho.
Â 
Â 
I have thought for a long time that in the end Shireen sits the Iron Throne. The direction and scenes with her in the show are strengthening those thoughts.
Â 
Great episode. Cersei's consent should have been clearer but there will be 100,000 angst riddled posts of indignation about it. Recasting Tommen was a good call it seems. Tywins scene with him was awesome. I predict a Tower of Joy tree vision this year.

If that is so, Sansa would have gone with the Hound in the night of battle of balckwater bay, at least she knew the Hound well, and she knew the Hound was always kind to her

Covering for Jaime and Cersei over Bran's "accident"
Winding Thorne up just because he can
Breaking Marillion's fingers (for mocking him, despite Tyrion doing this to others)
Finding Masha Heddles murder amusing
Giving the antler men, without trial to Joff to "play with"
Letting the Mountain men rape and murder in KL (arming them so they are now raping and murdering in the vale)
Hitting Shae
Being part of the forced marriage to Sansa (breaking his sworn oath to exchange her for Jaime)
Kidnapping Tommen and threatening to rape him
Organising for Myrcella to go to Dorne
The general pity parties
And all that is before we get to Essos and the rape of a slave that takes place.
Â 
Edit: Forgot about Singer Stew. He could have sent Shae away.

She didn't go with him because she thought it was a trap...if you were her and a king who people know you have a grievance with is dying and someone tells you 'come with me if you want to live'..you're going to go unless you want your neck snipped.

Yeah, I think that's a shame.

Haha! Yeah I suppose not but it was to protect Shae. That has to count for something right? I guess I get so wrapped up in all the other evils in KL that Tyrion seems not so bad. I think he usually tries to do the right thing but he hasn't really ever been taught the right thing so he kind of has to figure it out on his own.
691	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-20	Jaime. Does. Not. Rape. Cersei. Goddamn it he's practically her bitch. WHY?! Everyone here knows I'm down with most show changes. Most times I get, from a TV narrative perspective, why they tweaked things. I'm sooooo confused now! I don't see why Cersei couldn't be reluctant at first but clearly get turned on and dive in for some griefsex. She's feeling a ton of emotions and Jaime's right there and they're emotionally pretty codependent. I'd buy it if they sort of lost it and had rough-and-tumble sex that was full of raw emotion, psychologically unhealthy, but dammit they're broken people and sometimes they seem to fill each others' cracks. FUCK.Â 
Â 
-quick breath-
Â 
Back to scheduled hashing.Â 
Â 
I really like Tommen. His interaction with Tywin was so so so good. I loved how Tywin was getting his measure, a bit like Halfhand in the books gained Jon's measure by leaving him with Ygritte. Mostly curious to see what he would do. But still he's Tywin so he's not going to take Tommen out for a root beer float and praise his shitty crayon drawings. He's gonna tell him what's what. I was really drunk while watching this so I need to rewatch for deeper facial observations, but it seemed like Tywin was breathing an internal sigh of relief when Tommen arrived at the correct answer with minimal prompting. Plus, Tommen's a cutie patootie. I really bought Cersei's broken grief too. So sad she'll ask her father to stop talking about her son, but also so shattered she won't do a thing to stop him from doing it. Fuck man.Â 
Â 
JON! MIP!!!!! Fuck yes this is the Jon I started liking in ADWD! I loved him agreeing with Thorne. It especially works if Thorne is replacing some of Noye' role. They might dislike each other but for Jon it's important to learn that you can work with people you dislike if you put on your big-boy boxers and look at the issues. Also giggled at Gold Cloak Fucker getting all fist-pumpy. Oh my fucking sweetheart you want to make friends...hahaha no most likely you're responsible for some of these scumbags ending up at the Wall in the first place.Â 
Â 
Arya and the Hound! Ahahahaha Arya being quick to pretend to be Sandor's daughter cracked me up. She is learning how to act and assume a persona...total potential for being an assassin. The Hound was in raging dick mode but he had a point. Jeez if that daddy dude had stopped to tell Locke to GTFO his land, he'd be listening to Baby Ramsay stories as Locke broke his kneecaps. Also, the Hound being affectionate to Stranger! D'awwww! It also seems like the Hound is somewhat getting used to the idea of Arya sticking with him, regardless of what distant kin she has. Kind of cute in a weird way. Lol, I'm imaging Sellsword Adventures with Sandor and his Bitchy Squire. Speaking of squires...
Â 
POD! OMG Pod becoming a man! Surely the work of his ladyfriends. I loved him sneaking in Tyrion decent food. Yeah sure Tyrion's whitewashed, yadayada not a thing that can be done to change it so I'm not judging. As it stands, I liked their interaction. Tyrion doesn't tell him to accept the offer, 'cause heck no he's no martyr for stupid causes, but tells Pod to run for it. Nice setup for his adventuring with Brienne...I think she and Pod are really well-matched in terms of loyalty.Â 
Â 
Oh, loyalty! Not Littlefinger! WTF. Gillian is such a damn troll with his "LULZ! It's not creepy it's paternal!" Weird that LF's suddenly Irish but hahahaha he looks like he wants to slam Sansa against the ship rail and make out with her. Can't resist showing off by fucking up her jewelry, as it gives him a chance to touch her neck.Â 
Â 
Amused to see Margaery speak of her fanon "curse" regarding hubbies. Nice to see her seeming more her age than the calm cool manipulator. She's good and she's savvy, but like Black Widow, she only pretends to know everything.Â 
Â 
Unlike Oberyn who does know everything. As a lady with similar preferences, I had to tip my glass. Cool too to see Ellaria more amused than anything at Olyvar's attempt at kissing a lady. He's rather charming, truth be told. His bantering with Oberyn was amusing, as was Ellaria getting a bit friskier and claiming her man. D'aaaw! Then in comes Tywin and I nearly died at Oberyn's "seat" comment. Obviously Tywin was implying he'd give Oberyn a murderfest of the Mountain (and probs refer him to Roose Bolton for some l33t torture tips) if he helped condemn Tyrion. I actually really liked Tywin acknowledging the realm is in far deeper shit than he's let on. I kinda feel sorry for him, having to smirk and make light when shit's getting real. Maybe he should get some help...
Â 
...Like Westeros' ball-busting Shireen. OMG I squeed so loud at how pissy she was getting. She is such her daddy's daughter and it's adorable and made me feel warm fuzzies for Stannis. "RAWR don't mouth the words you're not a child!!!!" Yeah the "Iron Bank Eureka!!!" moment was a little heavy-handed but the non book-reader hasn't gotten a big picture of the Iron Bank so a little bluntness helps with clarity and establishes some connective tissue. Whatever eyerolls I had died when Davos kissed Shireen's forehead. Stannis, you'd better rekindle your bromance on the boat-ride to Braavos, 'cause right now you're being a dick.Â 
Â 
Speaking of dicks, or rather a lack of, imma still eyerolling at Dany's "FREE DAH SLAVES" speeches...especially since I didn't see any trailing group of freed Yunkai slaves...maybe they all died of starvation since it's not like Dany's heard of "supply trains." Â But she was cool telling her advisers why she wouldn't spend them. Fuck Dany, this moment was about new!Daario. And screw canon, I'm ok with Daario not being a creepy-ass Eurotrash greaseball. I LIKE the Mereenese Blot's theory he's an embodiment of war and you're supposed to be thinking "Dany wtf bb girl y r u doing this?!" but I feel that way enough about Dany already so adding a stoopid boyfriend is only going to be more irritating...in short I like the TV's version of Daario being charming, but still with a commoner's streak. Fuck Strong Belwas that Scrappy did nothing but remind me of a watered down version of that Sumo guy from the Jackie Chan Adventures. I liked how Daario didn't even give Mr. Plume de Lance a chance to get up. Â 
Â 
Here endeth my self-righteous rambling?Â

Â 
I don't think they don't trust us, it's because they don't have the time we have. GRRM can count with hundreds of pages to define a character, they have only 55 minutes and they need to rush, even if some actions are over the top and less ambiguous that in the books.
693	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-20	I like how Team Dany is all "Lemme take this chump on!" and shes all "You lot are too valuable." But Daario is all "Im not." and shes all "K, Go for it, hot stuff." and he does. It made me smile. Plus Dany makes a really great face during that scene where shes all staring up at the Meereen wall. If someone has a gif of it, ill love them 5ever. She wasÂ practicingÂ that face.Â 
Â 
Jaime/Cersei scene, its squicky as all hell regardless how you cut the mustard. And its a hatefuck on top of it. He really is beginning to loathe Cersei in a way. Its a very grim way of showing it too. It makes the scene all the more uncomfortable as it should be. Cersei is obviously objecting because of where they are. Cuz come on...Its not "No i dont want to screw" as much as "No i dont want to screwÂ here." The scene was really just dueagh. Even if she was not protesting too much, it would still be dueagh.
Â 
Sandor and Arya slayed me. Arya is getting quick on the draw with lying. Sandor proves that hes still a shit. A pointy turd too.
Â 
Sam taking Gilly to Mole's Town irked me but oh well.

Um, no, the Queen of Thorns did not give Sansa the hairnet in the book.Â  Dontos did.Â  And Littlefinger explicitly said that he and Olenna were in league (or, rather, that he'd manipulated her into doing what he wanted).

Â 
I definitely got that sense from the book, because if LF didn't tip off Olenna, how would she know that those "purple amethysts" were actually crystallized poison?Â  She had to have some foreknowledge, and LF was the only source for it.Â  I can't see it making any sense for Olenna to just suddenly notice out of the blue, "Oh hey, Sansa Stark is wearing poison crystals in her hair. What an unusual fashion choice. Perhaps I'll help myself to one and use it to poison my odious grandson-in-law."Â  She had to have known. Ergo she and LF were in on it together. See?

Is Marillion the creepy singer with Lysa?
What could he do to stop the mountain men? 
He never has the chance to exchange Sansa for Jaime she is gone by the time Jaimee gets there. 
He would never really have raped Tommen he was just playing up the "I'm an evil monster" that Cersei believes he is in an attempt to keep the whore safe. 
Sending Myrcella to Dorne was one of the best things he could do! It kept her safe from the upcoming battle in KL. Out of the influence of her wicked mother & formed an alliance with Dorne... how was that bad?

QoT never gave the hairnet to Sansa, It was a gift from Dontos, both in the book and in TV show. The only change is it became a necklace. The book implies the LF/QoT thing.

Â 
2. Kingslayer, child attempt murderer, sister-f***er, kinslayer... And now rapist... God, even Ramsay has better track record than TV JaimeÂ  Â  Â  Â  
Â 
3. Daario "expendable" Naharis
Â 
4. Long live the new King... Not cute child we all love, but good enough. Nice conversation with Tywin
Â 
5. Didn't Hound say something about not stealing in premiere this season? God, people change fast...
Â

703	Baitac	2014-04-20	I guess the Queen must have thought that Sansa should go to her aunt's with her devoted friend. I hope she was tricked by Littlefinger's acting rather than send her off knowing how he felt about Sansa. I thought that the QoT had come to like Sansa in earnest.

3. Daario "expendable" Naharis

That was one of the best parts omg!Â
706	marsyao	2014-04-20	The show treat Bronn much kindly, but Bronn the novel version is more believable, but since he is now a fan favorite, so they make him a better man

Hah, could be they changed Aenys' name because "Aenys" makes people snicker. (We were talking about that on the "strange names" thread recently.)


Â 
"King Aenys the First"?
But it's a joke name, ser! Â Like Seymour Butts or Heywood Jablowmee. Â

Or else she planned to throw Sansa to the lions but LF secretly asked Dontos to get her out.
Â 
That explains why he killed Dontos, it would have been a fruitless move if the QoT knew where she was anyway.

But how could she pin Sansa as the killer? Plus, how would pinning Sansa for the murder have benefited the QoT?
710	rmholt	2014-04-20	Wow that was different! Yesterday I didn't think they needed Shae for a trial. Now I'm thinking they aren't going to even have a trial and go straight to trial by combat. Tywin gets rid of Tyrion and Oberyn ( he hopes) or at worst gets rid of a The Mountain and gives Dorne an out ( which they might not be satisfied with). The battle with Meereen's champion was probably a lot better for nonbookreaders.  It's too bad they ditched Belwas - he was useful in these little ways.  The whole lead up to the battle at the Wall is boring. This wasn't a great episode and I'm particularly offended by the rape which wasn't necessary. Still awesome scenery. It was nice to see Carcetti, I mean LF, again. I was also annoyed he snarfed up the necklace. The poison hairnet's fate was never spelled out. It was last seen in Sansa's possession with remaining stones...or possibly more poison

Jaime/Cersei scene, its squicky as all hell regardless how you cut the mustard. And its a hatefuck on top of it. He really is beginning to loathe Cersei in a way. Its a very grim way of showing it too. It makes the scene all the more uncomfortable as it should be. Cersei is obviously objecting because of where they are. Cuz come on...Its not "No i dont want to screw" as much as "No i dont want to screwÂ here." The scene was really just dueagh. Even if she was not protesting too much, it would still be dueagh.


Â 
And they missed a golden opportunity to have Joffrey's corpse fall on them during it.
712	greensleeves	2014-04-20	I haven't had time to read the thread so I'll just post my initial observations:
Â 
The good:
Â 
- Sophie Turner is wonderful.
Â 
- Gilly and Sam are adorable.
Â 
- I kind of liked the Meeren stuff.
Â 
The bad:
Â 
- Â I'm so glad we got back to Littlefinger's brothel (aka the most important location in Westeros)... I mean it had been a whole episode.Â   Â Well, at least this time we got some male nudity. Â On the other hand, at least that dude got some lines that showed an actual point of view; the naked women (there and in mole's town) were still just decorative objects.
Â 
- Jaime raping Cersei... WTF?!?!???
713	NightStark	2014-04-20	Wow that was different! Yesterday I didn't think they needed Shae for a trial. Now I'm thinking they aren't going to even have a trial and go straight to trial by combat.


Â 
We just saw Tywin arranging the trial and the season trailer shows Cersei giving evidence and Tyrion walking into a hall in chains.
714	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-20	I normally dont care much for Dany scenes, but i really enjoyed this one. Clarke really does shine with ham and action. New!Daario is shaping up to be pretty good and hes a lot quicker on the draw with his lines. (he still has his naked lady hilts btw. I looked.) That whole scene was just really fun and im really excited to see how the Ghiscari are portrayed. I cant wait to meet the Shavepate. I think we got our first look at Hizdahr. There was a man who was very prominent in the scenes, staring down from the city walls.Â 
Â 


Â 
And they missed a golden opportunity to have Joffrey's corpse fall on them during it.


Omg i so thought that was gonna happen! D: The whole scene is just...
715	joaozinm	2014-04-20	Strong Belwas broke the horse's leg, allowed his enemy to risk his belly just for the scar, killed the man, took a shit upon his face, wipe his ass with the dead defiant cloak, killed the fucking horse, went back smiling and saying something funny. Dont fucking daario expendable me.

Â 
Lolz, I'm surprised they didn't think of that! It's not the most comfortable scene in the books. Twincest in a church next to a twincest kid. At least in the book it was consensual. Watching it for a second time I think they might not have meant to make it come across as rapey as it was. But I was watching with an unsullied and I was commenting on how it was coming across as rapeyer than in the book and she just said "looks like rape to me". They seem to do whatever they can to turn people off to the series sometimes.Â 
Â 
If they were sensible they would have stuck with frigid Cersei as they had in the first episode. Just not dwell on the twincest beyond what was necessary, as the first episode of the series with Bran is. It's mind boggling that they not only stuck with the scene, but made it more worse than it is in the books.Â

717	rmholt	2014-04-20	Well I didn't watch the trailer closely enough then. Tywin's convo sounds like he's fixing the trial to go to combat, which could have happened in the book, tho it was presented as Oberyns idea.  They are taunting us that Shaw might still be around. If Tyrion demands combat early they don't need a trial, or Shae. They might use her and we are being teased, and they might have a full trial but they don't need to now that the trial by combat is pre arranged. It would just piss me to see TV Shae do a left turn and become Book Shae after they worked so hard to make the characters so different.
718	rmholt	2014-04-20	I did like the trebuchets with barrels of collars. Kind of wonder where they found the wood for it but not siege towers.

Â Watching it for a second time I think they might not have meant to make it come across as rapey as it was.Â 

Really dont think that was the intention either. Like, i think it was supposed to be "No no i dont want it here cuz reason." "Too bad." "But reasons omg.." "i dont care." "ohhhhhhh~" I think that was supposed to be the intent but it comes off like....well yeah.
720	FC_Lymond	2014-04-20	It's a mistake to have that whole scene with Bronn training Jaime last week.Â  Then poof, that plot is already gone.
Â 
I am kind of secretly glad that "Jaime's arc" has been short circuited.Â  Some people have been going on and on about that for ages.
Â 
Wilding raid was the most brutal thing this episode.Â  Did they show the kid at Castle Black afterward?

724	Bran's Legs	2014-04-20	Save Sandor! Save Sandor!
Â 
Sandor is my favorite character of the whole freaking show. The guy is a great actor and has really brought one of GRRM's best supporting characters to life. The scenes with Sandor and Arya are excellent. I was laughing my butt off during the tonight's episode so much so that I think they might have topped the chicken scene with Polliver.
Â 
I'm just going to throw this out here, but I wouldn't be upset if the show runners changed up the script with Sandor and found a larger role for him. His character can't go away and then resurface as some hired hand who has found religion. Sandor has already hinted about going across the Narrow Sea to join the sell swords. I would love for Sandor to later join up with Tryion and Jorah.
Â 
In my dream of dreams, Sandor ends up as the captain of Jon Snow's kings guard. Of course, that would be totally un-Sandor-like, but a kid can dream.

Â 
I guess we've got the only two authenticated Cersei fanatics ever as the show runners then. Of all their poor characterizations, the one of Cersei has been the worst in my opinion.Â
731	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-20	Just watched it. Random thoughts:
Â 
Sansa's escape: I liked the creepy fog a lot. LF literally ruined the scene since he showed up. He's gotten worse, I couldn't stand his voice, his mannersims, everything, I hated that performance. Cringe-worthy at best
Â 
Tywin and Tommen's conversation over Joff's dead body: A return to season 1's clumsy info-dumps. New Tommen is bland as hell, at least for now
Â 
Cersei and Jaime: He's a piece of work allright, but he's the guy who was sickened with Aerys' rapings of Rhaella. Really, the scene looked awful. If Joff's body had fallen on top of them it would have been glorious.
Â 
Sam and Gilly: Someone needs to make a Sam meme now that says, "Fears his girlfriend's gonna get raped. Takes her to a brothel". Other than that, it was fine. I like those two actors a lot.
Â 
The Wall in general: Thorne seems more reasonable and human. I like that. Harington seems to be improving. Not sure about the whole angle with the mutineers.
Â 
Wildlings being fucking wild: What's the point of making the Thenns evil cannibals if you're going to paint Ygritte and Tormund in the shame shitty light. Shouldn't they look more sympathetic?
Â 
Tyrion and Pod: Pod didn't bother me that much for like the first time. Dinklage was good too.
Â 
Tywin and Oberyn: Starting with a close-up of an ass, really? At least they're aware that the nudity itself is a joke at this point. Tywin and Oberyn was way too direct, but I liked the dialogue for some reason. Tywin said last season that Dany wasn't a threat, now he's worried. Consistency!
Â 
Dany: Daario was badass, but it could've been a great moment for Barristan to fight so viewers know he's an awesome knight. Show, don't tell, show!
Â 
Davos and Shireen: They're everything, best part of the episode for me. Give Shireen a thousand Most Improved Character from Book to Show Awards.
Â 
Margaery and Olenna: Eh, it was ok.Â 
Â 
ETA: Arya and Sandor: Very funny. Those have great comedic timing. Liked that Sandor does shitty things like in the books. I hope Arya will get more messed up and less moral soon

I did like Arya mentions her Braavosi pals
I fear Stannis will not meet his Braavosi banker in the middle of a blizzard that has paralyzed an army, carrying Reek and fake Arya. That was so cool. Instead they'll meet over brunch. At least the Golden Company has the right size.

743	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-20	I do like that Jon's showing more pragmatic reasoning. Killing the traitors so they won't say something to Mance dovetails into Jon storing Wight body parts to see how they tick. Sure there's some personal vengeance as they murdered the Old Bear, but he raises a valid point.Â 
Â 
I'll hold out judgement if Thorne's being a plain ol' douchenozzle or a Jerkass With a Point. Jon had way too thin skin (like most teenage boys) in S1 and let Thorne insult him where it hurt.Â 
Â 
'Turning consensual' is rather rife with unfortunate implications. It's sorta established in the books Cersei's "Noooo, back off...aw shuddup and do me!" is a script between them unless Jaime's extremely delusional (which seems unlikely given Cersei thinks of Robert's rape but never Jaime's). Asha and Qarl are similar. I didn't see any "turning consensual" beyond Cersei not gouging his eyes out. How does it make Cersei more sympathetic from a narrative standpoint? It doesn't connect--if they were trying to characterize her as the victim of yet another peen, there was no reason to have her worrying about him earlier. I'm just really confused.Â

745	Jasta11	2014-04-20	It was pretty good. Less so than the two previous ones but those were by and large excellent so that's to be expected. Still, it didn,t seem like the writers are losing steam.
Â 
-Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way; I wasn't a fan of the Cercei-Jaime scene, but this wasn't a book deviation. The consensuality of the sex in the novels is not clear cut, at all. Cercei repeatedly says no and voices objections, only for Jaime to ignore her, and then she says it was folly. The show did all that, without the last part. This is NOT DnD changing things around people, sorry. Jaime is not a perfect angel post-maiming and he still semi-raped his sister.
Â 
-Loved the Tommen/Tywin scene and the looks the latter gave Cercei. ''You won't screw this one up'' all over his face, eh. Also nice bits of exposition without any sex (well, during it), which is always nice.
Â 
-I love Show!Shireen. Maybe it's because in the books she's unconsequential, but the show provides a good balance of her being headstrong while remaining likeable. Helping Davos with his eureka moment helps too.
Â 
-Stannis wasn't as bad as last episode, I liked him tearing the wooden ship to pieces as a counterpart to the leeches. It also stands to reason he would listen to Melissandre with Joffrey suddendly dropping dead. His threat to Davos is also consistent with his behavior in the books. My main beef is how his resolution to go to the Wall seems utterly forgotten.
Â 
-I hate book Littlefinger, and I hate show Littlefinger even more. Ye gods, where does this guy get that accent? This is beyound creepy. I wouldn't ever trust that guy even if he came with a glowing recommendation from God himself.
Â 
-Interesting scene between Tywin and Oberyn. I liked it a lot, apart from the contractual tits and asses.
Â 
-Wildlings being wildlings I also liked. Good of them to remind us they are raiders and pillagers, even those that aren't Thenns.
Â 
-Sam and Gilly being all sappy was a bit of a waste of time. One scene was enough.
Â 
-Sandor's food-themed antics countinue. The asshole moment was in-character, and they really needed to make them drift apart so I approve of the scene.
Â 
-Dany being badass Khalessi and yadda yadda yet again. The duel was over too quickly and lame, but I liked sending the broken chains in the city, it's a great political move. And my but Emilia Clarke is sexy when she starts yelling in Valyrian. More than usual, I mean.
746	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-20	I do like that Jon's showing more pragmatic reasoning.

Â 
He can truly go either way at this point.Â  Or even have a little of both.Â  I really like show Thorne over the books.Â  He doesn't like Jon but he does listen to him.Â  Intriguing...
747	lil_z	2014-04-20	I loved this episode. I didn't entirely understand the poor episodes ratings in the ratings Thread. I presume it's from non-book readers.
Â 
I viewed much of this episode as a cliff hanger for whats to come. We see many many setups leading toward episodes to come.
Â 
I always loved the involvement of the Iron bank. Something even Tywin seems to have let slip his concern. They talk about it, but haven't done anything, with the loss of Littlefinger and now Tyrion as Masters of Coin a very un happy bank now. It also makes sense that they would fund a usurper King to see their debts paid. And getting to see some action from Stannis FINALLY!
Â 
I am curious if they are going somewhere different with Sandor's story. Its been a year since the books, but I thought he was mortally wounded by now, could be wrong. Ayra, for as much as I adore seeing her path toward an Assassin, it was good to see she has some humanity still.
Â 
I loved seeing the setup for what I assume is OberynsÂ  'The Vipers' (which I hadn't heard that name used for him yet) fight with the Mountain.
Â 
Good to see some leadership in Jon, I loved him talking good sense and strategy.
Â 
Daenerys, I actually really loved this scene. Reminds of Indiana Jones 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' were he just shoots the swordsman. I also loved the speech, and the tension between slaves and Masters. I know it's a stretch rationally, would people in slavery most likely all their lives rebel when it's not certain if She will be successful. Some would, some would wait, some would just try to run maybe. Still it all shows to me that Daenerys is becoming a Queen, a wise queen as Tyrion spoke with Tommen about, she is a wise although young ruler, and managed not to waste her army needlessly.

749	hedgeknight001	2014-04-20	The Sept scene was by far the best in the episode. Grandfather Tywin and Tommen, that could have gone on for the hour. And, no, it wasn't rape. Cersei wanted it too -- that wasn't obvious?
Sansa's escape -- I thought this was well-done, concise and credible. Littlefinger is definitely getting creepy, but that's really who he is: a murdering, scheming worm. If anyone had doubts before, this scene ended them.
The Hound and Arya -- not so much this time. I get the need for character exposition, but the directors need to remember that some sense of history, people, and places should be woven into purely characterization  scenes. There just isn't the screen time to waste.
Oberyn -- oh, he's so *saucy*! Really edgy television! Look, it just isn't very interesting seeing nudity in such a "look at me," completely self-aware way. And, I dunno, but it seems they're turning Oberyn into a weak character. I'm having trouble reconciling the orgy guy with one of the most well-trained warriors in the entire continent. Oberyn just seems completely unserious. (My wife the unsullied thinks Oberyn poisoned Joffrey -- she can't imagine him fighting The Mountain, or anyone else.) Also, Tywin just walking in on the Prince of Dorne's bedchambers? No way, not unless Oberyn was going to be arrested then and there -- his bodyguards wouldn't have permitted it without a fight anyway.
Stannis and Davos -- are we supposed to be interested in seeing Stannis succeed, or not? His character has been turned into a completely unsympathetic mystic & murderer, for no apparent end. And, is the Iron Bank stuff way ahead of itself?
Dany -- oh man, was she standing to close to Daario and the champion??? It seemed like she was right behind him! I think the High Valeryan is being done well and Emma is believable with it. I actually paused the TiVo to see if the words were being dubbed. The catapults with chains in them was a good touch but this was one scene where I thought the CGI was a little off.
Sam and Gilly -- again, the character exposition is fine, but we're not learning anything.
Thenn raid & Castle Black -- the raid was overdone. Overly cruel for viewing, but also since we already know that the Thenns are being portrayed as cannibals, what was the point in the duplicative scene? Castle Black was well-done, giving us a good idea of the future power-struggles there. (My wife raised the question of whether somehow John was going to be put in charge.)
Overall, the weakest episode of the season, but not a terrible episode. I think when the show uses every moment to tell the story, and not waste screen time for shock! value, it works best.

753	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-20	Right? She has to scream it too.
Â 
I just hope if they make Thorne cooler like this, he doesnt get killed during the Battle, cuz that would be retarded.


Or he goes down like a boss, fighting a giant and four snow bears.Â 
Â 



The Sept scene was by far the best in the episode. Grandfather Tywin and Tommen, that could have gone on for the hour. And, no, it wasn't rape. Cersei wanted it too -- that wasn't obvious?


Agree with the Tommen part, but please, explain the second? I'm not being jerk I'm just curious what made you think she wanted it?
Â 
I had no problem with whores being naked in a whorehouse, in the middle of a job. Oberyn and Ellaria are bantering while treating them respectfully and not spouting so much exposition there's a need for an on-call fluffer. Teehee, Olyvar asked an honest question and Oberyn gave an honest answer. I didn't think the books gave much indication he was a savage warrior besides a mention of joining up with some mercenaries, until he ripped the Mountain a new one.Â

Oh, and you brought it up in the NO SPOILER positive nitpick thread, but I'm replying here cuz it's spoilery:
Â 
Isn't it funny how Jon Snow clearly and logically vocalizes his plans and intentions and the why of what he wants to do in a way that other people [Thorne] can understand and respect and even agree with?Â  This is like, the opposite of how he handles business in ADWD and part of what gets him a belly full of knives
757	Darth Pipes	2014-04-20	Forgot to mention, we finally hear Sam the Slayer!Â  Makes sense that Ser Alliser would call him that and that it would be used as a mocking nickname.
758	T.C	2014-04-21	I still think Tommen still should have the same actor, especially for next season. I picture the little actor being scared of those certain scenes over the one we have now.
759	hedgeknight001	2014-04-21	Agree with the Tommen part, but please, explain the second? I'm not being jerk I'm just curious what made you think she wanted it?

She was kissing him back, wasn't she? That's the way I recall the scene. That by definition means consent.
True, it was forceful, or perhaps *frantic* might be a better term.
760	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-21	I liked Tommen because he was such a contrast to Joffers. He's honest with his grandpa, not getting defensive he doesn't know something. It reminded be of that scene in Best Served Cold where Cosca's hanging out with a Duke's heir. He's heard the son is a total pussy, but thinks to himself how the young man seems thoughtful and respectful instead a reckless milksop. I don't think Tywin was just flattering him when he said "you have the right temperament for it." Maybe he was solely meaning "you're my little bitch" but it didn't seem like veiled condescension.Â 
Â 
Balances out the thought-train of "zomg Joffrey was a psycho 'cause he was inbred. Khaleesi is cool though!" ... Khaleesi has like 400 years of inbreeding on Joffrey...
Â

Erm at first when they were still standing, then she pushed him away. She was shoving his mouth away as he dragged her to the ground though, and yelping as he moved. I have nothing against rough sex but it didn't look consensual to me.

Ehh part of what gets Jon a belly full of knives is that hes voicing things that have little to do with the Watch itself. Have you forgotten that Bowen Marsh is a scum?
762	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-04-21	Well, that was quite an episode. I'd say it's the worst out of three, though It definitely had its moments. Episode 1 and 2 had a lot going on.
Â 
The Good:
- Although weirdly placed considering how it happened, I enjoyed Sansa's escape from King's Landing. Mostly because I adore everything Sansa and Sophie is such an amazing actress. LF's dialogue was right on point, and Sansa's reaction made complete sense. The show has usually cringe-worthy lines, so I'll give them that.
- Daenerys scene at Meeren made, in my humble opinion, for the best scene of the episode. It seemed to work, when many of the previous scenes seemed to be rushed/awkward. Daario really stepped up his game (Though It would be great if it were Barristan) and the character is growing on me far more than Book!Daario. The trebuchets with broken chains were a nice touch, and it gave an amazing ending to the episode. Emilia's performance seems to work better in these kind of scenes, in general. And how great was it to see Hidzhar intrigued at the Silver Queen? Besides Missandei behaving "comedy-romantic" like, great scene.
- Tywin/Tommen was interesting, if brief. Same with Margaery/Olenna, and in retrospect, both were "lecturing" their grandchildren, so it makes a nice parallel. Who the hell is Orys I? Oberyn/Tywin, interesting as a scene, but more on that latter.
- Shireen. She's such an adorable girl, who wouldn't want to spend time with her? Although a scene lacking passion, it was more than likeable. Davos was great on it as well.
- Although not that great, Arya and Hound. Unnecessary, though I enjoyed the nods to the Seven, Hoster Tully and The Freys/Red Wedding. Not entirely sure what was Sandor's point in this episode.
- Jon small scene. Not that bad. Surprised that Kit didn't suck as much as he's used to..
The Bad:
- Oberyn's purpose as the nudity quota of the show, entirely. I've also wondered, have Pedro Pascal and Indira Varma agreed not to appear naked? I've noticed they're always fully clothed on their scenes on the brothel, which makes them even more weirder. Also, what was the point of the whores in the background despite the man-whore? I'll take anyone's bet about Oberyn sleeping with Loras until the end of the season. Oberyn/Tywin's scene was great, but it seemed odd to go with this first part.
- Sam the Boring. I just don't like this show!development. Everytime his scenes are on I wish I could skip them.
- St. Tyrion. I wonder how anyone even thinks he killed Joffrey, he's so good. Tyrion's deep connection with Pod, amongst others, are a reason for why I just can't wrap my head about him killing Shae this season. I hope he does.
- Jaime/Cersei. No remaining arguments.
- Oh, look. It's the Wildling butchery. They could be worse than the White Walkers,at this speed.
- Am I supposed to like Show!Stannis? Doesn't seem like it. Also, Aidan Gillen doesn't even seem to try with LF anymore.
Â 
General: 8/10. Good Episode. If I was a show!viewer only, I'd probably only enjoy Dany's scene. Lacked momentum.

Â 
I actually liked this scene a bit better, because Ellaria kept her clothes on just as Oberyn did, while the male prostitute got naked just as the female prostitutes did. Equal-opportunity nudity (or lack thereof, as with Ellaria and Oberyn).
Â 
I'm kind of disappointed that Oberyn never kissed Olyvar. Step up, man!
Â 
- Tywin/Tommen was interesting, if brief. Same with Margaery/Olenna, and in retrospect, both wwere "lecturing" their grandchildren, so it makes a nice parallel.
Â 
They were both grooming their grandchildren to marry each other. Olenna telling Margaery "The next one will be easier" and Tywin giving Tommen the Talk.

...although I do think the writers will "course-correct" around the end of the season with Tyrion's character. There were complaints about Arya and Tywin being whitewashed in Season 2, and the writers have course-corrected since. I'm not too, too concerned at this point, although I'll be the first to raise hell if Tyrion doesn't kill Tywin and Shae as he did in the books.

I do agree with you. It just seemed weird that both would be fully clothed whilst their partners were completely naked. I completely agree that Equal-opportunity is better than the usual "woman naked" take. If Ellaria was to be with no clothes, so should Oberyn.
Â 
I've actually noticed that as well! And that's the second time it happens. Makes me wonder...
Â 
On that regard, maybe a second Royal marriage this year?

But based on Sibel Kekilli's interview that sounds like Shae is going to be portrayed as a revenge-seeking psycho, I'd say it's more a question of the show wanting us to root for him there.

Â 
Calling it "course-correct" is probably a nice way of putting it. Â The show is just primarily interested in shock value, rather than in love with it's nuanced characters. Â 
Â 
It's why it's necessary to open yet another Oberyn dialog today with an edgy sex scene. Â It's why Jamie appears to be working towards deceny one episode and is raping someone the next. Â It's why the Wildlings are suddenly murderous Star Trek villains. Â It's why the Red Wedding was made to be more unexpected and more heartbreaking. Â 
Â 
When they have Tyrion murder Shae, it won't be some attempt to "fix" his character the way it should be. Â The show could not give two shits about correcting Tyrion's character. Â It's all just about setting up the next shocking blindside that will get people talking about the show. Â Even better if Tyrion appears like a great human being before being thrown into a murderous rage. Â More shocking that way!

Â 
Not really. The wildlings *are* butchers and rapists. Â There is reason when Mance walked up to the wall with his 100,000 army the Night's Watch didn't just open the doors and let them through. Â There is a reason why Bowen Marsh questioned Jon's choices. Â Even though ultimately allying with them was a rational move by Jon, the reservations of Marsh is legitimate and did not exist in a vacuum. Â Â
794	The King In Yellow	2014-04-21	Oh also we pretty much got confirmation it was the QoT who did the actual poisoning, yeah? Even though the framing made no sense for it


Â 
I agree, Marg seems not to have a part in it, however, it almost sounded like Tywin planned it.
Â 
What also struck me was that that there was no missing stone in the necklace (or am I mistaken?). Thrashing it and dropping it next to Dontos did not make sense to me in respect to the book where Sansa keeps it against instructions.

hmmmmm. so much for her poisoning him with the remaining stones. or i suppose that could still happen in the book and the show will do it differently but it looks like that will not be the way littlefinger meets his ends.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
I'm a little confused by this actually. In the book LF lets Sansa hold on to the hair net? Is there any mention of the hair net after she is whisked away from KL? I don't seem to remember.
797	rohit39	2014-04-21	So does this episode showing Margaery actively mourning Joffrey's death and that she still isn't the queen prove that she wasn't in on the poisoning with QoT as some suggested might have been the case in the books?
798	Rouge	2014-04-21	Oberyn and Ellaria are bisexual? Did anyone know that?


To be frank, at this point they seem to be full-blown gay, the both of them (except for each other).
799	The King In Yellow	2014-04-21	Tywin, on the other hand, who doesn't care too much about his son, is ok with whatever outcome the trial has  Either his enemy Oberyn is killed on his own accord, or he comes out happy because he got his revenge.


Â 
Isnt Tywin supposed to allow Tyrion to take the black?
I get confused when the show gets to conclusions ahead of time...
Â 
1. Tyrion, did you do it?
2. Tyrion, will you confess and take the black?
3. I will let the gods decide and get a champion (behold Mountain is Cercei's champion - note, not Tywins - then Oberyn is all over this.
Â 
Also, I wanted Tywin to take a glass of wine from Oberyn. The one that gives him a two week constipation (yes, I strongly believe this theory).Â
800	gvewolf243	2014-04-21	Scene with Cersei and Jaime was awful, well now Â he is rapist for Unsullied, plus a kinslayer. Good job, lol.Â

803	Rouge	2014-04-21	I just can't believe that they thought that a completely unnecessary, gratuitous rape scene would add anything worth its while. I just watched the behind the scene video and one of D&D was saying how this scene was deeply uncomfortable to shoot. Well, no shit. Rape is such an ugly thing, always, and I won't be sad if it hurts the ratings.
804	aussiegirl	2014-04-21	Liked this episode overall. Second fave for this season after the first one.
Â 
Fave parts:
Â 
Maisie. No other actress on this show matches her.
Arya's quick thinking and bringing the other side of her family into play.
Arya's smiles at the little girl.
Arya and the Hound trying to get through the prayer whilst starving.
Arya trying to concentrate on eating whilst her host is discussing the Red Wedding and the Freys.
Arya yelling at the Hound. He deserved it.
Tommen. All of Tommen. I like this actor.
Tommen and Jaime moment.
Tyrion and Pod
Jon Snow
Sam and Gilly before they left for Moletown.
Dontos. I'll miss you. Better than most of the characters still alive.
Jack Gleeson - props to you for lying there through both scenes.
No one is to leave the capital - are you sure Tywin?
Â 
Good Scenes
Â 
Actually made sense for Tyrion not to think Sansa is involved unlike the books - if Sansa had that sort of gumption she would have killed the King when she was actually in danger of marrying him. He is right too. Her leaving does not help him at all.
Â 
Liked the Tywin/Oberyn scene but another orgy - really this is just OTT.
Â 
Olenna making sense as always. Shut up Margary. You could have actually had to have sex with that psycho douchebag.
Â 
WTF:
Â 
Jaime/cersei - I don't even want to go into it.
The Hound - my God. If you are going to be an ass, at least be a funny one. I hope Arya Pollivers him.

LF is a Faceless Man. He talks in his normal voice when using his real face, just like batman talks in a normal voice when he's not batman.Â

811	Sub_Zero94	2014-04-21	in between Season 3 Stannis and now , I seriously do NOT understand the choices they're making as far as his story arch. Â it would have been pretty simple to do it right with a MUCH better pay-off in the end ,, but ... the arch they're choosing is lazy and makes very little sense... Â  only redeeming part of his arch is Shireen. Â She is GREAT
812	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	So was anyone else getting the vibe that Tywin sanctioned the Joffrey hit besides me? Â Or is that silly?


Â 
They even had Tyrion think about it.
And seeing as there's an entire theory that he was in on it, I wouldn't find it entirely implausible.
Â 
But more likely he wasn't part of the assassination, but saw the benefits of dead Joffrey and approved.
Â 


Can't figure the Orys I thing.Â  If they meant to say "Aerys I", maybe there are rumors that he was offed by Maekar? (Rumors he was offed by Bloodraven might work too, but Bloodraven was his uncle...)
Â 
Maybe Orys is the missing Targ king ruling between Jaehaerys I and Viserys I? It's the only place he'd fit in, unless he ruled for only a couple days and was killed by one of the kings already on the list and so no one counts him or something.
Â 
(Can't imagine Orys Baratheon actually ruled, and can't imagine Aegon I killing him either.)


Â 
I think Orys was a pre-Targ king. Made up for the show.
He did sayÂ Orys the First.
Â 
Also, they've changed the Targ tree before.Â Jaehaerys II has been removed, with Aerys II being the son of Aegon V.
813	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	It's just a broken necklace, who in the world other than Olenna knows or would even suspect it as the murder weapon?Â 


Â 
True, it won't implicate him, but you'd think a man as smart as Littlefinger would dispose the necklace better than leaving it somewhere it could be found.
814	Conchobar	2014-04-21	I hope we get a scene of Oberyn and Ellaria doing it doggy style while he monologues about his memories of his sister Elia.


While Olyvar is going at him from behind. Yeah, somehow I won't be surprised if we see that.
Â 
Does Oberyn ever eat? Or do other things?

816	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	Â 
I did find it odd that S4 Tywin suddenly believes in the rumours of Dany and her three dragons when he was so damned certain before that it was all malarkey....
Â 


Â 
I found it odd as well, but I think he's simply flattering Dorne and using Dany as an excuse to get him on his side.
Were he seriously concerned about her, I think he'd take precautions.
Â 
Â 


Book Pod's never really in any danger. Seems to totally miss Cersei and Tywin's radar.


Â 
I think they put Pod in danger so that he has a better reason to leave KL and go with Brienne.
Â 
BTW who would've wanted Pod to testify against Tyrion?
Olenna, Littlefinger, Cersei or Tywin?Â
817	Ran	2014-04-21	I'm guessing Cersei.And yeah, safe to say it's going to be how they get Podrick together with Brienne, rather than having him follow her on his own.
818	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	I was sort of surprised when Tywin said Dany had 3 dragons, but it was probably a way of saying "we're in deep shit and we need you"Â
819	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	Bran is almost out ofÂ material until WoW shit. Seriously. They need to pad him out a little bit and throwing in an extra plot line wouldnt hurt too much.
Â 
Id be ok with that.
Â 


Â 
I think they are going to add some filler to his arc, involving Craster's wives.
Â 
Â 


Â 
I'm kind of disappointed that Oberyn never kissed Olyvar. Step up, man!
Â 


Â 
Weren't the two of them smooching before Ellaria kisses Olyvar and says he never acquired the taste of women?
Â 
Â 


So does this episode showing Margaery actively mourning Joffrey's death and that she still isn't the queen prove that she wasn't in on the poisoning with QoT as some suggested might have been the case in the books?


Â 
She wasn't exactly mourning him. Just noting that her husbands keep dying, and expressing regret for not being queen yet.
I'm pretty sure she was in on the poisoning.
In the previous episode, there's a moment when before Joffrey has the last drink from the goblet, he hands it to Marge.

Â 
The best part of this episode was the Tommen/Tywin scene Â , too bad we didn't get to see Tywin give Tommen the sex talk. I'm sure everyone would love to hear what explanation he was going to give a young boy. We also got to see a cock! (I'm sure the ladies are loving this). It might have been pissing cock but atleast it's still a cock, and it's a wet one in a way.

828	SemperVII	2014-04-21	I'm gonna go on a limb here:
Â 
The kid who got his father and mother killed during the Wildling raid and escaped to Castle Black is the one who's gonna snipe Ygritte with a bow or a crossbow. The way they show him looking at her while he's under the cart was way too ominous. It also would make sense the Night's Watch would arm him if he can hold a weapon.
Â 
Of course that's pure speculation, but I wouldn't be against it since it would be a sort of revenge for a poor orphan kid.
It would be better than her dying from an unknown archer.

Tormund and Ygritte take part in an on-screen slaughter(I guess that explains the back and forth with the canni-Thenns in ep 1), Jaime gets his rape on, Sandor goes full thug. They even had sweet Daario pull an Indiana Jones with his knife.

I don't think it's really that Jorah was snitching. I'm sure by now there are lots of rumors of there being Dragons with Dany. Plus as far as we know, Jorah was writing to KL Â well into the second book. So he may have said something about her birthing dragons.
843	jons nissa	2014-04-21	Perhaps it's because Davos might abandon him in the next book?

Â 
  Â how could you think such a thing? surely davos will go down with the ship, never betraying his king and benefactor, right? i mean, what would have to happen for him to abandon stannis now?!!!!
Â Â 
Â 
Â 

The show is making us love Shireen, because they know she's going to die.

Â 
but they could have just continued with the adorable shireen if all they wanted was audience sympathy. instead they're making her such a boss in her scenes with davos. plus she's his teacher. that really implies strength and intelligence and that is just not shown in the books. i mean in the books she's constantly with patchface! 'nuff said. she's being shown as having all the good qualities of stannis and none of the bad ones which makes me really rethink her possible endgame.
Â 
Â 
Â 

I'm a little confused by this actually. In the book LF lets Sansa hold on to the hair net? Is there any mention of the hair net after she is whisked away from KL? I don't seem to remember.

Â 
in the books, sansa still has her hairnet. it's never taken from her when she meets up with littlefinger on the boat.
844	Maia	2014-04-21	Well I didn't watch the trailer closely enough then. Tywin's convo sounds like he's fixing the trial to go to combat, which could have happened in the book, tho it was presented as Oberyns idea.Â No, in the books Tywin was extremely angry when it went that way, so angry that he was barely able to control himself. Like Tyrion, Tywin clearly saw that no matter how the trial by combat went, the outcome would hurt the Lannister regime. He also tried to keep the Mountain away from KL, it was Cersei who summoned him to be her champion behind Daddy's back.But then, book Tywin is generally far more cunning and capable than the show one and it is genuinely believable that he would have been able to put the realm back together. Here they seem to be gearing towards him, rather than Cersei, alienating the Iron Bank. Oh, and also he seems to believe that Dorne would support the Lannisters over a Targaryen with 3 dragons and an army?!!Dance is a great actor, but the writing for Tywin dumbed his character down a lot, IMHO.Oh, and WTF with Jaime as a rapist?!!in the books, sansa still has her hairnet. it's never taken from her when she meets up with littlefinger on the boat.Didn't Sansa hide the net in the godswood, where she met with Dontos prior to their escape? She noticed that one stone was missing, too. Too bad they didn't show her realization of that in the show.

845	johndance	2014-04-21	I was fine with the Cersei-Jaime 'rape' scene. I was fine w it because it's in a completely different context in the show. In the book, during this scene, this is the first time Jaime and Cersei see each other since he gets back. So much different than the show. 
In show we know Jaime has been back for 'weeks'. They already have had their hellos and problems and we know Cersei is being a bitch to Jaime. She's not giving it up and telling him he took to long and everything else. It's such a different circumstance. 
IF the book events were actually more similar to how the show has handled the whole Jaime-Cersei story, I can see Martin writing it the same way. Jaime letting his emotion get the best of him and forcing himself on Cersei, Cersei saying no but eventually giving in, which is how I saw it.
846	Phil Sand	2014-04-21	Either Tywin goes back on his word (which would be kind of ridiculous considering that he just made the offer like two days earlier), or they're going to have Oberyn become champion because he's convinced by Saint Tyrion's goodness and innocence.


neither, tywin will give oberyn his meeting but it will be in the view of the people so he will not attack, and then pick his chance to become champion because he wants to kill gregor, not because he's convinced by "the imp"

Re: book Bronn vs show Bronn re:Book vs show Shae
If Shae returns it means Bronn was outsmarted by a Lannister flunky (not likely especially since Cersei was in charge of that task) or she passed it on to a Tyrell in which case they might have got her. Or Bronn sold out Tyrion which I would find very annoying - I can see them buying him off but not without him giving Tyrion a shot to outbid. They could have threatened him but only Cersei is insane enough to think Tyrion is guilty wo a trial and Bronn doesn't threaten easily. OTOH if they reverse gears on Show Shae why not Show Bronn. Then they could do whatever they want.

Â 
Either way I don't like Tywin being up to speed on Essos, or at least I don't like it being made plain to the viewer. It's going to make him look like he would have been great for the realm, and that Varys is failing badly. It sounds silly for a man like Tywin to speak about Danaerys as a bigger threat than Balon and Stannis, even if he believes it. Plus it makes Slynt's tattle taling so subtle that nobody would pick up on it.
851	MizasterJ	2014-04-21	My thoughts on last night's episode of Game of Thrones season 4 ep 3:
--VERY MINOR SPOILERS--
Good opening scene w/ Sansa. Just how I pictured it. Interesting how neither Sansa nor Littlefinger mentioned Tyrion. Even though they didn't say Amethyst I'm still happy they used the term "the strangler" They actually handled the aftermath of Joff's death really well maybe even better than the book. Marg. was def in on it. It's noteworthy that her grandmother never mentioned Littlefinger or the ramifications the murder had on Tyrion.
Varys: oddly absent. Bronn: I can't help but wonder if he is part of an upcoming plot w/ Shae. In the book Cersei didn't resist Jaime nearly as much; I guess they are trying to appeal to the female audience, but Cersei is supposed to be a horrible person, and Jaime is still a sleaze at best, weak to his own indulgences.
So now HBO has officially ruined Oberyn, despite that his scene w/ Tywin was an added bonus. I love that they addressed how much he knows about poison and that he could have been but most likely was not the culprit. Side note: Charles Dance is a superb actor.
More Stannis? why? nothing's happening. No Mel this time? So we learn that the reason he hasn't gone to the wall yet is due to him not having enough ships. Interesting that they mentioned Braavos and the golden Company...where is this going?
Wildlings ! "the Thenns" are legit badass.
Dany: this new Daario fails to impress me. Would have been the perfect opportunity to introduce Strong Belwas!
Arya: The hound's burn marks or lack there of in this season is really bothering me.Â 
I wish her story would move forward. I'm betting the hound will be ambushed.
fairly good episode, but not dragon level good. I give it a 6/10

856	Juan_Snow	2014-04-21	Wtf! Why has HBO changed the Jamie/Cersei scene to a rape scene?Â 

It actually wasn't much of a change.  In the book Cersei is pounding on his chest telling him to stop.  People just love to over react.  The scene was actually very much like the book.  They just cut away rather than continue the scene.
857	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-21	I thought the whole jaime and cersei seen was on point, no?  In the books I thought she stated similar things, like, "not here", "this isnt right". I didnt see anything wrong with it I should say.

It seemed like jaime was forceful and cersie was for and against all the same.  Little overreaction I think.
859	Aerys Vengeance	2014-04-21	Jaime said that he only feels alive when he fights or when he has sex with Cersei. She refused his attempts in the first episode, so he thought that he must force her, just like kings and lords had to use violence and wars to assert their claims. I'm OK with this. There never has been such a thing like "Jaime turns from bad to good guy", just because he got some traumatic events in Season 3 (respectively his events of ASoS). Even if the consensuality might have existed in the books, this deviation does not change anything regarding Jaime's character development.Â 
Â 
So, this is my first post in this forum and I want to apologize in advance for any grammar error. I'm from Germany and thus there can appear some mistakes.

864	dbunting	2014-04-21	I didn't like the Sam and Gilly to moletown, doesn't make sense and took up too much time that could have been used on someone else.When I read the books I didn't read the Jaime/Cersei scene as rape, this was like a rape. Just felt wrong from where Jaime's character is right now.Liked Edd and Grenn showing back up, would rather have seen and heard more from them and less Sam/Gilly.Liked the barrels of broken chains, very symbolic. Hopefully this season will show more of Dany's failings in Mereen, how her just setting people free has had some really bad consequences.Pretty much love every scene with the Hound and Arya, doesn't seem to matter what they are doing.
865	dbunting	2014-04-21	As far as Coldhands is concerned, GRRM stated that he is much much older, when asked about who he is, relating to Benjen. So, the author himself has said Benjen is not Coldhands.Strong Belwas, eh, no big loss. He was a colorful character but he really only existed to get Barriston to Dany, and since the tv show couldn't hide who he was like the book could, there was no reason for the extra charater. I think I prefer Daario killing the champion anyway, lends more to Dany liking him.
866	Bear Claw	2014-04-21	Gilly in Moles town- ThisÂ seems to point to no Mance's baby. It seems they are trying to set up a reason to send Gilly south. I wonder if this means no Val either?
867	lostinasia	2014-04-21	I think I prefer Daario killing the champion anyway, lends more to Dany liking him.


I agree with this - while I recognize that Show-Daario is quite different from the book, and I miss some of the flamboyant silliness, what I do like about him is that I can see Show-Dany liking S3-Show-Daario. I had real trouble imagining Show-Dany liking S2-Show-Daario.

I'm assuming no Val. Seems a bit late in the game for her to be introduced, and I'm not sure she really serves much function anyway, especially if Baby Mance is cut.Â
869	raj34	2014-04-21	Pretty boring episode. Â Not gonna complain too much since the first two were great. Â I feel like Petyr tries too hard to sound different for some reason. Â I swear he didn't sound like that season 1 and 2. Â Glad to see the Hound toe the line of paragon and renegade. Â The Tywin/Oberyn exchange was pretty good. Â Tywin guiding young Tommen away from Cersei is a nice indicator of future events where he tries to separate the next in line from being manipulated from a psycho woman.


Â 
I agree about Aidan's accent. His accent was perfectly fine in season 1, but now it's too overwrought.Â 
Â 
I'm not usually one to nitpick either, it's just a little distracting.
870	raj34	2014-04-21	I think the "Jaime rapes Cersei" thing totally messed up the end of A Feast For Crows with the "I love you, I love you, I love you" letter from Cersei to Jaime, doesn't it? If she still writes him that letter after being raped, that is F*KKED UP.


Â 
Did you forget the circumstances she was in when she wrote that? She would have declared her true love thrice to Tyrion if he she believed he could bust her out of that jail cell.
871	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	I don't think Oberyn is "ruined" but HBO is, like always, exploiting a single aspect of his life when he definitely has more that is way more interesting.
Â 
He's the Viper for Doran's grass. They haven't even explained WHY is he called like this, except that it's mentioned about poisons.
He loves Elaria and Elaria is not some fun girl he's sexing with.
They have four children, and he's a great parent to his daughters.
Â 
Of course, HBO want to overuse the fact that he is supposed to be bisexual, only based on rumours and sayings about him, probably the noble man people speak rumours the most. Because Oberyn's bisexuality is more like only chatter to put him in a bad light.
Â 
And of course, Pedro Pascal is great, like Dillane and many others actors in the show, it's not his fault.
872	Arataniello	2014-04-21	Gilly in Moles town- ThisÂ seems to point to no Mance's baby. It seems they are trying to set up a reason to send Gilly south. I wonder if this means no Val either?


Â 
I guess Gilly in Mole Town will allow for some Dramatic Tension later on, when the wildling are approaching Castle Black from the South.Â  Possibly Sam rides south to defend her/rescue her, and fat pink mastage ensues at that point?
873	raj34	2014-04-21	It was pretty good. Less so than the two previous ones but those were by and large excellent so that's to be expected. Still, it didn,t seem like the writers are losing steam.
Â 
-Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way; I wasn't a fan of the Cercei-Jaime scene, but this wasn't a book deviation. The consensuality of the sex in the novels is not clear cut, at all. Cercei repeatedly says no and voices objections, only for Jaime to ignore her, and then she says it was folly. The show did all that, without the last part. This is NOT DnD changing things around people, sorry. Jaime is not a perfect angel post-maiming and he still semi-raped his sister.
Â 


Â 
Yeah, I was a little confused about all the outrage around here over that scene.
Â 
It's been a while since I read the book, but I don't remember Cersei welcoming Jaime with legs spread wide...
874	Arataniello	2014-04-21	Â 
I'm assuming no Val. Seems a bit late in the game for her to be introduced, and I'm not sure she really serves much function anyway, especially if Baby Mance is cut.Â 


Â 
Depending on how the battle at the Wall is handled, there is still time to introduce Dalla and Val, if Jon goes to Mance's tent right before the wildlings are attacked.Â  I need to reread this bit of the series, my memory is hazy on the timing of these events.

Â 
I reread it last night myself after the episode.Â  Cersei seems to be as eager/desperate as Jaime in the books, but is quick to point out to him afterwards how foolish it was.
876	raj34	2014-04-21	I don't think Oberyn is "ruined" but HBO is, like always, exploiting a single aspect of his life when he definitely has more that is way more interesting.
Â 
He's the Viper for Doran's grass. They haven't even explained WHY is he called like this, except that it's mentioned about poisons.
He loves Elaria and Elaria is not some fun girl he's sexing with.
They have four children, and he's a great parent to his daughters.
Â 


Â 
Yeah, info-dumping the Red Viper's biography would make for some really compelling television.
Â 
The sand snakettes will probably be cut anyway, so why bother break out the Dornish family album?
877	Cersei the Great	2014-04-21	For me ...
Â 
Loved
1. Â Arya calling out the Hound
2. Â Tyrion / Pod interaction
3. Â Grandpa Tywin going to tell Tommen about the 'birds and the bees'
4. Â Reappearance of LF
5. Â Tommen in general. Â Great choice in my opinion.
6. Â Shereen and Davos interactions are always great
Â 
Hated
1. Â Cersei / Jamie rape scene
2. Â Gilly to Mole Town
3. Â ThennsÂ 
4. Â Daario Naharis. Â It is taking a long time to get used to the new actor. Â I really liked the other one.
Â 
Meh
1. Â Dany's scenes. Â Just like others have said I was wondering how they were able to hear her as well.
2. Â Wished Sansa's escape had included the cliff.

Maybe its me being influenced by the books, I guess I have to rewatch the scene to be sure, but I thought Cerseis protests were faux.Â
884	Greywolf2375	2014-04-21	Finally got to see the whole episode:
Â 
Sansa's escape: Â Wow - the drunk can really row for a long time. Â Got to think that LF's voice change each season is to...maybe...show how he can change at a whim.
Â 
Marg/QoT - Her speeches are over the top, but she delivers them so well...love the QoT. Â 
Â 
Sept - Wow, Tywin almost seems like a grandfather here. Â Some of the best delivery...new Tommen so far looks like he will do well. Â  I do like how Tywin lets Tommen work his way through to get to wisdom. Â  And a nice old "eff you" to Joffrey. Â Â 
Â 
Jaime/Cersei - in the books it was forceful, but consensual. Â This...this wasn't. Â I know it's been commented on before, but just wondering why they would change the relationship like that. him repeating "I don't care" just reinforces it Â Â At least they skipped over the moonsblood....
Â 
Hound/Arya - they do have great interplay, and while I am glad they brought back the fact that this isn't Riggs & Murtaugh with the Hound being an ass, I don't like that they just had him go back on his "a man has to have a code" from just a little bit before. Â I think it probably shocked a lot of people to see that this isn't the Hound Redemption Roadshow but that he is still out for himself.
Â 
Wall - Gilly & Sam are great together, still wish they did have someone see that Sam did kill the WW.
Â 
Davos/Stannis - their interplay is great, but Shireen and Davos are right behind Hound/Arya. Â "Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior".
885	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-21	You left out the section where she says 'No, not here'


Â 
True but she clearly got into it which the shows fails to show.
Â 
That scenes was so disturbing because Cersei was carried away moaning while fucking her brother in front of their sons corps. There was literally no shame.
Â 
In the show Cersei is clearly the overpowered one and Jaime the manipulative/controlling one. Yes, he initiated the sex but she was digging it after awhile and egging him on. However, she keeps her 'mother with halo' act for the show while Jaime is dirtied up and proven hypocritical towardsÂ one ofÂ his redeeming actions- saving Brienne from being raped.
Â 
My main problem is the lack of making Cersei look bad, just Jaime- killed his cousin but Joffrey had Roberts bastards killed, not Cersei. And now this.

Yeah I see what you're saying.
887	The Lady Leela	2014-04-21	Â 
Â 
The kid who got his father and mother killed during the Wildling raid and escaped to Castle Black is the one who's gonna snipe Ygritte with a bow or a crossbow. The way they show him looking at her while he's under the cart was way too ominous. It also would make sense the Night's Watch would arm him if he can hold a weapon.
Â 


Â 
That's the impression I got, as well. Plus, that kid was a REALLY good actor. You don't waste good child actors like that. He's gonna get his revenge and kill Ygritte.Â 
Â 
Mixed feelings about this episode. It tipped the scales to good, but it wasn't great. What can I say about that Jaime scene that hasn't been said already? I mean, sigh. What did it accomplish? What was the point of it? The violence against women is getting pretty ridiculous on the show. Knowing what's coming up for Sansa and Shae isn't helping. Goddammit, what was dumb. DUMB.
Â 
I kinda teared up when Tyrion said goodbye to Pod, even though Tyrion is becoming worse than Daryl Dixon when it comes to being overbearingly canonized. Pod is one of the best things the show has ever done, hands down.Â 
Â 
Even though I like the Hound and Arya, that scene where they just tear into the stew was a huge turn off for me. I know it was played for laughs, but I have a huge bad table manners phobia Â .Â 
Â 
Littlefinger's acting is just cringeworthy. Oh, God, he's even worse than I remember. Varys is a good example of an actor who can play mysterious and creepy without sounding like someone who is trying to audition for a bad Batman parody. However, Sophie Turner is doing a great job with the material. She's really grown as an actress these past few years. I'm really looking forward to her storyline.Â 
Â 
Without Mance Ryder's baby, I really don't care at all about Gilly's. I don't get the point of taking her to Mole's Town. Like, at all. Sucks, cause I love Hannah Murray. Also, Sam should be losing weight by now, no? Somehow he seems bigger to me. I do hope, however, that Gilly somehow reminds the audience that Wildlings aren't evil people. Without Osha around, I fear the Unsullied might miss that point, seeing as the show is doing naught to drive it home.Â 
Â 
I continue to be impressed with Kit Harrington's acting this season. I've gone from being indifferent/irritated with Jon, to quickly adding him to my list of favorite characters. I know it's gonna get better, and I can't wait! THIS is a Jon Snow I can get behind. He's getting pretty badass.Â 
Â 
From Olenna and Margaery's scene, I got the sense that Margaery wasn't a part of the murder. Olenna is sitting there all, "wink, wink. wink wink. WINK WINK!" and Margaery didn't seem to get it at all. I'm okay with that, to be honest. Margaery has a lot to learn, still. I agree with whoever said that she came off very young in that scene. You could see it in Olenna's smile, that she loves her granddaughter but still has a lot to teach her. Great acting by Dianna Riggs, as usual. Don't know how this changes Margaery's storyline in the books, though I suppose it doesn't matter much now whether she was in on the murder or not.Â 
Â 
I kinda rolled my eyes at Dany throwing that slavers' chains over the walls of Mereen. However, Emily Clarke seemed to imply in an interview that Dany's glory will turn to shit, so I'm still reserving judgement. Huge foreshadow there with her telling Jorah that he's her best adviser and friend. Also, whoever said Emilia is at her best when shouting in other languages is totally right. She was really great during that speech scene, even her mannerisms were pretty nice.
Â 
Whatever, Daario.
Â 
Where were the dragons?
Â 
Charles Dance continues to be an inspiration to all and he should end up on the Iron Throne. Not Tywin. Just Charles Dance.Â 
Â 
Stannis: I will not become a page in someone else's history book.
Me: HE SAID IT! HE SAID IT!
888	Obebb	2014-04-21	I don't think Oberyn is "ruined" but HBO is, like always, exploiting a single aspect of his life when he definitely has more that is way more interesting.
Â 
He's the Viper for Doran's grass. They haven't even explained WHY is he called like this, except that it's mentioned about poisons.
He loves Elaria and Elaria is not some fun girl he's sexing with.
They have four children, and he's a great parent to his daughters.
Â 
Of course, HBO want to overuse the fact that he is supposed to be bisexual, only based on rumours and sayings about him, probably the noble man people speak rumours the most. Because Oberyn's bisexuality is more like only chatter to put him in a bad light.
Â 
And of course, Pedro Pascal is great, like Dillane and many others actors in the show, it's not his fault.


Â 
I agree with this very much. I still love Oberyn in the show so far, but in a way I feel some sort of embarrassment because I told my unsullied family that Oberyn and house Martell are like my favourites before the season started. Little did I know the Dornish would seem like nothing more than sex-crazed freaks on the show (at least so far). To my unsullied family I can only say "Nooo, there is more to him than thisÂ   " to defend myselfÂ
889	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	My main problem is the lack of making Cersei look bad, just Jaime- killed his cousin but Joffrey had Roberts bastards killed, not Cersei. And now this.

Â 
My problem with this is that they're turning Cersei into a victim. Poor mother who lost her poor boy and was raped by evil brother. In books, many people look to the other side when Cersei's crimes are discussed because "she's a victim of society, she was raped by Robert". Now, it's the same. I personally don't see Jaime being as "holly" and redeemed yet, as people want him to see, even after Brienne he fucked his sister inside a Sept, so, he's still broken and careless. It's after he sends Brienne that he really started to change for good and Cersei, for bad. And now, everything bad Cersei does will be tried to excuse with "well, she's right about mistreating Jaime because HE RAPED HER".
890	Greywolf2375	2014-04-21	Granted, we can't get the details from the inner thoughts as we do in the books, but it would be much nicer to get shown the different possibilities of who could be guilty rather than told. Â The Tywin thought process Tyrion has just seems hamhanded in delivery.
Â 
Course, it is made up for completely with his interaction with Pod. Â great scenes there.
Â 
Wildlings - it's fine they have the Thenns as cannibals, but again it seems over the top in the dialogue with the little kid.
Â 
Wall - loved seeing Slynt not have the vaguest clue as to how to react to the chest thumping. Â  Building a nice set up for Stannis & Harrington's delivery is much better. How did Grenn get away? Â can't hear any description of how they escapedÂ 
Â 
Dany - miss Belwas, but that was handled as well as can be. Â I think the actor playing Daario is doing well, but he just doesn't come across to me as Daario. Â  the manacles across the walls are a nice touch.
891	Arataniello	2014-04-21	Course, it is made up for completely with his interaction with Pod. Â great scenes there.

Â 
Dislikes:Â 
The Jamie-Cersei scene. Â It was supposed to one of grief and desperation after both of their worlds have been ripped apart. It was gross and horrible and painful and sad. Â This felt weird to me especially since we had the scenes earlier where it was very clear she had been rebuffing him. I believe the writers when they say they didn't think it was rape but still it seemed a weird way to present it. I viewed it as Jamie trying to comfort Cersei in an albeit inappropriate way, and her resisting mildly before consenting. I just don't think it was well shot at the very least.
Littlefinger: he's always been a slimy character but the way he's acting now is just over the top. So either this is his natural behavior which I really don't want to see. My original hypothesis was that he was struggling to keep his accent under control while whispering but that seems much more fanwanky than true. Â Again, the dynamic between little finger and Sansa has been protector/mentor, not creepy uncle squirreling you away in the night. Â He is teaching her about navigating the realm when you are not strong or brave. Â That's the lesson of killing Dontos. It just felt weird, but again, I blame it on weird choices of both actor and director.
Â 
Â 
Thoughts:Â 
Still like this Daario way better than old Daario and stand Â by my projected character merge
The Hound breaking his "code" don't think he did. He didn't steal from the brotherhood because they weren't "dead men". like he viewed this man and his daughter. Also, I feel like it's a reminder, as someone said earlier, the world is hard even without Joffrey and just cause he's dead doesn't mean people are better. Â
895	boojam	2014-04-21	I don't know who played Osha's twin in Mole's town but I kept looking for Rickon . IMDB says there was a Thenn warg - wth?At first glance I thought "How did Natalia Tena get here?!"But I think the Mole's Town Madam is Lu Corfield with make up that made her look like Osha.

Â 
Yup. This is a completely different Daario to me. Different from the books and from last season's Daario. They should've just created a new character.Â 
Â 
But as you pointed out and I forgot to add, Mereen was gorgeous! Stunning visuals. Plus, the people looked healthy and happy. Now here comes Dany to fuck it all up.Â
897	Stannis I	2014-04-21	Although Oberyn is pictured as just a dangerous sex machine i think he will be fine after a couple of episodes, unlike Stannis (god). But the Magnars...cannibalism... that is pretty messed up.


Â 
Not quite. If I'm not mistaken, in ADWD Ser Davos is going to 'a place where they eat men's flesh' so he can find Rickon Stark and bring him back to Wyman Manderly. That place, I think, is Skagos.

I'm fairly certain there is a strong link between the IB and the FM. At the very least, the IB is a "regular customer" of the FM. At the most, both are actually one big Bravosi organisation with a hidden agenda for Westerosi politics.

True, it won't implicate him, but you'd think a man as smart as Littlefinger would dispose the necklace better than leaving it somewhere it could be found.

Why... when they find Dontos floating around and someone comes along and connects the necklace to Sansa LF will only have more to hold over her.. her connection to the poisoning is the prime tool Littlefinger has to control Sansa.. why not make that connection even stronger..

913	rohit39	2014-04-21	Â 
Â 
She wasn't exactly mourning him. Just noting that her husbands keep dying, and expressing regret for not being queen yet.
I'm pretty sure she was in on the poisoning.
In the previous episode, there's a moment when before Joffrey has the last drink from the goblet, he hands it to Marge.


Â 
In that case, if Margaery is in on it, and we know that QoT is involved (from the books atleast), a conversation involving Margaery and QoT in private is not going to include Margaery lament the fact that she might not be queen etc. Unless in the show they want to point the responsibility of the poisoning purely on Margaery, making QoT innocent.Â

I viewed it as Jamie trying to comfort Cersei in an albeit inappropriate way, and her resisting mildly before consenting. I just don't think it was well shot at the very least.
Littlefinger: he's always been a slimy character but the way he's acting now is just over the top. So either this is his natural behavior which I really don't want to see. My original hypothesis was that he was struggling to keep his accent under control while whispering but that seems much more fanwanky than true. Â Again, the dynamic between little finger and Sansa has been protector/mentor, not creepy uncle squirreling you away in the night. Â He is teaching her about navigating the realm when you are not strong or brave. Â That's the lesson of killing Dontos. It just felt weird, but again, I blame it on weird choices of both actor and director.
Â 
Â 
Thoughts:Â 
Still like this Daario way better than old Daario and stand Â by my projected character merge
The Hound breaking his "code" don't think he did. He didn't steal from the brotherhood because they weren't "dead men". like he viewed this man and his daughter. Also, I feel like it's a reminder, as someone said earlier, the world is hard even without Joffrey and just cause he's dead doesn't mean people are better. Â 


Â  Â  Â Â 
The writers may not have believed that the Jaime/Cersei sex was rape, but it certainly looked and sounded like rape to me, what with Cersei saying 'no', 'it's not right', and 'don't' and Jaime saying 'I don't care'. Â 
Â 
Loved the Shireen and Davos scene. Â Gets me hoping more than ever that the two characters survive the series and that Shireen at least gets to be Lady of Dragonstone (or Storm's End or even Queen).
Â 
Creepin' Littlefinger indeed, practically breathing down Sansa's neck.
917	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-21	I believe they did a good job in the Tywin-Oberyn scene to further explain Elia's murder and who's behind itÂ
918	rmholt	2014-04-21	Maybe its me being influenced by the books, I guess I have to rewatch the scene to be sure, but I thought Cerseis protests were faux.Â 
I think she was kind of into it until she saw the stump and then she mimed an EEK and changed her mind. Still, no means no. 
Since Jaime hasn't been seen to hit bottom yet maybe this is it though if D&D say it wasn't meant to be rape maybe not.
After the second watching this ep did have moments, mainly in dialogue. 
Continuing from last week Tywin's torso hovering in the air at the wedding was disorienting.
As for the Hound and food, anyone who's seen Survivor knows the big men can't live on rice or crushed acorns.

919	Elaena Targaryen	2014-04-21	Wow, that Tywin lecture to Tommen was just embarrassing. he was speaking to him as if Tommen is 7 year old or just retarded.


Â 
Really? A back and forth discussion teaching him to reason things outÂ is treating him like he's mentally handicapped? Most adults should speak to each other this way, you know as a productive discourse.Â (btw isn't the r-word considered quite offensive?)
Â 

Terrible infodumping too, this show is subtle as a sledgehammer way too often.

Â 
What important info was dumped that required being more subtle?
Â 

St. Tyrion strikes again. That scene with Pod...just give him the halo already. Sheesh...

Â 
Well I thought that scene made Pod look good, which he deserves.
Â 
To be frank, at this point they seem to be full-blown gay, the both of them (except for each other).


Â 
Now Ellaria did try to get some from Olyvar but was denied.
Â 
WhichÂ Oly better thank the seven that LF is out of town and not watching throughÂ some peephole, even Ros was not allowed to pick and choose and show preferences.... Oly even tried to deny Oberyn at first, who does this whore think he is? Some people *shakes head*Â LF would def sell him to some torturing murderer if he knew.
Â 
(Yes I know it seems thatÂ Olyvar is running things, and like Ros ended up being was not expected to whore themselves out, but the young man did place himself in the middle of an orgyÂ that I'm sure he was being well paid for andÂ I don't think LF would be pleased he snubbed Ellaria like that.)

Â 
Exactly, There was not flip, like in the book, that indicated the Cersei was definitely on-board. Â Obviously the writers did not attend the session about lack of a no not equaling Â consent.Â 
Â 
Also, I just feel the scene is going to change how everyone views their actions after this and I will burn everything to the ground if this somehow becomes what people frame as the trigger for Cersei's complete collapse into paranoid revenge mode. Â

bahahahah r-word. Did you just really say "r-word"?Â Dying of laughter here!
I thought Tywin was talking to Tommen as if he were any other person. Tywin talks down to everyone ever but hes actually not talking to Tommen as if he were a child. Hes speaking to Tommen as if he is just someone who needs to know whats up.Â
923	thegreenmanalishi83	2014-04-21	Well for better or for worse their doing a good job of making The Hound out to be a right cunt. It will definitely make it easier for Arya (and perhaps more importantly for D & D,the viewers) to leave him for dead at the end of the season.
Â 
I thought Daario was pretty flat and his method of dispatching the horse imo means my favourite scene that was never going to be filmed anyway-Bronn's joust with Ser Belman Byrch,Now definitely won't be filmed *sobs*.

Â Belwas would have made for a much better fight scene than Daario's was. I was really looking forward to Coldhands too. It seems like they cut all of the characters I would like to see.

The Hound scene seemed to be a bad attempt at recreating the conversation Sansa and Sandor have on the rooftops. The problem with the Hound is that they pretty much have ignored his character for 3 seasons and have given him no background or development and now seem to be trying to fit 3 books worth of Character development into one season and it isn't really working.
Â 
Stealing the money from the family was bizarre. In the book he cheated the ferry men who wanted to cheat him and stole the farmer's cart and horse. He also was chased out of the village by the villagers as opposed to cheating them. I think this is similar to how they changed Stannis's motivation for burning people from treason to religion. It is as if D&D are trying to do characterisation by adding their own invented scenes, but missing what makes the characters who they are in the book.Â

In that case, if Margaery is in on it, and we know that QoT is involved (from the books atleast), a conversation involving Margaery and QoT in private is not going to include Margaery lament the fact that she might not be queen etc. Unless in the show they want to point the responsibility of the poisoning purely on Margaery, making QoT innocent.Â

The QoT is definitely in on it, and Margaery is most probably part of it too.

Littlefinger's acting is just cringeworthy. Oh, God, he's even worse than I remember. Varys is a good example of an actor who can play mysterious and creepy without sounding like someone who is trying to audition for a bad Batman parody. However, Sophie Turner is doing a great job with the material. She's really grown as an actress these past few years. I'm really looking forward to her storyline.Â 


Â 
WTF was going on with Littlefinger's accent? It's funny that you mention Batman because I caught a bit of The Dark Knight Rises on HBO earlier in the day and, honestly, the speech patter is pretty similar.
Â 
I swear Aiden Gillen has had a different accent in every single season. But whatever he was doing on the boat (trying to whisper or whatever) was simply not working. My husband (who is Unsullied) said, "Yeah, the director should have just not accepted that take of the scene."
Â 
Any episode without Varys is a weaker episode, in my book.

935	the silver queen	2014-04-21	Why do some people believe that Val or Mance's baby won't be introduced? They don't enter the story until later, when Jon goes to treat with Mance... Gilly being in Mole's Town doesn't mean anything, she can always be brought back to CB. The show writers make alterations but so far they seem to get back on track usually with all the major plot points (I'm assuming Val isn't a minor plot point, I can't see GRRM having her exist for no reason, plus her and Mance add a lot to Jon's story, I can't imagine what the show writers would do with his story without them.. ).Â

942	CrypticWeirwood	2014-04-21	As far as Coldhands is concerned, GRRM stated that he is much much older, when asked about who he is, relating to Benjen. So, the author himself has said Benjen is not Coldhands.
Strong Belwas, eh, no big loss. He was a colorful character but he really only existed to get Barriston to Dany, and since the tv show couldn't hide who he was like the book could, there was no reason for the extra charater. I think I prefer Daario killing the champion anyway, lends more to Dany liking him.

944	BlueDragon	2014-04-21	I rewatched the episode this evening. Â The rape was less rapey the second time around, but if D&D didn't mean it to be a rape, why was it so uncomfortable to shoot? Â Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.
Â 
Frankly, the amount of sexual violence directed at women in the books especially is beyond appalling. Â Despite this, I am a fan of the show and have read and reread the books. Â But I am under no illusions: this story reinforces violence against women and generally denigrates women far, far more than men.
Â 
Cersei is ambivalent in that scene in the books, but D&D have set her up to reject Jaime in the series and she has already by berating him for taking so long to get back to her. Â 
Â 
I love NCW so it is really hard for me not to like this character even after what he has done. Â Bran was unforgivable. Â Just unforgivable.
Â 
Killing the King, well now we understand that. Â He should have told the truth: he set his suffering up out of stupid pride.
Â 
Killing his cousin: stupid and cruel.
Â 
I am addicted to the show because of Arya mainly. Â I simply fell in love with her character from the very beginning. Â Watching her go all dark is incredibly painful. Â 
Â 
I am hoping that D&D can bring some resolution to this story before Martin and/or I croak. Â In the meantime, I am trying to write my own version in my head. Â Pretty difficult with so many sociopaths behind and on the screen messing it all up.
Â 
So there and yes, I am very cranky right now.

It is very easy to write about violence against women or anyone so as to work against it. Â Child's play: simply write it from the perspective of the victim. Â Martin rarely, if ever, does that.

I don't know, Lady Ollenna told Marge to be very careful about what she says, even to her, just a couple of episodes ago. I think that there was a lot that went unsaid during that conversation, so I think its very possible that she knows after the fact or at least that she suspects, she just did not come out and say it or hint at it because it would be a really bad time to do it. I think there was some code talking going on there at least that's my take.

Â 
It is interesting to think of castration as a form of sexual abuse. Â I would have to say in our world, it definitely is. Â Especially when considering the purposes eunuch have been used for. Â In this narrative, it seems like more of a move to totally dehumanize and removing sexuality is just one of the various ways that was accomplished.
Â 
Do people in the story and fans then howl with laughter at the Maester?
Â 
Satin was denigrated because of his prostitution and implicit homosexuality, not his gender.
Â 
I stand on my origin post: if you want to write/work against abuse, you create the narrative FROM THE VICTIM'S POINT OF VIEW. Â Period. Â End of discussion.

966	BlueDragon	2014-04-21	I take it you completely ignored Sam's POV, parts of Tyrion's where he and others address his dwarfism, and Theon's entire arc in ADWD. gg, chief.Â

Â 
Quote me a quote from anywhere in books or series where the story of a female's victimization is being told from the point of view of the female at the time of the victimization itself. Â 
Â 
Sam, Theon, Tyrion are all males. Â 
Â 
Even if you find a few, they won't balance the scales, but it would be interesting to discuss how those depictions differ and what the audience reaction is likely to be.
Â 
Simple: female victim point of view in her own voice at the time of victimization.
Â 
The point of view perspective is how the reader comes to sympathize with Theon after he has destroyed Winterfell (via Ramsay), killing two innocent boys in the process and sending the North spiraling out of control. Â 
Â 
Jamie losing his hand via point of view and confessing about his kingslayer status changes the game completely. Â
967	MoA«t	2014-04-21	It doesnt really matter though because the character isnt in the show. So, its highly unlikely that was his mount.
Â 
Even moreso since he rode an elk and not a horse.I wasn't aware there was an announcement that Coldhands had been cut. Could you link that please? Or did you get screeners for the entire season?

Omg.
Go ahead. Read Dany's arc where shes repeatedly abused by Viserys in the first book. Sansa's entire story throughout the series. She is a constant victim. Arya nearly gets raped a couple of times and gets beaten quite a bit over the course of her tale. Stop with your worthless Social Justice Warrior crap. It doesnt fucking hold.

Literally Every Sansa Chapter In The Series


And Brienne's chapters. Oh gods..
971	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-21	There's also the first half of Arianne Martell's last chapter, where she's not only thrown in solitary confinement but cut off from that most basic of human psychological needs because Doran (her own dad) won't even let her gaolers and attendees even talk to her.
972	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	I think the problem with this lies on the fact that some readers might perceive Jaime as someone he isn't. I've read some comments about how this make him take a "step back" in his redemption arc. How is that exactly? Jaime hasn't yet changed. He has changed his attitude TOWARDS Brienne, that's not the same. Even the worst people in Westeros have a soft for somebody else. When Jaime first arrives to KL in books, he still is quite annoyed by Brienne's presence, even though he does cares about her. He calls Joffrey "squirt of seed", he barely felt anything about his dead, he wanted to marry Cersei (which probably would start more wars) and even having more children with her. In Show is different but the feeling is the same, he gets to KL and realise how powerless he is: no one recognises him, her sister/lover pushes him aside and blames him for leaving, Joffrey mocked him, Trant mocked him, his father wants him to give up the only thing he actually likes, even Brienne nags him about Sansa and on top of that, he can't do the one thing he enjoys besides Cersei: fight. He's POWERLESS. Rape -in fiction- is about power. Another King died under his watch, Cersei doesn't even let him be around Joffrey when he dies (once more, he pushes him). So, he takes it on Cersei who is now finally powerless as he is. He's broken in book and show and he's not the only character who cracks when broken. Loras killed two men when Renly died, I don't see him being chastised as much as Jaime has.I'm not giving up on Satin yet. Oh wait, he has no kink in the booksHow terrible would be that HBO keeps bringing invented whores but won't give us the one who is real and actually nice just because he doesn't have any sexual scenes.

Okay this is where I got really confused.Â 
Â 
Didn't Sam and Gilly tell Maester Aemon about the uprising? Hence the splitting of 'Little Piggy' and Ms Gilly & son...
Â 
Are you telling me Sam had no clue what was happening at Crasters when he straight high tailed it? This seems like the whole mutiny thing should have been known about already and miraculous Ed & Grenn survive yet again!
Â

977	Darth Pipes	2014-04-21	How terrible would be that HBO keeps bringing invented whores but won't give us the one who is real and actually nice just because he doesn't have any sexual scenes.


Â 
Heheh.Â  You're right.Â  The fact that Satin is a whore who doesn't have any sex scenes probably means there's no chance the character will appear.Â 
Â 
Speaking of whores...we have Oberyn hanging out with them constantly.Â  In the book, there's one brief mention that he known to have relations with men and women.Â  Well, that was enough to get D and D excited and now Oberyn's bisexuality is his defining trait in his first three appearancesÂ on the show.
978	Rhaegar Targaryen's Ghost	2014-04-21	Perplexing indeed. In the book this is the first time Jamie seems to get a sense of how much Cersei uses their relationship to manipulate him. Getting tired of HBO putting her on a pedestal.


Agreed. Making Jaime out to be a rapist is really going to change how people view him in the show compared to the books. Not happy about the change.Â
979	Roslin	2014-04-21	Cersei, seemed a little upset with her father taking Tommen as away.
980	Stannis I	2014-04-21	I rewatched the episode this evening. Â The rape was less rapey the second time around, but if D&D didn't mean it to be a rape, why was it so uncomfortable to shoot? Â Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.
Â 
Frankly, the amount of sexual violence directed at women in the books especially is beyond appalling. Â Despite this, I am a fan of the show and have read and reread the books. Â But I am under no illusions: this story reinforces violence against women and generally denigrates women far, far more than men.
Â 
Cersei is ambivalent in that scene in the books, but D&D have set her up to reject Jaime in the series and she has already by berating him for taking so long to get back to her. Â 
Â 
I love NCW so it is really hard for me not to like this character even after what he has done. Â Bran was unforgivable. Â Just unforgivable.
Â 
Killing the King, well now we understand that. Â He should have told the truth: he set his suffering up out of stupid pride.
Â 
Killing his cousin: stupid and cruel.
Â 
I am addicted to the show because of Arya mainly. Â I simply fell in love with her character from the very beginning. Â Watching her go all dark is incredibly painful. Â 
Â 
I am hoping that D&D can bring some resolution to this story before Martin and/or I croak. Â In the meantime, I am trying to write my own version in my head. Â Pretty difficult with so many sociopaths behind and on the screen messing it all up.
Â 
So there and yes, I am very cranky right now.


The story is set in a time where women were less then horse shit, so, yes, it's undermining them. Also, in case people haven't noticed, bastards, cripples and little-people are treated alike.
It's not meant to be a comforting and reassuring story, but a brutal one, staged in a brutal era of a ruthless world.
Those offensive things, they actually happened in our world.
Ah, slavery is not a GRRM creation as well.

982	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-22	So is it cannon that Petyr Baelish has a really deep scratchy voice with an Irish tinge to it, but has changed his voice to be more pleasant and "English" around people in public?
Â 
Because his voice seems to change when he's alone with Varys and Sansa, yet he still talked with that lightened accent with Ros and the rest of the Kingslanding crew regardless of season. At least that's what I can remember of the old episodes...or maybe they just felt him actually being LF being an amiable fellow is much too subtle, need to make him a gravely voiced cartoon pedo.Â

Ehh im not so sure whats canon nowadays. Hue.Â 
I do know that his accent and batman voice is irritating unsullied as well. Given the actor's track record, something tells me this was a direction choice, not an actor filigree.

I see...
989	Hodor knows	2014-04-22	Strange that it hasn't been addressed. I'm sure a lot of show-only fans are quite confused. The show is starting to feel a little loose and underwhelming. I know it's a different medium, I know it's impossible to capture all that the written word brings, but I also can't help but feel that the show is slowly drifting away. But am I Enjoying it.? Yes.
990	Arya Targaryen	2014-04-22	Nope. It was debated last week. Kit said in some interview that he knows Bran is alive and he found out off camera. Hah.It probably makes sense if Jon is going beyond the Wall again, before the fight, to kill the NW members at Crasters. This may be the time when Bran opens his third eye and maybe we get some Jon-warging-Ghost as well (and Gohst, finally! after two seasons, it is high time to remind the audience that Jon has a direwolf, too). It would be sort of weird if that happens after Bran is dead (or so Jon thinks). Bran may even be able to communicate with Jon, and tell him that he shouldn't tell anyone he is alive and just leave him to do what he has to.
991	T.C	2014-04-22	So they have advitised this as being based on the second half of ASOS and yet so much AFFC has been and will be in this season, lol.
992	Arya Targaryen	2014-04-22	So they have advitised this as being based on the second half of ASOS and yet so much AFFC has been and will be in this season, lol.And ADWD as well - Bran's storyline. Some of Theon, too, if he goes to Moat Cailin with Ramsey.
993	protar	2014-04-22	General thoughts on the episode. First the good:
Â 
> The Oberyn/Tywin scene was gold, and to be honest Tywin in general was probably the best thing about the episode.
> Meereen was good and I'm liking new Daario a lot more.
> Shireen/Davos is ever entertaining.
> Equal opportunity nudity. Sort of.
> Tyrion/Pod was brilliant.
Â 
The bad:
> The Jaime/Cersei scene for two reasons. Firstly it completely destroys Jaime's character arc. In the books that pretty much peaks at rescuing Brienne from the bear and then in the rest of SOS and AFFC we see Jaime coast along at an acceptable level of goodness. He doesn't do anything spectacularly redemptive ever again but by this point most of the audience likes him anyway. This scene completely changes that. Secondly Jaime's anger was so sudden as to be a non-sequiter. First he's calm and tender despite Cersei asking him to kill Tyrion and then he's...really not.
> Though well acted and not without character development the Arya/Hound scene(s) was too long for something with no plot development. The odd non-plot scene is fine if it furthers characterisation, but an entire triptych of scenes is too much.Â 
> We get it, Oberyn likes sex.Â 
> Far too much time spent on Gilly/Sam. I'd much rather they found some way to integrate Sam's arc into the rest of the stuff going on at the Wall a bit more. Maybe shift some of his politicking from his final chapter to before the battle, with him attempting to get Jon more accepted in the Watch again.
> Speaking of Jon the logic behind attack on Craster's doesn't really make any sense.
> The Dragonstone arc is really a mess. At the end of S3 the feeling is that Stannis is heading off to the Wall straight away, but now he's brooding on Dragonstone for weeks. It really hasn't been made clear that he is still planning to head for the Wall and just doesn't have the men forÂ that.Â Most of the Unsullied believe he still wants men to claim the throne, and there's a lot of confusion and boredom.
Â 
The rest for me was rather neutral. Neither spectacular, nor terrible. And even most of those negative points weren't terrible. It falls slightly short after Joffrey's death, not answering or clearing up enough about that. And I'm worried for what the mid-season will hold because there seems to me to be a lack of truly gripping events until Oberyn vs. Gregor.
994	oierem	2014-04-22	Do you think it' possible that Jon and Bran will actually meet at Craster's? It could be a powerful and poignant scene, Jon having to let Bran go...
995	SeventySeven	2014-04-22	Nope. It was debated last week. Kit said in some interview that he knows Bran is alive and he found out off camera. Hah.


Â 
Did he? Why do they do this. Some of the choices they make are really stupid.
996	Dorne Sand	2014-04-22	Personnaly i get that a tv show has to be less subtle, that some short cuts has to be found and that a tv show has specific pace and time constraints in order to be attractive while telling the story. In that regard, what happens in KL is greatly done. For exemple i didn't see a rape, the hole "it's wrong" and "not here" sounded feeble from cersei and i had the same wierd feeling as reading the book. The Arya arc is also very pleasant with cold realistic bastard HoundÂ  inspiring both possitive and hatred to arya, arya growing a bit too fast but that cannot be helped. The Petyr part with that voive changes is too vulgar for my taste, but i guess it is not that bad
Â 
Â 
What really annoys me, is the wall arc. Did i miss something in my readings? what's the point of sam bringing the girl to mole's town when he knows that they are wildlings arriving? What's that BS about going back to finish the crows in crasters keep? As if at this point the immediate threat was not those wildlings on the wrong side of the wall and as if anything would prevent mace to try and breach it whatever the numbers of the crows are on the other side?
I get that Jon is wise to counsel not to go figth the wildlings on their ground instead of castle black, but wasn't there the posibility for him to add that they could bring the mole's people in in order to protect them and so they could help with the defenses?
Â 
I don't understand where they are going with the wall or the point of the changes they made

Â 
Urgh, they haven't handled theÂ Jon/Stark situation well so far. Although, we haven't had allot of Jon scenes yet so I haven't given up yet.
Â 
His home is in ruins (by 'Theon'), the Starks are no more, his brother and step-mother were brutally slaughtered, his crippled little brother is facing dangers he is all too aware of beyond the Wall and his little sisterÂ is missingÂ and the otherÂ forced into a marriage with the enemy....is it too much to ask for some acknowledgement or angst? This is a big part of his character development in my opinion, especially taking into account Aemons 'duty vs love' speech about the reality of his vows in Season 1.
Â 
I wonder if we'll still get the 'when IÂ woke up the world had fallen apart' quote? I'm still hoping we'll get some angst with Locke or even Stannis talking about Robb and Winterfell.

Â 
Eww gross
1010	Eurymalys	2014-04-22	I wasn't aware there was an announcement that Coldhands had been cut. Could you link that please? Or did you get screeners for the entire season?


Â 
John Bradley actually did confirm that Coldhands had been cut in an interview with theÂ Wall Street Journal last month. I'm surprised the video hasn't made its rounds yet--a lot of people are still in the dark about the cut. Probably because it's a long interview and the bit about Coldhands is couched near the middle.
Â 
Here's the video:
Â 
http://www.youtube.c...h?v=I7FnnCLLOi4
Â 
It's around 16:00. Â 
Â 
It's a bummer--I loved Coldhands. But according to Bradley, this season is where the show and the books really begin to diverge. He also says, "There are some things that people will be expecting to be in season four that may not happen--or, if they do happen, wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t happen till future seasons." Take that as you will. As someone who's read the books and enjoys the show, I'm on one hand excited by the prospect. On the other hand, I'm kinda terrified.
If Stoneheart isn't revealed at the end of the finale, however, I'll go apeshit.
1011	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	Â 
Heheh.Â  You're right.Â  The fact that Satin is a whore who doesn't have any sex scenes probably means there's no chance the character will appear.Â 
Â 
Speaking of whores...we have Oberyn hanging out with them constantly.Â  In the book, there's one brief mention that he known to have relations with men and women.Â  Well, that was enough to get D and D excited and now Oberyn's bisexuality is his defining trait in his first three appearancesÂ on the show.


Â 
I do agree with the idea that Oberyn has already spent waaaaaaaaaaay too much time in THE brothel onscreen.Â  I did want to point out that Oberyn does eventually mention to Tyrion (I believe during a cell visit) that he really DID visit the brothel and instead of finding a blonde, he had met Alayaya and mentions those lovely scars she now has, iirc.Â  Still, here's hoping Oberyn is done with brothel duty.Â  Not that I don't enjoy a peek at him and Ellaria, but it'd be nice to see THEIR actual quarters in The Keep.Â
1012	The Deans of Qarth	2014-04-22	is it too much to ask for some acknowledgement or angst? ... I'm still hoping we'll get some angst with Locke or even Stannis talking about Robb and Winterfell.


Â 
Jon is finally overcoming his emo phase and you want him to turn up the angst? I get what you're saying, but that made me SMH
1013	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	lmao yeah. I love me some Edd and we need more Edd.Â 
Â 


Â 
I'm a little worried that they've marked up our Edd with those chain scars, but if it means we actually get some dialogue, I'll be happy.Â  I wonder if they will take Edd and Grenn back to Craster's Keep for the attack?Â  THAT would give Edd lots to grumble about.Â

I missed why those two were kept, not just killed
1015	King Zee	2014-04-22	Â 
Â 
You know its occurs to me that this season could well be subtitled Â "violence against men"
Â 
Joffrey - Poisoned by his mother in law
Tywin - Murdered by his own son
Theon - Tortured and turned into Gollum
Oberyn - Gets his face smashed in
The Mountain - Poisoned and dies an excruciating death
The Hound - Wounded in battle and left for dead
Â 
--
Â 
Violence is equally dealt to men, women and children in this story. It's a brutal world. Cut the bullshit.


Â 
Â 
Really. that was uncalled for.
Â 
People dont care if men get killed by other men. Its expected. Â 
Â 
Women dying, especially killed by their Â lovers is a Â much more dramatic theme. Â How many men have been killed by thier lovers in this show or even the books ?
Â 
Even Robert was killed by a boar not Â Cersei directly.

Â 
I think so did the showrunners...in the book they just flee back to the wall after the attack. But I guess we needed someone to know and report back what Dirk and Rast were up to? It's a messy plot they're telling, and I don't see why CH couldn't have been included, which would have made it a bit more tidy.
1017	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	I missed why those two were kept, not just killed


Â 
I'm not sure they even said why Edd and Grenn were held.Â  They showed the chain marks and that was about it, other than Edd mentioning something about NOW Craster's wives realize Daddy was a treat compared to the black crows.
Â 
I will admit, part of me didn't like the idea of saying Edd and Grenn were held captive.Â  It makes them look weak, in some ways, and they've done plenty already to make a mess out of story at and beyond the Wall the last few seasons.Â  But, all in all, I am happy to have both Edd and Grenn back.Â  I'm not sure why they didn't just have the two return with brothers as was done in the book.Â  I suspect it was to give us the reminder of Craster's Keep so the new raid could be planned on it?Â

Â 
LOL and JINX, I said just about the same thing.Â
1019	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	One thing I've been meaning to mention:Â  Did anyone notice Tywin, at the beginning of the episode, giving the order to seal the harbor or seize all the ships in the harbor?Â  I suspect that will be how he comes across Shae?Â  Not sure if this idea was posted yet, I haven't read the entire thread.
1020	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	Â 
LOL and JINX, I said just about the same thing.Â  


 
Â 
I also agree with your additional point that it makes them look weak, especially when so much of the Wall's story has been messed up. They've done a pretty poor job characterizing most of the NW, and an even worse job with Mance and his people. But I think for the sake of this medium, and given how unexpected the mutiny was, it's not completely unreasonable. And it was nice to see them back. I missed Ed's commentaryÂ

Â 
AH! Good catch! I had been assuming Bronn lied about her being gone, but I like this too.
1022	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	Â 
Urgh, they haven't handled theÂ Jon/Stark situation well so far. Although, we haven't had allot of Jon scenes yet so I haven't given up yet.
Â 
His home is in ruins (by 'Theon'), the Starks are no more, his brother and step-mother were brutally slaughtered, his crippled little brother is facing dangers he is all too aware of beyond the Wall and his little sisterÂ is missingÂ and the otherÂ forced into a marriage with the enemy....is it too much to ask for some acknowledgement or angst? This is a big part of his character development in my opinion, especially taking into account Aemons 'duty vs love' speech about the reality of his vows in Season 1.
Â 
I wonder if we'll still get the 'when IÂ woke up the world had fallen apart' quote? I'm still hoping we'll get some angst with Locke or even Stannis talking about Robb and Winterfell.


Â 
I wanted to ask:Â  Are we sure that these words of Kit's (about him knowing about Bran offscreen, and him laughing about that) didn't mean that it was Kit who knew the truth, instead of Jon.Â  Just wondering, I know Kit seems to have a good sense of humor, and I was wondering if that comment of his was clear or not?Â

Â 
I'm still not over Sam not sending the ravens, and I usually point out:Â  How could he........you had him digging latrine ditches, LOL
Â 
But, yes, I'm just mostly happy to see Edd and Grenn.Â  I love Edd and the two of them make a good pair onscreen, too.Â

Â 
It's possible he was speaking for himself, but it seemed like he was talking from Jon's PoV in the context, so who knows. I'm surprised it's never mentioned, though. Maybe on their way to Craster's Jon will say something about it?

Â 
I noticed that right away, but became distracted with Jaime and Cersei scenes yesterday.Â  I'm just staying away from that subject today, I think.Â  It'll be what it'll be, and the show will probably never re-address it onscreen.Â

Â 
I certainly have my own feelings on the matter, but it's definitely a relief that thread was locked. And I think it's okay that we'll be missing out on Grave's directing in the next season. His post-interviewers were...distasteful.
1028	Iron Maiden Islands	2014-04-22	There is another thread to discuss the scene between Cersei and Jaime. It goes for about 60 pages already... /rolleyes. Some of us don't want to discuss THAT specific part of the story, really. Not because it's wrong, uncomfortable or morally ambiguous but because it's TEDIOUS to hear the same arguments for 60 fucking pages. NO ONE here thinks rape is good, I'm quite sure of that. And if someone feels "morally" superior now because they condemn Jaime because of what he did, then what kind of person you were if you thought he was still ok when he pushed a kid through a window so he could keep fucking his own sister?

Â 
Luckily, I've only seen segments of Graves comments, not read entire articles.Â  He's not helping, atall.Â  I actually have some articles loaded now, and will read inbetween getting a few things done and just trying to have a little fun posting while I do.
Â 
I do think I have another little gem, like Tywin and the ship seizure, LOL, but I can't quite remember what it is right now.Â  It'll come to me.Â  Â  I hope.Â

1033	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	We're waiting for you to recollect your little gem! Hahaha 


Â 
LOL, it might take a rewatch.Â  I know I had two little things to ask about, one being Tywin's order to lockdown the harbor.Â 
Â 
It'll come to me, I think.Â

That too.Â  I just wanted to be sure I didn't babble everyone into silence, LOL Â Just reading all the articles about the show and the controversy is making me tired, probably because well, I'm tired, too, I'll just be the quiet one in the corner, unless I come up with something interesting.Â
1035	Moondancer	2014-04-22	I swear if this Jaime rape scene and Stannis infidel scene were in one episode the internet would've exploded.Â 

You, Sir, win the Internet  Or rather, the forum.
1036	Labirints	2014-04-22	This episode made me really like Pod. He is such a great guy.
Â 
Also why the hell Sam though that the Mole town will be safer for the wildling girl? It made no sense...

1037	robdavies1775	2014-04-22	When Tywin is lecturing Tommen he asks him what he would do if a House with fertile lands asks for help against another house with a strong navy. This could be foreshadowing the attack of the Ironborn on the Reach in AFFC... which Cersei responds very poorly to.Â
1038	gvewolf243	2014-04-22	Hm, i think that boy, who survived after slaughter, will kill Ygritte. Wel,, maybe Jon will teach him how to handle bow and arrow , first , than he'll do it in episode 9.
1039	starki	2014-04-22	Why harm Jaime's character arc with the rape scene in the sept ? Most pointless scene ever.
1040	ultimo12	2014-04-22	Overall it was a good episode, though I was a bit disappointed with Daario's fight at the end, they could have made it a bit more specatular IMO.
Also I'm desperate to see some sort of action from Ser Barristan, I know the actor is old but still, Jaime's line "he fought like a painter who only uses red" really made my mouth water. I still have hope there will be some opportunity later in the
series
Â 
I still wonder what's going to happen to the hound. Does he have some festering wound that no one knows about and will he just fall off his horse at some point, or how are they going to do it?
Â 
On a sidenote I'm really glad they brought back the actor who played Martyn Lannister in Season 3 to play Tommen in this one. Would have been a waste of a pretty face. Seems a talented actor too.

He took a cut across the back in the tavern but it doesn't seem to be bothering him.
I thought they would bring it up and have him say 'One of those cAonts cut me in that tavern' or such.
1042	Grail King	2014-04-22	Â 
Sansa wasn't there the same person she is now.


That, and they both had a bit to drink and also Stannis looked like he was winning and lets not forget the knife to Sansa's throat; she actually made the right choice knowing what she knew at that moment.

Yeah I saw that too. I still think that's how it will play out but maybe we're in for a surprise.
1044	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	Yeah I saw that too. I still think that's how it will play out but maybe we're in for a surprise.


Â 
We could. I think we may instead get another fight scene closer to the Eyrie, so that we get the added element of Arya missing out on another family reunion.Â
1045	KellieBom	2014-04-22	Sorry to swing so far off topic,
Â 
But what were those giant cookie looking things that were covering Joffreys eyes when he was laying in the Sept?Â  They had eyes painted on them, they seemed like some kind of medieval burial right.Â  The Egyptians did some serious stuff with their dead kings to prepare them for the afterlife, Joffrey is going to need all the help he can get, right?
Â 
What is the story with this?Â  I've looked everywhere and come up with nothing!

Â 
In the pilot they had these on Jon Arryn's body in the Sept. I'd assume it's a burial practice for those who worship The Seven, but it's certainly not explicated in the books. In fact I believe Joff is wearing a helm with a closed visor in the books.
1047	KellieBom	2014-04-22	HA!Â  The warrior he was.
1048	Impfan	2014-04-22	This episode?
Â 
Meh.
1049	A Man Is A Man	2014-04-22	Â I'm starting to lose faith in the show. It's one thing to simplify complex characters and "white-wash" them, it's another to completely destroy a redemption character-arc. Jamie Lannister, we hardly knew ye.
1050	Sword of Nightfall	2014-04-22	Whores go to HBO. Finally we know!
1051	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-22	I still love how right after Janos ask Sam where his wildling whore is, the next thing you see him doing is taking Gilly to a Whore House.

1052	Ser Lawrence	2014-04-22	Seems like the stones with open eyes painted on them is a religious thing for those that worship the seven.Â  
Â 
The departures from the books don't bother me as much as they seem to bother others.Â  I find myself liking the QoT and Onion Knight more than I ever did in the books, still don't care about Stannis or Coldhands, like Shireen in the show better than the book.Â  
Â 
On the other hand, Jorah was my favorite character in the books (I can sympathize with being stuck in the "friend-zone") but I am not committed to his character as much in the show.
Â 
Plus, all the Stark kids are way older on the show because it would be crazy kiddy porn to do it otherwise on TV... don't remember how old Danny is in the book, but you see my point.
Â 
Some stuff doesn't meet my expectations, or departs from my original visions reading the books, but I fall in with those that are still enjoying the ride.Â  I still get excited every Sunday for my fix and hate how short the seasons are.
Â 
As an aside:Â  "whitewashing" is an expression that may be suffering from over-use on this board.Â  Just saying.
1053	Kronz	2014-04-22	Whitewashing is a common complaint, but now we have blackwashing to balance it out.
1054	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-22	Whores go to HBO. Finally we know!
1055	A Man Is A Man	2014-04-22	Whitewashing is a common complaint, but now we have blackwashing to balance it out.


Â 
Â I am sympathetic to Stannis-fans for the "blackwashing" he has gotten but ho boy did Jamie get raped (he says ironically).
1056	mafalda	2014-04-22	Slow episode, but not every episode can be GREAT.Â 
Â 
This show sure does have a thing about rape.. first Drogo, now Jaime? Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but in GoT, Drogo does not rape Dany.. at first she IS afraid of him, but then she allows it to happen. And Jaime. Ugh, ok, this topic has been discussed enough, you get the point.Â 
Â 
But I DO wonder what GRRM truly thinks of the show. The show runners go along with the general storyline, sure, but they also make a lot of significant changes. I know they have to change things for budget and timing, but other changes seem to happen for no reason (none that I can see anyways). One of GRRM's clauses should have been that DD should have involved him more in the script. I read on a website about his response and he seemed to kind of insinuate that he didn't know much about the controversial scene from this week's episode.Â 
Â 
Anyways, question. Has Stannis mentioned the Wall at ALL this season? Him finding out about the letter was one of the best scenes in the finale last season, and now I don't think he's brought it up at all. He might have and I didn't catch it, but so far all I've seen him do is have a nice dinner, then talk to Davos about Bravos.

Â 
GRRM spent many long years in Hollywood as a writer.Â  I'm sure he was aware of what was likely to happen to his story in Hollywood hands. He's probably just grateful that it's not worse than it is -- and I imagine he really enjoys the fantastic amounts of money he's making, both from the show directly and from the increased sales of all his books (money that goes directly to him.)Â Â Â 
Â 
Hollywood is not, in any way, the place to take your stories if you love them too much to let someone else mess with them.Â  GRRM knew what he was getting into.

Ha! Very true, Rill. Just in interviews I get a sort of read between the lines feeling from him. Like maybe he wants to say more, but goes against it. But you're right, Hollywood isn't the place if you're too near and dear, and I'm sure he's enjoying his two homes directly across the street from each other Â
1059	boojam	2014-04-22	Pretty good!Well SOME whores got to HBO....Most go to STARZ!

Â 
Oh yeah, I'm sure they make changes he doesn't like. But it would be rude and foolish for him to criticize D&D directly. It's much more in his interest to put it down to "Their intentions were good but wow, did they ever mess that up," and just be really tactful in how he expresses that thought. It might even be true that it was just a shortsighted poorly thought-out flub.
Â 
He probably regards the show versions of his characters as completely distinct from the book versions.Â  I will be interested to see, when WoW is released, if I can detect any signs of shifting in his characters based on show interpretations he might actually like -- as in, will he deliberately or inadvertently start modeling Tyrion more like Peter Dinklage, with Dinklage's mannerisms?Â  Will Sansa seem more like Sophie Turner? How about Brienne and her actress?
Â 
But I've simply decided to put Show Jaime and Book Jaime into two separate boxes, which is what I expect GRRM is doing as well, only more so.Â  Show Jaime does stuff like kinslaying and rape.Â  It's too bad, because I really do like NCW and have watched him in a number of things like that "New Amsterdam" show he headlined several years back (he was good, the show was lousy, heh), and I can really "see" him as Jaime most of the time, but I think that's over now.Â  It's not that I thought Jaime was a good guy, but he did have his own morality centered around his family, and this guy on the show just isn't him.Â
1061	rmholt	2014-04-22	Didn't he say Osha on TV led him to do more with her in the books? That's one example but the only one I know of.
1062	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-22	Â

I know JK Rowling had this happen with her characters during the Harry Potter series. The films were actually affecting how she saw the characters. Snape became more and more Alan Rickman and less Slimy Asshole Teacher. He was full blown Alan Rickman in the sixth and seventh book. I think with GRRM, he might start Dinklaging Tyrion a little and Arya might be a little bit more Maisie, but i doubt it will be like "oh i like that so im going to deliberately do it." I think he'll just begin doing it subconsciously. I dont think the descriptions of the characters will change though.Â 
Â 
About That One SceneÂ<U+0099>, im a little sad about it cuz Jaime in the show and Jaime in the books seemed to be pretty much the same guy. While i dont think Show Jaime is RUINED FOREVER, he isnt quite the same guy anymore and thats disappointing.
1063	Konradsmith	2014-04-22	If any of you've seen the promo for Oathkeeper, he has at least four scenes in the episode. Anyone who's been turned against him will likely be won back once the episode air. He does a helluva lot of sympathetic stuff next week. Also he has a scene with Cersei where perhaps they'll clarify what went down.

MODS. APPROVE OF OATHKEEPER THREADS! OTHERWISE THERE'LL BE A BIT MORE OF THIS STAGNATION!

I have requested for it 2 days ago. Still no movement.Â
1065	Konradsmith	2014-04-22	Well, I don't know why they'd delay like that but if I have to wade through anymore damned complaining when I've got thoughts on that promo, you know constructive speculation (one of the things that AFOIAF excels at when its at its best)...Why I oughta!

1066	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-22	In that promo, depending on how the Cersei scene where she tells Jaime to go hunt for Sansa is handled he might even lose more fans. The Bronn training session will probably just fly over their heads, i mean itll just be him being a noob... i forgot the rest... gotta go watch again
Â 
Anyways, I think, but im not sure, that Brienne is a very loved character by the unsullied and when Jaime gives her Oathkeeper and that new armor they will forget all about what happened a couple days ago(maybe)
If anything they might just think hes a cool piece of shit
1067	Konradsmith	2014-04-22	Also he looks to have a scene with Tyrion. So a few "pet the dog" moments from him coming up. For those who are upset it might serve as adequate damage control.

1068	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-22	Personally, I love those. Jaime's relationship with Tyrion was his first redeemable quality that we knew of. There wasnt enough of them in the books, though the upcoming ones will probably be book canon too. But those might go down the drain also when that "Tysha confession" comes along...
Â 
...if it comes along.Â
1069	Konradsmith	2014-04-22	Jaime will be playing the Kevan role, visiting Tyrion in his cells. Also from the Foreshadowing feature we had a shot of him speaking to Tyrion while he's on the stand on trial as if Jaime was his lawyer.
1070	rmholt	2014-04-22	There is already a forum for next week, right ?

If Tyrion doesn't get to knock Jaime on his butt, while, I ,... < shakes fist>
1072	Petyr Patter	2014-04-22	I think this was the DARKEST episode in Game of Thrones so far.Â  There might have been sadder episodes, or more tragic episodes, or even episodes more emotionally traumatizing.Â  Yet, nearly every scene in this episode was showing a world of cruelty, poverty, and abuse of the weak.
Â 
Sansa escapes the frying pan of King's Landing and falls into the fire.Â  Littlefinger's evil would make Tywin want to have a bath.Â  And he now has Sansa.Â  The poor girl can't have anything nice, not even for an episode.
Sam takes Gilly to live and work (on her feet) in a whore house.Â  I question the wisdom of this move, but watching her care for her son on the dirt floor with rags is a sad image on its own.Â  Is this what he "saved" her for?
Tyrion sits in jail with his last friend in the world smuggling him food.Â  The scene ends with Tyrion ordering Podrick to flee King's Landing, and he is now a man alone in the world.Â  His family is moving to convict him.Â  His wife is fled.Â  He sent his lover away and she probably hates him now.
The Hound finds a godly man who gives him food and shelter for a night.Â  The man offers the Hound fair wages for fair work, in other words an opportunity to help rebuild the world he helped destroy as a Lannister lackey.Â  The Hound repays the kindness by robbing the man of his silver and claims they'll be dead by winter.Â  He then throws the deaths of Eddard, Robb, and perhaps Rickard as well into her face as evidence that his way is the right way.
Cersei, convinced Tyrion is responsible for Joffrey's death, asks Jaime to murder their brother before a trial.Â  That is pretty grim.Â  Jaime's response is to rape Cersei... in Baelor's sept... next to the Joffrey's corpse.Â  The fact that this isn't the most disturbing scene of the episode (though perhaps it is the most shocking considering how out of character it is for Jaime) is testement to either Martin's or somebody at HBO's need for a Valium prescription.
And then we have the wildlings attack a peaceful village and massacre its inhabitants.Â  Because death isn't dark enough, Styr holds a blade to a child's throat, informs the boy that he has just killed his parents and will proceed to eat them.Â  It is a tactic to lure the Night's Watch out of Castle Black, but was still disturbing to watch.
The episode ends on what I think was suppose to be a hopeful and uplifting moment, but frankly its the third time we've seen Danaerys playing savior, the first being Aastapor and the second being the season three finale.Â  It is getting old and doesn't change anything.Â  Essos remains a world away from Westeros, and the problems with Westeros have nothing to do with slavery.Â  It has to do with how war breaks down the cultural and social forces that keep people safe and prosperous.Â  And should she ever invade Westeros, it would be as another conqueror destabilizing whatever peace Tywin Lannister can salvage.

Ooooh i like this post.Â 
As for the Dany part, its still pretty fucking grim, yeah. Cuz the slave picks up the collar and you just know hes eyeballing his master and totally going to shank his ass. You seem more bored with Dany's moment, and i hear ya, but its going to escalate and we finally get toÂ seeÂ whats going to happen cuz she isnt just going to move on after that. Slaves murdering their masters in the streets and shit. But yeah, its "HEY WE KNOW JOFFERS IS DEAD, BUT GUESS WHAT! THE WORLD STILL SUCKS AND YOU GOTTA DEAL WITH IT!" The Episode.Â

1075	brave  danny flint	2014-04-23	After a long, hard look at this episode (I've watched it four times) I've come to the conclusion that the sexual violence portrayed in that scene was just as terrible as some of the other violence in that episode -- for instance, the despicable filth the Thenn told that poor little boy. Â Also disturbing was seeing Ygritte slaughter men, women and children. Â And of course, it was heartbreaking to see that beautiful little girl make rabbit stew for Arya and the Hound, with a kind, pious, but admittedly someone not as robust as the Hound, praying for the gods' blessing.Â 
Â 
The gods don't give a fuck. Â At least the gods of the Seven, it seems to me.
Â 
My opinion of Show!Jaime might be beyond repair. Â It is just so completely out of character for him that it twists the viewer's perception of him irreparably. Â Before, he was on a path of redemption -- with this act of sexual violence, he has sullied his new chance to be good and honorable. Â Sure, the timing also made this act a possibility -- she had just asked him to kill Tyrion, whom he loves, and she was definitely giving him "yes/no" responses -- but it served no good purpose in the end, I promise everyone that. Â Benioff&Weiss will take a LOT of flak for this, esp from feminist groups. Â 
Â 
George himself is unhappy about it, although he phrased his response delicately.
Â 
I am not sure how much of this stuff has been covered, but I'm sorry, I couldn't read 36 pages.
Â 
Random:
Â 
-- I liked how Ser Dontos told Sansa "you're stronger than you know" -- it was a nice echo to Jojen Reed telling Summer/Bran in COK that the grey wolf "is stronger than he knows".
Â 
-- How creepy was it when Littlefinger's arms descended from the top of the ship, without being able to see the head from Sansa's angle, and she was suddenly lifted up and over into his arms? Â I thought that was a delightfully visually symbolic shot, rich in meaning.
Â 
-- I actually thought the arrival at Meereen was REALLY cool, in no small part due to Ramin Djawadi's BRILLIANT song composition. Â This is a new theme - we'll probably be hearing it a lot throughout the next couple of seasons. Â Meereen itself looks really beautiful, actually. Â It looks like a city Daenerys Targaryen would rule over, from a high pyramid. Â What does everyone else think?
Â 
-- The fight between Daario and Pahl was pretty good - since I'm not a fan of violence, I like how it was sort of quick and short, but really clever too. Â His wink at her was charming, too. Â Let's hope he gets sexier as the season goes along. Â But then I'm sure Emilia coupling with any man makes it high-octane sexy.
Â 
-- The scene with Tywin educating Tommen was actually really thrilling to me for some reason. Â I have no idea why, but I really liked it. When Tommen finally got that wisdom was a king's most important quality, the way Charles Dance said "YES!" just made me squee a littleÂ   Â Their acting is just so great. Â 
Â 
-- I have come to love Lena Headey's acting with all my heart. She IS Cersei, now.
1076	brave  danny flint	2014-04-23	You know what just occurred to me? Â Wouldn't it be awesome if the gentle, pious man, whom Sandor is POSITIVE will be "Dead come winter", ends up as the head septon on the Quiet Isle? Â It's in the Riverlands, but I have to see how close it is to Fairmarket. Â That would be such irony. Â I could imagine him coming in wounded, and someone feeding him rabbit stew, he recognizes it, sees the girl/man, and starts crying like a BABE :-D
1077	oierem	2014-04-23	I know JK Rowling had this happen with her characters during the Harry Potter series. The films were actually affecting how she saw the characters. Snape became more and more Alan Rickman and less Slimy Asshole Teacher. He was full blown Alan Rickman in the sixth and seventh book.


Hmmmm,really??? Where did you get that?? Any examples?

Â 
I agree it was very dark, but I'd say pretty much everyone would treat Sansa better than Lannisters. All the abuse from Joffrey, and if she got caught in KL she'd get trialed and executed. For now, Littlefinger is the only way out.
Â 
I liked the ending. Unlike other royal candidates who huff and puff "because it's my right to rule I will be king PERIOD", Daenerys is the one going through the learning process of how to rule and more importantly, care about the people.
1080	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-23	Just watched the episode again. The Stannis/Davos, Wildlings and Castle Black scenes were my favourite this episode which is strange since they were the things they did terribly last season.
1081	macc24	2014-04-23	Does anyone know what Tywin said to Oberyn when O asked him to confirm he had nothin to do with the death of his sister and niece an nephew. 
It sounded like a non-English (common tongue) word possibly a dornish word that would've meant more to Oberyn than saying "I wasn't involved" as soon as it was said, Oberyny seemed much less tense.

Do you mean "categorically"? If I remember correctly, he says something like he denies it categorically - i.e. absolutely, unambiguously.
1083	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-23	Definitely categorically.
1084	paulh_85	2014-04-23	People have mentioned Selmy getting some fighting.
Â 
In the book, doesnt he save Dany from the Titan of Braavos before revealing himself as Barristan?
Â 
Anyone think they might have added this scene into an upcoming episode?
1085	Ran	2014-04-23	The Titan had his head chopped off by Daario in the show, so Barristan would have to save her from someone else -- presumably one of the first signs of the existence of the Sons of the Harpy or something.I surely would like them to give Barristan something to do.
1086	robdavies1775	2014-04-23	Such a Charles Dance-appropriate word! That scene was really well done.Â
1087	boojam	2014-04-23	I surely would like them to give Barristan something to do.Yeah I know, but what have Iain Glen and Ian McElhinney really had to do but act as sounding boards for Dany?Barristan Selmy kills a manticore is S3E1.Jorah Mormont does a little sword fighting in S3E9.In the books Selmy does another Dany save , never know on the show they do move or re-frame things from the books.(Arya's kill at Harrenhal is moved to a Frey soldier kill after the RW.)That's about it until a certain Selmy sequence in Dragons.Still having them around as good, even in the books who the heck does she have to talk too?Well Daario does get into the act, but I wonder how the heck that will play out on the show?(All her Dothraki Blood Riders are non speaking WAY in the background, and the Dothraki hand medians are all gone. She interacts with Missandei on the show, I guess that will go on?)

1088	Darryk	2014-04-23	There were a lot of really strong scenes in that episode. My favourites were Tywin schooling Tommen, and the Tyrion-Podrick scene.
1089	Starksmustwin	2014-04-23	While the Sept scene was a little more harsh than in the books due to Cersei never really giving in fully, I don't really get why most people say it's straight up rape. Â  You can clearly see her kissing him back and groping at him and even though she's saying "it's not right" at the end, it's not like she's really fighting him. Â And Jaime saying "I don't care" is clearly in response to her saying "it's not right".
Â 
Honestly, it looked more like a scene were she wants him too, but not there beside her dead son. Â  The people claiming that this scene makes Jaime a rapist need to rewatch it. Â Â

Â 
Because she didn't want to, at all. That's what makes it rape.
Â 
Unlike the book where it becomes consensual.

Â 
Thing is, though, we have been conditioned to see the Slave Masters as irredeemably evil.Â  Like orcs or Nazis or reavers.Â  You can never feel bad about killing them.Â  The show has skipped over any sort of ambiguity, though this is at least sourced in the books where she doesn't have to actually deal with the fallout of her actions until Meereen.Â

I agree that "pretty much everyone" would treat Sansa better.Â  However, "pretty much" leaves room for a few rare specimens.Â  Obviously the Mountain would rape, beat, and eventually kill her.Â  The same might be said of Joffrey, but he was kept in check by Tywin and Tyrion.Â  Littlefinger is also one of the people who Sansa is in worse hands with.Â  Remember, this is the guy who told Ros to stop crying after seeing a baby murdered in the brothel by threatening to kill her as a "bad investment."Â  He might be subtler and smiles, but he will take what he wants from Sansa, and there is no one to stop him.
1094	Forbidden	2014-04-23	For me, the most disturing was the reaction of the public to the Jamie/Cercei scene, because I thought it was clearly rape. And I found it very odd that people didn't considerer it that way.Â 
Â 
More, Jamie just proved once more that he's worse than Cercei, but I guess the public apologize him because he's a man, and I noticed that pattern in other series, like Mad Men and Breaking Bad. It's sad, really...
Â 
And I'm talking just about the tv series, as I havent read the books.
Â 
Â
1095	Fez	2014-04-23	The Titan had his head chopped off by Daario in the show, so Barristan would have to save her from someone else -- presumably one of the first signs of the existence of the Sons of the Harpy or something.
I surely would like them to give Barristan something to do.


Â 
I seem to recall reading once that the actor playing Barristan isn't in good enough shape (or possibly it's a matter of a previous injury/surgery, and not lack of fitness) to do a believable fight scene, which is why he never does anything physically challenging on the show. Do you know anything about that?
1096	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-23	He could still whoop that Dothraki guys ass.
1097	Tyrion1991	2014-04-23	I really hated the scene where Dany explains to the audienceÂ how much she cares about Jorah more than anyone elseÂ .
Â 
Firstly, its 100% inconsistent with the changes they made in season 3. Jorah did not lead the Battle of Yunkai as he does in the books. He has not once led the army or even been implied that he was the general. Daario is the military leader who planned and executed the conquest of Yunkai. Also, she was a total bitch to Jorah last season. Being snappish with him, dismissing his advice, not taking him into her trust, showing 0 preference or interest in this characters well being and when she burns the people at Astapor even refusing to acknowledge him as ifÂ shes insulted by his presence. One of the first lines in season 3 is Dany telling him "its too nice a day to argue". There was nothing last season to suggest that these two were close friends or that Jorah was 100% in Danys trust. In fact the opposite is implied multiple times.Â So HBO isÂ being massively inconsistent in its adaptation. It deliberately and consciously removed any and all scenes from Storm of Swords which might suggest Danys perception of Jorah.Â Â 
Â 
Â 
The book has many scenes betweenÂ Dany and Jorah that make this relationship self evident and not require such a dumb explanation. The only reason they have done this is that there has been absolutely nothing for show Jorah to do. He stopped being a character in season 3, Dany and him have had nothing to do with eachother. Now that hes close to being exiled the show is forced to have Emilia Clarke bluntly explain how her characterÂ is meant to view Jorah at this stage in the story. Its absolute bullshit. Dany in the books did not need to say something as dumb and stupid as that.
Â 
Â 
The problem is that Jorah has as much screen time and lines as Grey Worm and Missandei since season 2. They have focused completely onÂ first introducing new characters and from half way through season 3 an obsessive focus on Daario. Literally, every single scene with Daenerys in every episode has focused almost exclusively onÂ their relationship; long before it becomes relevant in the books. In season 4 episodes 1 & 3 the show demonstrates this again. Adding extra material and rewriting whole chapters purely so that Daario can be the only character that matters in Danys story. ThereÂ was PLENTY of time to focus and develop Danys relationship with Daario once Jorahs exiled. Especially since it looks like she is taking Meeren in episode 4 when Jorah should have been exiled.Â 
Â 
This,Â complete butchery of Jorahs storyline aside,Â was in season 3 passable as its exclusion didn't go against the story they were trying to tell. But they are going to exile Jorah this season. To go into that event without any interaction or character moments between them beyond dumb useless info dumps like Dany having to remind us how her character feels about this random extra shes had nothing to do with since season 2 is stupid. Why delay Jorahs exile to be later in the series if you obviously don't want to tell the characters story as GRRM wrote it? Just get rid of him and be done with it. You can't just have his exile stand on its own as a random reveal. Its counter intuitive. Its not going to be climatic if Dany exiles the random extra who hasn't done or said anything for 2 seasons? Its like in Breaking Bad. Watching the "I am the one who knocks scene" in isolation without havingÂ watched the series and the building tension between the characters develop will never have as much impact.Â

1098	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-23	For me, the most disturing was the reaction of the public to the Jamie/Cercei scene, because I thought it was clearly rape. And I found it very odd that people didn't considerer it that way.Â 
Â 
And I'm talking just about the tv series, as I havent read the books.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
It jars the show-only people worst, and I can see it causing a divide.Â 
Without giving too much away if you do want to read, the book counterpart of that scene was tumultuous, forceful, (still) incestous and with a touch of necro now, but definitely not rape.
Perhaps the show could have made a subtle change in the scene to make this more clear.
Â 
Still ... Lannisters + sex = squick. It is known.
1099	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-23	I'm going to be mad if they just skip the trial and go straight to the trial by combat. First of all the trial is pretty pivotal with Shae's betrayal of Tyrion. Second, I thought it was very dramatic having Oberyn talk with Tyrion and then reveal that he won't help him as his judge, but as his champion. That was a huge fist pump moment for me when I read ASOS. All the impact of that scene will be lost if the idea is already brought up beforehand.Â

They won't, I think. We've had bits from Tyrion's speech at the trial in various trailers.
1101	ChozenOne	2014-04-23	Don't know if anyone's mentioned this yet since I haven't read through all if the replies, but does anyone else think the kid played by Brennik O'Connor is going to take on Satin's role a little bit and be the one to shoot Yigritte with a crossbow? She shot his dad in the head and he was staring her down while crying under that wagon. I think it would be great if he could get a little revenge for his murdered and canibalized parents!

This is true, I forgot about. Good news then.Â
1105	Mithras	2014-04-24	Not sure if this was brought before but Tywin said that Aerys I was killed by his brother. It is not clear how he died and was succeeded by Maekar. Rhaegel had sons of his own and he was the heir of Aerys. There are some ideas about the tension between Bloodraven and Maekar in D&E novellas. A person proposed that Maekar would ill kill Rhaegel just like he killed Baelor which Egg strongly objected.

Â 
Yes, I plan to start reading the books soon...
Â 
But I have read that scene, as it appeared in an article, and althought it still was a little forceful, it was much less violent, and it showed that she wanted it. I dont know, in the show it wasn't like that. And the context of the scene made it even worse, with Jaime insulting her just before the act!
1109	Lord Snide	2014-04-24	Â 
Â 


So was anyone else getting the vibe that Tywin sanctioned the Joffrey hit besides me? Â Or is that silly?


Not at all silly this is plausible even from the books... I think Tywin knew Joffrey was Cersei and Jamie's offspring . Tywin pretty much told Cersei in the last series he may well yet do something about Joffrey.
Delicious to consider that Tywin and Grandma Tyrell conspired in the act.Â  I think that Tywin despises Cersi more than he does Tyrion but he is such aÂ  (long term ) game player he is happy to bide his time . Â 
Â Tywin gets to elimininate Joffrey AND take care of Tyrion. Tywin knows Tyrion is intelligent and capable of planningÂ  strategyÂ  hell Tyrion is raising an army from nothing in Dance with Dragons.Â  Cersei is a
Â blunderbuss , Tyrion is a stealth bomber . Â  Liked this episode v much . If that scene with Jamie and Cersei depicted a rape I am ok with that considering this series has given usÂ  murder , mutilation,
torture and other modes of savagery by the bucketload ... if people are truly distressed by this then go read Famous Five or something. Or read up on the War of Rose and The Anarchy from "actual"
mediaeval history.Â  TV show JaimeÂ  ia still a character on a redemptive arc maybe his redemption will alsoÂ  result in his death.Â  Just as the Stark family is seemingly annihilated at the momentÂ  it is plausible that
the Lannisterrs will be destroyed at the end of the sagaÂ  GRRM is confecting ( but notTyrion ).Â  Sweetly ironic, no?Â  Reckon the last song of the last ep will be the Rains of Castamere.
1110	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-24	Â 
The Game of Thrones Wiki page says Aerys. But if he said Orys, then it is worse.


Â 
Yeah, one of the things I thought (and mentioned here but it went unnoticed) was that it might have been Aerys I who was being referred to.Â  It's possible Charles Dance just chose a slightly odd pronunciation there.Â  Shireen pronounced "Aegon" as "Eggon", instead of rhyming the "ae" with "Play" or "Sigh" like most book readers do, so maybe Aerys is pronounced "Erris" and Dance just rounded the vowel out a lot.
Â 
Aerys I is actually a good candidate for this because:
Â 
1) One of his brothers (Rhaegal) was "mad", although also "meek" so maybe not violent.
2) One of his brothers (Maekar) was known to be moody and sulky and already had a rep for killing another of his brothers (Baelor Breakspear)
Â 
And Aerys I was described as both "sickly" and "clever" in the Dunk & Egg stories, so it seems reasonable he'd be the sort of bookish king known for legal justice instead of, say, personal combat ability.Â 
Â 
It doesn't actually seem all that likely that either Rhaegal or Maekar would actually have killed Aerys, but certainly it's the type of rumor that took hold often enough even if not true.Â
1111	Ran	2014-04-24	The broadcast script says Orys. They made up some pre-Conquest king. And with 8000 years of reputed history, nothing says there might not have been a King Orys at some point.

Â 
Then they chose a very alarming name 
Â 
Many of us are dying to learn what happened to Aerys, Rhaegel, his sons and the tension between Bloodraven and Maekar. All the D&E novellas have some hints about these and I am not sure whether we can learn what really happened from a maester's account (in TWOIAF).

I almost think they chose a name that the pronunciation could be questionable on.Â
1114	Silver Prince	2014-04-24	Not sure if this has been already mentioned, but why is Missandei translating what the champion of Meereen says? Isn't he supposed to speak Valyrian? Dany seems to perfectly understand Valyrian.

Â 
To give the actress something to do.Â 
Â 
Same with how Dany needlessly has all the supporting characters ask to champion for her.Â 
Â 
Even though its painfully obvious that Barristan is THE logical choice. He will not lose to this Ghiscari. In the books Dany does not realize she has the greatest living Kingsguard with her. Fighting as her champion is what a Queensguard would do. Its his job. All barristan can do is fight really good. He'll be gone from Danys side for 10 seconds.
Â 
Also acting like Daario considers himself not important in Danys party was just to play the "low born" card and earn sympathy it pathetic and makes no sense. Jorah, in the show, is not a great general. The show made it very clear that it was Daario who planned the Battle of Yunkai unlike in the books. Hes also the only thing keeping the 2000 strong (thats 1/5th of Danys army BTW) loyal to her as he is their leader and brought them over to her side in the first place. Daario is much more indispensable to her if we follow the shows established logic. Why risk it at all when Barristan will kill this lesser man easily?
Â 
But no. Danys arc is just about teasing her fucking Daario now so lord forbid it be Barristan. I mean its not like HBO already spent four episodes emphasizing Daario was a badass fighter so highlighting this again was 100% unnecessary.Â 
Â 
Â 
Also, goes without saying that they make him way too nice guy when he humbly says that he is not worthy and she can afford to lose him. Daario would never say that. Where is the bastard from the books who wants to talk Dany into skinning children and going red wedding on the slavers? Certainly not this nice guy. I highly suspect that they're doing what they are doing with Shae where they change the character to be really nice and idealized then randomly do a 180 when the story requires them to. Very much part of them white washing Danys character.Â

1116	Ghost wind	2014-04-24	First post here! Anyway, I was reading the opinions regarding the episode and I'm surprised nobody's even mentioned how badly they are handling the whole Jon Snow's arc. He gets injured running away and with barely enough time to recover Castle Black is attacked. So he is injured, shooting arrows from a tower, which means he wonÂ´t be able to fight so he'll be helpless in YgritteÂ´s death.Â 
Â 
BUT NOOOOO they had to wait like half a season of wildlings just going around doing nothing, also Sam arrives to Castle Black with Gilly before the attack (why for?) and they had to send her to Moles town. The whole attack in the night, Jon proving his strength, Ygritte's death, everything, was simply butchered and now they want to send them back to the North again??!! WHY? And there is no budget excuse or anything like that because all they had to do was show the wildling attack on CB in the premiere (making it much stronger).Â 
Â 
Probably this is as bad a deviation from the book as is Jaime raping Cersei, which is a huge deviation in itself.

Â 
While Dany's champions were making a piss contest to face the champion of Meereen, I expected Daario to take this contest literally and say "Me member is twice the size of his and I can piss thrice the distance." I think Dany would like it.

I see the champion might speak High Valyrian. Or the translation might be from Low Valyrian which is influenced by Ghiscari and different from High Valyrian - perhaps better understood by her intended audience who call her by an Old Ghiscari title? http://gameofthrones...ki/Old_Ghiscari

I think it's too soon to tell.
1120	King Tommen	2014-04-24	I think having an entire episode fully focused on a massive attack on Castle Black which comes from both sides simultaneously where a huge SFX and practical effects budget has been allocatedÂ  which will include multiple one-on-one faceoffs (Jon/Styr, Thorne/Tormund, Giant/somebody, Ygritte/most likely little boy who's father she killed, Sam saving Gilly etc) is more than what any fan of that storyline could ask for.
Â 
They're delaying things in order for the attack to be on a much larger scale and provide a sustained focus whereby we get to see all the characters interact and have a dramatic climax (the arrival of Stannis) all in the same episode.
Â 
If you get over the "it didn't happen this way in the books" aspect, then you should really be looking forward to how this will play out. You're getting a "Blackwater" dedicated solely to Jon.
1121	Tyrion1991	2014-04-24	Â

Â 
I frankly don't get HBO or D&D logic. They must know that book readers despise Daario and Danys relationship with him is horribly maligned. To make that the focus of two/three seasons of her story is pretty silly since hes only the focus of attention for one book. Even stranger since, apparently one of the Ds is meant to be a Jorah fan. If GRRM had not wrote all the stuff in ASOS with Jorah they would never have considered casting Iain Glen or mentioning that he loves Dany. Hell, I'd even go so far as to say that Iain Glen was cast with the scene where Jorah kisses Dany in mind. Yet their actions have bordered on malicious in terms of adapting the characters story from ASOS. IMO you're better off killing a character off if you're not interested in adapting their story.Â 
Â 
It would be so stupid and wrong if we end up having Jorah get more to say and do when hes with Tyrion next season than in this one.Â 
Â 
Daario will be around for many seasons. Next one will focus exclusively on the Hidzhar Quentyn conflicts of the heart with Dany. They have plenty of time to build his character and relationship with Dany; even if the Battle of Meereen comes in season 5. But seasons 3 and 4 were devoted so heavily towards introducing and selling Daario to us.
Â 
Jorah the random extra being exiled will fall flat.Â 
Â 
Hell it would be cringe worthy if Jorahs absence is more noted in season 5 than he was when he was with her.Â

If it happens as you say the episode would be great yes, but that "Blackwater" dedicated to Jon could only happen in E09 if you see the names, and what are they going to do in 6 episodes exactly? Because they already set up that the wildlings are marching on the wall from the South so they will have two different attacks and if they divide it there is no way that with the changes they are doing, the scenes can be of such an impact as they were in the books. Also if they divide it then it has no sense to do what they are doing now.

It seems the last ep will be the attack on the Wall. They could stay very tight yet switch from north to south especially if they center the setting on the Wall or on Jon POV. But they could also vary POVs. Blackwater ep wasn't one long battle scene set on one  place. It was broken up by scenes in Maegors Holdfast and other castle scenes, battle sites moved from big ships to landing craft in the  water to landing to the city walls and castle wall top and bottom.

Aside from that the only other nitpick I have is with the curious way Tywin says King Robert to Tommen, and not your father when discussing strength in his what makes a good king question to Tommen. Is this implying that Tommen even knows that Jamie is his father and not Robert? Or is it that Tywin carefully choose his words that way so as not to directly lie to the new king (in a sept no less)? I'd like to think it's the second and not the first.

Â 
Jon is taking a small group of NW to Craster's to take out the mutineers. E4 is him gathering the recruits to go and arguing with Thorne about it, E5 will be the actual attack with him fighting Karl himself. E6 he'll probably sit out while he heads back to CB offscreen and E7 and E8 will be about him convincing the NW at Castle Black how big the Wildling threat actually is as well as preparing the people there for the battle. During this time, they'll get word of Tormund/Ygritte's attack on Mole's Town (which takes place in E7 or E8) because we've seen a scene with he and Sam discussing Ygritte and whether she was someone who Jon could convince to turn on the Wildlings with Jon telling Sam that the ship has sailed on that possibility. At some point this season, Locke will show up at the Wall to interact with Jon but we don't really know in what capacity and if he's there for the final battle.
Â 
E9 will have the entire episode dedicated to the simultaneous attacks and will climax with Stannis' arrival to save the day.
Â 
In terms of the logic of the simultaneous attacks, the show has set up this strategy from the start with Mance telling Tormund to wait until Mance had his army in position and that the signal would be him lighting the biggest fire the North has ever seen.Â  Logistically, it makes more sense for the Wildlings to hit them with their full force at the same time in order to provide the maximum amount of chaos. It was revealed in the last episode that the Wildlings in the south have orders to just generally wreak havoc in the nearby villages in order to try and draw out the NW from Castle Black and spread them thinner (something the NW aren't falling for). They're stalling until Mance gets his army into place. From the trailers, it looks like the Mole's Town raid is pretty brutal and we know that Gilly is there now too so she'll probably be put in danger during that attack.

Â 
Tywin is an intelligent man, I have no doubts that he knows King Robert is not Tommens father. However he's never going to say any such thing allowed because that will mean the end of the Lannisters reign on the throne. But I did love the scene between them and the obvious taking control of the situation before Cersei could make another mess. In the previous episode when Joffrey is dying Tywin makes a beeline for Tommen. He gets in first.

Usually they refer to a 'minor' house as one withÂ few men and/or little land. Stannis said that between the 3 of them they couldn't raid a pantry.
1144	The hairy bear	2014-04-22	The closed caption confirms that the houses are indeed Peasbury, Musgood and Haigh. I'm really surprised that they used Haigh here, since being an inland house from the Riverlands and a vassal from the Freys they couldn't possibly side with Stannis. It's not a big deal, but I don't understand hy they dropped the ball on this one, as it was really easy to go through a list of Stormland houses and choose from there.
Â 
FWIW, Peasbury and Musgood are good choices.

Â 
Manpower, size of the lands, wealth, privileges... Even if the juridacal status is the same, noble houses greatly vary between them.
Â 
Compare House Webber from TSS, that could muster a couple dozen men, to House Karstark in AGOT, that brings more than three thousand men to Robb's army.

Â 
Because there's no good reason to go against the Freys, right?
1146	Formerly Tetrarch42	2014-04-22	The scene is a bit confusing actually, why would houses that between them all "couldn't raid a pantry" side with Stannis. His cause at this point seems pretty bleak - their chance of success is minimal and they have everything to lose...

Â 
Fear?
Â 
They've no doubt heard that the red witch is burning everyone these days, including relatives. As a small house that we assume is in close proximity to Dragonstone the mentality may be self-preservation rather than any belief Stannis is going to win the game of thrones.
1148	LuisDantas	2014-04-22	Stannis gives a fairly good explanation in ADWD, IIRC. Â The Lords of those Houses expect to gain favor (and lands, gold and prestige) if they are perceived as loyal to him and he is at all succesful.
Â 
Typical behavior, actually. That is how things work in the feudal system.
1149	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-22	"the men they bring wouldnt be enough to rade a pantry" such a great line
1150	Dain Storm	2014-04-22	Lord Robin Peasbury is actually up north with Stannis in ADWD. House Haigh's mention is odd.

Â Well, it they are that small and weak, they have less to lose. Perhaps they were once much stronger houses with more land who feel cheated, and want to claim back everything they once had.
1152	Fat Trell	2014-04-22	Would have been nice to hear a Velaryon mention here. Pretty important house that canonically did side with Stannis.
1153	Veltigar	2014-04-22	I also wondered about something else. Who the fuck was "King Orys' who got slain by his brother? Was that Aenys?
1154	Ice Wolf	2014-04-22	I also wondered about something else. Who the fuck was "King Orys' who got slain by his brother? Was that Aenys?


Â 
That seems to be the general consensus - Orys is a replacement for Aenys who was rumoured to be killed by his brother Maegor the Cruel.
1155	IlAovatar	2014-04-22	I wondered if House Haigh may actually have been House Hasty of the Stormlands, with Davos either mispronouncing it or being cut off by Stannis before he could say the "stee" part. Rewatching the scene though, he definitely appears to say House Haigh.

Â 
Stannis repeats the name after Davos, and the subtitles confirm it. It's House Haigh. A stupid mistake that the producers could have easily avoided. It's a minor thing, but I would like someone to ask about that to Bryan Cogman in some interview.
Â 
Â

Â 
Aenys reigned for five years, not one. My guess is that the writers decided to make up a king of one of the ancient even Kingdoms, and re-used the name Orys. Not the greatest choice, also: picking Tristifer or Mern would have made more sense.

Perhaps, he'll spin it as "the Haighs did not like what the Freys did during the RW" Â and therefore they want to fight for Stannis.

Now, a Tristifer mention that would have been cool. They could have substituted Robert with Tristifer IV with a few tweakings.

The length of his reign is really not that important.Â  Given that Tywin was otherwise mentioning only kings of the Seven Kingdoms, and the writers used a name associated with Valyria, it's far more logical to assume he was supposed to be a Targaryen king.
1164	mankytoes	2014-04-23	House Haigh
House Haigh is a knightly house from the Riverlands, andÂ a vassal house of House Frey.


Â 
Ah, that makes sense, probably saying that they were so outraged by the Red Wedding they joined the only other current claimant in Westeros.
1165	colleen33408	2014-09-28	This little exchange bothered me a bit, because sometimes the writers just go off-script for no apparent reason other than lack of attention to detail..
Â 
House Peasebury, yes, they were followers of Stannis in the books, and House Musgood is likely as a house from the Stormlands.Â  I don't see Stannis pooh-poohing either as they are both noble houses.Â  He could not have expected one of the great houses to align with him.
Â 
As for House Haigh, as vassals of House Frey, it is highly unlikely they would have the ability to declare for Stannis.Â  Their lands would be confiscated by the Freys and/or the Throne.Â  The Riverlands have been secured by the Throne, Martin made a point that Blackwood was the last house in defiance. Not to mention that House Haigh has been shown in support of the Freys and Lannisters in the books. Â  And yes, they would be a small minor house worth of scoffing anyway.
1166	Beric175	2014-09-30	I kinda laughed when he said 'they don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry'.
1167	JonBranRickon	2014-10-01	I can give two reasons;
Â 
1) the follow the Lord of Light
2) Promises of more land and power (upjump)
1168	Whipsy	2014-04-25	Now, I don't want to start another Jaime the Rapist thread as I am sure that has been beaten to death by this point but I do want to discuss why D&D continuously cast Cersei in a kinder light. I understand that they do the same thing with Tyrion's character but it seems more jarring to me with Cersei since for the most part she is described as rather villainous. First there was her conversation with Robert about "Loving him even after they lost their first child". What a load. And then her boo-hooing over her child's insanity and having Joffery order the killing of the bastards instead and now this rape thing. Will they continue to try to make the audience feel sorry for her even as the story progresses?

1169	Steve Stark	2014-04-26	I hear you. She is probably the most hated character (of mine) in the books, but in the show she is definitely not as much of an evil bitch. They gave her that motherly aspect, and the scene in the first season of her and Robert really helped everyone "understand" her and why she was the way she turned out. It basically gave her an excuse. I actually thought the scene was really well done, and enjoyed it. But at the same time it affected her character's development (at least when compared to the books).
Â 
I'm over it though. I know they change things for one reason or another in the show, and I just take it for what it is. I enjoy both the show and the books for different reasons, although the portrayal of many characters are quite different between mediums. The characters will always be how I imagined them in the books (for me), but the show is by no means bad entertainment.
1170	BlackTalon	2014-04-26	Some characters in the show are just greyer than in the books, others are not (coughTyrioncough). I kind of like it, that way even the bookreaders can't really tell what certain characterts will do and for what reasons. I think that people who want a 100 percent one-to-one adaption never consider how boring that would be.
1171	Dofs	2014-04-26	Yeah, now I think showCersei is as similar to bookCersei as showShae is similar to her book version. They are completely different people. But it does not bother me, really. I know that the book versions are the real ones and the show is just two people's adaptation biased by their vision. I still like the show but I am not treating it seriously really. I did not start liking Jaime any less because he raped Cersei in the show. And I did not start liking Cersei any more because she is portrayed as a victim. Although some decision of D&D are making me conscious that the writers exist.
1172	Annara Snow	2014-04-26	Now, I don't want to start another Jamie the Rapist thread as I am sure that has been beaten to death by this point but I do want to discuss why D&D continuously cast Cersei in a kinder light.

Â 
What especially irritates me is that they seem to think that a female character will only be more "likable" if she's stripped of any agency and power and portrayed as a victim instead of someone who makes her own choices.
Â 
I hate when people say that show!Cersei is "more complex" than book!Cersei or that book!Cersei is "one-dimensional". No, she is not. Book!Cersei is a villain, and she's also been a victim (as a woman, she had no choice in who she was going to marry, married off to a stranger as a broodmare in political marriage, sexually and physically abused by Robert) but she's also an unrepentant murderer and abuser herself and has no empathy for people who are in a similar position as she is; she can be hateful, pitiable, unintentionally and sometimes even intentionally funny.
Â 
But what I like about book!Cersei is that she makes her own choices: she wasn't able to decide who she would marry, but she chooses whose children she'll have; she doesn't try to be a 'good wife' to Robert who is a bad husband to her; she aborts his baby (instead of some sob story in which she lost her baby and then it all went bad, she actually made a choice); she commits murders herself, and isn't just Joffrey's powerless mother who whines that she can't control him (it usually doesn't seem like she even tries to control him); she has sex with her brother in the sept next to her dead son's body because she chooses to, because "she's as hungry for him as he is for her" (GRRM about the book scene); she never felt guilty about her sexual relationship with her twin brother (as she does in the show), which she's been having since they were kids, she was just worried about getting caught.
Â 
Why does Cersei have to (what D&D see as) "likable"? Why can't she be a strong, interesting villain/antagonist/character, who makes her choices and does what she wants? People enjoy male villains who are ruthless and make their choices and do what they want. Why can't there be a female villain who does just that?
Â 
Furthermore, why does she have to be initially in love with her husband that she never chose or try to be a good wife to him, or wonder "if they ever had a chance"? (Unpopular opinion: I always disliked that Cersei/Robert scene because I found it OOC for her and incongruous with the rest of their interactions in the show, not just the book.) What's D&D's obsession with making every female character try to be a good wife/try to "give a chance" to a bad marriage (even if they don't in the book)? Why is that required to make a character more "likable"? Why change the abortion to stillbirth - to make her more 'likable' in the eyes of the anti-abortionists? I guess we should be relieved that they didn't make her relationship with Jaime all about Jaime raping her, in order for her to be more 'likable' to the moral brigade viewers! 
Â 
It's not like they only do it with Cersei, who is a villain - they've systematically stripped Sansa of even those moments of agency and stuff she actively does that she has in the books.
Â 
That's, of course, if the rape is supposed to make the viewers sorry for Cersei. Maybe they wanted us to think that she "deserved" it, which is even worse. OK, maybe it's unfair to accuse them of that. But it sucks when you have to choose between two sexist explanations.
1173	jons nissa	2014-04-26	i'm wondering if d&d tend to be really heavy handed with the character depictions so that when the character evolves, it's more "visible". dany starts off her marriage with drogo more negatively than in the books to make her move toward more positive more dramatic. i think that's what's happening with tyrion and jon as well. is that what's happening with cersei now that she makes the turn toward insanity?

Â 
I agree. They simplify the characterization with a higher contrast between the good and the evil of each character. This may sound repetitive, but in some cases it may not be such a bad idea given the difficulty that non-readers have in tracking so many characters, let alone having the deep understanding that some readers have of those characters. They want to portray a subset of story lines and traits of each character, omitting everything else. Compared to other shows, GoT has too many characters to allow a strong development of each of them.

1175	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-26	The thing that bugs me about the show's portrayal of Cersei is that by stripping her nastier behaviors, they've also stripped a lot of her agency -- her ability and willingness to try to be a real force and make things go her way.Â  Yes, this works out badly in the books because she's not a good person and she's not all that bright, but at least she's a mover and shaker.Â  Show!Cersei is far more passive and wounded and generally weaker.Â 
Â 
This is no insult to LH who I enjoy, but just to the portrayal of Cersei as some kind of victim.Â  In the book, Cersei was apparently born a psychopath who killed her playmate at age 10 years old because she didn't like her playmate crushing on her brother....that is not a sympathetic person.Â  But women can be evil psychopaths too, why not?Â  A world that has Gregor Clegane and Ramsay Snow has room for Cersei Lannister as well.Â  Is the idea that women can't be powerful and evil or something?
Â 
The same thing goes for Shae. In the book she's a scheming golddigger without loyalty.Â  Women like that exist, so why shouldn't Shae be one of them?
Â 
I'm trying hard here to find a single portrayal in the show of a woman who's just a bad person,Â  and I'm failing.Â  It kind of feels to me like what they call "positive sexism", which is the habit some men have of restricting women's choices on the grounds that women are "pure and noble creatures who must be protected from all the evils of the world because they are inherently better beings than men."Â  That's hogwash. Women aren't better than -- or worse than -- men.Â  They have, or should have, all the choices of behavior and personality that men have, including the bad ones.Â 
Â 
Cersei in the book was a woman who decided she wasn't going to have Robert's kids, and she took action to make sure that didn't happen. Show!Cersei apparently tried to be a good wife but was blocked in this by Robert's inability to love any woman who wasn't Lyanna. Cersei in the book was a woman who slaughtered the children of other women because her husband had cheated on her with them -- she wanted revenge and by God she got it, even if innocents died.Â  Book Cersei is evil and she is active. Show Cersei is just kind of ...sigh...passive and pathetic.

Â 

It did not take him long to start playing with her again. As soon as Cersei closed her eyes, the king would steal off to console the poor lonely creature. One night she had Jaime follow him, to confirm her suspicions. When her brother returned he asked her if she wanted Robert dead. â<U+0080><U+009C>No,â<U+0080><U+009D> she had replied, â<U+0080><U+009C>I want him horned.â<U+0080><U+009D> She liked to think that was the night when Joffrey was conceived.

Â 
Â 


Â 
Sorry for snipping your post, I had to to quote it, but it's absolutely perfect and everything I think of show!Cersei.
Â 
I'm absolutely fascinated by book!Cersei, she's such a complex character with lots of dualities. She's an abuser who's been abused, and someone who's constantly striving for independence and power. No, she isn't particularly likeable and she's very hard to sympathise with at times, and that's why I find it so surprising when I manage to connect with her. And I love that she's such a dynamic character, in the books she never sits around and wait like in the show; when she's locked in a cell unable to do anything she goes mental. She's fierce, she wants the weather to match her rage. All of this is lost in the show for a sob story and a lot of sitting around.
Â 
As offensive as the rape scene was, and as bad as it was for Jaime, it's such a disservice to Cersei as well. Sex is a weapon to her, at this point in the story she should have built a following of dudes/women she had enticed however she could, we should see her seducing and machinating. Her sexuality is completely stripped from her, as if it were something she finds shameful. Show!Cersei is a woobie, book!Cersei is truly complex.
Â 
Â

Â 
I don't think book!Cersei ever loved Robert, she was hurt that he didn't want her. She didn't want him either, but it was like how dare HE not want her, if I'm making any sense.

Â 
I have a similar impression. And I also think that this is not only due to the amount of characters but also due to the different medium of TV compared to a book. In the books you can describe the characters however you want to but I think no matter how good the actor is, there is a certain degree of charisma that is just hard to overcome completly, when you actually watch a "real" person on the screen. In the last years there have been quiet some "villains" that were portrayed on the screen andÂ  I remember with Breaking Bad for example the people making the show have stated several times that they sort of wondered how far they can go with making a character more evil without losing sympathy for the character and were surprised how far they could actually go.
So I think keeping up a constant "greyness" might be more difficult on screen just because I think people then tend to "whitewash" the characters for themself (I see it with myself somehow as even I hate Ramsay less on the show, just because I sort of enjoy the actor and how he displays the character), so maybe keeping the characters a little more "white" makes the "black" moment stand out a little more.
Â 
That's why I do agree on Cersei and as someone who really enjoys her chapters in the book (and the more messed up she is the better  ) it's somehow a pity she has been more passive in the show so far, but I see her great "bad" moments still coming (as it is also the case for Tyrion) so I still have hope that she is gonna get there eventually.
1179	IlAovatar	2014-04-26	I don't really see the show painting her as a victim. I think they're just a bit more subtle about presenting her devious nature. Too subtle at times perhaps, as demonstrated by the reactions to last week's episode.

It's not like they only do it with Cersei, who is a villain - they've systematically stripped Sansa of even those moments of agency and stuff she actively does that she has in the books.
Â 
That's, of course, if the rape is supposed to make the viewers sorry for Cersei. Maybe they wanted us to think that she "deserved" it, which is even worse. OK, maybe it's unfair to accuse them of that. But it sucks when you have to choose between two sexist explanations.


Exactly what I was getting at. It's not so much that she's portrayed as nicer but the fact that in doing so you lose a lot of her character. In my opinion, Cersei's chapters are so great to read becauseÂ it shows how bat shit and manipulative she is. Gray characters are definitely more interesting to watch but I think they are doing more white-washing than actual graying, and the argument that she would be boring if she was portrayed as evil in the books is not something I can really get behind because they didn't white-wash Ramsay and Joffery and certainly not Jamie and they are still interesting characters in the show. I realizes choices have to be made in editing for time constraints and such but if that was the case and they didn't have enough time to show the true depths of a character and instead shoot for making them more of a caricature for the audience why not just take her more in the direction she actually is and make her flat out evil? Ramsay is, so you can't tell me it doesn't work. Instead, as Rill Redthorn said, since she's a woman she can't possibly be as demented as her male counterparts, thus we have scenes that portray her as a girl who's just trying to do the best with the situation she's in. As if the bitch doesn't cause the majority of her own problems.Â 
Â 
Side note: It's not to say I don't appreciate LH's acting or the work that has to be put forth to adapt a book to screen. I'm sure I wouldn't be able to do a better job. This is just something that's been personally bugging me since season 1.

Â 
Well, we have not really reached the moment in the story where the books start to tell the story from her POV so that for me is when it starts to be more intersting if and how they manage to turn the crazyness up. Basically after Tywin gets out of the picture I hope to see more of bookCersei. That's the point when I would really mind.
1182	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-26	Now, I don't want to start another Jamie the Rapist thread as I am sure that has been beaten to death by this point but I do want to discuss why D&D continuously cast Cersei in a kinder light. I understand that they do the same thing with Tyrion's character but it seems more jarring to me with Cersei since for the most part she is described as rather villainous. First there was her conversation with Robert about "Loving him even after they lost their first child". What a load. And then her boo-hooing over her child's insanity and having Joffery order the killing of the bastards instead and now this rape thing. Will they continue to try to make the audience feel sorry for her even as the story progresses?


Â  She's portrayed a little more grey in the show, but she's still an evil witch. She's hardly portrayed as a victim. I actually like the depth her character is given on the show.

I hope you and the other people who have mentioned this are absolutely right. I can't pretend that I know where the show is going with everything and maybe there are just trying to make Cersei's descent into madness more dramatic for the audience. I hope this is true. I really do. Â
1184	jons nissa	2014-04-26	Â 
I don't think book!Cersei ever loved Robert, she was hurt that he didn't want her. She didn't want him either, but it was like how dare HE not want her, if I'm making any sense.


Â 
she did want him when they were just about to be married. she states how tall and handsome he was and the text has wording about her initial attraction although i don't have my books with me. again, she was prepared to be a good wife (as much as is possible with cersei) but robert's actions change her attitude and curb her enthusiasm.
Â 
someone posted that she is attracted to power and when robert is fresh from the rebellion, it's dripping off him. but as he becomes the fat drunk we meet in the first book, what little attraction there was, died. i think that, coupled with his obsession with other women, killed any chance of a good relationship between the two.

I always took it as she was in love with the attention and the crowd of adoring fans and not so much that she was super happy about marrying Robert. I believe she would have tried to be a dutiful wife at the start because that is what being Queen seems to entail but Robert being the drunkard he was and calling out Lyanna's name on their wedding night probably killed whatever sense of duty she had to him. She didn't know him before their wedding so I doubt she loved anything about him except the attention and praise he brought but their wedding night killed even that so she never had a chance to develop love, but it wasn't there from the get-go I don't believe. Of course, I also don't have my books so I could be wrong. Happened before.Â

Â 
No, I don't agree she was prepared to be a good wife, there's no evidence of that in the books; she had sex with Jaime on the morning of her wedding, that doesn't sound like being prepared to do anything. She was maybe somewhat attracted to Robert, although she was pissed at Tywin for marrying her to him, but that doesn't mean she loved him or wanted it to work.
Â 
Maybe describing her as a victim in the show is stretch, although after the last episode she most certainly is. The point is that she's been made passive, all agency stripped from her; her questionable/evil deeds were given to Joffrey, some scrapped completely, her manipulation hidden, and all of that has been replaced with... a lot of moping and doing nothing.

Â 
perhaps by good wife you think i mean love him to bits. no, cersei never loved him to bits. she didn't love anyone to bits. yes, she slept with jaime and again that can be and should be used against her. however, when she married robert, she did not have any elaborate plans that we are told of. we are told that she is more than willing to perform her wifely duties, and it is from this that i say she was prepared to be a good wife since in westeros, all that was expected of high born women was heirs. she continued to do her wifely duties for a while until she gets proof of robert's infidelity. that's when things change. i'll add some quotes when i get my books.Â 
Â 
as for being pissed at tywin for marrying her, you seem to be mixing up the timelines. at the time of the wedding, it's obvious there is no better match and she is not pissed however later on she definitely complains about be a broodmare.Â

She always resented him for killing Rhaegar, who she was infatuated with since she was 10 and wanted to marry.

Â 
She does mention she was happy for a moment when she saw people cheering - but yeah, that seems to have been all about the adoration of the crowd and being a queen, not with Robert himself - and her happiness was short-lived, it only lasted until she saw Jaime's expression.
Â 
And yep, she fucked Jaime on the morning before the wedding, though that may have been planned as a goodbye sex, since she doesn't seem to have done it again until Robert knocked up the Florent girl and she told Jaime she wanted Robert horned. But I don't get the impression that Cersei was ever "dutiful", not in the sense "it's my sacred duty to be a good wife". She never seems to feel guilty about anything in the books (contrary to show!Cersei's speech about Joff being the punishment for her and Jaime's sins - book!Cersei adores Joffrey and doesn't feel guilty for her relationship with Jaime), she just doesn't want to be found out. Her problem with her relationship with Jaime is "Father might find out", not "it's morally wrong/sinful".

No, I don't mean love, I mean that by having sex with Jaime on the morning of her wedding she didn't display any particular interest in being a "dutiful" wife.Â

Â 
I don't remember that ever being stated though... I think it's safe to assume she and Jaime never stopped in the books.
Â 
In the show is a mess though, because Cersei was in love with Robert, and she was so in love even he could tell ("I felt something for you once, for quite some time" "I know" looking ashamed by himself). It doesn't explain how the Jaime thing even fit in thatÂ

Â 
"More than willing to perform her wifely duties"?! Hardly, judging by these quotes:
Â 
Â Cersei wondered what it would feel like to kiss another woman. Not lightly on the cheek, as was common courtesy amongst ladies of high birth, but full upon the lips. Taenaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lips were very full. She wondered what it would feel like to suckle on those breasts, to lay the Myrish woman on her back and push her legs apart and use her as a man would use her, the way Robert would use her when the drink was in him, and she was unable to bring him off with hand or mouth.
Â 
Those had been the worst nights, lying helpless underneath him as he took his pleasure, stinking of wine and grunting like a boar. Usually he rolled off and went to sleep as soon as it was done, and was snoring before his seed could dry upon her thighs. She was always sore afterward, raw between the legs, her breasts painful from the mauling he would give them. The only time heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d ever made her wet was on their wedding night.
Â 
Robert had been handsome enough when they first married, tall and strong and powerful, but his hair was black and heavy, thick on his chest and coarse around his sex. The wrong man came back from the Trident, the queen would sometimes think as he was plowing her. In the first few years, when he mounted her more often, she would close her eyes and pretend that he was Rhaegar. She could not pretend that he was Jaime; he was too different, too unfamiliar. Even the smell of him was wrong.
Â 
For Robert, those nights never happened. Come morning he remembered nothing, or so he would have had her believe. Once, during the first year of their marriage, Cersei had voiced her displeasure the next day. â<U+0080><U+009C>You hurt me,â<U+0080><U+009D> she complained. He had the grace to look ashamed. â<U+0080><U+009C>It was not me, my lady,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said in a sulky sullen tone, like a child caught stealing apple cakes from the kitchen. â<U+0080><U+009C>It was the wine. I drink too much wine.â<U+0080><U+009D> To wash down his admission, he reached for his horn of ale. As he raised it to his mouth, she smashed her own horn in his face, so hard she chipped a tooth. Years later at a feast, she heard him telling a serving wench how heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d cracked the tooth in a mAalA©e. Well, our marriage was a mAalA©e, she reflected, so he did not lie.
The rest had all been lies, though. He did remember what he did to her at night, she was convinced of that. She could see it in his eyes. He only pretended to forget; it was easier to do that than to face his shame. Deep down Robert Baratheon was a coward. In time the assaults did grow less frequent. During the first year he took her at least once a fortnight; by the end it was not even once a year. He never stopped completely, though. Sooner or later there would always come a night when he would drink too much and want to claim his rights. What shamed him in the light of day gave him pleasure in the darkness.
Â 
She only states that he was tall and handsome enough - objectively, but.. (as Benjen said in the show, "my brother told me that nothing someone says before the word 'but..' actually counts") she apparently never personally found him attractive (she disliked his hairiness, tried to pretend that he was Rhaegar, he never got her wet other than their wedding day - and one doesn't even have to be particularly attracted to someone for the physical touch in the right places to make them aroused, so that's not evidence of a real attraction).

I can't believe I forgot to mention Rhaegar in my post since that is such a key factor in how she feels about Robert.
Â 
Also, the show really lays the whole "at least she loves her children" thing on thick. I think that she did love (or as close as she comes to doing that) and favor Joffrey because he was a great little psycho in the making Â but when it comes to Myrcella and Tommen they seem an afterthought and at times she really looks down on Tommen and his lacking of the same "qualities" that Joffrey had. I'm sure she cares for them more than any of the other people in the world but I wouldn't call it some great motherly love. I do not believe she is capable of that.
1193	SeventySeven	2014-04-26	She loves her children in the books as well, but it's a Cersei kind of love so it's all fucked up. She's desperate when she loses Joff though, and she has ambivalent feelings that swing between being annoyed by Tommen and wanting to defend him.Â
1194	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-26	Cersei in books is the kind of feminism I personally don't like: "omg, the society is mean to me so, that gives me right to do everything I want now I have the power (power that I didn't acquire on my own but was given to me by daddy and hubby) I'll show them what a woman is able to do!".
Â 
And then she fucked up everything.
Â 
She's not a victim: she's part of a society that also includes Cat, Dany, the Mormont women, Olenna, Margaery and many others. She's mean, vengeful and poorly prepared to rule. She ruined her older son and she's on the road to spoil another one: Joffrey wasn't what he was because he slipped out of her controlÂ  but because she allowed him to do everything he wanted to, something that the show is so keen on showing.

examples of cersei fulfilling her wifely duties


Â 
thanks for that. as i've mentioned i don't have my books right now. yes, she definitely willingly did her duty for a while. and yes, she stopped. right after she got proof that robert was sleeping with other women. and yes, she came to hate him, especially after he called her lyanna in bed but it was different before that. by no means was it an unending love but she was very eager and willing to marry robert since he was the nation's hero and new king which would allow her to become queen of westeros. which is the point i'm making.

Â 
True, I think this could be a better way to describe it. It's definitely not a healthy maternal love though. I still think that Joffrey was probably her favorite of the three in spite of if not because of his reprehensible qualities and while a lot of it was grief I also think that parts of the prophecy being filled also started her on her desperate track.Â

Â 
Being sexually abused is "performing her wifely duties"?  Or as you first put it "being more than willing to perform her wifely duties"?!
Â 
WTF??
Â 
And how does resenting Robert for killing Rhaegar and wishing that it had been the other way round become "being eager and willing to marry Robert since he was the nation's hero"?

they hardly say she wasn't. they state she wasn't happy but she definitely does her duty. and willingly. robert may have been a brute about it but she doesn't stop doing her duty or begin to trick him until they are at that castle and jaime follows him. not sure why we're expecting these two to be spouting love poems to one another as proof that they were willing to do what they had to do. too much of a modern lens being used here.Â

Â 
Uh, that's not any kind of feminism. Cersei is a "feminist" in the way that Baelish is a believer in equal opportunities for everyone.
Â 
Feminism is about the rights of women - all women - and equality of the two genders.Â  Cersei only wants to have the same rights as men herself - because she thinks she is a special snowflake. She doesn't think that other women should have the same rights - no, she despises or hates them and subjects them to the same kind of abuse that she resents when it's directed against herself. (Her own daughter is the only exception - she gets upset about Myrcella being shipped off to Dorne, but look at everything she did to Sansa. She also gives her handmaidens and other women to Qyburn, tries to frame Margaery [and then only feels it's unjust when she herself gets subjected to that treatment], thinks that the septas could do with a bit of rape, has no empathy for Lollys. etc.) She is a very misogynistic character.

Â 
Exactly.
Â 
Some people have a very strange definition of 'willing'. Basically, as long as she doesn't take a knife and cut his throat when he comes to her bed (which would mean being executed for regicide, BTW), she's "willing"?

Â 
Also, ITA with your first post.
Â 
Honestly, the way things have been up until now, it can go down two ways :
Â 
1) they keep whitewashing her
2) they make her characterization spin all of the sudden (somehow triggerd by Joff's death), which is terrible since she's just been raped (thanks again guys)Â and had all this crap thrown at her, and they expect the audience to accept her newfound evilness ? Either people won't buy it, or (I fear it) they'll say she had it coming.
1204	go joff go	2014-04-26	Eh I think show cersei is better than book cersei, whose motivations once revealed see idiotic,beyond idiotic. Â Grrm wanted fans to have the same sympathetic reactions they had to Jamie and theon, and failed because of those motivation. Cersei makes more sense as a visibly abused woman. I loved that in season one and two they indirectly compared arya and cersei, first when Ned said arya would Mary a Lord, and then when tywin says arya is like his daughter. Do we think arya would have been such a pleasant person if she had been put in cersei situation. I think the show has done a better job of making cersei (and littlefinger) real people.
1205	digiFemme	2014-04-27	Â 
What especially irritates me is that they seem to think that a female character will only be more "likable" if she's stripped of any agency and power and portrayed as a victim instead of someone who makes her own choices.
Â 
I hate when people say that show!Cersei is "more complex" than book!Cersei or that book!Cersei is "one-dimensional". No, she is not. Book!Cersei is a villain, and she's also been a victim (as a woman, she had no choice in who she was going to marry, married off to a stranger as a broodmare in political marriage, sexually and physically abused by Robert) but she's also an unrepentant murderer and abuser herself and has no empathy for people who are in a similar position as she is; she can be hateful, pitiable, unintentionally and sometimes even intentionally funny.
Â 
But what I like about book!Cersei is that she makes her own choices: she wasn't able to decide who she would marry, but she chooses whose children she'll have; she doesn't try to be a 'good wife' to Robert who is a bad husband to her; she aborts his baby (instead of some sob story in which she lost her baby and then it all went bad, she actually made a choice); she commits murders herself, and isn't just Joffrey's powerless mother who whines that she can't control him (it usually doesn't seem like she even tries to control him); she has sex with her brother in the sept next to her dead son's body because she chooses to, because "she's as hungry for him as he is for her" (GRRM about the book scene); she never felt guilty about her sexual relationship with her twin brother (as she does in the show), which she's been having since they were kids, she was just worried about getting caught.
Â 
Why does Cersei have to (what D&D see as) "likable"? Why can't she be a strong, interesting villain/antagonist/character, who makes her choices and does what she wants? People enjoy male villains who are ruthless and make their choices and do what they want. Why can't there be a female villain who does just that?
Â 
Furthermore, why does she have to be initially in love with her husband that she never chose or try to be a good wife to him, or wonder "if they ever had a chance"? (Unpopular opinion: I always disliked that Cersei/Robert scene because I found it OOC for her and incongruous with the rest of their interactions in the show, not just the book.) What's D&D's obsession with making every female character try to be a good wife/try to "give a chance" to a bad marriage (even if they don't in the book)? Why is that required to make a character more "likable"? Why change the abortion to stillbirth - to make her more 'likable' in the eyes of the anti-abortionists? I guess we should be relieved that they didn't make her relationship with Jaime all about Jaime raping her, in order for her to be more 'likable' to the moral brigade viewers! 


Â 
Â 
Your views on Cersei are similar to mine. Unfortunately, plenty of people don't seem to get that a character can be both a victim and a villain. There are monsters like Ramsay and the Mountain who are worse than Cersei is, and there are characters like Jaime and the Hound in the other end. She probably fits somewhere in between along with Littlefinger, Stannis and Mel but not in the same level. I also dislike it when people say that her portrayal in the books is sexist simply because she isn't as sympathetic as her show counterpart. Where does this come from? As if having a nasty female character is an injustice when there are plenty of male characters far worse and even less developed.
Â 
I think what makes Cersei's arc an interesting read is how irrational she is. Her nastiness wasn't what made her actions frustrating for me, nor was her ambition. Being ambitious isn't a bad thing for any person, nor was it presented in a bad light in the story as seen through characters like Dany, Asha, etc. It was her irrationality and fears which led her to do things which hurt not only others but herself. I saw it in the beginning when Lady was executed. While I understand a mother's wanting punishment on behalf of her son, they didn't even get the right direwolf. The one who bit Joff was still out there, forming her own pack and presumably biting anyone she pleased. But Cersei acted like Lady's death was a small victory when logically, she ought to have been angry that the real culprit got away.
Â 
Later, she got paranoid that the Tyrells were out to usurp her family but forming alliances through marriage was a way of life in Westeros , even Tywin knew and valued its importance. As a woman, the only way to prevent this is to change the system (which I presume is what Dany is trying to do), but Cersei's method was to remove any queen her sons married and thereby lose whatever allies her family had. When Joffrey was poisoned, she thought Tyrion was to blame (when it wasn't- why would he be stupid enough to commit regicide at the very gathering where he was mocked by the king, not to mention the exact moment when he held the poisoned cup?) Â When Tywin was killed later on she thought it was the Tyrells (never mind that she was shown the exact passageway and cubby hole that only a certain person of short stature who just escaped could fit in- but, no it's the Tyrells!) Later, at a meeting when they are finally discussing someone she ought to be paranoid about (Dany and the dragons) she's not paying attention and only thinks to eliminate Margaery.Â 
Â 
That's what's frustrating and fascinating about her character arc- her lack of logic.Â I actually like show Cersei and don't mind how they softened her up but they seem to have gone overboard in making her a victim with this latest episode- hopefully they're not going to make her descent a simple result of being Jaime's victim. It's way too simple.
Â 
Â 



Â 
It's not like they only do it with Cersei, who is a villain - they've systematically stripped Sansa of even those moments of agency and stuff she actively does that she has in the books.
Â 
That's, of course, if the rape is supposed to make the viewers sorry for Cersei. Maybe they wanted us to think that she "deserved" it, which is even worse. OK, maybe it's unfair to accuse them of that. But it sucks when you have to choose between two sexist explanations.


Â 
I feel that the show runners have good intentions but the results are sometimes lacking and not thought about enough. They present Tyrion as too much of a good guy where all the scenes which are supposed to focus on other characters become about him. Like when Sansa finds out about her family's murder at the RW it was supposed to have been about her but something about how they filmed it made it seem like Tyrion was the victim, he got hurt by Tywin and now Sansa turns away from him. Then now we have this scene with Cersei and Jaime's characterization is affected. The thing is that I find all these characters fascinating but I wish the treatment were equal. Cersei and Tyrions actors may get top billing but we are talking about an endgame in GoT and plenty of other character have important things going on in their own arcs that get stripped away.
Â
1206	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-27	I can't believe I forgot to mention Rhaegar in my post since that is such a key factor in how she feels about Robert.
Â 
Also, the show really lays the whole "at least she loves her children" thing on thick. I think that she did love (or as close as she comes to doing that) and favor Joffrey because he was a great little psycho in the making Â but when it comes to Myrcella and Tommen they seem an afterthought and at times she really looks down on Tommen and his lacking of the same "qualities" that Joffrey had. I'm sure she cares for them more than any of the other people in the world but I wouldn't call it some great motherly love. I do not believe she is capable of that.


Â 
The show focuses too much on Cersei as fiercely protective mother in my opinion.Â  I agree that book Cersei loves her children in her own fucked-up way as well, but this was just one aspect of her character. I'd wish they would have included more of her ambitious nature and how she uses her sexuality and looks to manipulate men. She is not that much of a temptress in the show. Using her beauty is her way to play the game, this is why her losing her looks is part of her downward spiral. I find book Cersei much more interesting and enjoyable as a villain than her more likeable counterpart on the show. Cersei, if portrayed according to the books has the potential to become a strong, iconic female villain, there is nothing wrong with that in my opinion, and no need to whitewash her and portray her as more sympathetic.Â  I agree with digifemme, a character can both be a victim and be a villain.

1207	SeventySeven	2014-04-27	I honestly relate with book!Cersei more because she's furious and restless, the whole depressed/cold queen doesn't work for me. The only times I felt Cersei resembled the Cersei I love was during Blackwater and during the PW, which is unsurprising as grrm was writing, and you can usually tell it's him because she becomes alive when he writes her.
Â 
I believe they changed her because they think it's easier to sympathise with a sexually repressed woman loving her children, than with a highly sexual, power hungry temptress. I don't think that the way she uses sex makes her story any less tragic than they're trying to portray in the show, if anything, it's even more compelling. I hope now they're done with victimising her they can unleash her. There's a bit in the trailers in which she says something about "the things I'll do for this family", and I hope that's a sign we're going to see her having some agency, finally.

Tbh I wouldn't take it out on them. They didn't handle it very well that is true, but it's hard for directors and actors to go against the people employing them. d&d basically left them to take the brunt of it and threw them under the bus, while they refused to answer any question. It's their show, they wrote the scene, and I'm pretty sure everything has to be approved by them before going on air.

Â 
oh i'm mad at D&D as well......... but that scene was definitely a rape on the show. and nikolaj saying it was both "rape and not rape" and alex graves saying stupid shit like "it becomes consensual at the end" is some really dangerous promotion of rape culture essentially and there have already been many articles online rightfully flaming both nikolaj and alex rightfully for doing so.Â 
Â 
I HATE what they did with that scene on the show. I don't want anyone to get raped and I don't like that tv!jaime is a rapist but if you added a rape scene on the show, then OWN up to it. saying that it isn't rape is just fucked up and gross.
1212	Beric175	2014-04-27	No meant no in tthe book too and jaime forced himself on her regardless and I feel like people excuse her coming around an consengting afterwards as an excuse foer his behavior when it has no bearing on his intent. he still wanted to have sex regardless. robert has not been able to rape her on the show so they needed to introduce that element in th absence of inner monologue and flashbacks and the only guy to do it at this stage is jaime because lancel has apparently been eaten by a dragon. She never tells anyone about it in the books so they need to introduce that element somehow and it makes more sense or her to want to emulate Jaime than Robert.
1213	Daske	2014-04-27	Why can't she be a monster and a victim? It's not likeÂ you haveÂ to be just one or the other. Pretty sure the writers would be accused of simplifying and dumbing down the character if the book & show portrayals were reversed.

Â 
For me, it's not about not showing that villains have tragic things happen to them too. No human being escapes that regardless of moral standing. It's about the fact that they're taking a lot of her villainous qualities and downplaying them or giving them to someone else. Yes, it's great to see a little bit of a victim in your villain to give them depth, but not to the point where the victim aspect overshadows the villainous oneÂ

Â 
cersei is BOTH a victim and villain in the books too. but jaime raping her destroys the very core of her character. show!cersei and book!cersei are completely different characters at this point. i think show!cersei is a great character to an extent in her own right but she is NOWHERE NEAR as complex or fascinating as book!cersei imo. the fact that people find her more complex is truly baffling to me. cersei lannister is not meant to relatable, and thats a GOOD thing because she's just so much more interesting that way
1216	jabulaniman	2014-04-27	The thing that bugs me about the show's portrayal of Cersei is that by stripping her nastier behaviors, they've also stripped a lot of her agency -- her ability and willingness to try to be a real force and make things go her way.  Yes, this works out badly in the books because she's not a good person and she's not all that bright, but at least she's a mover and shaker.  Show!Cersei is far more passive and wounded and generally weaker. 
This is no insult to LH who I enjoy, but just to the portrayal of Cersei as some kind of victim.  In the book, Cersei was apparently born a psychopath who killed her playmate at age 10 years old because she didn't like her playmate crushing on her brother....that is not a sympathetic person.  But women can be evil psychopaths too, why not?  A world that has Gregor Clegane and Ramsay Snow has room for Cersei Lannister as well.  Is the idea that women can't be powerful and evil or something?
The same thing goes for Shae. In the book she's a scheming golddigger without loyalty.  Women like that exist, so why shouldn't Shae be one of them?
I'm trying hard here to find a single portrayal in the show of a woman who's just a bad person,  and I'm failing.  It kind of feels to me like what they call "positive sexism", which is the habit some men have of restricting women's choices on the grounds that women are "pure and noble creatures who must be protected from all the evils of the world because they are inherently better beings than men."  That's hogwash. Women aren't better than -- or worse than -- men.  They have, or should have, all the choices of behavior and personality that men have, including the bad ones. 
Cersei in the book was a woman who decided she wasn't going to have Robert's kids, and she took action to make sure that didn't happen. Show!Cersei apparently tried to be a good wife but was blocked in this by Robert's inability to love any woman who wasn't Lyanna. Cersei in the book was a woman who slaughtered the children of other women because her husband had cheated on her with them -- she wanted revenge and by God she got it, even if innocents died.  Book Cersei is evil and she is active. Show Cersei is just kind of ...sigh...passive and pathetic.

This this and again this. I love GoT the show as much as the books, but I have to agree with you 100%. Even the Lena Headey bit, when you watch her interviews you can really tell she knows her stuff (atleast showCersei). In regards to the adaptations/euphorisms of female characters in the show, I guess that's on D&D. Although I did also find the idea of the easier and clearer evolutions of characters as a reason interesting and somethig to keep in mind before critisizing to much.

She asked Jaime to kill her brother just seconds beforehand and we had her acting abominably at the wedding for all of the episode before that. She has been a monster since Day 1 when she had Lady killed. Nothing that has happened to her will change the fact that sheÂ remains aÂ vile human being by most viewers' standards unless they have somehow had their memories wiped in the meantime!

Â 
Actors don't always see the final product or follow much of what happens in the editing room. For as much as we know they did their scene months ago, their job done, and may not even realize the final version has deviated much from the outcome it was supposed during filming. That's just giving them the benefit of the doubt.
Â 
The director, on the other hand, have control of the scene and should know what they are depicting.
Â 
The outcome of the scene could be changed in part by adding a redub of LH voicing a few "Yes, Jaime, take me" when Cersei and Jaime are going down.
(though it won't change the fact that it's a badly lit and somewhat missing the impact such a scene should have. Had it been more sexual it would have augmented the discomfort about to the location and situation, in the proper way, instead of falling into the lazy device of sexual violence)

OK, well we can disagree. I don't think they have done much at all to make her 'likeable'. They may have humanised her by showing her feelings occassionally, but I think it's clear she is a monster in the show, she just doesn't have to be shown doing something evil every scene.

She just lost her son, and she thinks Tyrion did it. It's hardly being a bitch, it's being human and emotional. Imo, the departures for Cersei's character have gone progressively worse, to the point all of her agency has been stripped away. Other than killing Lady and the Shae thing, she didn't do anything remotely bad. Or did anything at all, actually. Seriously, what's the last thing she's done before being mean to everyone at the PW (I thought those scenes were good, especially the Pycelle one)?
Â 
And now I read something about Cersei trying to seduce Jaime or sleeping with him after he raped her and I'm just... It's even more offensive than the rape itself, to even suggest she would entertain the idea. A part of me hoped for a moment that they would use the rape to alienate her some more and finally unleash her, but this doesn't sound like it. It's just sad. Can we not have her kick him in the balls? Because I would very much enjoy that.

Â 
I think everyone would like to kick Jaime in the balls. And even Cersei might even get a cheer from fans if she did it.
Â 
But wanting your brother to kill your other brother (who you know loves him dearly) isn't an evil act? And without even having any evidence? That's way beyond being human/emotional. It's plain horrible.
Â 
As well as ordering Lady killed she's been tormenting Sansa since the begining and slags off Tyrion at every opportunity and wishes him dead evenÂ before Joffrey died.Â She almost certainly killed her husband. And she has no problem with her son torturing and killing people. Plus she gives all wedding leftovers to the dogs rather than the starving poor justÂ because she wants to trump Marg, who I seem to remember Cersei also delivered a thinly veiled threat of murder a little while back! And she's going to have a big hand in whatever nasty way the Shae plot plays out.
Â 
I just don't see where in all this they have shown anything likeable about her at all. Except that one time where she almost mercy kills her son! Given that is the nicest thiing she has done for anyone, I think it sums her up perfectly!
Â 
My thought on the rape is that they messed up the scene. They meant to show it as consentual at the end (I think the quotes by some involved thought they had), but it wasn't clear at all. And it took a second viewing for me to realise she was saying 'it's not right' meaning doing it in the sept by the body rather than the whole thing. It's hard to argue it's still not rape given how he basically gave her no choice whatsoever, but I think there is difference enough if they had shown it how they thought they had that it does change how their dynamic could be handled afterwards. It was still aÂ very badly judgedÂ scene regardless.

1228	Ran	2014-04-28	NCW in a new interview, in Swedish, where again he reiterates they were trying to film something other than a rape. See here.Â
1229	SeventySeven	2014-04-28	What I find particularly annoying about NCW's interview is that, yes I get he can't throw his employers under the bus, but acting all butthurt because people didn't get the scene and the show was trying to convey something different isn't exactly the way to go. Regardless of what they were trying to achieve with that scene they didn't get their point across with the audience, as the vast majority (and not just fans complaining for the sake of it, major publications and critics) interpreted it differently. Now, whose fault is it if not the team behind it, that failed to convey what they meant to?
Â 
And no to the village being slaughtered and the boy being told about his parents being eaten etc as comparable at all. To even suggest means to completely miss the point of why that sort of gratuitous sexual violence is damaging in the first place. I don't expect NCW to condemn it because it's his job and he's supposed to stand by it, but he should take his own advice and not talk about it.

He's bothered that their efforts to convey a certain thing failed, and obviously that reflects poorly on their craft, on the direction and editing and writing, and ultimately on the executive producers. There's absolutely nothing wrong with his explaining what they intended, and noting that when there's a "payoff" later this season, it's going to be a payoff based on their intention and not a popular reading of the scene.
Â 
Art is not a democracy, and in any case, the episodes are all in the can. They are not capable of reshooting anything last minute to try and align it with popular opinion, so popular opinion is going to have to get used to the idea that the scene was a poorly-handled depiction of something complex rather than a brutally honest depiction of rape.

Yeah but the reason why it didn't come across the way they meant to it's on them, so I understand it might be hard to admit a failure, but I don't think they should be bothered as in frustrated with the audience who didn't get it. Maybe my impression is wrong, but it seems to me that all of them are approaching it as "you got it wrong" as opposed to "we did it wrong". Hopefully there actually is a payoff, so maybe it will make sense in context.
1232	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-28	Now, I don't want to start another Jaime the Rapist thread as I am sure that has been beaten to death by this point but I do want to discuss why D&D continuously cast Cersei in a kinder light. I understand that they do the same thing with Tyrion's character but it seems more jarring to me with Cersei since for the most part she is described as rather villainous. First there was her conversation with Robert about "Loving him even after they lost their first child". What a load. And then her boo-hooing over her child's insanity and having Joffery order the killing of the bastards instead and now this rape thing. Will they continue to try to make the audience feel sorry for her even as the story progresses?


Â 
Theyve given almost all her evil deeds to Joffrey, she had a decent relationship with Tyrion at times, she cried about losing a child she had with Robert,Â she supposedly loved Robert at one time as opposed to hating him for not being Rhaegar even, she seemed to be troubled by Joffrey behavior in the show while always making excuses for him in the books, and Jamie raped her. lol, it never ends. They whitewash her more than anything else, its really annoying.Â
1233	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-28	The thing that bugs me about the show's portrayal of Cersei is that by stripping her nastier behaviors, they've also stripped a lot of her agency -- her ability and willingness to try to be a real force and make things go her way.Â  Yes, this works out badly in the books because she's not a good person and she's not all that bright, but at least she's a mover and shaker.Â  Show!Cersei is far more passive and wounded and generally weaker.Â 
Â 
This is no insult to LH who I enjoy, but just to the portrayal of Cersei as some kind of victim.Â  In the book, Cersei was apparently born a psychopath who killed her playmate at age 10 years old because she didn't like her playmate crushing on her brother....that is not a sympathetic person.Â  But women can be evil psychopaths too, why not?Â  A world that has Gregor Clegane and Ramsay Snow has room for Cersei Lannister as well.Â  Is the idea that women can't be powerful and evil or something?
Â 
The same thing goes for Shae. In the book she's a scheming golddigger without loyalty.Â  Women like that exist, so why shouldn't Shae be one of them?
Â 
I'm trying hard here to find a single portrayal in the show of a woman who's just a bad person,Â  and I'm failing.Â  It kind of feels to me like what they call "positive sexism", which is the habit some men have of restricting women's choices on the grounds that women are "pure and noble creatures who must be protected from all the evils of the world because they are inherently better beings than men."Â  That's hogwash. Women aren't better than -- or worse than -- men.Â  They have, or should have, all the choices of behavior and personality that men have, including the bad ones.Â 
Â 
Cersei in the book was a woman who decided she wasn't going to have Robert's kids, and she took action to make sure that didn't happen. Show!Cersei apparently tried to be a good wife but was blocked in this by Robert's inability to love any woman who wasn't Lyanna. Cersei in the book was a woman who slaughtered the children of other women because her husband had cheated on her with them -- she wanted revenge and by God she got it, even if innocents died.Â  Book Cersei is evil and she is active. Show Cersei is just kind of ...sigh...passive and pathetic.


Â 
I couldnt agree more with this post. The only woman portrayed in a negative light is Selyse imo, though that is mainly because D&d go absolutely out of their way to make Stannis look bad.Â

1235	Carl Drogo	2014-04-29	I have to say I really don't get the discussion in this thread.Â 
Â 
Of course in today's day and age, any scene that played out like this one would be considered rape, period.Â  But in this setting, among these characters, I would assume that if Cersei felt she was being raped she would have and could have reacted far differently and put up much more resistance.Â  To me there was nothing in the scene to suggest, that she had a problem with the situation apart from the impropriety of the setting and to me this is a perfect reconstruction on screen of what was described in the book.Â  I don't see how anyone could understand this to make Cersei more victim and less evil in any way. Au contraire, I think it makes her more evil, because eventually it seems like she does give in and enjoy it, thus eventually letting her lust become stronger than her wish to display piety before the body of her beloved dead son.Â  And remember, in the show this was her only redeeming quality, her love for her children.Â  Show-Cersei has no reason to hate Tyrion but the fact that her mother died upon his birth, he's an ass to her in general and he sent off Myrcella to Dorne.Â  I think the Valonquar prophecy in the books gives Cersei much more of an excuse for her actions and makes her much more understandable. Which is why I don't understand they never mentioned it in the show.Â  Here her only excuse is the fact that she's had it tough with Tywin and Robert and men in general, always having to obey.

The reason I started it was the several other examples the show has already given of white-washing the character. The Jaime scene just tied in with that. As to it being rape, I don't think whether it is or not is the point. The director has already confirmed it as consensual and since the creators run the show if they say it was then it will be. The problem is the fact that the majority of people thought it was rape due to unclear editing/writing, whether you did or not, and that does change the way people, especially the unsullied, view Cersei. Still though, this thread wasn't supposed to be another discussion of that. I said that in the first line. 
Also, I have to disagree about Cersei fighting more if she was being raped. They were in a place where someone could easily walk in and putting up more of a fight would call attention. I don't think Cersei, even if she was being truly raped, would dare call undue attention to the possibility of relations between her and Jaime. Would not be worth the risk. She'd endure and wait until after to exact revenge. That's just her.

Â 

CERSEI: You know, Jaime, what you did to me at Joffrey's funeral was wrong.
JAIME: I'm sorry, sis. I just got carried away.
CERSEI: People look up to you. You are a role model for the children of the Seven Kingdoms.
JAIME: I feel very bad about it.
CERSEI: When a woman says no, it means no.
JAIME: What can I do to make it up to you?
CERSEI: I want you to hunt down Sansa Stark and bring back her head. And no more raping.
JAIME: Done. Sis, you're the greatest.

1238	Lord Voldemort	2014-04-29	I donÂ¨'t see the problem. Why is everyone (NOT Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) so butthurt about the "rape" scene? Just like he said: later in the same episode, there's a scene where a whole village gets butchered and a little boy gets told that his dead mama and papa are going to get eaten.
Â 
How is a "rape" (and to that, a rape commited by one lover against/to another) any worse than butchering a village and then eating the only surviving kid's parents?

I don't get why a few people (just a few, mind you) don't understand the difference between:

1) An act everyone agrees is wrong and terrible, like slaughter and cannibalism
2) An act like rape whose exact definition is very much a topic of current debate.
Â 
Please get this through your heads, people who are clueless:
Â 
Something that everyone agrees is wrong (or right) will not cause a controversy. Â No one disagrees about slaughter and cannibalism being bad. There is no discussion to be had.Â 
Â 
Something that people have different opinions on will cause a controversy, particularly when the issue is "Was that really a rape or not?" Â which is very much a matter of current vigorous debate.Â 
Â 
People who think that for some reason slaughter and cannibalism should be more controversial than rape are ....well, I don't want to be insulting. Let's just say they are uninformed, as in "live under rocks with no mass media." Â

1242	DasPrune2Nasty	2014-05-01	I don't think Cersei was raped.
1243	SeventySeven	2014-05-01	Â 
I think everyone would like to kick Jaime in the balls. And even Cersei might even get a cheer from fans if she did it.
Â 
But wanting your brother to kill your other brother (who you know loves him dearly) isn't an evil act? And without even having any evidence? That's way beyond being human/emotional. It's plain horrible.
Â 
As well as ordering Lady killed she's been tormenting Sansa since the begining and slags off Tyrion at every opportunity and wishes him dead evenÂ before Joffrey died.Â She almost certainly killed her husband. And she has no problem with her son torturing and killing people. Plus she gives all wedding leftovers to the dogs rather than the starving poor justÂ because she wants to trump Marg, who I seem to remember Cersei also delivered a thinly veiled threat of murder a little while back! And she's going to have a big hand in whatever nasty way the Shae plot plays out.
Â 
I just don't see where in all this they have shown anything likeable about her at all. Except that one time where she almost mercy kills her son! Given that is the nicest thiing she has done for anyone, I think it sums her up perfectly!


Â 
Oh, I just saw you replied to my post now.
Â 
BIB: I don't think it's horrible because she's grieving her son, and she does think Tyrion did it. It's not a nice thing to say that she wants him and Sansa dead obviously, but I don't believe it's that hard to imagine that a grieving mother would want to have killed the people who killed her child. I think it's human, and I've seen it in real life as well with a friend of my family who lost her son in a drunk driving accident (the other driver was drunk and got away with nothing). Some of the things she said about the guy who killed her son were not that dissimilar to Cersei, she wasn't asking for a head, but she certainly didn't wish him well.
Â 
I think that while in the show Cersei has done some not very nice stuff, she's done nothing too terrible. Tormenting Sansa was bad, but in season 3 she stopped and was somewhat concerned about Sansa (opposite of the books, where she threatens her and seems to really enjoy dragging her to get married to Tyrion), and while I loved 4x02 Cersei because she was restless in a similar way to her book counterpart, giving the food to the dogs wasn't necessarily "evil" just a bad decision based on the desire to outdo Margaery.
Â 
As I said other times, I hope they're now done with making her a woobie and let her be the fury she is in the books. I loved her chapters in affc where she tries to rule and seems so smug, yet it's all crumbling and she can't see it. I hope they get there in the show (and she needs her posse of assholes she surrounds herself with, we need Taena and the Kettleblacks, call them with a different name I don't care, but she needs those interactions!), the only issue is that since she hasn't been shown to be as power hungry as in the books, I'm not sure it will have the same impact. And I would like to stretch that I don't see the fact she's power hungry as a negative trait at all, so it really does bug me they got rid of this element, which is the strongest drive to her in the books... even more than her children.
1244	sj4iy	2014-05-01	Oh, FFS, who really thinks that Cersei has been painted as a 'victim' here? Â She had just asked her brother to kill her other brother without a trial or any evidence- people seem to be forgetting that. Â In the last episode, she ask Jaime to bring her Sansa's head. Â She's a selfish, terrible person and the show isn't making her look 'better', rape or not.

Â 

I agree with some of what you say. Although wishing death on someone you think killed your son without evidence could be more easily forgiven if she didn't have the power to actually make it happen.
Â 
Maybe I'm misremembering show canon - butÂ didn't she plan (and ultimately succedd in)Â the killing ofÂ her husband?
Â 
She definitely threatened to kill Marg if she stepped out of line.
Â 
Even if you put those aside, it's the vindictiveness and spitefullness of even her smallest actionsÂ (like the food tothe dogs) that make her such a great villain. They have nailed this in the show imo, and I think that's much more important than whether she did or didn't kill Robert's bastards for instance.

1247	LMR	2014-05-04	Re Her 'relationship' (or lack thereof) to Rheagar, if I recall correctly is barely mentioned in the show, so that could well explain why they attributed that initial affection to Robert in the the show. Whilst I agree there are significant differences between bookCersei and ShowCersei I think I get why they were do and I do think in some cases these changes are as much about how influencing how we percieve the characters around her (or rather how the show runners want us to percieve them). Her interaction with Robert has a humanising affect on him as well as her and given the more limited scope of the show manages to convey a significant amount about the Leanna back story (ie why he went to war) in a very condensed way.Â  It also made both Robert and Cersei seem more nuanced. I genuinly believed in that scene that this was a couple that had essentially been waging Cold War on each other for years and were having a moment of recognition about how they got there. It might fudge it a bit but I still feel it captures the essence of their marriage in that sense.Â  A lot of Cersei's complexity in the book would have been tough to convey on screen and the changes for screen mean that she veers away from one dimensional cartoon villain which is always a possibility when you try and convey someone as unpleasant as Cersei on screen. I also think because they aged Joffery up in the show, by transferring a lot of her misdeeds to him they were more able to put across his character and by making even Cersei appalled by much of it, it had the desired effect I feel.
1248	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-05-07	So Cersei's actress talks about -that- scene..
Warning, she's got one heck of a mouth on her.
Â 
https://www.youtube....d&v=HTfaoZPzxOU
1249	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	I can't believe everyone interprets that as a rape scene.Â  I'm quite sure the Queen Regent of the Seven Kingdoms is able to shout loud enough to get a Kingsguard's attention if she were really getting raped.Â  She was emotionally conflicted about the deed, and Jaime was definitely coming on strong, but it was more akin to a James Bond sex scene.
Â 
Every time they have sex in the series, it starts out with Cersei not exactly giving in.Â  They just both like a little force to get the juices flowing.
1250	We Pay Our Debts	2014-06-15	Â 
What especially irritates me is that they seem to think that a female character will only be more "likable" if she's stripped of any agency and power and portrayed as a victim instead of someone who makes her own choices.
Â 
I hate when people say that show!Cersei is "more complex" than book!Cersei or that book!Cersei is "one-dimensional". No, she is not. Book!Cersei is a villain, and she's also been a victim (as a woman, she had no choice in who she was going to marry, married off to a stranger as a broodmare in political marriage, sexually and physically abused by Robert) but she's also an unrepentant murderer and abuser herself and has no empathy for people who are in a similar position as she is; she can be hateful, pitiable, unintentionally and sometimes even intentionally funny.
Â 
But what I like about book!Cersei is that she makes her own choices: she wasn't able to decide who she would marry, but she chooses whose children she'll have; she doesn't try to be a 'good wife' to Robert who is a bad husband to her; she aborts his baby (instead of some sob story in which she lost her baby and then it all went bad, she actually made a choice); she commits murders herself, and isn't just Joffrey's powerless mother who whines that she can't control him (it usually doesn't seem like she even tries to control him); she has sex with her brother in the sept next to her dead son's body because she chooses to, because "she's as hungry for him as he is for her" (GRRM about the book scene); she never felt guilty about her sexual relationship with her twin brother (as she does in the show), which she's been having since they were kids, she was just worried about getting caught.
Â 
Why does Cersei have to (what D&D see as) "likable"? Why can't she be a strong, interesting villain/antagonist/character, who makes her choices and does what she wants? People enjoy male villains who are ruthless and make their choices and do what they want. Why can't there be a female villain who does just that?
Â 
Furthermore, why does she have to be initially in love with her husband that she never chose or try to be a good wife to him, or wonder "if they ever had a chance"? (Unpopular opinion: I always disliked that Cersei/Robert scene because I found it OOC for her and incongruous with the rest of their interactions in the show, not just the book.) What's D&D's obsession with making every female character try to be a good wife/try to "give a chance" to a bad marriage (even if they don't in the book)? Why is that required to make a character more "likable"? Why change the abortion to stillbirth - to make her more 'likable' in the eyes of the anti-abortionists? I guess we should be relieved that they didn't make her relationship with Jaime all about Jaime raping her, in order for her to be more 'likable' to the moral brigade viewers! 
Â 
It's not like they only do it with Cersei, who is a villain - they've systematically stripped Sansa of even those moments of agency and stuff she actively does that she has in the books.
Â 
That's, of course, if the rape is supposed to make the viewers sorry for Cersei. Maybe they wanted us to think that she "deserved" it, which is even worse. OK, maybe it's unfair to accuse them of that. But it sucks when you have to choose between two sexist explanations.


Â 
I agree. They completely declawed Cersei, and I hate it. In the books, Cersei did actually have control over Joffrey for the most part, but in the show she's just another poor female victim of evil, over-the-top Show!Joffrey. It seems as if the writers want to make every woman more 'sympathetic' and weak, really. *cough*Catelyn*cough*

I fear for the new Tommen, but he looks OK. Though I'm worried as to what he will look like 3 seasons from now. The other kid was not the best actor, but I'm pretty sure he's a bit older now and he can be better. At least he looked like an 8 year old.

1259	The Santa of House Claus	2014-04-26	They aged up every character, go of course they had to age up Tommen. Granted he looks to be like 13-14 in the show, but I'd imagine they are going to play him as 10-12, as that would fit with the roughly 3 year age up for all characters, roughly being the key word there.
1260	Roddy the Ruin	2014-04-26	They had to age up the characters, as most if not all countries have laws against portraying nude minors  in sexual situations

Yup, and to make it a little more believable/relatable. Robb and Dany are young teens in the books, seeing 14 year olds lead armies in a show, not so much.
1263	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-26	They had to age up the characters, as most if not all countries have laws against portraying nude minors in sexual situations

Yep, but Tommen had no involvement in sexual situations in the books. In fact, his lack of sexual situations with Margaery is an important plot point and I don't know how the show is going to succesfully go around it
1264	Ser Moose Daigle	2014-04-26	I get more angry that they killed that actor last season...is there really that much of a shortage of 10-12 year old actors?

About Stannis, don't get me started.Â
1267	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-26	I felt the same way. I liked Tommen's character in the book because he was so young and innocent, and had no idea what he was doing, and just laughed away as he stamped papers. The show seems like its going to portray him as older, and more aware of his surroundings. I think his character loses something in the translation.

Â  Â  Â This and don't forget what other plot points that have to be changed. The whole Dorne/Myrcella plot will be thrown off as well, because she will have to be 16ish to be older then Tommen, which is far to old for Arianne to lead around that. Ser Pounce is just the cherry, that's not there. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â
1269	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-26	I don't care about the kittens and I think Tommen's portrayal is just fine and I find it strange that people have made such a big deal over it. He's barely a presence in the books.
1270	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-26	I don't get how is this NOT a show thread. Did GRRM age Tommen in books?
Â 
On topic, what he lacks in childishness he can make up with innocence. He's not older than 13. That's my kid's age and he's definitely not ready to consummate nor rule anything. And they will probably show Cersei being super overprotective.
1271	dbunting	2014-04-26	Ok...really, Ser pounce is likely cut and that is what we complain about? The damn cats?Yeah they aged him up, they had to in order to be consistent since all the others were aged up as well.One thing to keep in mind is that they know where the story is heading, maybe they aged him up because of a scene or something that happens with him next season that audiences wouldn't want to see a 9 year old do, or have happen to them.
1272	Le Cygne	2014-04-27	Oh, great, that makes it better. Visions of what will happen to Tommen.

because tommens original actor did not age?
1274	dbunting	2014-04-27	Or maybe the original actor didn't want to act any more? Or they realized he couldn't handle actual lines? Who knows why
1275	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-27	Call it the wrong place if you want but who else was pissed that they made tommen older in the show thus no appearances from ser pounce! That really grinds my gears


Â 
New Tommen is only about a year older than old Tommen.
1276	boojam	2014-04-27	Call it the wrong place if you want but who else was pissed that they made tommen older in the show thus no appearances from ser pounce! That really grinds my gearsThe poster doth protest too much, methinks.
1277	Kasporio	2014-04-27	I dont really care they aged up Tommen, depending on the conclusion.
He's clearly 14 or 15, so pubescent and ready to fulfill his conjugal duties. And soon to be married to a 30 yo crone, he better hurry. Yeah, dont tell me tv Marg is a teen.
If the scenarists speed up the Cersei's vendetta against Marg, they could avoid the wedding.
Â 
But there was so many inefective, stupid, even disastrous plot divergence...
Ros snitching on Baelysh plan to abduct Sansa, Varys arranging her wedding to Tyrion (while it was Baelysh plan in the books), Loras marrying Cersei...Â
1278	boojam	2014-04-27	Varys arranging her wedding to TyrionWhen did this happen it's not stated in that scene who Olenna and Varys are talking about Sansa marrying.Did I miss a line of dialog on the show?
					
					
							Edited by boojam, 27 April 2014 - 10:01 AM.
1279	Seneti	2014-04-27	I get more angry that they killed that actor last season...is there really that much of a shortage of 10-12 year old actors? If they want to make it this all more believable they can't just resurrect characters that they already killed, or can they? . but seriously just get another actor, it seems cheesy...


Â 
I don't have a problem with them using the same actor. His first character was introduced and killed in a single episode, meaning most viewers won't remember his face anymore. He has the right look, the right age (compared to the other characters - they have aged up all the kids) and he's already been on the show. Makes him a perfect candidate.
Â 
Â 


On topic, what he lacks in childishness he can make up with innocence. He's not older than 13. That's my kid's age and he's definitely not ready to consummate nor rule anything. And they will probably show Cersei being super overprotective.


Â 
This. Between Margaery being overwhelmingly hot, Cersei being stalker-protective and Tommen never having had sex before, I doubt he'll be ready to consumate anything. As for Ser Pounce - you are never too old to love kittens! Also, the show seems to be setting up Tommen to be the "stamp and nod" king he was in the books, what with Tywin essentially telling him to let other people rule the country for him.
Â 


When did this happen it's not stated in that scene who Olenna and Varys are talking about Sansa marrying.
Did I miss a line of dialog on the show?


Â 
No you didn't. In one scene, Varys and Olenna hinted at marrying Sansa to Loras. In another scene Loras screws it up royally by revealing his soon-to-be secret marriage to one of Baelish's spies and Baelish goes ahead and tells Cersei. Varys had nothing to do with Sansa marrying Tyrion.
1280	Lady cut throat	2014-04-27	I didn't mind, I liked Tommen and the Tywin scene actually. He will probably have a bigger role in the show now and as someone else stated, will have to do things or have done to him that they couldn't possibly use a younger actor for.
1281	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-27	They didn't 'have to' age him up to a teenager. They could have started season 1 with a 5 year old Tommen.
1282	ground_control	2014-04-27	1) I wasn't going to reply to a show thread marked "not a show thread", but it looks like the mods weren't fooled either and moved it 
Â 
2) I think Tommen is supposed to be 13, while many 13 yr old males may be physically able to consummate a marriage, not all are, and definitely not all that physically could are mentally/socially ready, either in Westeros or the real world. Â Tywin specifically asks Tommen if any [adult] has talked to him about [sex], and he says 'no' -- he knew what Tywin was asking about, so he presumably has the "what other kids have told me" basic "factual" knowledge. Â I.e., he's old enough to be in 8th/9th grade in America, but hasn't had a sex-ed class or "talk" from his parents or the Maester.
Â 
3) I'll be surprised if not immediately consummating the marriage isn't explicitly discussed on the show -- in addition to Tommen being much too young in the books, it keeps Marg officially a virgin, and was both used against Marg (by Cersei trying to frame her) and for the Tyrells (Marg is still a virgin in case Tommen dies, Stannis wins, or the incest accusations become an issue).
Â 
4) Yes, I'll miss Ser Pounce, stamping, and beets (unless they find a way to not make Tommen look mentally underdeveloped for his new age), but as far as not jousting and Cersei being overprotective, I can see that staying in.
1283	Raffi lannister	2014-05-08	I think the changed the actor because of the bed with Magary tyrell
1284	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-17	despite the problems aging tommen might have caused (and i do think they have a plan to explain things), we still got ser pounce :DDDDDD
1285	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-20	Â Â  Is this place really safer for her than Castle Black? Or is Sam just putting her in even more danger? And will this change her future of going to Oldtown??
1286	ViennaGirl	2014-04-20	what could go wrong? living in a brothel is a way better way to avoid rape than living at Castle Black. Wait. Not.Â

1290	ViennaGirl	2014-04-20	Â

Â 
No, we've never seen Dalla. Without that plotline maybe Shireen will be the one in danger. Maybe Sam will still want to send Gilly to his family and he'll do it when he's asked to escort Aemon.

I can't imagine Mel threatening Shireen though...not yet at least. I think they'll just gloss over it...Gilly can't stay here, so you might as well carpool with Aemon too.
1292	Baltan	2014-04-20	I guess Gilly can't be around Castle Black during the battle for some weird reasons. That brothel was really lousy looking, so I can't see her staying there long. She will return to CB after the battle, probably after Jon is named LC.
Â 
I feel it's a bit late to introduce Dalla, or directly the baby and Val. It will feel out of the blue.
Â 
Mance: "Hey, I just happen to have a whole family, but in a whole season and a half nobody cared to mention them! Let me introduce you to Mrs Dalla Rayder, mother of my newborn son, her lovely sister, Val, and her pet Jarl. Oh wait, he died climbing the Wall..."
1293	Dain Storm	2014-04-20	I was wondering if Dalla would even appear in the show. Seems like they might cut the switch story.

Well aren't the Wildlings going to hit Moles Town before the battle? She may have to come back to the wall and then they decide she should go off with Sam and Aemon for her safety, rather than Mance's baby

Â I think we still have time to introduce them. It would probably be the end of this season if they switch babies, so that's 7 episodes. It may not be too sudden. Mance hasn't really been a character of much focus yet, I don't think its surprising that his family hasn't been introduced. Look how big a character Stannis is, and look how much we've seen of his wife. But if they don't introduce them in the next 4 or 5 episodes, then i'll agree with you.
1296	Le Cygne	2014-04-20	That was awful, why did they have Sam do that. Almost everyone took a hit this week. Poor Gilly.

Are they?Â  Better be raped by a hundred crows than get raped and then eaten by HBOthenns. I guess the whole point of moving her was to keep her safe, if Mole Town is a potential target of the attack, HBOSam can't be that obtuse to send her there. If they attack Mole's Town then moving Gilly was a bit of an unnecessary plot.

Yeah, that was what I meant. There were no news of these characters being casted, but we could be wrong.
Â Let's hope, I really like the sexual tension Val brings to the wall...
1299	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-04-20	They are going to do away with the baby swap storyline, so they need to come up with a motivation for Sam to take Gilly to Hornhill. Â This establishes that, Gilly can't stay at the wall, nor is she safe in Moletown, the only option Sam has is to send her to his mother.

Â  True. Its possible they were do away with this subplot altogether, although I hope not. Or maybe they'll switch Mance's baby with a cucumber. Tell me it wouldn't be funny to watchÂ Val craddle a pickle with a hat on it, andÂ everyone justÂ says "he's......uh......adorable...."...
1301	Ebethron the Sword	2014-04-20	I watched the scene assuming that Mole's Town will be evacuated to the Wall at some point later in the season, so this is just a way to deal with the fact that Sam and Gilly got to Castle Black too soon, though that would lead one to wonder why they would spend so much of this episode there if that were to be the case? Â As I expected from the time Jon took off with Ygritte in Season Two, I have no idea where they are going with the plot on and beyond the Wall, and I sometimes wonder if D&D do either.
1302	juanml82	2014-04-20	That was awful, why did they have Sam do that. Almost everyone took a hit this week. Poor Gilly.


He did the right thing, given the circumstances. Gilly wouldn't have lasted a night at Castle Black without getting raped. Mole's Town is marginally less bad. And it's not like he can send her to Winterfell or something.
Â 
In any event, 50/50 Gilly and her baby die when the Wildlings attack Mole Town.

Â 
Dude... wtf???
Â
1305	King Tommen	2014-04-20	Gilly going to a brothel and being assigned non-whore responsibilities is actually a safer environment than her being the only female in a place with former rapists and thieves who have blue balls. At least in Mole's Town, any guy looking for sex there has plenty of willing options as opposed to trying to hook up with the "waitress at the strip club".
Â 
It's kind of a shitty move by Sam but John Bradley did an interview recently where he talked about Sam making decisions early in the season because of his cowardice and insecurities that he later will regret but as the season progresses, he redeems himself and has his most heroic moments. I'm guessing this is the bad decision he's talking about.
Â 
But, yes, the Wildlings are coming to raid Mole's Town so she and the baby will be in danger soon enough.

Â I'm not so sure about that. She doesn't really have any friends there, [that other woman already seems to hate her] and they already know she's a wildling with a wildling baby. Wildlings are killing villagers left and right at the moment.Â Common folks would be out for revenge.Â News will travel fast among the common folk there is a wildling at Mole's Town with a baby. I don't think she is safe at all. At least at Castle Black, she has some friends, and some people in charge who would behead someone who rapes a girl after taking the vows.

Â 
It's about what Sam thinks, not what is the reality of the situation. Obviously Mole's Town is not going to be safe for her but based on the info Sam has, it's what he thinks makes sense. And as Bradley says, it's a bad decision.
Â 
Sam is really abdicating his responsibilities here because he doesn't think he has enough willpower or strength to protect her from fellow NW if they come for her. He's making a cowardly move because he still doesn't think he can protect her. Hard lesson for him here as this just ends up putting her in a more vulnerable position.

1308	Gertrude	2014-04-20	My impression of taking Gilly to Mole Town was that it was a way to introduce the concept of Mole Town to the show watchers. It makes us more emotionally invested when the Wildling attack does come, and gives a smoother transition to when we see the Mole-town residents help manning the Wall later. And a little about Sam's protectiveness of Gilly, but mostly the other stuff.

Â 
I guess you're right, but I still feel that precious minutes were wasted in Mole Town in this episode. They can explore Sam's feelings at Braavos or in the ship towards Oldtown.
1310	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-20	Kind of assuming that's the last we see of Gilly until next season .. but they needed to touch on that plot line because even Unsullied in Youtube videos were asking "what happened to Gilly and her baby?" after s3e10/s4e1 .. now she's stashed away and perhaps Sam goes to pick her up on the way to Oldtown next season... Maester Aemon won't even see her!
Â 
In a way Sam's right (albeit for the wrong reasons) in getting her out of there before the wall is attacked, granted if they breached the wall it's not as if she'd be safe for much longer than she would've been otherwise.

Mole's Town is getting attacked by Tormund and the gang very soon so it's highly unlikely that's the last we see of Gilly this season.

Â 
I totally thought it was Satin too, and for a while I was really excited that they might have found a way to squeeze him in, then with all the "Wildling!" yelling, I realized that they hadn't been that clever, it's just supposed to be a really ugly whore, and I was sad.

Â 
Â 
How can they possibly add the baby switch / Mance Rayder son plot line now? No baby for Mance Rayder has been shown at all and Gilly's been stuffed in Mole Town ... That's going to be really tough to move back around now. AND if they're dropping the baby switch story, why? It was important for Stannis and wanting a king's blood to sacrifice when they got to the wall, right?

Â 
He wanted king's blood, he didn't get it and then....nothing really. Don't see how removing this part makes a big difference. Unless Gilly having a magic baby with her in Oldtown is somehow significant, the baby switch thing is totally unnecessary.
1316	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	I'm beginning to think they are going to ditch the baby switch subplot.
Sam will probably travel to Oldtown without Gilly. Looks like it's farewell to Gilly after this season.
Â 
Maybe he'll go to say goodbye to her before leaving, and that's when Fat Pink Mast takes place.

Â 
You can ditch the baby-switch plot and still have Gilly travel with Sam (with her real baby). His developing relationship with her is important to his character. If there were no plans to keep her around, I don't know why we'd be spending as much time with the two of them as we have.

Â 
You're right.
Only thing is that with no baby swap, Gilly would have no reason to travel far from Mel at the Wall.
Maybe they'll change it so she's not fitting in Mole's Town, and wants to be with Sam.

Â 
I think she's going to be at Mole's Town for all of an episode or two since it's about to get decimated by Tormund and the crew. She'll be back at Castle Black later this season in some form or another. This is a very small detour to demonstrate Sam's poor decision-making as a result of him still hanging on to his insecurities. He'll redeem himself with Gilly later this season and they'll be a bonafide couple by the time they set out for Oldtown. Every scene with the two of them points to this being the ultimate destination.
1320	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	Just because was haven't seen them yet does not mean Mance doesn't have a wife and child.
Â 
Putting Gilly in Mole's Town will allows viewers to have more engagement when the Wildling attack happens than 'parent's of potato boy die' does. It will ramp up the tension and does not mean the Gilly/Sam scenes later won't happen.
1321	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-21	Let's see, keep her in the castle with rapers and thieves who have a hierarchical command staff that punishes crimes with corporal punishment...or the brothel where said rapers and thieves go to...well I suppose it's technically consensual at that point...

1323	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	Let's see, keep her in the castle with rapers and thieves who have a hierarchical command staff that punishes crimes with corporal punishment...or the brothel where said rapers and thieves go to...well I suppose it's technically consensual at that point...
Â 
Sam the Stupid


Â 
I live in a mining town with a large number of brothels. It also has the lowest rates of rape and sexual assault on the entire continent.
Â 
Sam's mistake was putting her in the path of the Wildlings.
1324	Red Raven	2014-04-21	Couldn`t he take her to a place in Mole Town that isn`t a brothel?


Â 
I think the entire town is a brothel. Â 
Â 
I really hope that they're not just putting Gilly and the baby on a bus and dumping her on Mole Town because they're planning to cut out the Citadel storyline entirely. Â That would suck. Â I want Sam and pals to go to Oldtown.
1325	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-21	I would have rather suffered another 10 minutes of meaningless brothel scenes than see 3 more seconds of Sam and Gilly - Love on the Rocks. Worst waste of screen time thus far across all three previous seasons.
1326	direwoofwoof	2014-04-21	Did not like leaving Gilly and little Sam in the brothel. It seemed the old blind man Mormont (can't recall his Castle Black name) was protective of her, as well as Sam's friends.
1327	direwoofwoof	2014-04-21	Did not like leaving Gilly and little Sam in the brothel. It seemed the old blind man Mormont (can't recall his Castle Black name) was protective of her, as well as Sam's friends.
1328	David Selig	2014-04-21	Great idea, Sam, take the girl to the vulnerable town likely to be raided any day now, instead of letting her stay in the castle, where the only fighting force able to defend her is.
1329	NightStark	2014-04-21	Great idea, Sam, take the girl to the vulnerable town likely to be raided any day now, instead of letting her stay in the castle, where the only fighting force able to defend her is.

A lot of them, including Sam I presume are leaving to go beyond the Wall soon so nobody she knows would be there to keep her safe.
1330	JonSnow1234	2014-04-21	We can see in the trailers for season 4 Molestown being burnt by the wildlings so Gilly will proberbly be involved in this. The decision for Sam to send her away could be to do with the selfish decison the actor spoke about in an interview, he is doing it for himself.
1331	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-21	I'm guessing that either 1) Sam gets word of the attack on Molestown and goes to rescue Gilly and the baby, or 2) Gilly and baby run away from the brothel and return to Castle Black. Then Jon comes up with the idea of having Aemon and Sam go to the Citadel (maybe with the detour to Braavos?), and Sam asks if Gilly+baby can come with him.
1332	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-21	Â 
Â 
How can they possibly add the baby switch / Mance Rayder son plot line now? No baby for Mance Rayder has been shown at all and Gilly's been stuffed in Mole Town ... That's going to be really tough to move back around now. AND if they're dropping the baby switch story, why? It was important for Stannis and wanting a king's blood to sacrifice when they got to the wall, right?


Â I think they can still do it. And I hope they do. In the books, Jon offers the citizens of Mole Town a chance to come to safetly in Castle Black. So maybe that's how Gilly gets back. And we still have a few episodes to introduce Mance's baby. I'm keeping my finger's crossed.
1333	lezboyd	2014-04-21	To be honest, I do not see the need for this scene/detour from the books at all.
Â 
The only reason I can think of for this scene is that they wanted the actress tucked away somewhere till they need her. But that is still a lame reason for having this scene/sub-plot.

I agree. Â Completely unnecessary scene. Â Sometimes following the book wastes film resources.
1335	Bayard	2014-04-21	Did not like leaving Gilly and little Sam in the brothel. It seemed the old blind man Mormont (can't recall his Castle Black name) was protective of her, as well as Sam's friends.


Â 
You mean old man Targaeryen? He is Aemon, and even if he is the maester of Castle Black, he has no way to protect her, how do you stop a dozen rapists? just hope they respect their vows?
1336	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-21	I'd say she'll still have to go to Oldtown in the end, its such a big part of Sam's story later on, though I don't see where Moletown is leading to currently...


 Â Â
1337	ViennaGirl	2014-04-21	I think they ARE going to skip the baby-switch plot, but I think the important part about that isn't the king's blood or Gilly's road trip, the important part about it is to show that Jon is capable of being cruel and heartless if it's in the best interests of the greater good. So maybe they'll have him make another cruel decision, but almost nothing could be crueler than sending a mom away from her baby...
1338	lezboyd	2014-04-21	I agree. Â Completely unnecessary scene. Â Sometimes following the book wastes film resources.


Â 
I don't think this scene was in the books. Gilly never leaves Castle Black before she has to go away with Sam and Aemon towards the Citadel.
1339	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Sam and Gilly are boring. Sorry. Both book and Show versions.
1340	lezboyd	2014-04-21	Sam and Gilly are boring. Sorry. Both book and Show versions.


Â 
I did not find them boring. Sam actualy does some cool brainy tactical stuff with regards to getting Jon elected as Lord Commander. And Gilly is not that important a character in the books. Her purpose in the books is to mostly serve as wet nurse for the boy that is travelling down south with Sam.

Â 
It's my opinion. I've never found Sam interesting, neither Gilly.

Â 
I agree with this, but I Â just don't see how they can introduce the baby-swap now. So I'm not sure what Show!Gilly's function is at all. And it just feels really unnecessary to focus on her so much.
1343	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	I doubt they're going to do the baby switch. We've never met or heard of Dalla, and they're trying to keep characters to a minimum.
Â 
The decision, on Sam's part, is unintelligible. At Castle Black, he, Jon, his friends, and other good men can protect Gilly. At Mole Town, she's at the mercy of the prostitutes (who didn't seem to take too kindly to her) and the patrons. The patrons, however, are the very men whom Sam fears! Mole Town is the worst of both worlds: the danger of bad men without the protection of good men.
Â 
Who knows? With the way HBO gratuitously and grotesquely butchers characters and storylines, this could be anything. Maybe it's just filler fodder, maybe it's some ridiculous divergence.
1344	NightStark	2014-04-21	The decision, on Sam's part, is unintelligible. At Castle Black, he, Jon, his friends, and other good men can protect Gilly.

They're leaving to go beyond the Wall to Craster's soon.
1345	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	They're leaving to go beyond the Wall to Craster's soon.


He didn't know that when he took her there.
1346	Northbound2.0	2014-04-21	There is still plenty of time for them to ad Dalla, Val and the baby; while doing the baby swap. For those making the case, that the show runners don't wish to cast more people; just look at the characters who have died andÂ will die before this season is over. They will have several open slots on the payrol!
1347	binga	2014-04-21	I think the addition was more for production reasons, they need a point of view in Mole's Town as it is being raided. Gilly will survive the raid because she is a wildling. Maybe her and Ygritte will have a sexposition scene.
1348	Kasumi	2014-04-21	Still, I sensed a similarity with Tyrion/Shae storyline. Am I the only one ? I don't know what to make with this, though.
1349	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-21	Maybe the Wildings will capture her on the way to Castle Black.Â  I'm still confused with this plotline, and if Jon/other crows return to Craster's house.
1350	King Zee	2014-04-21	I think peoples are thinking too much. Â  The burning of Moletown is clearly going to be an important setpiece Â and the best way to show it is to have a character the audience knows already in place.

Â 
They could have placed her there in ten seconds in a dialog between Jon and Sam while they go to see what the deal is with the kid from the southern village.
Instead we have 10 wasted minutes on a scene that isn't even in the book.
Moletown can burn offscreen as well. They could see the flames/smoke from the wall and compare it with the fire Mance will start north of the Wall.
Â 
the "Raper, raper, raper, thief, raper and a thief,raper" line when we see the new recruits was nice, but the rest..not so much. At the moment, Sam(and even Gilly) has more screen time than Jon, and that isn't very nice. And showing us the ugliest whore alive didn't helped matters either.

Â 
Well , I think Gilly is cute and I welcome Â her increased screen time even if it is just plucking geese. Â 
Â 
Â 
More seriously Â you should be able to realise that they are building up the Wilding menace. Â Jon spent a lot of time downplaying the Wildings last season so now they need to be built up as an effective force.
Â 
Hence : the appearance of the Thenns, Â the attack on the little village and soon an Â attack on an established town. The tv audience Â needs to see just how effective a force these Wildings are to believe the castle is in danger.
Â 
Like Â i said I expect fully Â the burning of mole town Â not be offscreen but to be a major set piece taking the emotional place of the attack from the south in the novel. I also expect to see refugees Â flooding into Castle Black. Maybe even the ugly whore.
Â 
Jon will get his moments. Â Sam needs his as well. Â  After all for all we know it is SAM and NOT Jon who will be the major force in dealing with the Others.

1354	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-22	i think its just something for sam to do this season since he isnt there in the book.
i think he'll eventually realize that he was stupid when the wildlings are rading and he'll have to go get her.
1355	Carcetti	2014-04-23	Just out of curiosity, did anyone else think Osha had gone undercover in moles town?Â
1356	Thinishter Goat	2014-04-23	Just out of curiosity, did anyone else think Osha had gone undercover in moles town?Â 


Â 
haha! Yes! I feel 'the ugly whore' is going to get some bad press on here.
Â 
Seriously though, i can see Gilly being there for the attack, somehow getting away and then after the attack at CB, Sam realises, 'there is no safe place in the North anymore, best i drag her with me to Oldtown / Hornhill - oh, and maybe my fat pink mast can get some too!'
Â 
Â
1357	The_Lone_Direwolf	2014-04-23	Doesn't one of the whores from Moletown turn out to be quite a badass with a bow and arrow in the battle so she sticks around?
Maybe that intro of the ugly tough one (I've heard some even suggest she could be a he...?) is actually the casting of a new Night's Watch, be it temp, fighter?
1358	Tankbuster	2014-04-23	it is an Xbow, and him/her name is Zei.
1359	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-23	Obviously the whole thing is pointless if the wildlings attack Mole Town. Maybe they will and Gilly somehow hides and survives, leading to a really dramatic moment when Sam comes back looking for her and he finds her and they'll kiss. 
	Spoiler  Please, no. I can see this happening and it's worrying me now.
1360	Starksmustwin	2014-04-23	what could go wrong? living in a brothel is a way better way to avoid rape than living at Castle Black. Wait. Not.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
So.. she'd be safer at a place where the men don't get any sex at all than a place were they can pay for all the sex they want?
1361	Dany's Silver	2014-04-23	Kind of assuming that's the last we see of Gilly until next season .. but they needed to touch on that plot line because even Unsullied in Youtube videos were asking "what happened to Gilly and her baby?" after s3e10/s4e1 .. now she's stashed away and perhaps Sam goes to pick her up on the way to Oldtown next season... Maester Aemon won't even see her!
Â 
In a way Sam's right (albeit for the wrong reasons) in getting her out of there before the wall is attacked, granted if they breached the wall it's not as if she'd be safe for much longer than she would've been otherwise.


Â 
Maester Aemon met her when Sam returned to the wall with Gilly. She tells him that she named her baby Sam, and Maester Aemon asks to Sam if he remembers his vows.Â  That's when Sam says the baby isn't his, but he does remember that his vows tell him to guard the (emphasis his) "realms of men," which in his opinion includes Gilly and her son.
Â 
I didn't mind their scenes as much as some, but I think it would have been a more effective use of their screen time if Gilly had asked Sam whether or not he told Jon that his brother is still alive.Â  I would still like to see an explanation for Sam not telling Show!Jon about Bran going north of the Wall!
Â 
I still think the baby switch can happen, since they can introduce Dalla, Val, etc. when Jon is sent to kill Mance in his tent once Mance reaches the Wall.Â  I don't see them removing that bit from Jon's storyline, as I think it's important that Jon is beyond the Wall with the wildlings when Stannis shows up.
1362	Le Cygne	2014-04-23	Obviously the whole thing is pointless if the wildlings attack Mole Town. Maybe they will and Gilly somehow hides and survives, leading to a really dramatic moment when Sam comes back looking for her and he finds her and they'll kiss. 
	Spoiler   Please, no. I can see this happening and it's worrying me now.
Well, it would be stupid and pointless like much of the made up stuff, but as stupid and pointless things go, I'd like to see them kiss. Or hug. Or something. Let at least one of the love stories play out on in some sort of book approximate fashion on the show.
1363	Red Raven	2014-04-23	Â 
So.. she'd be safer at a place where the men don't get any sex at all than a place were they can pay for all the sex they want?


Â 
Because a brothel was such a wonderful place for Jeyne Poole.
1364	Petyr Patter	2014-04-24	Just out of curiosity, did anyone else think Osha had gone undercover in moles town?Â 


Â 
You know, I thought the exact same thing.Â  There was something in her mannerisms and face that reminded me of Osha.Â  I tried to find some sort of evidence that the actress who played her, Natalia Tena was involved with the show this season, but came up empty.Â  It does strike me as a safe and straightforward way to rewrite Osha and Rickon's path, by having them hide in the Mole's Town brothel.Â  It is also worth noting that Ser Locke will almost certainly pass through the place on his way to Castle Black in search of Stark boys.Â  Suspense!
1365	King Zee	2014-04-24	Â 
Because a brothel was such a wonderful place for Jeyne Poole.


Â 
wasnt she a prisoner as opposed to an actual employee ?
1366	DaveyJoe	2014-04-24	I just hope nothing bad happens to Gilly.Â
1367	Baltan	2014-04-24	The whole thing about if it's safe or not to be stuck in a brothel depends on which terms you end up in there.
Â 
Jeyne Poole was forced into a brothel and trained against her will. We can assume she was forced to work as a prostitute. Not safe for her.
Â 
Arya stayed at the Peach, and even while at a certain moment she is taken for a prostitute, Gendry comes to her "rescue". We can assume that the brotherhood would have reacted if she had been forced into a sexual situtation, or if her safety were in serious jeopardy. At least we are sure no Lannisters were going to seize her in there. Safe in a way.
Â 
Catelyn stayed at LittleFinger's brothel, and it was supposed to be the safest place for her at KL. She suffered no slight nor harm. For Catelyn, in her situation, in that particular moment, it was safe.
Â 
Gilly, on the other hand, is not welcome in that brothel, even if she arrives with the promise of working as a servant girl and a baby sitter. She is mistrusted for being considered a wildling. I don't think any patron would bother with her, but I do think she might be bullied by the brothel people, just because she is a wildling.
Â 
But I think the point is that the REAL danger doesn't come from the brothel itself, but from those wicked wildlings that are renowned for being raiders, rapers and killers. And they just happened to be South the Wall, heading in the general direction of the village.
Sam knows that, and that makes it a poor decision from him to consider that the chance of being molested/raped by any of the hundred brothers (that so far nothing actually has happened) is more dangerous than to place her in a possible target of a wildling attack.
Â 
So, safe? Not at all. But not because of the brothel, that in any other situation might have been a viable option, but for the imminent attack of a wildling party with cannibals among them.
Â 
I trust HBO twists, and generally I enjoy them, but this was an unnecessary change of plot. Let's hope these wasted scenes are leading to something important in the future.
1368	Dany's Silver	2014-04-24	Even if Sam didn't know about the imminence of the wildling attack when he sent Gilly to Mole Town, he still should have foreseen this!Â
1369	King Tommen	2014-04-24	Even if Sam didn't know about the imminence of the wildling attack when he sent Gilly to Mole Town, he still should have foreseen this!Â 


Â 
The whole point is that Castle Black is a place where Sam believes that the NW cannot control their urges, that's why women aren't there. She is the only female there so would be in constant danger of some guy not being able to keep it in his pants and a source of constant temptation for guys who have had to curb their natural instinct and of whom many have had no issues raping women in the past. He can't keep his eye on her 24 hours a day and he doesn't believe himself strong-willed or physically intimidating enough to fend off any advances.
Â 
No offence to Gilly, but the NW aren't eyeing her up because they find her super attractive and would want to seek her out, it's because she's the only freaking woman there and therefore she becomes especially tempting.
Â 
Mole's Town is far from ideal but it is filled with women who are willing to have sex with any men that come there so in theory, she's going to be somewhat protected because of this. It's not ideal, but Sam doesn't really have much in the way of options.
At the end of the day, it's not a great decision because of the imminent threat of the Wildlings but John Bradley admits that Sam making this bad decision is by design because they want to demonstrate that he still has issues with his cowardice and self-loathing.

1370	rmholt	2014-04-27	I'd guess no, not if they're going to keep up this infantile flirting thing. Sam to the rescue (again) for a little stammering and eyelid batting. I hope she tells him to f himself and returns to the Wall and boards herself up in a castle room, where she belongs. Edd is there to protect her now.
1371	rmholt	2014-04-27	Just out of curiosity, did anyone else think Osha had gone undercover in moles town?Â 

Yes but I was told it was a different actress. Maybe some spear wives stay south of the Wall after a raid - like Osha's twin.
1372	paramount	2014-05-06	Mole's town is goanna get sacked by the Free FolkÂ in ASOFSÂ maybe then Jon and Sam could save Gilly before the Free Folk destroy Mole's town.

1374	paramount	2014-05-08	Sam will leave one way or another.
1375	LordStoneheart	2014-04-21	Was anyone else loving Emilia Clarkeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s performance tonight? Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m really loving how the show ends with her strong points. There will be the inevitable decries of white washing, but overall I feel this was a solid scene.
Â 
When Emilia began to address the slaves of Meereen I thought her acting was turned up to eleven, compared to lets say, season 2 when she confronts the Spice King. In both of these scenes sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to be speaking with conviction but almost all of S2 I find very forced and false. Tonight I wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t watching Emilia Clarke recite the showrunnerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dialogue. I was watching Daenerys Jelmazmo, the Last Dragon. Emiliaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s acting just blew me away. Maybe sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just found a strange niche in the acting world where sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s amazing with using languages to guide how she carries herself in a scene. 
Â 
One thing I also noticed was a possible nod to the Meereenese Knot, just like last season with Pod the Sex God in the whorehouse. I swear, Dany said â<U+0080><U+009C>Meereen Knot mastan,â<U+0080><U+009D> a possible easter egg (heehee) for book readers. What I loved about this scene even though itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not in the books is the introduction of the slaves and the Masters. The collar idea is absolutely wonderful. It seems the sewage diving might be dropped in favor of a slave revolution. yeah, yeah, say white washing all you want. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get worse from here, as evidence by one of the trailers. I believe towards the end of this season we will get a darker Dany and the beginning of her disasterous rule in Meereen. Bonus points, we also got to see the man with the best name in the entire series, Hizdahr zo Loraq (although part of me does enjoy calling him Jizrag the Lorax.) He was given no lines, just some stares, but donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you already just hate him?
Â 
Â 
So, solid acting, solid writing, a taste of things to come, the beginning of the Knot, and a sexy Daario wink. I couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t ask for more in a Dany episode. Except dragons. J
1376	daCGIdragonsareAERODYNAMIC	2014-04-25	Yeah, Emilia blew me away too. I think she (and Kit too) has definitely improved her acting vastly from S2 Qarth scenes. I'm pretty sure you're right about the easter egg "Meereen knot"Â   . I haven't noticed until a rewatch. I'm really excited to know how they will handle the knot given that show!Dany is older than book!Dany and seems like she can learn faster maybe ? The broken chains catapulting is pretty smart.
Â 


Â I believe towards the end of this season we will get a darker Dany and the beginning of her disasterous rule in Meereen.


Â 
I think we'll end this season with her locking up her dragons, before she enters a self-rediscovery phase and then becomes darker. And this Daario is really growing on me. Not a fan of book!Daario, I just can't take him seriously, but this guy is more convincing in flesh.
1377	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-25	Well, if she's gotten better with the acting, its because she's basically filmed the same scene for 4 seasons now (standing outside the gates of a city, yelling about such and such). Side note, I wish she'd introduce herself as "Daenerys of the House Targaryen"...not "Daenerys Stormborn". That bothers me.Â  Â
1378	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-26	She's a terrible actor, but she's gorgeous.
1379	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-26	Well, if she's gotten better with the acting, its because she's basically filmed the same scene for 4 seasons now (standing outside the gates of a city, yelling about such and such). Side note, I wish she'd introduce herself as "Daenerys of the House Targaryen"...not "Daenerys Stormborn". That bothers me.Â  Â 


Seriously. She uses it so much that one would think that Targaryen is not her House name.Â
1380	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-26	She is terrible. She looks pretty. But acting is terrible.Â
1381	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-04-26	It said "Emilia Appreciation" so I'm not sure why people are in here bashing her like you don't have 9 million other threads to do it in?
1382	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	Terrible is too harsh. Obviously she's not the best actor on the show but she has improved and can pull of certain things pretty well. Her being over-dramatic isn't a minus IMO because Dany IS overdramatic. So that's just her being accurate. As for her being beautiful when people are talking about her acting, it isn't really relevant. But obviously it's a pretty necessary component of her character too.

1383	Petyr Patter	2014-04-26	I suspect we are going to see Danaerys dealing with the "Knot" later this season, but Danaerys should already be suffering the fallout of her decisions.Â  What was the line from the book, 10,000 mouths with feet?Â  Freeing slaves had huge consequences which drove her later decision making.Â  We haven't seen any of those consequences.Â  If the consequences don't come until after she proclaims "I will rule," the television audience will completely miss her motivations.Â  Danaerys's problems don't come from trying to rule (though she has plenty of those as well), they come first and foremost from her decision to challenge an economic and social foundation for half a continent.Â  The reason she decides to rule Meereen instead of continuing her journey was a necessity to keep her people safe.Â 
Â 
Ever since Danaerys attacked Astapor, we are yet to see her face any sort of real hardship or difficult decision.Â  She wins over the Second Sons because Daario wants to bang her.Â  She risks her top three people and they have a hairy fight, but all emerge from Yunkai alive and the city is taken.Â 
Â 
I hate to complain about a character arc in a thread meant to praise her, but I can't help but feel like they aren't doing service to the character by the current "savior" theme.Â  Freeing slaves may be the "right thing" to do, but it is also a costly and complicated thing, which makes Danaerys decision to free them more noble.
1384	LordStoneheart	2014-04-26	So as Winterfell's Revenge pointed out, the thread does say appreciation. Criticism of Dany and Emilia can go and most definitely will go anywhere else. But that's not what I asked for so consider your comments ignored. I respect your opinions but I don't have to respond them all that much.
Â 
I honestly love that she calls herself Stormborn. It's an amazing name and amazing in High Valyrian. I do realize that her story line has been somewhat repetitive the past ten episodes but there was something in this particular episode that stuck out. Something about her address to the slaves of Meereen that was just incredibly powerful. I see that it's definitely been more positively portrayed than the books but I have a feeling that soon there will be word from the current state of Yunkai and Astapor (or what's left of them) and that will be what causes her to stay... if that's not the reason, well, shit, they've pretty much derailed her entire story line...
1385	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-26	Her "Xena warrior princess" is amusing and fun to watch. She's quite the badass
Super bangin
Great voice actress(if thats what you call it)
Â 
tbh, its pissing me off that she aint showin as much skin these days. The fame is getting to her head Â but ill forgive her
Â 
Tv! Dany kick ass Â Â

1386	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-26	I think Emilia is underrated. (On ASOIAF/GOT discussion forums at least. I don't see many casual, non-ASOIAF biased reviewers and IRL watchers badmouthing the character.) She was shoddy in Qarth, but the bigger problem with her character at the time was the writing.

She was naked five episodes ago. Give her time; her fun with Daario is just around the corner.

1387	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-26	I try to like her acting. And be sure I'm not the pickiest. I think Kit and Aiden are pretty good for their roles. But Emilia's acting reminds me of those kids in high school that are doing drama. Not a pretty sight.
1388	LordStoneheart	2014-04-26	It honestly depends on the scene, which is why I contrasted S4 to S2. We can all agree that S2 writing was very weak, and so was her acting. As Konradsmith said, Dany is overdramatic. that's her character. Where Emilia shines best I think is the emotional scenes. If there were more of these past S1 she would definitely seem more rounded as a character since Emilia can definitely pull that off.
Â 
S1 highlights: all her heavier scenes with Drogo. Really captured Dany's early struggles.
S2 highlights: ... well, I guess that made up scene with Drogo
S3 highlights: almost every scene with her was perfect Dany from the books except maybe her Dothraki lesson from Missandei, but that was quite funny.
S4: Outside Meereen she's gives her best so far.
Â 
Obviously it would take a lot longer for a scene by scene analysis of her, and let's be honest, some people will just refuse to acknowledge what a good job Emilia has done with the character. But I absolutely love her and cannot imagine anyone else in the role ever.

Â 
All the nuance of Dany was stripped away in these scenes and she was represented as a stoic 'badass' throughout. As a point of reference the 'Valar Morghulis, All men must die' exchange. In the books it showed a tender, sympathetic, empathetic Dany. In the show it was entirely 'badass', 'yay go girl power'. Season 3 stripped away Dany's depth of character - the moments where she looked away to hide her tears etc and replaced it with a stoic 'badass' character at every single opportunity. S3 Dany was not a perfect representation of book Dany at all.
Â 
I don't blame Clarke for that.

1393	LordStoneheart	2014-04-26	Actually I was going to mention the Valar Morghulis part instead of the ath jahakar part, but I wasn't aware of how well received that was or not. Quite honestly, I think the depth you've mentioned is just a casualty of converting this type of narrative on screen without have narration or smaller scenes of dialogue in place of that, which as S1 has shown she would be more than capable of. So yes, I can see what you mean there, but I also think that in terms of where Dany's arc in aSoS goes it was very well handled. Path of the Dragon, as it's called in novella form, was the beginnings of Dany's rise so I think "badass" was a good place to go.
1394	LordStoneheart	2014-04-26	@snowother, actually I meant that blue lines appear above the dots in the parentheses. The tassels are in the upward position, so to speak.

Â 
And I think it has nothing to do with the medium at all and lies wholly and solely on marketing. Leaving that single line as was leaves a completely different impression of the character at the cost of precisely zero screen time. It was an active decision to intentionally change the perception of the character away from the book character.Â
1397	LordStoneheart	2014-04-26	All in good time, ser, all in good time. Depending on how they handle Meereen I think it will be great. They'll build Dany up as flawless badass... Well the higher the climb the harder the fall, and if Meereen is her fall it will be hard.Â
1398	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-26	Perhaps. I don't think they will play it out as that hard a fall though, given how much they have invested in the diversion of her character from the book already. The compression of AFFC and DWD foreshortens that fall further.
1399	Mark Antony	2014-04-26	I try to like her acting. And be sure I'm not the pickiest. I think Kit and Aiden are pretty good for their roles. But Emilia's acting reminds me of those kids in high school that are doing drama. Not a pretty sight.
I'm not gonna say Emilia is a better actor/actress than Kit or Aiden (although I'd say her and kit are essentially even.) but she is definitely better in her role than either of the other two are in theirs. Aidens Littlefinger from season 2 onward is a travesty. Seriously just fucking awful. Kit and Emilia have bad moments and above average ones but Emilia's high points are way better than Kits  both are inexperienced inconsistent actors who should only improve. 2 of the weaker ones on the show for sure though probably only losing out to Shae in the "shitty actor" category
1400	BlackTalon	2014-04-26	How exactly does one say "Mother of dragons" in Valyrian again?

1402	BlackTalon	2014-04-26	Is Muna Ghiscari dialect? I thought mother was "Issa" in Valyrian ... oh well ...
1403	LordStoneheart	2014-04-26	no, issa is some kind of emphasizer though I forget what it means. Some kind of "state of being" type of thing.

Â 
Yeah, sorry. Didn't mean for my initial comment to sound like an insult with regards to her acting abilities (which I think are fine. She's no Sophie Turner mind you, but I'm bias on that account. ). It was meant more as a complaint that she's still getting caught up in the East (book and show) instead of heading west. Anywho, I don't know of a single person who didn't love that last scene. The psychological warfare aspect of it was PRICELESS. The woman gets the most badass scenes, hands down.Â 
Â 
But I must disagree on her use of "Stormborn". She is of a very proud and noble House. She's a TARGARYEN! That that's never emphasized really gets my goat. The only reason she has any sort of claim to the IT is because she's a Targaryen, not a "Stormborn". I mean, everyone else emphasizes their House (Lannister, Stark, etc), but she doesn't. It just...bothers me.
1405	Envie	2014-04-26	Isn't this supposed to be an "Appreciation" thread? Apparently some of you are ignoring that.
Â 
I think a lot of you are being really hard on the actors - all of them mentioned and honestly, some of you need to come down off your high horse of being pro acting critics. You're an anonymous forum critic - wow.
Â 
That being said - there are definitely some actors whose performances stand out above others as superb. That doesn't mean the rest are 'crappy actors' by comparison. I think everyone has done a really good job with very hard material. The story, plots and often not well explained motives of the characters in the books (done intentionally by GRRM because of the POV style) must make writing these scripts and acting them very very challenging. Do try to remember that as you sit at your desk or laptops being so mean.
Â 
Lastly, try to remember this is seriously complex feature film length material being stretched out over years. These actors are being asked to perform at top notch levels you would see in massive productions like the Hobbit or LOTR but then being asked to stretch that out over 10 hours of filming (which is hundreds of hours not actually used and scrapped) and they're being asked to do it on a very short timeframe (they don't have the luxury of two years filming time like feature movies) and often in really shitty weather conditions in foreign locations.
Â 
So really, I think given all those circumstances, all of the actors are doing fantastic. Many were complete unknowns before coming to this show which was not even promised to be continued...imagine how hard it was to find the right actors back before the first season!
Â 
Perspective people. Some of you need it.
Â 
And lastly, I think Emilia has had some really spectacular scenes that really made me stand up and cheer for her story even when I wasn't that big of a fan of it from the books. I say, that's a success.

Â 
Lol. Â If this is satire it is quite well done. Â If it's serious, it's probably the most hilariously hypocritical post I've seen on this anonymous forum. Â "You guys have no right to offer your amateur opinion! Â Now allow me to write a book offering my amateur opinion, and somehow conclude that doing so elevates me above all others."
Â 
As this is an appreciation thread, Emilia was quite good back in Season 1....

Â 
Yeah that's about it.
1407	boojam	2014-04-26	Terrible is too harsh. Obviously she's not the best actor on the show but she has improved and can pull of certain things pretty well. Her being over-dramatic isn't a minus IMO because Dany IS overdramatic. So that's just her being accurate. As for her being beautiful when people are talking about her acting, it isn't really relevant. But obviously it's a pretty necessary component of her character too.Thought she was very good and fit GRRM's Dany in season 1.As others have said, poor writing in season 2, she was good in E1, E2 and E10.Maybe she will have it someday, but as I have said, a better actress would have been able to finesse bad dialog , plus I think some of her scenes in S2 could be blamed on the director (and each is a good director too), it's like they did not have enough time for more takes, maybe they didn't.Emilia has been very good (maybe not excellent) since season 2, and sensational in S3E4.Something really ignites her when speaking Valyrian, even the scenes speaking to Grey Worm and the crowd at Yunkai in S3.To me she's been fine in season 4, and outstanding in the long Valyrian address last week.(How people got by without megaphones is a question for the philosophers!)Ruling in Meereen has me a little apprehensive , since even George , to me, seemed to let the character slip, as if his mind was elsewhere in ADWD.We shall see how Bryan Cogman handles things episode 4.I thought she was ok in the E4 preview.I thought

Â 
Excuse me? You need to check yourself. Nowhere have I been hypocritical. You can go read every post I've made in the past weeks and you will see I have been very supportive of all the actors and character portrayals even defending Aiden Gillen in that thread. That does NOT make my a hypocrit thank you very much. I was also serious in the reply. Insulting posts like yours are uncalled for as much as the insults I've read against many of the actors on this forum. This sort of attitude from people who post here has only been recently happening and it's a negative trend. I suggested some people need to be mindful of their harsh criticisms of the actors, I did not suggest they cannot have an opinion.Â 
Â 
These forums used to be very positive and productive conversations, even with negative criticisms of the show. Lately it seems like all that's happening is actor bashing and other poster bashing. That's why less people are now having discussions here.Â 
Â 
This episode alone has 4-5 threads full of negativity. It's sad. The show is doing amazingly well and is great. I don't see the need for so much negativity. That was the reason for my entire post. I'm sorry you only saw it as hypocritical and a 'book' - I'm surprised you would be here as reading retention doesn't seem to be a strong point and the books are quite long and detailed.
1409	Mark Antony	2014-04-26	I apologize for bringing negative vibes. Emilia is a great Daenerys imo. I loved her in episode 3. I felt the episode as a whole was pretty mediocre but her scene was quite good.Â
1410	go joff go	2014-04-26	Â 
Was anyone else loving Emilia Clarkeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s performance tonight? Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m really loving how the show ends with her strong points. There will be the inevitable decries of white washing, but overall I feel this was a solid scene.
Â 
Â 
Â 
When Emilia began to address the slaves of Meereen I thought her acting was turned up to eleven, compared to lets say, season 2 when she confronts the Spice King. In both of these scenes sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to be speaking with conviction but almost all of S2 I find very forced and false. Tonight I wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t watching Emilia Clarke recite the showrunnerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dialogue. I was watching Daenerys Jelmazmo, the Last Dragon. Emiliaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s acting just blew me away. Maybe sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just found a strange niche in the acting world where sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s amazing with using languages to guide how she carries herself in a scene.
Â 
Â 
Â 
One thing I also noticed was a possible nod to the Meereenese Knot, just like last season with Pod the Sex God in the whorehouse. I swear, Dany said â<U+0080><U+009C>Meereen Knot mastan,â<U+0080><U+009D> a possible easter egg (heehee) for book readers. What I loved about this scene even though itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not in the books is the introduction of the slaves and the Masters. The collar idea is absolutely wonderful. It seems the sewage diving might be dropped in favor of a slave revolution. yeah, yeah, say white washing all you want. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get worse from here, as evidence by one of the trailers. I believe towards the end of this season we will get a darker Dany and the beginning of her disasterous rule in Meereen. Bonus points, we also got to see the man with the best name in the entire series, Hizdahr zo Loraq (although part of me does enjoy calling him Jizrag the Lorax.) He was given no lines, just some stares, but donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you already just hate him?
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
So, solid acting, solid writing, a taste of things to come, the beginning of the Knot, and a sexy Daario wink. I couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t ask for more in a Dany episode. Except dragons. J
Â 


Actually she was suppose to sound like a whiny teenager, which is why the spice merchant called her a whiny teenager. I am amazed that people don't understand that especially with Jon and Danny that they aren't suppose to be admirable in those scenes. It's not bad acting, writing, or directing. It's exactly what the show is aiming for.
1411	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-26	Â 
Isn't this supposed to be an "Appreciation" thread? Apparently some of you are ignoring that.

You know, you gotta wonder why when someone makes a thread like this, a bunch of people are posting discontent. Obviously there is something wrong with Daenerys' portrayal, be it Clarke's fault or otherwise. People wouldnt be making noise about it in an appreciation thread if that wasnt the case.Â 
<.<


I suspect we are going to see Danaerys dealing with the "Knot" later this season, but Danaerys should already be suffering the fallout of her decisions.Â  What was the line from the book, 10,000 mouths with feet?Â  Freeing slaves had huge consequences which drove her later decision making.Â  We haven't seen any of those consequences.Â  If the consequences don't come until after she proclaims "I will rule," the television audience will completely miss her motivations.Â  Danaerys's problems don't come from trying to rule (though she has plenty of those as well), they come first and foremost from her decision to challenge an economic and social foundation for half a continent.Â  The reason she decides to rule Meereen instead of continuing her journey was a necessity to keep her people safe.Â 
Â 
Ever since Danaerys attacked Astapor, we are yet to see her face any sort of real hardship or difficult decision.Â  She wins over the Second Sons because Daario wants to bang her.Â  She risks her top three people and they have a hairy fight, but all emerge from Yunkai alive and the city is taken.Â 
Â 
I hate to complain about a character arc in a thread meant to praise her, but I can't help but feel like they aren't doing service to the character by the current "savior" theme.Â  Freeing slaves may be the "right thing" to do, but it is also a costly and complicated thing, which makes Danaerys decision to free them more noble.


This is a solid post. If i were Clarke, i would be flipping tables. Why? Cuz the writers are robbing her of chance to be a nuanced Dany and play up Dany's much more human side. And then i ask myself, "Does she even care?" *sigh*
Â 
nonetheless, i enjoyed her in the last episode. Mostly cuz of this. That. Face. Its both wonderful and hilarious and i did imagine book!Dany making this face. All those guys in Meereen staring down at her chortling and she musters up her best "bitch, please..." face.Â
1412	Cyril	2014-04-26	It surprised me, but apparently, the Valyrian is \a lot of edited clips and less her perfectly reciting the lines.Â  It's really interesting and the end-effect was incredible.Â  I prefer her speaking Valyrian to English.
Â 
HC: How difficult is it to master High Valyrian?
EC: Oh, my goodness, you should see the outtakes. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m always amazed when I watch the show. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m like, â<U+0080><U+009C>They edited that really well! They made me sound like I knew what I was doing.â<U+0080><U+009D> Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s definitely tricky. Valyrian is oddly easier than Dothraki. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s got a more lyrical flow to it that feels more familiar to the way I speak. That makes it slightly easier. But, yeah, I have Touretteâ<U+0080><U+0099>s when Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m doing the Valyrian scenes. The rest of the crew is always quite funny. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like, â<U+0080><U+009C>OK, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll go back to the bit where â<U+0080>¦ what are you saying? Just go from the top.â<U+0080><U+009D> No one quite knows what youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re talking about, which is quite funny.

I really hope this happens. Like she starts wearing red and black after her second trip to the Dothraki Sea.Â
1418	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	^That's what I hope for anyhow.
1419	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-26	More Dany wearingÂ red and black.
Â 
They really should have her wear her house colours at least once, she suits them. Although, Red and Black are commonly seen as evil colours so I can understand why the went with the blue.
Â 
I think Emilia Clarke is a great actress, especially with the intense Dany gazes from the books. However, she does have more Badass scenes than any of the otherÂ charactersÂ which helps.

1420	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-26	This one is really nice. They need to put her in the house colors eventually. Look how much less the wig clashes. It just looks more natural. The red and black also helps her look larger than life, which is part of the point of her character. Kinda dont like the blue now. They definitely have to put her in those colors when she gets to Westeros.Â 

Â 
Although, Red and Black are commonly seen as evil coloursÂ 

And precisely for this reason! She'd look very foreboding.Â
1421	LordStoneheart	2014-04-26	I've never thought about the red in black. That looks amazing! I forget, does Dany have a personal fashion favorite in the books besides the hrakkar cloak?
1422	daCGIdragonsareAERODYNAMIC	2014-04-26	All in good time, ser, all in good time. Depending on how they handle Meereen I think it will be great. They'll build Dany up as flawless badass... Well the higher the climb the harder the fall, and if Meereen is her fall it will be hard.


This, exactly. It would make for a more kick-ass character transformation arc where Clarke will finally be able to play a nuanced and grey Daenerys. I think she can pull it off. Less subtle, more impact.
1423	LordStoneheart	2014-04-27	I just thought about something...
Â 
If Dany is portrayed as the beacon of all that is good (I don't agree with this criticism but it's popular on here) and Stannis is portrayed as completely villainous, could that be so their flip-flops are much stronger? Stannis becomes the NW hero and Dany becomes a terrible Queen of Meereen and eventual Destroyer of Westeros?
1424	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-27	When Emilia began to address the slaves of Meereen I thought her acting was turned up to eleven, compared to lets say, season 2 when she confronts the Spice King. In both of these scenes sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to be speaking with conviction but almost all of S2 I find very forced and false.
Â 


Â 
Just wanted to point out that this was kind of the point. In the scene (and many others in season two), Dany's supposed to be speaking with conviction, but she isn't, and the Spice King calls her out on it, essentially. She's desperate, inexperienced, and essentially approached the city as a beggar. If not for Xaro, she would have been denied entry altogether, and as we know he had his own plans (since Kavarro had let them know that she had dragons beforehand, Pyat & Xaro almost certainly had their plans - both A & plan B -together before she even arrived).
Â 
I think she gets way too much flack on these boards. She's nowhere near terrible. You want terrible? The actress who played Andrea onÂ The Walking DeadÂ was terrible. Emilia Clarke just happens to be surrounded by one of the most incredible ensemble casts in television history. She was great in seasons one and three (by and large), less so in season two, and she's been pretty great so far this season. She's nowhere near the best actress on the show, but she doesn't need to be. There's a certain hubris and pomposity about Dany that Clarke nails, but she also mostly nails her more vulnerable and insecure moments.Â

Â 
Blue looks better on screen. Always. Going to make a TV appearance? Wear a blue shirt or a blue tie. Always.Â 
Â 
Given the detail they have put into designs and colour schemes for all the other houses tells me it is not an accident they have not done the same for her. It is purely to make her stand out better on the screen to match their decision to market her more than anyone else.
1430	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	Also the Lannisters have been prominently clad in red for some time now. Conveniently though, this has started to change. Tyrion is more often in black now. As is Cersei in her mourning attire. As they become less identified with red it might make sense (particularly after she embraces the whole not planting trees thing) to begin putting Dany in red. As for now, she looks quite good in blue. When she gets to ruling Meereen (so basically after next episode) they finally give her different dresses too for those of you sick of her always being dressed the same. None of those are red (yet) but they may eventually go there colour-wise for the reasons I listed above.

1431	boojam	2014-04-27	it's not the blue dress that bothers me, but the jeans and cowboy boots that they gave her this seasonShe's worn a similar outfit since season 2.The boots are fashioned-up Dothraki riding boots, it's a nice touch.Also since season 2 she has been wearing that Dothraki 'echo' outfit, looks exotic to me , especially with the cape, does it have a hood? She never seems to wear it that way.In season 2 she had a similar but little more elaborate outfit in 'Dothraki' colors, brown and sliver (tho I can't say silver is Dothraki!)... I guess she kept that?I can't remember , if in season 2, she wears that blue gown we have seen in magazine photos?I think this 'riding outfit' turned up in season 3.Tho she did wear a white 'something' in season 3.I guess when one is on the road as much as she has been in the last two seasons , on horse, it's a very utilitarian form of dress while keeping some queenly presentation with a sort of homage to the Dothraki.Would not mind seeing some variation on it tho.Have noticed when she gets her Meereen throne she does have different costume (costumes?). Good to have a place where one can find tailors!(In the books she alway keep her Dothraki 'leathers' and even wore them on occasions.)(When in Meereen George does describe her reluctantly wearing a Tokar, which can be a very elegant style, tho I never figured out what 'rabbit ears' where!)One thing, even if she never wears Targaryen 'colors' it would nice to see the sigil of the house Targaryen somewhere! We never see a banner or emblem of any kind. I may be wrong but have we ever seen it on the show? We all know what it looks like.Since she did not pick up a crown , in Qarth, as she did in the books, I keep hoping that someone will turn up with her mother's crown for her, that would be a cool touch.(The crown her brother sold.)

Â 
The bigger they are the harder they fall. George loves toying with us and changing how we feel about characters. Dany and Stannis have always been two morally grey characters with many pros and cons. Thats why I love them both but the Mereense Knot and Stalemate at the Wall really dragged them down and stripped away so much potential. Although Stannis's death march to Winterfell is really shaping up to be his finest moment.
1433	Le Cygne	2014-04-27	If they wanted us to think she remembered Drogo, they could actually have her remember him from time to time. She finally mumbled something about her husband last season. They fail on this point so badly, and so often, with all the characters.(Just to clarify, I get the connection with blue, I'm saying they didn't actually make that point clear in the show, and the above would have been more effective.)

Yeah thats also a thing. Like, even in season 1, this was a thing. Clarke was pitted next to Harry Lloyd who outshined her in every possible way. When she was not on screen with him, she was able to look much more capable. But put him back in the scene and shes pushed back down. Clarke acting next to Ian Glen also has this effect but its not as severe. (since Glen downplays Jorah a bit.) When Viserys got killed off, Dany got to shine more. Lloyd out-acting Clarke and her going along with it did help with Dany's emergence as a character in her own right, butÂ damn it was visible.Â Too much so .. 
Clarke is better than Mamoa doe. <.<Â 
Â 
As Dany's cadre grows, so does the contrast between Clarke and her co-stars. We got up-and-comers who really gibe well with their characters like Turner and Williams. You got a huge amount of classically trained badasses,Â and Dinklage, and then you have Emilia Clarke trying to tread water. Shes staying afloat but just so. Im hard on her because i want to see Daenerys and i think Clarke has it in her. But its frustrating to see someone pretending to be Dany in quieter scenes, instead of Dany. Ya know?Â

I actually dont think they'll do that. I think they will keep Dany's Ultimately-Good-But-Messes-Up-A-Metric-Fuckton deal and Stannis' I-Saved-A-Major-Protagonist's-Arse-And-I-Fight-For-Justice-But-Im-Still-An-Asshole thing.Â

1438	SlowLoras	2014-05-01	I'm gonna chime in her and say that a lot of Clarke's duff performances, imo, can be attributed in part to the writers making Danaerys a one-note character.
Â 
Back in s1, Clarke played Dany beautifully - a scared young girl being sold off to a man she knew nothing about, by her brother, whom she trusted. IMO she did a great job - I bought Dany's fear and discomfort, and her growing confidence as she won Drogo's love and respect. There were facets to Danaerys's character, and while Clarke's not exactly Laurence Olivier she did a fine job of bringing those facets to life.
Â 
Roll on the next two seasons and Dany's been reduced to a single set of characteristics: defiant, speechifying Khaleesi. Even when her dragons are stolen there's precious little fear or concern, but a whole lot of WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS??? - laughable scriptwriting imo, and it gives Emilia very little to work with. She's given a lot of bold speeches and quirked eyebrows, but no heart & soul. It's almost as if the writers don't know how to make Danaerys a person.
Â 
You could argue that a better actor might be able to make all of this work, and you may well be right - but look at Aiden Gillen. He was phenomenal in The Wire - clearly this man can act, and in fact s1 Littlefinger was fantastic IMO. especially his exchanges with Varys. Lately, he's become a comic book villain, complete with Batvoice, spouting out great lumps of exposition every time he's onscreen. He's a good actor, I won't be convinced otherwiseÂ because I've seen him pull off superb performances in other roles. So why's he so bad all of a sudden?
Â 
Contrast Kit Harington, who was good in s1 (imo) and on-off in s2 & s3 - his better scenes in the latter series were the ones where Jon actually got to do something instead of trudge about in the snow. 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair' is a good example of this - the scenes where he's flirting with Ygritte, where he tells her the Wildlings can't possibly win - those were well-acted, well-written scenes. In s4 so far he's been consistently good (again, imo) - and I do believe that this is partly because he's got something to work with. They've written Jon as a character, not as a cardboard cutout.
Â 
I'm not pretending Emilia's the best actress in the world - she's clearly not. But neither is she the worst. I think she's a perfectly adequate actress struggling with some duff material, and writers who can't write Danaerys convincingly.

Â 
Not sure if someone already mentioned this, but they stated that they made blue her primary colour because it is the most precious colour of the Dothraki, so as Khaleesi, she dons the colour. I know Ser Jorah also had a blue collar at some points, not checked to see if it's carried through but there will be the same logic behind it. It will also be so that she stands out in such a dusky environment, from a visual standpoint (which is the primary point of all film), she looks stunning in the colour. It also makes her the visual opposite of 'The Red Woman'. I know the Targ colours are red and black, but it doesn't mean she has to walk around in them like a superhero. Blue will always be Dany's colour from now on, it seems. Though I'm glad to see she'll also be wearing white
1442	drayrock	2014-04-22	It's getting pretty late in the game. Unless they're going for extra soggy...did they cut LS? I'd be pretty bummed. Although given the next episode title is Oathkeeper, it makes sense episode 4, if any would have it.Â 
If they cut her and added that Jaime rape scene, I'd say they thoroughly botched they are 2/4 this season so far...

1444	brook	2014-04-22	I may be way off but I am guessing she will appear hanging Freys in ep 6 The Laws of Gods and Men which will also feature the 'death' of the hound (after he was also shown breaking guest right this week).

I think she will be introduced very late in the season, if not perhaps the cliffhanger for episode 10.

I think theyve already laid the groundwork with the Hound scene. The farmer complaining about the Freys and revenge regarding Guest Right. Bringing up the Tulley's. We saw the Riverlands burning.

Â 
Â If they cut LS, I'm quitting watching the show.  This is the moment I've been looking forward to for 4 seasons. (Plus, they gave Brienne a beefed up role already; she needs something to do and unless they find some other way to have her look for Sansa without actually succeeding and interfering with her Vale storyline, I don't know how it would go, because they can't exactly have her stick around King's Landing.) Although if they were really going to diverge from the books, my fantasy is that she would join Margaery's Queensguard and somehow be buddy cops with Loras.......
1454	Gneisenau	2014-04-22	It seems Brienne gets her mission earlier, so perhaps the first LS scene will be when Brienne meets her ?
1455	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-22	Why have Catelyn take Brienne under her wing, in which she will ask no service that brings her dishonor, in 2x05 if not for them to meet up later and do just that? This show is all about setup.

Â 
Agreed, and great username for this post.
1457	Justin Danford	2014-04-22	Depending on how much they rush the Brienne plot (it looks to me like she'll be leaving KL with Pod this next episode) it's plausible she'd make it to SH by the finale.
Â 
More likely, we'll make it back to the twins toward the finale episodes, perhaps to check in on the Black Fish or Edmureâ<U+0080><U+0094>this should set up a Frey hanging to end the season, in such a satisfying manner.
Â 
Whichever way they end up rolling back the curtain I imagine the scene will recall the faces of the Brotherhood, with focus on Thoros who side-steps, or walks out of frame as we see a pale/grim but very much undead Cat wanting to spill some Frey blood.
Â 
I think they missed the perfect opportunity last season to end the finale with Thoros and the Brotherhood coming across Cat's body on their way to the Wedding and Thoros running over to her, but maybe that would have been too suggestive.
Â 
Whatever happens, SH better not be cut. CH I can live without if pressed, SH I cannot. After Rape Gate, the writers better not leave me without SH...

You know, I have a very complicated relationship with Lady S. I think her reveal in the aSoS epilogue is absolutely amazing and I think it would translate great to tv. It's just later, I don't know how they'll handle that without making viewers think the show jumped the shark.
Â 
I do agree that they need her to give Brienne something to do, though. In fact, now I'm thinking that her whole adventure with Stoneheart could turn out well in the show if they really explore the whole "noble knight in a quest with her loyal squire find a monster in the end" angle (cue True Detective flashback)

Â 
I really hope Lady Stoneheart isnt cut. Like, really hope not. And yeah, its like someone mentioned, they can have the build up of something else leading the BWB and going on a Frey killing spree and junk. That and some more hints about Nymeria reaving the Riverlands with her huge pack of wolves. Definitely would dovetail nicely.

Wat. Aegon is a huge plot bomb. Like...huuuuge. And since he shows up in Tyrion's arc, i highly doubt they are gonna cut him. Hes just not gonna show up until next year.Â
1466	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-22	Aegon won't be cut. They're already beginning to plant the seeds for his story.
Â 
Neither will LSH. There's been nods to it, and it's an essential part of Jaime and Brienne's story. We're only three episodes into the season; no need to panic about something that is quite clearly a season-ending cliffhanger.
1467	Konradsmith	2014-04-22	^This. LSH is a given. And Aegon is very nearly one, after all they did mention the Golden Company in the very episode we are discussing.
1468	Sigrunn	2014-04-22	I doubt it. Unfortunately they won't cut Boringheart.
1469	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-22	I have thought all along that the reveal of Lady SH would come as an end of series cliff-hanger like it is in the books. Really looking forward to the reaction from the unsullied for this!Â 
Although I hadn't thought about the possibility of them speeding up Brienne meeting her by the end of this series and getting the reveal through her viewpoint. I hope it will be through the epilogue scene.Â
1470	The Dorne Ultimatum	2014-04-22	Seeing UnCat so soon, i.e. before the end of the season, would devalue her death at the Red Wedding. The last scene we see is of her throat being opened... bringing her back so soon would be ridiculous, in my opinion. Catching up with all of the remaining Stark children - Sansa, Arya, Bran, even Rickon - would be worthwhile character development and heighten the emotional impact of her return.
Â 
I hope that when we see "Only Cat" later in the series, at the very end of that episode, I hopeÂ that is the moment we see her. Be careful what you wish for, Littlefinger. Be very careful.Â
1471	SeventySeven	2014-04-22	OMG it's episode 3 and UnCat hasn't shown up yet, she's definitely cut even though it wouldn't make sense for her to be revealed in the story just yet, OMG!Â
1472	The brown snake	2014-04-22	I assumed she would be in the very scene of season 4....
1473	ovis alba	2014-04-22	Teehee the pun....


Â 
I prefer the pun of the topic's title.
1474	Joseph Nobles	2014-04-22	If she shows up any earlier, it will build expectation for her to appear more this season. Best to save her for the finale, after Only Cat, as others have mentioned.I'm also thinking that Arya might hear a rumor of some girl killing Freys in the forest and think they are talking about her killing that guy after the Red Wedding. That's a perfect way in my mind to set up Lady Stoneheart without the Unsullied catching on.
1475	AZAXD	2014-04-22	(Love the Olaf-appreciation above me ^^^)
Lady SH will be in for sure! And it's going to be awesome. Cannot wait.
1476	King Tyrion I	2014-04-22	I think she will turn up. And I really hope for her to turn up.
1477	JonSnow1234	2014-04-22	We also got a hint at LS when Sansa was talking to Tyrion in the first episode and she said 'they cut my mother's throat, to the bone and threw her body in the river' which easily opens the door for LS to appear later in the season.
1478	The Killer Snark	2014-04-22	There isn't anything to worry about. She doesn't even make her first appearance until the epilogue of the third book.
1479	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-22	As Gwen Christie said in one of the promo videos before this season when talking about the RW "It was so hard: Catelyn Stark, Richard Madden, Oona Â Chaplin" > She named one as a character and two as the actor's names. They won't be cutting LSH.
Â 
I suspect it will be seen as the final scene of EP10. I hope it is seen through Nymeria's eyes, then Arya wakes up for a massive double-slap for viewers.
1480	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-22	LS
IS
IN
!
Â 
â<U+0080><U+008B>she better beÂ goddammitÂ
1481	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-22	They have ended on supernatural events before to good effect. LSH fits in right with that idea and I definitely see her as being the cliffhanger for the last episode of Season 4.Â 
Â 
It's gon' be good!
1482	Fez	2014-04-22	I continue to hope that she's been cut, but I don't think you need to worry. She's almost certainly going to show up in the finale this season.
1483	Natalia Borgia	2014-04-22	She won't look like a zombie... I am not really show how LSH will look. The book describes her as quite gruesome but she is still recognizable- I am wondering if the make-up people on the show will tone her down a bit ( she would still look human but have a cut throat?...).Â 
Â 
If the show runners are veering so much from source material is it possible the Vale/Sansa stuff never happens and Brienne actually finds her maid of four and ten with auburn hair?Â
1484	Bayard	2014-04-22	I really hope they keep her, it's a moment perfect for TV. Sure, it looks like jumping the shark, but not if they show her as completely different, zombie like, no speech. And they could do it just like in the books. We don't need to know Merrett, but show us in episode 10 Thoros and Anguy catching some Freys. If they are smart they won't show them at all until then. Everybody will remember Thoros, even if they won't know his name.... and than, take the Freys to the cave and have the great reveal, a shrilling Cat.
1485	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-22	As many on here know I despise Lady Stoneheart, however, I can't argue from a narrative standpoint and from what we've seen in the show so far it looks like she's staying.Â  Â 
Â 
Â 
What will be funny is to see the response from the unsullied and critics alike. I would not be surprised if their is a backlash or at least a near universal annoyance that they brought a major character back to life that was supposed to be dead.Â

Â 
Wow, I love that.Â  Â  In my mind she was always more Zombie-like, might be because I found it quiet annoying in the beginning to bring her back (I'm sort of a "What is dead, may never live again" type) that's why she was just this weird annoying corpse to me, but over time I more and more got there can be a point of her and with something like this in mind, I could actually be fine.
1488	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-22	I think she'll be the last scene of episode 10 and the best ending of the series yet in the 'surprise factor' and impact on the audience. They won't cut her, people will dig a RW survivor coming back for vengeance.
Â 
It would be good if this scene follows "Only Cat" but that might be earlier since lots of big things are already happening in episode 10.
Â 
We already have foreshadowing of LS-
Â 
Sansa: "they say they cut her throat to the bone and dumped her body in the river"
Â 
Arya/Beric- "Can you bring back a man without a head?" Making him feel sympathy for Arya and giving him a reason to give her mother the kiss.Â They've also empathised that people can be resurrected.
Â 
They built up the Brienne/Catelyn relationship and that dream with Catelyn pushing Bran of the tree screaming 'Promise me' had an LS vibe to it.
Â 
Michele Fairly will nail the part, it would be a waste if they didn't let her become LS. She has already shown she is capable of pulling it off inÂ this scene.
1489	AzorAhai42	2014-04-22	As long as they put her in by the very last scene in this season, they won't be late with Lady SH, she is literally the very last thing you see in book 3.Â
1490	Dany's Silver	2014-04-22	The Double Whammy of Lysa Arryn revealed as Jon Arryn's murderer followed by the introduction of Lady Stoneheart in a book that already featured the Red and Purple Weddings, and Tyrion offing Shae and especially Tywin blew my mind. I predict that the Unsullied will break the internet (not just twitter) when this year's season finale goes down,Â  She will be there, and the shit's going to start hitting the Frey's pretty soon, too.

Really? What a tease...
1495	fangirl000	2014-04-22	I thought it would have been more thematically appropriate for her to appear at the end of the "Mother" last season, but then I realized that it a) diluted the impact of the Red Wedding to immediately turn that death around, and  they didn't have anything for her to do for most of Season 4. Â I think they're going to bring her in as the shocking ending shot for the very last episode of season 4. Â

Looking for validation? That's a little bit much. If I wanted validation I would be asking everyone on here to agree with me. There is no validation in opinions anyway. I did not predict the future, just made a comment about a possible reaction the unsullied/critics could have to a controversial character.

I am really looking forward to Lady Stoneheart! In my opinion, they need to show LSH to keep supporting the magic and supernatural elements in the show. It needs to be seen that a not-so-fresh corpse can indeed be reanimated to reinforce the appearnces of the wights, and hopefully support the resurrection of one certain Mountain-sized monster later down the road. At this point, I like to think that the general population of viewers who have not/will not read the books have accepted that there is a large supernatural element to the Westros universe.
Â 
And I totally think they are saving her for the last episode cliffhanger

I pretty much figured out the only other place for her than season 4 finale is season 3 finale. When that didn't happen, the only option is ep.10 this year. It's just too good of a cliffhanger not to use.

1508	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-22	Don't know why people didn't expect it to be the finale to this season since it happened at the end of ASOS and would be the perfect way for the season to end. The finale of S3 would have been too soon and would've just reduced a lot of the impact of the RW.

Having it a mere episode after the Red Wedding would diminish the effect of it. One minute she's dead, the next she's alive? Nah, would be much more effective as the closing to Season 4; running virtually parallel to the book's timeline.Â

Well I myself expected it a little because of the title Mhysa and Djawadi's track of the same name - it just had this little gong in the end and I thought it would be when she opens her eyes  I'm just so anxious to see what she looks like on the show.
1511	Strong Belwas!	2014-04-22	I would like the last scene of season 4 would be Arya aboards a Braavos ship, she hand over a coin to the captain, saying the word "Vala morghulis"


Â I would like for that scene to be followed up by Lady Stoneheart. That would be just the type of season ending cliff hanger to build up mystery, suspense and get people talking. It seems like the perfect season ending scene which is probably why they won't use it. I kept holding out hope last season that Coldhands would be the final scene.
1512	yushkevitch	2014-04-22	I never liked the idea of LS in the books so I won't weep if she doesn't make an appearance. Besides, the writers are pretty smart guys, they can work around not having a relatively minor character in the show. If they can somehow find the strength and courage to not include Belwas (who is going to eat the locusts? Daario? ), excluding LS should be easy.
Â 
Call me old-fashioned but I'd rather characters that die stay dead (with the exception of Beric who had already died a few times before we even meet him.)
1513	flamingothegreen	2014-04-22	I agree about it being the last scene in the finale of season four. I'm really excited for it as well, and I never even considered that they may not add it in. It would be a great cliffhanger and the unsullied will be surprised. I know a lot unsullied I met did not like the Catelyn portrayed in the show though, so I'm not sure how fond of her reappearance.
Â 
I think they've been setting up LS pretty well since we met BWB in season three, dropping subtle hints every now and then. I honestly think S4 finale will be the best one yet.
Â 
Â 
Edit: I also loved Michelle and have no complaints about her returning. c: Plus, I think they made it clear through interviews - to book or spoiler readersÂ - that Michelle wasn't off the show for good. o: I also never really liked the idea of "returning from the dead" however it does seem to be a common theme in the series, so I think it works out okay.

Â 
I honestly thought that as well. The build up and then the 'gong' at the end really was the perfect moment for LS to open her eyes.
Â 
Although, the impact of the LS reveal will probably be allot bigger for the Season 4 finale seeing as everyone thinks the RW Starks are out of the picture. I'm really hoping they have a good soundtrack for this scene.

Â 
I was looking forward to LS resurrection last season, but I get why they chose to go with her book reveal. She just doesn't have anything to do yet and it would be very anticlimactic to introduce her in such a dramatic fashion only for her to barely appear this season. Better to leave her off-screen for the time being until there's a concrete storyline for her in Season 5.

Â 
I doubt that Lady Stoneheart is a minor character, even though Martin has yet to finish TWoW and ADoS.Â  Also, D&D know the broadstrokes of what GRRM is planning for the remainder of the books, so the fact they'll be introducing her (most likely at the end of the season finale) lead me to believe that she'll be instrumental in the fallout of at least TWoW, if not ADoS.
1519	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-22	they dont have to show her body being pulled from the river. dont worry. i just hope her intro isnt hanging brienne. i hope she hangs black walder (isnt he the one who killed her?) that would be awesome.


Â I think they'll have herÂ hang someone who is recognisable as a Frey and play up the RW glee on their part like Arya killing the Frey responsible for RobbWind. It makes their death more satisfying.
Â 
However, it depends if they want to show LS as an instrument of vengeance/justice or disturb the viewers into realising Zombie Catelyn Stark is extremelyÂ merciless and hateful.
Â 
The problem is they didn't show GreatJon during the RW (although he has been shown in several of Robb's scenes) so Merrett being responsible for getting him drunk doesn't really fit in well.
Â 
They might just go with a nameless Frey because they still need the recognisable ones like Black Walder for later scenes e.g. Jaime at Riverrun and some Freys enjoying a little pie at Ramsay's wedding. Although, Ramsay and Roose eating the pie is still good...they might even throw in Walder for that sceneÂ since he seemed to have a 'haha, we're so evil and cool' bond going on with Roose and the actor is one of the recognisable ones for being Filtch in Harry Potter so they might want to take advantage of that.
Â

Â 
That's exactly what I was thinking when I wrote my comment! 
Â 
I doubt they wanted it to happen that way. Opening scene of Season 3 was actually filmed at the very end of their shooting schedule and I imagine the show probably ran out of money by that time. Definitely anticlimactic after the epic scene to close out the previous season. Unfortunate, but there it is.

1521	Sasha Steelsong	2014-04-22	It's getting pretty late in the game. Unless they're going for extra soggy...did they cut LS? I'd be pretty bummed. Although given the next episode title is Oathkeeper, it makes sense episode 4, if any would have it.Â 
If they cut her and added that Jaime rape scene, I'd say they thoroughly botched they are 2/4 this season so far...


Â 
If they cut her I'll really be ticked but I hardly think it is too late. Â Yes we know from being told later that she was revived like a day or two after the Red Wedding (I think they took some time to throw her into the river), but she doesn't actually show up again or even get a mention in SOS till the epilogue. Â Theoretically she could have already "risen" and like in the books we won't see it till the end.Â 
Â 
My bet is she is the last scene set in Ep. 10 - heck maybe even the last scene. Â I think they'll show Lysa die and have "only Cat" and then see her back from the dead.Â 
Â 
ETA: Â Truth be told as long as it isn't like last season's Dany Crowd Surfing scene I will be pleased.

Â 
both will happen, indeed. she'll still be recognizable, but zombielike as well. LB becomes lord of the vale and he's already taken Sansa with him.
1528	Zman1863	2014-04-22	I've skimmed this thread and I couldn't see that anyone had mentioned this already. At the beginning of Arya's segment in "Two Swords" wasn't there a body they passed with a noose around its neck? Seemed like a pretty good indication that LS is still happening to me.Â
1529	drayrock	2014-04-22	As long as they put her in by the very last scene in this season, they won't be late with Lady SH, she is literally the very last thing you see in book 3.Â 


Yeah but the timelines are different. And I don't think you can do it the same way as the book. I think you have to show her being revived....And maybe her eyes opening are the last thing you see?Â
1530	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-22	Yeah but the timelines are different. And I don't think you can do it the same way as the book. I think you have to show her being revived....And maybe her eyes opening are the last thing you see?Â 


May i ask whats wrong with the timeline that cant be worked around? (i cant see it but im not the quickest on the uptake)
1531	rmholt	2014-04-23	I'd like to see her greet Ryman Frey as her opener.
1532	milkofthepoppy	2014-04-23	I hadn't expected her to be revived until late this season (keeping in line with the books)  but I am surprised that they didn't show the Arya-warging-Nymeria scene, seeing Cat in the water. That must be why OP thought it might be too late to introduce LSH. 
I wasn't a big fan of Cat, but LSH is such a major piece of information regarding resuscitation. Beric fought and died for the people of the countryside-- thus coming back multiple times with (albeit, less memory) the same MO. LSH with vengeance on the mind murders all who did her wrong (people guilty by association, even).
IF (and this really is a huge IF, I'm just thinking and typing here) Jon is revived by Rh'llor's kiss...what will his consciousness be?
1533	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-23	Â

Â 
Having it a mere episode after the Red Wedding would diminish the effect of it. One minute she's dead, the next she's alive? Nah, would be much more effective as the closing to Season 4; running virtually parallel to the book's timeline.Â 

Â 


Â 
1) Title was Mhysa
2) Robb's last word was "Mother"
3) "For The Realm" OST never featured, and sounded like something the BWB would play AND say while resurrecting her
4) The talk of resurrection in 3x06
5) "Can you bring a man back without a head"
Â 
~~Anyway, it was possible, but I agree now it's more effective closing Season 4. Â I think most of us were being impatient if anything.
Â 
I think the fact Catelyn didn't have a major presence in Season 3 is strongly because we haven't seen the last of her.
1534	Lord Varys	2014-04-23	The fact that they had Sansa mention the fact that Catelyn's throat was cut to the bone before she was thrown into the river, strongly suggests that this will become important later on. Why the hell would they introduce the BWB - Thoros and Beric - in the first place if they would not to include UnCat? They are not important, thus it would have been easily to cut them and give Arya either a longer stay in Harrenhal or a longer traveling time with Gendry and Hot Pie...
1535	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-23	Also, they can't cut her because I want a crackvid of her with the beginning ofÂ Eminem's "Without me" playing on the background.
1536	sati	2014-04-23	Yeah but the timelines are different. And I don't think you can do it the same way as the book. I think you have to show her being revived....And maybe her eyes opening are the last thing you see?Â 


Â 
I think seeing Thoros by her side, the dude TV audience remembers and the most vivid memory they have is him resurrecting Beric, is gonna be enough to indicate what happened. I'm hoping they keep 'we found her 3 days after/she don't speak but she remembers' lines.

1537	Theladystoneheart	2014-04-23	I will be really disappointed if they do not bring LS to the series as I think she is a great part of the book  But I also think if they do the season finale would be the best time to perhaps introduce her.
1538	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-23	I would be very mad if they cut the "rise and run with us" - Arya's wolf dream. They cut too much of Arya's supernatural / wolfish stuff already.Â  
Â 
Aside from this, I doubt it has been cut.
Â 
Â
1539	My_Name_Is_Reek	2014-04-23	I can already picture thousands of eyes rolling in unison when the non-readers see that part
Â 
It may be an unpopular opinion, but I'd rather they cut it. That is, unless she does something extremely important in WoW, which, I admit, seems quite likely
Â 
In any case, I think her reveal is season finale material


I hope they cut her out too. Hated her in the books - will hate her even more on TV.
1540	sati	2014-04-23	I would be very mad if they cut the "rise and run with us" - Arya's wolf dream. They cut too much of Arya's supernatural / wolfish stuff already.Â

I really don't think we're getting the dream. The show's treatment of wolves is pretty awful.
1541	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-23	Let's hope so.
Â 
I mean, if they decided to cut the awesome Coldhands, I don't see why they'd have a problem cutting lame Stoneheart.
Â 
But we'll see.
1542	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-23	Truth be told as long as it isn't like last season's Dany Crowd Surfing scene I will be pleased.That scene still angers me. Terrible.
1543	Seneti	2014-04-23	Â I think they'll have herÂ hang someone who is recognisable as a Frey and play up the RW glee on their part like Arya killing the Frey responsible for RobbWind. It makes their death more satisfying.
Â 
However, it depends if they want to show LS as an instrument of vengeance/justice or disturb the viewers into realising Zombie Catelyn Stark is extremelyÂ merciless and hateful.
Â 
The problem is they didn't show GreatJon during the RW (although he has been shown in several of Robb's scenes) so Merrett being responsible for getting him drunk doesn't really fit in well.
Â 
They might just go with a nameless Frey because they still need the recognisable ones like Black Walder for later scenes e.g. Jaime at Riverrun and some Freys enjoying a little pie at Ramsay's wedding. Although, Ramsay and Roose eating the pie is still good...they might even throw in Walder for that sceneÂ since he seemed to have a 'haha, we're so evil and cool' bond going on with Roose and the actor is one of the recognisable ones for being Filtch in Harry Potter so they might want to take advantage of that.
Â 
Â  Â Although, to be fair that is exactly what the Season 2 finale with the White Walkers was.


Â 
Uh... I think the only truly recognizable TV-Frey, at least for TV viewers, is Lord Walder himself and given that his family in itself is a Cast of Snowflakes, I don't think there'll be a "recognizable Frey". I think they will either:
Â 
- introduce her with the hanging of a Frey whom they identify as such with a view lines of dialogue just before his death
- introduce her with the hanging of Brienne
Â 


Â 
1) Title was Mhysa
2) Robb's last word was "Mother"
3) "For The Realm" OST never featured, and sounded like something the BWB would play AND say while resurrecting her
4) The talk of resurrection in 3x06
5) "Can you bring a man back without a head"

Â

Â 
I agree. Back when ep. 3/10 rolled around, I was sure they were going to have LS in there, but since they didn't, it will most likely be ep. 4/10 (preferably right after "Only Cat").

- introduce her with the hanging of Brienne


Â 
I think Black Walder is fairly recognizable- he gut stabbed Talisa and slit Catelyn's throat.Â Also, he'sÂ the only Frey (besides Lord Walder and Roslin) who has had lines e.g. "Why? Do you want toÂ count her teeth?" when Edmure asked to see Roslin, and he was the oneÂ joking with Talisa during the wedding about how expensive the musicians were...sick git.
Â 
Also, the Frey responsible for RobbWind said "Black Walder shut her up right fast" when mocking Catelyn's death which leads me to believe Stoneheart might be hanging him- the man who killed her, Talisa and her unbornÂ grandchild.
Â 
I'm really hoping the LS introduction won't be hanging Brienne. It won' t give us time to appreciate RW/Frey vengeance before seeing LS as an unreasonable monster and bad guy.

I'm all for LS, as long as they don't make her look like a zombie.


She has to look like she has been in a river for 3 days, I'll be disappointed if she doesn't have bits missing. If we have to have her back then they should at least get it right in that respect
Â 


Love the idea of it transitioning from Lysa's death to SH. Couldn't agree more on the S3 last shot....that was just awful.


Â 
It really was poor, another example of the need to spoon feed the show audience, rather than letting people work stuff out for themselves


Call me old fashioned too, but i'd rather the story be told the way the author wants it to be.

Â 
 
Â 
Having her look non-decomposed just makes it seem as if a character has been brought back to life. They really need to empathise that Lady Stoneheart is the product of the RW and show usÂ what the Freys have made of her- this includes the treatment of her body. Personally, I think LS adds to the darkness and haunting atmosphere of the Red Wedding. It wouldÂ diminish itÂ if she still looks beautiful.
Â 
She isn't Catelyn anymore, she is Lady Stoneheart- tragic, vengeful, terrible...the stuff of nightmares.

I really hope it's Stark theme, to emphasize the connection to the vengeance, not what brought her back. I seriously can't figure out just what the hell they'll play during ep.9 ending, Lord of Light theme doesn't seem right, thanks to such an abundance of scenes with Mel I think it became her theme inadvertently :/
1555	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Well they played it with the BWB, so it seems to be more the R'hllor theme than anything. I hope they play the King's Arrival when Stan shows up. For LSHÂ Ramin may actually come up with an entirely new theme.

Â  Â It honestly baffles me how people want LS cut.Â  Why!?
Â 
I think the viewers will love this cliffhanger, especially if they go with the RW vengeance themeÂ (which people really want) rather than jumping straight to the Brienne/Lady Stoneheart confrontation. The Red Wedding has been the most impactful/iconic scene of the series so far and Catelyn was central to that so seeing her return as a monster is heart-breaking, yet the notion of revenge is exciting. She keeps the North/Frey arc going rather than having all those scenes dedicated to Robb being for nothing other than just to end in defeat.
Â 
This will be the best cliffhanger yet!
Â 
Lady Stoneheart adds a whole new dynamic to the show- beautiful and loving mother turned into a vengeful zombie! This isn't Catelyn returned from the dead, she isn't Catelyn anymore...which people seem to miss. 
Â 
Also, lots of characters are dying this season so bringing back one will be a pleasant surprise...although, I think people would've preferred Ned. lol

Â 
Personally, I don't like how it cheapens the impact of the Red Wedding, and, more importantly, cheapens the impact of character deaths in general. Once you start introducing the concept of death not necessarily being final, the stakes start dropping since the reader/viewer never knows what other things you may reduce to suddenly undo.
Â 
Dead characters should stay dead.

Â 
As for the decayed body - Its magic and fantasy so that trumps reality. I will be happy if they keep the 'grey' colour makeup theme that has been alluded to, with suitably gruesome neck scarring.

Lol you're getting two Freys mixed up. Remember it was Black Walder and the Lame Walder? that negotiated the wedding terms at Riverrun. And it was the Walder with the limp that toldÂ Talisa how expensive the band was and also the one who stabbed her. Black Walder killed Cat.

Â 
I disagree. Death (your own) shouldn't be a "transformative experience" it should be final. And its not just about cheapening the Red Wedding, its also about cheapening death itself. Now that the precedent has been set that Beric isn't a special snowflake (or AA), it opens up the doors to anyone coming back. We already know that Jon will, and there could easily be others. Its as bad as the fakeouts that GRRM uses so often, once or twice is fine, but almost every POV character has now had a cliffhanger where they may have died, but then they haven't.
Â 
Â 


Good Lord. Stoneheart's vengeful existence is worse than death. It adds to RW tragedy.


Â 
How? Unless/until she kills an ally or family member, she's become the avenging angel of the wronged. Its tragic for her, being nothing else then that, but its a triumph for the anti-Frey cause.

Yep they sure do. It's easy to get those stupid weasel faces mixed up. And I bet you're right about lame Walder going first. From reading the books Black Walder always seemed like the heir apparent to take over the Frey brood once Walder died.

1575	LordStoneheart	2014-04-24	@Fez, well the fake-outs are both just the style he uses to keep pages turning after spending time screenwriting in Hollywood, but also they just make sense. Take Arya's death fake out. The Hound has to knock her out to get her away from the RW to save her, so that chapter ends with her getting knocked out. Sure, it's a "fake out" but it keeps the pages turning, it keeps people guessing. That's just good storytelling. As far as cheapening death itself, I think we'll just have to disagree. I think it makes death more sacred. We've only had Beric and Catelyn come back. No one else really has unless you count theories, which I don't yet. But that's not a good life for either of them. I love what Catelyn is doing now but I hate that this is the life she has. It's worse than death. She's rotting. Her skin is falling off her face. She can't talk because her throat is still slit. I think she doesn't eat or sleep (that could be Mel, or something else.) All this just makes death look preferable instead of a half-life, or even less than half life.
Â 
I absolutely love revenge stories. With every Frey gone I'm gonna feel a bit better about the RW... but I would never call her an "angel" because of it. More like demon now. Nothing wrong with that, but her story is definitely not to be seen in a "good" light.Â
1576	Rashtibram	2014-04-24	IMO simply introducing the concept of resurrection into a story famed for its "no one is safe" atmosphere is invariably going to cheapen the suspense and impact of the narrative, no matter how tortured an existence the resurrected characters may have.

I can see your point of view, however the concept was introduced before her with Beric and will probably be employed to even greater extent in new book, considering how people already don't think a certain person will stay dead. At least with her it's a much, much changed person from the one we knew.

1582	VladimirDulud	2014-04-27	I think they'll cut Lady Stoneheart.
Â 
Michelle Fairley's IMDB page, which usually is updated with a performer's work, makes no mention of the role.
Â 
Of course, they could use another actress, wearing heavy make-up, in her stead, though I doubt they'd do that.
Â 
Fairley, in several interviews, gave the impression that it truly final.
Â 
Someone asked her, 'is this it?' and she replied, that it was.
Â 
It would seem to be in keeping with the showrunners' subdued approach to the fantastical elements of the show, as well.
Â 
Though of course I'd love to see her onscreen - I don't see much evidence for it.
Â 
Here's hoping some of you do?
Â
1583	LordStoneheart	2014-04-27	They'd definitely keep this secret, andÂ I think with technology and the state LS is supposed to be in they can use Michelle Fairley's likeness without having to keep her around physically.
1584	Rashtibram	2014-04-27	As has been cited quite a lot with regards to this issue, they kept Jason Mamoa's cameo a complete secret for his appearance in the finale of season 2. They're quite good at keeping such things hidden from the general populace, and they're certainly not going to confirm it in interviews prior to the season's airing or update Fairley's IMDB page to include Lady Stoneheart.

I disagree. Death (your own) shouldn't be a "transformative experience" it should be final. And its not just about cheapening the Red Wedding, its also about cheapening death itself. Now that the precedent has been set that Beric isn't a special snowflake (or AA), it opens up the doors to anyone coming back. We already know that Jon will, and there could easily be others. Its as bad as the fakeouts that GRRM uses so often, once or twice is fine, but almost every POV character has now had a cliffhanger where they may have died, but then they haven't.
Â 
Â 


I agree to a certain extent about cheapening death.
So far we had people escaping death due to
supernatural events (Dany at Drogo's funeral pyre)
extreme luck (Tyrion and Arya have been exposed to multiple dangers and even though they are both resourceful, they were also quite lucky as well)
importance(lots of people are convinced that Jon will survive or he will be somehow resurrected. In any case he is too important to die just like that)
Cat was one of the major POV characters, and her tragic demise was one of the most crucial events in the books.
Her return was a shock, but somehow I am not convinced that she came back just to avenge the Freys and the Lannisters.
Both Houses are already in the self destruct mode.
Besides, Bran gaining supernatural abilities, Sansa trained in diplomacy, Arya becoming a skilled assassin and Rickon possibly returning to the North under the protection of Wyman Manderly, suggest that the children are better candidates for Stark revenge and restoration.
Â 
It could be that she will lead the BWB against the Freys and Lannisters, and use Daven's wedding as the perfect occasion to avenge Robb and Ned.
Â 
Â 
So far we have seen very little of LS. She had a cameo appearance in SOS and she became more prominent in FFC.
The thing is that I don't think that she is there simply to kill her enemies and the people who wronged her.
Since I think that it would be anticlimactic for Jaime and/or Brienne to die at her hands in WOW, Â Â 
Likewise, her getting killed during a raid against Lannisters and Freys or even killed by Jaime or Brienne, would be anticlimactic as well.
Â 
Â 
The main problem that I have with Cat's ressurection, is that I think that it would have been better if she hadn't died at all.
If Cat was lost, or presumed dead, like Arya, and somehow she ended up as a leader of the BWB I would have liked it more.
Are you familiar with Sweeney Todd the Musical?
The original story, was not about revenge, but once it was adapted to a musical, the cruel murderer became more sympathetic. Benjamin Barker was a well respected and loved barber, who was wrongfully imprisoned and forced to leave his family. After years, he returns back home, his new name is Sweeney Todd and all he wants is revenge.
Â 
I would have liked it more if Cat returned as LS without the need to include a resurrection, in a similar manner to Barker's return as Sweeney Todd.
1590	DixiesArcher	2014-04-27	Checking IMDB for roles is no good theyre not that dumb to give away things like that.
1591	rmholt	2014-04-27	IMO the replacement of Beric Dondarrion Zombie with Cat Zombie represents the decline of the good Robin Hood BWB into a gang of bitter merciless gangsters.  Re animation south of the wall seems to make the zombie a more pure form of the human's basic nature. Of course I think Cat was a bitter, manipulative, inept, vengeful, paranoid creep when alive.

Â 
Close, but you're way off. It was the beginning of the BWB actually taking charge, giving fairer trials, and slowly giving up the lie to themselves that they were fighting for the greater good only.Â

Â 
Alternatively.... 
Â 
I like the idea of LSH being part of the endgame of ASoIaF, and not just a vengeful zombie (although, I will enjoy seeing some of those cuntmouthed Freys slain).Â  As much as I suspect that Jon will eventually wield Lightbringer, perhaps LSH's interactions with Brienne and Jaime will lead to the realization that Oathkeeper is Lightbringer, but it needs to be triggered somehow?Â  Thoros might also be instrumental in that regard..
Â 
My mom has finally listened to me and started reading the books (she started halfway through ASOS yesterday afternoon), and when she finished last night, I got a call with her saying, "Holy shit! She's alive!"Â  She was pretty happy about that. Also, my mom says re: Lysa, "She's fucking crazy." Â  Now she says that she wants to know what's happening for the rest of the series, but that I'm not going to let her off the book about reading AGoT and ACoK.
1594	Keishi of Oldstones	2014-05-02	Probably the last thing we see this season will be Stoneheart's reveal either when Nymeria and BwB find her body or when she is already Stoneheart hanging Freys.
1595	Mr Smith	2014-04-21	When it comes to character assassination, most of the discussion is inevitably about Stannis, given a series of poor writing choices last season. In the background however, Aiden Gillen has quietly been taking great dialogue and turning it into a series of creepy, ominous rasps that shatter the subtlety of the excellent material he has to work with. His mediocrity and lack of presence permeated parts of last season as well, but today's episode was the last straw for me, particularly as it overshadowed some outstanding work from Sophie Turner. Lets start with this ridiculous accent he's acquired. It didn't pop up until the second season (the first was by far his best, funny that). It reduces his flexibility in delivery, and makes every line he says sound creepy. But Littlefinger isn't always creepy; he has the ability to be charming, particularly when 'seducing' the trust of many noble lords and ladies. Next is his lack of presence. Admittedly, Littlefinger shouldn't actually have much of a presence; he's a man who stays in the background, offering a few choice words at opportune moments. Gillen misinterprets this completely, and tries to create a presence with exaggerated, sweeping movements, drawing far too much attention to himself. He was at his worst today, with him leaning in so close to Sansa he might have been a vampire trying to bite her, all the while rasping in her ear.
Â 
This probably sounds a little harsh, but no harsher than the various criticisms of D & D. In this case, I don't even put this down as a miscast by them, as Aiden Gillen was a perfectly adequate, though not outstanding, Littlefinger back in season 1. But he has now lost any sense of subtlety, and has turned the character into an outright villain rather than a man of highly ambiguous motives. He's two dimensional, and worse, he's boring.
Â 
Feel free to disagree.
1596	Adhara	2014-04-23	Agree.

Hulking over Sansa like Nosferatu.
I expect him to break out in a Snidely Whiplash hand-twirl at any moment.

ETA: Well, he was trusted with securing the Tyrell/Lannister alliance but the writers say in interviews he's not trustworthy which is wrong.

1599	Ser Bran Stark	2014-04-23	I completely agree, the fact that he straight up told Cersei in a previous season that he knew of her twincest in front of guards was the first lapse. No way would the real LF ever do that or would he ever talk to Sansa about taking her away in KL with all the little birds in audience.Â Of course this has more to do with writing than his actual performance.Â Overall the series has been incredible butÂ there has been a few things that have ticked me off with D&D. The fact that Robb and Talisa got married in the fashion of the seven, and it looks like the first reveal of Braavos will be through Stannis???? I understand adding to his story but why not go to Myr or Pentos? Now when Arya goes to Braavos it will be underwhelmingÂ because we've already seen it! I felt that was an important aspect to her story seeing Braavos for the first time through her eyes. The Bran and Rickon reveal was weak as well,Â sorry off topic but other than that and the skipping of several important battles(whispering wood, oxcross, NW vs others, and Reek switcheroo) D&D have done well.
1600	Colonel Green	2014-04-24	I understand adding to his story but why not go to Myr or Pentos?


Presumably because they want him to deal with the Iron Bank of Braavos.
Â 
Regarding the original subject, I'm hoping that the extended interactions between Sansa and Littlefinger will lead to the writers putting a bit more variation into how they write the character.
1601	Ice Wolf	2014-04-24	Couldn't agree more, his performance last week was cringeworthy. He was perfectly acceptable in Season 1 and has simply deteriorated each season since. I can't fathom how they can get Varys so right and Littlefinger so wrong.

Â 
I think this is purely the result of the two formats. I think George is wrong here.
Â 
George can leave things out because of the "point of view" nature of the novels, but the television show would really struggle with such scant detail on certain points.
Â 
Additionaly the audience will never ever trust Littlefinger again after what he did to Ned, so trying to uphold a sense of trustworthiness with him is futile with the TV audience.
Â 
Having said that, the show's characters DO trust him. Cersei did, and truthfully probably still does (her scene was about power, not trust with him), Tyrion trusted him, Robert trusted him, Tywin trusts him ... In fact most of the players left in King's Landing save for Varys trust him in some way.
Â 
The difference really is we don't get points of view in the show, we get a more objective look, giving him a much less trustworthy appearance.

Â 
Agreed, the voice is terrible ... It just gets raspier for some stupid reason!Â 
Â 
Maybe he's auditioning to be the next Batman?
Â 
As for book comparisions ... I disagree ... Varys is as much different in the show as he is in the book.Â
1604	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-24	Yeah, sucks to say it but Gillen has been increasingly awful since season 2. The OP nailed it; it's the raspy voice, the teatrical movements, the overtly creepy/mustache-twirling vibe.Â 
Â 
It really, really took me out of the scene in this episode. I honestly couldn't focus on anything other than that cringe-worthy performance.
Â 
I just don't see how is it that no one has told him how horrible that voice comes off, really
1605	voodooqueen126	2014-04-24	Didn't GRRM once say on his LJ, that he based/his Littlefinger has a lot in common with Jay Gatsby, whilst the show creation was another matter entirely?
1606	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-24	tbh, I think LF is cartoonish IN books. And even though I like him, there are moments when he's so insufferable to read because he's so full of himself. In his last scene of Feast, when he's telling Sansa about his plans, it's like the villain monologuing before he gets killed.
Â 
Now I think about it, he reminds me of Fiona in Josie and the Pussycats, the movie (yeah, I've seen the movie...). Fiona sets up a humongous plan involving the government, the FBI, the police, Hollywood and the music industry, even trying to kill two of the Pussycats and brainwashing Josie, with the only purpose of broadcasting a subliminal message during a massive pay-per-view concert that orders people to think she's cool because she was unpopular in High School.

Josie and the Pussycats is the best movie ever!

Â 
Â 
I agree with your take on it here. I think because the audience lacks POV insight, which for most characters in King's Landing they revealed that they trusted LF but were also wary of him. Also agree that after the major reveals of his connection in Ned's death - ther was no way the audience was going to trust him ever again even if characters in the book still do.
Â 
It's more difficult to show that trust the show - and he comes across over the top skeevy when in the books he was also skeevy but from the point of view of others who each had their reasons for listening to Littlefinger and needing / wanting connection to him. He was always wheeling and dealing like a bad car salesman with really good one liners. I just think it's very difficult to portray that well in the show even with a super great actor. Aiden Gillen may have been cast more for his looks (which is IMO a dead ringer for LF) than for his ability to pull it off well. Then again it could be bad directing or dialogue. I don't find his raspy accent as offensive as others do but maybe I'm just being more tolerant.Â 
Â 
There were some great interactions between him and Varys in previous seasons - some of the sharpest verbal sparring they had in the show, really. With his change of plot, his character has seemed to go downhill ever since.

1608	Northern_Star	2014-04-24	Stop bashing the actor! I find it too harsh that people blame the actor - its not bad acting at all, the actors just do what the directors are asking of them. This episode just had some poor directing, tywin shouting that noone is allowed to leave kings landing for example. It looks like they shot this scene seperate from the others probably not even at the set. Why else wouldnt they show tywin yelling it out while standing beside his dead grandson.

Â 
I don't think the director is going to tell him what accent to use! That said, I've seen him in a few things, and his latest voice does seem more like his real irishÂ voice with raspy undertone. He sounded somewhat similar (and again a bit odd) as David Morrisey's mate in theÂ serial 'Thorne'.
Â 
He should have been the perfect choice for the role, can't blame casting choice really,Â but somehow he hasn't quite clicked into the part like almost everyone else in the show. I think the dialogue for him has been fine and the storyline had to beÂ presented a bit differently for the format as mentioned upthread ('butchery' and 'character assassination' are already in the self-parady territory on this board!). It's his rather wooden delivery that's the problem most of the time isn't it?Â It's is a bit odd - he should be doing better.

							Edited by Zorn Gottes, 24 April 2014 - 03:26 AM.
1611	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-24	I highly suspect the change in voice since season 1 is a production request "Make Baelish more sinister" and Gillan has responded by attempting a gravelly voice. I am with those not impressed and who just don't buy into it. I don't blame Gillan for that though.Â
1612	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	Actually the gravelly whispery aspect of the voice was present even in season one. He often talked in a much more conversational British-sounding voice but even then he would occasionally go into the more scratchy voice. He just let that dominate his characterization more and more. He still goes into the softer voice that he used most often in season one in season three and in this episode for some lines. I don't know what his rationale for going back and forth is but whatevs, that's just what he does.
Â 
I'm used to it and have gotten to be fine with it. Especially after noticing that his accent inconsistencies actually started as early as when we first met him (they were much less noticeable of course, but they were still there). He's been consistently inconsistent, if you will. I don't know if that's necessarily reassuring but hell, he's our LF. And he does do an excellent trolling face.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 24 April 2014 - 03:44 AM.
1613	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-24	I have seen one theory on here about the change in accent (I apologise I can't remember who it was, so I take no credit for this) that maybe it has changed because he is now away from KL and doesn't have to maintain his "court" voice so has reverted back to his low class accent. An interesting concept, would be nice to see an interview with Gillan or director to talk about the change in this character. I really like him in the books so want to see him done more justice in the show.Â
1614	DolorousKim	2014-04-24	In my opinion, Aidan Gillen's performance isn't as bad as all that.Â  For example, I really enjoy every dialog that he shares with Varys, even though none of these scenes originally appeared in the books.Â  To me, they are prime examples of what can be so rewarding about the show's "add on" scenes.Â 
Â 
To my mind, the absolute worst Littlefinger scene was his confrontation with Cersei, (a prime example of what can go very, very wrong with the show's add on scenes).Â  Even in this instance, what went wrong with this scene was more due to the fact that the dialog and blocking was so clunky and unsubtle, rather than it being a case of poor performances of the actors involved.Â  It was a misguided attempt at demonstrating Cersei's power base, and shouldn't have been done at all.Â  Its awfulness wasn't really due to Aidan Gillen's acting.
Â 
In this most recent episode, I thought that he successfully drove home just how cringeworthy Littlefinger's obsession with Sansa is.Â  Here's our long suffering Sansa finally believing that she has escaped the nightmare that was King's Landing and that she is being brought to a place of safety from where she will eventually be allowed to "go home," only to find that she is now at the dubious mercy of Littlefinger, who is far, far worse a fiend than she imagined.Â  Baelish is a very creepy dude with huge issues and no appreciable sense of morality, and I thought that Gillen was quite effective in conveying that in this scene.
Â 
I'm not overly fussed with the whole accent issue, but then I'm also not bothered by Peter Dinklage's accent either.Â  Perhaps my ears just aren't sensitive to what so many others find jarring about the delivery on the part of these two actors.Â  In my mind, I just put it down to "regional dialect differences" and leave it at that.

Â 

Â 
There's a reason for that I posted this in the other LF thread: People should ask themselves why he picked a mockingbird for his sigil, his family Coat of arms has a giant as far as i can remember.
1616	Lord Varys	2014-04-24	I don't see a reason why they should not have portrayed Littlefinger in a sympathetic, non-threatening way after season 1. In the book, Littlefinger's betrayal of Ned comes off more funny then evil 'I told you not to trust me, you know' is no threatening line. What did Ned expect? Installing Stannis as king would have meant the end of his career and/or his head. Pretty much any ambitious politician would have behaved like Littlefinger in this situation.
Â 
It would have been easy enough to portray Littlefinger as a funny, non-threatening guy who is mostly friends with good and bad guys alike. He should only become really threatening this season, when people begin to realize what this guy can pull off while feigning to be non-threatening and likable.
Â 
They pretty much butchered the whole character:
Â 
1. Littlefinger is no pimp, he is a businessman investing in brothels. He does not spend his leisure/work hours there, his brothel is not the treasury, and he does not personally train, educate, or oversee his whores.
Â 
2. Littlefinger does not appear threatening or allow anyone to realize/deduce where his true interests lie. He acts carefully through agents (Dontos, Lothor Brune, the Kettleblacks), and does not approach his targets directly (Sansa!).
Â 
3. Littlefinger never threatens or antagonizes anyone openly. If he is humiliated or fooled, he swallows and secretly plots murder, but he does not threaten anyone with a higher political standing directly (Tyrion, Cersei).
Â 
4. Littlefinger does not explain or discuss his motivations or goals with Varys. They may talk to each other occasionally, but I very much doubt that they would do this in the manner the show presents it. Littlefinger and Varys are not chaos vs. order, but two political schemers who are trying to achieve different goals. But they do use pretty much the same means, when they deem them necessary. Varys is also an agent of chaos - in favor of his Aegon plans, which are not ready at this point. He most certainly is not principally opposed to the means Littlefinger uses.
Â 
In conclusion one can say that there is nothing left from GRRM's Littlefinger in this show, and if the show was imagining the 'realistic Westeros' GRRM has invented, the TV version of Littlefinger would not survive a day in this world. The core of the character is that he is non-threatening, friends with everyone, who is smart enough to move up the ladder when no one is looking (or caring).

In the book, Littlefinger's betrayal of Ned comes off more funny then evil 'I told you not to trust me, you know' is no threatening line. What did Ned expect? Installing Stannis as king would have meant the end of his career and/or his head. Pretty much any ambitious politician would have behaved like Littlefinger in this situation.
Â 
It would have been easy enough to portray Littlefinger as a funny, non-threatening guy who is mostly friends with good and bad guys alike. He should only become really threatening this season, when people begin to realize what this guy can pull off while feigning to be non-threatening and likable.
Â 
They pretty much butchered the whole character:
Â 
1. Littlefinger is no pimp, he is a businessman investing in brothels. He does not spend his leisure/work hours there, his brothel is not the treasury, and he does not personally train, educate, or oversee his whores.
Â 
2. Littlefinger does not appear threatening or allow anyone to realize/deduce where his true interests lie. He acts carefully through agents (Dontos, Lothor Brune, the Kettleblacks), and does not approach his targets directly (Sansa!).
Â 
3. Littlefinger never threatens or antagonizes anyone openly. If he is humiliated or fooled, he swallows and secretly plots murder, but he does not threaten anyone with a higher political standing directly (Tyrion, Cersei).
Â 
4. Littlefinger does not explain or discuss his motivations or goals with Varys. They may talk to each other occasionally, but I very much doubt that they would do this in the manner the show presents it. Littlefinger and Varys are not chaos vs. order, but two political schemers who are trying to achieve different goals. But they do use pretty much the same means, when they deem them necessary. Varys is also an agent of chaos - in favor of his Aegon plans, which are not ready at this point. He most certainly is not principally opposed to the means Littlefinger uses.
Â 
In conclusion one can say that there is nothing left from GRRM's Littlefinger in this show, and if the show was imagining the 'realistic Westeros' GRRM has invented, the TV version of Littlefinger would not survive a day in this world. The core of the character is that he is non-threatening, friends with everyone, who is smart enough to move up the ladder when no one is looking (or caring).


Â 
But on TV this would present an even worse character - a boring one! This would leave him sod all to do for three Seasons apart from count his money and whisper to a minor character in a corridor somewhere!
Â 
Noone would care if he is revealed as the grand manipulator as noone would remember who he was!
1618	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-24	Is there an interview anywhere with him where he actually addresses why he's changing his voice more rapidly than Christian Bale in the Dark Knight franchise?
1619	Lord Varys	2014-04-24	Nonsense. Littlefinger has quite a lot to do in both ACoK and ASoS that makes him interesting and memorable. He has great lines, one of them is in my signature, as it happens. People always remember the comic relief, and Littlefinger is actually a poisonous comic relief.
Â 
He would be remembered for betraying Ned, messing with Tyrion and the dagger, for his ambition regarding Harrenhal, and for successful brokering the Tyrell marriage.
Â 
I never said they could not invent additional scenes with him. Why not? All they needed to do was distort the character in those scenes. Season 3 portrays him as sort of loser, since it's evident that he does not thwart the Varys/Tyrell plot on his own design, he is recruited to do this by Cersei (just as Olenna is recruited by Varys).
Â 
If I had adapted this whole story, I'd have made it clear that Littlefinger was manipulating the other guys - that he was telling Tywin about the Tyrell plot to pursue his own agenda, and that he was suggesting to make Tyrion as match for Sansa and Master of Coin to ensure that he remains in KL for the royal wedding.
1620	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-24	As much as the voice and accent issue does bother the hell out of me, it's the Overt Creepfinger act that he has going on that is the problem.Â  I was totally taken out of the whole scene just hoping that Aiden chewed mint and had fresh breath like the real LF because he was breathing in Sophie's face entirely too close.Â  There's something wrong if I can't enjoy a scene because I'm stopping to think:Â  OMG he is just about breathing in her mouth and that may be worse than the acting.Â  Sophie did beautifully, she may deserve an emmy just for not breaking character during that breathe in her face fest full of mustache twirling type acting.Â

Â 
Yes he does, but there are also times that he's not so obviously, to Sansa, creeping all over.Â  He needs to be the friendly, not so threatening guy to her.....to lure her in and then try the creeping moves.Â  I can't imagine this LF ever being thought by Sansa to tell lies kindly.Â  Not if he's going to act as if his tongue might wind up in her mouth during every conversation.Â
1628	Jslay427	2014-04-24	Gillian is more to blame for LF then D n D. Whereas Stannis' butchery is directly attributed to D n D depicting him as a villan, not Dillanes acting, which has been superb.
1629	Conchobar	2014-04-24	I met the actor twice at a music festival called Electric Picnic, he has a pretty soft voice, he is a pretty chill cucumber, a nice guy. I like his performance in Season 1 a lot, the voice does throw me but I think that we are judging the character solely based off of the odd meeting with him in the books.
1630	IlAovatar	2014-04-24	I don't really have an issue with the way they're portraying Littlefinger. The character came across as extremely devious and untrustworthy to me fairly early on in the novels, even if actor does overdo it a little.
Â 
Overall I think it's one of the better portrayals. Not quite as flawless as Varys, but a thousand times better than what they've done with the Boltons and Daario Naharis.

1632	boojam	2014-04-24	Aiden Gillen gave an interview recently where it was said he does not like to give interviews.Tho I think he has more interviews about the show than Conleth Hill (who, as far as I know, has given only one, and that one , Red Carpet, had a pretty shallow interviewer!).Is Gillen happy with his role , I have seen this kind of acting perturbation when an actor , got into it, didn't like it or didn't understand it.I got the impression , season 2, that Carice van Houten was a bit confused or badly directed , but she came around."The night is dark and full of terrors" no longer has a falling inflection but is punctuated.She was on her marks season 3 too.Since I know Gillen is a good actor (like van Houten) could be some dissonance going on with the show and his character.(Seems to be just fine the first season.)

The actors just seem so wrong for the roles. Roose had one of the most distinct descriptions of any character in the books. I pictured him having an eerie, almost ageless appearance. The guy they picked just looks like a thousand middle aged men i've seen walking down the street... and he just doesn't have that quiet yet intimidating presence he should have, going by quotes like this: "Bolton's silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat's slobbering malevolence. Pale as morning mist, his eyes concealed more than they told."
Â 
As for Ramsay, I pictured looking like this. The actor they chose looks like he should be in a boy band, and i'm not convinced at all that he can play a truly sinister character. Almost all of his performances thus far have been more comical than disturbing.
Â 
I really hate how they changed Ramsay's storyline too. He's supposed to be in Winterfell before Theon captures it, posing as Reek.

I disagree with you on Roose, I think Â he is portrayed nearly perfectly. He is disarmingly normal in his presence, but when he speaks, there is so much weight behind his voice. I am not as convinced with Ramsay's portrayal(mostly for shallow reasons to do with the length of his hair) but there are moments that I go " That's Ramsay!" when watching him so yeah...

Â 
I just wish he could pull off the intimidating stare more the way Charles Dance can with Tywin.
1637	Hath4	2014-04-24	Rheon is good as ramsay I think he gets what he is all about, ie he loves toture flaying murder girl hunting and all sets of terrible things. He gets joy from doing those things. we have not seen his pychotic rage yet because so far everything has gone is way, though with yara on her way to attack the dreadfort, I think we will see him in rage mode during the attack.

1638	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-24	I actually didn't think he was too bad in the latest episode. While his accent was terrible and changes from appearance to appearance, he sorted of nailed that creepy aspect he has with the lack of personal space he gives Sansa. As much as he's got to be subtle and charming sometimes, this isn't really one of those moments when you consider that he condones a murder in front of Sansa. Once you take out the terrible accents, I don't think he's all that bad.
Â 
That scene wasn't really my favourite in the books either. LF's emergence as they shoot Dontos with the crossbows always made me feel like he was a bit typical villain in it.
1639	binga	2014-04-24	Roose is portrayed flawlessly. Littlefinger on the other hand has decided to adopt a Bane voice. He is at his best when he is relaxed and doing a smug version of Littlefinger. They are trying to play up this animated evil version of Littlefinger and it is failing horribly.

yeah same here.Â

Anyway, its just the voice really. Hes a creepy bastage in season 1, just not as grating to listen to. Personally, im not too arsed cuz i really loathe Littlefinger and the worse he comes off to the audience, the better for me. Srsly...
Luckily my homeboy, Varys is played to perfection.

Ok, Iwan Rheon as Ramsay is one of the best casting choices. Hes really filling that void of mad cray that Harry Lloyd's Viserys left behind. I <3 Rheon's Ramsay.

He's read all of the books, I don't know if that'll get some of you to like more.Well, personally I don't think that Gillen is a bad actor. I think that the show writers simply erred by making it too obvious that LF was untrustworthy right away. It undermines LF's greatest weapon (that people underestimate him).I think the problem is that they tried to make LF and Varys too similar due to their rivalry. They are archrivals, yes, but LF is popular and seen as an amiable fellow. Varys is openly despised and mistrusted by everyone. There are some scenes where this works -- I actually love the scenes where LF and Varys are facing off one-on-one because I feel that's really the only time where it would make sense for him to drop the mask because he knows that Varys isn't fooled. But then they have Gillen's LF do the same thing to people like Cersei, and it doesn't work as well because it doesn't make sense for the character to want to be treated like Varys is.
1651	ServantOnIce	2014-04-24	I like A.G. as Little Weasel. Â He is doing a great job, remember TV Watchers have short attention spans, many of them will never pick up the books. Â So you have to dump the subtle messages and let things fly open for them to know.
Â 
He did a great job on, "The Wire." Â I never watched an episode of, "Queer As Folk" so I can't say how he did on that show but he's good on GOT.Â
1652	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-24	The only actor who could have pulled off Roose as is depicted in the books is Alan Rickman as Snape. In fact, I'd say his Snape is more similar to book!Roose (the soft voice, overall calm and cold demeanor) than it is to book!Snape, if that makes sense.
Â 
I do like Michael's Bolton (sorry, I had to say that ) as I think it's more realistic than the book version, which I found often annoying and absurd
Â 
Ramsey annoys me in both mediums, but the show version is at least funnier, in a very dark sort of way (like when he greeted Fat Walda and called her "mother", I thought that was hilarious)

I can't think of any famous celebrities off-hand who would be perfect for the role, but generally speaking, I would have picked someone not quite so boyish. with a slightly bigger build, longer hair, and a less pretty face. Also, it would have to be someone who can pull off sadistic without making it seem comical.

While Alan Rickman playing Roose would have been the greatest thing ever, I dont want Snape and Roose blurring together like that cuz its just not right, i tells ya! 
Oh you and your pun. I like him too cuz he seems more like Mr. Unremarkable which Roose is supposed to be. Like hes supposed to be really unassuming in appearance and not stick out from the crowd much outside his House colors. So having a face that blends in with the crowd like McElhatton's is perfect. Plus once he steps up to the plate to be Mr. Smooth McNasty, he does it really well. I dont care if he doesnt sound like he does in the books. Hes got the Roose vibe anyway.Â 

Rheon can do those evil googly eyes really well. And can look positively trollish.Â  While Rheon himself is actually kinda pretty, Ramsay sure aint.

1660	digiFemme	2014-04-25	The thing about book Littlefinger is that he doesn't have a point of view so all his actions are seen through other characters thoughts (Neds, then later Tyrion and Sansa's); in a lot of ways, these characters are interpreting him in the same way that we are. While it's safe to say that he's not a good guy, the show makes it too obvious- in the same way they go the opposite direction by presenting Tyrion as too nice. Â I understand why there was a need to flesh out some characters and give them a good side to add complexity (Cersei, etc.) but show Tyrion seems a little too perfect, like he can't do anything wrong.Â 
Â 
But since most of the comments say they don't have a problem with Gillen in S1,it's probably the way his character is written and not to mention the change of accent that bothers them.Â

Â 
On Cersei - I have seen one argument about some of her changes that has some merit. Show Joff is older than Book Joff. GRRM has said that he felt Joff was still a young boy and was not necessarily irredeemable - he was a bit of a shit that had been misguided and also had way too much power. The argument goes that because show Joff was older, it made sense to make him irredeemable and they did that by giving him some of the heinous actions instead of Cersei, like the killing of the bastards. Making Cersei softer does not appear to have caused anyone to like her more so if this argument reflects what they were aiming for, then it has some merit.

Haha, love that smirk at the end. I reckon he has at least some inkling of what happens with LF; Graves said in a recent interview that if actors want to know their endgame so it helps them get into their role, they're told.
1663	SeventySeven	2014-04-25	Littlefinger makes me want to vomit in the books as well, but there's something really off about him in the show. It makes all the other characters look 15% more stupid, because they know he's not to be trusted yet they do. It makes no sense.
Â 
As for the accent, the problem is that it changes while he's talking. PD makes a crappy imitation of an English accent but at least it's consistently crappy, the actor who plays Littlefinger's accent is a never ending guess on what he's trying to channel.
Â 
He's creepy as f-ck though, so you gotta give him that.

Â 
Yeah he is creepy, but it is just far too overdone. I have to force myself to even be bothered to listen to what he has to say.
1665	Conchobar	2014-04-25	Well we didn't get a clear look but since Roose twisted his blade in ASOS, I assume they went with that too.


Yeah I dunno, we would have heard the sound of it being pulled out too though. I just always wondered with that scene lol.
1666	Oakenfist	2014-04-25	I don't think it's the actor because if you watch the first season he is doing a good job with the role. Even the second season he's fine but you can already tell he has begun tinkering with the accent and voice.
Â 
I think right now its far too comical and he is hamming it up big time, but I blame that all on the voice.
1667	yushkevitch	2014-04-25	The real issue I have with Littlefinger is, like others have pointed out, he is so over-the-top in trying to sound like a conspiring evil little weasel. Last episode was a perfectly horrific example.
Â 
He just saves Sansa by bringing her through the fog to a dark ship, all cloak-and-dagger. Now on board he wants her to trust him yet he's so overtly conniving in his words and tone it would be impossible for anyone to trust or believe him.
Â 
Imagine if you will a guy in a dark alley calls you over telling you he has authentic watches for sale. Assuming you're brave enough or foolish enough to be tempted you go over. He looks around suspiciously to make sure no one's watching, subtly opens his trench coat and whispers in the most maniacal voice "so what's your pleasure, Rolex? Tag Heuer? Cartier?" ... Hmm, authentic you say?

Â 
Perfect!!!Â  Now you're going to have me giving the side-eye to the next shift dude I spot wearing a trench coat.Â
1670	Tadco26	2014-04-25	I don't see a reason why they should not have portrayed Littlefinger in a sympathetic, non-threatening way after season 1. In the book, Littlefinger's betrayal of Ned comes off more funny then evil 'I told you not to trust me, you know' is no threatening line. What did Ned expect? Installing Stannis as king would have meant the end of his career and/or his head. Pretty much any ambitious politician would have behaved like Littlefinger in this situation.Â It would have been easy enough to portray Littlefinger as a funny, non-threatening guy who is mostly friends with good and bad guys alike. He should only become really threatening this season, when people begin to realize what this guy can pull off while feigning to be non-threatening and likable.Â They pretty much butchered the whole character:Â 1. Littlefinger is no pimp, he is a businessman investing in brothels. He does not spend his leisure/work hours there, his brothel is not the treasury, and he does not personally train, educate, or oversee his whores.Â 2. Littlefinger does not appear threatening or allow anyone to realize/deduce where his true interests lie. He acts carefully through agents (Dontos, Lothor Brune, the Kettleblacks), and does not approach his targets directly (Sansa!).Â 3. Littlefinger never threatens or antagonizes anyone openly. If he is humiliated or fooled, he swallows and secretly plots murder, but he does not threaten anyone with a higher political standing directly (Tyrion, Cersei).Â 4. Littlefinger does not explain or discuss his motivations or goals with Varys. They may talk to each other occasionally, but I very much doubt that they would do this in the manner the show presents it. Littlefinger and Varys are not chaos vs. order, but two political schemers who are trying to achieve different goals. But they do use pretty much the same means, when they deem them necessary. Varys is also an agent of chaos - in favor of his Aegon plans, which are not ready at this point. He most certainly is not principally opposed to the means Littlefinger uses.Â In conclusion one can say that there is nothing left from GRRM's Littlefinger in this show, and if the show was imagining the 'realistic Westeros' GRRM has invented, the TV version of Littlefinger would not survive a day in this world. The core of the character is that he is non-threatening, friends with everyone, who is smart enough to move up the ladder when no one is looking (or caring).Â Â I agree, and I think it is the writing more so than the actor that has hurt Littlefinger.Â  I always viewed him as similar to Verbal Kint from the Usual Suspects who 
	Spoiler seems like a harmless relative nobody, only at the end do you realize his true role in it all.
 Or Ben from LOST.TV Littlefinger is a pimp with so subtlety. Instead of being a master diplomat and schemer who is pulling strings behind the scenes, he is made into a stereo typical mustache twirling villain.

Â 
He was displaying his dominance over her. He was trying to be intimidating.
1672	Mannisman	2014-04-25	I don't think that show Littlefinger is a bad character; most of my Unsullied friends think he is one of the most interesting characters on the show. The problem is that because he is presented as so overtly evil and untrustworthy, the impact of the major reveals involving him lose their weight. Whenever something major happens on the show, it is always so easy to suspect Littlefinger or Varys because the show has so explicitly told us that they are pulling all the strings. Although the LF-Varys conversations can be really cool, they are pretty unrealistic with regards to their characters and make their actions lose their subtlety.Â
1673	Conchobar	2014-04-25	Â 
Is he trolling with that last comment?


Probably lol
1674	yushkevitch	2014-04-25	Â

Â 
If that's the way you interpreted it, fair enough. It seemed to me like he was trying to get her trust, trying to convince her he's trying to help her.

Â You can do both at the same time. Keep in mind, Sansa is only like 16 years old. I've seen men like LF in real life do exactly what he was doing.
1676	Lord Varys	2014-04-25	Although I have to admit that some of the lines of the private conversations between Varys and Littlefinger are not bad, the overall setting of these conversations portray both out of character:
Â 
Littlefinger would - under no circumstances whatsoever - drop his mask when he talks to Varys. He has told Alayne in AFfC that it is especially important to remain in character when you are alone, because you can't know who's listening/about to come in. Even if Littlefinger suspected/was quite sure that Varys sees him for the person he really is - and that's very likely - he would under no circumstances help Varys deducing what he is up to by admitting that Varys assumptions/assessments of him are correct.
Â 
There would be subtext in their conversations, but it would be very subtle, perhaps subtler than anything GRRM has written so far, because these characters are truly master players.
Â 
And, in my opinion, their weird portrayal as rivals - or political manipulators who strife to create chaos (Littlefinger) and order (Varys) - makes little sense to me. They are not rivals, they are just colleagues who work together when they need to, and are at odds with each other from time to time as well, but they don't try to thwart each other's goals. Littlefinger has no clue about the Aegon plan, and when Littlefinger prevented Varys from creating an uncertain peace after Robert's death, he did not do this to thwart Varys, but to continue his rise to power. In the long run, Littlefinger's meddling with Varys' plans in AGoT has turned out to his advantage, and I guess he would even be thankful for that.
Â 
Finally, I'd like to say that Gillen is a very good cast for Littlefinger. It's clearly not his acting that's the problem here, it's his lines, and the overall interpretation of the characters by the writers that's the problem. Besides from the height, Gillen is pretty much a perfect Littlefinger as far as the looks are concerned.

Â 
His "Chaos is a ladder" speech was awesome though.
1678	Lord Varys	2014-04-25	Not really. The cutting was bad, in my opinion. It would have worked much better if we had seen him delivering the lines than cut to Sansa, and hear the words offscreen.
Â 
And then there is the fact that a man like Littlefinger would never brag in such a way about his accomplishments. He doesn't do that. The scriptwriters treat the audience like children in scenes like that. We should be able to deduce the fact that Littlefinger sees chaos as a ladder from the way he acts. He does not have to say this to us. Film is a visual medium. Show us what's happening, don't talk about it!
Â 
It would also have made much more impact if such a realization came to another character investigating Littlefinger (Tyrion, or Sansa, later on), rather than that the murderer explains us what he did and how he did it with the murder weapon still in his bloody hands...
1679	7th-key	2014-04-25	As English is not my native language, GoT is just a chaos of accents for me, and I'm not even trying to make sense of them. What did slowly start to annoy me is LF's descent into low raspy voice since season 2.
I guess it must be a new vogue for actors who want to sound intense. But I find it annoying for Batman, and even more for Littlefinger.Â
1680	A Man Has Said	2014-04-25	I've never liked the relationship between the show, the Littlefinger character and Aiden Gillen.
In the first season they were given LF way too much time onscreen.
He became the go-to guy for exposition, which I saw as having the show being actor-driven rather than plot or script driven.
Varys would have been a better person to give the 'panoptic' all-knowing explanations and histories, IMO.
Â 
Gillen was one of the few well-known (in America) actors in the cast due to his role as Baltimore's mayor in "The Wire," so they were trying to come across as 'big time' to that audience - which I don't think was that necessary.
Â 
(I know, I know - Sean Bean was THE well-known actor in the first series. For all the good it did Ned Stark) Â
1681	northernmonkey	2014-04-25	And then there is the fact that a man like Littlefinger would never brag in such a way about his accomplishments. He doesn't do that.

Â 
But he does brag doesn't he? He's always showing off to Sansa about his plans and how powerful he is. And didn't he show off to Ned and Tyrion about how he was playing everyone in KL?
Â 
I think a lot of the criticisms of show LF are also applicable to book LF. He's every bit as much of a creepy cartoon villain in the books as in the show. I think the show and book LF are incredibly similar, it's just that when you actually see someone acting that part it can seem a bit ridiculous. But on the whole I think D+D have done a good job with LF.
1682	Khal Porno	2014-04-25	tbh, I think LF is cartoonish IN books. And even though I like him, there are moments when he's so insufferable to read because he's so full of himself. In his last scene of Feast, when he's telling Sansa about his plans, it's like the villain monologuing before he gets killed.
Â 
Now I think about it, he reminds me of Fiona in Josie and the Pussycats, the movie (yeah, I've seen the movie...). Fiona sets up a humongous plan involving the government, the FBI, the police, Hollywood and the music industry, even trying to kill two of the Pussycats and brainwashing Josie, with the only purpose of broadcasting a subliminal message during a massive pay-per-view concert that orders people to think she's cool because she was unpopular in High School.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Josie and the Pussycats is the best movie ever!


Hey, how about a spoiler alert next time??
1683	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-25	Hey, how about a spoiler alert next time??


Â 
It says "book spoilers" in the title of the thread.
1684	digiFemme	2014-04-26	Â 
On Cersei - I have seen one argument about some of her changes that has some merit. Show Joff is older than Book Joff. GRRM has said that he felt Joff was still a young boy and was not necessarily irredeemable - he was a bit of a shit that had been misguided and also had way too much power. The argument goes that because show Joff was older, it made sense to make him irredeemable and they did that by giving him some of the heinous actions instead of Cersei, like the killing of the bastards. Making Cersei softer does not appear to have caused anyone to like her more so if this argument reflects what they were aiming for, then it has some merit.


Â 
It depends where you go- I've been to a couple of feminist blogs and they all love Cersei. One even went so far as to say that the show improved on what was a sexist character in the book. Now, I love Lena Headey's portrayal and overall, I'm glad Cersei was depicted as relatively nicer than her book counterpart but it does create a bit of confusion at times. I remember watching an interview with GRRM and the interviewer flat out said that she loved Cersei's character. George agreed and mentioned that Cersei was a lot more sympathetic in the show, and add Lena's talent it was almost guaranteed a lot of viewers would get to like the character...but he also said something along the lines of the portrayal being a bit different in a way that was significant. The interviewer replied to that by saying 'but Cersei loves her children'
Â 
Now the thing is that show Cersei certainly loves all her children. In book Cersei's case it's a bit more ambiguous- she favors Joff but her feelings towards Myrcella and Tommen I'm not so sure about. I can't remember the chapters clearly but there were these parts where she was shown to be comparing Tommen unfavorably to Joff and for her, Joffrey was the ideal king because he was 'stronger' and not timid (kind hearted) like his younger brother. In the show, she's guilty because of how he turned out and even thinks it's a result of her 'sin with Jaime.'Â 
Â 
Also, I'm going to have to disagree with GRRM on Joff- I don't think he's redeemable either version.Â
1685	rmholt	2014-04-26	I think it's not terribly unfair to let the audience know he isn't really trustworthy even via other characters, who still trust him somewhat as far as the books go. Tyrells, Starks,  and Lannisters trusted him as long as they thought they had bought him, which matches the books. He's from a lesser house which makes them less wary. 
I like the Irish accent which I choose to interpret as LF being more himself with his Fingers accent, not the courtly dialect he has to use n king's business. Because I like the Irish accent. I think they should have dressed him better as in the books.
1686	rmholt	2014-04-26	Â 
It says "book spoilers" in the title of the thread.

But it doesn't include ALL (eg non ASOIAF) books?
1687	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-26	Also, I'm going to have to disagree with GRRM on Joff- I don't think he's redeemable either version.ShowJoffrey is smart: he accurately warned Tywin about the dragons but he didn't listened because he was in the mood to shut him down for trying to overpower him. ShowJoffrey also is a bit more interested in history than bookJoffrey.Anyway, about Cersei, my problem with the show version is that now is easier for the audience to justify any of her actions. Anything she might do against Jaime now will be excused because he "raped her". I know it happens in book, when Cersei herself uses the fact that she has been married to Robert and dismissed as an heir of Tywin to "claim" herself as the Queen because she thinks her time has come. We readers know she's wrong because first, she's not the only "victim" of that society but there are women who have managed to make the best of their situations without actually sleeping around to get what they wanted. And they are better prepared to rule. Even Cat herself proved that her advice was useful, despite her honest mistakes. Cersei is not in any way a feminist icon because not only she thinks everybody dismiss her for being a woman (Tywin himself told her that wasn't the reason in the show) but because everything she has now is product of her name and her marriage, not her own value.
1688	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-26	But it doesn't include ALL (eg non ASOIAF) books?Well, if I did wrong, I apologise. I didn't intend to spoil anyone.
1689	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-26	Â 
Also, I'm going to have to disagree with GRRM on Joff- I don't think he's redeemable either version.Â 


Â 
I agree with that completely. There was an instance where Joff wanted to launch raids against the lords of the Riverlands who had bent the knee after the RW and Tywin over ruled him saying "When a man falls to his knee you must help him to his feet." - but it was clear the message hadn't made its way through. I think GRRM says it because he loves all his characters and in his own mind had ways mud-mapped out for some kind of redemption. I am glad that didn't happen though.
Â 
I actually like the portrayal of Cersei in the show too..... well, not 'like', but appreciate the character more. Book C is written from the PoV's of Sansa and Tyrion to this point and so necessarily display her as more one-dimensionally evil.
1690	Danelle	2014-04-26	Didn't GRRM once say on his LJ, that he based/his Littlefinger has a lot in common with Jay Gatsby, whilst the show creation was another matter entirely?


Yes he did!
He was talking about the 2013 Gatsby and someone wrote a comment suggesting that Littlefinger is similar to Gatsby.
GRRM confirmed the similarities between Gatsby and book LF, but he stated that TV LF is quite different.Â
1691	BlackTalon	2014-04-26	Agree.
Hulking over Sansa like Nosferatu.

Â 
No, he was pretty much always shorter, no matter how ST's hair is styled. Actors lie about their height all the time. I remember Kit Harington's imdb's profile saying he's 1,78 as well, and he's 1,73 tops (I met him and I'm 1,73ish myself).
1696	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-26	Fair enough. It must be the extravagant heels they have him wear then.

Not as a person, but as a thing. He never actually sees Sansa as a person. The green light. In the books, he's not sweetly paternal as Aidan Gillen and presumably Benioff and Weiss are pitching it (now). He wants her.

1702	go joff go	2014-04-26	Lf is one of the more popular show watcher only characters, so i think some of the criticism of him is over the top. Plus the book LF wasn't really adaptable. Â Characters would say that they were wary of him and that he was sly and then proceed to completely trust him. The show basically dispenses with that and basically no-one trusts him but everyone uses him without realizing how much he is using them. I actually think,while different the adaptation of lf has been pretty impressive. Â Also show LF has understandable motivations, and doesn't appear to have everything magically go right for him. Â Instead we see LF constantly trying to take advantage of every relationship, so while its att the cost of his trustworthiness, we can actually believe that he can navigate and manipulate people into accomplishing his plans instead of relying on coincidence
1703	digiFemme	2014-04-27	Anyway, about Cersei, my problem with the show version is that now is easier for the audience to justify any of her actions.

Â 
I think Cersei is both a victim and a villain/antagonist but yes, I agree that making her downward spiral a result of being Jaime's victim is not only overwhelmingly simple but inaccurate. Book Cersei's paranoia and irrationality which led to her self destruction are complex in itself and they're problems she's had ever since she was younger. Â Funny thing is that the whole 'rape being the reason for a person's becoming evil' is more of a Littlefinger scenario than Cersei's...wasn't he raped by Lysa in his youth or something? Â But even that, I'm not sure of because the guy's POV is absent.

1704	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-27	I think Aiden Gillen is perfect Littlefinger. As for the scene in S4E3, I think he played it quite well actually. Firstly, he is experiencing a double triumph - he managed to kill Joffrey and get Sansa an he is feeling giddy at how clever he is. These are the moments when LF drops him mask down. Hence, the change in accent from high to low born, from the official to regional. As for the rasp, LF is supposed to be whispering to Sansa, because, as he said, the voice carries across the water. Since the deck of a ship is not a silent environment per se (sailors going about their tasks, sounds of the waves), one has to do what he does. As for grabbing Sansa, well, that's exactly what LF is doing in this scene. It's just a visual enhancement of a metaphor. I think the plot shows so far that everybody but Varys and Tyrion trusts LF, which is very consistent with the book. I do not think Sophie Turner did a good job there. She was totally static forcing Gillen to create visual dynamics.Â

1705	SeventySeven	2014-04-27	For actors height, Celebheight is one of the few webs with right information about them. Sophie is a tall girl, 1,74m, while Aidan is 1,75.

Â 
Sophie is taller now, imo. She's only 17/18 so she's probably still growing, I'd say she's taller than 1,74. She's also quite big boned, and before someone jumps on my head, I'm not calling her fat at all she's slim, but she's not a willowy tall girl, like let's say Taylor Swift. I that that's why she looks more imposing than AG.
1706	rmholt	2014-04-27	A little off topic but the placement of one bit of fog out in the harbor just killed me. On Earth, where I've been, you don't get a dense fog all by itself. The whole body of water is fogged, and how could LF count on it being there? Maybe LF had a cloaking device.

Â 
Well, girls stop growing at 18-19, and boys at 20-21, so, I don't think she's still growing. But she could look taller than 1,74 because she's big boned.

It was actually LF's smug. It follows him everywhere.

That totally annoys me. My husband hasn't read the books and when I watched the episode with him, he couldn't understand why I was so outraged at the wedding. I can't believe George didn't correct it.


Â 
Eh, Robb's mother was Faith of the Seven, and he was undoubtedly raised partly in that tradition.Â  Indeed, Eddard and Catelyn were married in such a ceremony.Â  Also, Talisa herself had been working with Silent Sisters, so perhaps she was partial to the Faith of the Seven herself.
Â 
Regardless, their ceremony did take place underneath a giant tree, so perhaps it was the show's attempt to combine the two traditions.Â  Really, the Northern ceremony is just a trading of vows infront of a heart tree.Â  Robb apparently did just this, only the vows were the vows of the Seven.
1711	zaphodbrx	2014-04-27	Show!Littlefinger is rubbish. He exists for sexposition, moustache twirling villainy and yakking about chaos.
Â 
There's practically nothing of the original character left in the TV show. He was butchered long ago.

. The fact that Robb and Talisa got married in the fashion of the seven,


I have to say, that getting married "in the fashion of the seven" is the least problematic part of the while Robb/Talisa arc -- well, maybe second-least. Â I was glad she died at the RW so that we don't have to deal with losing more screen time to a D&D fanfic character in any future episodes.
1713	ground_control	2014-04-27	I think it was pretty established in AGOT that LF was a mustache-twirling villian. Â When he betrays Ned, in both book and show, he personally puts the dagger (about which he lied, those lies having contributed greatly to the Lannister/Stark war) under Ned's throat and says (in a whisper maybe, but in the middle of a throneroom), "I told you not to trust me."
Â 
Mustache = Twirled
Â 
Seriously, if you didn't get that he was a villain at that time, I'm not sure how the subsequent scenes would be able to "spoil" you.
1714	Jslay427	2014-04-27	I liked tonight's LF quite a bit.

Pfft. Some geek you are. He's got a TARDIS, remember? Back in Season 2, with all the jumping around? And a TARDIS doesn't have a cloaking device, it has a chameleon circuit.
Â 
I liked him a lot more tonight too - not quite as moustache-twirling, and a voice that seemed almost normal.

Â 
I think it's more spoilers for the other characters than for viewers. LF is only effective if people don't realize that he is a threat to them. I like Gillen overall but I think that the writers misstepped a few times with LF's character, like when they have him threatening Cersei for no real purpose.Â 
Â 
(The book does have this problem too so I can't blame the show. Tyrion knows that LF is the one who framed him and started the whole war but just kind of forgets about it near the beginning of the second book.)

Â 
It was established in the Sansa and Arya chapters that because of their parentage, the Stark children were raised under both the Faith of the Seven and The Old Gods. Why is this still brought up?
Â 
And the boat reveal played out almost exactly the way I imagined while reading aSOS. How subtle did you all really picture it? He just murdered an man in front of Sansa, confessed to assassinating the King, and practically gave a cartoon villain monologue.
Â 
In my head the only differences were in the "shot composition". (Didn't Dontos fall into the water?)
1719	Tadco26	2014-05-01	My personal complaints about lack of subtlety are for the character as a whole, not that particular scene.Â  Like offereing to help Sansa out of the capital face to face with her in the throne room, or giving his background history to Ros as he directed virtually directed a porno, or threatening Cersei to her face.Â  The boat scene was a reasonable adaptation to me, but a lot of the other scenes have been much less so.
1720	Dany's Silver	2014-05-01	I disagree with you on Roose, I think Â he is portrayed nearly perfectly. He is disarmingly normal in his presence, but when he speaks, there is so much weight behind his voice. I am not as convinced with Ramsay's portrayal(mostly for shallow reasons to do with the length of his hair) but there are moments that I go " That's Ramsay!" when watching him so yeah...


I enjoy ME's portrayal of Roose Bolton a lot.Â  It doesn't hurt that he looks a bit like Putin!
Â 
The actor portraying Ramsey does the crazy eyes perfectly, you can see the evil glint in the eyes.


This. You get the sense that he really enjoys what he does, so much that he seems like a child at play.
Â 
"The Lannisters send their regards, Avada Kedavra..."
And then a huge snake eats Greywind.


Lololololol.
Â 
Back on topic: I don't mind his portrayal of LF.Â  The raspy voice can be a bit much at times, but he definitely knows how to invade a girl's personal space!Â  He is different from Book!LF, but part of me thinks that because of HBO's T&A quota, he was the perfect vehicle for those sexposition scenes.
1721	DaveyJoe	2014-05-01	I find Gillen to be hilariously entertaining as Littlefinger, I love every second of his performance. Â "I can't tell you how touched I am" in a raspy voice has become a regular phrase among me and my friends.

1723	drayrock	2014-04-22	DB and Benioff really articulated something well in the Vanity Fair article. They said they'd heard somewhere this concept of someone being in the Air Traffic Control Tower of a story, meaning, they really enjoy when they read/watch something and it feels like everything has its place for a reason and from the beginning there was a clear plan and ending, and each piece had a part to play in that ending. Someone is in the tower, seeing all the planes from start to finish and orchestrating their arrivals and departures appropriately.Â Â 
This is exactly why I love ASOIF. Â All the foreshadowing and hints from day one. That being said I think for all Db and Benioff's appreciation they are really blowing it on utilizing things Martin already planted to give this feel.Â 
1. They have now twice failed to include the blue flower on the wall (house of undying and Bran's vision) Choosing instead more dull hints in dialogue like Oberyn's discussion of Rhaegar leaving Ellia "for another woman". They could have done that if they wanted to and in addition, just as easily thrown the image of the blue rose on the wall. And maybe next season included a bit where someone with knowledge of Lyana referenced it (say when all the north is gathered at Winterfell). Instead they include straightforward iron throne with snow on it, doesn't take much depth to get the multiple meanings there.Â 
2. They completely eliminated the story of the frog knight. Would have been a great way to set up howland and give some hints as to the backstory of robert's rebellion and everyone's roles in it without giving away too much. It functioned great like that in the books and would have translated easily. Not to mention give the reed's some screen time and character development.
3. They refuse to include any prophecies or at the very least dreams.Â 
It was these subtle hints they made me love GOT. I want them to include them. They can redeem with Bran. They need to...
It's part of what makes the series great and what makes a great show. Just look at BB...

1724	averde	2014-04-22	Maybe these "hints" aren't actually hints at all then and mean nothing. D&D know how the books wrap up so maybe their cutting some red herring foreshadowing or stuff that we as fans read into too much and in the end actually means nothing.

Peter Jackson & Co cut Tom Bombadil because while he's a great character on the page, he doesn't drive the plot forward in any way, and time is precious in a visual medium.

1728	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	Bloodraven's been cast for this season, meaning Bran's going to be in treeform earlier than we expected. Exposition is coming. There's time for them to drop the "hints."
1729	Strong Belwas!	2014-04-22	I am hoping that Bran's extended story line will include some of the prophecies and symbolism. Bran's greenseer vision in episode 2 was pretty cool. I would imagine shooting the dream sequences could get complicated and expensive which could be a reason why they have not been included.
1730	Arkash	2014-04-22	Yeah, that's I always thought : except if they go straight to Winds' territory for Bran next season, they'll have a lot of free time and room (not to mention the perfect way) to show those symbolic images and those hints at the past ! I'm really looking forward to Bran's story arc this season and the next !
1731	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-22	I just always assumed that the way they do Bran's story will involve that type of information. Also, it would work better to have it in a more concrete form, than the way it's dropped throughout the books. So much happens on this show and the avg viewer will get lost in the muck.Â 
Â 
This is all my hope. I think we also will have to be prepared for stuff we deemed as important not coming to fruition and finding this out on the show vs the books which just kinda sucks.
1732	Northbound2.0	2014-04-22	While I agree with the OP; regarding all the dreams and visions, there is still ample time for these events to occur. Bran's story arc has been sped up for this reason IMHO. Of course D&D, could have brought some of these events in to play much earlier. But I feel this was done on purpose. Why would they want to show these ideas and visions so early on and have viewers set them aside or forget them all together.Â  I think, whenÂ they start going in to these moments, they want them as fresh as possible, in the minds of viewers.

I will laugh at you all when the reveal happens. The blue rose is the one I think that is basically fact. So well done, so subtle. What do you guys not believe R+L=J?

I agree. I struggle to find it's relevance if the real threat is WW. I think the point is that it is just the plain fact that ice and fire came together by fate/love/rhaegars premonition to create Jon, the one person who by happenstance or the gods ends up staying comitted to defending the wall (I'd rather him not get some power that helps as AA, I think his normal ness makes the prophecy cool--it is his decisions to resist temptation of leaving and instead to face the real threat that makes him a hero), which ironicAlly only occurred Bc he was viewed a bastard AND not the king.  
That being said, I do think it was structured and planned too well to not be revealed in some way. Just subtle enough that not everyone gets it but enough hints that he leaves it there for the reader to figure out. It should have some bearing. Even if it's just Danny discovering, and that being the straw that allows her to forgive the Starks and take the WWs on as opposed to sitting the iron throne. 
I don't think it will be howland. Perhaps bran in some way....or the ghost of winterfell lolz.
1741	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-26	R+L=J is pretty much a lock but there's less room for subtlety in television. Little hints like the blue rose aren't as easy or effective to pull off like they are in the books.

1743	Tixu Oty	2014-04-30	I'm kinda starting to think it would be nice if it's Moqorro who directs Dany to Jon though I'm not sure how that would fit with the ideas I have on the prophecy stuff. And yes, I agree that what's makes Jon a great and a more traditional fantasy hero is that his heroism comes from a normal to low place.
As for this control tower stuff I love GRRM's writing and I don't have an opinion on whether or not D&D are doing it justice or not. Either they drop off the hints because they're not that relevant / they'll make up for it later, or they're just not that good. I was very disappointed with Lost's ending, so I'm not putting too much hope on them but hey, I guess we'll just have to wait for the end of the story to judge them in retrospect.
1744	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-20	I think that conversation was one of their best book deviations so far. It was a great establishing character moment for Joff's successor (who's obviously going to differ a bit from that kid we saw on Cersei's lap back in S2) and both of them nailed it. It really captured the sort of person the new king is and Tywin's history lesson was entertaining. It admittedly felt bizarrely upbeat, but still... great scene. This Tommen has potential.
1745	Darth Pipes	2014-04-20	Great scene.Â  Tywin came across as almost human there in dealing with Tommen.Â  But he's playing Tommen just the way he wants to.

1747	Empress In The North	2014-04-20	Loved it. Tywin effectively placed Tommen under his guardianship and Cersei wasn't even able to get a word in. He's going to make sure that there isn't a Joffrey 2.0 (or an Aerys II 3.0). As for what came after...well, anyway.

1748	Trebla	2014-04-20	It really was a good scene. It showed what Tywin really thought of Joff and symbolized how he would be taking Tommen away from Cersei's clutches.
1749	Newstar	2014-04-20	I loved this conversation. Utterly masterful. Tywin was simultaneously giving decent advice and smoothly bringing Tommen under his total control, moulding him into the pliable, tractable, deferential puppet king he needs him to be.
Â 
I'm liking New Tommen so far, although admittedly there wasn't a lot to go off in one scene.
Â

Â 
And the more I think of it, if Tommen wasn't re-cast now you're just looking at dealing with 3 seasons of, however minor he'll be in the show, another kid aging very awkwardly.. at least the new actor, who looks to be 15 or so won't change much going forward.
1755	Colonel Green	2014-04-21	Could Tywin had been in on the Joffery murder?

Â 
Not sure that's so much a re-casting issue as it is a failure to follow exposition that, while subtle enough not to be corny (most of the time), could honestly be followed by a monkey if you were able to give it reference points.. i.e I'd guess that half of the show-watchers don't remember or never caught onto the fact that Cersei/Jaime had 2 other children to begin with.

Â 
Please explain why. I would like your side of things
1761	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-21	Loved it. I don't think he was just being manipulative when he said Tommen had the right temperament for it. He knows he won't live forever, but he also knows Tommen's a kid and needs to learn how to rule. He never bothered to say anything that wasn't backhanded to Joffrey. I really, really liked that Tommen wasn't just spouting stuff but trying to thoughtfully answer, and "thought" his way to the more apt conclusion. Tommen's a puppet now. Under Cersei he'd be little more. Pity we know enough to have a headstart on the season's turn. Imma hoping Tommen gets more screentime, as much as I love the pint-sized arbitrator of beetly disputes.Â

1762	kephv	2014-04-21	Good on Tywin, ensuring he has an obedient servant.
1763	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-21	Regarding Tywin being guilty of Joff's death I liked that Tyrion suspected of everyone but Cersei, specially in view of theories like this one: http://asoiaf.wester...-plots-collide/
1764	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	First, how old is this new Tommen supposed to be? He doesn't know about sex, apparently, that's what? 11? 12? I guess Joffrey was meant to be... 16?
1765	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-21	First, how old is this new Tommen supposed to be? He doesn't know about sex, apparently, that's what? 11? 12? I guess Joffrey was meant to be... 16?


Â 
Probably a fair assumption.. in the grand scheme I guess it doesn't matter too much except I doubt he'll get cats in the show.

He's like three years younger than Sansa in the books, so it would be 11, or maybe 12 if Sansa has already turned 15 off-screen. Am I the only one who thinks the actor doesn't look 15/16? He looks barely 13 to me.

Â 
Probably. Myrcella is older and she has been sent away to marry. In books she's just making time and she's what, nine? ten? They won't make it THAT creepy, so, she probably is fourteen. Tommen should be 13 or 12.Â
1768	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-21	That scene absolutely kicked ass.Â 
Â 
I feel like Tywin could have made Tommen into a great king. He always was a successful hand, he just needed someone that he could control better.Â 
Â 
Also kinda weird thinking about how Jaime has been the father to two Kings, yet has never been King himself. Doesn't happen much.Â
1769	Gneisenau	2014-04-21	I feel like TV Tommen is supposed to be a little boy (espicially since "you know nothing Tommen" speech ) despite then casting a teenager for it.
1770	Envie	2014-04-21	I always try to remember that in the books, Tommen was said to be the same exact age as Bran. So - aged up in the show, that does make sense since Bran looks a LOT older this season (that boy hit puberty fast!). I'm guessing both are supposed to be about 14 now in the show and that's certainly old enough to know the "birds and the bees" but I don't think Tywin really cared whether or not Tommen actually knew - he was doing most of that entire speech for Cersei's benefit not Tommen's. He already knows Tommen is completely pliable. He needed to show Cersei that he was taking over. And it worked. The looks she gave sideways at Tommen were perfect.
1771	metr0man	2014-04-21	It's pretty clear Tywin at least somewhat blames Cersei for Joffrey being such a little shit. He did more kingly grooming in five minutes than Cersei ever did.
1772	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-04-21	Loved this conversation. Yes, it was a little long. However, I think that was necessary. It gave time for Cersei time (peripheral to the conversation) to absorb just what Tywin was doing in that moment. They showed her internal strife, seeing just how helpless she is to stop her father from effectively appropriating the only child she has left. She is reminded of the way she is viewed, as a brood mare whose first stallion was put down for losing the Derby, only to have her youngest colt introduced to his new jocky in front of her.
Â 
Question, though... Who was this "King Orys the First" who Tywin spoke of to Tommen? Killed by his brother early in his reign? I initially thought, maybe, Orys Baratheon- but he was never king. Then I thought it was a mispronunciation of "Aerys", but none of them were victims of fratricide. Maybe it was a pre-Targ king?

As said elsewhere, they probably meant Aenys Targ but didn't want to say that name. Could be Maekar ended up being suspected to kill both his brothers tho.
1774	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-21	A fantastic scene. All the doubts I had about the new Tommen are gone.
1775	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	This was certainly a good deviation.
We see hear more of the previous kings and how they were unsuccessful, and it established Tommen's character, and Tywin's way of manipulating him was well depicted.
Â 
One question: Was Orys killed by his brother? There wasn't anything like that in the books, and the Wiki doesn't cover it either.

Â 
Nah, I watched with subtitles, it's definitely Orys.

Â 
Yeah, I thought it weird that Tommen is aged up but had no idea about sex. But that was probably done to show he's really innocent rather than young.
I think Joffrey was around 16, I'd put Tommen at 12 with Myrcella at 14.
Â 
Though Tommen looked much older, like 14 at least.
Â 
Also, Littlefinger said Joffrey tormented Sansa "for years". That made no sense.
1778	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-21	Â 
Nah, I watched with subtitles, it's definitely Orys.


He could be a pre-Aegon king.
1779	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	Best scene of the episode and one of the best they have done.
1780	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	He could be a pre-Aegon king.


Â 
Yeah, probably some ancient Storm King.
He did say Orys the First.
1781	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-21	Yeah, probably some ancient Storm King.
He did say Orys the First.

The Baratheons took everything from the Stormkings except their name. Orys is a Valyrian name.
1782	Timcom	2014-04-21	I really liked this scene.Â  The most interesting sentence I found was:
Â 
"A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you."
Â 
Is this a foreshadowing of the future Ironborn attack on the Reach?
1783	Red Tiger	2014-04-21	I really liked this scene.Â  The most interesting sentence I found was:

Yeah I thought the exact same thing. I think it's also foreshadowing to Cersei's horrible small council.
1784	Metopheles	2014-04-21	Also kinda weird thinking about how Jaime has been the father to two Kings, yet has never been King himself. Doesn't happen much.Â 


Â 
Well, so far he is only topped by Steffon Baratheon, father to three kings.Â
1785	Metopheles	2014-04-21	Â 
Also, Littlefinger said Joffrey tormented Sansa "for years". That made no sense.


Â 
Would it sound better if he said "Joffrey abused you for 1 year and 10 moons" ?
Because that is roughly the time Sansa was abused by Joffrey..
1786	lostinasia	2014-04-21	Repeating myself from another thread, but what the heck: I wonder if the Tywin/Tommen relationship was being planned back in the Tywin/Arya scenes? Would Tywin in this scene seem entirely out of character but for his interactions with Arya?
Â 
I love how the show is handling Tywin. He's far more interesting in the show than he ever was in the book for me.
1787	SuperTechmarine	2014-04-21	Loved it, Tywin's trying to groom Tommen into a good king while at the same time making him his puppet.
1788	Metopheles	2014-04-21	But isn't that only because we kinda have a Tywin pov in the show? I mean there are way more scenes and interactions than in the book. In the books we had him interact only with Tyrion three times and with Jaime two times.
Now he pretty much has scenes with every KL based character.
But he is still the same awesome badass as in the books. I see no toned down or more sympathetic Tywin.
1789	David Selig	2014-04-21	Atrocious scene. Tommen isn't a 6 year old. Embarrassing infodumping too.
1790	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-21	I wish Tywin would find out somehow who was that serving girl he developed a liking for before the end.
Anyway, Tywin's scene with Tommen was a highlight for an ep I have trouble appreciating.
1791	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Atrocious scene. Tommen isn't a 6 year old. Embarrassing infodumping too.


Â 
How old is he in the show? 10, 12? I think it was well done. A grandfather teaching and playing with his grandson.
1792	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-21	This was a great scene. I really enjoyed it. Â I also like the new Tommen, I think it is going to work out fine with him.
1793	JonSnow1234	2014-04-21	Shows how Tywin is able to take control of any situation and turn it into an advantage for him
1794	David Selig	2014-04-21	Â 
How old is he in the show? 10, 12? I think it was well done. A grandfather teaching and playing with his grandson.


He looks 15 at least to me, I think the actor is 16 or so.

Â 
The actor is 16???? LOL
1796	The lord of apes	2014-04-21	The actor looks 12 for me. And since he is same age than Bran, the character is probably 12 too.
1797	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	If only they'd shown Tommen's reaction to Tywin's explanation of sex afterwards.
That would be hilarious
1798	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	The actor looks 12 for me. And since he is same age than Bran, the character is probably 12 too.


Â 
They did kind of screw themselves back in Season 1 though, because I think Loras says to Renly that Tommen is 8. The new actor does not look like a 10-year-old.Â 
Â 
However, I like that Tommen isn't just going to be a tubby boy playing with kittens and outlawing beets. I think he will still be sweet and easily controlled, but giving his character a little more agency might make it interesting when he ends up liking the Tyrells more and more.
1799	Sand11751	2014-04-21	The conversation was excellent, setting up the role of theÂ grandfatherly advisor who only has the best interests of the kingdom at heart. Made me reevaluate TywinÂ as less having less of an oak tree up his ass; there's some genuine concern for the stability of Westeros, even beyond his family's interest. Helps that this time he's got a malleable grandson rather than a lunatic. Loved him calling Joffrey as he saw him in front of grieving Cersei - she knew the monster she'd birthed, said so last season, but she needed to hear it and Tommen did as well. So glad they cut away from Tywin's perspective on the birds and bees....creepy. There are moments where D&D have gone for subtlety and then, other scenes that are so obtuse. My first sight of the new actor resulted in "who the fuck is that?" I keep waiting for someone to say, "So, Tommen...." because he could be just another of those golden-haired shits for all any viewer knew.Â
1800	solidviper	2014-04-21	The actor looks 11-12 to me. His rounded face and larger eyes kind of helps the innocence factor, and the fact that Bran has aged so much makes it where it's not that unbelievable. Â
1801	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-21	thought it was a great scene. Tywin knew Joffrey was Cerseis creation so he deffinitly wanted Tommen under his wing this time.
1802	Chuck88	2014-04-21	The scene itself was a little long but would have been perfect if Tommen wasn't so old. He comes across as slow rather than the Tommen of the books who is simply a child being a child.Â 
I know it's been discussed to death, but what a stupid decision. The show has an excellent track record of casting child actors in notable roles from back in season one so it's not as if they had to get an older, more accomplished guy in. If they were going to replace the first kid then fine, but I don't see why they went down this route.
Renly in season one said Tommen is 8. Blackfish in season 3 says Martyn Lannister is 15. A year later and now he's supposed to be playing a character who is 10 at the most.Â 
Despite all that, I really do like seeing this side to Tywin. It's easy to miss but he makes a b-line for Tommen as soon as Joffrey hits the ground in last week's episode.Â

I dunno about that. I know I wouldn't give more lengthy answers if my grandfather and greatest villain/hero of their time called me out like that at 15. While Tommen is exceptionally childish in the books. He's two years older then GOT Bran when he's chasing Ser Pounce around, outlawing beets, stamping everything mindlessly.
1804	Lord Damian	2014-04-21	Charles Dance plays a perfect Tywin and so so good at it, they have expanded his role in the series. This man deserved awards for this and his work on A GAME OF THRONES will most likely be what he is remembered for the most as an actor. Excellent. This scene with Tommen was magnificent and the look on Cersei's face when Tywin says, in essence, whatÂ  failure Joff was was priceless. Even more the better because Joff was 100% Cersei's life project as Queen.
1805	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	He looks 15 at least to me, I think the actor is 16 or so.


Â 
Nah, he has a very sweet face. Also, Joffrey is sixteen, and Myrcella is around 15. That means he's not older than 14. I'll give him 13 at much.
1806	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-21	Atrocious scene. Tommen isn't a 6 year old. Embarrassing infodumping too.


Â 
In what galaxy was it an embarrassing info dump?Â  Â  Â  Â
1807	ACVG	2014-04-21	what did Tywin say was the appropriate response to "a great house asks for support against a great navy...?" curious to know tywins mind
1808	bluelip	2014-04-21	Awesome, awesome scene.
Â 
Tommen's age doesn't bug me, but I was a bit vexed by how they seemed to go off-canon for the "Orys" reference.
1809	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-21	what did Tywin say was the appropriate response to "a great house asks for support against a great navy...?" curious to know tywins mind

He basically said "it depends" and that it's best to listen to those who have experience in these things. Furthermore, it sounded to me as if he was implying that's what he would do/did when he was young. 
Tywin was ruthless but I think he woulda made a boss king out of Tommen
1810	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	That scene also made me oddly excited for Aegon (I'm guessing we'll be getting him early next season), because Tywin describing what makes a good king reminded me of Varys talking about how Aegon has been raised to be the best possible king.
1811	The Eunuch	2014-04-21	Atrocious scene. Tommen isn't a 6 year old.


Â 
Daenerys, Jon and Robb were not 13-14 in the first season neither. If you think age differences make the series "atrocious", you should not watch it...
Generaly, I don't understand the complaints about age and actors growing up (like Bran). It's clear now that the time lapse of the saga is longer in the series than in the books. An author can keep his characters as child forever, but not showrunners.
Â 
There is absolutely no problem if a series that lasts like 5 years in the books lasts like 8 or more years in the series.

Way to miss the point.
Â 
You don't give such a childish lecture as Tywin's here to a 15 year old teen. It makes no sense and it looks silly. if they wanted a character who is 9-10, they shouldn't have cast a 16 year old who is as tall as a typical adult, in that part.
Â 
Someone in his mid 20s trying to pass for 17-18 year old is one thing (no big deal), but a 16 year old playing a 10 year old is a different thing altogether.

Â 
Agreed. For continuity though, they do mention Tommen being 8 in Season 1, and then Petyr specifically tells Sansa Joff tormented her for 2 years, which would make Tommen 10. He's probably supposed to be 12 or 13 (new actor is what? 15/16), which I think works well, but it is a continuity error nonetheless.
Â 
EDIT: for reference,
Â 
Renly Baratheon: I'm fourth in line.Â Loras Tyrell: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster, Tommen is eight.Â

The actor is 14 or 15, and plays a 12 year old boy (not 10).
I don't see how teaching politics is childish. Tywin could teach the same thing to a 30 year old man. In fact, Varys had such lines with Tyrion about who rules ("power is a trick, a shadow on the wall...").

teaching politics in itself is not childish. Teaching it the way Tywin did it here is definitely childish.

As long as they do not show Tommen complaining like a baby, I don't see the problem.

Â 
What solidviper and The Eunuch said. But also keep in mind that Tommen wasn't really raised to be a king, or much of anything. His father only died a couple years ago, and who thought Joff would be out of here so young. Tywin is basically starting from 0 with him, so going over the basics isn't that ridiculous.

I don't think he's trying to teach Tommen, I think he's trying to assess how much Tommen already knows and what his basic nature/intelligence is.

It is idiotic not to prepare him for the distinct possibility of becoming king one day. besides, as a high ranked royal he needs to know about politics and governing even if he never becomes a king.


Based on various Bran POVs, it's clear that Ned taught *his* second born son much better than Cerse did hers, and even Tyrion (whom Tywin hates) seems to have got better training. Â Ofc, as Joff showed, Cersei's idea of training somebody to rule is just telling them they're in charge; unfortunately, as we see in Cersei's POVs, that really all she knows, so in some way, you can say she taught Joff everything she knew about how to rule.
1828	Lord Stokeworth	2014-04-21	Politics in Westeros is basically knowing all the important Houses, their lords, sigils and all the rest of it.
Knowing how to play the Game of Thrones is a whole different thing. Tywin is beginning to lecture him on the latter.
1829	King Tyrion I	2014-04-21	GOT is an unprecedented behemoth as TV productions go. People need to be more tolerant about the liberties D&D must take to cast it properly.


Â 
Exactly this. 
Â 
And some liberties with the plot as well. We who have read the books know more than the average watcher, but still it's a TV Series - a completely different means than a book or a movie at a cinema.
1830	Metopheles	2014-04-21	If it were the exact same thing like in the books, every scene, every letter, then I wouldn't be sitting, gnawing my fingers for the next episode. I know how it will end, but I do not know how they will get there.Â

Exactly this.

Â 
Agreed. I don't think it's realistic to view them as separate entities (or useful even...just two different mediums), and some of their changes are worth discussing, but something like this I don't think should be overly criticized. I like New!Tommen who is only one year older IRL than Old!Tommen, and I think a pre-teen kid will be more interesting to watch than a 6-year-old.
1832	The Eunuch	2014-04-21	People need to be more tolerant about the liberties D&D must take to cast it properly.


Â 
I agree.
The only important thing about Tommen (his essence) is that he's easily manipulable. The rest (what makes his characterization : age, features, hobbies, behaviour) can be changed as long as the essence of the character is faithful to the books.

1833	ACVG	2014-04-21	Based on various Bran POVs, it's clear that Ned taught *his* second born son much better than Cerse did hers, and even Tyrion (whom Tywin hates) seems to have got better training. Â Ofc, as Joff showed, Cersei's idea of training somebody to rule is just telling them they're in charge; unfortunately, as we see in Cersei's POVs, that really all she knows, so in some way, you can say she taught Joff everything she knew about how to rule.


Â 
As a historical reference, Henry viii wasnt brought up to rule, in one bio i read, it is said thats why he wasnt raised as strict as his brother arthur was and liked to play games and joust and have masquerades where he posed as a commoner...
2nd sons were brought up with more leniancy; case and point oberyn and the blackfish
1834	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-21	The scene was excellent. It was typical Tywin in that his grandson is dead, but he's already thinking of how he's going to need to ensure that the Lannisters don't suffer badly from it. Loved his honesty in admitting that Joffrey was a bad king when his grieving mother was right there.
Â 
I think it's clear that while Tommen will remain a thoroughly decent kid who's innocent and a much better person than Joffrey, because he's older he'll be a lot more aware and involved, potentially leading to more of Tywin trying to train him this season. Then, when we get to next season it won't be so simple for Cersei to control him as it was in the books. We could already see here that she simply couldn't get a word in when Tywin was speaking. Building up Tywin/Tommen will make the scene from AFFC where Tommen gets upset at his grandfather's body quite poignant, assuming they retain it in some sort of way. Really interested to see the direction they take the character in now though.
1835	Emperoreddy	2014-04-21	I don't think he's trying to teach Tommen, I think he's trying to assess how much Tommen already knows and what his basic nature/intelligence is.


Â 
What I think is going on. He was testing to see if Tommen was more like Joffery, or if he had the potential to be molded into the puppet king is trully desires.
Â 
He shows almost genuiene surprise when Tommen comes up with the answer of wisdom. Surprise and almost joy and satisfaction. Like he is saying in his mind "YES!! I can use this boy"
Â 
I also think it juxtaposes with Cersei's season one lessons of Joffery, her views on power and seeing everyone but "us" (which I think Joffery warps into "me") is an enemy.
Â 
We see that Tommen isn't Joffery is everyway, and Tywin is definitely not Cersei.

I don't see Tywin as wanting to turn his grandson into a puppet -- presumably Tywin will die before Tommen, and I don't think he plans on passing on Tommen to somebody else to use as a puppet when he dies.
Â 
Joffrey had no wisdom, and started actively making his own policy without regard to what his councilors said as soon as he was crowed, which was about the same time he became "a man grown". Â His first real act was to have Ned beheaded, which made it impossible to make peace with Robb Stark, and almost cost Jaime his life.
Â 
So I don't see Tywin telling Tommen that "a young king listens to his advisors until he's grown, and keeps listening to them after that" as trying to make Tommen a puppet as much as it's saying, "and just because you turn 16 doesn't mean you stop listening to other people." Â Both Ned and Tywin (and Robb) are shown listening to their bannerman's opinions and thoughts before coming to a final conclusion, and are respected for doing so by the people watching them (Tyrion, Cateline).
Â 
In the books, *Cersei* clearly sees herself as ruling through Tywin, but I honestly don't see Tywin as wanting to usurp his grandson's rule.
1837	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-21	It's pretty clear Tywin at least somewhat blames Cersei for Joffrey being such a little shit. He did more kingly grooming in five minutes than Cersei ever did.


Â 
Yep...he never seized to impress me
1838	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-21	Like the various Mountains and Daarios this Tommen is pretty much a new reimagining of the characer. Them saying he was 8 in the S1 really shouldn't matter.
1839	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-21	Hate to be that guy, but I hated the scene after rewatch. It was...ok, first of all, does Tywin have the worst tact in the world or what? I mean, I know it was Joffrey and all but he's not even cold and Tywin is dissing him literally over his own body. If I were Tommen I would have said, "emm, grandpa, are you sure this is the right time for this?"
Â 
Seriously, between this and interrupting Oberyn in the middle of his orgy, I think Tywin is senile, really. Or just a major cockblocker (I think everyone related to the Lannisters have been cockblocking Oberyn since he arrived at KL. No wonder he wants to kill them all)
Â 
And the conversation had this clumsy like history lesson feel to it. Like, Tommen guessing and all that. And it went on for too long.Â 
Â 
And yeah, Tommen's way too old for the character. There, I said it. He's going to fuck Margaery on their wedding night, just you wait.
Â 
Sorry for being such a negative dickhead, but this episode really bummed me out
1840	Gneisenau	2014-04-21	I liked how Tywin guided Tommen away from the darkness and towards the light, literaly and figuratively.
1841	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-04-21	Dunno where to put this... first time posting, but it seems relevant to the topic.
Did anyone else notice Tommen had the exact same outfit as Tywin during the sept scene? Say for it being a different color it was basically spot on to Tywins. I don't recall Joffery ever wearing such an outfit and to me this feels like a subtle hint at how much a puppet Tommen really is to Tywin.

It's not about hinting he is a puppet, but more that he is more drawn to Tywin and kinda mimics him, becomes like him, optically for a start. A common thing in films. But nice find!
It is also worth noting that Tommen's previous outfits were a lot baratheonic, with the byzantene looks of the brass elements. Now he embraces more the lannisterian look, but still a little nod to the brass ornaments
1843	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-04-21	Yeah I noticed that when they stood side by side. The clasps, no ormentation on the clothing, and as Tommen moved his frabic sort of shifted from gold to black as the fabric bent. To me it was just a fantastic thing to find and whoever thought of it deserves some pie.

He's the guy who made his son watch on as his wife was raped, who basically told his son and daughter who to marry without caring about how they felt, and who pretty much disowned his son for staying in the KG. Fair to say he certainly lacks some tact.

"A brief translation of this scene from Tywinese to English:
You are quiet and easy to manipulate. 
Everything you consider to be good is wrong. 
You are young and stupid and need to rely on me to know what is not wrong. 
Even when you are older and smarter you will never be as smart or as old as me. 
Your brother thought he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need me and look what happened to him."
1847	Braavos_Blade	2014-04-21	The way that Tywin has been portrayed in the series makes his co-option of Tommen seem not as self-serving (as we typically think of the term) as it would under other circumstances.
Â 
Most powerful men telling a young sovereign "You'll listen to me throughout your reign if you know what's good for you!" would be doing so mainly for their own self-aggrandizement and to remain in (or at least close to) real power for their own sake.Â 
Â 
But this version of Tywin seems somewhat different.Â  This version of Tywin is fanatically obsessed with the legacy of the Lannister name, and his been all but blase about his own personal fate from the first time we meet him ("Soon I'll be dead...it's the family name that lives on.") up through his scene with Jaime in S4 Ep 1 (casually remarking that he'll die before ever returning to Casterly Rock.)Â  Tywin is desperate to save House Lannister from the ruin that would befall it should Tommen turn into another Joffrey.

You may use the rape as argument, you may not use the forced marriage. The beloved Starks married their kids off as well. Just like the Tullys, who I consider the worst in that. Marrying your 16 year old daughter to a 55 year old creep and consent the marriage..I say rape.
So much for this.

That's maybe not the best argument, but the point is that he's ultimately not a man of tact. When in a diplomatic situation, maybe, but not around his own family when he doesn't need to be.

Well, I kinda understand him.. His son Tyrion looks to Tywin like the perfect image of Tytos. A witty man, all laugh at him, he fucks with whores, showers them in money and Tyrion always plays the fool when he is around Tywin. If he would for once be the smart guy and serious. The scene where they discuss the swords it works. Pefect scene of the two. Exactly like the last chapter in agot. But Tyrion is overly stupid and always triggers his own awkward moments with Tywin. And you have to understand Tywin. Tytos was the ruin for the family and Tywin did all to restore the family and now he sees his heir as the same fool as Tytos.
I don't say he is a humanist or he does the right thing in terms of family relations, but I understand his actions.(not defend them, understand them)

Â 
So maybe it isn't a puppet, but maybe through his grilling of Tommen he sees the potential of not only a good king, but a good heir to the Lannister name.
Â 
As it has been said Tywin is obsessed with preserving the family line. Season 3 showed how he has no faith in Tyrion and Cersei, and this season pretty much starts with him disowning Jamie because he won't take over the Rock and be Lannister heir he has been wanting.
Â 
Maybe he sees Tommen as some he can mold to actually be his "heir" (not in a literal sense, but be him) and the mimicing of clothes could be a hint.

Good point earlier about the other families marrying off their children. Stark, Tully, Baratheon, Targaryen-- doesn't matter they are all guilty of it at some point in time. Furthermore, his marriage of Cersei to Robert made her a queen.. Robert was a drunken mess but as a father Tywin pretty much married her into the greatest position of power and social class he could.Â
1856	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-21	Age and maturity has nothing to do with it. Aenys sounds like anus and it's fucking distracting (and funny).

Exactly. I never realized it because I never said it out loud before, but it's really distracting.
Â 
Â 
Despite Tywin's blatant manipulation of Tommen, I do think he does care about Tommen to some extent.
Maybe it'll translate better in Tommen's reaction at Tywin's funeral. Maybe he'll be ore broken up than he was with Joffrey.Â

1859	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	Someone in his mid 20s trying to pass for 17-18 year old is one thing (no big deal), but a 16 year old playing a 10 year old is a different thing altogether.Â Â teaching politics in itself is not childish. Teaching it the way Tywin did it here is definitely childish.Â But Tommen IS childish, despite his age. Look at him and look at Bran in Winterfell. Tommen is overprotected by Cersei, while she let Joffrey loose. If anything, there is a contrast between them and they both have the same age but while Ned took Brandon to witness justice, Tommen doesn't even know how babies are made.Â Hate to be that guy, but I hated the scene after rewatch.

FYI, Jon Arryn wasn't a "55 year old creep", he was an old man with no direct heir looking for an army to help protect the two boys he had taken on as Wards...marrying Lysa was the price he paid to Hoster for the army. Â Hoster didn't consent to the marriage, he required Jon Arryn to consent in order to get the army he wanted.

And what people seem to miss, Cersei could handle Bob. He raped her and beat her and her children, but in the end she stood on top. She said him, if he ever were to touch Joff, she would kill him, so he stopped, she manipulated him into going against his best friend when the wolf bit Joffrey...and more points. He was a cruel monster, but Cersei could manage him, something not even Ned managed.
Not to forget: She usurped the usurper without him even knowing, he even signed Joffrey as his true heir.
Still. Tywin should have accepted Oberyn after the marriage to Rhaegar failed. Stupid fool, Cersei would have been happy forever if she could get Oberyn and Dornish law is what Cersei wants anyway.

The hell he was, the hell he was! He was a 55 year old creep whose wives died and his children, too and now he goes for a 16 old woman(in this world at least) and consents the marriage. multiple times. And fails every time. Only once, maybe, did it work with Robert Arryn.
And look at Lysa, she is one of the female character who really could never come to like their marriage. She never wanted him. Cat at least grew into liking it, but Lysa...never. And first give me quotes for "Hoster didn't consent"..it's not like Jon jumped at Cat's marriage and raised a cup and married Lysa a the spot. They planned that double marriage and Hoster was happy about it, because Lysa was no more virgin, she even had an abortion prior to it.
1867	Lord Varys	2014-04-22	I really think that complete sequence made little sense. It clearly established that Tywin intends to make Tommen his puppet, and that's not what a man with his knowledge and experience should do. He is a rather old man, he may not even be around long enough to see Tommen come of age (that's 18 in the TV show, and Tommen should be of the same age as Bran in the show). And even if he did, how will it help House Lannister or the royal dynasty if the King is unable to make decisions of his own, or decide who is a bad or a good counselor?
Â 
Cersei and Margaery later fight to control Tommen the puppet king, but Tywin and Kevan actually were determined to make him better king material than Joffrey was. They - especially Kevan later on - shielded him from the bad things happening around him, true, but he is still a child.
Â 
And, please, do not invent your own petty kings to hammer home a point. There never was a King Orys, and King Aenys I Targaryen was not the one they actually meant, since Aenys died neither a year after his coronation nor did he reform anything.
1868	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-22	Nah, he was just doing what I do in real life. Talking to someone with much less knowledge than you, on a particular subject, you want to start off with the most obvious things to bring them up later when the subject becomes complicated.
Â 
The wisdom talk, for the most part, was Tywin's first step to conditioning Tommen as a pragmatist.

1869	Maia	2014-04-22	If anything, there is a contrast between them and they both have the same age but while Ned took Brandon to witness justice, Tommen doesn't even know how babies are made.Well, famously, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette managed to miss some important particulars on the subject while living in the midst of the notoriously randy French court . And it required the visit of her brother the Emperor Joseph II to give 20+ year-old Louis "the talk" and enlighten him on the pertinent details. Talking about _really_ awkward, heh.Also, book Bran had pretty hazy ideas about sex, despite witnessing an execution, having seen animals copulating and even denizens of WF carrying on during celebrations, etc.Not sure why they didn't just rename Aenys into "Aerys I". Why Orys? Oh, well...One of the things that was a bit odd about book Tywin and was certainly a big factor in his mis-management of his kids was that he has never verbally torn the golden twins a new one for their many failures.Even with Cersei, whom he was depriving of her power and trying to marry off to contain the damage she did/was doing, Tywin was very oblique, even protective as far as direct criticism was concerned. "It seems that things needed to be said" - very mild indeed.And he could have easily guilted Jaime into caving in on the subject of CR, what with Tyrion's life on the line and how Jaime's own personal failures lead to their current situation and Jaime's poor public image. Instead, he just went all sulky on Jaime and gave him the silent treatment. It seems that he never reprimanded Jaime for any of his more problematic actions, even when they hurt House Lannister in some way.The only kid Tywin really criticized in some detail was Tyrion and that only because Tyrion ticked him off sufficiently to provoke him into letting loose.In the books, I was under impression that Tywin may have been finally realizing his limitations as a parental figure towards the end and moving Kevan into that spot re: Tommen, for which the latter was much more suited.In the show, of course, Kevan has been pretty much left out and Tywin and Jaime acquired parts of his role/personality as a result.And in this episode we finally see some hint of show Tywin as an able politician, rather than a ruthless blowhard he had been until now.

Some people are just born pure evil.

I didn't take it as rude. It's just a different opinion. I see you are apparently a student of medicine or something, I just am the guy who knows people with conditions and their experience with crazy psychologists that didn't help them at all, except for prescribing them every medication they thought would help and all.. and teachers who play the amateur psychologists.
1880	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-22	Unfortunately we aren't very good with psych yet, and some therapists etc are indubitably charlatans, but that doesn't mean they all are! As for upbringing, I think it's fair to say it's a mixture of nature, upbringing and luck, but Cersei's mix of pampering and use of Joffrey as a weapon against Robert alongside Robert's utterly failure as a father and Jaime's lack of involvement can't have helped Joff's crazy genes

But then explain why Tommen and Myrcella are such gems ? I mean Myrcella is a badass. She is so young, yet she has the ability to inspire people and especially inspire loyalty in people.
Myrcella is Cersei's child. Not Joffrey. Joffrey is his own child. I think if we go to a psychological explanation thing, then the moment where Rob broke Joff's teeth and the time he slapped him when he presented the kittens are the catalysts. Not upbringing by Cersei. She did certainly not tell Joff to cut open a cat.Â 
So yeah, even if people are quick to hate Cersei and think she is an awful parent..two out of three of her kids are great.
1882	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-22	From what we've seen in the books though she has spent a lot more time "raising" Joff, unless that is merely a bias because we don't get to see her interactions with the others in the series

Â 
I think it is bias. The same we have in our society. If the kid's bad, the mother's the culprit. Burn the mother, cause she raised the devil... Yes.. like Robert was too busy to wink from time to time to Joffrey in appreciation of some macaroni picture.
I think the whole opinions against Cersei root from the belief that the mother is always crazy and evil and most of all RESPONSIBLE for every thing a child does; and she is paranoid because she believes everybody wants something against her...which is true..
So is she now paranoid or just smart because she knows it?
1885	marsyao	2014-04-22	And what people seem to miss, Cersei could handle Bob. He raped her and beat her and her children,


Â 
Where do you get all these information? Her marriage with Robert was a political marriage arranged by her father, but that was a very common thing in Westero, the marriage ofÂ first born son and first born daughter of big noble house would be always political marriage. Of course Cersei's marriage was not a happy one, but I can not recall anywhere in the book Robert ever rapped Cersei, actually she fall in love with Rober in the early stage of their marriage.
Let us skip the factÂ that in that time, parents had the right to beat their children, just focus on why Robert hit Joffery,he only time Robert hit Joffery was when Joffery killed and dismembermented two cats so that he could see "what is inside it", Frankly, if my son does this kind of thing, I will hit him too.

And she loved Robert during their wedding until their bedding, after that, accepting he does not love her, she did never love him. He beat and raped her for god's sake. Sure all kids are married away for alliances, but Catelyn apparently grew to love her Ned. Lysa never loved her husband.

1888	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-22	Tommen is the second son of a king in a world where medicine is at a low level and people die young all the time. It is idiotic not to prepare him for the distinct possibility of becoming king one day. besides, as a high ranked royal he needs to know about politics and governing even if he never becomes a king.


Â 
Exactly!
Â 
And the person who was supposed to be doing that job is.... <Drum roll>.... the queen regent, and she did a stand-up job the last time. Tywin has a lot of work to do in a very short time - hence his having to start with the very childish basics.

Arya was separated from her parents at what age? 9-11 years old?

Joffrey tried to kill her, her sister lied about it
She was then forced to kill a fat stable boy
Her father was publicly humiliated and executed right before her
She was then taken to Harrenhal where she sees all these people tortured to death

1893	Maia	2014-04-22	I think the whole opinions against Cersei root from the belief that the mother is always crazy and evil and most of all RESPONSIBLE for every thing a child does;
Normally, I would agree with you, but we know from book Cersei's own PoV that she either applauded or excused Joffrey's viciousness and stroppiness, mistaking it for "strength" and shielded him from the consequences, whilst not noticing his cowardice at all. Joff also wasn't getting any education or even regular arms training after Robert's death, which was certainly in her purview to arrange as a regent.
Cersei was also deeply disturbed by Tommen's good nature and lack of cruelty, mistaking it for weakness, yet tried to crush him when he stood up to her. Etc, etc.
Tommen and Myrcella are decent kids because:
a. they have won the genetic lottery and weren't "special needs" children, like Joffrey, or indeed Cersei herself, as far as their mental health was concerned.
and
b.  they were mainly raised by a septa and various retainers, who gave them more conventional values.
None of this excuses Robert - we know that some of Joffrey's more reprehensible behaviours resulted from trying to impress/emulate him. 
But still, we know beyond doubt that book Cersei actively contributed to Joff's awfulness and was too blind to see it for what it was.
As to show Cersei, she was more cognizant of Joff's problems and had less power to correct him during the time-frame of the show. Nevertheless, there is, again, no doubt of her being a vicious and short-sighted woman, who provided him with a bad example and actively abetted his worst impulses in many ways. So that even show-Joff, while less under her control during his reign, was a product of her upbringing, as well as Robert's neglect and bad example.

I think because we get Cersei's pov weeks after her favourite child died biases her view on him.
Same as her view on Tommen. She misses Joffrey, the cruel monster he was and all, but she misses him. And now she sees only the opposite of him running around and being manipulated by a power hungry wife and her brother who play nice but actually use him and are hypocrites.
She wants to protect Tommen, her now only remaining child in a some hundred miles radius, from becoming a prisoner and tries to balance him.Â 
Â 
Myrcells is Cersei. No denying. The same cunning, calculating and power hungry gal like Cersei. She would also manipulate men the way Cersei did.
Â 
And wasn't Joffrey trained after Robert's death? After all we have the scenes of him hunting game for dinner with his crossbow.

I like Marge, but she is no good benevolent person. She is an evil schemer. Good things for the people... good things for her. Who started the hunger in KL? House Tyrell. It's only right they do that. And they only do that so there wont be any riots and if, only against Joffers and not against the Roses.Â

You're deliberately twisting events here.  First, Joffrey wasn't a baby when this happened.  He was a child.  He also cut up the cat before Robert hit him.  She also only says he hit Joffrey once, after Joffrey showed him the cat.  I'd say that if anything was worthy of some much needed discipline that would be it.
That's not to say Robert was a good father.  He was clearly pretty terrible at it.  However, manipulating events and the text to further your argument serves no one.

Â 
I like Natalie Dormer's take on Marg...she's like a modern day politician. Does helping the smallfolk behoove her and her house? Of course. But that doesn't mean she can't also be sincere in caring about them. As for who started the hunger, I think you have the Lord Oaf of Highgarden to thank for that. I doubt Marg was in a position to make that decision.

Well if Marge was as smart as depicted, she surely would have done the same as the lord oaf. If I want to take a city, and I am the guy that delivers the food, I would cut off the food. Then the city would riot against their rulers and I march in covered in honey and all love me, even if I am the culprit who took their food away.
But sure it wasn't Marge who ordered to cut off the food, but same, she was not in a place to order to give food to them when she entered the capitol. She was given the liberty and opportunity to do so. And it was amazing and great and benevolent, a win-win that is less selfless but can of course be seen as altruistic act.

Cersei never claims that Robert raped her. She does claim that she was abused. It's not necessarily the same thing as rape, especially in Westeros where your personal expectations don't mean too much.
Cersei also makes the point to most people that she abused Robert right back, broke his tooth with a mailed fist, and overall make is pretty clear that she treats him worse than he treated her. Or at least 'gets the better of him,' depending on how you look at it. She did fuck Jamie on her wedding day, plot out her husband's murder, and do quite a few other horrible things of that nature.

First : Why do you defend a rapist and call the victim the evil? She said it everywhere that he raped her.
Â 
And she did not fuck Jaime on her wedding night. She slept with Robert, whom she thought she could love, but he made it impossible as he only loved Lyanna.
And why wouldn't she plot the murder of Bob? She had millions of reasons and the best was Ned threatening her, which would have led to the death of her, her children, her brothers and her father, maybe even her whole House.

Â 
I'm not defending a rapist. I'm just explaining the facts of the fake story we all happen to like. Try to remember that no one is real here.
Â 
If you check the books you'll see that Cersei never claimed she was raped. I'm sure that this is how you perceive her experiences, but it's not necessarily the way that Cersei as a character perceives things. Westerosi culture is different than ours.
Â 
From Dances with Dragons: Cersei admits that she had sex with Jamie on her wedding night when she is locked up in her cell awaiting trial.
Â 
Why would someone not plot murder? That should be self-explanatory. Robert didn't kill her. He also stopped abusing her by the time that he was killed. Robert hardly ever showed interest in her at that point. I don't have a problem with Cersei defending herself and fighting Robert off if she doesn't want to be with him. The problem is that Cersei won and Robert no longer abuses her, so then Cersei takes far worse advantage of Robert than he ever did of her. And Cersei plots and arranges several other murders with Qyburn. The subtext there is that Cersei commits innocent women to Qyburn so that he can torture them and carve them up alive to see what makes women tick.

Forgive my intrusion.

That's not to say Robert was a good father.  He was clearly pretty terrible at it.  However, manipulating events and the text to further your argument serves no one.

Yea, Stannis, who was present for the incident, thought that Robert might have killed Joff, so hard did he hit him. And Joff was 5-6 at the time, while nobody would accuse Stannis of the excess of sentimentality. So, terrible indeed and hardly "appropriate discipline" for a child, however disturbed one. 
But from then on, Cersei was fully in charge of Joff's education though, and she herself didn't even understand why Robert flipped out over vivesection of a cat...
1911	Skore	2014-04-22	I loved this scene, the fact that Tywin insulted Joffrey while he lay there cold on his bier and Cersei stood by impotently.
Â 
Both "loving" grandfather and shrewd politicial in one.
Â 
I also like the kid that plays Tommen, he really captures the Lannister look I pictured when reading the books.
Â 
Aside: do you think they will age up Robert Arryn?
1912	ground_control	2014-04-22	The hell he was, the hell he was! He was a 55 year old creep whose wives died and his children, too and now he goes for a 16 old woman(in this world at least) and consents the marriage. multiple times. And fails every time. Only once, maybe, did it work with Robert Arryn.
And look at Lysa, she is one of the female character who really could never come to like their marriage. She never wanted him. Cat at least grew into liking it, but Lysa...never. And first give me quotes for "Hoster didn't consent"..it's not like Jon jumped at Cat's marriage and raised a cup and married Lysa a the spot. They planned that double marriage and Hoster was happy about it, because Lysa was no more virgin, she even had an abortion prior to it.


What I meant by saying Hoster didn't *consent* was that he was the one who proposed the marriage between Lysa and Jon and Jon Arryn consented/agreed to Hoster's proposal -- he had no heir, so a fertile woman is a good match, but the way it's presented in the books is that he wanted Hoster's army, and that's why he agreed to the marriage.
Â 
Before the rebellion, there was no marriage pact for Lysa, just Cateline & Brandon.
Â 
So, he agrees to marry Lysa, and treats her dutifully, I get no creepy vibe (like I do from Walder & Littlefinger). Â There are other marriages (or proposals) between young women and old men, and it does happen in the real world as well, arguably for similar reasons. Â Lysa wasn't happy about it, but she was in love Petyr and would presumably not have been happy with anyone else.

Â 
The only reason you don't get the creepy vibe from Jon and Lysa is because they are House Arryn and Tully and allied with Stark. How is Walder creepier than that ? Or Littlefinger? It's just because you root for one house and not the other.

I don't get a creepy vibe from Jon Arryn because none of the few times his marriage to Lysa was mentioned did Martin use any language that would make it seem creepy. Â It has nothing to do with his House. Â It seems to me like you are fixated on the age difference and see that alone as being sufficient to make it creepy, and I don't (at least within the context of the story).
Â 
Jon Arryn is a (widowed) major noble with no direct heirs, and the continuity of the family line is considered very important. Â Even with modern medical advances, my understanding is that the "safe" age range for a woman to bear children is much lower than for a man, so anybody he marries (and wants a good chance at having a child with) will be a lot younger than him. Â Lysa has already proven herself to be of child bearing age, so IMO, there is simply no "too young" vibe.
Â 
I think Walder is creepy (or at least "creepier") because he's like 40 years older than Jon Arryn and still wants brides just as young as Lysa AND has no real need -- he has sufficiently many direct heirs. Â Also, based on my reading of the books, Walder treats his wives with considerably less respect for them as people and more like brood mares.
Â 
I think Littlefinger is creepy because he seems to see Sansa as both the daughter he and Cat could have had and as a [future] substitute for Cat as he wanted her. Â There's a reason he has the nickname "Pedofinger".

1915	YourMomsBox	2014-04-22	The scene came as something of a relief. I knew that Tommen (recast as a teenager) had to be significantly different from the book Tommen. The kid seems capable of holding his own as a character which is bound to deviate from the books. Tywin obviously nailed the scene. He is a smart man and he always knew Joff was a terrible King. I'm glad he comes out and acknowledges it in the show.

Â 
Well, first, she didn't want to marry him and Cat remembers that she cried all morning the day of her wedding.Â  Lysa also mentions that he was old with bad breath and lost half his teeth, and the sex was less than unpleasant.

1) Lysa was in love with Littlefinger, with whom she had already had sex and gotten pregnant, and her father forced her to abort her baby. Â So, it's no surprise that she didn't want to marry somebody else. That doesn't make Jon Arryn creepy.
Â 
2) Being old with bad breath and missing teeth is just part of being 55 years old, not an indication that he's creepy.
Â 
I'm not saying Lysa should have been happy about the guy with whom her dad stuck her, I'm just saying that Jon Arryn doesn't come off as creepy. Â Westerosi nobles don't marry for happiness.
1919	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-23	Aside: do you think they will age up Robert Arryn?


It's been three years since we last saw him. I'm sure he'll be as old as Bran's and Tommen's actors by now.
1920	JesterX	2014-04-23	I loved the way Tywin pulling Tommen from Cersei shows he's already trying to wrench him from her control.Â  I'm just wondering why we haven't seen Kevan yet since he's going to be more significant once Tywin dies.Â  If they drop the Cersei/Kevan scene after Tywin dies where he chastises her, this series just might lose me.Â  That was one of my favorite scenes in the book.

Well, you have a good memory, I give you that, dude.
Â 
But if you looked closely, which you haven't, you see that the "random Florents" are not seen in the trailer. Only from a different angle, the "Brienne" from the vengeance trailer looks totally different like the Florents and is on another setting, and has a totally different scream, dude.
So, rewatch it, and watch closely, dude, before randomly insulting other people.
1926	Tywin Manderly	2014-04-23	I fucked Jaime on the morning of my wedding, the queen recalled. "I do," she said, "I feel reborn, as if a festering boil has been lanced and now at last I can begin to heal. I could almost fly."Â 
Â 

Â 


From Dances with Dragons: Cersei admits that she had sex with Jamie on her wedding night when she is locked up in her cell awaiting trial.


Â 
Cersei had sex with Jaime on the morning of her wedding. On her wedding night she had sex with Robert who was drunk and called her "Lyanna".
Â 


What I meant by saying Hoster didn't *consent* was that he was the one who proposed the marriage between Lysa and Jon and Jon Arryn consented/agreed to Hoster's proposal -- he had no heir, so a fertile woman is a good match, but the way it's presented in the books is that he wanted Hoster's army, and that's why he agreed to the marriage.
Â 
Before the rebellion, there was no marriage pact for Lysa, just Cateline & Brandon.
Â 
So, he agrees to marry Lysa, and treats her dutifully, I get no creepy vibe (like I do from Walder & Littlefinger). Â There are other marriages (or proposals) between young women and old men, and it does happen in the real world as well, arguably for similar reasons. Â Lysa wasn't happy about it, but she was in love Petyr and would presumably not have been happy with anyone else.


Â 
Having been pregnant out of wedlock, Lysa was soiled goods and therefore beneath Jon Arryn's notice. Usually marrying a hedge knight would be the best she could hope for so Lysa should be very grateful that her father managed to marry her off to Jon Arryn who is a Lord Paramount.

Â 
I don't know what you're talking about.
Â 
Here's the trailer, with the woman tied to the post that's in flames at 0:55: http://www.imdb.com/...db/vi1810017049
Â 
In E2, the Florent who is screaming along with Selyse's brother is the exact same person. She has short blonde hair and is wearing the exact same robe and tied up the exact same way. Pause the episode if you want to see it.
Â 
The reason you aren't getting the exact shot from the trailer with the exact same scream is that they often use alternate takes and different angles in trailers because the episodes aren't 100% edited at that time. It's why in E1, the way Jaime says "but the war is not won" to Joffrey is done in a completely different cadence and inflection than the way he says it in the trailers. It was an alternate take.
Â 
I'm incredulous that you think Kevan was somehow magically tucked away in the show even though Ian Gelder's name has not appeared in the credits (and even random featured extras who have no lines get their names in the end credits) and the guy you're talking about doesn't even look like him. Imagine my surprise that you're still hanging on to the weird notion that you saw Brienne burning in a trailer when EVERY SINGLE other person who has seen that screenshot did not even remotely come to that conclusion and we've even passed the point of the show where we've actually seen that scene occur.

1928	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-23	I think that conversation was one of their best book deviations so far. It was a great establishing character moment for Joff's successor (who's obviously going to differ a bit from that kid we saw on Cersei's lap back in S2) and both of them nailed it. It really captured the sort of person the new king is and Tywin's history lesson was entertaining. It admittedly felt bizarrely upbeat, but still... great scene. This Tommen has potential.


Â 
Â 
Â 


Loved it. Tywin effectively placed Tommen under his guardianship and Cersei wasn't even able to get a word in. He's going to make sure that there isn't a Joffrey 2.0 (or an Aerys II 3.0). As for what came after...well, anyway.


Â 
Â 
I also really liked that scene, it was very well done.
Â 
Very punishing for Cersei, but she endured that emotional pummeling from her father in silence, and this makes it harder for the audience to watch.
Â 
Interesting choice for an add-on scene in the show too - since neither Tywin nor Tommen are POV characters in the books, so to see something of their future interaction is a treat. (And Tommen is also aged-up from the books too, so that changes the dymanic.)

1929	Er Rn	2014-04-23	I was unsure about the aging up of Tommen after last week's episode, but I think it really worked in this scene. Charles Dance is just a perfect Tywin and I loved seeing him take control.
1930	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-24	Â 
Â 
Before the rebellion, there was no marriage pact for Lysa, just Cateline & Brandon.
Â 
Hoster and Tywin were in the process of establishing a marriage pact between Lysa and Jaime. They met to discuss dowry.
Â 
The reason it didn't go ahead was because Cersei convinced Jaime to join the Kingsguard.
Â 
"But if I join the Kingsguard, I won't inherit Casterly Rock"
"Which do you want more? Me or the Rock."
Â 
Jaime then says they had sex many times until he agreed to her plan. As soon as he agreed, she left and they didn't see each other again for many months, but he was then invited to and accepted an invitation to the KG. Obviously these events happened before Lysa fell pregnant. Perhaps Lysa threw herself at Baelish in response to the marriage negotiations going on.
1931	bluelip	2014-04-28	They could have said Ay-Niece. Doesn't sound like anus.
1932	Metopheles	2014-04-29	why is everyone so fascinated with words that could be pronounced Anus? 
Â 
uuuhh probably not use this, it could sound like anus
1933	Ruin	2014-04-29	I'd certainly like to see these two again in a couple more mentoring scenes, perhaps even having Cersei trying to influence Tommen in front of Tywin.
1934	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-20	Why would Littlefinger kill Dontos right in front of Sansa? If he wanted to gain her trust, wouldn't he have done better to wait untilÂ after she was led to her chamber? Did LF choose to win Sansa's obedience through indimidation rather than trust?? Or did he just goof up there??
1935	Charles Phipps	2014-04-20	I think Littlefinger is forcing Sansa to grow up. He wants an evil partner, not a gullible girl.
1936	shiola	2014-04-20	He wanted to show her not to trust anyone, and that life is not a fairy tale. Â He probably also wants to scare her into thinking she can only ever rely on him.
1937	Chebyshov	2014-04-20	He wanted to show her not to trust anyone, and that life is not a fairy tale. Â He probably also wants to scare her into thinking she can only ever rely on him.

Â I know, right, I thought for a minute he was going to start taking with Sansa's nose in his mouth lol.
1939	Raksha 2014	2014-04-20	I think he wanted to (A) show Sansa what happens to those he has no more use for; and (B)make Sansa feel guilty that Dontos died, or at least partially responsible.

This is the same Littlefinger that throws Lysa through the moon door in front of Alayne. And then tells her all sorts of conspiracies and plots he's working on. Killing Ser Dontos was nothing. And also he knows that she's just seen Joffrey die. And he tells her "your necklace contained the poison". His first words with her are putting Joffrey's death partially on her.
Â 
Ser Dontos isn't even the first person she's seen murdered that day. I'd say it is pretty consistent. We also know that Littlefinger sees Sansa as a younger version of Cat. So he lets his guard down around her quite often. Taking huge risks with her because he is obsessed with her.
1945	lezboyd	2014-04-21	And he tells her "your necklace contained the poison". His first words with her are putting Joffrey's death partially on her.
Â 
Err, this never happened in the scene. He just showed her that the necklace was made of glass and reminded her that everyone in King's Landing is a liar, and that Dontos did it for gold, not because she saved his life.
Â 
My only complaint from this scene is that it loses the context from the books as to why Littlefinger was there in the first place. The book handles that part, but this scene did not.

Â 
Well if nothing else, it certainly shows the audience who to root for now. Sansa can't trust Littlefinger either so of course they needed to show that obvious corner she's now backed into. Everyone will feel a need to coach Sansa along now because of course she's caught like a mouse between the paws of a clever cat.Â 
Â 
It's just like when she looked back at the city before she got into the row boat. She knew there was no going back and whatever was ahead was the only way she could go. Littlefinger could do anything he wants right now and she would have to go along with it. It doesn't really matter if he killed Dontos in front of her or not - it was part of the danger he decided to show her she was really in over her head. Of course Sansa doesn't trust him anymore than she trusts anyone else. That's part of the whole idea and was made clear in this scene quite effectively.
1947	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	He did kill him in front of her in the books as well.
1948	binga	2014-04-21	The only thing he goofed is his ridiculous accent.
1949	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-21	Yea it wasn't really a goof. Actually since from here on out LF basically starts to take her to school on the game by showing how it works, I think and I thought this even when reading the books that, he was teaching her once you have a useless piece and it has become a liability, and lets face it, Dontos was most certainly that, you get rid of it for good.
1950	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	The only thing he goofed is his ridiculous accent.

It's so distracting! I was pretty much laughing through the scene because of it, despite the fact it was supposed to be rather dark.

1956	digiFemme	2014-04-21	I see a lot of topics on Gillen's voice which changed drastically from the first season. Does he have a smoking problem or something? It would explain a lot.Â 
Â 
As for the over the top portrayal- I don't know if they're doing it because they feel TV viewers aren't smart enough to get the subtlety of his book counterpart. But they keep whitewashing Tyrion among other characters. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. They seem to be doing the opposite with Littlefinger.

1957	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-21	He killed Dontos in front of her, because doesn't want her to trust anybody but him, while he also wants to ensure she's a little afraid of him and makes her partly responsible too. This is the perfect combination of emotions for Sansa to be completely tied to him so he can comfortably pedo-creep on her while she doesn't even consider attempting to slip out of his little fingers.Â

1966	Lord Jennings	2014-04-21	Littlefinger had Dontos killed because Littlefinger knew his silence on the matter could be bought once he ran out ofÂ theÂ gold that Littlefinger would haveÂ paid him. "He was a drunk and he was a fool. A drunken fool."

Â 
I can totally understand why Jon Arryn would be forgotten by the unsullied, his part of the TV series was short and at a time the characters were unknown.. and since he's barely been mentioned..
Â 
Jon Arryn was the very first death in the very first show of the first season... he was the hand of the king to Robert and his death was the reason Ned was called to Kings Landing to become hand himself. Â 
Â 
Jon Arryn was also Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale and Warden of the East.. He was Husband to Lysa (Tully) Arryn, the crazy sister of Cats.. Â Jon also trained Ned and Robert when they were young boys and they were extremely close..Â
1982	binga	2014-04-21	Littlefinger was alright in season 1 when he wasn't so over the top.Â A relaxed almost happy Littlefinger with a light accent is much better than this new version. Either he or the directors are overthinking it.

Â 
Â 
Like when he is seducing a young girl he claims to be his daughter? Â And he is obsessed with her because her mother turned him down when they were kids?
Â 
He was a pretty creepy piece of shit in the books too.
1985	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-21	I feel like it's the raspyness. Â I just feel like, how has Littlefinger been so successful in King's Landing because the way he's being portrayed now he practically has a giant sign above his head flashing that he's a power hungry weasel. Â Varys sees it but he's more open with Varys but i always felt that the way he succeeded was to blend in and use the fact that he was low-born to his advantage. Â 
Â 
I mean he's creepy as shit and is nursing a what, 20 year crush, and is totally inappropriate with Sansa, but he was also competent, cunning and cruel. Â I guess maybe this voice is his version of the evil genius laugh that we get to experience now that his plan is coming to fruition. Â I'd rather them just give him a cat to pet though.
Â 
Also, I know there was speculation that Sansa poisons him, but I want her to beat him at his own game. Basically, right at that moment when he thinks he's gained power, the tables turn dramatically on him. I want Sansa on a thrown while he gets carried away. Â Because she needs to learn from him, but not become him.
1986	Envie	2014-04-21	I think all of you are pegging Aiden Gillen entirely wrong. While there may be legit complaints that his Welsh accent is not correct (IF that is in fact what they've directed him to use) - I think the 'bad acting' many of you are seeing is a more contrived 'posture' he's using for the cheesy/creepy Littlefinger personality that was most definitely how he was portrayed in the books. Petyr was all about drama and being snively and rat like. He reminds me of "Templeton" from Charlotte's Web... very sneering and full of himself and also somewhat fake and melodramatic. So what many of you are saying you dislike about his character portrayal is actually him being spot on despicable. Some of his scenes with Varys in particular in seasons past were amazing.
1987	Valerius	2014-04-21	For me, Littlefinger's character was equivalent to Silk in David Eddings' Belgariad series - might be too obscure a reference, though. Littlefinger in the books is not creepy. Firstly, there was no evidence he was "obsessed" with Sansa in the books. Indeed, he had limited contact with her until he spirited her away. For the most part, he communicated indirectly via Dantos. The movie deliberately chose to show Littlefinger with a Sansa obsession - as was evident early in Season One when he tells her the story of the Hound and the Mountain. That scene never happened in the books - it was a story told by the Hound himself in a meeting with Sansa.
1988	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-21	At least he didn't make Sansa kill him.Â  That would've been a cruel twist.
1989	kishefmakherin	2014-04-21	perhaps it is deliberate, Littlefinger's thick backwater accent coming out when he's not around the highborn lords of King's Landing?


Â 
This was my thought too. During childhood, we used an ethnolect at home. When we'd talk outside the home, we'd use the standard, literary language even with each other. LF is just doing similar code-switching, but with the pronunciation.Â
1990	lezboyd	2014-04-21	Littlefinger in the books is not creepy. Firstly, there was no evidence he was "obsessed" with Sansa in the books.


Â 
Err, yes he is creepy in the books too. Once he spirits Sansa away from King's Landing, there are many scenes where he sits her on his lap, and talks to her about strategy. He is a purveour of sexual services to kings and lords, no matter what the demand, even in the books. The show only amplifies his creepiness because they have limited time to present it.
1991	lezboyd	2014-04-21	The actor playing Littlefinger is a real crappy actor in my opinion. When I first saw his casting I was excited because he LOOKED exactly how I imagined him to be in the books. Unfortunately, he doesn't provide anything more than that. His speech always sounds so staged and artificial. And he's nowhere this creepy in the books, simply smooth, calculating, and very very clever.


Â 
I disagree. If he smooths out his accent, he is perfect for the part. The Littlefinger from the books is just as creepy, and his smooth, calculating, clever schemes are yet to fully come to light in the show. Some aspects already have, like his reputation in King's Landing as someone who snaps his fingers and makes money appear whenever the Crown needed it, whereas in reality he has made the kingdoms indebted to the Iron Bank of Braavos over the years. The same Bank who have a reputation of affecting a regime change in order to collect on their loans. This, along with what is going to come to light, makes the Show Littlefinger as clever and calculating as the Book one.
1992	lostinasia	2014-04-21	Littlefinger is creepy in the books, but he doesn't come across as creepy to those around him. People are inclined to trust him in the books, whereas for anyone to trust him in the show seems absurd.
Â 
In a way what the show has nailed with Qyburn is what they've missed with Littlefinger: Book!Qyburn looks like someone's grandfather. He doesn't look like someone who'd be involved in horrific experiments. And the TV!Qyburn, so far, is exactly like that grandfather figure. When we later discover what he's been up to, it'll be a horrifying shock. When Littlefinger is revealed as a master villain, there won't be any shock at all that he's a villain or a schemer - it'll be more like mild surprise that he was that central. "Huh, he's been describing himself as a criminal mastermind to everyone for so long, and it turns out he's actually right and not just self-important. I guess that's ... mildly interesting."
1993	LuisDantas	2014-04-22	Come to think of it, Baelish could easily have misled Sansa into believing that Dontos was safe and well rewarded for his part on her escape if he felt like it.
Â 
It must follow that it does not suit his purposes to do so.
Â 
Part of the reason is pragmatic realism. Â He has little reason to present a faA§ade to Sansa. Â She will soon enough realize that it is just an act, that he is no Noble Knight on a white horse. Â  Besides, we have reason to assume that he does not particularly like to play along the social expectations of Westerosi nobility. Â He is too lowborn to love them that much.
Â 
Beyond that, she does indeed see Sansa as a young proxy of Catherine. Â And he wants to impress the two of them, even if that means presenting himself as a monster unworthy of respect. Â He has long accepted that he has no other means of impressing the Starks. Â 
Â 
He can't be loved by the Starks, so he will settle for scaring, destroying and corrupting them.
Â 
Letting his guard down is in part lack of wisdom, but also sort of the point. Â He has spent far too much energy attempting to present himself as what others want him to be. Â His main goal is to be accepted as the monster that he truly is. Â In his mind he is "protecting" Sansa by showing her how things "truly are".

Or perhaps, like many sociopaths, he doesn't quite realise that his behaviour upsets people. For example, a serial killer on trial is said to have made lots of jokes at the expense of the victims, completely unaware that this further damaged him in the eyes of the jury.
1996	BastardSnow	2014-04-22	He's pretty much going for Stockholm syndrome. The actor Aidan Gillen is quite possibly one of the worst actors ever with that ridiculous mustached evil villain that will tie you to the train tracks shtick. Just as others have said, I was laughing and rolling my eyes at the same time it was so bad.
1997	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-22	Or perhaps, like many sociopaths, he doesn't quite realise that his behaviour upsets people. For example, a serial killer on trial is said to have made lots of jokes at the expense of the victims, completely unaware that this further damaged him in the eyes of the jury.That's kinda the impression I got from him during Feast. And he doesn't need to be a sociopath for that. I've meet people quite full of themselves who didn't realise they didn't have the upper hand in the situation in the way they thought.
1998	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-22	I think all of you are pegging Aiden Gillen entirely wrong. While there may be legit complaints that his Welsh accent is not correct (IF that is in fact what they've directed him to use) - I think the 'bad acting' many of you are seeing is a more contrived 'posture' he's using for the cheesy/creepy Littlefinger personality that was most definitely how he was portrayed in the books. Petyr was all about drama and being snively and rat like. He reminds me of "Templeton" from Charlotte's Web... very sneering and full of himself and also somewhat fake and melodramatic. So what many of you are saying you dislike about his character portrayal is actually him being spot on despicable. Some of his scenes with Varys in particular in seasons past were amazing.


Â 
I agree. I never understood the whole argument about LF being ambiguous in the books - he's a downright fucking creep and an untrustworthy, back-stabbing asshole from the moment you meet him in GoT. Gillen may change his accent up a bit (I don't think it's that bothersome or entirely noticeable, but I guess it annoys others) but otherwise I think he's playing the part well. He's all smiles and japes around his superiors, but his true character really starts to shine in front of Sansa. And yes, those scenes with Varys are brilliant. Not to mention the "chaos is a ladder" speech is still probably my single favourite monologue in the show.

1999	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-22	Gillen is very consistent. He always whispers to Sansa, invades her personal space and uses every opportunity to touch her. Viewers are confused, because they mostly remember his appearance when talking to Varys or his whores, which is completely different. The way Gillen acted in the latest episode is not only consistent with his scenes with Sophie from season 1, it's a bit emphasised, which it would be really, because her arrival is something he wished for for a long time in his scheme of things and it also means his plot has succeeded, which makes him giddy. The change in accent â<U+0080>¦ I don't see it, but I do not think it has anything to do with Wales. The Vale is described as equivalent of Scotland, not Wales, while Dorne is being compared to both Moorish Spain and Wales (hence, all these goat jokes). So, I don't see a problem at all. Too many people hate LF and then just translate that hate to poor Mr Gillen.
2000	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-22	Aiden Gillen as an actor is not the problem. Any scene LF has with Varys he is very good in, he and Conleth play off each other wonderfully. He also nails the intense scenes, the way he gets right in Sansa's face really presents that feeling of uneasiness his character is supposed to give off. It's just that the accent breaks down in the more intense scenes and admittedly I find it a bit of a distraction. The husky smokers voice I don't mind in normal conversation because it sounds sort of sinister. But when he has to lift the volume and accelerate his voice whilst trying to keep that huskiness AND trying to do an unnatural accent all at once, it just gets a bit much.
Â 
Charles Dance is lucky because his natural voice is already so commanding so he doesn't have to change anything. Gillen does though, so i cut him some slack because the rest of his LF portrayal is pretty good.

Â 
I agree. Aside from the accent slipping, I really like Aiden Gillen as LF. "Chaos is a ladder" is one of my favourite scenes too. The actors playing Varys and LF are wonderful in their scenes together. He is visually perfect for the part too.

WHAT IS UP FOR HIS EVER CHANGING ACCENT?
2003	briantw	2014-04-22	I agree that the actor isn't the problem.  The problem is that they keep letting him use that terrible raspy voice.  In the books, Littlefinger slipped through the cracks because he was an amiable guy that always had a joke at hand and who everyone got along with.  On the show, he feels like the polar opposite of that character, and it starts with the accent.
2004	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-22	We're 4 seasons in, don't expect any change.
Â 
I actually like the actor.

Yeah, exactly how I feel - it's the voice. Although now I'm wondering if I misread the book and in fact Littlefinger is transparently villainous, Machiavellian, and treacherous to everyone. I mentioned Qyburn above - when he first appeared on the show, my initial reaction was "What?! He should look creepier than that!". Then I looked at the books again, and realized the picture in my head was totally opposed to what GRRM had described, and the show had nailed it whereas I hadn't been paying attention. Maybe the same thing has happened in my head with Littlefinger.
Â 
EDIT: Thanks to all defending Littlefinger. I'm going to try to keep your comments in mind when I watch his scenes - by and large I love the show, and Littlefinger's voice is my biggest problem with it. I hope I can get over that!

Why not. He is everybody's friend, man with many faces. He wants Sansa to think that she is the only one who knows his real face and true accent subsequently. Plus, he is out there to seduce a young and innocent girl. So, he whispers and touches her and leans into her ALL the time for the first scene at the tourney in season 1. He would not that with Varys obviously, Although, I'd love to see that scene. I'd probably never recover from laughing.

Â 
Maybe his mistake is thinking he has to raise his voice as much as he does. Most good actors change the tone of their voices not the volume. They use whatever volume suits the size of the shot. On the boat he was mostly in close up so he should have been speaking softly and it seemed to me he was too loud. Even good actors speak to loudly when they are doing accents as the are concentrating on getting the accent right rather than the performance. Also LF should't be shouty, he should appear meek, so it would also fit with the character to speak softer.
Â 
But, hey, in the show we have a Roose who shouts and a Stannis who whispers so I don't think the actors are getting any direction at all when it comes to voice.
2009	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-22	His voice is actually the thing I like about him the most.
2010	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	I like the actor too! But he bemuses me a lot of the time! In fact, I really like the actor, but I hope the accent thing is just part of his creepy characterisation, otherwise, just...why!


Â 
I agree with this. I actually don't mind the accent as much as others though. LF's scenes with Sansa are going to creep me out so much anyway that if I take amusement by his accent, it's not the worst distraction.
2011	Greywolf2375	2014-04-22	For me, Littlefinger's character was equivalent to Silk in David Eddings' Belgariad series - might be too obscure a reference, though. Littlefinger in the books is not creepy. Firstly, there was no evidence he was "obsessed" with Sansa in the books. Indeed, he had limited contact with her until he spirited her away.

The movie deliberately chose to show Littlefinger with a Sansa obsession - as was evident early in Season One when he tells her the story of the Hound and the Mountain. That scene never happened in the books - it was a story told by the Hound himself in a meeting with Sansa.


I'm not sure how those two are comparable.Â  Â Silk is a spy and a thief but doesn't exhibit any of the behaviors that LF is portrayed as having.Â  The limited contact was intentional toÂ create distance in his schemes, while the show has portrayed that differently in some aspects he does have much the same feeling about her in the books as in the show.
Â 
LF in the books is very creepy - how he interacts with Sansa is just one piece of it.

It is a superb little sequence and I am sure the accent LF uses here is very similar to that of his scene with Sansa in this ep.
2013	Facelesss Fan	2014-04-22	
2014	starki	2014-04-23	Why would Littlefinger kill Dontos right in front of Sansa? If he wanted to gain her trust, wouldn't he have done better to wait untilÂ after she was led to her chamber? Did LF choose to win Sansa's obedience through indimidation rather than trust?? Or did he just goof up there??


Â 
IntimidationÂ  
Â 
Also, like he said -- an arrow buys the silence forever, unlike money...I like that the show is moving on from Baelish Lord of Brothels early portrayal.

You might want to ask yourself why LF has a Mockingbird for his sigil.


Â 
Actually this may change my mind as to Littlefinger's changeable accent, the notion that he may be modifying his accent to the person or people he may be speaking to is rather a deft one... you may have convinced me... it goes with the slippery nature of his character, that he may use his accent/diction, etc to ingratiate himself or to intimidate/control another... yeh, this is very persuasive... good point!
2017	Conchobar	2014-04-23	Why is Littlefinger's accent so inconsistant? Is it because he is out of the capital and he doesn't need to use a posh accent anymore?
2018	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-23	Aiden gillen is a good choice for the part but his voice was really distracting, and it didn't strike me as having anything to do with Wales. whales maybe?

Thanks for linking that. I think if people watch that they'll remember that Littlefinger has always sounded like this and it may be a put off for some but I think overall it's been a good 'villain' portrayal in the over the top skeevy rat kind of villain way. The mockingbird has always changed himself to fit whoever he's talking to and whatever situation he needs to fit in order to keep climbing that ladder.

I want to like it but sometimes I just cannot take the accent seriously, I mean if he just spoke in his normal Irish accent it would be miles better IMO.

And D&D continue to prove their mediocrity as writers by having in one episode look like he's growing disillusioned with R'hllor, and then in the next having him convinced the leech ritual was the real deal.
Not to mention the exclusion of "weddings have become more perilous than battles, it would seem". The line about raiding the pantry was kind of funny though, but still, not the same.

While they're at it the Stannis/Davos dynamic is still completely ruined - Davos losing his patience with Stannis? No way in fucking hell. Lets hope this redemption shit pays off.

Now i am getting a good idea of D&D's fan fiction writing. They are making him go to Braavos just to set up a conflict between attacking KL when being told by IB and saving the watch when being told by Davos.Â

The whole wildling scene was pretty brutal and I think that helps with what's going to happen in the future this season. The big miss on the show was the classic Stannis line about weddings being more dangerous then battles. 
I think at this point it's pretty safe to say the show isn't ever going to make Stannis into the pretty interesting guy he is in the books, it's something we just have to accept and move on from. As sad as that it is.

I've let my opinion be known about Stannis and the show adaption in other threads and I don't feel like re-hashing the same arguments over and over again with a person as deluded as you and your coven of fellow circle-jerk reactionaries. I'll leave the lynch mob to it.Â 


Good to see you have established me as deluded person, now we can talk as equals. 
Edit: Mod i didn't start this at all.

Â 
I believe that scene was written by D and D for the season premiere and it was moved to the second episode.
Â 
I did laugh at Stannis's reaction to the minor houses that Davos said he brought in to the fold.Â  That was more Book Stannis.
2046	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-20	Some people obsess over certain characters to the point that if they aren't depicted as carbon copies of what they see in their head, the character is ruined. Despite any changes made Stannis isn't much different in the show.
2047	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-20	what will make you guys satisfied with stannis? martin even wrote last episode and people still criticized his scenes.Â 


He didn't write the Dragonstone scenes, those were shifted from Ep 1.
2048	Aldi_AA	2014-04-20	what will make you guys satisfied with stannis? martin even wrote last episode and people still criticized his scenes.Â 

Grrm didn't write those and I'll be satisfied if they show his character like it was in the books or keep him offscreen till he reaches the wall.
2049	chicagostatecougars	2014-04-20	Stannis was poorly depicted again. Just shit writing combined with bias.
2050	ServantOnIce	2014-04-20	Book Stannis > TV Stannis
Â 
Dave and Dan hate Stannis as many other book readers do.
Â 
Let it go folks, they have the power to pollute millions of folks minds about Stannis. Only us bookreaders will know the truth.
2051	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-20	I think book and show Stannis are equally cool characters.
2052	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-20	He didn't write the Dragonstone scenes, those were shifted from Ep 1.


Â 
o my bad i didn't know that. i'll be honest i really didn't like stannis until he reached the wall and was interacting with jon snow. maybe then D&D will have better material to write for him.
2053	Van West	2014-04-20	At least they didn't turn Stannis into a rapist.
Â 
That's all the positive I got for TV Stannis.Â 
Â 
And well he's got a good actor as well.
2054	Belisarius09	2014-04-20	Bringing up the Iron Bank of Bravos earlier than expected.Â  Doesn't Cersei have to refuse to pay the debt first before Stannis can offer to pick up the tab?
Â 
But yeh, at least Stannis didn't get the same treatment as Jaime this episode.Â 
Â 
And its not true Dave hates Stannis.Â  Dan yes, but Dave no.Â  He's much more fair in his approach to the character.Â  I'd advise watching HBO's inside the episode S4 Ep 2.Â  Really highlights what they were thinking with the burning scene.Â  They clearly have different perspectives on Stannis.

Â 
They'll just have him go and be refused a loan because the IB want to give the IT a chance to pay up, then when they turn up later the show people will understand.
Â 
They haven't explained 'The Iron Bank will have its due' and how they replace kings if they don't pay etc. in the show so they have to help it along.

I liked Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson in John Adams, and I like him now as Stannis Baratheon.
Â 
He delivers a great performance and is very believable as Stannis.Â  He even gets the iconic teeth grinding down.Â 
http://img1.wikia.no.../Stannis-S3.jpg
Â 
Stephen Dillane doesn't write the script.Â  He can't fix what the writers fuck up.Â  He can only work with the lines he is given.Â
2061	averde	2014-04-20	what will make you guys satisfied with stannis? martin even wrote last episode and people still criticized his scenes.Â 

Martin didn't write those scenes. They were originally from the premiere and were switched for time reasons.
2062	Belisarius09	2014-04-20	what will make us satisfied with Stannis... oh I don't know maybe actually give him the lines he used in the book?Â  Isn't that a novel idea....(pun intended*)

I agree. The line about "weddings" was severely missed.Â 


This episode confirms to me that Stannis plot is about Shireen. She's going to win the Iron Throne in name of his father. And she IS her father's daughter.


I'll have peace on those terms. A Baratheon on the throne is my favoured ending.Â
2065	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-20	more shit....
Stannis is portraied as a dumb man who cannot understand black magic is an even lower trick than sellswords.
He still threatens Davos.
And he blames and regret him for not burning Edric. Something he never does at the books where he is relifed and almost grateful....
Less butchery to the character doesnt mean no butchery. it still continues.

Â 
http://asoiaf.wester...is-humor/page-2
Â 
If they don't have this one, I won't be happy-
Â 
Â "Her own father got this child on her? We are well rid of her, then. I will not suffer such abominations here. This is not King's Landing."
Â 
Even if they do turn around his character come his Wall scenes, they've still done him a great misservice just by missing out his dry humour in his earlier scenes.
Â 
Honestly, I've learnt to accept show Stannis and book Stannis aren't the same. It's the shows loss, really.

He's amazing. All the more reason why it's such a waste what they're doing with the character & the lines the writers are omitting/changing  because I can see Stephen Dillane delivering them perfectly. He also has a great dynamic with Liam Cunningham & Carice. He's also very...Stannis...in his interviews. I adore him
2068	The Drunkard	2014-04-20	The only part I enjoyed was the line about the pantry. It's the sort of derisive comment Book Stannis would make about his bannermen. Everything else, though, was pretty lame.
Â 
Â 
Bringing up Gendry again, only to complain about how he couldn't kill him, was stupid.Â 
Â 
This random, out-of-nowhere objection to sellswords is silly as shit. He already hired pirates to fight for him. Pirates. And yet Show Stannis balks at the prospect of sellswords? All to make Davos Dragonstone's sole voice of reason, apparently.
Â 
The threat was bad, although I suppose it's to be expected given Davos only lives because of Melisandre.
Â 
Â 
They really shouldn't have tried to fit his story into season 3 and then make up their own content for season 4. Neither areÂ benefiting.
Â 
ETA: On the bright side, zero chance of his attack on the wildlings looking bad. They're crazy.

Â

At this point, I'm expecting none of his great lines to appear. Not the I was trying to win the throne line or the Robert's piss line. Time to just get over it. I'm also convinced they won't make his character turn around at the wall. Don't really see how they could at this point.
2070	King Tommen	2014-04-20	They might still go about it a different way but I think it's kind of genius if they are planning on showing Stannis setting sail but the destination is not the Wall, but Braavos to treat with the Iron Bank. We always assumed once we found out that Stannis was going to Braavos, that it would be a stopover on his way to the Wall (which it still will be) but it looks like they might keep the audience out of the loop on this.
Â 
One of the great things about Stannis' arrival at the Wall in the books was how it was (more or less) a surprise. The show looks to be going out of its way to not bring up the plans from the S3 finale this year in order to maybe have the audience believe Stannis has other priorities. He'll spend the remainder of the season packing up and setting sail but without revealing that the Wall is the ultimate destination (kind of like they did the "oh shit, Dany has understood Valyrian the whole time" bit from S3). That way, his arrival at the climax of E9 will pack more of a punch.

I'm hoping this is what they're doing.

Â 
I agree with you that the surprise arrival of Stannis in ASoS was one of the best parts of the book, and I appreciate that D & D might be trying to find a way to preserve that surprise, but, if that's the case, I really wish they'd found a less cack-handed way of doing it. Â If they do indeed have Stannis' arrival be a surprise, and it's as cool as it could be, then I might be willing to re-consider.
2072	Queen of Whores	2014-04-20	At this point I'm worried I won't get my favourite Stannis quote ever, the one that truly made me realize how much of a badass he was:
Â 
We all know whatÂ my brotherÂ would do. Robert would gallop up to the gates ofÂ WinterfellÂ alone, break them with his warhammer, and ride through the rubble to slayÂ Roose BoltonÂ with his left hand andÂ the BastardÂ with his right. I am not Robert. But we will march, and we will free Winterfell â<U+0080>¦ or die in the attempt.Â

On the Stan front however it seems to have his mojo returned to him. Not since he sliced that fellow's head in half has he displayed this much alpha-ness. I unlike most of those who frequent this set of Stan threads, really like him in the show and I like brooding Stannis as much as man of action Stan. But I must say, the latter's return was welcome.

Â 
I do agree that he's got a bit more of his agency back in this episode, and that's great. As a self-confessed Stannis fanboy nothing makes me happier. I just wish they wouldn't bring up things he's said/done in the past that don't need to be, like threatening to kill Davos again, and wishing he could kill Gendry. Sure, Stannis in the book sometimes threatened to have Davos' tongue out, but I never really thought he was serious. He said stuff like that cause he know deep down Davos was telling the truth, and didn't want to admit it. On the show it seems like he trulyÂ wantsÂ to have Davos killed, and that's just a really terrible interpretation of their awesome bromance in the books.Â

I'm hoping this is what they're doing.

But we specifically see him talking about taking advantage of Joffrey's death. Confirming to us that heading for the Wall (whose troubles would be identical with Joffrey living or dead) isn't his goal at all right now.

Â 
Well there was that scene where he went ahead and choked a bitch. And no shit that when the evil devil on his shoulder isn't around, he thinks more for himself. That's not a hard concept to wrap your head around.
Â 
Also, with that post, I believe "agency" is now the most overused term on this site (narrowly beating out "whitewashed"). I'm going to go ahead and make the assumption that 90% of the posters who use that term here have ever used that word in this context before visiting Westeros.

Â 
You've proved my point. It's all a misdirect for the audience so that we'll kind of forget what happened in the S3 finale. He's going to the Wall because we've seen him arrive in the trailers, they just don't want the audience to think he is. And now they've found a way to even get him on a ship and sailing away from Dragonstone without it being apparent that the Wall is his ultimate destination (after his stop in Braavos).
2100	Konradsmith	2014-04-21	King Tommen to the rescue! In the show and on these boards.
2101	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-21	Some people obsess over certain characters to the point that if they aren't depicted as carbon copies of what they see in their head, the character is ruined. Despite any changes made Stannis isn't much different in the show.


Â 
Killing people for treason vs killing people for not serving the right gods is a big difference.
Â 


This episode confirms to me that Stannis plot is about Shireen. She's going to win the Iron Throne in name of his father. And she IS her father's daughter.


Â 
Since I don't think Stannis will survive until the end of the series, I've been rooting for Queen Shireen I for quite a while now.
Â 


What do you guys think about Stephen Dillane?


Â 
He's awesome.
Â 


Say what you will but I felt that there was a strong bro-vibe at work. Especially when Davey compared Shireen to Stan in the later scene. Their was love in his eyes, man!


Â 
As a total fanboy, I loved that.
Â

Â 
Yeah, but honestly, it wasn't as bad as some previous episode butcheries. Also, considering they made the Hound a butcher and had Jamie raping his sister next to the corpse of their son, both of whom are in the middle of "redemption" type arcs, well.... it's kinda hard to be upset by some of the Stannis stuff this episode (or even some of the previous episodes).
Â 
Honestly, I love the show, but this season seems pretty bad with sloppiness ("here's a necklace, I'll just tell you it's valuable and say nothing about wearing it to Joffery's wedding, because there's no chance you'll hide a necklace that came out of nowhere or decide it doesn't go with your dress") or blackwashing characters.
2102	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-21	I actually thought, that the scene was pretty good until Stannis said: "which means you're running out of time"Â  Â Save the Stannis threats for Jon, come on. What is this the third time now, that Stannis has threatened to kill Davos!?
BTW Good job Davos for getting Frey's vassals on Stannis' sideÂ  Â .
2103	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-21	BTW Good job Davos for getting Frey's vassals on Stannis' sideÂ  Â .

2104	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	Â 
Well there was that scene where he went ahead and choked a bitch. And no shit that when the evil devil on his shoulder isn't around, he thinks more for himself. That's not a hard concept to wrap your head around.
Â 
Also, with that post, I believe "agency" is now the most overused term on this site (narrowly beating out "whitewashed"). I'm going to go ahead and make the assumption that 90% of the posters who use that term here have ever used that word in this context before visiting Westeros.

Feeling a little snippy today, are you? Let me apologise for clearly not being at your level of intelligence by not wrapping my head around this concept. I was discussing this in a civil way, but you clearly felt the need to get passive aggressive.
And assuming things get you nowhere when you clearly don't know the truth.
2105	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-21	You've proved my point. It's all a misdirect for the audience so that we'll kind of forget what happened in the S3 finale. He's going to the Wall because we've seen him arrive in the trailers, they just don't want the audience to think he is. And now they've found a way to even get him on a ship and sailing away from Dragonstone without it being apparent that the Wall is his ultimate destination (after his stop in Braavos).

He'll get there, I agree. Davos and Mel just aren't done convincing him that the Wall is worth his time yet.
2106	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-21	Also I wouldn't take the "GOLDEN COMPANY" line too badly. I think he was shocked at Davos' progress, because Davos should know that he has no gold to hire even a cheap sellsword company, and Davos suggest to hire the most expensive one.
2107	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-21	I actually thought, that the scene was pretty good until Stannis said: "which means you're running out of time"Â  Â Save the Stannis threats for Jon, come on. What is this the third time now, that Stannis has threatened to kill Davos!?
BTW Good job Davos for getting Frey's vassals on Stannis' sideÂ  Â .


I took that line more like "you're as fucked as I am if we lose this".
2108	King Tommen	2014-04-21	He'll get there, I agree. Davos and Mel just aren't done convincing him that the Wall is worth his time yet.


Â 
I really don't think that's happening on the show. Davos isn't talking about it now, he's talking about hiring sellswords and going to the Iron bank for money. We're supposed to believe this is for some kind of big attack on the capital again but it's going to be shown out of the blue that it's really for the Wall.
2109	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-21	I took that line more like "you're as fucked as I am if we lose this".


Good point.
2110	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	I took that line more like "you're as fucked as I am if we lose this".

I hope this is what the intention was, but I interpreted it as "I let you live once; fail me on this and I won't spare you again."
2111	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	AsÂ Stan the ManÂ says in the OP, the Dragonstone scenes were rushed.
Â 
On rewatch I had no problems with the lines, but the word tempo was so high, it was clear the actors weren't able to put the nuance of their meanings across quite right. I mean Shireen came across a little too much as Little-Miss-Bossy-Boots all of a sudden. Having her stronger is fantastic, but the scene was so rushed it just came across as Davos being beset upon rather than pushed and guided.
Â 
As I said last week, I didn't necessarily hate the burning scene, but I found it utterly pointless. Last week's scene lacked any sense of urgency in their plans - then this week's lands and they have urgency but it is magnified by the word tempo and just seems so out of place its jarring.
Â 
It is quite clear to me they could have had parts of the Stannis Davos scene moved to replace the burning and slowed the word tempo down, kept the dinner and kept Shireen/Mel (to reintroduce Shireen to the viewers). This week could then have been Stannis/Davos talking about Joff then run the Davos/Shireen scene as it was but with a slower word count. Plot maintained and better dramatic effect.
Â 
Edit: loved the 'pantry' line.Â 
Â 
That is sardonic Stannis in a nutshell

2112	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-21	It almost seems like Stannis has forgotten, that he needs to go to the Wall. In this episode he talks about having a great opportunity since Joff died, but not even a mention of the Wall. I'm pretty sure, that many of the Unsullied have forgotten about the Mhysa scene at this point.
2113	Dragon's Bane	2014-04-21	In the S3 finale it was looking as if they already made the plan to go to the wall. S4E2 they burned the fellas for the right wind. S4E3 - still in Dragonstone, waiting around with no idea what to do.

He wasn't threatening Davos like you all seem to think, he meant that if he is running out of time, Davos(who is clearly loyal to him) is also subsequently running out of time.

I know that. I just think, that they should at least mention it so, that the casual viewers know what's up.
2116	sati	2014-04-21	Stannis rocked this episode, y'all are tripping.


Â 
He sure did!
2117	Tankbuster	2014-04-21	Stannis and Stannis Jr. were awesome in this episode, Stannis was even showed as a greyish character.

Â 
I think that's the point. They're going for the big surprise.
2119	SM4e	2014-04-21	I didn't dislike the scene at all, but I liked others more in this episode.
Â 
I think Stannis will demand the Iron Bank to support him who refuses.
Stannis conclusion in Season 7 or so should be that they go back to Dragonstone because they cannot fight with what is left from his army. "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!" in episode 9 then and "Ser Davos is a humble man" in episode 10.
I think this scenario is not that unlikely, especially seeing that they're not portraying him overly positive ( ;p), so that his redemption arc has a greater effect.
2120	SuperTechmarine	2014-04-21	Where did the "Wedding are more perilous than battles" line?Â

Otherwise, Stannis was hilarious, his facial expression especially, and the "not enough men between them to raid a pantry."

Where has this assumption that Stannis has no men come from?
He obviously hasn't got the numbers to field against the Lannisters but I'd say he easily has the 5000 or so men he needs for the battle at the Wall.
Either way we'll find out soon enough.

Well those certainly looks like men at arms watching the burnings in episode 2. Also in the trailers we see a ship with Stannis' sigil on the sails. Plus the pantry squad. I think he has the 1 500 or so men that he has in the books. I can only make out Baratheon men in the trailer Battle of the Wall shots, but maybe that's just me.

5000??????????????????????Â 
That is just too big. Impossible. Stannis with mountain clans men and his forces at the beginning of their death march added up to ~5000.Â 
At the wall he had around ~2000 men.Â 
I don't think show Stannis has that many.Â

His host was 20 times smaller than Mance's in the books so I'm assuming it is here too.

He has 100k in the show.
2134	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Mance had around 20k soldiers.Â 


He had 30k, didn't he? Because Stannis's army was around 1,500 soldiers.
Â 
In the show, Mance has 100k, so, by the 20:1 logic, Stannis would need to have 5,000 men.

I agree he has no ships. Salladhor Saan was only his man to transport him army to the Wall.Â 
Stannis only had 30 lysene ships and they were all Salla's. Wonder where he will get his ships from.Â 
Â 


He has 100k in the show.


That his not his army. That are his total numbers. Not all of them are soldiers.Â

Â 
I liked the pantry line, and I liked the page in a history book line. Â 
Â 
I have to remind myself that they're trying to keep the whole "rescue at the wall" a surprise. Â In a sense its similar to the then torture scenes from last season. Â they don't want to have him absent for so many episodes that people forget about him, so they have to make some stuff up. Â this sub plot with bravos might not end up being half bad. Â 
Â 
the "urgency" of the episode makes sense. Â Stannis wants to take advantage of Joffrey's death. Â 
Â 
that said i wish they still had some of the lines from the books "2 is not 3"...

oh well at least shireen is an adorable little bad ass.

Jon said he is marching on the Wall with an army of 100k men...I don't think he would add in the stragglers when informing Thorne etc. of the threat. It's fighting men they would want to know about.
2141	kakoserrano	2014-04-21	They will redeem Stannis when he gets to the Wall and became the saviour. That would be awesome and looks like it will be better handled that in the books actually. At least looks like they are building that...

Exaggeration is actually one of the best way to alarm someone of a threat.Â 
If he has an army has 100k, that would mean his total numbers would be around ~200k which is just logistically absurd to move about.Â
2143	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Yeah my bad. 30k is the proper one.Â

Â 
Well, Jon may be over-stating it, but, actually, it's the only information we know about Mance's army.
Â 
The show has always given us larger armies than the ones from the book. Tywin had 60,000 men fighting at the end of the S1, which is of course twice the numbers he had in the books.

The numbers don't really matter in truth, just what happens in Braavos.
I don't think he's going to get the same funding he does from the IB later...at this early stage.
If he did he'd hire the sellswords he does later and smash Roose Bolton easily instead of it being a close run thing as it is in the books.

Could be or the rest of his ships might not be in the shot. They had no chain in the show and all of Stannis' ships didn't burn. It's entirely possible that he has 1 500 or so men and ships to transport them in the show.

2148	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-21	Oh yeah forgot to mention the connection between Stannis' and Tywin's scenes. Stannis states that if he doesn't act his claim will be forgotten and later in the episode Tywin states that the threats to the realm are: the Ironbron, the Wildlings and Daenerys with her dragons. Tywin doesn't even mention Stannis as a threat, but I hope he'll give the line:Â This is Stannis Baratheon. The man will fight to the bitter end and then some,Â at some point.

Was going to post that. I thought of Tywin disregarding Stannis as that of he has very low numbers and no manpower to even touch KL.Â
2150	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-21	Way to hijack the title from my last thread. lol. But yeah, I actually think these two scenes were way more palatable to watch than last episode. He said some dick shit to Davos, but at least there was some mild humor throughout the conversation. I also liked Davos' quip about Shireen being Stannis' daughter. "Bloody relentless the both of ya!"Â 
Â 
He's not Book!Stannis. Again, that ship has sailed. I'm just enjoying what I get at this point and hoping he looks badass at the Wall.
2151	Ser Creighton	2014-04-21	and while i'm usually on the side of the show isn't really that off base, i felt like today's episode was really off in how he was interacting with davos but you think it wasn't so bad. go figure. Â  

That's interesting because I feel almost the same way.  I don't look at book Stannis and Show Stannis as the same person, but show Stannis has been highly inconsistent. This week was clueless Stannis everyone else figure it out for me, if I only had more magic leeches. He feels more like a plot device on the show than a character, at least to me, though he isn't on the show much.

2153	E-Ro	2014-04-21	Yeah in the books mances horde is 100k PEOPLE strong. But that number includes kids, elderly, women, etc. A good amount of personnel that wont be fighting. The amount of warriors/raiders in the book host is somewhere around 30k. Â Stannis has 1,500 when he smashes mance.Â 
Â 
But the show has changed the numbers around a bit, which is not a big deal.
Â 
As for Stans portrayal in this episode. It was not bad at least, but it was boring.Â
2154	King Tommen	2014-04-21	Did the ones in charge in KL stopped paying the interest to the IB already on the show? I don't recall. If not, why would the IB help Stannis?


Â 
Both Tyrion and more recently Tywin (through Olenna) have mentioned the Crown debts to the Iron Bank. Tywin doesn't seem to be in any hurry to pay them off based on his conversation in E2 so they may be accelerating the plotline of the Ironbank looking to back another horse.
Â 
I don't think Stannis will get what he wants from the IB this season but there may be more of a condition put in place for him (like rally more people to your side and we'll consider it).
Â 
I think the ending of Stannis' meeting with the Iron Bank will be left ambiguous as to what his next step will be and the next time we see him will be as his army saves the day at the Wall.

Yeah, I too hope the IB rejects Stannis & he doesnt get sellswords (for now).  Smashing the wildlings despite having huge numerical disadvantage is what made that battle so impressive.

I can see Stannis getting rejected and then an IB envoy being rejected by the Iron Throne either later in this season, or early season 5 setting up the IB to go to Stannis in the North.Â

I would hate if he comes to the wall with a large number of men. Stannis being outnumbered in every battle since the Tyrells is part of what makes his struggles great to read.
2163	The Drunkard	2014-04-21	In the trailers I see no sign of anything other than Stannis' black/grey soldiers at the Wall, so I assume he doesn't get any. Maybe all he needs is ships, given Saan already abandoned him.

It would be even better, if the IB wanted him to attack King's Landing, and that's the reason why he rejects.
2165	Formerly Tetrarch42	2014-04-21	I've just watched this episode. I'm upset because I think the actor playing Stannis is very good, and he could be an amazing character if they just wrote him better.
I'm not sure why they left out such powerful passages that I think would translate incredibly well to the screen. Like Stannis' story of the red hawk, or how he became an atheist, or his recollection of when he was so impressed by the king only to learn later that it was Tywin and not Aerys.
Â 
Instead we get Oberyn orgies... like what?
I don't believe that the audience is so naive that they value their daily allowance of HBO soft-core porn above more interesting and conflicted characters. The only good thing they have going for them is that TV!Stannis actually seems to have a relationship with his daughter and Shireen is actually a character and not just ornamentation (and a good character I think too).
Anyways this has become somewhat of a rant, but I think it bears repeating you have a good actor and excellent material for adaptation - make something with it.

Anyways this has become somewhat of a rant, but I think it bears repeating you have a good actor and excellent material for adaptation - make something with it.


It would be so awesome if someone went to GoT comic con panel and gave D&D a Stannis rant. Could you? Pretty please.

Just a heads up to anyone that has said D&D haven't messed up Stannis' character.


yup, they have effectively fucked up his character so much, that this is the public perception of him. Â
2169	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-21	I think he will tell the IB the attack to King's Landing will happen... then the audience will be surprised when he will show up in the wall...


But why would he tell them that and go to the Wall instead?
2170	FNF	2014-04-21	I think Shireen having such a large role this season bodes well for her character in future books.
Â 
*insert Queen Shireen speculation.*
2171	Sunglass	2014-04-21	It would be even better, if the IB wanted him to attack King's Landing, and that's the reason why he rejects.


Best way to introduce this line from Davos
Â 
"A king protects his people or he is no king at all"
2172	zaphodbrx	2014-04-21	In the S3 finale it was looking as if they already made the plan to go to the wall. S4E2 they burned the fellas for the right wind. S4E3 - still in Dragonstone, waiting around with no idea what to do.


Â 
You're mixing books and show. Show-Stannis burns 'em for being infidels. There is nothing about wind.
2173	Formerly Tetrarch42	2014-04-21	It would be so awesome if someone went to GoT comic con panel and gave D&D a Stannis rant. Could you? Pretty please.


Haha, I'll see what I can do.

Â

And Stannis' use of the word "infidel" certainly didn't help any. Since when was that even a word in GRRM's world? As if the "Stannis is a stand-in for religious zealotry" theme wasn't transparent and hamfisted enough. The funny (and depressing) thing is that not only have they ruined Stannis' character as compared to the books but he isn't even an interesting extremist.
Edit: I mean something really isn't right when a character who is a confessed atheist in the source material becomes the second most extraordinary religious fanatic in the TV show. It's the equivalent of replacing Jon's character with Oberyn's.

2174	coatzin	2014-04-21	But why would he tell them that and go to the Wall instead?


Because he needs men to show up at Kings Landing or The Wall... and as is only proper to show Stannis he will do anything Melisandre tells him to do, burn Gendry, kill Renly, all the infidel bullshit, break his word... and she already said 'North'...
Â 
they will mess up the IB showing up north... but they already made a mess doing similar things in Stannis timeline...

Mayhaps. However it seems like the Wall troops are Baratheon men from the trailers we've seen.
2176	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	Actually, someone should go to ComicCon and start shouting "Stannis! Stannis!" during the GoT Panel. They'd have it coming.
2177	Tankbuster	2014-04-21	Only to have security beat them Black 'n Blue and then throw them out. Other than that I agree 100%.
2178	Zorn Gottes	2014-04-21	I took that line more like "you're as fucked as I am if we lose this".

2180	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-21	It has become our stannis appreciation thread. Like a Mannis tribunal judgeing D&D after each episode.


I was just joking. We're all in this together afterall. I'm glad I have some people who share in my disappointment for how they've handled the character these last two seasons. Still, this last episode gives him some slight hope that we're going to get some semblance of the Stannis we love in the books when he heads up North. If he gets the troops and gold from the Iron Bank, and chooses to save the Night's Watch because its the right thing to do, then at least we'll have a compelling redemption arc that'll be entertaining. I'm not banking on anything, because I have a feeling we're going to get screwed by D&D again, but it's a nice thought all the same.

2182	titanx5	2014-04-21	Just watched the episode, and must say I liked this Stannis scene a lot more than last week's episode which kinda pissed me off, with the whole burning infidels, not only did they make Stannis a religious fanatic but a hypocrite all in one scene, why doesnt he burn Davos then? Oh wait Mel said he musnt. So at least this episode we got a better Stannis. At least Stannis bought some humor this time "not enough men between them to raid a pantry", thats a first for D&D. Still hope that Stannis is on the up, and that they use some of the powerful lines he says with Davos. Dont think we are going to get any Stannis next week (hope I'm wrong).Â
2183	A Man Has Said	2014-04-21	I've just watched this episode. I'm upset because I think the actor playing Stannis is very good, and he could be an amazing character if they just wrote him better.I'm not sure why they left out such powerful passages that I think would translate incredibly well to the screen. Like Stannis' story of the red hawk, or how he became an atheist, or his recollection of when he was so impressed by the king only to learn later that it was Tywin and not Aerys.
Â 
Instead we get Oberyn orgies... like what?

I totally agree.Â  Â Â  It's as if D&D would rather be producing pornography, but tried to and found out their was just too much competition. 
And seriously, in today's age of the internet, can they really imagine that if that was what the audience wanted they would be so uninformed as to look for it on HBO?Â 
 Â Â Â  Â
2184	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-21	Well, on the bright side, he's not burning infidels. So that's good
Â 
On the downside, he still does nothing and shows none of his dry wit. And ambiguously threatens to kill Davos and generally treats him like shit.
Â 
Oh, well. Shireen's great, though
2185	Gneisenau	2014-04-21	I think the Stannis fans are to harsh on TV Stannis. Stannis burnt Axell because he refused an order and we all know how law and order Stannis is, can't have dissent in the ranks.
Plus Stannis says he hates certain things but tolerates them all the same, doesn't seem that different from book Stannis.
2186	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-21	As a Stannis fan I really enjoyed that scene. It just showed how hopeless his cause is but he is relentless and refuses to be just a pretender in his enemies eyes.
Â 
I really liked the scene with Shireen aswell.
Â 
I'm going to be positive and say they can salvage Stannis's character. They are portraying the WIldlings as cannibalistic mass murderers so when the King who cared comes riding in to save the day with his army chanting "Stannis, Stannis, Stannis!" he's going to get the portrayal he deserves,Â

Yeah the threat was dumb, but it wasn't as bad as other scenes they've done with him. That's the only nice thing about D&D's adaptation, it's been so botched that mediocre scenes like this look that much better. I actually liked some of the dialogue though. His line about "they don't have enough men between the three of them to raid a pantry," was hilarious. I was a little surprised they had him so opposed to hiring sell swords though? Book!Stannis is cool with it, and Show!Stannis is cool with murdering any number of innocents to get his birth right. They obviously aren't handling his arc with care, but what can you do? I'm sitting back with my popcorn and enjoying the show. This is a companion piece to Martin's masterful piece of fantasy and nothing more. It's funny how some fans actually think the show is evidence that our interpretations of Stan from the text are misreadings and projections. The show isn't the definitive word on anything regarding the books, it's an adaptation by fans just like us with an extremely large budget.
2188	Konradsmith	2014-04-21	Their scene is one of the ones that I hope has an extended version on the DVD or bluray. Maybe we'd get Stan's weddings line orÂ more background on theÂ Golden Company there.

Â 
Except it boils down to the same thing: He killed Axel over religion. Axel is now a martyr for his religious beliefs regardless. This argument just seems like a silly technicality.
Â 
I'll give it to Game of Thrones: Ascent (the Facebook game). They actually made Axel guilty of treason in the game (he fled with secrets to buy is way in with the Lannisters) while still keeping with the show's religious persecution tones (because it is after all, mostly based on the show, but the storyline writers are clearly book readers too).

Â 
Or anyone who isn't Tyrion or Dany. Look at the 50+ page Jamie Thread for that debacle. Sandor was turned into a bandit. And the entire Joffery assassination plot would have been ruined if Sansa decided Dontos's necklace didn't go good with her dress because Dontos in no way suggested she should wear it at the wedding.
Â 
I truly love the show. It's to their credit despite my bitching, I look forward to it every week. It's easily my favorite show on TV right now and hasn't gone off the rails with its adaptation like the Walking Dead. But that's still not going to stop me from going "What the fuck?" at some this shit.
2190	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-21	Book Stannis : The Golden Company would be my first choice, if they are not already under contract. Seek for them in the Disputed Lands, if need be. But first hire as many swords as you can find in Braavos, and send them to me by way of Eastwatch. Archers as well, we need more bows." Show Stannis : yuke! They are "Sellswords" !
A wise, centered king in one side, and a 7 years old little girl who had just seem a spider in the other. Every single scene is a staab to our character.

Â I'm totally with you man. I have to say though, it's annoying that when they severely damage a fan favorite like Jaime (I like him a lot myself), the complaints against D&D become legitimate, but when we bring up book deviations that have potentially ruined Stannis, we get treated like fanboys and whiners. And with all that said I too will be impatentially awaiting next Sunday at 9 with my six pack of craft beer. We're still incredibly lucky to have an adaptation that comes as close to capturing the essence of Martin's work as this one does.

I dislike the recent depiction of both Jaime and Stannis, but I don't think they are nowhere near as close to being ruined. If Stannis saves the Walls and everyone there likes him for it, and then promises justice for the Boltons, he will soon become a fan favorite. Same thing for Jaime if he sends Brienne after Sansa, defends Tyrion on the trial and then helps him escape. I believe they are very easy to salvage.

Dave and Dan hate Stannis as many other book readers do.
Â 
Let it go folks, they have the power to pollute millions of folks minds about Stannis. Only us bookreaders will know the truth.
Season 3 was bad enough, having him call his brother in law an "infidel" was too much. Next they will have him declare a Fatwa against all who deny him as their king. Calling Stannis butchered by D and D is putting it lightly.

2196	Good Master	2014-04-21	Not sure how book Stannis has so many hardcore fanatics. I like his character and think he has his badass moments, but the shows portrayal of him seems fair to me. I completely understand how any man in his position would be frustrated and confused, as D and D portray him. We don't see it in the books, most likely due to zero Stannis POVs, but I believe he is experiencing those feelings nonetheless. HE IS JUST A MAN. 
 He won some good battles, survived Storms End, was thrown back at the Blackwater, hesays some pretty cool lines and lets a Red Priestess work him like a puppet. Why do the Stanatics worship him so? What is so damn special about him? 
I've read all 5 books twice. Love the books, really like the show.

The fact that you think he has no autonomy shows you read his arc carelessly. Especially A Dance With Dragons when he's kicking ass and taking names up North. And also, none of us here want him to be some immaculate superhero. That's not why we like the character. We want the battle-hardened, just, but morally conflicted king we found compelling in the books, rather than a religious fanatic and or "puppet" as you suggested.

Â 
Puppet may be too far. He is without a doubt being pushed and pulled by Mel and her religion. She is influencing his decisions, in the book and show alike. BurningÂ idols, burning disobeyers, burning leaches to kill kings. Hardly portrayed as a "fanatic" in the show. Disgusted look on his face as Selyse goes off about their souls. You make it sound as if he is being shown praying over a brazier all night. .Â 
Â 
When his Dance With Dragons scenes roll around, along with North of The Wall, he will be kicking ass and taking names. Until then, he is still recently defeated and seeking options.Â

Â 
If you think our problem is him being portrayed as frustrated and confused, then you have no idea what we're upset about.
Â 
It's the change from a morally complicated man who ultimately tries to do the right thing to a villain who for some reason is still around when the hero of the story, Tyrion Lannister, defeated him two seasons ago.
Â 
Book!Stannis executes people for capital crimes while dressing it up in religious ceremony becomes a man who happily executes unbelievers for his own gain (and him apparently making worshiping the Seven a capital crime really doesn't make it like Book!Stannis).
Â 
This has nothing to do with Stannis looking frustrated and confused or look like man rather than some godlike being. I don't know about you, but when I get frustrated and confused, I don't start murdering non-atheists. I also consider myself just a man despite not murdering those who don't share my beliefs (or lack of technically). Rather it is a case of "murdering someone for their faith is clearly evil," and the Stannis we are fans of and want to see on the show would not do that. Every person the character we are fans of would have been executed anyways. Yet, we do not see that character. We see monster who kills people for being "infidels."
Â 
Let's also look at the sacrifice (Edric/Gendry). Book!Stannis was everything you described. We would've fucking loved that. If D&D had delivered that Stannis, we'd be singing their praises. But we didn't get a season of Stannis grappling with a horrible moral choice of an innocent child* in order to save the whole world. At best, he seemed impatient. Steven Dillane is excellent as Stannis. If there was some deeper emotion or fear, he would have conveyed that. But really, the only reason we have to believe that Show!Stannis had any hesitation is because Davos actually says it. Book!Stannis actually shows someone who is frustrated and confused. He is someone who is torn between what is right. Show!Stannis has no hesitation. As soon as the first king dies, he's ready to do it. Even when it is no longer an option, he still bitches about it.
Â 
I could go, but I'm just going to leave it there. In summary, we would love if D&D gave us a morally complicated man who makes mistakes (both technical and moral) and feels confused and frustrated, because that is the character we love. Sadly, we get a rather flat villain who has no problems with murdering the innocent.
Â 
*To be fair to Show!Stannis, I also believe that murdering Gendry is a good thing even if Show!Gendry is slightly more tolerable than Book!Gendry.

They have a lot of redeeming to do in order to make Stannis likeable in that arc after the way they've handled him. Lord Bronn of Stokeworth said most of what I would stated, but really, our concern is that because they've been so careless with him thus far, it's hard to say whether or not Stan will get his due later on. They've made tons of needless deviations from source material already, its not a far cry to think they won't change the context of later events and continue to make him look like this selfish douche who has none of the redeeming qualities that won him this loyal and incredibly vocal fanbase amongst book readers. And believe me, I seriously hope I'm wrong, and that Stannis is given a really kickass redemption arc after this Iron Bank shit goes down. It's still possible for that heel to face turn, but it has to be this season, or it won't happen at all. The Wall is his defining moment as a character, and the only reason I'm happy they're drawing it out is that now there's an opportunity for him to make that choice, rather than going North because Mel tells him to, as episode 10 of season 3 suggested.

2205	lelele	2014-04-21	His taking a shot at Davos about freeing Gendry was sort of in-line with Show!Stannis though. If he can hold grudges for 15 years, albeit a more serious case, what's stopping him for holding another for just another week?

Sure Book!Stannis wouldn't have burnt Gendry with enthusiasm and would be relieved not to, but him holding grudges about something he wants as Show!Stannis wants to burn Gendry was a very Stannis-like trait.
2206	LuisDantas	2014-04-22	The show generally goes way out of its way to make Stannis look sympathetic without fully conflicting with the books.
Â 
That some people feel the opposite shows how much of that sympathy is on the eyes of the beholder, IMO. Â And perhaps also how little we understand of the actual nature and boundaries of Davos' devotion to Stannis from the books. Â 
Â 
On the text, Davos seems to be almost afraid of even thinking about his own reasons. Â Probably a wise choice.

2211	averde	2014-04-22	BTW for all you questioning D&D for making Stannis threaten to kill Davos let me point to a line from the books.
Â 
" It is his silences you should fear, not his words."
Â 
Can't wait for people to get upset when he threatens to kill Jon as some sort of character assassination.Â 
Your trying to defend the show by picking and choosing things without acknowledging anything else about the issue. Look at all the things these threads have compiled about Stannis changes and things left out, often for no reason at all, and tell me that character hasn't been character assassinated on TV.

2212	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-22	Unlike Stannis, I believe Jaime's been a bit whitewashed in the show. Except for scenes like Alton's murder and Cersei's rape, Jaime is much more likeable than in the books to me. He seems genuinely concerned about Brienne and doesn't treat her like shit all the time. He loses his hand trying to save her and doesn't appear to be really trying to kill Brienne in their duel. It's a bigger bromance in the show and he has more respect for her. That's why I think they will easily salvage Jaime this season yet. I really doubt it that people will still hate him after he sends Brienne to rescure Sansa, defends Tyrion in his trial, helps him escape and shits on his own reputation when writing the White Book. People will look back and see his last scene with Cersei as a relapse he quickly recovered from.
Â 
Stannis, on the other hand, will take some more time until he becomes more likeable to the non-readers, most likely by season 5 only. The only things about him that were whitewashed were his love for his daughter and his bravery in battle, while the rest of his positive qualities were omitted. Remember that there wouldn't be a "Stannis the Mannis" in the first place if he hadn't personally climbed the walls of King's Landing, but it's been a while since that happened, so they would have to do more to his character to make him likeable again. Maybe we will see him slaying a giant by himself?
2213	Gneisenau	2014-04-22	Alton's murder and Cersei's rape pretty much blackwash any whitewashing Jaime got.

People are even less forgiving of rape than attempted child-murder.
Â 
At least his attempted murder could be justified.Â 
Â 
Raping Cersei can't.
Â 
Also whatever trust people had for Jaime vanished. Now people can't be sure it's not going to be another fake out before he rapes someone else.

Really? You must despise him because he pushed Bran out of the tower and started an entire war because of his children with Cersei. All those things are what makes a grey character. To some people apparently there's no middle ground between good and evil.

Are they? Do people have more sympathy for Bran of for Cersei? Most of the reactions I've seen are of people being disappointed by Jaime's action after warming up to him, not for Cersei being his victim. They don't have a shred of sympathy for her. But very well, if you want to declare character assassination, I'll leave you to it. Some people apparently have a lot of fun overreacting it almost sounds like a circlejerk.
2216	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-22	why the fuck is there a Jaime and Rape discussion here
2217	Hellothere	2014-04-22	I am sick of the way they portray Stannis, I wish they would just spend more time on him and fill him in a little more one way or the other.
At the moment I am sat there watching it with my non-reader husband babbling about his motivations. Â If they would just make him more evil or show more good I could at least tell where the show are going with the character.

There isnt even anything wrong with that really. even if he means it(which he probably does)Â Stannis Would rip the NW to shreds if he had to.Â
2221	Bronn Urgundy	2014-04-22	Will they show the idiocity of the NW though? "Oooh but traditionsÂ mean we canÂ dawdle for years!Â Oooh our but Castles you cant garrison them leave them empty! Oooh scum Wildlings" vs Stannis' "sort yourselves out! The WW are coming!"
Â 
Or will they pretend the NW are the brainy bunch whileÂ Stannis goes "Gimme what I want before I gut yer!"
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
As I've said before, genuinely afraid they'll make him a Slynt supporter.
2222	The Onion Sleight	2014-04-22	About the IBoB:
Â 


It would be even better, if the IB wanted him to attack King's Landing, and that's the reason why he rejects.


Â 


I think he will tell the IB the attack to King's Landing will happen... then the audience will be surprised when he will show up in the wall...


Â 
Â 
That was my last post about this, in the other "A Balanced Review about Show Stannis (4.02)" thread:
(copied to here)
Â 


I always throught they would create ambiguilty by showing the Iron Bank rejects Stannis' and Davos' request for a loan (because Tywin's still alive, the Crown's still paying their debts) and we would leave them in Ep. 6 or 7 with a scene of "We haven't enough people to help, we're would risk an immense default and maybe losing our last remaining men." and then the Unsullied wouldn't know if they're giving up their idea (no gold -> no sellswords and soldiers -> very small army compared to Mance's; the threat of the Others is in the background, other fights seem more important) or not...
Â 
But now, I'm thinking, that we'll maybe see the IBoB more keen of Stannis and his cause and they'll maybe extends a warmer welcome to him than everybodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>d assume, because of all this talking about the Crown's problems with the Bank, Tywin's and Olenna's chat last episode and that they'll maybe refuse their paying earlier than expected.
Then the IBoB would be more pro-Stan much earlier than in the books and it'd be interesting to see how that would effect him and his fate. 
(Even in the books yet, we don't really know how the bank's support will effect the TWOW events and what will really happen after the Theon sample). That'd create an "Iron Bank propostions him to attack KL again" situation (I tkink they'd be more supportive ofÂ  this idea than the Wall idea) and a better scenario.
Not only, because we'd have the ambiguilty, too - the Unsullied might see him thoughtful, struggling / doubtful, conflicted because of "Trying to win the throne to save the kingdom vs. Trying to save the kingdom to win the throne" (the ultimate fitting situation!, as I said before), and not only because of military weakness / less gold, men... .
What do you think? Will they (Tycho & Co.) just say "Nah, sorry, we still have the Crown, we won't support you" or could it be that they'll more "Well, the Crown is not willing to pay, so we turn to you... Hey, do you still want to take the city?..."? (Even with their money for sellswords & stuff, it'd still be a very risky attack, for the NW would come very help too late, he wouldn't become "the King who still cares", aso... So going to the Wall would be the best decision, but people'd have to wait to Ep. 9 to see the result of his decision ;-)

Â 
Â 

Â 
Another small question, btw: Do you think Davos will go together with the others to Castle Black before his Manderly-mission?
I know it's actually a pretty unnecessary detour sailing to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, then riding to Castle Black, then (in Season 5) riding back to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and travelling to White Habor (with an unplanned stopover at Sweet Sister), but I could imagine this change on show (I mean, if Stannis has this idea with White Habor later than in the books?).
Because I'd love to see Stan giving this mission to Davos on-screen and maybe a Davos / Jon meeting 


Â 
I absolutely agree with this, every word of that:
Â 


The IB scene is so important. Stannis as a begger king is absolute bullshit and in no way his character. If they have him roll into Bravos, treat with Tycho in a manner of "Please help me I deserve it" then I'll be convinced D and D are ruining him. Dont see it happening, but who knows.Â 
Â 
His image will be greatly rebuilt during and after Episode 9. Pretty excited for Stan, Jon and Mel. Just hang in there.

Don't give them any ideas
2232	Electric Wizard	2014-04-22	I think what irritates book-readers most about this is the fact that the great majority of the little changes which set our own teeth grinding whilst watching the series do seem to be completely unnecessary in our eyes. On the whole, the merging together of minor characters and relocation of certain events in place and time are understood to be part and parcel of making a TV programme, due to the time and money constraints they have. We get that. But, why remove great, character-developing, fan-loved lines from the books like those mentioned above in favour of others (though not always bad ones) written by the writers. Yes, it's an adaptation, but there seems little need to deviate in these minor things for no obvious gain.
Â 
The Stannis we know and love doesn't need softening. Again and again the best scenes in the series turn out to be taken directly or closely adapted (in spirit, if nothing else) from the books. Dillane is a great actor. For me, he IS Stannis Baratheon when he's given good lines and allowed to act the character from the books. The writers need to trust more in the source material, the cast and, most importantly, the audience. No character from the books is black or white. People understand that in real life too and Stannis' flaws and inner turmoil make him all the better a character. That said, he doesn't need painting as weak, lustful and downright evil in the way they have. If they want to have him leading from the front at Blackwater or whatever else for 'cinematic value', then fine. But for everything else, for Stannis the character, why fix what isn't broken?
2233	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-22	Unlike Stannis, I believe Jaime's been a bit whitewashed in the show. Except for scenes like Alton's murder and Cersei's rape, Jaime is much more likeable than in the books to me. He seems genuinely concerned about Brienne and doesn't treat her like shit all the time. He loses his hand trying to save her and doesn't appear to be really trying to kill Brienne in their duel. It's a bigger bromance in the show and he has more respect for her. That's why I think they will easily salvage Jaime this season yet. I really doubt it that people will still hate him after he sends Brienne to rescure Sansa, defends Tyrion in his trial, helps him escape and shits on his own reputation when writing the White Book. People will look back and see his last scene with Cersei as a relapse he quickly recovered from.
Â 
Stannis, on the other hand, will take some more time until he becomes more likeable to the non-readers, most likely by season 5 only. The only things about him that were whitewashed were his love for his daughter and his bravery in battle, while the rest of his positive qualities were omitted. Remember that there wouldn't be a "Stannis the Mannis" in the first place if he hadn't personally climbed the walls of King's Landing, but it's been a while since that happened, so they would have to do more to his character to make him likeable again. Maybe we will see him slaying a giant by himself?


Â 
I wouldn't say this is necessarily true. Book!Stannis has not really had any screentime with Shireen, so it's kinda hard to tell if they are "whitewashing" his character in this circumstance. Though it is surprising thing that they decided to develop and expand on this aspect of Stannis's life and actually make it positive. EDIT: I do get what your saying, but I think "whitewashing" might not be the best term since it is an *unknown rather than changing a negative trait or action into a good one or ignoring it all together.
Â 
*Though the times she does get mentioned by Stannis, he does seem to care about her. There just has been no long scene about her with Stannis.
Â 


why the fuck is there a Jaime and Rape discussion here


Â 
1. For once, someone got "blackwashed" worse than Stannis.
Â 
2. It's comparing the two.

2240	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-22	What are your thoughts about the season 2 Stannis?


Speaking for myself, I think season 2 Stannis is almost perfect with the exception of the omission of Proudwing. Him choking Mel is whatever compared to his amazing scene with Davos on the boat where he names him Hand of the King. "You'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge," is an awesome line, and classic Stannis. The fact is, he is darker and more villainous before he goes to the Wall, it's just that he isn't nearly as heartless or as stupid as D&D are portraying him, which is why we're all so pissed off. The fact that George wasn't consulted about the Jaime-Cercei sept scene shows just how little control he has over the show, and perhaps just how little control he has over their portrayal of Stannis.

This is what I don't like about the show. D&D allow their bias of characters to warp their perception of the story, so ultimately at points Â the show watches like a badly written fanfic.Â

Yup. Such an awesome tumblr made by Stan-stans.Â 
Which one?
2245	rmholt	2014-04-22	I know the "infidel" line irked some Stannis fans but I thought it fit in with a frustrated impatient king with inner skepticism at an emotional point trying to brush Davos off, trying several lame lines that he didn't believe himself. I'm a big Stannis fan, book and TV.  Book Stannis did threaten Davos often and burned banner men because Mel told him he'd get good winds to the Wall. He only does what she advises when it suits, or won't hurt, his purposes.  The "infidel" - he didn't say it with much conviction. Threats to Davos weren't empty either. Davos thought Stannis might be angry a lot more than he actually was and feared Mel more than he needed to. But when Stannis hauled out Lightbringer over Gendry, Davos had to do some fast reading.

2246	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-23	My biggest problem is that they so openly express their opinions. This opens everything in a new light, making everything so much more bias on their part. Thats my take atleast. I may be wrong


Â 
I think it's good. At least people who argue with us can't say it's all in our heads when we claim they are biased against him.
Â 
Also, should we start taking bets on if his men will be shouting "STANNIS" or "MELISANDRE" ?
2247	Areo Speedwagon	2014-04-23	Â 
If you think our problem is him being portrayed as frustrated and confused, then you have no idea what we're upset about.
Â 
It's the change from a morally complicated man who ultimately tries to do the right thing to a villain who for some reason is still around when the hero of the story, Tyrion Lannister, defeated him two seasons ago.


Â 
Been following these threads since the beginning of the season.Â  I'm a bit of a show apologist, but I'm more sympathetic to the other viewpoint now having gone through these threads.
Â 
As for him being changed from a "morally complicated man who ultimately tries to do the right thing...," you're not wrong.Â  I think part of the reason is it's a more visual story for the time they have for Stannis.Â  How the show allots time is another discussion.Â  That type of complexity in a character takes a long time to develop as it has to be done visually by nature of the medium.Â  In the books, Davos does all the heavy lifting in his head for us.Â  Stannis has some Walter White complexity going on, and as much as I would watch an entire hour of Stannis and the gang, he just doesn't have as much time to grow as someone like Walt did.
Â 
And as to the 'him still being around,' that's why a few of my Unsullied friends have started to take interest.Â  They said that with even Robb Stark not making it, this grumpy guy with a fire witch is still here...
Â 
I do think they're setting Stannis up for a choice: KL or The Wall, and his being more whiny and prickly and glum and villain-ly will make his decision that much more attention getting.Â

I think we'll hear Melisandre or Lord of Light and his victory will be attributed to magic rather than his fantastic military manoeuvres.Â
2251	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Come on. His victory will clearly be due to heavy mounted lance riding down a bunch of raggedy bumpkins. As for how they'll portray him, remember that Neil Marshall is directing. Stannis being a kickass warrior was his idea, not GrrM's. In GrrM's script Stannis just hung out at the back of the fighting and yelled shit. Neil Marshall decided to have him fighting up front to contrast Joffrey. SoÂ with that in mind,Â we'll probably end up with Stannis slaying giants or something of the sort.

2253	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-23	The "Stannis!" chant not going down would be lame, but i could live without to be honest. I suspect, like KS pointed out,Â that he will just be a badass kickin ass. Loved the Blackwater battle with Stannis being the first guy up the ladder
Â 
If Stannis slays a giant ill fanboy hard
2254	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	GrrM said just that in his commentary over the Blackwater episode, Stan the ManÂ (and he was majorly annoyed that Stan didn't have a helmet on). He also commends Stephen Dillane for playing someone like Stannis, who he says he imagines is a hard character to play due to his being so charmless and quick to complain etc.

I still major doubts that they will allow Neil Marshall creative license this time around when D&D are so hell bent on ruining Stannis. At this point, i just don't see it.
2256	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Aggh. They aren't hell bent on ruining anything. Just you wait.

According to you man. You know we both have very differing opinions of the show and their characterisation of Stannis.

Â 
Stannis will spontaneously make Dalla appear in that episode and he will have sex with her while fighting a giant (yes, both on horse). Then, she'll get pregnant and give birth in the same episode.
2259	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	I know we have different views on it, Stan,Â but no one who chooses to adapt a work sets out to ruin it. I just don't like to see their motives mischaracterized. Without them there'd be no show. Period.
Â 
Having just rewatched a snippet of Blackwater now I'm hyped for "the Watchers on the Wall". It is going to be awesome. A lot of the gory sight gags came from Neil Marshall's own deranged mind, so this time around again we'll have some pretty creative killings on display since they gave him more time in pre-production to map out the episode.

I really encourage Neil Marshall to keep amping up Stannis' badassery. We may not get any profound or complex speeches from him, but at least make him a badass warrior and leader.

2263	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Well since they've already established him as being a pretty kickass fighter, Queen of WhoresÂ Â so (in the very least)Â for consistency's sake they'll likely keep that up. And I would like to see Davos getting some killing done, he does carry a sword after all and he had a great battle yelling voice in Blackwater. Also Liam Cunningham and Neil Marshall are old friends, so for old time's sake Neil will give him some badassery.

Davos gets his onion ready and the Mammoth in sight. He throws with all his force hitting the giant beast in the head and knocking it to the ground. He quickly races in to plunge his sword Onionslicer into its head.Â

Basically this.
2270	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-23	I just watched the episode again and they are really portraying the WIldlings as marauding savages that will rape, kill and eat everything in their path. They are also really downplaying Castle Black's strength so Stannis's arrival is going to be epic.
Â 
It also looks like Davos will get his triumphant moment when he gets the Iron Bank on their side or he convinces Stannis to just through his meagre forces at the Wildlings. Â
2271	sati	2014-04-23	Basically this.


Â 
Neil Marshall's ending to Blackwater made people cheer for Lannisters, smile with Cersei of all people. Marshall knows how to make a great freaking ending. I'm optimistic.

Â 
I have read many posts on Stannis on this thread, and this is one of the best.Â  I really hope this is where its going: TheÂ CHOICE of Stannis between glory or duty.
Â 
For instance, the Iron Bank of Bravos will either (a) turn Stannis down but Davos will manage to rummage up a few thousand troops somewhere or (b )Â give Stannis some cash to hire sellswords.Â  Stannis will then say "To King's Landing to claim my rights to the throne!" but Davos will then refuse and "remind him of his Duty and not his rights.Â  Save the kingdom to become king line....."Â Â  Stannis will become angry and throw Davos in a cell and the scene will end.Â Â  Based on Stannis' unfavorability at this point of the show, most unsullied will think Stannis is going to King's Landing.Â Â  The Battle at the Wall will resemble the darkest moments of the Battle of Helm's Deep with a frantic Jon Snow rallying a losing Night's Watch against foes from both sides.Â  Just when Jon Snow finally kills the Magnar and the last of the southside Wildlings,Â  Mance's troops start breaking through the tunnel (climbing the wall???).Â Â It appears all hope is lost with a wounded Jon Snow and Company (Janos is cowering somewhere I bet) resign themselves to death when a single warhorn blows in the East and Stannis' troops enter the fray.
Â 
I know this sounds like lame fan fiction, but Areo's post got me thinking as to the big picture of Stannis arc so far.Â  If what I wrote above is in any way remotely close to what actually happens, its going to melt both my own and the Unsullied's faces.Â

Man you are getting me excited now.
2274	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Well, they will have Jon treat with Mance because we have that shot of him riding through the tunnel under the Wall with a torch and also a shot of Mance running through his camp while horsemen charge (from one of the TV spots posted on the GoT youtube channel). Since Qhorin made no mention of it, I doubt they'll include the Horn of Joramun now butÂ they've stillÂ made the wildlings outnumber the Watch greatly. This means that Jon won't have much negotiating power and that Mance will be wanting things on his terms and disregarding the concessions the Watch would have him make. That will definitelyÂ cast Stan's arrival in a positive light.

A Queen Shireen is currently my best guess for who sits on the Throne when the series is done.Â  Martin won't pick any character who has been front and center so far, but he also wants a character who makes sense.Â

That'd be cool. Lose the really heavy Angel/Devil dynamic and show what Stannis is like without people whispering in his ear constantly, so people can get a sense of what he's really like when he's not suddenly leaning one way, and then the other.

but who knows if they will put the mountain clans...
2290	gvewolf243	2014-04-25	Imagine if we'd get a scene of him getting the Mountain Clans on his side.


That would be great. Seeing how he uses Jon's advice and gets the Clans. Scenes in the North and at the Wall with Jon , is time to show his badassery , but i have a little hope for it , knowing what was before in the show. Â ( Between , D&D think , that Stannis will be very bad king , lol ).
2291	Bronn Urgundy	2014-04-25	Imagine if we'd get a scene of him getting the Mountain Clans on his side.


Â 
Just for giggles they should throw in a scene where Stannis has to defeat a clan champion to win the clan... Okay, thats a bit far
Â 
Also, just watched the episode, the disgust for sellswords seems to come from the fact that they have no money, and "not enough men to raid a pantry" combines Stannis' dry humour with the fact that he knows the strength of every house. Good job there, I think.
2292	Bronn Urgundy	2014-04-25	Also, this really puts the S3 finale into perspective, its always been Mel who's told Stannis to fight the great war by winning the Throne, that was merely a continuation of that, as the sparing of Davos to gather troops shows, but it'll still be Davos who says "to the Window, to the Wall!"
2293	The Onion Sleight	2014-04-25	Who is going to support Dillanes scenes while he marches on WinterFell? Stannis needs a buddie to do the scenes....at best Asha is supposed to be a prisoner.


Â 


I guess they could flesh out Justin Massey.


Â 


Â 
or not. the scenes in the north are really stannis' time to shine. it might be best to strip him of a buddy.


Â 


Â 
That'd be cool. Lose the really heavy Angel/Devil dynamic and show what Stannis is like without people whispering in his ear constantly, so people can get a sense of what he's really like when he's not suddenly leaning one way, and then the other.


Â 
I would love to see Justin Massey on the show (They'd have to cast a very handsome actor, of course with beautiful, white blonde hair and long, fancy bangs which always fall over his eye. Someone who fits to this "boyband knight" image  ) and I loved him and Asha in ADWD and her relationship (I love Asha and Justin generally both  ), and to see all these dynamics between queen's men / king's men / Northernmen / Asha / Stannis...
but I know what you mean; this is really Stannis' time to shine and nobody should distract the watchers / distract attention away from him!
Â 
Â 


Imagine if we'd get a scene of him getting the Mountain Clans on his side.


Â 
Oh, yes, yes, YES! I always wanted to see this "on-page"(?), so at least now I want to see this on-screen.
Stannis listening to Jon's advice and then how he "eats their bread and salt, drinks their ale, listens to their pipers, praises the beauty of the beauty of their daughters and the courage of their sons" and that all presumably with a loooot of annoyed teeth grinding and impatience and not much passion - I absolutely want to see this!
I always wondered how exactely that took place... I know, it was The Ned's little daughter who brought them to his side, but if he was really at their feats, listened to pipers and all, I'm more than proud of him .
Â

Â 
They should show everything! His badassery and humour:
Â 
- "You haggle like a crone with a codfish, Lord Snow. Did Lord Eddard father you on a fishwife?"
Â 
- "Her own father got this child on her? We are well rid of her, then. I will not suffer such abominations here. This is not King's Landing!"
Â 
- Jon: "The freefolk despise kneelers. . . Let them keep their pride and they will love you better."
Stannis: "It is swords I need from them, not kisses."
Â 
- Melisandre: "His grace is going fond of you."
Jon: "I can tell. He only threatened to behead me twice."
Â 
- Jon: "No, Sire. I agree these castles must be garrisoned-"
Stannis: "The boy commander agrees. How fortunate."
Â 
- Stannis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Do I need to make you swear an oath before a tree?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Jon: â<U+0080><U+009C>No.â<U+0080><U+009D> Was that a jape? With Stannis, it was hard to tell.
Â 
- Janos Slynt: â<U+0080><U+009C>Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Stannis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Any of you, I would think. Even the cook."
Â 
- Jon: â<U+0080><U+009C>Two score, small and large. Flint, Wull, Norrey, Liddle ... win Old Flint and Big Bucket, the rest will follow.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Stannis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Big Bucket?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Stannis + Jon / NW = comedy gold 
Â 
My hope is also... not sooo big... But I'm still sure we will see a wonderful "Edd, fetch me a block!" scene (since Janos Synt finally appears more / appeared again this season), with Dominic Carter crying "I have friends in KL, important friends!", Kit Harington chopping off his head (I really like his development this season so far!), then looking to Stephen Dillane, their eyes meet, and then: Dillane giving the epic Stannisnod of approval! (It will ROCK! I can so well imagine this scene with Stephen & Kit!)

ill kill myself if they dont have that, and Stannis' nod from the tower
Â 
I feel as if, if anybody should die, during the Battle at castle black/the wall it has to be janos Slynt, though.... he's a total punkass!

Â 
(I love the Jon / Stannis relationshipÂ  Â  and how much Jon's boldness amuses Stannis XD)

There's that rumour here that maybe Thorne will die... I think it's pretty likely Grenn, Pyp or Edd will die ... and of course Ygritte... and who else  no idea (Janos should kindly stay alive, Edd has to fetch the block in season 5).

No way dude, haha.Â 
Â 
If Dance and Feast are gonna be the next two seasons they need to have Janos getting his head lopped off in s4(maybe in the middle towards the end) and his stabbing at at the end of s5. That's my take at least. theyre already in feast arcs for certain people this season

Â 
But Jon needs to be the LC to punish Slynt's insubordination. Why should he have the right to kill Slynt this season, when he's only an ordinary crow? (I agree that the stabbing will be the season 5's ending).
Of course, if Janos dies at the BoCB, there won't be "Edd, fetch me a block" for him, but it's unlikely I think (unless they want to use another character for that).
Â 
"Edd, fetch me a block" happens in ADWD, after Stannis' offer, the LC's election, some Jon/Stannis talking, aso... and I reckon (no, I'm actually very sure!), this season won't even reach the end of the Wall arc of Storm.
Â 
If the ninth episode ends with "ASOS - Jon X", you can't put the "Samwell IV", "Jon XI", "Samwell V" and "Jon XII" stuff in the tenth episode, especially when this episode already includes "Only Cat!", "Wherever whores go", hopefully the reveal of LS, maybe Arya's arrival in / journey to Braavos; they needed the most GCI budget for this episode and the title is "The Children", so also Bran & Co. and Dany; I've heard of the cast of an Ironborn captain for his episode, so maybe also Greyjoy stuff... hell, I have no idea how exactly this episode should look like o.O
Â 
Following the ASOS chapters after "Jon X", I would expect:
Â 
- Jon's and Stannis' (and Mel's) conversation on the Wall, Stannis' offer
(Pretty sure, LC election will happen in season 5, Stannis' offer and the election in ONE episode would be veeery strange and you can't have much Wall in this episode with so many other storylines, and leaving Jon this season with his thoughts about becoming Lord of Winterfell or not, would be a great season's ending for him)
- Jaime frees Tyrion, "Wherever whores go", Tywin's death
- "Only Cat", Lysa's death
- Many people expect we will leave Arya this season with her getting on a boat to Braavos or arriving there
- LS (as last scene)
Â 
Then - because of the huge GCI budget and title - probably also:
- Bran & Co. meeting the Children of the Forest and fighting against the wights
- Dany having problems with her dragons, Drogon killing a child
Â 
And maybe (because of cast rumours):
- Finally Balon's death?
Â 
How on earth will they manage this ?! There can't be 8 storylines in one episode, IMO.
But I mean, Tyrion's, Sansa's and LS's storylines will be THESE episode's highlights and shock moments, Bran and Dany sound pretty much confirmed, but they also have to show The Wall and the battle's aftermath, even if 4.09 is already full Wall centred (I mean, people'll want to know what happens there after this and after the BoCB 4/8 chapters, so the half of the them, are Jon or Sam POVs).
Â 
Will some of these events happen earlier, so 4.08 / < 4.08? Will we leave some characters already so early this season? I have no clue ...
Â 
Â 
Â 
Edited: But my wish for 4.10 is definitely the Stannis/Jon conversation on The Wall and the "Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty..." line, that together with the legitimisation offer (and the rest of their dialogue) would make great season's endings for both, Jon and Stannis.

Haha, hey, no problem!

I had a dread thought: the dire wolves were found at the site of a dead lion with a spear from the antler of a dead stag in its neck. So Stannis might be at least as doomed as the Lannisters 


Â 
Huh, when did this happen? I only remember the dead direwolf (without a lion) with the antler of season 1 / AGOT, but I was referring it to Ned and Robert (both dead now). Stannis is luckily still very aliveâ<U+0080>¦
But you can easily say, that pretty much more than half of the characters can be considered as doomed Â  (but I wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give up hope till TWOW is released).
Â 
Â 
I had also a thought: What will Mel do in the rest of the season? We know sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s certainly together with the host at Castle Black in 4.09 and Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure we will see her burning Orellâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eagle (Carice already said something about time on a horseback this season and a stunt woman) and as from 4.10 then, she stays with Jon & Co. at Castle Black.
Â 
But I heard something about her having a bath scene and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s this picture: http://37.media.tumb...bszkbo2_250.gif
(search in the web for â<U+0080><U+009C>Melisandre bath sceneâ<U+0080><U+009D> or â<U+0080><U+009C>Melisandre taking a bathâ<U+0080><U+009D>, it sounds pretty confirmed).
Carice also said weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see more of Melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s things: http://www.thegate.c...ame-of-thrones/
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>In the fourth season you do see a little more of Melisandreâ<U+0080><U+0099>s room and the stuff she usesâ<U+0080><U+0093>she has a little cabinet of powders. This one puts people to sleep, that one makes men wildly lustful, this one will kill you instantly.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Soâ<U+0080>¦Melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s room, her magic powders, a bathâ<U+0080>¦ When should this happen?! Certainly not at Castle Black and absolutely not on that ship, so it must be her room in Dragonstone. Will we see something like â<U+0080><U+009C>In the meantime, in Dragonstoneâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D> when Stannis and Davos are in Braavos or what? 
I really hope it wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be an awkward Stannis / Mel farewell scene before the journey to Braavos, with Stannis gatecrash her taking a bath and seeing her naked andâ<U+0080>¦ *remembering beach scene* Â  urg, No!
Â 
But she wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t show him her powders, so more likely a Mel-alone or Mel/Selyse scene? In an episode before 4.09?

2301	petertel123	2014-04-26	I disagree that stannis has been butchered completely, although the series has definitly made some missteps (mostly in season 3).
take a look at this:
http://www.youtube.c...h?v=AmEkKsKwycM
this really shows the stannis that I loved in the book.
"Robert told me to hold storms end so I held it, then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up, insult or not I gave it up, because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and I've always done my duty, but now I'm the rightful king by every law of westeros and when I sit the iron throne you'll be my hand."
this is stannis, the man that holds duty and justice in such high regard, and the man who cares little about a mans blood.
season 3 definitly did things wrong, mostly during the sacrificing.
But so far I've liked him in season 4, during the burning scene he looked disgusted to me (a stark contrast to his wife's enthusiasm) .
the problem as I see it is Mellisandre, because he seems a far better character in scenes that don't involve her.
The casting of stannis was flawless (like most GoT castings), Dillane is almost exactly how I pictured stannis in my head and his acting is great.

Agreed about season 2 Stannis. He was truly awesome. My favourite scene of his:Stannis: You will command the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
Davos: Your Grace, I'm honoured, but... the other lords... they won't be happy.
Stannis: Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason.

Pure Stannis.

I also loved the contrast of stannis fighting in the front line while joffrey cowered back to his mother during the battle of blackwater

Yes please! It's sad that in most scenes we've seen Stannis in, somebody else is making the decision for him. We need to see him more in-charge.
I would love to see Justin Massey on the show (They'd have to cast a very handsome actor, of course with beautiful, white blonde hair and long, fancy bangs which always fall over his eye. Someone who fits to this "boyband knight" image  ) and I loved him and Asha in ADWD and her relationship (I love Asha and Justin generally both  ), and to see all these dynamics between queen's men / king's men / Northernmen / Asha / Stannis...
but I know what you mean; this is really Stannis' time to shine and nobody should distract the watchers / distract attention away from him!
Omg if they cast Justin Massey & actually keep the ~boyband knight~ image, I'd do a happy dance! He amuses me so.  Just imagining him fixing his hair while Stannis fucking Baratheon is talking to him makes me  everytime.

Â SoMels room, her magic powders, a bath When should this happen?! Certainly not at Castle Black and absolutely not on that ship, so it must be her room in Dragonstone. Will we see something like In the meantime, in Dragonstone when Stannis and Davos are in Braavos or what? I really hope it wont be an awkward Stannis / Mel farewell scene before the journey to Braavos, with Stannis gatecrash her taking a bath and seeing her naked and *remembering beach scene* Â  urg, No!
Â But she wouldnt show him her powders, so more likely a Mel-alone or Mel/Selyse scene? In an episode before 4.09?

Maybe we'll have scenes of just the ladies in DS while Stavos sails to meet the IB...  I could see Mel showing Shireen or Selyse the powders & other magic stuff. Though I have no idea which other character will be with her in the bathscene (there *has* to be someone else there, right?) .. It's not gonna be Selyse or Shireen (why would they interrupt her there?), so it could only be Stannis  or maaaaybe Davos.
2307	The Onion Sleight	2014-04-27	Dear Onion Sleight: I need to stop posting before coffee. Thanks for not zapping me.


Â 
Hihi, don't worry . No Problem!
Â 
Â 


Also, this really puts the S3 finale into perspective, its always been Mel who's told Stannis to fight the great war by winning the Throne, that was merely a continuation of that, as the sparing of Davos to gather troops shows, but it'll still be Davos who says "to the Window, to the Wall!"


Â 
I've thought about this... Show!Stannis still thinks Gendry could have helped him, he's still willing to rely on (dark) magic, he's still wild about Davos; that's actually his condition after Davos smuggled Edric away, but BEFORE Davos shows him the NW's letter.
We all know that happens in the books after the deaths of the other ursurpers. Show!Stannis already saw the letter, but actually is this situation now (let's forget for a moment the strange decision of Balon's still alive)!
Â 
If the show wouldn't have messed up the storyline, then his behaviour would make more sense at that point of the story.
But because they changed the arc so strangely, I could imagine they wanted to postpone / want to move the moment, in which Stannis listens to Davos and begins to realize that magic is the wrong way to fight for the IT and that he must do something active, must do his duty, save and care about his kingdom; deeds (in the North) instead of Mel's sacrifice-ideas (on Dragonstone).
Â 
This moment hasn't happend till now - but going to Braavos (an idea of Davos) is the first step. The Letter to the Iron Bank is also something Davos has done by himself, without Stannis' permission, but he seems to find it later a good decision and act of Davos (despite every anger), because we know he will sail to Braavos. And then -when the IBoB plot happens in this way I imagine it will (or in a similar way)- Davos will still be the person who turned Stannis' focus to the North.
Â 
It seems to me as if the moment of "Stannis relies on magic, Davos does something without his demission, Stannis is super angry, Davos comes out with a new plan, he makes his king realize which way he should use / go, he reminds him on his duty,..." is somehow moved to his season, even it should have happend last season.
At the moment the anger and desperation is still there, there's no right "direction", no realization - but this all comes NOW (<- the next episodes) / will come soon! He and Davos will leave Melisandre behind on Dragonstone and "set sail with a new strategy" as the episode 6's description says. And then my IBoB-theory and... -> Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!
Â 
(It will never be "Book!Stannis! Book!Stannis! BOOK!STANNIS!" on the show, but Show!Stannis isn't lost till now. Maybe his men can cry "(Show)Stannis! (Show)Stannis! (SHOW)STANNIS" in ep. 9 without only-show-watcher thinking "Oh no, not he!")
Â 
Â 


Omg if they cast Justin Massey & actually keep the ~boyband knight~ image, I'd do a happy dance! He amuses me so.  Just imagining him fixing his hair while Stannis fucking Baratheon is talking to him makes me  everytime.
Â 


Â 
That would be awesome, wouldn't it?  I love Massey (Don't fail in Braavos, Justin, or else !). If he would appear on the show, his hair tick has to appear, too! He shouldn't distract attention away from Stannis, but maybe they could cast Richard Horpe, too and give them both, Massey and Horpe, buddy-bitchfight-rivalries  (y'know, to make a Death March through a fucking blizzard funnier).
I would find this trio humorous, it wouldn't been this heavy "Angel & Devil whispering in the king's right & left ear", much more "The awesome Mannis and his two different, barmy sidekick knights, courting for His Grace's attention".

this is stannis, the man that holds duty and justice in such high regard, and the man who cares little about a mans blood.
season 3 definitly did things wrong, mostly during the sacrificing.
But so far I've liked him in season 4, during the burning scene he looked disgusted to me (a stark contrast to his wife's enthusiasm) .
the problem as I see it is Mellisandre, because he seems a far better character in scenes that don't involve her.
The casting of stannis was flawless (like most GoT castings), Dillane is almost exactly how I pictured stannis in my head and his acting is great.


Â 
  absolutely with you about the Season 2 Stannis, this scene (wonderful!  ), the mistakes in season 3, Stephen Dillane , a.s.o...
and I agree especially with you about Melisandre. She's still (IMO) Show!Stannis' biggest problem:
Â 
It's not Mel herself, it's definitely not Carice; it's their relationship and -When I think about my show-watching mother and sister- the fact, that many people believe Mel's the evil incarnate.
Â 
My sister (who is a total Unsullied, but knows that I'm a absolute StanStan) said once: "I really don't hate Stannis. I absolutely hate the Fire Bitch" (My mother and sister always call her "Fire Bitch"). Oh, and she really hates my constant laments about "character assassination / butchery", I understand this, espically when we watch together a new episode, during this I must be very annoying...
Â 
My mother (who's also an Unsullied, but allows me to spoiler her everything I want. And "Spoiler" is my second name  ) thinks, once all that awesome Stannis "The King who cares" Baratheon in the North stuff happens, she will warm up to him (I've already spoilered her the all storylines till the TWOW Theon sample chapter). I've told her also more about the Mel / Stannis and Mel / Jon relationships in the future and in her opinion, when he marches without Mel through the North, then she'll definitely warm up to him.
Â 
Both think, if he would get rid of her, they would like him much more... Both think at the moment he's absolutely under her influence... Both think it's more Mel's story than Stannis' (Okay, my mother luckily knows the truth now)... Both think Mel's evil. Really evil. Because their biggest problem with her is actually: They want to know, what exactly Mel wants from Stannis; why does she think he's AAR?; what does this mean: Does she REALLY believes this? Or does she -their opinion so far- pretends this, because she wants to exploit him for her -for us unknown- purposes? And since she's evil (or at least her actions so far are evil) = evil purposes.
Â 
I have to admit: Before her own POV, nobody really knew the truth about Mel's belief in Stannis being AAR, and her POV definitely changed opinions about her.
Sometimes for the worse ("She always fails with her prophecies", "Her thinking is narrow-minded and naive", "There's no mysterious, cool, plan behind her belief in Stannis, she backed the wrong person the whole time", "She knows she's actually somehow wrong, but won't give up her opinion about AAR, how dumb"),
sometimes for the better ("It's good that there's no evil plan behind her belief, her intentions are really good", "She never pretended to believe something, she wouldn't believe", "I can understand how she holds on her faith / opinion / Stannis and doesn't won't to admit her mistakes and that she was wrong the whole time, that's somehow human, human failure".)
For me, it was the second case.
Â 
Â 
On the show, Stannis and Mel are a duo, they nearly always appear together (since season 3) or if one of them alone, it's mostly Mel.
Even if D&D want to ruin Stannis' coming arc in the North, one thing they can't change (Yes, I'm sure it's impossible. Even for them) is the fact, that Stannis and Mel will part company at a moment on the show, they'll go separate ways (Now we could argue about how much â<U+0080><U+009C>separate waysâ<U+0080><U+009D>, but letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s say for a moment for both definitely physically separated).
Â 
And, IMO, that will be fucking good for both of them! It will help them much and it will help their portrayals.Â 
The whole Team Dragonstone (Stannis, Davos and Mel) is at different places later, they all have their own storylines, they all interact with different main (or big secondary) characters. Everyone of them is involved in the great, wonderful, important North arc, everyone with her / his own, different involvement. ("Stannis is Mel's bitch" WILL stop!)
Â 
When show watchers now donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about S, D and M, they canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t avoid caring later for them (I hope it). They wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t no longer sitting in Dragonstone, having no contact to other main characters, being â<U+0080><U+009C>irrelevantâ<U+0080><U+009D>; they become extreme important, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll meet a bunch of characters, who the watchers love / hate or will love / hate, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re at the Wall (one of the most important places in Asoiaf / GoT), White Harbour (a cool new location for the Unsullied) or marching to Winterfell (is there one person who doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about what happens to Winterfell? One of THESE centre places since season 1).
Â 
And whether you love or hate Jon, and whether you love or hate Jon on the show, I think he will help Stannis and Mel very, very much!
Nobody can deny that the show loves one-on-one dialogues (thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of the many reasons why they give Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing so much â<U+0080><U+0093>unnecessary- screen time) and I could imagine season 5 having many Jon/Stannis and Jon/Mel dialogues. I hope (and think) they will benefit them.
Â 
Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of the most loved main characters (one of my motherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and sisterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s favourites, too) and the show should use the potential of his relationships with these characters.
Jon e.g. spends more than one book with trying to NOT root for Stannis, but then roots more and more for him and accepts more and more at the end, that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s quasi in Team Stannis.
Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s struggle with his / the NWâ<U+0080><U+0099>s neutrality and how the avoids to back and support Stannis too much, but does it evermore, is one of his most important aspects in his ADWDâ<U+0080><U+0099>s / LCâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arc. Jon lovers should see and understand it.
I also hope theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see that Stannis and Jon are a good team, their mutual respect, that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re similar in many points, that these are the guys who really think and care about the Northâ<U+0080><U+0099>s situation, the Wildlings, Boltons, the Others (when the most people donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give a shit about this), things like the Stannisnod, Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s tip about Deepwood and the Mountain Clans, he warns Stannis about the Karstarkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s treachery, Stannis saves their all lifes, offers him Winterfell, promises to bring Arya to Jon (if he can), how they handle the situation with the Wildlings, â<U+0080>¦ (you all know what I mean).
Â 
And about Mel: I guess, the most Unsullied will be shocked when they see her staying with Jon at the Wall and they will worry about him, when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see Mel courting for Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trust and friendship, but maybe theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll wonder, whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s really the deal with Mel and see that it hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t to do with Stannis, it has to do with AAR.
When Stannis leaves her behind and has later an army with Râ<U+0080><U+0099>hllor-, The Seven-, The Old God- (and one Drowned God)-worshippers, but sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not with him, the religious thing has nothing to do with her influence, but with his queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men (The battle is still dependent on his men, his supporters, but not on Mel) and then finally the Unsullied should see the pragmatic atheist (Okay, I could imagine the show would doing something so dumb like making him to burn innocents instead of cannibals. But making him to trying to burn a Northman and explain this dumb behaviour to watchers would be too difficult for D&D, I hope).
Â 
They will (and should) show the burning of "Mance", positively, and how the Wildlings should burn Weirwood tree brunches, certainly, but hopefully we wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see Mel running through Castle Black and trying to burn / proselytize everyone.
They should use her at his time to explain more about the AAR prophecy and the Great Other and the Others and her growing interest in Jon, but also how she misinterprets what she sees and her mistakes. That she's an ultimate "The end justifies the means" or "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" character, no villain, but also definitely no good person; which won't bring her much sympathy, but maybe at least maybe more understanding.
Â 
Okay, and want should I say about Davos? IMO itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s impossible to NOT love him and I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe that people exist who didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t enjoy his ADWD arc (do they exist?). Manderly + Freys + Davos is a badass + Fake Death + sad letters + â<U+0080><U+009C>The North remembersâ<U+0080><U+009D> + Rickon + Skagos + aso (Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll cut Lord Borrell and Sweet Sister)... You have to love the Onion Knight and his storyline.
Â 
Â 
So, briefly speaking: Every Dragonstone character should benefit from having their own storyline in the future.
Don't get me wrong: I absolutely love them together! Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no team I found more interesting and better in ASOIAF than these three. Their dynamic and relationships to each other are by far the best and most fascinating for me (whether itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Stannis/Davos or Stannis/Mel or Mel/Davos or of course Stannis/Davos/Mel), but on the show the separation will do them good, and since weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re here to talk about Stannis, I want to emphasize, ESPECIALLY Stannis!
People should see him making decisions alone (but still listening to good advice), being the awesome leader who leads his host through a blizzard, becoming one of the most important persons, whose fate will also decide the fate of the North, aso.
And no matter how much the show wants to screw him up or ruin his story â<U+0080><U+0093> they canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t ruin it totally and can't delete the important part heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to play!
(They can lesser it, yes, and knowing the show they will, and probably my hopes are shit and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll even manage to make his march to Winterfell looking like something bad)â<U+0080>¦ But at the moment Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m hopeful :-)
Â 
I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know why (maybe because of my many ADWD Jon / Davos / Theon / Asha / Mel rereads over the last time)â<U+0080>¦ Or maybe Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m just today in a super special hopeful phase.
Â 
(or maybe it's the fact that it's here 2 a.m. and I'm tired... so sorry for grammar / spelling.)

2310	The Onion Sleight	2014-04-27	I'd honestly watch an entire show of just the Awesome and Hilarious Adventures of Stannis, Justin and Richard.


Â 
Me too! I'd love every second of the show

(This reminds me orf some very hilarious fanfics I've read XD)

2311	rocksniffer	2014-04-23	i am curious if anyone else is wondering if Tywin was the killer of Joffrey...after all he was aware of Joff's tendencies and knew he was not cut out to be king...could he have been the mastermind behind the poisoning...his position was in jeopardy (remember last season when he and the king had words in front of the throne...) if Joff decided to put him aside for someone else...gramps might have decided to move on to a more easily manipulated grandson...just this old asshole's thoughts feel free to disagree...Â  
Â 
Â 
...discuss
2312	Woman of War	2014-04-24	I think the episode heavily suggested this: Tywin demonstrating a certain understanding with Olenna, then Tywin's speech to Tommen, Margaery  seems to have been unaware of the poisoning plan, finally Tyrion's suspicion verbalizing the viewers' thoughts........
We saw two sides of Tywin: the kindly educating grandfather and the one who acts if education does not take roots. Joffrey did not grasp what it means to be king and Tyrion still had emotions and semtimentalities left. Both failures who do no longer forward the Lannister case, if of a different kind. 
So they received Tywin's personal kind of wisdom.

2313	ovis alba	2014-04-24	I agree that the show somehow hints it a lot.
In the show he has been shown several times making plans and interacting with Olenna. And in addition to the Tommen speech and Tyrion's comments I would also add the encounter with Oberyn. He overall seems extremly aware of what is going on and who to blame and who not.
The only thing I'm really not sure about is if they wanna distract from the actual reveal or if they really want to hint that there has been something going on beyond what most think from the book version.
2314	rocksniffer	2014-04-24	i also noted upon rewatch that Tywin was standing in the same general direction Joff pointed in...
Â 
...i have suspected that he would have preferred Tommen, who not only is more pliable, being younger and of course not insane like Joff, but also i feel that Tywin was concerned after the marriage etc, Joff would refuse to continue Tywin as Hand,
Â 
...in addition after casting Jamie aside, and killing Joff, Tommen would not only be king but an acceptable heir to the Rock...Tywin has repeatedly emphasized his concern above all with the family and the name continuing, who better to put as Lord of Casterly Rock that a son of Tommen's who had been properly raised by Tywin and not controlled/ruined by Cersei...i noted how he completely ignored her like she was not there, during his 'what makes a king' speech over Joff's dead body...Â
2315	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-24	I've always been unsure about whether he was responsible or not, but the show does hint at his possible involvement quite strongly. Also, whereas Tommen in the book is younger and a lot weaker, show Tommen is still a fairly nice, innocent kid, but he's at least a bit older than book Tommen to the point where Tywin would perhaps be happier with him as king.
2316	AzorAhai42	2014-04-24	My biggest issue with Tywin being involved is that he always puts family first. It's the one redeeming quality of his character. He hates and loathes Tyrion, but he wasn't about to kill him. Humiliate him? Sure, but kinslaying? I don't think Tywin can kinslay. I could be wrong. I'm sure lots of people disagree with me.
2317	Raksha 2014	2014-04-24	I could definitely see Tywin wanting Joffrey dead, for the sake of the family as well as the realm; the kid was a loose cannon with demonstrable viciousness and no little self-control, and in just a few years, he would reach his majority and no one would be safe from his whims, including his own mother and Tywin himself. Â But I don't see any hints in either the book or the show that Tywin actually did anything other than wish Joffrey dead; I don't think he was ready to act on his disgust with his grandson. Â
2318	Hippocras	2014-04-24	My biggest issue with Tywin being involved is that he always puts family first. It's the one redeeming quality of his character. He hates and loathes Tyrion, but he wasn't about to kill him. Humiliate him? Sure, but kinslaying? I don't think Tywin can kinslay. I could be wrong. I'm sure lots of people disagree with me.
Keep in mind the books may eventually change our views on Tywin. If his funeral stench proved anything it was that he was corrupt to the core.

Â 
i honestly think that Tywin would sacrifice Tyrion to keep him from becoming heir to the Rock. He needs a Lord for Casterly Rock, the family is nothing to him without his holdfast and the wealth it brings, he told Jamie during E01 scene that he didn't expect to see the Rock again, alive...since Jamie is barred by being in the king's guard (and by choice) and Tywin has already refused Tyrion and Cercei, then Joff and Tommen are the only 'pure-bloods' he has left...and i think we have already had plenty of evidence that he wasn't happy Joff was it by default.
Â 
No, the more i watch and think of the things he has said...back to his first scene's cleaning the deer in season one, i am more convinced that he could and would not hesitate to kill a king, or a family member, to secure what he wants...
Â 
...just more opinions from a salty old fart.... Â

But would he stand in the way if someone else was going to do it?
2322	TheWanderer	2014-04-24	gramps might have decided to move on to a more easily manipulated grandson...


Â 
Though Tommen isn't just easier for Tywin to manipulate but also Margery, and even Cersei. Having him be King doesn't really make Tywin's position all that secure.
Â 

...in addition after casting Jamie aside, and killing Joff, Tommen would not only be king but an acceptable heir to the Rock...

Â 
The King doesn't seem to inherit the families traditional holding. Robert was no longer Lord of Storm's End after he became King and Stannis seems to have believed that Storm's End was his by right. This suggests that Tommen would already be a potential heir to the Rock, perhaps only behind Tyrion in terms of legitimate succession. That of course is a strong motive for Tywin to dispose of Tyrion; having Joff proclaim his brother legitimate heir (to the Rock) whilst still pliable and then have Tommen spirited away to be raised by Kevan. It also means that eliminating Joff is irrelevant.
Â 
who better to put as Lord of Casterly Rock that a son of Tommen's who had been properly raised by Tywin and not controlled/ruined by Cersei
Â 
Tommen's what, twelve, eight? There's no way in hell Tywin lives long enough to raise his great-grandson to maturity. In the mean time Tyrion will have fathered children, presumably, who will have a stronger claim to the Rock. And while Tywin doesn't like Tyrion much he seems perfectly willing to his his children.

Â 
He puts the Lannister house first. He doesn't care about any of its members on a personal level, except Jaime to some degree. Joffrey was becoming a detriment so he probably saw his death as a good thing.
2324	Mad Monkey	2014-04-24	He puts the Lannister house first. He doesn't care about any of its members on a personal level, except Jaime to some degree. Joffrey was becoming a detriment so he probably saw his death as a good thing.Based on my understanding of his character, Tywin would never allow another House to take advantage of his own in such a manner. You are right that he puts Lannisters first over everything, even the actual members of the family, but that's just the reason why he would not just allow Olenna or Margaery or anyone else to just kill his grandson like that.Tywin seethes with open revulsion and loathing at Tyrion, to the point where he seems to tacitly blame Tyrion for the death of his own mother. He considers Tyrion inheriting the Rock to mean the destruction of House Lannister. He even wishes that he could somehow prove that Tyrion isn't really his son.But when Tyrion was taken by Catelyn, Tywin didn't just sit on his hands and say, "well, maybe he might get killed and I can be free of him," He called his banners and set the Riverlands ablaze.That's what Tywin does for family members that he clearly hates. I can't imagine that he would sit back and allow the Tyrells or anyone else to just pick off other members of his family whenever it pleases them. If Tywin decided that Joffrey had to die, Tywin would have done it himself.
2325	Bratchild	2014-04-24	I could only imagine that he'd rage even more, if he knew that Olenna was not only behind Joff's death but that she had framed his son and kidnapped his daughter in law. I think that Tywin is subtle enough that if he wanted to kill Joff,it would have been in a different manner. Killing Joff at his own wedding is simply embarrassing.Â
2326	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-24	â<U+0080><U+009C>The boy is thirteen. There is time yet.â<U+0080><U+009D> Lord Tywin paced to the window. That was unlike him, he was more upset than he wished to show. â<U+0080><U+009C>He requires a sharp lesson.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Now I'm looking at this quote in a completely different light. First of all he's pissed as fuck, he says Joff needs a sharp lesson (and we know the kind of sharp lessons Tywin gives, like the one he taught the Reynes and Tarbecks), and "there is time yet" is wonderfully ambiguous: it could mean, "there's still time to kill this fucker before he grows up and rules on his own"
Â 
So, yeah, I don't think the show going there, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happened
2327	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-24	Based on my understanding of his character, Tywin would never allow another House to take advantage of his own in such a manner. You are right that he puts Lannisters first over everything, even the actual members of the family, but that's just the reason why he would not just allow Olenna or Margaery or anyone else to just kill his grandson like that.

Â 
I agree with you. I wasn't insinuating that Tywin knew about the assassination, only that it turned out to be a blessing in disguise for him.

2328	dbunting	2014-04-25	Have to agree that I do not believe Tywin knew it was going to happen, but that he isn't too upset that it did. He knows the Lannister family will be better off without Joffery around, and we know all that Tywin cares about is the legacy of Lannisters
2329	JesterX	2014-04-25	There was really no indication that Tywin ever felt threatened or not in control of Joffrey where he would want to kill him.Â  RememberÂ last season finale when Tywin sent Joff off to bed and told Tyrion, "you're a fool if you think a crown makes him (Joffrey) the most powerful man in Westeros."Â  There was also the scene where Joffrey called Tywin to counsel him on the dragons, he clearly had Joffrey intimidated.Â  Joff or Tommen, Tywin knew he was in control and would continue to be.
Â 
My question is why, on the show, would the Tyrells would want Joffrey dead?Â  Margeary clearly had her own control over Joffrey.Â  He wasn't hurting her and she could persuade him to do the things she wanted.Â  I think the show screwed that storyline up.

2330	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-25	There was really no indication that Tywin ever felt threatened or not in control of Joffrey where he would want to kill him.Â  RememberÂ last season finale when Tywin sent Joff off to bed and told Tyrion, "you're a fool if you think a crown makes him (Joffrey) the most powerful man in Westeros."Â  There was also the scene where Joffrey called Tywin to counsel him on the dragons, he clearly had Joffrey intimidated.Â  Joff or Tommen, Tywin knew he was in control and would continue to be.

Â 
They were in control of Joffrey? You think he kills Ros, makes a scene at Tyrion's wedding, makes fun of Renly, Loras, Tyrion at his own wedding if he was under control?
Â 
They might be able to control him a little bit while he's young, but once he gets older he'll become a much bigger problem.

Â
2331	Bratchild	2014-04-25	I always took it that the QOT killed Joff to protect her granddaughter. The entire speech Olenna gives Marg during their scene had me convinced she'd do anything to protect Marg.
2332	Skore	2014-04-25	Even in the show Tywin says something like "he may be the least of us but he's a Lannister" regarding Tyrion's abduction by Catelyn.
Â 
So no, I don't think show Tywin would have killed or have stood back and let Joffrey be killed as it would weaken the Lannister's reputation and embolden their enemies if they were allowed to kill Joffrey with impunity.
Â 
However, the scene at Joffrey's funeral bier made it perfectly clear that Tywn was coldly dismissing Joffrey as yesterday's news (and good riddance) and making inroads on Tommen's education while ALSO making the point to Cersei that she's already screwed up one king, she won't have the chance to screw up another.
2333	go joff go	2014-04-26	My biggest issue with Tywin being involved is that he always puts family first. It's the one redeeming quality of his character. He hates and loathes Tyrion, but he wasn't about to kill him. Humiliate him? Sure, but kinslaying? I don't think Tywin can kinslay. I could be wrong. I'm sure lots of people disagree with me.


Book tywin would also never have a who're in his bed.
2334	Tywin Smokin a Blunt	2014-04-26	This episode certainly implied that Tywin was in on it, or at the very least considered it a happy accident.  I also found his discussion with Oberyn late in the episode fascinating.   I had always thought Tywin was in Cersei's camp during the trial,  but the show seemed to suggest that he was trying to rig the trial in Tyrion's favor.

No, he was trying to rig it AGAINST Tyrion.
He was positively giddy in this episode. Joffrey being dead was a great thing for him even if he didn't do it, and now he had an opportunity to rid himself of the lawful heir to Casterly Rock who he considers unworthy. He wants Tyrion convicted.

as is mentioned with the whole lone wolf/pack....as he witnessed first hand what one king (the Mad King-born from inbreeding) did to his own family and the fact the Targs for all intents and purposes are dead, would you think heÂ  would be willing to suffer another inbred mad Lannister king and risking the death/destruction of his family?Â  He does hold family very high, he seems only to care about his family and his legacy.
Â 
It wasn't the first time I thought Tywin killed Joffrey so I wasn't surprised by the show, especially considering how Tyrion kept insisting he should be heir to the Rock.Â  I think Tywin might have actually might have been worried he could get it by default.Â  Considering the hand he played in the Red Wedding.... Tywin not only rids himself of an insane child king by poisoning him, but gets rid of nuisance who actually has the only real claim to the Rock after he dies....by killing Joff, blaming Tyrion who he was supposedly the whole time planning on sending to the Wall.Â  Its a TyWIN WIN WIN.
Â 
Once Tywin became Hand Tyion kept pestering him about his legal rights, and while still a Lannister, Tywin was embarrassed of him.Â  Its one thing to suffer a dwarf to live with your name, its another to "allow" him to inherit the Rock (and legacy) that he had just spent a lifetime repairing, in his eyes after his own father allowed the Lannister name to flounder, he didn't want Tyrion to do the same.Â 
Â 
So he rules the realm and has time to convince Jaimie of choose an heir he would like without Joffery effing things up or having to worry about Tyion trying to get the Westerlands.Â  The ironic part is I am sure Tyrion would have risen to the challenge as Lord of the Rock, as he did as Hand of the King...Tywin though the Imp would be content with the North via Sansa I am sure.
Â 
or as Tyrion does say in the show, Tywin never misses as chance to USE a tragedy to his advantage.Â

2338	The Dragon Demands	2014-04-20	Using the HBO Go subtitles to confirm the spelling, this is what Tywin says to Tommen:
Â 
"Orys the First was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?"
Â 
Â 
....this creates all kinds of problems.
Â 
At first I thought he was slurring "Aerys the First" or possibly "Aenys the First"...though they're both a stretch.
Â 
The problem is that there is no king who ruled for less than a year but was then murdered by his own brother (the only king to rule one year was Viserys II, but he was an old man, and his brothers were dead by that point - his last brother being the previous king).
Â 
Aerys I was not murdered by his own brother, or at least I'm fairly sure Maekar I never did that. And he ruled for many years. On top of that Aerys I was an infamously weak, do-nothing king, not a great reformer.
Â 
Aenys I...may have attempted reforms but been killed by Maegor the Cruel, his own brother. We don't know how Aenys I died in the books.
Â 
A RUNNING GUESS which I have is...maybe they thought that "Aenys" sounds too much like "anus" on TV, and in the TV continuity he's been renamed Orys? It's actually not much of a stretch to say that Aegon I would name his firstborn son after Aegon's Hand of the King and only close friend. Though it is weird to say that Aenys/Orys ruled only one year when he ruled for a few more than that (though not the biggest change in the world).
Â 
The other possibility is that "Orys the First" was an important ancient Storm King or something, but not a king who sat on the Iron Throne.
Â 
This is a serious problem.
Someone with access to Cogman via twitter (i.e. Westeros.org) really needs to ask about that one.

Sandor turned into a thief two episodes after he declared he is not a thief. In the books he is the least hypocritical character, and always calling others out on their BS.
Â 
Neither one of them is a 'good person' but Jaime's loyalty for his sister and Sandor's honesty were important redeeming qualities for them. Apparently the show has to make it all black and white.

The show always does dumb things like this. Stannis fighting on the front lines without a helmet was probably the most ridiculous scene on the show. "Hey I'm the King so let's charge into a field of enemies with nothing but my thinning hair to stop an arrow or a sword".
Â 
This is the same show where Dany lets her dragons get kidnapped. So she's a complete moron. Standing near a city wall with archers, completely unprotected, is normal for show Dany.

Â 
It bugged me because it looked like it was meant to irritate fans, rather than making sense. Narratively, I don't think it was that bad, although it was out of place and time. In books, Jaime has JUST got back to KL and has just seen Cersei after almost a whole year.
2362	Obebb	2014-04-21	That Shireen and Davos scene was so terribly predictable. As soon as he picked up that book I knew it would somehow reference the Iron Bank and he'd have a crazy epiphanyÂ  Â .so typical.

Â 
-Don't like how relatively calm Tyrion is at the whole" Im locked up for a crime I didnt commit" or lack of anger, this is supposed to be his breaking point, and why he cracks later, with the trailer seeing him cry(presumably after Oberyns death) really you see the character change. Tyrion laughs manically after Oberyns death, he has no self pity and starts crying, he literally starts to loose himself a bit.

The subject of Tyrion seeking a trial by combat hasn't even been raised yet, so I'm sure we'll get the scene with Bronn.

Though possibly after betraying St. Tyrion we will see Bronn chased by demon children and hang himself from a tree in remorse.

Â 
The thing with Stannis and his shiny head in the BW is basically that if you put him a helmet he looks just the same as the other hundreds of extras. The same happens north of the wall. You'll never see the main characters use a scarf covering their faces or hat even if their whiskers are freezing. We may not like it, but it was a decision the costume people from HBO made to make it easier to recognise the characters.

Oh yes this is bothering me as well. They have already completely ignored Loras's skills as a warrior, and in every scene he is in the focus is on his love/sex life. And now they are doing it with The Red Viper.

2388	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-21	Dunno if they are gonna do Darkstar, let alone the hunting him down plot, Sarella is the more likely Sandsnake, given that Sam's a main character and will need characters to interact with in Oldtown.
2389	Hoo	2014-04-21	I don't understand Oberyn's problem with Tywin when Cersei daughter wedded in Dorn. Â Shouldn't they be allied by now? Â This is an inconsistent plot.
2390	Ran	2014-04-21	Having seen the broadcast script, D&D invented a King Orys. Fairly sure he's intended to be a Storm King, though of course the name Orys is not originally from the stormlands.Don't worry, Oberyn's daughters are safe.
2391	Flou	2014-04-21	- So Jaime is borderline rapist, okay it did get consentual in the end, or maybe they have a safeword that Cersei didn't use so Jaime knew it was okay even if she was saying no...
- Hound is a thief apparently.
- Dany standing just few meters away from Daario who is about to get trampled by a horse. The book scene with Strong Belwas was more entertaining.
- Can we not have Oberyn flirting with men in every damn episode he is in? I get it already, he is bisexual and highly active sexually, I don't need half of his scenes to be just useless flirting with a made up malewhore when he could having actual proper conversations with "real" people.
- Olyvar the male version of Ros.
- Why is a house from the Riverlands sworn to House Frey siding with Stannis? Would they not get murdered like in a fucking split second if they actually did that... I know it's a stupid fucking thing to nitpick about, but I don't really get it why they are using House Haigh instead of a House that would be a lot more plausible unless they are just trolling book fans.
- I guess Loras will never join the Kingsguard since they decided to cut his brothers from the show and the House Tyrell needs a heir. Great decision indeed...

Â 
Cersei's daughter isn't 'wed' in Dorne, she is a 'ward' in Dorne in a very slightly less 'hostagey' way than Theon was a warn in the North.
Â 
Edit: typo. warn = ward.

I remember their reasoning being something like: "We decided, that Sansa should marry a Tyrell we know instead of an unseen character." I too think it's a stupid change. Unless Euron kills both Willas and Garlan or something like that. Speaking of house Tyrell why did they lower their manpower. Littlefinger says that after the Starks and the Lannisters the Tyrells command the largest hosts and Olenna says that House Tyrell has provided about 16 00 to the fighting. That would mean that of the 100 000 men Renly had over 80 000 were from the Stormlands which makes no sense since the Starks , the Lannisters and the Tyrells have the most men. Basically: Lannisters: 60 000 Starks: 30 000ish (if Baelish added the Tully strength to it) which means that the Tyrells have -30 000 and the Baratheons have even less. So where did Renly pull those 40 000 - 60 000 men from. AND WHY DOES HOUSE KARSTARK COMMAND HALF OF THE NORTH'S FORCES (in S3 blu ray history videos Roose even says that house Bolton is the second most powerful family in the North). I think, that it's more than confirmed that some of the GOT writers are pretty sloppy with some of their writing by now.
2396	Dain Storm	2014-04-21	Inconsistency. Just ignore it.

Well both the S206 and S305 (the episodes where these numbers come from) were written by non D&D writers. So at least the main writers know what they're doing right...Â right?

Â 
What's odd is that the scene where Robb tells us the Karstark numbers, as well as the completely false claim that the Frey's remained neutral in the war, was written by Bryan Cogman, probably the best writer for the show, as well as the guy they rely on to fix up any small inconsistencies in the plot, like numbers and sigils and stuff. Kind of weird for him to make such glaring mistakes in his own episode, unless D&D specifically told him to include those comments.Â
2399	Batman	2014-04-21	Â 
Using the HBO Go subtitles to confirm the spelling, this is what Tywin says to Tommen:
Â 
"Orys the First was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?"
Â 
Â 
....this creates all kinds of problems.
Â 
At first I thought he was slurring "Aerys the First" or possibly "Aenys the First"...though they're both a stretch.
Â 
The problem is that there is no king who ruled for less than a year but was then murdered by his own brother (the only king to rule one year was Viserys II, but he was an old man, and his brothers were dead by that point - his last brother being the previous king).
Â 
Aerys I was not murdered by his own brother, or at least I'm fairly sure Maekar I never did that. And he ruled for many years. On top of that Aerys I was an infamously weak, do-nothing king, not a great reformer.
Â 
Aenys I...may have attempted reforms but been killed by Maegor the Cruel, his own brother. We don't know how Aenys I died in the books.
Â 
A RUNNING GUESS which I have is...maybe they thought that "Aenys" sounds too much like "anus" on TV, and in the TV continuity he's been renamed Orys? It's actually not much of a stretch to say that Aegon I would name his firstborn son after Aegon's Hand of the King and only close friend. Though it is weird to say that Aenys/Orys ruled only one year when he ruled for a few more than that (though not the biggest change in the world).
Â 
The other possibility is that "Orys the First" was an important ancient Storm King or something, but not a king who sat on the Iron Throne.
Â 
This is a serious problem.
Someone with access to Cogman via twitter (i.e. Westeros.org) really needs to ask about that one.
Â 


Â 
This. I don't think it would be a Storm King, the only Orys we know of is a Targaryen bastard who happened to marry a Storm Queen and become Hand of the King.Â
2400	Duckface	2014-04-21	Omg, there are just SO MANY things that are wrong with this show...
Things i didn't like the most:
1) Tywin being a total idiot. Tywin asking Oberyn for a help against Daenerys? For real? Are you serious? Why does Tywin believe fairy tales about dragons? Why can't he offer just a seat on a small council, that is already a big enough deal? Oh, Tywin expects that the only house in the Seven Kingdoms, that was most loyal to Targaryens will fight dragons for a house, that butchered princess of Dorne and her children. If Tywin truly believed there are dragons, he wouldn't have even suggested to fight against them. Oh, silly Tywin, even Joffrey seems smarter than him, because he figured the dragon thing a lot earlier.
2) Tyrion making self-sacrifice... c'mon, lame scene to make Tyrion look good before killing his father. Look, look, it's all black&white, and Tyrion is the good guy
3) Making Thenns absolutely evil. How Jon Snow is expected to treat with them and even giving them a Castle? They could exclude Thenn's later, of course, but it's a deviation from the book i would not like
Â 
Everything else was fine in this episode. I enjoyed Dany's sequence.
2401	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-21	Tommen is too old. I'm currently rewatching season 2, and he was a little kid back then. Now he looks like Joffrey's nice twin.
At least a short fight sequence between the Champion and Daario would have been nice.

As I understood they wanted to draw the Night's Watch out of the castle, because it's easier to kill them that way. Th Night's Watch already knows the wildlings will come both from south&north via Jon Snow.

But they don't know that Jon Snow lives. Originally it should have been a surprise-attack.
2408	Rysler	2014-04-21	- Jaime the rapist
- Super-creepiness of Thenns
- Gilly staying at the Wall prior a massive wildling attack is actually an option?
- Sam getting more screen time than Jon
- Sam the supposed craven having to tell people he killed a Walker instead of them reminding him
- Oberyn's constant bi- and/or brothel-moments, as if there's nothing else to him
- Tyrion and Oberyn not being buddy-buddy before the trial
- Dany standing in lines of fire
- Stannis threatening his #1 homeboy
- the Hound's inconsistent morals
2409	Mark Antony	2014-04-21	-Yeah let's give The Hound this cool edgy line about how he is not a thief and then completely disregard "the code" an episode later. Idk just seemed lame. The attempt at comic relief during those scenes didn't work at all this time either.
- Sam and Gillys scenes. Fuck me those were boring
- Aiden Gillen is truly awful. He was so good as Carcetti in The Wire and even as LF in season 1. Shame 
-New Tommen. I'm sure he''ll make a good puppet but he certainly is no "outlaw beets" Tommen 
- Tyrion and Pods scene made me laugh for some reason

Jaime's little incident was really bad. If it was supposed to be consensual then it certainly didn't come off that way. I guess in that case the fault lies with the director, possibly even Lena and Nikolaj which is pretty damn rare.

Littlefinger's accent all over the place again.
The Margaery/Olenna and Tywin/Tommen scenes dragged on a bit and consequentially the Jon and Dany scenes ended up feeling pretty rushed.Â

Gods I hope not. She's my favourite minor character in the books. If she married a Thenn from the show she'd end up getting eaten, and not in the good way.
I'm so sorry, I couldn't resist
2417	RumHam	2014-04-21	Tywin: It's said you studied poisons at the citadel

The fact that blood was streaming from his every orifice probably also should have been a clue.
2418	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-04-21	I'm not sure if I disliked the Tywin-Oberyn scene more or the Mereen one. Just as Dany is met with crucified slaves on the way to the city, she's met with more incredibly vanilla, non-threatening characters the further she is from Yunkai. The contrast between Westeros and Essos is practically a farce at this stage. Sure, why not stand there within range of a couple hundred archers. It's Essos. They all have storm trooper aim.

Â 
99% sure she'll be cut. I like her character, and what Jon does with creating the House of Thenn is important, but I just can't see them devoting the screen-time to it. Instead, they're using the Thenns to really up the ante of the Wildling invasion; before this, the only Wildlings we see are decently sympathetic (with the exception of Craster, who's dead now).
Â 
It's not a change I love, but I can get on board with it.
2421	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Oh, and, IMO, Oberyn would never believe Tywin, and it seems he did here.

- Gilly filler... Yes, thank you for elaborating, Samwell, you worry about Gilly, we understand.Â 
- Wall scene... the Wall just lost its S01 atmosphere
- Wildling assault. Ehh... I can't put my finger on why it was meh and wtf

Oberyn whore scene being very repetitive to his introduction. I don't think it was necessary. I hope his character will be fleshed out more other than just relying on 'hey, I am Bi and whore horny!' The whole brothel scene was pointless and has nothing to do with the story. Just HBO filling in their T&A quota.

2432	Le Cygne	2014-04-21	I hated what they did to Jaime. They change characterization and don't think it's going to matter, but it does. Like, I guess now that Jaime is a rapist, he won't be cutting the head off Pia's rapist. Maybe he'll offer up his own head, retroactive justice?And the Hound, too. So in a later episode this season, he's going to show Arya how to give the gift of mercy. In the books, that was showing his softer side. Arya said he did it "almost tenderly." On the show, he would say why bother, he's going to die anyway.They not only fucked these two characters up, they made their stories with Brienne and Sansa irrelevant.They got into it on the review here, they are using Sandor as an Arya prop, starts at 25:00 in the video:http://www.westeros....ilers/#Analysis

Petyr Baelish is the great-grandson of a poor immigrant from Braavos. He grew up on the Fingers, a spit of rocky coastal land that is known to be remote and harsh. His family's holdings are on the smallest of the Fingers. Despite being a Lord, his origins makes every Lord and Lady look down upon him as if he was some yokel. Much like how the English have traditionally seen the Irish as beneath them.

2443	ultraviolette	2014-04-21	I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with the episode. Here are the things I didn't like
- The Jaime/Cersei scene should have not been depicted as rape
- Not a big fan of the Arya/Hound scenes. I just don't get the feeling of emptiness from Show!Arya which is very important in the books. In addition, it seemedÂ  totally out of character for Sandor to be breaking guest right
- Sam/Gilly : BOOORRING and unneccessary. Would have prefered a longer Jon scene. Does he actually know what happened to Winterfell? In the books he learns about Robb and and Winterfell at the same time
- whitewashing of Tyrion: why the hell does he care so much about Podrick? In the books Pod tells BrienneTyrion left him behind
- Oberyn and Stannis could benefit from some better writing. I never got the impression that Stannis relied so much on the Red God or that he really believed any of that nonsense
2444	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-21	The Jaime/Cersei scene was poorly done.
Â 
Every scene with Daenerys ends up being tedious. The writing and dialogue of people asking to be her champion is terrible. I'm a massive fan of the show and think most of the writing is great, but it's terrible and tedious in all of her scenes.
2445	Sirar Salih	2014-04-21	- Cersei/Jaime sex just didn't make the same impact as it did in the books
- Davos/Shireen filler... Davos is really not that interesting... and I seriously doubt this will make viewers remember the Iron Bank of Braavos
- Gilly filler... Yes, thank you for elaborating, Samwell, you worry about Gilly, we understand.Â 
- Wall scene... the Wall just lost its S01 atmosphere
- Wildling assault. Ehh... I can't put my finger on why it was meh and wtf
- Hound/Arya scene way too bloody long again
- Oh and the lack of reaction when hundreds of arrows were flying in Daenerys's direction. Like "Step back, Khaleesi!" or something?Â 


So I take it you didn't like this episode?
2446	boojam	2014-04-21	The Jaime/Cersei scene was poorly done.Â Every scene with Daenerys ends up being tedious. The writing and dialogue of people asking to be her champion is terrible. I'm a massive fan of the show and think most of the writing is great, but it's terrible and tedious in all of her scenes.Totally disagree.
2447	boojam	2014-04-21	A minor gritch.Preview trailer for Season 4 episode 4.On the wall at Meereen, KILL THE MASTERS is written in English.We have seen some written Valyrian.Would not bother me at all if that had of been written in HV with an English subtitle.
2448	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-21	Got the impression that was Meereen's 'shot across the bow' type of thing.
Either that or someone had calculated , seeing the bows they had what their range was.


Â 
Makes sense, though still a little odd to me.
Â 


So I take it you didn't like this episode?


Â 
No, it was alright. Rather meh. But I wouldn't say I didn't like it.Â
2449	R'hllor the Fabulous	2014-04-21	So much wrong with this episode.
Jaime turned into a rapist.
Thenns running around with axes which look like cheap decoration from a gothic store.
Thenns being ridiculously hammy cannibals. Guess the whole House Thenn thing isn't going to make it in the show.
Littlefinger just can't act.
Every Essos scene just feels like the laugh track is missing. Everyone just stands around awkwardly and spout their lines.
Hound being a thief.
More stupid Oberyn brothel scenes.
Show Stannis.
Sam and Gilly wasting everyone's time.
2450	Wsaharan	2014-04-21	Sigh... another pompous valyrian speech. I personally hate those. Would have been so much better if Daenerys had just raised one of her creepy pitch-black eyebrows and said something like "give them my message". I mean it's pretty obvious.
And the way her voice carries far and wide. No one should be able to hear a thing. They would be like "hey what's she saying? Something about whales?"
Got me thinking of the first scene in Monty Python's Life of Brian. "Blessed are the cheesemakers?"

2451	SlowLoras	2014-04-21	I don't understand the hatred over Aiden Gillen's accent for Littlefinger.
Â 
Petyr Baelish is the great-grandson of a poor immigrant from Braavos. He grew up on the Fingers, a spit of rocky coastal land that is known to be remote and harsh. His family's holdings are on the smallest of the Fingers. Despite being a Lord, his origins makes every Lord and Lady look down upon him as if he was some yokel. Much like how the English have traditionally seen the Irish as beneath them.
Â 
I concocted in my head that Baelish puts on a posh accent to impress nobility.


Â 
The thing with accents is, the characters aren't from our world. How do we know what a Vale accent sounds like? I quite like the idea that Littlefinger's putting on airs and graces to impress the King's Landing crew, but removed from that world he reverts to what he really is. Of course, it's more likely that Aiden Gillen's just not bothering with the accent anymore but it doesn't bother me at all.
Â 
Things which did bother me:
Â 
- Is Olyvar the male Ros? Do they only have one boy whore in the whole of King's Landing?
Â 
- Sam & Gilly's scene would've been better if it was shorter. It wasn't bad, really (except the whore questioning Gilly, who seemed to be channeling Osha's weird sideways-neck-twitch) but...I just think there were other things they could have spent more time on.
Â 
- Not a fan of Missandei's actress. She's very wooden and one-note, imo.
Â 
- Not even going to go there with the horribly rapey sept-sex scene, except to say that they managed to make it even squickier than the books.
Â 
- Did not like Tyrion, saviour of Pod. I've been a fan of Tyrion, for the most part, but it just seemed pretty out of character to me.
2452	Rapsie	2014-04-21	The brothel / sex scenes are becoming such a joke. Â They just show a placard half way through each episode saying â<U+0080><U+009C>and now we have the soft porn sectionâ<U+0080><U+009D>. Also Oberyn looked like he was wearing a Hawaiian Shirt and Chinos while he was lying on the bed chatting to Tywin.Â 
Â 
Cannibalismâ<U+0080>¦.why? Apart from shock value.Â 
Â 
Meanwhile in next weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode St Tyrion will become the bird man of KL caring for injured animals that flock to his cell to be cared for by him. His gift of healing will spread and the poor will gather outside his cell to hear his calming voice.Â

Sansa is a high noble and he certainly want to impress her, so I don't think that's it.
Â 
St Tyrion is really getting on my nerves. The way this scene was shot was cringe worthy. Could they be any more blatant in making absolutely sure everyone sees what a noble hero he is?
Â 
John's plan with regards to Mance is nonsensical. 100 or 1000, Mance needs to attack, what else is he supposed to do? Plus he should have a general idea of the number of NW men, especially given that he used to be one before. Why would Mance believe anything Jon had told him after he betrayed him anyway?

I think they are going to shoot themselves in the foot as for unsullied viewers St Tyrion strangling Shae is going to come across as a "Jump the Shark" moment. Unless of course they make Shae the only witness to come forward at the trial and make sure that it is only her testimony that has Tyrion sentenced to death, whilst humiliating him of course.Â
2455	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-21	I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with the episode. Here are the things I didn't like
- The Jaime/Cersei scene should have not been depicted as rape
- Not a big fan of the Arya/Hound scenes. I just don't get the feeling of emptiness from Show!Arya which is very important in the books. In addition, it seemedÂ  totally out of character for Sandor to be breaking guest right
- Sam/Gilly : BOOORRING and unneccessary. Would have prefered a longer Jon scene. Does he actually know what happened to Winterfell? In the books he learns about Robb and and Winterfell at the same time
- whitewashing of Tyrion: why the hell does he care so much about Podrick? In the books Pod tells BrienneTyrion left him behind
- Oberyn and Stannis could benefit from some better writing. I never got the impression that Stannis relied so much on the Red God or that he really believed any of that nonsense


Â 
Initially I like how they're showing Arya still has a good heart and the humour between her and the Hound is enjoyable. However, I do agree with you on this one- with Arya and Jon. I feel as if she has her moments (when she murders) but then sheÂ just seems to shrug the whole thing away.
Â 
I need more Stark Grief! Their situation is heart-breaking- home in ruins, power and armies gone, father beheaded, brother and mother disgustingly brutalised....You can't just shrug that all away. Arya during the RW and Season 3 finale showed her grief well and Sansa during the first two episodes of this season....however, Jon? Nope, not even a sense of him feeling heart-broken, angry or even numb about the whole thing. I will be sincerely disappointed if we don't get more acknowledgement/grief from Jon regarding the Stark's situation, especially if he shows anger over Mormont being killed (when he deals with the mutineers) and Ygritte dying but not his family. They nailed the love he has for them in season 1 ( 'I may be a Bastard but Robb is my brother, I should be with him')
Â 
I know in the books we don't see Jon find out about the RW but he does acknowledge it and show grief at certain points ( Ghost reunion- "I thought you had left me like Robb and Ygritte"). Jon being unable to do anything for his wronged family (facing the reality of his vows)Â is a huge part of his character development and leads to his response to the Pink letter. However, the show turned 'Robb is dead' into 'aww, poor Jon, always second best' and not 'aww, poor Jon, his familyÂ is in ruins'
Â 
...Robb was his brother, not just his rival! However, Jon didn't seem to give two hoots. What happened to that 'when I woke up the world had fallen apart' quote?
Â 
Sorry, rant over! I just wish the show would establish the closeness of the Stark family (which makes them so lovableÂ and tragic)Â more since we don't get to hear their thoughts and bittersweet memories. They really did a fantastic job with it in Season 1 but I feel as if it's slipped, especially establishing Jon and Robb as brothers...the Will scene etc.

2456	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-21	Saw the episode again. I think it's up there with "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" as one of the worse of the entire series.

Unless of course they make Shae the only witness to come forward at the trial and make sure that it is only her testimony that has Tyrion sentenced to death, whilst humiliating him of course.Â 


Â 
I agree. Â It's going to be similar to Jamie raping Cersei. Â They made Shae SO NICE that no amount of false testimony is going to counteract the past seasons of her being goody goody. Â If Tyrion kills her it will be "GOT is trying too hard to shock people" because they have totally fucked that storyline up.
Â 
Or, they'll have Tywin do it, and then St. Tyrion will remain, unblemished in his glorious white hat.
2458	Clariana	2014-04-21	Isn't me or didn't Dorne already have a seat on the Small Council? It was simply that following Elia's death and the rise of the Lannisters they refused to occupy it.

I was just about to post the exact same thing!
2460	Mark Antony	2014-04-21	Saw the episode again. I think it's up there with "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" as one of the worse of the entire series.
Definitely one of the worst ever
2461	Valerius	2014-04-21	In the movie Tywin uses it as a major incentive to induce Oberyn to ally with the Lannisters, but in the books it struck me as not something open to negotiation - A Prince of Dorne has a seat on the council by right.
2462	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-21	The Freys are masters of the Riverlands already? And they aren't doing a good job as protectors? How can they be governing already when the Red Wedding only happened a short time ago and they shouldn't even have taken over Riverrun yet? And wouldn't the smallfolk be concerned about the devastations of the recent war, the anarchy in the land, and the coming winter at this point?
2463	RumHam	2014-04-21	The prince of Dorne/Dorne itself is not guaranteed a seat on the Small Council, neither are any of the other kingdoms. Â In the book Tyrion offers Doran a seat as an adviser and he doesn't respond until eventually Oberyn comes in his place.

Â 
This is my big problem. The standard of these scenes is really poor compared to the rest of the show and some of the dialogue's terrible. Selmy and Mormont are the only supporting ones who are doing really well, standing out and actually making the most of some of their tedious dialogue. I like the show and think some of your other criticisms are harsh, but you're spot on with this one.

I'd be interested in the direct quote from the books if you could find it. Most likely in a Tyrion chapter.
2467	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-21	Sam and Gilly are sweet together, but it seemed like their scenes this episode were a bit lengthy.Â 
Â 
If the Night's Watch sends out rangers to deal with the traitors at Craster's house, does that mean that Coldhands will be excluded from the show?
Â 
I hope the show will reintroduce the Mountain in episode 4, and give Stannis some more screen time.

Â 
They really need to do this soon, and give the guy some screentime before the duel so that we actually get a greater sense of injustice and hatred for him when he kills at Oberyn. It's arguably the best scene in the entire book, but the show could risk just turning it into Oberyn fighting a generic big guy.
2469	Mark Antony	2014-04-21	Yes Coldhands is out

Tyrion will murder Tywin avenge Shae's murder.Â Meanwhile, Sansa will say, I wish the Hound Tyrion were here. She keeps his bloody Lannister cloak with her summer silks. She pretends she kissed the Hound Tyrion, imagines the Hound Tyrion is there to rescue her, and dreams of Tyrion turning into the Hound.When Tyion gets to Essos, he will rape free the sex slave. Jorah and Tyrion will become instant enemies fast friends. Jorah will obsess forget about Dany and capture kneel before Tyrion...

2473	Red Tiger	2014-04-21	This episode has almost everything I hate.
Â 
Jaime and Cersei love scenes, Samwell Tarly and the completely unsympathetic Night's Watch, awful Essos acting and more evidence that they really can't translate Littlefinger and Sansa well to TV.
Â 
Please D&D give me an episode that is mostly Olenna Tyrell, pretty please.
2474	Rapsie	2014-04-21	<snip>

Oh Lord that is funny!
I don't know what the producers are going to do as either Shae will have to become uber-evil bitch (possible given D&D's general  misogyny) or they are going to have St Tyrion " jump the shark" and kill her.
2475	Mr. Kraken	2014-04-21	The whole ending scene was terribly produced. It was very showing that they used green screen, what the hell happened to HBO's big budget production values? The Meereenese knight was so ridiculous, Daario has no presence at all, Daenerys looked weak and the Great Masters looked stupid as hell by letting their slaves hear her speech. Not to mention Daenerys standing at firing range.
Â 
Sam and Gilly was poorly written. "I don't want you to be raped, I'll hide you among whores!" And he's going to study to be a maester.
Â 
You know, last episode they made Oberyn Martell and Loras Tyrell flirt. Weren't House Martell and House Tyrell supposed to hate each other? That, to me, was symbolic that they are valuing sexposition over storytelling, so I'm not really surprised about how they're treating Oberyn.
Â 
Jaime and Cersei was meh.Â
2476	Misnthropia	2014-04-21	My Nitpicks, pretty much the same as everyone elses really.
Jamie Rape scene. They spent so much time building redeeming qualities for Jamie only to literally piss them away. 
Speaking of pissing things away, Emelia Clarke. GTFO. You suck. Your bland acting is making me hate Dany even more. 
"Ill do it" "No Ill fight him Dany" "No let me!" Enter Daario. Why couldnt Daario just volunteer from the start and save us that torment?!
Still hate new Daario.
Gilly and Sam, ok, what I dont get is, theyre trying to cut the fat to fit more in. Why wasnt this the first thing to get the axe? Pointless, boring, crap. 
Stannis and Davos, didnt mind this scene, probably needed to be fleshed out more. I also dont understand the Golden Company backflip. Sure it fits in with ShowStannis' morals but theyre making it out like ShowStannis is only interested in religious means.

The only reason House Tyrell hated the Martells in the books was because of Willas' leg injury. Considering Willas does not exist...

Â 
No Ramsay . . Â Â
2480	Angmar	2014-04-21	The wilding raid, crazy Thenns, Ygritte shooting the farmer...etc
Â 
Hound being an hypocrite, Arya way too cheeky/sassy for her post-RW persona, and the overall scene feeling like huge filler.
Â 
Not enough Jon.
Â 
No Bran.
Â 
Margaery and Oberyn scene. I get it, nobody likes Joffrey, but the king has just been murdered, I think the situation at KL would be a lot more tense than for people to have tea parties at the gardens or random orgies.
Â 
Sam and Gilly. I like them, but I feel having too much scenes devoted to them it'll get dull. Otoh, I think the show's doing that because all of their "main" couples are finished or falling apart (Robb-Talisa, Shae-Tyrion, Jon-Ygritte...), so they want the more "romantic" viewers to have a bit of interest.
Â 
Also have no idea what's up with Gilly and the whores. MoreÂ sexposition? Â
2481	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	Jaime more or less raping Cersei. They could have at least shown Cersei eventually submitting.
Â 
Tywin being so desperate as to claim he needed Dorne because of Dany's dragons.
Â 
Sam and Gilly's boring subplot. Didn't care at all.

2483	Lady Lurksalot	2014-04-21	Just doing a re-watch, and though I've come to accept there will always be gratuitous nudity, this being HBO after all, was a close up shot of the whore's arse in the orgy really the best they could come up with?  If this keeps up, all of us 
viewers are going to be licensed proctologists by the end of the series.
2484	Nutbean	2014-04-21	I haven't watched S1 and my memory may be foggy, but was this first episode where we actually see part of a penis (from the Meeren champ peeing) ?


Â 


We saw Hodor's, Theon's and the wine merchant's in season 1, as well as the male whore Olyvar's in season 3.


Â 
I absolutely love the fact that you had the answer out in full just one minute after it was asked.
2485	zaphodbrx	2014-04-21	Jon's explanation for going to Crasters makes NO SENSE. Mance is coming for them, 100 men or 1000.Â 
Â 
Any time that they make up explanations for their made up shit, the reasoning is STUPID, and I wish they would not do it. It would be preferable for Jon to go off because of <insert plot hole here and don't bother explaining> . They did it all season long with Robb last year ( Karstark is half of the army, bla bla ), and now they'll be doing it with Jon.
Â 
Did I mention how monumentally stupid Sam's logic is?Â
2486	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	I keep feeling that somewhere in the casting offices of HBO, the first meeting between them and Pascal went like this:"See, we want you to be somehow of sexual beast, you'll fuck everything with a pulse""Ok, I'll do everything you want me to do, even dragons and direwolves", HBO casting crew smiles with glee, "but I'll keep my clothes on".

Actually she puts on heirs really well and play arrogant, entitled and overly successful very, very well. She is playing Dany from the books pretty close. Hard to think that in the books, Dany at this time is about 14 years old and miss Clarke is 23?

Either way, she is downright God awful.
2490	RoamingRonin	2014-04-21	Jaime wearing his season one "default character" outfit again and Dany hasn't changed her clothes since season three. I am disgust.

2492	Dragon's Bane	2014-04-22	The wilding raid, crazy Thenns, Ygritte shooting the farmer...etc


The cannibalism part is far far far too much and just stupid. Ygritte shooting the farmer is not. She is, after all, a wildling and their plan always was to draw the Crows out of Castle Black. So not only is it in character for her, it's also necessary (at least to some extent) to make her killable in the eyes of the unsullied.

Jaime wearing his season one "default character" outfit again and Dany hasn't changed her clothes since season three. I am disgust.


Yeah Dany needs some new clothes. That blue overdress thing probably reeks by now.Â I wonder what her tokar is gonna look like...
2495	Ghosteline	2014-04-22	What have they done to Jaimes character . First of all he was supposed to arrive to KL a f t e r Joffs murder. And raping Cersei??!!! Im really curious how the show will develop Jaime from hereon.
2496	Misnthropia	2014-04-22	So it's not that she's a horrible actress, it's that she's playing a horrible actress on the show?
Â 
Either way, she is downright God awful.


Â 
And those damn hand gestures.
I wanted to reach into my screen and slap her.
Â 
I guess she did the pious saviour of the slaves well I guess.

2497	Fat Trell	2014-04-22	I refuse to believe Aiden Gillen is this bad an actor. I love The Wire(obviously), and he was fantastic in that role. Truly brought a character to life. 
His performance here is so inconsistent. It's not just the accent, it's his whole demeanor. I don't know if its the direction or the way his character adsorbed the roles of others but it just doesn't add up.
2498	Queen of Whores	2014-04-22	I absolutely love the fact that you had the answer out in full just one minute after it was asked.
2499	Gneisenau	2014-04-22	Why is I want to be the Queen Marge acting all naive and  more like book Marge over Joff's death ?
2500	voodooqueen126	2014-04-22	-Jaime being a rapist
-The Hound being a thief and a liar. In the book his great redeeming quality was his honesty and lack of hypocrisy, he was sufficiently morally ambiguous with the whole "one of those people who followed orders, no matter how immoral they were, until he ran away", and being in love with a 12 year old girl.
-Littlefinger destroying the poisoned necklace. Probably so that Sansa will lack a way to save herself and need to be rescued by St Tyrion.

Â 
I was never a Jaime fan in the show or in the books; but I had felt that the one act he'd felt to be beneath him was rape. Â Totally unnecessary for him to rape Cersei in the show; their having angry grief-sex in a holy place by the body of their dead son would have been outrageous enough.
Â 
I think the show has mishandled the character of the Hound since Season 2. Â He had no need to bark at Arya about how awful and cruel the world was, either, he knows she's seen that cruelty first-hand. Â And why didn't the show give us Arya's sad retreat into herself after the Red Wedding and the Hound's attempts to shake her out of it?
Â 
The sex scenes with TV Oberyn now make me wonder uncomfortably whether Oberyn was capable of siring children without at least one extra cute young bod in the bed, gender irrelevant? Â Of course, we don't know if he has any children in TV Westeros...

Â IIRC at this point in the books, she is wearing a dress that only covers one breast, and if rumors are correct EC doesn't want to show her naked body any more (which is funny since we have seen it all in season 1).

I think those rumours proved to be false, since she was seen naked in 3x08 when getting out of the bath in front of Daario. It would also be kind of weird to see the "he took her in every way a man could take a woman" scene if she's not even naked.

Compare this to....whatever he's done in this show.
2506	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-22	The completely unnecessary brothel scene tbh. With all the material they need to cover do we really need 5 mins of naked bodies and discussing being bi-sexual. Oberyn is a lot more interesting than his sexuality, *sigh* it is really grating on me now!Â
2507	Roose Seal	2014-04-22	They should just go ahead and replace the castles in the intro credits by the various brothels, cause that's where most of the action takes place really.
2508	boojam	2014-04-22	Why is I want to be the Queen Marge acting all naive and more like book Marge over Joff's death ?I like the show change and would like Marge to be even more Machiavellian than her grandmother!I found the Marge of the books boring.
2509	boojam	2014-04-22	Ok...Three episodes in excluding season 1 , 23 episode, and still the dragons have no names (yeah I know they still have the same book names, but the non readers don't know that, I know some who have asked me.)HBO is making a lot off the show... I hope this prompts them to up the VFX budge.It is noticeable that , when they could be visible, last episode, there are not.
2510	Duckface	2014-04-22	It is getting ridiculous. They significantly cut out charachters out of the show, but they film brothels with lot's of whores. The wrting is getting lazy, it seems like they just go with whatever they come up with without proper thinking about characther arks. Also, budget is big, but HBO is too greedy, because they are making out of this show tonn's of money.

Â 
I've seen Gillen deliver good performances in so many shows, and on the stage in a Chekov play some years ago where he was as subtle and restrained as you'd like, what is going on with him on the set of GOT I just can not fathom. He is appalling.Â

It's strange because he was perfectly acceptable in s1. Not amazing, but got the job done and sometimes even made some pretty cringeworthy dialogue almost work (the infamous sexposition scene, the "gash" banter...).
He's gradually become bad to the point of ruining every single scene he's in.
Â 
I put part of the blame on the directors too: any director worth their salt would tell him to cut it out with the Batvoice and speak normally.

Â 
He's had some pretty appalling dialogue these past twoÂ seasons - lazy, dull stuff, though admittedly not all ofÂ it.Â He seems to thrive on the banter and snark and clever dialogue, which is what LF is all about, really.
2514	Cas Stark	2014-04-22	Aiden Gillen's shitty Littlefinger voice! I'm sick of it to the point where I actually want him recast now. It's so fake and stupid. I've been hoping forever that he'd go back to his regular voice from season one but now I realize that's never going to happen. What a horrible actor this guy has proven to be.


Â 
It's explicable, really, why the directors let him keep on with the batwhisper, when he spoke like a perfectly normal human in Season 1.
Â 
I'm also starting to wonder, where is "Yara" and her quest to save Theon, she kind of fell off the map and it might be nice if they'd show Mance and his 100,000 army to remind viewers instead of just having people talk about him.
2515	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-22	They should just go ahead and replace the castles in the intro credits by the various brothels, cause that's where most of the action takes place really.


Â 
 You make a good point! lol
Â 
I hate when they add whore scenes that give nothing towards the plot or chracter development. Porn for the sake of it just cheapens the show.
2516	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	Why is I want to be the Queen Marge acting all naive and more like book Marge over Joff's death ?


Â 
Yeah that was odd. It kind of reminded us just how much they've aged her up from the books. But then again, she hasn't really experienced death that up-close and personal.
Â 
I like how the scene showed that she was so hell-bent on being queen that she was willing to deal with Joffrey, despite knowing her nature. I liked Olenna's "you did great work on Joffrey. The next one will be easier." Even if her momentary naivety seemed odd, I'm not too worried about Show!Marg's remaining an empowered figure.Â
2517	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-22	"No, Father might see us"
Â 
Those 5 words would have saved the Jamie/Cersei scene so it didn't look like rape.Â
2518	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-22	- Jaime the rapist.
Â 
- What Oberyn is bi ? Glad they pointed that out, I hadn't caught itÂ  the lastÂ 102555 times.
Â 
- It's a bit odd that Margaery is so clueless about the PW.
Â 
- The Gilly/Sam bit was sweet, but took too much screentime. Also, how is this place safer than Castle Black ?
Â 
- Littlefinger's having a sore throat again.
Â 
- the Hound being inconsistent and OOC (though not much compared to a certain Lannister).

Yeah.. D&D logic.

Yeah well that's hardly the worst thing they've done in this episode, is it ? Get your shit together, guys !
Â 
And since you're mentionning the horse, it made me really mad at Daario : you just don't get to insult horses and kill them, and get away with it. There will be payback ! And your hair's not even blue !

2521	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	A minor gritch.
Preview trailer for Season 4 episode 4.
On the wall at Meereen, KILL THE MASTERS is written in English.
We have seen some written Valyrian.
Would not bother me at all if that had of been written in HV with an English subtitle.


Â 
Ah ha and hahaha.Â  Very good catch.Â  What is up with the English, errrrrr Common Tongue, writing on the walls of Mereen?Â
2522	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-22	Astapor: Masters and Slaves both speak Valerian

Either recast him at this point, or make him a mute wearing a sign that says:Â  Yes, I'm one shifty, creepy dude.Â

I'm all for the actor going a bit more subtle again, but I'm past hope of that, honestly.Â

This is a serious problem.

I agree, lol. I think it's a shame for any show-viewers who might want to learn about Planetos, its houses, and its history without reading the novels (lengthy fantasy novels aren't for everyone), but it's unlikey to impact the narrative of the show by that much.

Since this is a nitpick thread, why does he feel the need to clarifyÂ "What Mike is saying is that we need to be very careful about how to proceed"? Â Yeah dude, that was kind of the whole point of the 3 minute conversation we just had...
Â 
Similar to how reading the books has ruined certain show characters, I think watching The Wire has ruined Aidan's performance as LF. Â Those who haven't seen it think he's fine, those who have are like "WTF, we know this guy can act."
2529	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	I agree of course, but that word...ugh...

2530	gvewolf243	2014-04-22	Didn't like how Tywin said that no one will leave the city and Sansa & Dontos left the city so easily. I mean they made Tywin look like an absolute fool.Â

2531	DogLover	2014-04-22	It's easier to say what I liked than what I didn't like, there was only one scene I liked, Shireen and Davos.

My sentiments exactly. I watched this episode for the second time last night (I always watch it twice because the first time I'm too concerned with the deviations to enjoy it. The second time I can usually check my brain at the door and find some semblance of entertainment.) I think this is one of the worst episodes yet. The writing is appallingly lazy and sloppy and the writers are asking too much of the viewers with regard to suspension of disbelief and gaps in logic. I'm not asking for Vince Gilligan/David Milch/David Simon caliber writing, but JESUS, how hard is it to be consistent with character development and story lines? Jaime a rapist when he starts his redemption arc by saving Brienne from rape (I'm none too pleased they had him murder his own cousin)? The Hound is robbed by the BwB in front of Arya, but Arya can't figure out why he doesn't have any money, which is the entire reason she's with him in the first place. Then the Hound states he has a "moral code", which he immediately violates, as well as the sacred law of Guest Right, and becomes just as bad as the Freys? Sansa easily slipping out of KL (where did she get the cloak and how did Dontos/LF know she would wear the necklace to the wedding)? And, god, do I ever hate Show!Stannis. Why isn't he making his way to the Wall? I gave up trying to convince my Unsullied husband that Stannis is actually an interesting character that I root for. And what's up with the Thenns? The writers are just going for cheap comedic relief and shock value. All very cringe.Â

I've never watched The Wire, and honestly, as far as I can recall, I've never really seen Aidan in anything else, either.Â  His LF was fine in S1, but as of now........he's just becoming more and more of a cringeworthy cartoon character.Â
2533	Warden of the Northwest	2014-04-22	Was anyone else supremely disappointed by Daario's fight with the Meereen champion?Â  I mean I knew the scene wasn't going to be anywhere near as entertaining as the book version, but come on.Â  That was probably the most boring fight I've seen on this show.Â  Didn't she say to give them a show?Â  Really short show. Dagger to the horse and behead the guy on the first strike and done.Â  BORING!

He needs to be slapped. Â I can't understand how he even came to go from season 1 speaking normally to being allowed a wholesale change into the bat whisper to begin with, why this inclination wasn't stopped before it ran wild, it's SO distracting now.

I feel the same way about his need for a slap, actually a damn good whack.Â  I can't help but feel as if he's almost intentionally doing a caricature, it seems deliberate.Â  It's deliberate on someone's part, if not his then who?Â  They do use different directors so it's hard to not blame the actor himself.Â

I said a couple times last season that LF seems sometimes like he's acting in a different show...he's in some kind of broad satire or black comedy...where everyone else is playing in a straight drama. Â It's really strange, especially that it seems to continue to become more and more pronounced, I found myself in his scene with Sansa paying more attention to 'how far will he go with this stupid voice' than I did to what he was saying.

Â 
I'm usually very easy going with the show (although some of last season was rough, maybe because it was my first time watching episode by episode?) but you've summed up perfectly the problems with this weeks episode.Â  This episode was a good representation of both the big problems (like the 'rapey' scene) and the little ones that do tend to add up (the Hound's money situation, Sansa and Dontos and all the issues there between necklace wearing and cloaks appearing) until it's hard not to complain about it all and nitpick.Â  I was also a bit optimistic with the first couple of episodes, maybe that's part of my disappointment.Â  I've given up on recognizing Stannis, I'm hoping I do when he gets to the Wall, at least that's what I've been telling myself.Â  The what's with the Thenns is a good question, okay......awful cannibals, we get it.Â  Insert eyeroll for their appearances.Â  Â 
Â 
Maybe I'm just tired of being easy going and continually having to 'get through it?'Â  Or, that's how I do feel this week.Â  With less material with which to work, I guess maybe I was too hopeful that they'd bother to take the time for things to make sense.Â  I guess we'll see how easy going I can continue to be, but it would be nice if the show helped me out, and it didn't require such effort on my part.Â  When all the issues get outlined in one post, for just one episode, it does seem like my remaining easy going about it will keep being put to the test.Â

2541	YourMomsBox	2014-04-22	The Jaime scene was awful and I hate hate hate what they just did to the character. His season 3 development suddenly looks like a great freaking waste whatever way you try to cut it. Took long enough for him to be redeemed from shoving Bran from a window, then it is undone in one scene. Even if it was in the books (don't remember), that could have been scrapped for a different Jaime/Cersei scene.

I was really hopeful with the first episode this year, which I thought was masterful.

Because his aide just made a veiled threat towards both of them. They were the "good people in supervisory roles." Carcetti was trying to smooth that over a bit, imo.
Â 
Back to Gillen's performance; maybe the show runners are trying to emphasize the differences between "Petyr" and "Littlefinger?" His normal voice for theÂ amiable politician and the bat-whisper for the cruel schemer.

And, don't forget, lest we are getting tired of THE brothel, we now have what appears to be a very busy, if not down right overpopulated, Mole's Town brothel.Â  Honestly, how many whores does that dinky actual hole in the ground of a town need?Â

Â 
LOL, see, that's a sign you're got too much T&A...because that is exactly what went through my mind, I was like, oh, another brothel, so we can mix it up a little with the naked whores, only these ones will be downscale and grimmy, awesome...I was completely taken out of the story wondering if we were going to get any naked moletown whores in the next 2 minutes...
Â 
I hate that they're wasting Pedro Pascal on orgies, I'm all for hedonism, but if all they really do is lay up in LF brothel all day and night...that whole egalitarian vibe that Dorne has going for it..sort of disappears.
2546	Electric Wizard	2014-04-22	I just saw episode last night. It seems I'm not the only one who thought the whole arrival at Meereen scene was a bit naff. The dialogue seemed forced and clunky, and the duel with the champion was completely anitclimatic. Once I saw Daario was going to take on the rider, I thought at least they might highlight his cocky aspect by having him toy with him like Belwas does. But no; it was all over in seconds.
Â 
Even the positioning of the characters seemed wrong. Can't believe they had Dany strutting about so close to the frontline and the ramparts in plain view. The whole army seemed hemmed in by the cliffs and looked very vulnerable. And WHEN WILL WE SEE BARRISTAN ACTUALLY FIGHT SOMEONE?! One of the greatest swordsmen in the realm and all he's done is thrown his weapon onto the floor of the throneroom and squash an insect! If they scrapped Belwas then this seemed a good opportunity to finally show Barristan's prowess and bravery, even if it does differ from the books and would mean Dany risking one of her most valuable assets. It just would have been good to see him in action for a change.

Â 
You've hit the nail on the head with the reason I'm soooooooooo nitpicky about this episode.Â  I was taken out of it way too much, I'm not sure I can count how many times in this epi that I was taken out of the show and stopped to think about this type of thing.Â  The whole brothel equation, the Oberyn and Ellaria, again, at a brothel, Olyvar as the male Ros, The Damn Over The Top Thenns, The Hound and yeah, he has feelings about the weak and them getting out of his way, but he should have been bitching to Sansa about that, not Arya, timing and actions off, why was it foggy for Sansa in the harbor when it was sunny a few minutes before at the wedding, Tywin scene stealing and I love Tywin but so does D&D, a little too much, and the big.....hold the phone, stop the presses, and WTF is going on with Jaime and Cersei.Â 
Â 
That's just off the top of my head, LOL, and that is way too many times to be taken out of the story.Â  Oh look, I didnt' even mention that for the first time I DO see why people say, at times, EC's Dany looks high, cause well, she did in her first appearance this time, LOL, and sorry for the run on sentences, but that was also my point.Â  It was being taken out of the story for too many considerations this episode, just way too many.Â
2548	Rhaegar The Rocker	2014-04-22	I read a comment on an article that someone thoughT Oberyn was far more interesting in the show and that I do not understand. Â The only interesting thing they added was THE conversation with Tywin/Cersei. Â Besides that its been basically "Oberyn is a freak and here is some full frontal male nudity." Â 
Â 
Not having him tell Tyrion the story about Cersei is a massive oversight IMO. Â Though maybe they're saving it for later. Â

Â 
Ok there are a lot of people who dont like Dany, me Ive always like her; but the whole stand in front of a wall with your army and yell out about freeing the slaves blah blah blah. Â Yeah we get it. Â Again is this the result of HBO writers who just graduated in Liberal Arts making script? Â What a waste of a scene. Â Lets cut out the great fight scene (well most of it) and have Dany give another boring speech. Â We also get to see some terrible special effects with the catapults. Â 
Â 
The Hound is a thief now after breaking bread with a man under his roof? Â Huh? Â Another character on his way to at least small redemption who has been ruined. Â Good job HBO.
Â 
The Cersai/ Jamie rape scene is inexcusable. Â The directors explanation that it was directed to be a consent scene and if you watch it closely it obviously is, well, is total rubbish. Â He knows damn well they wanted to paint Jamie as a rapist. Â After all arent all men according to HBO? Â  WTF? Â  At least be a man about it and admit it.

Â 
In defense of this one thing, I hope there's more to the Hound thing than we can appreciate at the moment. Â The fact that he violated guest right seems very specific.

Â You could almost imagine her wanted to stay with him over going to live with her crazy aunt.

Doesn't that sort of highlight the difference between good writing and bad?
Â 
You've correctly diagnosed the problem. Â Good writing would be having The Hound do something in character which upsets Arya enough to respond the way she eventually does.
Â 
Bad writing would be 90% of what the show does when it deviates from the source material.

Yes. Bad writing is having the character be whatever you need him to be for the purpose of the story. This often leads to characters acting out of, well, character out of nowhere just to further the plot.
Good writing is working within the restrictions set by the character to bring the story where you want it to be.

I liked Dany's scene and guys, come on, its aÂ big dealÂ for me to like a Dany scene. That almost Monty Python esque banter with her teammates is just yes. So. Much. Yes. I like the idea of a snarky Dany. I liked Alliser Thorne being all "but...oh goddammit little fucker has a point." I liked Shireen being Stannis Jr and Davos' bright idea.

I think I'll be fine by next week, I do roll with the punches pretty good........this is the first time I've been around here for one of the bigger punches.Â  Hopefully, next week I'll be the same easy going lady I usually am.Â  Hell, I laughed my way through Talisa and Robb and love at first sight over an amputation, and dreamed of them meeting up with Ramsey.Â  If I could handle that in good humor, hopefully, I can handle the rest.Â  Fingers crossed, besides, next week may bring us more Adventures of Edd and Grenn.Â

Â 
I'm not even sure what the purpose was for The Hound, it's not like he made off with any of the chickens.Â  Sorry, trying to let myself lighten up a bit.
Â 
I do think it's about keeping tension between him and Arya, but still......it does do a disservice to the character of Sandor.Â  Perhaps that will be one of the things he apologizes for in the long run?Â  I hope so.Â  Complaining about the weak is one thing, stealing outright is another, especially from a father with a young girl.Â  I think young girls really push his buttons thanks to his sister, then again......maybe we'll learn it's about him being mad his father didn't protect him from Gregor?Â  Then again, I'm probably hoping for too much with that one, right?Â

If The Sainted One of which you speak is Tyrion, I wouldn't be surprised if he's a little bored with the idea.Â  Good Lawd, there was and is tons of material that he could do wonders with if given the chance.

He still stole from his hosts, which is a violation of the guest rights, but atleast he didn't kill them.
Â 
And the old man was an idiot. As soon as the Hound said 'I don't care about guest rights', he should have shut up then and there, not told him about the fact that he has silver.
Â 
Finally, does anyone think this dude is the same one who ratted out Jamie/Brienne to Locke? He looks very similar and that would explain the silver.

The Sandor thing doesnt really bug me that much cuz him and Arya are getting a little too chummy for my liking. She hated him the entire time in the book so having them all buddy-cop for a while is a tad much. So giving Arya a reason to go "oh yeah this guy is a bastage." is fine with me. Its not like Sandor isnt gonna wind up making amends anyway. Like, the show is as subtle as a freight train when it comes to things that are only implied in the books. Rory McCann is totally going to be dressed as a graverobber eventually. Ill eat a shoe if the show doesnt spell that one out for us.Â

Â 
Absolutely.
Â 
Â 
I agree with the person who said that it was a big mistake to leave out the story told about Oberyn and Elia's visit to CR. I thought that story really made me realize that Cersei's always been quite crazy.
Â 
I'm so tired of the constant sexualization of this show. I didn't even watch it until today... I just don't really care for the show at all any more. I feel like the writing of Oberyn in the show is almost comical, and I don't think it's funny at all. I'm not sure why his sexuality or sexual habits should have more screen time than perhaps him talking about his want of vengeance or his plans with Elia or Tyrion.
Â 
I'm disappointed that more time is spent making up pointless plots with Gilly than explaining more about the 3EC, or foreshadowing about Jon's arc to come, or perhaps introducing Tommen a bit better, or a million other things they could be doing besides making shit up or showing naked people.

There is still time. Oberyn's combat is in ep. 8 and we're just in ep. 3. Also, there is a scene with the two of them talking coming, probably next episode. He could mention the time they first met.

2585	Roose Seal	2014-04-23	Next time we meet I will not fail. I will walk up to the Mountain-sized man and say "Hello my name is Oberyn Martell, you killed my sister, prepare to die" . But not before I've laid with every single whore in this city - and their brother. A man has his priorities.
2586	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-23	loooool poor Oberyn will never finish...Those squirrelly Lannisters!omg.. I just...when Tywin gets Shae, he gets a sudden urge to leave before any kind of sex. His stomach calls for it...THAT'S OBERYN'S REVENGE! THERE! I DECIPHERED THE CODE.
2587	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-23	omg.. I just...
when Tywin gets Shae, he gets a sudden urge to leave before any kind of sex. His stomach calls for it...
THAT'S OBERYN'S REVENGE! THERE! I DECIPHERED THE CODE.


Â 
You might be on to something here....
Â 
Tywin is just about to get jiggy with it.... but can't remember what to do next and has a WWOD moment. 'Well normally this is where I walk in so maybe if I walk out that will work?'
2588	Domonju	2014-04-23	I'd like to nitpick about everything that happened in the episode. In fact, there are only 2 scenes I enjoyed.
Â 
1. Tyrion and Pod
2. Tywin and Oberyn
Â 
Oberyn is quickly becoming the awesomest person in the show. Too bad he won't be around long.
2589	toffeejay	2014-04-23	Just more confirmation that they have no idea with what to do with Stannis. I'm sure every single scene he's been in till date has consited of him threatening Davos. The whole thing of 'he took my fingers but it was just' I get, but in the show there's this constant threat towards him and he just puts up with it despite there being no justification for any of it.
Â 
Â 
Sandor thief hypocracy
2590	Queen of Whores	2014-04-23	Someone on the forum claimed that Peter Dinklage had said in an interview that Tyrion's character development was comparable to Walter White's...
Â 
Â 
Â 
.... Are we gonna start seeing that soon??? Cause so far all I've seen is Tyrion be completely selfless and perfect, showing no signs of bitterness or anger, key traits of book!Tyrion's personality.Â

I think they're waiting for the trial or you know the thing in order to have a big shocker /380Â° turn they seem so fond of, instead of the actual subtlety of Book Tyrion.Â

Â 
Hopefully you're right. It worked well in Arya's case in 3x10, so I hope it has the same effect on the show. It's a shame they didn't opt for subtly, but I just hope we get this side to him in any degree now, honestly.Â

Yeah I feel you. I've been pretty disillusioned with the show lately (why might that be), so at this point I'll take anything I can get.
2594	Arry Lannister	2014-04-23	.however, Jon? Nope, not even a sense of him feeling heart-broken, angry or even numb about the whole thing. I will be sincerely disappointed if we don't get more acknowledgement/grief from Jon regarding the Stark's situation,Â 
Â 

Jon doesn't have time to mourn for a family in which he is the bastard part of it. I do believe that it was only Ned and Arya that he is particularly close with unless I'm forgetting some line stating that he loved every member of the family and even Catelyn.

It would be kind of nice to know if they've even told him. Â We're 3 episodes in and have no idea if Jon is aware that Winterfell has been burnt or that Bran and Rickon are still alive.
Â 
Though we've had plenty of pointless brothel scenes, so I guess it all evens out in the end.
2596	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-23	Jon doesn't have time to mourn for a family in which he is the bastard part of it. I do believe that it was only Ned and Arya that he is particularly close with unless I'm forgetting some line stating that he loved every member of the family and even Catelyn.


Â 
Ummmm, he considered Robb his brother, and almost left the NW to try and join him at War.Â  The Cat situation doesn't need explaination, but it's obvious it was every sibling that not only meant alot to Jon, but he was close with all of them with the exception of Sansa.Â
2597	JesterX	2014-04-23	I'm getting a little tired of the Sandor/Arya pairing.Â  Sam and Gilly are boring.Â  Hated the Jaime on Cersei rape scene.Â  Why the hell is Stannis still at Dragonstone brooding when he should, at least, be on his way to the wall by now?
Â 
That Thenn guy seems to have taken over Tormund's crew.Â  We had a slaughter scene and the only speaking role was the Thenn.Â  Although I have to admit, cinematically, that guy does have a lot more charisma than the guy who plays Tormund.
2598	RedShirt47	2014-04-23	Jaime turned into a rapist.
Sandor turned into a thief two episodes after he declared he is not a thief. In the books he is the least hypocritical character, and always calling others out on their BS.
Â 
Neither one of them is a 'good person' but Jaime's loyalty for his sister and Sandor's honesty were important redeeming qualities for them. Apparently the show has to make it all black and white.


This.
Both characters were on redemptive arcs which these scenes did not fit with. In terms of the tv series these scenes don't work so well and the tv audience were not treated well by them.
2599	Annara Snow	2014-04-23	Â

He wasn't close to her the way he was to Arya, but there are memories that Sansa tried to teach him to dance and talk to ladies, and Sansa probably remembers that Jon didn't like to dance because she decides Alayne wouldn't like to dance. They weren't hanging out, obviously, since Sansa's circle consisted of girls. 
It should be obvious from AGOT that he cared a lot for Bran and Robb. Rickon was three year old, so I it's not like they could have been particularly close. But Jon was devastated to hear about the RW and Bran and Ricon's "deaths".

Â 
I wasn't trying to say there were bad feelings with Jon and Sansa, just that it did seem that if there was a sibling that it's hard to definately say there was some closeness with, it would be Sansa.Â  We even hear how Rickon wants Jon at the royal feast in Winterfell, as if he doesn't understand why the King being there would make a difference to where Jon sits, iirc.Â  Jon had to shove him off on his way.Â  It just seems as if there was a bit of a formal distance between Sansa and Jon, IMOÂ  Not that there was bad blood, or anything like that.Â 
Â 
If there is anyone that Jon didn't have positive feelings about it wouldÂ be Cat.Â  My answer was more about how all the Stark children did mean alot to him......regardless of a seeming bit of distance with him and Sansa.Â
2601	Good Master	2014-04-23	Dany saying "Fire." in Valyrian made me lol while watching it alone. Terrible. I mean, bookDany can be a 'dragon' and all but show Dany is soooo cocky. Really bugs me.

Yeah, at least in the books I don't have to physically see Dany's smug expressions, but in the show there's no choice.

Â 
She's not a very good actress, I don't understand how she possibly got nominated for an Emmy. Â She is servicable in the show because all they have her do is "look regal" so she is able to carry it off, I'd hate to see her in any type of show that required real acting.
2605	John Suburbs	2014-04-24	Emilia was awesome in Season 1, but she started to wane inÂ Season 2, especially when's she's trying to convince the Trader of Spices to give her his ships. All I saw were big, dark eyebrows wiggling all over her head like worms. Maybe it was just bad direction, but she still looked pretty silly.
Â 
Then you had little Maise Williams going toe-to-toe with John Dance and she would project bone-chilling menace without moving a muscle. "Anyone can be killed, my lord. Anyone."
Â 
An Emmy for Maise, for sure.

2607	Whipsy	2014-04-24	Dany's reckless flinging of those barrels at the end. Even if they're not that heavy, at that speed and height someone would instantly be killed if they didn't move out of the way fast enough. Are we to believe they were all able to dodge every one? Or is this just like a Dothraki wedding and you have to pick off a few people (or dozens) to make a point? Gee, thanks lady, nice symbolism with the collars and all but did you have to kill my grandma? What a dick.
Â 
The Thenns...the fuck? Really? "I'm gonna eat your dead mama and your dead papa". Yeah, anybody else picture Fat Bastard running around yelling "I'm gonna eat ya!"...Derp.

Jamie scene is obvious, if only for the fact that it warps the Unsullied's point of views. Not a one of them seem to see dubious consent there, but I wont beat a dead horse. Much.Â

Emilia is looking like such a try hard
I don't know, reading about Dany never really gave me the vibe that she has such a strong presence and overwhelming confidence. It seemed to me she is very insecure.
What shields her is all those people around her. Merceneries and knights, plus her Unsullied army. She's idealistic and stubborn in her decisions, but that's it.
I never really imagined her going to the front lines and giving an overconfident speech.

You don't get to have mercenaries and knights shielded you unless you have a certain amount of confidence.Â Â Most leaders have some insecurity.Â  Heck, most PEOPLE have some insecurity.

Dany has leader qualities, just not like the show make her out to be. My opinion.
Â

Â 
Well, she had some built-in loyalties just by being a Targaryen.Â  Then by being Khaleesi.Â Â But hatching dragons, taking Astapor and gaining the unsullied, then Yunkai and Mereen, you gotta say that was all her.Â  Or at least, mostly her.

This episode really worries me before the start of the season I was talking to unsullied friends about how this season is going to be boss and basically cant be fucked up. I think if more episodes are like this its going to be a major disappointment.
2613	Whipsy	2014-04-24	Another thing was Sam's wide eyed stare at Gilly two inches from her face when he was talking to her at CB. Looked more like he thought she might explode at any given moment rather than that he was in love with her. I mean, BLINK, damn you.Â

Â 
It does seem rather silly at times. I can't tell if he's trying to do an overly posh American Standard or if he's trying to fit in with his fellow co-stars. It's odd to see a scene so well-acted and have it be thrown off by the actor's voice. Â

Â 
I agree that was a poor episode but I've never had a problem with Tyrion's accent.Â  But consider Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) is American, Lena Headey (Cersei) is British and Nicola-Coster Waldau (Jaime) is Danish, there's BOUND to be variances in the Lannister kids accents.
2616	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-24	Another thing was Sam's wide eyed stare at Gilly two inches from her face when he was talking to her at CB. Looked more like he thought she might explode at any given moment rather than that he was in love with her. I mean, BLINK, damn you.Â 
Â

Â 
With me, it's not so much the accent.Â  Though I love Peter Dinklage, what is bothering me somewhat and I did notice it this past episode is how slow his speech seems to come sometimes, almost as if the effort of doing the accent is slowing him down?Â  That, or boredom, LOL.Â  I do notice the somewhat slow line delivery most when he's in a Shae scene (though, I did notice it with Pod this past week).Â  I put some of the slightly irritating slowness of delivery down to him (Peter) being bored with the same ole, same ole dialogue with Shae, me being bored with it, and my noticing it more often because I'd like for him (Peter) to pick up the pace with his lines, sometimes.Â  Spit it out, LOLÂ and hurry up about it.Â  I do wonder, though, if a combo of his boredom along with his deliberate attention to the accent is what is making it more noticeable, for me, anyway.Â 
Â 
I also suspect that I am noticing the slowness of delivery because, even though I am for the most part pretty easy going about the show and changes, I am starting to feel that the whitewashing of Tyrion may be getting to me and that makes me notice the slow coming dialogue along with the concentration on the accent.Â

2617	MotherMouse	2014-04-24	My mother-of-3 nitpick is that Gilly is never nursing that poor baby in the show!  In the book she has a baby at the breast 90% of the time (aka realistic mothering) and in the show she's all, "Let me ineffectively bounce you around when you cry without really paying attention" instead of giving a visual depiction of her attachment to the baby.  A small thing, but I felt a much stronger bond between the two in the books that made the situation when she leaves for Oldtown so heartwrenching and tragic.  I wonder if the show will have that same feel since her scenes are all about Sam and the awkward boring "romance" vs her and the baby.
And of course my irritation with sex-obsessed HBO's Oberyn choices... ONE mention in the books and it's all we see.  Thank goodness Pascal is at least a decent actor.
Emilia Clarke has been going downhill since Season 1.  I don't really understand why.  I liked her in S1!  Are there theories on why her acting has devolved so much??
2618	ache	2014-04-24	Am I the only one who cant stand TyrionsÂ accent?? please tell me I'm not it's so ridiculous he takes me out of the scenes more then Aiden Gillen does.
Â 


Â 
You are not. Peter Dinklage is usually so damn watchable but his attempts at a british accent are so awful it even messes with his line delivery at times. It isn't so much that his accent is different to his co-stars, it's that it sounds really forced and is inconsistant. Nicolaj has a different accent to Lena and Charles but it isn't jarring to me because it isn't all over the place like Peter's. It's a shame, because without the dodgy accent he'd be perfect.
Â 
Aiden, on the other hand, is pretty terrible all round as Littlefinger. His accent is atrocious and he overacts so much, especially in his scenes with Sansa. I don't know if it's him or if they're directing him to be so over the top but it's very distracting.

Â 
My thoughts are it isn't necessarily that her acting has devolved.
Â 
I found Dany's story incredibly engaging in the first book. I felt S01 Dany was a pretty faithful representation but they have struggled to convey much depth to her since. It has all been about showing her as 'badass'. To me this flattens the character. The production is getting positive reinforcement by legions of Khaleesi fans so they keep doing it.
2622	Lady Lurksalot	2014-04-24	Regarding Oberyn in a brothel in every scene he's in, have we had any mention on the show of The Sand Snakes? That's more integral and interesting than "he fucks women...AND men!"  that they seem to beating us over the head with. Is there any official word whether his daughters (or how many of them) are going to be included? I'm getting really sick of seeing him and Ellaria being portrayed in LF's whorehouse time after time.

That's a good point.  My other thought (which is basically an elaboration on yours) was that because we miss out on all the internal dialogue in the show (MOST of Dany's chapters are her talking in her head, aren't they?) we are maybe seeing what book!Dany WOULD look like to the people she's interacting with, but we're ONLY seeing that one side, thus the incredible one-dimensionality of it all.  
Either way it's in large part a writing failure, as that should have been an obvious issue that really should have gotten some attention in reworking her scenes.  We can have 15 extra Oberyn brothel scenes that aren't canon, but they couldn't be bothered to add in some kind character/plot device for expressing Dany's thought processes and inner vulnerability... Sigh.

That's not my fear.
Â 
My fear is that Jon Connington's first appearance will happen in a brothel, surrounded by blonde male whores...


Â 
BINGO!!Â  Instead of Jorah in a brothel with a silver haired whore, it'll be Connington with a silver haired male whore.Â  I feel 99% certain of that, the other 1% exists only because I wonder if they'll leave Jon Con out.Â  I suspect that they might look for an even easier, quicker way to intro Young Griff.Â  The Grayscale might make him necessary, maybe?Â  Although, they already have Shireen for that, don't they?
Â 
Hmmmmmm, I'm wondering, though, JonCon, Duck, and a silver haired male prostitute, that's more up their alley, right?Â
2635	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-24	The last episode was just god awful all around. I couldn't think of any of them as not only the book characters, but the show characters. Everyone was off, except Shireen. I heart Shireen.

Has anyone else noticed that the show has NEVER explained Shireen's greyscale?Â  And just like they did with the Hound's burns this season, they've minimized her scaly face.Â  You can still see it but it doesn't jump out at you like before.

I still do notice her face, but yes, they seem to keep her in rooms that are pretty dark.Â  I've noticed they never have mentioned exactly her condition, have they?Â  I'm noticing lots of people noticing the things they don't explain in the show in general this week.Â  Dragon names, being one I've read lots about this week, too.Â  I really wonder how much they realize that they are lacking severely in the explainations, and simple naming, departments.Â

Â 
They can't cut Jon Con. First, he's relatively important for Tyrion's plot and Aegon. Also, with Loras in the KG and Oberyn gone, they need someone to fill their LGTB quote. Unless Olyvar is Satin and send him to the Wall.

Â 
Selyse kinda says it's a condition and a sickness because she's like Stannis sinful, stubborn and sullen, but they don't say much else. I guess people already realise it's a disease but they don't know anything else.

Â 
The Rolling Stone GRRM article that the site has linked has me really thinking GRRM will not be speeding up books for the show.Â  At least not the last book, I'm not sure if that bodes for good or ill in relation to story and character on the show.Â  I get the feeling that we'll know for sure by the time the show hits this time frame.Â  I have my fingers crossed, hoping it helps.Â
2644	Old Man River	2014-04-24	Â 
Using the HBO Go subtitles to confirm the spelling, this is what Tywin says to Tommen:
Â 
"Orys the First was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?"
Â 
Â 
....this creates all kinds of problems.
Â 
At first I thought he was slurring "Aerys the First" or possibly "Aenys the First"...though they're both a stretch.
Â 
The problem is that there is no king who ruled for less than a year but was then murdered by his own brother (the only king to rule one year was Viserys II, but he was an old man, and his brothers were dead by that point - his last brother being the previous king).
Â 
Aerys I was not murdered by his own brother, or at least I'm fairly sure Maekar I never did that. And he ruled for many years. On top of that Aerys I was an infamously weak, do-nothing king, not a great reformer.
Â 
Aenys I...may have attempted reforms but been killed by Maegor the Cruel, his own brother. We don't know how Aenys I died in the books.
Â 
A RUNNING GUESS which I have is...maybe they thought that "Aenys" sounds too much like "anus" on TV, and in the TV continuity he's been renamed Orys? It's actually not much of a stretch to say that Aegon I would name his firstborn son after Aegon's Hand of the King and only close friend. Though it is weird to say that Aenys/Orys ruled only one year when he ruled for a few more than that (though not the biggest change in the world).
Â 
The other possibility is that "Orys the First" was an important ancient Storm King or something, but not a king who sat on the Iron Throne.
Â 
This is a serious problem.
Someone with access to Cogman via twitter (i.e. Westeros.org) really needs to ask about that one.
Â 


Â 
Interesting.Â  I can only say that the show is making it's own changes to the history as suits it.

Â 
They already made Aegon V being father of Aerys II, rather than Jaeherys.
2646	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-24	That's a good point. My other thought (which is basically an elaboration on yours) was that because we miss out on all the internal dialogue in the show (MOST of Dany's chapters are her talking in her head, aren't they?) we are maybe seeing what book!Dany WOULD look like to the people she's interacting with, but we're ONLY seeing that one side, thus the incredible one-dimensionality of it all.
Either way it's in large part a writing failure, as that should have been an obvious issue that really should have gotten some attention in reworking her scenes. We can have 15 extra Oberyn brothel scenes that aren't canon, but they couldn't be bothered to add in some kind character/plot device for expressing Dany's thought processes and inner vulnerability... Sigh.


Â 
Yep, an example is the Astapor scene where she says "All men must die but not for a long while, we may pray" then takes Missandei's hand. This was replaced with 'We are not men'. Any tender moments or the times she looks away from the Unsullied because of the tears in her eyes were replaced with 'badass' persona. Even when she rages in tears at Jorah for bringing her to this place was replaced with steely 'badass' resolve.
2647	Petyr Patter	2014-04-24	Emilia Clarke has been going downhill since Season 1. I don't really understand why. I liked her in S1! Are there theories on why her acting has devolved so much??


Â 
In season 1 Clarke was asked to play a scared girl who none the less is caring and eager to learn.Â  We see her learning and growing and navigating her role with her brother, her husband, Ser Jorah, her haindmaidens, and the rest of the Khalasar.Â  Her having to come to grips with the fact the only family she has ever known is actually cruel and pathetic.Â 
Â 
Now, her character has one personality trait: stoic.Â  She doesn't have dialogue, she has proclamations.Â  She doesn't have doubts, she has annoyances.Â  In essence, Clarke is now portraying a completely different character.Â  I don't know if this is how she chooses to interpret the transition, or if her directors are telling her to always act the 'god'.Â 
Â 
Which is a shame.Â  Because Danaerys should be showing doubt at her cause, concern over how she's going to feed her freedmen, and realization that her current actions are a detriment to ever going to Westeros.Â  In the books, Meereen isn't taunting her because they are silly and evil, but because they have a dominant military position.Â  Danaerys doesn't have a way to beat the high walls of Meereen without high cost or great risk.Â  Which makes her decision to take the city much more tense and dramatic.Â

Â 
I very much enjoy readingÂ  Daenerys' chapters (yes, even from ADwD), but the show has simply made me stop caring from season 2 onwards. There is zero complexity to her character or even her plot/storyline as a whole. This may yet change, with things going downhill in Meereen later on, but I have my doubts.

Â 
The show seems pretty committed to Targaryen Jesus, so I have a feeling that her string of bad decisions in Meereen is going to be seriously truncated. Â I also think she now functions as the sort of 'feel good' segment, where we've got the badass warrior girl whose smiting her enemies right and left as relief from the Westeros stuff.
Â 
I don't think Emilia is capable of "complex", even season 1, she was fairly stoic and one note, only her one note was a little different, but still really a lesser form of the Queen Mode she's been in.

I notice she never really mentions Westeros anymore. If I was an Unsullied I would be asking what does this girl have to do with the crap going on in Westeros. I have a feeling most of them even forgot she is a Targaryen?
I don't know, this show became a pale shadow of what the first season was. Funny because you expect to be better and bigger since it became more famous, but now when you look at it, it kinda seems low budget, if you take out all those bad effects and CGI dragons.

Emilia Clarke has been going downhill since Season 1. I don't really understand why. I liked her in S1! Are there theories on why her acting has devolved so much??


Â 
It's a really good question. Â I know they auditioned a lot of early 20-something females who were capable of doing the weak girl but not the powerful woman. Â On one hand that would seem to be Emilia's problem, but on the other hand I thought she was actually pretty good playing 'strong' in Season 1 ("The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands", "It is not your screams I want, only your life", etc...).
Â 
I think you and Ser Desmond are on the right track, I'm just not sure how much of the problem is the writing versus her acting. Â Which is to say, Dany has definitely become one-dimensional, and I think that her lack of complexity is the underlying problem, I just feel it comes down to Emilia completely losing any sort of humanness in the character.
Â 
The speech she gave in front of the funeral pyre in 1.10 conveyed both genuine strength and the scared girl who was faking it until she made it, resulting in a very compelling performance IMO. Â Ever since, I don't see a strong woman, or a girl who is trying to appear strong and overplaying her hand, I just see a demurely arrogant little b***h who is incredibly off-putting in everything she does.

Â 
I agree. Â My theory is that while the multiple sets and locations is "cool"...all of the logistics have caused the actual show itself, e.g. writing, continuity, etc. to suffer, they're spending so much time on the props, locations, shoots that the script isn't what it should be. Â So, its hit or miss.
Â 
The had tons of time to perfect the first season before they shot the first scene. Â Now, I suspect the time frame is not only shorter but they've got all those different sets and shooting locations.

Dany is my favorite character in the books, but watching her scenes in the show makes me annoyed and I start to get mad at the character.
I really think the real problem with this show is the directing and writing.

That's so cool.Â  Â  I'm trying to make myself laugh, because I'm lost at sea with all of these changes, and what they might mean.Â  I just can't imagine these characters without certain things that seemed to matter so much to them in the books, not mattering much at all, if anything anymore.Â  Or not for long, maybe for a season, then forgotten, like it never happened.

I know I'm a sick pup, but Joff's dead body was the least of my worries on that.Â  Then again, it being fiction, I didn't feel bad feeling that way.Â  Jaime had reflected beforehand on how Joffrey probably deserved his fate, regardless of Jaime's own tie to him.Â 
Â 
With Loras, I wouldn't be troubled at him moving on eventually, but the show has turned him into such a joke, I'm surprised he's not working part-time at THE brothel himself, just incase there's a piece of ass he's missed out on.Â

THAT'S OBERYN'S REVENGE! THERE! I DECIPHERED THE CODE.


HARRR!!! 
Â 


Everyone except the guy playing Oberyn was god awful. Even Charles Dance!
Emilia in particular made me cringe.
Â 
This is the episode with the worst directing in the show.


OHHHH DEM'S FIGHTIN' WORDS, MA'AM!Â  
Say what you will of the lot, but do notÂ dare say Charles Dance is bad. Because its impossible for him to be bad in anything.
Â 


Â 
I'm so afraid for Jon Connington's next (or the next) season.


I wouldnt be. I think they will play up the gay but it be less brothel and more "Oh Rhaegar...i failed you..." all the time. That wouldnt be so bad really as long as theres no creeping on Young Griff. (ew)
Â 


The last episode was just god awful all around. I couldn't think of any of them as not only the book characters, but the show characters. Everyone was off, except Shireen. I heart Shireen.


You better heart Shireen! Cuz i like you and people i like must heart Shireen.
Â 


Â 
I heart the hell out of Shireen.Â 


Damn straight!
Â 


Nikolaj's accent is nearly perfect. On the other hand, Aidan's...


Seeing how Danish Nikolaj is, its pretty impressive how he can accent. Dinklage's accent irks me a bit but i understand that not every American out there can bust out with a nigh perfect Estuary accent. 
Â 


Â 
They already made Aegon V being father of Aerys II, rather than Jaeherys.


Yeah thats weirdsauce. I kinda come to terms with that since they still have Jaehaerys I in the show continuity. (Sam mentions him) In fact, this might be why they made Aerys Egg's son. To avoid confusion of Jaehaeryses. (Cuz most of the Aegons have titles or nicknames like Aegon the Unlikely etc)Â 
Â 


Â 
In season 1 Clarke was asked to play a scared girl who none the less is caring and eager to learn.Â  We see her learning and growing and navigating her role with her brother, her husband, Ser Jorah, her haindmaidens, and the rest of the Khalasar.Â  Her having to come to grips with the fact the only family she has ever known is actually cruel and pathetic.Â 
Â 
Now, her character has one personality trait: stoic.Â  She doesn't have dialogue, she has proclamations.Â  She doesn't have doubts, she has annoyances.Â  In essence, Clarke is now portraying a completely different character.Â  I don't know if this is how she chooses to interpret the transition, or if her directors are telling her to always act the 'god'.Â 
Â 
Which is a shame.Â  Because Danaerys should be showing doubt at her cause, concern over how she's going to feed her freedmen, and realization that her current actions are a detriment to ever going to Westeros.Â  In the books, Meereen isn't taunting her because they are silly and evil, but because they have a dominant military position.Â  Danaerys doesn't have a way to beat the high walls of Meereen without high cost or great risk.Â  Which makes her decision to take the city much more tense and dramatic.Â 


Clarke's whole situation as an actress and this character just irks theÂ shitÂ out of me. Like, Dany is sending me mixed signals and Clarke looks out right confused half the time which causes her to be wooden and bad when not yelling stuff. And she really doesnt have the chops for the kind of nuance Daenerys as a character, demands. I do think she is not the sole one to blame here and the direction is also not what it should be. Like i guess they just go "oh you looked good here, we'll print." Instead of "Lets try this again with more...feeling." Not enough chops + funky writing + ass kissing direction = shallow Dany. 

Â 
(LOL, also why were they so away from the main table? He's a prince of Dorne)

I agree. She's pretty much become a caricature of herself. It works in the valyrian scenes, but every line in every scene is delivered in the same overly dramatic, pompous way now. It's annoying.
Â

"I will do what Queens do... I will rule."
Â 
"They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one!"
Â 
Dany just shut up.

Ive seen him in a movie where he plays an American. The accent is pretty convincing most of the time, but sometimes he sounds like a Brit hiding an American accent. When really, hes a Dane speaking English in the best American accent he can muster. I like him~

I like him, too.Â  I did see the movie called Mama, I believe it was, with NCW on HBO.Â  Creepy, and pretty good, not near enough of him in it though.Â  There are ads all around tv lately for a new movie of his called The Other Woman, I believe.Â  It's supposed to be about a guy with three wives or girlfriends according to the ads, and they are on to him.Â  Wonder what the accent will be?Â

2672	The Unholy Reaver	2014-04-24	There are so many things wrong with show in this season. I fucking hate this show now and I won't be watching anymore.
2673	Queen of Whores	2014-04-24	Â 
Well, she had some built-in loyalties just by being a Targaryen.Â  Then by being Khaleesi.Â Â But hatching dragons, taking Astapor and gaining the unsullied, then Yunkai and Mereen, you gotta say that was all her.Â  Or at least, mostly her.


Â 
Tbf, each of those cities was taken through trickery. Also, her Targ loyalties haven't gotten her much, only Jorah and Barristan (although having Barristan is like a one million times advantage). She kind of lucked out that Daario wanted to fuck her in Storm and brought the sellswords over to her side, and she was also lucky that the Astapori slavers were so dumb.
2674	Le Cygne	2014-04-24	Daario wanted to fuck her because she's fabulous, so that's her, too. Trickery counts, too. Just ask Littlefinger.

Â 
Look, the last thing I want to do is start a Dany/Daario debate with you (again), trust me

My point was that most of her successes were through circumstantial luck and the benefit of being a main character, attributes other characters don't have, like Eddard, Robb and Stannis.

2677	Ran	2014-04-25	Most Europeans who learn English well end up with British accents, as that was the pronunciation taught in schools. At least, that's the case in the past.

That is assuming schools teachÂ  English properly , which isn't the case, as far as France is concerned anyway. I think my (atrocious)Â accent is much closer toÂ Â American than British pronounciation/accent.

2683	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-25	^Do you say "weekend" in France or is that only Quebecois who are letting English phrases like that bleed in?


Yes, we say week end.Â  Actually, I was always under the impression that the Quebecois were much more conservative when it comes to language, and try to replace anglicism with French 'made-up' expression, whereas in France we tend to use a lot of English idioms/words (especially when it comes to new-technologies, marketing techniques,... that we twist, misuse 90% of the time).
2684	Konradsmith	2014-04-25	^I think a lot of people use the English phrases in Quebec but there are more people that disapprove of it there, I guess. I'm from Toronto though, so I can't exactly pretend expertise. That would piss them off.

2687	Queen of Whores	2014-04-25	So I was rewatching the scene when Dany arrives at Meereen, and I noticed that Meereen is in the middle of a desert-mountain pass, with no water, much less a sea, anywhere to be seen. While this doesn't matter right now, it might have big complications when Victarion's fleet arrive in the show. How exactly are they going to work around that? Are they just going to magically change the scenery for the city? This is a really small nickpick, I know, but it makes me wonder why they didn't just bother putting a CGI coastline next to the city.
Â 
ETA: Nevermind, I just paused at that scene and saw that at the very left it looks like the mountains stop and it's possible a sea is there.

2689	digiFemme	2014-04-25	Jaime and Cersei's scene in the sept for obvious reasons
Â 
Margaery's scene with Olenna confused me because they were presenting her as innocent of Joff's murder but earlier in an interview, the costumer designer said that the reason they added thorns to her gown was to show that while she was sweet she was also deadly. I took this to mean that while Marge wasn't necessarily the poisoner, she would've known about the plot and was as cunning as her grandmother. So the scene gave me a lot of mixed signals.
Â 
Dany when she was standing out in the open, unprotected. They were going for something like her earlier scene where she sacked Astapor but in here, a lot of her enemies had a bird's eye view of her and could've easily launched an arrow attack.
Â 
Littlefingers scene in the cave was accurate- I just think he needs to talk like he did in S1
Â 
Sansa and Dontos easily escaping KL at the exact moment when Tywin was shouting for all the guards to be on alert. There was literally no one (not to mention guards) stationed in the streets around the area- it made Tywin look ridiculous.
Â 
Oberyn's brothel scene; we already had one when he first appears and it should've been enough to show his being open about his sexuality. But they could've given him more background or even a conversation about Dorne but it was just pointless repetition.

Â 
Me too. On the other hand, just two episodes ago, the QoT admonished Margeary for a witty remark against Joffrey, reminding her they should play nice even when chatting in their garden lair due to the Game of Informants that goes on in Kings Landing.

Â 
I believe the show did a decent job of showing that Dany and company were just out of arrow range.Â  Remember the barrage of arrows Mereen launched after Darrio killed their champion.Â  They all fell shortÂ a few feet in front of them.
Â 
Of course, that clearly undercuts Mereen being able to hear Dany's speech.Â  Realistically, as Dany was talking, everyone in Mereen should've been like, "huh?!, what?!" (ala "Kung Fu Panda 2").Â  But that wouldn't have played well so the show runners just played it off like everyone in Mereen could hear her.
2701	7th-key	2014-04-25	^ Also, I don't think you can catapult things further that you can shoot an arrow with a bow.
Especially since the barrels go UP a wall, while the arrows are shot DOWN...

Â 
I'm not sure of the mechanism behind a catapult but it is a bigger, heavier, machine than a single-man pulling a bowstring.Â  It doesn't seem inconceivable to me that it would have greater range than an arrow fired from a bow.

Â 
I see you went with the practical approach.Â  At first I thought the person was a woman, but something about the voice made me second guess, and the creepier the scene became, the more confused I was.Â  Then I had the thought, wait a minute.......reminds me of a former guitar playing boyfriend, minus the creep factor, LOLÂ  It's a hard call.Â

2705	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-25	Catapults could be expected to have a range of 400m and the best Welsh Bowmen with yew longbows could reach 350m at maximum range. Both of these are on the flat though and as others have said, the defenders have height advantage.
Â 
Other points to note are that in the scene, the catapults used may not be the type that could reach 400m and the bows used areÂ highly unlikely to be able to reach 350m - even 250 would be a stretch.
Â 
What is more unlikely is that the defenders would be able to hear Dany's voice over that range.

Â 
Well it also depends on what has been catapulted. A 10 pound rock would fly two times further that a 30 pound rock (source). Never mind aÂ  wobbly bundle.
Never the less, it could have been more possible than I thought. Thanks for the answer

2707	Whipsy	2014-04-25	I'm sure it's been mentioned before but I also thought the escape scene with Sansa running through the alleys intertwined with shots of Cersei screaming, about being a bitch or something, was pretty terrible. It felt rushed and more like shots for a "previously on Game of Thrones....' recap. It gave the opening a really cheap cable vibe.Â
2708	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-25	Wooden barrels of the size they were flinging would be closer to 100 pounds than 10, and that's not even factoring in the weight of the chains. Â Based on the trajectory (some were still ascending as they flew over the site of the archers), if their flight hadn't been interrupted then many (if not all) of them would have travelled more than twice the distance of the arrows (you lose much more distance launching low-to-high than you gain going high-to-low, btw).
Â 
At any rate, dem some dam strong catterpolts...

Â 
The first few minutes of the episode were really quite awful. Â First you've got Cersei, who immediately went from 'grief' to 'anger' to 'contemplative detective' (My son is dead... Â You did this! Â Where is Sansa?).
Â 
Then you've got the awkward 'power shot' of Tywin demanding the city gates be closed (whoopsie, guess we forgot to grab that while the extras were on set...).
Â 
Followed, of course, by the least dramatic 'dramatic escape' in the history of History.

Dracarys was the best episode for me for S3, liked it better than the RW.

I preferred the book version
But the dracarys scene and the RW was pretty much the only things that were interesting in season 3
2715	Skeksi	2014-04-26	I'm absolutely sure I'm not the first person to complain about the rape scene. But since it's the "nitpicking with impunity thread", I'm going to do it anyway.
Â 
Now, just to get this out of the way first, I do find the sept scene in the books problematic. Jaime ignores Cersei's initial protests, so stricken with desire is he, which even though Cersei does consent to the sex after her initial reaction, does reflect a problematic attitude towards consent (ignore the person saying no, just keep going until they admit they do want you after all, when a person's "No" should always be taken seriously, regardless of the reasoning). Had the director/ writers/ showrunners come out and stated "Well, we found that the scene in the books was pretty ambiguously consensual, and we felt that that gave off a troubling message, so we decided to remove that and actually show that no, this is a dark scene and what Jaime is doing is wrong". That would be, I think, fair enough. But they didn't. They see the scene as it appeared in the books- two people who want each other, but one of them is worried about discovery. The sex is consensual- or at least, becomes that way by the end. And that HAS to inform how the characters act going ahead. Not to mention, this scene isn't like the books:
Â 
- Unlike the books, where, once Cersei DOES give her consent, it is verbal and enthusiastic, there is no point in the scene where Cersei is saying anything other than "No" "Stop" or "This isn't right". There is NEVER a point where that changes. Yes, she kisses him back, but we know they are/ were attracted to each other, and that they were in a relationship. In real life, people in relationships are raped and sexually assaulted. They are raped and sexually assaulted by people that they might find attractive. If the notion was that it was be definitely consensual by the end, then why have her continually voice her objections? Why not actually include the line out of the book? It would still be a problematic scene- see above- but the notion that a person sobbing and asking their attacker to stop is consenting on any level beggars belief.
Â 
- The whole scene in the books takes place when Jaime and Cersei first meet. Jaime in the books is motivated by desire for Cersei, to be with his lover again. In the show, Jaime has been back for weeks. Cersei has rebuffed his advances during this time- more than once. Jaime in the show is motivated by anger. Anger at Cersei. Anger at Cersei for rejecting him. I've seen comments from viewers/ readers about Cersei deserving it because she's a bad person, and I have to point out a) Ew. Sexualised punishments, not cool. I don't get people framing Theon's castration as something he "deserved", either. and  Cersei is being "punished" by Jaime because she rejects him. Not because she killed Lady, or arrested Ned, or let Joffrey run wild, or for laughing at the Red Wedding, or even for wanting Tyrion killed without trial. But for the oh-so-horrendous crime of not wanting to fuck Jaime. People are not entitled to sex, or a relationship, and they are certainly not entitled to force someone into it until they give in.
Â 
The problem is, what the show did was take a somewhat problematic scene in the books, and made it infinitely more problematic. The problem is, rather than intentionally portraying this as a monstrous action of Jaime's (in the way that Joffrey's execution of Ned, the Red Wedding, and pretty much everything Ramsay ever does are shown as monstrous, horrible actions), the people involved with this scene created this as something that they intended to represent a consensual sexual encounter in a disturbing setting, and instead created something that the vast, vast majority of their viewers see as a rape. I mean, on the one hand I'm relieved to see so many people labelling it as rape because of Cersei's constant vocal protests, rather than stating "well, she's not fighting enough" or "They were in a relationship so she must have consented!" (not that I haven't seen these reactions too, but not as many as I might have expected given the victim blaming you often see in reports about sexual assaults in the modern day), but on the other hand, if these characters act like they just had a consensual sexual encounter on screen, then ... I don't even know. I've overlooked a fair bit of questionable stuff from the TV show towards it's female characters, but usually I roll my eyes and move on, this has been making me angry since I watched it.
Â 
For another, less serious bit of nitpicking, I hope they're not going to drag "Who really killed Joffrey?" out into some sort of ongoing mystery. It was solved pretty much instantly in the books by Littlefinger- the impact of the reveal was not because it was dragged out for ages but because we find out that after all the misery that Joffrey caused, and all of the people who had cause to genuinely hate him, he was killed not out of revenge, but to further the political agendas of two schemers (Olenna and the Tyrells by allowing them to marry Margaery to a more pleasant and easily influenced Lannister king, and LF by creating the chaos that he thrives in, and allowing him to seize the heir to the North in the confusion), and that they get away with it whilst Tyrion and Sansa - who DO have reason to hate Joff personally -take the blame. Now that we know that LF knew about the murder, and had the fake necklace made, it's pretty obvious that he has something to do with it, just reveal the plan rather than drag it out.

2717	The Reader Lisa	2014-04-27	I must confess that at the end of Episode 3, I turned to my son and said "That episode wasn't too bad. The best
so far". However.........I want to pick up on GRRM's comment about the butterfly effect and apply it to what they've
done to my favorite part of the books: Arya and the Hound.
Â 
I once described their scenes in SoS as The Ransom of Red Chief meets True Grit. What HBO is giving us is
Lone Wolf and Cub played for laughs. People seem to enjoy these scenes; I find parts of them funny myself
but they are a far cry from the beautifully developed story line GRRM wrote. The reason for this (and this is
where the butterfly effect comes in) is that with the whole SanSan story line tossed out the window like Bran,
there isn't much left for Arya and the Hound to talk about. There's no compelling hidden agenda for the Hound
to ingratiate himself with the Starks (when there were still Starks). The scene at the Inn was when the Hound
found out Sansa had been married to Tyrion in the book and he was really thrown by the news. On the show,
he just wants some chicken (a word I don't think is ever used in the books - how's that for nit-picky?). What's he going to say on his deathbed? Ask for more chicken? It's beyond sad.
Â 
And SanSan aside, isn't Arya just a little too perky? Shouldn't she be more traumatized by the Red Wedding?
In the book, she describes this hole in her where her heart used to be. She's shellshocked. Not getting any
of that from the show. She's more like a prepubescent Mary Tyler Moore running around with a grumpy Lou
Grant. The girl's got spunk. I hate spunk.
Â 
Also in the book, they are running for their lives; the Freys are out in force mopping up escapees from the Twins. Okay, we see them ride by some unconvincing dead bodies(where are the crows?) but the precariousness of
their situation doesn't seem to come across.
Â 
Sad.....it's just sad.
2718	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-22	We seem to have most if not all of Essos magic thru Dany, Thoros, and Melisandre, but where all the prophets/magic from Westeros? Have D & D backed themselves into a corner they can't get out of? So much of the story is based off of prophecy, and the most important ones have been either left out, or have water down versions given to other characters. I am sure I forgot some but off the top of my head....
Â 
No Patchface, so none of his "songs". What does Shireen do all day waiting for Davos? Well at least the Greyjoy's have mention the Drowned God.
Â 
No Coldhands, so how are Bran and co going to eat let alone fight off wights and NW men? and how did Sam find the Black Gate? Was there a Black Gate? I don't think Sam even went back down w/ them. So no alternate NW vows.
Â 
No Ghost of High Heart (or even High Heart) they took her telling of Ayra's smelling of Death and gave it to Melisandre.
No near miss of Nymeria, or even the Ayra's dreams of her or rumors of wolves in Riverlands. No foretelling of Ayra's brothers or sister. Let only all the Targaryen backstory around her.
Â 
Where is Ghost? Have we seen him since Jon went w/ the Wildlings? Nothing saying of his wolf dreams either. Did the show Wildlings even know him as a warg? wasn't that part of the reasonÂ most of themÂ accepted him in? IS Bran the only warg?
Â 
Maggy the frog, seems to be cut out of both sides. Since she wasn't Robb's wife grandmother, and now Cersie seems to make all about what Tyrion said. One of the major reason she hated Tyrion, and Margaery were because of Maggy, and we have not heard of that or any prophecy. Â 
Â 
Â
2719	AzorAhai42	2014-04-24	I understand most of the changes, but out of the ones you mentioned, I am quite curious about Maggy the Frog. I would have imagined that prophecy coming up by now. They still have time to do it, I guess, but they might just get rid of it.Â 
Â 
Another major prophesy/prophesying event that you didn't mention was Dany's House of the Undying. I was disappointed that they cut all of those prophecies out. I really enjoyed reading those in the book and hypothesizing what they meant.
Â 
The only thing I can figure is that D&D are afraid that doing too many prophecies in the show will be too much of a spoiler for later events. That's the only reason I can think that they've cut out so many prophesy events.Â 
Â 
And I've read in several places that the only warging/dreams that will be shown are going to be Bran's, so as not to confuse exclusively show watchers. Anytime we see a dream or a warging moment through the eyes of the warged animal/person, it will be Bran doing it.

I hope not for good.

I can only speak for myself, but it just puts me off so much that something so central to the Starks (the warging) is just brushed aside, yet we can spend lots and lots of time on whores, etc. (Yes, we have Bran's warging but we're going to need to see Jon's ability before long.)Â I have no issue with T&A on the show but theyÂ don't drive the plot or add to character development --Â and it's at the expense of important story elements.Â 
Â

All the elements that *I* consider important, but are being excluded, I justshrug and say 'eh.Â 
Â 
Different mediums, I guess, Â :-)
2722	FalseKnight	2014-04-24	When I was still unsullied, Bran's dreams confused me. Adding Arya or Jon's dreams would have killed the show. The prophesies are so cliched tropish. I would have cut the Azor Ahai crap too. Melisandre's visions are okay because she misinterprets them. THotU would have been too confusing onscreen. The valanqar prophesy might work.
2723	MoA«t	2014-04-25	THotU couldn't be shot for many reasons: budget, and most of it would have been giant spoilers for the audience. I totally get why they changed it, and loved all the new stuff they gave us. 
While I love the valanqar business, especially since I think Cersei has it wrong, and it will be Jamie, other thing are available to drive Cersei's narrative, so I can see how it's not required. 
Too many prophecies would lose the audience and break the show. The Unsullied are barely keeping their heads above water as it is. Thankfully, GRRM kills a lot of characters to make room for new ones. 
What will disappoint me would be if they skip the Stark warging. Although I haven't given up hope, especially since Bran's scene in ep2 with the Hodoring deer, is a great setup for a similar scene where when the dreamer wakes, we see it's Jon or Arya, and not Bran. That would be an amazing surprise at this point for everyone, including book readers. 
Warging just seems to be a big deal in all three of their story lines....... So I hope we see it soon.
2724	dbunting	2014-04-25	@ OP, Ghost is still North of the wall, he obviously didn't climb the wall with Jon. Looks as though Jon and others will be heading to Crasters keep next episode, perfect time for Jon and Ghost reunion.
2725	boojam	2014-04-25	They did introduce Quaithe (Laura Pradelska) in season 2 but did not use her , that I remember, to do Quaithe-like things.Never talks to Daenerys at all.Thought for the Eastern stuff Quaithe was going to be a cypher, of sorts.Not a lot of time spent on it, but some, poor Laura Pradelska , I wonder if we will ever see her again?

Â 
I think it will be fine if they delay Jon's warging to be a shock moment at the point of the NW stabbing.
Â 
But for that to work, they will need to establish Arya's abilities.
Â 
My ideal setup would be for Arya to have a wolf dream at the end of this season (preferably Nymeria witnessing LSH), then have Arya warg into the cat at the end of next season, just before the Jon incident.
2727	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-25	I wouldn't have thought that including warging for Jon and Arya would be that confusing for unsullied, you see a scene from an obvious wolf's POV then one of them wakes up from a dream, simples ;-)Â 
I think its sad that a lot of the prophecies are not included, but for a visual medium it would be massive spoilers, even for us book readers as the prophecies have many different interpretations, it would be hard to show them while keeping details vague. I suppose an important one for character development coming up is Maggy's prophecy to Cersei, as said above it is important to show why Cersei hates Tyrion and Margaery so much. But I don't see them introducing it this season, there is so much going on as it is.Â
2728	Skore	2014-04-25	Given that Bran is probably going to be wedded to the tree this season (as they have cast Bloodraven), they have the opportunity to use his scenes to fill in some prophecy missing so far.
Â 
If you think about it, it will probably make more sense in a TV format to show things through Bran's eyes to info-dump Westeros history via the weirnet to the viewers without:
Â 
a) spoiling the plot as visual medium is not as subtle as book prophecy would be
 confusing the shit out of the non-book audience
c) ensuring that his character arc doesn't advance beyond the published books at this point
2729	go joff go	2014-04-26	I think they also want to avoid LOST/battlestar gallacta syndrome, where people start noticing how things don't match up or that prophecies aren't fulfilled. Â It's probably smarter to never establish the expectations that come with prophicies
Â 
There is a pretty strong argument that grrm is going to have this problem.

2730	Tywin Smokin a Blunt	2014-04-26	Just because it hasn't been there yet doesn't mean it won't come in to play eventually.   They have a good bit of space in the next two seasons to fill out to avoid catching up with the books, for instance I think that's why they've sped up Bran's storyline, using his abilities, they can reinsert a lot of the foreshadowing they missed.  The one thing that does concern me is the absence of the other direwolves,  and lack of warging abilities for the other Stark kids.  I really hope they address this soon because the idea of it being cut out bothers me.   There was a scene last season where Robb's wife seems to be aware of his wolf dreams,  but that's the sole reference I remember.
2731	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-26	I can only speak for myself, but it just puts me off so much that something so central to the Starks (the warging) is just brushed aside, yet we can spend lots and lots of time on whores, etc. (Yes, we have Bran's warging but we're going to need to see Jon's ability before long.)Â I have no issue with T&A on the show but theyÂ don't drive the plot or add to character development --Â and it's at the expense of important story elements.Â

Pretty much my feeling as well. I get a lot of why some characters were left out, or changed to play parts of another. IIRC I read that GoT has the record w/ 50 speaking characters. I believe the book has at least 3x that many. The opening Oberyn scene in the Whorehouse was great. They told you all of what you needed to know in one scene instead of 3 or 4, but others just take time away from other stories for no point what so ever.Â 
Â 


When I was still unsullied, Bran's dreams confused me. Adding Arya or Jon's dreams would have killed the show. The prophesies are so cliched tropish. I would have cut the Azor Ahai crap too. Melisandre's visions are okay because she misinterprets them. THotU would have been too confusing onscreen. The valanqar prophesy might work.


Had not heard the term unsullied for uninformed viewer, I like it. I understand your point, but disagree. Having Arya or Jon Waking up after showing warg dream works just as well as when Bran wakes up after one. Having Cersei tell someone the story of Maggy the Frog/ visions would work just as well as Varys telling how he go cut, and is a much bigger part of the story, w/ much more impact on what/ and who Cersei is, and what her thinking is. Not saying that Varys part isn't important, but w/ so much still missing as of aDwD did we really need to here it?
Â 


While I love the valanqar business, especially since I think Cersei has it wrong, and it will be Jamie, other thing are available to drive Cersei's narrative, so I can see how it's not required.


She does have it wrong, it will be Stannis, The Little brother, she doesn't even think about.Â
2732	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-26	I totally agree. These few magically-mysterious individuals made the series more interesting.
Â 
But their screen-time got cut in favor of Oberyn banging a lad/lass or two, in each episode.

But I don't see them introducing it this season, there is so much going on as it is.Â 


Â 
Â 
On the subject of warging: I agree. It wouldn't be that confusing, particularly since we've already seen how it works (Bran). I think we'll see Jon and Arya warging, but only as soon as it becomes truly relevant, which means: Jon's last scene of ADWD and Arya with the cat in Bravos. Remember how so many people on this board thought that they would cut Ramsay? Or the entire back story of Rhaegar and Elia? Well they didn't. They only waited to introduce them until they became truly relevant.
Â 
On the prophecies: There are to main problems with showing the prophecies / green dreams on the show:
Â 
1) logistical issues (needs more actors, more time shooting, editing, more special effects etc.)
2) it's either going to confuse the hell out of viewers ("Wtf is up with the blue rose?") or it's going to spoil everything, e. g. Dany seeing a man with a wolf's head instead of a human head - she doesn't know Robb Stark, so she doesn't know who that guy is, but the viewers certainly do!
2734	ipsuel	2014-04-27	Pretty much my feeling as well. I get a lot of why some characters were left out, or changed to play parts of another.

Â 


Â 
Agree. I didn't mind Oberyn's opening scene as well - in fact, I liked it. Now we, the audience, get that he's a sexual/sensual being and that Dorne is different than KL, in that sex really isn't a big deal, no matter your preferences. It gave us just what we needed to know in one scene, you're right.
Â 
Now... use the other time you have for furthering the plot, ADDING something to the characters, (prophecies, warging *cough, cough*) etc... I think just mentioning the whole Cersei prophecy would take 5 seconds of air-time, yet give an additional depth on the Cersei/Tyrion dynamic.Â 
Â 
I mean, it's kinda sad that the running joke about HBO is T&A. Is that really what they want people to remember about this awesome production?
Â 
(PLUS... there's enough legitimate book-sex that if they really feel the need to add more t&a -- how about draw from the books? Â Dany's had girl on girl playtime as has Cersei. There's a million different scenes they could draw from instead of letting us know (again) that Bronn digs whores (just one example).) Â
2735	ToTheWolves	2014-04-27	So no jon or arya warging?
2736	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-27	The prophecies have been cut because D&D (as well as most modern showrunners/filmmakers/audiences) privilege shock value over suspense. They want things like the RW, Dany's betrayals, and Cersei's eventual murder to come as a total surprise to the unsullied, rather than building up tension before those events.
As for the Stark children's warging, I think they removed it in order to make Bran's storyline seem more special (though at the same time they've done very little to make Bran's storyline seem interesting). But I'm guessing that once Bran bonds with the weirwood this season or next, D&D will use him to "awaken" his brothers' & sisters' latent abilities.
2737	Dany's Silver	2014-04-27	They did introduce Quaithe (Laura Pradelska) in season 2 but did not use her , that I remember, to do Quaithe-like things.
Never talks to Daenerys at all.
Thought for the Eastern stuff Quaithe was going to be a cypher, of sorts.
Not a lot of time spent on it, but some, poor Laura Pradelska , I wonder if we will ever see her again?


Â 
I hope we'll see her in Meereen next season. The warning she gives to Dany in that vision is one of my favourite scenes in ADWD, and I hope to see it in the show:
Â 

Â 
The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.

To be fair, what would youÂ  have done do with Stannis (not the Dragonstone storyline, Stannis himself) in Season 3?Â  His character admittedly doesn't do much other than stand around in the first 3/4 of ASoS other than worry and fire off orders until Davos kicks him into gear.Â  They actually gave him more content to work with, such as seeing Shireen.
Â 
If they made too much "new" content you'd see a lot of hate for not sticking to the books as well.

2750	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-20	The thing is, at the end of S3, the decision was made to go to the wall. 2 episodes in we have seen no action on that front and it appears that Ep3 might have some AA information but they still won't be setting sail. Casual watchers who might have been interested surely must be wondering what is going on.

I'm just happy to see him, no matter what  I think it's actually a good strategy to have him in all those scenes that seem like he is defeated and expendable (at least to TV audience people I know) and them BAM! episode 9. I just hope the pay off will be grand.

Â 
Stannis and Davos will discuss Joffrey's death in the episode, according to the preview, so they have no excuse not to put this in unless they are going out of their way to make Stannis humorless (which may very well be their intention, but I still have hope since he was funny in season two).
Â 
I also hope they correct my primary issue (at the moment) with the writing for Stannis. That issue being that he's not treating the Night's Watch problem with any urgency. He should be on a boat by now. He should be a man on a mission, brimming with newfound confidence. Instead, he's the same mopey wounded dog from season three.

Dude, he needs to go to Meereen and start fighting dragons with his bare hands like he did in the books.Â 
Â 
But seriously, I like the idea of splitting book 3 into two seasons but it has had the unintended consequence of seriously slowing down some storylines. Bran and Stannis being at the forefront there.Â
2763	Volverin	2014-04-20	They split book 3 into two seasons but rumour has it they want to show book 4 and 5 in just one season? Very strange.

The plan is to make 7 seasons, so they will have to fit the events from 4 books into three seasons. Seems like lots of cuts will be made.

Actually, I like that bit. Remember, in the books Jon also notes that Stannis could've arrived earlier. It's implied that he took his sweet time to get there.


Regardless, I feel it should reflect a change in attitude. I know it's too early to say from just his scenes in episode two, but I wish they turn it around in tonight's episode.
2765	Widows_Blood	2014-04-20	They split book 3 into two seasons but rumour has it they want to show book 4 and 5 in just one season? Very strange.
Â 
The plan is to make 7 seasons, so they will have to fit the events from 4 books into three seasons. Seems like lots of cuts will be made.


More like one and a half seasons since they will bet getting into books 4/5 this season. The thing is books 4/5 has so much fluff that can be eliminated and still portray a very streamlined adaption of those books. Cersei KL chapters, Briennes boring ass travelogues, trim down Ironborn storyline, Dornish storyline, edit down Jon, Dany, and Tyrion chapters. GRRM went crazy with world-building in those books. So it can be easily edited down.Â
2766	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-20	I hope to see Stannis actually do something other than stand around in dark rooms looking mopey and depressed while Mel slithers around spouting mysterious religious clap-trap.Â  That is all.


I agree but at the same time I don't want that something to be revealing their plans to go to the wall. I know they semi-ruined it in episode 310 but I believe most unsullied didn't fully pick up on that. I'm still hoping most people will be surprised when Stannis reaches the wall, as they should be.Â
2767	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-20	What I want to see is the reveal that LF is the one who is pulling Dontos's strings and that he was in on Joffrey's poisoning.

Â 
Yeah, I guess you're right. But they will still have to show two enormous books full of action (I assume) in two seasons. Not sure there will be enough time for that.
Â 
I just hope they won't cut down all the important storylines. Ironborn and Dornish must be there!
2769	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-20	What I'm most looking forward : Arya and the Hound, Stannis, Sansa's escape.
Â 
What I'm definitely NOT looking forward : Jaime and Cersei (I feel a big nope coming).
2770	iheartseverus	2014-04-20	^^ Oh yeah, I forgot about that scene!Â  Look at all the furor that exploded after Gran de Lys just told us about it, yikes.Â  I always look forward to browsing all the episode reactions during the week between shows, but this week, I'm going to avoid any thread that has the word 'rape' in the title.

Oh, how I disagree.Â  That scene is one of my favorites and is pretty much the one I am most looking forward to in all of its bloody glory.
2773	Rashtibram	2014-04-20	About the sept sex scene, it really does sound a lot more ambiguous than it's being talked about, based on whatÂ Gran de Lys andÂ Ran have said. Â 
Â 
Â 

	Spoiler Cersei demands Jaime avenge their baby boy and kill Tyrion. He kisses her in response and she kisses him back, the pulls away to look at Joff some more. Anger and lust grow over Jaime's face and he asks why the gods make him love a hateful woman, then he grabs her. They grapple, Cersei saying "Stop, stop! Jaime, no!" He wrestles her onto the floor and unzips etc. Now, all this time she is kissing him back, but she's hitting him with her fists against the chest and saying "It's not right." 

Â 

Â 
Â 
Â 
That doesn't sound like he's 100% taking her against her will, not if she's kissing him back. It actually seems quite similar to his scene with her in 1x03 (albeit longer and more graphic). I guess we'll see tonight, though.

Yeah, I'm getting sick of Dragonstone as well. It's only potential there. Potential for something better, but it just stays on a flatline.

Pretty much this.
2781	Volverin	2014-04-20	Why would be there such threads? I dont get it, people should already figure out this show is not a story for kids, it shows very serious and often dark stuff. Really can't understand how someone would feel offended.Â Its not like we'll be seeing a child being raped or whatever.

It's not that people would be offended by the content: it's that they think it would go against Jaime's character to have him rape someone.
2783	SarahApril	2014-04-20	I want to see the resurrection of Catelyn Stark on Easter Sunday after she has been dead for 3 episodes.


Â 
Ok, that won't happen until the last episode.Â
2784	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-20	I want(ed) to see Alester Florent's "Operation Valkyrie". It would bring some much needed momentum for Team Dragonstone, some action, intrigue and it would paint Stannis/Mel in a more favorable light to see them burning actual traitors.
Â 
But the thing I want to see the most is Balon Greyjoy walking across a bridge. An ironborn guard walks towards him, going in the opposite direction. It's kind of dark and cloudy so we don't see the guard's face very well. They meet at the center of the bridge. The guard doesn't move. Balon starts to say, "Get off my way, you...", but then the guard grabs hold of him, they struggle a bit, the bridge sways alarmingly, there's a long shot of the bridge and Balon falling to the sea.Â 
Â 
The guard walks to the end of the bridge, turns around, and wee see Tom Wlaschiha smirking
2785	Konradsmith	2014-04-20	^I'd hoped that would be in last episode/
2786	SarahApril	2014-04-20	Cersei/Jamie scene near Joff's corpse. HBO will make that one funny.
2787	Rashtibram	2014-04-20	I think the chances of Balon dying in the first half of this season are honestly pretty slim at this point. They'll likely move events back a bit and have him fall off a bridge in or around the finale (or even in early season 5) so that they can include the Kingsmoot in S5 and not have a disjointed, bloated Ironborn arc like the one we got in the books.
Â 
At least, that's what I hope will happen.

Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I do want almost every episode this season to have a "holy shit" moment, and Jaqen killing Balon out of nowhere would be it

2790	Mr Fixit	2014-04-20	Ok, that won't happen until the last episode.Â 


Â 
Is it possible that the Stoneheart reveal was shot during the filming of Season 3, but purposely left for this season?
Â 
It would be practical since all the actors are already there: Cat, Thoros, Anguy, some Frey weasel, etc, and they wouldn't need to reassemble the actors involved just for this one scene a year later. There's also an unused track on Season 3 soundtrack named "Dark Wings, Dark Words" that is so eerie, spooky, and sad... almost perfect for this scene.Â

2791	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-20	Isn't that exactly how it goes down in the book?

Yes. It is.There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her, only hunger. Her mouth opened for his tongue. "No," she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck, "not here. The septons . . ."
"The Others can take the septons." He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Mother's altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath. She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of gods. He never heard her.

It might play out a little rougher in the episode than some people imagined, but it's all there.
2792	Rashtibram	2014-04-20	Mr. Fixit:Â Bryan Cogman explicitly confirmed that no version of the ASOS epilogue was shot last year. When pressed for more details, he said he couldn't discuss with fans what we would/wouldn't be seeing in season 4.

Plus, there will inevitably be the 'no-means-no' anger (and ladies?Â  I'm a woman, so, SIsterhood Mine, don't leap down my throat here!), whether this is a fictional world in a fictional story, or not.Â  So, between those two factions, its gonna be a rough week for those of us who just want ordinary, simple things, like:
Â 
1.Â  Stannis, I love you dear.Â  But, do something!
Â 
2.Â  Dany, repeat after me, ready?Â  'Drogon.Â  VIserion.Â  Rhaegal.'Â  You can do it.Â  Seriously.

Since it shares the same title as episode 2, I'm guessing it was originally supposed to be used in the scene where Robb and gang find out about Rickon and Bran. Or the Catelyn scene where she talks about Jon. IDK.

Â 
It's just so weird since it's the only track that was not used in the show out of all 3 soundtracks (For the Realm is just acoustic version of main title) and there are so many music cues that were used in the series that weren't on actual soundtrack. It seems to me they shot something, Djawadi wrote the track and in last minute they decided not to use the scene.

2802	Volverin	2014-04-20	Well, I meant the talk Tyrion will have with Oberyn before the combat. So before we get to that there will be a normal trial right? So if you say their talk will take place in episode 7 that means the normal trial would last 4 episodes. I think there is not THAT much to show from the normal trial. Tyrion's speech, Shae's lies about him, some other people talking about him I guess. This shouldnt take 4 episodes imo.

But Tyrion spends plenty of time in his jail cell. The trial will be just one episode and it looks like it's ep.6. According to the showrunners Tyrion spends 70 minutes of screentime in his cell this season.

Â 
My thinking is that Tywin, Shae, Lysa and Lady Stoneheart + Children of the Forest are all in finale. They keep saying this is the biggest episode and proper finale so it's probably gonna have tons of those amazing moments instead of being just the clean up after ep. 9 like usual GoT finale.
2808	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-20	This. I never understood the viewpoint that they need to show her actual resurrection in an anticlimactic way halfway through a random episode. It doesn't make any sense. She'll be in the finale or not at all.So an undead noble woman is MORE of a twist than LF and Lysa revealing they were behind the Stark Lannister conflict, the poisoning of Jon Arryn, and LF then pushing the crazy bitch through the moon door after letting her know she's just a game piece for her? If you say so. However, we already know that the dead can be revived and that this seasons pace is going to move so quickly that we'll have some AFfc/adwd material in it. 
I'm sorry but I never felt that the unCat reveal was so significant. Could've just had Beric still be in charge and had the same results, or Blackfish taking over Bwb after escaping rr.
Eta Tywins death is more of a significant plot point than LS and that could also be in the finale.

Â 
Having someone who has been dead entire season and one of the show's main characters brought back to the living, someone who was previously shown as honorable and loving mother now being ruthless and vengeful and looking ghastly and scary at the same time? Yeah, I'd say it's more of a twist than LF who is established as a skilled player and a ruthless man being manipulative and ruthless.
Â 
Having Cat in charge adds more significance to it. She is avenging her dead son, her dead husband, her broken family.

He disappears after Tyrion leaves until the end of Dance with Dragons. Do you think they will still keep him in the public eye of King's Landing? No one will know he helped Tyrion escape except Jamie. And Jamie leaves for the Riverlands.

I hope so, I love Varys on the show. His facial expressions are hilarious
2814	Volverin	2014-04-20	I think it will be more powerful though if Varys dissapears in episode 10 and reappears in episode 10 of next season. But I agree the show would lose some of its greatness with him not around.

They can't have an actor appear in only 1 episode. I wish they could though I would rather have stannis disappear until episode 9&10 instead of making up some BS but that's just how it is.

No he doesn't. Conleth Hell* is a regular. Fairley is not (any more). But then again Joe Dempsie (Gendry) is a regular and not appearing this season. Who knows?
Â 
*Edit: Conleth Hill (lol)

2820	StarkBlack21	2014-04-20	Has it been confirmed that Gendry won't be in this season? Won't Brienne cross paths with him?
2821	Volverin	2014-04-20	Well, I actually don't know what you mean.  Why can't we have Varys appearing in just one episode next season? It would go with the story in the books... Dont get me wrong, I actually would love for the show to keep him and think of some other way for him to maybe dissapear in the middle of season 5 and then come back again for the epilog scene but I don't see a reason why they can't just make him play in one episode next season. Its not impossible.
2822	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-20	I hope to see Stannis actually do something other than stand around in dark rooms looking mopey and depressed while Mel slithers around spouting mysterious religious clap-trap.Â  That is all.
This.
2823	StarkBlack21	2014-04-20	Why has Tywin not asked about Arya yet? You'd think he'd be pissed off that Cersei lost her.
2824	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-20	I want to see Jon get more screen time and really setup the Wildling attack.

But the thing I want to see the most is Balon Greyjoy walking across a bridge. An ironborn guard walks towards him, going in the opposite direction. It's kind of dark and cloudy so we don't see the guard's face very well. They meet at the center of the bridge. The guard doesn't move. Balon starts to say, "Get off my way, you...", but then the guard grabs hold of him, they struggle a bit, the bridge sways alarmingly, there's a long shot of the bridge and Balon falling to the sea.Â 
Â 
The guard walks to the end of the bridge, turns around, and wee see Tom Wlaschiha smirking


Â 
Season 3 should have ended with a faceless man throwing Balon off the bridge at Pyke(Thats if it even was him). Â Instead we got that rubbish slightly racist sell out scene of Dany at Mereen.
Â 
What would have been cool if he was looking at Asha's boat in the distance and said to one of his man to send word to Victarion to rally the Iron Fleet for an assault on the Dreadfort. Then in typical ASOIAF fashion he would be flung off the bridge.

End the season with one of the most popular characters on the show (for television audience) VS end the season with a character who has been in like 3 episodes who television audiences don't care about making reference to another character who a television audience has never heard of.Â
2826	Jinjonator	2014-04-20	Makes more sense to have Balon die in the season 4 finale than season 3, since, iirc, Euron comes back to the Iron Islands very shortly after Balon's death.
2827	Hath4	2014-04-20	Yeah euron arriving in the iron islands on his badass evil ship silence would be an epic 1 st scene for season 5.

Â 
I just think it was a complete cop out. Season 2 ended with Sam and the Others marching on the Fist. Having Balon and a faceless man would have kept up the supernatural trend for final scene and left people's jaws on the floor like S1 + 2's endings. Then have LS for S4 and Pate for S5. Whats done is done but it could have been done a lot better.Â
2829	Jinjonator	2014-04-20	It would only keep up the supernatural trend if they made it very explicit how he died. Except Balon's death is supposed to be very ambiguous.
Â 
(And again, it'd be weird, since there would be an incredibly long period of time with no one on the Seastone Chair, and one would wonder what the heck took the Greyjoy uncles so long)

Yea I figured as much...and as far as the chant I can't see WHY they would change it but at this point it wouldnt surprise me. I'm not a diehard stannis fan but that moment in the book is when I really started to enjoy his character. And I have a feeling they're going to cut the "the wall is yours jon snow" line also.

I personally wouldn't be disappointed if they don't yell the chant during the charge.... as long as it is replaced by something as powerful - like having the chant at the moment of victory: the troops and NW raising their swords and hailing him then cut and credits roll.

Â 
I'm hoping that because they're really building to it this season, it will be rewarding. It's not about matching the books bit by bit, but the core has to be there.
2845	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-27	I can't recall: was Jeyne Poole introduced in the first season?


Â 
I think Sansa mentions her once, during her conversation with her Septa in the Throne Room.
2846	Mladen	2014-04-20	As usual, we start with reminder that there will be spoilers from all 5 books of ASOIAF series, so you are advised to be careful if you haven't read the books.
Â 
Given the experience from last thread, please be polite to others and stick to the topic...Â 
Â 
And now, Sansa in this episode. This episode, in terms of Sansa's arc, can be considered rather significant deviation from the book series. Although it is arguable that small change such as in how Sansa escaped King's Landing is significant, there is that point that the words "escape" and "taken from" are in fact 2 different words, and as such represent change. Luckily, the adaptation of Sansa's character hasn't gone through debauchery such as Tyrion (known as St. Tyrion of House Whitewashing), Jaime ("I pushed kid off the window, what's raping a sister for me") and Stannis, but the pile of these small changes can be considered troublesome.
Â 
The second part of this thread's discussion is the necklace. Many theories revolving Sansa was around possibility of use of the hairnet in the books (necklace in the TV show). With destruction of the gems and throwing it into a boat with Dontos, one can argue that it was a small hint about the importance of the "Chekhov's hairnet". What's your opinion about that?
Â 
Once again, welcome to the Discussing Sansa thread...
2847	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-20	Didn't like it. Either we won't have Sansa poisoning Littlefinger with it or they just didn't care
2848	Colonel Green	2014-04-20	Yeah, I think we can write off the hairnet theory, though that was always based more on a detail omission than anything else.
Â 
I said over the review thread, but the way the actual escape was staged was just terrible, on a filming level.Â  It makes getting out of King's Landing look easy-peasy.Â  I get that the book's cliff-scaling was not likely feasible, but surely something more challenging could have been devised?Â  And then just a smash cut to the middle of the night and fog.Â  No sense of the passage of time or anything.
Â 
The actual scene with Littlefinger was decent, though.Â  They jury-rigged an adequate substitute for Littlefinger's missing "life is not a song" line callback.Â  Though her protests regarding Dontos' intentions just have no emotional depth to them given how the grand sum of their interactions on the show were about thirty seconds.

					
					
							Edited by Colonel Green, 20 April 2014 - 10:50 PM.
2849	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-20	Irked by this yes. However, i do not think we need to toss out the idea that Sansa will kick LF's ass. In fact, im beginning to think that in the show, if LF gets poisoned, she does it with Sweet Sleep.Â 
Â 

Discuss!
2850	Newstar	2014-04-20	I was super attached to the poetic justice of Sansa using a "gem" from the hairnet to kill Littlefinger. Sad that the show seems to have ruled that out by disposing of the necklace.
Â 
Of course, if the giant prophecy does refer to Sansa killing Littlefinger, I dunno that poisoning would really fall under what I consider "slaying." Doesn't mean she won't kill Littlefinger or have a hand in it, just that it won't be through poison.
Â 
St. Tyrion of House Whitewashing
Â 
No lies detected.
Â 
I said over the review thread, but the way the actual escape was staged was just terrible, on a filming level.
Â 
Yeah. The cut from Tywin bellowing "No one leaves the capital" to Dontos and Sansa easily leaving the capital added an element of absurdity to the proceedings.
2851	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-20	Sansa will still kill LF, just not with the hairnet. No biggie there as far as I'm concerned. The act itself will be more important than the method anyway (and personally, I'd rather see her shove him out the Moon Door anyway.)
2852	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-20	Yeah, it is sad Sansa's escape was a moment the show would rather just have you accept, than when the show takes time to detail things so well like the filming of Olenna snatching the gem last week. Â This means it was an artistic executive decision, not that they were incapable of showing an elaborate Sansa getaway.
Â 
But oh well. I'm glad she's finally out and excited to see her story evolve from here.
2853	juanml82	2014-04-20	Yeah. The cut from Tywin bellowing "No one leaves the capital" to Dontos and Sansa easily leaving the capital added an element of absurdity to the proceedings.

I don't know. Tywin orders go as fast as riders can go and, in a city that big, it's likely that some point will be overseen. It's not like the Gold Cloaks are exactly exemplar city guards.
Â 
As for the necklace, it may or may not debunk the chekov's hairnet. After all, we didn't have a chain in season 2 and that didn't stop Tyrion from blowing up Stannis navy. If Sansa is scheduled to use the Strangler in the books, the show might resolve it in another fashion. Sweetsleep or some other medication can also do the job, or the conflict might be resolved otherwise.
2854	ohpooratlas	2014-04-20	I would much have Sansa kill Littlefinger with the sweet sleep than the hairnet anyway. That seems more like poetic justice to me.
Â 
The escape seemed rather rushed to me, but I was pleased with the scene with Littlefinger. I'm glad she's at least still challenging Littlefinger, at least in regards to killing Dontos.
Â 
Mostly, I'm just glad she's finally out of King's Landing. I kept saying "GO GIRL, GO!" the whole time during the escape.
2855	Colonel Green	2014-04-20	I don't know. Tywin orders go as fast as riders can go and, in a city that big, it's likely that some point will be overseen.


Sansa and Dontos were like fifteen meters away when Cersei started yelling about Sansa.Â  Where were all the perimeter guards?Â  Or any of the other guards who would normally stop Sansa from just running away?Â  Was that an option the whole time?
2856	El Guapo	2014-04-20	I am glad to see that Littlefinger is as creepy towards Sansa as ever.
2857	Mladen	2014-04-20	I am on board with this that it doesn't have to mean something, and that we might still see the poisoning of LF via hairnet. TBH, given that there is a wide range of ways to kill someone in Westeros, hairnet could simply be replaced, or this just means that the theory about specific way of killing LF is incorrect. There are arguments for both sides. After all, Jeyne Westerling is the proof that these are 2 universes...
Â 
On the other hand, the escape... I loved how they used Dubrovnik's streets (or as Genoas people would call it - viccoli) and I am so amaze with the screenshots made of those scenes. Sophie Turner looks amazing...
Â 
Â

Â 
This... I agree... I almost expected someone to say "she is next to me"  But given that in that scene everyone seemed so focused on Cersei and we could see people's back and them going to the center, one can assume that Sansa could have slipped. After all she did the same in the books. And in the books, she was even seen by Stokeworth family... IDK, I am torn between the hastiness of the scene which worked beautifully with Tywin and Cersei going nuclear and a bit naively done escape...Â 
Â 
Â

Â 
You can always count on LF to enter the creepy factor...
2858	FC_Lymond	2014-04-20	Maybe the easiness of the escape is to emphasize that the Starks could have pulled it off much, much earlier if they had actually tried?Â 
Â 
I wonder if the tides will carry that boat back to KL to provide evidence for the trial.

Guys, i think i need to just come right out and admit this detail.Â My sister-in-law had made lemon cake for easter sunday and we took some home with us. I nommed that shit while watching Sansa escape. It was so...satisfying.Â 
Â 
Dude, Sansa's all "wtf is this happy horseshit?" about the whole situation and i love how shes not all "Oh Littlefinger, my hero!" Shes just like "Greeeat. Lord Creepy McCreepin' has me now."
2860	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	I don't think the problem with Sansa in seasons 2 and 3 was the escape but the afterwards. Ok, she's outside KL. What else? Arya has been veeeeery lucky and in show, Ned kinda told Yoren to take care of her.
2861	Colonel Green	2014-04-20	You can always count on LF to enter the creepy factor...


My favourite Tumblr caption for that scene.
Â 
Cripes, though, she's so noticeably taller than him, especially with her hair like that.Â  I love Turner's height, but it really does kind of unbalance the way audiences typically read scenes on film, because normally height = command, but the only scene partner Sansa has ever had who is taller than her is the Hound, and she hardly had any scenes with him.Â  She towers over everybody else, even while they're the ones normally imposing on her.

Â 
Well, as I know, LF is shorter than Sansa, so the show producers did it perhaps right job with casting these two... I think that you are right... I doubt that any member of the cast, save perhaps Jaime and Brienne with Hound would be taller than her at this moment. It will be interesting to see how that develops. I am afraid that we are slowly coming to that point where the age starts to play the role.
2866	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-20	That Sansa is taller than Littlefinger amused me at first, but right now I feel like it might affect the story a bit. How on the earth will he forcefully kiss her (repeatedly) when he has to tiptoe?Â

Â 
Good point. She's taller than Cersei, Joffrey, and Littlefinger, and it certainly changes the dynamic in their scenes. (Less so Tyrion, since everyone towers over Tyrion.)
Â 
Book Sansa is tall, though. Not Brienne-tall, but tall.
Â 
Â 
Â 
BH, given that there is a wide range of ways to kill someone in Westeros, hairnet could simply be replaced, or this just means that the theory about specific way of killing LF is incorrect.
Â 
The latter is more likely. It would have been an easy thing for TV Sansa to keep the necklace, or even to leave Sansa wearing it in the boat scene and then never mention it again, and Littlefinger made a big elaborate show of tossing it out of Sansa's reach forever. That was a wink to the book readers if ever I saw one.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Hated LF in that scene. Man, he's getting pretty insufferable. They gave him lots of dialogue from the books and he still ruined it. Ugh.
Â 
Gillen's upped his creepy game; I could barely stand to see him touch Sophie Turner, let alone lean in close as if for a kiss. Oh, man, their scenes are going to be gutchurningly, skincrawlingly awful.

Harrr.
Yes im actually liking how freakishly tall Turner is precisely for this reason. She may be relatively helpless, but Sansa can tower and perhaps even learn some intimidation techniques!
2869	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-20	At least she could kill him with sweet sleep (she has access to it) or perhaps even go further by having him executed.Â
2870	ejhawman	2014-04-21	Odd thing here. I could have sworn the scene in the book mentioned Petyr throwing the necklace into the sea. Am I misremembering? Don't have a copy at hand...

Â 

*shudder*
Â 
I am not going to look forward to that, in either case. The whole LF/Sansa plotline after she gets out of KL creeps me out in a major way. I feel like she's gone out of the frying pan, into the fire. It's odd that I am more worried for her in his hands thanÂ I was when she was being physically abused by Joffrey's thugs.
2872	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-21	Its gonna be weird cuz Sansa looks like she could possibly suplex Littlefinger and hardly break a sweat. Shes huuuuuge. I want to see her go "No." and just loom over him with her Kubrick Stare.
2873	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-21	It would probably help the situation if she'd stop wearing high heels. I don't think she's taller than Aidan Gillan. I think the fact that she wears high heels is what's making her taller. Put her in some flats for God's sake.
2874	joachim	2014-04-21	Â 
Yeah. The cut from Tywin bellowing "No one leaves the capital" to Dontos and Sansa easily leaving the capital added an element of absurdity to the proceedings.


There was this movie with Russell Crowe called The Next Three Days in which he's trying to break his wife out of jail. In it, Liam Neeson tells him that Pittsburgh can be locked down in fifteen minutes. If we accept that King's Landing is at least the size of Pittsburgh, how fast could they do it without radios?
2875	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-21	I don't think the hairnet necessarily rules out future Sansa using poison. They'll just get it to her another way (through one of her possible allies maybe). I think they just didn't
2876	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-21	That Sansa is taller than Littlefinger amused me at first, but right now I feel like it might affect the story a bit. How on the earth will he forcefully kiss her (repeatedly) when he has to tiptoe?Â 


Â 
During the pigeon pie scene I noticed that Sansa is even taller than new Tommen (who just as his brother, is tall for his age) and Cersei, and about the same height as Tywin. I suspect this is the reason why Sansa never had a scene with Brienne, as the maid of Tarth wouldn't look as tall compared to the little bird.
Â 
I was bummed by LF telling Sansa 'I had this made last week', and that nobody mentioned the amethysts from Asshai, I personally love the Asshai name drooping in the books for all things magical.

Â 
I googled Turner's and Gillen's height and they are of the same height: 175cm. I am not sure that heels are the issue here, but the hair. That, God knows what's its name, thing on top of her head gives her another 5 cm...

2880	ser benjamin	2014-04-21	It makes sense to me that the hairnet/necklace would be gone.Â 
considering the mastermind, I would think that only one gem in the whole hairnet/necklace was dosed. Â That way, even if suspicion fell on the accessory, there would be no proof, other than a missing stone.... which is probably common. Â

Â 
with the necklace it could very easily be just one gem since it's easy to identify but with a hairnet, it had to be many or all of them because it would be too hard for olenna to remember which one was the "special" one.Â
2882	Fool of a Book	2014-04-21	After LF smashed the stone, there were some chunks and debris left on the rail. Â I could see a scene with a sad Sansa staring out at the sea and noticing it, putting things together in her head, then gathering some up. Â As evidence or for other reasons...
Â 
It still isn't crystal clear (to the unsullied) that the necklace was the source of the poison. Â Maybe they need to make it more obvious by having Sansa figure it out.
Â 
A stretch, I know, but it was so obvious the Petyr didn't swipe the debris off the rail.
Â 
ETA it could also fall down onto the deck and be noticed there instead.

2883	jons nissa	2014-04-21	That Sansa is taller than Littlefinger amused me at first, but right now I feel like it might affect the story a bit. How on the earth will he forcefully kiss her (repeatedly) when he has to tiptoe?Â 


Â 
probably because, other than the kiss in the snow, he doesn't forcefully kiss her. his kisses may be unwelcome but he isn't being forceful about it as much as cajoling them out of her. "that's not how you kiss your father" type of stuff isn't forceful. it's never been about any threat of force but rather other, more subtle implied threats to both of them, false promises and outright lies.
Â 
besides, according to an interview with aiden, it will be more fatherly or uncle-ly. that might mean all the kisses are out. hard to say.
2884	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-21	Its gonna be weird cuz Sansa looks like she could possibly suplex Littlefinger and hardly break a sweat. Shes huuuuuge. I want to see her go "No." and just loom over him with her Kubrick Stare.


Â 
The poison-bearing jewelry is no more in this continuity.Â  Sansa's going to have to suplex him.
Â 
And they're not moving down-mountain for the winter, probably, to both save on set design costs and because that trip is pretty dull without Mya Stone existing anyway (and they cut Cat's ascent back in season 1, so we don't have the symmetry/resonance of doing it again in the other direction).
Â 
Ergo, Sansa Suplexes Littlefinger Through The Moon Door.Â  It will be so ridiculous, it will instantly become my favorite scene in the history of television.
2885	Hoo	2014-04-21	I just cannot imagine Sansa killing anyone. Â Now, that would be a character departure as far as the movie goes.

Â 
I would disagree on this. When in Gates of the Moon LF kissed Sansa, it was not cajoling but blunt force:
Â 
He pulled her closer, caught her face between his hands, and kissed her on the lips for a long time.
Â 
There is obvious force on her in this... He doe cajoling her in different occasions, but when we speak of his kisses, they are indeed forceful, pushing her boundaries of tolerance but by bit with every kiss.Â

Â 
it might be the language constraints because there is nothing to imply force in that scene:
Â 

She knew better than to ask what sort of tales. If Petyr had wanted her to know, he would have told her. â<U+0080><U+009C>I did not expect you back so soon,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said. â<U+0080><U+009C>I am glad youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve come.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>I would never have known it from the kiss you gave me.â<U+0080><U+009D> He pulled her closer, caught her face between his hands, and kissed her on the lips for a long time. â<U+0080><U+009C>Now thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the sort of kiss that says welcome home. See that you do better next time.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes, Father.â<U+0080><U+009D> She could feel herself blushing.

discomfort about the situation, which i've said, but not force. and yes, he is pushing the boundaries. that's his strategy with her, not forcing her.
2890	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-21	I like the hairnet theory and it can still happen that way in the books, whereas she uses some other poison in the show. This wouldn't even be close the the largest variance between the two mediums and it's somewhat understandable given the need to emphasize the point for the show. After all, it should beg the question for show-watchers... What was the point of Littlefinger having the necklace crafted?
I don't agree so much on the Sansa agency focus that these threads represent. It is admittedly somewhat different in the show but her agency was always subtle (to me) in the books and (imo) largely overstated on these forums. I view show Sansa as largely unchanged. Many disagree and that's fine.
2891	El Guapo	2014-04-21	Â 
I think that Aiden is trolling the crap out of everyone in those interviews.Â 


Â 
He was absolutely trolling as the very first scene we have him this year he was totally creeping on Sansa and invading her personal space.Â
2892	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	Just because HBO smashed the necklace/hairnet doesn't mean that Sansa won't use it to kill Littlefinger in the book. HBO has killed characters GRRM asked them not to kill because they still had upcoming roles.
Â 
Personally, I'd prefer for her to have him pushed out the Moon Door.
2893	Colonel Green	2014-04-21	And they're not moving down-mountain for the winter, probably, to both save on set design costs and because that trip is pretty dull without Mya Stone existing anyway (and they cut Cat's ascent back in season 1, so we don't have the symmetry/resonance of doing it again in the other direction).


I think the trip down the mountain is important because it fundamentally changes the circumstances Sansa's in (i.e., there's way more people around).Â  And since the show tore down the Eyrie's high hall set after this season, I think that indicates they can be very sure there's no further need for it.
2894	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-21	Ooh, I've missed out on this Sansa poisoning LF theory.
Â 
I wasn't under the impression she really hated him that much. He did save her life and is teaching her a lot about how to survive. She is developing under his tutelage into an interesting character.
Â 
I haven't really been made to dislike him enough to want him dead. He hasn't done anything that has really been disastrous for the realm, unlike most every other character.
2895	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-21	Hasn't he? Egging on this conflagration? And how do you think Sansa will react once she learns of LF's role in betraying her father?
I'm torn about her future. She's one of the few characters who maintains her moral center throughout the series. Whatever happens to her, she stays good. I know people think she becomes interesting learning from LF but I honestly worry for her. 
Arya's already slipping. LF's tutelage shouldn't do that to Sansa, I hope.
2896	tosteel	2014-04-21	(Long time lurker delurking here) I agree with whoever said that making a big deal out of destroying the necklace was a deliberate nod to book readers. Sure Sansa still has a way to poison LF, but I am getting more and more convinced that I am guilty of reading what I want to happen in Sansa's arc, rather than what is happening.
Â 
This is a bit of an aside, but I can't imagine how confusing that necklace scene must have been for someone who hasn't read the books. I mean, I had to rewatch the scene where the QoT takes out the last gem a few times to be sure of it. To non-book readers the whole thing would just look kind of random.

I got the chance to grill my Unsullied brother in law yesterday (he's obsessed with the show, but can barely get through Book 1).
Â 
He guessed Dontos or Sansa. Â All I said was "what happened between them before the wedding?" and he mentioned the necklace, but still didn't put it together. Â I suppose he has more info after last night.
Â 
Point is, it's not obvious to the Unsullied. Â Even after LF talks about the necklace (according to my brother, another Unsullied), it's still not obvious, especially because Tywin seems so happy with the turn of events. Â Not a single Unsullied I've spoken to has caught the QoT mussing with Sansa's necklace.
Â 
I think they'll need to make it more obvious in the next epi or 2.
Â 
ETA as I said earlier, LF left chucks of the stone on the railing. Â Sansa could still find them (on rail or deck), and the Unsullied could see Sansa working out what happened. Â She could still save some shards.

Â 
Hm. Well, the Eyrie post-ASOS scenes don't really need to take place in the high hall, so I guess it makes sense that they would do that.
2899	Lady Arya's Song	2014-04-21	I could be far off but way back in AGoT in the books during the tourney feast, Sansa is sitting next to Joffrey and eating. I am one of those readers that believes that GRRM has laced these books with hints and symbols and lemon cakes are associated with Sansa.Â  At the tourney Sansa ateÂ  two lemon cakes and was contemplating eating a third one despite feeling full.Â  There is a reason GRRM is writing this little point!
Â 
However we also have a quick little discussion between Jon Snow and Jeor Mormont on their trip to Crasters where Jeor M makes comments about lemons and pie and poison.Â  More hints!!
Â 
The hairnet was used to poison somebody for sure but what has always worried me more is the fact that Sansa and Sweet Robin had a discussion about how many lemon cakes Sweet Robin can have at the feast and LF is telling Sansa that he plans on SR to not be around much longer.
Â 
My worry is that LF will poison SR with a lemon cake and once again Sansa will be implicated..or LF will try to poison SR and Sansa might even become ill somehow by accidentally eating a laced lemon cake herself.Â  I noticed that Tyrion looked at Sansa during the PW and thinks to himself how she looks deathly pale.Â Â  All in all I am worried about lemon cakes, poison, LF manipulations and Sansa being fingered for his death or something happening but lemon cakes might be our clue. Â  Also I always hoped Sansa would save the hairnet..not to use against LF but that in the future that hairnet might somehow prove her words against LF once she realizes he was behind everything bad that has happened to her family.
2900	Annara Snow	2014-04-21	I never knew about the hairnet theory and I never thought it was important in anything but Joffrey's murder. And having Sansa use it to poison LF is, to be honest, pretty cheesy. Why would anyone even be keeping this thing after it was used that way?
Â 


My favourite Tumblr caption for that scene.
Â 
Cripes, though, she's so noticeably taller than him, especially with her hair like that.Â  I love Turner's height, but it really does kind of unbalance the way audiences typically read scenes on film, because normally height = command, but the only scene partner Sansa has ever had who is taller than her is the Hound, and she hardly had any scenes with him.Â  She towers over everybody else, even while they're the ones normally imposing on her.


Â 
That's great then, since "height = command" is absolute nonsense. People don't have power because they're tall - except in schoolyard or, somewhat, in battle - but because they have social and political power. (Not that Sansa is likely to even be physically stronger than men who are around her height.) The Hound is huge and intimidating, and for almost all of the first 2 seasons was being ordered around by Joffrey. Same thing with every other KG member and everyone else. It's not like Joffrey had power because he was physically imposing. Tyrion is a dwarf and shorter than all of the adults we've seen him with, but being a Lannister gave him considerable power over everyone but the members of his family, and when he was the Hand of the King, he was equally powerful as Cersei and Joffrey (also not incredibly big or muscular people) and was the only one who was able to stop Joffrey's abuse of Sansa sometimes, since he was only one of the two people in KL who could stop Joffrey and not expect to get punished for it (and the other one, Cersei, didn't care to do that).
Â 
Even the Mountain does what Tywin orders him to do.

Yer missing the point of the theory. The point is that Littlefinger drops his guard so much cuz Sansa ropes him into thinking shes a really stupid little girl and empty headed and going along with his crap, only to have him fall for the hoist by his own petard. Which wouldnt be cheesy at all but a nice "neeeneeer" moment. In Soviet Westeros, Sansa kicks YOU!

He doesn't know she has the hairnet. She was meant to leave it with the clothing when she changed in the Godswood.Â 
Â 
It may still come into play in the books. If she is going to poison LF in the show, they will just create a filler scene to explain how she gets more poison.Â
2905	juanml82	2014-04-21	I just cannot imagine Sansa killing anyone. Â Now, that would be a character departure as far as the movie goes.


She was about to throw Joffrey off the battlements in AGOT/Season 1, so I disagree.

Sansa doesn't hate him. Future events and revelations might make her hate her but, even if it doesn't happen, LF's continued existence will be detrimental for Sansa. She might graduate from "Littlefinger's Courtly Intrigue Academy" by murdering him not out of spite but out of cold blooded convenience.
Â 


Hasn't he? Egging on this conflagration? And how do you think Sansa will react once she learns of LF's role in betraying her father?

Height=command is nonsense in real life. In movies, height and camera angles tend to refer to the character's power. If you want, you can check Tyrion' power wielding scenes. You will probably notice that the camera is either at his height or at an angle parallel to the ground instead of being at the height of a normal person and aiming at Tyrion looking down at him.
Â 
Now, you can continue to argue "but in real life", but you would be arguing against well established photography and movie theory.

I think it helps underscore Littlefinger's unworthiness: he is a small man trying to get into bed with a tall princess. A woman he would have no chance of getting with if she was free.
2907	sastelise	2014-04-22	I was happy to see TV Sansa taking on a more distrusting toneÂ with LF than she had with other characters in the series. Maybe this means her character will finally start to evolve a bit more in the show. I'm not keen on Sansa poisoning LF, unless it's in small doses, the way he's been doing with sweet robin.

2912	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-22	I actually fucking LOVED the escape sequence, the music, Tywin & Cersei screaming to find her! It was fucking great, in my opinion.Â
2913	voodooqueen126	2014-04-22	I think they have made TV Sansa a lot dumber than book Sansa: book Sansa would never have spoken so openly to Tyrion or Shae, would never have said something stupid like 'will my family be at my wedding', likewise tv Sansa, rather than hiding the hairnet/necklace in her coat, simply allows Petyr to take them off her, nor has she yet figured out that Petyr had a hand in Joffrey's death (despite his pretty obvious hints).
This is not to deny that book Sansa didn't make some tremendously poor decision/demonstrate bad judgement, for example in telling Dontos about the Willas plot.
But TV Sansa is an utter ninny.
Â 
Also I am sad they made her irreligious: I think religion can be quite useful to women if they manage it correctly. See Margaret Beaufort (who was tremendously religious in real life) and how her religiosity Â in White Queen enabled her to do Â monstrous things.

No, it's new for you. Now go back to the stuff I actually wrote and try to find the word "impossible" somewhere. As for Sophie Turner's genital, you were the one who immediately brought forward her gender when changing the subject to Tyrion.

Â 
My Ideal situation is that as LittleFinger teaches her and guides her in manipulation and understanding people she slowly turns others against him. Â Littlefinger's MO is that, as a person's moment of triumph he turns the table (Ned with the Gold Cloaks, Joff at the Wedding). Â I want her to beat him at his own game but be better than him. Â I don't want Sansa getting her hands dirty, she's her father's daughter, I want the moment when Littlefinger helps her get to power and then she immediately orders the guards to seize him. I want him dragged from the hall screaming while she picks up a Lemon cake and eats the fuck out of it.



This would be absolutely fantastic. Kudos to you.
Â 
I will like my "suplex through the moon door" best, but Eats The Fuck Out Of A Lemoncake is almost as good and has the bonus value of actually being plausible.
2921	Dany's Silver	2014-04-23	Â The poison-bearing jewelry is no more in this continuity.Â  Sansa's going to have to suplex him.Â And they're not moving down-mountain for the winter, probably, to both save on set design costs and because that trip is pretty dull without Mya Stone existing anyway (and they cut Cat's ascent back in season 1, so we don't have the symmetry/resonance of doing it again in the other direction).Â Ergo, Sansa Suplexes Littlefinger Through The Moon Door.Â  It will be so ridiculous, it will instantly become my favorite scene in the history of television.I think the trip down the mountain is important because it fundamentally changes the circumstances Sansa's in (i.e., there's way more people around).Â  And since the show tore down the Eyrie's high hall set after this season, I think that indicates they can be very sure there's no further need for it.Â They'll definitely have to leave the Eyrie, so that Sansa and LF can continue their interactions with the rest of the Vale lords and ladies (and whatever else they get up to in TWOW).Â  There is snow in AFFC before they leave the Eyrie (remember that Sansa crafts a Winterfell out of snow, which leads to her tearing the head off AnnoyingRobin's "giant"?).Â Â Agreed. "Avuncular," my ass.Â Hm. Well, the Eyrie post-ASOS scenes don't really need to take place in the high hall, so I guess it makes sense that they would do that.Â When I read that interview with AG, all I could hear was Chris Rock saying that everyone has got that one molester uncle!Â LOL!!!Â Yer missing the point of the theory. The point is that Littlefinger drops his guard so much cuz Sansa ropes him into thinking shes a really stupid little girl and empty headed and going along with his crap, only to have him fall for the hoist by his own petard. Which wouldnt be cheesy at all but a nice "neeeneeer" moment. In Soviet Westeros, Sansa kicks YOU!
2922	cocoalover1956	2014-04-23	I think they have made TV Sansa a lot dumber than book Sansa: book Sansa would never have spoken so openly to Tyrion or Shae, would never have said something stupid like 'will my family be at my wedding', likewise tv Sansa, rather than hiding the hairnet/necklace in her coat, simply allows Petyr to take them off her, nor has she yet figured out that Petyr had a hand in Joffrey's death (despite his pretty obvious hints).
This is not to deny that book Sansa didn't make some tremendously poor decision/demonstrate bad judgement, for example in telling Dontos about the Willas plot.
But TV Sansa is an utter ninny.
Â 
Also I am sad they made her irreligious: I think religion can be quite useful to women if they manage it correctly. See Margaret Beaufort (who was tremendously religious in real life) and how her religiosity Â in White Queen enabled her to do Â monstrous things.


Â 
Yeah, though I part of it is because most of her thought are difficult to translate on screen, so they have to make her say things aloud.Â 
Â 
One of favorite things about book!Sansa was her faith, so yeah I wasn't happy with the change either. It looked like she gaving up, but one of the strong points of Sansa's character is that she always had hope and kept enduring. The show made her a weaker character imo.Â

Hope? She believes she has to stay at the Eyre because she has nowhere else to go (and, as far as she knows, she's pretty much right, save for maybe Skagos). That's the thought of someone who has given up - with good reason I'd say.
2924	Grail King	2014-04-23	Just started reading this thread, 3 days to read the rape and necklace thread, when I saw the crystals get broken and pushed onto Dontos I thought Sansa's gonna get taken back to KL and she may still have the hairnet in her cloak making her guilty in KL eyes.
Â 
I was one who always felt that she doesn't need to kill him, but be the slayer of his lies and schemes and brake him that way and take from him all his hopes and dreams. Â

Â 
How is she not religious on the show? They showed her singing a hymn in the Blackwater episode of season 2. They showed her praying at the godswood in both season 3 and season 4. Yes, I know in the season premiere she tells Tyrion that she just goes to the godswood not to pray but because nobody talks to her there but then what do show her actually doing at the godswood later that episode? Praying.

Â 
Well, that's what I would like to: Sansa to use the rule of law against Littlefinger after a deadly game of cat and mouse. But I will settle for Littlefinger being poisoned.
I actually think that to a certain extent GRRM but to a greater extent DB&BW don't get what a powerful and good thing the rule of law is. Well especially the directors, I think this is why Stannis comes across so poorly in the show; the director's just don't like that ISTJ/Lawful Neutral mindset, and are inclined to see it as lawful bad. Shrugs.

You have a point there. Â But book Sansa used her religion more subtly: by claiming to be genuinely pious she was able to meet with Dontos in the Godswood, as well as alienate Tyrion without directly offending him. So rather than more or less saying "I am not going to the Godswood to pray, I just want you to shut up", she tells him that he would find it boring, which cuts him off (and let's her meet Dontos) but doesn't give him an excuse to have her beaten.
2928	Tywin Manderly	2014-04-24	That Sansa is taller than Littlefinger amused me at first, but right now I feel like it might affect the story a bit. How on the earth will he forcefully kiss her (repeatedly) when he has to tiptoe?Â 


Â 
Littlefinger can pull Sansa towards him and hold her tight.
Â 


There was this movie with Russell Crowe called The Next Three Days in which he's trying to break his wife out of jail. In it, Liam Neeson tells him that Pittsburgh can be locked down in fifteen minutes. If we accept that King's Landing is at least the size of Pittsburgh, how fast could they do it without radios?


Â 
Flag signals, fire signals, drum signals, gong signals, war horns, etc.Â 
Â 


Â 
hmmmm. you and i definitely have a very different impression of sansa if you see her taking off littlefinger's head with a sword.


Â 
I would love to see Sansa stab Littlefinger through his black heart with a dagger.Â

Â 
in another thread there was a similar post about killing him politically. i really like that idea and really, really think it's more in line with sansa and her arc than chopping his head off or pushing him out the moon door, even if she was going to push joffrey off the that bridge.

Ok. I am still laughing at this.
Â
2931	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-25	I know what Chekov's gun is, but what is Chekov's hairnet?
Â 
The idea that every jewel in Sansa's purple necklace contains poison seems a bit silly to me.
2932	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-25	I'd like Sansa to turn the tables on and then kill LF as much as anybody, but we have her POV in the books, and she doesn't even think negative thoughts about him. Much to my disappointment upon reading, I might add.
2933	Colonel Green	2014-04-25	The idea that every jewel in Sansa's purple necklace contains poison seems a bit silly to me.
A lot of this hinges on exactly what the hairnet looks like, but it's a huge risk for only one to be poison, given the number of ways she might put it on.

Â 
She thinks many negative thoughts about him.Â  I don't know which books you were reading.
Â 
AGOT, Sansa II, their first meeting:
Â 
When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, with a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. â<U+0080><U+009C>You must be one of her daughters,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. â<U+0080><U+009C>You have the Tully look.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m Sansa Stark,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said, ill at ease. The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar, fastened with a silver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know him. â<U+0080><U+009C>I have not had the honor, my lord.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Septa Mordane quickly took a hand. â<U+0080><U+009C>Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s small council.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
AGOT, Sansa V:
Sansa seated herself beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not make her feel any less anxious. Varys was wringing his soft hands together, Grand Maester Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him, but she could feel Littlefinger staring. Something about the way the small man looked at her made Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on. Goose bumps pimpled her skin.
Â 
ASOS, Sansa VII:
Â 
Sansa tried to step back, but he pulled her into his arms and suddenly he was kissing her. Feebly, she tried to squirm, but only succeeded in pressing herself more tightly against him. His mouth was on hers, swallowing her words. He tasted of mint. For half a heartbeat she yielded to his kiss... before she turned her face away and wrenched free. â<U+0080><U+009C>What are you doing?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Petyr straightened his cloak. â<U+0080><U+009C>Kissing a snow maid.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to kiss her.â<U+0080><U+009D> Sansa glanced up at Lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s balcony, but it was empty now. â<U+0080><U+009C>Your lady wife.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>I do. Lysa has no cause for complaint.â<U+0080><U+009D> He smiled. â<U+0080><U+009C>I wish you could see yourself, my lady. You are so beautiful. Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re crusted over with snow like some little bear cub, but your face is flushed and you can scarcely breathe. How long have you been out here? You must be very cold. Let me warm you, Sansa. Take off those gloves, give me your hands.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>I wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.â<U+0080><U+009D> He sounded almost like Marillion, the night heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d gotten so drunk at the wedding. Only this time Lothor Brune would not appear to save her; Ser Lothor was Petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s man. â<U+0080><U+009C>You shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kiss me. I might have been your own daughter...â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
I would say that thinking of him as a rapist constitutes "negative" thoughts...
Â 
I will tell my aunt that I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to marry Robert. Not even the High Septon himself could declare a woman married if she refused to say the vows. She wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a beggar, no matter what her aunt said. She was thirteen, a woman flowered and wed, the heir to Winterfell. Sansa felt sorry for her little cousin sometimes, but she could not imagine ever wanting to be his wife. I would sooner be married to Tyrion again. If Lady Lysa knew that, surely sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>d send her away... away from Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pouts and shakes and runny eyes, away from Marillionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lingering looks, away from Petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kisses. I will tell her. I will!
Â 
AFFC, Sansa I:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>And this lie may spare us. Else you and I must leave the Eyrie by the same door Lysa used.â<U+0080><U+009D> Petyr picked up his quill again. â<U+0080><U+009C>We shall serve him lies and Arbor gold, and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll drink them down and ask for more, I promise you.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
He is serving me lies as well, Sansa realized. They were comforting lies, though, and she thought them kindly meant. A lie is not so bad if it is kindly meant. If only she believed them...
Â 
The things her aunt had said just before she fell still troubled Sansa greatly. â<U+0080><U+009C>Ravings,â<U+0080><U+009D> Petyr called them. â<U+0080><U+009C>My wife was mad, you saw that for yourself.â<U+0080><U+009D> And so she had. All I did was build a snow castle, and she meant to push me out the Moon Door. Petyr saved me. He loved my mother well, and...
Â 
And her? How could she doubt it? He had saved her.
Â 
He saved Alayne, his daughter, a voice within her whispered. But she was Sansa too... and sometimes it seemed to her that the Lord Protector was two people as well. He was Petyr, her protector, warm and funny and gentle... but he was also Littlefinger, the lord sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>d known at Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, smiling slyly and stroking his beard as he whispered in Queen Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ear. And Littlefinger was no friend of hers. When Joff had her beaten, the Imp defended her, not Littlefinger. When the mob sought to rape her, the Hound carried her to safety, not Littlefinger. When the Lannisters wed her to Tyrion against her will, Ser Garlan the Gallant gave her comfort, not Littlefinger. Littlefinger never lifted so much as his little finger for her.
Â 
Except to get me out. He did that for me. I thought it was Ser Dontos, my poor old drunken Florian, but it was Petyr all the while. Littlefinger was only a mask he had to wear. Only sometimes Sansa found it hard to tell where the man ended and the mask began. Littlefinger and Lord Petyr looked so very much alike. She would have fled them both, perhaps, but there was nowhere for her to go. Winterfell was burned and desolate, Bran and Rickon dead and cold. Robb had been betrayed and murdered at the Twins, along with their lady mother. Tyrion had been put to death for killing Joffrey, and if she ever returned to Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing the queen would have her head as well. The aunt sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>d hoped would keep her safe had tried to murder her instead. Her uncle Edmure was a captive of the Freys, while her great-uncle the Blackfish was under siege at Riverrun. I have no place but here, Sansa thought miserably, and no true friend but Petyr.
Â 
AFFC, Alayne I:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Father,â<U+0080><U+009D> Alayne asked when he was gone, â<U+0080><U+009C>will you have a bowl of porridge to break your fast?â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>I despise porridge.â<U+0080><U+009D> He looked at her with Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes. â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d sooner break my fast with a kiss.â<U+0080><U+009D>
A true daughter would not refuse her sire a kiss, so Alayne went to him and kissed him, a quick dry peck upon the cheek, and just as quickly stepped away.
â<U+0080><U+009C>How... dutiful.â<U+0080><U+009D> Littlefinger smiled with his mouth, but not his eyes.
Â 
AFFC, Alayne II:
Â 
Lady Myranda must have heard her thoughts. â<U+0080><U+009C>You do turn such a pretty shade of pink. When I blush I look quite like an apple. I have not blushed for years, though.â<U+0080><U+009D> She leaned closer. â<U+0080><U+009C>Does your father plan to wed again?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>My father?â<U+0080><U+009D> Alayne had never considered that. Somehow the notion made her squirm. She found herself remembering the look on Lysa Arrynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s face as sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>d tumbled through the Moon Door.

2935	sastelise	2014-04-25	These thoughts hardly reveal someone who is developing into a killer or even a shrewd diplomat. If LF does get killed, it won't be Sansa's idea. I doubt she'll even be involved, except maybe by accident. (Hence the resurrection of Catelyn, who I think will play a role in LF's demise). As much as I want it to be otherwise,Â  the text can be read just as carefully and yield the opposite interpretation to that which is typically outlined on theÂ ptp forums.Â

Â 
Did I say that she's developing into a killer or a diplomat? The poster above claimed that she had no "negative thoughts" about LF. These thoughts reveal that she does have lots of negative thoughts about LF and doesn't really trust him - she's basically trying to trust him because she thinks he's her only option at the moment and doesn't have anyone else to turn to.

You're deluding yourself and you know it. Sansa, in an exemplary use of her heavily damaged cognitive skills, have separated Baelish into "Petyr" and "Littlefinger", the former her savior and the later the evil mask he has to wear (her thoughts exactly).
Â 
And, as her story progresses, she thinks more and more of Baelish as "Petyr" and less as "Littlefinger". In her last chapter, she only thinks of him as "Petyr", she thinks the Eyre is a worse place now that he's gone, he believes him brave and she seems positively happy to see him after the descend from the Eyre. As for "Somehow the notion made her squirm", that might actually mean she's jealous and she doesn't even understand why. And even if you want to argue that, the progression of her link towards Littlefinger is crystal clear.

For the record, my desire is to see Sansa pulling a Castamere on the Freys, including sacrificing Lord Walder to the Old Gods herself, and getting her hands all dirty and messy with the blood and guts as it befits a Stark of Winterfell. Bonus points if it includes making a Via Apia of Freys along the Kingsroad*.
Â 
And, if anything, your need to call names instead of being able to answer with quotes from the novels proves my point more than anything. You, and all the lemoncakes who accuse other people of not reading the books, should get off your high horse and reread the actual books instead of each other posts. From the text you actually quoted:
Â 

Â 
and sometimes it seemed to her that the Lord Protector was two people as well. He was Petyr, her protector, warm and funny and gentle...
Â 

How does she call Baelish during her last chapter? Oh, yes, she calls him Petyr.
Â 
Fit that, and these quotes, into the Sansaverse if you can before telling people they aren't reading the books
Â 
Even before the guards and serving men had made their descent, the castle had seemed as empty as a tomb, and more so when Petyr Baelish was away.
Â 

Â 
And yet the thought of leaving frightened her almost as much as it frightened Robert. She only hid it better. Her father said there was no shame in being afraid, only in showing your fear. â<U+0080><U+009C>All men live with fear,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said. Alayne was not certain she believed that. Nothing frightened Petyr Baelish. He only said that to make me brave.
Â 

Â 
And this playful banter with a man she, according to the Sansaverse, hates
Â 
Nor did Petyr choose to explain. Instead, he smiled and said, â<U+0080><U+009C>I have brought my sweet girl back a gift.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Alayne was as pleased as she was surprised. â<U+0080><U+009C>Is it a gown?â<U+0080><U+009D> She had heard there were fine seamstresses in Gulltown, and she was so tired of dressing drably.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Something better. Guess again.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Jewels?â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>No jewels could hope to match my daughterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Lemons? Did you find some lemons?â<U+0080><U+009D> She had promised Sweetrobin lemon cake, and for lemon cake you needed lemons.

Â 
*Now I guess people in this open minded forum will believe I'm a real life supported of mass killings. Sigh...
2940	Annara Snow	2014-04-26	For the record, my desire is to see Sansa pulling a Castamere on the Freys, including sacrificing Lord Walder to the Old Gods herself, and getting her hands all dirty and messy with the blood and guts as it befits a Stark of Winterfell. Bonus points if it includes making a Via Apia of Freys along the Kingsroad*.
Â 
And, if anything, your need to call names instead of being able to answer with quotes from the novels proves my point more than anything. You, and all the lemoncakes who accuse other people of not reading the books, should get off your high horse and reread the actual books instead of each other posts. From the text you actually quoted:
Â 
How does she call Baelish during her last chapter? Oh, yes, she calls him Petyr.
Â 
Fit that, and these quotes, into the Sansaverse if you can before telling people they aren't reading the books
Â 
Â 
Â 
And this playful banter with a man she, according to the Sansaverse, hates
Â 
Â 
*Now I guess people in this open minded forum will believe I'm a real life supported of mass killings. Sigh...


Â 
Who says she hates him? Great, let's bring in the Straw Men.
Â 
I said all I had on the matter in my post with the quotes. How about trying to actually read it, and actually read those quotes? Someone claimed that she has no negative thoughts about LF. Actually, she has plenty, and as seen in the actual quotes, she doesn't really trust him and she definitely states that she'd love to be far away from him, free from "both of them", Littlefinger the politician and the "kind, friendly" Petyr, but she thinks she has no other choice, nowhere to go and no one else to turn to, and she's miserable about it.
Â 
Most of the time, she is trying to think about him as her "father", because she's trying to think of herself as Alayne. As for "playful banter", uh, how do you expect her to talk to her "father"? Confronting him in the snow castle scene didn't get her anywhere.
Â 
She doesn't hate LF but she doesn't trust him and she doesn't really like him, either - she just has no choice but to try to play her role to the best of her abilities. There is a mix of "positive" and 'negative" - but the only real positive things she thinks about him that are unrelated to trying to to pretend he is her father is that he is "bold" and that she would like to have his "courage" when it comes to ruthlessly manipulating people: she may not be drawn to him personally, but she does see the appeal of his methods.
Â 
So while the moral corruption (wanting to be able to be as ruthlessly manipulative as he is, and seeing it as "courage") is a very real danger for Sansa - and one that most of her fans are aware of - the idea that this goes with great trust and liking for the guy is simply not true.
Â 
And even those who see her feelings for him as more 'positive' than negative can't argue that she feels any sort of romantic or sexual attraction to him. The text is clear on this - there's no attraction there at all (and there's also plenty of opportunity to compare Sansa's feelings, or the lack of them, about LF's sexual advances, to her thoughts and feelings about someone she is actually attracted to, i.e. Sandor). Mentioning Sansa's thoughts about "Petyr" as her "father" as evidences of possible attraction - well, you don't see the problem there? I don't think that Sansa is a Craster in reverse and that she thinks that a Father figure is someone you want to fuck.
Â 
As for your ludicrous arguments that Sansa squirming about the idea of LF getting married because she remembers that he murdered his previous wife, her aunt, is a sign that she's into him and "jealous", I have nothing to say about this but  or *facepalm*. Seriously, even you must be aware that it's utter nonsense. As someone said on the thread where you first made it: Don't stretch yourself so much, you'll get a strain.

2941	Mladen	2014-04-26	And, as her story progresses, she thinks more and more of Baelish as "Petyr" and less as "Littlefinger". In her last chapter, she only thinks of him as "Petyr", she thinks the Eyre is a worse place now that he's gone, he believes him brave and she seems positively happy to see him after the descend from the Eyre. As for "Somehow the notion made her squirm", that might actually mean she's jealous and she doesn't even understand why. And even if you want to argue that, the progression of her link towards Littlefinger is crystal clear.


Â 
I have said this before and I say this again. The idea that Sansa is jealous is complete and utter nonsense. Not just that, it is one of the silliest ideas ever and I put this in the same basket as Ned and Lyanna are Jon's parents. Aegon is Hodor or any other trollish activity these days. Annara had tackled this issue, and I see truly no reason why anyone would continue posting this crazy idea all over the board when it is more than absolutely clear that it is not true. Oh, wait... I forgot the troll factor.
Â 
So, the idea that Sansa has some deep romantic and sexual feelings for LF has been disputed many times, but not by me, PTP or Annara, but GRRM himself and everything that is written in ASOIAF. I wouldn't mind if we talk about Sansa being more open to him, but certainly not in the way you suggest. You bury your own argument with this nonsensical statement.
Â 
Â 


I know what Chekov's gun is, but what is Chekov's hairnet?
Â 
The idea that every jewel in Sansa's purple necklace contains poison seems a bit silly to me.


Â 
The thing is how would Olenna distinguish poison jewel from the regular one. . She wouldn't be able to do that as quickly as she did, if the hairnet contained only one poisonous jewel. So, the logic dictates that all jewels were poisoned, and Olenna grabbed the first one she got her hands on.
2942	Le Cygne	2014-04-26	This always seemed rather relevant, she thinks the Hound is coming to rescue her, "It was Lothor Brune's voice, she realized. Not the Hound's, no, how could it be? Of course it had to be Lothor." So then she compares Bronze Yohn to the Hound (he "stood as tall as the Hound") and she thinks of herself as Sansa ("His seamed and solemn face brought back all of Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s memories of his time at Winterfell") and next thing you know:Â She considered throwing herself at his feet to beg for his protection.Now, if she's so down with chilling with Littlefinger, why on earth is she wanting someone to protect her from him?(And I think he knows it's her, too, but that's another story, or another book...)

Sansa separates Petyr Baelish into two different people: "Petyr", who is, in her own thoughts, her saviour, and "Littlefinger", who's the receptacle of everything that's wrong with Baelish. And, in her last chapter, she only refers to Baelish as "Petyr", misses him and acts genuinely happy to see him.
Â 


This always seemed rather relevant, she thinks the Hound is coming to rescue her, "It was Lothor Brune's voice, she realized. Not the Hound's, no, how could it be? Of course it had to be Lothor."

Â 
Now, if she's so down with chilling with Littlefinger, why on earth is she wanting someone to protect her from him?
(And I think he knows it's her, too, but that's another story, or another book...)


And then, when she meets Yohn Royce's niece, she tries to make sure she doesn't suspect anything. As if there is a progression in Sansa's storyline towards getting more and more cozy with Littlefinger.

And, in her last chapter, she only refers to Baelish as "Petyr", misses him and acts genuinely happy to see him.


Â 
There's one moment when she wishes LF was there - this:
Â 
They dare not let the full extent of Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s frailty and cowardice become too widely known, her father had warned her. I wish he were here. He would know what to do.
Â 
Petyr Baelish was clear across the Vale, though, attending Lord Lyonel Corbray at his wedding. A widower of forty-odd years, and childless, Lord Lyonel was to wed the strapping sixteen-year-old daughter of a rich Gulltown merchant. Petyr had brokered the match himself. The brideâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dower was said to be staggering; it had to be, since she was of common birth. Corbrayâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vassals would be there, with the Lords Waxley, Grafton, Lynderly, some petty lords and landed knights... and Lord Belmore, who had lately reconciled with her father. The other Lords Declarant were expected to shun the nuptials, so Petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s presence was essential.
Â 
Alayne understood all that well enough, but it meant that the burden of getting Sweetrobin safely down the mountain fell on her. â<U+0080><U+009C>Give his lordship a cup of sweetmilk,â<U+0080><U+009D> she told the maester. â<U+0080><U+009C>That will stop him from shaking on the journey down.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
(...)
Â 
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d like to give you a hundred spankings and five slaps. You would not dare behave like this if Petyr were here. The little lord had a good healthy fear of his stepfather.
Â 
She wishes he was there only because she's saddled with the task of getting Sweetrobin down to meet the Lords Declarant and would rather that LF deals with him, and because SR would be behaving if he was there. But, as it happens, she manages to perform that task very well herself, and doesn't wish for him to be there at any other point in the chapter.
Â 
She never actually wishes that he was there because she personally enjoys his presence.
Â 
Oh, but how could I forget, you must be referring to this, right?
Â 
Before she could summon the servants, however, Sweetrobin threw his skinny arms around her and kissed her. It was a little boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kiss, and clumsy. Everything Robert Arryn did was clumsy. If I close my eyes I can pretend he is the Knight of Flowers. Ser Loras had given Sansa Stark a red rose once, but he had never kissed her... and no Tyrell would ever kiss Alayne Stone. Pretty as she was, she had been born on the wrong side of the blanket.
Â 
As the boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lips touched her own she found herself thinking of another kiss. She could still remember how it felt, when his cruel mouth pressed down on her own. He had come to Sansa in the darkness as green fire filled the sky. He took a song and a kiss, and left me nothing but a bloody cloak.
Â 
Oh wait... that was not about Littlefinger, that was about someone else... 
Â 
She's genuinely happy to see him, you say? Where do we see that?
Â 
As the riders were climbing off their mules, however, one of Petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s guardsmen emerged from within the keep. â<U+0080><U+009C>Lady Alayne,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said, â<U+0080><U+009C>the Lord Protector has been waiting for you.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s back?â<U+0080><U+009D> she said, startled.
â<U+0080><U+009C>At evenfall. Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll find him in the west tower.â<U+0080><U+009D>
The hour was closer to dawn than to dusk, and most of the castle was asleep, but not Petyr Baelish. Alayne found him seated by a crackling fire, drinking hot mulled wine with three men she did not know. They all rose when she entered, and Petyr smiled warmly. â<U+0080><U+009C>Alayne. Come, give your father a kiss.â<U+0080><U+009D>
She hugged him dutifully and kissed him on the cheek. â<U+0080><U+009C>I am sorry to intrude, Father. No one told me you had company.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>You are never an intrusion, sweetling. I was just now telling these good knights what a dutiful daughter I had.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Dutiful and beautiful,â<U+0080><U+009D> said an elegant young knight whose thick blond mane cascaded down well past his shoulders.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Aye,â<U+0080><U+009D> said the second knight, a burly fellow with a thick salt-and-pepper beard, a red nose bulbous with broken veins, and gnarled hands as large as hams. â<U+0080><U+009C>You left out that part, mâ<U+0080><U+0099>lord.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>I would do the same if she were my daughter,â<U+0080><U+009D> said the last knight, a short, wiry man with a wry smile, pointed nose, and bristly orange hair. â<U+0080><U+009C>Particularly around louts like us.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Alayne laughed. â<U+0080><U+009C>Are you louts?â<U+0080><U+009D> she said, teasing. â<U+0080><U+009C>Why, I took the three of you for gallant knights.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Knights they are,â<U+0080><U+009D> said Petyr. â<U+0080><U+009C>Their gallantry has yet to be demonstrated, but we may hope. Allow me to present Ser Byron, Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich. Sers, the Lady Alayne, my natural and very clever daughter... with whom I must needs confer, if you will be so good as to excuse us.â<U+0080><U+009D>
The three knights bowed and withdrew, though the tall one with the blond hair kissed her hand before taking his leave.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Hedge knights?â<U+0080><U+009D> said Alayne, when the door had closed.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Hungry knights. I thought it best that we have a few more swords about us. The times grow ever more interesting, my sweet, and when the times are interesting you can never have too many swords. The Merling Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s returned to Gulltown, and old Oswell had some tales to tell.â<U+0080><U+009D>
She knew better than to ask what sort of tales. If Petyr had wanted her to know, he would have told her. â<U+0080><U+009C>I did not expect you back so soon,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said. â<U+0080><U+009C>I am glad youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve come.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>I would never have known it from the kiss you gave me.â<U+0080><U+009D> He pulled her closer, caught her face between his hands, and kissed her on the lips for a long time. â<U+0080><U+009C>Now thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the sort of kiss that says welcome home. See that you do better next time.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes, Father.â<U+0080><U+009D> She could feel herself blushing.
Â 
Where are any signs that she's genuinely happy to see him?
Â 
Nope. I'm afraid that the text never shows her being genuinely happy to see him. That only happened in your head.
Â 

Â 
Â

Â 
Geez, really, what possible reason could she have to make sure Myranda doesn't suspect she's Sansa? 
Â 
She would need to be brave down below, where the chance of being unmasked was so much greater. Petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s friends at court had sent him word that the queen had men out looking for the Imp and Sansa Stark. It will mean my head if I am found, she reminded herself as she descended a flight of icy stone steps. I must be Alayne all the time, inside and out.

There's one moment when she wishes LF was there - this:
Â 
Â 


As I've quoted before and I guess you've read already
Â 
Even before the guards and serving men had made their descent, the castle had seemed as empty as a tomb, and more so when Petyr Baelish was away.
Â 
Those are the thoughts of someone who misses Petyr Baelish, not someone who's relieved that he's gone.

Â 

She's genuinely happy to see him, you say? Where do we see that?
Â 
As the riders were climbing off their mules, however, one of Petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s guardsmen emerged from within the keep. â<U+0080><U+009C>Lady Alayne,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said, â<U+0080><U+009C>the Lord Protector has been waiting for you.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s back?â<U+0080><U+009D> she said, startled.
â<U+0080><U+009C>At evenfall. Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll find him in the west tower.â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
Nope. I'm afraid that the text never shows her being genuinely happy to see him. That only happened in your head.

In her entire attitude through the scene. She teases the hedge knights, has a playful banter with Littlefinger regarding gifts and only cools down when LF speaks of marriage. Those aren't the attitudes of someone who's afraid, upset or otherwise doesn't want LF to be there. On the contrary, they are the attitudes of someone who's happy. When did you see Sansa tease knights in KL? Even more, when did you see Sansa act that way in entire series?

Â 

Â 
Geez, really, what possible reason could she have to make sure Myranda doesn't suspect she's Sansa? 
Â 

Indeed. Progression. First she considers throwing herself at the Bronze Yohn's feet and beg him for protection. As her story advances, she no longer thinks of LF as she does in ASOS and wants to prevent the Royces from knowing the truth instead of seeking their protection.
2946	Sirar Salih	2014-04-21	Such a powerful and sad farewell scene between Tyrion and Pod! This was definitely my favorite scene in this episode.
Â 
*Spoilers*
Â 
Pod is my hero, I feel sad that he will die later on. How do you think it will happen in the show?
2947	Ser Bran Stark	2014-04-24	Pod dies? How so? I'm sure when Brienne screamed "sword" and they cut her down they cut down Pod and Ser Hyle as well. That is the reason she changed her mind to save them so i don't think he's dead.
2948	Hippocras	2014-04-24	I don't think he is dead either.
2949	Mad Monkey	2014-04-24	Well, the fact that Podrick is so likable probably means that he is marked for death sooner or later.Incidentally, we probably should start some Podrick Payne hate threads if we want to prolong his role on the show.
2950	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-24	I don't think he dies, actually. I think it's very likely that Stoneheart is holding him hostage. Otherwise why would Brienne lead Jaime into a trap?
Â 
As for show!Pod, I still don't like him. I mostly blame the writers for that stupid running gag last season, but I also can't imagine the actor pulling off the iconic lines: "Ser? My lady? Ser?"
2951	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-24	He's not dead. Brienne cried "sword!" so he and Hyle Hunt could be safe. Why would be the point of doing it if they are dead already?
2952	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-25	I think hyle hunt has had his chips, although I hope not, I quite like him as an alternative love interest than Jaime.
2953	King Tyrion I	2014-04-26	It was also my favorite scene of the episode. 
AFAIK Pod doesn't die.
2954	WinterKing	2014-04-20	Share!
2955	Obebb	2014-04-20	My friend is really really really confused as to what the point of Sansa's necklace was.
Â 
And she thinks Tommen will be a great King
2956	ohpooratlas	2014-04-20	My boyfriend is read for the slaves in Meereen to start tearing the shiznaz up next episode.
2957	shiola	2014-04-20	"Nothing really happened but I didn't hate it"
2958	The Red Haired Viper	2014-04-20	"I was really starting to like Jamie, but raping Cersi in a church...?"
2959	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	One of my friends is really convinced that Dany's going to fly to Westeros on dragonback by the end of this season, since her dragons have really grown.
I don't have the heart to correct him.
2960	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	One of my friends is really convinced that Dany's going to fly to Westeros on dragonback by the end of this season, since her dragons have really grown.
I don't have the heart to correct him.


Â 
I have that heart. I made it clear to people her dragons are untrained and unridden before the season started. Ep01 reaffirmed that and now they are happy to watch and let it unfold instead of flipping the desk at her not heading west yet.
2961	lyanna_maria	2014-04-21	My flatmate felt pity for Ser Dontos and so, so much pity for Tyrion: she was very touched by the Pod-Tyrion scene.
She's in perpetual astonishment at Tywin's exceptional abilities to manipulate everyone and to be a bastard. She thinks Tommen is a cute kid.
She was concerned that Sansa wouldn't make it out of King's Landing, but now she's even more concerned because of the lascivious looks Petyr is giving her.
She laughed at Arya and the Hound, she thinks their scenes are quite hilarious.Â
2962	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	My friends are shocked about Jaime raping Cersei.
2963	Mel_Rose	2014-04-21	My sister's opinion of the episode was that it was like an hors d' oeuvre, she "didn't feel full at the end".
Â 
She said that Tywin is being clever and trying to defend his realm and position; Tommen "finally a smart one"; and she also said " I hope they do something at the Wall, like Stannis going there to help or something".
2964	Rashtibram	2014-04-21	My ingenious friend figured out the PW plot. He recognized the significance of the necklace and suspected that LF and Olenna had formed a plan together to off Joffrey so that Margaery could marry Tommen â<U+0080><U+0093> without me even pointing him in the right direction! The only thing wrong with his explanation was that he thought Brienne was also somehow involved due to her oath to Catelyn and the scene she had with Margaery in the premiere. He also asked me why the plan had to be so elaborate (e.g why LF couldn't just have had the necklace delivered to Olenna instead of Sansa), to which I kind of gawked and had no answer. Seriously, why was that plan so elaborate? If anyone can give me an answer I can relay to my friend, I'd be very happy, as I don't feel like going to the trouble of creating an entire thread about it.
2965	dbunting	2014-04-21	^A lot of people, me included think the Olena, Sansa poison plot was too much. Answer always seems to be that Olena didn't want to get caught w poison, so used Sansa as a "drug mule"
2966	Moshroom	2014-04-21	I don't know if that's the main reason, but with Sansa wearing the necklace, she now is kind of involved in Joffrey's death and might be more under Littlefinger's control. I guess even though she despised Joffrey, she'd still feel guilty. And since Ser Dontos gave her the necklace, she might have been more willing to follow/trust him.
2967	The Reckoner	2014-04-21	Worried about Tyrion.
2968	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-21	My ingenious friend figured out the PW plot. He recognized the significance of the necklace and suspected that LF and Olenna had formed a plan together to off Joffrey so that Margaery could marry Tommen â<U+0080><U+0093> without me even pointing him in the right direction! The only thing wrong with his explanation was that he thought Brienne was also somehow involved due to her oath to Catelyn and the scene she had with Margaery in the premiere.

Â 
It's simple, really. Littlefinger wants Sansa to be directly involved to more easily manipulate her into changing her identity and basically doing everything LF wants. Simply fleeing isn't enough, because in her mind Sansa might think that people will believe her, but when the poison was carried by her she's pretty much LF's prisoner.Â

Â 
Makes it more difficult to make a murder conspiracy connection between LF and Olena by involving Dontos and Sansa. Harder to connect the dots when there are more dots to connect.
2971	Rapsie	2014-04-21	My other half thought was pretty shocked at Jaime raping Cersei (he is unsullied and he thought it was rape).Â 
Â 
He also likes Dany's story, as "sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s half a world away but her story is epic. She has Dragons and is conquering the world."
Â 
He then compared her to Genghis Khan. â<U+0080>¦I think it was complimentary. He also still refers to her as blond dragon chick.Â 
Â 
He liked Stannis's table of Westeros but still thinks Stannis is a villain.Â 
Â 
Thought Sam was a twit for sending Gilly to Mole Town.
2972	lyanna_maria	2014-04-21	I have a friend who has read the books up to, more or less, the Red Wedding, so she's not a complete Unsullied, but she didn't know anything about the PW or Oberyn, for instance. She just thinks that Oberyn and Daario are incredibly sexy. Also, regarding Jaime and Cersei, I gave her the page in the book to read, and she was pissed off and wishes they had kept it that way.
2973	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-21	Really disgusted/shocked at Jaime. It was rape in her eyes and a major level of low-Â  not just raping a sister while she is mourning her dead son but doing it in front of his corpse. She feels sorry for Cersei and doesn't want Brienne and Jaime hooking up any more.
Â 
Loves Arya and The Hound
Â 
Thinks Dany is a Badass who deserves the Throne
Â 
Thinks Stannis's daughter is cute and likes Davos...Stannis is a dick though.
2974	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-21	one of my friends couldnt even figure out that littlefinger was behind everything. neither of the people i watched it with realized anything about the necklace.
are they going to say that the necklace was poison in a future episode?

2975	Howdyphillip	2014-04-21	Â The friend I watched the episode with tonight is convinced that Jaime will die in the next couple of episodes because she was starting to like him and now that he is a rapist, it will be easier to accept his death.
2976	Azzanadra	2014-04-21	One of my friends thought the contrary about the Jaime/Cersei scene, I told him there was a lo of controversy about it to which he replied: "WTF? This is a world full of gruesome murder and violence and people are worried about a little bit of rape?"Â
2977	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-21	My dad likes "the blonde girl" and my brother declared "I KNEW IT!" when Littlefinger showed up.

Oberyn is introduced before the Red Wedding. Your friend may be a poser insofar as book-reading goes.
2978	of man and wolf	2014-04-21	Thinks the Stannis stuff is dull.
Â 
Doesn't like the religious aspects of the show/book.
Â 
Says all Stannis ever does is sit and brood, while the red woman goes on about her god.
Â 
Also thinks the Oberyn stuff needs to get away from constantly telling us that they are different.

2979	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-21	Thoughts of few of my mates:
- Dany the Hot Dragon chick should be on IT and kill the Lannisters.Â 
- Stannis is a dick.
- Sansa is dumb.Â 
- Jaime is a rapist.
- Olenna had a role in the poisoning of Joffrey.Â 
- Oberyn provided the poison.Â
2980	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-22	A friend thought the necklace would protect Sansa somehow and is aghast that LF took it.
2981	lyanna_maria	2014-04-22	Oberyn is introduced before the Red Wedding. Your friend may be a poser insofar as book-reading goes. 


Â 
 Â  Â  Â I asked at the beginning of the season, because she spontaneously said how cool the "new characters" were. I told her she probably knew them from the book, and she says if she ever reached that part she doesn't remember. She left the book unfinished because it was beginning to be "too much", so It's likely that her attention was drifting during ASoS.Â 
Â 
By the way, my flatmate didn't say anything about the necklace or anyone's involvement in the PW yet either.
2982	ovis alba	2014-04-22	- Jaime/Cersei seems to be a "so what?" for most of them
- many actually like Tywin a lot and classify him as rather one of the decent guys  (that should help to get Tyrion darker though  )
- especially the guys really enjoyed the Daario scene
- One guy just learned from me today that Daario is the same guy as the one in season 1 
- there is a little more confusion about the poisoning than before (not sure if hinting Oberyns knowledge of poison just afterwards was so great), as some thing LF, Olenna and Oberyn were involved and they can't really see the connection of those three. (from what I saw in a trailer it might be that it's made a little more clear though)
- and I specifically asked what they think about Tommen as I noticed there was debate about him being to old and changing the actor: actually some didn't even realize that he was much older than last time we saw him although I was surprised that almost everyone actually still did remember that we saw him already at some point in the show, however it was more like "there was this brother at some point" but noone really cared how old he was back then or what he looked like, so not much confusion about that. Characterwise I think he comes of as intended, naive but nice little boy that is mostly gonna listen to what Tywin and maybe Cersei are telling him to do (although hardly anyone sees Cersei as a big player in the game anymore with Tywin being there and expected to take on most of the ruling and her being crushed by Joff's death )
2983	Godsbraid	2014-04-22	My one Unsullied friend had only one thing to say on the PW: "About time!".
She is onla a "casual" viewer, and have no predictions etc, so I watch TYTs "What the Flick" show on YouTubeÂ in order to get my dose of Unsullied predictions Â .
2984	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-22	My family has not said much, during the show as Sansa started running away my hubby started saying "Oh my goodness! We haven't seen that Littlefinger guy in awhile. It's him, he has something to do with it. It has to be him." So he got to feel good being right on that though he's worried for Sansa. Â His only other comment and he was half-joking after Dany's scene was to say this show is racist with the white people always freeing the slaves who are brown or black. Â 
Â 
My dad who is a non-book reader, but a wiki reader - he and I are having an almost daily argument about what the last episode will be and when LSH will be revealed.

2985	ovis alba	2014-04-22	I like my few Unsullied that are always specualting a lot, it's fun to listen to them, because some stuff is pretty similar to what I expected and guessed when I read the books, but sometimes they come up with stuff I would have never thought about.
On of them spoilered himself by accident though about Tyrion this season, I was almost annoyed, because I always try to really not tell to not ruin the fun for them and mostly also me  and then he just spoilers himself.
2986	Angmar	2014-04-22	They now think Oberyn did it because he knows about poisons.
2987	Night'sQueen	2014-04-22	The only comments my husband made were:
"Wow, he raped her. I thought he was supposed to be a good guy now??"
And at the end of the episode:
"It's never enough."
2988	gvewolf243	2014-04-22	My friend was disgusted by Jaime and Cersei scene. Called him a rapist. Well, i explained him and told about book version. Still , well done D&D , lol. Â Â
2989	Volverin	2014-04-22	My imaginary frined was disgusted by the rape scene and called HBO to make a complaint.

Â 
I always watch all the reviews I can find on Youtube for the same reason, but the one you pointed out has a huge spoiler in it.
Now, everybody knows that Jon is not a bastard and that N+E=J. I think this guy was spoiled a little, but not enough to get a clear picture of the (hopefully)real formula.

2991	Arkash	2014-04-22	One of my friends thought the rape didnt add anything to Jaime's character. I told them about the book version.
Â 
"No ! I hate it when it end like this !" - at the end of the episode.
Â 
They loved Arya and the Hound.
Â 
Another friend had a huge laugh at Daario pissing.
Â 
They find Sam and Gilly cute. "The actor who plays Sam has a very touching way to him."
Â 
"Motherfucking Thenns !"
Â 
"Dont piss Ygritte off !"
Â 
They enjoyed Dany's speech.
Â 
"Oh, shit ! It's Littlefinger ! Sansa's fucked !"
Â 
They found Littlefinger's scene very creepy.
Â 
They all think Olenna did poison Joffrey, but that's my fault, I inadverdently throw some clues.
2992	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-22	My Husband is Unsullied so I always pump him for info
Â 
Jamie/Cersei scene: So what now that we started to feel bad for Jamie it's time to feel bad for Cersei?Â 
-Which is my biggest fear for this scene. I want Cersei to fall apart internally due to a house all of her own making. I don't want there to be any "oh Jamie raped her that's why she's doing this" Nope, I want full on paranoid delusions and self-destruction throughout
Â 
Stannis: He's kind of an ass and he's a weak leader because he refuses to see that just because he has a right to the throne doesn't mean he deserves it.Â 
-he identifies the religion as a piece to it but stated "he's rigid in general, of course he's like that with the religion"Â 
Â 
Littlefingers a creep
Still likes Dany, Arya and the Hound

I almost thought he had guessed it for a moment XDÂ 
IIRC they mentioned in an earlier episode that he (Cenk) have read the first book. Might also be why he can remember the characters names better than some of the others.Â
2994	A Man Is A Man	2014-04-22	Â I've told an unsullied friend that Jamie is a cool character that slowly gets redeemed and is a good guy.
Â 
Â She now thinks I'm nuts.
2995	Dragon Queen	2014-04-22	My fiancA© loved Dany and Daario went way up in his opinion.
Â 
He said Cersei is now his most disliked character since Joffrey died and the Jaime-Cersei scene did not bother him.
Â 
He dislikes Stannis now.
Â 
My brother loves Arya and the Hound and said he could watch a spin off show of those two.
Â 
Thinks Oberyn and Ellaria "are weird."
Â 
Says "Sam was being an idiot for sending Gilly to the *****house."
2996	AStrappingHealthyWench	2014-04-23	My best friend is unsullied but makes me "spoil" her sometimes so she'll know whats going on...
This week:
Â 
me: "Hey, Amy, did you figure out the Purple Wedding conspiracy? Who did it?"
Amy: "YES!!!! I figured something out all by myself!"
me: "Ok lets hear it."
Amy: "the Grandpa did it!!!"
me: ........Â  
Â 
I gave her a clue with the necklace but that only confused her more...so I just told her how it went down in the books.
Â 
She DID NOT think Jamie raped Cersei though she's never read the books...
Â 
She has no idea who Oberyn is or why he's in KL or why we care that he has orgies in every episode or anything...she is part of the concensus who thinks we need less brothels and more actual story. She was confused because she knew the Lannisters and the Martells were supposed to hate each other. So I explained all that mess to her as well.
Â 
She really likes Dany right now...but she thinks she'll be in Westeros soon. 
Â 
My boyfriend, also unsullied, has no issues with any of it. He's just taking it as a really cool fantasty "soap opera" kind of thing....
His exact words: Wow, GoT has been great this season so far!!!
He doesn't seem to care about the 3000 plotsÂ and characters and backstories and prophesies and layers to the series. He just takes it for what it is (which is fine). A cool show with boobs, dragons, boobs,Â fighting, boobs, an occasional penis, boobs...oh, and the Others are pretty cool!
2997	Neumond	2014-04-23	Â I've told an unsullied friend that Jamie is a cool character that slowly gets redeemed and is a good guy.
Â 
Â She now thinks I'm nuts.


Â 
I feel for you... Who could have known what they are going to do?
Very stupid change, that actually robbed the scene of any subtler but deeper meaning...
Â 
My Unsullied loved Daario this episode and one of them actually didnt thought Cersei was raped.
I had a somewhat heated discussion with him about things, that are a no-go in consentual sex...
Â 
I find it strange no one payed attention to the sansa-escape or the things going on with Stannis.
This weeks episode really felt rushed for me... The non-book-readers seemed to miss everything important other than the Dany-scene...
We will see where this will end... I hope not in very confused non-book-readers.
2998	lyanna_maria	2014-04-23	A guy I've talked to was absolutely sure that Tywin was involved in the assassination. He thought it impossible that something this big was going on in King's Landing without his knowledge. He guessed Littlefinger was on it the moment he saw him, but I had to practically tell him about the necklace thing.
2999	Myrddin	2014-04-23	Re: Not remembering Oberyn from book
To be honest, I read the whole book and forgot about him by the time Feast came out. I did vaguely remember the fight with the Mountain, but not really much else about the Viper.
Â 
If you're reading for the main storylines, side characters can get lost in the mass of folk. Even characters like Oberyn.
3000	LordStoneheart	2014-04-23	I don't want to make any trouble so I'll just hint around and say my sister was glad a certain thing happened and didn't feel a shred of sympathy. She's pretty meh about Dany at this point, and doesn't really see where the "point" of the story is anymore. My dad is convinced Tywin killed Joffrey and Olenna had nothing to do with it.Â

3001	ohpooratlas	2014-04-23	Pretty much all of my unsullied coworkers were just like "WTF was that all about with Jaime??? Does that happen in the books?" I tell them it's still pretty F-ed up in the books, but it's clearly consensual when it all goes down. Whatever the director's intentions were with that scene supposedly having it end as consensual ... they've clearly failed.
Â 
Regarding the PW:
Â 
A couple of them have figured out that Littlefinger is involved but they've yet to really connect the dots between Littlefinger and the Queen of Thorns. My coworkers either think it's one or the other ... "... and that Oberyn guy! He has the knowledge of poisons!" Oberyn is such a fantastic red herring.
3002	Adhara	2014-04-23	I mentioned to an usullied what was coming....Grief sex.
Wondered If HBO would...and of course, they did
Â but the ambiguity....meh..
.
So, I sort of had to explain... grief is a type of death in itself, and grief sex happens,
as the brain breaks out of it's inert state of numbness.
It's not gentle,Â the mind is struggling for the surface of normalcy.
Â 
Â 
It just sort of happened, before theÂ corpse was completely cool.

3003	shiola	2014-04-23	I have tried to explain to all of my Unsullied friends that book Jaime would *never* rape Cersei and that the scene was a mistake for his character development and they should forget about it. Â They said they will try to forget it seeing as they didn't like it either and found it a bit out of character.
3004	RoamingRonin	2014-04-23	Two non-readers at my job were talking about the show. One guy said he heard that Robb's wife didn't die in the books and that she's pregnant so Robb still has an heir out there. I didn't say anything but I was LOL'ing inside.Â 
Â 
That same guy knows I read the books so he asked me if Cersei had anything to do with Joffrey's death. I asked if he really wanted a hint and he said no. I was surprised he asked that.Â 
Â 
Another non-reader I know thinks Prince Oberyn did it and that Sansa is about to die. Now he thinks Sansa is going to a brothel . He changed his mind and thinks the fool (Dontos) did it with the necklace.

3007	Kevoncox	2014-04-20	Hey Guy,
First post here and I wanted to post a screenshot of the necklace for discussion. In the books there was some discussion between the cake and necklace but I believe this has been cleared up with a nice bowtie for us this week, First we have Littlefinger stating he only recently had it made and then a shot of the necklace itself.

Â
3008	The Giver	2014-04-20	Yep. Although it was also noticeably (only if you look closely, so maybe not so noticeably) missing the stone at the wedding.
3009	DreamSongs	2014-04-20	I missed it on the first view because I wasn't wearing my glasses, but Giver is right. Â Sansa wears the necklace to the wedding and Olenna fiddles about with gown and the stone to the far left disappears and just the setting is left hanging onto her dress.

3013	Gertrude	2014-04-20	I do wish the shot of the necklace before Petyr smashes a crystal was a bit clearer though. It was still easy to miss that a jewel was missing, especially if you're not looking for it.
3014	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-20	Well

Â 
Yeah, definetely. I just thought she purchased it herself with contacts in the Citadel or something

Â

3016	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Â

Wouldn't that sort of defeat the whole purpose of involving Ser Dontos and Sansa?
Â 
Why needlessly complicate things? If Olenna could acquire the poison herself without any spies in KL noticing, it would make more sense to sew it into her own clothing or something before the wedding. The whole point of using Ser Dontos and Sansa was to get the poison from LF to Olenna without anything being traced back to the Tyrells.
3017	Envie	2014-04-21	I still never understood the need to remove the jewel from Sansa in the first place. Why go through all that? If LF wanted to conspire with Olenna why not just give her the poison before the wedding? The only answer I've ever come up with was that they wanted a fallback victim to frame (Sansa) in case the poison failed. Right?
3018	Cyberia	2014-04-21	IMHO so that the instrument of death for Joffery Lannister would come from Sansa Stark.Â  It was Olenna's wedding, she paid for it, and she was serving justice, cold.

With so many spies in Kings Landing, it would probably be too dangerous for Olenna to acquire the poison herself or to be seen taking something directly from Little Finger or one of his employees.
3020	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	I was hoping they'd make it explicitly clear and LF would point out a missing jewel in the necklace.
Maybe they'll just mention it later.
3021	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	They probably want viewers to speculate about who did it and how for a little while longer.

There is a scene in the promo for next week where LF tells Sansa she is a suspect or something, I think they'll mention the necklace then
3023	direwoofwoof	2014-04-21	The necklace was little blue hearts, if I recall correctly.  Symbolism?

I've always assumed that was the case - they wanted to be able to point at Sansa if things went wrong.

3026	Prince of the North	2014-04-21	Yep.Â  Sansa already had a tremendous amount of "Motive" for wanting to kill Joffery.Â  The wedding feast provided the "Opportunity".Â  So the missing piece would be "Means" which the Tyrells planted on her (the poison in the hairnet/necklace).Â  So I agree that they went through that little subterfuge just in case they needed a patsy to take the fall - she was giftwrapped.

That, and also don't forget : Littlefinger wanted Sansa to actually be involved in the murder. She's already suspicious enough, but by having her wearing the poison she has zero hopes of ever trusting anyone except him, which is of course exactly what he wants. He implies Sansa in the murder directly, so that she'd be reliant on him.
3029	Greywolf2375	2014-04-21	Lyanna Stark was very fond of blue, flowers.


Blue roses, I don't think there is any connection between the necklace and Lyanna. Â It should have been amythests, but apparently purple doesn't show up as well and would be harder to see.

uhm...... yes there was. You could see it right next to the one he smashed. That seemed to be the point - another shot of the missing stone.
3032	Gertrude	2014-04-21	I know that and you know that, but this was a post by a non-book spoiled watcher. The Unsullied pay close attention to the show and speculate without spoilers of any kind. My point is that the shots of the missing gem were not obvious enough for show only watchers to obviously pick it up. If D&D wanted it that way, they succeeded. But if they wanted it to be noticed, I think a little better shot was needed.
3033	Cyberia	2014-04-21	Look, the Tyrells arent and never had intentions to use Sansa as a patsy or scapegoat.
Â 
Why would there be an evacuation plan for Sansa at all?Â  Just leave her at the wedding.Â  She'll get arrested and beheaded.Â  Done.Â  Tyrells get away scott free.
Â 
Olenna explained her motivations as she was stealing the poison jewel from the necklace.Â  It was poetic justice.
3034	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-21	At least LF gave the necklace back to Dontos after his explanation to Sansa.

The two unsullied I watch the show with picked up on the missing stone right away in that shot. They also made comments on how Dontos's body will be found with a missing stone, and a smashed one - since it seemed part of that broken stone stayed attached to it's metal loop.
Â 
They also wondered if all the stones are poison andÂ who paid for that necklace if they are?
3036	joachim	2014-04-21	My surmise was that, in the book,Â Littlefinger sweetened the deal by suggesting that Tyrion would be implicated and,Â onceÂ he was dead, Sansa would be free to marry Willas. Maybe that will come up in the show. Olenna could complain about getting only half of what was promised.

Â 
i agree. no way to tell unless you already know what to look for from the books or spoiler blogs online. just no reason to focus on the necklace and decide to pay attention to the number of jewels unless something like that was stated or illustrated clearly. not that we need that level of obviousness, but still.Â
3039	Grail King	2014-04-22	At least LF gave the necklace back to Dontos after his explanation to Sansa.


Yes, and the boat somehow makes it back to shore by currents and bingo Sansa is guilty, makes me wonder if she gets taken out of the Eyrie forgetting she has the hairnet in her cloak pocket.Â
3040	Justin Danford	2014-04-22	Wasn't there a security concern in the book? With Robb being murdered at a wedding, with so many Dornish and travelers in the city for the Wedding security for the King was a concern. I always assumed they used Sansa as a mule to carry the poison into the wedding, and since they knew of the plot to have her escape after, the murder weapon would escape with her.
Â 
Olena COULD have brought the posoin in with her, or wore the necklace herself, but that does run the risk of having her implicated. What better murder weapon then one that dissapears right after the murder?
Â 
^ Not a bullet-proof theory, but just how I always saw it. It made sense to include Sansa on several levels, includingâ<U+0080><U+0094>let us not fail to mentionâ<U+0080><U+0094>the authorial level.

You forget that LF desires Sansa. By involving her unwittingly, he has a pawn to play to make her do his bidding. At any time, he can implicate her, and it helps his cause that she would also suspect she might be considered part of the plot.
But in general...I agree it seemed at least a bit contortionist and unnecessary. ANYONE could have worn that necklace for Oleanna to receive the poison.

Yes, I think Sansa disappearing right after Joff's murder was Littlefinger's idea and the Tyrells didn't know about it.Â  But I disagree that having Sansa unwittingly deliver the murder weapon to the feast was unnecessary.Â  As has already been mentioned several times, it serves to make her even more dependent on them (the Tyrells and Littlefinger) and provides a perfect patsy to implicate should the need arise.Â  I think the Tyrells hoped that need would not arise and they could marry Willas to Sansa but still it was nice to have the security of being able to point to Sansa if suspicions toward them got too worrisome.Â  I think Littlefinger double-crossed the Tyrells when it came to Sansa, though, and usedÂ Joff's murder and subsequent confusion as a good opportunity to steal her away for himself (because, as you say, if he can't have his Cat then he'll settle for her daughter).Â Â

"Do something to save you King idiots"

Â 
I believe that after Olenna adjusts Sansa's necklace she walks towards Joffrey.
3053	Envie	2014-04-23	It certainly seems like they intended Margaery's reaction to be genuine and not fake which then must mean Margaery did not know about the poison or take part in handling it.Â
3054	Gertrude	2014-04-23	Right after she fusses with Sansa they have a wider shot and you can see Olenna walking back to her seat. As she passes a carafe on the table, there is an audible 'plink' sound. Seems rather careless of her as this was early in the feast and anyone could have drank out of it (Marg, Joff, Tywin, Cersei). So if that was the show's way of planting the clues as to how it was done, I don't think they did it very well (the actual delivery of the poison).
Â 
Unless they meant for her to drop it directly into Joff's cup (you couldn't see her dropping it, just hear it), but then it would have to be a very slow acting poison, which it is not as established with Maester Cressen season 2. (unless they are going to say it's a different poison).Â

Â 
When Joffrey started to choke, he looked at her. I think in that moment she was afraid he suspected her, so she started yelling "He's choking" to draw attention from her to Joffrey. (Don't forget his arm pointed in the direction of Tyrion and Margaery)

I was under the impression that Marg put Joff's cup on the edge of her table near OlennaÂ as the pie came out.
3058	joachim	2014-04-23	I don't think that they'll ever tell us exactly when and how it was placed in Joffrey's cup.

I do not think they would have openly discussed poisoning Joffrey, remember Oleanna told Marge to watch what she said even to her, so I think they might have been talking in code in case they were being observed or eavesdropped on somehow.Â 
Â 
What seemed signifigant to to me is that the corpse and the boat were not burned as they were in the book and LF threw the poison necklace in the boat as well, so it might end up being found and used as evidence against Tyrion.
3060	joachim	2014-04-23	Interesting. Although, someone might recognize the necklace as being Sansa's, which would make her seem even more guilty.
3061	ache	2014-04-24	I always wondered if there was a reason Dontos gave Sansa the hairnet so long before the Purple Wedding. It seemed awfully risky, given that all Sansa's handmaidens were Cersei's spies, to have penniless, friendless, orphaned Sansa suddenly turn up with a shiny new piece of fine jewelry. However, seeing as Show!Dontos only gave her the necklace days before the wedding, I guess not.

The poison IS the stones???
What if Sansa had touched them with wet fingers, sucked at them in a moment of boredom, tried to sweep off some drink or food.......
Too risky, they might have poisoned the girl before the the stones got even close to Joffrey.

Â 
The poison most definitely is the stones and they seem to dissolve quite easily since Sansa sees smudges left behind by the crystal in the empty setting. Awkward if it'd rained...."uh, Lady Sansa...you have amethyst running down your face/chest".

That's the prevailing theory. I find it kind of weak, but I'm willing to role with it.Â

Â 
I think the question to ask is what would have happened hadÂ Cersei, who we pretty much know was not involved in the plot, not immediately fingered Tyrion as the culprit. Â Had she not done that, and had Sansa not so easily escaped the castle, Sansa (with her missing jewel) would have served as a pretty good safety net (especially if she'd been apprehended trying to escape).

3090	go joff go	2014-04-20	Was I the only one that sort of saw the parallel between the Danny chooses her champion and lays chooses her champion scene
3091	Arak-iri	2014-04-20	I really liked the Daario Naharis duel. I begin to think the actor might pull it off.

MOD EDIT: DO NOT DISCUSS BOOK CHARACTERS IN A NON-SPOILER THREAD.

3093	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	I need a gif of Dany's face during the catapult scene.The one where shes all like "eeeeeeehhhhhh"Â 


Â 
She has improved her smug faces
Â 
Shireen Baratheon, first of her name
Jun Snaaah having expressions.
Oberyn "here, sit here next to my orgy" Martell.
Ellaria being all fuck yea.
3094	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-20	Shireen Baratheon, first of her name.


She is truly Stannis' daughter.Â
3095	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	She is truly Stannis' daughter.Â 


Â 
 I have to rewatch the scene eventually but I swear that the director told her "see how Dillane speaks and acts his scenes? Ok, do the same". Or Dillane warged her.
3096	juanml82	2014-04-20	EDD IS BACK
Â 
Show Thorne apparently being a pastiche of book Thorne and Donal Noye makes him way more interesting this go-around.Â  I like that even as he dislikes Jon Snow personally he's taking Snow's input seriously and giving it the weight it warrants.Â  There's more to Thorne this way, and I like this change.


Agreed. And the attack on Craster's Keep makes sense on top.
Â 
Â

3097	Mladen	2014-04-20	1. Adored the barrels of chains being catapulted on Meereen.
Â 
2. Tywin's pop quiz with Tommen... Great scene
Â 
3. Sophie Turner looking amazing in this episode... Those several minutes she appeared were OK, but she truly looked beautiful tonight.
Â 
4. Daario "expendable" Naharis LOL...
Â 
5. Shireen... Sweet child...

3098	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-20	Tywin and Tommen- He is capable of being fond towards a family member!
Â 
Ygritte- Damn, what a vengeful bitch! I'm glad Jon got away from her now...
Â 
That boy being sent to CB with the message from those creepy Thenns...and thenÂ Jon with his hand on the boys shoulder. 
Â 
Arya and the Hound! Just too funny and it was nice being reminded that Arya still has a good heart (her exchanges with the little girl and anger at the Hound stealing from them). I also liked the mention about how Frey rule is bad and how disgraceful the RW was....'The Gods will have their Vengeance'
Â 
Dany speaking in High Valyrian (Emilia is an ace at it)
Â 
The music during the Sansa escape scene. Really intense!
3099	shiola	2014-04-20	1. Adored the barrels of chains being catapulted on Meereen.

Â 
Loved this, too!
3100	shiola	2014-04-20	Tywin actuallyÂ raising his voice gave me chills
3101	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-20	Davos having his Gregory House moment.
3102	Belisarius09	2014-04-20	I liked Shireen...
Â 
Tywin is cool, and LF making an appearance was nice....
Â 
I guess I liked that they finally brought up Sam the Slayer....
Â 
Hated all the rest
3103	Cyril	2014-04-20	Quite a few things.
Â 
In general, the episode was very well paced.Â  It kept me entertained and my unsullied friends went "it's over already?!"Â  That's a good thing.
Â 
More specifically, my favorite parts were:
Davos and Shireen
The Iron Bank mention
Tommen and Tywin. Did you notice that bad look Cersei was giving Tywin?Â  I'm not sure if it was intentional, but I drew parallels to when she went to Tywin and said that she deserved Tywin's attentions because she was his daughter.Â  But again Tywin is overlooking her, this time for her son.
3104	King Tommen	2014-04-20	Edd, half-dead stumbling in (to Jon): "Thought you'd have a couple of wives by now." Gold.
Â 
Tywin telling Tommen that his brother was a terrible king and person and Tommen not disagreeing.
Â 
Blatantly ripping off Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Daario/champion scene.
Â 
Missandei getting embarrassed every time she has to translate people getting vulgar (which is pretty much all the time).
Â 
Golden Company namedrop.
Â 
Pod smuggling in cheese to Tyrion in his boot.
3105	Mr Smith	2014-04-20	Nice to see them showing that Thorne, despite being a dick, actually understands how the Wildlings work, and discouraged his men from charging out after them.
Â 
Appreciated Pod's character development, but hated Tyrion's response.
Â 
I think I may be in the minority here, but I LOVED Arya and the Hound in this episode. Glad to see they're keeping them dysfunctional, and not turning them into some stupid revenge team

					
					
							Edited by Mr Smith, 20 April 2014 - 11:54 PM.
3106	RoamingRonin	2014-04-21	Jaime interacting with Tommen.Â 
Tywin and Tommen reminded me of Ned and Bran.
3107	TheGreenBell	2014-04-21	the scene between Pod and Tyrion. Very well-written.Â
3108	RoamingRonin	2014-04-21	The way the Hound and Arya eat is exactly how I imagine everyone eats in the books.Â
3109	Seneti	2014-04-21	Oh good gods, where do I begin? Maybe I should do this geographically:
Â 
at the Wall:
- Jon giving a really good reason for going to Craster's
- Thorne being a reasonable jerk
- Sam once again showing that he is one of the nicest people in Westeros
- "Sam the Slayer"
- Pyp's "I don't think I can kill a hundred wildlings" XD
Â 
in the Riverlands:
- Arya calling Sandor her father *lol*
- Sandor finishing the prayer *rofl*
- Sandor asking Arya just how many Starks have to lose their heads before she accepts the world as it truly is
Â 
on Dragonstone:
- Stannis reminding viewers of the leeches and his ultimate goal of sitting the IT
- Davos being the only sane man (again), by admitting that while Melisandre's magic might work, soldiers win wars
- Shireen channeling her father
Â 
in King's Landing:
- Tywin's interactions with both Oberyn and Tommen
- Cersei's callback to Tyrion's threat
- Pod smuggling food and candles + ink + paper into Tyrion's cell (and Tyrion's incredulous look of "where did he hide that stuff")
- Pod's undying loyalty and Tyrion's reaction to it
Â 
near King's Landing:
- Baelish and all his dialogue, a lot of which was taken almost directly from the books
- Sansa realizing that Baelish meant it when he said that "they are all liars" and - judging from her looks - the realization that that includes Baelish as well
Â 
in Essos:
- Dany's speech
- Dary pwning Meereen's champion
- Meereen looks amazing
- and last but not least: Missandei being completely embarrassed by what she has to interpret (which I, being an interpreter myself) can relate to
3110	Merysa Serrett	2014-04-21	1) Tywin and Tommen at the Great Sept. I'm liking the new Tommen. The thought of getting "the Talk" from someone like Tywin is both horrifying and awesome.Â 
Â 
2) Tywin and Oberyn. 
	Spoiler Gods dammit, I'm going to miss those two sons of bitches.

Â 
3) Daario's pissing contest with the champion of Meereen.

					
					
							Edited by Merysa Serrett, 21 April 2014 - 12:36 AM.
3111	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-21	Jon Snow continues to speak! It makes me so happy!
3112	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	Tywin subtly checking out the naked girls in the brothel was funny.
I also loved the reference to the Golden Company, even if the scene it was in was only 'meh'.
3113	lizziebeth	2014-04-21	Davos and Shireen always make me happy.Â  They have one of the sweetest dynamics in the show.
Â 
I'm really enjoying the Wall storyline this season, especially Jon's part, which is interesting because I didn't care about that story at all in the books at this point.Â  I'm also liking Sam and Gilly.
Â 
Tywin and Tommen was fantastic. I could listen to Charles Dance for hours on end. Seeing Tywin imparting necessary wisdom to Tommen to start preparing him to be a better king made me inexplicably happy.
Â 
Pod.Â  Ser Podrick Payne does have a ring to it, but the boy is loyal to a fault. Bless.
Â 
Dany's speech and the catapulting of the broken chains into Mereen. Very well done.
Â 
I also am really enjoying Oberyn and Ellaria. I might be one of the few who truly enjoyed it, but the bit about bisexuality was quite well worded.Â  I feel you Oberyn, why deny yourself half the possible pleasure of the world?Â  Hooray for bisexual representation in one of the most badass characters in this 'verse (in my opinion).
3114	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-21	1. Adored the barrels of chains being catapulted on Meereen.
Â 
2. Tywin's pop quiz with Tommen... Great scene
Â 
3. Sophie Turner looking amazing in this episode... Those several minutes she appeared were OK, but she truly looked beautiful tonight.
Â 
4. Daario "expendable" Naharis LOL...
Â 
5. Shireen... Sweet child...


Seriously?, I know you love Sansa, but she only appeared wearing a cloak and in heavy fog for like 2 minutes, in those conditions they could have used an extra and nobody would have notice it.
3115	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	Tywin and Tommen scene wins this episode for me.
Â 
There was so much going on there. It shows how 'on top of things' Tywin really is, and that while Tommen is young and innocent, he is not an idiot. It was also a slap in the face to Cersei and demonstrated how seriously out of touch she is. When she started to protest, Tywin gave no reaction and just ignored her because he was speaking withÂ the most important person in the room and Cersei knew it. The walk out at the end was Tywin 'breaking the chains' Cersei thought she had on Tommen.
Â 
That scene was just absolutely delicious.
Â 
2nd was Tyrion and Pod
Â 
It conveyed a massive amount of information in a very efficient way. It was also paced extremely well paced - first loyal Pod arrives with gifts, then the bad news starts to leak out - and gradually builds until Pod reveals he had been asked to betray Tyrion. The climax was 'This is goodbye Pod'. Its just unfortunate it was overshadowed by the scene above
Â 
3rd Tywin and Oberyn.
Â 
It clearly demonstrated what a political genius Tywin is and again, exactly how on top of affairs he is as well. Perhaps even more importantly it showed how shrewd Oberyn is as well - so much more than a killer with a rampant libido and an incredibly deep character.
3116	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-21	Ser Allister Thorne is awesome.
3117	aussiegirl	2014-04-21	How could I forget Shireen in my episode wrap up? She was fantastic as was Davos.
Stannis was good too. He is right with what he is saying. He's just not a people person so doesn't know how to express it. Man, I sound likeÂ a Stannis fangirl (sorry)
Â 
All of Arya's scenes. She was on point with all 3 characters she interacted with this week.
Â 
Pod seriously looks like Gendry's long lost brother.
Â 
I really enjoyed the actor who played Dontos. I'm sorry he's gone.
Â 
Top 5 performances
Â 
Maisie Williams
Charles Dance
Lena HeadeyÂ 
NCW
Kid who plays Tommen
Â 
Special mention to Kit Harrington who sounds so much more authoritative this year.
3118	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	I really liked Pod and Tyrion's scene when he told Pod to save himself and said farewell.
That was really sad and tearful.
3119	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	Sandor's prayer was hilarious!
3120	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	the scene between Pod and Tyrion. Very well-written.Â 


Â 
 
Â 
Also quite emotional.
3121	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-21	Pod and Tyrion
Shireen and Davos
Sandor's prayer, I burst out laughing at that one
Tywin and Tommen
Littlefinger being very creepy
3122	lostinasia	2014-04-21	Edd, half-dead stumbling in (to Jon): "Thought you'd have a couple of wives by now." Gold.


Was that what he said?! I had no idea the first time, and with a quick rewind I thought he said "I thought you'd have blue eyes by now" (i.e. be a wight). Both lines work, but "blue eyes" sounds more dolorous.
Â 
Like many others, I loved Tywin/Tommen. I wonder if this was being set up, long ago, with Tywin/Arya? If not for those Arya scenes, this side of Tywin would have seemed out of nowhere.
Â 
Tyrion was excellent, but I thought Pod was even better in the jail scene. Well done.
Â 
Ygritte being terrible. I think I liked this, although I'm still not sure. Loved the way the little boy gave her a good long stare. I definitely like how the Wildlings have become more of a danger.

	Spoiler I'm guessing we've been introduced to the archer who will kill Ygritte?

Â 
The little looks on Margaery's face as she wonders just what nana's been up to.
Â 
Davos and Shireen together. Love the way they play off each other.
Â 
Alliser Throne is fantastic.

3123	sati	2014-04-21	Tywin scenes
Stannis scene - his outrage at Davos' suggestions was hysterical
Davos/Shireen scene
Lena's acting
Dany's speech was pretty dope
The cinematography in Sansa's escape was really beautiful
3124	Mladen	2014-04-21	Seriously?, I know you love Sansa, but she only appeared wearing a cloak and in heavy fog for like 2 minutes, in those conditions they could have used an extra and nobody would have notice it.


Â 
I just think she looked beautiful. There is that screenshot when she turns... Turner is a beautiful girl, that's all.
3125	SM4e	2014-04-21	Tywin and Tommen were awesome.
I liked Jaime's little nod to Tommen that he is caring for him.
Davos and Shireen
Sansa and Littlefinger

	Spoiler 
I feel a strange affection to Hizdar zo Loraq. :'D I've got the hope that this storyline might be more appealing than its book-counterpart.
3126	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-21	"I thought you'd have blue eyes by now" (i.e. be a wight).

I'm sure this is what he said.
3127	Janicia	2014-04-21	I really like Shireen. Â I like that she's not just a creepy and sad part of Stannis' creepy and sad entourage. Â She is smart and can see how messed up her life is, but she stubbornly builds her own happiness from very little and lives the best life she can. Â I am really interested in how she'll grow up.
Â 
I was angry with Ygritte, and I think that was good. Â She is a raider. Â She's also an intelligent person making a rational choice for the survival of her people, but she's fierce and it was good to see that. Â
3128	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-21	I'm so glad we're back at The Wall. I need more Jon Snow and Thorne, now!Â 
Â 
Tywin mentoring Tommen, whilst virtually spitting on Joff's name right in front of his corpse and grieving mother. Cold, but such a great scene. No sentimentality, just business. And poor impressionable Tommen; was glad to see he didn't rebuke Tywin about Joffrey either.
Â 
Jaime talking to Tommen. A small moment, but I appreciated it so much.
Â 
Sansa's escape onto the boat was basically just how I imagined it. Glad to see creepy Littlefinger is back... in a weird way.
Â 
I like Shireen in the books, though it's mostly out of pity. She's fantastic in the show, and is really channeling her inner Stannis! Her scenes with the Onion Knight are always so sweet.
Â 
Davos, because more Davos is vital for a balanced diet.
Â 
That wildling raid was brutal; but just how I imagined one would play out. Glad to see Ygritte is still showing her "savage" side.
Â 
Arya remembering that The Hound is the worst shit in all of the seven kingdoms!
Â 
Dany's entire speech and scene. I know she cops a lot of shit on these forums, but I'm still a Dany supporter in both book and show! If Emilia spoke High Valyrian to me I'd probably melt and die.
Â 
Daario starting to feel like Daario. That wink and smirk before owning the Meereenese champion was perfect.
Â 
Pod sneaking in cheese and other supplies for Tyrion, and their heartfelt goodbye! Much like Bran and Rickon's parting last season, it actually surprised me how genuine it felt.
It's funny, Breaker of Chains is my least favourite out of the three so far - but it's a testament to the show that a decent/good episode of GoT is still worth many replays.
3129	The Unborn	2014-04-21	I'm sure this is what he said.


This.
Â 
It was "blue eyes".
3130	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	Call it whitewashing if you will, but I liked Tyrion telling Pod to save himself by testifying against it.
Sure, Tyrion's not your typical do-gooder, but his kindness to Pod and Sansa are the whites in his grey.
3131	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-21	1. Tywin/Tommen
2. Tywin/OberynÂ 
3. That brief moment of Jaime/Tommen
4. Maisie Williams can act again!!!
5. Podrick
6. Sansa fleeing the city
7. Margaery being sadÂ 
8. Daenerys' face when Meereen champion pissed
9. Daario taking a piss after killing the Meereen champion
... that's all. And yeah, Gilly's baby was cute too.Â
3132	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-21	I pretty much loved all of it, except one particular scene that I won't discuss here.
Â 
I enjoyed Pod and Tyrion, excellent scene.
Â 
Tommen and Tywin
Â 
I enjoyed Gilly and Sam until he took her to Mole's Town. Â They are so sweet together.
Â 
I love Jon Snow and his development and the strength he's displaying in speaking up. I cheered when Dolorous Edd and Grenn came back!
Â 
I actually really enjoyed Dany's scene.
Â 
Shireen is starting to steal the show.
3133	Sigrunn	2014-04-21	Arya's lie was fabulous. She's learning how to act and deceive, and I truly enjoyed her scenes and Sandor's question about the seven.
3134	The_Gallows_Knight	2014-04-21	Daario kissing the naked-lady-dagger before throwing it was a nice touch.
Â 
And I really like that we have Janos Slynt back again.
3135	solidviper	2014-04-21	Loved the scenes with Tywin and Tommen, Pod and Tyrion, and of course Arya and Sandor are always magic on screen.Â
3136	K-26dp	2014-04-21	Sansa & Littlefinger
Tywin & Tommen
Arya & Sandor
Davos & Stannis
Davos & Shireen
Tywin & Oberyn
Tyrion & Podrick
Â 
The show continues to do will with one-on-one scenes.
3137	BlackTalon	2014-04-21	That one shot where you can see one of the whore rinsing out a condom, presumably to be reused ... blechhh ... this is not Lord of the Rings for sure ...
3138	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-21	"Sam the Slayer."
Pyp doesn't think he can kill 100 wildlings.Â 
The Hound is not a nice guy, even though you want to like him. This is how it should be.
3139	Bungholes First	2014-04-21	No Strong Belwas? No problem. I loved that it's Daario who fights Mereen's champion. By giving him this opportunity to fill in, he gets to act like a lovestruck schoolboy trying to impress his crush, and by pissing on the corpse it shows his cocky overconfidence and how Dany makes him feel invincible.

					
					
							Edited by Bungholes First, 21 April 2014 - 12:09 PM.
3140	NightStark	2014-04-21	I loved the way Tywin says 'Categorically' when Oberyn asks himif he denies giving the Mountain the order to kill Elia.
3141	Hodor H'ghar	2014-04-21	To me, the funniest part was the dude walking past Tywin in the brothel with his junk hanging out.Â  Â
3142	Tankbuster	2014-04-21	Jon + Thorne = awesome.
Â 
Except the sept part, the rest of the episode was perfect.
3143	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-21	Tywin & Tommen. Tyrion & Pod. Dany speaking to the slaves.
3144	binga	2014-04-21	I love the brilliant acting. Almost everyone is so comfortable in their roles.Â Charles Dance has an incredible presence and magnetism as Tywin. Unfortunately Jorah hasn't had much to do but Iain Glen also adds magnetism and weight to his character. He looks great as well.
3145	boojam	2014-04-21	The CGI - VFX work on Meereen gets a TEN from me, it , so far, is my minds eye picture as GRRM painted it.The opening credit sequence of Meereen goes may super fast wish they had more time to elaborate.Danny's High Valyrian oration is just perfect and Emilia Clarke delivers it just pitch perfect.(Would like to see David Peterson's comments how Emilia did, she has made a few slips with the language.)Ramin Djawadi has some new score for this season, but the end of episode 3 was large scale and sounded very good.
3146	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-21	Tywin and Tommen scene was fantastic, as was the nice little touch between Jaime and Tommen as he passed by. Tyrion's farewell scene with Podrick was poignant and well done, showing Pod's loyalty to him. Shireen/Davos and the kind of uncle/grandfather relationship they have was very good too.
3147	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-21	Also the guy who plays the random farmer was really good for a very minor character.Â
3148	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-21	Also the guy who plays the random farmer was really good for a very minor character.Â 


Â 
Yeah I liked him. You could see he was a thoroughly decent person, but that he was quite intimidated by the Hound nevertheless. Felt bad for him when the Hound stole from him.
3149	SlowLoras	2014-04-21	- The Hound reminding us that for all his snappy one-liners and love of chicken, he's still pretty damn amoral
Â 
- Shireen and Davos - he's like her sweet adoptive uncle, and she's a no-nonsense Mini Stannis
Â 
- Jorah's body language was perfect. When Daario steps forward, you can almost feel him deflating. Forever Ser Friendzoned.
Â 
- Love the reminder that the Wildlings are no idle threat. They are ferocious and dangerous and determined, and Ygritte is no exception. I like that we're getting a Wilding's-eye-view of the battle for the Wall - drives home the fact that they really do need to be dealt with, and soon.
Â 
- Speaking of the Wall, DOLOROUS EDD!! Cleverly slipped in justification for the raid on Craster's Keep - Jon and Thorne's uneasy alliance is paper-thin and prone to fall apart at any time. Kit Harington's doing a great job with Jon so far this season imo.
Â 
- Not much to say about Sansa & Littlefinger except that Sophie Turner has magnificent cheekbones.
Â 
- The Oberyn/Ellaria scene was pretty gratuitous but he and Tywin have excellent on-screen chemistry - you can almost taste the animosity. And Oberyn's pretty pleasant to look at, if I'm honest.
Â 
- I actually kind of liked Daario this time around.
3150	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-21	I loved the Tywin & Tommen scene. I am really enjoying this new Tommen and his age isn't really as much of a deal as I thought it would be.
Â 
I love Oberyn, but the whole brothel background was completely unnecessary. Otherwise, a good scene also.
Â 
The little Sansa/Littlefinger scene was somewhat "dark", which I really liked. LF, you little creeper.
Â 
Surprisingly enough, I liked the Meereen bit. Perhaps because it was so short.
Â 
I hate the fact they made the Thenns cannibals, but the scene with their attack was pretty great.
Â 
Shireen is always a joy to watch. Such a little cutie.
Â 
I love Arya with the Hound and also enjoyed them this time around, but kinda didn't get the purpose of their scenes.
Â 
Tyrion and Pod are also cute together. Such a sweet bond they have.
3151	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-21	Sandor's line when the farmer was praying ("you're gonna mention all seven fuckers?") made me chuckle
Â 
Shireen and Davos were top notch
Â 
Daario vs the Meereen champion was cool
3152	Angmar	2014-04-21	Meereen. Dany's High Valyrian sounded so cool this time around.
Â 
More Jon.  (And Edd!)
Â 
I like Gilly and her baby is very cute.
Â 
Shireen and Davos.
Â 
Tywin and Tommen. Tommen seems shy and insecure, and it seems Tywin will use him for a while. I like it.
Â 
Tyrion and Pod. I don't care if it was cheesy, I liked it.Â 
Â 
Sansa scene.

					
					
							Edited by Angmar, 21 April 2014 - 07:39 PM.
3153	Dudu42	2014-04-21	I've read a lot of criticisms towards new Daario, but I have to tell, I prefer this actor much better.
And his fight with Meereen champion, although short, was pretty nice to watch.
Â 
4. Daario "expendable" Naharis LOL...
Â 

Totally. One of the characters I'm increasingly liking.
Â 
I also like Pod a lot more now. Could he be the only friend Tyrion has (had) in KL? Maybe along with his brother, yes, the only Lannister that loves him, but the way he "loved" his sister in this episode was weird to say the least. (really, "weird" is a very mild word for that)
3154	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-22	Stannis actually got to say something funny! "They don't have enough men to raid a pantry." I lol'ed.
3155	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-22	Watching it again, that was some fantastic camera work in the Meereenese champion fight. I knew this scene would help me decide whether Huisman could pull off Daario or not, and it certainly did. That wink and smirk, cocky posture, kissing his dagger, the ease in which he finished off the other champion, and amused face while he pissed towards the city - I'm sold.
3156	Batman	2014-04-22	Shireen is proving a consistent high point of the show.
Â 
Harrington's acting is on the improve.Â
3157	sam90	2014-04-22	The end of the episode was very good. It's a bit disappointing that Strong Belwas has been left out of the show, he is the one confronting the champion in the book but Daario Naharis is an interesting substitute. That has certainly helped established not only Michiel Huisman in this role but the nature of the character as well. The way Daenyris look at him, is interesting.
Â 
The series is starting at a slow-pace, meaning that after the Red Wedding we are entering grounds where new plots are brewing and change are taking place (first half of A Storm Of Swords) and that looks promising for the second half of the season.

3159	starklinson	2014-04-22	-Jon Snow. I love him this season, and I like that he's becoming a leader, and he's more confident too.
-Sansa getting out of KL - I got very excited
-follow up - Sansa/LF scene. I was getting chills at the amount of creepiness, which is exactly the right effect. 
-Oberyn Martell, enough said. 
-new Daario is growing on me, I must say. 
-Samwell and Gilly acting adorable
-Shireen and Davos is really sweet. 
-Arya and the Hound acting like bosses

3160	BlackTalon	2014-04-23	Can I just say, Meereen looked AMAZING.
3161	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-23	- Shireen and Davos being adorable as usual
Â 
-Â  "the Tullys of Riverrun"Â  :')
Â

Â 
- The entire Tywin/Tommen/Cersei was amazing
Â 
- The setting, lights, etc.. never disappoint.
Â 
- the Hound had some great lines.
Â 
- the Wildling attack was very well shot, and Ygritte is here to kick some major ass.
Â 
- the broken collars' symbolism was pretty neat.
3162	Floop	2014-04-24	Oh good gods, where do I begin? Maybe I should do this geographically:
Â 
at the Wall:
- Jon giving a really good reason for going to Craster's
- Thorne being a reasonable jerk
- Sam once again showing that he is one of the nicest people in Westeros
- "Sam the Slayer"
- Pyp's "I don't think I can kill a hundred wildlings" XD
Â 
in the Riverlands:
- Arya calling Sandor her father *lol*
- Sandor finishing the prayer *rofl*
- Sandor asking Arya just how many Starks have to lose their heads before she accepts the world as it truly is
Â 
on Dragonstone:
- Stannis reminding viewers of the leeches and his ultimate goal of sitting the IT
- Davos being the only sane man (again), by admitting that while Melisandre's magic might work, soldiers win wars
- Shireen channeling her father
Â 
in King's Landing:
- Tywin's interactions with both Oberyn and Tommen
- Cersei's callback to Tyrion's threat
- Pod smuggling food and candles + ink + paper into Tyrion's cell (and Tyrion's incredulous look of "where did he hide that stuff")
- Pod's undying loyalty and Tyrion's reaction to it
Â 
near King's Landing:
- Baelish and all his dialogue, a lot of which was taken almost directly from the books
- Sansa realizing that Baelish meant it when he said that "they are all liars" and - judging from her looks - the realization that that includes Baelish as well
Â 
in Essos:
- Dany's speech
- Dary pwning Meereen's champion
- Meereen looks amazing
- and last but not least: Missandei being completely embarrassed by what she has to interpret (which I, being an interpreter myself) can relate to


Â 
What a perfect list. There was a lot to like in this episode.
3163	Grail King	2014-04-25	Sansa and Littlefinger esp. Sansa's oh f@*k reaction to Dontos death and Â we are all liars here.
Â 
Jon at the wall
I did like Bran and the tree
Shireen and Davos
Tyrion and Pod
Â 
Except for the sept section I pretty much liked the whole show.
Â 
I did think Sam taking Gilly to Mole Town was brainless.
3164	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-25	I really liked shireen's stuff.
Â 
I don't really know where they are going the gilly in Mole's Â Town Â thing. But that brothel looked like you'd catch a STD just walking into the place.
3165	Petyr Patter	2014-04-25	I love Arya with the Hound and also enjoyed them this time around, but kinda didn't get the purpose of their scenes.

Â 
I think this might have been one of the most meaningful and important scenes of the entire series... or at least the Hound's story arc.Â  We are presented with two different philosophies.Â  The first is that of Hoster Tully, "we had our good years and our bad, but we were safe."Â  He protected his peasants as part of his duties as a Lord.Â  Later, we are presented with the Hound's philosophy, those who can't protect themselves are already dead.Â 
Â 
What is important about the scene, was the Hound was offered a choice to buy into the first philosophy.Â  He could have helped protect the farmer and his daughter.Â  Instead, he "broke his code" and became a thief, robbing the man.
Â 
The irony is the Hound's philosophy becomes self fulfilling.Â  It is because of men like his brother and now himself that the weak need protection.Â  In contrast, the more people who buy into the first philosophy, the weaker the reasoning behind the Hound's justifications.Â  If Hoster Tully lived and ruled the Riverlands, the Hound's banditry would be hunted down and punished.Â 
Â 
I think this scene is going to have a longer effect on the Hound's arc than just this episode, though one can never know which way the multiple writers on the show will go.
3166	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-25	I really liked shireen's stuff.
Â 
I don't really know where they are going the gilly in Mole's Â Town Â thing. But that brothel looked like you'd catch a STD just walking into the place.


Â 
Ha, yeah, but I don't think Mole's Town has the same luxury as KL.
Â 
Before Sam and Gilly's talk, we see Thorne and Slynt looking over the new recruits; Raper, raper, thief, thief and raper...
Â 
Castle Black is still a dangerous place for the wrong kind of person - namely, a young wildling girl. Sam thinks it would be safer for her to be around other women and away from his brothers. Obviously this is flawed, seeing as how they know wildlings are flanking them from the south west. But I think this is a case of Sam's jealousy and worry overriding his common sense. Castle Black is the known target for the band of wildlings, so he could expect them to miss Mole's Town completely, or at least have scouts warning beforehand so the villagers have time to make it to Castle Black (thus reducing the time Gilly spends around his brothers).
Â 
But yes, it is a bit of an irrational decision by Sam, but I can understand his worries.
3167	MuchandMore	2014-04-21	Been reading all the social media about the last episode, and I don't understand why THIS is the change that people are not okay with.Â  I watch the show only for those rare occasions where I can watch and enjoy a scene from the book.Â  Obviously, I am usually disappointed.Â  So after 2 years of D&D making a complete mess of things, why is THIS instance of them butchering the story such a big deal?Â  Just because it has to do with rape?Â  In the book, the scene becomes consensual.Â  So if this scene in the show is rape, why doesn't she scream out as loud as she can?Â  Why doesn't she punch and kick?Â  To me, this was just POOR representation of the book, and not the biggest change ever.Â  Furthermore, it goes all with most of the changes D&D make....to add shock value!Â  So why care so much now?
Â 
Who cares if Irri and Jhiqui are dead right?Â 
Â 
Who cares if Missandei is suppose to be 10, and instead is a woman with voluptuous breasts?
Â 
Who cares if they COMPLETELY ruin the House of the Undying?
Â 
Why have Arya kill the Tickler when she can kill Poliver instead?
Â 
Why bother having Barristan kill the Titans Bastard?Â  Why put that incredibly memorable scene in the show?
Â 
Strong Belwass?Â  Who?
Â 
How are they going to have Dany find out Jorrah betrayed her?Â  Not well!
Â 
How will Arya leave the Hound when he is not injured in the fight at the Inn?Â  NO REASON TO CHANGE IT!
Â 
Why do I have to watch Oberyn grab a handful of some guys junk EVERY EPISODE!!!!Â  One little teeny line about RUMORS that Oberyn has had sex with everyone, and D&D run like the wind with it!Â  It adds NOTHING to show.Â  NOTHING!Â  And yet its there...every episode....why?Â  Shock value!
Â 
Who cares if they've COMPLETELY annihilated the Shaetrayal by giving her the laughable scorned lover motive!Â  Making it Tryion's own fault!Â  REALLY!
Â 
I could go on and on.Â  So I ask again....why is THIS scene, after allÂ of the ridiculous and meaningless changes they've made so far, why is thisÂ the one everyone is making such a big deal about?
3168	Strong Belwas!	2014-04-22	Do not downplay the exemption of Strong Belwas!!!
Â 
I think people are upset about this change because Jaime's character is one of the most dynamic in the books. He also undergoes a massive transformation from AGOT to ADWD. Having Jaime rape Cersei sets his character backwards and basically negates his saving of Brienne from being raped.Â
3169	complexphoenix	2014-04-22	People care so much about this particular screw-up because this is a particularly consequential screw-up. It makes Jaime a lot less sympathetic and Cersei a good deal more so. The fact that it has to do with rape does indeed make it a whole lot worse, because rape is a very, very touchy subject.
Â 
Most of the stuff you've cited has to do with minor characters who most people don't care all that much about, or are simple medium translation issues, or are simply communicating something in a different way than it was communicated in the book. This is a major scene involving two major characters who are central to the story which messes up their portrayal. It's also a very memorable book scene that many of us were really looking forward to seeing filmed, and the fact that it's completely ruined by a director who clearly doesn't understand what was going on in that scene at all makes it cause for outcry in a way that most changes aren't.
Â 
The scene turns Jaime into someone who is capable of raping a woman he claims to love in a fit of anger, whereas in the book he wouldn't do that. In the book he is a man in love, desperately horny after being apart from Cersei for more than a year, trying to comfort her in her grief in a way that's clueless and inept and incredibly gross but also well-meaning and ultimately kind of sweet. In the show he's angry with her and trying to hurt her. He says outright that he doesn't care about her feelings. The book version makes him sympathetic, the show version makes him a monster. If Jaime were a minor character people wouldn't much care, but he's a major character and a fan favorite, so the outcry is deafening.
3170	Father of Dragons	2014-04-22	Because many people (including myself) see that this rape kills ALL of Jaime's character development from the last season. Yes, many things on your list irritate myself as well - I'd actually forgotten about some of them - but many of those changes can be justified (TV budget, not needed to move the plot forward, etc) however the fact that they chose to remove Cersei's consent and make it outright rape is not justifiable. We have to remember whenever we see a change that this is a television adaptation and may not have the budget or time to fill in tiny details and adapt the books word for word, but to have a character spend a season "redeeming himself" after a bad first impression and then to destroy all that work is just mad.
On the whole, I agree with you. And I don't want a lengthily argument about this, I was only explaining why people were irritated about this change.
3171	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	Because people like to fetishize a redemption arc. It was not a "change," and the outcry over this is confusing, especially when there was a change to make Drogo's first scene with Dany rape, which was a marked difference from the books.Frankly, I'm disturbed by how many "it wasn't rape in the books!" comments and articles there have been. If the book scene was shown completely unchanged through the medium of TV, it would look similar. Although being inside Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head while reading the book may soften the scene a bit, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s necessarily a good thing. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s certainly a darker moment for Show!Jaime, as heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s attacking Cersei out of a combination of disgust with her and self-hatred for having loved her (canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t emphasize this enough, but I am NOT defending his actions), which is very different in tone from â<U+0080><U+009C>relapsingâ<U+0080><U+009D> with her on their reunion out of habit, though both depict a sexual assault.Â Would a â<U+0080><U+009C>yesâ<U+0080><U+009D> from Cersei at the end of the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene have helped capture the essence of Â the book scene more? Mayhaps. But Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure it should, and frankly I prefer not to have violence against women being depicted as morally ambiguous, as Martin does in both his book and his post on the issue.Â This is a problematic world Martin created. If you think this has a straight-redemption arc, you haven't been paying attention.Â This outcry is confusing, and worrying, but I think it's borne of people wanting the reformed bad-boy, which is not the nature of the story we're being told.EDIT:It's also worth noting that director Graves's remarks really made this controversy blow up, when he said his infamous "it became consensual by the end," when everything about that scene contradicts it. I think a lot of the reaction came to be about someone else's commentary on the scene, rather than the scene itself.

Â 
In the book Cersei's protests are clearly motivated entirely by the fear of getting caught, and she yields to Jaime's advances before he enters her, whereas in the show her refusal is unqualified and she is still fighting him while he's fucking her. Also, and even more crucially, in the book there is no indication whatsoever that Jaime is angry with Cersei or trying to hurt her, whereas in the show he is clearly angry and doesn't care that he is hurting her. So if the scene had been shown more true to the book, it would have been much softer and people would be arguing about whether or not it was rape instead of just yelling at the director for turning Jaime into a rapist.
Â 
The scene in the book is a case of "dubious consent", falling into the gray area whose existence a lot of people hate to acknowledge because it's so difficult to navigate, whereas the show scene is in the black zone of "definitely rape". The director is plainly clueless about issues of consent in general and the meaning of this scene in particular.

3173	Labirints	2014-04-22	Yeah, the changes don't bother me. The show got me in the books, and I will not stop watching even if they make some major changes.

Â 
Right. In my opinion the "shades of rape" is not a useful discussion to have. I understand where you're coming from, and I've heard the book-scene described as "date-rape" whereas the show-scene is thought of as more "aggravated." But I think it's a troubling path to start down if we try and define where rape begins and ends, and if we view some rapes as "worse" than others. The tone is different, aye, and darker, but it's hardly character assassination, and the outrage over "the change" troubles me.Â 
Â 
Like I said, I don't think a "softer" scene is necessarily better. Depicting violence against women as morally ambiguous is problematic, and the conversation which would have followed isn't a good one to have. Even though watching it was really disturbing, in a way I'm glad the show made us deal with Jaime's assault head-on. Martin's book-scene (and his comments on the episode) instead present us with the disturbing idea that we shouldn't view it as "rape" because Cersei "gets into it." It's like completely ignore the moment where Cersei is shouting for Jaime to stop, beating against his chest with her fists and he â<U+0080><U+009C>doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hear it.â<U+0080><U+009D> That is rape.
Â 
There's no such thing as "maybe rape" or "less-terrible rape." Was the tone different? Yes. Not that different, though. So rather than screaming and pointing fingers at the director (who really dug his own grave with his comments, and I can't excuse that), I think we should be more critical of the source material, or at the very least stop holding Jaime up as the redeemed, good knight. He's a grey character in a very, very grey universe. The show stayed true to this. The reason this is the scene that made everyone freak out is because they had false notions about the nature of Jaime's character.
3175	flamingothegreen	2014-04-22	I agree with the original poster.
Â 
I too don't understand why it's such a huge deal that Jaime does rape Cersei (other than obvious moral reasons, but I mean for the character/show itself).
As I said in the previous thread regarding Jaime, I believe both the scene in the book and show are parallel, just slightly less obvious in the show. I guess no one wants to admit - even GRRMÂ - that in the books, it's rape.

	Spoiler "Rape is a type ofÂ sexual assaultÂ usually involving sexual intercourse, which is initiated by one or more people against another person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or against a person who is incapable of valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, or below the legal age of consent."Â  - Wikipedia, but we all know that's what rape is.

Â 
No matter what the reason for Cersei saying "no", it's still no, therefore it is rape. I don't really understand why everyone defends book Jaime for this either - he does rape her, she just "consents" halfway through the act - just like she does in the show, just less visiblyÂ (she kisses back, barely fights back, wraps her armsÂ around him, etc - someone who does not "consent" would not do those things)Â which was probably the only mistake in that scene. I don't think it takes away from his character, therefore I don't think it's a big deal. :/ It's not that far off from the book, whereas other parts hugely differ from the books - so really...nothing to complain about there imo.
3176	Bearded Swordsman	2014-04-22	I also agree with original poster.
Â 
This is not the perefect adaptation that people were waitng for. This show deserves at least D&D to read the books ffs.
Â 
Â Also one more thing. If Davos will travel to Bravoos this season ( WHY EVEN BOTHER THE PLOT ) what is the reason for Arya to not go there and just get i over with ?
3177	Northbound2.0	2014-04-22	Gezz MuchAndMore......all those examples of changes from the book and you didn't even add the butchering of the Mannis!
3178	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	I also agree with original poster.

Â 
I think this is a rather unfair treatment of D&D. The different medium necessitates changes. There's many I disagree with, and there's many I prefer, and then there's "changes" like the scene the OP discussed, which I don't think are remarkable. And that's the nature of adapting something.
Â 
As for your question about Arya, her plotline barely has enough material between AFFC and ADWD to last one season. I think they don't want to rush her there. Just my thoughts. I'd agree that Iron Bank politics might not be the most captivating plot to include.

The reason this is the scene that made everyone freak out is because they had false notions about the nature of Jaime's character.


Â 
I really disagree with you here. Violence against women - indeed, violence in general - is very much a moral issue, but every moral issue has gradations and degrees of wrongdoing. If we can divide homicide into first, second and third degree murder, negligent homicide, various degrees of manslaughter, etc., why on earth shouldn't sexual assault be dealt with similarly? Shouldn't it be obvious that beating a screaming woman to a bloody pulp and then forcibly raping her is way, way worse than having sex with a romantic partner who is feeling conflicted about whether you're in the right place for it, even if those two things do have some things in common and neither one is right?
Â 
The fact of the matter is that there is a very wide spectrum of wrongness in the category of violence against women, and what Jaime did in the show was clearly worse than what he did in the books. In both versions he's a gray character, but the show's portrayal of the Sept scene really does make him seem to be a much worse person than he is in the books.
Â 
The fact that we want to see rapists punished in the real world and want the police and courts to take rape seriously as a crime shouldn't blind us to the fact that ambiguities and gray areas do exist in this issue. Insisting that an issue be treated as totally black and white and refusing to acknowledge the gray areas even when their existence is staring us in the face doesn't do us any good, in my opinion. Denying reality for the sake of intellectual comfort is never a good idea.
Â 
Given how clueless the director is about what he showed Jaime doing in this episode, I think we're likely to see Jaime sympathetically portrayed going forward. Having the same character commit a clear, unambiguous rape and then go and be a good guy after that should probably disturb us more than it would if the Sept scene were ambiguous, because it advances the unfortunate idea that a man can be a good guy even if he's a rapist.
3180	yushkevitch	2014-04-22	I disagree with OP, series fans have gone on and on and on over EVERY little diversion from the books, not just this one ... and that includes the omission of Belwas, which I'm still depressed about
3181	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-22	Agreed. I mean, if a woman gives her partner a blowjob while he's sleeping and didn't discuss it beforehand, then he cannot give consent.
Â 
So that woman is sexually assaulting her husband, technically.
3182	Sleeve of Wizard	2014-04-22	WOW.
Â 
Looked what happened.
Â 
Everyone is talking about Game of Thrones.
Â 
Everywhere.
Â 
All the time.
Â 
I'm sure that was unintentional...
3183	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-22	Should he call the police and cry about the situation when he wakes up and finds out his partner got him off while he was sleeping?
3184	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	<snip>


Â 
Let's agree to disagree. It's not that I don't see shades of grey here, it's that I see it unleashing a very dangerous precedent/conversation. And one I'm very much not interested in having.
Â 
But if we want to talk about this scene, this "change" in particular, I'm happy to. In the books Jaime's partner says no, protests, and beats his chest with her firsts and he ignores this/blocks it while tearing off her clothes. In the show, despite the poor directing, Jaime's partner voices protests repeatedly, even sobs, while pulling him closer. Not dissimilar because they're both rape. Discussing which version makes Jaime looks "nicer" is not a useful conversation.
Â 
Yes, the framing was bad and muddied this. Yes, the director's comments afterwards were insensitive. But it doesn't change the fact that if the book-scene was done through the medium of TV, it would look very, very similar. We're in Jaime's head so it "feels" different, and he's not angry so the tone is different. And we probably want it to be different. But it just isn't. My point is that we're viewing Book!Jaime through rose-colored glasses and the medium of television stripped us of that lens.
3185	MoA«t	2014-04-22	What I think it says about our culture is that many people lack the critical thinking skills that give people the talent to look at the actions and words of a character, and differentiate the subtleties of human behavior and complexities of relationships, and understand that a character's physical ACTIONS (Cersei grabbing Jamie, pulling him towards her, and kissing him passionately - not the actions of a woman being raped), go along WITH their DIALOG ("No", "not here", "it's not right", "stop"), and do not exist separately.Â 
So many people just seem to hear what Cersei is saying, while not taking into consideration her ACTIONS, and the history of these two together, and their complex relationship.Â 
What's disturbing is so many people are able to edit out everything but Jamie being forceful, and completely ignore what Cersei is doing in the scene, to get to their rape scenario, which doesn't exist since more things were at play in this scene, and Cersei's actions do count.Â 
If Cersei Lannister didn't want to have sex, I have no doubt she'd be able to fight off a one-handed Jamie.
Life isn't black and white. Neither is Game of Thrones.

Â 
Okay, I'm not having another day discussing what is and isn't rape. I think to say that people are calling it as such because they "lack the critical thinking skills" to examine actions and words is insulting and fallacious.
Â 
The OP's point is there's been tons of changes to the book material so why this? I think we should stick with that discussion.

Do you think Cersei's actions are those of a woman being raped? Â Just curious.Â 
Â 
Being dismissive of what happened in the scene would seem counter-productive to the argument.
Â 
I think that what is and isn't rape is important to the OP's point, in that it was almost just like the book aside from them taking away her verbal "yes" while they gave her lots of "yes" action. To pretend Cersei wasn't actively reciprocating kissing Jamie is actively cherry-picking things that support your view.
Â 
People saw what they saw. Some people saw rape. Many did not, including the director and the actors involved. This is not a clear-cut anything, because while it's subjective, there are many things in play not just Cersei's words.
Â 
So yes, I too am amazed that people are outraged by this change, when it seems so insignificant in comparison, and it's full of different interpretations.
3188	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-22	Why change it from the books? GRRM and others jumped into this stupid mess with their "change of circumstances, changed the scene". Which pretty much is the reason for all those changes that the OP said.
Â 
Trying to figure out why they changed it? Can I get an episode for them to explain the reason? Or do I have to speculate right now?
Â 
here goes...
Â 
Jaime and Cersei are going to have a "falling out/break up/split up/ whatever you want to call it" so we need to clearly see reasons for it. Jaime not bending to Cersei's will after they continue their dangerous affair... that seems like a good start.

Â 
I'm going to withhold any judgement call on how a woman should look and act while being raped. If a woman says "no" to sex for any reason, and yet the man continues to force himself on her, it is a rape. To say it's not because she "gets into it" is troubling. I'm in a minority that would call the book-scene "rape" as well, even if GRRM disagrees. But as a woman, I find drawing the line on what is and isn't rape very disturbing and upsetting. To have GRRM and Alex Graves say it wasn't because of Cersei giving in (either physically or verbally) has made this entire discussion worse.Â 
Â 
I think your point of them taking away a verbal "yes" and changing it to one in her actions is a good one, even if it didn't really come across well (at least on the first view). You're right in that the two scenes aren't different. Whether or not we label it as "rape" is moot in the context of this thread, so I think to the point of the OP, that there shouldn't be the outrage over this scene that there is, we agree.
3190	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-22	I guess it's so shocking or whatever, because we know how much Jaime loves Cersei and how much he hated what Robert did to her. (+ We saw him defend Brienne when she was about to be raped). Let's also not forget that rape is a very touchy subject, which you shouldn't handle carelessly, even if it's "only" in a a medieval, fantasy world.
Â 
Also, I thought the scene was pretty bad, but what made it so disgusting for me, personally, was the reaction afterwards that it was meant to be seen as "consensual' (or at least at the end).

Â 
I agree completely with you. No is no. Even if a person submits during the act, verbally or physically, it's still forced and the person still said no. I don't understand how anyone can argue that. :/
Â 
As for on topic part, I just don't think there should be a fuss regarding this particular scene. Jaime is still Jaime. There are issues with the show, but I don't think this is one of them as I mentioned earlier in the thread.

Â 
I for one do NOT subscribe that if a woman wears a short skirt she is, "asking for it." I don't care if she runs down the street naked, screaming, "look at me I'm naked!" that isn't "asking to be raped."
Â 
However, having said that, if a woman is saying, "no" "stop" while she's forcibly pulling her "rapist" towards herself and passionately kissing him, I really have to make the judgement call that those actions matter.Â 
Â 
Jamie's actions didn't happen in a vacuum, and I feel like a lot of people are acting as though they did, and that Cersei's actions had no baring on the scene because she said, "no." I find that baffling.Â 
Â 
I feel what is and isn't rape, is at the center of this "controversy" and why so many people are upset.
Â 
I also think that it's important to take GRRM, D&D, Alex Graves, and Lena and Nic's comments into consideration because intent is important.
Â 
As a book reader, I wasn't expecting a rape, and what I saw wasn't a rape, since Cersei's actions were clear that it wasn't.Â 
Â 
I saw a well-shot, complex scene between two very damaged, complex characters, that were totally in-character to what they've been set up to be.Â 
Â 
What I didn't see was a rape involving two characters that didn't have any kind of history together, and (an incredibly strong-willed) woman fighting off her rapist.

Its interesting that some read the book scene as rape. I did not. Â However, the show scene definitely had me thinking rape. Â Perhaps its my cultural bias that "no always means no." Â  But I've also only watched it once. Â I need to re-watch it and really focus on Cersei's actions.Â

Possibilities: a) Jaime's POV so twisted we get really unbelievable version of events in aSoS,  TV-show scene was ment to be like in book, but they fucked it up, because they are no really good showrunners and scriptwriters to begin with...

Pretty sure most here would agree that its out of character for Jamie. Â All you have to do is look at the 60 page locked thread to see that. Â The above posts are more about analyzing the director/writers intent with the scene. Â 
Â 
Did they mean for the scene to be closer to the book and the direction failed? Or did they in fact just want a rape scene?
Â 
As others mentioned in the locked thread, what worries me most is that if it was rape, will Jamie and Cersei continue on like nothing happened? Â Is that scene literally just for shock value? Â Who knows, but it will be interesting to see how this all plays out.Â 
Â 
It feels like the further we get, the more deviation there is from the source material. Â Most likely due to the butterfly effect GRRM speaks of. Â I was more upset about this scene yesterday, but after taking some time to think about it, I think things can still pan out in a way that book fans will be satisfied. Â Although, I have been wrong before!Â

You say it â<U+0080><U+009C>becomes consensual by the end.â<U+0080><U+009D> I rewatched the scene this morning, and it ends with Cersei saying, â<U+0080><U+009C>Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not right, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not right,â<U+0080><U+009D> and Jaime on top of her saying, â<U+0080><U+009C>I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care.â<U+0080><U+009D> It leaves some room for debate. Were you involved with cutting the scene? Was there a longer version of the scene that might have read more like they were both consenting?Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s my cut of the scene. The consensual part of it was that she wraps her legs around him, and sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s holding on to the table, clearly not to escape but to get some grounding in whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going on. And also, the other thing that I think is clear before they hit the ground is she starts to make out with him. The big things to us that were so important, and that hopefully were not missed, is that before he rips her undergarment, sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s way into kissing him back. Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kissing him aplenty.

Â 
Â 
Yes, that is the important question.
Â 
Was it intended as a rape by the director and the showrunners, or did they just monumentally screw up? So far, we're getting mixed signals.
3202	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	All of you are biased cause you read the books and read the interviews read any unsullied post or ask any casual watcher they all think it was rape. Also people are upset because in the books there are at least 3 instance that show how Jaime is against rape and having him rape her was way out of character.


Â 
Which is why the disturbingly violent nature of his relationship with Cersei culminating in sexual assault (both in the books and on film) is so poignant and distressing. In both cases they're a low moment for Jaime. While the tone of it may be different in the books vs. the show (a relapse upon being back vs. a rage-filled attack fueled by self-loathing), it is still supposed to be a very dark moment for Jaime, emphasized by its location occurring on Joffrey's bier.Â 
Â 
Â 


Cersei has a POV she never thinks how Jaime raped her but she thinks Robert did so she at least doesn't feel she was raped by Jaime in the books.


Â 
Which I think speaks to just how messed up their relationship is, and why it's such a corrosive influence on Jaime. To be clear, I'm in no way defending Jaime's actions or insinuating that he's the victim here. Just explaining the dynamics.
Â 
Also I'm not sure where this is in the book. There's a line where she thinks about how sex had only been good with Jaime, but I'm not sure what you're referring to. Could you source it, please?
Â 


However, having said that, if a woman is saying, "no" "stop" while she's forcibly pulling her "rapist" towards herself and passionately kissing him, I really have to make the judgement call that those actions matter.Â 


Â 
As I said, I'm not interested in arguing what is and isn't rape. I'm glad you understand women don't "ask to be raped," but I would hope that you could understand a women voicing protest is where the line is drawn. This happens in both the books and the show, which is why I say they're both rape. And her "getting into it" is both a troubling dynamic within the relationship as well as a dangerous standard to set for the "judgement call" of what is and isn't rape. This isn't your call, and when a woman says "no," it's "no."

Â 
That's a good point. Where exactly do you draw the line between consensual and sexual assault? In the book, Cersei initially protests, but once Jaime had her partially undressed, she gives in. Is that fine?

Â 
As I said earlier (in the text you quoted, actually), I view both scenes as rape. It's certainly an issue with its complexities, which is why I think solidly defining rape is problematic, but Cersei voicing protests in both cases are why I view both scenes as instances of sexual assault.

 I go with screw up.
 They wanted a rough scene and for they just did not think enough to give some yes to clarify consent.
  They are not going to treat it as a rape on the
 show since it was not meant to be.  The fall out from that is to be seen.

Weird as it seems, as this gang of costumed hoodlums converged on Monterey that morning they were on the verge of
"making it big," as the showbiz people say, and they would owe most of their success to a curious
rape mania that rides on the shoulder of American journalism like some jeering, masturbating raven.
Nothing grabs an editor's eye like a good rape.

Â 
Why wasn't it problematic for Sansa being "almost raped" in the riot? Or Brienne?Â 
Â 
And on to a different, but to me equally disturbing trend, why isn't anyone upset by Ramsay hunting a girl with dogs? Is it OK because he had a female side-kick?

Â 
I think the fundamental difference people are having is interpretation of what Cersei said, while disregarding what Cersei did.
Â 
"Not here", "stop, it isn't right", are saying no to location and timing, not sex. Some people think she's saying no to having sex with Jamie, not having sex with Jamie HERE. I understood it to be the latter because Cersei was acting very much into Jamie (grabbing and kissing him) as she was saying it.Â 
Â 
Saying no to logistics isn't saying no to sex, which is why for many people it doesn't play as a rape.
Â 
If a person doesn't want to have sex, why would they actively be encouraging their partner to have sex by grabbing them, kissing them, and wrapping their legs around them? That is the part no one has been able to explain.

If a person doesn't want to have sex, why would they actively be encouraging their partner to have sex by grabbing them, kissing them, and wrapping their legs around them? That is the part no one has been able to explain.


This is how I read the scene in the book, but for some reason the show scene came across completely different upon my first viewing. Â This is however, why I need to watch it again.Â
3212	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-22	My short answer for the OP of the thread?Â  Why this scene?
Â 
Well, as someone put it in one of the other threads, I think it's because the idea of Jaime raping someone, anyone, is about as out of character as it would have been to have Ned not only OK the assassination of Dany, but to offer to do so himself, without the benefit of that notion of hearing the condemned's last words as a bonus option.Â 
Â 
That, and, I think it is a compelation of all the wrongs in the show and in this particular episode itself.Â  Adding it all up, so to speak, along with something that seemingly OOC.Â

Â 
I'd disagree that it was OOC, because I think it really shows what a destructive and corrosive effect Cersei/their relationship has on Jaime, which is consistent with the books (as is the rape). I mentioned this on the second page as well. In fact, Show!Jaime is almost committing a violent act against himself, or rather his past self in disgust/self-loathing as he's raping Cersei (not that it's excusable or justified).
Â 
However, I do see why it seems so jarring for just the show, when Jaime has been portrayed in an overly good light, and without getting is really conflicted inner monologue, it could seem out of place for some.
3214	Angmar	2014-04-22	The problem is people are romanticizing the scene in the books (and the JaimexCersei relationship too, may I add) too much for my taste, declaring it to be beautiful and wonderful just the way it was.
Â 
Rather, turning it into a rape in the show worsens the situation by a lot, but the original scene was also downright disgusting and horrible. Wake up people, JaimexCersei is not sunshine and rainbows.
3215	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-22	Been reading all the social media about the last episode, and I don't understand why THIS is the change that people are not okay with.Â  I watch the show only for those rare occasions where I can watch and enjoy a scene from the book.Â  Obviously, I am usually disappointed.Â  So after 2 years of D&D making a complete mess of things, why is THIS instance of them butchering the story such a big deal?Â  Just because it has to do with rape?Â  In the book, the scene becomes consensual.Â  So if this scene in the show is rape, why doesn't she scream out as loud as she can?Â  Why doesn't she punch and kick?Â  To me, this was just POOR representation of the book, and not the biggest change ever.Â  Furthermore, it goes all with most of the changes D&D make....to add shock value!Â  So why care so much now?
Â 
Who cares if Irri and Jhiqui are dead right?Â 
Â 
Who cares if Missandei is suppose to be 10, and instead is a woman with voluptuous breasts?
Â 
Who cares if they COMPLETELY ruin the House of the Undying?
Â 
Why have Arya kill the Tickler when she can kill Poliver instead?
Â 
Why bother having Barristan kill the Titans Bastard?Â  Why put that incredibly memorable scene in the show?
Â 
Strong Belwass?Â  Who?
Â 
How are they going to have Dany find out Jorrah betrayed her?Â  Not well!
Â 
How will Arya leave the Hound when he is not injured in the fight at the Inn?Â  NO REASON TO CHANGE IT!
Â 
Why do I have to watch Oberyn grab a handful of some guys junk EVERY EPISODE!!!!Â  One little teeny line about RUMORS that Oberyn has had sex with everyone, and D&D run like the wind with it!Â  It adds NOTHING to show.Â  NOTHING!Â  And yet its there...every episode....why?Â  Shock value!
Â 
Who cares if they've COMPLETELY annihilated the Shaetrayal by giving her the laughable scorned lover motive!Â  Making it Tryion's own fault!Â  REALLY!
Â 
I could go on and on.Â  So I ask again....why is THIS scene, after allÂ of the ridiculous and meaningless changes they've made so far, why is thisÂ the one everyone is making such a big deal about?


Â 
Because pretty nothing you mention fundamentally alters a character like Jamie raping Cersei. I mean is Arya's character altered because she killed Polliver instead of the Tickler? Is Oberyn doing anything utterly against his character by grabbing another man's junk?
Â 
You gave only two examples of big alterations to characters. Missiandei is older and essentially taking over Irri and Jhiqui's roles. But ultimately, there is nothing Show!Missiandei is doing that book version would never do (except possibly romantic/sex stuff, but this is hardly a change in character since we have no reason to believe Book!Missiandei wouldn't be when she's older).
Â 
The other is Shae. Yeah, huge alteration. But the difference is Show!Shae is a lot more enjoyable than Book!Shae. So, people accept that easier. It's not like they are taking a popular character and having commit one of the horrible acts she would not do. Also, considering Tyrion is one of the few characters constantly getting whitewashed, I'm guessing Shae's betrayal will be even worse on the show than the books.
3216	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-22	Â 
As I said earlier (in the text you quoted, actually), I view both scenes as rape. It's certainly an issue with its complexities, which is why I think solidly defining rape is problematic, but Cersei voicing protests in both cases are why I view both scenes as instances of sexual assault.


I'm a bit curious. Would you say Â Jaime was raping/sexually assaulting Cersei in winterfell too? Because Jaime is pretty much all over her despite telling him to stop. Â Starting to think this is just another aspect of their fucked up relationship.
3217	Carey Snow	2014-04-22	Cersei has a POV she never thinks how Jaime raped her but she thinks Robert did so she at least doesn't feel she was raped by Jaime in the books.


Agreed. Cersei's initial objections in the book were very clearly about where they were and that they might get caught. She says no because of the septons, the gods, their father etc. Her actions in the book showing her desire for Jaime (kissed till she moaned, consenting and then guiding him in, playing with his hair,Â  etc) did not come across in the show clearly like they did in the book. Thus most of us can see in the book that despite her initial objections to having sex in the Sept, she very clearly wanted to have sex with Jaime and very much desired him. We also know that Jaime was not angry with her nor was he trying to cause her harm because we are in his head. We also know that afterwards neither Cersei nor Jaime considered it rape or a power play.
Â 
The show does not dance this line at all. She clearly says stop it over and over even while he is thrusting into her. Say what you want about body lang, but Cersei's desire for Jaime is not made clear enough.
Â 
I feel that the producer/writers/directors just messed this one up (after a night thinking about it). Cersie's initial objections were never qualified, her desire for Jaime was never demonstrated strongly, Jaime sure looks angry and is not trying to make love to her or comfort her, and this all adds up to the viewers feeling that Cersei got 100% raped (no gray area). I never got that feeling reading the books, and neither did it occur to the characters.
Â 
Also, I am not upset that a rape was done on TV, just what it does to Jaime's arc which is one of the most fascinating in the series

Â 
I don't need or expect someone to agree with me.Â  For me, the book was clear it wasn't rape, people who have sex with each other for years and years can have a sexual encounter that perhaps the some of the world won't understand.Â  I'm going with the GRRM quote about the book content, too, and most of the book encounter was about two people who hadn't seen each other in a long time, much different from what was aired on the show.Â  A dysfunctional relationship, sex included, doesn't necessarily equal rape.Â  I spent all day on this yesterday and already regret the fact I posted here on this thread today.Â  That doesn't change my opinion, though.Â  I'm just not devoting more time to this today.Â 
Â 
But, it's not about the show Jaime at all for me, and no, he hasn't been portrayed in an overly good light.Â  That cousin killing is also something he wouldn't do.Â  Be that as it may, I don't need or want someone to always agree with me, it IS fiction and hopefully, just a polite exchange of ideas on a fictional story and characters.Â
3219	Angielina	2014-04-22	I posted this on the Winter Is Coming website under Nikolaj's interview and wondered what thoughts people might have about it.
Â 
Â 
Wow what a lightening rod of a scene! My first reactions to this scene were silence, sadness, anger, and confusion, as I am a huge Jaime fan. I read all the books, and it is clear to me in the book, at least from Jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s POV, that this was a consensual act, an act of reconnection. After reading Martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s comments above, it does make sense why the two are different, given the set ups. And yes, although as Nikolaj has stated that the scene was not intended to be an all out rape, I definitely perceived it this way. So for the purposes of this entry, that is the framework I am coming from. I do not think though, whether the incident is interpreted as a rape or not changes how I conceptualize this scene in terms of Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character development.
After getting some space from this, I tried to sort through what is the form and function of this interaction for Jaime in the series. I am a clinical psychologist by trade, and specialize in trauma, so I view GOT and its characters through this lens.
I have only watched the scene once, and read the books once. Rape is about power and control, as stated several times in this thread, not about sex/intimacy. I think in this scene we finally have the gritty truth about the nature of Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and Cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship, and Jaime states this â<U+0080><U+009C>Why have the Gods made me love such a hateful woman.â<U+0080><U+009D> This is a huge realization for Jaime that he acknowledges that the â<U+0080><U+009C>loveâ<U+0080><U+009D> relationship he has with his sister is in actuality based on his powerlessness over his need and dependency for her. He accepts the truth of this at this point I believe only because he has a template of how kind and caring a woman can be in his experience with Brienne. Yet, still this knowledge can not change his ultimate action to reconnect again with Cersai, and then further to rape her- which is very tragic for Jaime. Never underestimate the power of familiar.
The other point is that both Jaime and Cersai are trauma survivors, from the death of their mother, Cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rapes by Robert, and Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s loss of his hand. So likely from the very beginning of their relationship they may have been attempting to comfort themselves from the loss of their mother via their sexual relationship with each other, though this is difficult to definitively know. From the very beginning then, their relationship is fraught with power and control issues, and attempts to gain mastery over trauma and loss, as well as comfort each other in the pain of that loss.
This rape scene for Jaime I see in this light and Nikolaj has said that this scene for Jaime is about his powerlessness. Yes, I agree with the above comment by the Criminal Justice worker that perpetrators view rape in this light. Perpetrators are also sometimes trauma victims, as is the case with Jaime.
In coming back to Kings Landing, Jaime realizes all he has lost, including his masculinity, status, and intimacy. It is in this one moment with Cersai that he is trying to obtain mastery over a life where he ultimately has had very little power due to his father and Cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manipulation of him over the course of his entire life. There is some foreshadowing of Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s attempts to gain power in his family in his interaction with Tywin when his father gives him Oathkeeper. In a twisted way, in raping Cersai he can temporarily gain the masculinity and intimacy back.

In a twisted way, in raping Cersai he can temporarily gain the masculinity and intimacy back.
What is ironic though, is that he is quite conflicted based on his above comment on the â<U+0080><U+009C>gods making him love a hateful womanâ<U+0080><U+009D> in that he needs to connect with her but he also wants to disconnect from her. The rape he performs on Cersai accomplishes both of these goals, he can connect to her but disconnect from her simultaneously. The rape also becomes a container for the rage and shame he feels about his own identity (Oathbreaker, Kingslayer, etc), although he tries to numb his own feelings by saying â<U+0080><U+009C>I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Finally, this scene seems to bring forth again the theme of Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s loss of his ideals in the broader context of his life. Even his beliefs about rape can be on the table to be compromised in the â<U+0080><U+009C>rightâ<U+0080><U+009D> moment. Furthermore, Cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s order to kill his own brother challenges his own ideals about his love and loyalty to his family, a core character ideal for Jaime. We will see what becomes of this.
So although I do not like the scene at all, as I am a Jaime fan, it does fit with his character development as I understand it from reading the books and the series. The difference is that the series seems to be pushing the issue of Jaime becoming a tragic figure more quickly.
I remain a Jaime fan because NIkolajâ<U+0080><U+0099>s portrayal is artful and the complexity of this character is fascinating. I do hope it all ends well for Jaime.
I welcome any comments, just my take on things.

3220	Itchyscratch	2014-04-22	A lot of couples who enjoy rough sex have a safe word to stop the action if it's getting too extreme. Perhaps Cersei's safe word is 'No' which is why she didn't utter it once in that scene.

3221	the silver queen	2014-04-22	My reading of the books gave me a clear impression that Cersei and Jaime's sexual relationship often had the "push-pull", "no-means-yes" aspect to it. I don't like that personally, but I clearly read it that way, and even though she says no, it's obviously consensual. The only sexual scenes that are given to us have this element in them, and gives me the impression that Cersei likes that dominance from Jaime and always plays that "game".Â 
Â 
I feel like the show tried to display that (with Cersei kissing back and such) but simply failed to make it clear enough. But yeah, it's much more rape-y and forceful and angry than in the book, but I actually felt that story-wise, it was consistent with the strained relationship that the Show has written due to Jaime being back early and Cersei not wanting him. I don't feel it ruins Jaime character entirely. I think it shows him being very angry, frustrated and desperate, combined with him playing their game as usual. That combination made it look like rape. And yes, the writer who did the scene made the mistake of not adding some dialog that could have helped if he truly had intended for it to be consensual.Â
3222	Chebyshov	2014-04-22	I'm a bit curious. Would you say Â Jaime was raping/sexually assaulting Cersei in winterfell too? Because Jaime is pretty much all over her despite telling him to stop. Â Starting to think this is just another aspect of their fucked up relationship.


Â 
I don't think we have enough information to really judge that scene. Bran does overhear her saying "stop it" and "please," but for all we know Jaime was trying to do something specific she didn't like. They do seem to be in throes of passion during that scene, but we are also seeing at from the vantage point of a seven-year-old who thought they were wrestling.
Â 
You bring up a good point though! The fact that discomfort and assault is standard practice for them really speaks to just how fucked up their relationship is. As was mentioned earlier in this thread, Cersei doesn't view their encounter in the sept was rape, and perhaps it's only her opinion that counts here. But because she is a character in a book and a show, I think we should be able to have this conversation.Â 
Â 
Also one thing I've been meaning to say to everyone in this thread is that if it wereÂ you, or your daughter, or any other loved one in Cersei's position, I think you'd want both Book!Jaime and Show!Jaime to listen to her and take her objections seriously. Whatever label we want to attach to it, Jaime's actions in both cases were not justified, and deeply messed up.
Â 


Â 
<snip>
I don't need or want someone to always agree with me, it IS fiction and hopefully, just a polite exchange of ideas on a fictional story and characters.Â 


Â 
I certainly see where everyone's coming from, and it is a difficult and ambiguous issue to sort out. I fall on one side of it, and I'm still working through my feelings, even after talking about it ad nauseam for 48 hours. I definitely can get on board with the call to civility!

3223	Fat Trell	2014-04-22	I really don't see the argument that the book scene was rape. It was rough and disgusting, but it was consensual. Cersei never says she doesn't want to have sex, she says they shouldn't do itÂ  because they'reÂ in a public place, their father is about, and because they're in a holy place. She initiates the intimacy in the first place. At the end she was very enthusiastic. NotÂ 'her body reacted with arousal' enthusiasm, but 'telling her lover that he is home and for him to continue' enthusiasm.Â It was forceful, not forced.
Â 
Its important to note this is Jaime and Cersei as well. Two people who have apparently been having a continuous hidden sexual relationship. Its doubtful this is the first time one of them has said "its too risky," or "not here." This could very likely be par for the course for them. Cersei never recalls this scene as rape iirc.
Â 
The show scene is rape. Its done out of anger and self-loathing. Cersei never gives consent. She clearly says no repeatedly.
3224	Itchyscratch	2014-04-22	Â She clearly says no repeatedly.


Â 
She doesn't say no once. Watch it again.
3225	Fat Trell	2014-04-22	Â 
She doesn't say no once. Watch it again.


Â 
Because "Stop it" has such a different connotation than "No."
Â 
Way to go.
3226	Carey Snow	2014-04-22	The problem with the Cersei was into it arguments is that it claims it wants nuance but ignores the fact that she could have been saying no, but still she is being kissed by someone she loves and who she misses. People can say no to sex and still be attracted or tempted by the person. Also, This wasn't a scene where seh said no, went back for it and didn't say no again. The last show was her saying no and him saying he didn't care as he pushed her to the floor. Â  A rape is any sex that is coerced. It doesn't have to be fought against 100% of the time. Â If her yes cancels out her no then doesn't her no cancel out her yes? You are choosing to say that the signs that she was into it out weight the no, others do not believe that.
Â 
Also I don't know how anyone saw anything. That scene was so dark and they had so many items of clothing on the only clear message I felt we got about the scene was their voices, which specifically were Cersei being against it and Jamie not caring


Â 
Â 
That is true. But let's say a husband wants to have sex before the kids get home but the wife does not want to because they may come home a little early and they will get caught, but she is ok with kissing. The husband makes out with her while massaging her and continues to say hey, we can do this before they get home, it will be exciting. She is tempted but still feels the risk of it is too high and says no again. They continue to make out (which she does not fight and is enjoying) and things are getting hotter. He asks again, and she says, "Ok take me, take me now, but make it quick" and they have sex.
Â 
Is this rape, because she said no at first and he continued to pursue? (and clearly this is not what happened in the show)

Agreed, the show is clearly rape. She says stop it the entire time.
3228	rocksniffer	2014-04-22	My mind wandered to a passage from HST:s Hells Angels:
Â 
Â 
Why wasn't it problematic for Sansa being "almost raped" in the riot? Or Brienne?Â 
Â 
And on to a different, but to me equally disturbing trend, why isn't anyone upset by Ramsay hunting a girl with dogs? Is it OK because he had a female side-kick?


Â 
or ok that he is cutting off bits of theon and eating dick shaped sausages...
Â 


I'm a bit curious. Would you say Â Jaime was raping/sexually assaulting Cersei in winterfell too? Because Jaime is pretty much all over her despite telling him to stop. Â Starting to think this is just another aspect of their fucked up relationship.


Â 
Â in winterfell it is my recollection that she didn't say stop until she saw bran and jamie didn't...though it was all him tossing kid to his supposed death out the window. something that i find even more reprehensible, sorry ladies you know i love y'allÂ 
Â 
Â 
and i must add that the show and the books (all of which, i have read repeatedly over the years) are both meant to stand alone. everyone that finds themselves upset by the changes must never have enjoyed a film adaptation of a novel or story...and personally i find that hard to believe...
Â 
as for rape, my response is this, yes if a women says no a MAN should stop...period...in the real world, but in this circumstance...a fictional world full of incest and child abuse, etc...my oldest niece (aged 51) summed it up for me when she observed that she couldn't hardly call that rape because any grown woman should be able to get away from a one handed man trying to reach inside his multi-layered armor, undo his drawers and get his shit out, lift up yards of dress and find a hole in the dark...
Â 
...nuff said...Â
3229	Swagwell	2014-04-22	Can we all at least agree that banging your sister beside your dead incest bastards body is wrong?

Â 


Â 
You're actually getting closer to the other part of my peeve with this scene. In addition to making Jaime a rapist, they made Cersei a wuss.Â  Book Cersei was crazy and and evil and not nearly as smart as she thought she was, but she was no one's wuss. If book-Jaime had tried that crap, book-Cersei would have slammed his unhealed stump hard and put a knee in his nuts and left him groaning on the floor. Jaime is the powerless one in that scene in the book -- begging Cersei to love him, to marry him even -- and Cersei's the one in charge.Â 
Â 
Yet on the show, Cersei is suddenly a victim. Why?Â  They've already stripped Cersei of so much of her agency by making her nicer.Â  Instead of deciding "Hell no, I won't give Robert any kids!" and aborting his kid (not nice, but powerful!)Â  she bears him a son who dies in infancy instead, because that's nicer and it makes it look like she actually tried to be a good wife to him and he didn't appreciate it.Â 
Â 
Book-Cersei was a nasty piece of work but she had agency.Â  She made her own choices and acted on them -- to the detriment of all Westeros, yes, but at least she wasn't passive and helpless.Â 
Â 
Show Cersei is a weakling, and that's all wrong.

3231	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-22	Just today I told a friend that everything was out of control already and people was criticising Jaime while apparently forgetting that Jaime told Brienne that in case of rape, she shouldn't fight and think on Renly.It's Jaime and Cersei, brother and sister. They fucked next to a drunk Robert, probably in his own bed. They don't care for morals nor others' feelings. I'm sure it's not the first time they have done anything like it. To each their own, every couple knows how they work in bed. Or in their son's graves.

Lets just say its on the same level as raping a woman under the swinging corpse of her husband, even if you send some livestock for the bastard later on...
Â 
I read someone saying that when Tyrion is whoring later on and throws up all over the whore that it is somehow rape. I disagree, it is disgusting and morally despicable, but not rape in any shape or form.
Â 
In this particular scene, my problem isn't really whether it is consensual or not, the incest in a church next to your childs corpse kinda trumps that.
Â 
But maybe im a prude.

Because "Stop it" has such a different connotation than "No."
Â 
Way to go.


Â 
She says "Not here" and "it's not right" because of where they are, just like in the books. Her body and her actions never say no. Grabbing Jamie to pull him towards her, passionately kissing him back before they're ever all the way on the floor, and finally wrapping her legs around him, all have zero to do with "no" and everything to do with "yes."
Â 
"Not here" = "I don't want to have sex HERE" â<U+0089>  "I don't want to have sex at all."
Â 
Her actions in the scene clearly make her a consenting adult.
Â 
If people have to rewatch the scene with the sound off in order to concentrate on Cersei's actions, then they should do so.

Tyrion definitely raped that whore. She was repulsed by him, and he knew it, and he forced her anyway.Â  Tyrion had always been kind to whores before that and preferred the ones at least willing to pretend they were enjoying him.Â  He was violating his own moral code there and he knew it.
Â 
And I don't get how consensual sex can ever be worse than rape. That's not how my morality-o-meter is calibrated.Â

or ok that he is cutting off bits of theon and eating dick shaped sausages...
Â 
Â 
Â in winterfell it is my recollection that she didn't say stop until she saw bran and jamie didn't...though it was all him tossing kid to his supposed death out the window. something that i find even more reprehensible, sorry ladies you know i love y'allÂ 
Â 
Â 
and i must add that the show and the books (all of which, i have read repeatedly over the years) are both meant to stand alone. everyone that finds themselves upset by the changes must never have enjoyed a film adaptation of a novel or story...and personally i find that hard to believe...
Â 
as for rape, my response is this, yes if a women says no a MAN should stop...period...in the real world, but in this circumstance...a fictional world full of incest and child abuse, etc...my oldest niece (aged 51) summed it up for me when she observed that she couldn't hardly call that rape because any grown woman should be able to get away from a one handed man trying to reach inside his multi-layered armor, undo his drawers and get his shit out, lift up yards of dress and find a hole in the dark...
Â 
...nuff said...Â  


Totally agree with your niece. And especially regarding Cersei Lannister. I don't think the strongest woman in all the Seven Kingdoms would put up with allowing Jamie to rape her for even a microsecond.Â

Â 
Can you rape a whore if she's taking your money and voluntarily doing her job? Â If she refuses your money, and her services to you, and you still fuck her against her will, that's not only rape, but theft.
Â 
I don't remember, is that what happened?

She says "Not here" and "it's not right" because of where they are, just like in the books. Her body and her actions never say no. Grabbing Jamie to pull him towards her, passionately kissing him back before they're ever all the way on the floor, and finally wrapping her legs around him, all have zero to do with "no" and everything to do with "yes."
Â 
"Not here" = "I don't want to have sex HERE" â<U+0089>  "I don't want to have sex at all."
Â 
Her actions in the scene clearly make her a consenting adult.
Â 
If people have to rewatch the scene with the sound off in order to concentrate on Cersei's actions, then they should do so.


Â 
Upon re-watching the scene, she did participate more actively than I had previously thought. However, she never ceases telling Jaime to "Stop it." And all her pulling him towards her is countered by almost simultaneous pushing away. Its grayer than I had thought. But it isn't gray at all(imo) in the books, and it really jades Jaime's character. Â 
Â 
Ultimately it was probably just a cheap move to get some more audience sympathy from Cersei as she embarks on the battle for Tommen against Tywin and later the Tyrells.

2:I'm just saying that incest is also very wrong. So is banging in a church next to a dead devilspawn born of that very same incest. Without the reunion angle that was in the book the whole scene changes and becomes more predatory, but to me it is basically the same disgusting act.

3243	Rockroi	2014-04-22	A woman can reject sex because of the location. Â 
A woman can reject sex because she does not like the way the man looks.
A woman can reject sex because she is menstruating. Â 
A woman can reject sex because its Thursday.
A woman can reject sex because its too hot.Â 
A woman can reject sex because she doesn't feel like it,
A woman can reject sex because she just watched an episode of Welcome Back Kotter while looking at blueprints for a death laser while eating pistachio nuts out of the hollowed-out skull of Ghengis Khan. Â 
Â 
NONE of these things change the fact that she can say 'no; and the event should stop. Â Immediately. Â And to move beyond that is rape. Â 
Â 
Look, I can think up a whole bunch of reasons why the scene's execution can insinuate consensual sex (she brought her legs up, she kissed back, she held him; the fact that Cersei and Jaime have had sex many many many times and maybe many many many times Cersei has said 'no' and never meant it; etc etc etc), but they would have to be balanced against the fact that she said 'no' for what appeared top be 296 times or so; she pushed him away and didn't ever seem like she wanted to have sex... in a church... over the corpse of her recently murdered son. Â 
Â 
That's really not the point.
Â 
The point is that the show screwed the scene up (give them credit- they have far far far far more hits than misses). Â They should have put in more cues that would give us an indication that it was consensual (as it was clearly in the book). Â The show should have taken the time to understand the scene instead of just plowing through it (pun... intended) Â But it exemplified a major concern insofar as ... had the jackasses just read the book (something us book readers are chided for asking others to do) they would have had better grounding and more info to avoid this problem.
Â 
And it is a problem. Â For one, they pulled the rug out from under Jaime's well-earned and well done redemption arc; they made the entire episode about rape (because that ALWAYS helps, right Tosh?); they gave "haters" ammo they wanted to decry the show and they will likely fall asunder HBO who may have to take a closer look at future episodes to make sure they don't run afoul of the "Outrage Police." Â (and yeah, they made Cersei more sympathetic). Â 
Â 
They submitted a sloppy, poorly executed scene and made a problem where there didn't need to be one. Â I mean, frankly, when you run close to the SUBJECT of rape, you really should be careful and be very certain you are not making a scene that looks and seems a lot like rape. Â 
Â 
The show screwed this one up, not the people reacting. Â And they can't fix it. Â 
Â 
Be careful next time. Â

Agreed 100%. Which is why it makes me concerned when people view the scene in the show as so drastically different than the books. She says "no" in both cases. The tone is different, darker in the show given that Jaime is lashing out in anger, but I'd hardly call it a ruining of his redemption arc. Mostly because I think his redemption arc is a myth.
3245	teemo	2014-04-22	What is the big controversy? Â The director fucked up. Â GRRM has said that it's consensual in the book, so you can't try to say, "oh but it wasn't consensual in the book either" and GRRM had nothing to do with the show scene and refers to the "butterfly effect" again. Â The director says it was meant to come off as consensual at the end, but if it was that clear cut there wouldn't be so much controversy...therefore, the director screwed up. Â Wow, something was poorly executed in the show. Â Big surprise there!
Â 
Come on, people, it was consensual in the books. Â GRRM said it - is that not enough for you?

It is drastically different. Â In the show it looks like rape, in the books GRRM has confirmed its consensual.Â

I think that raises more questions about GRRM. To me, a woman saying "no" repeatedly and punching a man in a chest while he "doesn't hear it" and tears off her clothes is not "consensual," and the notion that when she eventual gives in and "goes along with it" makes it so is troubling. I see why given Jaime and Cersei's dynamic this could be construed as consensual, but that's not where I land.Â

2: Is raping a corpse worse than rape or better?


Â 
It's worse to rape a living person who suffers, and will continue to suffer, than it is to rape a corpse that does not suffer.Â 
Â 
I don't get why you would put something disgusting (necrophilia) down as worse than something vicious (rape.)Â
3251	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-22	The more full quote from GRRM:In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffreys death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself, that she has lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before her. Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her.
The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and he and Cersei have been in each others company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why [producers] played the sept out differently. But thats just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.
Also, I was writing the scene from Jaimes POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You dont know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing.
If the show had retained some of Cerseis dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline.
Thats really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.
3252	YourMomsBox	2014-04-22	It was a disgusting scene. A piss poor representation of what happened in the books. Jaime doesn't care what Cersei thinks and proceeds to rape?
Book fans seem to hate it, and for the many casuals it will ruin his character who was in the process of a nice redemption arc. Way to go, D&D. That to me torpedoed an otherwise pretty solid episode.
3253	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-22	Oh look. This again. *extremely unamused face*
Â 
Look. Heres the skinny. The scene. It was rapey as all get-out. Deal with it. The only thing i disagree with about the outcry is that its absolute character assassination. If there isnt actual in-universe objection from Cersei about this whole affair in next week's episode, im going to assume that it was a bad direction fumble and not meant to completely derail the characters. Though i am of the mind that that particular director should be sacked. I dont like that scene and i dont think we have to like that scene. But the endless discussion of what is and what isnt rape is gross and repetitive. This whole thing is probably going to teach the show runners a lesson: Even the tiniest of omissions of dialogue make all the difference in the world. Tread Carefully.
Â 


WOW.
Â

Â 
Everyone is talking about Game of Thrones.

3254	Fjordgazer	2014-04-22	My reading of the books gave me a clear impression that Cersei and Jaime's sexual relationship often had the "push-pull", "no-means-yes" aspect to it. I don't like that personally, but I clearly read it that way, and even though she says no, it's obviously consensual. The only sexual scenes that are given to us have this element in them, and gives me the impression that Cersei likes that dominance from Jaime and always plays that "game".Â 
Â 
I feel like the show tried to display that (with Cersei kissing back and such) but simply failed to make it clear enough. But yeah, it's much more rape-y and forceful and angry than in the book, but I actually felt that story-wise, it was consistent with the strained relationship that the Show has written due to Jaime being back early and Cersei not wanting him. I don't feel it ruins Jaime character entirely. I think it shows him being very angry, frustrated and desperate, combined with him playing their game as usual. That combination made it look like rape. And yes, the writer who did the scene made the mistake of not adding some dialog that could have helped if he truly had intended for it to be consensual.Â 


Â 
This comment sums it up well. And it's by a woman.
Â 
I've been stating more or less this opinion since yesterday and been called names, accused of being a potential rapist and such. It's outrageous.

Maybe you should do a re-read.

This is offensive and uncalled for. I have spent a lot of time thinking about this, rereading, rewatching, going through material only tangentially related. I even started out arguing for the "grey area" of the book scene, but as we got deeper into the conversion I became more and more uncomfortable with my position and it shifted my viewpoint. My read of the scene is borne of the content in the book. Rape is coerced sex. This is the situation in both the books and the show. To say I should reread it because you disagree is just rude. 
I'm aware I'm in the minority in my assertions, and at this point it's falling on deaf ears. So much of this dialogue troubles me, which is why I've been trying to assert my claims throughout this thread despite the fact that I really had no desire to revisit the topic for a second day in a row. I'm bowing out now, but I just want say that if anyone happens to find themselves in Book!Jaime's situation, I really hope they have more respect for their partner and take their objections seriously.

Â 
I don't get why you would put something disgusting (necrophilia) down as worse than something vicious (rape.)Â 


I have honestly never really thought all that much about these things with regards to better or worse, and since your moral scale seems very well defined I'm just curious.
Â 
If we are to judge the severity of a crime by the amount of sufferation it inflicts on the victim, would you agree that drugging somebody before you rape them is better than using brute force? I mean because it kinda dulls the suffering? If a person didn't know they were somehow victimized are they better off?

Â 
Are you Implying that whores that he treated kindly weren't repulsed by him? Of course they have, Tyrion is pretty much an abomination. They had to do it anyway because of the pay. In fact, I'm sure mostly whores are repulsed by a lot of men they have to serve but do it anyway.

Â 
"Sufferation" is an interesting word choice...apparently that's Rastafarian?
Â 
Suffering of the victim is definitely an issue when it comes to meting out punishment. It's not the only issue, but it's important.Â  For example, if you decided to steal a person's kidney, you would get a harsher punishment if you carved them open without anesthesia than if you drugged them first -- but you'd get a severe punishment either way.
Â 
But a crime that involves no suffering at all is a minor crime.Â  The suffering in the case of necrophilia is on the part of family members who don't want their loved ones' remains treated that way and some on the part of society that doesn't want you spreading any diseases you pick up that way.Â 
Â 
Let me ask you this: If you had a daughter, how would you rate the following:
Â 
1) She is raped
2) She is flayed first and then raped
3) She dies in a drowning accident and her body is raped
Â 
Would you want the criminal in (3) treated more harshly than the rapist in (1) and (2)?
Â 
If you want to do some independent reading on moral reasoning, I'd suggest Jonathan Haidt's "The Righteous Mind". He has a proposed six-axis system for moral reasoning that seems like a pretty good model.

(Isn't this the reasoning that the raper Jamie executes in ADWD tries to use? "Everyone else had her too, what's the big deal??"Â  And Book Jaime, who for all his flaws is no rapist, treats that with the contempt it deserves.)

But this is the kind of subject that gets trickier as you immerse deeper in universes more unlike your own. What are the morals of rape in a slaving society? I reckon the clients of a slave prostitute judged themselves as "good" as long as they treated her kindly, and this assertion was accepted as correct.

Â 
Tyrion didn't treat her kindly at all, however.Â 
Â 
There's nothing "blurry" at all about Tyrion's behavior there and even Tyrion doesn't think there is, so I don't know what you're getting at here. Tyrion was/is on a downward slide in the books, and becoming a rapist was a sign of how far down he's fallen.Â
3266	Lady of the Falls	2014-04-22	In books Cersei did say no sometimes but she always gave in, I think it was just a thing they did she never said yes until she heard what she wanted from Jamie. Because this is a t.v. series, I think the creators of it felt they couldn't go into detail about every character in book because of time. Â Seems they're translating every book into 1 season/per book. I don't agree w/this decision I think they could of used as many seasons as they wanted to tell a more detailed/cohesive story. Â In t.v. series when Sir Barristan told Sir Mormont he didn't attend the small council meetings & if I recall he didn't in the show (lmk if i'm wrong) I think they're going to keep Mormont in because Barristan also didn't hide his identity like he did in the book. I hope i'm wrong about them keeping him in, I haven't been fond of the deviations from Book series. Â In a interview w/the 2 creators of t.v. series they said Martin asked who they believed Jon Snows mother was and based on what they said they were given permission to do it,when others had failed. IMO I don't think its was enough,i'm re-reading the books and realizing how many things they have left out/changed or just didn't elaborate on and though I like the series, I would of liked it more if I hadn't read the books.

3267	Howdyphillip	2014-04-22	These threads just keep getting more and more offensive as time goes on. I have stayed out of the discussion for now, but I just wanted to correct an obvious error in interpreting the text, and a general lack of understanding. The girl that Tyrion raped in ADwD was not a slave as Pentos does not allow slavery. She was a sex worker that did not have the ability to refuse because of implied coercion by Illyrio Mopatis.Â 
Â 
It is a complete fallacy that sex workers can not be raped. I have known several people that work in that profession, and it is a common occurrence. The bottom line is that any person at any time has the right to refuse sex, and if it is forced on them against their will, it is rape. Even and especially for sex workers. Â

The girl that Tyrion raped in ADwD was not a slave as Pentos does not allow slavery. She was a sex worker that did not have the ability to refuse because of implied coercion by Illyrio Mopatis.Â 
Â 
It is a complete fallacy that sex workers can not be raped. I have known several people that work in that profession, and it is a common occurrence. The bottom line is that any person at any time has the right to refuse sex, and if it is forced on them against their will, it is rape. Even and especially for sex workers. Â 


Â 
Oh, I think we're discussing two different rapes. I'm talking about the redheaded Westerosi girl Tyrion rapes in Volantis who is specifically said to be a slave. (This is in the whorehouse where Jorah grabs him.)
Â 
The blonde (?) girl in Illyrio's house was another issue, but also rape.
Â 
So yeah, Tyrion's down for two.Â 
Â 
Wonder if they'll keep that in the show....
3270	MoA«t	2014-04-22	This is offensive and uncalled for. I have spent a lot of time thinking about this, rereading, rewatching, going through material only tangentially related. I even started out arguing for the "grey area" of the book scene, but as we got deeper into the conversion I became more and more uncomfortable with my position and it shifted my viewpoint. My read of the scene is borne of the content in the book. Rape is coerced sex. This is the situation in both the books and the show. To say I should reread it because you disagree is just rude. 
I'm aware I'm in the minority in my assertions, and at this point it's falling on deaf ears. So much of this dialogue troubles me, which is why I've been trying to assert my claims throughout this thread despite the fact that I really had no desire to revisit the topic for a second day in a row. I'm bowing out now, but I just want say that if anyone happens to find themselves in Book!Jaime's situation, I really hope they have more respect for their partner and take their objections seriously.

I think you're taking offense where none was meant. 
I would suggest a reread for anyone who disagrees with GRRM about his own work. You're entitled to your opinion and how you feel about what happened, but you're not entitled to tell the author he's wrong about a story he wrote. You're also not entitled to tell two consenting adults how they should feel about how they have sex, based on what you think you saw while watching them. 
The reason it's clearer in the book is because it's in Jamie's head and rape is not his intention. We aren't in anyone's head for the TV scene so it's different, but for many, like myself, it comes off the same as in the books, with Cersei objecting to the location, not the act, which she clearly participates positively in. 
This scene hardly has a universal rape reaction. Many got a rape feel from it and many didn't. However, once the creators tell you what they were going for, everyone should accept it and move on, instead of forcing their own meaning on something they didn't create. 
If you don't get that it was consensual when the creators made it clear it was supposed to be, and many viewers saw that, perhaps you are the one who needs to view it again without your preconceived 2014 notions that a woman means no even if she's stripping a man naked and mounting him like Myranda mounted Theon, and try to see what the creators were going for, and not force your meaning on a scene you had no hand in creating yourself.
3271	Swagwell	2014-04-22	Â 
"Sufferation" is an interesting word choice...apparently that's Rastafarian?
Â 
Suffering of the victim is definitely an issue when it comes to meting out punishment. It's not the only issue, but it's important.Â  For example, if you decided to steal a person's kidney, you would get a harsher punishment if you carved them open without anesthesia than if you drugged them first -- but you'd get a severe punishment either way.
Â 
But a crime that involves no suffering at all is a minor crime.Â  The suffering in the case of necrophilia is on the part of family members who don't want their loved ones' remains treated that way and some on the part of society that doesn't want you spreading any diseases you pick up that way.Â 
Â 
Let me ask you this: If you had a daughter, how would you rate the following:
Â 
1) She is raped
2) She is flayed first and then raped
3) She dies in a drowning accident and her body is raped
Â 
Would you want the criminal in (3) treated more harshly than the rapist in (1) and (2)?
Â 
If you want to do some independent reading on moral reasoning, I'd suggest Jonathan Haidt's "The Righteous Mind". He has a proposed six-axis system for moral reasoning that seems like a pretty good model.


Â 
 Â You got me,, I listen to a lot of reggae and dancehall and apparently my english is patois-tinged from travelling the caribbean extensively. For instance I know the meaning of excellent words like bandulo, mannish water or Bull-bucka (the latter being a person stubborn enough to butt heads with a bull).
Â 
Â 
But I digress...
Â 
Â 
I agree with much of what you are saying and of course rape is one of the worst things you could do to another person, it just feels like SOME people(not meaning you) consider it the end-all crime that can never be forgiven, while they seem fine or at least apathetic towards other equally horrible and reprehensible acts. I wonder if it has to do with that it is a sexual crime mixed up with a violent crime? Or is it that it is a predatory crime where one part is weak and the other strong?
Â 
Ah NVM, interesting discussion though. thx.

Â 
Yeah, I was going to go "Sufferation is not a word!" but, having been burned by being wrong on vocabulary before (rare, but it happens), decided to Google it before going all grammar Nazi -- and Rastafarian popped up.
Â 
I don't think that people believe that, for example, raping someone is worse than the crap Ramsay does.Â  The reason this issue has flared the way it has is because the definition of rape -- and sadly many of the excuses and justifications for it that we've seen on the boards here -- is very much a current topic in the Western world, particularly the United States, and is starting to be an issue in the non-Western world as well.Â  When it comes to things like flaying someone alive, there's no argument about definitions or the damage done, nor is there any debate about Ramsay Snow's morality.Â 
Â 
Rape, however, is a different issue.Â  People are responding strongly to it not because they believe it's worse to be raped than to be flayed -- it's because there's no argument about flaying. Or tossing kids from windows.Â  Or eating people.Â 
Â 
That's the heart of it and why it's being argued aggressively.Â 
Â 
If, by some weird historical chance, slavery were still an issue in the United States right now, we'd be arguing over whether or not Daenerys had any right to take the slave soldiers from the Astapori the way she did. Not whether or not she actually improved their lot by doing so, mind you, but whether or not freeing them was the morally correct thing to do.Â Â  We only argue about issues that reflect on our current time and morality.
Â 
And yes, the popular fiction of the day does stir up massive amounts of debate when it tackles subjects of current interest. This is why Harriet Beecher Stowe is credited with helping to bring about the American Civil War due to her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin*. It was actually a really terribly written book (even for that day!) but she tackled slavery head-on and it became a massive bestseller, and pro-slavery people wrote several fictional rebuttals to her anti-slavery views, called "Anti-Tom literature," which were popular in the South.Â 
Â 
This sort of reaction is not anything new.
Â 
*There's a popular but probably false anecdote than Stowe actually got to meet Abraham Lincoln, and he shook her hand and said "So you're the little lady who started this great big war."Â  That likely didn't happen, but the fact that the anecdote is all over the place indicates that people thought it was reasonable that it could have.

3273	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-04-22	Honestly my biggest issue with this show is that Ramsay was not involved in the death of those two children.
Â 
It was Ramsay who killed the boys. Â Yes, Theon gave the ok, but he didn't do it himself and he hated Ramsay/Reek for suggesting it.

Tyrion didn't treat her kindly at all, however.Â 
Â 
There's nothing "blurry" at all about Tyrion's behavior there and even Tyrion doesn't think there is, so I don't know what you're getting at here. Tyrion was/is on a downward slide in the books, and becoming a rapist was a sign of how far down he's fallen.Â 


Â 
I didn't remember that part very well in ADWD, but you're right, deep down, it is rape. Speaking in general though, every esentially good man who ever made use of slave sex workers is a rapist? That's where i'd say it gets blurrier.
3276	Fjordgazer	2014-04-22	I think you're taking offense where none was meant.

Â 
Pretty much this. The thing is, my first impression was: "well the showrunners got themselves a rape controversy here, are they happy?". But the more you watch the scene, the more you feel it's the dialogue that failed to convey the consent the way it should have.

3277	Otho Bracken	2014-04-22	My wife has a minority opinion that the show scene wasn't rape. She says that Cersei's body language didn't match her words. Cersei could have thrown one-armed Jaime off any time & screamed for guards. By the time they were on the floor he leg was wrapped around him. She could have turned it into much more of a scuffle than she did.
Â 
Â In our modern world, we're all taught that "no means no". But in Westeros, you gotta smack someone hard to mean no, and I think Jaime and most of all Cersei knows this. She has no problem smacking people when she means it.
Â 
I think the director was too subtle in showing "consensualness" given his audience.

Yeah there's a lot to this. And I agree that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a bad book, regardless of its significance. I am happy to find people who share the opinion.Â

Â 
I'd say that about 90% of people are viewing the TV scene as rape.Â  That's where the balance of popular opinion lies. Similarly, the balance of popular opinion about the book scene runs about 90% in the other direction -- not rape.Â 
Â 
As for the creators of the TV show, one is on the record saying it was definitely rape*, and the director says it "starts as rape and turns consensual", which is the nastiest part of this whole scene (seriously, shame on you, Graves.)Â  So we've got one creator saying "Oh yeah, it was rape" and one making the completely insane assertion that a rape can turn into a not-rape (ugh.)Â  We also have Graves saying, contradicting himself: ""I'm never that excited about going to film forced sex."Â  So the creators of the show viewed it as rape except for Graves' insane excuse-making flip-flopping. (Or as my housemate put it when I mentioned that line, "Good God, was he trying to stir up a shitstorm??" Who knows, maybe he was...)
Â 
*Edit: I found the exact quote on rape from David Benioff in this episode's video diary: "It becomes a really kind of horrifying scene, because you see, obviously, Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s body right there, and you see that Cersei is resisting this. Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s saying no, and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forcing himself on her."
Â 
Â 


Â 
Yeah there's a lot to this. And I agree that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a bad book, regardless of its significance. I am happy to find people who share the opinion.Â 


Â 
Oh yeah, it's atrocious. Ask anyone with a literary background about the quality of that novel and they'll hem and haw and go, "Well...it was the style of the day..." and try to change the subject. And it was the style of the day, but even that style could be done better or worse, and Stowe did worse. But the impact was wildly disproportional to the quality of the work, thanks to the topic and the way she approached it by taking the slaves' point of view, which wasn't something white authors had done at that point.

Â 
I doubt it. I'm not confident about percentages, but having watched with an unsullied viewer and having gone through the unsullied reviews of the episode I think the overall viewer reaction is pretty one sided that it was a rape scene. Its among the people that are more accustomed to delving deeper, the book readers, that the divide is really happening. But still, I think if they gave a false impression of the scene to most show-only viewers, they missed the mark.Â

He did episodes 8 & 10 (which is kind of a scary thought...he got the finale...) and they're already in the can, so no taking that back,Â  but I think I heard somewhere he's not slated to direct in Season 5? I don't know if that was wishful thinking on someone's part -- it might be a bit too early for them to have absolutely settled on directors for all of Season 5's episodes already but I don't know how far ahead they work so maybe not.
Â 
Anyway, he seems to be otherwise a reasonably competent director, and sadly he's by far not the only director in Hollywood with a drastically skewed vision of human sexuality, particularly the female half of it. (**SIGH**) I doubt this will affect his career one way or another.

The internet has a way of blowing every controversy out of proportion. I'm not denying that the majority's first impression (like mine) was rape, and that the final cut of the scene failed to set the mood the directors intended. What i find preposterous is that people are reacting towards those who conclude (after thoughtful reflection) that it was not rape by calling names and being extremely judgmental. This is a very twisted relationship between twisted individuals (especially Cersei), and it's wrong to assume that reading the scene as "not rape" is equivalent to condoning actual rape in the real world and failing to recognize women's boundaries.

Benioff says it was rape, Graves said it was rape (and then changed his mind or something...just...ugh.)Â  So as for the "mood" they intended to set, it seems pretty clear it was rape.
Â 
My take on it is that after they sent out the screeners and started getting feedback from the reviewers, they found that any reviewers who were also book fans had the reaction, "WTF? Why is Jaime a rapist now??"Â  This caused Graves to unwisely try to backtrack by claiming that Jaime wasn't actually a rapist because, uh, Cersei, uh, eventually consented (post rape consent?) or some garbage. This, of course, just made things worse.
Â 
They'd have been better off if they'd just said, "Oh, yeah, we decided to make it rape instead of consensual, and here's our thinking on why it works better this way....blah blah blah."Â  Then they'd just be facing angry mutterings from book readers about Show Jaime no longer being recognizably the same as Book Jaime, plus some queries as to why, exactly, they feel like ASOIAF actually needs even more rape than GRRM already put into it.Â  I think that's a very valid question to ask -- why have Drogo rape Dany? Why have Jaime rape Cersei?Â  Why make that call? Don't things suck enough for the women of Westeros already?Â

That's a good point. Where exactly do you draw the line between consensual and sexual assault? In the book, Cersei initially protests, but once Jaime had her partially undressed, she gives in. Is that fine?

It was coercive rape in the book. She only consented to get it over with.

This. I'm not blind, nor was I hallucinating. Cercei's actions matter.

Seriously, stop. You're wrong, and so is he. To say that action somehow negates verbal non-consent shows a disturbing lack of understanding where rape is concerned. Educate yourself.
3298	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-22	Here's a radical theory: A lot of you are extremely frustrated because Jamie spent all of season 3 redeeming himself from that terrible act he committed in season 1. If Jamie raped his sister than you all are right his character has been set back. So maybe it's D&D giving a big middle finger to the book readers and trying to say real life isn't always going to entail a straight road to redemption. Perhaps they felt he was becoming good too fast and they decided he needed to have a relapse of evil in the most monstrous way possible. Or maybe it was just a representation of how woman are treated in Westeros. Who knows.

3299	DaveyJoe	2014-04-22	The way I see it, Jaime is behaving like a rapist in both the book and the show. Â Does the fact that Cersei eventually gives in excuse Jaime's rapacious behavior prior to that moment? Â If you read the scene she's pleading with him and he's not hearing her, I don't think he would have stopped if she didn't give consent. Â I think the big difference is not Jaime, but Cersei's behavior. Â Cersei is more of a three dimensional character in the show and acts more like a realistic human being, rather than the cartoonish psychopath from the books.
3300	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-22	I wonder what the morning after scene is going to be like...but I'm sure it'll involve Qyburn.
3301	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-22	Bottom line is this isn't the end of Jamie's character. He's not completely ruined. Drogo raped his child bride and he still became a fan favorite by the end of the season.
3302	Sun	2014-04-22	This is from AV Club:
Â 

Â 
However, asÂ Rolling Stoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>sÂ Sean T. CollinsÂ points out (viaÂ The Washington Post), Benioffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s commentary for HBOâ<U+0080><U+0099>sbehind-the-scenes featuretteÂ forÂ â<U+0080><U+009C>Breaker Of Chainsâ<U+0080><U+009D> at least seems to acknowledge that itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rape:

Â 
It becomes a really kind of horrifying scene, because you see, obviously, Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s body right there, and you see that Cersei is resisting this. Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s saying no, and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forcing himself on her. So it was a really uncomfortable scene, and a tricky scene to shoot.

Â 

Â 
Â 
Sounds like rape to me.Â 
Â 
I think the scene was written as a rape scene, that was the initial intention as obvious by the words used is the scene, but then sometime before shooting they decided to take it more in the book's direction where she eventually consents. However, the director fucked up in that he believed that filming her holding on to the table with one hand while pushing him away with the other and saying "don't" while sobbing means consent. Â And that is troubling!
Â 
The fact that neither the writers or director felt it necessary to add verbal consent to the scene if frelling troubling!! That the director thinks that cutting away to her holding on to a table while we hear her saying "don't!" represents consent is frelling troubling! Â 
Â 
And speaking from a storytelling POV, the fact that they found it logical to have a character who lost his hand in protecting another character from rape, commit rape himself, is frelling idiotic.Â 
Â 
On all levels this scene was a F*** up!Â

I don't think it's really idiotic. Especially after reading the psychologist's post #53. Bad people trying to redeem themselves slip up all the time.

Â 
Rape is not a frelling slip up!! Rape is repulsive to Jaime. Jaime, the man who lived his entire life having known only one woman, is not a man that uses sex as an expression of anything but love! It's not an expression of power to him, it's not a physical desire that he submits to (otherwise he would have shared his bed with another woman by now". His entire existence he has equated sex with love and therefor only with Cersie.Â 
Â 
The scene in the sept in the books was an expression of how much Â he loved and missed his sister/lover. The sept scene in the show is an expression of anger and a need to dominate Cersie. That's not Jaime. Sex to him was never a weapon or a tool. Â With all due respect to the psychologist you reference, but he is wrong, imo.Â
3307	Fat Trell	2014-04-22	"...and then Jaime comes in and he rapes her."

http://www.hollywood...al-scene-697733


Â 
"That's one of the best speeches in the series, and it's the times they live in. The Hound is saying, "Arya. You're a lot like your father. Don't be too much like your father or you're going to end up dead.""
Â 
Further indication of what's fundamentally wrong with the show. So many people involved(directors to actors to the show runners themselves) either haven't read the source materialÂ or don't understand the characters and their motivations.
Â 
Arya is not like Ned. AryaÂ doesn't operate like her father did at all. Arya hides and runs and kills in cold blood. Arya has no problem lying and deceiving and is extremely jaded by this point. Sandor is supposed to be an observant guy. He reads people well. This isn't a speech he should be giving. Especially when one considers his relationship with Sansa.
Â 
I was surprised toÂ see that Emilia Clarke constantly refers to the book.
3308	rocksniffer	2014-04-23	look children she is gripping the nub at the end of the scene and never once says NO....rape...that is stretching the action...for me jamie is obviously pissed off that she has shunned him since his return and now demands he kill his brother with no more evidence than a hand gesture by a dying man....
Â 
Â 
...if i was jamie, having fucked her with consent all of my adult life (and only her), i might have been tempted to take some at that moment when he realized she was a heartless hateful bitch...
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
She was a slave girl forced into prostitution. She got no money from it and had no choice.Â  Tyrion knew this but forced her anyway.Â  It was rape.
Â 


Â 
if that is rape then every sex scene in this show...except the red viper and his beloved basterd....is rape...which woman has had sex in this show that wasn't taken against her will or at least for free...because even the whores don't get to keep the money...it goes to the brothel owner...
Â 


My wife has a minority opinion that the show scene wasn't rape. She says that Cersei's body language didn't match her words. Cersei could have thrown one-armed Jaime off any time & screamed for guards. By the time they were on the floor he leg was wrapped around him. She could have turned it into much more of a scuffle than she did.
Â 
Â In our modern world, we're all taught that "no means no". But in Westeros, you gotta smack someone hard to mean no, and I think Jaime and most of all Cersei knows this. She has no problem smacking people when she means it.
Â 
I think the director was too subtle in showing "consensualness" given his audience.


Â 
my niece agrees and so do i...though i just re-watched it and while jamie is not wearing armor (as my niece first commented) he is in fact not dressed to fuck easily...
Â 
...like always this is just this asshole's opinion...take it or leave it, at your pleasure

Â 
I disagree:
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her, only hunger. Her mouth opened for his tongue. "No," she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck, "not here. The septonsâ<U+0080>¦"Â 
"The Others can take the septons." He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Mother's altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath. She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes. When he tore them away, he saw that her moon's blood was on her, but it made no difference.

Â 
He's plainly forcing himself on her, his actions here are not out of love, but lust/power. Â Reading that scene I really don't think Jaime would have stopped for any reason. Â Cersei not reflecting on that moment doesn't prove anything, and I suspect it's not the first time in their relationship Jaime was aggressive. Â Didn't he pull the same thing in Winterfell, where Cersei thought it was too risky to have sex?
Â 
Â 
Â 
Was interested to read the summary for this chapter at Tower of the Hand:
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Jaime goes to the sept to see Cersei, who is praying for Joffrey. Ser Osmund guards the door and does not recognize him at first, but finally lets him through. Cersei is disheveled and amazed to see him. She tells him of Tyrion's threat to turn her joy to ashes2 and says he killed Joffrey. Jaime is starting to believe this, but he recoils at doing what she wants, killing Tyrion in his cell. He forces himself upon her, and they have sex.

Â 
Â 
Here's the full scene:
Â 
Â 

Â 
She kissed him. A light kiss, the merest brush of her lips on his, but he could feel her tremble as he slid his arms around her. â<U+0080><U+009C>I am not whole without you.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â

She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes.Â When he tore them away, he saw that her moonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blood was on her, but it made no difference.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Hurry,â<U+0080><U+009D> she was whispering now, â<U+0080><U+009C>quickly,Â quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime.â<U+0080><U+009D> Her hands helped guide him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D> Cersei said as he thrust, â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>reÂ home.â<U+0080><U+009D> She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair. Jaime lost himself in her flesh. He could feel Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heart beating in time with his own, and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Note that she consents before he enters her. She consents verbally. Her hands even help guide him.Â 
Â 
If you still disagree, then that's your prerogative, but it won;t change my mind.Â

3312	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-23	Outside "quickly" and "sweet brother" the show visual shots were quite well to the book.  It was a dark and nasty moment.
 That Jamie has a "Raptist" stigma to all Non-Book fans is a horrendous fail of the show.  Though with the book as much it was consenual in it did have a violence all the same.  I find it amazing how many over-romanticized the scene.

Â 
First, showJaime isn't the same than bookJaime. And two, if we're mixing both of them, Jaime is a man who almost killed TWO kids so his sister/lover would be happy and they could continue their incestuous and amoral relationship. I definitly disagree on this action being worst than what he has done before, It's not that RAPE is repulsive for Jaime. Jaime IS repulsive. He told Brienne "you know what? You're about to be raped: don't fight them and think of Renly". If we're going to use our 21th Century morals, then that speech is quite condemnable because it's what many women were told about 30 years ago about the subject of rape: don't fight and let him do as you will so you won't die. And while Jaime don't use sex as a weapon, Cersei does: she uses sex BEFORE he asks him anything, either be in the KG, kill Arya or who knows what else. Does Cersei gets the same treatment Jaime does? They both are disgusting, to be honest: their relationship has caused a war and they don't even care about how many people have died just because they couldn't get away from each other. Let's not try to put this single scene as the top of the horrible things Jaime has done because it's definitely not the worst, specially in show.
Â 
And you think the scene in the books is about love? Jaime pretty much says "oh, fuck, you lost a kid? I'll give you other!", like it's not a big problem and that hasn't cause any more problems. Her son just died and you can't keep your paws away from her? He loves her so much that he didn't care if suddenly their father could have enter? Or a sept? Or a Tyrell? I'm sure that Jaime has somehow loved Cersei before, but that was nothing but lust.

Everything i've heard from people associated with the show suggests it's intended to be at least partly consensual:
Â 
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau -
Â 
So is it rape?
â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes, and no,â<U+0080><U+009D> says Coster-Waldau. â<U+0080><U+009C>There are moments where she gives in, and moments where she pushes him away. But itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not pretty.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Alex Graves -
Â 
"Well, it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for them ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle."

What about her grabbing him, pulling him towards her and kissing his face off?  Or was that a different person?
 And I only hear her say, "Not here, it's not right." I never heard her say, "get the fuck off me." The only difference to the book scene is Jamie arrived in KL weeks ago, so Cersei has no reason to say, "you're home now." 
I guess they should have added a, "yes, hurry", for those that refuse to acknowledge Cersei's actions in the scene, and are only going by her words. 
It must be amazing to go through life having everyone speak the absolute truth every moment, and never experience conflicting actions/words from anyone ever. I can't even begin to imagine what that's like.

I missed the version where Cersei was drugged and tied up so she couldn't do anything. Could you link that please?
Seriously, saying Cersei did nothing, and acting like we women have zero say or control over ANY of our actions is pretty sexist. We don't all just lay there. 
Cersei was complicit and responded to Jamie sexually. She never fought him off. Why not do you suppose?
If it was rape, why didn't Cersei fight, or scream?
3328	Fjordgazer	2014-04-23	I'm going to break my silence vow just to point out that comments like those by "Dany's slave" are what is wrong with this discussion. Inflammatory, accusatory, and uncalled for.
Â 
No, everybody knows what the hell an actual rape looks like. You'd have to be a moron (in the original sense of the word) to miss that. Way to nitpick what NCW said in the interview to send your point home. He actually explains it quite well. That we see the scene (after some reflection) as Nikolaj sees it does not imply that we don't know where real world women's boundaries stand... and i'm starting to repeat myself too much now.
Â 
Ok, now i'm seriously going to stop. I finally start commenting in the ASOIAF boards and in a few days, this turns into the bloody Jezebel forum. Way to go.
3329	MoA«t	2014-04-23	I know that kissing someone back and clutching at them passionately instead of showing actual signs of resistance isn't the behaviour of a rape victim.
I agree. But apparently that doesn't count in this instance. Not sure why.
And really great post Fjordgazer. Totally agree. And you nailed it with the Jezebel comparison.

Â 
Not only were those things extremely brief and not nearly as clearly represented as her physical reluctance, but they take place before the pushes that I referenced. You do realize consent can be withdrawn, right? If she's on the floor, actively pushing him while crying and saying "stop it, it's not right", then I'm inclined to believe that the sex is not at that stage consensual regardless of her previous willingness. Also, "you're home now" isn't what establishes the consent in the book scene, it's more the "do it quickly, do me now". If they want to establish the consent visually as opposed to through the dialogue then it isn't a problem but don't have her actively resist seconds before the conclusion of the scene and then suggest that it becomes consensual by the end.
3331	MoA«t	2014-04-23	Not only were those things extremely brief and not nearly as clearly represented as her physical reluctance, but they take place before the pushes that I referenced.

Grabbing someone and pulling them towards you isn't physical reluctance. I'm baffled you could equate the two. 
 Wrapping her legs around Jamie when they're on the floor isn't pushing him away. How did you miss all that?
It seems as though you're saying the most self-willed, determined woman in all of Westeros wouldn't physically fight off a one-handed man who was raping her. Are you serious? That is some pretty big character assignation right there.
3332	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-23	I missed the version where Cersei was drugged and tied up so she couldn't do anything. Could you link that please?
Seriously, saying Cersei did nothing, and acting like we women have zero say or control over ANY of our actions is pretty sexist. We don't all just lay there.
Cersei was complicit and responded to Jamie sexually. She never fought him off. Why not do you suppose?
If it was rape, why didn't Cersei fight, or scream?


Â 
Point one. I made no such claim.
Â 
Point two. I made no such claim. Ref: your previous post about belittling complete strangers because you disagree with them.
Â 
Point three. 'Never fought him off'... despite verbal protestations and clear attempts to pull away and push him away. 'Never' is not true.
Â 
Point four. I disagree that 'the victim didn't fight hard enough' is a valid defense.
3333	Sarah the Terror	2014-04-23	I'm sorry but the best they could do was have Cersei grab a table? That's supposed to show us her actions meant she wanted it? 
The reason people are upset is simple. We are upset because we love the characters that Martin has given to us. We enjoy the scope that we don't get very often. And for the people in charge of this show to make Jaime do that is so extremely un-Jaime-like is what sucks. 
There is a lot of rape in GRRM's world. But never once has GRRM made rape okay. It's never fucking okay. But leave it to HBO to take something GRRM uses in one way and translate it into something okay. The fact that there is any argument over this situation makes me hate this fandom. Most of us have read the five books. And me, as a feminist, has never been upset by anything Martin has done. Martin himself seems to be a pretty big feminist. This is something else. 
This is rape for kicks
This is rape for talk
This is rape for the sake of what we are doing here.
3334	Sapphire Isle	2014-04-23	unbelievable how some people honestly choose to 'interpret' the onscreen action as Cersei consenting.
Â 
That wasn't consent. Plain and simple.
Â 
Somebody saying 'it's not right', protesting till the end,Â physically and violently struggling against the restraint, isn't clear enough for you?
Â 
So she's saying 'it's not right' but wrapping her legs against Jaime at the same time, that's a logical interpretation for you?
Â 
Amazing.
3335	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-23	Way to judge complete strangers, and dismiss and belittle everyone who was actually involved, all because you disagree with them.


Â 
Who am I judging? I'm not saying any of these people are "evil". I'm just pointing out they don't know what an actual rape looks like.
Â 


I know that kissing someone back and clutching at them passionately instead of showing actual signs of resistance isn't the behaviour of a rape victim.


Â 
The "behaviour" of a rape victim? Many times if a person is being overpowered by the rapist, they'll just "give in" and feign enjoyment to make the rapist happy. It's out of fear that if you do continue to resist, scream, etc., that you'll be hurt even further. Not hypothethical, I know people who were hurt even further for resisting or screaming for help.
Â 
Besides, other than when Cersei was kissing him, she was pushing him away the whole time, afterwards. Even in the very end she was pushing his face away.
3336	D-Shiznit	2014-04-23	She literally shoves his face 3 seconds before the scene ends and says "don't, Jamie, don't" and Jamie responds with "I don't care"..... Clearly not rape......

She kisses him back while grabbing at him after he's made his intentions clear. And when they're on the floor, she's clutching at a drape (which as others have pointed out is typical iconography for passionate, consensual lovemaking in TV/cinema) instead of making an effort to push him off.

Â 
I'm not going to address your denial of glaringly obvious visual evidence like the multiple pushes Cersei directs towards Jaime. I imagine that she wasn't capable of pushing him off once he was on top of her because he's heavier than her and she was afraid of what he might do considering he was already being abnormally aggressive.

Her protesting is very hushed and more in line with someone saying "we're going to get caught if we do this" rather than "help, i'm being raped".
Â 
Even when she says "it's not right", that's just because she knows it's wrong for them to have sex next to their dead son, not because she's repulsed by the thought of having sex with her lover. She's basically conflicted about doing the act there, yet still returning some of his affections because she's not completely unwilling.

Â 
Rape is not like in the movies. You'll be hard-pressed to find rape victims who were screaming out of their lungs for help. It does not work like that.
Â 
And the reason is very relevant to the discussion. She might want to have sex with him somewhere else, because doing it near her son's corpse would traumatize her. He disregarded that, yet she kept resisting.

And yet you continue which proves you're completely detached from your own actions towards other people, yet you claim to be the expert on sexual abuse to the point the rest if us are stupid. 
 Yes we know what rape looks like. Some of us personally. So stop belittling people, and implying they're stupid just because you disagree. 
Cersei doesn't push him away. She recoils from his fake hand. But after he kisses her, she pulls him towards her, kisses him, and never pushes his face away. Stop making shit up to prop up your opinion. 
If you cannot get past the audio to see the action that's actually happening on the screen, watch it with the sound off. 
"Not here" isn't the same as "I don't want to have sex with you."
All you're doing is cherry-picking Cersei's dialog, and making up shit in the scene that didn't happen. 
As for the behavior of the rape victim, we aren't talking about rape victims in general, we are talking about the fictional character of Cersei Lannister, and still no one can tell me why, if she was being raped, why didn't she kick and scream and tear his hair out, and fight like Cersei Lannister?
3342	Northern_Star	2014-04-23	Weird how people call this rape. Maybe you should pay attention to all the scenes around Jeoffrey - this is Cersie Lannister you are talking about! The very same cersie who said that women have the greatest weapon between their legs.
It was her way of getting jamie to kill tyrion.
3343	Sapphire Isle	2014-04-23	the "audio off" thing is kind of morbidly hilarious.
Â 
Dude, if a woman says, loudly and clearly, "it's not right", that's no.
Â 
You can't tell the audience to not listen to her vocal protests. If she's vocally protested, then done. She's not consenting.
Â 
You can't separate the audio tape from the viewing experience.
Â 
You cannot try to creatively reinterpret the physical conduct onscreen and create a grey area where none exists.

It doesn't matter who it is. Â When someone says no and you don't stop, it's rape. Â Period. Â

3345	allie4645	2014-04-23	After rewatching the scene, I wasn't pushed into the "It was a poorly directed consensual scene." If anything, it seemed more violent on the second go around. When I first watched it, I didn't notice that she rejected his first kiss and stepped a few feet away and refused to look at him. He then gets angry at her physical rejection,Â aggressively takes hold of her, and forcibly dominates her. She kisses him for a bit, but kissing is not a green light to bang her in a holy placeÂ next to her dead son. I also see her pushing against his chest and struggling when he is on top of her on the floor, thrusting, making it clear that at the moment of entry and after, she was still not interested. Maybe that wasn't meant to look like her struggling, but to me it did. Furthermore, her continuation of verbal protestation along with his repeated "I don't cares" makes this pretty clearly rape. If the director meant to include signs of physical consent, that was straight up a terrible idea. If someone is verbally denying a sexual partner/aggressor but giving "physical consent" then that's a problem because the interpretation of the potential/actual victim's actions are in the eye of the aggressor. She could be struggling, but he could interpret it as willful participation. This is why filming a scene this way is a bad idea: people can interpret it as "Look, she's enjoying it, if she were being raped she would try harder to get away" while nearly everyone else sees it as rape. That means that in subsequent episodes when there is no fallout from perceived violence, the show seems to be condoning rape, or at the very least sweeping its implications under the rug. (Also objecting to have sex with someone in a specific time and place IS objecting to have sex with them. Just because one is a willing sexual partner is some contexts does not give the corresponding partner rights to sex whenever, wherever, or whyever.)
Â 
So why are people so upset about this change? Because it's entirely unnecessary. One line would have changed it from obvious rape to consensual sex. In the book, Cersei gave very explicit verbal consent, so why the need to make the scene more complicated or more nuanced or more in danger of being misinterpreted? This change had nothing to do with budgeting or production challenges or page-to-screen translation issues. It seems to have everything to do with shock value and making sure everyone is talking about the show. It sets back Jaime's character development, and makes little sense in the continuity of the plot, but should that really surprise us? Sansa's development regressed quite a bit in Season 3, imo, and their apparent need to sanitize Tyrion and Dany while demonizing Stannis makes little sense, also. Turning Renly into an offensive gay caricature ("Ewwwwwwwww blood!") rather than the much more developed character of ASOIAF really did nothing for the show. The addition of Ros but the subtraction of Sansa's assertion of agency or Arya's weasel soup or the inclusion of Reek in season 2 (which, why the hell did they NOT include him? It made the burning of WF completely arbitrary and confusing) completely baffled me as well. I think we should all just assume that D&D make changes just because they think it improves the story without real consideration to the repercussions of those changes. This error is made all the more egregious because it was so blatantly unnecessary.

It doesn't work like that? Because every person whose ever been raped responds exactly the same, right? Are you a rape councilor?  Have you witnessed every rape ever? How many rape victims have you spoken to? How many hours a week do you spend working the rape hotline? How many rape kits have you helped girls use?
How is kissing someone and wrapping your kegs around them "resisting"?

The problem is, people like yourself aren't listening to the audio properly. You're picking up on key words without paying attention to the way in which they're said. Her tone, coupled with what she chooses to do with her hands and lips, provide pretty compelling evidence that it's not rape.

'not here' means 'I don't want to have sex with you, in this moment, at this location'.

That means no. That is a clear refusal to have sex.

As for the audio distracting the viewer from watching the action onscreen.... seriously? that's the line you're going with?

You're saying the audio tape should be separated from the viewing experience for the audience to arrive at the conclusion that it might not be rape. That's pretty much telling people to cherry pick.

Whether he's fictional or not is irrelevant. I'm asking you whether you would send Jaime to jail based on that scene, if it were a real event that actually took place..
Â 
You're saying it's rape. Rape comes with a pretty severe, life-ruining jail sentence in most countries, which is why false accusations are such a problem in the real world.

I'd disagree that it was OOC, because I think it really shows what a destructive and corrosive effect Cersei/their relationship has on Jaime, which is consistent with the books (as is the rape). I mentioned this on the second page as well. In fact, Show!Jaime is almost committing a violent act against himself, or rather his past self in disgust/self-loathing as he's raping Cersei (not that it's excusable or justified).


Â 
Because having sex with your twin, in a sept, in front of your son's corpse doesn't showcase enough how destructive the relationship is? It bothers me that people think it as an excuse to turn a consensual scene into rape. Good storytelling shouldn't need this amount of shocking scenes only meant to shock - because yes, that's the sole reason they made this scene even more twisted that in the books, and I'm glad critics and reviewers are calling the show out as well. This is not just the case of a bunch of book purists being upset, it's the majority.
Â 
I don't know what to say to the people who keep arguing it was rape in the books either; grrm settled it.
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
First, showJaime isn't the same than bookJaime. And two, if we're mixing both of them, Jaime is a man who almost killed TWO kids so his sister/lover would be happy and they could continue their incestuous and amoral relationship. I definitly disagree on this action being worst than what he has done before, It's not that RAPE is repulsive for Jaime. Jaime IS repulsive. He told Brienne "you know what? You're about to be raped: don't fight them and think of Renly". If we're going to use our 21th Century morals, then that speech is quite condemnable because it's what many women were told about 30 years ago about the subject of rape: don't fight and let him do as you will so you won't die. And while Jaime don't use sex as a weapon, Cersei does: she uses sex BEFORE he asks him anything, either be in the KG, kill Arya or who knows what else. Does Cersei gets the same treatment Jaime does? They both are disgusting, to be honest: their relationship has caused a war and they don't even care about how many people have died just because they couldn't get away from each other. Let's not try to put this single scene as the top of the horrible things Jaime has done because it's definitely not the worst, specially in show.
Â 
And you think the scene in the books is about love? Jaime pretty much says "oh, fuck, you lost a kid? I'll give you other!", like it's not a big problem and that hasn't cause any more problems. Her son just died and you can't keep your paws away from her? He loves her so much that he didn't care if suddenly their father could have enter? Or a sept? Or a Tyrell? I'm sure that Jaime has somehow loved Cersei before, but that was nothing but lust.


Â 
I don't think the scene in the books is about love, there are some that have romanticised the whole Jaime/Cersei relationship and that particular scene. As grrm pointed out, it was meant to be disturbing. Still, what is the point in turning disturbing in even more disturbing?
Â 
Jaime being horrible and generally an asshole doesn't make him a rapist as well. You can't assume that because someone does something wrong, there's nothing he wouldn't do, it's an argument that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. According to his characterisation in the show, for him to rape Cersei makes no sense. It's like developing a character, and then just turn him into an even worse person than he used to be, with no explanation or rationale.
Â 
To answer the OP, two major reasons:
Â 
- Many are sick of the way sexual violence is used on the show for no other reason than shock
- It's a disservice to both Jaime, who's now a rapist, and Cersei, who they persist on writing as a toothless woobie with no agency

3374	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-23	Her "pushing" seems more feigned than anything. It's gentle and not indicative of someone in a great amount of distress, desperate to get away.


Â 
You do realize that Jaime is around 80s lbs heavier, much stronger, and is almost a whole foot taller than Cersei? As they are going down she's actually pushing him back with both hands but he's much stronger so he squisher her right elbow under his body which keeps her from moving her arms and his shoulder is up against her left arm pit, which again, keeps her from using her left arm.
Â 
Go find someone that ways 80-100 lbs more than you, is a whole foot taller and much stronger. Have them lay down on top of your body and see if you can wiggle out with them trying to keep you from doing it.

Â 
For me, the problem is seing rape with the point of view of "Western world in 2014".
Â 
Is the scene of Jaime and Cersei rape? Depend. Certainly if it happened in Sweden in 2014 it would be rape. And maybe Jaime should be put into jail.
Â 
Â 
But since the scene happened in Westeros, the discussion has not much sense. Moral rules and laws are different. If the creators said it is (semi)consensual in Westeros, we sould accept that it fits outside the definition of Westeros-rape.
And finally that's all that matters.

Do you live in. Medieval-fantasy world? It makes no sense to attempt judge it from that perspective. No one said Jaime is guilty of a crime under the law of Westeros. The only perspective we have is the modern one. Why is if so important to carve out zone of protection for Jaime?
She's not a victim.

She clearly stated verbally that she did not want to hVe sex there in the Sept, but Jaime continued. That's rape. You can talk about kissing and pulling, but it doesn't matter when she's telling him to stop.

Â 
I don't think he did. He says Cersei ultimatly does want it, but is reluctant to actually act on it, because of the situation. Jaime basically takes the decision from her, by just forcing it and as she starts enjoing it, she eventually puts her doubts aside.
To be honest I don't want to get into the discussion if this is rape or not, but to me Jaime does not do much different here than he does in the show, because what is desribed above for some people is already enough to be defined as a rape. I think in both cases in Jaimes eyes there is a Cersei that sort of wants him, but is held back by the situation and in both cases he decides that she ultimatly wants it, although she might be protesting.
What really just changes to me is the way Cersei acts on it, but not what Jaime is doing. I think also in the show, we will end up with a Cersei what ultimatly enjoyed it, but still thinks the time and place were wrong.
Â 
I don't even want to get into it again if this is a situation you call or not call rape, because due to the nature of the characters, their previous relationship, the historical/fictional environment and the way they in the end feel about it, this is something I find hard to judge. The only thing I can judge for me is the similarity between what happens in the book and in the show and to me there is not much of a difference when it comes to Jaimes actions really. To me he does at least "risk"Â  raping her (from a neutral point of view), although it would never feel like rape to him, because he is convinced that Cersei ultimatly feels the way he feels and he is "rescued" of "objectively" raping her by the fact that she indeed does want it, although she initially doesn't show it.

That's because it wasn't their intention for it to come off as rape, although, I wouldn't doubt whoever came up with the finishing product actually did it on purpose. It wouldn't be the first time.

First of all, the series is written by people living on modern moral standards, who know very well the readers/viewers are going to judge the characters according mostly to said modern standards.
Â 
There was a time when it was completely acceptable for a 12+ year old to be forced into having sex with much, much older men ; there are places where it's considered normal (or even, the right thing to do) to violently kill women because they've cheated on their husbands, or for little girls to go through genital mutilation. So basicallyÂ you're saying youÂ have no problem with it ?

Please don't put words in my mouth I have not said.
I said that judging a character with modern moral standards when is set up in a fictional world makes no sense.
Following your example, nowadays is not acceptable to put a 8 y.o to work, but in Westeros it is, and nobody is calling them children exploiters, because we understand that moral rules in westeros are different.
I just claim that with this scene we might be under the same case. It is rape in 2014 but it might not exactly considered like that in westeros.
Â 
Â 


Besides, rape is not something that is defined by culture, laws, or time. Like killing, eating or sleeping. It's an action.


Â 
This is were we disagree. A person is sleeping in the year 1492 or in the year 2014. And we all agree that it is sleeping.Â 
An action falls in the category of rape in 2014, but for some cases, a person seing it from 1492 might disagree. I thing place, culture and specially time affect the definition of an action, including the definition of the scene we are discussing.
3390	IlAovatar	2014-04-23	Besides, rape is not something that is defined by culture, laws, or time. Like killing, eating or sleeping. It's an action.


Of course it's defined by laws, in the same way that murder is... otherwise a lot of the people who serve their countries during war are murderers.

3395	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-23	I don't mind the scene. It showed that Cersei was physically repulsed by Jaime's crippledness. Jaime got his hand cut off for trying to prevent a rape, so that later his lover rejected him for it, which lead him to be a rapist.

The law doesn't decide whether someone kills another human being. They decide whether the killing was unlawful, malicious, premeditated etc. just as they decide whether a sexual encounter was a nonconsensual form of assault.

Â 
Agreed. It's also leaking into GOT, as well. Just look at how they handle Mel, Stannis and compare it to Tyrion, Daenerys. None of these characters are distinctly "better" than another when it comes to "morals" but they constantly focus on the negatives of Mel and Stannis and never show the negatives of Tyrion or Daenerys.
Â 
Let's be honest, you're not playing the game of thrones right if you don't squash a few innocent people in the process, but they almost never show Tyrion or Dany in those situations.

Â 
I think the "problem" with Jaime is, people already had to change their mind about him once, he turned from bad to good and shouldn't turn back now.
I however also see that many people even only-show-watchers (where even me while knowing the books find it harder to see the "greyness" of a lot of characters) in Jaimes case see him similar to me: Yes, he indeed really changed for the better, but being back in his old circumstances is kind of tearing him out of those cirsumstances that helped to make him a better person again, which is kind of a "relapse". It's like the addict coming back from the clinic, where he was seperated from his other addicted friends and where it was easier to stay clean, but once back in "real life" it gets tougher and he has still to learn to be a better person also in his "old world".

If the laws in U.S.A. are not against me forcing women to have sex, it doesn't mean if I took advantage of those laws that I wouldn't be a rapist. I would just be committing lawful rape.

3401	Annara Snow	2014-04-23	Â 
You're actually getting closer to the other part of my peeve with this scene. In addition to making Jaime a rapist, they made Cersei a wuss.Â  Book Cersei was crazy and and evil and not nearly as smart as she thought she was, but she was no one's wuss. If book-Jaime had tried that crap, book-Cersei would have slammed his unhealed stump hard and put a knee in his nuts and left him groaning on the floor. Jaime is the powerless one in that scene in the book -- begging Cersei to love him, to marry him even -- and Cersei's the one in charge.Â 
Â 
Yet on the show, Cersei is suddenly a victim. Why?Â  They've already stripped Cersei of so much of her agency by making her nicer.Â  Instead of deciding "Hell no, I won't give Robert any kids!" and aborting his kid (not nice, but powerful!)Â  she bears him a son who dies in infancy instead, because that's nicer and it makes it look like she actually tried to be a good wife to him and he didn't appreciate it.Â 
Â 
Book-Cersei was a nasty piece of work but she had agency.Â  She made her own choices and acted on them -- to the detriment of all Westeros, yes, but at least she wasn't passive and helpless.Â 
Â 
Show Cersei is a weakling, and that's all wrong.Thank you. I feel the same about the show version of Cersei and I always hated the changes they made to her relationship with Robert. And then they also made her look powerless in her relationship with Joffrey. Book Cersei is powerless with one man only, her father.  She never complains that she can't control Joffrey. 
I hate when people say that show Cersei is more "complex" than book Cersei. A character does not become more complex by being stripped of their power, agency and rough edges.
3402	FalseKnight	2014-04-23	Of course it matters. You can't willingly have sex with someone and then claim rape.
Â 
If anyone is the victim, it's Jaime for being manipulated so Cersei can get what she wants.

Your perspective is frankly scary. You have argued that her mouth said no, but her body said yes. Now you argue that Jaime is the victim because Cersei manipulated him. You could hit the trifecta by arguing that she wore a really slutty funeral gown.
3403	IlAovatar	2014-04-23	No law determines whether the action is punishable. Rape and murder are concepts the pre-date legal definitions.


Sorry, you're wrong. Even the word "rape" itself originates from Roman law, and back then it was defined as simply carrying a woman off by force, regardless of whether any sexual penetration occurred.

Can you rape a whore if she's taking your money and voluntarily doing her job? Â If she refuses your money, and her services to you, and you still fuck her against her will, that's not only rape, but theft.
Â 
I don't remember, is that what happened?She wasn't doing anything voluntarily. She was a slave. Her master was taking the money and agreeing to things, not her. Tyrion observed her "dead eyes" (which sounds like his memory of Tysha dead eyes, to make it creepier) and thought "I'm fucking a corpse" and then he did it again anyway.

Â 
Forced sex = rape, (made up words) galabala, ghetro, litrafix, lamafolo
Â 
Does not matter what you call it. When people use the word "rape" they are talking about forced sex, for the most part. The action of forcing someone to have sex does not change just because you're in a country where it's legal.
Â 
Jaime forced himself on Cersei. That is what the discussion is about.

Following your example, nowadays is not acceptable to put a 8 y.o to work, but in Westeros it is, and nobody is calling them children exploiters, because we understand that moral rules in westeros are different.
I just claim that with this scene we might be under the same case. It is rape in 2014 but it might not exactly considered like that in westeros.
Â 
Â 
Â 


If you follow your own logic, you shouldn't. You say it isn't rape because it wouldn't have been considered so at the time (with which I disagree), therefore Jaime (or rather, GoT writers)Â shouldn't be blamed for it. If you think example A, B and C are wrong, you should by all logicÂ think the sameÂ of this scene.

Forced sex = rape, (made up words) galabala, ghetro, litrafix, lamafolo
Â 
Does not matter what you call it. When people use the word "rape" they are talking about forced sex, for the most part. The action of forcing someone to have sex does not change just because you're in a country where it's legal.
Â 
Jaime forced himself on Cersei. That is what the discussion is about.
Rape is also coerced sex.
3411	SeventySeven	2014-04-23	Thank you. I feel the same about the show version of Cersei and I always hated the changes they made to her relationship with Robert. And then they also made her look powerless in her relationship with Joffrey. Book Cersei is powerless with one man only, her father. She never complains that she can't control Joffrey.
I hate when people say that show Cersei is more "complex" than book Cersei. A character does not become more complex by being stripped of their power, agency and rough edges.


Â 
Yes. The people who think she's more complex in the show just seem unable to accept a female character being truly driven by the desire of power and acting on it. It's something to be cherished in male characters, but god forbid a woman shows the same attitude. They have to be turned into woobies to justify all the bad they do, which is exactly what has happened with Cersei's characterisation since season 1. In fact, I'd argue that the change in this particular scene is also in part dictated by the need to portray Cersei as a victim again, in a misguided attempt to make her more sympathetic.

No one has a problem with women that want power, as long as they don't come off as a stereotypical "strong woman who need no man" that men will always see as a joke.

But not all forms of sexual assault are considered to be rape, and not every act that's considered to be rape necessarily involves sexual intercourse. It all depends on the legal definition.
Â 
And even what you call "forced sex" isn't necessarily nonconsensual. There are couples who get off on that kind of thing, even when it's spontaneous rather than pre-planned.

Nonconsensual sex still exists. But the actual act of raping someone is defined by law, and that definition varies dramatically depending on the place / time period.

Â 
So you are arguing semantics then? Â Why is it important that we call it "Nonconsensual sex" as opposed to "rape"?
What difference does it make?

Â 
1. But not all rape is equal. There are situations where a woman or man will have sex with their sleeping partner. If they didn't talk about it to their partner beforehand, then technically they sexually assaulted their partner. But I wouldn't put them in prison for it.
Â 
2. Agreed. But most people know what I mean when I say that "rape=forced sex".
3418	Daske	2014-04-23	Â 
Jaime being horrible and generally an asshole doesn't make him a rapist as well. You can't assume that because someone does something wrong, there's nothing he wouldn't do, it's an argument that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. According to his characterisation in the show, for him to rape Cersei makes no sense. It's like developing a character, and then just turn him into an even worse person than he used to be, with no explanation or rationale.
Â 


Â 
Most of the main anti-heros of the best tv shows have characters that lull you in 'oh he or she isn't such a bad guy', then bam! they do something truly horrible you did not expect, Tony Soprano (and Silvio and Paulie), Walter White, Al Swerengen, Gaius Baltar, Dexter and so on they have all done unspeakable things after you get to know them and to a certain extent have started to root for them.
Â 
Redemption does not have to be linear, or be permanent, or even happen at all. And characters, as with real people, do not have to be consistant. The Hound can be shown as having redeeming qualities (and becomeÂ a fan favourite) after murdering a child, one of whose acts afterwards includes protecting a child. And there is much sympathy for a broken Theon despite the fact he too murdered two innocent children.
Â 
Rape is obviously a special case in how people react to it compared to other horrible crimes, soÂ it could be interesting where they take Jaime's character now. If a child murderer like The Hound can find some sort of redemption, can a rapist? I don't know if this is possible to pull this off in a mature fashion in the show, and admittedly GoT may not get it right, but let's see if there is any fallout first. I can't help but think that Jaime will end up paying for his sins (in book as well as show). I can't really see any way a rapist would be accepted as redeemed apart from maybe sacrificing themselves in some fashion.Â But let's see.Â If the show fails to address it at all, then I acquiesce - that would be very poor form.

Â 
I suspect they will proceed in a 'business as usual' fashion given that they think they made a scene that consisted of consensual sex.
3421	Frey Pies	2014-04-23	Honestly, that scene was much more complicated than many are giving it credit for. Cersei always brings out the worst in Jaime, and that is what we saw in action here. I think it will be a low point for Jaime, and will eventually lead to Jaime resolve for changing and distancing himself from Cersei being strengthened, which I hope we see in play next few episodes.Â
3422	The Prophet of Patch	2014-04-23	If nothing else, this episode demonstrated how unclear what constitutes sexual assault is to some (notably some of the showrunners).Â  Not sure how you can watch that scene and get consent from it...it's much easier for me to see the argument that the scene in the book was also nonconsensual (Cersei's protests, banging on Jaime's chest, getting Jaime's POV bias, etc.).Â 
Â 
I think, as many have stated, that the only thing we can do is wait to see where they go with this in the next episode.Â  I don't think we can start claiming character assassination until we see the aftermath, since this could be nothing more than an editing fuck up.Â  If they were aiming for "dubious consent," (if that's a thing) as in the books, and just completely missed their mark, that's one thing (a shitty mistake, but a mistake nontheless); if they make it clear that they intended this to be a rape scene, that opens a whole other can of worms, and we should start discussing whether it was OOC or not (I'm not sure it was for Jaime, it very much was for Cersei).
Â 
I actually have less of a problem with this scene than the Dany/Drogo wedding night scene, as that was much more clearly consensual in the books.
3423	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-23	Honestly, that scene was much more complicated than many are giving it credit for. Cersei always brings out the worst in Jaime, and that is what we saw in action here.

Â 
Â 
Wait, wait, wait. Are you seriously trying to say this is Cersei's fault?????????????????
Â 
J/K. I completely agree. Their relationship is so toxic and Jamie is completely responsible for his actions, but I doubt there is any other woman in the Seven Kingdoms that this would have happened with.

Â 
But characters aren't real people, and in a narrative they need to follow a certain consistent pattern. If the wanted to show Jaime still has a dark side to him, which I would not deny he does, there were other more in character ways to portray it. Do you think that if he had consensual sex with his twin in front of Joff's corpse the audience would have thought what a delightful fella Jaime is? No, everyone would have thought it was gross, that Jaime/Cersei were dysfunctional and disgusting, and that there's a side of Jaime that it's revolting. Turning it into rape was completely unnecessary, and a characterisation from which is going to be very difficult to separate Jaime from. It's clunky to have a character save a woman from rape twice in one season, and have him rape another the next. I'd rather they had him kill another cousin, at least it would be something show!Jaime would have done.
Â 
I doubt they'll address it btw. We'll see I guess, but all the responses from the people involved in the show so far, don't point to this change as an actual plot point, but more as an oh-so-edgy choice.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Daenerys is the most power hungry character in the whole show, but she has the second most fans (behind the imp).
Â 
Arya is power hungry (through killing) and she also is one of the top favorites.

Â

Â 
In the show? Arya isn't power hungry, and Dany is more complex than that.
Â 
Cersei has been stripped of all agency and is very passive in the show. In the books she's restlessly chasing power, she's very manipulative and a very dynamic and tragic character. I hate that they're turning her into just a victim. One of the most interesting sides of her in the books is that she is indeed a victim, but she's also an abuser. They're doing the character such a disservice.

Â 
Agreed. Â This has been a constant problem with female characters on the show. Â GRRM wrote these amazing, powerful characters that drive their own stories and the show-runners seem to take issue with it and take it away at every step. From the beginning, when they had Ned being the one deciding to become Hand rather than Catelyn strongly encourage him. Â Instead in the show, she whines and wants him to tell Robert no; to Arya's escape from Harrenhall being orchestrated by Jaqen, rather than Arya herself (same can be said about Sansa's lack of participation in her escape on the show - again being given to men). It goes on and on and on with pretty much every female character on the show, except Dany whose pedestal is so high the fall is going to be rough. I don't know - it makes me feel like D&D really need to take some time to truly evaluate how they feel about women deep inside. The good thing is that GRRM's source material is so strong that even stripped down - we still have some of the most amazing female television characters in existence, but it is annoying that they could have been even better.

No, Tywin is ruling so she doesn't dare cross him. Wait till next season, I fully expect Cesei to step it way up. I'm actually pretty excited about it. I know Lena will crush it too.

3427	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-23	The way I see it, Jaime is behaving like a rapist in both the book and the show. Â Does the fact that Cersei eventually gives in excuse Jaime's rapacious behavior prior to that moment? Â If you read the scene she's pleading with him and he's not hearing her, I don't think he would have stopped if she didn't give consent. Â I think the big difference is not Jaime, but Cersei's behavior. Â Cersei is more of a three dimensional character in the show and acts more like a realistic human being, rather than the cartoonish psychopath from the books.


Â 
Exactly.Â  I do think the character of ShowCersei plays alot into this equation, and the differences between her and bookCersei.Â  We already know from the later POVs of Cersei that she thinks how Jaime was the only one that sex was ever right with.......not once thinking about....oh that time he forced me, but I forgive him.Â  ShowCersei is actually almost one of the most unrecognizeable characters on the show sometimes.Â  I was a bit hopeful with the early Marg paranoia that the show gave her, it starting with Joff instead of with Tommen, but still........she has been altered almost as much as Shae.Â

Â 
I totally agree that the show softens the hell out of Cersei's character, and this scene is one of the most extreme examples of that, but I think it has more to do with the difficulties of translating a POV-based novel into a non-POV-based show.Â  We see so much less of her in the books until she becomes a POV char, and even then her actions play out differently than what's going on in her head.Â  Maybe this is just my misguided optimism, but I don't think the intent was toÂ change Cersei's character as drastically as they have.Â  This scene seemed like kind of a gut-punch to her book character, though.

Â 
I do think chances are that if we were inside Cersei's head pre-AFFC that she wouldn't have come off so crazy.Â  I think the death of Joffrey pushed her over the edge, that and maybe even all the changes in Jaime, too, once he returned.Â  I suspect, though, that pre-AFFC Cersei was already hearing the whisperings of Maggy the Frog in her head much too much, thanks to being left alone with Tyrion and well, thanks to Cersei's own unique outlook.Â  I do think her mind wouldn't have been quite the same ride on the crazy train in GoT to ASOS.Â  Still, I suspect it was boiling under the surface, ready to come out at anytime.Â 
Â 
I'd just given up on BookCersei showing up more often until after Joff's death onscreen, I figured that would set her more towards the book path.Â  Sometimes I wonder if the show runners even realize HOW DIFFERENT many of their characters really have become.Â

Â 
Why wouldn't he do that? Â Cersei conveniently gave verbal consent Â before penetration, but up until that moment, he was forcing himself on her. Â I saw no indication he was going to stop for any reason, as he even admits he doesn't hear her protests. Â She was resisting up to the point that he got her small clothes off and he could see she was on her moon blood, do people really think he would have regained his composure and stopped if Cersei didn't start the "do me" stuff?
People act like Jaime is a completely reformed character by the end of book 3, his arc is not from black to white, he was always a grey character, we are just seeing him through biased eyes up until book 3. Â Jaime still acts selfishly after committing some redeeming acts. Â He goes from trying to kill Brienne, to rescuing her because he starts to care for her, and when he's done with Cersei he leaves her to her fate.

Â 
Yep, Joffrey's death was clearly a tipping point. Previously she thought she was in control. It was only a few rebukes by Tyrion and Tywin in the books that showed she had been making mistakes, but she still thought she had it in hand. Post Joffrey and post Tywin was when she spiraled out of control.

Just like the Arya situation, there's no way to know though. The fact is, she did give consent in the books, and we don't know how it could've gone if hadn't; but what matters in the end is that she did. The book version is shady, yes, but the show version is plainly just 100%Â wrong, not to mention that, thanks to their messing up with the timeline, she had rejected prior to the Sept scene, which sort of increases the rapeyness.

Â 
But people are acting like Jaime's behavior here is different from the books, when it's not at all.
3434	MuchandMore	2014-04-23	Â 
Because pretty nothing you mention fundamentally alters a character like Jamie raping Cersei. I mean is Arya's character altered because she killed Polliver instead of the Tickler? Is Oberyn doing anything utterly against his character by grabbing another man's junk?
Â 
You gave only two examples of big alterations to characters. Missiandei is older and essentially taking over Irri and Jhiqui's roles. But ultimately, there is nothing Show!Missiandei is doing that book version would never do (except possibly romantic/sex stuff, but this is hardly a change in character since we have no reason to believe Book!Missiandei wouldn't be when she's older).
Â 
The other is Shae. Yeah, huge alteration. But the difference is Show!Shae is a lot more enjoyable than Book!Shae. So, people accept that easier. It's not like they are taking a popular character and having commit one of the horrible acts she would not do. Also, considering Tyrion is one of the few characters constantly getting whitewashed, I'm guessing Shae's betrayal will be even worse on the show than the books.


Â 
Now THIS is main problem I have with so many people having a problem with the scene.Â  Altering the story is better than altering one character?Â  SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!Â 
Â 
And is Oberyn out of character?Â  YES!!!Â  While reading SOS, did you finish with ANY sort of feeling about Oberyn's sexuality?Â  No!Â  You read the book, and realize he is one of the most dangerous men in the Seven Kingdoms.Â  The ONLY thing the show has shown of him in 3 episodes is junk grabbing.Â  They are making him gay, just for the sake of adding more gayness to the show.Â  If he WERE portrayed in the way in the books, even a little bit, I would have no problem here.Â  So yea....hes WAY out of character.Â 
Â 
Furthermore, is Stannis done properly in the show?Â  Yea right.
Â 
How bout the fact that they are doing anything and everything to portray Mel as EVIL!Â  Do you get the feeling she is evil reading the books?Â  She says a million times that she is an agent of light fighting the darkness.Â  Clearly the Red people have some wicked power, but does that make them evil.Â  No it does not!Â  Davos and some others think she's evil from a religious standpoint, which is not what is happening on the show.Â 
Â 
So no, I don't make a distinction between changing the story and changing a character, no I don't believe these changes were necessary for TV purposes like others have said, and yes, the show STINKS!Â  I wish they would either cancel it, or get people who DON'T feel as though they are better writers than George to do it.Â
3435	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-23	Â 
But people are acting like Jaime's behavior here is different from the books, when it's not at all.


Â 
Yes it is different.Â  The whole scene has a different setting thanks to the above mentioned early arrival for Jaime in KL.Â  The earlier rejection and the line 'whyÂ  have the gods made me love such a hateful woman' is a big difference from him and Cersei seeing each other for the very first time.Â  It sets a totally different mood, and the missing.......do me Jaime, do me, makes a difference, too.Â

Â 
I'd always wanted a peek inside Cersei's head before AFFC, and I do suspect it would have been an interesting read.Â  She's so crazy and evil by AFFC, I always feel like I need a shower after reading her thoughts.Â  Still, she is funny, though, at times, there is that.Â
3437	DaveyJoe	2014-04-23	So a man ripping off a woman's clothing while she resists isn't acting like a rapist if she gives consent before penetration?

Â 
Don't think he was claiming that Jaime wasn't forcing himself on Cersei in the book, but that the scene is so different, for so many reasons. Just the fact that Cersei has already rejected JaimeÂ in the show adds another disturbing layer to the scene.
Â 
Also, can people stop claiming that Oberyn was ruined because he fucks dudes?Â  In the book he was supposed to be pretty hyper-sexual, I think the show has done a pretty good job with that.

3440	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-23	So a man ripping off a woman's clothing while she resists isn't acting like a rapist if she gives consent before penetration?


Â 
If we oversimplify and distort things, then yes he "acts like a rapist" at times in both scenarios.
Â 
If we're grown ups who actually care about nuance and context, there is a world of difference between making an inappropriately aggressive pass at someone which is ultimately received in a consensual manner versus sexually forcing yourself upon someone who never at any point consents to your advance.
Â 
It's really, really freaking simple. Â The fact that 70+ pages into this conversation there are still people who don't get it is quite frankly extremely alarming.
3441	digiFemme	2014-04-23	Been reading all the social media about the last episode, and I don't understand why THIS is the change that people are not okay with.Â  I watch the show only for those rare occasions where I can watch and enjoy a scene from the book.Â  Obviously, I am usually disappointed.Â  So after 2 years of D&D making a complete mess of things, why is THIS instance of them butchering the story such a big deal?Â  Just because it has to do with rape?Â  In the book, the scene becomes consensual.Â  So if this scene in the show is rape, why doesn't she scream out as loud as she can?Â  Why doesn't she punch and kick?Â  To me, this was just POOR representation of the book, and not the biggest change ever.Â  Furthermore, it goes all with most of the changes D&D make....to add shock value!Â  So why care so much now?
Â 
Who cares if Irri and Jhiqui are dead right?Â 
Â 
Who cares if Missandei is suppose to be 10, and instead is a woman with voluptuous breasts?
Â 
Who cares if they COMPLETELY ruin the House of the Undying?
Â 
Why have Arya kill the Tickler when she can kill Poliver instead?
Â 
Why bother having Barristan kill the Titans Bastard?Â  Why put that incredibly memorable scene in the show?
Â 
Strong Belwass?Â  Who?
Â 
How are they going to have Dany find out Jorrah betrayed her?Â  Not well!
Â 
How will Arya leave the Hound when he is not injured in the fight at the Inn?Â  NO REASON TO CHANGE IT!
Â 
Why do I have to watch Oberyn grab a handful of some guys junk EVERY EPISODE!!!!Â  One little teeny line about RUMORS that Oberyn has had sex with everyone, and D&D run like the wind with it!Â  It adds NOTHING to show.Â  NOTHING!Â  And yet its there...every episode....why?Â  Shock value!
Â 
Who cares if they've COMPLETELY annihilated the Shaetrayal by giving her the laughable scorned lover motive!Â  Making it Tryion's own fault!Â  REALLY!
Â 
I could go on and on.Â  So I ask again....why is THIS scene, after allÂ of the ridiculous and meaningless changes they've made so far, why is thisÂ the one everyone is making such a big deal about?


Â 
I've been reading through some of the posts, I think the problem is that a lot of people were starting to see Jaimie as a good guy after he was captured, lost his hand, met Brienne, etc. That's why it was so upsetting to them, because they interpreted the character as going through a redemption arc which somehow meant transforming into a 'good guy' of sorts. Personally, I've never seen him as a good guy. I agree with what Martin said here, in that in ASOIAF there are plenty of characters that range from morally gray to downright evil and somewhere in between but once in awhile, these characters will show compassion and do something good for others. This has the tendency to confuse people and/or cause a re-interpretation of the said character.
Â 
Personally, I've never seen Jaime as a 'good guy'; he may not be as bad as Ramsay or Gregor but I never forgot how he pushed Bran off the tower. My problem with the scene is that I consider it off-character and inconsistent. Can I believe that someone who stood by while his queen was being raped, tried to murder a child and later killed his cousin (in the TV show) is somehow incapable of raping his sister? Sure, given the context and background of said character.
Â 
He was little more than a child himself when he served in the kingsguard...at that time he clearly didn't like what was happening to Queen Rhaella but couldn't do a thing about it. He was sworn to serve the king, there were other kingsguard members there who would've stopped him had he even tried to intervene. Not to mention, he probably would've been executed for treason. In the same way he and the rest of the kingsguard stood by when Aerys had Brandon and Rickard Stark tortured and killed in court.Â 
Â 
One consistent thing I can see in his actions is that he will do anything (murder, attempted murder) to preserve his relationship with Cersei. Anything that threatens it, he will attack without conscience- that's why he pushed Bran off the tower and that's why he murdered Cleos Frey. That's also probably why he endured being part of the kingsguard despite all that was happening (not to mention witnessing Aery's crimes against humanity, etc.); given that, it just doesn't make sense to me for him to rape his sister, NOT because I see him as a nice person but because by hurting her that way, he'd be threatening his relationship with her. Wouldn't Cersei make it even more difficult for him to be with her had he done something against her person and against her wishes? I think when Martin said that 'the scene was meant to be disturbing' what he meant was that their relationship and everything about it -that they were murderous people with a murderous son and while it's not a crime to love a sibling per se (it worked for the Targs), wasn't really good for Jaime and Cersei in particular because it didn't make them better people.
Â 
I interpreted the way the scene was written in the books not just based on what was happening but also the context of their relationship and who they were to each other. While I agree that a woman getting turned on in the latter part of the event doesn't make it ok and still counts as rape- I felt that the scene wasn't depicted with that scenario in mind. For one thing- in the text, Cersei didn't just get turned on, she became an active participant. Another thing is that her protests weren't really a 'no I don't want to do this', but a 'no I don't want to do this here...but maybe someplace else?' When the the text said that 'Jaime didn't care', I didn't interpret it as a 'he didn't care about her feelings' but as a 'he didn't care if they were caught.' It is consistent with all their previous encounters not to mention what was happening to the characters at that exact time.
Â 
There's has always been a twisted relationship where they have to sneak around but Jaime is the more reckless. That explains their reactions after their encounter in the sept- in there, Cersei wasn't crying or whimpering or even angry with him. Her reaction was more of a 'this shouldn't have happened...we could've been caught' Whereas Jaime at that point was all 'Who cares what they think?'
-------
Â 
Someone summed it up perfectly, that while we find all these characters interesting and even come to care about them we shouldn't forget that not all of them are good or view them with rose colored lenses. For me the problem is (or should be) that it was more inconsistent and off character. Â 
Â 
The Hound is not a good guy either...but he was good to the Stark girls. His killing Mycah was not forgivable and whatever kindness he showed to Arya/Sansa doesn't make up for it. BUT it would be inconsistent for him to suddenly kill and torture someone just for the heck of it. His crime is following orders from the king (because as a knight, that's what you're supposed to do) and that includes killing anyone*...it does not include enjoying torture or anything that borders on Ramsey/Joffrey territory. Same with Littlefinger. I was curious what his reaction to the Red Wedding was. I don't think he'd want Catelyn hurt but he sure wouldn't mind if it was anyone else. Then again, she did marry Ned Stark so I'm not sure...

He isn't acting like a rapist if the woman is his lover and he knows that she normally enjoys that kind of forceful behaviour (...which is confirmed when Cersei kisses him shortly after and starts grabbing at him).

Â 
I agree it won't be mentioned next episode, but that is because the production thought they communicated a consensual scene.

Â 
The funny thing is that I agree with the beginning: Especially at this point (especially after losing a hand, a son, and another king) he would do anything to preserve the relationsship with Cersei, because that's almost all he has left and that he cares about, but that's exactly why I disagree with the fact he wouldn't do it. Because as weird as it sounds, due to how distubring, weird and completly destructive their relationship is, what happens in the Sept is part of exactly that: Preserving their relationship (which "getting physical" is a huge part of).
Would it be out of character for Jaime at this point to rape any other woman: yes, I would go as far as even sleeping with another woman would be out of character as it would be cheating on Cersei.
I know this might sound extremly weird to any sane person, but this is how messed up I see their relationship.

Â 
Â 
This is the part that seems to be driving everyone crazy for some odd reason. If people truly only cared about Jaime's character being changed, then they wouldn't be saying things like "Jaime better be punished next episode!"
Â 
The overall outrage is not about Jaime's character being changed, but more about people thinking GoT is a documentary and these are not actors.Â

Â 
No, for me it's about frustration that such a huge mistake can be made, but the tv audience will be expected to develop amnesia and just continue with the story.Â  All tv writers can be guilty of this, they take the audience for granted, pull insane shit, and expect everyone to just show up the next week and swallow whatever nonsensical bullshit they have taped without getting whiplash.Â

3450	Chebyshov	2014-04-23	Here's my final response to the OP and my thoughts on the subject. I wrote this for something else, so I apologize for repeating some points I've made here already. I don't think the TV writers made a mistake here, and this is really my defense of what's depicted.
Â 
From what I can tell, the controversy is borne of two things:
1. The director of the scene, Alex Graves, has stated that this scene â<U+0080><U+009C>becomes consensualâ<U+0080><U+009D> by the end, and
2. The claim that the scene in the show differs greatly from the scene in the books; the scene in the books is not one of rape, the show is likely using this for shock value, and this ruins Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization
Â 
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d like to address both of these points, in order.
Â 
Point 1 is simpler to address. The scene in the show is not one of consensual sex. To say that sex can â<U+0080><U+009C>becomeâ<U+0080><U+009D> consensual is a troubling notion. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure why Graves said this (whether it was in response to people being upset with this scene, or if Graves was hoping to point to some sort of subtlety in the scene), but he should not have, and is certainly wrong for suggesting it. The show-runners view this as a rape, and since that initial interview, Graves has described the scene as forced sex (along with another interesting comment about it that Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get to when addressing point 2). Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad people jumped on his comments that it â<U+0080><U+009C>became consensual,â<U+0080><U+009D> because they should have, but then this controversy becomes less about the content of the scene and more about somebodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blundered commentary on it. But what Graves meant with these poorly chosen remarks leads us into point 2.
Â 
This point, which is rather difficult to unpack, asserts that the scene was not one of rape in the books, and this was a change in the show. Here is the text below.
Â 
There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her, only hunger. Her mouth opened
for his tongue. â<U+0080><U+009C>No,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck, â<U+0080><U+009C>not here. The
septons . . . â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>The Others can take the septons.â<U+0080><U+009D> He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until
she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Motherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s
altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath. She pounded on his chest with
feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons,
about the wrath of gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and
pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her
smallclothes. When he tore them away, he saw that her moonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blood was on her, but it
made no difference.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Hurry,â<U+0080><U+009D> she was whispering now, â<U+0080><U+009C>quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime
Jaime Jaime.â<U+0080><U+009D> Her hands helped guide him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D> Cersei said as he thrust, â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother,
sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re
home.â<U+0080><U+009D> She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair. Jaime lost himself in her
flesh. He could feel Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heart beating in time with his own, and the wetness of blood
and seed where they were joined.
Â 
But no sooner were they done than the queen said, â<U+0080><U+009C>Let me up. If we are discovered like
this . . . â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
This is a complicated scene, and most people focus on the fact that Cersei does give verbal consent eventually and guides him in as a point that it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t rape. Even Martin himself has described Cersei as being relatively on-board with the sex, though notes that she finds the time and place wildly inappropriate. However, I would argue that this scene is not one that depicts consensual sex.
Â 
Rape is a sexual act carried out against someoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s will through force or coercion. What a rape looks like is unique. We even use terms like â<U+0080><U+009C>date-rapeâ<U+0080><U+009D> to differentiate the way in which sexual assaults occur. But is that to say that there are shades of rape? That some rape is worse than others? I find this notion distasteful, and one that leads us towards a dangerous conversation. I think a problem arises when you try to define what is and isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t rape.
Â 
Some have argued that the scene in the book is one of â<U+0080><U+009C>sexual assault,â<U+0080><U+009D> not â<U+0080><U+009C>rape.â<U+0080><U+009D> Some have argued that the book scene is â<U+0080><U+009C>rapey,â<U+0080><U+009D> but wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t come out and say â<U+0080><U+009C>rape.â<U+0080><U+009D> We can argue the semantics of it all we like, but I think to assert that this scene is incredibly different from what we saw on screen is a fallacious argument.
Â 
I will paraphrase a forum post I read yesterday that I think puts it well: it seems to me a dangerous place that when I say â<U+0080><U+009C>noâ<U+0080><U+009D> and a man still undresses me, puts his hand between my legs, even if I continue hitting him as a sign of rejection, and he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t once â<U+0080><U+009C>hear itâ<U+0080><U+009D> or even consider it as him starting to rape me, because he thinks I would eventually agree.
Â 
Just because Cersei may be â<U+0080><U+009C>hungryâ<U+0080><U+009D> for Jaime (as Martin puts it), or willing in most circumstances doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mean that she forfeits the right to say â<U+0080><U+009C>noâ<U+0080><U+009D> to his advances. He doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hear itâ<U+0080>¦he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care. To me, this is a scene of rape. Cersei was not comfortable having sex in the sept, next to her sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bier, and whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s to blame her? Jaime forces himself on her, and the idea that this is somehow mitigated because she â<U+0080><U+009C>gets into itâ<U+0080><U+009D> sets a very troubling precedent.
Â 
I think Graves was going for a scene more like what was described in the book (not that it is less of rape, but certainly different in tone), which is why he made the comments about the scene that he did. Some people have tried to help Graves out by noting that Cersei kisses Jaime back in the midst of the attack, and visible pulls him closer. I would argue that this was incredibly unclear upon first viewing. I would also argue that we should in no way judge what a woman should look like and act like while being raped. If Graves was hoping to have a more of a morally ambiguous rape scene, like what is in the books, I think he failed. The dialogue is that of unequivocal rape, as we hear Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s repeated objections and even sobs. The dialogue is also heavily emphasized, to the point where Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s last â<U+0080><U+009C>I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t careâ<U+0080><U+009D> echoes into the next scene, even after the visual has changed.
Â 
This scene was difficult to watch, but in a way, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d prefer not to have violence against women portrayed as being morally ambiguous (or even defensible, as weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen many rush to justify Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions in the book). The television depiction forced us to deal with the fact that Jaime forced himself on his sister in front of their sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s corpse. The bookâ<U+0080><U+0099>s setting, from inside Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head, â<U+0080><U+009C>softensâ<U+0080><U+009D> the blow of this fact. And peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fetishization of a redemption arc and love of Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character has caused many to look at his character with rose-colored glasses. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d argue that the TV show stripped us of that lens.
Â 
This brings us to the claims that Show!Jaime is out of character, whereas Book!Jaime is within character, because even if both scenes are depictions of rape, they have a different â<U+0080><U+009C>feelâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>tone.â<U+0080><U+009D> Yes, they do. In the show, Jaime attacks Cersei in a bout of anger, whereas in the book, Jaime is in a bout of â<U+0080><U+009C>passion.â<U+0080><U+009D> But let me argue that neither is out of character, because his character is a far darker-grey than I think avid book fans want to admit.
Â 
Note: when Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m explaining Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mentality and â<U+0080><U+009C>motivationsâ<U+0080><U+009D> (for lack of a better word), I am not, in anyway way, attempting to absolve him of guilt, justify what happened, or indicate that we should be okay with it. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m merely trying to explain the dynamics at play, and why I think it is consistent with Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization. Letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s start with the books.
Â 
In the books, Jaime and Cersei have one of the most messed up relationships. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard it defined as one of the most loving and pure at times. It is not. It has a corrosive effect on Jaime, which is why the same man who we saw heroically rescue Brienne at great risk to himself is the man who also attempted to murder a seven-year old. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard the argument that pushing Bran from the tower is justified because he was trying to protect himself and Cersei. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d argue instead that pre-losing his hand and going through his â<U+0080><U+009C>redemption arc,â<U+0080><U+009D> Jaime was not a very good man, and his relationship with Cersei brought out some of the worst in him.
Â 
Hereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a scene in the books where Jaime is reflecting (out loud, to the mute Ilyn Payne) on what he would have done to Ayra during the Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Road incident:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Ned Starkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s daughter had run off after her wolf savaged Joff, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll recall. My sister wanted the girl to lose a hand. The old penalty, for striking one of the blood royal. Robert told her she was cruel and mad. They fought for half the night... well, Cersei fought, and Robert drank. Past midnight, the queen summoned me inside. The king was passed out snoring on the Myrish carpet. I asked my sister if she wanted me to carry him to bed. She told me I should carry her to bed, and shrugged out of her robe. I took her on Raymun Darryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bed after stepping over Robert. If His Grace had woken I would have killed him there and then. He would not have been the first king to die upon my sword... but you know that story, donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you?â<U+0080><U+009D> He slashed at a tree branch, shearing it in half. â<U+0080><U+009C>As I was fucking her, Cersei cried, â<U+0080>I want.â<U+0080><U+0099> I thought that she meant me, but it was the Stark girl that she wanted, maimed or dead.â<U+0080><U+009D> The things I do for love. â<U+0080><U+009C>It was only by chance that Starkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own men found the girl before me. If I had come on her first...â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
This was Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mentality before his â<U+0080><U+009C>redemptionâ<U+0080><U+009D> arc in the 2nd and 3rd books/seasons. Would this Jaime have tried to save Brienne? I sincerely doubt it. His relationship with Cersei is a toxic, corrosive one that is often characterized as a â<U+0080><U+009C>power-struggleâ<U+0080><U+009D> and punctuated by moments of violence. It is unhealthy. Even the scene Bran espies is one of dubious consent:
Â 
There were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide -eyed and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman s tarted to moan, low in her throat. "Stop it," she said, "stop it, stop it. Oh, please . . ." But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.
Â 
Book!Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reunion with Cersei is the sept scene. Since being away, Jaime lost a hand, which set him on a redemptive path. I hate to describe rape as a â<U+0080><U+009C>relapse,â<U+0080><U+009D> but in many ways for Jaime, it was. He was once again back, near this woman who has been a very destructive force in his life. He found himself sucked right back into that dynamic, and excited by risk, violence, and depravity, forced himself on Cersei. Whether Cersei was turned on by it is moot; when she voiced her objections the scene should have stopped there. In reflection afterwards, Jaime notes that â<U+0080><U+009C>If the sept had caught fire I might never have noticed.â<U+0080><U+009D> This is a low point for his character in the books, as he couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t help himself from relapsing back to and engaging in their problematic dynamic, which is highlighted by the inappropriateness of its location.
Â 
Show!Jaime hits a very similar low note, through very similar means, though the way in which the scene unfolds is decidedly different. In the show, Jaime is now in the place of the spurned lover. Cersei is repulsed by his stump, and unhappy with his selflessness when it comes to Brienne (as evidenced in episodes 1 and 2, respectively). Whether she is right in rejecting him is irrelevant to the discussion of what happens, however. If I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t made one thing clear enough, it is that Cersei did NOT deserve to be raped, and Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions (both in the book and show) are NOT justified.
Â 
In the sept, the scene begins with Cersei attempting to manipulate Jaime. She asks him to kill their brother, and kisses him in an attempt to solidify his support. When she pulls away, and turns her attention back towards her dead son (as is her right), Jaime realizes what she was attempting to do. For him, this is a moment of being hit in the face with his past demons; he sees Cersei as she is, a â<U+0080><U+009C>hatefulâ<U+0080><U+009D> woman who has caused him to do â<U+0080><U+009C>hatefulâ<U+0080><U+009D> things (attempted child-murder, and kinslaying in the show). And what happens? He snaps. Is it right? No. Is it justified? No. But in a complicated way, Jaime attacking Cersei is him committing a violent crime against himself, or rather who he was.
Â 
To quote Alex Graves again, from the previously linked interview, when asked why Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s body needed to be in the frame so prominently, Graves responds, "He is their first born. He is their sin. He is their lust, and their loveâ<U+0080><U+0094>their everything. If he's gone, what's going to happen? Jaime is still trying to believe as hard as he possibly can that he's in love with Cersei. He can't admit that he is traumatized by his family and he's been forced his whole life to be something he doesn't want to be. What he isâ<U+0080><U+0094>but has to denyâ<U+0080><U+0094>is he is actually the good knight, like Brienne."
Â 
Now, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d argue with Graves that there are no truly good knights (or people) in Westeros, but what he says paints this scene as one that is nuanced and complex. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not saying that the question of â<U+0080><U+009C>was it rape?â<U+0080><U+009D> is nuanced; it was clearly a case of rape. But what Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m saying is that Jaime does snap when suddenly faced with his past. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a good knight, but he did return to Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing a better man than he was.
Â 
And this is why he suddenly doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care. He realizes in that moment that he has given everything, done everything for a â<U+0080><U+009C>hatefulâ<U+0080><U+009D> woman. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pushed Bran out the window, started a war, fathered children that he could never be close to, etc. And this sort of all comes crashing down on him in that moment of anger; he has to love Cersei despite the fact that sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his twin, despite the fact that their sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s corpse is right there, despite the fact that they could get caught, despite the fact that Cersei is begging him to stop. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not okay; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not an appropriate reaction; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not a justified moment. But I think it is perfectly in character with who he is. And in fact, even though it was darker, and very upsetting to watch, I feel like it was an almost better portrayal of Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character.
Â 
For people to say the show has committed a sin here I think is a stretch; theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not using the rape as a shock value, and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not inventing it out of thin air. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in the book, but because of the timeline change they made, Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s emotions in the scene are different. I think both fit with his character, both are instances of rape, and both are supposed to disturb us. Those who cry â<U+0080><U+009C>character assassinationâ<U+0080><U+009D> are looking for a clean redemption arc that simply doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t exist. Those who cry that Alex Graves may have a messed up view of consensual sex have a point.
Â 
As a final point, thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an argument to be made that if Martin doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t view his book scene as rape, or if Cersei doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t view either instance as rape, then we shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t consider it such. First of all, however I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think we can make blanket statements as to how rape victims â<U+0080><U+009C>shouldâ<U+0080><U+009D> act after the fact. Secondly, if Jaime and Cersei were real people, then perhaps theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>d be the only ones with a right to comment, despite the fact that they engage in a largely abusive relationship. But theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not. Theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re fictionalized characters in books and a show, which we are interacting with now. I think we should be allowed to comment on the sexual violence that both mediums depict.
Â 
Thirdly, Martin is not the man who gets to define what is or is not â<U+0080><U+009C>rape.â<U+0080><U+009D> He also doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t explicitly say it was consensualâ<U+0080>¦he merely points out the dynamic is different because Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just lost a son and feared her brother/lover was dead and he suddenly appears. If Martin does mean to say that Cersei does not consider the encounter a rape, then thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a fine comment to make. And to that I would point to my previous assertions about their relationship being one of dysfunction, which I think Martin has been clearly trying to paint throughout his books.
Â 
For me, criticizing Graves for his remarks that the show scene is one of sex that â<U+0080><U+009C>becomes consensualâ<U+0080><U+009D> is fair. I think it would have been best if, like the showrunners, he tried to explain why it is an aggravated rape scene and how that works in the context of the timeline and Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character arc.
Â 
However, I find the criticism that this scene somehow was out of place or ruined Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization to be false. Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a troubled figure, who is like to be grappling with the incredibly messed up nature of his relationship with Cersei for a long time, both in the books and the show. If you thought he was going to have a straight-forward and happy redemption arcâ<U+0080>¦you havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been paying attention.

If we oversimplify and distort things, then yes he "acts like a rapist" at times in both scenarios.
Â 
If we're grown ups who actually care about nuance and context, there is a world of difference between making an inappropriately aggressive pass at someone which is ultimately received in a consensual manner versus sexually forcing yourself upon someone who never at any point consents to your advance.
Â 
It's really, really freaking simple. Â The fact that 70+ pages into this conversation there are still people who don't get it is quite frankly extremely alarming.


Â 
Â 
There's no nuance in the cheesy lines "do me do me quick."Â  I don't think there's any need to insult me by implying that you have the grown up opinion.Â  I think people are upset because this scene makes Jaime look bad, where I think the book scene makes him look plenty bad.Â  The way I read the scene Jaime is forcing himself on Cersei and would not have suddenly stopped for any reason.Â  Thank god GRRM had Cersei give consent so we can continue to like Jaime, though.Â  I'm just curious where we draw the line and decide it's okay to forgive somebody for their rapacious behavior.Â  Again, Jaime's behavior in the show is quite consistent, it's Cersei that behaves differently by not giving verbal consent.Â  You are all sugarcoating Jaime's actions in the book.
3452	digiFemme	2014-04-23	Â 
The funny thing is that I agree with the beginning: Especially at this point (especially after losing a hand, a son, and another king) he would do anything to preserve the relationsship with Cersei, because that's almost all he has left and that he cares about, but that's exactly why I disagree with the fact he wouldn't do it. Because as weird as it sounds, due to how distubring, weird and completly destructive their relationship is, what happens in the Sept is part of exactly that: Preserving their relationship (which "getting physical" is a huge part of).
Would it be out of character for Jaime at this point to rape any other woman: yes, I would go as far as even sleeping with another woman would be out of character as it would be cheating on Cersei.
I know this might sound extremly weird to any sane person, but this is how messed up I see their relationship.


Â 
I guess I just don't see how his doing that to her will preserve their relationship. It does the opposite, IMHO. If he did anything she didn't want or made her truly angry to the point of not forgiving him, she'd definitely retaliate and find a way to end what was going on between them. As reckless as Jaime is, I think he knows this. The fact that they have to sneak around makes it difficult enough for them...but if she chose simply not to be with him, she could. And that could happen if he hurt her.
Â 
As twisted as Cersei is (yes, she likes it rough and vicious as she is), I don't think she'd stand for anyone to do that to her (even Jaime); in fact, since rape is an act of power over another person I'd go so far as to say I find it easier to see her attempt it rather than tolerate being a victim of it.
Â 
This is not to say that Cersei isn't a victim in general. I see her as both a victim and as an antagonist. But her relationship with Jaime was the one part of her life where she didn't play that part...even if it didn't do them any good.
Â 

Â 


Â 
Â 
This is the part that seems to be driving everyone crazy for some odd reason. If peopleÂ trulyÂ only cared about Jaime's character being changed, then they wouldn't be saying things like "Jaime better be punished next episode!"
Â 
The overall outrage is not about Jaime's character being changed, but more about people thinking GoT is a documentary and these are not actors.Â 

Â 


Â 
I can see why they are confused. These characters are fictional and aren't depicted as a hundred percent realistic, even if the writer does show some realities when it comes to the darker side of human nature. It makes them very hard to interpret...I felt that GRRM was writing opposite arcs for Tyrion and Jaime where the former got worse as the series progressed whereas the latter went the opposite in that he 'got better' Not arguing how realistic this is btw. Â But sometimes the changes in the TV show can give mixed signals.Â
3453	Sigrunn	2014-04-23	However, having said that, if a woman is saying, "no" "stop" while she's forcibly pulling her "rapist" towards herself and passionately kissing him, I really have to make the judgement call that those actions matter. 


Â 
This is a fickle subject... What the body wants, the mind rejects ("It's not right"). This is like giving a cookie to a person on a diet. Obviously, if they're weak, they'll take it. Tempting one might be seen as evil. The actions that you're talking about show that she's weak and nothing more. That the producers had in mind to film something else, I have no doubt. However, this consensual sex scene was poorly executed here.

Â 
I personally also don't think it does preserve the relationship, I just think that in Jaime's head at that very moment "being with Cersei" is the only thing that is able to make things better again for both (!) of them. It's his way of fixing things in that moment. Maybe a little bit comparable to the typical slap in the face of a person that is just having a breakdown due to something horrible happening.
I don't thing there is much logical thinking behind it, it's: our life is messed up - finally we are back together - let's really be together and everything will be better now. That's why to me they still somewhat messed up the scene due to placing it at a different point, where they already met, because that takes part of the "finally, now I need it here and right now" away from the scene, but overall I don't see Jaimes arc ruined as I read the scene already in the books more "grey" then some might argue here and the Jaime arc still makes a lot of sense to me, because I never saw it much different than what we end up with now in the show.

Â 
Sorry but I disagree. The world is what Martin describes it, yes. But eventually the way he describes it and the characters in it, is making up a picture in my head about how I feel about it and the characters and this is and can not be not mixed with my believes and experiences in life so far. So there are things that Martin will not be able to decide for me and this includes how I feel about certain people and situations.
3459	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-23	Just because there are so many posts about this scene and the books, I feel the need to keep presenting this for reference. I'd hope that opinions on the book are based on what the author has to say about various character motivations, as it would be those characters who consented or not. Regardless of how you interpret it, GRRMs opinion on what characters think should be the base of that interpretation.
The more full quote from GRRM:In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffreys death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself, that she has lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before her. Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her.
The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and he and Cersei have been in each others company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why [producers] played the sept out differently. But thats just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.
Also, I was writing the scene from Jaimes POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You dont know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing.
If the show had retained some of Cerseis dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline.
Thats really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.

Â 
Graves defined the show scene as one that "turned consensual," and yet I think it's right that we view it as a rape scene.
Â 
Martin is not the authority of what "rape" vs. "consent" looks like. He can comment on how violence against women is dealt with in his world, or how characters respond to it. If his point is that to Jaime and Cersei, it wasn't rape, then I'd direct you to my comments that I make afterwards, saying that it showcases the problematic nature of their relationship. However, if Martin is saying that a women in Cersei's position is not being raped, then that brings up more troubling concerns about his own views. But because he was vague and doesn't explicitly state this, let's not go there.

3464	digiFemme	2014-04-23	I'm not trying to offend anyone here but surely anyone can see why the text is more than a bit complicated- and no doubt the reason why people end up interpreting the scenes in different ways?
Â 
Let's say that I agree that it WAS rape in the text. Well, in a realistic scenario, what woman would do this
Â 

â<U+0080><U+009C>Hurry,â<U+0080><U+009D> she was whispering now, â<U+0080><U+009C>quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime
Jaime Jaime.â<U+0080><U+009D> Her hands helped guide him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D> Cersei said as he thrust, â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother,
sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re
home.â<U+0080><U+009D> She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair. Jaime lost himself in her
flesh. He could feel Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heart beating in time with his own, and the wetness of blood
and seed where they were joined.

Â 
Â 
after saying no, protesting, hitting the guy, telling him to stop, etc? It's almost like a Jekyll/Hyde reaction?!
Â 
In a realistic scenario, what woman would (after the act) behave as if nothing bad happened with nothing more than a, 'oh we could've been caught!' reaction? And probably sneak off to meet him again after?
Â 
The problem is that we are comparing real life situations to twisted fictional characters who have very disturbing relationships in a hyper-exaggerated negative world. I'm not necessarily closed to other people's interpretation of the text as rape...but my question is, if Cersei didn't like how she and Jaime got on, why didn't she simply shout out for help? Why was she tolerating it? Unlike her situation with Robert, she had the power to stop him but all their encounters turn out a certain, predictable, way.Â 
Â 
In those exact circumstances in the Sept, she could've hit him, bit him or shouted with so many septons (not to mention their father) nearby. If she feared discovery when they came upon them she could've just made up some excuse for her shout, and used their presence to leave the Sept...and after that, made sure she and Jaime were never alone. She CAN and is capable of doing that.Â 
Â 
Rape is about power. And ok...for the sake of argument, I'm not going to argue with however people choose to interpret the text.Â 
Â 
If we are to agree that Jaime did rape Cersei in the sept...then shouldn't we agree that he raped her in practically all their encounters (since the text does describe it that way- with her protesting at first, then giving in, etc). ; if that's the case, are we to agree that Cersei is Jaime's victim?Â Given the characters personalities in mind- given that Cersei hated her time with Robert and craves power, she doesn't strike me as the type (twisted as she is) who Â would tolerate such. This is where it gets difficult for me...I don't see Cersei as Jaime's victim.Â 
Â 
----
Â 
For the record, I think the way it came out in the TV ep was badly done. I don't think the show runners meant for it to come out that way, but they were careless and should've reviewed the scene before releasing it. This is how I feel about the many changes from the book...before you whitewash a character, or give more scenes to another character (even if her role isn't supposed to be that big) at the expense of another(who is supposed to have a bigger role in the grand scheme of things), please think how it will affect the overall story and character developments in the future.Â

3467	Cas Stark	2014-04-23	GRRM created "Cersei Lannister" and "Jamie Lannister" and everything about them, so if he says that the encounter in the Sept in the book was consensual, then it was, yes, because he says so, because he is the final arbiter of what is true or false in Westeros.Â

Â 
If I have two characters engage in a scene where a woman is voicing objection to sex and punching his chest to stop, while the man tears off her clothing and shoves his hand up her legs, and then she gives in, and I say that the characters felt that this was consensual love-making, I would be offering my critique on the nature of their relationship, not how society should view rape. I think Martin is doing the same. I'm not trying to bastardize his work or force my views on to his characters; I am trying to explain the way in which the dynamic between Book!Jaime and Book!Cersei is not drastically different from the show's portrayal, given that both showcase a troubled relationship punctuated by acts of violence.
Â 
I agree that Book!Cersei views the sept scene as consensual. I'm actually not sure how Show!Cersei will view what transpired, so we'll wait and see. And for me, Jaime's actions are in line with his characterization in both cases. I do not, however, find either scene to be one without issues of consent. Even within Westerosi standards, I maintain that there would be women in this world who would view the encounter as forced sex. I'm sorry if this paints Jaime in a darker shade of grey than you're comfortable with, but I'm saying it is fallacious to cry "character assassination" for Show!Jaime when both the book and show scenes are in line with his actions and the nature of his relationship with Cersei.
3470	DaveyJoe	2014-04-23	I agree, in both the book and the show Jaime seems to have a very agressive sexual nature when it comes to Cersei.Â  I don't remember anybody complaining about this scene in season 1:
Â

Â 
Show Jaime's actions in the sept are perfectly in character.Â  The only change in that scene is Cersei's lack of verbal consent.
3471	Dofs	2014-04-23	To anyone who says that in the book Jaime raped Cersei as well. Consider this instance in the White Tower:Â 
Â 
Â 
â<U+0080>Jaime," she sobbed, "don't you think I want it as much as you do? It makes no matter who they wed me to, I want you at my side, I want you in my bed, I want you inside me. Nothing has changed between us. Let me prove it to you." She pushed up his tunic and began to fumble with the laces of his breeches.
Jaime felt himself responding. "No," he said, "not here." They had never done it in White Sword Tower, much less in the Lord Commander's chambers. "Cersei, this is not the place."
"You took me in the sept. This is no different." She drew out his cock and bent her head over it.
Jaime pushed her away with the stump of his right hand. "No. Not here, I said." He forced himself to stand.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Cersei was forcing herself on Jaime against his will. I guess Cersei was trying to rape Jaime? If Jaime gave in to Cersei's advances after all, instead of firmly refusing, would he have been still raped by Cersei?
3472	starki	2014-04-23	There was consent on her part in the books. There is no consent in the TV series. That's why it's causing a stir and is rape.
3473	Theladystoneheart	2014-04-23	I guess the series saw it as her kissing him back as her way of consenting.Â  However I think they did this scene a big injustice.Â  Pretty disappointed with it
3474	A Man Is A Man	2014-04-23	Â I'm personally at a cross-roads with watching the show now. I feel like they are voyeuristically putting in rape scenes where none existed in the books merely to be exploitive. I can't watch a show that treats rape like that, that treats it as titillation. They did it with Dany/Drogo and now they are doing it with Jamie/Cersei. Makes me wonder how messed up D&D are, basically.

Â 
Right, there's no consent or return of affection there at all... 
Â 
Hugging and kissing is just her way of saying "help, i'm being raped"

If I have two characters engage in a scene where a woman is voicing objection to sex and punching his chest to stop, while the man tears off her clothing and shoves his hand up her legs, and then she gives in, and I say that the characters felt that this was consensual love-making, I would be offering my critique on the nature of their relationship, not how society should view rape. I think Martin is doing the same. I'm not trying to bastardize his work or force my views on to his characters; I am trying to explain the way in which the dynamic between Book!Jaime and Book!Cersei is not drastically different from the show's portrayal, given that both showcase a troubled relationship punctuated by acts of violence.


Â 
This is well put, and I totally agree with your assessment of the scene in the book.Â  I think GRRM was further establishing how fucked up their relationship is (with their location, Jaime forcing himself on Cersei, and Cersei giving in), and Jaime's actions in the show really aren't very different from what he does in the book.Â  I'm not sure I agree, however, that the dynamic of their relationship is close to the book's representation.Â  I think Cersei's (eventual) consent/hunger/whatever is necessary for Cersei's character, and demonstrating her role in their fucked up relationship.Â  It really all comes down to the way the aftermath goes down.

I guess so, unless we're going to have a different threshold for male v. female sexual aggression.
Â 
This is a nice find, and further evidence that the book sept scene was wholly consensual.

Cherry picking any given moment doesn't make a difference. Let's look at her actions :

You're a hateful women...and he grabs her.

1)Notice the inviting (ie terrified) look in her eyes ?

2) "Jaime, not here...please".
3) "Stop it" and she shoves him away even as they're both lying on the floor.
4) "It's not right". And she's crying at the end.

How many more ways of "NO" do you need ?
3481	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-23	Excellent post, Chebyshov, I agree wtih your interpretations of the book and show scene.


Â 
Agree, that was an excellent and beyond in depth analysis. These discussions have made me look at the book scene differently and the part that gets stuck in my head is: would Jaime have stopped if Cersei didn't say "do me now" and we don't know for sure, but I'm leaning toward I don't think so and I'm making peace with this scene in the show. Â This analysis certainly helps.

Â 
Thanks! I'm glad to hear it's helped. I've been working through my own thoughts and feelings about what we saw in this episode; it's certainly a heavy scene to unpack (in both the show and the books). The's show's scene was certainly jarring to experience, but I don't think it was intended to be voyeuristic or for "shock-value," which is why I've made my peace with it as well. The show's portrayal really made me ruminate on this complex issue, so it's definitely gratifying to know that my thoughts have resonated with a few others.Â 
Â 
Â 


I've seen it it argued Â on this board that the Dany/Drogo wedding scene in the book was rape too. Â Â 


Â 
Yeah, this brings up the "age of consent" issue, but the book scene was so focused on Drogo making sure he'd get a "yes," and allowing Dany to lead it, that I think it's easily safe to view the show's portrayal as major deviation from the book. Perhaps because the writers aged up Dany, they wanted her to be in a situation that was just as exploitative and problematic for us to witness, but I think given Viserys's comment about letting the entire Dothraki tribe and their horses rape her if that's what it took, we didn't necessarily need the stakes raised by having a less-sympathetic Drogo.
Â 
I wasn't around the boards then, and I know the viewership was smaller, but I'm wondering if there was any outcry?

I'm sorry but this doesn't even compare. Even if we agree their first intercourse was consensual (which is doubtful), he repeatedly raped her afterwards. Fundamentally, it doesn't change much about Drogo's character : he's a rapist in the books and he's a rapist in the show; Jaime isn't.

Â 
That's his choice, and we can't tell him how to make it. Most men would not report it. Hell, I would likely not report it. Many women don't report their rapes because of rape culture and victim blaiming.

Â 
Yeah, you know AGoT is the book with which I'm the least familiar (only read it in full once, rather quickly, and on second "reads" it was choice chapters to look for something specific). I just had a look at her chapters and he definitely rapes her repeatedly (not sure how I glossed over that before), so it's really not that terrible for the show-runners to have depicted it as such on their wedding night. Thanks for pointing this out!
Â 
That makes me want to start a proper reread, which I haven't had time to do yet. I do, however, disagree about Jaime, but my post on page 15 makes that pretty clear.

Â

Â 
Yes
3487	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-23	Â 
Most of the main anti-heros of the best tv shows have characters that lull you in 'oh he or she isn't such a bad guy', then bam! they do something truly horrible you did not expect, Tony Soprano (and Silvio and Paulie), Walter White, Al Swerengen, Gaius Baltar, Dexter and so on they have all done unspeakable things after you get to know them and to a certain extent have started to root for them.
Â 
Redemption does not have to be linear, or be permanent, or even happen at all. And characters, as with real people, do not have to be consistant. The Hound can be shown as having redeeming qualities (and becomeÂ a fan favourite) after murdering a child, one of whose acts afterwards includes protecting a child. And there is much sympathy for a broken Theon despite the fact he too murdered two innocent children.
Â 
Rape is obviously a special case in how people react to it compared to other horrible crimes, soÂ it could be interesting where they take Jaime's character now. If a child murderer like The Hound can find some sort of redemption, can a rapist? I don't know if this is possible to pull this off in a mature fashion in the show, and admittedly GoT may not get it right, but let's see if there is any fallout first. I can't help but think that Jaime will end up paying for his sins (in book as well as show). I can't really see any way a rapist would be accepted as redeemed apart from maybe sacrificing themselves in some fashion.Â But let's see.Â If the show fails to address it at all, then I acquiesce - that would be very poor form.


Â 
I think I'm finally getting caught up on the middle of the thread.Â  Can I just fangurl for a minute over Dr. Vice President?Â
3488	mankytoes	2014-04-23	Book Jaime has shown no remorse for trying to kill a small child. Is that really not as bad as rape? He's still a very dark character. My take on him is that he's trying to do some good, but he is fighting his very nature, he is inherently so selfish. Brienne bought out his better side, Cersei has bought out his worst. I don't have a problem with it. If a show deals with murder, it can deal with rape. And they are allowed some creative freedom, if you can't stand any minor changes from the book, just stop watching and whinging.
3489	Legion of Doom	2014-04-23	I realize people-myself included-were particularly alarmed by the addition of this scene because Jaime seems to have been evolving into a better person. But TV Jaime is the same character who attempted to murder a 10 year old boy and who did murder his cousin all so he could be with his sister. That this person, now one-handed and furious his sister will barely look at him, then does something so horrendous and awful, is more consistent with the character than fans probably want/wanted to believe. Jaime may have good in him, but he's proven all along that he also has great wickedness.
Â 
The far bigger issue to me isn't that this scene was added, it's that the director doesn't even think it was rape. That bothers me a lot more than that they made Jaime into a greater, albeit, still complicated monster than in the books.
3490	Tadco26	2014-04-23	Â 
You're excusing Book Jaime's actions.Â  Can you point out how his behavior is different in the two scenes?Â  In both scenes he's ignoring Cersei's pleas and continuing his advances on her.


Sure, in the book this is the passage that the show omits:
Â 
Â 

Hurry,â<U+0080><U+009D> she was whispering now, â<U+0080><U+009C>quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime.â<U+0080><U+009D> Her hands helped guide him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D> Cersei said as he thrust, â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home.â<U+0080><U+009D> She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair. Jaime lost himself in her flesh. He could feel Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heart beating in time with his own, and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined..

Â 
Â 
This isn't just a kiss after he is already inside her.Â  It's pretty clear that in the book Cersei had no objection against having sex with Jaime, her objection was with getting caught having sex with Jaime.Â  This is further emphasized by the key aftermath discussion that the show to this point has omitted:
Â 
Â 

"This was folly". Cersei pulled her gown straight. "with Father in the castle... Jaime, we must be careful." (note this is further evidence that Tywin doesn't believe the rumors about them)
"I am sick of being careful. The Targaryens wed brother to sister, why shouldn't we do the same? Marry me, Cersei. Stand up before the realm and say it's me you want. We'll have our own wedding feast, and make another son in place of Joffrey."
She drew back. "That's not funny."
"Do you hear me chuckling?"
"Did you leave your wits at Riverun?" Her voice had an edge to it.
"Tommen's throne derives from Robert, you know that."
"He'll have Casterly Rock, isn't that enough? Let Father sit the throne. All I want is you."
He made to touch her cheek. Old habits die hard, and it was his right arm he lifted.
Cersei recoiled from his stump. "Don't... don't talk like this. You're scaring me Jaime. Don't be stupid. One wrong word and you will cost us everything. What did they do to you?
"They cut off my hand."
No, it's more, you're changed." She backed off a step. We'll talk later....

Â 
Â 
Also consider the difference in timing.Â  The book happens the first time they have seen each other since his return, in the show he has been back for a while and she has already rejected him.Â  He also starts the scene in the show by calling her a hateful woman, where in the books his mind is on asking her to marry him.Â  Book Cersei never objected to having sex with JaimeÂ because she didn't want the sex, she didn't want to have sex because she didn't want to risk getting caught.Â  Without their disagreement about hiding their relationshipÂ post-sex, the whole scene kind of looses it's point in furthering their story line.
3491	MoA«t	2014-04-23	Â 
I agree it won't be mentioned next episode, but that is because the production thought they communicated a consensual scene.


Â 
Which many people saw as consensual when Cersi grabbed, kissed, and wrapped her legs around Jamie, instead of screaming, "get the fuck off me."
3492	Tadco26	2014-04-23	Of course if she did yell that then someone would have come, and with the rumors Stannis spread that probably wouldn't go over too well for her even if it wasn't consensual this time.Â  I agree that there was some slight signs of it turning consensual, but it was waay too slanted towards non-consensual to leave it with a subtle clue that maybe she didn't mind.Â  Bottom line being that most non-readers I have talked to or heard discuss the scene considered it rape, where the book scene, rape never crossed my mind.

3493	Chebyshov	2014-04-23	For anyone who likes podcasts, this one has a really fantastic conversation about this episode, this scene specifically, and the show in general (book spoilers present, but I figured this thread would be safe):Â http://fightinginthe...n-and-the-frog/
3494	MoA«t	2014-04-23	The scene in the show is not one of consensual sex. To say that sex can â<U+0080><U+009C>becomeâ<U+0080><U+009D> consensual is a troubling notion.Â 


Â 
First, I want to say, MAGNIFICENT POST. I don't agree, but seriously awesome, and a great read. Honestly.Â  
Â 
The above snippet is the main thing I take exception to, and here's why: Relationships consist of more than one person. In this case, we'll keep it to two. In the beginning of a relationship, when sex is new and awesome, the times when both of you are interested in sex are frequent. But as anyone in a long-time relationship knows, that changes, and trying to find times when you're both in the mood, gets harder for many reasons.
Â 
Of course sex can become consensual - EVERY DAMN DAY in Real Life.Â 
Â 
Partner 1: Hi honey, I'm home.
Partner 2: Oh hey babe, how was your day?
1: You look luscious!
2: Awe thanks, I'm tired as hell.
1: Oh. No energy for a little quickie?
2: No way babe. I'm beat. Maybe later.
1: Ok, come here, let me rub your shouders.
2: Thanks........ mmmm... that feels good.
1: How does this feel (kisses 2's neck)
2: mmmmmm ammmmazing
1: And this? (gently bites 2's ear lobe)
2: mmmmm gooooooood
1: finding a little energy?
2: (giggle) maybe......Â 
Â 
(they rip each others clothes off and have wild crazy monkey sex)
Â 
Now for many on this forum, according to your rules, the above either can't happen, or is still considered rape.
Â 
Life isn't black & white. It's gray. Very gray. Gray upon gray with varying shades of more gray.
Â 
ANYTHING can become consensual, and to say that it's "disturbing" reeks of very narrow life experience.
Â 
"Hey let's get Chinese food tonight."
"Meh..... I'm not feeling it. No."
"steamed dumplings and maybe some crispy duck????
"I love steamed dumplings...... OKAY"
Â 
"I don't want to have a midweek wedding."
"It's cheaper, and the venue we want is available, plus we can invite more people with the money we save."
"ok"
Â 
"Hey babe, wanna play?"
"no babe - we might wake the baby"
"I'll wear a gag."
"to see that, OK!"
Â 
Changing your mind about sex is changing your mind about sex. If I say "no", then think about it and decide I really want to, why on earth would that still be rape? I'm an adult, and perfectly capable of making my own decisions - even if I'm "coerced", I'm not forced against my will.
Â 
I think the biggest problem with this scene is that it went too fast for a lot of people, and they didn't pick up on Cersei's actions (grabbing/kissing/wrapping her legs around him at the end), and only picked up on her lines.Â 
Â 
But of course, if you're a firm believer that no one ever changes their mind about sex, or that it doesn't matter even if they did, it's still rape...... then ? 
Â 
EDIT - oh also - I do think it's important that GRRM said it was consensual in the book. He wrote it. It's his story. How people can disagree with an author about his own work I find hilarious and mind boggling.
Â 
...and because I'm a spelling spaz today.

					
					
							Edited by MoA«t, 23 April 2014 - 02:45 PM.
3495	SeventySeven	2014-04-23	GRRM created "Cersei Lannister" and "Jamie Lannister" and everything about them, so if he says that the encounter in the Sept in the book was consensual, then it was, yes, because he says so, because he is the final arbiter of what is true or false in Westeros.Â 


Â 
Oh god, thank you. It's beyond me how so many people still argue what the author says; he wrote it, surely he'll know better what he meant?Â  
Â 
As for all the people insisting the theme of redemption was never explored with Jaime there you go here
Â 
One of the things I wanted to explore with Jaime, and with so many of the characters, is the whole issue of redemption. When can we be redeemed? Is redemption even possible?Â 

Â 
Again, this is grrm. Narratively speaking, in the books Jaime doesn't do a lot of back and forth with his arc. He changes while travelling with Brienne for a lot of reasons, gets back to KL and has that one sick moment with Cersei which makes sense in context as he's not been back for weeks and has already been rejected by her, doesn't rape her, and from that moment on he tries to be the person he aspires to be. Does he always succeeds? No. But he doesn't wishy-washily regresses to fit in with his family. It's the whole writing of Jaime to be off this season, and the sept scene was the crowning moment of this crap.Â 
Â 
Just to clarify though, my major issue is that it was insulting, unnecessary use of sexual violence that had no business being there, first of all.

Â 
Hey, thanks for taking the time to go through it. I'd argue that your scenario about rubbing a partner's shoulders to get them in the mood is different than forcing yourself on somebody in front of their son's corpse until they give into your demands. In the case of Jaime/Cersei, he never stopped the act in either medium. This is why it is rape. Obviously sexual consent is not an easily defined subject, and I know where you stand on it, so let's just leave it there. I found your description of "my rules" to be a bit reductive.Â 
Â 
Moving on, in direct response to what you just wrote, let me point you to an earlier post of mine, quoted below.
Â 
Â 
If I have two characters engage in a scene where a woman is voicing objection to sex and punching his chest to stop, while the man tears off her clothing and shoves his hand up her legs, and then she gives in, and I say that the characters felt that this was consensual love-making, I would be offering my critique on the nature of their relationship, not how society should view rape. I think Martin is doing the same. I'm not trying to bastardize his work or force my views on to his characters; I am trying to explain the way in which the dynamic between Book!Jaime and Book!Cersei is not drastically different from the show's portrayal, given that both showcase a troubled relationship punctuated by acts of violence.
Â 
I agree that Book!Cersei views the sept scene as consensual. I'm actually not sure how Show!Cersei will view what transpired, so we'll wait and see. And for me, Jaime's actions are in line with his characterization in both cases. I do not, however, find either scene to be one without issues of consent. Even within Westerosi standards, I maintain that there would be women in this world who would view the encounter as forced sex. I'm sorry if this paints Jaime in a darker shade of grey than you're comfortable with, but I'm saying it is fallacious to cry "character assassination" for Show!Jaime when both the book and show scenes are in line with his actions and the nature of his relationship with Cersei.
3497	Dofs	2014-04-23	Â 
Yes


So, Cersei is as much a rapist as Jaime then Â Â  
Â 
But this thinking is really making me laugh. Jaime and Cersei were lovers since children (or even earlierÂ  ). Jaime did not force himself in the book on some random woman, it was the woman that was his lover, the only woman that have been his lover. For Cersei as well, he is the person that was his lover since forever, her protector, the guy, who would do anything for her. She feared he would kill Robert if she told everything Robert was doing to her. In the sept they met after maybe a year being apart with Cersei believing he could die. "No, means no" is good and all but, for example, if a wife wants to have sex with her husband but her husband tells her no because he wants to finish watching a football game, but then thinks 'ah, screw it' Â and have sex with her anyway, he was not raped and if someone tells him that he was raped and he should charge his wife, the husband would laugh in that person's face and call him an idiot.
Â 
Same situation with Cersei. She clearly wanted to have sex with Jaime, just the place was not appropriate. She would gladly had gone to other place and have sex right then but she saw that Jaime did not care about the place and went 'screw it' and gave in no matter the place. HerÂ 
'I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home'
with home obviously meaning her vagina plainly shows how happy Cersei was to have sex with Jaime, to feel whole again, how she likes to say.Â  
If someone told her that Jaime raped her, she would call that someone a moron.
Â 
And thinking that If Cersei seriously resisted and clearly said that he just didn't want to have sex with him, Jaime would have taken her anyway is strange, considering that, first with having only left hand, he probably wouldn't be able to do it physically, and second, he was absolutely loyal to Cersei and not only in sexual way. Seriously, before losing his hand, he was basically her yes-man, capable of carrying out her most gruesome wishes and doing terrible things to protect her. If people think that as he threw Bran out of the window, that means he was capable of rape as well, should try to ver carefully reread Jaime chapters without Bran bias.

If you want to write your own story, go ahead. I hope any fans you get don'tÂ tell youÂ whatÂ youÂ meant by each scene.Â 

Â 





GRRM created "Cersei Lannister" and "Jamie Lannister" and everything about them, so if he says that the encounter in the Sept in the book was consensual, then it was, yes, because he says so, because he is the final arbiter of what is true or false in Westeros.Â

Â 
So Cersei gave consent in the show?
3500	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-23	@ Chebyshov : hey no problem, I'm currently on an AGoT reread so obviously it's fresh in my mind.
Â 


Book Jaime has shown no remorse for trying to kill a small child. Is that really not as bad as rape? He's still a very dark character. My take on him is that he's trying to do some good, but he is fighting his very nature, he is inherently so selfish. Brienne bought out his better side, Cersei has bought out his worst. I don't have a problem with it. If a show deals with murder, it can deal with rape. And they are allowed some creative freedom, if you can't stand any minor changes from the book, just stop watching and whinging.


Those are crimes of different nature. Being capable of one doesn't mean you're capable of the other. It's basically like saying a thief could easily be murderer, rapist, etc.. and vice versa.
3501	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-23	Â 
Which many people saw as consensual when Cersi grabbed, kissed, and wrapped her legs around Jamie, instead of screaming, "get the fuck off me."


Â 
And many more people did not see as consensual.
3502	Tadco26	2014-04-23	Â 
First, I want to say, MAGNIFICENT POST. I don't agree, but seriously awesome, and a great read. Honestly.Â  
Â 
The above snippet is the main thing I take exception to, and here's why: Relationships consist of more than one person. In this case, we'll keep it to two. In the beginning of a relationship, when sex is new and awesome, the times when both of you are interested in sex are frequent. But as anyone in a long-time relationship knows, that changes, and trying to find times when you're both in the mood, gets harder for many reasons.
Â 
Of course sex can become consensual - EVERY DAMN DAY in Real Life.Â 
Â 
Partner 1: Hi honey, I'm home.
Partner 2: Oh hey babe, how was your day?
1: You look luscious!
2: Awe thanks, I'm tired as hell.
1: Oh. No energy for a little quickie?
2: No way babe. I'm beat. Maybe later.
1: Ok, come here, let me rub your shouders.
2: Thanks........ mmmm... that feels good.
1: How does this feel (kisses 2's neck)
2: mmmmmm ammmmazing
1: And this? (gently bites 2's ear lobe)
2: mmmmm gooooooood
1: finding a little energy?
2: (giggle) maybe......Â 
Â 
(they rip each others clothes off and have wild crazy monkey sex)
Â 
Now for many on this forum, according to your rules, the above either can't happen, or is still considered rape.
Â 
Life isn't black & white. It's gray. Very gray. Gray upon gray with varying shades of more gray.
Â 
ANYTHING can become consensual, and to say that it's "disturbing" reeks of very narrow life experience.
Â 
Â 


In your example, they aren't having sex already when she changes her mind. It's a key difference! In the show Jaime was already having sex with her before the sublte clues that maybe she was ok with it after all. In the books her hands guide him in... Certainly you can convince someone to do something that initially they might not want to. It's different from forcing them to do something and hoping that they change their mind after the fact.
Â 
Â 
You're right that in the end it's how Cersei viewed the act that determines if it was rape or not. The show doesn't have the benefit of internal monologues though, and having so far left out the post-sex discussion about their relationship, it's not surprising that most viewers saw what happened as rape. Perhaps they make it more clear next episode, but if their intention was for it to be percieved as anything other than rape, I would say the average viewer didn't get that.
Â 
Cersei didn't "rape" Jaime in the Tower of the Hand by trying to seduce him, but if after his refusal, she was physically capable of pinning him down and having her way with him, then yes that would be rape.Â Â 
Â 
And to the original post's question, I think all of the issues listed have been discussed in equal detail by someone over the course of the show.Â  Different people are bothered by different things, but I can guarantee that all of the other changes mentioned have threads complaining about them too.

Â 
Yes. Kissing, grabbing, and wrapping your legs around the person as he's entering you, don't seem to be the actions of a woman getting raped - to me, anyway.
3504	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-23	Sure, in the book this is the passage that the show omits:
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
This isn't just a kiss after he is already inside her.Â  It's pretty clear that in the book Cersei had no objection against having sex with Jaime, her objection was with getting caught having sex with Jaime.Â  This is further emphasized by the key aftermath discussion that the show to this point has omitted:
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Also consider the difference in timing.Â  The book happens the first time they have seen each other since his return, in the show he has been back for a while and she has already rejected him.Â  He also starts the scene in the show by calling her a hateful woman, where in the books his mind is on asking her to marry him.Â  Book Cersei never objected to having sex with JaimeÂ because she didn't want the sex, she didn't want to have sex because she didn't want to risk getting caught.Â  Without their disagreement about hiding their relationshipÂ post-sex, the whole scene kind of looses it's point in furthering their story line.


Â 
While I suspect the show will not address anything about the Sept scene itself, I am wondering if they will still have Jaime wanting to marry her, if he brings that up at all.Â  I'm of the mind that the show will just jump to Cersei trying to get him to kill Tyrion, or catch Sansa, and I'm not so sure if they will even address the idea of Jaime wanting to come clean to the world and marry her.Â  I suppose next episode will tell us, I hope so anyway.Â  It would address, a bit, where TVJaime's mind is now and where the show runners think it was during the Sept scene.Â

Â 
The show is the same as my example. She was kissing him, grabbing him, and pulling him towards her before they ever got onto the floor, and before he was ever close to being inside her. And if we get technical (silly really when it comes to film/TV), I doubt that Jamie would be able to rape her with only one hand, because I seriously doubt he'd be able to have sex with her with one hand without her assistance, and all that fabric, small clothes, etc.
3506	ovis alba	2014-04-23	Â 
Oh god, thank you. It's beyond me how so many people still argue what the author says; he wrote it, surely he'll know better what he meant?Â  
Â 


Â 
I'm actually not disagreeing with anything Martin says, however I still find both scenes quiet similar in regards to Jaime.
And I also don't get the "the author says it so it is universally true and wrong what other people's perception of it is" this is exactly what people criticize (and to me quiet well understandable) about the show runners. They also "made" the scene so they should know better what it means than the viewer, still people say for them the scene wass a pure rape, although the show runners say otherwise.

I can just add to the other praises (and I'm proud to me quoted  ), I don't agree to every little bit maybe, but the overall comparison book and show describes my impression of it extremly well and I could never put it that nicely.

Â 
Well I agree that the show would have been better if it showed full penetration after Lena grabbed Nik's cock, but that would garner a whole different set of complaints.
Â 
I think this scene should make us reevaluate the scene in the book and their relationship as a whole.Â  I think Jaime and Cersei have a push/pull relationship that is highly disfunctional and sometimes violent.Â  Both the books have a precedent of Jaime being aggressively sexual with Cersei.Â  This controversey has caused me to ask if Jaime would have stopped if Cersei never gave vocal consent in the books, and I don't think he would have.Â  I think people are freaking out because they aren't given a clear "do me" line that conveniently allows them to continue to like Jaime.Â  Jaime does good and bad things before and after his "redemption" arc, and is forcing himself on Cersei in both the book and the show.Â  His greatest act is probably saving King's Landing, which was before he met Brienne, yeah he saved her, but that doesn't really compare.Â  I think he acts selfishly, his feelings move from Cersei to Brienne, and when he's done wtih Cersei he simply leaves her to her fate when she needs him the most.Â  Once readers get inside Jaime's head they start to sugarcoat his actions.Â  I love ASOIAF because the characters are so grey, and I'm okay with the show portraying the sept scene greyer than the book did.

Â 
I also don't understand the people losing their shit over this scene. Cersei's actions make it at least somewhat consensual in my eyes, although in both the book and the show it is consensual sex with rape elements woven into it. It's either you're not paying enough attention to the actor's physical expression or you have an over idealistic view of Jaime in my opinion.

Â 
Well put, and for me the grey characers are why I love the world Martin's created (Planetos?Â   ) so much as well.
Â 
I do want to say that throughout this thread I'm never trying to purport that there is a right and wrong way to read or watch this scene and react to it. Dealing with Jaime as a PoV character is especially challenging, becauseÂ 
1. We are lulled into the the "redemption arc" trope. It feels familiar and we know how this plays out. What is both disquieting and fantastic for the reader is that Martin pushes against most literary themes. I think the case of Jaime is no different. And,
2. In the book scene, we are in the mind of the aggressor. That's never an easy place to be, and I think part of our desire to save our image of Jaime comes from our want to distance ourselves from the attack. The show's medium strips us of this PoV, this lens through which we experienced Jaime's arc, though, and I think that's powerful. Going back and reexamining the nature of Jaime and Cersei's relationship in the books because of what we watched on the show I think was an important exercise.
Â 
And forÂ thatÂ reason, I don't view the show's depiction of the sept scene to be one thrown in for "shock" value, or one that fundamentally ruins a character. It was thoughtfully done and well executed in line with the very grey-nature of Jaime Lannister.
Â 
Wading through this murky universe of ASOIAF is challenging at times, but I can't rebuke the show for forcing us to deal with its more unsavory elements head-on. Of course adaptations are never going to be perfect...but I'm certainly going to be along for the ride with this one.

You seem to miss the point all together. It's not about literally showing Cersei guiding Jaime in. That's just one glaring example of evidence that it was not meant to be rape in the book. The point is she was an active participant before any sex actually happens, where in the show she is fighting him even when the camera cuts away. If you don't see the difference in a woman saying:
Â 
Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D> Cersei said as he thrust, â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home.â<U+0080><U+009D> She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair.
Â 
vs
Â 
Fighting him off and saying it't not right after repeated no's after being forced into sex on the ground while Jaime says he doesn't care, I don't really know how we can even debate this.
Â 
Beyond that you have to question the entire point of including the scene, if you don't include the follow up where Jaime wants to publicly declare his love, and Cersei is so terrified of that prospect that it basically ends their relationship. Not including the follow up post-sex conversation removes the point of the scene in furthering the story lineÂ as it existed in the books. A scene that further clarifies that Cersei wanted the sex, but under no circumstances does she want anyone else to know about the sex, and spotlights that Cersei realizes that Jaime has changed.
3515	DaveyJoe	2014-04-23	I'm not saying that Cersei isn't reacting differently in the show, but I think Jaime's actions are pretty much the same.

Your emphasis on 'fighting him off' disturbs me, considering it is blatantly obvious that her physical actions are exactly the opposite.
It looks to me that Cersei is trying to convince herself that it is wrong (after all, they are fucking in front of their son's corpse!)Â while Jaime is not going to be stopped regardless- like in the books.
Â 
Whatever happened to actions speak louder than words?Â
3517	BlueDragon	2014-04-23	I have just read that the director Alex Graves did not read the scene in the book. Â How incompetent is that? Â How lazy is that?
Â 
http://www.vulture.c...-sex-scene.html
Â 
To this point, I trusted D&D to do a decent job of finishing this story. Â No more.
Â 
I have fundamental critiques of the books and the series from a cultural studies perspective, but even George is obviously not pleased.
Â 
I do not see how Jaime's character development can be taken seriously after this, but much, much worse is the way that this has demonstrated that D&D do not know what they are doing when it comes to gender and rape.
Â 
I wonder if they have daughters. Â
3518	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-23	Â 
In the show? Arya isn't power hungry, and Dany is more complex than that.
Â 
Cersei has been stripped of all agency and is very passive in the show. In the books she's restlessly chasing power, she's very manipulative and a very dynamic and tragic character. I hate that they're turning her into just a victim. One of the most interesting sides of her in the books is that she is indeed a victim, but she's also an abuser. They're doing the character such a disservice.


Â 
Daenerys has reasons for why she craves power, all people do.
Â 
And Arya is power hungry. Power comes in different forms. It's not always about being a ruler for of people. Arya enjoys killing and enjoys the power that comes from it.
3519	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-23	Interesting how the people saying it wasn't rape never address the FACT that after Cersie pulled him in to kiss, she changed her mind and was pushing him back the whole time.
Â 
Notice how she didn't let Jaime kiss her even once while they were on the floor? Because she was pushing his face away.
3520	William Campbell	2014-04-23	http://www.vulture.c...-sex-scene.html
Â 
You say it â<U+0080><U+009C>becomes consensual by the end.â<U+0080><U+009D> I rewatched the scene this morning, and it ends with Cersei saying, â<U+0080><U+009C>Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not right, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not right,â<U+0080><U+009D> and Jaime on top of her saying, â<U+0080><U+009C>I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care.â<U+0080><U+009D> It leaves some room for debate. Were you involved with cutting the scene? Was there a longer version of the scene that might have read more like they were both consenting?
Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s my cut of the scene. The consensual part of it was that she wraps her legs around him, and sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s holding on to the table, clearly not to escape but to get some grounding in whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going on. And also, the other thing that I think is clear before they hit the ground is she starts to make out with him. The big things to us that were so important, and that hopefully were not missed, is that before he rips her undergarment, sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s way into kissing him back. Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kissing him aplenty.
Â 

Â 
This is 100% confirmation for me that no crime was commited against Cersei in that scene.Â  As I said before, the motiff of her hand holding on the table cloth is her giving into pleasure.Â  It's the last shot of the scene.

3523	Wong Chia Chi	2014-04-23	I read the scene as rape TBH. Although I understand how people say she could have resisted if she wanted to bc, he only has one hand. What made the scene in the show read as rape for me was how they changed the dialogue. "It's not right?!" ....WTF?
Â 
Everyone has debated the differences and similarities between the two and that was the starkest one to me. Yes it's from Jaimes PoV but if it was rape, Cersei would have remembered it that way. To me it was clearly her wanting it, just being justifiably worried about doing it at that place and time. Reasons for bad time and place:
1) It's a church, they could be seen.
2) Her son is lying there dead
3)SHES ALSO ON HER PERIOD!
Â 
She doesn't say "no" she just says, " Not here, the septons."Â Cersei is definitely DTF Jaime in the books. In her POV she says that the only good cock she's ever had in her life was her brother's. But they've also not seen each other so she relents and then they do it.
Â 
In the show..all through season three she is pining for Jaime to the point that she refuses to marry someone else, even for the sake of keeping up appearances. Then when he's back in season four she's just like..."Eh...you took too long. Bugger off." I get that they're playing the break up of these two differently. For one thing she says to Brienne at the wedding, that that Brienne is in love with Jaime. So the show writers are clearly doing the "Jaime is growing apart from Cersei" thing, earlier. As evidenced when Jaime goes to Joffrey as he's dying and Cersei tells him to "Get away!" from his own, nephew/son.Â 
Â 
I get what the show runners are TRYING to do, but I think they just handled it horribly. For some reason, they really like depicting rape when it isn't necessary. And they also seem hesitant to show the relationship between Jaime and Cersei as loving, because its incestuous. And incest grosses people out. Their relationship need not be depicted as dysfunctional, in a way that it isn't, simply because we want to punish Cersei and rob her of her agency, and because modern viewers find incest disgusting. They even had Cersei add dialogue about Joffrey being a punishment for "their sins" meaning her an Jaime. When BOTH her and Jaime are perfectly okay with it, in the books, they just hate having to hide it. Jaime more so than Cersei. Thats what finally drives them apart, Jaime being tired of hiding theirÂ relationship for the sake of Cersei's desire for power through her children. And Cersei never allowing him to get involved in his childrens life the way he wants to, and her having to control everything in that relationship.
Â 
The thing that grossed me out about the relationship was the obvious narcissism it clearly embodied. Fucking a mirror image of yourself doesn't get more narcissistic than that. When Jaime changes from resembling her even slightly, Cersei's turned off. Anyone who's ever known a narcissistic person understands their irrational need to control everything you do gets tiring. I've know people like that, and they get so tiring it annoyed me just reading it. But then, as soon as she needs someone to be her puppet, she calls him back, expecting him to comeÂ running. Cersei only sees other people as objects she can project herself onto, and do her bidding. When they deny her narcissistic supply by acting "human" and not doing what she wants, she immediately punishes them, or banishes them. Which is essentially what she did with Jaime, her twin.
Â 
This whole fiasco makes me wary of how the show runners are going to depict the Sansa and Littlefinger scenes. Like instead of being slightly leering and a little pervy, while clearly understanding his limits. Littlefinger is going to try to full on fingerbang Sansa or....something equally worse IDK. I am not looking forward to watching that.Â

Daenerys has reasons for why she craves power, all people do.
Â 
And Arya is power hungry. Power comes in different forms. It's not always about being a ruler for of people. Arya enjoys killing and enjoys the power that comes from it.


Â 
Â It is not true true to say all people crave Â power. No one wants to be victimized, but that is a very different thing from craving Â power. Arya Â has been driven Â nearly insane by what she has witnessed. I think it is far too soon to decide how her personality will react with her assassin's training. She is a child Â suffering PTSD. She wants revenge, but that is a very different thing from enjoying killing. The Hound Â states flat out that he enjoys killing and that he believes others enjoy killing. Are we to take his statements as wisdom? That would be an extremely odd and sadistic philosophy.

Â 
Um well obviously not all women bc opinions vary but... speaking as a woman....yeah. At least sexual intercourse. Â I mean think about it... she's probably wearing something expensive and they don't have any towels. So....messy! Â But in my experience, guys usually don't care as much about those kind of things, because they are thinking with the little head, but even if you are really turned on as a female you worry about that kind of stuff. Not that Cersei is a typical female and he still did it so I just thought that was mentioned by the author to explain her initial reluctance and the urgency of Jaime's desire.
Â 
Â 
"Many men and women particularly enjoy sex during this time. Â It helps women with cramps, etc. Â Some men find it sexy."
Â 
Right I get that. It's just that combined with everything else about the situation, including practical reasons might explain her reluctance to have messy period sex next to her dead son in a church. Maybe she's okay with period sex any other time but....right then and there not so much. The mess is a factor that struck out to me, bc I mean its not like she can hope in the shower and clean herself off. She has to walk back from the sept, and ask her maids to run a bath for her, they have to take the water heat it, bring it to the bath and then she can clean herself up, and hopefully not damage a very expensive gown...I'm not surprised she was reluctant to do all that on the day of her sons funeral is all I'm saying.

Â 
Well, okay, but that is the novel anyway. Â No indication of that in the tv show.
Â 
I am speaking as a female. Â I just don't think it is relevant to what is really going on here, either in the book or the show.
Â 
It would be interesting to know whether such practices were discouraged in Medieval times. Â Sexual intercourse during menses was prohibited by some cultures and Western culture seems to have considered it dirtier than average dirty sex.
Â 
For the record, the scene is a disaster for the series and Jaime's character arc. Â I have been mildly persuaded by some postings here that this is not as bad as many would suggest as Jaime is never going to be redeemed, people are fantasizing he is going to be, I don't know, admirable? by series end. Â 
Â 
I still think the scene as filmed is a disaster for the show in many different ways. Â But it is stimulating some necessary international discussion about rape. Â As usual, I am saddened by how unenlightened many people are. Â I posted above that D&D might want to think about their daughters if they want to create powerful cultural narratives which help men justify rape.Â 
Â 
I agree with the poster who pointed out that Jaime and Cersei have a profoundly sick relationship which damages both of them and drives them further and further to the dark side. Â Twincest is definitely a different psychological dynamic from other forms of incest and in a world where incest was allowed in royal families, this must have been very complicated for them. Â One wishes we knew more about how royal incest played out psychologically in ancient Egypt.
Â 
One wonders if Cersei was ever in love with Jaimie or whether she was always using him in a complex power struggle. Â In this scene, he upends that power struggle and places her firmly back into female victim status.
Â 
Saving Brienne makes all this even more complicated although I can say from experience that people can create Gordian knots of contradictions with their behavior, especially around issues of sexuality and power.

The more I think about it, the more I feel that way about GRRM's description of the book scene. Â At least D&D call it rape.


Â 
I think the way Cersei never once thinks that Jaime has raped her (in the books) tells me that she knows exactly what kind of consent she gave.
Â 
And I find it shaky to claim that "Jaime would never have stopped even if Cersei was resisting in the books". No one can really say that - the way book!Cersei and show!Cersei were acting and why they were objecting is completely different.
Â 
The main reason why book!Jaime continued to seduce book!Cersei is because, like others said, book!Cersei was only complaining about the location and worrying about getting caught - which Jaime doesn't care about given the fact that he was planning to propose to her & reveal their relationship immediately after. Martin has confirmed that Cersei wants Jaime as much as he wants her. Jaime knows Cersei wants him - therefore he continues despite her protests.
Â 
However show!Cersei was clearly objecting to the fact that Jaime was sexually touching her - she didn't want to have sex with him. Not there. Not anywhere, after he had lost his hand. She's objecting to the act in general. And here, Jaime ignores her pleas. She's sobbing. She's pushing him away. He ignores her. That's rape. And I can see why that's out of character for Jaime.
Â 
I don't think that's what book!Jaime would do. You can say that "but Jaime wasn't going to stop in the books" but from my reading of Jaime's character, if book!Jaime knew that book!Cersei at that time did desire HIM as a person, then Jaime wouldn't continue with the intercourse.
You could argue that the reason why Cersei was reluctant to sex doesn't matter - but in this case it does matter to how Jaime would have reacted.

3532	BasTyra	2014-04-24	Regarding the wrapping of the legs, I rewatched the scene and to be honest her legs weren't exactly wrapped right around him. You could even argue she had her knees up to try and kick him off. There was one shot of her right leg bent at the knee, boot on the floor, then the next scene had her left leg bent with her boot resting on him.
If they wanted her legs wrapped around him, like many things in the scene, they could have done it a lot better. God knows I've seen better legs-wrapped-around scenes in plenty of movies. It makes me doubt their sincerity when it comes to the comments about it becoming "consensual by the end".Â 
http://i.imgur.com/IbKgww4.jpg Â  <--- also look at her face. Sure her leg is up, you could argue it's wrapped around him in lust or whatever you wanna argue but her face says the exact opposite to me. Sorry my screencaps are bad 
Â 
http://i.imgur.com/VxPudjy.jpg Â <--- that's her shoving his face away, telling him it's not right as he replies that he doesn't care. She doesn't look very horny or into it at all and that's right at the end so I call bullshit on the director's comments about it becoming consensual.Â 
Â 
He's either a shitty director OR he is a great director who is lying and the scene was made specifically to be rape OR he has no clue about what constitutes consensual sex.
Â 
After reading these threads the last option wouldn't actually surprise me. ;P
3533	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-24	I wouldn't be suprised if whoever put the finishing product out there has "rape fantasies". A lot of people do.

Either way, her legs are not wrapped around him.

I saw the cersei/Jaime scene not as rape. A bit weird, yes, but in the same way as the book.

Having worked in both of these industries....yeah, a few.Â  But it's more that they know that's what a chunk of their audience wants, so they put that stuff in deliberately. It's the same way that directors of Rom Coms put in ridiculous "romance" tropes because it's what the audience expects.Â 
Â 
This is why a part of me wonders if Graves did it deliberately, knowing it would stir up commentary and thus interest and free publicity.Â

3539	Alc0r	2014-04-24	You're all overanalysing this scene, their relationship has always been screwed up and Jaime has always been a dominant male person who likes to play it rough. Yeah I guess this scene could have been made more like in the book and look less like rape, but whatever it doesn't change a thing. Cersei will wake up the next day and won't give a shit about what happened, she will be satisfied if this will make Jaime kill Joffrey for her. Sex is 90% about control and power for her now, and 10% about personal comfort or whatever. Time to move on and leave our modern melodramatic and moral views on romantic consensual sex behind us.

Perfect.
3542	MotherMouse	2014-04-24	I was also totally baffled by the outcry over this scene.  By definition the book scene and the show scene are both rape.  I can understand how someone who hasn't read the books could watch the scene and see it the aggressive, one-dimensional way it's being described here, but for me at least, I was watching it through my book-filter, comparing it to what happened in the novel.
Show!Cersei says "It's not right, it's not right," which is parallel to her protests in the book about being caught: she's protesting the circumstances (because having sex in a place of worship next to your dead son is NOT right, hello).  
She is sobbing because she's an absolute emotional wreck (*and Jaime is probably the only person she's willing to occasionally show that level of vulnerability*): her son is dead, Jaime just returned minus a hand, she angry with him, but still in love with him, she's furious with her father, she's uncertain about the future, she's grieving...  I don't think it automatically points to her being scared or upset solely about the sex.
I also think that, because these are fictional characters and we DO get to see inside their heads we have the ability to speculate a bit and MY opinion is that Cersei is not and never has been scared or intimidated by Jaime.  If she had truly been 100% opposed to his sexual advances and really wanted him to stop I think that we have evidence enough of her character and their relationship to suggest that she would have MADE him stop.  She would have screamed, she would have hurt him (the man only has one hand for heaven's sake), she would have had some sort of venomous words to throw in his face to cause him to lose interest.  Moreso I think that she felt she *should* protest, so she did.  The sex was by definition nonconsensual, but like book!Cersei I don't think that show!Cersei would assert that she felt violated after the encounter.  I think that this is part and parcel of their twisted and mutually-abusive relationship.  It's wrong but it's not out of character IMO.
I don't think that the intention is ever for Jaime to be fully "redeemed" and I would be pretty disappointed if the show started trying to make black and white characters instead of the delightful mix of gray we get in the books. (Okay, who am I kidding, they already started doing that.  Not happy about it.)
They could have *easily* "softened" the scene to a more ambiguous level and I think it was a stupid decision not to and definitely shows that the producers have the same wrong ideas about consensual sex that most of our culture shares... But held against their storyline in the book I just don't see how it was worth all the fuss beyond "they could have done a better job with that scene".

"I can do what I want" sounds an aweful lot like what a rapist would say. Rape is all about power. Can you explain why you feel the need to defend Jaime's action like this. You basically say that it's not rape because it's breakup rape.
3545	MsLibby	2014-04-24	I said this in another form. I'm ready to forget about it and move on, but it really bothers me that people will think badly about him for something I really believe book Jaime woudl never do.
3546	Tadco26	2014-04-24	Based on the director's comments it sounds like he does see it as consensual, which probably will result in !show Cersei having no negative fall out from the event, which has the potential to really make their future interactions hard to understand for non-readers who almost universally saw the scene as rape.Â  I suspect they will wonder how rape leads to scenes as if the rape never happened.Â Â 
Â 
PerhapsÂ the post sex discussion about Jaime wanting to take their relationship public and Cersei being terrified of that prospect will happen next episode, but without it the entire point of the scene is lost as far as furthering the book's story line for their relationship.Â  I'm kind of thinking they won't discuss it at all though, which seems like it would be pretty confusing for non-readers who didn't go research what the director's intentions were.

I rewatched the episode and I paid close attention to that particular scene this time around to see if it becomes consensual in the end. It didn't. Like you said...the final thing that happened is Jaime said "I don't care" and that was it.

More seriously though, and in response to some of the newer posts here: I've made my thoughts clear in this thread, which is that I don't find the show's version to be quite a large deviation from the books, or any sort of alleged "character assassination." I maintain that both scenes are ones of sexual violence and assault. Because this conversation seems to be fairly cyclical in nature, I'll just leave these here, for anyone's who's interested in my complete thoughts on the matter (or doesn't mind reading over 3000 words about it):

Â 
I think it could lead to some issues among non-readers, but I think even failing to address it entirely in the next episode would offer some clarification (especially if we get a lot of Cersei being not traumatized). I'm becoming increasingly of the opinion that they shot/edited that scene in the most shocking/controversial/attention-getting way, but stayed true enough to the books that they can still demonstrate that it's just another totally fucked up aspect of Jaime and Cersei's relationship. The more I think about it, the more curious I get about what they'll show in the next couple eps.

Thats just what I think will happen, unfortunately.
3557	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-24	Ok, a few days later, and rereading the book scene, my thoughts changed quite a bit.Â 
Â 
To me, that scene in the book is an assault too. It's not that Cersei suddenly "gets into it," it's Jaime throwing himself at her despite her protests.

You nailed it!
Â 
I rewatched the episode and I paid close attention to that particular scene this time around to see if it becomes consensual in the end. It didn't. Like you said...the final thing that happened is Jaime said "I don't care" and that was it.
Â 
It was clearly rape. The producers/directors are delusional.


Â 
I'm not a huge fan of book-Jaime; but the one crime I never thought the character would stoop to was rape, especially of someone he had loved for so long. Â This is a huge deviation from the books. Â And yes,delusion on the directors' part if they don't realize they filmed a rape rather than consensual sex. Â Oh well, they've already made Jaime a kinslayer, now he's a rapist. Â I'll still watch the show; it's entertaining fanfiction, but most of the characters are not the same as the those in the books.

3560	Cas Stark	2014-04-24	Â 
Based on the director's comments it sounds like he does see it as consensual, which probably will result in !show Cersei having no negative fall out from the event, which has the potential to really make their future interactions hard to understand for non-readers who almost universally saw the scene as rape.Â  I suspect they will wonder how rape leads to scenes as if the rape never happened.Â Â 
Â 
PerhapsÂ the post sex discussion about Jaime wanting to take their relationship public and Cersei being terrified of that prospect will happen next episode, but without it the entire point of the scene is lost as far as furthering the book's story line for their relationship.Â  I'm kind of thinking they won't discuss it at all though, which seems like it would be pretty confusing for non-readers who didn't go research what the director's intentions were.
Â 
Â 


Â 
This is exactly how it will play out. Â It's clear when the director and cast members think they shot a scene that wasn't a rape...then, that no "rape" is going to be addressed in any future episodes. Â 
Â 
So, it will be some serious weirdness for the TV audience, who will be wondering about the after effects, only to find there won't be any. Â LOL. Â It was a serious mistake by the show, I don't see how that can be denied and is going to cause criticism down the line.

Â 
Agreed, and especially since the show-runners describe the scene as Jaime "forcing himself on her." Graves should have been more careful with his words, but stuck to the fact that both depict sexual assault. At most he could have commented on the TV's version tone may have differed and what that does for the plot and Jaime's character arc. He tried to do just that later in interviews, but "it became consensual" was impossible to overlook by then.
Â 
The fact is, the television medium has a way of flattening morality. The two scenes aren't that different; we simply aren't in the attacker's mind as we're watching it, so even though it's more disturbing to watch, I think it paints a far clearer picture of the troubling and destructive dynamic between these two.

Â 
Â 


The scene can be seen that he wouldn't have stopped only if you just read this particular scene without the context of the books at all. You may think that he wouldn't have stopped but there is absolutely nothing in the book that can prove it. On the other hand we have Jaime being one of the most anti-rape characters in the book and also him being an absolutely fierce protector of Cersei who would go out of his way to please and protect her. You may say that he can be a hypocrite, but then we should see it constantly through his POV chapters. And he has a lot of POV chapters. And hypocrisy is definitely not something Jaime's chapters are famous for.
Â 
Not to mention that it was physically impossible for Jaime to rape Cersei. And even to just have sex with her without her help. He had difficulties to take a piss, not to mention rape someone. That's why she guided him into her, he would not be able to do it himself ( and I wonder how he managed to do it in the show as well).
Â 
In the end, Jaime is not a real person but a character from George R.R. Martin's head. And he is the one who makes the rules and shapes the characters' personalities and their actions. GRRM has already told that the scene in the book was not rape. He has established Jaime's personality and his stance about rape and if he wanted to show that Jaime is a hypocrite and is capable of rape himself, he would have hinted at it and explored it. Instead, Martin has made it Jaime's last sex with Cersei, with Jaime refusing her advances later a couple of times, his last sex to date at all, and also made him beheading rapists in his own army. If Cersei started to seriously resist Jaime in the sept, Jaime would have stopped because that would have been in character with what Martin has written and established. GRRM would just not have made Jaime continue.

Â 
It doesn't matter whether it was rape or not, there won't be any after effects either way. I just don't see this as being such a big deal for Cersei, she's already too jaded for that and sex is just a means to an end for her anyway. She just felt that the place wasn't right next to their son's body, but I doubt just that fact is enough for her to give this little event any more attention in the future. It's just another part of their screwed up relationship. Just because the sex is forced doesn't mean that the 'victim' is automatically traumatized by it.
3569	Chebyshov	2014-04-24	<snip>

Â 
Rape is forced or coerced sex. To paraphrase another poster from the locked thread, "it seems to me a dangerous place that when I say â<U+0080><U+009C>noâ<U+0080><U+009D> and a man still undresses me, puts his hand between my legs, even if I continue punching him in the chest as a sign of rejection, and he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t once â<U+0080><U+009C>hear itâ<U+0080><U+009D> or even consider it as him starting to rape me, because he thinks I would eventually agree." It's sexual assault.
Â 
Secondly, no. GRRM does NOT get to tell us what consensual sex looks like. He gets to tell us if the characters he's created view it as consensual sex; he gets to tell us how such an occurrence would be dealt with in Westeros; but he is not the arbiter on what is and isn't rape.
Â 
Fortunately, this isn't what GRRM was saying! He did say that Cersei was more on-board, but that's his critique on the nature of their relationship, not his critique on how our society should view rape. Look at the show! Graves said it "turns consensual," when it's clearly a depiction of sexual assault. That's why everyone was so upset; you can't show us a scene ending with Cersei's objections and sobs as Jaime thrusts and declares "I don't care," and then tell us it was consensual...it wasn't.
Â 
To paraphrase myself from earlier:
Â 

I'm not trying to bastardize Martin's work or force my views onto his characters; I am trying to explain the way in which the dynamic between Book!Jaime and Book!Cersei is not drastically different from the show's portrayal, given that both showcase a troubled relationship punctuated by acts of violence and assault.
I agree that Book!Cersei views the sept scene as consensual. I'm actually not sure how Show!Cersei will view what transpired, and frankly we're unlikely to ever get clarity on this, as we don't have the benefits of her thoughts through the medium of TV. For me, Jaime's actions are in line with his characterization in both cases. I do not, however, find either scene to be one without issues of consent. Even within Westerosi standards, I maintain that there would be women in this world who would view the encounter as forced sex. I'm sorry if this paints Jaime in a darker shade of grey than you're comfortable with, but I'm saying it is fallacious to cry "character assassination" for Show!Jaime when both the book and show scenes are in line with his actions and the nature of his relationship with Cersei.

Â 
To paraphrase myself from earlier:
Â 


Surely, GRRM is not someone who tells us what is and what is not rape. I do believe thought though that if both participants of the intercourse don't even think about rape, the rape did not happen. Because rape by definition has to be punishable. The word itself means a type of a crime and for it a person has to go to jail. But if there was a forced sex in a way that to punish someone for it is ridiculous, it should not be considered rape. Going back to the White Tower incident, Cersei forced herself on Jaime and started to sexually assault him while he was saying 'no'. Going by your logic, that fact that they didn't even have intercourse does not even matter. Because if Jaime would have agreed in the end to have sex, he then would have been raped. Therefore, what Cersei was doing is punishable. And that's ridiculous. Same thing about the example I had given in this thread before - when a husband is watching a football game and his wife starts to force herself on him. His says 'no, I want want to finish the game' but his wife doesn't stop.Â The husband then says 'screw the game' and has sex with her. By your logic, the husband has just been raped. And if this was rape, the wife has to go to prison. And that'sÂ ridiculous.Â 
Â 
'No means no' is a good rule to prevent actual rape but every case has to judged separately with considering every aspect of it. If you go word by word of it, you may just send every couple to prison.
Â 
In the show I agree it was rape. I am not talking about the show, I am talking about the books entirely.
3573	Alc0r	2014-04-24	Unlike many here I don't find it that hard to rhyme Jaime's anti-rape stance where Brienne is concerned with his behavior towards Cersei in this episode. I can see how in Jaime's mind he wasn't actually trying to hurt Cersei, he just wanted her so badly and didn't want to be ignored by her any longer. Had Cersei resisted a little bit harder I don't think he would have continued, although this is just speculation on my part. But that would be in line with his character imo. In the case of Brienne she would be brutally raped by a bunch of strangers and I think the level of violation is a whole lot higher here. Brienne would definitely not have come out of that situation unscarred.
3574	Dofs	2014-04-24	About Cersei's resisting, Jaime says she was feebly punching his chest. Yeah, it can be said that it was Jaime's biased POV and so on. But really, he was missing his right hand, with his left he could hardly do anything, even taking a piss was a big problem for him. If Cersei was actually seriously resisting, would it really be hard for her to get free from him? He lifted herÂ on the altar. How he would have done it with just his left hand, if Cersei was seriously resisting?

Â 
Â 
What about the fact that in the book they go straight away into a conversation about him wanting to go public and her telling him no...an entirely normal conversation between two people in a secret relationship...no sense that Cersei has been forced into anything. Â So, I still find it surprising and shocking that anyone can read the WHOLE passage in the book and come away with the idea that she didn't consent.
Â 
The show, while they may think that some barely perceptible movements she makes equals consent, but people watching can't and didn't pick them up, in fact, it actually looked worse to me on the rewatch because they end the segment with her crying and looking like she's trying to get away from him still. Â Again, Very different from the book.

Â 
In the book Jaime clearly forces himself on Cersei as well, but the difference is that Cersei at some point just let's go and gets into it. So you could say she didn't consent at first, and for some that's enough to call it rape. Either way it's still a violation and aggressive move on Jaime's part even though she retracts her objection later and just decides to go with it. I don't see why they couldn't have a normal conversation after this, no matter whether she technically gave consent or not. Even in the show I could see them having a perfectly normal conversation afterwards, maybe she gets into it there later on as well.

3577	The Prophet of Patch	2014-04-24	This thread seems to be degenerating into an argument about semantics.Â I think most people are in agreement that what the show depicts (between the two of them) is worse than what the book depicts (between the two of them), and that even in the books, Jaime forces himself on Cersei. Whether you call it rape or not, Jaime's actions are very similar between the two mediums, but we never get Cersei's consent on the show, which makes it a much harsher scene.
Â 


Â 
Rape is forced or coerced sex.


Â 
This, however, is the definition of rape. Just so everybody is clear. Because it seems like not everybody is clear.
3578	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	You all realize that Jaime has at least four scenes next episode? And pretty much all of them will cast him in a sympathetic/redemptive light? This includes a scene with Cersei which will probably shed light on what happened between them. So its not so much RIP show Jaime as RIP you guys fucking complaining.

Â 
Having the line "Rapist, rapist, rapist, 9th son, rapist....." in a Night's Watch scene and Jaime raping in the same episode felt like it was supposed to be connected.
(There's also that Jaime/Jon conversation in S01E02).

Â 
http://asoiaf.wester...hat-way/page-49
Â 
And to quote Ran
Â 

Â 
So it seems to indicate an attempt at directing a give-and-take scene in which consent is being given, then withheld, then given -- it's a back and forth, basically. Which is pretty much how Jaime and Cersei do things in the novels -- I said there were two scenes where Cersei starts off protesting, but in fact there's three.

Â 
In my mind, that puts all this right on the shoulders of Graves.
3590	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^Thanks for the link. Surely Jaime and Cersei interactions next episode will clarify what happened. Even if they don't mention IT explicitly, their body language and the dynamic between them will be very telling.
Â 
My initial point before I went off a little was that next episode is not only Jaime-heavy, but redemption-heavy. Character development and self-improvement aren't a one way street. He improved on the road with Brienne, had a sort of relapse (which you could say in addict terms was his "bottom"), and now will move ahead with hisÂ more "knightly" behaviour. This will manifest itselfÂ in his helpingÂ of Brienne, Pod and Tyrion.

Ooh, if Alex Graves isn't invited back to GoT next year, an anonymous poster on a message board is going to be upset!Â  Clearly this should terrify all of us into shutting up about the issue.
Â 
Graves is by far not the best director the show has ever had; he's a passable workman at best. And even if he was a brilliant director, that doesn't mean he's not a scumbag. Case in point: Roman Polanski. (And probably Woody Allen too.)
Â 
"Defamation" is what you do when you lie about someone.Â  "Disapproval" is what's happening to Graves here. And I'm sure he can take it.

As for what we consider hot-button issues and what we don't, the show portrays many different horrible things and never with this kind of fiery, politicised response. I hope that child-murder and wartime slaughter concern people, but none seem to elicit the same fervor as the "r" word.


Â 
No one argues about whether those other things are wrong.Â  Any time that fiction touches on a present-day issue of debate, like the definition of rape (or racism or income inequality or what-have-you)Â  it stirs up energetic discussion, which is one of the principle purposes of fiction and the main thing that makes it valuable to society. Without this, fiction would be a dull thing without power.Â 
Â 
But oh, I forget, you're the kind of person who thinks that people who don't agree with him ought to just be quiet, because it's just too damn much effort for you to scroll past discussions you're not interested in.
3592	DaveyJoe	2014-04-24	Graves has all ready said he's taking a year off GoT because it keeps him away from his family. Â I've really enjoyed all four of his episodes and I'm looking forward to his remaining two episodes this year. Â There's no way he loses his job over some concentrated internet backlash. Â Don't forget that the Showrunners wrote that scene and I'm sure they watched the episode in its entirety before it aired. Â They're not going to serve up a director as a sacrificial lamb especially considering their comments on the scene in the Inside the Episode.

3594	DaveyJoe	2014-04-24	The proof is in the product and 3.4, 3.5, 4.2, and 4.3 are really good episodes. Â D&D liked Graves so much they gave him 4 episodes in one season after working with him for just a year. Â This "controversy" is just giving the show more publicity. Â I don't see the show being negatively affected by it. Â Just another case of purists who are prone to getting pissed off by the show acting indignant.Â
3595	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^And 410 will in all likelihood be the best episode of the entire show.
3596	Cloud	2014-04-24	Rape is forced or coerced sex. To paraphrase another poster from the locked thread, "it seems to me a dangerous place that when I say â<U+0080><U+009C>noâ<U+0080><U+009D> and a man still undresses me, puts his hand between my legs, even if I continue punching him in the chest as a sign of rejection, and he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t once â<U+0080><U+009C>hear itâ<U+0080><U+009D> or even consider it as him starting to rape me, because he thinks I would eventually agree." It's sexual assault.


Â 
I still feel that you are taking things out of context and ignoring what we know about their relationship. (I'm talking about the books here). Are you saying that Cersei will allow herself to be "forced" into sex by Jaime? Are you really saying she has no power to stop Jaime doing something she doesn't want? That's BS. If you think so, then we have interpreted their characters and their relationship completely differently.
Â 
Do you ever consider that it's a routine for Jaime/Cersei's relationship for them to have risky sex - that Cersei would say "no", and Jaime would continue seducing her, and Cersei would agree afterwards because that's how they've always been? That's the type of sex they've agreed on? The rules of consent differ from the norm when we deal with this particular relationship.
Â 
Have you considered that maybe - just maybe, Jaime doesn't stop undressing Cersei not because he thinks she'll agree, but because he knows she'll agree, because they've had this type of sex for 20+ years and this is just part of their power-play routine that Cersei enjoys.
3597	MsLibby	2014-04-24	This has gone way beyond just the internet. It's been in a lot of the newspapers, been on TV. Heck...wasn't it even discussed on the Today show?
Â 
Rape is a subject that is very personal to a lot of us. it's not something that a simple "redemption ark" can overcome.
3598	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^Murder and war are very personal to a lot of us too. The same goes for dismemberment and manyÂ of the other horrorsÂ thatÂ GoT depicts. Regardless though, the show is free to depict these thingsÂ and we should try to be less sensitive about them. Many of the false narratives about art "normalizing" certain things is censorship through the back door.

Â 
"A helluva lot"?Â  BS.Â  If you lose your job over Internet activity, it was already dangling by a thread to begin with and you just gave the higher-ups the excuse they needed to boot you. And I repeat: Graves' (arguable) quality as a director does not mean he's not a scumbag.Â  Scumbags do extremely well in Hollywood; I know, I worked there. It won't hurt his career at all.Â 
Â 
(And I know what I can do with everything having to do with you -- it's called the circular file.)
3600	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-24	Â 
Graves is by far not the best director the show has ever had; he's a passable workman at best.


Â 
It's hard to be objectively wrong when offering a subjective opinion, but you've managed to pull it off. Â
3601	7th-key	2014-04-24	My mind wandered to a passage from HST:s Hells Angels:
Â 
Â 
Why wasn't it problematic for Sansa being "almost raped" in the riot? Or Brienne?Â 
Â 
And on to a different, but to me equally disturbing trend, why isn't anyone upset by Ramsay hunting a girl with dogs? Is it OK because he had a female side-kick?


Â 
Because everyone agrees that those actions are wrong and Sansa's almost rapers and Ramsay are scumbags. Jaime's TV-rape of Cersei, depending on how it will be handled, could even go though various levels sympathy for the act (example: Cersei deserved it or wanted it on some levels) or for the person doing it (example:is just part of Jaime personal growth). And that's wrong.
Â 


It's Jaime and Cersei, brother and sister. They fucked next to a drunk Robert, probably in his own bed. They don't care for morals nor others' feelings. I'm sure it's not the first time they have done anything like it. To each their own, every couple knows how they work in bed. Or in their son's graves.


Â 
Why would they care about Robert's feelings? - He's the one who whored around.
Same for Joffrey's feelings: he is dead. The reason one should respect the dead is to respect the feelings of the living. The only person who mourned Joffrey was Cersey, and (at lest in the book) she didn't mind having sex there that much.
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â
3602	FalseKnight	2014-04-24	About Cersei's resisting, Jaime says she was feebly punching his chest. Yeah, it can be said that it was Jaime's biased POV and so on. But really, he was missing his right hand, with his left he could hardly do anything, even taking a piss was a big problem for him. If Cersei was actually seriously resisting, would it really be hard for her to get free from him? He lifted herÂ on the altar. How he would have done it with just his left hand, if Cersei was seriously resisting?
What would you require her to do to express her nonconsent?
3603	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-24	Â 
It's hard to be objectively wrong when offering a subjective opinion, but you've managed to pull it off. Â 


Â 
Okay, what do you base this on? Name several ways in which Graves is an above-par director, please.Â  Blocking? No. Actor direction? No. Cinematographic brilliance? No.Â 

What are you basing your "Alex Graves is Oh-so-great!" opinion on? In what aspect is his directing so much more stellar than that of other directors on the show?Â
3604	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	I just don't see how the book's James Bond style "no, no, yes" scene would be preferable to what aired. If anything that sort of scene sends a worse message. But still, this sort of poo-pooing andÂ fretting over what message art and entertainment sends is what pissed me off enough to comment on this thread in the first place. For the sake of not devolving into personal attacks or a useless back and forth with the above poster, I will take my leave.

I like Jamie in the books and on the show, but heroic characters don't thro small children from windows. His actions in this scene aren't far from the book scene.
3608	DaveyJoe	2014-04-24	My interpretation of the book, and Jaime, is much different. Â He's certainly no hero. Â Even GRRM will tell you he writes grey characters, but you all want to pretend that Jaime is a white character by the end of ASOS, and I just don't think that's the case.

I dunno, maybe break free from the guy who doesn't have a right hand and is awkward to do anything with his left? Not feebly hitting him on his chest while he is undressingÂ her with his left hand but actually trying to prevent that? If you actually reread the scene and pay a particular mind in what Jaime is actually doing, you can notice that nothing is holding Cersei on the altar. Jaime is busy with undressing her but he doesn't have a right hand to actually hold her. She could have easily got away from him if she cared enough about that.Â Not mentioning that he could not even lift her on that altar in the first place if she actually resisted. He is a cripple. Oh, and telling him that she doesn't want him or that he is hurting her could also helped. Instead she was just speaking about septons, father and so on. Yeah, Jaime didn't care about that. In the end, Cersei also didn't care about that much.Â

That is the biggest BS I've ever heard, and you are clearly missing the point of why so many people are angry.
Nobody is pretending he's a white character. Nobody thinks he's a hero. He's a criminal, he's a murderer (a child murderer in fact).
But he's definitely not a rapist - that much is established. It goes against what he stands for. And that's why people are angry - because even though at this point in time he will kill/murder for Cersei, he won't rape & hurt her like he did in the show.
Â 
ETA: Just because he's a grey character doesn't mean he can commit any crime under the sun and it will still be in character.

Again, great way to avoid the argument. The fact that Cersei in the books does not for a second consider herself violated/forced/raped indicates to me that she is well aware of what consent she gave, and how much effort she put in to escape.

3613	rmholt	2014-04-24	Been reading all the social media about the last episode, and I don't understand why THIS is the change that people are not okay with.Â  I watch the show only for those rare occasions where I can watch and enjoy a scene from the book.Â  Obviously, I am usually disappointed.Â  So after 2 years of D&D making a complete mess of things, why is THIS instance of them butchering the story such a big deal?Â  Just because it has to do with rape?Â  In the book, the scene becomes consensual.Â  So if this scene in the show is rape, why doesn't she scream out as loud as she can?Â  Why doesn't she punch and kick?Â  To me, this was just POOR representation of the book, and not the biggest change ever.Â  Furthermore, it goes all with most of the changes D&D make....to add shock value!Â  So why care so much now?
Â 
Why have Arya kill the Tickler when she can kill Poliver instead?
Â 
I could go on and on.Â  So I ask again....why is THIS scene, after allÂ of the ridiculous and meaningless changes they've made so far, why is thisÂ the one everyone is making such a big deal about?

It wasn't necessary
It doesn't fit with his TV or book character up to that point much less further on
It was over the top offensive to the audience and not in any way true to the book. 
At least the other atrocities even Ros and Theon treatments were in character and I would say necessary to fill in some things the book can imply but the show can't. 
BTW Arya killed the Tickler too.

Â 
I've argued multiple times that Jaime and Cersei have a push/pull relationship that involves Jaime acting sexually aggressive, this has precedence in the book and the show. Â Here's a good scene in the show that presents Jaime's aggressive nature with Cersei:
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=xCpZpWOFXrA
Â 
Within the context of Jaime and Cersei's highly dysfunctional relationship, neither may consider this rape because this is just the type of sexual behavior that is common between them. Â The bottom line is that Jaime's behavior is exactly the same in the book and the show, the only difference is that Cersei doesn't give verbal consent. Â And until we see Cersei's reaction to this scene we can't claim this is character assassination of Jaime. Â You can't say that Jaime couldn't rape Cersei in the book because she could have pushed him off of her due to his disfigurement, and use Cersei's later reflection on that scene as proof, because we haven't seen how this all plays out on the show yet.

Â 
Jaime is my favorite character, and I quite hate the episode for it has done to him, but I wouldn't call him heroic. In fact, at lest in the beginning, he is a bit of a coward. He is a skilled fighter, thus he has it easy in battles, and needs no courage. When faced with the threat of being discoveredÂ  he chooses the easy way out and throws Bran out the window. When loosing his hand he initially wants to give up - it's Brienne who kicks a bit of courage into him.
Â 
Similar to the the Stark lesson (only when you are afraid, you can show courage) Jamie is learning that only when the situation is difficult, you are really fighting.
Â 
I believed Jaime was learning to be heroic and in the possibility of his redemption; adding a rape does make a difference. Because, as HairGrowsBack has pointed out, rape is a different crime in nature respective to the defenestration.Â  The sept episode as described in the show is not a falling off the wagon, it's an aggravation and a new layer of depravation.

Â 
I agree the scene is rape, but it makes no sense that she wouldn't scream for help knowing there are guards right outside the door, and it makes no sense that she wouldn't claw and kick at weakened jamie. Â Overall just a horribly directed scene and horrible written scene.
3617	Dofs	2014-04-24	I am now thinking that D&D are just biased about what characters they do like and what they don't and how they read them. And they are not careful at all in not letting their bias get into their scripts. Many characters have many fans and haters at the same time and every reader understands the character differently and thinks that he is right about him and everyone else is wrong. Jaime himself is a very polarizing character with opinions about him being sometimes even completely opposite.Â 
Â 
Sure, whitewashing Tyrion and Cersei was probably done to attract more watchers and/or try to not disappoint the watchers with their favourite character (Tyrion comes to mind).
Â 
But, imo, the reason they handle characters like Jaime and Stannis the way they do is because they read them that way in the books and when adapting the books to the screen, wrote them scenes as how they see them.Â 
Â 
And that's a really dangerous way to write characters when adapting such popular novels like ASOIAF. Many people may think that it's completely in character for Jaime to kill his own cousin and rape his sister. I guess D&D think like that as well. But as many people if not more think that it is out of character for Jaime to do that and if earlier they got away with a very bold move of Alton, this move bit them in the ass. Hope they learn that and will not make Stannis burn his daughter because she does not believe in R'hllor with enough passion.
Â 
In the end, I don't care much about the changes because book Jaime is book Jaime and he is the real one, what he does in the show in no way affects Jaime's character in the book.Â

Â 
She wouldn't scream for help because if Jaime was found having even non-consensual sex with Cersei, it would lend credence to the rumors running around about the Baratheon royal children not being Robert's. That would get Cersei and the kids executed.
Â 
Her failure to claw and kick could easily be put down to shock at him treating her like this.Â  It's not the behavior you expect from someone you have a loving (even if twisted) consensual relationship with.Â
3619	IlAovatar	2014-04-24	I like how Cersei could have escaped from Jaime in the book if she wanted to, but in the show it's rape, plain and simple.


She made no real effort to escape in the show. Her hands were free most of the time, yet aside from a few feigned pushes, she uses them to hold Jaime while she kisses him, to fumble below his belt, and to clutch at a drape out of pleasure.
3620	7th-key	2014-04-24	Cases and my interpretation.
Â 
1. Book version, not rape:
Jamie gropes and kisses Cersei and wants sex.
Cersei refuses sex.
Jamie continues the groping and kissing.
Cersei consents to sex.
Jemie an Cersei move into the sex act and Jaime penetrates Cersei.
Cersei shows appreciation for the sex.
Â 
2. Show version, interpretation A (by director), coerced rape but, if you want to stretch it, they could be playing a game in which the viewer hasn't been let in:
Jamie gropes and kisses Cersei and wants sex.
Cersei refuses sex.
Jemie move into the sex act and penetrates Cersei.
Cersei accepts the sex.
Â 
3. Show version, interpretation B, rape:
Jamie gropes and kisses Cersei and wants sex.
Cersei refuses sex.
Jemie move into the sex act and penetrates Cersei.
Cersei still refuses the sex.

I think you underestimate the fear a woman is under in a moment like that. She's much smaller and weaker than he is, and she's no fighter. She doesn't see a wine handed weakling. She sees Jaime Lannister. Plus, she's been victimized before. Even if you deny that Robert raped her, you know he abused her in those moments. 
It's irrational fear but real nevertheless. I don't see why people think she was fine with it given that She spends the next two books brooding because she's not enough like Tywin. I don't buy that the lack of reflection about the incident in her chapters somehow shows that she was fine with it either. I'm not a woman, but I would probably try to block it.

If she screamed, Tommen could lose the crown, ans she and Jaime could be beheaded. For her whole life, Tywin preached about the honor of House Lannister. Plus, she loves Jaime. 
Combine all that with already being a rape victim, and she reasonably might not scream.

Jaime kisses Cersei
Cersei kisses him back then feigns revulsion at the sight of his hand in order to manipulate him into doing what she wants (killing Tyrion)
Jaime, realising this is a power play, tries to take control of the situation and initiates sex
Cersei consents by kissing him back passionately after he's made his intentions clear
The two fumble and grope at each other
Cersei has doubts because it's wrong for them to make love next to their dead son
Jaime continues to try and control the situation by expressing that he doesn't care
They end up on the floor
Cersei is still conflicted but ultimately succumbs to the moment as evidenced by her grabbing at a drape instead of struggling

3624	Bekah Evie Bel	2014-04-24	Apologies for a being a bit personal here lolÂ 
Â 
I can say that I have been in situations where I didn't really like the place we were in, but did want to have sex, the only reason I said things like, "no not here", is to assuage my own guilt for following through and doing something in a place I shouldn't be doing it. I wasn't coerced or forced or even convinced to do it, I was simply saying some words to make myself feel less guilty about what I already planned to do. Â Sometimes the word no, does not actually mean no. Â Sometimes saying no with her mouth but yes with her eyes/body does happen and is real and true and not an act of rape. And if someone were to have overheard me say, no not here, then walk in and see me having sex, I would be homicidal if they tried to say I was being raped because I said a half-hearted "no"...
Then there are times that I have said a simple normal no, and yet have been convinced to change my feelings on the matter. Â Not coerced or forced, but certainly persuaded. Â Do you say I have been raped because I am not allowed to change my mind? And I know there are times where what we've been doing, if seen from the outside, may look as rough and forced or even more rough and forced than that pretty minor looking scene from the show, but believe me, that is just the outside view and not representative of what I and my partner are feeling.
Â 
I can't say if that is how it works in the show, perhaps she was raped, perhaps not, only she can make that determination. Â And thats the point, only she can say if it was rape, only she can say if she changed her mind at any point, either giving consent or taking it away, only she can say. Â Given she is a fictional character, then only the writers, directors et al can say what is in her mind at that moment, only they can say if it was rape or not.
Â 
All these comments on, you don't know what rape looks like, blah blah blah. Â Well it can look different every time it happens, but consensual sex can also look different every time it happens, and guess what sometimes it looks like what a stereotypical rape may look like, but still be completely and fully consensual. Â You can say, it was definitely rape, or definitely not rape, but you don't know, because you aren't her and its not your mind or body, so its not your judgement to make until you know what she feels/thinks happened.
3625	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-24	If it happened in her bedroom, sure.
Â 
It happened near her son's corpse, I'm inclinced to believe she genuinely didn't want it there.
3626	Bekah Evie Bel	2014-04-24	Yeh a good assumption, but then, these are the Lannisters so who bloody knows lol. Â Either way its shudder worthy

Â 
I think you underestimate Cersei. And what you've said there is the prime example of completely ignoring what they've established in their relationship.
Why in seven hells would she fear her brother and lover, when she has been fearing for his life for 2+books? She may be feeling many things in that situation, but fear is definitely not one of them.
Cersei is no "fighter" - in the sense that she doesn't go to battle and wield a sword. But in another sense, she is definitely a fighter. We have seen previous examples of how she gets her opinion known to others. She's not the type to sit there idly and let others have their way with her without a fight (e.g. look how she tried to get out of her mess in ADWD with the septons).
You're right - she doesn't see a one handed weakling. She sees Jaime - the person who she knows will never hurt her. The person who she knows she can manipulate and to do what she wants, even dehand an innocent child if she asked him to. She knows full well she has almost complete control over him.
You're also right - she's been victimisedÂ  and raped before by Robert. Look how she dealt with that - by swearing red vengeance and plotting his death and demise. She's the type to remember slights and dishonours. And her way of solace during those times she was raped by Robert was to have sex with Jaime. Again, why the hell would she fear Jaime's advances? It makes no sense. You're ignoring too much of her character.
Â 
It's irrational fear but real nevertheless. I don't see why people think she was fine with it given that She spends the next two books brooding because she's not enough like Tywin. I don't buy that the lack of reflection about the incident in her chapters somehow shows that she was fine with it either. I'm not a woman, but I would probably try to block it.
Â 
I can see perfectly fine why people think she was fine with it because:
- they have a perfectly fine conversation afterwards, like nothing strange has happened between them.
- She spends the next book thinking back on how Robert abused her, and how much she hated him for it. And yet when she thinks of Jaime, it's always thoughts of affection (apart from the times when he refuses to be manipulated by her - which is hardly a result of him "raping" her). She thinks of how Jaime gave her what Robert couldn't, and how he stayed by her side during Joffrey's birth when Robert didn't give a fuck etc etc.
- She makes no attempt to block it, hell she even makes reference to it when she's seducing Jaime a while later in the White Tower.
Â 
And yes, you're not a woman. And yes, a normal woman would probably try to block out their trauma. But Cersei is no normal woman. I don't like it when people use the argument that "a normal person would want this == therefore Cersei would want this too". It's BS, because we have seen repeatedly Cersei does not react and treat situations like normal people would. Instead of "blocking out" her traumas, she thinks on them and lives on them. She never forgets them.
3628	Sarah the Terror	2014-04-24	Of course it matters. You can't willingly have sex with someone and then claim rape.
Â 
If anyone is the victim, it's Jaime for being manipulated so Cersei can get what she wants.
This reply is so triggering and so disgusting that I've literally decided to not come to this forum anymore. 
The fact that the scene that played out in the show has made someone find Jaime the victim is appalling. 
Since this will be my last post in this forum, let me tell everyone here why it's rape. It's rape because it made women uncomfortable. It's rape because people behind this show didn't think for a second whether or not fans would be offended by this.
I am so fucking glad it didn't offend a bunch of straight men. But I'm sorry, it was fucking rape. Everything Cersei (LH) did in that scene was saying no. Once again, I don't give a shit if she grabbed a table. No is fucking no. Not here means not fucking here. All that d&d had to do was add one fucking line "just do it already", anything really, for this to be consensual. But they didn't. And you better bet your ass they did it on purpose. They aren't fucking stupid. They meant to get a rise out of audiences. They used rape to get a buzz going.
And that's almost as disgusting as all the people here fucking defending it.
3629	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-25	It's not really about feminsm or whatever. The scene displayed rape.
Â 
I'm only mad because since they don't think it's rape, it won't ever be addressed in the show. Would be interesting to see how things played out if they treated it like rape.
3630	DorneToTheWall	2014-04-24	There was no decapitation and no sh!tting. There will be no locust eating. Gods save the queen. 
Yes this guy is a minor character but he has more of an impact on the series than the Styr the magnar of thenn. Do any of you think Strong Belwas can still make it to the screen? And if so, what changes would come to his backstory.
3631	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-20	Is it faegon even a bigger filler than we tought, to the point than a more mature Tommen along with The One True King and Daenerys could just overthrone his whole plot?

No, he doesn't have enough gold to hire them. And even if the Iron Bank give him the gold, there's no time to get them before Stannis goes to the wall
Â 
Actually, the fact that they started to name it, made me think Aegon is 99% confirmed to be next seasonÂ
3633	Lord Carson	2014-04-20	Stannis is going to the Wall. He cannot afford the Golden Company and will almost certainly be rejected by the Iron Bank. Their inclusion looks like a way to have them remembered when they do show up later.
3634	Dain Storm	2014-04-20	I get the feeling we'll be seeing Aegon next season.
3635	The Dragon Demands	2014-04-20	Actually I thought it was a good idea to introduce them early. Â I mean, they're the biggest and most professional sellsword company in Essos, it's not as if their basic existence isn't public knowledge. Â

by the way. i highly doubt they ll reject him to offer him money later. stannis would then just send them to go f themselves.
from the season trailer we seam he gets sirt of  westerosi looking troops...

3641	Kyrion	2014-04-20	I raged so hard at the thought of people saying Aegon will be cut, meaning the entire second Dance of the dragons will be cut, literally made no sense. Dany needs an enemy.
3642	Baltan	2014-04-20	Yeah, I took it as another drop name to become familiar. Probably to set up the plot of (f)Aegon and (as @JonCon Red Beard remarked) Jon Con.
Â 
Like with Volantis. Everyone and everything has something to do with Volantis in the show. Yes, we get it, it's a city that's gonna be important later.

So I wouldn't be surprised if from now on we get to hear some amazing tales of the GC in the show.

Actually, I'm pretty sure the Bank is going to have to give him something, since this episode established that Stannis essentially has no men.
3644	Dain Storm	2014-04-20	Dany needs an enemy.
According to Moqorro, her biggest enemy is supposed to be Euron Greyjoy. I'm more worried about Victarion and Euron getting cut. Revealing another Targaryen would be a fist pump moment for the show fanbase since they're arguably the most popular house among the unsullied.

3650	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-20	Yeah, I'm glad they did it, Stannis' reaction was priceless.Â  I hope they'll namedrop Euron and Vic during the Greyjoy episodes, and hopefully Oberyn will namedrop which daughters the show will include.
3651	HouseHarrison	2014-04-20	It was just a namedrop, no way will it switch to the Stannis plot.

3664	The Drunkard	2014-04-21	But he's not talking to Justin Massey.


Â 
Next you'll be telling me he isn't in the North.
Â 
He is talking about the prospect of travelling to Essos to buy sellswords, which is the closest equivalent to this conversation with Davos. It essentially covers the same points, with Davos and Justin both suggesting that Stannis leave Westeros for the time being, travel east, and try to gather the support of sellswords, something Book Stannis refuses because his place is with his men, and he has no intention to go down the same road as Viserys.Â 
Â 
It'd be easy to translate, and make more sense than this random objection to mercenaries, which he's already used.
3665	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	I think it's cool that they at least name dropped the Golden Company. We know they are major players in the future.
And no way Stannis can hire them. I doubt he'll even try.

(they may even leave out the bit where Cersei refuses to pay back the debts, and Nestoris goes straight to Stan). Obciously, the Golden company won't be available by that time, but at least now the show-only folk know there is a sellsword company by that name, so they won't appear out of the blue.

Stannis is definitely not getting the GC though. They're laying out the groundwork for us to understand the importance down the road. It's a good idea, and I hope it makes a lot of the Aegon plot feel less pulled out of thin air.

He's going to get a loan from the Iron Bank, promising that he will honor the Iron Throne's debts, just like in the book. They had Davos mention the Golden Company just to introduce them as sellswords for the future.
Â 
Stannis does eventually dispatch someone with his Iron-Bank loan to hire sellswords, but not the Golden Company. By that time, the Golden Company has already invaded Westeros.

3688	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-21	I agree with those saying the IB shouldn't be lending to Stannis until later on, post Twyin death. The question is, though, what army will he use to march on the wall? They made it pretty clear he didn't have many men at the moment. If they were to speed things up and have the IB loan to Stannis, it could be interesting to set up a dilemma between him marching on KL or the wall. Leave the viewers guessing and then make Stannis look like more of a hero when he chooses the wall. It also makes his "I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne" line make sense. Regardless I really hope they don't exclude yet another great Stannis quote from the show haha.Â
3689	titanx5	2014-04-21	Olenna discusses with Tywin during episode 2, about "the IB will have its due", and Tywin replies that he is not worried about the IB. So they could make it out that Tywin has already rejected to pay back the IB. But I really dont know how its going to work. Either they refuse to help Stannis, or they lend him their support, and promise to recruit sellswords companies for him in the future, but it will take time to get that many sellswords

I agree, no way in hell he is a filler. Also, if you look at the sample chapters from WOW you will see Doran sent Arianne to him. I think they might get married when Dorne gets the word that Quentyn failed. That will be their back-up plan.

Then why would you think he's just a filler? Honestly, just curious.Because a main character wont just pop out in Book 5. I really think they cant split whatever he is doing between a more mature Tommen and Daenerys...
I just cant see a season with 5 kings again. And thats what needs to happen in the next one. They need lot of time with each.   Besides Jon Snow, Sansa, Bran and Arya...thats 9 plots next season.

Â 
Being an important figure of the universe does not equal being a main character.
Â 
And I actually think it's great if a big player is added so late, when noone is expecting him, everyone's money is already on Stannis or Dany or someone and everyone is convinced they can predict how the story ends and then all of a sudden BAM! a new player pops out and makes us all lost, interested, unsure and excited. I actually thought it was a brilliant move.

3703	Dornish Hen	2014-04-21	I agree with those saying the IB shouldn't be lending to Stannis until later on, post Twyin death. The question is, though, what army will he use to march on the wall? They made it pretty clear he didn't have many men at the moment. If they were to speed things up and have the IB loan to Stannis, it could be interesting to set up a dilemma between him marching on KL or the wall. Leave the viewers guessing and then make Stannis look like more of a hero when he chooses the wall. It also makes his "I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne" line make sense. Regardless I really hope they don't exclude yet another great Stannis quote from the show haha.Â 


Â 
I'm wondering if Stannis will meet up with the Eastwatch-By-The-Sea men and then head to Castle Black. Â I too, don't believe that the IB will make contact with show Stannis until after Tycho meets in King's Landing. Â I can't think of any other way for Stannis to muster up enough men. Â Even so, I know it's not a lot. Â  (Has it been said on the show how many men there are at Eastwatch?) Â I felt as though there was too much emphasis on how understaffed Castle Black is and no mention of the other Wall posts.
Â 
I'm ready for show Stannis to turn into some semblance of book Stannis!

3704	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-21	i think it was just a shout out to the gc. there was also another to the second sons from the hound. stannis i think will get rejected by the bank and will have to wait a couple of seasons to get his money
3705	Dain Storm	2014-04-21	Â Honestly the only way I can see anyone think that is that the given person is a huge Dany worshipper afraid that Aegon might actuallu turn out to be the real deal. Denial, pure denial.

Actually, most people who dislike him are Jon fans. I don't think Aegon will win the throne, or be AA, but I do think that he's gonna be a pretty big deal in Dany's arc.
3706	Jasta11	2014-04-21	They probably just name drop them so that an extremely expensive army of 10 000 mercenaries doesn't appear out of thin air when Aegon gets them. Stannis getting the GC would completely undermine his underdog status, plus he wouldn't get to the Wall until season 6.
3707	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-04-21	This show had so much potential , I hope continuity flows back butÂ  I think with so manyÂ  POV's, character arcs, the show has reached beyond the format available to it. I thought this when thinking of the Iron Islanders and the possibility of seeing them, especially the Crows Eye what a special character that would be to portray. But to see him for 4 minutes every 2nd week would be an insult to all those thoughts and hopes of others.Â
3708	iheartseverus	2014-04-21	An interesting theory was going on earlier among the PTV Unsullied.Â  They noted that that Shireen and Davos discussed pirates and smugglers, then Davos decides to dictate a letter supposedly from Stannis to the Iron Bank.Â  Anyway, one of the Unsullied came up with the idea that the Bank will lend Stannis a barge full of gold (or whatever) and then Davos and Sallador will hijack it, and therefore Stannis will have his gold but won't have to repay it because it was 'stolen en route' and he never received it.Â  Pretty clever theory.

Â 
Yeah, I think it has to...aren't they trying for 7 seasons? That means most to all of AFFC/ADWD material needs to be covered next season
3715	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-22	My assumption was that Davos was going to go to the IB to start to stir up shit against the Lannisters. Â He stopped after the line about them changing kings to get their pay. He's going to get in their ear to either back Stannis or get them to start pushing the Lannisters. Which will lead to them looking for Stannis at the wall.
Â 
I think the GC was just a name drop as the story gradually starts to move away from King's Landing back to the east and to Dorne. Â The Westeros families are all in tatters at this point or will be soon and by the end of the season we will potentially be seeing Tyrion and Arya leaving. Â Really Stannis/Jon and Dany are going to be the big stories next year with everyone moving around or toward them. Â My guess is we will see sets up for Dorne and the Greyjoys soon as well.
Â 
As for where Stannis gets the men I'm not sure but this seems similar to the situation he finds himself in at the Wall trying to Rally the North. Maybe they just have Davos do some recruiting now.
3716	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-22	because they got mentioned Stannis is going to get them? What? The Gold Company breaks a contract in order to join Jon Corrington and Young Griff later on.
Â 
Qyburn tries to point out that the Gold Company has never broken a contract in their history. I doubt they will join Stannis, but they're not the only sellsword company on the planet luckily.
3717	titanx5	2014-04-22	I do think people are over reacting to Stannis getting the GC. As much as I would love Stannis to get the GC, that aint going to happen. Its just a reference from Davos that there are companies that do have a large amount of troops available for the right price. Plus we could get a hint from WOW of what sellsword company may be in Braavos or near Braavos, that Massey may get for Stannis.
3718	Janicia	2014-04-23	Does the story, particularly in the truncated form we're going to see on TV, really need Aegon? Â He's not going to end up on the iron throne - not for long at least. Â He's just going to build up enough momentum to feel like a threat and then somebody is going to kill him. Â 
Â 
It looks like the show is indicating that Stannis will hire a significant mercenary force this season and bring them to the Wall. Â In the books, presumably Stannis' plan is to gain control of the North and then attack Kings Landing again. Â From Kings Landing, Stannis attacking from the north with a mercenary army is not particularly different from Aegon attacking from the south. Â 
Â 
I dunno, if you had to choose between Aegon or Euron, wouldn't you go with Euron? Â
3719	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-23	Hard to say whether or not they'll "need" Aegon, since none of us know what part he will play in the last two books. Regardless, based on all of the little hints and name-drops we've had even just three episodes into this fourth season, I think it's a sure thing that we'll be seeing Aegon & Jon Con, an assortment of the Dornish characters, and Euron & Victarion (or maybe they'll be condensed into one character, though I doubt that).Â
3720	joachim	2014-04-23	I think that Dorne will make for good television, for many of the same reasons as Kings Landing. I think that the TV audience will miss Oberyn, so it's in the show's interest to have as many Martells as time will allow.

But Aegon & company aren't Dornish characters. Â Jon Connington is a lot like Jorah and Barristan. Â Aegon is a lot like Robb and Tommen. Â So far in the books, Aegon has been expendable and hasn't done anything interesting. Â The show doesn't have time for a lot of the secondary characters - I wouldn't mind if he didn't make the cut.

That's going to take a lot of screen time when we're looking at 10 hours to get through most of AFFC/ADWD. Even if the characters are introduced, I can't imagine how fleshed out their plots will be. We definitely can't speak to Aegon's role yet, but I'm not sure I see all of thee guys making it in.
3723	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-23	But Aegon & company aren't Dornish characters. Â Jon Connington is a lot like Jorah and Barristan. Â Aegon is a lot like Robb and Tommen. Â So far in the books, Aegon has been expendable and hasn't done anything interesting.He is only in one book and he has already done a lot, like finally returning to Westeros. Dany has been present for five books and she doesn't go because first she needs to solve her problems in SB. I think that's his main purpose, to prove that while she's interested on the IT, she first needs to solve other things. And to prove us that Varys has other intentions.
3724	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-23	I doubt GRRM would have added Aegon 5 books in just to spice things up.
Â 
He probably has an important role in the last two books so I think he'll make the show.

Honestly, you could say the same for Quentyn. I mean, why introduce him and then kill him off in no time, right? You can suggest that he was there to somehow create conflict between Dany and the Martells, but then again, you can argue that Aegon is there just to keep the plot moving in the South of Westeros before Dany arrives which probably won't be long at all.

Â 


Yea I definitely disagree. Without Aegon Varys' whole plan is eliminated. Also, like others have said, he's done quite a lot in 1 book. He's already taking over Storm's End and theres a decent chance he will sit the IT for a time. You are presuming a lot to say he won't have a major impact, when he's already had quite the impact in 1 book.Â
3727	D-Shiznit	2014-04-23	D&D won't bring Aegon to the show, he will steal too much of Dany's Thunder, something they will never allow.
3728	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-23	I hope we get a scene with Illyrio Mopatis sending off Aegon w/ JonCon, and as the two are walking away Illyrio softly whispers, "Farewell, my son."
Â 
A tear or two roll down his face, and than he bites a block of cheese.

Â 
Well, think of it this way: By the end of this current season, there are quite a few current story lines that will inevitably take up less screen-time.
Â 
King's Landing: Joffrey dead, Tywin dead, Shae dead, Oberyn dead, and Tyrion gone. Brienne will be leaving by the next episode, and Jaime will probably be gone early into the fifth season. Both Littlefinger and Varys will also be absent (largely, in Varys' case) from this location. That will leave Cersei, the remainder of the small council, and the Tyrell's.Â 
Â 
Now, since King's Landing is such a central location for the show, the 'battle' for the throne will then center on Cersei versus Margaery, but also the increasing influence and machinations of the Dornish. I'd expect the High Sparrow to be cast, and I can see Tyene (or an equivalent, if they decide to use a different name) interacting with him in a related sub-plot.Â 
Â 
So essentially, the writers will have quite a bit of 'extra' time to dedicate to the characters in Dorne simply by virtue of the decreased focus on characters and individual plot threads in King's Landing. From Dorne, I'm expecting to see Doran, Arianne, Quentyn (though in a highly reduced capacity; introduction, one or two traveling scenes, and one or two scenes in Meereen before he gets fried), and possibly Sarella (if they decide to include the Old Town sub-plot, though it's possible that this plot line - and the character - could be pushed back into season six).Â 
Â 
Castle Black: With the wildlings (who currently have a story line of their own going), Stannis (ditto), and all of the Night's Watch characters now in this location (at least for the first half or so of the season), that also allows the writers to 'free up' some screen-time for the introduction of Euron & Victarion. The two of them don't need an inordinate amount of time to establish their characters or their role in the story, and I'd expect the vast majority of Victarion's travels to be cut.Â 
Â 
Essos: With Tyrion heading for Pentos - and being the 'main' character of the show, by and large - it would make sense to have Varys present when he arrives, with Illyrio, Jon Connington, and Aegon. Tyrion and the latter two can travel together for a time (up to the point where Tyrion is enslaved and meets up with Jorah).Â

I'll taunt you all If he turns out to be the son of Eddard Stark & Ashara Dayne
3732	titanx5	2014-04-24	We really have gone off topic here, anyways think a lot of guys have been right on the money
Â 
Dorne: I'm really starting to believe that Quentyn may actually get cast (felt at first he would miss the cut) as feel that the unsullied will really feel for the guy going all that way to try get Dany to marry him, and also try to impress his father buy trying to get a dragon only to get BBQ-ed. Doran will probably only be in 2 episodes in the begining. And Arianne's plot maybe shown towards the end s5, of rumors that his nephew is alive. Don't know how they are going to include all of this and still have the Myrcella queen plot, just dont see it making the cutÂ 
Â 
KL: I feel even though the HS is going to have an increasing role in the book, I feel as if he isn't going to make the cut, and a lot of his role may go to Pycelle. I feel in Lancel Lannister may be the one that confesses that he slept with Cersei and takes the role as one of the Kettlebacks, except is forgiven by joining The Faith.Â 
Â 
Iron Islands: I think we will see Euron and Vic, but really don't know what is happening with Yara/Asha. I don't think we will see much of a KM, except the fear of Euron being on the Seastone Chair, and no one really wants him on Vic will probably be combined with Aeron and have a closer relationship with Asha. So probably will see Euron and Vic in the beginning, and Euron's plan. And see Vic at the end of the series near Meeren or already involved in the Battle of Slavers Bay.Â 
Â 
Aegon: We will see him in the beginning 4 or 5 episodes, and then in episode 10, with his army landing in sight of SE
Â 
The rest I think Khal-a-bunga summed it up pretty well

Quote

"Well, it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for them ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle. Nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters, so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal. And it was very much about the earlier part with Charles (Dance) and the gentle verbal kidnapping of Cersei's last living son. Nikolaj came in and we just went through one physical progression and digression of what they went through, but also how to do it with only one hand, because it was Nikolaj. By the time you do that and you walk through it, the actors feel comfortable going home to think about it. The only other thing I did was that ordinarily, you rehearse the night before, and I wanted to rehearse that scene four days before, so that we could think about everything. And it worked out really well. That's one of my favorite scenes I've ever done."

Â 
Agreed, loved that line. Won't be touching that shit-storm of a thread for the next few days though.
Â 
Arya's "You are the worst shit in in Westeros!"Â made me laugh. While their scenes may be a sort of "black comedy" at the moment, I'm sure their story will turn a very dark corner soon enough. Enjoying the great chemistry between Maisie and Rory while it lasts!

Well, it's not as if the gold cloaks have walkie talkies.  It would take some time to spread that message throughout a city as large as King's Landing, and Sansa and Dontos had a head start.
I do think the escape, as filmed, was pretty cheesy, but it's not as if all the gold cloaks in the city would instantly know of Tywin's orders like when you get spotted during a stealth section in a videogame.

In all fairness, Jaime was already a pretty horrible Kingsguard member.  I mean, he killed a former king, which is literally the ONE thing a Kingsguard member should never, ever do.  He's also 0-3 so far on kings he's protected, and I can't imagine Tommen will make it through book six, let alone the series.  
Not the best track record.
3795	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	Jaime sneering, "I don't care" as he jammed himself into Cersei's struggling body. Totally exactly what happened in the book, just substitute "yes" for "no," "do me now" for "it's not right," and her guiding him inside her for physical and verbal resistance!

Lol so true, Cersei is yelling about Sansa almost immediately after she yells for Tyrion to be arrested and Sansa can't be more than 50 ft away yet manages to escape.   Lannister guards must double as Storm Troopers.  
Then the Dario part was exactly like Indiana Jones and the sword guy.  Great job on that one.

2) I understand how things are...how many Starkes do they have to behead before you figure that out...
Â 
3) If you are a famous smuggler, you aren't doing it right...
Â 
4) your father lacks the appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior...
Â 
5) Everyone has a preference ~ then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure...
Â 
6) Everyone wakes up one day old...make sure you have fucked your fill before that day...

I had some complaint about Kit and Emelia's acting in the early seasons, I think they've both improved a lot. She nailed that speech.

3843	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-23	I liked the scene between Tywin and Tommen (it was more than just a line, surely). The way it was all a sharp rebuke to Cersei, who is standing right there having to hear and realize her next son will be instructed by someone other than her. OUCH.

Oh God, yes! Them escaping that way makes Jaime a horrible KG. No guards around the wedding, no special protection detail etc? A Stark fleeing with a strange man is that easy? Sansa could have got away long back.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Not to be a book-spoiling person, but in the books, the scene was one of total chaos - people crying, people shouting advice as they try to help the king, half the guests running screaming for the exits, musicians hastily trying to play a dirge, etc. In other words, much easier for Sansa to slip out during the panic.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


I suprised that no one else picked "You are a man who hides his cock in his asshole."

Â 
Now, is hinted that book Oberyn actually signed the Arianne-Viserys marriage pact and that before Quentyn started his faithful trip to Meereen nobody took tales of dragons as something serious, so having a capable hand of the king that is aware of Targaryen Dragons is not something on Oberyn's best interests.
Â 
Varys kept telling the small council that his little birds heard tales of dragons in slaver's bay, together with crakens sinking ships by the isle of nuncles and a conflict between the Snarks and Wabberjockies, so enough to claim that he informed the council but not framed to be taken seriously.
Â 
The issue here is that I don't remember any hint of book Tywin taking the dragon threat seriously. So what is show Tywin planning on doing with the impending dragon invasion? Dornish-style guerilla warfare?, that would hardly result in his golden grandson keeping his crown.
Â 
The scenario I'll like to discuss is what can Tywin realistically do to keep Dany away from Westeros?

3848	averde	2014-04-21	Book Tywin doesn't take it seriously. I think it's included on the show to make Dorne sound cool and introduce the whole Oberyn as a judge idea to the TV audience. 
If show Tywin did have a plan to beat the dragons I imagine it would be something like the red wedding or some other assassination plan to eliminate Daenerys, if she's dead the Targaryen cause is dead. It's the only realistic shot of winning. Guerrilla warfare wouldn't work because eventually, in a similar way to Roberts description of a Dothraki invasion, the common folk would just proclaim Danny queen.
3849	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-21	You can brush off dragon rumors, you can brush off those silly Greyjoys raiding, but a 100,000 wildlings? Why isn't Tywin sending aid to the Night's Watch?

Just a minor nitpick about this episode for me.

3850	RoamingRonin	2014-04-21	TV-Tywin takes the dragon threat seriously and will make preparations... which TV-Cersei will undo within a fortnight after he dies.
I think that's the point. To have Tywin make competent decisions now so that Cersei can undo them later.
3851	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-21	Didn't Joffrey suggested about the Dragons last season and Tywin shut him down?
3852	Kyrion	2014-04-21	I liked how the rumors of Dany's dragons are lost in translation in the books, seeing as most of the tales come from sailors and not spies, they put a little hyperbole in their stories. In the show, I guess they didnt want to deal with that.
3853	Envie	2014-04-21	It's possible that Tywin doesn't take the threat seriously but was just using the gossip about Dany as ammunition in his conversation with Oberyn.


Â 
Â 
I'm going to go with this guess too. They're setting television viewers up to 'believe' Tywin believes it. And honestly - does it matter whether he was lying to Oberyn or not? He won't be around to laugh about the lie or worry about the truth either way. It was a useful tool to get the audience riled up about Daenarys again - who has a killer ending scene this episode. Well played D&D - well played!
3854	metr0man	2014-04-21	I suspect the line might have tipped us off about Dorne resisting Dany (perhaps after finding out about Quentyn). Anyways I'm glad they are trying to keep the plots connected.
3855	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	I really hope the letter isn't played as "Hey Doran, Tywin tells me there is a girl with dragons in Essos. How is young Quentyn these days?"
Â 
It beggars belief that Dorne doesn't hear the rumours before KL. The letter would be much better if played as informing of the news - especially about the Small Council and overtures of alliance. And the Mountain being offered as bait.

100,000 unwashed savages streaming into the North a kingdom that doesn't concern him. Why send his own soldiers to defend the North?
3857	Duckface	2014-04-21	I really hope we all could go back in time and D&D would erase this scene
3858	Red Tiger	2014-04-21	I believe Tywin isn't sending help to the Wall cause he hopes the Wildlings and North end up killing eachother.

They could hardly take on 1500 knights without running around like chickens with their Mance's cut off. What do you think 20,000 knights and 80k infantry would do to that rag tag bunch? They would break on the first charge.Â

So just let the wildings destroy the North and hope they never come South, that's how you would handle things.
3864	direwoofwoof	2014-04-21	I recall in the books Tywin & KL repeatedly ignored ravens requesting lots more men for the wall and news of imminent death, doom, and destruction. They sent a thief or two, but definitely no serious support. They blew off the warnings of wildlings, walkers, and dragons.
3865	Maia	2014-04-21	Because there's no way this 100,000 unwashed savages will ever come south right. They'll stay in the cold savage North all winter long, lolWhy would they come south, when the North can easily sustain them through any winter that isn't the Long Night (and nobody in the south, except for possibly Marwyn believes that it is imminent)? And should the wildlings be victorious, come spring, they would be easier to re-conquer than the northmen proper. In fact, surviving northmen would be likely to ally with the south to get rid of the wildlings.Tywin thinking that Dorne would ever support the Lannisters against a Targaryen with an army and 3 dragons (even small ones) is just dumb and completely OTT, IMHO. But then, the show Tywin is much dimmer and more of a blowhard than the book one. I dare say that if book Tywin got believable info about Dany, he would have reacted very differently.Varys, when he sorta reported about the birth of the dragons, made it sound completely ludicrous and left Dany out of it. So, no wonder that everybody on the council, including Tywin and Tyrion just dismissed it as tall tales from far lands. And they didn't get any more news on that score until Tywin was dead.
3866	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	In the books obviously Tywin doesn't care about the threats across the Sea or beyond the Wall.
Â 
In the show, I think Tywin doesn't care about the dragons even if he believes they exist, he was just trying to get Oberyn on his side and gave him some lame ass excuses.
Â 
I do hope they include some Council meetings where they all argue amongst themselves. That would be fun to watch, it doesn't happen in the books.
Â 
Â 
Â 
If Tywin did try to do anything against Dany, my bet is his first move would be to send spies to gather info on her, followed by assassins maybe.

Â 
I agree. And I also don't think Oberyn bought any of it, but sees the offer as a chance to get information, as well as opportunities to poison Tywin.
3868	lezboyd	2014-04-21	I saw the scene and thought Tywin was just exaggerating the threats to the 7k in terms of Wildlings and the Dragons in order to get Oberyn and ultimately dorne, into the fold. He may have sounded like he believed they were real threats but he was playing it up to get Oberyn by his side, and sealed the deal by offering up the Mountain as bait.

Wouldn't that ruin a good storyline? The line about Arianne's betrothed dying to a pot of gold was one of the best in the books, followed by "Justice. Vengeance. Fire and Blood"
3873	El Guapo	2014-04-21	The show meeds to start connecting Dany to Westeros and I believe that is what the scene last night was trying to do. There will also be a small council meeting later in the season where they are discussing Dany (per the preview of things to come video). I think they will also make it crystal clear at the end of the season that Tyrion is being set off to join Daenerys.
3874	WRX1985	2014-04-21	The only reason i can think of Tywin starting to take the dragon threat seriously is the fact they arent stunted deformities, they are getting bigger, and the reports of their growing must have reached him.Â
3875	Trebla	2014-04-21	I liked how the rumors of Dany's dragons are lost in translation in the books, seeing as most of the tales come from sailors and not spies, they put a little hyperbole in their stories. In the show, I guess they didnt want to deal with that.


I liked the change because it's necessary due to the change in timeline. In the books, not a lot of time passed between books 1 and 3. But the show has to deal with the younger actors aging. So Tywin not knowing or not taking Dany serious on the show makes it look odd.
3876	lezboyd	2014-04-21	One wonders when the hell it does dawn in the south?
Even George has left this hanging in the novels.


Â 
The South is more concerned with playing the iron Throne game to worry about small stuff like dragons and white-walkers. Heck, even the Boltons do not take this seriously. They are also more concerned with claiming the North to worry about all this.
3877	Lord Damian	2014-04-21	This is a pre- empt for Quentin's journey and leaves open a possibilty for a potentially "forged wedding contract" on the show while a potentially real one existed in another written story. ala, a book.
3878	metr0man	2014-04-21	It was explicitly stated last year in a small council meeting that Tywin wants the Northerners and Wildlings to keep each other busy.Â
3879	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Book Tywin didn't give a fuck about Wildlings, and even less about Daenerys. Show Tywin is different.
3880	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-21	Book Tywin didn't give a fuck about Wildlings, and even less about Daenerys. Show Tywin is different.


Yeah, show Tywin was even smiling during the purple wedding.
3881	yushkevitch	2014-04-21	It's possible that Tywin doesn't take the threat seriously but was just using the gossip about Dany as ammunition in his conversation with Oberyn.


Â 
This is pretty much it. Tywin is a smart man, no doubt he would use whatever he could to convince Oberyn to join him, even if he doesn't believe the Dany & her pets are a threat himself.
3882	Stark11	2014-04-21	So just a theory here based on if Tywin really does believe Dany is a threat. 
In the books Ser Barriston saves Dany from Mero(?) outside of Meereen and that leads to her finding out the truth of Ser Jorah. If show Tywin believes Dany and her dragons are real maybe he will either A: instruct Varys to tell Jorah to take out Dany and somehow this message will be found by Barriston, Daario or someone and that will lead to Jorah's punishment. Or B: he sends his own assassin that knows of Jorah's involvement and before the assassin dies he reveals what Jorah was really doing early on to Dany. 
I guess that would be a logical way to have Dany find out this information since they can't do it how the book goes about it. 
This would be a big variation between show and book Tywin but since we all know what's going to happen I think I would enjoy this deviation. 
Overall I do believe he is just BS-ing with Oberyn to persuade him to be a judge and get Dorne on his side.
3883	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-21	Well it's in the novels too.
Not only the Wildings southern movement but worse not taking the Others seriously at this point.
All the impending doom in the North goes on for a long enough time that some serious intelligence about it should have reached KL by now , in the novels and in the show.
One wonders when the hell it does dawn in the south?
Even George has left this hanging in the novels.I believe there is a reason to this.  Everything from the north is getting mocked and I dont believe many are taking dany seriously.  On top of that they are fighting a war to some extent at this point and trying to reunite the kingdom.  You have everyone who cares only about their house and behind the door deals that if by chance there was some credible evidence besides a rotten piece of meat that thorne brings to kings landing.  I dont think it would matter regardless.  There is such an imbalance with the powers at be that getting any assistance to the north or worrying about dany is impossible.  The help that is needed for the wall and to counter dany is for the kingdom to be united, in which at this point is not even close.  It wouldn't make sense for all of sudden Tywin to shift his attention from the turmoil that surrounds his family and the realm to unite for everyone to go north.  It would be so far off from what this book and tv show is about that it would be laughable.

3884	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-21	Yeah, why would show Tywin think telling Oberyn about Dany would convince him to join up with the Lannisters? "Hey so I know you're still upset that we killed Elia but her sister-in-law has dragons so... Join us!"
I do like Stark11's theory about this being used to put Mormont's betrayal back into play, though.
3885	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-21	One criticism of the show which I have is that the Westerosi players (Varys, LF, Tywin, etc.) are entirely too well-informed about what is happening on the other side of the world.
(But for some reason, Dany does not have the same level of information about what's happening in Westeros. So far, all she's heard is "by the way King Robert the Usurper is dead - only because Barristan sailed all the way to Qarth to tell her.)
Â 
Â 
In the books, the lords of Westeros are dismissive of what is apparently happening way over there, in part because they're too focused on what their own immediate concerns, but in part because you simply cannot confirm any of it as truthful unless you start to hear many accounts of an event that all sound the same. It's not like people have news networks - by the time you hear anything about events far away, it is indistinguishable from rumours and tall tales.
Â 
In the show, they are getting information that is too solid and too soon. Did HBO think they had to dumb things down for the Twitter-generation audience, who wouldn't understand a world where communication across long distances is nearly non-existent ? Now they've established that Tywin Lannister has heard some truly game-changing, forget-everything-else information. And inexplicably, Tywin decides to casuallyÂ  tell this information to the one person who'd be most pleased to hear that House Lannister will burn in dragonfire, as a sales pitch for an alliance.
Â 
Â 
I hope this is written as some sort of feint to test whether Oberyn knows this already and is disloyal, because otherwise ... Â Â  Â Â

Â 
Show Dany is aware of the war of five kings in season 2. IT was part of the rift between her and Jorah. His advice was for her to get a boat and sail right away to Westoros and rally the lords there to her cause, where she wanted to use Qarth. Season goes on, they plunder it and she goes to buy the Unsullied for her army, but gets distracted in her free the slaves campaign.
Â 
Tywin I think is just playing it up and doesn't really believe that its a real threat. My clue is he mentions the Grey Joys rebellion in the same breath and Dany and the Wildlings. From what we gathered from Roose last week Tywin isn't to concerned with taking care of the Grey Joys or actually helping Roose take the north, which leads me to believe that he doesn't really see Dany or the Wildlings as a threat either. He is just being coy trying to play Oberyn. For what purpose exactly I am not sure.
3887	The Reckoner	2014-04-21	Roose is his Warden of the North. They're his problem.

Â 


Â 
True, and also I find it hard to believe that if in the show, Tywin was aware of Dany's dragons, he didn't do anything about it other than use her as an excuse to win over Oberyn. This is the man who ended the Targ line for Robert, you'd think he'd be a tad more concerned about Dany.
Â 
Maybe Tywin does believe it, but dismisses them thinking she won't be here anytime soon because her dragons are young.

Â 


Â 
In the show, xaro xhoan daxos was the one who first informed her about Robert's death back in season two. Barristan just repeats it again later on. So it works both ways. Except Dany doesn't have her own master of whispers to keep her updated.
3891	Darth Pipes	2014-04-21	In the book, Tywin doesn't give a damn about the Wildling threat.Â  I think he just threw in that bit and about Dany to get Oberyn to bring Dorne back in the fold.

Â 
Yepp, he tells her, and then she tells Jorah later and also mentions the war of five kings (belive she mentions the country is at war), and expresses her desire to press her claim and considers Xaro's offer to get it done quickly, while Jorah wants them to get a boat and just go back and get the houses on her side. Jorah also only thinks its a rumor Xaro made up to rile her up.
Â 
Ya then Barristan confirms it again for them.
3893	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-22	This is scene would be fine if they hadn't made Tywin dismiss the threat of the dragons last season. As such, it comes off as inconsistent (yeah, I could fanwank it and say that he probably heard the dragons are getting bigger, but it's still clumsy)

Â 
Bran saw the shadow of a dragon over King's Landing, and everyone assumed it meant the dragons themselves coming there.Â  But what if it just meant the shadow of the dragon came to the city, as in the threat of the dragons?Â  Because in the very next episode after the vision, Tywin indicates the threat they pose.

3896	Lord Varys	2014-04-22	Read the books, guys!
Â 
In the books, an important point of the story is that Lord Tywin never learned that Daenerys Stormborn was alive and had hatched herself three dragons. Those news only arrive in KL at the very end of ADwD when Ser Kevan, Mace Tyrell, and Grand Maester Pycelle discuss Dany opposed to Aegon.
Â 
In the big council scene in ASoS Varys tells the council about a three-headed dragon that has hatched in Qarth, putting it in context of the sightings of huge krakens. Tywin doesn't know that this has anything to do with Daenerys Targaryen. If had known, he would have taken that thing very seriously, not only because his family had killed three members of House Targaryen (opposed to Robert's one), but because Tywin himself was familiar with the history of House Targaryen.
Â 
Varys succeeded in taking out Tywin before he ever learned what was coming his way.
Â 
Show Tywin acts dumb in this whole thing if you ask me. First he does not take the dragon seriously at all (season 3), and then he wants the Martells to ally with him against Daenerys? Does he not know that Oberyn wanted Dorne to declare for Viserys? He can't know anything about the secret marriage pact, but he must know that telling the Martells about Dany and her dragons would not exactly motivate them to ally with the Lannisters...
In fact, Tywin's whole policy towards Dorne would have changed if he had known about Dany and her dragons. He would have realized that the Dornishmen would use this opportunity to ally with the Targaryen queen.

In the books, an important point of the story is that Lord Tywin never learned that Daenerys Stormborn was alive and had hatched herself three dragons. Those news only arrive in KL at the very end of ADwD when Ser Kevan, Mace Tyrell, and Grand Maester Pycelle discuss Dany opposed to Aegon.
Â 
In the big council scene in ASoS Varys tells the council about a three-headed dragon that has hatched in Qarth, putting it in context of the sightings of huge krakens. Tywin doesn't know that this has anything to do with Daenerys Targaryen. If had known, he would have taken that thing very seriously, not only because his family had killed three members of House Targaryen (opposed to Robert's one), but because Tywin himself was familiar with the history of House Targaryen.
Â 
Varys succeeded in taking out Tywin before he ever learned what was coming his way.
Â 
Show Tywin acts dumb in this whole thing if you ask me. First he does not take the dragon seriously at all (season 3), and then he wants the Martells to ally with him against Daenerys? Does he not know that Oberyn wanted Dorne to declare for Viserys? He can't know anything about the secret marriage pact, but he must know that telling the Martells about Dany and her dragons would not exactly motivate them to ally with the Lannisters...
In fact, Tywin's whole policy towards Dorne would have changed if he had known about Dany and her dragons. He would have realized that the Dornishmen would use this opportunity to ally with the Targaryen queen.


Â 
You guys are looking at the cards and not the player. When Joffrey raised the dragons Tywin shut it down because he was already aware and did not need a 15 year old back seat driving his kingdom so he put him in his place. Watching that scene when you see him step up to the throne and tower over Joffrey it is clear his only goal is to remind him that Tywin is the one with the power, and is not subject to Joffreys inquisition. By dismissing the dragons he is dismissing Joffrey.Â 
Â 
When speaking to Oberyn the conversation began as a probe into his complicity with poisoning Joffrey, and then turned to Oberyn joining the small council and becoming a part of the fold and decision making. He threw out some basic information to bring Oberyn closer but nothing the world was not already talking about. This achieves two things, it allows him a closer look at a man he considers his enemy (oberyn) who may have poisoned his grandson and also begins a possible alliance which would come at the cost of gregor clegianes head but yield an entire army of Dornish.Â 
Â 
in both cases he has been using the information at hand to position the person in front of him the way he wants them. He wanted Joffrey to shut up and let him handle the grown up matters, and he wanted Oberyn to feel closer to the fold so he could watch him more closely. Neither conversation would be a true reflection of his opinion of the actual dragons and whether or not he considers them to be serious threats.Â
3898	Lord Varys	2014-04-22	Well, the bad writing is in both scenes evident. Who the hell would have told Joff about Dany and the dragons? Varys? Not likely. But then, the bad writing started in season 2, when Varys told Tyrion about Dany and her dragons in Qarth.
Â 
Joff asking Tywin about Dany and her dragons is bad in itself, not the fact that Tywin is then using this sort of thing to put Joff back into his place. I never got what that was about, anyway. Joff is the king, and Tywin's grandson. He should try to teach him how to rule, not try to take power away from him. Tywin is an old man, he won't be there forever. And if does not teach Joff how to cling to power, everything he has accomplished will be lost in the very moment Tywin dies.
Â 
And, honestly, I'm not sure TV Tywin is considering Dany a huge threat. He dismisses the size of the dragons in the same manner Jorah questioned the very existence of the dragons back in season 1. There's a pattern there. And this pattern does not portray the characters as very smart guys. As of yet, Tywin has done nothing to get rid of Daenerys, and book Tywin would have hired professional assassins (most likely Faceless Men) the very moment he learned of the existence of Dany and her dragons. GRRM knows as much, because he made House Lannister the richest family in Westeros. It would be madness/suicide for the Lannisters to not assassinate Dany while she is still half a world a way, or to inform their enemies (i.e. the Martells) of her existence to enable them to join forces with her. If Tywin allows Dany to come close to Westeros, the support for 'King Joffrey/Tommen' will diminish and disappear.

3899	Maia	2014-04-22	As of yet, Tywin has done nothing to get rid of Daenerys, and book Tywin would have hired professional assassins (most likely Faceless Men) the very moment he learned of the existence of Dany and her dragons..

Agreed, except for the fact that Tywin would/could never hire the Faceless Men. Their fee is 3/4 of everything you own, after all, and it would be the end of House  Lannister. But certainly, he would have sent skilled assassins after Dany and the dragons, both.
Re: show Joff, yea. It seems that unlike in the books, Tywin never had an intention to try educating him. Which, coupled with the lack of kinslaying taboo in the show, makes him look a likely suspect in Joff's poisoning.
And naming Dany and her dragons as a reason for the Martells to ally with the Lannisters sounds downright stupid, IMHO, no matter how they play up Dornish bitterness re: Rhaegar's behaviour in the show. And yet, we are clearly supposed to see this move as a clever manipulation on Tywin's part. Hm...
3900	Arkash	2014-04-22	It was said before but just throwing my thoughts here :
Â 
Okay, so in the book, we never really know how Tywin considers the rumors in the East, but I think it's a nice move from the show (after much inner debate) to have Tywin considering it aloud.
First, it makes him look competent and will show an incapable Cersei more efficiently next season.
Two, it was one of the only way to throw some Dornish history in the show ! And come on, who doesnt want as much as possible about Dornish History ?
It proves it's a really important kingdom, and the Martell as a really great family of Westeros.
I allows the show not to deal with all the sailors rumors and stories. Shortcuts.
And last but not least : it gives some great credit to the dialogue with Oberyn, which I really loved !
3901	Lord Varys	2014-04-22	I'd be very surprised if the Faceless Men did indeed fee always 3/4 of everything you own. That would be a rather costly assassin guild working model. It seems as if a good deal of their contracts is revenge stuff - woman who was wronged by the insurance guy, father of the Waif -, but I'd be very surprised if that was all of it. It's very likely that they set individual fees, and have also a contingent of assassinations for really rich customers, especially if they are somehow connected to the Iron Bank.
Â 
And Dornish history could have been mentioned in a thousand other ways. Say, by discussing Dornish history with Oberyn/other characters, not a possible alliance against Daenerys Targaryen. By mentioning the special role and status Dorne always had. By mentioning that Myrcella and Tommen should succeed Joffrey due to Dornish law. And so on.
Â 
The show really sucks at portraying size, distance, and the passing of time. Not to speak of the subtleties of politics and council conversations.

The faceless man charging rate depends on the target. Taking out a princess or any person of real power apparently costs as much as raising an army. Considering Danaerys is a queen with a monstrous army, control of a city and dragons, it would probably take all of the gold of Casterly Rock and Highgarden combined.
Â 
Ironically if they had put the hit on Danaerys in season 1 it would have probably been quite affordable. LF had a point.
3903	Titan	2014-04-22	Read the books, guys!

Â 
So what? It is necessary for the TV show - where any linkage between the Westeros and Essos stories are helpful. Otherwise it seems like two separate shows packaged as one. Increased awareness of what is happening in Essos is a GOOD change for the TV format.
3904	Maia	2014-04-22	It's very likely that they set individual fees, and have also a contingent of assassinations for really rich customers, especially if they are somehow connected to the Iron Bank..
Personally, I find it extremely unlikely, or the Faceless Men would have been used far more widely in power struggles, etc. The explanation of their fee being 3/4 of all customer's posessions sensibly restricts the use of the Faceless Men by the sitting rulers and pretenders, so that it is believable that they would still need wars, etc. 
And if they work for IB, why would IB need to give Stannis an unlimited credit? They'd just have to kill Tommen and/or a few other Lannisters - much cheaper.
Oh, and if Tywin could have afforded a FM, I am sure that Aerys would have died sooner than he did and much more discreetly.

3905	Lord Varys	2014-04-23	I don't think that such a connection is necessary for the TV show. Or rather, that a connection that's more in accordance with the books would have been better (i.e. Varys actively disinforming/downplaying events in Essos), or perhaps another secret meeting with Varys and Illyrio under the Red Keep where they discussed Selmy's journey to Dany and/or the effects the birth of the dragons has for their plans.
Â 
Having people discuss Dany and her dragons avails to nothing, if they don't act on that. And they can't act on it, because the plot does not allow them to.
Â 
They could have easily made Joff's and Tywin's talk in season 3 about Stannis, not the dragons. Joff dismissing Stannis as a real threat - because he had broken him on the Blackwater - and then Tywin coming up his assessment of Stannis as their most serious rival contender.Â 
Â 
On the Faceless Men/the Iron Bank:
Â 
If there is a connection between these two - and would be very surprised if that's not the case - then the game most likely goes like that. If a powerful customer of the Iron Bank fails to pay his due, the Iron Bank first strikes a deal with one of his rivals, ensuring that he'll give the Iron Bank its due. Afterwards, Faceless Men are employed to help take out the original client of the bank and/or to smoothen the way for the new claimant. It would make no sense to do this before an understanding is reached with the new claimant, if it's all about money.
Â 
I'm also inclined to believe that the House of Black and White is a major shareholder/the owner of the Iron Bank. The Iron Bank would not have the reputation it has if it has no secret weapon other major banks lack. And it has been established that the banks of the other Free Cities cannot be compared to the Iron Bank in that capacity.
3906	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-23	One criticism of the show which I have is that the Westerosi players (Varys, LF, Tywin, etc.) are entirely too well-informed about what is happening on the other side of the world.
(But for some reason, Dany does not have the same level of information about what's happening in Westeros. So far, all she's heard is "by the way King Robert the Usurper is dead - only because Barristan sailed all the way to Qarth to tell her.)
Â 
Â 
In the books, the lords of Westeros are dismissive of what is apparently happening way over there, in part because they're too focused on what their own immediate concerns, but in part because you simply cannot confirm any of it as truthful unless you start to hear many accounts of an event that all sound the same. It's not like people have news networks - by the time you hear anything about events far away, it is indistinguishable from rumours and tall tales.
Â 
In the show, they are getting information that is too solid and too soon. Did HBO think they had to dumb things down for the Twitter-generation audience, who wouldn't understand a world where communication across long distances is nearly non-existent ? Now they've established that Tywin Lannister has heard some truly game-changing, forget-everything-else information. And inexplicably, Tywin decides to casuallyÂ  tell this information to the one person who'd be most pleased to hear that House Lannister will burn in dragonfire, as a sales pitch for an alliance.
Â 
Â 
I hope this is written as some sort of feint to test whether Oberyn knows this already and is disloyal, because otherwise ... Â Â  Â Â 


Â 
News about a girl conquering cities with an animal who hasn't been around for hundreds of years would take huge precedence and travel a lot quicker than news of Westerosi lords squabbling as usual. The Essos clique could probably care less who's backstabbing who at this point.
Â 
Not to mention, if the primary means of communication between cities and ports are ravens/sailors(word of mouth) it's not like Dany has access to this as readily as any other party. They're basically raiders wandering the desert.

3907	Northern_Star	2014-04-23	Â 
True, and also I find it hard to believe that if in the show, Tywin was aware of Dany's dragons, he didn't do anything about it other than use her as an excuse to win over Oberyn. This is the man who ended the Targ line for Robert, you'd think he'd be a tad more concerned about Dany.
Â 
Maybe Tywin does believe it, but dismisses them thinking she won't be here anytime soon because her dragons are young.


Â 
The matter is pretty simple: Dorn was offered a council seat by Tyrion in the books, as far as i can remember this didnt happen in the show, which is good cause it would have confused the audience. Now where the audience knows the character they just had to make things up.
Â 
I see Tywin (book & show) as a practical man, he deals with problems when they have to be dealt with. There's nothing Tywin Lannister isnt aware of; Wildlings, Others, Dragons - all at their due time.
3908	DominusNovus	2014-04-23	Yeah, why would show Tywin think telling Oberyn about Dany would convince him to join up with the Lannisters? "Hey so I know you're still upset that we killed Elia but her sister-in-law has dragons so... Join us!"


Â 
Pretty much word for word what I said when I saw that scene. Â Its an epic example of Tywin being really dumb, as far as I'm concerned.
Â 
Dorne was the kingdom most loyal to the Targaryens, and Robert only kept them in the fold through constant diplomatic work by Jon Arryn. This isn't explicitly mentioned in the show, I think, but its alluded to. Â Then, throw in the fact that Oberyn's sister was married to Dany's brother. These are just the facts that Tywin *would* know for certain.
Â 
He wouldn't necessarily know that Oberyn's niece was betrothed to Viserys. Â He wouldn't know that Oberyn's nephew is going on a journey to marry Dany. Â But he would know that neither of them were betrothed to anyone else, despite being two of the most eligible heirs on the entire continent. Â That, alone, would inspire some speculation as to what the Martells were planning with their first and second in line to the Dornish throne. Â Throw in that surely, Tywin must be at least somewhat aware that Doran is, himself, not exactly an unaccomplished schemer.
Â 
So, throw all that together, and Tywin somehow comes up with portraying Dany as a threat to someone who would likely be one of her most ardent supporters, just based on the known information.

Â 
You just reminded me of Doran describing himself in AFFC as the grass on which no one fears to tread, even though this same grass conceals the viper.Â  I had never considered how odd it must look to outsiders than neither Arianne and Quentyn are betrothed or married, especially now that their younger brother is betrothed to Myrcella!

Â 
Thats exactly the quote that I had in mind when describing Doran. Â He's mild demeanor might fool some into think that he's weak, but I just can't see Tywin being that gullible, particularly when a fellow Lord Paramount is concerned.
3911	FalseKnight	2014-04-23	So show Tywin recruits Oberyn by telling him that the 7K need Dorne to fight against Dany's dragons because she is at their doorstep (for sure!).
Â 
Now, is hinted that book Oberyn actually signed the Arianne-Viserys marriage pact and that before Quentyn started his faithful trip to Meereen nobody took tales of dragons as something serious, so having a capable hand of the king that is aware of Targaryen Dragons is not something on Oberyn's best interests.
Â 
Varys kept telling the small council that his little birds heard tales of dragons in slaver's bay, together with crakens sinking ships by the isle of nuncles and a conflict between the Snarks and Wabberjockies, so enough to claim that he informed the council but not framed to be taken seriously.
Â 
The issue here is that I don't remember any hint of book Tywin taking the dragon threat seriously. So what is show Tywin planning on doing with the impending dragon invasion? Dornish-style guerilla warfare?, that would hardly result in his golden grandson keeping his crown.
Â 
The scenario I'll like to discuss is what can Tywin realistically do to keep Dany away from Westeros?
Â 
Â 


Â 
He could give the slavers money for sellsword companies, or hire sellsword companies and keep them in Dorne. Given the later events in ASoS, this shouldn't matter. I think the show is tossing us a red herring.

Indeed.Â  I am quite sad that we never see Oberyn in Dorne.Â  When I re-read the scene where the Mountain kills him, it is still quite a kick in the teeth.Â
3913	Charles Phipps	2014-04-20	So what do you think of their portrayal in the show? It seems like they're trying to treat the Wildlings as a threat now versus them as just another group of Seven Kingdom types. It seems a little...off to me.

How about you?
3914	Queen of Whores	2014-04-20	I'm happy they're being shown as completely evil, if only so Stannis' arrival and defeat of them is at least slightly victorious for him.
3915	NightStark	2014-04-21	Raiding is what the wildlings do, the only difference here is that the Thenn's eat people.
3916	HouseHarrison	2014-04-21	Honestly even in the books you got the impression that Wildling raids were brutal vicious affairs that saw wholesale slaughter, so I wasn't really offended by that. It was the singling out of the Thenns as the cannibal savages that irks me.
3917	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-21	I think they're trying to douche them up so we don't feel as bad when they die - 'specially Ygritte.
3918	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-21	Tv-Tormund is boring.
Magnar of Thenn is a generic savage
Ygritte is badass (ok, I have a crush for her)

3919	Lord Damian	2014-04-21	There is a reason that the noble house Stark did not invite wildings to "settle" the gift. They have/had to be broken first, then potentially offer "options".
3920	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-21	The wildlings have always been a threat, and they've always been brutal.
3921	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-21	I think they're trying to douche them up so we don't feel as bad when they die - 'specially Ygritte.


Â 
Who looked incredibly sexy in the wide shot after her she loosed her first arrow, I might add 
Â 
But yeah.. if any time a bit more 'gratuitous violence' could be beneficial to development of a villain, this could be it.. Thenn's aside of course but it was kind of a "Potattooooessss.. boom.. boom.. eat yer mama & papa.. go to castle black tell the crows how BAMF we are IRL" .. visually it didn't do a lot for me but I didn't mind the scene.
3922	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	It was good to see Ygritte killing some innocent people to show that she's still a ruthless person. I was worried they were going to have the Thenns do all the bad stuff from now on because the audience identifies with Ygritte and Tormund.
3923	KalibakCruel	2014-04-21	I don't mind the woke Thenns as cannibal thing really. They look creepy and savage, works for me.
3924	Dain Storm	2014-04-21	The cannibal thing is still annoying, but this scene is fine. They're Wildlings. They raid and pillage and rape.
3925	averde	2014-04-21	I'm happy they're being shown as completely evil, if only so Stannis' arrival and defeat of them is at least slightly victorious for him.

This.
3926	lezboyd	2014-04-21	I understand why they included this scene, but at the same time, it was unnecessary, since it diffused all the tension from Jon Snow's storyline.
Â 
In the books, there is no communication sent by the wildlings beforehand, as far as I remember. So the entire burden of convincing his brothers in black to prepare for war falls on Jon Snow's shoulders. This scene diffuses the tension, as the wildlings have made their presence and their intentions known.
Â 
Very well executed scene, though.
3927	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-21	Gonna make a giant leap now with the way that little boy was looking at Ygritte that he is the one to stick a fatal arrow in her. Â Preferrably Jon trains him.

Yep, I think he's going to be the one who kills her.

3935	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	The scene cracked me up, it was so cheesy and over the top.

Like the Qarth scenes in season 2, I'm just gonna imagine it was deliberately done like that for lulz.

There was nothing cheesy or funny about it, IMHO.
3937	ViennaGirl	2014-04-21	I feel like if the Thenns had been regularly raiding and eating Northerners, the Starks and others (even Southerners) would have been way more careful to staff up the Night's Watch. There's no way the NW ends up being 300 guys if Thenns are hopping over the wall for carry-out once a month.

Â 
If I remember the books correctly, the Thenns were from much farther North to bother having to cross the Wall again and again for "food". One of the reasons why they turned to cannibalism.

Â 
I think that's right - the Thenns were from farther away (and actually, they also weren't cannibals - some other wildlings were, plus the Skagosi). The Thenns had a more Westerosi-style way of life - lords, armor, etc. But I guess I still think that TV-Starks and TV-Southerners would be more worried about TV-Thenns eating them...

It would be ironic if Jon was the one who trained him how to shoot a bow and it turned out he then shot Ygritte.
3942	The hairy bear	2014-04-21	I didn't like it. The wildlings can be cruel and brutal, but they have a purpose. They should not be depicted as people who enjoy killing for the sake of it.
3943	lostinasia	2014-04-21	I didn't like it. The wildlings can be cruel and brutal, but they have a purpose. They should not be depicted as people who enjoy killing for the sake of it.


There was a definite strategic purpose here - they're causing havoc in order to draw out and weaken the Night's Watch. The Thenns may be doing this kind of thing for fun, but presumably Ygritte and Tormund aren't. Even the main Thenn guy was involved in the strategy - that's why he let the boy go.
Â 
I suppose it's not far off Tywin destroying the Riverlands. It's brutal but strategically useful; unlike many of his commanders, Tywin doesn't seem to take any pleasure in it (or feel much guilt!).
3944	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	While wildlings and Westerosi are not natural enemies - they share common interests - they do fight and kill each other. The Night's Watch raids wildling camps beyond the Wall, and the wildlings raid Westerosi villages south of the Wall. It's frustrating to watch because it's completely pointless, but it is a part of the world.
3945	Chuck88	2014-04-21	Gonna make a giant leap now with the way that little boy was looking at Ygritte that he is the one to stick a fatal arrow in her. Â Preferrably Jon trains him.


Â 
Yep. The shot lingers on her from his POV for quite a while.Â Can't say I blame the kid.Â 
Still not sure what the point of Joseph Gatt's character is yet. He's a Thenn warg but why was his casting the only one that was so mysterious I wonder.Â
3946	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-21	I didn't like it. The wildlings can be cruel and brutal, but they have a purpose. They should not be depicted as people who enjoy killing for the sake of it.


Â 
LOL. You really don't think people like Varamyr, Rattleshirt, Harma Dogshead, or The Weeper enjoy killing? Besides the point here was to draw out the Night's Watch, which is extremely obvious if you watched the scene.
3947	The hairy bear	2014-04-21	There was a definite strategic purpose here - they're causing havoc in order to draw out and weaken the Night's Watch. The Thenns may be doing this kind of thing for fun, but presumably Ygritte and Tormund aren't. Even the main Thenn guy was involved in the strategy - that's why he let the boy go.
Â 
I suppose it's not far off Tywin destroying the Riverlands. It's brutal but strategically useful; unlike many of his commanders, Tywin doesn't seem to take any pleasure in it (or feel much guilt!).


But the actual actions of the wildlings in the scene itself didn't trasmit that there was a strategic purpose, even if afterwards that was how the show justified it. I would have been OK with some plunder and rape, but not the calculated extermination of every single member of a village, with added cruelty and caricauresque comic villains.
Â 
Tormund and the Thenns are suposed to become reliable allies of the Watch. They shouldn't risk making it seem that the White Walkers are a lesser evil.

Â 
They slaughtered a village and let someone go to warn Castle Black. It seems pretty straightforward, similar to Theon's feint at Torrhen's Square. In fact it almost works but luckily Thorne, Aemon, and Jon aren't stupid.Â 
Â 
The Thenns are awkwardly cruel, they remind me of The Bloody Mummers except instead of rape they partake in cannabalism.

3949	Kasporio	2014-04-21	In the books, its supposed to be a sneaky raid on castleblack. Well, since Snow escaped, caution is useless. But the same speech about cannibalism still bother me. "I'll eat your folks cuz i'm a wicked son of a bitch..."
Before they get to castleblack, every thenns will be fatter than Sam. And probably afflicted with many debilitating diseases you get when you eat people.
And even if they are badass cannibals, why not partaking in rapes? In most cases, lust is the first priority, food comes next.
3950	Tankbuster	2014-04-21	I guess eating your own Baby batter will disgust even the HBOThenns.
3951	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-21	Gonna make a giant leap now with the way that little boy was looking at Ygritte that he is the one to stick a fatal arrow in her. Â Preferrably Jon trains him.


Â 
He might be the Satin replacement?Â Bowen and the other NW brothers will crack up because the LC steward is just a little boy with no experience as opposed to him being a whore. Actually, this could be quite cute...Jon could develop a faher/big brother bond with him and take out all his sorrow over his 'dead siblings' on protecting this little boy who lost his father/family just like Jon. Although,Â I'm probably jumping the gun hereÂ and I still want Satin to turn up...we need a Jatin tumblr page.
Â 
Jon did seem nice to him- holding his shoulder for support/comfort. I wouldn't be surprised if they give him a bigger role other thanÂ just being an extra for the one episode.
Â 
He might even be killed in front of Jon or something by Ygritte and then Jon kills her...adding to the angst? Although, that might destroy the 'we should have stayed in the cave' scene.
Â 
The little boy might even tell Jon that a red headed wildling woman killed his father so Jon is aware of how dangerous Ygritte really is.
Â 
Although, yeah him killing Ygritte would be justifiable considering she killed his father. I don't think I'll miss her.

3952	Greywolf2375	2014-04-21	the raid itself is fine, just the over the top way they're having lines delivered is what gets to me. Â Raids aren't gentle, they aren't taking prisoners so the slaughter was expected...the warning/gonna eat your parents was sloppy.
3953	Talleyrand	2014-04-21	Â 
I think that's right - the Thenns were from farther away (and actually, they also weren't cannibals - some other wildlings were, plus the Skagosi). The Thenns had a more Westerosi-style way of life - lords, armor, etc. But I guess I still think that TV-Starks and TV-Southerners would be more worried about TV-Thenns eating them...


I don't think TV Thenns have really been south of the wall either, Styr talks about the people tasting better in the south like its something new to him
3954	FNF	2014-04-21	The cannibal angle is extremely cheesy. I also dislike how this might change the Stannis-Jon wilding integration policy. I mean, who wants cannibals south of the Wall, let alone marrying the potential heir to Karhold.
Â 
Other than that, this raid was pretty well done, minus the fact it looks like they are in the south during spring.

It's only the Thenns, don't let them through..boom done. Alys storyline won't happen.

Â 
I kinda agree with this. Yes, it's a raid, it's supposed to be violent, but Jon staying with them was supposed to show us that they and the Watch are in danger of the same thing: the Others. Many Unsullied don't get that vibe.
3957	Kasporio	2014-04-21	TV wildlings are portrayed as somewhat total dorks. They dont know how many garrisons the watch maintains, nor many black brothers defend it. In the books, they are planning the invasion, in the show its "lets move south and try" thing.
3958	FNF	2014-04-21	It's only the Thenns, don't let them through..boom done. Alys storyline won't happen.


But what made the Wildlings interesting imo was the fact that they had diverse groups, like the Thenns who stood out as more like people 'south of the wall'.Â
3959	FC_Lymond	2014-04-21	I think their excessive violence does cause some problems.Â 
Â 
I think it really changes how we look at Mance most of all.Â  This is his plan.Â  And he has let loose cannibals into the North.Â
3960	NightStark	2014-04-21	But what made the Wildlings interesting imo was the fact that they had diverse groups, like the Thenns who stood out as more like people 'south of the wall'.Â 
Yeah but them being cannibals is a bit too diverse..nobody would believe the NW would just welcome them through.
A lot of this stuff is catering to the show only people..Thenn's have been changed to show that the wildings aren't all the same and break down the goodwill Tormund etc. have earned for them.
Not letting other Thenns through the Wall later won't make much difference to the story at the end of the day.

Honestly, I think GRRM has for the most part portrayed wildlings as 'noble savages'. If D&D left alone the cannibal angle, the Wildlings would remain 'grey' in my opinion.

I've seen it on other forums with people saying that the NW should team up with them but it's only really after their back is broken and Mance is taken that the wildlings are willing to listen and compromise. Even then the Watch still takes hostages just to be sure.

3965	Iralius	2014-04-21	See, I get that they want to demonstrate that they aren't all noble savages - however, they could do this by not changing the Thenns in such a way. Imagine, instead, you have Tormund say 'I fuck hate Thenns' and marching from the North (or South, whichever) come what look like southern knights, almost. Except their armour is forged entirely out of bronze with fur and hide accents, and their helms are shaped to more resemble monstrous faces than regular helms. They march in perfect lockstep and make the bedraggled Wildlings with Tormund and Ygritte look like barbarians in comparison.

Styr is at the head of this formation, sneers at Tormund and says something along the lines of 'And here I thought you could handle a few weakling kneelers, Tall-Talker.'
Â 
Cut to the raid - you have the Wildlings attacking first, savage and wild and the villagers rushing to try and flee - right into the force of Thenns who is marching from the other direction and are just cutting the villagers down. Not all wild and barbaric like the other Wildlings but cold, almost mechanical. Styr still finds the boy, hoists him up and stares into his face and says 'Run to Castle Black - let the Crows know the Magnar of Thenn comes to pluck their feathers.'
Â 
Same impact, but you have a force that is frightening in the sense that they aren't going to 'give in' like the other Wildlings. They are uniformed, disciplined, and a terror for the Night's Watch because... well - the other Wildlings might break without a single when they think they're going to lose, or are going to attack like, well, barbarians. But then you have the Thenns who are formed in disciplined ranks and act and fight like southern soldiers - something the Night's Watch isn't used to fighting.
Â 
That's why, in the books, the Thenns seem to be frightening for the Night's Watch. With the other Wildlings you can get them to break and deal with them easier because they fight like barbarians. The Thenns you have to actually combat as if you were in a real war.
Â 
This shows the diversity rather well, it shows the Thenns as this force that is unquestioningly dedicated to their cause - but isn't going in for wholesale slaughter and bloodlust. It's a bit more interesting than what they are now, which is sort of these generic, savage, barbarians.
3966	FNF	2014-04-21	I think need to break down a bit of the goodwill the wildlings have earned or when the NW and Stannis smash them the show people will just cry 'Why did they do that they could have co-operated' etc.

I can understand that I suppose. I think D&D will have a problem demonstrating just how uncooperative the Wildlings are. Hell, in a first read of aDwD, I thought the Wildlings could turn on the Night's Watch at any moment. I think the Unsullied will be quite ignorant of this until D&D show how broken the Wildlings had to be before they bent the knee.
3967	of man and wolf	2014-04-21	Shouldnt it look colder by now? Shouldnt there be some snow at the least? Winter is coming. Even in the North near the dreadfort last week, we saw nothing but what looked like a healthy forest in the summer time.

Yeah, it has been pointed out by quite a few of us that it looks a little odd. I'm willing to forgive the producers though because when you're doing shooting scenes in that kind of environment, especially when you're using real castles as your set, it's difficult to balance CGI/fake snow with realism.
3969	Mel_Rose	2014-04-21	I appreciated the programme showing them as dangerous and cruel. I was actually kinda of shocked when I saw Ygritte was the one that had let that arrow - then of course I remembered she's not just a girl who has so far been feisty but also sweet and tender and in love; she is a warrior who kills people.
Â 
Jon's decision to allow the wildlings to pass the Wall was very controversial. No one will understand Bowen Marsh's concerns if all we see is Tormund and Ygritte being chummy. Viewers will not understand how controversial Jon's decision was and how desperate they all were against the Others.Â 
Â 
One more thing about the cannibals: there were cannibal tribes in the book and Jon let them pass. I do not remember him saying 'oh everyone can come except for the cannibal river tribes'. So he did accept cannibals. He populated the south of the Wall with (some) cannibals. Here they just decided to make cannibalism more prominent.
3970	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-21	Here's my take. On one hand this scene will make the wildlings a little less sympathetic in the future, but as others point out they did raids like this in the book, just off page. On the other hand making the wildings look like such savages and real threats to the wall/Westeros could make Stannis look like more of hero when he crushes the wildlings. Stannis needs a serious makeover in the show so I don't really have a problem with this tradeoff.Â
3971	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-21	LOL. How do you guys imagine wildling raids usually go? Why do you think the North despises them? It's not just blind prejudice. They're savages, and I'm glad the show didn't shy away from that
Â 
"HBO had the gall to accuratelyÂ depict a wildling raid! The must be trying to demonize them!"

Â

Â 
Obviously they're not going that route with the Thenns. That tribe is depicted as sadistic cannibals now, obvious villains who even creep out other Wildlings. Which is fine - the Thenns aren't an important part of the story. Â

3973	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-21	Â 
Styr was so cheesy this episode.


Â 
Â 
I do not like the TV portrayal of the Thenns. They could be scary without looking like mutants or something, nor acting as cannibals.
Â 
It would have been perfect if Styr had said all the same stuff to the scared little boy, to play on the fact the boy might think wildlings are cannibals - that would work, because then the boy goes running off to the wall crying about the wildlings were going to eat his mum and dad. But of course this potential cleverness was ruined by the fact that the Thenns already seem established in the show as actual cannibals.
3974	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-21	i like they way they did it. all we've known about wildlings comes from Ygritte, Tormund and Mance. now we see a whole different kind of wildling come into the picture. just shows that even theyre different clan to clan
3975	The Reckoner	2014-04-21	Â I wouldn't call them completely evil. Styr's men butchering the boy's parents in front of him is evil. Tormund and Ygritte dealing quick deaths is a mercy. Not completely evil, but not good either. Besides, as far as the wildlings know, the Northerners are a bunch of bigots. It seems like there's quite a few members that want some of that good old black-and-white morality. It's like you've forgotten what book series the show's based on.

3977	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-21	It helped characters like Ygritte and Tormund because it paints them as grey characters who we like sometimes, but who can come across as evil savages at other points.
Â 
Not sure what I thought of the Thenns. Even though it's probably over the top, their butchering of the boys parents and saying they were going to eat them was certainly more disturbing than cheesy, even if it was too much.
3978	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-21	I'm not really sure taunting a little boy before eating his dead parents can be considered "Cheesy." Pod and Tyrion's farewall is cheesy.Â
3979	C0bR	2014-04-21	It was like watching the beggining of The Two Towers. Only the mama got eaten instead of surviving.
3980	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	I like the wildlings being all savage and ruthless. That's what they are, merciless. Especially Styr, who was creepy as shit. They are that way to scare the villagers.
Â 
I'd rather they be like this than a bunch of pussies who left them alive.
Â 
Besides, in 3x09, we already saw that they didn't care about murdering an old man.
Â 
Â 
But when they come to the wildling civilians, I think they'll take a much softer stance on their portrayal.
3981	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-21	This is typically how raids by primitive cultures go, more or less. You think the Comanches or Zulur or similar groups showed mercy when they charged into a defenseless village?

Mance instructed them to wait for his signal, and then attack from the other side while he charges The Wall. I think it is pretty much implied that he wanted them to lay low till that point. I don't remember how it went down in the books though, so don't hold me up to it.

Cannibalism by itself is condemned as an awful crime in Westeros. Killing and then eating someone like the show!Thenns? That's like 10x worse.

4010	Tankbuster	2014-04-22	Well, it doesn't take much to reason that if a Double Agent from the watch has escaped, they must know of the wildling's coming and their sneak attack is ruined. Then the only way to weaken CB is to draw the rangers out Piecemeal and decimate them.
4011	Arkash	2014-04-22	Gonna make a giant leap now with the way that little boy was looking at Ygritte that he is the one to stick a fatal arrow in her. Â Preferrably Jon trains him.


Â 
Glad I'm not the only one thinking that !
Â 
Â 
Aside from that, I found the scene quite well done ! Reminds us of their ferocity !Â 
Â 
My main deception is Tormund. Come on ! "Har" a little for us man ! I hope they have so good Tormund scenes ahead !
Â 
But otherwise, the raiding scene was good, imo. And I dont mind the Thenns being cannibals ! Shortcuts. It always makes sense to merge different strong visual aspects of the story : in this case the bald bronze-armored Thenns and the cannibals Ice-River clans.
4012	Cameron	2014-04-22	i disliked the portrayal of the wildlings so far, i think its pretty far off from the books where they were just desperate people. yeah, they raided from time Â to time but its implied that many wildlings, if not the majority, were more concerned with feeding their families and making a living than wholesale slaughter. it makes letting the wildlings through the wall look like a stupid move on jons part. put another way, they are portraying the wildlings in the same way most southerners see them, not the way they are

Â 
I swear, Â Bookreaders Â miss half the enjoyment of the Show becuase they cant put the book down and actually pay attention to what is right in front of them.
Â 
In the very first episode of this season.
Â 
Tormund flat out says he's waiting for Mance's orders,
Â 
Ygitte says Tormund sent a man over the wall "at the full moon"Â 
Â 
When Styr shows up he says that Mance sent him and he chides Tormund for losing his baby crow.
Â 
Â 
i.e. Tormund sent a man back over the wall to tell Mance that Jon escaped and to get new orders and Â Mance sent Styr with reinforcements and new orders.

They're not showing the wildlings as loving slaughter, it's strictly a military tactic to draw the NW out and divide their forces.
Â 
The Thenns are the only ones that seem to enjoy it because they're getting a good meal out of it but that's only them. They can just have Jon say 'No Thenn's' next season when he's LC..the Alys thing won't be happening as it's not really critical to the story.

Â 
Use your critical thinking skills for one second please. Â THIS WASN'T MOST! Not even close. Â This was a raiding party.
Â 
It's like saying I thought the United States had lots of fat people, but the group of marines I just met were all in great shape. Â Boy or boy I was waaaaaaaaaaaaaay off.
4018	Rhaegar The Rocker	2014-04-22	My problem is the depiction of the Thenns. Â Are they going to drop the Thenn/Karstark subplot now? Â Well, also it seems weird to me that in the very first episode they managed to make the White Walkers look kind of what I had pictured in my head.... Then we get to that episode that makes them look like the zombie/mutants from I Am Legend only with beards.Â
4019	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-22	^ Personally, I find the look of the White Walkers to be very tree bark-ish. I'm not exactly sure what that means, in terms of the story at large, but it's definitely something I noticed.Â

Hmm that is an interesting observation. Â Perhaps eluding to some previous relationship with the Children of the Forrest? Â  I have never thought of it this way before but I like where the possibilities lead!Â

Â 
They can have a Tormund/Karstark subplot, or they can drop that really minor scheme altogether.Â
4022	Green Hand of Gardener	2014-04-22	I don't like show Tormund being domesticated by marrying into a Southern House. Just doesn't seem right fit for that character. They could use Gerrick Kingsblood in that storyline. Technically, it was his daughters who married Southern lords, they could just use him.
4023	Arkash	2014-04-22	When time comes for the Karstark marriage, I'm sure they'll write a wildling character and tribe/family/name for the deed. But it wouldnt be before the second half of season 5 I guess.
4024	KellieBom	2014-04-22	I was wondering if someone could help explain what the eyeball thingies were on Joffreys eyes?Â  I wish I knew how to post pictures.Â  They looked like big cookies with an eyeball painted on them.
Â 
Some kind of medieval burial right or something.Â  I would love to know more about it.Â  It strikes me as kind of Egyptian, those guys were serious about their dead kings.
4025	CharleInWesteros	2014-04-22	Its certainly some sort of funeral ritual that appears to exclusively relate to the Faith of the Seven. I remember they had the same thing for Jon Arryn during his funeral in episode 1, season 1. I do not know what the significance is, but I can only speculate that it must have some sort of symbolic significance where the rocks allow the dead persons 'eyes' to be wide open to find heaven - or something of the sort. I really do not know, I can only hypothesise.Â 
Â 
I know the silent sisters are the ones who typically take care of funeral preparations and they swore oaths of silence and chastity to the 'Stranger' aspect of the Seven. Since the Stranger represents death and the unknown... I can only assume that the 'rock eyes' are there to help guide the dead into the unknown (ie heaven) and to 'see the way clearly'.
Â 
Those are my thoughts on the subject.
4026	MsLibby	2014-04-20	Why is it that all the other Lannisters are portrayed in a more kindly fashion on the show than they are in the books with the exception of Jaime.
Â 
Why do this to his character?
Â 
Is it because the audience was starting to like him? Or is it that the show runners know the ending and they want his redemption ark to be that much bigger.
Â 
I can't figure this out.
Â 
Suggestions?
Â 
Â
4027	DreamSongs	2014-04-20	I really hated how they portrayed Jaime in this episode. Â They made that sept scene suggestive of being something less than consensual.

Â 
It was straight-up rape as far as I could tell. Maybe there will be some post-ep interviews that suggest something different, but right now I find it hard to see it as anything else.
4029	FNF	2014-04-20	I really hated how they portrayed Jaime in this episode. Â They made that sept scene suggestive of being something less than consensual.


I haven't read aSoS in a while, but didn't Cersei initially try to get Jaimie to stop because she was on her period?

4030	MsLibby	2014-04-20	I keep telling myself that the writers and directors know stuff that we don't. That's the only way I hope to explain this to myself.
Â 
Of all things that Jaime did in the books, taking a stand against rape was one that impressed me the most.
4031	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-20	Yeah, playing the scene out that way was just distasteful. Granted, the book's version wasn't much more pleasant, but for Christ sake.
Â 
What other needless deviations need to be made to undo what little good he's achieved in the show so far? Kinslayi- oh, no, wait...

4033	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	It's like the rape is the worst Jaime has done. Because pushing an innocent kind from a window and fucking his own sister was ok, apparently.

Rape is worse than fucking your sister. The point however is that Jaime was on an upswing he's supposed to be redeeming himself inch by inch. Rape now sets him back again for no reason.
4036	FNF	2014-04-20	Â She did try a bit to get him to stop but I never thought the scene was rape. it was forcfull yes, but not rape.


The thing is, although Cersei does say stop a lot in this scene, she was still kissing him back so I don't see a problem with it personally. It just seemed like rough[er] sex like it was in the books...
4037	VeturKemur	2014-04-20	Pretty sure the Unsullied think something bad personally happening to Cersei is long overdue so rapey-looking sex it is...

Nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters, so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal. And it was very much about the earlier part with Charles (Dance) and the gentle verbal kidnapping of Cersei's last living son. Nikolaj came in and we just went through one physical progression and digression of what they went through, but also how to do it with only one hand, because it was Nikolaj. By the time you do that and you walk through it, the actors feel comfortable going home to think about it. The only other thing I did was that ordinarily, you rehearse the night before, and I wanted to rehearse that scene four days before, so that we could think about everything.

Raping your grieving sister is far worse than just fucking her consensually.Â

My thoughts too. It's like when they had him murder his cousin in Season 2 when that didn't happen all, though at least that was a means to an end.

Â 
Is rape worst than pushing a kid to his death BECAUSE you were fucking your sister?
Â 
Really, IN BOOK he fucked his sister NEXT to his dead son's body INSIDE a Sept AFTER he meet Brienne and started his "path to redemption". He was still quite a disgusting man.

I think for non-book readers though, the only way to interpret that is rape. Without the benefit of the book's description of how it goes down, it's just Jaime forcing himself on a Cersei yelling "no" and "stop"

This is completely far off.Â

Cersei told him not here and he forced a kiss on her at worst.Â

No it's not, which is why he needs redemption. Good guys don't need redemption.
Yeah in the books he was still morally grey and in love with Cersei. But it's one thing to be disgusting, and another to be a rapist...again....Rape.

4053	Darth Pipes	2014-04-20	It was such a weird scene.Â  It's clearly not consensual, then Ceresi starts kissing him in return and then it returns to nonconsensual.Â  When D and D stick to the book scenes with Jaime, they do great.Â  When they decided to go into business for themselves, you have Jaime kinslaying and raping.Â

Â 
This. If it was meant to come across as consensual, it most certainly did not work with Cersei saying "no, no, no it's not right". And Cersei didn't look exactly like she was enjoying herself either. I'm starting to question LH's acting, too, she's so hammy and and dreadful. If it was meant to be consensual, she certainly did not act like it.
4056	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	Rape in real life = awful. No one should NEVER under ANY circumstance, defend it.
Rape in fiction = symbolic act related to power. No one real was harmed.

And why don't we have a thread saying "Why do they treat the Thenns that way"? Because what they did was also awkward and uncomfortable to watch. Didn't GRRM himself say that people was always offended by sex but not the violence and gore?

4059	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-04-20	In the books Jaime just got back to KL, he didn't previously get rejected by Cersei as he was in the show. That's why that scene is more rape-like in the show.

Yeah, D and D managed to screw up the portrayal of one of the show's most fascinating characters.Â  When you have a bunch of people thinking one of your character's is a rapist when he's not in the books, you've created a problem.Â  This is why D and D can't be left alone with stuff like this.

I'd say it has a lot to do with us being very far removed from real life violence, and the violence being something easy to separate from (had it been more graphic or traumatic, you'd see SOME backlash). While rape is very real for a lot of people and it's an invasion of our self that illicits a response.
If I had to guess though.
4066	Ran	2014-04-20	My review, with some thoughts on the scene.I have been rewatching that scene quite a bit over the weeks. There's four points I would note:1) As they're slipping down to their knees, it's fairly clear that she actively kisses him back, grabbing at his face... and then pushing him away. But the camera is playing tricks here: when she's kissing back, it suddenly dips down to sort-of-but-not-really obscure, and next its focused on Jaime's hands...2) ... but at the same time, it sure _looks_ like her hands are fumbling around his waist area too.3) The final shot of her hand clenching at the cloth is pretty standard iconography in film and television to indicate passionate lovemaking.4) Taking it to the books, when Bran witnesses Jaime and Cersei having sex, and then again when Jaime has sex with her on his return from King's Landing, Cersei protests... and then gives in. The main difference in this scene as compared to the novels is that Cersei both appears to give in and at the same time continues protesting. It makes it all more ambiguous, and I think this all ties to the changes they've made to Cersei's character on the show.

There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her, only hunger. ...Â  "no," she said weakly ...Â  "the septons...."
Â 
"The Others can take the Septons."Â  He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned.Â  ...
Â 
"Hurry, " she was whispering now, "quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now." ....

Â 
Tumblr's usual bullshit aside, I totally get why they're pissed about this. It was a pretty off misreading of its book counterpart (if they were going for any sort of faithfulness) and it certainly didn't translate the way the director wanted. It played out like straight up attempted rape, and probably more so to your average viewer.

So disappointing. It followed the best scene in the episode too IMO.

4073	Trebla	2014-04-20	The moral of the story in this episode is that it really sucks to be a woman in medieval times. Tywin practically ran off with Cersei's only surviving son and her twin brother/lover forced himself on her. Was it rape? In today's world, yes. In Westeros? Ehhh...

Is it a misreading of the book?The AV Club makes a pretty good point. http://www.avclub.co...r-chains-203634 That scene in the book is Jaime's POV, not Cersei's. You could wonder if he's a reliable narrator there.

Â 
If you read the whole thing he isn't that sure himself, he's just suggesting that maybe that's the case. He also says the show tends to use rape as plot device.
Â 
It does seem to be all a ploy to make Cersei even more of a tragic character. Only I wish it wasn't at the expenses of Jaime.
4078	The Lady Leela	2014-04-20	Yeah, this was... not cool. I mean, the show has always been awful in its gratuitous violence towards women, but this is just... I'm speechless.
Â 
Somebody get Sansa away from Littlefinger, like, RIGHT NOW.
4079	Le Cygne	2014-04-20	That was pretty awful. How did they mess that great scene up. But they did. Very disappointed.I didn't recognize most of the characters this episode. It's like they wanted to make everyone look bad except Tyrion (as usual, he came off saintly).
4080	pantouflas	2014-04-20	I thought it was a great scene unlike in the book where it was in give me a break land.

Exactly! It was porn writing at best - I'm sorry book purists but it was cringing. An old man's (or 15-year old's) idea of what 'slutty women' would do. Bleh. At least the show was a bit more believable...
4081	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-20	Is it a misreading of the book?The AV Club makes a pretty good point. http://www.avclub.co...r-chains-203634 That scene in the book is Jaime's POV, not Cersei's. You could wonder if he's a reliable narrator there.


Â 
I'm sure it would've played out a little differently from Cersei's POV, but that's the thing: what took the book's tryst out of "r word" territory was something that wasn't bound to either of their POVs. It was down to Cersei's very verbal, very explicit encouragement. Jaime's forceful with her at first, but she relents, really gets into it, and they have passionate sex.
Â 
Here, she tells him to get off. And again. And again. And again. And again. And then "I don't care" as he sticks it in. It made for a pretty big difference of mood and one I don't think was necessary to change. It makes Jaime look bloody awful and Cersei look subdued, which is... sadly in character for both of them.

Â 
She does start kissing Jaime back in earnest but once it gets to the floor it becomes nonconsensual again.
Â 
It's these kind of decisions that make me nervous once the show passes the books and more of his story is what D and D make of it.
4084	ServantOnIce	2014-04-20	Director Alex Graves on the scene, via Hitfix:
Â 


So it was rape! Â You try that with a woman in the U.S. and unless you are an athlete or Charlie Sheen you are going to the slammer.Â

Â 
I am going to continue watching the show for my friends and our Sunday evening ritual. But the quality of the directing, acting, pretty much everything has been in free fall since the second season began. You can compare the acting of Joffrey/Littlefinger/Tyrion from the first season and directly see how forced it became later on.

4090	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-20	Forceful sex doesn't equal rape, and she was kissing him the entire time. I mean come on, calling this rape is just stupid. It's Jaime and Cersei. Their love has always been vicious.

I am a Republican I respect Dany and Stannis. We respect power and strict old laws. . . Â  Â  :| Â  Â  Now Bill Maher is supporting Tommen, Madge Tyrell and Obama is a big Littlefinger fan. Â
4092	Ran	2014-04-20	Well, to be utterly honest, I think it's clear quite a bit of the dialogue is ADRed...So I suppose what we may have is that Headey and Coster-Waldau played it as becoming consensual by the end, but then D&D looked at it and decided they wanted it to be more ambiguous/troubling and so added some stuff.
4093	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-20	Jaime "raping" Cersei is going to be the show equivalent of Dany crucifying Slavers in the books.
Â 
Personally, I saw worst things in this episode than that, tbh.
4094	VeturKemur	2014-04-20	The preview for the next episode has her asking him if he'd bring Sansa's head for her, so if it's seen rape, it will show she doesn't care anyway.

Â 
And to all people saying 'it's Cersei & Jaime so it's fine': What are you talking about? Because she enjoyed consensual sex with him, she must be ok with being forced too? Seriously?

4106	FalseKnight	2014-04-20	My review, with some thoughts on the scene.
I have been rewatching that scene quite a bit over the weeks. There's four points I would note:
1) As they're slipping down to their knees, it's fairly clear that she actively kisses him back, grabbing at his face... and then pushing him away. But the camera is playing tricks here: when she's kissing back, it suddenly dips down to sort-of-but-not-really obscure, and next its focused on Jaime's hands...
2) ... but at the same time, it sure _looks_ like her hands are fumbling around his waist area too.
3) The final shot of her hand clenching at the cloth is pretty standard iconography in film and television to indicate passionate lovemaking.
4) Taking it to the books, when Bran witnesses Jaime and Cersei having sex, and then again when Jaime has sex with her on his return from King's Landing, Cersei protests... and then gives in. The main difference in this scene as compared to the novels is that Cersei both appears to give in and at the same time continues protesting. It makes it all more ambiguous, and I think this all ties to the changes they've made to Cersei's character on the show.
She clearly said no repeatedly. Also she basically broke up with him in 3x01. He needs explicit and unambiguous consent, and you shouldn't defend him.

Â 
As I said, when they let Jaime's scenes play out like they did in the books, it's been great.Â  Think his confession scene with Brienne.Â  But when they go into business for themselves, you get Jaime murdering his cousin and this glorified rape scene.Â  It's stuff like this thatÂ gets me very worried whenÂ the show eventually overtakes the books.Â  I don't trust D and D with doing mostly original stuff based on whatever outline GRRM gave them.Â

4112	Darth Pipes	2014-04-20	I hope so.Â  PeterÂ Dinklage is more than capable of pulling it off.Â  He still is doing amazing work playing a character whoÂ has become so sanitized thatÂ his every action is predictable.Â
4113	Ladywhiskers	2014-04-20	They just ruined the show. It's one thing to have Drogo be rapey. It's his culture and he doesn't know yet that he might love this woman.
Â 
But it's completely out of character for Jaime to rape Cersei, and it's completely unnecessary, too. He doesn't care that "it's not right." That's cool. But he HAS to care if she says no, or he's just a rapist molesting his sister. The whole moral ambiguity about the Lannister twins was that their love for one another was real and mutual and non-coercive, and therefore moral judgements on it had to be just about the infidelity, and the incest itself. Now he's just a guy who abuses his sister, and there's no ambiguity left.
Â 
Nice job, idiots. I get that a lot of men don't understand what rape is, and that they don't understand that if she's yelling no, that means no, and that they don't get that women really don't change their minds halfway through, either. So? Have a woman direct the scene, if you can't figure out the difference between passionate sex and rape. Those POOR actors! One minute they're in the hottest show on HBO, and the next, they're in a turkey even their biggest fans don't reallly like, all because of one nit-witted director.
Â 
Why couldn't they just do what it says in the books? It's uncomfortable enough, with the corpse there. What were they thinking? Why did they have to make it rape? Whose real-life relationship were they copying, that they thought would be so much better?

4114	Ran	2014-04-20	She clearly said no repeatedly.What she says and what she does can be two different things. As I noted up-thread, the director indicates that the intention of the scene at the end was that it was consensual, and that's how it was rehearsed and choreographed. And as one can come to that conclusion just from watching carefully, I suppose it works, more or less, though of course it raises questions about how various changes they've made to the character has left her with less agency than she had in the novels.

4116	Faint	2014-04-20	I can see the argument being made that the scene somewhat tarnishes Cersei's character because it changes the dynamics of her relationship with her brother, but this idea that it ruins Jaime because it serves as some kind of moral event horizon is quite simply preposterous.Â  If there was ever such a moment, it was when he flung an innocent child off a tower.Â  There is nowhere lower to sink to; Jaime is already there.
4117	snowy	2014-04-20	If what y'all are saying is true, it bothers me more that they are giving Cersei something resemblng sexual scruples.

Quoting this just because it really bears repeating.
Â 
Some of the stuff I'm seeing people post online -- not necessarily or exclusively in this thread or board, but in general -- is illustrative of a lot of huge issues I have with society in general and is making me very, very mad.. so I need to just back off the message boards for a little bit.
4119	Faint	2014-04-20	I can appreciate that the director had a specific intention for how the the scene should be appreciated but a quick perusal of Twitter and the multitude of episode recaps are demonstration enough that he utterly failed.
4120	Brandon Ottinger	2014-04-20	This is a complete screw up on the part of the show writers. Â They played the scene between Jaime and Cersei out to be a rape to gain more sympathy for Cersei as a character. Â This is totally going against the books and if they want to claim they didn't try to portray it that way it's not that hard. Â Just insert these lines from the book

Â Yeah....

Thank you for the quote! Changing 'do it' into 'stop it' definitely changes consensual sex scene into rape scene. No question there. And if the directors wanted it to seem consensual, why change this!!!
Â 

But it's completely out of character for Jaime to rape Cersei, and it's completely unnecessary, too. He doesn't care that "it's not right." That's cool. But he HAS to care if she says no, or he's just a rapist molesting his sister. The whole moral ambiguity about the Lannister twins was that their love for one another was real and mutual and non-coercive, and therefore moral judgements on it had to be just about the infidelity, and the incest itself. Now he's just a guy who abuses his sister, and there's no ambiguity left.

I could not agree with you more, his appreciation and love for his sister, and his faithfulness were his only redeeming qualities before his 'redemption' arc.

GRRM writes such wonderful, grey characters but the show either whitewashes or blackwashes all of them.

4124	Eponine	2014-04-20	What she says and what she does can be two different things.
I've never been so disappointed in the board and its leadership, insofar as you, Ran, are the representative of it.
you have a woman saying no, saying this is wrong, but because her hand is clutching at the man, that means yes? 
I can certainly understand a defense of the scene as a poor writing/editing decision and poor cutting of the scene, rather than a deliberate decision to make Jaime a rapist, but to try to convince all the people who heard a person saying no, and believing that no mean no, that, oh but her body is saying yes if you look really closely, that is disappointing and not what I expected here.

4125	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-20	The director thinks it was consensual by the end? That's genuinely disturbing. She's struggling beneath him and saying, "No." That's the only word that matters. Do we have to go over this? No means no, for Pete's sake. As if it's alright to force yourself on women because it might become consensual by the end. Was this guy raised in Westeros?
4126	greensleeves	2014-04-20	The show has issues with the portrayal of women and violence towards them. Â HBO desperately needs to get someone in there to keep them in check. Â

4127	Darth Pipes	2014-04-20	Jaime essentially treated Cersei the way Robert did and that's wrong.
4128	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-20	Jaime the twincest raping arsehole...anything to keep Cersei a white character. Didn't kill the Bastards, nah was totes Joff! Think the evilest thing she's done was remind Robert that they have Lady in the camp.
4129	Oakenfist	2014-04-20	Most people are perceiving it as rape. I even thought it was rape.
Â 
So if the showrunners didn't want to present it that way, but it came off like that in the episode then that's a huge failure on their part. Jaime the Kingslayer, Jaime the Rapist.
4130	Rickeen Stark	2014-04-20	Ugh. Ugh. Ugh! This really, really annoys me! I don't even know where to begin...
Â 
Taking one of the qualities away from Jaime that made him, at least a little bit, respectable throughout everything; his undying love for Cersei. ( Yes she is his sister, he loves her and you don't choose who you love ect... ) To have him rape her was both disturbing to watch and, just generally made me feel down. It is pure character assassination while Tyrion is being made out to be so noble; while he is the rapist... they're just shifting the blame away from Tyrion and it frustrates me.
Â 
If they didn't mean for it to come across as rape, they did a poor job. A very, very poor job.

Â 
Â 
How about we quote the entire scene, and not cherrypick bits so we get a good idea of what actually happened;
Â 

There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her, only hunger. Her mouth opened for his tongue. â<U+0080><U+009C>No,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck, â<U+0080><U+009C>not here. The septons . . .â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>The Others can take the septons.â<U+0080><U+009D> He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Motherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath. She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes. When he tore them away, he saw that her moonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blood was on her, but it made no difference.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Hurry,â<U+0080><U+009D> she was whispering now, â<U+0080><U+009C>quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime.â<U+0080><U+009D> Her hands helped guide him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D>

Jaime lost himself in her flesh. He could feel Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heart beating in time with his own, and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined.
But no sooner were they done than the queen said, â<U+0080><U+009C>Let me up. If we are discovered like this . . .â<U+0080><U+009D>
Reluctantly he rolled away and helped her off the altar. The pale marble was smeared with blood. Jaime wiped it clean with his sleeve, then bent to pick up the candles he had knocked over. Fortunately they had all gone out when they fell. If the sept had caught fire I might never have noticed.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>This was folly.â<U+0080><U+009D> Cersei pulled her gown straight.
Â 

Â 
Sorry, but I cannot see how this wasn't rape.
Â 
Cersei did not want to have sex. She said no, she pleaded to him not to. She attempted to resist him physically.
Â 
When that failed, she didn't consent to the sex, she tried to speed up the sex. She knew at that point she couldn't stop him, and she just wanted it to be over, and to minimise the risk of them being caught.
Â 
If you ever doubt that fact, look at what she says once it's over. "This was folly". She didn't want to have the sex, before or after it occured.

4134	go joff go	2014-04-20	I can't believe people are more mad about the show portrayal than the books, in the book she gets raped but enjoys it but in the show she doesn't enjoy it, and the latter is the one who gets demonized?
4135	CarCrashFiance	2014-04-20	I've never been so disappointed in the board and its leadership, insofar as you, Ran, are the representative of it.
you have a woman saying no, saying this is wrong, but because her hand is clutching at the man, that means yes?
I can certainly understand a defense of the scene as a poor writing/editing decision and poor cutting of the scene, rather than a deliberate decision to make Jaime a rapist, but to try to convince all the people who heard a person saying no, and believing that no mean no, that, oh but her body is saying yes if you look really closely, that is disappointing and not what I expected here.


How anyone can watch that scene and not think it is a rape scene is ridiculous. The book scene is extremely clear that both Jaime and Cersei are so in lust that they literally cannot contain their passion. They have sex in a public place, in a holy sept, and in front of the corpse of their dead King-Son. In the books it could not be more obvious that they are emotional from Joffrey's death, from being apart so long, and Cersei living months (years even) of her life thinking that her other half would never be with her again.
Â 
The show had a rape scene from start to finish. "No, no, no". "I don't care". Rape is fine to show on film. The Sopranos and OZ had rape scenes and they were incredible storylines. But this is such a poor change from the books. Maybe they are just making dumb changes like killing pregnant Talisa at the Red Wedding. Trying to add shock value to try to top viewers' reactions from Ned's killing. "Hey we are pushing the boundaries of television" or whatever.
Â 
The show has never had the subtly of the books. I see most of the unpredictable changes like this as being times where the HBO writers didn't know how to subtly do something. Like make Jaime look bad. So they just said "okay let's have him rape someone....how about Cersei?".
4136	Jasta11	2014-04-20	Remember folks: having sex over the body of your dead son-by-incest is only bad if you're a bit too forceful about it.

Â 
Given she's mourning her dead son, and on her period, I'm guessing she didn't enjoy it in the book either.

She didn't want to have sex here. She didn't say she didn't want to have sex at all and she consents beforehand.Â

Â 
Correct, which means Jaime forced her to against her will. Which is rape.
Â 
Just because you may be willing to have consensual sex with a person in different circumstances doesn't make it not rape.
Â 
She didn't say she didn't want to have sex and she consents beforehand.
Â 
Of course she said she didn't want to. She says "no", and afterwards says it was a folly.

Ok, you have a fair point, in the book it was ambiguous instead of clearly consensual. But in the show there is no ambiguity, it's rape.

My friends love Ramsay...well loved him, until they learned his dad was Roose. They didn't quite connect that one until they spelled it out, then he went from glorious hero giving that evil Theon what he deserved to evil Stark killer who should keep torturing Theon.
4151	IlAovatar	2014-04-20	I think they're trying hard to hammer home the point that Jaime is a complex character who doesn't really fit into the good or evil bracket.
Â 
Personally, I would be more irritated if they tried to transform him into a saint from this season onwards. I like that that he still has mixed morals.

Of course it was. Attempting to speed up the sex once you've realised you can't stop it doesn't make it consensual sex.
Â 
Cersei did not want to have sex. She did not want to have sex before or after. That she tried to bring Jaime to orgasm quickly to get it over with does not indicate she consents to the sex, it means she was trying to minimise the pain, misery and danger of a fucked up situation Jaime imposed on her.

Lol can we talk about this for a minute? Â I didn't think it possible for Ramsay to be whitewashed but it looks like they've managed it. Â Not only did they totally eliminated his role in the Bran & Rickon cover-up, but they've also downplayed the nature of his "hunts". Â In the last episode it seems (to me at least) that they were hunting down that girl not because he enjoys raping and murdering women, but because his little girlfriend was jealous her.Â

4160	metr0man	2014-04-20	I suspect the change (though it's not quite as different from the book as people are acting) was more for Cersei's characterization. First Tywin essentially takes away her son, and her influence, now Jaime essentially forces himself on her. Basically underlining how in that patriarchal society no matter what she's done she's still under the thumb of the Lannister men.

Honestly, I don't think that a rape scene, or one that could be perceived as one, is a great way to bring in new viewers. Especially for a show that has a reputation for gratuitous scenes and violence. Rape is different, it is one of the most horrible things someone can have happen to them, especially in in a time and place like Cersei is in that scene. It could very easily turn a lot of current viewers off from the show.
With that said, I am of the opinion that it was not their intent to have it come off like he was raping her. I think they were showing Cersei give in physically while mentally telling herself that it was wrong. Problem is we can't see inside her head, so she is saying that she thinks it's wrong while never saying at some point " Yes Jaime, do me." Like she essentially says in the books. Thus it is very easily interpreted as rape. All they had to do was show Cersei saying " yes baby" once before the scene ended and it just becomes a really fucking weird scene like it was in the book.

4163	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-21	They're both sick bastards and wanted it equally. Only difference is Cersei actually liked Joffrey while Jaime couldn't give a shit, so she felt kinda guilty.

Her mouth opened for his tongue. â<U+0080><U+009C>No,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck, â<U+0080><U+009C>not here.

Â 
Yikes.
4170	The God of Death	2014-04-21	I think that David & Dan wanted to emphasize that Cersei is the one thing Jaime cares about... and how utterly devastating it is for him that their relationship seems to have fallen apart... Whereas it's not as important to Cersei.Â 
Â 
I think this is the show's version of showing that.
Â 
Some may feel it "ruins" Jaime's character... some actually said similar things when show Jaime killed his Lannister cousin in Season 2, which also didn't happen in the book.
Â 
But I for one don't think it was totally out of keeping with Jaime from the book. Yes, Jaime hates rape. Yes, Jaime loves his sister... but Jaime is a complicated character prone to doing things instinctually, and he felt extremely hurt and vulnerable.... so yeah, what happened is not totally out of character for me.
4171	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-21	Maybe there is something wrong with me but I didn't mind a child killing, king stabbing sisterfucker as book Jaime, but show Jaime is now also a kinslaying (remember his Frey cousin) rapist, and I'm not ok with that.
4172	Duckfield	2014-04-21	Cercei kept saying no but she obviously wanted it otherwise why was she kissing him back so much? This wasn't rape, it just shows what a weird relationship they have, and after it just suffered a huge throttle... they're both in a very unstable state, especially Cercei that's why she was saying no all the time but on the other hand seeking his affection and comfort.
I think people just saw it as rape because it wasn't so well directed, and it all happened too quickly...Â
4173	DominusNovus	2014-04-21	How hard would it have been for them to just extend that scene by 15-20 seconds so that they'd have time for a "Yes" line from her, and then a "WTF did we just do?" line?

Â Attempting to speed up the sex once you've realised you can't stop it doesn't make it consensual sex.


Â 
What makes it consensual was that she clearly wanted him. She obviously just didn't want to be caught in the act.
4177	Le Cygne	2014-04-21	D and D said in the Inside the Episode Guide that "Cersei said no and Jaime forces himself on her."Â  GREAT change, guys.... This makes no sense whatsoever, he just got his hand cut off and jumped into a bear pit to save Brienne.
4178	All-for-Joffrey	2014-04-21	Exactly! It was porn writing at best - I'm sorry book purists but it was cringing. An old man's (or 15-year old's) idea of what 'slutty women' would do. Bleh. At least the show was a bit more believable...


Â 
But the issue, at least for me is, that the writers, directors, and producers didn't even realize what they were doing. They filmed a rape scene, pure and simple. Nothing inherently wrong with that as you're right, it's a ridiculous scene in the books (although I wish they had just omitted the scene entirely) but the fact that they somehow think what they filmed is by any means "consensual" is beyond absurd (rape culture, etc, etc). Cersei is expressly saying no the whole time and Jaime forces himself into her. Â 
I thought it was a strange scene watching but I didn't really think twice about it until I read that the director has it in his head that he somehow made a consensual sex scene and not rape.
Â 
Â

OMFG dude! Rape is fucking rape. There are no "variants" of rape like "pure rape" or "unpure rape." I think I have to read this thread now or else I'm going to become really fucking angry.Â 
Cersei said no, multiple times, and did not give consent. That's text book rape. Gripe all you want about how they're changing character dynamics around but don't go around trying to justify rape.Â

So yeah, not really seeing the consensual, unless one also thinks Joan from Mad Men getting raped by her fiancee in Don's office was consensual because she wasn't gouging his eyes out.Â 
Â 
And anyone who says Cersei "deserved" some rapey punishment can fuck off.Â

If there was no part of her that didn't want it, you really think she would be kissing back?

Not saying it wasn'tÂ rape. Â But between two lovers, with her kissing back... I wouldn't call it pure she-didn't-want-it-at-all rape.

Certainly not condoning Jaime's behavior. Â (does this really need to be said? seems so due to the sensitivity of the issue for many people)

4183	James Sucellus	2014-04-21	Of course it was rape. Brutal rape of the woman he loved, when he's supposed to be becoming more honourable.
Â 
Great job, HBO.
4184	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	They just ruined the show. It's one thing to have Drogo be rapey. It's his culture and he doesn't know yet that he might love this woman.
Â 
But it's completely out of character for Jaime to rape Cersei, and it's completely unnecessary, too. He doesn't care that "it's not right." That's cool. But he HAS to care if she says no, or he's just a rapist molesting his sister. The whole moral ambiguity about the Lannister twins was that their love for one another was real and mutual and non-coercive, and therefore moral judgements on it had to be just about the infidelity, and the incest itself. Now he's just a guy who abuses his sister, and there's no ambiguity left.

Nice job, idiots. I get that a lot of men don't understand what rape is, and that they don't understand that if she's yelling no, that means no, and that they don't get that women really don't change their minds halfway through, either. So? Have a woman direct the scene, if you can't figure out the difference between passionate sex and rape. Those POOR actors! One minute they're in the hottest show on HBO, and the next, they're in a turkey even their biggest fans don't reallly like, all because of one nit-witted director.
Â 
Why couldn't they just do what it says in the books? It's uncomfortable enough, with the corpse there. What were they thinking? Why did they have to make it rape? Whose real-life relationship were they copying, that they thought would be so much better?


Â 
Lolwut? Did you just say men don't know what rape is? I find that an incredibly insulting comment, honestly.Â
4185	Bratchild	2014-04-21	To be honest,that scene gave me chills and so not the good kind either!
Â 
I never thought that I would seriously feel pity for Cersei and rage on her part....I always felt that Jaimie idolized his sister as she and Tyrion were the only people that mattered to him and then he does this to her in the scene.
Â 
This scene was a WTF moment for me.

Â 
I don't find it insulting, because I am not someone who takes insults from the broadly defined group of which I am a part.
Â 
For example, I am a man, but take no offense when people say bad things about men. Â I am an American, but take no offense when people say bad things about Americans.
Â 
But the comment this woman made was certainly incredibly ignorant.
4188	ellevt	2014-04-21	Wow. Just wow. I am so unbelievably disappointed and angry at some of you commenting on here!Â 
Â 
Jaime grabs her, forces her to the floor, and rapes her. It is not ambiguous at all.Â 
Â 
She says no repeatedly, tries to push his face away, and DOES NOT GIVE CONSENT.Â 
Â 
What happened in the books is not relevant here- Â the scene as shown is rape.Â 
Â

Â 
I'm male as well, yes, but seriously, the way she said that was like all men just aren't smart enough, and are too callous. It's incredibly insulting to generalize what's probably a very small minority to seemingly most people, like she did.Â
4190	ellevt	2014-04-21	PS there's no such thing as "pure rape" or "forcible rape." Having sex with someone without their consent is rape. Â 
Â 
This shouldn't be that damn hard people
4191	averde	2014-04-21	Rape in real life = awful. No one should NEVER under ANY circumstance, defend it.
Rape in fiction = symbolic act related to power. No one real was harmed.
Â 
And why don't we have a thread saying "Why do they treat the Thenns that way"? Because what they did was also awkward and uncomfortable to watch. Didn't GRRM himself say that people was always offended by sex but not the violence and gore?

I believe rape is rape whether it's fiction or not. Just because it happened to a fake character in a book doesn't make it less bad. Jaime raped Cersei which is a large deviation from the book and changes a serious point of his character. 
I did make a thread about the Thenns when they were introduced in the first episode.
4192	hedgeknight001	2014-04-21	Eh, I don't have any sympathy with either of these characters. Cersei murdered her husband and Jaime tossed a ten-year-old out a window. And they're committing incest. All of which would earn them the death penalty or prison in Westeros. (And prison in ours, for all the above. Incest among adults is a felony in all 50 states.)
So what is a little rape between the two of these loathsome cretins?

4194	Widows_Blood	2014-04-21	D and D said in the Inside the Episode Guide that "Cersei said no and Jaime forces himself on her."Â  GREAT change, guys.... 
Â 
It's possible Graves shot the scene a different way and it was edited a completely different way.Â  Although I raised my eyebrows at Graves saying it was one of his favorite scenes ever to film.


He was referring to the Tywin-Tommen convo not that scene.Â
4195	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-21	Â 
She was kissing back though.
Â 
If there was no part of her that didn't want it, you really think she would be kissing back?
Â 
Not saying it wasn't borderline rape-ish. Â But between two lovers, with her kissing back... I wouldn't call it pure rape.


Â 
*busts out HBO GO* I was pretty hammered 1st watch so I just rewatched the ep when my head was a little more collected. Nah, still rape. She was kissing him at first, clearly grieving and wounded by Tywin's assessment of Joff, then shoved him away. When he pins her against the catafalque there's a brief kiss but she's quickly pushing his mouth away. She's saying no the whole time. In the books she's at first pushing him away (his POV seemed to imply it was a script of sorts), but she was verbally telling him â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes."
Â

Â 
Let's not forget sodomy's a crime in some states too. As is murdering someone while they lie defenseless at your feet at the local pub, even if they're a torturing SOB.Â 
Â 
But I don't see how a crime makes anyone deserve rape.Â 
Â 
Furthermore, it irritated me from a narrative perspective. Jaime in the show has said he'd force his captors to kill him before submitting to rape, and in the books he was disgusted by Aerys' treatment of Rhaella. It doesn't make much narrative sense for a character who's trying to become better to suddenly commit crimes he hasn't before, when he's actively reviled those crimes. Jaime's shown a lack of guilt about things he's done, but he's not a particularly hypocritical character.Â

Cersei said no, multiple times, and did not give consent. 
Â 


Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
There's really only one way to interpret that. Cersei's objections, however, were clearly in relation to where they were at, not that she didn't want him.
Â
4197	James Sucellus	2014-04-21	I dunno which has disturbed me more. The wildly out of character scene in tonight's episode, or posters saying Cersei secretly wanted it.

Â 
Okay okay, direct your hate at me. Â It's cool and all.
Â 
Look, Jaime raped her. Â 
Â 
In the court of law, it's DEFINITELY a rape. Â If Cersei pressed charges and I was on the jury, I'm calling that RAPE all day long.
Â 
I was merely pointing out that in my opinion there was part of Cersei that wanted it... perhaps I am at least in part jumping to that conclusion because I read the books, and because I feel strongly that this is what David & Dan and Alex GravesÂ intended to have happen... and also part of it based on the fact that Cersei was kissing back.
Â 
I know you feel that my opinion seems like that of someone who would "justify rape" in the real world... very sorry for giving that horrible impression. Â In a real world scenario I would never have this sort of take on it (I would take far more seriously... obviously no means no!). Â But in the context of this story, that's how I saw it.
4201	Stark11	2014-04-21	Ever hear of an anger bang? Also it doesn't help that they cut out, I mean 10 seconds later Cersei might be loving it.
I'd say wait till next weeks episode for it to be cleared up, there's no way they can't mention it.

Out-of-character? These two are completely morally bankrupt in virtually every way. They're narcissistic, flouting what are apparently the most fundamental laws of gods and men in the land, murderous villains. No immoral act they carry-out is out-of-character.
And Cersei wanted it. Enough, at least. She was kissing him back, holding his head in her hand, fumbling around at his belt. Once he's inside, it's a done deal. There isn't a court in Westeros that would convict. 
Besides: who cares. Cersei should have her throat slit anyway. Jaime too.
4203	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	I usually defend the changes, but that sure as fuck came off as rapey.
4204	Faint	2014-04-21	Regarding the next episode, my thinking is that Cersei will tempt Jaime with sex to do her bidding regarding Sansa, which will undoubtedly backfire.Â  It will be the equivalent of Jaime's last point-of-view chapter in A Storm of Swords.

In the book, she said 'no' because she was worried they'd get caught, but then she goes on to literally tell him several times "do me, do me now." That can't be misinterpreted.
But yes, in the show, it's definitely rape.
4208	danm_999	2014-04-21	Â 
What makes it consensual was that she clearly wanted him. She obviously just didn't want to be caught in the act.


Â 
We go back to the pretty basic point; it's still rape if you force someone to have sex, even if they'd have sex with you in different circumstances.
4209	The Human Abstract	2014-04-21	Â 




The book scene was rape, and so was the show scene. As soon as she said "no" in the book, and Jaime continued, it was rape.


Â 
That's nonsense. Â 
Â 
I'm sure this comes from the good-hearted "no means no" rape awareness campaign we were all subjected to as first year college students. Â But it's crap. Â If my wife fondles me and I see "No. Â I'm making dinner" and she persists more forcibly and then I get turned on and give in I was not raped. Â Sorry. Â Â

My thoughts exactly. I thought we would be well into the redemption arc for Jaime at this point in the series. So why set that back by showing this form of douchery?

Yeah I'm not sure I see the need to do this. Jaime was becoming a character with flaws, but who was trying to do better. It's pretty fundamental to his character.
4212	Faint	2014-04-21	Before this thread gets locked, it might be of passing interest to know that the director himself categorizes the scene as rape.Â I've quoted the relevant passages for those too lazy to read the whole interview:Â It was directorial crack to do that scene. It was one of my favorite scenes I've ever shot. It's almost like a build from Ordinary People meets a Hitchcock movie, because you're sitting here going "this is so dysfunctional and bizarre." She's a wreck. Tywin is really going on about this historical stuff, and you slowly start to go "he's kidnapping her only boy," because she's not going to have him anymore. And then he succeeds, and then Jaime comes in and he rapes her. That was like  you read the scene and go "Wait, who's directing this?"Â (...)I'm never that excited about going to film forced sex. But the whole thing for me was about dead Joffrey lying there, watching the whole thing. (Showrunners) David (Benioff) and Dan (Weiss) loved that, and I was like, I wanted to make sure I had Jack in there as much as I could. Of course Lena and Nickola laughed every time I would say "You grab her by the hair, and Jack is right there," or "you come around this way and Jack is right there."If that does not settle the issue, then nothing will.

4216	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	I came to this forum expecting outrage among fans at the gratuitous butchery of one of the story's greatest characters. What I didn't expect to encounter was justification for why ripping a woman's clothes off, shoving her to the floor, and forcibly penetrating her body while she says "no" and struggles against him isn't rape. I'm shocked. I guess the reaction to this scene is smoking out the creeps everywhere.
HBO is already spinning it as "controversial." I can't decide what's worse - them having a major protagonist rape his sister - in total violation of the consent which makes their relationship morally ambiguous and his own personal code - or them denying that it's rape.
D&D claim to be fans, but actions speak louder than words. They ruthlessly betray the source material in ways which have nothing to do with adapting/condensing a story from one medium to another. Up until now, it's been mostly just bad storytelling - i.e. the Talisa fiasco, confusion over what happened at Winterfell (I have Unsullied in my family who still don't understand who burned it) - but this is an atrocity against a character. Now Stannis has company.

Â 
It's not me who needs to do that. This is a straight up rape.
Â 

Â 
There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her, only hunger. Her mouth opened for his tongue. â<U+0080><U+009C>No,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck, â<U+0080><U+009C>not here. The septons . . .â<U+0080><U+009D>

â<U+0080><U+009C>The Others can take the septons.â<U+0080><U+009D> He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Motherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath. She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes. When he tore them away, he saw that her moonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blood was on her, but it made no difference.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Hurry,â<U+0080><U+009D> she was whispering now, â<U+0080><U+009C>quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime.â<U+0080><U+009D> Her hands helped guide him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D>
Cersei said as he thrust, â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home.â<U+0080><U+009D> She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair. Jaime lost himself in her flesh. He could feel Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heart beating in time with his own, and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined.
Â 
But no sooner were they done than the queen said, â<U+0080><U+009C>Let me up. If we are discovered like this . . .â<U+0080><U+009D>
Reluctantly he rolled away and helped her off the altar. The pale marble was smeared with blood. Jaime wiped it clean with his sleeve, then bent to pick up the candles he had knocked over. Fortunately they had all gone out when they fell. If the sept had caught fire I might never have noticed.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>This was folly.â<U+0080><U+009D> Cersei pulled her gown straight.

Â 
She doesn't want to have sex. She tells him no. She tells him they can't do it there. She tries to resist him physically. When she realises she can't stop him, she tries to get it over with quickly.
Â 
Then she tells him immediatly afterwards he shouldn't have.
Â 
It's a textbook rape. All you're doing now is spouting some classic rape defences like "she wanted it".

Mmhmm. This is my opinion on the subject. The whole scene regardless of book or show, is hella uncomfortable to begin with. Its also showing complexity for Cersei's character.

I can understand that many arguments come down to a disagreement of terms. Â In this case, you might be arguing that any resistance during foreplay is treading dangerous territory when it comes to consent.

This isn't "complexity," it's just controversy. There's nothing "complex" about rape. It's a wicked, violent, degrading act, and something Jaime would never do to Cersei, whom he loves deeply. Jaime already has plenty of "complexity" without HBO making him rape his sister.

She is very obviously sexually excited in the text and there is no justification for your argument that she realizes she can't stop him and helplessly just tries to get it over with.

Â 
Of course there is. You think she's telling him to be quick and hurry up because that's what sexually excites her?
Â 
In your experience do women generally enjoy their sex super quick, with no foreplay or anything? Do they generally enjoy it while they're having their period, which can be extremely painful anyway? Do they immediatly demand to be let up and tell you that you should not have done that after you've cum?
Â 
She's trying to get him off ASAP because she's in grief, because it's probably hurting her, and because they're in danger of being caught if Jaime's rape session goes on too long. Reading that scene any other way is borderline sociopathic to me.

4228	The Human Abstract	2014-04-21	Yes, how dare HBO impinge the honor of Jaime Lannister, that great warrior virtue!Â  He might fling innocent children off towers and catapult newborns into castle walls, but he would never rape Cersei!


Â 
It's not just that it's out of character for Jaime, which it is. Â It's not just that is makes his character less faceted and interesting, which it does. Â 
Â 
It's that it's a boring decision. Â It seems like yet another one geared more about the show's next shocking moment rather than it's potentially interesting characters. Â It adds nothing. Â
4229	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-21	Â 
LOL.
Â 
Is there anything "complex" about defenestration?
Â 
Defenestration is bad. Â Rape is bad.
Â 
But that doesn't mean that complex people don't do both good and bad things.


Â 
and Jaime was like: I'm not killing Tyrion m'kay, Kinslaying is bad, m'kay.

Has it occurred to you that readers not getting the book scene actually is rape too is why they made the decision?

This whole narrative you've created here is laughable. Â You've tried desperately to re-write the exchange to seem like rape. Â It was over so quick, and she was on her period, and there was short foreplay! Â 
Â 
And I love the backstory you've created involving Cersei's psychology, despite not a shred of evidence to support it in the actual text. Â 
Â 
edit: Btw, loved the ad hominem argument that NOT reading that scene as rape makes me a sociopath. Â There are apparently scores of us here and all over the internet!

Â 
My honest reading of the situation is that it is a minor thing in the grand scheme of things.Â  The manner in which Lena Headey has portrayed Cersei from the very beginning of the series, whether on her own instincts or due to changes Benioff and Weiss decided to make to the character, or both, is a far bigger departure from the books and has had much greater consequences than a two minute scene from a forgettable episode is likely to.

Â 
That's fair. Â
4234	lezboyd	2014-04-21	GRRM writes "complexity" by putting characters in tough circumstances and forcing them to make challenging choices. Some good, some bad, some that are ambiguous.
This isn't "complexity," it's just controversy. There's nothing "complex" about rape. It's a wicked, violent, degrading act, and something Jaime would never do to Cersei, whom he loves deeply. Jaime already has plenty of "complexity" without HBO making him rape his sister.


Â 
Agreed. There were plenty of ways to show "complexity" in Jaime's character without having him downright rape his sister in a Sept in front of her dead son. This was just done for controversy's sake.

Â 
I don't see it as being out of character for Jaime.
Â 
It would have been very out of character for me if Jaime had sex with someone other than Cersei.
Â 
But I don't see him taking Cersei by force in that moment as out of character. Â He was telling himself that Cersei is still his. Â In Jaime's mind it wasn't rape.

Agreed. There were plenty of ways to show "complexity" in Jaime's character without having him downright rape his sister in a Sept in front of her dead son. This was just done for controversy's sake.


Â 
I disagree. Â 
Â 
I don't think David & Dan are even remotely close to as stupid as most book reading fans like to make them out to be.
Â 
They know that sex in front of the body of their dead son would have been "controversial" enough on its own.
Â 
Them writing the scene this way is clearly a choice on their part to remind us that Jaime isn't the pure hero.

Â 
I'm sorry, if you're arguing she really "wanted it" (which again, classic rape defence line), pretending Cersei actually likes it this way (after she's said no, physically resisted him, on the bier of her son's corpse, when she's on her period, in public where she can get caught), that's kind of delusion to the extreme. She didn't want to have sex. She said no. Left to her druthers, she and Jaime would not have had sex. She immediatly told him it was wrong of him to do that to her once it was done.
Â 
That's rape. I don't need to re-write a damn thing.
Â 

And I love the backstory you've created involving Cersei's psychology, despite not a shred of evidence to support it in the actual text.
Â 

Â 
Hell, we already know this is a tactic Cersei employed on Robert when he forced himself on her. She even tried sometimes to jerk/suck him off to avoid the sex. It's a pattern she's all too familiar with unfortunately.

Â 


Â 
I am absolutely arguing that she really "wanted it". Â I think the story makes it clear. Â Â 
As I said earlier, if your argument is: Â "aggressively initiating sex, being resisted, and trying again is rape" than -- while I don't necessarily agree -- I at least find that not a very tractable position. Â THAT particular argument could fill books. Â 
But you said a bunch of things that were clearly not true. Â You said that Cersei was never turned on and only trying to get it over with as quickly as possible. Â You claimed that at no point in the exchange did she ever desire sex with Jaime or consent. Â The text very obviously contradicts these claims. Â
4240	Itchyscratch	2014-04-21	Not trying to be pedantic, but Cersei doesn't actually say the word 'no' in that scene. She says Not Here Please, she says This Isn't Right, she says Stop It, she says It's Not Right but for all those claiming that she said No repeatedly, you're wrong. 
And who invented the word 'rapey'? Nobody over the age of 12 I'm betting.
4241	gvewolf243	2014-04-21	Now my Unsullied friends call Jaime a rapist. Well, he is kinslayer in the show also. While Tyrion is almost Ned Stark 2.0 . Good job, lol.

Lol yeah, he should be thankful he isn't on these forums.
4251	Sapphire Isle	2014-04-21	I woke up, I saw tumblr exploding with discontent, was kind of hoping they were just overexaggerating the issue, then I watched the episode.
Â 
Nope. They're right. This is rape. Violent and sudden and nonconsensual and also, a confusion adaptation to make.
Â 
At no point Cersei was shown giving consent. At no point she was saying yes or showing by conduct her consent in any manner. She was fighting it, she was screaming no.
Â 
F-ck this. This was not even how it went down in the books. Books: consensual version.

Yeah unlike the ones that say "wait till episode 9, Stannis will be good then," they really don't have an excuse here. Jaime is already meant to be in his redemption arc. This bullshit set him back so far. It's gonna be so inconsistent when he is suddenly all morally righteous when sending Brienne on her quest next episode.

Â 
There are many people like this in real life. Â Some of the greatest characters in literature are like this. Â 

Of course there are, but rape is such a severe and dark action that it's kind of jarring and weird to then see the character be all of a sudden 'good'. Lesser bad actions than rape, okay then, I can see past that, but something this bad casts a permanent shadow over the character.
4261	CarCrashFiance	2014-04-21	Â 
No she doesn't. Go re-read the scene.
Â 
She tells him no beforehand, she pleads and begs with him not to do it, she tries resisting him physically, then when she sees there's no way to stop it, she tells him to hurry and be quick about it.
Â 
Then, when it's over, she immediatly tells him he shouldn't have done that.
Â 
It's rape.


Â 
You're so off base it is insane. Delusional. Pathetic. If it was rape in the books then point out a single moment in ANY of Cersei's POV chapters where she thinks it was rape even once. It's not like we are blind to Cersei's thoughts during AFFC and even ADWD. She thinks many things about Jaime in those books. Never once that he raped her.
Â 
You think that her being raped by her other half, her twin, the man she desperately writes to come save her....would be something that she'd think about...AT LEAST ONCE. But she never does. How can you claim she was raped if she never even thinks that thought even in passing?
Â 
This is how fans figured out that Cersei didn't send Ser Mandon to kill Tyrion. She never once thinks it in any of her POV chapters. When almost every chapter she's going insane over Tyrion and plotting his death. She never once thinks "if only Ser Mandon had done his job". They all but confirmed that on the HBO show when Tyrion asks her and she and Tyrion figure it was Joffrey.
Â 
There are lots of things in the books that are ambiguous. This is certainly not one of them.
Â 

Â
4262	T.C	2014-04-21	In the book, she said 'no' because she was worried they'd get caught, but then she goes on to literally tell him several times "do me, do me now." That can't be misinterpreted.
But yes, in the show, it's definitely rape.


Didn't she say no because she was on her period?
4263	The God of Death	2014-04-21	I have to log off, but here are my concluding thoughts on this whole scene...
Â 
-Yes, Jaime rapes Cersei.
-Part of Cersei did want it. Â (this doesn't make it any less of a rape).
-Yes, this is a departure from the books.
-I do not believe this is "out of character" for Jaime. Â Cersei is his everything, and he felt devastated that Cersei had been rejecting him upon his return to King's Landing (something Jaime did not have to deal with in the book, because they have sex right away). Â In Jaime's mind, he wasn't raping her (even though he was).
-I do not believe that this "ruins his redemption arc". Â The most interesting, complex characters in literature do good and bad things. Â I see no contradiction in Jaime's character developing, but still being prone to doing something that is "bad". Â 
-I am not saying I prefer the show's version to the book's version. Â I am simply saying that I understand it, and it will be interesting to see how things play out as we see more episodes.
4264	Van West	2014-04-21	No she said no because she didn't want to get caught but then stopped caring.Â 
Â 
It took Jaime time to notice that she was on her period.
4265	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-21	Didn't she say no because she was on her period?


Â 
No, she didn't mention that. She said "Not here" because she didn't want to get caught. Jaime notices she's menstruating but Cersei doesn't say anything about it.
Â 
And after they're finished, Jaime asks Cersei to marry him, and Cersei says he's being foolish because that will cause people to suspect Tommen's parentage.Â  ....Not exactly a post-rape conversation, that.
Â 
Edit: Oh, yeah, just reread the whole scene.Â  Cersei's the one who initiates in the book. She kisses Jaime, not the other way around. She also ends it with, "That was folly. With Father in the castle...Jaime, we must be careful."Â  This basically says "Yes, we should definitely resume sexual relations on a regular basis, but Dad can't be allowed to find out."Â  So that's not a post-rape conversation either.

Every show watcher thinks of Jaime as a rapist now and lost all matter of goodwill for him.Â 
Â 
How do you build that back up without the watcher thinking it's just another fake-out and that he's still a terrible person?Â
4268	T.C	2014-04-21	Jaime the twincest raping arsehole...anything to keep Cersei a white character. Didn't kill the Bastards, nah was totes Joff! Think the evilest thing she's done was remind Robert that they have Lady in the camp.


Yeah. I hate how they have softened her character up so muchÂ

Â 
There are many people like this in real life. Â Some of the greatest characters in literature are like this. Â 


Â 
No one should miss this. This is a MAJOR theme in the books. Easily one of the three most important themes. So many lines are devoted to the idea of people being "entirely good" or "entirely evil". And how morality exists in an extreme divide by so many. That people are capable of both greatness and evil is something that is tough to accept by society.
Â 
Melisandre has a talk with Davos where she says "an onion that's partially rotted needs to be thrown away". And she says that someone with even a small amount of evil, is entirely evil. That everything is black and white. God and the devil. R'hllor and the Great Other.
Â 
Davos meanwhile breaks the law helping Stannis. He is both punished and rewarded for his act (fingers, lordship). The bad being canceled (and then some) by the good. Later in ADWD Davos eats a partially rotted apple and thinks that the good parts of the apple tasted great.
Â 
In the books Jaime does tons of bad things. Kills Bran. Has sex with the Queen. That sex resulting in bastard children. And those children cause a massive war for the Iron Throne that results in thousands upon thousands of deaths. It's not like they needed a rape scene to show that Jaime is capable of doing bad things.
4270	Waylin Stark	2014-04-21	I was hoping that they'd show Cersei eventually submitting. And I didn't think they'd end the scene midway through the sex. I expected the full thing and the post-sex scenes from the book.
Â 
Now the Unsullied show watchers probably think it was rape.
Â 
But it does work well since they are building to their falling out this season.
4271	The God of Death	2014-04-21	Every show watcher thinks of Jaime as a rapist now and lost all matter of goodwill for him.Â 
Â 
How do you build that back up without the watcher thinking it's just another fake-out and that he's still a terrible person?Â 


Â 
Whether or not Jaime is a terrible person was always in the eye of the beholder anyway.Â 
Â 
Jaime is going to give Brienne Oathkeeper. Â He's going to be the one that saves Tyrion. Â Then Tyrion is going to be the one that kills the woman who loves him.
Â 
And people will see how things play out more between Jaime and Cersei...Â 
Â 
By the time the end of Season 4 comes around, this scene isn't going to be at the forefront of people's mind.
Â 
People won't forget. Â And show viewers will probably always still have aÂ more negative opinion of Jaime than book readers. Â But for both book readers and show watchers, Jaime will still be seen as a complex character, capable of doing both good and bad things.
4272	The God of Death	2014-04-21	Yeah. I hate how they have softened her character up so muchÂ 


Â 
Cersei has been a bitch plenty in the past, and she will have many more scenes of being a bitch.
Â 
Yes, she comes across as more sympathetic in the book than in the show.
Â 
But whether you want to admit it or not, the fundamental issue here is that you dislike the show deviating from the book.
Â 
I love the books, but this doesn't bother me in the slightest. Â I like the show's portrayal of Cersei as a more sympathetic character. Â Just becauseÂ different from the book doesn't automatically mean worse for me, like it does 99% of readers.Â 
Â 
Also, Cersei isn't even necessarily any worse in the book than she is in the show... it's just a matter of Lena doing a great job with the character. Â I find it fascinating to see how a character acting more or less in the same way can play differently on the show compared to the book.

Yeah i would have been okay with them doing the whole scene, and say maybe cutting down on the oberyn/ellariaÂ scene. to just make it the tywin extending the olive branch. Even if she wasn't specifcallyÂ objecting to the sex but to the place( her saying "it's not right" sounds like " we shouldn't be fucking in a sept next to a dead son")Â

Are you serious? She is far worse in the books! In the books it was her that had the bastards killed, it was her that tried to have Tyrion killed at blackwater, basically every horrible thing Joff did was her doing in the books. She also seems to adore Joffs behaviour in the books as opposed to the show. You might like her HBO version but quite frankly I think it's one of the worst decisions on their part.

Melisandre has a talk with Davos where she says "an onion that's partially rotted needs to be thrown away". And she says that someone with even a small amount of evil, is entirely evil. That everything is black and white. God and the devil. R'hllor and the Great Other.
Â 
Davos meanwhile breaks the law helping Stannis. He is both punished and rewarded for his act (fingers, lordship). The bad being canceled (and then some) by the good. Later in ADWD Davos eats a partially rotted apple and thinks that the good parts of the apple tasted great.
Â 
In the books Jaime does tons of bad things. Kills Bran. Has sex with the Queen. That sex resulting in bastard children. And those children cause a massive war for the Iron Throne that results in thousands upon thousands of deaths. It's not like they needed a rape scene to show that Jaime is capable of doing bad things.


Â 
This x1000. Â A+ post.
Â 
The greatest characters are the most complex ones. Â 
Â 
Anyone hear watch Breaking Bad? Â Think of Walter White. Â He may have been more "villain" than "good guy" by the end of that show (as Jaime might be more "good guy" than "villain" by the end of Ice & Fire?)... but through that entire show, Walt was capable of good and bad things. Â Just when you would think he's the worst, most selfish guy ever... he'd risk his life to save Jesse. Â Just when you'd think he was coming around, he would do something terrible. Â His overall swing may have been "breaking bad"... but he was capable of goodness along the way. Â He had good and bad in him. Â 
Â 
Jaime may be "breaking good" - that's open for interpretation - but there is no doubt he has darkness in him, and he is capable of doing bad things.
4279	The God of Death	2014-04-21	Are you serious? She is far worse in the books! In the books it was her that had the bastards killed, it was her that tried to have Tyrion killed at blackwater, basically every horrible thing Joff did was her doing in the books. She also seems to adore Joffs behaviour in the books as opposed to the show. You might like her HBO version but quite frankly I think it's one of the worst decisions on their part.


Â 
You think it's one of the worst decisions because you're one of the many people who simply doesn't like it when the show deviates from the books. Â Period. Â At least that's my opinion of your opinion.
Â 
This is why I find book readers often very frustrating to talk to.
Â 
I'm one of the people who read the book series before the show ever came out... but I respect the books and the show as two very similar, yet different entities. Â 
Â 
I feel that Cersei being more complex in the show, as opposed to more of a pure villain in the books, is in no way a poor adaptive choice.

4280	Dicer	2014-04-21	And then Cersei becomes the most sympathetic Lannister....somehowlol. I actually like it. I thought GRRM gave the Lannister brothers some proper development while Cersei devolved into a one dimensional baddie.
4281	TheBadboy	2014-04-21	I don't care if it's rape or not. 
The fact still remains JAIME GOT HORNY and INITIATED SEX WITH THE MOTHER WHOSE SON'S ROTTING CORPSE WAS 5 FEET AWAY FROM THEM. 
Is that the place or time to have sex or get horny ?  
 Next to your dead son's body? 
Cersei didn't initiate sex!  
Jaime did!  
And this happened in books too!
4282	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-21	Oh, this was 100% rape; no doubt about it. Not sure I care though. This has been wildly blown out of proportion. I understand Jaime book fans complaining, but the internet shouldn't be crumbling down over this specific event when in the very same episode we see a boy watch his father, mother, friends (an entire village) murdered and, later, eaten. No controversy over that, though. Nope.

People rightfully feel more sensitive about rape and other sexual assaults. I'm sure a lot more people can sadly relate to sexual abuse, whereas it's a bit harder to feel as strongly about murder and cannibalism when it's somewhat less likely to happen than the former.

I'm sure most people do and I understand that. I'm just really annoyed that it overshadows all the other (great) stuff about the episode, that it's the central focus in almost every review and will be the center of media attention for GOT over the next week. I hope the controversy was worth it, D&D.
4285	Ran	2014-04-21	So here is Graves and here is Coster-Waldau on the scene, and ultimately both seem to fall on the side of, "It's a complicated scene," rather than rape/not rape.I'm not greatly surprised that it's black and white for so many. We all have a bit of Stannis in us, somewhere.

The thing is, with rape it is a black and white issue at its very core. Either she consents and wants to have sex, or she doesn't. The lines were far too blurred in the show (even though I personally feel it was rape).

It seems to me like they tried to muddy the water, and I can sorta see that in the scene, but there's not enough if they were intending to pass it off as "not rape." What I don't understand is why they didn't just have Cersei speak consent. Did they misinterpret the novel or purposely go into another direction?
4288	Aeva Demetre	2014-04-21	No means no Jaime. Dude that certainly looked like a rape scene to me. I think Jaime just lashed out at Cersei after being made to feel inferior by everyone after a lifetime of being made to feel superior. It was a revolt by him against his own loss of identity and control in his world. A depressed person can become uncharacteristically consumed with rage.

You can't kiss someone while they're attempting to penetrate you and still claim rape.
4290	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-21	I would expect this sort of comment from Linda but not Elio. I'm very disappointed.
Â 
If you have sex with someone and it's without their consent then it's rape. This much is obvious and cannot be disputed by anyone with a sane mind. Now, it's true that you can have arrangements with someone where the word 'no' doesn't actually mean no. I know some people with an interest in BDSM who have taken part of such arrangements. Of course, in such cases you still have to consent to the arrangement and you often agree upon another word that is meant to convey the same meaning ('red' is apparently a popular alternative). This is, in any event, just an aside. Nothing like this takes place in the scene that I just saw. The character who in the very beginning of the storydid not agree with the rape of Elia and her children, who then went on to save Brienne from rape at the expense of one of his limbs, and who said at one point that if he were a woman he'd rather die than be raped, now rapes the person he loves most in the world?

4291	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-21	Next week the new complaint will be: "How can Cersei just let it go that she was raped by Jaime so easily!?!? THEY ARE RUINING THIS SHOW!!!"
Â 
Guess what: He didn't. Jaime and Cersei are weird. It was just more angry crazy twincest.
4292	Cyberia	2014-04-21	Cersei's hand was clearly behind Jamie's head pulling him towards her into a kiss.Â  This is after she said "Not here" and "stop it" a few times and after he tears her dress and they fall to the floor.
Â 
It shows that Cersei is conflicted.Â  She's not fighting Jamie, she's fighting herself.Â  She appears to give consent, withdraw it, give it again, and withdraw it again.Â  It's not black and white because she both consents and disconsents.Â  She changes her mind repeatedly AND points out to Jamie that the REASON she's not consenting is because of his hand.Â  She only withdraws consent when she see's his golden hand.Â 
Â 
At which point Jamie ends negotiations in an attempt to rebalance the power struggle of their relationship.Â  Lets face it the only thing she values is power and he knows it.Â  It's always been a part of their relationship.Â  That I think should be the metric by which we judge the scene, violation of Power not Consent.
4293	Rickeen Stark	2014-04-21	What annoyed me was the fact that it is so far away from his character. ( omg I hate Jaime, omg he's so bad. ) But he has someone executed for 'raping' a camp follower ( Whore ) and their excuse was "We had her a hundred times before." - For him to do what he did in this scene; they can't do that. At least he's on level with Stannis now, my other favourite character.

4295	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	Would it honestly have hurt them to have had Cersei say "Hurry" at some point?
Â 
They talk about it being 'complicated' but they already had them humping next their son's corpse. It was already 'complicated' enough.
4296	Batman	2014-04-21	I haven't read aSoS in a while, but didn't Cersei initially try to get Jaimie to stop because she was on her period?


Â 
She followed it by telling him to be quick and that "this is where you belong" or something like that. Which we saw none of, just her saying no.

4299	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Let's look at the facts:
Â 
1. Do they have an intimate relationship? Yes.
2. Did Cersei kiss Jaime or return his affection at any point during the encounter? Repeatedly.
3. Was any significant force or violence used by Jaime? No.
4. Did Cersei make any significant effort to get away or make him stop? (screaming, clawing at his eyes, etc) No.
Â 
It's pretty clear that she was just a bit uncomfortable because the time / mood wasn't right. She made no great effort to resist the way a rape victim would and even submitted at times.

Â 
So you're implying every rape victim should do much more to resist their attacker, and that them submitting means it isn't rape? What if the victim realizes the hopelessness of the situation and decides to save herself from further harm by submitting? This also happens, and it happened here with Cersei.Â

4303	Inv1ctus	2014-04-21	Lol at them saying it was a complicated scene while it was implied strongly that it was rape. I'm pretty sure most of the unsullied will think that. And they could have easily handled this differently just by ending the scene with Cersei on top, having wicked fun.  They could still manage it, if they have a scene in the next episode where Cersei simply tells Jaime that it wasn't right that they did it in front of their dead son. But I think they won't even mention anything about this scene again. Jaime surely took kind of a pathetic character arc in the minds of many, I'm sure, even if it is Cersei. People would be fine by her being killed but not with rape.Â

I think it's too early to determine this yet as the scene ended and we do not know Cersei's final thoughts yet.

Further harm? When was she harmed?
Â 
And by submitting, I don't just mean staying still until it's over. She was visibly returning Jaime's affection at times, kissing him back, almost like she wanted to do it just as much as he did, but was conflicted because the time and location was wrong.
Â 

Â 
If someone overpowers you and you decide Â to take it Â to avoid more bodily harmÂ or even being killed, it's still rape. Submitting ain't the same as consenting.

Again, what bodily harm? He wasn't beating her or being particularly violent in any way.
Â 
She wasn't kissing him back passionately because she feared he might beat her. She was clearly conflicted, consenting at times, then deciding it wasn't a good idea.Â

If that was the case why didn't she initiate and play a more active, 'consensual' role, instead of constantly saying no?

I was saying that would be completely in her character. But by not doing that, the director screwed up. I think it's simple as that, if he says in an interview that the scene wasn't supposed to look like a rape, but it clearly does look like it. If we the book readers thought it was rape, when we were expecting consensual sex. Then unsullied will for sure think it was rape. I was trying to see it as non rape, I really tried hard, but I couldn't see it.Â

I don't expect her to be completely okay with it, but I don't expect her to feel like she's been beaten and raped by a stranger in some dark alley either.
Â 
I expect she'll simply say to Jaime it was inappriopriate for them to have sex right next to the corpse of their dead son.
4313	BasTyra	2014-04-21	I think one of the problems for me was that they've had Jaime come home early and he's already been rejected by Cersei in a pretty shitty way. It made that scene even worse imo. In the show he's been rejected, he knows she doesn't want him and he forces himself on her.Â 
Â 
Maybe I need to do a re-read but I don't recall anything like that happening in the books. Hasn't he just returned home when they have that weird coffin sex? When I read it I don't recall cersei being uninterested in Jaime beforehand and I don't remember ever thinking 'rape' - I get that the chapter is jaime's pov and that's an interesting point but, yeah... the scene in the show was pretty cut and dry for me. :/
4314	Jinjonator	2014-04-21	If their intention was to portray it as "complicated" (however the hell you consider the concept of consent to be complicated) then they failed. The way it was written, and the way it was shown, was clearly rape. The fact that so many people genuinely don't understand the basic concept of "no means no" is seriously terrifying.
4315	Roose Seal	2014-04-21	Clearly rape.
Gross scene that
1)Â undermines all the character development Jaime has been through
2) tries to draw sympathy to Cersei by making her a victim, because there's no other way to make a female character sympathetic is there?

4321	Lord of Winterhell	2014-04-21	This is really a hard topic to discuss (esp. for us non-native speakers), b/c rape is a horrible thing and I really hate rape-apologists in real life.
Â 
Having said that, I didn't mind the scene, and I don't think it ruined Jaime. I didn't read whole thread, only couple of first posts and it seemed that there's almost a consensus that it was a rape, and it ruined Jaime's redemption arc.
Â 
I don't want to comment on rape much - it was a rape, but give super special circumstances of relationship between those two I just can't even compare its impact on Cercei to impact of any victim of real rape (and not because how she is). I wasn't disgusted looking at that scene, and thats a pretty good test for me, since I consider myself pretty sensible about these things.
Â 
But my main point is that I really don't think it hurts Jaime as a character. I never read it in the books like he was pure villain before maiming, and then suddenly he became a good guy. He certainly starts to become a better person, but he is still perfectly capable of doing bad things, and forcing Cercei to have sex with him when he wants to after she refused him couple of times before (to the point that he really "needs" it) fits perfectly with his personality. I was a moment of almost lost passion to him (it's not like he'll become a serial rapist now), something like "goodbye Cercei") and I think he will be disgusted afterwards - which again fits perfectly with his changing character.
Â 
I agree it would be a better scene if it looked like she agreed at some point, but have no problem with how it went.

Mostly this. Why even bothering with his character development last season? It's incredibly inconsistent. Last season he saves Brienne from rape, and this season he's the one doing it to another woman? How does it make sense to anyone? They obviously don't know how to coherently write characters.

Â 
She kisses him passionatelyÂ beforeÂ he tries to have sex with her. She stops and clearly shows she doesn't want it to get any further. He doesn't care, and grabs her and begins kissing her,Â to which she does not kiss back. Even when they are on the floor and he is pulling their clothes off and still kissing her,Â she is still struggling and not kissing back. Then he says he doesn't care she doesn't want to do this, and the scene ends.
Â 
There is no ambiguity here. He raped her.Â

Has Jaime done bad things? Of course (worth noting, also, that saying "he does bad things" is one of the most cartoonish oversimplifications of characterization I've ever seen). But in both the books and the show, Jaime has shown himself to be clearly opposed to rape and finds it abhorrent. The idea that any kind of circumstance would bring someone who abhors rape to commit rape themselves is just absurd.
Â 
And submission =/= consent. At no point in the scene did Cersei explicitly consent. That really is the end of that. I find myself worrying greatly about all the people who are determined to convince everyone else that you can force yourself on a person against their will without it being rape.

Having said that, I didn't mind the scene, and I don't think it ruined Jaime. I didn't read whole thread, only couple of first posts and it seemed that there's almost a consensus that it was a rape, and it ruined Jaime's redemption arc.
Â 
I don't want to comment on rape much - it was a rape, but give super special circumstances of relationship between those two I just can't even compare its impact on Cercei to impact of any victim of real rape (and not because how she is). I wasn't disgusted looking at that scene, and thats a pretty good test for me, since I consider myself pretty sensible about these things.
Â 
But my main point is that I really don't think it hurts Jaime as a character. I never read it in the books like he was pure villain before maiming, and then suddenly he became a good guy. He certainly starts to become a better person, but he is still perfectly capable of doing bad things, and forcing Cercei to have sex with him when he wants to after she refused him couple of times before (to the point that he really "needs" it) fits perfectly with his personality. I was a moment of almost lost passion to him (it's not like he'll become a serial rapist now), something like "goodbye Cercei") and I think he will be disgusted afterwards - which again fits perfectly with his changing character.
Â 
I agree it would be a better scene if it looked like she agreed at some point, but have no problem with how it went.


I disagree, we have 3 examples of jaime saving people from rape, or at least being very upset about it happening, one of them even in the show. So I don't think it's his character Â to rape anybody.Â 
Â 
It doesn't make any sense Â at all to have someone save a person from rape, and then turn around and do it themselves. I understand people can be severe hypocrites, but that's a huge change in your character.
4330	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Â 
She kisses him passionatelyÂ beforeÂ he tries to have sex with her. She stops and clearly shows she doesn't want it to get any further. He doesn't care, and grabs her and begins kissing her,Â to which she does not kiss back. Even when they are on the floor and he is pulling their clothes off and still kissing her,Â she is still struggling and not kissing back. Then he says he doesn't care she doesn't want to do this, and the scene ends.
Â 
There is no ambiguity here. He raped her.Â 
Â 
/thread


She grabs him by the head and kisses him long after he's made it clear he wants them to have sex, thus giving consent and proving that she's only conflicted about having sex at that time and place, not about having sex with Jaime in general.
Â 
If she really wanted to stop it, she would have tried a lot harder to do so. And Jaime didn't hit her or use any kind of extreme violence to subdue her, so your argument that she submitted to avoid further harm carries no weight whatsoever.

'She didn't fight back, it's not rape'
Please get out of this thread.
4332	Inv1ctus	2014-04-21	1. This thread was started with the title "Why do they treat Jaime that way" and I kind of expected the debate will go into that, why did they choose to do this for his character etc. But it seems majority of comments are regardind if it was rape/not a rape, which is completely ludicrous. Anyone who has some morals can clearly see how the scene was portrayed.
Â 
2. Director says this was supposed to look like a consensual sex. So he clearly messed up very badly. I can't even imagine what went through their heads while they were editing this scene. I'm baffled.Â
4333	Conchobar	2014-04-21	Yeah like everyone else bar the select few, I had a problem with Jaime's scene as well.
4334	Jinjonator	2014-04-21	Also, in reference to the extremely weak arguments about it being okay because Cersei was "conflicted" (a fact which, if true, the scene did not adequately convey)... if Cersei was giving off signals of not being on-board with it, Jaime should have stopped. Period. I mean hell, put yourself in that position. Imagine you are initiating coitus with your partner. If your partner starts saying "no" and "stop", wouldn't your first impulse be to stop, and assess the situation? I'm going to give everyone here the benefit of the doubt, and hope that none of you are rapists (statistically, a very generous BotD on my part, but I'll extend the courtesy all the same). And if you aren't, I assume you would stop; (if you admit that, in that scenario, you, personally, wouldn't stop, and would keep going as Jaime did, then you're probably a rapist, sorry to say).
Â 
And yet, Jaime didn't stop. He didn't ask what she wanted. He literally responded to her objections with "I don't care". He took what he wanted, and whether she wanted it or not wasn't a consideration for him.
4335	belladeuil	2014-04-21	In the books, she was reluctant at first but she consented and participated fully by the end. In the TV Series, it was rape. She kept saying 'it's not right' but he said he didn't care and carried on though for a short moment before that it looked consensual if very rough.
4336	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-21	In the book I have interpreted their scene that the resisting is kind of their thing, like a kinky game or something. I never thought it was rape in the book. I don't know why the show left out the "Do me Jaime" part, this would have made the scene much less controversial in my opinion. As for ruining Jaime, he threw Bran out of the window, he ain't exactly a good person.

4338	Hippocras	2014-04-21	Why is it that all the other Lannisters are portrayed in a more kindly fashion on the show than they are in the books with the exception of Jaime.
Â 
Why do this to his character?
Â 
Is it because the audience was starting to like him? Or is it that the show runners know the ending and they want his redemption ark to be that much bigger.
Â 
I can't figure this out.
Â 
Suggestions?
it might be more a need to humanize Cersei. And I actually agree given the vehement hatred Cersei gets around here, that fans turn her into a one-dimensional villain way too easily. Jamie has goodwill to spare, Cersei doesn't.
But in this scene we clearly see her use the hinted promise of future sex, after weeks of withholding it because of his hand, to try to get him to murder Tyrion. It was frankly disgusting behaviour on her part too, so Jamie's rage mixed with desire was a bit of a bomb waiting to happen.

I think they got the scene spot on. Consensual yet inappropriate, with conflicted emotions would be the way i'd describe it.

Â 
It does beg the question though, as to what they're getting at with Jaime. Is it because his character development in the books is meant to be a red herring? Book!Jaime is not a good man by any stretch, but he's not a rapist, and he's someone that after going through the ordeal of losing his hand etc, starts to make certain choices, deliberately, to be the person he wishes he could be. They're painting a completely different character in show!Jaime.Â

You really need to stop this. Unless you've been in the situation yourself you're in no position to judge what the definition of rape is. Just stop.

I don't know if she was really manipulating him though, since he initiated the whole thing. Unless you want to say she did it when they first kissed.
4344	Ran	2014-04-21	MarieAntoinette,It's worth noting that the two times we see Jaime and Cersei have sex in the books, both scenes start with her appearing to resist to a point. I think it's fair to say that the idea of there being a "power-play" aspect to their sexual relationship is at least suggested by the books, so it's not a surprise that the director and actors read it that way.
4345	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	Some viewers just clearly don't know what rape is really like, or can't read the situation properly.


Â 
I'm sorry, but I think it'sÂ youÂ that isn't reading this situation properly. And It's a very bold statement accusing people of not knowing what rape is really like.Â
4346	Jinjonator	2014-04-21	No, using it to manipulate him to murder his brother was disgusting behaviour.


Jaime was the one forcing himself on Cersei, not the other way around. At one point did Cersei say anything to the effect of "I have sex with you, and you kill Tyrion"?
Â 
Also, even if it did happen that way, and Cersei actually was using sex to "manipulate" Jaime... I don't see how it wouldn't still be his fault for not being able to control his boner. If she tried to manipulate him with sex, he could easily say no if he wanted to.

He sent everyone away so she could grieve alone and he could have a private chat. But he made no sexual move. This is in line with her refusals in earlier episodes this season, where she basically said it was over and she didn't want him anymore.
Then she told him he had to kill Tyrion for her. SHE then kissed HIM, and the implication was he could have her again if he obeyed her. Then she backed away and told him again he needed to kill Tyrion. That is when his desire mixed with rage and he forced himself on her.
The whole thing was really a power struggle, and not normal sex OR normal rape but something between. Cersei has been manipulating Jamie his entire life - see his appointment to the Kingsguard. She tried to do it again here, to get him to kill his own brother for her. He did certainly force himself on her, but her distress was more about him taking his own power back from her and him be out of her control than it was about her actually not wanting him or being violated. 
It was a power reversal, not an aggressive male taking advantage of a powerless woman.

4349	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	I'd be curious to hear grrm's take on this, because I think there's a reason in the books grrm has Cersei voice her consent. It seems to me he didn't want it to appear as rape at all, creepy and fucked up yes, but "do me now!" is nothing like "no, no, no it's not right".Â
4350	Roose Seal	2014-04-21	You really need to stop this. Unless you've been in the situation yourself you're in no position to judge what the definition of rape is. Just stop.


Not to mention, Cersei at first kisses Jaime but then says "Stop" repeatedly.Â 
At which point, Jaime slams her on the ground as she whimpers "it's not right, it's not right" and clearly struggles, because Jaime has to hold her down as he pounds aggressively while saying "i don't care"
how the fuck clearer can it be?
Consent has to be ongoing, just because you kiss someone at first doesn't mean you're on board for all the rest. Cersei clearly expresses her disapproval and Jaime clearly chooses to ignore it.Â 
I find it extremely disturbing (yet sadly not so surprising) that anyone would interpret this scene as anything other than rape.

Â
4351	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	What is the point of this thread? To prove it was a rape scene? Â If so, so what?


Â 
Well since some people are convinced it wasn't rape, this thread clearly does have a purpose.
Â 
Also, it's important because this is a drastic and severe change in a character that is seen by many to be undergoing a redemption arc. To have them rape someone will in that kind of messes up the whole thing.
Â 
Therefore, this thread does have a point.

Seriously. Consent to one act isn't consent to all acts, and the second that consent is rescinded, that's that. If you keep going after they've stopped consenting, that's rape.Â

This. It makes me really question Alex Graves. As Ran pointed out a few pages ago though, some of it seemed ADRed, so it's possible Alex Graves directed it to seem more consensual and they changed it in post? It's troubling either way though.

Â 
She says "no," "stop," and "don't" repeatedly during the entire scene, including when Jaime's thrusting, and never gives verbal consent. How is it not rape? Because she kisses him back for 2 seconds?
Â 
Even if somehow, upon rewatch, it seems less rapey (though when I viewed it again it seemed worse to me), why on Earth would show-viewers go back and dissect that scene? Her protests were unambiguous, and that's what people saw.

Â He is strong and continues, he does not care about objections. Â  It is a dramatic scene. Â It shows Jamie strong, taking control or trying to reestablish what he had prior to the exodus. Â It shows Cersei weak, undecided, lost. Â  It is sex and it is a clash, they are reunited but separated. Â He gets what he wants that moment, but loses it? Â It's all that.

Also even if she consented to letting him kiss her, it doesn't mean that's the go ahead to start having sex. Just like if i we're to say "yeah lets do it" to a girl. doesn't mean she has free reign to do whatever she wants if i don't want her to.

Â 
God this fucking scene ! Why ? Just why ?? If there is something Jaime ISN'T , it's that. I really don't get what motivated it, especially now that he's starting (in the books) to do things right. Basically they're having him rape his sister, and in the next episode being uber-nice and making the right decion by sending Brienne on her quest ? And we're supposed to think it's complex writing and just go along with it ? This shitty move just makes as much sense as an athlete shooting himself in the foot before a race. I really don't get, again, why they would even go there. It butchers not only Jaime's characterization, but Cersei's as well, making her as usual a victim and a woobie.
Â 
I don't have faith anymore, and seeing people stating it wasn't rape makes it even worse.
4369	Hath4	2014-04-21	Sexual violence is a huge part of the backdrop in this world and it's fair for them to show that. this though was not the place. we already had a scene dripping with sexual violence with Ramsay hunting poor tansy for sport and feeding her to his bitches. Did we really need another sexually violent scene this week.

Yes,Â and Â it alsoÂ starts being problematic when they have one of the most 'anti-rape' character do it. We didn't need it is an understatement . What we needed was them sticking to the bloody books.
4371	ovis alba	2014-04-21	I think not adding the eventual consent makes the scence way more uncomfortable and the way they showes it, yes it clearly was rape.Â 
However, I don't agree it's that different from the book. I don't see it that book-Jaime would never have done it and TV-Jaime now did, because to me book-Jaime did pretty much exactly the same: he forces himself on Cersei who clearly objectes. And yes Cersei changes her mind after a while, but that does not change much that Jaime didn't care and can just not know she will eventually agree.

Now you're just manipulating things to try and win an argument you've already lost.
Â 
As I said before, Cersei seemed conflicted by how inappropriate the moment was rather than absolutely opposed to the idea of having sex with Jaime. She was kissing him back and at times showing a clear desire to have sex with him. Her pleas for him to stop were weak because she didn't really want him to stop.
Â 
Regarding what i'd do in a similar situation, it would depend entirely on the specific circumstances, the nature of the relationship, and the nature of the person. Assuming I knew them well enough as Jaime would know Cersei, I would read their emotions and behaviour more than the words coming out of their mouth.
4373	ovis alba	2014-04-21	Actually when I think more about it: what does make the scene worse to me is not leaving out Cersei in the end enjoing it, but Jaime coming back earlier and establishing already the changed relationship between him and Cersei.

I'm gonna be generous and assume you aren't a rapist, but these are literally the exact justifications that rapists give, and the fact that you feel so comfortable in believing these words is disturbing, to say the least. I sincerely hope you never find yourself in such a situation, because, based on what you've said, I strongly suspect you would end up raping someone, without even realizing it was rape.
Â 
So. Ya know. Have fun being a rape apologist. It's clear you feel very strongly about defending this position of yours (for whatever motive).
4375	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	Now you're just manipulating things to try and win an argument you've already lost.
Â 
As I said before, Cersei seemed conflicted by how inappropriate the moment was rather than absolutely opposed to the idea of having sex with Jaime. She was kissing him back and at times showing a clear desire to have sex with him. Her pleas for him to stop were weak because she didn't really want him to stop.
Â 
Regarding what i'd do in a similar situation, it would depend entirely on the specific circumstances, the nature of the relationship, and the nature of the person. Assuming I knew them well enough as Jaime would know Cersei, I would read their emotions and behaviour more than the words coming out of their mouth.


Â 
I seriously doubt it'sÂ meÂ that's lost this argument. Maybe if you spent a little more time focusing on other posts instead of mine you'd see a vast majority agree with my stance.
Â 
I saw absolutely no desire from Cersei to want to have sex. And are you suggesting that anyone that doesn't beg hard enough isn't being raped? That's a pretty horrific thing to say. You have absolutely no understanding on this issue.
Â 
Even if you and the other person had some kind of system or habit, no matter what you should stop the second they say no, and check with them about what they mean, like if they mean it seriously. If so, you should never continue. Jaime did, and he never even asked her in the first place.
Â 
I don't know how many ways to say this. The scene was a rape. End of discussion. You've really got nothing to support your 'arguments.'
4376	T.C	2014-04-21	Â 
You think it's one of the worst decisions because you're one of the many people who simply doesn't like it when the show deviates from the books. Â Period. Â At least that's my opinion of your opinion.
Â 
This is why I find book readers often very frustrating to talk to.
Â 
I'm one of the people who read the book series before the show ever came out... but I respect the books and the show as two very similar, yet different entities. Â 
Â 
I feel that Cersei being more complex in the show, as opposed to more of a pure villain in the books, is in no way a poor adaptive choice.


No need to get overdramatic, you replied to me so i replied back to you, it's a discussion and it's not that serious.
Â 
And fyi i watched the show before reading the books, and while i still enjoy it, they don't compare to the books.
Â 
I don't mind changes to the book if they make sense, in which this case with Cersei it doesn't. Like what exactly was the director trying to achieve in taking away some of her signature crimes and handing them to Joffrey? What was the point? It's not like GRRM wrote those scenes with poor motivation from her POV. Regardless if the director wanted to turn Cersei into a saint, some things are better left the way they are.

4377	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	That was truly horrible. I didn't like some of the changes they made to Jaime early on but then they improved things, helped by NCW's great acting but show Jaime has done plenty wrong without the tone that scene took needing to be added. Horrible
4378	Natalia Borgia	2014-04-21	Even if Cersei's hands had been free she is not as strong as one of the best fighters in Westeros. I am not liking show Jaime at all and not even sure why they included this scene ( that I did not like in the book either) except if as others say this turns her against Jaime or makes Cersei fall out of love with him.. l

She says "no," "stop," and "don't" repeatedly during the entire scene, including when Jaime's thrusting, and never gives verbal consent. How is it not rape? Because she kisses him back for 2 seconds?
Â 


Those are just words. If you add the words "we might get caught" on the end of "no, stop, don't" suddenly it's irrefutably consensual. If you add "help i'm being raped!" on the end, it's irrefutably rape.
Â 
The fact that she says something along the lines of "this is wrong" says to me that she's far more concerned about the location rather than genuinely distressed by the thought of having sex with someone she doesn't want to have sex with. Her tone and lack of physical resistance supports this.
Â 
So she's basically uncomfortable with the situation, but not entirely nonconsensual.
4380	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-21	I see huge red flags all over this thread. If only some people were forced to carry them around in real life, the women and men around them would be a lot safer.
4381	Hippocras	2014-04-21	Does anyone here arguing it was DEFINITELY rape happen to remember the OTHER sex scenes involving these two? I refer you to the very first one, it the first season, right before Bran was pushed.
Watch Cersei play her game of hot-cold there as well. Every single time there is a bizarre mix of hate and lust between these two. Cersei's desire for Jamie is and always was based on him being a fighter under her power, and her power over him was manipulating his desire, while his over her was physical.
Every sex scene between these two ha an element of what we saw in this scene - her wanting to be "taken". If she had been doing that their entire lives, chances are Jamie doesn't even believe her when she tells him to stop by this point. 
She initiated the sexual element of this scene. He interpreted it as she had trained him to interpret it. Mixed signals. So did he force her? Yes. Did she want him to force her? Well she had trained him to interpret it that way.
4382	Jinjonator	2014-04-21	Yeah. They're just words. Like when Jaime says "I don't care", if you add the words "about the poverty crisis in King's Landing", he's irrefutably stating disinterest in politics, not disinterest in consent.

Â 
There's not a specific way a person should act when being raped. It doesn't make it not rape just because they don't fight back very hard or scream. It was very clearly still rape.
4384	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Â

Again, she grabbed him by the head and kissed him passionately after he made it clear he wanted to have sex with her.
Â 
Even when she started having second thoughts because it's so inappropriate for them to have sex next to the corpse of their dead son, she hardly made an effort to resist.
Â 
The fact that the people responsible for the scene are saying it's consensual should tell you that you've simply misread the whole scene.Â

As many have said before, casual viewers may very well miss the point, and Jaime`s redemption arc is wasted.
Â 
I`ve asked this in another thread but no one replied: what is the actual point of this scene in the books? To show that Cersei and Jaime don`t care about anything but each other? (not caring about Joffrey or the gods)
4386	Roose Seal	2014-04-21	Those are just words. If you add the words "we might get caught" on the end of "no, stop, don't" suddenly it's irrefutably consensual. If you add "help i'm being raped!" on the end, it's irrefutably rape.

You've basically used every possible justification for rape in the book except "she was dressed really slutty", but go on, you'll get there.

Didn't he have her hands held the whole time? It's not like there was much she could do to stop him
4388	Natalia Borgia	2014-04-21	But the rape- I watched the scene again and it looked MORE like rape than the first time. I don't know why D&D want to make Cersei the good twin and Jaime a rapist... but to all the guys saying this isn't rape- when a woman says NO and you drag her to the ground it is rape. Maybe she seemed to go along with it Â ( which again it looks like she is trying to resist) because Jaime as LC of the KG would have been killed for assaulting his sis the queen regent.
4389	King of the Road	2014-04-21	Unless the rape dynamic comes back in an important way this scene is best forgotten about. It didn't spoil the episode for me, nor the character it's just such an anomaly.

Â 
Some people don't seem to understand that the classical portrayal of a woman kicking and screaming is bollocks. You don't know how you'll react until it happens to you, and hopefully you never find out, but there are many ways to react. Realising there's not much of a fight you can put up because the person abusing you is much physically stronger than you, it's just something that happens.Â

Her hands were free a lot of the time. Instead of trying to resist by clawing at his face, she decides to grab at him passionately inbetween a few very unconvincing pushes. Good acting by Lena Headey in my opinion.

Well her marriage to Robert and the sex wasn't exactly consensual. Having no choice but to have sex with someone really messes someone up in the head. Perhaps I used the wrong terminology (it's late and I'm tired). What I meant to say was that even though she has the ability to take action against what Jaime did, that'sÂ afterÂ she has been raped, and even then she may not want to, since she still does love him in a way. But just because someone loves someone else, doesn't mean it isn't rape when they force sex upon them against their will.
4406	Hippocras	2014-04-21	He did NOT initiate the whole thing. Watch it again.
He sent everyone away so she could grieve alone and he could have a private chat. But he made no sexual move. This is in line with her refusals in earlier episodes this season, where she basically said it was over and she didn't want him anymore.
Then she told him he had to kill Tyrion for her. SHE then kissed HIM, and the implication was he could have her again if he obeyed her. Then she backed away and told him again he needed to kill Tyrion. That is when his desire mixed with rage and he forced himself on her.
The whole thing was really a power struggle, and not normal sex OR normal rape but something between. Cersei has been manipulating Jamie his entire life - see his appointment to the Kingsguard. She tried to do it again here, to get him to kill his own brother for her. He did certainly force himself on her, but her distress was more about him taking his own power back from her and him be out of her control than it was about her actually not wanting him or being violated. 
It was a power reversal, not an aggressive male taking advantage of a powerless woman.

You are projecting, inventing things. Â None of that is in the show. Â And other than Joffrey, she is probably the most evil character in the show with most power.

Â 
I don't know what YOU have been watching. She's been portrayed as a victim of all the men around her in the show. In the books she is too, but she's also a perpetrator of violence, and she's aggressive and abusive. She's nothing like that in the show, all terrible things fall upon her, and she's just helpless.

It's clearly in the show, like when Cersei says she was sold like a horse to be ridden whenever he (Robert) wanted, implying the sex happened whenever Robert wanted, her feelings or decisions being irrelevant.Â

I would struggle to call her more evil than Tywin in the show, with the amount of softening up the director has given her character, wouldn't surprise me if he was a feminist or something.

Â 
The tower scene is very clearly consensual. They are both enjoying the sex, and she makes no move or says anything or acts inÂ anyÂ way that suggests it's forceful. She says 'stop' when she sees Bran, and Jaime does indeed stop when she says that. There is no link between these scenes. One was clearly consensual, the other clearly rape.

4418	Fez	2014-04-21	My feeling is, between D&D, Alex Graves, the cinematographer, the editors, and the actors themselves, there are more than enough people involved in creating the scene that if it was meant to be 100% consensual, someone would've pointed out at some point that it wasn't; and that they either need to use another take, or reshoot the scene. So I think they wanted a rape/quasi-rape* scene for some reason. I'm not totally clear why, but I'll trust them on this for now.
Â 
*I don't have an HD receiver, so the entire show is darker and fuzzier than it is when I watch the DVDs later. As such, more nuanced actions are harder for me to see, so I couldn't tell if she was actually consenting by the end (helping Jaime take clothes off, etc.) or not.

Ok, so let's say that a couple who have been together for 10+ years decide to have sex in a public place. Are you suggesting it's rape if one of them says "stop, we might get caught" and the other continues, sensing that their partner doesn't really want them to stop? What if they say "stop, we might get caught" in a playful voice or give off a less obvious signal that tells the partner they've been with for 10+ years that they're not genuinely refusing consent?

Â 
The second the word 'stop' is said, you should stop. Basic principle. It doesn't matter if she also added "we might get caught." The very fact she said stop in the first place means she doesn't want it to continue, regardless of the circumstances.Â

Â 
She says "not here" initially, but clearly gives consent before he has sex with her. Not to mention, he's not taking her in a sudden wave of anger, like Show!Jaime did. He's finally reunited with her and feels passionate. Show!Jaime begins calling her "hateful," then being upset the "gods made him" love her, and then forces himself on her, as she's clearly saying "no," "stop," and "don't." It's rape. She protests through the end of the scene, including when he's in her.
4424	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	You are cutting out inconvenient elements of the scene that don't fit your theory.


Â 
Nope, in the show's version of that scene (since itÂ isÂ the show version we're talking about, right?) no dialogue or any other action is seen before Bran is seen by them that would indicate a forceful nature.Â
4425	Jinjonator	2014-04-21	The reason behind a woman withholding consent is irrelevant. As QoW said, if she says stop, you stop. The fact that you're dead-set on convincing yourself and the rest of us that it's okay to ignore when someone says to stop, makes me wonder increasingly if you haven't done that yourself.
4426	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-21	Â 
The second the word 'stop' is said, you should stop. Basic principle. It doesn't matter if she also added "we might get caught." The very fact she said stop in the first place means she doesn't want it to continue, regardless of the circumstances.Â 


Â 
I agree with this unless there is an established norm within the relationship that both parts have explicitly agreed to and which says that 'stop' and 'no' don't mean what they usually mean. I hesitate to make claims which entail that a lot of people who are willingly engaging in BDSM-related activities are, unbeknownst to themselves, being raped.

That may well be the case, but unless they specifically address this in the next episode as being forceful but consensual, we can all safely say it was rape as far as we know so far.

Let's just leave this discussion about the show and nothing else, we do not need to create unnecessary drama here.
4429	TheEvilKing	2014-04-21	Here's the dialogue for the scene, for the record:
Â 
J: You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made love a hateful woman?
Â 
C: Jaime not here, please. Please. Stop it, stop it.
Â 
J: No.
Â 
C: Stop it. Stop. It's not right. It's not right. It's not right.
Â 
J: I don't care, I don't care.
Â 
I don't think it was supposed to be rape, but they did a really bad job of portraying it as consensual. In the books she eventually gives in and is all like "yes fuck me sweet brother!", which would have actually worked better in terms of it being a dark, sick moment, I think, because of the sheer depravity of saying that.

No, we can just say it was consensual, but also say that the directors were retards in making it known on screen.
4432	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	Ok, so let's say that a couple who have been together for 10+ years decide to have sex in a public place. Are you suggesting it's rape if one of them says "stop, we might get caught" and the other continues, sensing that their partner doesn't really want them to stop? What if they say "stop, we might get caught" in a playful voice or give off a less obvious signal that tells the partner they've been with for 10+ years that they're not genuinely refusing consent?


yeah. if you say "no" that should at least make the other stop and ask if you really mean what you say.

4433	Roose Seal	2014-04-21	My feeling is, between D&D, Alex Graves, the cinematographer, the editors, and the actors themselves, there are more than enough people involved in creating the scene that if it was meant to be 100% consensual, someone would've pointed out at some point that it wasn't; and that they either need to use another take, or reshoot the scene. So I think they wanted a rape/quasi-rape* scene for some reason. I'm not totally clear why, but I'll trust them on this for now.


The fact that everyoneÂ thought they were writing/filming a consensual scene that totally and completely comes off as rape goes to show just how ignorant these people are as to what rape really is.
Just look at the attitude of some people in this thread:
"She didn't strongly fight back": it wasn't rape
"she consented at first": it wasn't rape
"she said "no don't but she really meant "yes do"" it wasn't rape
"She doesn't want him her but she definitely wants him": it wasn't rape
It's truly upsetting that the writers wrote a straightforward rape scene thinking they were writing an "ambiguous" scene.
and I find it especially wrong and fucked up in such a mainstream show because it reinforces dozens of clichA©s about what constitutes rape and what doesn't, in the worst possible way.
This show doesn't exactly have a stellar track record wrt to sex scenes and female characters, but this scene and the casual attitude of the show runners towards it is beyond fucked up.

They haven't see each other for a very long time, they both lost a lot and they're emotional and overwhelmed and grieving. In the show she has already rejected him. It seems like Jaime is looking for acceptance from Cersei, and when he doesn't get it he takes from her the only thing he can take. Everything is different, not just the fact she does not consent to it in the show.

Â 
They're probably of the same type of people that thought Drogo didn't rape Dany in the books cause he fingered her gently. Plz. There's nothing ambiguous about rape. It's one of the few things in the world that is black and white in its contrast.Â

Look also at later scenes.
I note that in your responses, you quote me, but conveniently cut out the main point, which was her use of sex to manipulate Jamie.
She has power. Almost limitless power as a monarch in a place where there is no law but the monarchy. She plays power games, and has been using her brother for this purpose her whole life.
Yet no one thinks that maybe HER behaviour was the real violation in the relationship. She basically ruined the man. Then in this one scene he takes back his power, which she always made him believe was ONLY in his ability to use force, and everyone screams rape.
She has made him believe his only value is his ability to do violence, and when he lost his hand he lost that value and she pushed him away.

Â 
Exactly. Which is why her giving explicit consent in this scene was even more important. She basically dumped Jaime in the first episode; he should have never gone forward with it unless he was 100% sure she wanted him. Her one feeble kiss is hardly an invitation for sex, and especially followed by her continuous appeals for him to stop.
4439	Volverin	2014-04-21	What's upsetting is you lot overthinking this scene...

For me it wasnt a rape because Cersei wasnt against the sex itself, she was against doing it in a sept. "Please, not here, this is not right."

Â 
Okay let me get this clear. You're saying that it's Cersei's fault Jaime wants to have sex with her because she apparently "manipulated" him? Big shock, people use sex to manipulate others to do what they want all the time. There's nothing wrong with it when it's consensual between both people. The other person doesn'tÂ haveÂ to have sex with them just because they're being manipulated, most commonly by the woman. It's an incentive, not a forceful act.
Â 
Also, and I really hope you aren't suggesting this, are you saying that when he forcefully has sex with her against her will it's good because he's finally regaining his 'power?' Wtf?

Â 
But did they think that? A lot of bookreaders clearly thought it was meant to consensual, because in the book it was. That doesn't mean though that the show didn't decide to change it to something else for whatever reason. The best reason I saw was that Jaime was trying one last time to get back to his old life, it didn't work out and he was so frustrated that he rapes her. And this will lead to him being ashamed, completely giving up on his old life, and going his own way; doing things like giving Brienne the mission to find and rescue Sansa, and helping Tyrion escape.
Â 
Granted, this brings up the issue of how often the show uses rape to advance a plot; but it doesn't mean they don't know the difference between consent and rape.
4446	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	True


Â 
Yeah but with that post I meant they truly fucked up.
Â 
They kept the shocking scene and made it worse, and also erased the context in which it happened which is a HUGE part of it. It made zero sense in the show, and it changed Jaime's characterisation quite a bit. He effectively raped Cersei because she didn't want him. This never happens in the books. Even if you want to debate whether it was consensual in the books (and it was she says DO ME NOW!), they have sex in the sept because they're grieving, not out of spite because Cersei doesn't give him the acceptance he wants. He tells her she's hateful, and instead of stop loving her and wanting her, he shows to be just as hateful as she is (and it's debatable she's hateful to begin with, she's lost a son!).
Â 
Who is this Jaime? Is he the same Jaime they took so long to turn into a more layered character last season? The one who saved Brienne "more than once" and risked his life in the process? This is some shoddy characterisation right there.
4447	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	Also, if Cersei didn't want sex in that place, at that time, because it wasn't right, that's STILL rape. Happy couples can still have rape occur because it is specific to the situation

Â 
To me that's actually the thing that changes it way more, yes.
In the book I never had the feeling during the scence that Jaime cared if Cersei agreed or not, which makes the TV scence itself more different when it comes to Cersei's character than to Jaime's.
But in the books it's right when he comes back, he basically wants to continue where they left of, like nothing changed, which does not excuse, but explains it.
In the show they already talked, it was already established that a lot has changed between them.

Whether this was rape or not is not really an opinion. She clearly objects saying "stop" multiple times and he continues to force himself on her saying "I don't care." Â It was rape.
I think they might have been going for her only objection to it was the location but that was not even kind of clear. It was rape and now they've ruined Jaime.

She rejects him in the show to play hard to get and assert her power, not because she's disgusted by him after going away for a while and coming back with only one hand.

He forced her, but the real problem she had with it was not sex itself, but having sex on HIS terms instead of HERS. She wanted to use the PROMISE of sex as a reward for killing Tyrion, which is absolutely its own form of violation.
As others pointed out, she said not here and now, not "no I don't want to have sex with you". Her clear intention was to use sex to get Jamie to murder his own brother. She said Jamie HAD to kill Tyrion, then kissed him passionately then pulled away with a VERY calculated look, frankly, cold, then told him again he had to murder Tyrion.

Direct quote
Â 

Â 
"Well, it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for them ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle. Nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters, so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal. And it was very much about the earlier part with Charles (Dance) and the gentle verbal kidnapping of Cersei's last living son. Nikolaj came in and we just went through one physical progression and digression of what they went through, but also how to do it with only one hand, because it was Nikolaj. By the time you do that and you walk through it, the actors feel comfortable going home to think about it. The only other thing I did was that ordinarily, you rehearse the night before, and I wanted to rehearse that scene four days before, so that we could think about everything. And it worked out really well. That's one of my favorite scenes I've ever done."

No what I meant is that the show runners (writer, director, whatever) are now explaining/justifying this scene as "complicated" or "ambiguous" when it is clearly and truly rape andÂ that's what's truly upsetting.
Rape is not a complex issue. There's no such thing as "quasi-rape" or "a little rapey" or "almost rape". Either it's rape or it's not.
The scene cuts as she's saying "it's not right it's not right" in a hopeless voice while Jaimed has her pinned on the ground, is pounding her and saying "I don't care I don't care". It doesn't matter what happens before or what happens after, at the moment the scene cuts Cersei is being raped, it's as simple as that.
The idea that a man could write a straightforward rape scene and thing he's writing a "complex" or "ambiguous" scene (and be proud of it no less) is what's truly disturbing: the bigger issue here is that men have no idea what rape is.

It's not just the directing though. Look at LH the whole time, it doesn't seem like she was said "after a while Cersei is fine with it". She really isn't enjoying it in the slightest.

I don't know whether they're saying it was meant to be consensual just to cover up they fucked up, but it really doesn't come across as consent.

If she's truly disgusted by him, why does she grab him by the head and kiss him passionately? Why does she grab at him and hold him like a lover instead of doing everything she can to push him away?
Â 
I'll tell you why - because the actress, director, and everyone involved in the making of the scene intended for Cersei to be at least partly willing.
4465	Ran	2014-04-21	They aren't "now" explaining/justifying that way. All interviews and promo materials released so far were recorded weeks, even months ago.Will have to wait for someone to say, "Here's so-and-so on the red carpet/talk show/daytime show, lets ask him about this," to see what they say _now_. But before the episode aired, before anyone had seen it beyond the production, HBO, and select media, those are the perspectives they gave.

Â 
Ah, thanks. That is extremely problematic. I really hope Jaime and Cersei have a scene next episode that clearly gets across the idea that this was somewhat normal behavior for them then.
Â 
ETA: Normal and consensual based on a pre-existing agreement on what 'stop' actually means. Couples roleplaying rape is a thing in this world, maybe it is in Westeros too.

J: No.

J: I don't care, I don't care.
Â 
I don't think it was supposed to be rape, but they did a really bad job of portraying it as consensual. In the books she eventually gives in and is all like "yes fuck me sweet brother!", which would have actually worked better in terms of it being a dark, sick moment, I think, because of the sheer depravity of saying that.


Â 
This was my whole issue with the scene.Â  I got what the director was going for, but it wasn't portrayed well at all.Â  Very disappointing.
4470	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-21	For me it wasnt a rape because Cersei wasnt against the sex itself, she was against doing it in a sept. "Please, not here, this is not right."

Â 
It wasn't rape, she just didn't want to have sex with me at that particular place! It wasn't rape, she just didn't want to have sex with me at this particular time! It wasn't rape, she just didn't want to have sex with me in this particular way!
Â 
Seriously, listen to yourselves.
4471	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	If she's truly disgusted by him, why does she grab him by the head and kiss him passionately? Why does she grab at him and hold him like a lover instead of doing everything she can to push him away?
Â 
I'll tell you why - because the actress, director, and everyone involved in the making of the scene intended for Cersei to be at least partly willing.


Â 
When was that? During the scene "things that never happened?". Watch it again, she never kisses him passionately and she most certainly doesn't kiss him when she's under him, telling him "it's not right". In fact, her voice cracks up.
Â 
Â 


They aren't "now" explaining/justifying that way. All interviews and promo materials released so far were recorded weeks, even months ago.
Will have to wait for someone to say, "Here's so-and-so on the red carpet/talk show/daytime show, lets ask him about this," to see what they say _now_. But before the episode aired, before anyone had seen it beyond the production, HBO, and select media, those are the perspectives they gave.


Â 
I'm not saying they're saying it now, but just that the director's initial idea wasn't quite in line what the way the scene ended up being edited.
4472	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-21	Strawman? False equivalence? Reducto ad absurdum?
Â 
Probably one of those, I think. I'm tired.


Â 
Reductio ad absurdum isn't a fallacy.
4473	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	Â 
Ah, thanks. That is extremely problematic. I really hope Jaime and Cersei have a scene next episode that clearly gets across the idea that this was somewhat normal behavior for them then.


Â 
I doubt they will though...how would that even go? "Hey Jaime, just for the record when I say 'no' to you I mean 'yes,' which is why I was so happy we had sex in the Sept, despite my repeated objections." It's pretty impossible to explain this scene away.
4474	Maria Underfoot	2014-04-21	There's a line between rough sex and rape.
The scene in the book is right on that line. Cersei is at first reluctant,Â thenÂ he kisses her -before he penetrates her- and her protests become "meek", and then she gives in, and actually wants Jaime.
The scene in the show crossed that line. There was no warming up, she was basicallyÂ reluctant from start to end.
Â 
And you know, it's annoying because it doesn't make sense. The only purpose it serves is to make Cersei even more pitiful. And that's wrong, because she's not supposed to be pitiful.Â 
They could have just added ONE line to show that Cersei was turned on, rather than hint at it, and require from the viewer to notice her hands or whatever.
4475	nara	2014-04-21	My review, with some thoughts on the scene.
I have been rewatching that scene quite a bit over the weeks. There's four points I would note:
1) As they're slipping down to their knees, it's fairly clear that she actively kisses him back, grabbing at his face... and then pushing him away. But the camera is playing tricks here: when she's kissing back, it suddenly dips down to sort-of-but-not-really obscure, and next its focused on Jaime's hands...
2) ... but at the same time, it sure _looks_ like her hands are fumbling around his waist area too.
3) The final shot of her hand clenching at the cloth is pretty standard iconography in film and television to indicate passionate lovemaking.
4) Taking it to the books, when Bran witnesses Jaime and Cersei having sex, and then again when Jaime has sex with her on his return from King's Landing, Cersei protests... and then gives in. The main difference in this scene as compared to the novels is that Cersei both appears to give in and at the same time continues protesting. It makes it all more ambiguous, and I think this all ties to the changes they've made to Cersei's character on the show.

Â 
I rewatched it this morning and while I agree that it looks slightly more consensual on rewatch, I think it's too subtle for the medium and on the whole is too rapey looking.
Â 
In the books, we have the benefit of Jaime thinking how Cersei always makes him take the initiative, but eventually gives in.Â  We also know that he has been desperate to see her and the way he's surviving the hand loss is by thinking about her and being with her again.Â  Both these thought make his initial persistence over her protests understandable.Â  Then, she actually tells him to "do it now".Â 
Â 
We also have the benefit of

	Spoiler Cersei and Taena Merryweather discussing a man who said yes a thousand times and Cersei saying no a thousand times before finally giving in.

Â Â 
In the show, they usually make things more obvious than in the books because it's too hard to catch on to subtle things on television.Â  This was a bad time to stray from that approach.Â  A simple "Yes, Jaime" or at least stopping of "No" would have been good.
Â 
On the plus side, at least we didn't have to suffer through her moon's blood or Cersei actually calling Jaime "brother" while they're having sex!
4476	Queen of Whores	2014-04-21	It wasn't rape, she just didn't want to have sex with me at that particular place! It wasn't rape, she just didn't want to have sex with me at this particular time! It wasn't rape, she just didn't want to have sex with me in this particular way!
Â 
Seriously, listen to yourselves.

You beat me to saying it. It's getting very disturbing how some people think it's not rape just because she specifies she doesn't want it at this place. If a man were to approach his girlfriend or wife or whatever while she's in the kitchen, and he starts groping her and undressing her, and she says, "no, not here, this isn't right," and he continues, then he is going against her wishes, which is to stop the sex, full stop.
Seriously guys, it's not even debatable at this point.

4477	King of the Road	2014-04-21	I can't believe this discussion is dragging on this long. Even I won't defend the show on this point, they crossed the line and Jaime categorically raped Cersei. Whether or not this matters in the long run or not is another discussion for another episode.
4478	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	Â 
It's not just the directing though. Look at LH the whole time, it doesn't seem like she was said "after a while Cersei is fine with it". She really isn't enjoying it in the slightest.
Â 
I don't know whether they're saying it was meant to be consensual just to cover up they fucked up, but it really doesn't come across as consent.


I can understand how in the heat of the moment when you are filming it you might not think turn out the way it turns out. Â Just like you can write something Â for a essay and a day or so later come back to it and " well that didn't turn out how i thought it did" but I have to assume Â they saw Â the scene lots of time afterward. Â to me it looks likethey failed to portray what they were trying to portray. if they were meaning for it to be consentual.

Â 
Exactly. As if it matters what reason for saying no is, and that's what makes the difference.Â
4480	Fez	2014-04-21	Â 
I doubt they will though...how would that even go? "Hey Jaime, just for the record when I say 'no' to you I mean 'yes,' which is why I was so happy we had sex in the Sept, despite my repeated objections." It's pretty impossible to explain this scene away.


Â 
Well if they have a scene where they don't act like anything is different between them, and if Cersei uses the promise of sex (and not in a traumatized sort of way) to get Jaime to do something like capture Sansa, that would go a long way towards saying this was usual behavioral between them.
Â 
Now, that doesn't mean that that usual behavioral isn't a whole bunch of rape; but at least its a start.
4481	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	You just have to read the Unsullied comments about this scene, Youtube comments, etc....it's rape for them, (as for everyone should).
4482	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	You just have to read the Unsullied comments about this scene, Youtube comments, etc....it's rape for them, (as for everyone should).


Â 
I haven't read any unsullied reaction. What do they think of Jaime now? I bet all character development for him last season is going down the drain.
4483	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	At least my belief that the worst thing the show could do to Jaime by sacrificing every opportunity to build him as a swordsman to give a stark some more fan power (what they did in season 1-2) has been put into context! I was very wrong
4484	marsyao	2014-04-21	It is simply one of the very comman case that the writer think "I am so good", which he, of course more than often, is not
4485	T.C	2014-04-21	Seriously, I know it's not considered polite and proper to say this out loud, but people in this thread aren't just talking about their opinion of a TV show. They're openly confessing their deeply held beliefs about rape, beliefs which they carry into judgments they make in the real world. And people are admitting scary things about themselves and their beliefs.
Â 
Were I a woman, I would feel genuinely unsafe around a lot of people here. None of these views are new to me, I've heard this kind of rape apologism a lot, but it's still deeply unsettling all the same, and the conviction with which people defend these beliefs is disturbing.


I guess you would be scared of being around the director then

Goddamnit. I guess every single thing that happened in season 3 with Jaime is now irrelevant thanks to the show's crew majorly fucking up this one scene by not including one like of dialogue like "yes, do me now," or "I want it." All it would have taken is that to put everyone's minds at ease.
Shiiiit, and I thought the Stannis butchery was bad.

There you go, so a whole season of portraying Jaime as having more layers than what it initially seemed, was for nothing. Hope they're proud!Â

She holds his face and kisses him right before they end up on the floor; and look closely at her hand movements. She alternates between embracing him and making a very feigned effort to resist. Nothing about the way the actress performs suggests to me that she was told to play the role of a rape victim. Instead, she performs like she's been told to play the role of a conflicted lover, not entirely comfortable with the situation yet not entirely unwilling.

4497	James Sucellus	2014-04-21	I can hardly blame the Unsullied. They're not going to be impressed by Jaime keeping his vow to Catelyn now. They're going to still be thinking of that time a few episodes earlier when he raped his grieving sister for no reason.

Colossal fuck up of his character journey and transformation, which is one of my favourite things about ASOIAF.Â

4499	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	Â 
LOL.
Â 
Is there anything "complex" about defenestration?
Â 
Defenestration is bad. Â Rape is bad.
Â 
But that doesn't mean that complex people don't do both good and bad things.


Â 
Of course they do, but does that mean that HBO should have Jaime commit a heinous act of violence and degradation in total violation of his love for his sister and personal code? No, of course not. That's the point here. GRRM has characters do good and bad in accordance with who, what, and where they are. It makes sense. For instance, Drogo being rough with Dany - not as rough in the books as on the show, but still - makes sense given his who he is and where he's from. Jaime's rape of Cersei, however, is grotesquely and gratuitously forced into the story, serving no purpose whatsoever and defying a major part of his character.

I don't think this is comparable to the way they screwed up Stannis though.
Show!Stannis has always been consistent. A bad character maybe and a poor adaptation of Book!Stannis certainly, but in the show universe at least his development is consistent.
Ignoring the fact that this scene is an utterly failure as an adaptation, it goes against everything the show has been doing to Jaime all throughout season 3 and makes absolutely no sense in universe.Â
4503	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-21	I just don't really know what to say about this scene. Â This was a great episode, aside from this scene and it was so bad that it is putting a damper on the rest of the episode for me. Â I've never been a big Jaime fan, but this really is truly at odds with his character. Â Also, because of the way it was shot and the director's very strange comments on it - it leaves just a teeny tiny bit of ambiguity so people can argue that it wasn't rape when it clearly was rape. And then you have the yuckiness of reading all these vile ideas that people have about this issue, sadly including some people disliking Cersei so much that they are okay with her being raped.Â 
Â 
Then there is the whole issue of it shattering Jaime's character what we know from the books and what we've seen on the show. It just doesn't add up that he would do that to Cersei. I wanted them to include this scene from the books, but they should have made it consensual and made it very clearly consensual. Â I feel like they did this on purpose to court controversy and conversation at the sacrifice of the source material and these two characters' storylines.Â

4507	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	Also, when Jaime "defenestrated" it was in character and meant to make him irredeemable. That's what made his redemption so good to read/watch. He's meant to have developed, instead he's taken leap backward in one scene and without the reasoning he has for Bran

Â 
They've mishandled the Lannisters' moral ambiguity in general. Tyrion is Jesus, Jaime is as good or bad as D&D need him to be, and Cersei had her fangs pulled way back in S1.

Tywin has been portrayed much better IMO.
4509	Fez	2014-04-21	Well, this is interesting. Here's a different interview with Alex Graves:
Â 


This feels like Tywin's episode. What was filming his scene with him and Tommen like?
Â 
That was one of the greatest days I've ever had filming. To film Charles (Dance) kidnapping Lena's son with words for three minutes of monologue â<U+0080><U+0093> and to have Lena keeping up with him at the highest bar of acting possible with no words at all â<U+0080><U+0093> was a joy. It was directorial crack to do that scene. It was one of my favorite scenes I've ever shot. It's almost like a build from Ordinary People meets a Hitchcock movie, because you're sitting here going "this is so dysfunctional and bizarre." She's a wreck. Tywin is really going on about this historical stuff, and you slowly start to go "he's kidnapping her only boy," because she's not going to have him anymore. And then he succeeds, and then Jaime comes in and he rapes her. That was like â<U+0080><U+0093> you read the scene and go "Wait, who's directing this

4515	Hippocras	2014-04-21	No I am saying it is a fundamentally ambivalent scene.
He forced her, but the real problem she had with it was not sex itself, but having sex on HIS terms instead of HERS. She wanted to use the PROMISE of sex as a reward for killing Tyrion, which is absolutely its own form of violation.
As others pointed out, she said not here and now, not "no I don't want to have sex with you". Her clear intention was to use sex to get Jamie to murder his own brother. She said Jamie HAD to kill Tyrion, then kissed him passionately then pulled away with a VERY calculated look, frankly, cold, then told him again he had to murder Tyrion.
4516	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-21	The only thing about this episode I really came here to talk through was this scene. What is the pay off here? Why go through the lengths they went through in season 3 to turn public opinion around on this guy and follow the same redemption route with him as in the books, only to shit all over it with this one act. Sure in the books having sex in the same room as Joff's corpse was in bad taste, but at least it was consensual and could be rationed that they were both after comfort in their time of grief. But Cersei was clearly in a state of shock and deep sadness and did not want this in the show.
Â 
The only thing this is possibly going towards is as someone said, they want the audience to clearly be choosing a side when it comes to Brienne, Jaime, and Stoneheart. Which also leads me to believe they may change the Tysha story to reveal Jaime was really on Tywin's side about all of it.
4517	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	Tarly hangs rapist? Â Isn't he the same guy who said Brienne could use a good hard raping?

It doesn't add up he would do that to anyone. Even if we discard his book counterpart who is clearly horrified by rape, show!Jaime risked his life for Brienne, a complete stranger, when she was about to be raped. He gave her advice, he said he'd rather die than be raped if he were a woman, and came up with that absurd lie about the sapphires. What they're doing with Jaime now is so inconsistent with his characterisation all throughout last season.
4520	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-21	Rape is worse than fucking your sister. The point however is that Jaime was on an upswing he's supposed to be redeeming himself inch by inch. Rape now sets him back again for no reason.

Well that at least makes me feel better about Graves's interpretation of consent...
Â 
I was reading tweets from a GoT podcaster who was asking where this outrage was in S1 (Drogo), and she also said "I may be wholly unqualified to talk about this and please feel free to tell me I'm out of line, but I would be surprised of some of the "out of character" outrage comes from those who fetishize the "redeeming a bad boy" plot. That's not how Martin's world operates." I think that's an interesting point, and I do think this scene is troubling in the book, but not this level of troubling.Â

4522	Hoo	2014-04-21	This show doesn't exist in a vacuum. It was written by people who live in the same world as you and I. And they wrote a rape scene, and then said it wasn't rape. And people in this thread are trying to argue that it isn't rape. And even if you're really really desperate to ignore the real world, rape is still considered a bad thing in the series. So I have no idea what point you were imagining yourself making.


I am perfectly fine with what he did within the context of the drama. Â It does not devalue his character one bit for me. Â It's between the two of them as far as the characters go. Â All I see is a dude gaining power, and a woman losing it, a bitch by all accounts, and that is just fine by me as far as the series goes.
4523	Tankbuster	2014-04-21	After seeing this scene, I was reading AFFC. Then it hit me:
The first thing that Shitmouth says after seeing Jaime is "Fuck me Jaime Lannister, It's ............ fuck me bloody with a spear." That will be some grimdark WH40K type stuff if shown in HBO.
4524	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Tarly hangs rapist? Â Isn't he the same guy who said Brienne could use a good hard raping?


Â 
Sadly, both of these facts are right.
4525	T.C	2014-04-21	I'll say this again, people need to stop over analyzing people because of what's been said in this thread. Do not forget that the director also does not see this as rape, and while it still was a poorly written scene, the people in here that you are accusing of being 'rapists' are probably just trying to dwell into the POV of what the director was trying to get across. It's not like the director stated that it was rape and then people still tried to deny it from then on. Calling people rapists over a tv show is crossing the line.

Hear that men? It's okay to rape a woman if she's a bitch.
4528	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	The only thing about this episode I really came here to talk through was this scene. What is the pay off here? Why go through the lengths they went through in season 3 to turn public opinion around on this guy and follow the same redemption route with him as in the books, only to shit all over it with this one act. Sure in the books having sex in the same room as Joff's corpse was in bad taste, but at least it was consensual and could be rationed that they were both after comfort in their time of grief. But Cersei was clearly in a state of shock and deep sadness and did not want this in the show.
Â 
The only thing this is possibly going towards is as someone said, they want the audience to clearly be choosing a side when it comes to Brienne, Jaime, and Stoneheart. Which also leads me to believe they may change the Tysha story to reveal Jaime was really on Tywin's side about all of it.


Â 
I thought about that as well, but then why make Brienne in love with Jaime? Brienne is torn between doing what 
	Spoiler UnCat asks her and what she feels for Jaime... If we were just meant to root for Brienne to give him to UnCat and wash her hands off him, why keep that detail from the books?

Â 
I'm not sure they quite know what they're doing with Jaime at this point. The whole story seem all over the place.

It doesn't add up he would do that to anyone. Even if we discard his book counterpart who is clearly horrified by rape, show!Jaime risked his life for Brienne, a complete stranger, when she was about to be raped. He gave her advice, he said he'd rather die than be raped if he were a woman, and came up with that absurd lie about the sapphires. What they're doing with Jaime now is so inconsistent with his characterisation all throughout last season.


Â 
Yes, I agree with everything you said. Â This is just disturbing. Â I'm going to have to skip this scene to re-watch the episode. It's so off-base and I feel a huge mistake by the show-runners. Â This is worse than any of the changes they have made to any of the other characters on the show so far.

Actually her grief was only part of it, the other part was several clear, calculating looks when she saw her power being threatened. She was grieving yes, but not enough to overwhelm her calculating, power hungry mind.
We see it with Tywin, when she clearly notices what he is doing by manipulating Tommen to be his puppet, which means not HER puppet. She sees what he is doing and resents it, and it matters to her more in that moment than dead Joffrey does.
Then we see it again in this controversial sex scene when she kisses Jamie as part of an attempt to get him to murder Tyrion. 
Don't portray her as some kind of pure victim here. She never was and never will be.

Arguing against rape is fine, but calling people rapists over a tv show is a bit over dramatic and unnecessary, especially when the director has made it clear his poorly written scene wasn't supposed to come across as rape.

She didn't need a Tywin speel to Tommen to know that's how Tywin operates, she's seen it her whole life. She already knows Tywin is going to make sure he has a firm hand on the seven kingdoms. To me, it looked like Cersei just wanted some time to herself away from 'game-mode' fr a while, after all it is clearly stated that one of her only redeeming features is that she actually does love her kids.

Except in that other interview where he said it was rape.
4539	Miryana	2014-04-21	I've been vocal about my hate for Jaime just about every time I've seen a thread about his redemption, yet I still think this is an awful, out of character choice for the adaptation to make. It gets even worse reading the many, many comments here and elsewhere expressing surprise at the idea that a scene where a woman keeps on saying no could have been interpreted as rape or contempt at posters who are treating it seriously instead of with cool indifference and endless references to the importance of ambiguity and interpretation.
Â 
At least in the second interview linked the director calls it rape. On the show, Cersei has made it clear to Jaime that she's not interested in sex right now, so Jaime can't assume that she'd welcome his advances; he's been back for some time and she's been unwilling. If the intention was "rape that turns into consent" it was an extremely difficult and problematic idea that was executed horribly - a distressed-sounding Cersei's "don't" and Jaime's "I don't care" are the last damned lines in the scene! In the episode, it looks like Jaime gets frustrated at being constantly denied sex and takes what he wants without Cersei ever agreeing to it.
Â 


Â 
A part of me thinks this is done to make Tyrion look better through the power of juxtaposition. Tyrion might 
	Spoiler kill his father and gf
, but hey at least he's no rapist!Â  

Â 
I agree. But it's so strange, why on earth do we have to put up with a Saint Tyrion stripped of all his edges if they're prepared to go this black with Jaime?

I never called anyone a rapist. I simply made inferences based on what people said. For instance, if someone said "if I could, I would totally kill a person", and if, given the context, I had compelling reason to believe they were 100% sincere and held this belief, I would infer from that that this person is a potential murderer, as they've expressed that, under the right circumstances, they would commit murder. This is not extreme. This is basic logic. I wouldn't, in that situation, be calling them murderers; simply very probable potential murderers.
Â 
But again, I'm done. Saying that rape is wrong and that condoning rape is wrong is apparently not constructive, and I wouldn't want to interfere with people saying how women deserve to be raped if they're a "bitch".

But to me some people are also "whitewashing" bookJaime a little concerning that scene, I strongly beleive that bookJaime would not have stopped even if Cersei wouldn't have started agreeing, so this whole "bookJaime would never have raped her and in the show they changed that" somehow doesn't really speak to me.
4544	Fez	2014-04-21	What other interview?


Â 
Here
Â 


This feels like Tywin's episode. What was filming his scene with him and Tommen like?
Â 
That was one of the greatest days I've ever had filming. To film Charles (Dance) kidnapping Lena's son with words for three minutes of monologue -- and to have Lena keeping up with him at the highest bar of acting possible with no words at all -- was a joy. It was directorial crack to do that scene. It was one of my favorite scenes I've ever shot. It's almost like a build from Ordinary People meets a Hitchcock movie, because you're sitting here going, "This is so dysfunctional and bizarre." She's a wreck. Tywin is really going on about this historical stuff, and you slowly start to go, "He's kidnapping her only boy," because she's not going to have him anymore. And then he succeeds, and then Jaime comes in and he rapes her. That was like -- you read the scene and go, "Wait, who's directing this?

It's out of character for show Jaime too. And I agree that the show should be treated as a separate work. That has no bearing on the utter awfulness of what has happened. Especially as they are presumably still going to go for the Jaime redemption route

Â 
After reading this and watching the scene a few times, the only thing I can think is that the show-runners interpreted the book's scene as rape. And there's an argument to be made, even if I disagree with that reading. The fact is, Martin doesn't write straight-forward redemption arcs, and that we may be glossing over some of Book!Jaime's darker points. If the show wants to highlight that, okay, at least I can understand it.
Â 
What I can't understand is people saying this scene wasn't rape. It was. I can't keep arguing in circles about that point ,and I am truly disturbed (as a woman and a person) at some of the sentiments being expressed here.

4550	digiFemme	2014-04-21	I don't get why they filmed this scene this way. Was it to emphasize Cersei's role as a sympathetic character even more? She's already been shown as a lot more complex than the books and as a victim of Westerosi society (in a manner of speaking) but this was just overkill. It was extremely out of character for Jaime to do such a thing. Him killing his relative in S2 was bad enough but you could at least reason that it was similar to how he pushed Bran out the window in that he was a person who was willing to do all sorts of things for people he loved. This didn't fit anywhere.
Â 
He's no nice guy but he'd never rape anyone- least of all his sister (who he supposedly loved more than anyone he wasted his entire life for this woman) He also saved Brienne from getting raped earlier and admitted it was a fate worse than death. Then he does this? Really, what were they thinking?Â

It's his POV and from how he forces himself on her and in his own mind states that he didn't hear her objections it might not be rape at that point technically, but spreading her legs, taking of her clothes etc. is still happening before Cersei giving in and that is at least sexual abuse to me.
So yeah, of course it's an opinion, but I just find it a little strange that this is such a huge different for people. As a woman I find this also a little scary that apparently up to this point of undressing a women and forcing your hand between her legs is not really considred "that bad"

I think that's a really good point you make about in season 3 Jaime saves Brienne from being raped herself. At the time Jaime and Brienne were at best just indifferent about each other but he still recognises he doesn't want even his enemies getting raped, fast forward to him raping the person closest to him in the world, go figure the logic there.
4555	FaolchAo	2014-04-21	For those who haven't seen Nikolaj's take on the matter:
Â 
Â 

Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a moment in the scene where the hand comes up and she has this face of disgust, and Jaime says, Why have the Gods made me love a hateful woman?â<U+0080><U+009D> says Coster-Waldau. â<U+0080><U+009C>He wants her, and wants everything to go back to the way it was. But thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no way back.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
And then Jaime attacks Cersei, ripping her dress. She yells, â<U+0080><U+009C>Jaime, not hereâ<U+0080>¦pleaseâ<U+0080>¦stop it!â<U+0080><U+009D> Her objections fall on deaf ears, and he throws her first against the altar of their dead son, and then to the ground beside it.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>To understand the psychology behind it, and why he goes as far as he does, was really difficult,â<U+0080><U+009D> says Coster-Waldau. â<U+0080><U+009C>To me it became, When does physical desire take over? Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of those things where heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been holding it back for so long, and then out of anger he grabs her, and instinct takes over, and he lets loose. He says, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care. He wants to not care. He has to connect to her, and he knows this is the most fucked up way for it to happen, but in that moment, he knows itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all he can do. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an act of powerlessness.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>It was tough to shoot, as well,â<U+0080><U+009D> says Coster-Waldau. â<U+0080><U+009C>There is significance in that scene, and it comes straight from the booksâ<U+0080><U+0094>itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s George R.R. Martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mind at play. It took me awhile to wrap my head around it, because I think that, for some people, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just going to look like rape. The intention is that itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not just that; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s about two people whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve had this connection for so many years, and much of it is physical, and much of it has had to be kept secret, and this is almost the last thing left now. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s him trying to force her back and make him whole again because of his stupid hand.â<U+0080><U+009D>

4557	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	Â 
Well that at least makes me feel better about Graves's interpretation of consent...
Â 
I was reading tweets from a GoT podcaster who was asking where this outrage was in S1 (Drogo), and she also said "I may be wholly unqualified to talk about this and please feel free to tell me I'm out of line, but I would be surprised of some of the "out of character" outrage comes from those who fetishize the "redeeming a bad boy" plot. That's not how Martin's world operates." I think that's an interesting point, and I do think this scene is troubling in the book, but not this level of troubling.Â 


Â 
It was a troubling scene in the book, but it was about both Jaime and Cersei. Here, it is all about Jaime.
Â 
I was thinking about how they could have played it better. In the books was have all of Jaime's internal monologue prior to the event which let the reader know exactly how much of a sexual manipulator Cersei was - and the scene played out in line with that.
Â 
On screen however, we lack all that foreknowledge, and it is depicted as an act by Jaime, not by both of them.
Â 
----
Â 
I think a better way would be for them just to have been kissing passionately with a hint they were going to have sex. In the books its about two fucked up individuals having sex next to their son's corpse. All that has been lost and nothing comes out of this except 'Jaime Lannister is a monster'.Â
4558	NeilSpoon	2014-04-21	It's amazing how many ppl get upset about a rape scene (which in fact wasn't a rape scene, as it was confirmed by the writers/director that it was consensual*), yet in the previous episode a girl gets hunted, shot with an arrow and ripped to pieces by dogs. Nobody bats an eyelid. 
I also don't think it's bad for the Jamie character. The redemption will continue as the series continues. He's nowhere near redeemed yet. 
*I accept that better directing/editing would have improved this scene.
4559	Cas Stark	2014-04-21	I agree.Â  Almost every interaction Jamie has with Cersie is wrong.

Â 
Exactly. Â Poor Cersei, what a shame that her twin brother turned out to be such a jerk. Â D&D must really love Lena to whitewash the character to such an extent. Â At least with Dinklage we know he's GRRM favorite character.

Subtlety and nuance have their place, but not in a scene involving rape, unless it were being used to expose rape culture for the vile hypocritical mess that it is. That is not the case with this scene.
4561	kishefmakherin	2014-04-21	It's out of character for show Jaime too. And I agree that the show should be treated as a separate work. That has no bearing on the utter awfulness of what has happened. Especially as they are presumably still going to go for the Jaime redemption route


Â 
It's out of character Jaime the book character. Jaime the TV show character has only a small part of 10 hour-long episodes to get from point A to point B. In the books, we get page after page of events he is involved in from his point of view, his memories, thoughts, judgments included. And we also see in pages of others (usually Tyrion or Cersei) their vision of Jaime and his past. I remember how people's opinion changed of him when saving Brienne. Suddenly, he Jaime was a hero. You'd think he single-handedly saved Westeros from the Others. So, my guess is that the director/script writers want a sharper break between Cersei and him, as well as potentially providing more of an impetus for having Cersei going all completely crazy. And I'm guessing the bland-acting Jaime (the character, not the actor) is not really going to suddenly leave the city unless there's some serious drama leading up to the break-up.
4562	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Â 
After reading this and watching the scene a few times, the only thing I can think is that the show-runners interpreted the book's scene as rape. And there's an argument to be made, even if I disagree with that reading. The fact is, Martin doesn't write straight-forward redemption arcs, and that we may be glossing over some of Book!Jaime's darker points. If the show wants to highlight that, okay, at least I can understand it.
Â 
What I can't understand is people saying this scene wasn't rape. It was. I can't keep arguing in circles about that point ,and I am truly disturbed (as a woman and a person) at some of the sentiments being expressed here.


Â 
This is what I think the writers thought, but, then, it would be extremly BAD READING. It was conseunsual in the books.
4563	ovis alba	2014-04-21	At the time Jaime and Brienne were at best just indifferent about each other but he still recognises he doesn't want even his enemies getting raped, fast forward to him raping the person closest to him in the world, go figure the logic there.


Â 
I think that's part of the ambiguity which is in all the characters.Â  I think for Jaime (!) what he has with Cersei just can not be rape, because of their relationship and it's complexity, to him it's part of their "relationship" and part of it being difficult and part of this love-hate thing they have with each other.
4564	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	Â 
It was a troubling scene in the book, but it was about both Jaime and Cersei. Here, it is all about Jaime.
Â 
I was thinking about how they could have played it better. In the books was have all of Jaime's internal monologue prior to the event which let the reader know exactly how much of a sexual manipulator Cersei was - and the scene played out in line with that.
Â 
On screen however, we lack all that foreknowledge, and it is depicted as an act by Jaime, not by both of them.
Â 
----
Â 
I think a better way would be for them just to have been kissing passionately with a hint they were going to have sex. In the books its about two fucked up individuals having sex next to their son's corpse. All that has been lost and nothing comes out of this except 'Jaime Lannister is a monster'.Â 


Â 
Completely agree. They've really flattened Cersei's character as it is, so watching her arc moving forward is going to be interesting. But you're right that there wasn't much of another take-away from it.
Â 
A side-note, but keep in mind Cersei's had a mini-arc this season of going on a rampage against the lecherous Pycelle, to the point of defending another woman against him to. It kind of makes the unwanted contact from Jaime in this episode all the more problematic and poignant.
4565	James Sucellus	2014-04-21	Remember folks: having sex over the body of your dead son-by-incest is only bad if you're a bit too forceful about it.


Â 
Consensual sex with a lover is preferable to fucking rape, yes. It's even worse that this act is given to a character who would clearly never in a million years rape anybody, whilst the shady-as-hell Tyrion who DOES fantasise of raping Cersei, is made out to be a white knight.
Â 
Christ, I hate this.

It's his POV and from how he forces himself on her and in his own mind states that he didn't hear her objections it might not be rape at that point technically, but spreading her legs, taking of her clothes etc. is still happening before Cersei giving in and that is at least sexual abuse to me.
So yeah, of course it's an opinion, but I just find it a little strange that this is such a huge different for people. As a woman I find this also a little scary that apparently up to this point of undressing a women and forcing your hand between her legs is not really considred "that bad"


Â 
Are you referring to the book? It was clearly consensual there. Just read the part and you can see that it was. The point is that Jaime wasn't present at the wedding. He's been dying to see his sister, misses her terribly (and she misses him too); when he finally gets to King's Landing she's the first thing he seeks out. After being separated for a long while they can't get enough of each other (even if Cersei was grieving) so they're at it right next to their son's corpse in an awful way. And that is bad enough...but not like this. This something else entirely.Â 
Â 
Also, this isn't the first time the TV producers have changed a consensual scene- remember Drogo/Dany?Â 
Â 
I honestly think they should reshoot this scene. It was awful. Stick to the books please.Â

Â 
I read it, several times today, because after the scene I wanted to remind myself what it was in the book. And yes, in the end it was consensual, but to me it is also made very clear in the chapter that Jaime didn't care if it was. The only reason he doesn't rape Cersei in the end is because she (!)Â  "changes her mind", not because he would have stopped.
4569	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-21	Â (which in fact wasn't a rape scene, as it was confirmed by the writers/director that it was consensual*), yet in the previous episode a girl gets hunted, shot with an arrow and ripped to pieces by dogs. Nobody bats an eyelid.
Â 


Â 
Please show where there was any consent given in the scene.
Â 
As for the Ramsay reference, that is a false equivalence.
Â 
Book Ramsay = Monster
Show Ramsay = Monster
Â 
Book corpse scene = consent
Show corpse scene = no consent.
Â 
The fact they said there was consent does mean there was actually consent.
4570	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	It's amazing how many ppl get upset about a rape scene (which in fact wasn't a rape scene, as it was confirmed by the writers/director that it was consensual*), yet in the previous episode a girl gets hunted, shot with an arrow and ripped to pieces by dogs. Nobody bats an eyelid.
I also don't think it's bad for the Jamie character. The redemption will continue as the series continues. He's nowhere near redeemed yet.
*I accept that better directing/editing would have improved this scene.


For me at least it's not that it happened, it's who did it. Ramsay hunting down a girl is in line with what we know of the character in both the book and show that Ramsay is one fucked up person. If The Mountain were to rape a girl, while i would be creeped out by the scene due to me being creeped out by rape in general. I would not have complained or said anything about negative about it. The Mountain is a rapist piece of shit. While Jaime is a lot things, he is not a rapist.
Â 
so even if they said "it was consentual" it was a botched job, cause it came off as anything but.Â

Â 
If it need to be explained by writer/director off the scene, then they just screwed up on their job, it is pretty obvious what it was on the scene.
4572	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	I agree.Â  Almost every interaction Jamie has with Cersie is wrong.
Â 
This rape bit,
Â 
Then they had Jamie begging Cersie to have things go back to the way they where but Cersie says no because she and things have changed.Â  When in reality its Jamie who is changed. And Cersie wanting things to go back to the way they were.Â  Cersie wanting to continue to use Jamie as her puppet pulling his strings.


Â 
This, exactly. In the books she expects him to be as he was, but he's changed too much. This is happening because they changed the timeline, and as a result they're regressing Jaime, but he's coming across awfully, much worse than in the books. Again, book!Jaime is far from being a nice dude, but in the show he's so much worse.
Â 
And I hate what they do with Cersei. Poor Cersei, victim of everything. The ambivalence of her position, of being an abusive person who's been abused is poof, gone!
4573	solidviper	2014-04-21	I was really uncomfortable watching the scene. I didn't see where Cersei gave any type of consent, but maybe I missed something? Â I feel like they ruined Jaime's development for no good reason. It's really weird.Â 
Â 
And yeah I know that him pushing Bran was a terrible thing, but he's supposed to have grown into a better person since S1.Â
4574	Aoife	2014-04-21	I guess it goes to show that those who argue that the show needs less nuance and subtlety and grey areas than the books because audiences can't handle complexity would be right in this specific occasion.


Â 
I don't think that's fair. I'm sure there are people for whom it's true, but it's not all of the objectors. Especially in a scene like this, where, frankly, you can't count on people re-watching for potential subtlety. Jaime was (IMO) absolutely sexually assaulting Cersei at the start of the same scene in the book -- she had said no, and he didn't stop. However, by the time penetration came about, she was saying 'yes', and 'come to me', and all the rest. While I see the argument that she said 'hurry' just to get it over with, that scene read more to me that they're just that messed up, and she was totally willing at that point.
Â 
Here, she says no, he doesn't stop, she keeps saying 'this isn't right', he says 'I don't care.' It's arguable that she's clawing at his clothes, but I didn't see that when I watched, even after reading the first reactions and looking out for it. It could still have been a completely fucked up scene had she said 'we shouldn't... but hurry', or 'this isn't right, but I want you', or even had she just been shown a little more clearly reaching for his falls or lifting up her skirt or doing anything to indicate that she was a willing (if messed up) participant. Lots of people can't watch a rape scene even once; trying to say 'watch it again, for where maybe she's doing XYZ and maybe that means she's actually willing despite her words' is probably not going to get far.
Â 
[There are also the options that: 1) Â she's doing this deliberately because she wants Jaime to feel like she's raped her, and is just messing with his head, but I don't think either book or show Cersei would ever actually go through with that, or 2) she wants the reconnection as well, but feels that she can't openly rescind her rejection of him, so keeps protesting until he does the deed regardless. Twistedly, of course, they're both still rape, as from Jaime's POV he's having sex with her despite her protests. However, given the hamfistedness of large parts of the previous 3 series, I doubt it will end up being either of those scenarios. I'm willing to see if they address it at all later, or even have an obvious effect on the Jaime/Cersei relationship, but I think a lot of people will consider this too far. Yes, even more than the other rapes and all of the murders and other violence.]
4575	Dicer	2014-04-21	Yes, and it also starts being problematic when they have one of the most 'anti-rape' character do it. We didn't need it is an understatement . What we needed was them sticking to the bloody books.Jaime is the most 'anti-rape' character in the book? When did this fallacy come about?There are plenty of other characters who are more anti-rape than Jaime. Dany for example who stood against the Dothraki to stop rape or Stannis.Jaime is the guy who stood by when Aerys raped his wife. Who did nothing when Tyrion's 13 yr old wife was gang raped. Who stood by and did nothing except wish everyone a good trip when poor Jeyne Poole was send off to marry the sadistic Ramsay Snow.Jaime, coward that he is, is only anti-rape when there are no risks involved in it for him.

4576	ser benjamin	2014-04-21	I have a few thoughts here.
1, Â It was rapier than the book. Â NOT as bad as Dany's wedding night (which was a pretty sexy book scene.... and an uncomfortable rape tv scene.) I think in the book, it was still a very disturbing and dark/taboo sex scene where Jamie was the aggressor. Â Â 
Â 
2. I dont say this lightly, Â  but rape and consent in Westeros are not the same things as in our real world. Â One cant apply the same morals.... (anyone who is, in real life, anti death penalty should be upset at Ned, Robb, Arya, etc.. right?) Â Â 
For example, In Wildingling (and to an extend Dothraki) culture, raping a woman is the same as marrying her.. (thought being, if you can do it without losing your life/manhood, you're strong enough to father her children)
Â Â  We're reminded over and over again how "true knights" behave when sacking a city. Â  Even Cersie casually comments on how many of her dearly beloved handmaidens will be raped if the Red Keep falls.
Â OF COURSE I, with my Planet Earth sensibilities and 2014 attitudes find that awful, but compared to the things that "honorable" men do every day in Westeros, Â "questionable consent" with a woman who has been your long-time lover (therefor "claimed") is FAR from the worst thing one can do. Â  Â  Â I would argue that even if Cersie was the aggressor, the SETTING is still the worst part of that scene, and that was unchanged. Â Â

Rewatch the scene. Don't focus on Jaime, but instead look carefully where Cersei's lips and hands go.
Â 
Either Lena Headey is the worst actress ever at playing a rape victim,or she's doing a brilliant job of playing a lover who is both turned on by Jaime's forcefulness and uncomfortable with the fact that they're doing it right next to their dead son.
4578	Ran	2014-04-21	He gets kicked in the stump of his arm, making him pass out from the pain, when he first intervenes to stop Brienne from being raped. So that's untrue, that he only takes that stance when he's not under threat.I don't know if he's the "most anti-rape" character in the books -- I'm sure there are actually a lot of female characters ahead of him on that score -- but he certainly shows a strong lack of inclination or tolerance for it.

4579	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-21	It's so refreshing to see people other than us Stanfans outraged at their portrayal of a character (we've still gotten the worse end of the stick though, I assure you). I offer you all my condolences. Definitely seemed a bit out of character for Jaime, (not that he isn't a piece of shit) to rape the woman he loves next to the corpse of their dead child. The scene where they have grieving sex in the sept is one of the most iconic in all of SoS, but it's iconic because Jaime has freshly arrived home with Brienne, and thus their love-making is their form reunion. Here she has been evading his advances, and the sequence becomes total and utter rape. Very disappointing, because while I find Jaime to be a distasteful individual, I do in fact enjoy his character transformation and that has been injured here. He becomes a man with a moral compass who still understands how the world works. I think that's still more than possible for them to achieve, considering how sympathetic they've made him throughout the tv series, but this scene is a major setback.
4580	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-21	FWIW, my non-bookreader husband thought it was rape and was like WTF. Then he said "I guess he has to hit rock bottom before being redeemed". He asked me if that scene was in the books and I said yes, but it wasn't rapey.
My take on the book scene is that it was consensual, she says "do me now". I thought the point of it was to show how sick and twisted their love was. The whole thing is fucked up, she's says "sweet brother do me", they are having sex by the body of their dead incest son, and she's on her period. Not exactly a romantic scene. Jaime starts to see their relationship for what it is, starting the journey away from Cersei.
Â 
ETA - I stopped watching the show Rescue Me when Denis Leary's character raped his estranged wife. I was so disgusted and the show seemed to play it in that "well, she didn't kick him in the balls or break a vase over his head, so not rape". The Jaime/Cersei scene feels the same way to me. I love ASOIAF and the show so much that I won't stop watching, but initially I feel disgust. I think my knowledge of how the book scene went down keeps me from believing it was all-out rape.

Â 
We shouldn't have to "look carefully"...because most people won't look carefully, they're going to see it the way it played out in real time which was as a rape scene. Â D&D aren't good at subtle, and this is another case in point.
4582	digiFemme	2014-04-21	Â 
I read it, several times today, because after the scene I wanted to remind myself what it was in the book. And yes, in the end it was consensual, but to me it is also made very clear in the chapter that Jaime didn't care if it was. The only reason he doesn't rape Cersei in the end is because she (!)Â  "changes her mind", not because he would have stopped.


Â 
No, Jaime didn't care about the location and whether or not they got caught. Read the entire thing. After it happens, Cersei gently chides him because 'their father might have seen them.' Her only worry was getting caught- it's practically a theme whenever they get together. They always have to sneak around and Cersei is the one more mindful of the place whereas Jaime is more reckless. Exactly like the scene earlier when he pushed Bran off the tower. Cersei was concerned about the place, Jaime wasn't. By the time they see each other in the sept again, Jaime is willing to announce to the whole world that they're together but Cersei wants none of that.
There's no indication whatsoever that Jaime would have forced it if Cersei was crying and begging him not to. The book makes it clear that she's practically the only person he cares about at that point. He doesn't even have any love for any* of his kids. It's all Cersei. It doesn't make sense to me that he'd hurt her that way. Â
4583	The Red Haired Viper	2014-04-21	I just watched it again, and there definitely is no indication (to me at least) that Cersei is consenting. It definitely messed up the character for my unsullied girlfriend, who really liked Jamie but thought that was absolutely unforgivable of him.
4584	Ran	2014-04-21	But then what you're saying is that no, it did not convey a rape, it just did it at first blush and for most people first impressions is all that counts.We have people in this thread calling the original version of the scene a rape as well. So where do we end up? Are they right, and is everyone else wrong? Or should we just try and see the intent behind the actions and, deciphering those, go from there?For my part -- and it's strange for me to be the person saying this when I'm grumbled about in various corners of the internet for being too critical -- I'd think one should give the director and actors the benefit of the doubt. They aimed to convey a certain thing, and maybe it failed for you, but still they had a specific intentio.Simply imagine the scene playing out in a way that fits that intent within the boundaries of your perception, and go on.(Now, whether the directors and actors had a different opinion of the scene than the producers, I don't really know. Benioff's remark in Inside the Episode doesn't address what Graves and the actors were trying to achieve. Was he unaware? Was he aware but disagreed? Then we need to figure out the intent Benioff and Weiss had, as well.)
4585	James Sucellus	2014-04-21	It's so refreshing to see people other than us Stanfans outraged at their portrayal of a character (we've still gotten the worse end of the stick though, I assure you).Â 


Â 
I'm a huge Stannis fan too, but I disagree. Stannis in the show is essentially a completely different character, so it's less jarring having him act like a dick for no reason, because he always acts like a dick for no reason in the show. Having a largely book-faithful adaptation of a POV character suddenly take an insane detour in to WTF, insanely-out-of-character Â territory, is far more jolting.Â 
Â 
I mean... Jaime raping Cersei.. what the hell were the writers even thinking when they wrote that? Social media has exploded in outrage, even from show-only viewers. It doesn't fit with anything they've seen him do for the past season and a bit.
4586	ser benjamin	2014-04-21	Apparently it doesnt matter what their intent was. What matters is how anonymous people who don't care to look for details interpret something the very first time they see it..... rule 1 of the internet Â /snark. Â
4587	Sand11751	2014-04-21	The only reason I could understand the relevance of changing what was consensual in the books into rape for TV viewers was to show how far Jaime has sunk. He's lost the hand that made him one of Westeros' best swordsman, in effect losing his identity. His love for his sister defined what he's done from the start of the book ("The things I do for love") and now she's pushing him away. He's lost the two most important aspects that made him Jaime Lannister. It can only be up from here, but this last bit was done in a ham-fisted kind of way.
Â 
I suppose the showrunners thought they needed this logical break with Cersei in the aftermath of the rape that I guess will comeÂ now. But I had to wonder if it was really necessary. Jaime wasn't a paragon of virtue to begin with - show watchers should know who they're dealing with by now. I don't care how many likely rapes or bears he saves Brienne from. He fucked his sister and fathered three children with her! He pushed Bran out of a window! He killed his own cousin! He's spot on beside Joffrey's body - we see Cersei's grief, but Joffrey's death doesn't mean shit to Jaime except perhaps for how the loss might hurt Cersei. She initiates the kiss, but backs away from it, so he literallyÂ forces the issue.Â Did D&D really think viewers needed the rape like a 2X4 over theÂ head to figure out Jamie is a fucked up guy with a long road to redemption in front of him?
Â 
What I don't believe though, is thatÂ the rape has made that impossible for him to begin that arc, but it did serve to show him at the lowest of the low. And I thought being penned up two seasons ago and bearing his soul to Brienne last season was bad enough. Â Â
4588	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-21	But then what you're saying is that no, it did not convey a rape, it just did it at first blush and for most people first impressions is all that counts.

Why should we give people a break when they've failed in a harmful way? People who say it doesn't matter if you succeed as long as you try are lying or wrong
4589	Aoife	2014-04-21	Ran, was that last reply to me? Or someone else? I think the TV show portrayed it as a rape because Jaime (1) did not appear to have clear consent from Cersei and (2) even more than that, he had her telling him to stop.Â 
Â 
Edited: Given the ADR that you've noted, I can only assume it's deliberate, too. Even if it wasn't, I think they may have tried to make something more complicated and simply failed at it. I understand you disagree, but how many blushes are we supposed to give the scene?

4590	Jasta11	2014-04-21	The only change from the books is that Cercei doesn't start saying ''yes'' when he's already in her. Myself I think that's honestly not a change worth being up in arms over. It was very forceful sex still, which Cercei didn't want and Jaime wanted right now. it doesn't help that Lena doesn't act like a rape victim, kissing him back and all.
Â 
I also have the impression people are whitewashing Book!Jaime to a degree. He is not a perfect angel post-maiming. This is the guy who's intent on flinging babies in trebuchet. But overly forceful sex with his sister next to his dead son makes him a monster in the show only? Come on now.
4591	ser benjamin	2014-04-21	Rape is never about sex, it is about power.Â 
Attempting to think through Jamie's motives while not condoning rape...

He went from being the most feared fighter in the realm (power) who was the son of the most powerful man in the realm (power) who was having an on-going affair with both the Queen and on of the "most beautiful women in the realm" (power...)
To being a dis-owned, cripple, who's only lover isnt even happy to see him. Â  Â  Now, his secret son, the person he had only a day before given up EVERYTHING to protect.... his self-established only reason for living... has died in front of him. Â 
The bad stuff that happened to the character in the war and on the way home was with enemies. Â  He comes home to family and is visited by a whole new set of heartbreak and loss.Â 
Â 
Not hard at all to see how someone in that situation could hit rock bottom and do something desperate to feel in control again. Â If we want to blame the directing/acting and assume that *eventually Cersei was consenting... it is still a rock-friggin-bottom scene for Jamie Lannister.Â

It was very forceful sex still, which Cercei didn't want and Jaime wanted right now. it doesn't help that Lena doesn't act like a rape victim, kissing him back and all.
Â 
I also have the impression people are whitewashing Book!Jaime to a degree. He is not a perfect angel post-maiming. This is the guy who's intent on flinging babies in trebuchet. But overly forceful sex with his sister next to his dead son makes him a monster in the show only? Come on now.


Â 
Â 
I don't remember it as remotely being a rape scene. Â She doesn't initially want to have sex right there at that time...a totally different backstory than HBO has given, where she's already been refusing to have sex with him for weeks. Â And it is a consensual encounter. Â Not so with the HBO scene, where only if you look very, very hard can you see that Lena is kissing him back at the end, and even with that they still have Â her verbal cues being 'rape'.
4593	ovis alba	2014-04-21	Â 
There's no indication whatsoever that Jaime would have forced it if Cersei was crying and begging him not to.


Â 
Then we apparently read that chapter differently.
4594	Hath4	2014-04-21	I think people are upset because it was Jamie who was involved in the sexual violence. the two characters who have committed crimes involving sexual violence this year have been him and ramsay. No what ramsay did was way worse, you can not do much worse as a human being than hunt a girl for sport and feed her to dogs, but Jamie did rape cerci Â puts him that category and that is a shame and a huge mistake.
4595	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Has Lena Headey made any comments about the scene? I'd like to hear her take on it, because i'm just not seeing the performance of someone playing a wholly unwilling rape victim.

Â 
In the books she repeatedly says no and voices several objections while pounding him in the chest (weakly but still). Someone linked the entire scene in this thread. There is no difference on that front. The difference is that Cercei starts saying ''yes'' when he's already in her and tells him to get it over with quickly. If it's not rape, it's at the very least very forceful sex, and the show-book differences at pretty minimal to me.
Â 
As for not wanting to do it right now, and still having to do it, well that's also rape. And Cercei is forced in both book and show.
4597	The God of Death	2014-04-21	Â 
Consensual sex with a lover is preferable to fucking rape, yes. It's even worse that this act is given to a character who would clearly never in a million years rape anybody, whilst the shady-as-hell Tyrion who DOES fantasise of raping Cersei, is made out to be a white knight.
Â 
Christ, I hate this.


Â 
Tyrion the "white knight" is going to kill the girl who on the show ACTUALLY LOVES HIM.
Â 
Do you seriously just lack the patience?
Â 
Cersei is going to do many, many terrible things going forward.
Â 
This particular moment may be a low point for how people see Jaime, and a high point for how people see Tyrion and Cersei... but how will people be feeling by the end of Season 4?
Â 
Patience. Â Patience.Â

4598	AryaSansa	2014-04-21	The writers decided to opt for realism.Â  Rape culture, as was incest, was prevalent in Medieval culture hundreds of years ago.

Â 
I sort of agree, she looks to me as if she can sort of not make up her mind if she wants it or not. But the problem is that it's not that she is "reluctant" at first and then starts to be fine, but she continues to reject him until the very last moment of the scene, so as a viewer you never have a feeling that she is really eventually fine with it at some point.
To me Cersei getting aroused by Jaime forcing himself on her next to her sons corpse is what's the real change of character there.
4600	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Â 
Â 
Â Not so with the HBO scene, where only if you look very, very hard can you see that Lena is kissing him back at the end, and even with that they still have Â her verbal cues being 'rape'.


I don't think you have to look that hard to notice her kissing him back, nor do I think her verbal cues suggest rape. She doesn't scream or raise her voice. She doesn't call for help. She doesn't even sound in a great deal of distress. From the tone of her voice, it sounds like she knows perfectly well that it's wrong for them to have sex right next to their dead son, but there's nothing there to suggest that she really wants Jaime to stop.
4601	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-21	Apparently it doesnt matter what their intent was. What matters is how anonymous people who don't care to look for details interpret something the very first time they see it..... rule 1 of the internet Â /snark. Â 


Well, yes. Most people are not going to watch the scene multiple times, read interviews of from the director, show runners, and actors, plus have the knowledge of the source material on which the scene is based. So first impressions do matter because that's the only impression the vast majority of the audience gets. If they think it was rape, then it was rape.
4602	digiFemme	2014-04-21	Jaime is the most 'anti-rape' character in the book? When did this fallacy come about?
There are plenty of other characters who are more anti-rape than Jaime. Dany for example who stood against the Dothraki to stop rape or Stannis.
Jaime is the guy who stood by when Aerys raped his wife. Who did nothing when Tyrion's 13 yr old wife was gang raped. Who stood by and did nothing except wish everyone a good trip when poor Jeyne Poole was send off to marry the sadistic Ramsay Snow.
Jaime, coward that he is, is only anti-rape when there are no risks involved in it for him.


Â 
I don't think of him as the noblest character, either. But my point was that for book Jaime, Cersei was the most important person in the beginning of his arc. So he might not care that someone else was getting hurt (or maybe he DID care but wouldn't be willing to risk his neck for it) for as long as it wasn't his sister. Remember, this is the guy who was willing to give up everything- even loving his own kids, because it was a risk to him and Cersei's relationship. He had no room for anything but that. Yes, pretty twisted...but I don't think he'd lay a hand (to hurt) her because of it. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
Â 
Later on when he's taken prisoner and meets Brienne, etc. something in him changes and he risks his neck to save her. If can give this consideration for a stranger, why would he behave less for Cersei? People aren't arguing that he's a nice guy (far from it) but that it was an out of character moment created to make the TV show edgier but it's plain offensive.

Â 
Â 
I do. Â If it was clear that it wasn't a rape you wouldn't have people and reviewers talking about the "rape".
Â 
I'm surprised anyone read the book passage and thought it was a rape, I always read it as Cersei being her typical self of not wanting their affair to be found out, nothing at all to do with her desire, which I thought it was clear she did want Jamie at that time. Â I guess you learn something new every day. Â

Other than her explicit words, which do have to carry some weight. I think it's very dangerous to think that you have to yell, or fight, or be agitated before someone else will accept that you really don't want to do something. Especially something as potentially unreal-seeming as your lifelong lover, the one man you always relied on, raping you.
4605	Sun	2014-04-21	The Jaime/Cersie scene strikes me as for the most part as a failure in direction. Alex Graves handling borderline incompetent. The way the scene was shot, blocked and edited, was atrocious. And the actors seemed, to me at least, as if they were unsure of their choices. Something went terribly wrong with the filming of that scene, and the result is what we got.Â
4606	Moondancer	2014-04-21	I remember both Heady and Waldau describing C&J's relationship as "fucked up". In retrospective, I now think that was a poor way to tease the upcoming season and in general is a pitiful rationalisation of a scene that strongly plays with the idea that rape is happening - they are of opinion that rape is happening, but it's not really happening or something of the sorts. Shock value and nothing more, really. 
As far as the directing goes, the ambiguity wasn't there, or rather there is, but it's very subtle. :rolls: If you open with Cersei saying no, but skimp on the visual, that's terrible choice to portray something that should left you asking more about their relationship and not shouting in moral distaste. 
The book scene to me summaries the years of their bond - Cersei who was (can't believe I am typing this) the rational one, saying they are not Targaryens, and that their relationship is only possible if a secret; the one who was considering both Rhaegar and Robert; who forbade Jaime from being close to her children and who is constantly aware of the appearances etc and Jaime who was always passionately into her, and knew no reason. FFS, he asked her to marry him. 
Cersei's reaction is the one she always displays - reluctance to give in due to mores, laws, opinions of others; calculations and scheming for power vs her love and lust = the point when she says yes. Jaime reaction is that he advances himself on her beside the corpse of her son,frankly - mad,in a way he has always done - without the consideration for the consequences. Folly, as Cersei says. Folly notwithstanding, she will use him, but he doesn't do the same with her (nor he's capable of that).
This scene is very similar to the Winterfell scene. 
On the bright side, thus type of episodes are what the Internet is made for - oh, the outcry, the indignation!

4607	Le Cygne	2014-04-21	A nice article by AV Club writer reflecting on the show's decision to turn the rape button up about 5 levels and how it changes two key relationships. Â Â http://www.avclub.co...-thrones-203499Â That's a great article, I could quote the whole thing, but this is the crux of it:Â The question is, instead: Why change this?And this is what got lost:Martins creation is notable for grappling with issues of female agency and power within a misogynist world... But decisions like the ones made in these two relationships calls the adaptation process into question.
4608	ovis alba	2014-04-21	Â 
I don't think of him as the noblest character, either. But my point was that for book Jaime, Cersei was the most important person in the beginning of his arc. So he might not care that someone else was getting hurt (or maybe he DID care but wouldn't be willing to risk his neck for it) for as long as it wasn't his sister.

Â 
I don't think in his view he is hurting Cersei at this point. At this moment Cersei is all he has left that's why he does not only want her, he needs her and I think in his mind he is doing what is helping him and actually also her at that very moment. It's his way of putting his and her life back in order and he doesn't care if she sees it the same way.
In a very messed up way he is forcing her to what he thinks is best for them.
4609	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2014-04-21	Yeah, count me in the camp of people who thought it was uncomfortable, but that it actually fit Jaime's character.Â  Redemptive arc or no, Cersei was always his weakness and everything else always went out the window when it concerns her.Â  And it really shouldn't be overlooked that their rendevous by Joffrey's corpse was told explicitly from Jaime's POV in the book.
Â 
I'm not going to call this "out of character" for Jaime and I'm even going to go so far as to say that I'm willing to let this play out and see what happens over the course of the season.Â  That said, I think it is certainly uncomfortable and does complicate Jaime's redemptive arc (which isn't necessarily a problem, but still makes it harder to understand what you think of him), and I can understand arguments of people who say that they don't like the scene or wish it would've played out differently.
Â 
What I don't think is acceptable is the following line of reasoning:Â  "Stick to the books please."Â  The TV show is an adaptation, deal with it.Â  The books were never going to be adapted as they were, and even if they tried out of some childish desire for fan service, it would fail as a TV show.Â  I don't like 100% of the adaptation choices the show has made (I doubt that any book reader has), but IMO they've done well enough to earn some benefit of the doubt, sticking too close to the books was never the best idea and I don't think they're veering too far with this one.

Â 
Yes, I think this is probably it. Especially the editing, I mean some are saying you can see Cersei kissing Jaime at the end if you look really hard, but that's a failure in the scene. Is it's meant to come across differently but you can't see it unless you watch it several times and pay attention to every single detail, the scene itself has failed.
4611	Cas Stark	2014-04-21	I think changing the dynamic we had in the books of Jamie sexually REJECTING Cersei after this first encounter to one of where Cersei has been rejecting Jamie in KL for weeks and then he rapes her is pretty huge. Â 
Â 
Are we going to see Cersei, now, subsequent to this scene, trying to seduce her brother who raped her?
4612	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Other than her explicit words, which do have to carry some weight.

As I said earlier in this topic, words like "no" and "stop" only carry as much weight as the tone of voice and emotion that goes along with them. There's a world of difference between saying "no, stop" in a playful voice as if you're being tickled, and screaming "NO! STOP!" because something terrible is about to happen.

Exactly. The way they've regressed Jaime when they changed the timeline hasn't worked, and Cersei trying to seduce him later on is not going to make any sense either.

You know that's not going to fly with a lot of people don't you? "No means no" is something everyone I know believes in. Imagine them watching the show. They're not going to take into account her tone or anything. It's a very black and white issue for some, but a lot of people here are claiming "grey."

Â 
They may not do it, who knows. Â But, I'm not even a Jamie fan, and I don't think Â he's "redeemed" but the entire point was that he goes through all of these trials, gets to KL, he still 'thinks' Â he loves Cersei and Â he's tired of all the lying, he's really serious this time, about going public with their relationship.
Â 
She shoots this down, and the way this occurs begins to show him her true nature, and from then on, he begins to remove himself from her emotional power and distance himself from her on all levels. Â And she tries to pull him back.
Â 
I thought this was a signficant part of their character development arc, not just a random plot point or detail. Â And it has been completely destroyed for the show.
4619	digiFemme	2014-04-21	The only change from the books is that Cercei doesn't start saying ''yes'' when he's already in her.Â 


Â 
I don't know how you're interpreting the text but that's not what happened in the book at all- in there she
Â 
- doesn't say no...she says 'no not here, the septons are around'
- and he replies 'Who cares, the others take them!'
- then she encourages him before the actual act.
- after it happens what is her reaction? It's 'That was folly...with father around...jaime we have to be careful!'
Â 
Â 
The point is that the change was pretty offensive. I'll grant that it probably wasn't intentional but it still rightfully upset a lot of readers.Â
4620	Hoo	2014-04-21	Jamie Cersei story line has been boring, if not non existent, since Bran incident. Â This is good stuff.
4621	Dustdevil	2014-04-21	Nothing to add to what has been said. This was flat out not well done by the producers. They should have had Cersei give in to her urges instead of saying "stop!" "not here!" all the time, which made it seem like a rape. How they could interpret something like that as not rape is beyond me.
4622	RavenKing23	2014-04-21	There was a movie, 'something' Dogs or Boys or whatever, I can't remember. What I do remember is the major backlash it got because there was a rape scene and the female started liking it and actively particpated in it later (book). They got so much shit for it that when the remake was made it was changed to a full on rape scene with no encourgement from the female (tv). I honestly don't see a way to do that scene with out getting shit for it so why the need to attack each other? It's kinda funny in a very stupid kinda way
4623	IlAovatar	2014-04-21	Holy shit, can you stop talking about rape as though you have a clue. You clearly do not.

You were wrong then, too. No should always be respected as no. Tones of voice are often misunderstood, and my "I'm terrified at what's going on 'no'" might sound an awful lot like your "she's being coy 'no'". Why not take the safe route and just treat it at face value? Even better, why not wait for a 'yes'?
4626	Mark the Red	2014-04-21	Holy shit, can you stop talking about rape as though you have a clue. You clearly do not.


Â 
The real clue is going to hit BasTyra like a ton of bricks.
Â 
Have you considered that Jaime's popularity might actually go UP because of this scene? Â Especially with women.
Â 
The nasty, dirty little secret we don't talk about at cocktail parties is that there are millions upon millions of women who are (gasp) deeply and profoundly attracted to violent, aggressive and forceful men.
Â 
Welcome to the nightmare of the criminal justice system when trying to distinguish between rough and tumble sex and rape.
Â 
There is a sad, sad truth that the guy who repeatedly assaults his girlfirend / wife / etc. has no shortage of dates when he gets out of prison.

It seems to me he didn't want it to appear as rape at all, creepy and fucked up yes, but "do me now!" is nothing like "no, no, no it's not right".Â He always just says the show is faithful, which makes it really hard for readers.Â  We're reading about very different characters and very different stories at times in the books than what we are seeing on the show.Â Basically they're having him rape his sister, and in the next episode being uber-nice and making the right decion by sending Brienne on her quest ?Â My fear about that, since they are giving to Jaime all of Tyrion's wrongs, kinslaying and rape, and Tyrion is this pristine spotless creature, they will have Tyrion tell Jaime to send Brienne and Pod off.That's just wrong on so many levels, and it's a sign of how fucked up the characterization is, to be considering it.

It was terrible. Everyone is screaming "rape" but it just seemed awkward and painful. They actors looked like they had no clue what they were doing and where they should be doing it.Â

There's nothing to indicate that she was raped so all this hoopla is ridiculous.Â

4629	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	Some of the rationalizations here for why it was actually alright for Jaime to tear off Cersei's clothes, shove her to the floor, and jam himself inside of her while she cried, "Stop" and struggled beneath him are why I worry about my girlfriend when she takes walks by herself.
4630	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Also, the scene was pretty bad directed. Neither Nikolaj or Lena had any clue of what to do with their lines. And the camera...

Â 
Out of curiosity are you talking about Tysha's rape? I've read only the first book so far and I wouldn't know if he did it again. (If you are that's another discussion entirely where I'll have to discuss the differences of those situations with you)

Â 
There's no rationalization going on. Rape is rape. Â 
Â 
But lets get real here. Â The fictional Khal Drogo has raped more women than you and I have had hot dinners. Â Uncoincidentally, he was also the most popular male character in the show for the first season almost EXCLUSIVELY for women. Â 
Â 
There is a dark and disturbing connection there.

4634	sati	2014-04-21	I think the outrage should be directed at Graves. The man is incompetent beyond belief. I seriously worry for ep. 8 and finale.
4635	Dormund of Ruddy Hall	2014-04-21	The rape scene, for the time in the series, makes me question the entire vision of this adaptation.Â  The horrible treatment of Stannis I always assumed would pay off when the story gets to the point where Stannis actually does something heroic.Â  This Jaime rape scene completely destroys his development as a character and all the building we saw in Season 3.Â  Maybe, in the end, this is where GRRM is heading with the character, but it is disappointing.
4636	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Maybe Jaime kills shae?Â 


Â 
That would be extremly atrocious. I'll stop watching the show if that happens.
4637	Hoo	2014-04-21	Also, the scene was pretty bad directed. Neither Nikolaj or Lena had any clue of what to do with their lines. And the camera...


obvoiusly it was excellent, it got everyone riled up.
4638	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	Â 
He always just says the show is faithful, which makes it really hard for readers.Â  We're reading about very different characters and very different stories at times in the books than what we are seeing on the show.
Â 
Â 
My fear about that, since they are giving to Jaime all of Tyrion's wrongs, kinslaying and rape, and Tyrion is this pristine spotless creature, they will have Tyrion tell Jaime to send Brienne and Pod off.
That's just wrong on so many levels, and it's a sign of how fucked up the characterization is, to be considering it.


Â 
Yes, at this point it wouldn't surprise me, in fact I'm quite certain what would make Jaime swing towards the direction of sending Brienne and Pod after Sansa to keep her safe, will be talking to Tyrion. Cersei will tell him "bring me her head" and Tyrion will say "save her", and that will make him decide to because Tyrion is perfect.
4639	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	Â 
Out of curiosity are you talking about Tysha's rape? I've read only the first book so far and I wouldn't know if he did it again. (If you are that's another discussion entirely where I'll have to discuss the differences of those situations with you)


Sansa is almost raped by him, but he can't go through with it. The show scene is a lot more tame due to probably Sophie Turner being underage at the time.Â
4640	Cas Stark	2014-04-21	Â

Â 
Â 
LOL...D&D are a lot better at "shocking" than they are at character consistency. Â So, I'm sure we'll see Noble Jamie next week, telling Brienne to take the sword and go find Sansa, it will be like the rape never happened. Â
4641	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-21	The sept twincest scene was so fucked up because Cersei was moaning (notÂ quite likeÂ Lysa...but along the same lines) really getting into the sex and egging Jaime onÂ In front of their sons corps.
Â 
However, having her overpowered/raped makes herÂ the 'victim' and Jaime the manipulative/controlling one.
4642	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	Â 
That would be extremly atrocious. I'll stop watching the show if that happens.


I was only joking. Â and yeah Â I'd probably stop watching too.Â
4643	scotcat	2014-04-21	I think the outrage should be directed at Graves.Â 


Â 
His vision certainly seems to be at odds with what was actually seen. If he wanted to show that consent was given, he failed, big time. It was a very disappointing scene and poorly handled.
4644	The God of Death	2014-04-21	You were wrong then, too. No should always be respected as no. Tones of voice are often misunderstood, and my "I'm terrified at what's going on 'no'" might sound an awful lot like your "she's being coy 'no'". Why not take the safe route and just treat it at face value? Even better, why not wait for a 'yes'?


Â 
Stop comparing this scene to how rape is viewed in the 21st century.
Â 
Everyone should know that "No means no." Â If Cersei and Jaime lived in our society, and Cersei wanted to file charges against Jaime... and I was on the jury, and I then a video tape leaked out of the incident... I would definitely say that legally, Jaime committed rape.
Â 
But we're dealing with fictional characters, so we can be more nuanced and don't have to simply end it at "No means no, end of story" I believe it's a misinterpretation of what happened if you don't think that part of Cersei did want it. Â From our knowledge of the books, to the comments of the director and the actors, to the fact that Cersei was kissing and grabbing back at Cersei... I think it's clear that Cersei wasn't 100% against it. Â I'm sorry if that's disturbing for you to hear, or if you simply refuse this line of thinking at all costs, but it's the truth.
4645	Lyanna_Lou	2014-04-21	I have nothing against rough sex, but her continual "please not here" reminded me of her begging Tywin not to marry her to Loras. It really rubbed me the wrong way. She was shoving his face away, and obviously she couldn't scream because that would reveal them. So yeah, not really seeing the consensual, unless one also thinks Joan from Mad Men getting raped by her fiancee in Don's office was consensual because she wasn't gouging his eyes out.Â 
Â 
And anyone who says Cersei "deserved" some rapey punishment can fuck off.Â 

I'm glad you brought up the scene from Mad Men because that's exactly what I thought of when I was watching this last night. It was super creepy and uncomfortable, and yes, it was rape. Just because Cersei consented to kissing Jaime doesn't mean she consented to having sex with Jaime. There's an awful lot of people in this thread who don't understand that difference, and it disturbs me that they're trying to excuse it.
4646	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	Â 
Those things are yet to be seen. They could definitely still happen. I have a theory that D&D are building up Tyrion only to take him down the darkest path (save for Ramsay, Joffery, etc) as a shock value type of thing, but we'll see. Â I love show!Tyrion, but he's very white. Â I wouldn't mind them graying up his character.Â 


Â 
I'm assuming they will take him down that path...not sure why everyone is so worried about it to the contrary. If nothing else, this horrid Jaime/Cersei scene is showing us that the writers aren't shying away from depicting characters as problematic and morally ambiguous.
Â 
Now for Dany to get some mud on her...
4647	Aoife	2014-04-21	The nasty, dirty little secret we don't talk about at cocktail parties is that there are millions upon millions of women who are (gasp) deeply and profoundly attracted to violent, aggressive and forceful men.


Â 
And? You can be any or all of those without being a rapist, even if the "millions upon millions of women" (out of how many billion?) are out there.
4648	solidviper	2014-04-21	I really, really dislike Cersei (though she is an interesting character), and there's still no way in hell that I would say she deserved that.Â

When in the books, Jaime went behind his back and Cersei's back to save her from the Lannisters. On his own, Brienne didn't make him feel guilty, he wanted to do the right thing.

4651	RoamingRonin	2014-04-21	Some of the rationalizations here for why it was actually alright for Jaime to tear off Cersei's clothes, shove her to the floor, and jam himself inside of her while she cried, "Stop" and struggled beneath him are why I worry about my girlfriend when she takes walks by herself.

1) As they're fictional characters, we can really only go by what's in the show scene. Not the interviews, not the intentions, not even the book scene on which it was based. I understand that since I don't see any sign from Cersei that she wanted to have sex there and then, I'm saying it's rape. I also understand that it's possible she wanted it (see my original post to Ran, where I even brought a couple of these possible scenarios up), but she said 'no', and (to me) never revoked that, so she shouldn't have gotten it. Finally, I understand that others see things I don't, but since I don't see them, even when looking for them, I'm not going to say "oh, oops, my interpretation is unfounded."

Â 
Oh yes, Jaime would try to kill Brienne while being escorted back to King's Landing... but to not want Brienne to immediately sneak Sansa out of King's Landing right under his family's nose... yes, this is pure nonsense.

Â 
It's unclear though even what D&D think they are depicting in that scene, whether they understand that the way the scene played makes it a rape, and very different from what happened in the books.
Â 
They like surprises and twists and turns, regardless of whether it fits with the character or not.
Â 
However, I don't know if I would count on Targaryen Jesus getting mud on her, if anything the show's depiction of her appears to validate her fans view of all her actions being justified. Â And while I agree they will take Dinklage down a dark path, it will not be as dark as the book path, it remains to be seen even whether they will have him kill Shae. Â
4657	Mark the Red	2014-04-21	Â 
And? You can be any or all of those without being a rapist, even if the "millions upon millions of women" (out of how many billion?) are out there.


And Jaime raped Cersei. Â No question about that. Â Also Tristifer raped Asha in AFFC and she loved it. Â George R R Martin was very specific about these details.
Â 
But lets not ask the tough question as to why Cersei did not cry for help. Â No she didn't "deserve" it so don't play that silly phony outrage card either. Â But no powerless, shrinking violet is Cersei either......
4658	Sun	2014-04-21	I think changing the dynamic we had in the books of Jamie sexually REJECTING Cersei after this first encounter to one of where Cersei has been rejecting Jamie in KL for weeks and then he rapes her is pretty huge. Â 
Â 
Are we going to see Cersei, now, subsequent to this scene, trying to seduce her brother who raped her?


Â 
Yes. I fully agree with this.Â 
Â 
Are they trying to make this a moment a 2nd "hitting bottom" moment where Jaime realizes how low he has sunk for his obsession with his sister? Is this what they are trying to do? I really don't know. For even without the director's failure, the dialogue indicated that an increased ambiguity of the scene was an intent.

Nah Tywin is bad, Â Good Guy Tyrion will kill him.
4660	ovis alba	2014-04-21	Â 
There's no rationalization going on. Rape is rape. Â 
Â 
But lets get real here. Â The fictional Khal Drogo has raped more women than you and I have had hot dinners. Â Uncoincidentally, he was also the most popular male character in the show for the first season almost EXCLUSIVELY for women.Â 


Â 
The a little bit disturbing thing is the discussion about "how does a women have to exactly phrase the no to mean it".
I have less problem with putting "rape" into context which is a fictional show in a certain historical and cultural background and in this case within a clearly already completely distrubing relationship.
That's why I also don't think it will be impossible to redeem Jaime even if in the show the raping component was clearly bigger.
Â 
I fully expect the show to show how Cersei inÂ  the next episode will not hate Jaime for violently raping her, but basically reacting like she has in the book, which will put it already in a different perspective and I think then the Jaime arc will still go done as it would have with a less "rapey" scene

Â 
Well yes, I agree with you. Â Didn't the the whole context of your conversation.
Â 
However, people do often continue to make the same mistake over and over again - both readers and non readers - of trying to see things in terms of what characters "deserve". Â 
Â 
For example, Joffrey's death - many complain that Joffrey "deserved" a worse death, and felt upset that he didn't get it...
Â 
But if there's anything this seriesÂ isn't about, it's what people "deserve".
Â 
To quote William Munny...
Â 
Deserve's got nothing to do with it.

Â 
Â 
If there were no question about it, we wouldn't be having a thread this long. 
Â 
There are tons of reasons why Cersei might not have cried out, many of which have been brought up in this thread. Being powerful or assertive could actually feed into some of them, like not wanting to admit that she couldn't control Jaime anymore, or being afraid that they would be caught (and the massive, massive fallout from that, including losing the throne), or even just the twistedness of wanting Jaime to live with what he'd done.
4664	Cas Stark	2014-04-21	Â

Â 
Are they trying to make this a moment a 2nd "hitting bottom" moment where Jaime realizes how low he has sunk for his obsession with his sister? Is this what they are trying to do? I really don't know.Â 


Â 
Even if that is the case, it still deprives him of any nobility, because he hasn't rejected her, she rejected him. Â Who cares if after he forced her to have sex with him, he decides that non consensual sex with Cersei isn't so great and decides to move on, that is laughable. Â
4665	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	Â

Â 
I'm wondering if they're going to have Jaime reject an encounter from Cersei later? Not that it would really redeem him or take this horror away, but I'm genuinely curious what they thought they were doing with his character by bringing him back to KL so early and then having Cersei reject him in 4x01, which set up this troubling scene. Very confusing.
4666	Le Cygne	2014-04-21	Nah Tywin is bad, Â Good Guy Tyrion will kill him.Yeah, you're right. He will be the hero for that. Hero is Tyrion turf. Jaime bad, Tyrion good.

That's a good point. I think Sansa deserves to have a better life (hell all the Starks do), but the book/series I guess is more about "this is how it is, and you may not like it, but we're not telling a fairy tale." It's a hard pill to swallow.
4668	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	Â

Â 
Yes, I agree with your points about being forced to judge the scene on its own merits (as all scenes should be able to stand for themselves). Â I am simply saying that if you did want to go beyond this, you could read into the thoughts of the director and the actors... which happen to back an interpretation of the scene that some people do have. Â Doesn't mean you have to agree, but it's worth noting.
Â 
Again, I agree that it is rape. Â But just because it is rape doesn't also mean that part of Cersei didn't want it. Â That in no wayÂ justifies an act as despicable as rape, but it doesn't make it less true.
4671	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	that was consentual wasn't it? IIRC it started out looking like it was rape, but then we find out she was wanted it the whole time? Â

That would just make him more of an asshole as far as I can see. Â She rejects him repeatedly. Â He rapes her. Â And then, for some odd reason, she decides, 'oh, I changed my mind again' and now I want to go back to an affair with Jamie, and then he rejects HER.
Â 
That doesn't mean D&D won't do it, because they do a lot of random things that are inconsistent if you are not watching the show from a week to week perspective.

As we were reminded of by LF (though I prefer the book's quote):

Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Do you perchance recall what I said to you that day your father sat the Iron Throne?â<U+0080><U+009D>
The moment came back to her vividly. â<U+0080><U+009C>You told me that life was not a song. That I
would learn that one day, to my sorrow.â<U+0080><U+009D> She felt tears in her eyes, but whether she wept
for Ser Dontos Hollard, for Joff, for Tyrion, or for herself, Sansa could not say. â<U+0080><U+009C>Is it all
lies, forever and ever, everyone and everything?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Almost everyone. Save you and I, of course.â<U+0080><U+009D> He smiled.

Not sure you can blame D&D for this one. They lay the groundwork but the director has creative license in scenes like these, and If it really is supposed to be consensual as Alex Graves says in that interview, the fault lies with him for making it look so far the opposite way. Perhaps even the usually wonderful Nikolaj and Lena are partially at fault.Â

4677	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-21	I had only read a few pages of this thread before I went off to bed last night.Â  I will try and catch up with the reading, but having just rewatched the show (and having watched the Inside the Episode segment with it), I thought I'd post what I observed on both, and then......catch up.
Â 
First off, my first viewing of it......it did look like rape (even though I noticed Cersei kissing him back, grabbing on to him as she said No, etc.), but on my second rewatch it didn't look AS BAD, maybe because I already knew what was coming.Â  You could see Cersei doing physical participation more obviously on a second watch, but still, her words and the manner of her words still disturbed me.
Â 
Reasons for not liking the scene for me are:Â  First off, it was supposed to be their first time seeing each other, and that played into the dynamic from the books.Â  Second, and this is personal opinion, I THINK that with Cersei and Jaime, half the turn on always was how they can't be caught, what they are doing is wrong, it's always a matter of:Â  IS NOW okay, and half of what excites Cersei is the chance of getting caught.Â  She, in the books, I thought, would sexually be aroused by the danger of the where and when, and I think that was true in the Sept, in the books.Â  Things like this being changed are what has made the show scene such a mess.
Â 
For all those wondering the intent of the scene:Â  On the Inside the Episode segment, one of them.....I forget which name goes with which one, LOL, I think it was David, said point blank:Â  Jaime forced himself on Cersei.Â  THAT pisses me off even more.Â  I'm trying to look for the subtleties, wondering if they are there, and BOOM, he does say Jaime forced himself on her.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  I just thought everyone would like to know the Inside the Episode comments, and now I'm off to read, I can't say as I'm sure I have time to read 30 pages, LOLÂ

No, we all live in a world populated by people who believe the definition of rape is a blurred line, not black and white.
Â 
Gods, fandom is so disappointing sometimes. Stop the presses! Turns out, sexual assault only happens in "Flea Bottom."
4679	Sun	2014-04-21	Director Alex Graves on the scene, via Hitfix:
Â 
Â 

Â 
"Well, it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for them ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle. Nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters, so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal. And it was very much about the earlier part with Charles (Dance) and the gentle verbal kidnapping of Cersei's last living son. Nikolaj came in and we just went through one physical progression and digression of what they went through, but also how to do it with only one hand, because it was Nikolaj. By the time you do that and you walk through it, the actors feel comfortable going home to think about it. The only other thing I did was that ordinarily, you rehearse the night before, and I wanted to rehearse that scene four days before, so that we could think about everything. And it worked out really well. That's one of my favorite scenes I've ever done."


Â 


Â 
Â 
My goodness did he fail. The scene was terrible and none of the intent he states in this quote came through. And the blocking of the scene was probably the worst aspect of its direction, followed swiftly by the editing.Â
4680	Brewmaster	2014-04-21	The director really said that? He probably sees "consensual" differently than most of us.


Â 
Â 
Considering that most here are up in arms, because they consider what Jaime did in the book "consensual", I'm going to have to say that he sees things fairly similarly.
Â 
It really is not much different from the book. Cersei is distraught and not interested in having sex in front of Joff's corpse, tells him to stop and Jaime Forces himself on her. She eventually gives in and lets him.
Â 
Those are the facts of what happens in the book.
Â 
The fact that people don't consider that "rapey" is a little strange, to be honest.
Â 
I think there are a few things at play here. It does "look" a little more forcefull that it sounds to read it in the book. That could be due to acting choices, writing choices, directing choices, or editing choices (cutting away before showing Cersei "give in").Â 
Â 
However, I think most of all it has to do with the fact that watching somebody being forcefully fucked when they say no looks like rape. We are in Jaime's head in the book at the time of this and have no perspective into Cersei's thoughts, but we know she says no, doesn't want to do it and that Jaime forces himself on her. I think some people are softening it in their minds.Â 
Â 
That scene seemed like it was written in the book, to me, as a pretty standard example of date-rape. Was it lighter date-rape than shown in last night's episode? um...who cares really.

It's unclear though even what D&D think they are depicting in that scene, whether they understand that the way the scene played makes it a rape, and very different from what happened in the books.
Â 


Â 
I don't think it's as different from the book as you seem to think.Â 
Â 
The only difference is, mid-way through it, she starts moaning and helps rush it along - possibly because she's into it or possibly because she wants to 'get it over with' since he's not taking no for an answer. I agree that it's more ambiguous in the book...
Â 
but it might be worth asking yourself why you're so OK with a "rape that I can justify isn't a rape" in the book, and the TV that just does away with the ambiguity (I also suspect they didn't want to deal with the real-world fallout of feminists and such objecting to a scene "no" actually ends up meaning "yes").Â 
Â 
I prefer the latter.Â
4682	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-21	Not sure you can blame D&D for this one. They lay the groundwork but the director has creative license in scenes like these, and If it really is supposed to be consensual as Alex Graves says in that interview, the fault lies with him for making it look so far the opposite way. Perhaps even the usually wonderful Nikolaj and Lena are partially at fault.Â 


They could have written it to make it look more consentual though.

That would just make him more of an asshole as far as I can see. Â She rejects him repeatedly. Â He rapes her. Â And then, for some odd reason, she decides, 'oh, I changed my mind again' and now I want to go back to an affair with Jamie, and then he rejects HER.
Â 
That doesn't mean D&D won't do it, because they do a lot of random things that are inconsistent if you are not watching the show from a week to week perspective.


Â 
Reasons for Cersie wanting to sleep with Jaime are never ambiguous. She'll do it be cause she needs to manipulate him into doing something for her, and at that point it may have dawned on him how toxic the relationship is.
Â 
Like I said, it doesn't excuse the change, but at least I may start to understand it.Â
4686	Born Sinner	2014-04-21	I can't believe how much this scene is bothering people. GRRM wasn't afraid to walk that road to when he let Tyrion rape the whore. In my opinion Tyrion raping this whore is far more out of character than Jaime raping Cersei.

Â 
If we're going to apply real-world definitions and morals to a fictional world, where is all the outrage at everything else? Â  For realzies... Â I think some folks here think they have to convince people that "rape is a bad thing". I dont think anyone here needs convincing of that. Â  Â  Did Cersie "deserve" it?
Well...... Â Did Theon deserve castration? Â  Did Arnolf Karlstark deserve execution? Did Joff deserve to die painfully and scared? Â  Prior to that scene, how many people really wanted to see Cersie "get what's coming to her"? Were you hoping for something different? Â 
Â 
Â 
Â If there is anyone left expecting a pure character in this story, you are going to have a bad time. Â Show or Book, no one is clean.Â

4703	Night'sQueen	2014-04-21	I've never been so disappointed in the board and its leadership, insofar as you, Ran, are the representative of it.
you have a woman saying no, saying this is wrong, but because her hand is clutching at the man, that means yes? 
I can certainly understand a defense of the scene as a poor writing/editing decision and poor cutting of the scene, rather than a deliberate decision to make Jaime a rapist, but to try to convince all the people who heard a person saying no, and believing that no mean no, that, oh but her body is saying yes if you look really closely, that is disappointing and not what I expected here.

I agree wholeheartedly. I can't even read the rest of this thread, I am so sick to my stomach. I came here expecting a good discussion on why the show took this scene so far from the book and instead found a lot of people saying that what was clearly a RAPE was not a rape. This is extremely disturbing.

Â 
Condemning rape does not come from a "university relationship code." Rape is an act of aggressive, malicious violence against the person of another human being, which is wrong in any universe - whether it has "dragons" or not has nothing to do with moral law - and, by the way, also happens to be a crime in Westeros, punishable by banishment to the Wall or castration. We see "rapers" named at the Wall in that very episode, for crying out loud.

4718	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-21	Jaime is the most 'anti-rape' character in the book? When did this fallacy come about?
There are plenty of other characters who are more anti-rape than Jaime. Dany for example who stood against the Dothraki to stop rape or Stannis.
Jaime is the guy who stood by when Aerys raped his wife. Who did nothing when Tyrion's 13 yr old wife was gang raped. Who stood by and did nothing except wish everyone a good trip when poor Jeyne Poole was send off to marry the sadistic Ramsay Snow.
Jaime, coward that he is, is only anti-rape when there are no risks involved in it for him.


First off, I said "one of the", not the most anti-rape.Â 
2) Stannis called a girl who'd been raped by her father on a regular basis a whore.
3) Jaime is the guy who tried to help her, but was stopped by his older fellow Kingsguards.
4) Tysha's rape and the Jeyne Poole plot were commanded by his father ; there wasn't much he could do.
5) Yes, saving Brienne from rape (and subsenquently losing his hand) wasn't a big risk at all

Spare us the phony outrage. Â Only a very small few say this wasn't a rape. Â The real interesting / disturbing thing is why Cersei doesn't do anything about it afterwards. Â Sadly, the University Code of Conduct manual does not address this issue. Â It is not an uncommon event.

Â 
Neither are good. Both were terrible facts.
Â 
But, the thing going on here, is that Jaime throw Bran out of the window. That was atrocious, and he deserved every punishment he could have. But he DID NOT rape Cersei in the books.
4730	Jasta11	2014-04-21	Â 
Â 
Considering that most here are up in arms, because they consider what Jaime did in the book "consensual", I'm going to have to say that he sees things fairly similarly.
Â 
It really is not much different from the book. Cersei is distraught and not interested in having sex in front of Joff's corpse, tells him to stop and Jaime Forces himself on her. She eventually gives in and lets him.
Â 
Those are the facts of what happens in the book.
Â 
The fact that people don't consider that "rapey" is a little strange, to be honest.
Â 
I think there are a few things at play here. It does "look" a little more forcefull that it sounds to read it in the book. That could be due to acting choices, writing choices, directing choices, or editing choices (cutting away before showing Cersei "give in").Â 
Â 
However, I think most of all it has to do with the fact that watching somebody being forcefully fucked when they say no looks like rape. We are in Jaime's head in the book at the time of this and have no perspective into Cersei's thoughts, but we know she says no, doesn't want to do it and that Jaime forces himself on her. I think some people are softening it in their minds.Â 
Â 
That scene seemed like it was written in the book, to me, as a pretty standard example of date-rape. Was it lighter date-rape than shown in last night's episode? um...who cares really.


Â 
Yeah, that was my impression as well. We can argue from here to next sunday on the exact details of the thing, but it was rape in both cases to me. Cercei enjoying it partway through doesn't make it less so. And saying ''not here'' and then being forced is to me no different from plainly saying ''no'' and being forced. It's unwanted sex either way.
Â 
The scene could definitely have been better directed, that's not even up for debate. These two actors are usually very good, and here they didn't seem to know what to do at all. Doesn't help the director and showrunners seem to be at odds on the scene, even. But I'm really puzzled at people thinking this is a signifiant deviation, when from what I see it's not. Apart from this not being the first time they see each other in a long time, obviously.

Â 
You should re-read the books, because you are wrong.
4734	Rockroi	2014-04-21	I thought it was rape as it was happening and the whole time I was just BEGGING Cersei to say something that would make it consensual. Â 
Â 
In the book, its clear, she is hesitant about doing the act because its a sept, its incest and their dead kid is right there. Â But that she wants to have sex with JAime right there and then.Â 
Â 
There is nothing like that here. Â Cersei keeps saying 'no' and Jaime keeps going.
Â 
So, after 3 carefully crafted seasons where Jaime goes from "complete, epic asshole" to "imperfect hero" the people who made the show threw that all away to make Jaime suck again. Â 
Â 
The problem is that the show runners IGNORED the books and stumbled into a useless controversy at the expense of one of its best characters. Â

Yeah, that was my impression as well. We can argue from here to next sunday on the exact details of the thing, but it was rape in both cases to me. Cercei enjoying it partway through doesn't make it less so. And saying ''not here'' and then being forced is to me no different from plainly saying ''no'' and being forced. It's unwanted sex either way.
Â 
The scene could definitely have been better directed, that's not even up for debate. These two actors are usually very good, and here they didn't seem to know what to do at all. Doesn't help the director and showrunners seem to be at odds on the scene, even. But I'm really puzzled at people thinking this is a signifiant deviation, when from what I see it's not. Apart from this not being the first time they see each other in a long time, obviously.


Â 
I didn't read it as a rape. Â Nowhere in Cersei's POV does she ever reflect on it as a rape, instead, she continues to try and use sex to keep her brother under her control and get Â him to do what she wants and he is the one rejecting her. Â This, as well as my reading of the text, argues quite strongly against the book episode being rape. Â She doesn't want them to get caught, she doesn't object the sex, but to the risk. Â I'm frankly surprised anyone originally read the passage as a rape, especially again, since we have his POV and her POV, and neither of them remember the encounter as a rape.
4736	RoamingRonin	2014-04-21	I don't get the problem : the book scene is also a rape. Maybe it's less violent, but Cersei doesn't want it either. Violent or not, it's still a rape.


Â 
If "No means no" fits in Westeros then Asha was raped by Qarl.Â 
Â 
People have their own behind-closed-doors rules to their relationships and I don't think a lot of posters here understand that.Â 
Â 


In truth, it's all very confusing.Â  Apparently it was fine empathizing with the character when he was perfectly willing to murder innocent children but raping a woman was one bridge too far.Â 


Â 
Preach.

I can't take the outrage seriously.Â
4737	Faint	2014-04-21	Also, as awful as it was, throwing Bran out of the window was done to protect his family. Raping his sister...not so.


Â 
What about butchering Arya at Cersei's command because she made Joffrey look foolish?
Â 
Let's not get things twisted here, Jaime is a monster, rape or not.Â  That's why the outrage is silly.Â  Jaime cannot sink any lower; he is already at basement level.
4738	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-21	First off, I said "one of the", not the most anti-rape.Â 
2) Stannis called a girl who'd been raped by her father on a regular basis a whore.
3) Jaime is the guy who tried to help her, but was stopped by his older fellow Kingsguards.
4) Tysha's rape and the Jeyne Poole plot were commanded by his father ; there wasn't much he could do.
5) Yes, saving Brienne from rape (and subsenquently losing his hand) wasn't a big risk at all


Â 
As for number 4, I just wanted to say that I'm not sure that we even have proof that Jaime was still at Casterly Rock or present for the raping of Tysha.Â  IIRC, he was on a visit? maybe, and while we know he was forced to tell Tyrion that Tysha was a whore he bought for Tyrion and that he sent up the rescue scenario..........it's never mentioned in Jaime's memory that was he was present for the barrrack raping.Â  I don't recall Tyrion ever thinking about Jaime being there, either.Â  Ya'd think it would be noted on whether or not Jaime was one of the rapists.Â  Or perhaps, Tyrion would have thoughts about his own raping of Tysha in front of his Golden Big Brother?Â  It seems to me that perhaps Jaime was made to tell his truth and then.......he returned to KL?Â  That's how I always thought it seemed.
Â 
And, the truth of the Tysha incident does show Jaime's anti-rape mindset.Â  He was in a fury that men tried to rape a young girl on Lannister controlled lands.Â
4739	The Eunuch	2014-04-21	If "No means no" fits in Westeros then Asha was raped by Qarl.


Â 
Asha was not raped because it was clearly a game between them.

So it was between Cersei and Jaime. I wouldn't call it a game. But she wanted it as much as Jaime did.

Â 
Of course they don't, rape in their world is not rape in ours. Robert being rough and forcing himself on her was not rape to Cercei either. Sansa wouldn't have thought Tyrion doing it would have been rape. Tyrion himself never thinks os his treatment of the bed slave as rape. That's not an argument at all.
Â 
I see no difference between ''not wanting to get caught and being forced'' and ''not wanting, period, and being forced''. If you don't want to have sex, for any reason, and are forced to, it's rape.
Â 
Bottom line is, the waters are very murky in both cases. Not liking how the show portrays it is one thing, I don't either. Saying it's a significant book deviation, however, is false to me. Cercei says no, Jaime still forces himself on her, and she regrets it afterwards. Would adding the last part make it less ''rapey''? How much ''not-rapey', should they have made this scene so that twins having sex on top of their son's dead body is any less disturbing?
Â 
And again, this is in the books the same Jaime that threatrens to fling a baby on a trebuchet, right after saying he doesn't do idle threats. But somehow semi-raping his sister only crosses a moral line in the show? I'm really baffled now.

I wasn't sure about that so I didn't go there, else I'd be called deluded or whatever, but I think you're right. There's nothing indicating he knew about Tywin's plans/ was present .

The fact that she took pleasure from it doesn't erase what she said "No. Not here..." "This was a folly...". When someone doesn't want to have sex, it's called a rape.
Â 
This debate reminds me of the people who think that a husband cannot rape his wife. Marriage, love or pleasure has nothing to do with this : when you're forced, it's a rape.

Â 
I guess we will have to agree to disagree. Â  I reread the passage this morning and I don't see any rape, I don't see a quasi-rape, I don't see anything approximating rape either in Westeros or anywhere else. Â In reality, sometimes people are actually, truly, really overcome by passion and they have sex at times and places that are against their better judgment....that's what I read in the passage. Â Cersei doesn't want to get caught, Jamie doesn't care about getting caught, he wants to go public. Â The sexual attraction and dynamic between them is unchanged, as we see from the passage of their embraces and kisses and the rest of it.
Â 
Apparently not everyone reads it the same way, I can see if you read the book as a rape, you wouldn't be upset by the TV version. Â I didn't read it as a rape and so I think it completely changes the dynamic between the two people, and much of the rest of what happens is going to be sort of Â stupid in the new TV context.

Â 
So she took pleasure from it, actively participated in it, and never by any subsequent thought or statement indicates it was rape. Â It seems to me a dangerous place when a woman isn't the judge of whether she consented to sex or not.
4756	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	This may be the first mis-step that is going to come back to haunt them. Â They seriously fucked this scene up by making it a rape. Â I almost laughed out loud when I read the director talking about how it shows Jamie is conflicted because he's really a "good knight" like Brienne?????? Â A good knight that rapes his sister? Â Um, okay, guys, but I don't think your audience is going to go with this the way you think they will.


Â 
This was particularly hilarious because indeed the best way to showcase how Jaime is in fact a "good knight like Brienne" is to have him rape his sister. Do these people know what they're saying?
Â 
Â 


Â 
Jaime is the one who wonders himself what he would have done IF he'd been the one to catch Arya.Â  In his talk with Ilyn Payne, on the road to Riverrun years later, he's saying that he finally realized that Cersei screwed him and yapped in his ear about punishing Arya the whole night.Â  Jaime finally, that time with Illyn, realizes that Cersei saying "I want..." meant she wanted Arya, notÂ  him.Â  Granted, Jaime is now self aware enough to realize it, and looking back, he wonders what he would have done.Â  He's grateful he didn't find her.Â  But, it's not so clear cut to say that.........he would have definately done one thing or another.Â  Jaime himself doesn't seem clear on what he would have done.Â 


Â 
We can't judge Jaime on things he hasn't done, that's the point. Is Jaime a good knight like Brienne? No, far from it. It's not cut and dry being good or a bad guy either though. After losing his hand and meeting Brienne he tries to be the person he wants to be. That doesn't cancel everything horrible he's done up until that point, but again it's not black/white.
Â 
Most of all though, for all the bad he does in the books, he doesn't rape anybody.
Â 
Â 


Â 
It's fear and dread resulting from relentless whitewashing.


Â 
I bet that's the case, really. They already had Tyrion suggest him to lead instead of fight al Lord Commander because apparently show!Jaime is too slow to get it (in the books he figures it out by himself). I'll be very surprised if Tyrion isn't the one asking him to find Sansa to keep her safe, and while he's there get Pod out of KL. They've already set that scene by having Tyrion telling Pod to find Jaime and get out of KL.Â

Â 
I know what you mean, you point out things, and it becomes a bigger deal, LOLÂ  I think the fact that Tyrion never thinks about Jaime in relation to the rape scenes must speak volumes, along with Jaime himself and his thoughts and feelings on rape, not thinking about it ever, is noticeable.
Â 
I do think Jaime himself, looking back, wonders and fears what he would have done in relation to Arya.Â  That is all I'm pointing out, some carry on like Jaime was thinking "Where is Arya......I must cut off her hand?"Â  He doesn't have that exact thought.Â

4760	Faint	2014-04-21	Jaime himself doesn't seem clear on what he would have done.Â

It wasn't just that she took pleasure from it, it's that she gave her verbal consent and physically initiated the actual sex. Â "No, not here" means "no", but "do me now" means "yes". Â She did give her consent before the sex.
4762	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-21	The Show scene in the Sept is horrible.Â  And, the sad thing is, I think they, D&D, don't care.Â  I think they subscribe to the idea that tv audiences will cheer most anyone on, and I'm sure next week, Cersei will work on Jaime, with sex, for something or the other.Â

It seems to me a dangerous place when I say "No" and a guy still undresses me, puts his hand between my legs even if I continue hitting him as a sign of rejection and doesn't consider it as starting to rape me, because he thought I would eventually agree, because woman might eventuall do it as learned from asoiaf

"No. Not here". Is it not a sufficient statment for you?
Â 
Or do you think that any woman deserves to be raped because, after all, they will like it?
4765	RoamingRonin	2014-04-21	Asha was not raped because it was clearly a game between them.


Â 
That's how their relationship (Asha and Qarl) works. When we first see Jaime and Cersei having sex, she tells him to "Stop it!" multiple times but she also consents. That's how their relationship works.Â 
Â 


Yes because it looked exactly like a kinky fun game. If you can't tell one from the other, I just can't help you.


Â 
I'm saying Jaime didn't rape her. I'm saying "No means no" doesn't apply to these characters and their relationships because they have their own rules for how they initiate sex.Â 
Â 


when you're forced, it's a rape.


Â 
She wasn't forced, though.Â

She said the same exact thing to him in Winterfell. She said the exact same thing to the Kettleblack in book four but he ripped her gown open and had sex with her on the spot.Â

If a woman helps the man inside her, and says "do it now, please, now"...is hardly rape.

Every Jaime-Cersei sex scene we've been shown has started the same way. Cersei refusing. It's the same with Asha and Qarl.

Â 
The dynamic between the two is different in the show, that's for certain. I think it's interesting what Jaime says right before forcing himself; something along the line of ''why did the gods make me love a woman like you?''. The scene was, I think, the first step in them drifting apart for good. We'll have to see how it plays out. But my guess is that, in the show, they will play up Jaime feeling rejected, rather than him leaving Cercei because she's so eeeevil and cheated on him like in the books. And you know what, I'm not sure that's a bad thing. It adds more grey the to ''Cercei bad, Jaime good'' dynamic the two had going.
Â 
I would really not start complaining too much about the scene before we see how further Jaime-Cercei interactions play out.
4771	Formerly Tetrarch42	2014-04-21	As a categorical non-Jaime fan I don't feel the Sept scene in the books constituted rape. But I don't think it's very clear cut, it's not unreasonable to argue for one position or the other.
In the show? It looked like a rape scene and nothing else, if the intention was for it to somehow be consensual by the end I think they failed.
In any case his crimes are multitudinous in both mediums:
1. Attempted murder of children
2. Rape (potentially?)
3. Being an accessory to gangrape by aiding his demented father with the Tysha nightmare.
4. Threatening to murder a man's baby by launching him by trebuchet
5. Adultery on the her husband and the king - with her brother
*I'd say those are in descending order of severity.
Â 
He's a reprehensible human being - they've really driven the point home further in the TV series.

It seems to me a dangerous place when I say "No" and a guy still undresses me, puts his hand between my legs even if I continue hitting him as a sign of rejection and doesn't consider it as starting to rape me, because he thought I would eventually agree, because woman might eventuall do it as learned from asoiaf


Â 
The deeper into this conversation we get, the more I'm agreeing on this point. Jaime is quite obviously a fucked up guy. The sept scene feels worse, I think because Jaime forces himself on her in a fit of anger, but both versions of it are troubling. More troubling than it seems most of us are likely to admit.
4773	The Eunuch	2014-04-21	If a woman helps the man inside her, and says "do it now, please, now"...is hardly rape.


Â 
She desires him, but not here. Plus, those statements are clearly to end quickly before they're caught. So it's a rape. Is it so hard to understand?
Â 
Once again, you're like people saying that a woman accusing her husband of rape is wrong, because she has sex with him otherwise. A forced intercourse is a raped, whatever the context his.

Jaime is that paradigm of sensible thinking and self-restraint.


Â 
Not exactly, but see, I can cut a post down, too.Â
4776	Cas Stark	2014-04-21	Â 
The dynamic between the two is different in the show, that's for certain. I think it's interesting what Jaime says right before forcing himself; something along the line of ''why did the gods make me love a woman like you?''. The scene was, I think, the first step in them drifting apart for good. We'll have to see how it plays out. But my guess is that, in the show, they will play up Jaime feeling rejected, rather than him leaving Cercei because she's so eeeevil and cheated on him like in the books. And you know what, I'm not sure that's a bad thing. It adds more grey the to ''Cercei bad, Jaime good'' dynamic the two had going.
Â 
I would really not start complaining too much about the scene before we see how further Jaime-Cercei interactions play out.


Â 
If he leaves her because she rejected him, there is no Â moral benefit,no development of his character in terms of right and wrong that's the difference. Â He hasn't recognized the fundamental truth that she never loved him and was always using him and lying to him, as she herself admits. Â He's just another run of the mill disgruntled lover whose partner moved on.

Â 
That's the point. It might technically not be rape in the book, but to me it still shows that in this very moment Jaime is emotionally at the point, where he would do it, because it's the only thing he has left.Â 
I still don't like the scence much, but not because "Jaime would never have done that" (to me it was clear he started and would have gone through with it), instead because Cersei is the passive victim and not equally emotinally messed up at this point.

Â 
Some viewers just clearly don't know what rape is really like, or can't read the situation properly.


Â 
I know this response is going to get buried in the thread, but I can't help but respond. Â If the MAJORITY of the people viewing the episode - book readers and non-book readers alike, with their varying backgrounds and life experiences (many of whom, unfortunately, will have been the targets of rape or other sexual assault in their lives) -have come to the conclusion that the scene on TV reads as a rape, then YOU are the one whose assessment of the situation is outside the norm. Â
4781	Titan	2014-04-21	Ugh... This thread is a minefield, but I'll step into it anyway.
Â 
- I consider the show version of this event as Rape.
- But... The book version is as well, IMO.
Â 
Why? Most upset book readers here in general do not seem to understand THE BOOKS ARE TOLD FROM UNRELIABLE NARRATORS. And who is the narrator for this scene in the books? You got it... Jaime. The literal reading of the text suggests that it has rape elements. Many good arguments have been made in this thread, using the entire context. But if it looks like "semi-rape" from Jaime's perspective (the perpetrator), you can be pretty sure that an objective viewer would see it as rape.
4782	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Â 
She desires him, but not here. Plus, those statements are clearly to end quickly before they're caught. So it's a rape. Is it so hard to understand?

Â 
So every single Jaime-Cersei sex scene has been rape. He raped her in Winterfell, and he raped her when she was discussing about Bran.

Â 
Actually, I thought the tv version played with notion that Joff's dead body might actually fall on them.Â  In the books, iirc, they were on an adjacent altar, no danger of the dead body joining them.Â  The tv show version and the proximity of the body just added to the new weirdness that D&D created for 'their scene.'Â  IMO
Â 
But, a dead demon tyrant, in either respect, was truly the least of my concerns.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  Also, many people do mourn death by sexual intimacy, granted, it's not usually done with the body right there, but sex is a common form of mourning.Â  The tv show did take away the notion that this was the first that Jaime and Cersei saw each other, and that, more than the dead Joff, is what made the difference.Â  That made it a problem, taking away this as their initial meeting.Â  For me, anyway.Â

They really need to make up their mind.
Â 
I think that many of you are missing the point. Yeah, the scene in the book is fucked up as it is, dead son and period and cut off hand and all.
But there are reasons and justifications there. He hadn't seen her in a year, and he still hadÂ the perfect idea of herÂ in his mind,Â andÂ he knew she was devastated, and wanted to comfort her and be with her. Here, they've been around each other for weeks, so he's not as desperate.
Â 
And that scene is not rape, because, as it often happens with them apparently, she starts reluctant and then gives in. They just like it rough. Nothing wrong with that. But when the reluctance is extended, then it becomes rape.
And that is the problem with the scene, not Joffrey or anything. It's that they would have him do something that is against his own character.
Â 
To be honest, as far as Jaime's popularity with the Unsullied, something that inexplicably concerns me a lot, I don't think that everything's ruined. I mean, lots of people have forgotten about the cousin, and actually likeÂ Jaime after last season's arc. So maybe, if he stays true to his oath, and helps Brienne, and frees Tyrion, he may regain some of that respect. Problem is, people will always be able to claim "he raped his sister", to prove that he is a monster, and the only rebut we have is "that didn't happen like thatÂ in the books"

You're right...I was using "troubling" as a substitute for "rapey." Obviously whatever reading of the scene one chooses, it's one of the most fucked up in ASOIAF.
4787	The Eunuch	2014-04-21	This topic is really disturbing.
Jamie fans think their favorite character has been shown as a monster, while we all know that he's a child murderer and that he has a destructive and incestuous relationship with his sister... The book scene was maybe more ambigious, but Cersei was clearly not willing to do that in the beginning. The fact that she encourages him afterward to end quickly doesn't make it less a rape.
It's like the Stannis fans who complain that he could be depicted as a religious fanatic, which he clearly is.
4788	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	For those who "can't take the outrage seriously" because Jaime already tried to murder a child, you're missing the point. No one's saying rape is worse than child murder or that Jaime is a saint who would never do wrong. What we're simply saying is that whatever his failings, he would never rape his sister. And in the book, he didn't. We're upset because it's a gratuitous and grotesque butchery of his character.
4789	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-21	According to HBO OnDemand........David, I think it was David, said that Jaime forced himself on her.Â  They combined talking about the Twyin, Tommen, Cersei scene with that tail end notion for Jaime and Cersei.Â Â  They treated talking about the Jaime and Cersei scene as an afterthought, almost.Â  I'm going to rewatch that eventually, but they didn't have MUCH beyond that to say about it.Â
4790	Hippocras	2014-04-21	The way you said your explanation made it look like you were saying Cersei deserved to be raped, because she was secretly manipulating Jaime. This is just so wrong it's unbelievable.

That has NOTHING to do with what I said.
I said the scene was fundamentally ambivalent and that Cersei was not a pure victim. I never said rape is ok. But, I also did not see the scene purely as rape, because I put it in context of all other sex scenes between these two, which all have the same no! Yes! dance and all have an element of her using sex to manipulate him. I see him as a victim ALSO in this scene, and her as doing something unforgivable ALSO in the scene, and one does not negate the other.
She was trying to manipulate him to MURDER TYRION and deliberately using the promise of sex to do it. Where the hell is the outrage about that in this insanely long thread! Is everyone just blind to what she was doing there?
Cersei: you have to kill Tyrion.
Jamie: no! He is. My brother.
Cersei: first sign of the slightest bit of affection since his return to KL having lost a hand. A deliberately provocative kiss, and then withdrawing again and saying again, you have to kill Tyrion.
What she was doing in that scene was evil. Unless everyone here believes that somehow ordering someone you have official power over (queen versus Kingsguard) to commit murder is somehow less evil than rape.
4791	Faint	2014-04-21	I actually somewhat question the assumption that Jaime would never rape Cersei.Â  It wouldn't shock me if he attempted to rape his sister at the moment.Â  He is two dead children from choking her to death, after all.

Stannis is an atheist. You can criticize him for facilitating the wishes of another religious fanatic (Melisandre) but you can't very well call him a religious fanatic given that he doesn't believe in a deity.
Jaime is a monster, in the book series and the TV series. I can understand people enjoying his chapters and finding his character interesting, but when you get down to it he is one of the most morally reprehensible people in ASoIaF. As far as the sept scene in the book, I think you can argue that Cersei's protestations are part of her arousal, given that she displays the same behaviour with Jaime in Winterfell and also Oswell Kettleblack.
Edit: But I do understand that fans of the character are upset, because this isn't consistent with the character they've come to know and like.

Stop it. Right now. A complex character had good and bad in him. He does morally questionable things usually when facing a tough decision. There's a sort of justification for the bad. There's a thought process.
If you rape, you're not good. If you make cancer kids laugh on Monday and rape on Tuesday, you're a bad guy. 
Jaime being complex would be him struggling with his love for his own sister. Struggling with the things he'd be willing to do for her. But rape? Rape is a heinous crime. There's no means to an end there, no tough decision he's making, no obstacle he's trying to overcome. He's just acting on impulse to rape. It ruins his character development.
The only silver lining here is that the scene didn't last too long and hopefully we can pretend the book version happened instead.

She didn't mention killing Tyrion again after their kiss, she just kind of pulled away and turned back towards Joff (her dead son for whom she was grieving, and it's understandable that maybe she didn't want to bang on his bier) and he then snapped with his "you're a hateful woman" stuff.

I do agree, but JaimeÂ is the OP topic of the thread.Â  Cersei is........at times,Â  unrecognizeable.Â  But, I think the outrage comes from the taking away of Cersei's body count and adding to Jaime's body count and crimes.Â  Cersei had most of her horrid acts handed off to Joffrey and it seems that Jaime gets new crimes invented just for him.Â  Crimes totally out of character are given to Jaime such as the killing of a family member and a rape.Â  That's why the cry is louder, that and I think everyone has become accustomed to the Cersei changes.Â  We keep getting slapped in the face with the Jaime ones out of the blue, IMO.Â

No, it's pretty much black and white that what he did with Bran is horrible. But here at least we see he's bad WITH A PURPOSE. It's not excusable, but there's a thought process. It's how far he'd go for his sister. How far he'd go to keep on being with her.
There's no such thought process in his raping of Cersei.

4809	Lann Casterly	2014-04-21	I think "unreliable narrator" gets mentioned far too often, and in far more contexts than it actually applies. Â A character may remember or retell something and genuinely get some details wrong because they don't have them all, or because they don't remember them correctly, or they may intentionally mislead or lie about something to mislead a character they are speaking to, and we may not have all the information to know what is true as readers. Â But when we get a scene in real time there is only so much the perceptions and biases of the POV can obscure what is actually taking place. Â Yes, it is taking place from only one perspective, and all the biases of that perspective, but a rape doesn't suddenly become ambiguous or not at all rape because Jaime is the POV rather than Cersei.

4811	Titan	2014-04-21	I think "unreliable narrator" gets mentioned far too often, and in far more contexts than it actually applies. ... Â Yes, it is taking place from only one perspective, and all the biases of that perspective, but a rape doesn't suddenly become ambiguous because Jaime is the POV rather than Cersei.


Really? You don't think that a raper and a rape victim would have different interpretations and experiences of a rape?
Â 
No, "unreliable narrator" cannot be mentioned enough.Â

She wanted Jaime to kill Tyrion, she (in herÂ whacko way) tried to manipulate his answer by playing on his desire (see Hippocras, on 21 Apr 2014 - 1:53 PM post). He got turned on and called her bluff. Whether the resulting act of bumping uglies was consentual or not simply adds to the fact that both of these characters at this point in time are bat sh&^% crazy.

We also have Cersei's POV. Â And nowhere in the subsequent books does she every say or think anything about the encounter being a rape.

I also don't think Tv-Cersei will consider it a rape. But that doesn't change that from Jaimes perspective, he in that moment doesn't care what she wants and says, he is ready to do it, whether she wants it or not.

You must be since you couldn't read the context of what you used as examples. 
First off, good job on not pointing where they actually DID anything out of malice. If angry thoughts/words are the same thing as rape top you, then I can see why you see it as no big deal, to you we're all rapists apparently.
Moreover, even their THOUGHTS are justified since you know, Ned was murdered, Arya/Sansa held hostage (well they think Arya).
But even that point I shouldn't hold against you, since you admitted you were blind and therefore couldn't see the part where Robb DIDN'T kill the Lannister hostages.

Correct.. my bad.. however there IS a debate going on here within the thread about this very thing...
4822	Hoo	2014-04-21	Â 
Can you explain how this scene, as depicted, wasn't rape?


Cersei is quite capable and powerful to get out of that situation at will. Â There was opportunity. Â 
She was able, but not willing to get out. She consented, not withstanding her weak objection to whether it is right.
Add to that she continued kissing him, it's a known weird sexual relationship. Â There is consent.
Â 
Now, no means no in today's society because we want to protect women not just from rape but from any physical altercation regarding sexual advances after the no is uttered. Â So all the weight is on men. Â That is fine and dandy. Â But it does not apply to what we saw in this episode. Â This is a different world and a different kind of woman and a relationship, and Jamie is not full strength either.
4823	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	Can we stop? I can't believe this thread has turned into a discussion on whether it was rape or not. It was. D&D are saying so, they said he forced himself on Cersei. Some of the stuff people are writing to justify it and say it wasn't rape are disgusting.
Â 
Why are they making Jaime worse and whitewashing all the other Lannisters? That's the question.
4824	Cas Stark	2014-04-21	Â

They created a serious problem for themselves. Â They could have played the scene the way it was in the books, where it is clear that at the end she's consenting and that her objections are about the location and getting caught, not about the sexual aspect of the relationship...which is what they did in the show, especially since she rejected him already this season. Â This would at least have been defensible in context of their relationship.
Â 
So, her not considering it rape, as it was depicted in the show, will be a problem, a self inflicted problem that they created by a very poorly put together segment.

4826	Hath4	2014-04-21	in all honesty this scene was not that bad compared to last week when the show opened with ramsay hunting an innocent girl through the woods forÂ sport and dehumanizing her in to meat for his bitches.Â Jamie is still an angel compared to that.Â Â but this scene could have been handled way better.

4827	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-21	In the other interview, Graves is providing a sense of his first reaction when handed the script and reading it. The first interview discusses what they eventually tried to put into the scene. It matches up fairly well with what Coster-Waldau also said, so I think "first impressions" for Graves was that it was a rape scene, and then he and the actors worked through it and came up with something rather more complicated, in their minds.
I guess it goes to show that those who argue that the show needs less nuance and subtlety and grey areas than the books because audiences can't handle complexity would be right in this specific occasion.

If they wanted it to look like Cersei was all for it they shouldn't have had her repeatedly saying no throughout the scene, and maybe a fight at the beginning, but her complete submission midway through, then her being somewhat of an aggressor towards the end.  But it seemed like a rape to me.  She kept saying no throughout the entire scene and struggled throughout it as well.
4828	Ran	2014-04-21	The director and one of the actors say different?Let me add that what David says after indicating that it's a difficult scene because Jaime force himself on her is that, "It was a tricky scene to shoot."

If it's an unambiguous rape, what is "tricky" about shooting it?I find it doubtful that Graves, Headey, and Coster-Waldau never went over the scene with D&D -- one of whom is practically always on set when filming is going on -- and so I think the preponderance of evidence is that the scene was intended to be "tricky", that it was intended to be difficult and complicated.Much as Cersei's and Jaime's relationship, for that matter.I can totally accept they botched it and did a bad job of conveying its complexities and ambiguities, of course. I'm just saying that the intent from at least some, and perhaps all, the involved parties was not what many are taking out of it. That's their problem, of course, and I wonder how they'll rectify it.

4831	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	I can't take the outrage seriously because I see people claiming this topic is "disturbing", "makes them sick" and wondering if their girlfriends will be safe on the streets. The amount of hyperbole is too damn high.Â 
Â 
The fandom is always at it's worst when it compares a fictional event in the books to some real life controversy. There are people in this thread judging other posters for their acceptance of Jaime's actions, because some of us don't view it as rape.

Sure, if you view what happened as not rape, then it makes sense that you object to the disagreement as "disturbing." To you, it's not. No one who thinks that it was not rape is "going to be sick" if someone believes it was rape. For those of us on the other side, though, hearing explanations for why what we saw as rape - and, by the way, what HBO has come out and said was rape - was not really rape for all the cliche reasons, is indeed disturbing. Our reaction to fiction reveals a lot about our characters: who we are, what we believe, etc. And yeah, people on this forum who have basically said that there are situations in which verbal and physical resistance can be ignored do creep me out. Have you ever had a loved one who was the victim of a sexual assault? You might try reflecting before scoffing at other's concerns.
And no one is treating this as a real-life incident (although apparently worrying about those is grounds for not being taken seriously, haha derp). Readers aren't up in arms because someone got raped on GoT. Readers are up in arms because a popular character and his story was seriously disfigured. Readers are up in arms because a gruesome and gratuitous change was made.

It's a collaborative medium.And it's tricky because shooting a violent scene is difficult.That's one reading, but it's hardly the only one. It seems easier to suppose that all the people were on the same page, rather than supposing monumental miscommunication between the EPs/writers and the director/actors.
4839	NomadicDirewolf	2014-04-21	When I saw the scene originally I was thinking that it was a big departure from what happened in the books, and wasnt reflective of what book jaime might have done, but actually reading that passage from the book in detail, they get pretty far into that scene before Cersei actually says yes, so Jaime probably intended to go through with it either way. So, the way I see it the fact that he was going to rape her in both book and show is the important thing, whether she later gave consent or not is secondary, either way he was fine with raping her. Its possible she might have said no for different reasons in book and show, but either way its a no. So book jaime would have done that, and im willing to accept that perhaps Cersei doesnt so much consent as eventually capitulate to Jaime. Its very interesting how a PoV can change a scene completely
What was bad about it was that it was definitely poorly handled by the show, as the way they did the scene made Jaime seem like an arsehole (saying 'I dont care') Â and I question whether they should have included that scene in the show like that even if that was the way it was in the books, as seeing on screen clearly makes the unsullied think a lot less of Jaime than the sullied thought of him when they read that scene, and that undoes a lot of his character development over season 3 and this Â season.
However, i dont see the issue that it seems that some viewers have with the show depicting rape like this (aside from the fact its Jaime) if it were a softer show, I could agree, but, as bad as rape is, we have seen things worse than this, babies have been killed, children have died in most circumstances imaginable (only last week we saw a very graphic death of a kid) loads of characters have died horribly, and we also saw Drogo rape Dany in S1, alot more explicitly, yet many people like Drogo, this scene is not a step too far in this respect at all
Its definitely rape, but, because of the times, I doubt either Jaime or Cersei would see it that way. Still, its going to be interesting to see what GRRM has to say about this scene and how it relates to its book counterpart

4840	goddessoftitsandwine	2014-04-21	I get why people find the book scene problematic (I mean, aside from the dead son and the incest on the altar factors). Â With most other characters, that scene would probably read like the woman only gave "consent" because she was pressured into it by the man, which yes, would be rape. Â A "yes" under duress is not a real "yes".Â 
Â 
But we know Cersei, and we know that she is able and willing to slap/attack someone for much less than forcing themselves on her. Â When she's hurt or angry, she lashes out, harshly, either physically or with words. Â She's a very narcissistic person and most of her actions are based solely on her own desires, and so I don't feel like she would experience the kind of pressure that would drive a lot of other people to say "yes" when they really mean "no"--the pressure usually stems from some kind of guilt or shame, and those don't ring true with Cersei. Â And in the book, she makes her desires clear. Â She changed her mind, not because Jaime was pushing her into it, but because she wanted something out of it. Â She wanted the sex, too. Â Her objection was to the location, not the sex itself, and she made the move to start the sex, not him. Â It's always important to listen to what the person says and feels, and Cersei did not feel violated by the encounter, which makes me feel like her consent was completely genuine.
Â 
We can still judge Jaime for not listening to her during the first half of the encounter, and I'm not sure if he would have kept going if she'd continued to say no and slapped him to stop. Â I'd like to think he wouldn't have continued, not because I think he's a great guy, but because rape is one thing he's expressed disgust with in the past. Â Most of his crimes were committed to protect Cersei, not to hurt her. Â But I can understand if someone reads that passage and feels like Jaime would've continued to force himself on her, because we already saw that he wasn't listening to her, and he was so focused on his own pain at losing his hand he couldn't spare a few seconds to consider she was deeply in grief over losing her child. Â Jaime can be just as selfish as Cersei and that was an example of it. Â 
Â 
Now the show scene was straight up rape and I'm not sure how anyone can see it otherwise. Â There was no moment where Cersei gave verbal consent, but rather she continued to fight him and he actually said "I don't care". Â And that's hugely different from the book scene. Â (Also, go figure, they were more willing to erase her consent than having her be on her period. Â Apparently they're only into blood when it's a gory beheading.)
4841	Jasta11	2014-04-21	The director and one of the actors say different?
Let me add that what David says after indicating that it's a difficult scene because Jaime force himself on her is that, "It was a tricky scene to shoot." Well, wait a minute. If it's an unambiguous rape, what is "tricky" about shooting it?
I find it doubtful that Graves, Headey, and Coster-Waldau never went over the scene with D&D -- one of whom is practically always on set when filming is going on -- and so I think the preponderance of evidence is that the scene was intended to be "tricky", that it was intended to be difficult and complicated.
Much as Cersei's and Jaime's relationship, for that matter.


Â 
It IS hard to know exactly what happens when these two are concerned. Someone has indicated that all of Cercei's sex scenes with Jaime in the books start with her saying no. While I certainly don't think the scene in the sept was the kind of harmless kinkiness that Asha and Qarl have going on in the novels, after a rewatch it's harder to say it was categorically a rape, I have to admit.
Â 
Basically, their relationship is so fucked up in so many ways, both in the books and the show, that I don't see how overly forceful sex changes it that much. I certainly don't see how it can possibly be a character-destroying moment for Jaime ''killing children is OK'' Lannister.
4842	Formerly Tetrarch42	2014-04-21	You must be since you couldn't read the context of what you used as examples.
1. First off, good job on not pointing where they actually DID anything out of malice. If angry thoughts/words are the same thing as rape top you, then I can see why you see it as no big deal, to you we're all rapists apparently.
2. Moreover, even their THOUGHTS are justified since you know, Ned was murdered, Arya/Sansa held hostage (well they think Arya).
But even that point I shouldn't hold against you, since you admitted you were blind and therefore couldn't see the part where Robb DIDN'T kill the Lannister hostages.


1. Unfair characterization, I never said anything was no big deal.
2. You could argue that Jaime's actions were justified since you know, Bran could have gotten them all executed. The same rationalization can be used for the rape - "Jaime was trying to preserve the relationship", or what have you. But that's all it is, a rationalization - the act is wrong in both cases. You can construe some flimsy "PURPOSE" for just about any action, the fact that there's a thought process has no bearing on the moral justification of the act itself.
3. I didn't even mention Lannister hostages. Nice strawman. He did intend to exact vengeance on the Lannisters, even after they'd killed his father. Not like he was going to rescue his dad's headless corpse. Your criterion for being bad seems to amount to "if you do something evil for its own sake". You add the qualifier "basically" - but that's just a superfluous word. Murdering and pillaging in the Westerlands because you're angry some family killed your dad fits your definition.
*It's pretty rude and malicious to insult someone just because they've lost their sight. Edit: Is that why you're KalibakCruel?

"Then Jaime comes in and rapes her." Enough excuses, enough saying rape is a blurred line rather than black and white. It was written as rape (why else would you change "yes, do me now, like that, etc" and Cersei guiding Jaime inside of her to "stop, it's not right," and Cersei pushing Jaime away?) and directed as rape.

Â 
I do agree, they expect tv audiences to just go......whatever, and tune in next week.Â  Next week, Cersei will probably be offering sex for Sansa's head, or help with Tywin trying to steal Tommen, or whatever, and the sept scene will never be addressed by Cersei and Jaime, other than in the same manner in the books, I suspect, if at all.Â  Cersei will give the......have to be careful speech.Â  With Jaime already calling Cersei hateful, I wonder if we'll still get him harping on wanting to marry her or not, but I doubt the actual sex scene and it's 'rapeyness' will ever be addressed.Â

Uh... what ?
Â 
And yes, I really feel they're going to completely shrug it off and have Cersei try and seduce him into killing Tyrion; which would have been fine (since it's how it plays in the books), if they fucking hadn't made him rape her beforehand.
4849	FNF	2014-04-21	My opinion hasn't changed at all- this is getting waaaay out of hand... Jaime initially FORCES himself on Cersei in the books as well. Would all of you really not give a shit so long as Cersei just added in a 'yes'? The fact of the matter is that Cersei starts kissing Jaime before the end of the scene anyway, thereby giving consent while in the books, she only starts saying 'yes' when it starts 'feeling good'.
Â 
In short, the difference between how this scene is depicted in the books to the show is no where near as big as some are making it out to be, and this is coming from someone who's usually quite critical of how D&D approach some of the changes.
4850	Le Cygne	2014-04-21	It's astounding, the problems that D&D create with their desire to 'rewrite.'Â  They chose the first scene with Cersei refusing Jaime sex, and they chose this hot mess.Â  They could have had their early Jaime in KL along with doing the scene correctly, they just decided not to do so.Â  Same with the Thenns, the more I see them, the more I don't like the rewrite.Â  Same with The Hound this episode.Â  They really confuddle me with their rewrite choices, more and more.Â  Stannis, I'm not sure I knew him this week, LOLÂ  He wasn't the same D&D Stannis, but he wasn't bookStannis, either.Â They need to curtail some of their rewriting, it's becoming more and more horrid.I know, the characters aren't even consistent with who they used to be on the show, much less the books. What they did to the Hound and Jaime in in the same episode, two of my favorite characters, I am so bummed. And Dany is like, everyone matters to me but Daario? Really? Because she wasn't that way last season, much to Jorah's dismay. I gave up on show Sansa a long time ago. Thank goodness they left Brienne out of this hot mess.

The same rationalization can be used for the rape - "Jaime was trying to preserve the relationship", or what have you. But that's all it is, a rationalization - the act is wrong in both cases. You can construe some flimsy "PURPOSE" for just about any action, the fact that there's a thought process has no bearing on the moral justification of the act itself.
3. I didn't even mention Lannister hostages. Nice strawman. He did intend to exact vengeance on the Lannisters, even after they'd killed his father. Not like he was going to rescue his dad's headless corpse. Your criterion for being bad seems to amounts to "if you do something evil for its own sake". You add the qualifier "basically" - but that's just a superfluous word. Murdering and pillaging in the Westerlands because you're angry some family killed your dad fits your definition.
*It's pretty rude and malicious to insult someone just because they've lost their sight. Edit: Is that why you're KalibakCruel?

1. Fair point.
2. Rape doesn't have a purpose. It's that simple. Throwing Bran off was horrible but there was a purpose. He wasn't some guy who enjoyed killing kids to get his rocks off. Raping Cersei is him forcefully wanting to get some. The only thought process there is that she led him on and hasn't given him any since he got there. Not only is it bad, but there's the issue of doing it NOW. He tossed Bran in episode 1. Lately he's been on an upswing. Rape doesn't make you grey. Making a tough decision in a tough spot makes you grey. That's my point.
3. What straw man? You clearly pointed out his wanting to kill all Lannisters, I just pointed out that he didn't even do that when given the chance. And let's not equate war tactics with other things. Life is not black and white, so the things we do need to be taken in context of WHY we did them to fully judge them. 
I didn't mean to be insulting (maybe chippy with my did you read what I wrote comment) and I was mostly jumping on your blind comment. If I came off as insulting I apologize completely, it wasn't my intent and clearly I'm in the wrong here.

I do agree, they expect tv audiences to just go......whatever, and tune in next week.Â  Next week, Cersei will probably be offering sex for Sansa's head, or help with Tywin trying to steal Tommen, or whatever, and the sept scene will never be addressed by Cersei and Jaime, other than in the same manner in the books, I suspect, if at all.Â  Cersei will give the......have to be careful speech.Â  With Jaime already calling Cersei hateful, I wonder if we'll still get him harping on wanting to marry her or not, but I doubt the actual sex scene and it's 'rapeyness' will ever be addressed.Â 


Â 
Exactly. Â "Whatever" Â is their attitude. Â I gave up on complaining about what I saw as stupid plot holes where things didn't match up week to week or lack a certain amount of basic logic...but this is a HUGE character change...I'm sure their thinking was, hey, if we make it more 'rapey' it will generate more controversy, and that was the end of it. Â 
Â 
ETA...this kind of gives me hope they may yet have Tyrion kill Shae, because even though that would destroy his character on the show, it would be REALLY shocking, LOL>

I agree they did it for shock, but they may have overplayed their hand here. Â This isn't Jamie killing some random Lannister cousin that no one but book readers are going to care that kinslaying is a line he never crossed, this is what to the overwhelming number of viewers and critics was a rape. Â So, when next week everyone goes on about their business like nothing major happened, which is what I predict, the audience is going to be annoyed and so will the critics.


Â 
They did, and they backed themselves into a corner.
Â 
Â 


You can't discount the director and actors. It's a collaborative medium.
That's one reading, but it's hardly the only one. It seems easier to suppose that all the people were on the same page, rather than supposing monumental miscommunication between the EPs/writers and the director/actors.


Â 
But the director also said in another interview it was rape, so it's hard to tell where Alex Graves actually stands. As for ncw, he said it's rape yes and no. Which is basically just him not taking much of a position, understandably because it's a touchy subject.
4855	The Eunuch	2014-04-21	Can we stop? I can't believe this thread has turned into a discussion on whether it was rape or not. It was. D&D are saying so, they said he forced himself on Cersei. Some of the stuff people are writing to justify it and say it wasn't rape are disgusting.


Â 
Thank you.
Â 
One day we might have "Why did they show Euron rape a woman? He's clearly a sweet man in the books...".

It IS hard to know exactly what happens when these two are concerned. Someone has indicated that all of Cercei's sex scenes with Jaime in the books start with her saying no. While I certainly don't think the scene in the sept was the kind of harmless kinkiness that Asha and Qarl have going on in the novels, after a rewatch it's harder to say it was categorically a rape, I have to admit.
Â 
Basically, their relationship is so fucked up in so many ways, both in the books and the show, that I don't see how overly forceful sex changes it that much. I certainly don't see how it can possibly be a character-destroying moment for Jaime ''killing children is OK'' Lannister.


Â 
I do agree that on the rewatch it didn't seem as much like rape, but that right there.......shows it is strange.Â  I'm not sure if I felt that way because I'd already viewed the scene once, I know the book version, Cersei's physical participation was more noticeable on the rewatch, or all the above.Â  But, still, I was disturbed by Jaime's wording and demeanor.Â  That, and well, there's a difference between him seeing Cersei for the first time and declaring her a hateful woman before all this happens.Â  I was trying to rewatch and see if I was being too touchy, but then I hit the D&D ending with David saying he forced himself on her.Â  Granted, now I'm wondering if he's calling force something different than rape, and THAT is a bit disturbing.Â 
Â 
The thing is, they chose this mess, instead of making it a part of Cersei and Jaime's normal sex games, and using the scene to show the differences that are developing in the two of them.Â  Cersei wants to hide the truth, and Jaime doesn't care if the whole world knows, he wants them to know.Â 
Â 
I do need to rewatch the D&D commentary, but honestly, the commented on all the sept scenes and paid more attention to Tywin and Tommen and Cersei than to Jaime and Cersei.Â  That and the fact that David said 'forced' is what stands out in my mind is why I want to rewatch.Â  Unfortunately, my OnDemand probably cycled back to the start of the episode, and it's hard to FF OnDemand in a speedy manner.Â  Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh.Â

Â 
I think if their goal was for the audience to see that by the end of the encounter it became consensual that they failed. Â I can barely see any possible consent on the screen and that is with me having read the books and looking for it, and it for certain isn't in the dialogue which is where it needs to be, not in barely perceptible body motions.
4858	MsLibby	2014-04-21	The director and one of the actors say different?
Let me add that what David says after indicating that it's a difficult scene because Jaime force himself on her is that, "It was a tricky scene to shoot." Well, wait a minute. If it's an unambiguous rape, what is "tricky" about shooting it?
I find it doubtful that Graves, Headey, and Coster-Waldau never went over the scene with D&D -- one of whom is practically always on set when filming is going on -- and so I think the preponderance of evidence is that the scene was intended to be "tricky", that it was intended to be difficult and complicated.
Much as Cersei's and Jaime's relationship, for that matter.
I can totally accept they botched it and did a bad job of conveying its complexities and ambiguities, of course. I'm just saying that the intent from at least some, and perhaps all, the involved parties was not what many are taking out of it. That's their problem, of course, and I wonder how they'll rectify it.


Â 
Can they rectify it at all? That genie is out of the bottle and there isn't any real way to push her back in.
Â 
My only hope is, as i've said before, this is Jaime's lowest point. It's his "Smiling Knight" moment. When he sees he has become the man he didn't weant to be.

4860	Lann Casterly	2014-04-21	Really? You don't think that a raper and a rape victim would have different interpretations and experiences of a rape?
Â 
No, "unreliable narrator" cannot be mentioned enough.Â 


Â 
Â 
The most notable example I can think of where GRRM explicitly links something to "unreliable narrator" is Sansa's mistaken memory of the Hound kissing her, which never took place. Â It is not Sansa's real time experience that is unreliable, not to say her real time experience was unaffected by her own biases or stresses at the time, but it is her recollection of that experience quite a bit after the fact that is "unreliable narrator." Â Mistaken recollection of details after the fact is a far cry from "man rapes woman in reality, but experiences it as consensual sex in real time in his POV"

Â 
Agreed. Especially at the end, which is the point where apparently it stops being forced, Cersei seemed really distressed. And again, most people won't discuss it and think about it like we do here, most viewers will watch it the one time, and make up their mind. And most are calling it rape. I've yet to see a professional review that doesn't, in fact.
4863	Ran	2014-04-21	As Sepinwall notes, there's no way that they can rectify it this season, anyways, if they didn't expect the audience to take something out of it that they hadn't intended the audience to take away from it.There's at least one more Cersei-Jaime scene this season which may indicate whether the status quo has shifted since this scene or not.

I'm not ignoring any interview. They're both horrid. Rape doesn't "become consensual." That's absurd, and the director should be laughed out of town for outing himself as such a misogynist.

Â 
I do agree, alot seems to be about the shock factor.Â  They seem to want this season to up the anti and not be just the Episode 9 shocker, as usual.Â 
Â 
I'm usually very easygoing with the show changes, much easier than most book readers.Â  Maybe I just was too hopeful after the first two episodes this year.Â  Last year was maybe my hardest year with disappointment, in the beginning of the season.Â 
Â 
Next week they will just move on, though, I suspect.Â
4867	Lann Casterly	2014-04-21	Â 
It was all for shock, they never meant it in a way to impact the characters and move the story forward. And that's why it's even more annoying.


Â 
I agree, I think the intent was somewhat similar to the addition of Robb's pregnant wife to the Red Wedding.
4868	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-21	I know, the characters aren't even consistent with who they used to be on the show, much less the books. What they did to the Hound and Jaime in in the same episode, two of my favorite characters, I am so bummed. And Dany is like, everyone matters to me but Daario? Really? Because she wasn't that way last season, much to Jorah's dismay. I gave up on show Sansa a long time ago. Thank goodness they left Brienne out of this hot mess.


Â 
I have a friend who wants to know why Daario went from a 10 to a 6, kinda joking.Â  I'm usually in favor of recasts when necessary, I wish they had recast the GreatJon, but I'm not feeling New Daario BE Daario, ya know?
Â 
Oh well, I need to stop complaining and do something today.Â  I'll post if I find more interesting comments from the HBO Inside the Episode segment.Â  I tried to rewatch with a new eye, but was still somewhat disappointed.Â  D&D's after episode comments just cemented that for me.Â
4869	Sun	2014-04-21	From the HOllywood Reporter Graves interview:
Â 

Â 
Why was it so important to have Joffrey's body in the scene?
He is their first born. He is their sin. He is their lust, and their love -- their everything. If he's gone, what's going to happen? Jaime is still trying to believe as hard as he possibly can that he's in love with Cersei. He can't admit that he is traumatized by his family and he's been forced his whole life to be something he doesn't want to be. What he is -- but has to deny -- is he is actually the good knight, like Brienne.

Â 
So, from the bolded I take that they will use the scene in the sept as his "hitting bottom" point, as the final catalyst for a sea change in Jaime's outlook on his life.Â
4870	birch	2014-04-21	Â She did try a bit to get him to stop but I never thought the scene was rape. it was forcfull yes, but not rape.
No doubt, it was rape.

Â 
You might be surprised. Have you ever heard of the "she said no, but meant yes" or "she ended up liking it" as rapist defense arguments? This is what would skew someones immediate thoughts on their action.Â 
Â 
And just because Cersei doesn't class it as rape in a later POV chapter doesn't mean that it didn't feel that way for her. (Or does she ever explicitly recall/think about that event in a chapter - I can't recall) It's not like GRRM does a massive info-dump on the narrators most painful memories at the start of every chapter.

Â 
Right. Â Because committing rape usually is what causes your epiphany that you're the "good knight". Â
4873	Opethian	2014-04-21	Why are some posters saying that murder and child abuse is easier to stomach in the show because it's not likely to happen to them in the real world?
Â 
According to the FBI, there were 14,748 homicides in the United States in 2010 alone.
Â 
According to a 2001 report fromÂ UNICEF, the United States has the highest rate of deaths from child abuse and neglect of any industrialized nation, at 2.4 per 100,000 children. Â Hell, just last week a woman in Utah admitted to throwing 6 of her babies in the trash.Â 
Â 
Â 
Jaime murders his (teenage?) cousin by bashing his head in with a rock. His skull crushed, his nostrils filling with blood and mud, his brains painting the rock, his lifeless body defecating as he twitches. He will never love again, he will never smile again, his family will never see him again, nor will they know what truly happened to him. Little to no moral outrage from bloggers, message boards, internet news sites, or twitter folk.Â 
Â 
One minute the audience can say, "these arent real people, it's just a show." But when people want to get on their high horse, they say:, "That was unwatchable!", "Jaime better be punished next episode!", "Look at how women are treated!"
Â 
(and yes, I know not everyone on this board lives in the United States, but most of the whining certainly seems to be coming from there)

I was going to post this exact same thing. Still, interesting quote that shows how the showrunners understand Jaime's motivations.
4876	Hippocras	2014-04-21	She didn't mention killing Tyrion again after their kiss, she just kind of pulled away and turned back towards Joff (her dead son for whom she was grieving, and it's understandable that maybe she didn't want to bang on his bier) and he then snapped with his "you're a hateful woman" stuff.
Â 

No you are right, I got that detail a bit wrong.
How it actually went is that she told him he had to kill Tyrion. He said no. Up until that point she had been grieving but keeping a neutral dynamic with him. But he said no, and she had a little annoyed look about him defying her wishes. Then she had a little breakdown and kissed him - which she had refused to do up until that point since she first saw him without his hand. Then she pulled away in revulsion because of the hand.
However it was still apparent that she was dangling the possibility she would let things go back to how they had been between them if he killed Tyrion. Something she knew he wanted. So it was still clearly use of sex to manipulate him to do murder.
4877	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-21	Â 
I'm a huge Stannis fan too, but I disagree. Stannis in the show is essentially a completely different character, so it's less jarring having him act like a dick for no reason, because he always acts like a dick for no reason in the show. Having a largely book-faithful adaptation of a POV character suddenly take an insane detour in to WTF, insanely-out-of-character Â territory, is far more jolting.Â 
Â 
I mean... Jaime raping Cersei.. what the hell were the writers even thinking when they wrote that? Social media has exploded in outrage, even from show-only viewers. It doesn't fit with anything they've seen him do for the past season and a bit.


Although they've butchered the character, and made him far less compelling, Stannis is still recognizably Stannis in the show. My point is that, when you change the context of an event, (for example, burning Alester for being an "infidel" rather than for trying to sell his daughter to the Lannisters) the tone of the event is altered, as are the characters in question. In both the book and the show, Stannis burns a man alive. In both the book and the show, Jaime has sexual intercourse with Cersei during their dead son's vigil. The difference is that Jaime raping Cersei, instead of having consensual, though admittedly agressive sex, severely damages the character. I feel bad for fans of Jaime, and I'm not too pleased about it myself because I really like where his story goes in A Feast for Crows, but I find it telling that what happened to Jaime is considered a legitmate complaint by most, while those of us frustrated with the show's adaptation of Stannis are treated like petulant whiners.

That's why I can't take anything they're saying seriously. I love Jaime, but no fucking way he's a "good knight like Brienne". He wishes he was even half the person Brienne is, and that's pretty much why she inspires him in the first place.

Â And, I can't say strongly enough that I am not a Jamie fan, I don't think he's "redeemed", he's still an arrogant asshole who now on occasion does something good because it serves his vanity...but he wouldn't have raped his sister. Â It wasn't a rape in the book and the character of "Jamie Lannister" is defined by two things, his skill with a sword and his love affair with his sister, he would not destroy it by raping her. Â The whole premise of the scene as a rape which HBO threw in is absord

Â 
He's already realized this in the show.

You should tell her to watch the first episode of the season again - this season is clearly showing him falling out of love with her and starting to hate her.
But still with a streak of asshole, especially when she is concerned. He is basically quite confused.

Don't try to think too deeply about it. The show is not targeted to thoughtful people, but to a demographic which necessitated "sexposition."
4888	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-21	I just figure that Jaime and Cersei are one of those couples that have to argue and anger each other and then have some sort of makeup sex / hate-fuck. Face it, their relationship is pretty fucked-up to start with.
Not that having a go beside your dead son's coffin is not pushing that "WTF" envelope all on its own.

None of their comments about this segment make any sense, so I have to believe this is CYA mode of trying to explain something they didn't think they were going to have to explain. Â And, I can't say strongly enough that I am not a Jamie fan, I don't think he's "redeemed", he's still an arrogant asshole who now on occasion does something good because it serves his vanity...but he wouldn't have raped his sister. Â It wasn't a rape in the book and the character of "Jamie Lannister" is defined by two things, his skill with a sword and his love affair with his sister, he would not destroy it by raping her. Â The whole premise of the scene as a rape which HBO threw in is absord


Â 
I don't know; I do disagree about the scene in the book not being a rape, but I'm not interested in debating what constitutes it. For me, that particular explanation is interesting, because it's as if Jaime is raping himself also. Â He's forcing his will to love Cersei and be the man he was (who he realizes is "hateful") on himself as he's physically forcing himself on her. It's a moment where he may realize that life is gone now, and he's not that man anymore. It's a very dark, twisted, fucked up moment for him. His hatred isn't just about her, but hatred for himself.
Â 
Don't get me wrong...I don't mean to imply Jaime's the victim here. He rapes Cersei and there's no excusing that or painting it in a better light. I found watching that scene incredibly upsetting, and not easy to get through. I just think that comment about it is an interesting angle, and one that I didn't consider before.
4890	Travy1991	2014-04-21	The rape scene...and it is rape...didn't sit well with me either, even though I enjoyed the rest of the episode immensely. The reason why I think Dan and David made that choice is because, once again, they underestimate the audience's intelligence. It's a case of anvilicious "Incest is bad mmmkay, and clearly not healthy! See viewers? See, how bad incest is and see how unhealthy it is? Look what it does to Jaime? Look how unhealthy it is for both twins? Consensual sex, no we can't show that, people might think we're condoning incest! We can't have people think that."
Â 
Look, I'm a defender of the show. I think D&D do a decent job of the adaptation and I'm not a book purist. But whenever they stray away from George's text, they screw things up and make it worse (this does not include scenes which happen "off-page" in the novels like Robert and Cersei's conversation about their marriage but when they try and "improve" on scenes from the book like the silly Show!Robb arc and elements of the Qarth storyline). The guys are inconsistent writers who are very lucky to have some strong writing from George to adapt.Â They deserve all the criticism they get for this scene though.
Â 
Going back to the scene, it was just badly done. You have Jaime and Cersei kiss, then Jaime's mood seems to just change instantly and he scoffs "Why do the gods make me love such a hateful woman?!" (Melodramatic and again bashing the viewer over the head about how messed up this relationship is). And yes, I did notice Cersei kissed Jaime back but the scene cuts out with Jaime forcing himself inside Cersei and Cersei crying. A major lack of insensitivity on the writers and director's part. I think we viewers find incest beside the corpse of their dead son in a sept disturbing enough without adding rape to it.

I actually agree. That is definitely the dynamic the show has set up between them, particularly in their other sex scenes.

Â 
It was equally difficult to shoot, as Nikolaj wanted to convey the sceneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s true intentions, as written by GRRM.
â<U+0080><U+009C>It was tough to shoot, as well. There is significance in that scene, and it comes straight from the booksâ<U+0080><U+0094>itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s George R.R. Martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mind at play. It took me awhile to wrap my head around it, because I think that, for some people, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just going to look like rape. The intention is that itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not just that; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s about two people whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve had this connection for so many years, and much of it is physical, and much of it has had to be kept secret, and this is almost the last thing left now. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s him trying to force her back and make him whole again because of his stupid hand.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Nikolaj also answers the definitive question: was it rape?
â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes, and no. There are moments where she gives in, and moments where she pushes him away. But itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not pretty.â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
I completely agree ^
4894	jet199	2014-04-21	What did he say right after? He refers to reading the script. The "Then Jaime comes in and rapes her" is representing his initial reaction on reading the script.
The other interview, probably from a similar point in time, says,
Â 
Which is commentary about how it ends up as rehearsed and directed. Graves and the actors, doubtless with oversight from D&D (who are omnipresent on set, generally), decided it wasn't just a rape scene, it was more complicated than that.
Now, you can either decide that you don't like one interview and you're going to ignore it, which is pretty obviously intellectually weak, or you can try to reconcile the two. The above does so.


Â 
How can it become "consensual by the end" if she knows she has no way out of the situation? No wonder they can't get that idea across to the audience, it is unbelievable. In the UK "Straw Dogs" was banned for decades because of a similar scene. I think the sept scene in GOT was much better than the rape but she likes it scene in Straw Dogs because Cersei didn't suddenly start enjoying herself. She may have kissed him back but she didn't suddenly switch from fighting him off to being wet and willing once a cock was inside her. There is a good chance that shooting the scene exactly as in the book would have caused the show more problems with the media and maybe even censors than the altered scene is causing with fans. I prefer them leaving out the "do me"s if it means the shown doesn't get banned.
Â 
I do wonder if the reason people are so unhappy about Jaime being shown as a rapist (the only reason they don't see this in the book is that it is through Jaime's eyes and he assumes she still feels the same way) is because people have this idea of rapists as monsters rather than ordinary human beings. Good looking, friendly, sympathetic guys can be rapist. Blokes who can get any girl they want can be rapist. People who are your friends, relatives, partners can be rapists. It is not uncommon that if someone brings a rape case they have to endure threats and abuse from their attackers friends and family because people assume that rapists are some kind of different species and they would just know if they came across one.
Â 
Seriously Jaime would be a serial killer if he was in the real world, would you be shocked if a known serial killer turned out to be a rapist?

But in the book, he rejects her.
Â 
He comes back to KL, and, after his travails, he wants to be a better man, and she isn't interested in any of that. Â She is the one who wants everything the way it was, him under her thumb, doing whatever she tells him. Â And it is his own enlightenment that moves him away from her and makes him willing to chart his own path.
Â 
I don't see how you can get there from here, when "here" is a rape, and they doubled down on this by having her already reject him. Â So, the new mode is going to be...his sister rejected him, then he raped her, and then he decided to be the 'good knight'? Â That's just bad storytelling.

It is more complex than that.
She rejected him in one episode, then defended her territory against Brienne regarding him in the next epidsode, then in this one, used a kiss, previously denied, to try to get him to commit murder after he initially refused.
Then he took her by force after that profoundly confusing and manipulative hot-cold sequence.

4898	Labirints	2014-04-21	Yeah, that scene was pretty weird... They just had to cut it at the worst possible moment...
4899	Jaime4Brienne	2014-04-21	I was horrified by the sept scene. It was nothing like that in the books. In the show its basically a straight up rape. In the books she's not happy about the place where he wants to have sex but she guides him inside of her and it WASNT rape in my opinion.
Poor Jaime! He's guilty of so many bad things he doesn't need his reputation blackened further by something he didn't even do!
4900	Lann Casterly	2014-04-21	Â 
You might be surprised. Have you ever heard of the "she said no, but meant yes" or "she ended up liking it" as rapist defense arguments? This is what would skew someones immediate thoughts on their action.Â 
Â 
And just because Cersei doesn't class it as rape in a later POV chapter doesn't mean that it didn't feel that way for her. (Or does she ever explicitly recall/think about that event in a chapter - I can't recall) It's not like GRRM does a massive info-dump on the narrators most painful memories at the start of every chapter.


Â 
Just because a rapist comes up with justifications or excuses after the fact, especially in a legal context after getting busted, does not mean they don't know it is a rape as they are doing it. Â In Jaime's POV it is clearly not rape taking place, no matter how sick what is taking place is. Â And as it is taking place in real time, he is not mistakenly remembering or recollecting anything, Cersei's lines and actions are happening in real time, and there is only so much that "unreliable narrator" can cover. Â It simply doesn't apply in this case, at least in the sense of the notion of Jaime perceiving a rape as a non-rape.

4902	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-21	Â 
Subtlety and nuance have their place, but not in a scene involving rape, unless it were being used to expose rape culture for the vile hypocritical mess that it is. That is not the case with this scene.

Yeah, I agree and  I am quite capable of perceiving nuance, thank you very much but not in that scene.  AND it a lot of scenes where subtlety and nuance would have helped, they didn't exactly provide it (e.g., Lack of humor in Theon's reunion with "Yarra", Melisandre not giving Stannis' maester a way out, Jon first meeting Mance, etc, etc)

That's an extremely simplistic way to look at it and I wouldn't agree. The act is far more complex than that, especially since Cersei goes back and forth between saying no and giving in to her lust. It's a good example of why discussions of the show can get very tedious though.

Â 
No, that's not the reason. The reason isÂ 
Â 
- Because it goes against what's the books
Â 
- because it goes against Jaime's characterisation in the show (save one woman from rape, but rape one yourself?)
Â 
- because they only did it for shock, with no intention of following it up (it's not an actual story arc, it will be dropped)

Yeah the promo showed a business-as-usual scene between them (Cersei asking him to kill), but obviously their dynamic has to be different after that. I'm confused and apprehensive as to where this is going and how it will be portrayed, but I'm less appalled than I was last night (mostly because rereading the chapter made me rethink Book!Jaime...I guess I had glossed over some of it before).

I don't care to argue whether this was rape or not (it was), it was already "debated" at great length in the earlier pages of this thread.
I was just debating the point that other poster was making that this rape scene had any sort of value other than shock value.

Did anyone else see her confrontation of Brienne about her being in love with him this way? Because to me it was quite clear. She was telling Brienne "back off. He's mine"

Â 
She was clearly upset about the prospect of Jaime finding someone else. But it's really irrelevant to the sept scene. As has been discussed countless times, rape within relationships and marriages happen. Even if Cersei did want to "claim" Jaime, that doesn't mean she forfeits the right to deny him sex.

Don't get me wrong...I don't mean to imply Jaime's the victim here. He rapes Cersei and there's no excusing that or painting it in a better light.

I think that fits to my impression. The way Jaime acts is maybe best described as similar to an addict. He desperatly needs her and he basically does everything to have her and keep he, his whole life is arranged around her and being with her, but in the end this "love" is making him do horrible things and turns him into a person he doesn't want to be. This to me climaxes in this scene in the books and also now in the show. I think it's safe to assume that also in the show he will start to realize more and more now, how being with Cersei basically keeps him from being the person he actually would prefer to be.
4920	SeventySeven	2014-04-21	Did anyone else see her confrontation of Brienne about her being in love with him this way? Because to me it was quite clear. She was telling Brienne "back off. He's mine"


I disagree. In the episode Cersei goes after Brienne, Pycelle, Oberyn and Ellaria and she finds something horrible to say to each and everyone of them. I doubt they wanted to show Cersei as being jealous of Brienne. She might be much prettier than in the books, but she's still masculine and made to look fairly plain, so I'd be surprised if Cersei was telling Brienne to back off.
Â 
Anyway, the way the scene was in the books was grotesque and twisted enough without turning it into rape. It was unnecessary.

Â 
But they're not playing it this way. Cersei dumped him, he raped her, how is she keeping him from being who he wants to be? If anything she's the one wanting to be done with it because she feels guilty (apparently).

Â 
That's my hope. Will the Unsullied have this reading of that scene? Doubtful. But moving forward I think there is huge potential for his "redemption," and it will be interesting to see how it's portrayed.
4922	MsLibby	2014-04-21	I also thought she was telling Brienne to back off.Â  Cersei killed a girl because she expressed an interest in Jaime. She's that type. Brienne probably got off lucky only because Cersei likely thought there was no chance of Jaime returning her feelings. If she had an inkling that he would, Brienne would need to watch everythign she ate or drank.

Â 
Some of the unsullied already are. I talked to a few friends who really didn't quite think he was a real rapist, only desperate enough to do it.Â
4924	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-21	I don't think they intended for it to come across in the way it did, but in the end it could only really be interpreted in one way. They messed up on this one because it sets Jaime's redemption back and essentially has him do something he was firmly against even when he was at his worst as a person.
4925	Widows_Blood	2014-04-21	So is the whole point of Jaime's character a guy who does good deed after good deed on a never ending upwards trajectory? Isn't the actual point to tell a compelling story? He is still the same character in the books, just with more shades of grey. This is at the core the same person who tried to kill a child, would have killed another child and cuckolded the king with his own sister. He still going to to do many good things going forward. And now the audience will grapple with their feelings about him, which could make for a very interesting personal drama. Oh he's helping Tyrion out but still have apprehensions about him based on past actions. George always says that nobody is all evil or good, that life is about choices. That is why many love Jaime. He is capable of making good decisions but at the same time, he has certain weaknesses and that makes him susceptible to making awful/horrible choices. Â
4926	Hippocras	2014-04-21	Woops, meant to write "irrelevant" instead of "relevant." Two characters makes a difference. All I was trying to say was discussing the Cersei/Brienne scene is a bit off-topic to this thread.
It was mentioned in the context of someone saying that Cersei had previously made it clear she didn't want him anymore. My point was it was much more complex than that, and she had been playing hot cold. SHE kissed HIM to try to get him to agree to murder Tyrion.
I still find it baffling how little outrage there is on this thread for her obvious use of the promise of things going back to how they were (twincest) if Jamie murdered Tyrion. It was its own form of sexual violence IMO that certainly does not absolve Jamie, but that clearly shows she deserved being called hateful.

4927	Lann Casterly	2014-04-21	The issue isn't that a rape was portrayed, or that portraying a rape is worse than portraying the attempted or successful murder of a child, or any of the other terrible things portrayed on the show. Â It's that the character was portrayed as doing one of the few terrible things he is repeatedly shown having issues with in the books. Â As I said earlier, to me it was like if they had Ned turn around after all he said and did, and just murdered Daenerys himself. Â Jaime was willing to murder a child to conceal his and Cersei's relationship. Â Jaime was willing to do a lot of terrible things for house or family or love or whatever. Â Raping Cersei comes off as keeping the name, but creating a completely different character. Â I am not a Jaime fan. Â He may have some good to do before it's all said and done, but I am not rooting for him to escape the consequences of his actions, or to have a happy ending. Â But I think GRRM has done a great job writing the character, and that the show has really dropped the ball on this one.

Â 
I think this depends way more on what comes now than on this scene. The few unsullied I personally talked to about the scene were not as shocked as some people here seem to be. For them Cersei was beeing manipulative and Jaime angry and then while they all agreed it was "sort of a rape" they all take into account their pretty twisted relationship and don't see it as something completly out of character.

What the hell is a "real rapist"?Â 
Either you rape someone and you're a rapist or you don't and you're not.

Source?
4931	ovis alba	2014-04-21	What the hell is a "real rapist"?Â 
Either you rape someone and you're a rapist or you don't and you're not.


Â 
As my friends have similar thoughts I guess it's "a rapist that is not really considering it rape, because it is within a relationship that has always had this sort of tension of doing something forbidden".
4932	MsLibby	2014-04-21	What the hell is a "real rapist"?Â

After I wrote that I thought it was a bad way to phrase what I meant to say.
Â 
And I agree, after what he did to Cersei his actions are clearly that of a man who forced himself upon a woman.Â  But in our discussions (my friends and I, who haven't read the books), they made the distinction that Jaime's not the type of guy to do this regularly. He was a rapist in this situation, but not likely to do it in others.
4933	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	It was mentioned in the context of someone saying that Cersei had previously made it clear she didn't want him anymore. My point was it was much more complex than that, and she had been playing hot cold. SHE kissed HIM to try to get him to agree to murder Tyrion.

Â 
Oh she definitely deserved the name-calling. I just think it's hard to argue that Jaime was the victim in that scene, which is why you'll be hard-pressed to find outrage against Cersei. It's a very dark, complex moment for Jaime, but it's still rape (personally, I'm now in the minority that's arguing it's rape in the book as well). Though Cersei is certainly "hateful," that was not remotely a reasonable reaction. Of course it was also fueled by self-hate, which makes it interesting, and much much darker than in the book (where it was more habit and lust).
4934	Hoo	2014-04-21	Now I get where this is coming from. Â It's a rape in a church on Easter Sunday during primetime.
4935	allie4645	2014-04-21	What troubled me about this scene is that it calls into question their entire relationship. From the sho as a whole and not just this scene, it seems like Jaime is the instigator of all their sexual encounters. In every one of these scenes, he is physically dominating and forceful. It stops being a relationship of equals in which Cersei manipulates him and becomes a relationship that a brother forced upon his sister. It's a complete change in characters and entirely changes development.
4936	The Reckoner	2014-04-21	Jaime sounded pretty ticked in his covo with Cersei where he said "I murdered people to be with you." Sounds like this was an issue of having power over Cersei. Not an excuse, just a look at the psychology underlying the scene. So yes, shock value and nothing more.
4937	flamingothegreen	2014-04-21	First, for the ones comparing the scene to the books: Cersei said "no" in both versions. If no = rape, then she was raped in the book as well. Quite frankly, if you say no to sex and it is forced upon you, it is rape, even if you might "consent" mid-way. Even if Cersei acts and says things suggesting she enjoys it in the book, it's after she says "no" a few times. 
Â 
Now, if we say that it wasn't rape in the books, but it was in the show, then there are flaws in that as well. I've only watched the scene once as of now, so this will be mostly by memory.
Â 
Book scene:
Jamie forces himself onto Cersei
Cersei says no
Jaime continues, Cersei starts to submit herself
Cersei still says no and is trying her best to resist him
Cersei "consents" and wants him to continue
Cersei afterwards still thinks it's a mistake
Â 
Show scene:
Jaime forces himself onto Cersei
Cersei says no
Jaime continues, Cersei starts to submit herself (visibly grabbing and kissing him back)
Cersei keeps resisting
Cersei "consents" physically, but not vocally (she even grabs hold to something instead of continuing to physically fight back)
Â 
"Consents" is ambiguous in both scenes since we don't really get to see her POV for this. If the book scene doesn't equal rape, then why does the show scene? Because Jaime says, "I don't care?" He didn't seem to care in the book either when his sister was begging him not to do it. 
Â 
Rape or not, in reality both scenes are similar enough. The scene in the show did seem a tad more "rapey" but that's because itÂ is rape and we're actually given the visuals, which just show how forceful it most likely would have been. 
Â 
Concerning the effect on Jaime's character - well, I like Jaime. He's an interesting character. His moral values are questionable. Raping Cersei is a reminder that Jaime isn't as good as we start thinking he is. Everyone I know who watches the show hated Jaime from the first episode. At the end of season three, they all loved him. To me, it shows that Jaime is struggling with many personal conflicts - so many that he would go as far to rape the person he cherishes most. I think it shows that their relationship has changed to a certain degree as well - Cersei, in the show, has already denied him for quite some time, and as we saw from episode one, all the other characters are on his ass too. He seems to be clinging to what little he has left (lost his hand, pride, is being told he can't be in the Kingsguard, Cersei is being a cunt to him...etc) and forcing himself because of it.
Â 
The circumstances in the show are different too since Jaime has been denied for so long, but in the book he has only just returned. Timing could drastically change things. o:
Â 
Again though, I do need to rewatch the scene to analyze it better, but I don't think it's as bad as everyone is saying. o; There are worse things they could have done with his character.

Â 
What is funny is that actually to one friend of mine, Cersei didn't come of much better as she is trying to use sex to manipulate Jaime into killing their brother.
For him the overall message of the scene was basically that they both try to take advantage of each other through sex. Which I didn't really see that way (I think Cersei came out to good actually) but it was an interesting thought.
4939	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	I'll just wait till the end of the season to judge completely, but, IMO, it's going to be hard for them to get Jaime again in the path of redemption. Also, after seeing that they wanted to make this consensual, and how they've failed, they probably don't have any explanation for it. The previous of the ep. 4 seems bad too.

Why are we comparing Jaime's relationship with Cersei when they are supposedly "in love", fucking every day to the present where Cersei seems disgusted by him and Jaime is being treated like shit by everyone around him? Again the situation post capture is significantly different than pre capture, so much so that it makes the comparisons moot. I feel "sept scene" was an act of desperation for Jaime, who is desperately trying to go back to the way things were; he is trying to make Cersei love him again. It's a horrible decision informed by vulnerability and weakness. Â
4941	King Belushi	2014-04-21	After the show last night, I knew I would come here to find people fretting over this discussion.
In my view, the show is doing right to change the arcs of the book, not only because it is a different medium, but also as a source of entertainment for all the book readers out there who remain constantly surprised by the show's take on their familiar interpretations.Â 
Â 
If TV Jaime is a rapist, it is a result of their previous whitewashing, as to balance out the viewers vision on the character. And so that goes for all the established characters in the series, who are living out different experiences than those witnessed by us book readers. Of course we cannot expect D&D's interpretations of an event or character to be always in line with our own, but we can be certain they are trying their best.
Â 
I hold hope they will use this change as the catalyst for Jaime's departure of King's Landing, for we do not have ways to reach an insight on Jaime's head on TV, therefore exaggerating his thoughts through actions.

I don't know if it's going to be that hard.
Â 
One change from the books that I do think is an improvement (or so I think it will be) is his standing with Tyrion during the trial. One of the things that always bothered me in the books was that he didn't go to see his brother when he was in prison. Just watched from teh back of the court. Seemed....off.
Â 
By the looks of the promo, Bronn is giving him a talking to as well about standing for Tyrion (on, the irony!).
Â 
By the end of the season he, I hope, will be back on his redemption track.

Â 
Complain about the rape if you want, but don't complain that it wasÂ thatÂ different in the books. Rape is weaved with consensual sex in both cases.

Â 
It'll still work out when Cersei becomes more awful and evil and he saves Tyrion, but it certainly doesn't help at all when he does something that he's supposed to stand against. I mean, it was partly standing against that sort of thing that lost him his right hand in the first place.

QFT! I have no idea what causes some book readers to retroactively/actively whitewash some characters so intensely. (Jaime, Drogo, and Stannis being the most obvious examples)Â

I think that is actually the dynamic in the books somewhat, just easier to show there.
She wants him in the first place because he is her warrior half. She sees him as an extension of herself, but the part of her capable of physical violence. Her manipulations show precisely the LIMITS of physical power. In spite of dominating her physically, she is and always was in charge, and he was fully under her control. But that is starting to slip. He refuses to kill Tyrion. He will be refusing more and more of her requests now. It was a rape that was part of the process of breaking free.
The books can simply explore her and his thoughts more, so they don't need to show it via a rape.

I'm not a Jaime fanboy, but I think there is a redemption arc in the books. To me personally, Jaime is clearly using the negative reputation he gained from King-slaying in his POV chapters cleaning up the Riverlands.

One thing is hitting a guy. Another guy throwing a baby. He was just using his reputation to threaten Edmure, and, of course as Jaime knew, Edmure agreed. And even when Edmure let Blackfish to escape, did you see Jaime fulfilling his threat?

Concerning the effect on Jaime's character - well, I like Jaime. He's an interesting character. His moral values are questionable. Raping Cersei is a reminder that Jaime isn't as good as we start thinking he is. Everyone I know who watches the show hated Jaime from the first episode. At the end of season three, they all loved him. To me, it shows that Jaime is struggling with many personal conflicts - so many that he would go as far to rape the person he cherishes most. I think it shows that their relationship has changed to a certain degree as well - Cersei, in the show, has already denied him for quite some time, and as we saw from episode one, all the other characters are on his ass too. He seems to be clinging to what little he has left (lost his hand, pride, is being told he can't be in the Kingsguard, Cersei is being a cunt to him...etc) and forcing himself because of it.
Â 
The circumstances in the show are different too since Jaime has been denied for so long, but in the book he has only just returned. Timing could drastically change things. o:
Â 
Again though, I do need to rewatch the scene to analyze it better, but I don't think it's as bad as everyone is saying. o; There are worse things they could have done with his character.

You're quoting out of context.
4956	Titan	2014-04-21	The redemption of Jaime Lannister is about as big a myth as anything found on this forum.Â  I eagerly await the direct adaption of when he tells Edmure Tully that he plans on catapulting his newborn child into the walls of Riverrun.


Â 


This is a valid tactics in the medieval warfare


Â 
So is/was systematic rape in some cultures (and for the Dothraki in the novels) - Does this make it OK?

4957	Captain Victarion Greyjoy	2014-04-21	I am also curios how things will go between Cercei and Jaime in the next episodes. Rape a person like Cercei and she would do anything to destroy you but I think was not a 100% rape
4958	Faint	2014-04-21	One thing is hitting a guy. Another guy throwing a baby. He was just using his reputation to threaten Edmure, and, of course as Jaime knew, Edmure agreed. And even when Edmure let Blackfish to escape, did you see Jaime fulfilling his threat?


Â 
Why would he? He had already gained Riverrun.
4959	Ran	2014-04-21	GRRM at "Not a Blog" addresses it, here. Takeaways: no, he doesn't have script approval; he doesn't recall if it was ever discussed; he's unequivocal that there's no rape in his version in the book, it's two long-parted lovers hungry from one another held back only by the risk of being caught; he suggests that the different timeline in the show leads to a different approach to doing it.

Â 
Yeah I always saw this as contrasting with Tywin. The Tullys are still a rebellious house at this point; Tywin would have catapulted the baby with no fucks given. Jaime is given the chance to act similarly, but shows clemency. In fact, he's thinking about keeping his oath to Catelyn during the entire Riverrun affair.
Â 
Sadly, by trying to be honorable here, he might end up causing catastrophe for his family elsewhere...which puts him exactly in Ned Stark's shoes.Â
4961	MsLibby	2014-04-21	Other than the age of the child Jaime threatened, how is that different from Ned taking Theon hostage and threatening to kill him if his father tries anything? Theon would have been not much more than a child himself.

Â 
And he had alredy lost Blackfish because of Edmure. Even Edmure himself knew he was at danger doing what he did.
Â 
But the thing is, Jaime would have never thrown the baby, because he knew his reputation was enough to get Riverrun

Well, everyone is free to make their own assumptions, but I think I'll stick with not trusting the guy who knows all about flinging innocent children into the air.
4966	Prince_Snow	2014-04-21	I apologize to be so serious about that question but just to be sur everyone understand what is the definition of rape :
Â 
Rape and/or sexual assault is forced, manipulated, or coerced sexual contact by a stranger, friend or acquaintance.Â  It is an act of aggression and power combined with some form of sex.Â  A person is forced into sexual contact through verbal coercion, threats, physical restraint, and/or physical violence.Â  Consent is not given.
Â 
If you have these 3 elements you are raped (and if you do these you are a rapist) :
Â 
Penetration of ANY orifice by ANY object,
Force or threat of force, or
Sexual contact against the will of the victim.
And if it is someone you know like a friend, your doctor, a family member...etc it's called â<U+0080><U+009C>acquaintance rapeâ<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
There is no 51% rape, 20% there is rape or no rape and you better know that guys, i've heard a lot of stories in parties that ended in jail for years...so please be aware and careful.
Â 
So by definition Jaimie has raped Cersei, it's a fact.
4967	Ingelheim	2014-04-21	Â 
Where exactly? I seem to read his explanation extremly different then. 


Â 
"Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her."
Â 
"that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline."
Â 
He's clearly saying that what happened in the books was different than the TV version. So, if you think the TV Version was rape, which it is, then the book version IS NOT RAPE. Said by Martin himself.

4969	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-21	Heres what NCW had to say on the subject:

Â 
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>It was tough to shoot, as well,â<U+0080><U+009D> says Coster-Waldau. â<U+0080><U+009C>There is significance in that scene, and it comes straight from the booksâ<U+0080><U+0094>itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s George R.R. Martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mind at play. It took me awhile to wrap my head around it, because I think that, for some people, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just going to look like rape. The intention is that itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not just that; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s about two people whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve had this connection for so many years, and much of it is physical, and much of it has had to be kept secret, and this is almost the last thing left now. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s him trying to force her back and make him whole again because of his stupid hand.â<U+0080><U+009D>
So is it rape?
â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes, and no,â<U+0080><U+009D> says Coster-Waldau. â<U+0080><U+009C>There are moments where she gives in, and moments where she pushes him away. But itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not pretty.â<U+0080><U+009D>

"Also, I was writing the scene from Jaime's POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You don't know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing."
Â 
Which to me says: The sort of violence that comes across in the books by being inside Jaimes thought has to be translated onto the screen, otherwise the whole anger and desperation in Jaimes actions would probably not have come across on screen.

Â 
Â 
Â 
"Â I think the "butterfly effect" that I have spoken of so often was at work here. In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffrey's death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself, that she has lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before her. Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her.Â 
The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and he and Cersei have been in each other's company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why Dan & David played the sept out differently. But that's just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.Â Also, I was writing the scene from Jaime's POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You don't know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing.Â If the show had retained some of Cersei's dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression -- but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline.That's really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing... but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.

4975	MoA«t	2014-04-21	The thing is, although Cersei does say stop a lot in this scene, she was still kissing him back so I don't see a problem with it personally. It just seemed like rough[er] sex like it was in the books...


I agree with this. She kisses him back, she's grabbing his clothing and pulling him towards her, not pushing him away.

They probably will, but that will only encourage more blatant stupidity like turning a consensual sexual encounter into a rape.

I don't know yet what my friends think about it, they haven't read the books, so that will be interesting. I mean, flinging a child from a window is hard to redeem, but his journey with Brienne seemed to do the job quite well. But then Jaime killed his cousin already, and he raped Cersei next to their dead son's body. I mean. How are they ever going to redeem this?

We'll have to see next week, the preview already shows there will be a scene between them. About Sansa, or something, but that won't be the most important thing of course.

It is what it is. I dont think its character assassination cuz Jaime's still got a very long way to go in the books. That is in terms of being a pretty stand-up guy.

Yes, she wonders if Jaime would give her Sansa's head if he found her in the capital, but, nah. I mean, Brienne and he already had that scene where they see Sansa, where Brienne reminds him of his promise to Catelyn, and where Brienne urges him to "save" her somehow (I don't know the particulars anymore, have to look it up), so I think Jaime will come up with it himself, rather than wanting to find Sansa for Cersei.

I don't blame the blocking, per se, because as I note in our review the camera is deliberately eliding certain things, leaving deliberate ambiguity (so for example, the camera pans down an instant after she's grabbing Jaime's head in her hands and pushing her lips against him).

Cersei physically gives her consent in the show. If you can't look into the scene with an open mind and in enough detail, I would advise you at least try to.

He's already realized this in the show. Â I suggest if you think we're going to see some soul searching segment where Jamie reflects on how his rape of Cersei was the end of his past life and he's got to change and be better, you're mistaken. Â We likely will not see any mention of the event again by either of the two characters.


Â 
No explicit mention perhaps, but there have to be repercussions from it, otherwise what was the point?Â 
Â 
At this point I prefer to give the show runners (that the scene read like outright rape on the page lays the blame squarely on the writers) the benefit of the doubt by believing they notched up the ambiguity of the scene cause they're going somewhere with it. Otherwise I think I might just have to hate them a little for pandering to the misogynist elements in the show's viewership. Â

I didn't see any "they are both hungry for each other" in the show and I'm not aware of rape victims being hungry for sex with their rapist.


Â 
And that's exactly what GRRM is saying. In this scene Cersei is more uncomfortable and less "hungry" because it happens at a diffrent point in the story, not when they meet again for the first time and she is torn between "this is not right" and "he is finally back". But with Jaime being back for a while the "this is not right" just plays in to a bigger account, because the same sort of hunger doesn't make much sense in the same way.

5004	Ran	2014-04-21	I've heard from someone with the broadcast script, which appears derived from the shooting script. First kiss is described as "they kiss". Then when he grabs her after the hateful woman line, it's "Jaime kisses". And then after the fabric ripping as they're liding down to their knees, where she grabs his head, it's again "they kiss".So it seems to indicate an attempt at directing a give-and-take scene in which consent is being given, then withheld, then given -- it's a back and forth, basically. Which is pretty much how Jaime and Cersei do things in the novels -- I said there were two scenes where Cersei starts off protesting, but in fact there's three.So the real issue in the end is the fact that words have much more impact than visuals, especially visuals depicted in too obscrued a fashion, but they could have addressed that with finding some way of giving some words to match the fact that there was consent in the end, even if it was mixed in with contradictory stuff.This'll be a learning lesson for D&D, I'm sure.

5006	Sasha Steelsong	2014-04-21	I really hated how they portrayed Jaime in this episode. Â They made that sept scene suggestive of being something less than consensual.


Suggestive nothing, it was flat-out rape and Cersei was objecting till the end. Â None of the acceptance that was in the books (i.e telling Jaime he was home once he was inside her) to make it consensual, particularly since they've already had her flat out reject him since the brought him home earlier than he should have been. Â I hate how they departed from the books on this one, it does neither character any good.Â
5007	Lady Sansa Stark	2014-04-21	Exactly. As I said at the start of the thread, this is just making a big deal out of nothing imo.


Well, the fact that a lot of showviewers are calling it rape, indicates at least that the scene didn't play out the way it should have. Contradicting statements about the scene also don't help much. I'm still ambiguous about the scene though, haven't made up my mind yet.
5008	Sun	2014-04-21	And Alex Graves again, much more detailed, here. He notes that certain actions at the very end were intended to make some things clearer: that she was locking her legs around him, that she was grabbing at the cloth out of passion rather than fear or digust or what have you.
The problem really seems to come down to the voices. You hear one thing, you _maybe_ so another, it's hard to interpret. It's a problem with how the editing was done. I don't blame the blocking, per se, because as I note in our review the camera is deliberately eliding certain things, leaving deliberate ambiguity (so for example, the camera pans down an instant after she's grabbing Jaime's head in her hands and pushing her lips against him).


Â 
I disagree. The blocking and direction of the scene are horrendous, there's really no defending Graves here. If the director intends for the audience to see something and then directs and shoots the scene in a way that leaves the audience seeing something completely different, he has failed.Â 
Â 
But even from a purely cinematic point of view, regardless of the substance of the scene, the blocking and editing of that scene were badly done.Â
5009	Rapsie	2014-04-21	I don't know what they (the producers / director) were thinking. Do they not have a test audience for episodes? It is tricky to see it as anything but rape.Â

Â 
Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bizarre, and I highlighted that in how I shot it. A funny behind-the-scenes joke was every time we shot a take, and Lena and Nikolaj drop beneath the table, Jack Gleason would sit up and look down to try and see what was going on. He really did that? Yeah, he did! It was hilarious. He would take the rocks off of his eyes and lean over to take a look. He was so funny.

Mmmm. Good point.
Â 
Look, i cant speak for everyone, guys, but like im not gonna deny that its rapey. I just personally do not think its destroys any characterization. The timeline is wonkier in the show and i think its probably foreshadowing further enmity between Cersei and Jaime.Â
5011	nara	2014-04-21	I actually somewhat question the assumption that Jaime would never rape Cersei.Â  It wouldn't shock me if he attempted to rape his sister at the moment.Â  He is two dead children from choking her to death, after all.


Â 
Now this is interesting.Â  Since we know that D&D know how the series ends, perhaps their decision to make this more rapey/violent than the books (i.e, no "put it in me, brother") is foreshadowing 
	Spoiler Jaime's valonquar future...

Â 
Also, judging by the number of times it's been mentioned ironically in this thread, perhaps "it was consensual in the end" is the new "She's been f-ing Lancel, Kettleblack and Moon Boy, for all I know."

The real disturbing thing is accusing posters of being pro-rape just because they are trying to interpret the scene and not trying defend Jaime's actions.Â 
I doubt anyone is dumb enough to defend what Jaime has done.Â 
What Jaime did was obviously wrong. And I'm sure most posters were just giving the writers the benefit of the doubt by over-analyzing the scene to see to what extent Cersei was giving in.Â 
As you can see...this is merely just people trying to link the book with the show. But as George RR Martin has said... the circumstances in the book and show were different.Â

Ask the director. Â He says in his interview that it wasn't a rape. Â I say that makes him a bad director for thinking viewers can see barely perceptible movements....but to call people "pro rape" who apparently saw what the director wanted them to see is unfair.

Jaime is angry in that scene and those like me who are trying to make sense of this scene in the show are simply pointing that out. Someone on another forum came dangerously close toÂ accusing me of defending rape.

Thanks for sharing.Â  I wonder if there will be more of statement from D&D.Â 
Â 
Recently on the Good Wife, a major character was killed.Â  It provoked such an outrage on social media that the creators wrote a long statement on why they chose that approach.Â  Additionally, there has been an even stronger backlash against the finale of How I Met Your Mother, to the point that apparently they've decided to include an alternate ending on the DVD set.Â 
Â 
Not sure if the outrage here is to the same level as either example, but I'm curious if you know how they will be addressing it.Â  It sounds like some of the statements we've heard so far were from the before the fans truly voiced their opinions.

Â 
Thank you, Ran... I started questioning my sanity over this...
Â 
But, this is a great opportunity to discuss another matter. As Ran stated, and as GRRM has been telling us time after time, GoT TV show is not his work. It is based on the series of novels he wrote, but at the end he is not in charge or the part of general creative process. This being said, the backlash for this scene, and many others, is exclusively on those who wrote the scene the way it is written. The same can be said for numerous deviations made by show producers. Everything that is in TV show is on them, not GRRM. So, let we go back to what we originally thought (and were right) about the scene. It was never rape and it was never intended to be one.

Â 
And then she grabs his clothing, pulls him towards her, and kisses him back.... that's how.
Â 
Seriously, think about what you know about Cersei, then imagine any other man in Westeros attempting to rape her. How well do you think that would work out if it was one-on-one? You think in any way that rape would be successful if he didn't have a weapon at her throat, or one of her children's throats?
Â 
A small suggestion for all those who see this as rape: Watch the scene again on MUTE, (not from a book-reader standpoint who knows every word of dialog and is expecting those exact words, in their exact order to be spoken - or you will have intense hate in your heart), don't look away even if you find it hard to watch (since you obviously have a prejudicial opinion of the scene at this point.) Try to watch it with an open mind. And watch CERSEI. She's not fighting him off like Cersei would fight a man she didn't want to have sex with.
Â 
Just because she doesn't have Cersei's words from the book verbally indicating consent, doesn't mean it was rape.
Â 
It's like everyone jumped to the rape conclusion, and looked away from their TV screens in horror due to their mind-leap of what they think the scene had turned into, and didn't see what actually happened.

Really? I never got that. Yes I was disappointed they didn't film Dany and Drogo's amazing wedding night as it was written, ("No?" Yes!"), but I understood why they did it the way they did because it would have taken a lot longer to film it, and that's time they didn't have, and it also gave Dany & Drogo's relationship a much better and more dramatic arc for TV.Â

No, it's unfortunate you fail to see how a misogynist society can be depicted in a lot of ways, and this show chooses again and again to go the frat boy route.
Â 
(Also, Caps Lock fail - penalty points for you.)


Â 
Of course a "misogynist society can be depicted in a lot of ways." Â The same statement can be made out any "type of society". Â That goes without saying.
Â 
Do D&D have to show as much sexual assault as they do?
Â 
Of course they do not.
Â 
However, it is a great error to not make the distinction between "the writers are depicting a misogynist society" and "the writers are misogynist".
Â 
A great and grievous error.
5059	gash	2014-04-21	Â 
I do, too.Â  Afterall, Jaime was begging Edmure to live, to live for himself, his little Frey wife, and his unborn child.Â 


Â 
like every other character in the books jamie's "road to redemption" is not black and white. and people aren't comfortable when there are shades of grey. they want him to be either fully bad or fully redeemed. jamie is not bad or good. he is just a man. you get the same thing on here about tyrion and drogo in the books. people's black and white moral code will not allow themselves to see tyrion/drogo being capable of good. they are cartoon "baddys" in some people's eyes, because that's easier to accept.

5060	Impish	2014-04-21	From the book (emphasis mine):
Â 

There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her, only hunger. Her mouth opened for her tongue. "No," she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck, "not here. The septons..."
Â 
"The Others can take the septons." He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Mother's altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath. She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of the gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. Â One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes. When he tore them away, he saw her moon's blood was on her, but it made no difference.
Â 
[Cersei gets into it now, "Quickly, do me now...", admittedly more than the show portrays]
Â 
"This was folly." Cersei pulled her gown straight.

Â 
Now I don't know about you guys, but these passages show Cersei physically resisting, extensively verbally protesting (including afterwards!), and depict Jaime literally forcing her legs apart and tearing her underwear off.
Â 
She does give into him eventually (AFTER he's already forced himself on her...), but it's pretty damned rapey at first in the books too.

Yes, this is one of the things that pisses me off the most.
5063	Faint	2014-04-21	GRRM at "Not a Blog" addresses it, here. Takeaways: no, he doesn't have script approval; he doesn't recall if it was ever discussed; he's unequivocal that there's no rape in his version in the book, it's two long-parted lovers hungry from one another held back only by the risk of being caught; he suggests that the different timeline in the show leads to a different approach to doing it.


Â 
Admittedly amused that we cannot even reach agreement over Martin's take on the scene if what I have been reading is anything to go by.
Â 
New York Magazine's take:
Â 
[Update: George R.R. Martin has now weighed in about the debate on his personal blog. Essentially, he says that itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s unclear in the book scene whether Jaime rapes Cersei or not, as the scene is told from Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s point of view, and is therefore only one side of the story; he also says that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s unsure what Benioff and Weissâ<U+0080><U+0099>s intentions might have been in their version, as he never discussed it with them.]
5064	Hagen of Tronje	2014-04-21	The book scene is basically a rape scene which turns into consensual sex. And I've always thought that this is rather distasteful, even under these circumstances (Cersei is devastated, Jaime appears out of nowwhere after a long time etc.). Jaime acts as vile in the show as he does in the books (although, when you look at what he's been through and how he was welcomed in KL by his sister, you understand why he turns violent). He would't have stopped in the books if Cersei had refused him from the beginning till the end.
Â 
Cersei's reaction is different. And, dare I say:Â  It's much more realistic and less awkward now. A woman who consents to violent sex in the middle of the actÂ  right next to the body of her murdered child after she initially refused?

5065	pantouflas	2014-04-21	Hmm so maybe this is the ultimate test: 
Say you were part of a jury, Jaime is prosecuted for rape, none of them comes to testify, and you see 'the scene' as CCTV footage. Guilty or not guilty? 
I would vote for guilty I think...

Â 
It was definitely rapey, but GoT is a show, not some sort of "The More You Know" public service announcement.
5067	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-21	Come now, this is A Song of Ice and Fire.Â  If this forum has proved anything, it's that having a sense of humor and wit will cause the vast majority of readers to forgive child murder, rape, you name it.
Â 
Look at Stannis Baratheon.Â  The man only has deadpan humor going for him but that seems to be enough for most to wash away the sins of fratricide.


Some people whitewash the character, there's no doubts there. I still think critiques of the adaptation are merited though. He's had his best qualities, including the deadpan humor, stripped and replaced with fanaticism. He's got no agency, nor that iron will we spend three whole books hearing characters (even those who hate him) going on and on about. To be frank with you, while I like Jaime, him commiting this heinous act isn't as big of a jump, (considering his past actions with Bran) as the villanous jumps they've made with Stannis. I will say that this arc does color his "redemption" arc very differently though. He ends up blaming Cercei for being that obstacle which prevents him from being the chivalrous knight that deep down he wants to be, and when he finally abandons her later in the series that arc has the potential to be interpreted as victim blaming, seeing as we've just watched him rape her.

5070	Braavos_Blade	2014-04-21	Really? I never got that. Yes I was disappointed they didn't film Dany and Drogo's amazing wedding night as it was written, ("No?" Yes!"), but I understood why they did it the way they did because it would have taken a lot longer to film it, and that's time they didn't have, and it also gave Dany & Drogo's relationship a much better and more dramatic arc for TV.Â 
Â 
But I never once read where Drogo was a rapist. I'd love for someone to point that passage out to me, since I've clearly missed it.


Â 
I'd imagine the "Drogo is a rapist in the novels" stance has far less to do with anything we saw between him and Dany, and far more to do with the fact that heÂ #1) ran with a society where post-victory rape was definitely the norm andÂ #2) had a whoooooole lot of bells in his braid.

So, you (and a lot of people) missed where she grabbed his sleeve, pulled him towards her, and kissed him back, and was not pushing him away at all.

5073	The God of Death	2014-04-21	I understand how it seems like much more of a rape compared to the books.
Â 
But I think it's clear that both the books and the show had the sameÂ intentionÂ - to start out with Jaime forcefully instigating sex with Cersei, and then for Cersei to be accepting of it in the end.
Â 
In the book, this is made far more clear.
Â 
In the show, mistakes were made with how the scene was depicted... they made Cersei's acceptance too subtle for most of the audience, so it plays as rape.
Â 
I really think we should all just accept what the intention of the scene was... We should all accept that there was somewhat of a failure of execution in the direction of a scene to make itÂ clear that it became consensual.
Â 
Aren't those things we can all agree on? Â If so, I don't even know what we're supposed to be arguing about.

Â 
Really? I always have the feeling most of my bookreader friends but especially Unsullied can't see Tyrion ever doing anything really "bad". It's all sort of bad, but actually with a good reason so actually good in the end.
To the grey thing I agree. I don't feel the scene was as "black" as some people see it, while the book scene was not as "white", making it overall not very much out of character (at least in regards to Jaime)

He forced sex on Cersei and it made him look bad, so what? What is the problem? That they are showing Jaimie as a bad character? So what? Book is the book and the show is the show. People (normal people who dont analyse every second of every episode) will quickly forget about that scene and move on.

Thank you.Â  I won't swear what Jaime would or wouldn't do if Edmure hadn't agreed to his offer, but it does seem clear that Jaime really did want to come to terms with Edmure that would allow Jaime to keep his word to Cat and let Edmure and family actually LIVE, LOLÂ  Sometimes, I think, some just run rampant with character biases, both pro and con biases.Â

I somehow just fail to see, what changes about Jaime's behaviour in the whole scene when there is the yes it the end.

Â 
I don't think he ever intended for Jaime to come off looking well, but in reading the New York Magazine interview it seems he wanted to create a situation in which Cersei was reluctant to have sex with Jaime because of the moment and location (much as in the books) but then gave way to passion halfway through.Â  As evidence by this thread, and all related commentary all over the internet, that message never came across.Â 
Â 
Speaking personally, I also didn't interpret the scene the way he wanted me to.Â  If he was really going for that, then he should have lingered on the scene to demonstrate more active movement on Lena's part.

Gosh.I mean, they have to ignore this:Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her.and this:If the show had retained some of Cersei's dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression -- but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead.to then cherry pick this:Also, I was writing the scene from Jaime's POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You don't know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing.And act as if it's divorced from everything else and can be interpreted how they want.

5093	Faint	2014-04-21	I don't know how viewers will feel about it, but my own guess is that Cersei will try seducing Jaime in the next episode in a bid to have him bring her Sansa's head and the attempt will fail.Â  It will be much like Jaime's last chapter in A Storm of Swords, only in that chapter Cersei was asking him to kill Tyrion, much as she was in this episode.Â  Although, now that I think about it, there is no reason why she cannot request that again as well.

5097	Le Cygne	2014-04-21	I think they'll pretend it never happened, going by the Alton thing (until the ghastly I murdered people to be with you line). The audience won't be able to forget so easily. Brienne is going to look foolish, she thinks he's not the man he was, and he's actually no better than before.They always seem to come back to the broad plot points, although the characters are very different. Which is the hardest part, why, if they are different, would they do the same things (end up in the same place)?I'd rather have an entirely different story but the same characterizations.

Â 
First of all, I typed that out manually, not cut n pasted. Pardon the hell out of me for saving myself some typing time.
Â 
Second of all, I summarized the part you claim is missing:Â [Cersei gets into it now, "Quickly, do me now...", admittedly more than the show portrays]

5102	fangirl000	2014-04-21	Seriously, think about what you know about Cersei, then imagine any other man in Westeros attempting to rape her. How well do you think that would work out if it was one-on-one? You think in any way that rape would be successful if he didn't have a weapon at her throat, or one of her children's throats?
Â 


Â 
Your logic here is basically "she didn't fight back so it wasn't rape." Â 
Â 


A small suggestion for all those who see this as rape: Watch the scene again on MUTE, (not from a book-reader standpoint who knows every word of dialog and is expecting those exact words, in their exact order to be spoken - or you will have intense hate in your heart), don't look away even if you find it hard to watch (since you obviously have a prejudicial opinion of the scene at this point.) Try to watch it with an open mind. And watch CERSEI. She's not fighting him off like Cersei would fight a man she didn't want to have sex with.
Â 
Just because she doesn't have Cersei's words from the book verbally indicating consent, doesn't mean it was rape.
Â 
It's like everyone jumped to the rape conclusion, and looked away from their TV screens in horror due to their mind-leap of what they think the scene had turned into, and didn't see what actually happened.


Â 
But Cersei's actions do NOT happen in isolation of the dialogue. Â Cersei repeatedly telling Jamie to stop what he is doing is something that actually happened. Â Jamie ignoring what Cersei told him is something that actually happened. Â Jamie flat out stating that he didn't CARE what Cersei wanted is something that actually happened. Â It is completely reasonable to infer that Cersei is being taken against her will. Â  I admit, there was a moment in the middle, when Jamie had taken them both to their knees and Cersei seems to kiss Jamie back, when I thought the situation was going to pivot in the direction of the book; if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have given Jamie even that much benefit of the doubt. Â And the scene ends with Cersei still telling Jamie to stop, and Jamie still ignoring her. Â And, to my eyes, at that point she was trying to move away from Jamie while he did the deed. Â 
Â 
Frankly, if scene was supposed to read as "Cersei is reluctant at first but then consents," then the acting and the camera work completely failed to convey that message. Â How do I know? Â Because the vast majority of viewers are interpreting the scene as a rape.

Perhaps I assume way more people have had a lot more varied sex than they've actually have.


Â 
This has always been a problem with the HBO/D&D sycophants. They let everything on the show change their memories of how things happened in the books. Look at the posts in this thread. There are people literally directing disagreeing with GRRM. There are people just imagining things out of thin air to try to make the books and show consistent when they simply are not with the Jaime and Cersei sex/rape scene.
Â 
In the books Jaime and Cersei have consensual sex. The show's version is clearly rape. Or the show's writers and directors literally have NO clue how to portray rough/aggressive sex without it looking like a full on rape. If the intention of the HBO show was to not portray a rape, but just rough sex, then they did a horrifically bad job. The fact that GRRM had to even comment on it shows that they poorly executed this scene. This is nothing more than damage control over a poorly edited and planned scene.
Â 
But at least it is consistent with HBO's other changes. Drogo did rape Dany in the HBO version on her wedding night. When in the books he was purposefully gentle and slow. Seducing her. I guess they decided to amplify the drama of another sex scene by introducing rape again.
Â 
I'm still not sure what they were going for. Certainly not the reactions that fans are having now. But maybe the payoff by episode ten will be good. I doubt it because I don't have a lot of faith with these writers. But I'll wait until episode ten of this season to see if the rape scene has some sort of extended purpose.
5107	The God of Death	2014-04-21	Â 
Your logic here is basically "she didn't fight back so it wasn't rape." Â 
Â 
Â 
But Cersei's actions do NOT happen in isolation of the dialogue. Â Cersei repeatedly telling Jamie to stop what he is doing is something that actually happened. Â Jamie ignoring what Cersei told him is something that actually happened. Â Jamie flat out stating that he didn't CARE what Cersei wanted is something that actually happened. Â It is completely reasonable to infer that Cersei is being taken against her will. Â  I admit, there was a moment in the middle, when Jamie had taken them both to their knees and Cersei seems to kiss Jamie back, when I thought the situation was going to pivot in the direction of the book; if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have given Jamie even that much benefit of the doubt. Â And the scene ends with Cersei still telling Jamie to stop, and Jamie still ignoring her. Â And, to my eyes, at that point she was trying to move away from Jamie while he did the deed. Â 
Â 
Frankly, if scene was supposed to read as "Cersei is reluctant at first but then consents," then the acting and the camera work completely failed to convey that message. Â How do I know? Â Because the vast majority of viewers are interpreting the scene as a rape.


Â 
This is exactly it.
Â 
I don't understand why we can'tÂ all agree on this...
Â 
The showÂ intended to make the sex consensual by the end, but the execution in showing that was pure.
Â 
The execution is what is causing all this backlash.
Â 
It's different for show-only watchers. Â But as book readers, we should all just be able to agree that the execution of the scene was poor, and made it seem like non-consensual the whole way through even though this was not the intention.
5108	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-21	Im glad most of the people who watch the show don't overthink every freaking second of every freaking episode like you people do in here.


Â 
I'm not. Most casual viewers are (rightly) interpreting that scene as a straight attempt at rape, which apparently wasn't the director's intention in the first place.Â 
Â 
How is that a good thing?Â
5109	Le Cygne	2014-04-21	Dany and Drogo, she talks about it nicely here, and puts it in perspective:
Â 
Changing a scene from consensual sex to rape is not just a pedantic issue of accuracyâ<U+0080><U+0094>itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a problem with story. The Daenerys Targaryen who falls in love with a man who granted her respect when no one else would is different from the Daenerys Targaryen who fell in love with her rapist. It changes that relationship.
Â 
http://www.avclub.co...-thrones-203499
Â 
I hated the change in the show, and just ignored it, to get past it.Â  The show was enough like the books in season 1 that I could just imagine it had gone differently, although I think the books scene would have been really nice to see.Â 
Â 
GRRM talks about it here:
Â 
"What happens later in the books is Drogo and Dany ride out to to consummate their marriage... You have Dany and Drogo riding out, and they find this little secluded spot, there's a stream. And Drogo doesn't speak any English, so they're talking to each other, and she says is no the only word you know. And they undress, and there's a sex scene which was pretty sexy and fairly romantic."
Â 
http://www.ustream.t...corded/21681757
5110	The God of Death	2014-04-21	For what it's worth...
Â 
In the original script, the Dany & Drogo scene was written to play out as it did in the books.
Â 
However, in filming the pilot, Emilia Clarke and Jason Momoa could not get their heads around how Dany could go from where she is to start the episode to suddenly wanting Drogo so quickly. Â It felt unnatural to them as actors. Â So the script was re-written to delay Dany coming around to Drogo.

5111	ServantOnIce	2014-04-21	1. Drogo did not rape Dany on the show. I know that may go against many folks here but she knew it was her wedding night and what was expected of her. Just like Sansa and Tyrion when Sansa drunk wine and was getting ready to consummate her relationship with Lord Tyrion. Â Was Drogo rough? Yes, but that was his style that wasn't rape.
Â 
2. My Unsullied Co worker said to me, "What was up with Jaime raping Cersei?" Â  Folks see it as rape. Cersei kept saying no, no, no while on the ground. It reminded me of when Robert would do the same to Cersei in the books. Â 
Â 
Carry On. Â
5112	Lannes	2014-04-21	Way late to this party, but I'd like to thank D&D from all us book fans that have told the Unsullied that Jaime's arc of redemption is one of the more compelling arcs in the books....

Yeah, now the general public think we're full of shit, and find Cersei/Tywin more likeable.

Still not as bad as when I hyped my friends up for Stannis in S2.

You fail to see how it would be out of character for a man who committed incestÂ because he loved his sister, and threw a kid off a buildingÂ because he loved his sister, to then violently sexually assault her whilst yelling that he doesn't care?
Â 
OK.Â 


Â 
please tell me you're not trying to find excuses for him for child murder and incest.
5115	James Sucellus	2014-04-21	Â

Â 
They're not excuses, but his entire character motivations for ASOIAF, which should remain consistent and make sense, without him doing fucking dumb and out of character things like kinslaying and raping. I'd have been equally baffled if Tywin had raped Cersei, or if Joffrey had raped Podrick. A character being a 'baddie' (whatever), doesn't mean they can just do weird out of character shit.

It almost sounds as if you're saying that I'm saying D&D are showing too much violence?


Â 
How would you get that from my question: "You mean not nearly as much as in the books?"Â 
Â 
Perhaps I wasn't clear:Â Do you think there's more violence in the show than in the books?Â
5118	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-21	I think they'll pretend it never happened, going by the Alton thing (until the ghastly I murdered people to be with you line). The audience won't be able to forget so easily. Brienne is going to look foolish, she thinks he's not the man he was, and he's actually no better than before.
They always seem to come back to the broad plot points, although the characters are very different. Which is the hardest part, why, if they are different, would they do the same things (end up in the same place)?
I'd rather have an entirely different story but the same characterizations.


Â 
I do wish the scene had been done in a much more clear manner, but I suspect that D&D will expect the audience to grasp it when come next week Cersei will not act as if it was in any way a rape.Â  Cersei will move on to using the idea of sex with her to get her either Sansa or Tyrion's head, Tommen away from Tywin, something.Â  And, when the only thing Cersei has to say about the Sept (if she has anything to say at all, that is) is along the lines of.......they have to be more careful about what they do and where, D&D will just move on.Â  They had their shocking scene, and well, will not want it to really MEAN all that much in the long run.Â  Why they feel the need to tamper so much with material is beyond me.
Â 
The scene didn't look quite as bad on a rewatch, it was still........a difficult look for Cersei's pure acceptance.Â  Why they couldn't include some of the 'do me, Jaime, yes, like that" dialogue is unfathomable.Â  I rewatched to see if my first impression was correct, but honestly, my book knowledge did NOT help me see it as not 'rapey.'Â  And David Benioff with his:Â  Jaime forced himself comments only reinforced my rewatch conclusion.
Â 
Still, they will expect us and all viewers to just move along, they've had their shock for the week, I think.Â  I'm pretty easy going with book changes, but this episode is a real sticking point.Â  Being the easy going girl I am......I'll get over it, but D&D do not do much to help me with that.Â
5119	gash	2014-04-21	I'm pretty much ignoring all the nonsense about rape, but it doesn't matter if it's Westeros or New York City, rape is rape.Â

tyrion actually not having sex with sansa means rape did not in fact occur.

Â 
Then the "vast majority" are completely ignoring Cersei kissing Jamie, and pulling him towards her, and participating consensually in the scene, because they want to be outraged about rape. Yes, rape is enraging, no argument.Â 
Â 
It seems to me, that the "vast majority" are guilty of far greater character assassination on Cersei's part, than Jamie, since Cersei would indeed fight off any man she didn't want to have sex with, including Jamie - but she not only didn't, she actively pulled him towards her. But somehow that doesn't count just because she didn't verbally say, "yes"?Â

Â 
I think part of them resents that it's someone else's material that has made them so successful, and well, they won't admit much in the way of their mistakes with the material.Â  And, they do count on what I call Tv audience ADD, give us something big now and don't worry about the long term consequences.Â  Next week, next episode, it will be clear, or forgotten, and tv audiences with attention deficit disorder will move on.Â
5131	Zman1863	2014-04-21	Having watched the episode and the scene again, I can see that they were probably going for ambiguity and subtlety, but I think they botched the execution. The supposed subtlety of the scene simply does not come across for most viewers looking at it the first time.Â 
Â 
You have to watch quite closely to pick out the signs of Cersei being a more willing participant than her words indicate. They are there, but you almost have to go through it frame by frame like a JFK conspiracy theorist analyzing the Zapruder film. If you have to do that to try to match what is on screen with what the director says he was trying to convey, I think the director missed the mark.Â 
Â 
I also think Jaime's actions and motivations don't come through well. It has been suggested that Cersei stops the initial kiss to entice Jaime into agreeing to her proposition that Jaime kill Tyrion, and that Jaime percieves this and this motivates his "hateful woman" comment and the ensuing action. But I just don't see any sign of Cersei being conniving here. It looks more like she kisses Jaime in a moment of weakness and then pulls back knowing she has forgotten herself.Â

Â 
Â 
I don't think they need to admit anything was botched, because there are clearly people who didn't have a problem with it. Perhaps they overestimated the observational skills of many in their audience.
Â 
I also think a lot of people are looking at this scene through a 21st Century Social Filterâ<U+0084>c. A man should never ever force himself on a women in today's society, even if it turns out to please his partner (as Ros said, "There's a lid for every pot.") ASOIAF is not today, nor is it Earth. Â Please don't misunderstand me, force â<U+0089>  rape. They are two different things, and while force does turn into rape a lot, it doesn't always, as is apparently clearer for a lot of people in the book (reading it), and not so much visually on the show (watching it.)
Â 
But layering our modern social standards onto a story that isn't only not modern, but doesn't even take place in our world, does a giant disservice to the story.
5133	The God of Death	2014-04-21	Â 
Then why would you ask what you asked when I clearly didn't say that, and then avoid both my questions?
Â

Â 
This was my original quote...
Â 
---
Â 
"Of course a "misogynist society can be depicted in a lot of ways." Â The same statement can be made out any "type of society". Â That goes without saying.
Â 
Do D&D have to show as much sexual assault as they do?
Â 
Of course they do not.
Â 
However, it is a great error to not make the distinction between "the writers are depicting a misogynist society" and "the writers are misogynist".
Â 
A great and grievous error."
Â 
---
Â 
You then highlighted my statement "Do D&D have to show as much sexual assault as they do"... and you asked me if I think there is more violence on the show than there is in the books.
Â 
Clearly, you misunderstood what I was saying.
Â 
I was responding to a person who made the statement "There is more than one way to depict misogyny. Â D&D take the frat boy approach." Â This person was defending another commenter who said something along the lines of "The writers of this show are misogynists and they have disgraceful attitudes towards women". Â I was refuting them by saying there is a difference between writers being misogynist and writers depicting a misogynist society.
Â 
Does that clear things up, or do you still think I am criticizing D&D? Â (even though I am obviously defending them?)

5134	nara	2014-04-21	OK...I'm going to ask again. How can this be fixed?
Â 
Any suggestions?


Â 
Hastily filmed and added scene.Â  (Maybe it could replace one of the random brothel scenes.)
Â 
Jaime is walking out of the throne room.Â  Cersei comes out of the shadows and pulls him into a empty hallway
Â 
Cersei:Â  Jaime, we have to be more careful.Â  If I were to get with child, our father wouldn't think twice about sending me back to Casterly Rock...or worse.
Jaime:Â  Then I will kill him.
Cersei:Â  And become a kinslayer?Â  Don't be daft.Â  Lannisters are not kinslayers.
Jaime:Â  (embarrassed) I guess I didn't mention an incident in Riverrun...
Â 
He goes on to describe killing that distant relation while in captivity and Cersei is so turned on that they have CLEARLY CONSENSUAL sex.Â 
Â 
This would show that 1) Cersei did not see the episode as rape (even though it looked like it to us), 2) Cersei is no victim--she's crazy, and 3) Jaime would still kill people for her.

And I suppose Jaime knew this right from the start when he ripped her clothes off and spread her legs although she said no and started to hit him? But of course, someone as flawless as book Jaime would have stopped sooner or later before things get ugly.

Â 
lol, is this being directed at me?
Â 
I am among the people who don't think that Jaime taking Cersei by force in that moment would be totally out of character for him.
Â 
However, I believe the reality of what happened with that scene is that it was intended to play out as more consensual by the end, but it just didn't come across as intended.

Make the necessary changes, but keep the spirit of it in place. Borrow liberally from the books. You can tell that he really sweated over the writing of those scenes, to get them just right.

5138	allie4645	2014-04-21	I'm kind of disturbed by the number of posts that claim this wasn't a 100percent rape. Either consent is given or it isn't. Someone cannot be "kind of" raped. Please understand that rape is not an issue that can be interpreted as grey. It's black and white. She may not have given consent initially, but later did give consent. It that case it is not rape. She may have given consent initially, but later said no. That would be rape. In this scene she explicitly sexually denied Jaime, but he forced himself on her. In no way did she later give verbal consent. It can be interpreted that she gave physical consent, but since physical consent is up to the interpretation of the aggressor, the implications of her consent are moot. It can be therefore assumed that Jaime forced himself upon her when she was unwilling to have sex with him which resulted in rape. A 100percent rape. Because there is no other kind.

Â 
I don't think they need to admit anything was botched, because there are clearly people who didn't have a problem with it. Perhaps they overestimated the observational skills of many in their audience.
Â 
I also think a lot of people are looking at this scene through a 21st Century Social Filterâ<U+0084>c. A man should never ever force himself on a women in today's society, even if it turns out to please his partner (as Ros said, "There's a lid for every pot.") ASOIAF is not today, nor is it Earth. Â Please don't misunderstand me, force â<U+0089>  rape. They are two different things, and while force does turn into rape a lot, it doesn't always, as is apparently clearer for a lot of people in the book (reading it), and not so much visually on the show (watching it.)
Â 
But layering our modern social standards onto a story that isn't only not modern, but doesn't even take place in our world, does a giant disservice to the story.


Â 
Well said.
5140	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-21	This. What I would give to hear them admit that thy botched the scene. l

This. To anyone who's been asking how they can fix what happened, I think this is the best they could do.
5141	pantouflas	2014-04-21	There are a lot of people, even in this thread, who don't agree that "the show's version is clearly rape."
Gods, I've had makeup sex that was a whole lot worse than that, and certainly not "rape."

This was not makeup sex, it was breakup rape. See next week's trailer, and the fact they never have any more sex after that. 
Also, please stop having sex 'that is a whole lot worse than that', especially if the girl is crying and saying no...
5142	FalseKnight	2014-04-21	Â 
Â 
How about we quote the entire scene, and not cherrypick bits so we get a good idea of what actually happened;
Â 
Â 
Sorry, but I cannot see how this wasn't rape.
Â 
Cersei did not want to have sex. She said no, she pleaded to him not to. She attempted to resist him physically.
Â 
When that failed, she didn't consent to the sex, she tried to speed up the sex. She knew at that point she couldn't stop him, and she just wanted it to be over, and to minimise the risk of them being caught.
Â 
If you ever doubt that fact, look at what she says once it's over. "This was folly". She didn't want to have the sex, before or after it occured.
5143	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-21	I think it's intentional, I think they know by now that female fans like certain characters and pairings and the reasons why, and if they don't know, all they have to do is ask GRRM, he certainly knows.
I think when it comes to men and women and romance/sex, the closer they stay to the books, the better. Make the necessary changes, but keep the spirit of it in place. Borrow liberally from the books. You can tell that he really sweated over the writing of those scenes, to get them just right. There's a delicate balance, and like he says, the butterfly effect, it's felt throughout the story.
You can tell that it was important for Cersei to say yes, and for Dany to say yes, because he added it. It's not there by accident.

Â 
They've definately compromised the gift of a rapist's head to Pia.Â  That and Jaime thinking of his brother wondering whatever happened to giving women flowers.Â
5144	Chebyshov	2014-04-21	Having watched the episode and the scene again, I can see that they were probably going for ambiguity and subtlety, but I think they botched the execution. The supposed subtlety of the scene simply does not come across for most viewers looking at it the first time.Â 
Â 
You have to watch quite closely to pick out the signs of Cersei being a more willing participant than her words indicate. They are there, but you almost have to go through it frame by frame like a JFK conspiracy theorist analyzing the Zapruder film. If you have to do that to try to match what is on screen with what the director says he was trying to convey, I think the director missed the mark.Â 
Â 
I also think Jaime's actions and motivations don't come through well. It has been suggested that Cersei stops the initial kiss to entice Jaime into agreeing to her proposition that Jaime kill Tyrion, and that Jaime percieves this and this motivates his "hateful woman" comment and the ensuing action. But I just don't see any sign of Cersei being conniving here. It looks more like she kisses Jaime in a moment of weakness and then pulls back knowing she has forgotten herself.Â 


Â 
This perfectly sums up my feelings about it. I think it is a scene that will sit better in hindsight, but that is not a good quality for a scene to have.

Rape is ultimately about power and domination. While who wields power and who is dominant can be overt, at other times it can be more nuanced and ambiguous. Rape is thus NOT something that is necessarily black and white. Consent in the eye of modern Western law is a simple "Yes" or "No", but we are not using modern law here. Rape is a social category, with different ways in how it can be defined. The show (and the book) loves playing with that ambiguity and challenging false dicotomies.Â

Â 
After Jaime goes to his knees with Cersei, and after saying "stop it" a few times, she definitely kisses him and touches his face.Â  The next word she says is, "stop" but in a succumbing way.
Â 
I think the whole key to this scene is at the beginning when Cersei says, "Jaime, not here, please." She doesn't want sex "here," not I don't want sex with you.
Â 
The whole "it's not right" at the end isn't about not wanting sex, but not wanting to do it in a holy place with a dead son, and with the possibility of watchers nearby.Â  The last frame shows her holding tight to the burial blanket or tapestry or whatever, which indicates sexual pleasure.
Â 
So, I vote no rape, just inappropriate creepy sex.

5148	FalseKnight	2014-04-21	Cercei kept saying no but she obviously wanted it otherwise why was she kissing him back so much? This wasn't rape, it just shows what a weird relationship they have, and after it just suffered a huge throttle... they're both in a very unstable state, especially Cercei that's why she was saying no all the time but on the other hand seeking his affection and comfort.
I think people just saw it as rape because it wasn't so well directed, and it all happened too quickly...Â 


The victim blaming begins.

Rape and rough sex are not the same thing. In one case consent is not given and in the other it is. If someone says "no" and does not later retract his/her denial, then consent is explicitly not given, in which case it is rape. I don't see how that's ambiguous. You could argue that in this case it was a competition for dominance between the two, who obviously have a pretty complex relationship. However Cersei made it clear in the show that this was not a competition in which she was willing to participate, at least in this context and Jaime continued in his actions. That makes it rape. No ambiguity.

Â 
Her sexual pleasure was indicated by holding tight to the fabric. Â  I've seen this motiff in movies before, where during a sex scene, the camera pans to the female's hand that is holding tight to a blanket or something like that.
Â 
But anyway, I watched the scene enough to be conviced that Jaime wasn't raping her.Â  She definitely kisses him.
5153	Seneti	2014-04-21	Speaking as a woman who has escaped rape attempts twice and who has met other women who really were raped in RL, I must say this scene was pretty hard to watch. My initial thought was "yes, this is definitely rape". Then I read the director's comments and GRRM's comments (see here:Â http://grrm.livejour...30284#t19030284) and decided to re-watch. My interpretation of that scene thus stands as such:
Â 
1) It definitely looks a lot like rape.
2) There are some elements of consent in there, such as Cersei kissing Jaime back and fumbling at this clothes, but they are hidden by unfortunate camera angles and quick cutting.
3) This is one of those scenes that would have profited from showing the end of it / the immediate aftermath. Would Cersei have said "yes" eventually. Would she have slapped him? Accused him? Brushed it off as if nothing has happened?
4) It did remind me of their previous interactions in the first season (just before throwing Bran out the window and just after finding out that he would live).
Â 
So now I'm on the fence about this one. I think the crucial thing here will be the aftermath, as in how Cersei and Jaime interact next week:
Â 
1) Will she be angry with him?
2) How will she react to physical proximity? Shy away? Draw closer? Don't care?
3) Will Jaime show remorse / awareness that what he did was - at best at least in part - wrong?
Â 
Ultimately, what is rape and what is not is in the eye of the "victim". I'll be watching for Cersei's reactions (or lack thereof).
Â 
Â 
EDIT: Also, concerning what this means for Jaime's character: Even in the books, he always came of as impulsively, dominant, IMO. At least until Cersei shut him out completely at which point he realized that the love between the two of them had become a lie and he lost all interest in her. Interestingly enough, every time we hear Jaime's thoughts on a woman other than Cersei being raped, he seems thoroughly angry and disgusted, but as soon as it comes to him and Cersei, her blows are kisses. Â Double standard very much? Â So unless Cersei makes it clear next episode that she does see what happened in the sept as rape, I'm not gonna cry "character assassination".

5154	Joseph Nobles	2014-04-21	Consent to having sex with someone generally is not consent to have sex with someone any dang place ever. If she didn't consent to the time and the place, she didn't consent.
5155	Grayven	2014-04-21	If the intent was not to show a rape, the directors completely screwed that scene up. Â It doesn't matter what lines they give to Cersei next episode.. a huge percentage of the viewing audience saw forcible sex, and aren't talking about much else.
5156	Martin Lasarte	2014-04-21	Let's assume it was rape. Does it matter?
Don't get me wrong, rape is a hideous crime. But when it comes to evaluate Jaime as a character, does it really make a difference if he raped his sister or not? This is a guy who tried to murder a 10-year-old boy, impregnated his sister 3 times, murdered his king and countless (as he says himself) other people. The Jaime Lannister of the series strangled his own cousin Alton to death just to get out of a cage and stabbed Jory Cassel in the eye in the middle of a sword fight. Did we really need to see him rape Cersei to realize that this is not a good man?

5157	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-21	People aren't going to be analysing every detail of the scene so obviously it comes across as rape. The show does a good job at over-simplifying things and being less than subtle when needed e.g. "But you love him don't you" Cersei/Brienne scene.
Â 
I don't know why they would feel the need to have Cersei's consent being subtle? Bloody hell, she is anything but subtle when she submits in the books (gives Lysa a run for her money...just more quite about it).
Â 
It was a BIG mistake to have her carry on protesting and Jaime saying "I don't care." Viewers tend to focus on the words, not the subtle body language.
5158	William Campbell	2014-04-21	When I talked to my non-book reading friend, he thought the episode was great and didn't have a problem with the scene.Â  He just saw it as an example of their ongoing dysfunctional (and creepy) relationship.Â  So, so far, in my world, the non-internet world, the scene hasn't come off as a crime being commited against cersei.Â  I'm sure cersei will not either, unless the writers are going to throw a curve ball.

Okay, I have never read the books, this is just a prediction. Â The rumours of the incestuous relationship is public knowledge. Â What if Jaime makes her pregnant? Robert is dead, so being pregnant now would be pretty hard to explain.
Â 
Just an idea.
Â 
Â 
As far as the whole rape debate goes, she definitely wanted it. Â I got the impression that Cersei certainly wanted and liked what was happening, but she didn't feel right about it. Â She didn't think the time or place was right, but she still wanted it anyways. Â She only said "no" and pushed Jaime away to make her feel better about herself, but deep down, she knew she really did want it.
That's just the way I felt when watching the scene.
Â 
This does make me worry though,; Tyrion wanted Jaime to serve as a witness. Â What if Jaime has to end up deciding to be loyal to Cersei or Tyrion?

Â 
Pretty much my thoughts. First impression was "rape", but first impressions aren't always right.
Â 
If anything, the scene suffered from bad WRITING rather than directing. Try to watch it mute, shut off the initial prejudice and tell me if you see a rape footage.
Â 
Let's go furtherÂ  and try to honestly answer: would this footage fly as an *incontrovertible* piece of evidence for rape in a trial? I don't think so. The defense could argue several things.
Â 
EDIT: nice to see a person who has some actual experience with rape chime in. Now we only need an actual attorney or law student (Haven't seen anyone, among the hundreds of commenters of the episode, claim to be one in the 24 hours that have passed).

Did we really need to see him rape Cersei to realize that this is not a good man?


Â 
Yes, it does matter. He is not the same man he was when he tried to murder that boy and such. He went on a huge internal trip while traveling with Brienne. At this point in the books, he is a changed man, who's only ties to his old self are his feelings for Cersei, which are manifested at Joff's corpse in consensual sex. He doesn't do anything "wrong" there, he has sex with her cause he has such an internal turmoil at that time. In the show however, he rapes her, and as you say; looks like he's falling back into what he used to be.Â 
Jaime did a lot of things wrong, but he was becoming a better man. In the show imho they ruined this by having him actually "rape" Cersei.
Also, the fact that the last 2 appearances in the J-C-love-arc were the cold glances during the conversation with Brienne and Cersei rejecting Jaime don't help. Now it seems like Cersei kissed him in a moment of weakness and Jaime went to full out rape, having her repeating "no stop it" until the very end of the scene.
Â 
Ps: I watched it again with the GF tonight, and talked to 4 friends who also follow the show, a total of 5 Unsullied. Every single one of them thinks this was rape. If they'd go back and look for tiny hidden clues they might be a little confused at most, but for those that only watch the show, and not each episode 4-5 times like some of us, it's rapeÂ

Â 
Yes, so much yes. If you'd show this tape to anyone not familiar with GoT and ask them to describe what happened, they'd say rape. Over the course of the event Cersei tells him to stop over 10 times, he tells her he doesn't care about 3 times. She is pounding her fist into his chest and pushing him away as he enters her. I think there are conflicted feelings about this WHEN you know the background for the books. For anyone without that knowledge, I think it would be an easy case.

Â 
Let's just say we disagree on that one then... I, and I know a lot of people with me, believe that he has actually changed during the trip, not only distanced himself from Cersei. Old Jaime wouldn't have cared about keeping an oath to Catelyn. Old Jaime wouldn't have cared about saving Brienne. Old Jaime wouldn't even have started calling her by her name. Old Jaime imho was a completely different man

Â 
Her kissing him indicates that her words about stopping were pretense.Â  This is besides the fact that Jaime has only one hand and would have a near impossible time forcing himself on her if she didn't really want him. Was the situation inappropriate, yes, was it creepy, yes, was a crime commited, no. Like someone said eariler, ultimately it's about Cersei's feelings, and who knows Cersei well enough to know Cersei's feelings; her lover, best friend (only friend), and brother, jaime lannister.

Â 
I'll paraphrase myself: let's go find an actual attorney or law student and ask him. Your opinion is as good as mine.
5168	MoA«t	2014-04-21	This was my original quote...
Â 
---
Â "Of course a "misogynist society can be depicted in a lot of ways." Â The same statement can be made out any "type of society". Â That goes without saying.
Â Do D&D have to show as much sexual assault as they do?
Â Of course they do not.
Â However, it is a great error to not make the distinction between "the writers are depicting a misogynist society" and "the writers are misogynist".
Â A great and grievous error."
Â ---
Â 
You then highlighted my statement "Do D&D have to show as much sexual assault as they do"... and you asked me if I think there is more violence on the show than there is in the books.
Â 
Clearly, you misunderstood what I was saying.
Â 
I was responding to a person who made the statement "There is more than one way to depict misogyny. Â D&D take the frat boy approach." Â This person was defending another commenter who said something along the lines of "The writers of this show are misogynists and they have disgraceful attitudes towards women". Â I was refuting them by saying there is a difference between writers being misogynist and writers depicting a misogynist society.
Â 
Does that clear things up, or do you still think I am criticizing D&D? Â (even though I am obviously defending them?)

I didn't misunderstand what you said. I only asked you a question, in response to that sentence. And no where did I ever disagree with you. 
Overreact much?
5169	Fjordgazer	2014-04-21	One detail: Cersei clutches the blanket with her left hand. If she's being raped, why the hell wouldn't she try to use that hand to fight Jaime's maimed right hand? It does not compute.  It's already been mentioned the kissing back and other visual details. Again, the scene suffered from clumsy writing. Change at least some of the little "no's" for some little "yes" and you have pretty much a scene from ASOS finely adapted.

It does not compute.  It's already been mentioned the kissing back and other visual details. Again, the scene suffered from clumsy writing.

Â 
In the book she's practically begging him to fuck her, which is hardly what is happening here. I know what you mean, there are some little clues, but she DID try to push him away and such, so for people without the right background, it'll still be rape. Just go look at the "expectations"-thread and you'll see that all unsullied reactions to it are "shocked about jaime raping her". If you go look at online blogs that review the series, 90% of them are talking about rape.

Jaime has been trained in combat his entire life, Cersei was raised to be a queen and never lifted a hand. Honestly, even with one hand I'm pretty sure Jaime COULD have easily raped Cersei. I know that's not what happened, but it IS what it looked like to most people.
5171	MoA«t	2014-04-21	Watched the scene again.
Â 
After Jaime goes to his knees with Cersei, and after saying "stop it" a few times, she definitely kisses him and touches his face.Â  The next word she says is, "stop" but in a succumbing way.
Â 
I think the whole key to this scene is at the beginning when Cersei says, "Jaime, not here, please." She doesn't want sex "here," not I don't want sex with you.
Â 
The whole "it's not right" at the end isn't about not wanting sex, but not wanting to do it in a holy place with a dead son, and with the possibility of watchers nearby.Â  The last frame shows her holding tight to the burial blanket or tapestry or whatever, which indicates sexual pleasure.
Â 
So, I vote no rape, just inappropriate creepy sex.

This.

Â 
I think you can clearly see here that there is a fundamental difference. I know what they "tried" to portray, and I know what the true meaning behind it is. But imho it's undeniable that an Unsullied will see this as pure rape after watching it one time.
5173	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-04-21	Yeah and I noticed a couple of people being butchered in this series, at least I don't think they gave consent.
5174	Duckfield	2014-04-21	Shame. I was hoping they include the scene from Feast where he gives Pia the head of the soldier who raped her.
Â 
No chance for that now...
5175	MoA«t	2014-04-21	Aye, I never said it IS rape, as we all know better because of prior knowledge from books. My problem is not with what happened (which is why people going; "omg people get killed all the time" piss me off), it's with how it was portrayed in the series. They tried to use very subtle hints in a scene where context was very important imho. They butchered his character towards showwatchers as those will think that at this point in the story he's a rapist, which I am certain he's not.
I understand that Cersei deserved it, that worse things happened, even that HE did worse things, but those don't matter here. We're talking about how this specific event was translated from book to tv, which happened very poorly imho.

For what it's worth, I watch with several unsullied, and not one thought it was rape. 
Very creepy, and totally in character for the twincesters, definitely. One even mentioned that while it's up in the top five, it's probably not the strangest place those two have had sex.
5176	Carey Snow	2014-04-21	Guys, I think you're blowing this out of proportion... IMO, it's not far off what it was like in aSoS.


Â 
Here is the scene in the books:
Â 
"No," she says weakly when his lips moved down her neck, "Not here. The septons. . ."
Â 
"The Others can take the Septons." He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up on the Mother's altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath. She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, and about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of the Gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes. When he tore them away, he saw that her moon's blood was on her, but it made no difference.
Â 
"Hurry," she was whispering now, "quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime. Her hands helped guide him. "Yes," Cersei said as he thrust, "my brother, sweet brother, yes like that, yes, I have you, you're home now, you're home." She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair.
Â 
Â 
So yes, Cersei tells him not to at first because it is a crazy risky place for them to have sex at, but never does she not seem to be enjoying it and clearly she consents. This never comes across in the show, and if it was meant to... it was poorly done. I left the show with the impression that show Jaime raped show Cersei. I never had that impression in the books.
5177	Fjordgazer	2014-04-21	At least we can agree binge-watching Unsullied will pay attention to the little visual details and correctly conclude it was not rape. Again, a little better writing would have made wonders. Watch the scene mute, it doesn't translate as rape.
5178	Carey Snow	2014-04-21	@Rhasgul: so we agree it's not rape, but in the unsullied's consensus, it is. I don't find anything to argue here.
Â 
I do find the reactions way out of proportion. What Jaime did was basically disregard the equivalent of the old "not now, i'm too tired" from Cersei. That's hardly one 100th of the punishment she deserves for being the biggest bitch in Westeros. Are we going to get chastised for saying that a real-life woman like Gertrude Baniszewski deserved to be raped? That's the next step.


Â 
Â 
She just said no in the show. She never said the Not now I'm too tired. Or not here, it is to risky that we will be caught. She just says no and cries.Â 
Â 
Obviously in the book she is more worried about getting caught.
5179	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	My Unsullied Mother: "I'm disgusted with Jaime, really disappointed. Here I thought his experience with Brienne was inspiring him to try and be a better person - a "true knight" like her - but now he goes and rapes his sister?"Me: "I know, it's atrocious. In the book, he doesn't rape her at all. He and Cersei do have sex in the sept, but it's consensual. Jaime loves Cersei deeply and is fiercely loyal to her. He would - and has - done all sorts of terrible deeds for her sake, but he would never rape her. It's a total betrayal of who he is. The showrunners are morons."
Unsullied: "I just don't know if I can get over seeing that."
Â 
Way to go, HBO. Is this what you wanted? Was it worth it? Several seasons of a redemptive arc down the toilet all to convey that Cersei's not in control of the situation? Are you mad? In what universe is that a sane exchange? You could convey the same damn thing a million other ways that don't involve rape. Of all the horrible things a character can do, rape is probably the ultimate unforgivable. We'll cheer for drug dealers on Breaking Bad, mobsters on the Sopranos, serial killers on Dexter, etc...but no one will ever cheer for a rapist. Even in prison, rapists are the lowest of the low. Disgraceful.

5180	Brewmaster	2014-04-21	So yes, Cersei tells him not to at first because it is a crazy risky place for them to have sex at, but never does she not seem to be enjoying it and clearly she consents.

Well, part of the result of being inside Jaime's head is that, much like Jaime, the reader doesn't hear her protests...
 She pounded on his chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, and about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of the Gods. He never heard her. He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. 
Â 

...but protest she did

Â 
She definitely didn't just say the word "No". She did say some words about not being in the appropriate place. Go watch the scene again.
Â 
The major change from the book dialogue is having too many "no, no's" and cutting all the "yes, yes's". And that would've made all the difference in the world to the overly sensitive Unsullied, i bet.
5182	Itchyscratch	2014-04-21	She just said no in the show. She never said the Not now I'm too tired. Or not here, it is to risky that we will be caught. She just says no and cries.

You need to rewatch it. At no point does Cersei say No.
5183	Fjordgazer	2014-04-21	You need to rewatch it. At no point does Cersei say No.


Â 
And she certainly doesn't cry. At all.
Â 
EDIT: technically she says "Don't!" once. For the sake of detail. That doesn't change the fact that it is not rape.

5184	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-04-21	Wow, I can hardly wait until LittleFinger starts flexing, the poor upset people. This show is now "Loosely based" on the books.
5185	Khal Porno	2014-04-21	I've never been so disappointed in the board and its leadership, insofar as you, Ran, are the representative of it.
you have a woman saying no, saying this is wrong, but because her hand is clutching at the man, that means yes?
I can certainly understand a defense of the scene as a poor writing/editing decision and poor cutting of the scene, rather than a deliberate decision to make Jaime a rapist, but to try to convince all the people who heard a person saying no, and believing that no mean no, that, oh but her body is saying yes if you look really closely, that is disappointing and not what I expected here.


That's quite unfair.Â  I'd been waiting to get through the thread before replying here, but I feel like I need to go ahead and speak up in Ran's defense because this is a ridiculous charge.
Â 
I agree that it's best to err on the side of caution and take "no" for no.Â  It's always better to be safe than sorry.Â  However, I've been in relationships (this word is important here for context) where "no" oftentimes meant "yes" in a sexual setting, to the point where a girlfriend asked me "why'd you stop?"
Â 
There is a difference between what Cersei is saying and how she is behaving in this scene, as Ran pointed out.Â  She kisses him back and helps him undress, and spreads her legs for him.Â Â Â  It is clear that she allows him to do this.Â  Knowing Cersei, if she REALLY didn't want that to happen, and Jaime really was raping her, it would have played out much more brutally.
Â 
I think they could have gone to greater lengths to clarify on-screen what was going on here though.
5186	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-21	She doesn't say "no," sure, but "no" is not the only way to refuse consent. Words like, "Stop" and phrases like, "It's not right" are also forms of rejection. Also, acts of physical resistance like pushing are clear indications that consent has not been given. All of this applies to the so-called "non-rape" of Cersei.

She said a lot more than just "no."
She kept repeating, "it's not right", as she grabbed his clothing and drew him towards her, as she kissed him. http://m.youtube.com...h?v=g2kmZParU6A
Watch what she DOES, not what she says. She doesn't fight him physically.
5188	Carey Snow	2014-04-21	You need to rewatch it. At no point does Cersei say No.


Â 
Okay, book version:
Â 
"No," she says weakly when his lips moved down her neck, "Not here. The septons. . ."
Â 
"The Others can take the Septons." He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until she moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up on the Mother's altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath.

Â 
Show version:
Â 
http://www.youtube.c...h?v=g2kmZParU6A
Â 
Okay, I just rewatched it and I had mistaken the "stop it"sÂ  for "No"s.Â  And it is hard to tell if she is crying at the end, but I can not say that she is, so you are right there (I only watched it once last night). None the less, all that I hear is stop it even when he is thrusting, and never do i hear her consent.

Â 
But she 100% gives consent before the actual act.
Â 
"Hurry," she was whispering now, "quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now."
Â 
That would count as consent in any context. The protests were in context to getting caught by doing it in the sept.

5193	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-21	I've read some of this thread but not the whole thing. Forgive me if this has been discussed but:
GRRM basically said it wasn't rape in the books. I'd hope that perspective is part of this discussion.Author George R.R. Martin wrote about the scene Monday on his website, saying in the book, "Storm of Swords," "(Cersei) is as hungry for (Jaime) as he is for her." The dynamic, he writes, is different on the show, which played with the amount of time Jamie has been home. 
"If the show had retained some of Cersei's dialogue from the books," Martin writes, "it might have left a somewhat different impression." He went on to say, "The scene was always intended to be disturbing ... but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons."http://www.today.com...bing-1D79560771
5194	kishefmakherin	2014-04-21	Â 
I'll paraphrase myself: let's go find an actual attorney or law student and ask him. Your opinion is as good as mine.


Â 
How do you know you don't have one already?Â  Â 
Â 
It depends on whether there's a jury, and who is on that jury. And which state's laws we apply. Or maybe we apply the federal laws. Overall, it looks to me like the jury consisting of members of this forum won't be unanimous (and not just because of one or two people), so Jaime walks.
5195	Darth Pipes	2014-04-21	The show got all that publicity last week, all of it positive.Â  They got all that publicity this week and all of it is negative.Â  All because D and D made a stupid, baffling alteration to the original story or didn't edit the scene properly.Â  This is a case where all publicity isn't always good publicity.
5196	Carey Snow	2014-04-21	I've read some of this thread but not the whole thing. Forgive me if this has been discussed but:

Â 
Agreed. And glad Martin is saying something. All they had to do was leave in the:
Â 
"Hurry," she was whispering now, "quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime. Her hands helped guide him.
Â 
And they would have been fine. You have to really read between the lines to see it as not rape in the show as she tells him to stop through out. So the only way to see it as not rape is by her body language which is a tough one.
5197	Fjordgazer	2014-04-21	I fail to see how this has been "bad" publicity. Feminist blogs have been criticising controversial aspects of the show (sexposition, plentiful depiction of actual rapes) since, like, forever.
5198	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-21	The more full quote from GRRM:In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffreys death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself, that she has lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before her. Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her.
The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and he and Cersei have been in each others company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why [producers] played the sept out differently. But thats just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection.
Also, I was writing the scene from Jaimes POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You dont know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing.
If the show had retained some of Cerseis dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression  but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline.
Thats really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.
5199	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-21	Again, trying to ignore the foolishness, but sex without consent is rape.Â  That's not any different in the books.
I was answering the guy above you, but holding tight to fabric doesn't = sexual pleasure, unless pleasure is indicated in the scene.


I had an enema once. Â I was clutching anything within reach, and there was definitely nothing pleasurable about the experience.
Â 
I love this concept that the only way it wasn't rape is if she was overtly fighting, both verbally and physically, absolutely every second of the encounter. Â I understand that being a rape victim isn't something most people can easily empathize with, but the amount of ignorance on these almost 60 pages is absolutely astounding.
5200	scolbert08	2014-04-21	Sixty pages of complaining about the third or fourth worst thing a character in a fictional series fictionally did. People certainly have their priorities in the right place.

							Edited by davos, 21 April 2014 - 11:21 PM.
5203	Marillon	2014-04-21	The big question is, why do it that way. What did they accomplish by this. A lot of female viewers are already pretty turned off by a number of things in the way the story (which was pretty sensitive in the way it was presented in the books) has been adapted and presented.
Did this advance the story in some way that having Cersei say "Do me now" would not have done? If it didn't quite work, and it was absolutely necessary to bring Jaime back early (and I question the wisdom of this from an dramatic perspective, I think it sucked the drama out of this and other scenes) did they have to show the scene at all?
What was gained? I think nothing, and something was lost. I think they'll likely just carry on like nothing happened, meanwhile, this is pretty disturbing to have a character who has taken a stand repeatedly against rape in the narrative (and that's important) rape this woman who has meant so much to him. It seems like they don't weigh these things at all.


Exactly what I've been asking myself too, why? Unless Cersei in a mad fit of rage is later going to stab Jaime, what was the point of this change? It did nothing that sticking to the book wouldn't have done. The show is not suffering for ratings either that it needed a controversy boost, so what exactly was the point of this? Actually the fact that it got obviously consensual in the books heightened the scene even more and made it creepier, now it just doesn't make any sense. Maybe something happens further on that will make me go "ahhh so that's why they changed it", but right now, it's just stupid.

Just so we're clear. Is it forbidden as well to express that a character deserves to die? Is "death apology" not tolerated here either?

Â 
We (the mods) are pretty intolerant of wishing rape or torture on characters. It's really distasteful, but rape in particular as a means of revenge is particularly a way to alienate a significant number of female and male posters.
Â 
ETA: And if anyone wants to know who deleted their posts, it was me. I went on a deleting binge for ones that went way over the line. Because if I were just doing ones I found personally distasteful, half this thread would be gone. This thread is way over the post limit and close to being shut down for repetitiveness and length anyway.

Just so we're clear. Is it forbidden as well to express that a character deserves to die? Is "death apology" not tolerated here either?
Â 
Excuse my slightly sarcastic tone.


Â 
I know Kat commented on this but I wish to clarify my point. Â Its a fictional world, so its fine to wish things on characters that you wouldn't on a real person. Â Stating that someone deserves to die as a consequence of their actions is very different than wishing this on a person in real life. Â There are certain subjects though, where we have much less tolerance, particularly rape. Â Given the statistics about the number of people who dealt with rape during their lives, there are certainly a number of boarders who have either experienced this personally or are close to someone who has. Â Many of them have heard the same justifications to say a fictional rape was ok or that a character deserved it used to defend real life sexual assaults and rapes. Â Hence, we have a very low tolerance for posts containing this type of content. Â A similar approach is applied to torture.Â

5209	voodooqueen126	2014-04-21	Rape is worse than fucking your sister. The point however is that Jaime was on an upswing he's supposed to be redeeming himself inch by inch. Rape now sets him back again for no reason.


There is also the horrifying possibility that the director's believe that it is acceptable to rape Cersei because she's an evil woman who needs to be punished.

And here I hadn't considered that things COULD be worse.
5211	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-21	Forgive me if this has been posted, but according to the director Alex Graves the sex became consensual by the end. Director's quote is the last paragraph:http://www.ibtimes.c...roversy-1574209
They definitely could have done a better job of making that clear. Debate over? Lol

5212	sastelise	2014-04-21	This scene was poorly handled. As far as I remember from the book,Â it was consensual and it happened immediately when Jamie returned to KL. In the TV version, he'd been begging for sex in the episode before, and was denied; so how could his approach here not be thought of as anything but rape? Maybe, the intent of the producers was for Cersei to mean "no" in the sense that this is not appropriate in front of our dead son, but when has Cersei ever felt the need to be appropriate? For non-readers, this scene might also lead viewers to question the Jamie/Cercei dynamic altogether - maybe she was forced into this relationship by Jamie all along? But in the book it's clear that they are co-conspirators.Â 
Â 
Obviously theyÂ need Jamie to become so disillusioned with everything that he sends out Brienne to find and protect Sansa (it looks like next week's episode will cover this)Â and wants to getÂ as far awayÂ from Cercei as possible. But in the TV show they seem to be building his disillusion on sexual rejection, which dilutes the complexity of his character. In the books he seems increasingly disgusted with the whole scene in KL.

Â 
I've been saying this as I can, but it's not going to stop the debate.
Â 
To me, it's pretty clear cut - the writers and directors intended the scene to come across as consensual by the end. Â It was just poor execution and it wasn't as clear to the audience as they thought it would be.
Â 
The scene was just poorly executed. Â It's really that simple.

I agree. They did a poor, poor job. Maybe I need to bring my rating down a little bit. I didn't realize there was such a controversy till an hour ago.
5215	Night'sQueen	2014-04-22	Spare us the phony outrage. Â Only a very small few say this wasn't a rape. Â The real interesting / disturbing thing is why Cersei doesn't do anything about it afterwards. Â Sadly, the University Code of Conduct manual does not address this issue. Â It is not an uncommon event.

Spare me your lecturing/trolling. There are too many people saying this wasn't a rape when it clearly was. And if the director truly wasn't trying to convey a rape than this was a serious failure. As a fan, this changes the character arc for Jaime and the dynamic between Jaime and Cersei way too much for comfort. But beyond that, as a woman, for anyone to look at that scene on the show and say it was ambiguous in any way is really disturbing.
5216	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-22	I'm willing to accept that it was poorly shot, but it was not rape. I wish D&D would make a statement for the sake of Jamie's character, but they probably love the controversy.

Â 
Honestly, the only people in this whole thread who genuinely piss me off are the people saying they are "disturbed" by anyone who even questions whether the scene is rape.
Â 
We all know that "no means no". Â I don't see anyone here saying otherwise. Â No one is saying what Jaime did was anything other than reprehensible.
Â 
But for many people it is clear that Cersei was returning Jaime's passion even if she didn't want it right there. Â She was kissing back and pulling Jaime into her.
Â 
There is no doubt that either the writers or directors screwed up. Â Because it's way too subtle, and overall it definitely seems like a rape. Â They were trying to show Cersei wanted it by the end, but they screwed up.

Case in point: GTA V. Â Here's a game in which you spend a great deal of time carjacking, robbing, and killing all sorts of random NPC's, and a lot of players who have no problem with that violence were disturbed by the torture sequence in which the victim ends up surviving and being driven to the airport.
Â 
Rape is a more sensitive topic than death. Â I don't know exactly why, but it is. Â So too is torture. Â So too is animal cruelty, which is why Ned's killing of the dire wolf in 1.2 caused a bit of a stir despite having come 60 seconds after The Hound trotted Mycah's dead carcass across frame on the back of his horse (which was met with relative indifference).
Â 
An interesting topic to be sure, but it's a red herring as far as it relates to the conversation at hand. Â

I agree. The director said it was NOT rape. I've seen plenty of sex scenes in movies where the guy comes on to the girl, the girl says no for whatever reason and then a split second later she comes on to him. That's what the director was going for but he obviously failed miserably. But that's all this is--a directorial failure. It's not D&D trying to destroy Jamie's character arc, so please enough already with the indignation.
5220	Kat	2014-04-22	Lol. Very nice. I hope a little joke to lighten the mood is ok.


Â 
You know what's hilarious after two mods have come in here to clean things up? Rape jokes! Â FFS people, you're making this board look terrible. Have some class. This thread has run its course (and is too long). If someone wants to start it up with a different perspective, quotes, etc. please do.
5221	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-20	Aside from the obvious Meereen relation, Breaker of Chains refers to..
Â 
- The Hound breaking Arya's moral 'chains'
Â 
- Tywin breaking Cersei's chains to Tommen
Â 
- Tyrion breaking his chains to Podrick, and to a degree, Bronn
Â

Anything else?

I know, right. Why would Karl & co. keep them in chains? And then how the hell did they escape? But I suppose they had to put something in to explain how Sam, Gilly & a freaking baby got back to the Wall so much sooner than they did.

Â 
The [spoiler happened], could that be what I think it is? Could we still get some onscreen incestious cripple next-to-dead-body funeral sex? Because that would be awesome.

5265	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	I think Hizdahr will be the face of the Meereenese and will come off as a d-bag who people will expect Dany to just fry. When she begins to compromise it will be more powerful when she marries a guy we want dead.

Compromises are going to have to be made, regardless. As of this moment, their purpose appears to be far more singular compared to, say, Dorne, which has multiple ties to our main storylines (Myrcella being held there, the Sand Snakes going off to KL, Arianne/Aegon, etc) . The Battle for Meereen can just as easily be influenced by the Yunkai alone, and or other outside forces that don't depend on screentime being taken away to develop them. If Euron is even in the show (right now I'd say he's the only Greyjoy brother even the least bit likely to not be cut) they'll probably stick him with the Oldtown raid which he's physically a part of.
Â 
Anyway on an unrelated note.....since Hizdahr is being introduced so early into the season and Episode 6 is the start of the Sons of the Harpy arc, it's making me think they might proceed with the marriage between him and Dany by Episode 10 instead of holding off until the next season. It'd make sense production-wise, to lighten an already overly-heavy load for Season 5.

Â 
I've seen some pretty compelling arguments that Asha will die not long into TWOW, and if that's the case, then it's likely that she won't accomplish anything significant before doing so. Ditto for Victarion; if his only purpose is to get Dany some ships, well, there are other ways that could be accomplished. These are bold assumptions, yes, but not crazy ones.

Ditto for Victarion; if his only purpose is to get Dany some ships, well, there are other ways that could be accomplished. These are bold assumptions, yes, but not crazy ones.


I guess I'm just not as convinced that one of the major families of Westeros can just be lifted straight out of the story and out of the war without major major impact. And also not convinced that GRRM would go through the trouble of including Asha, Euron, and Victarion, if the goal all along was for none of them to accomplish anything significant or impact the story in any relevant way.
5270	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Opeahnoodlemantra (an old stage name of Johnny Depp's, I believe?) has it right. The shot of a woman's silhouette in a dark tunnel in the first released trailer looked to be the underground area where she locked up her children. That will end her arc. We already know they've cast the Goatherd, who the trailers have shown us, has his child et up by Drogon. The actor's name is Darren Kent and he gave an interview months back where he gave away that he was in a very emotional scene, which could only be him presenting the child's remains to Dany's court. We know he appears in an Alex Graves-directed episode from his CV, so that would be either episode eight or ten, in time to set up the locking up of the dragons as an end to Dany's s4 arc. Appropriately it would end with Dany choosing the "children" to whom she is "Mhysa" over the children to whom she is the Mother of Dragons.
5271	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-15	Here's what happens
In King's Landing: Tyrion is taken to a cell, where he is visited by Podrick. Margeary and Olenna discuss their newfound position. Tywin offers Oberyn a spot on the judges' bench. Oberyn participates in an orgy. Cersei and Jaime visit their son in the sept. Sansa escapes with Dontos and meets with Baelish.
Â 
In the Riverlands: Arya and Sandor are taken in and fed, but Sandor just robs the nice family.
Â 
In the North: The wildlings attack a village, where a boy escapes and tells the Night's Watch. Grenn and Edd make it back to the Wall from Craster's Keep. Jon warns (again) of Mance's army. Sam drops Gilly off at Mole's Town.
Â 
At Dragonstone: Stannis and Davos discuss Joffrey's death.
Â 
Across the Narrow Sea: Daenerys arrives at the gates of Meereen, treats with Hizdahr, and lays siege to the city with catapults after Daario defeats the champion.
No Bran or Theon.
Â 
Am I missing anything?
5272	Pinkie Baelish	2014-04-15	Wow, they're really rushing through the source material this season. So, Gilly and Maester Aemon are leaving with Sam the next episode? I hope not. We would miss Sam's best moment in getting the NW to elect Jon as LC, as well as the Lightbringer scene with Aemon and Stannis.
5273	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	^No. From one Roose thumbnail to another, I'll tell you that Sam is bringing Gilly to Mole's Town, thinking she'll be safer there.
5274	Pinkie Baelish	2014-04-15	^No. From one Roose thumbnail to another, I'll tell you that Sam is bringing Gilly to Mole's Town, thinking she'll be safer there.


.
Which of course, starts the highly anticipated arc of Gilly's conquest to win "Mole Town's Next Top Whore"
5275	Annara Snow	2014-04-15	Wow, they're really rushing through the source material this season. So, Gilly and Maester Aemon are leaving with Sam the next episode? I hope not. We would miss Sam's best moment in getting the NW to elect Jon as LC, as well as the Lightbringer scene with Aemon and Stannis.


Â 
They're leaving Castle Black, but I don't think they'll be going to Oldtown yet. And Maester Aemon has no reason to leave Castle Black yet.
5276	Queen of Whores	2014-04-15	Which of course, starts the highly anticipated arc of Gilly's conquest to win "Mole Town's Next Top Whore"

Gilly's already a MILF, I reckon she'd win.
5277	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Apparently he instructs the Madam there to not have Gilly whored out. I don't know why exactly he'd feel she'd be safer in Mole's Town but I'm sure they'll explain that adequately.
Â 
As for some folks thinking that Sam would go to Oldtown already. Come on, we know from the trailers and whatnot that he has plenty of more scenes with Jon. Didn't you all watch the Foreshadowing feature and whatnot. There's much more to come of him at CB. No need to fret.
5278	Queen of Whores	2014-04-15	Isn't Mole's Town going to get raided by the wildlings though? I guess Sam didn't think very far ahead.
5279	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	According to interviews he's done recently,Â John BradleyÂ talks about a decisionÂ Sam makes early on that's selfish and weak that he comes to regret. I don't know quite how this plays out, but yeah he'll come to regret putting Gilly and baby SamÂ in harm's way. Don't worry though, the show won't kill Gilly off prematurely because Hannah Murray talked about being a part of an episode set entirely at the Wall in an interview. That means episode nine, so she survives Mole's Town.

Â 
'Those two villagers you guys meet early this season -- his prediction for them is grim, and he's probably right' 
Â 
People at IGN must have only seen the first 3 episodes (unless they were given more episodes by HBO?) so it looks like Arya and The Hound will meet some villagers in the next ep and something will happen between them (he mentioned 2 villagers so i dont think episode 3 will have the gift of mercy, which, from the previews,Â looks like Arya/Hound meet just one guy dying in the woods)

Â 
Well done, I also think that this is what we will see.
It would be far too early for Sam to head to Oldtown.
5284	King Tommen	2014-04-15	To address a few things here:
Â 
Dany-As has been mentioned previously, they aren't getting into the Sons of the Harpy stuff this season. The shots in the trailer of the guy getting swarmed is a master getting killed by an uprising of slaves which is how Dany is going to take Meereen. The crates being flung over the Meereen walls in the preview this episode contain a bunch of broken slave collars which is her message to the slaves to give them some new ideas about what they should be doing. The masters are suitably freaked out when they see what the implication of Dany's message is. Hizdahr appearing so early is to give the nobles of Meereen a face and to set him up as a player down the road.
Â 
Balon-It seems the show is going to keep Balon alive for now as Roose has linked the Ironborn still occupying the North to Balon's command so they'll probably hold off on him dying until after Moat Cailin.
Â 
Ramsay-It will be interesting to see if the Moat Cailin stuff happens sooner or is held off until later in the season. It certainly seems like Roose has told Ramsay to go there right now. We know that when Yara attacks the Dreadfort, both Ramsay and Theon are there so either that happens very soon or Ramsay/Theon liberates Moat Cailin first and head back to the Dreadfort where the Yara attack happens at the end of the season.
5285	Frumpus	2014-04-15	Â 
Yes, and he was in 4x01 as one of Jon's "judges."


If you mean the guy who helped Maester Aemon, he is actually Othell Yarwyck. Bryan Cogman pulled a switcheroo on everyone.

If true that's really weird. Why not just keep Bowen instead? He's far more important overall, since I'm assuming they're not gonna go to the effort of casting both Bowen and Othell. They might surprise me and do just that though, I dunno.
5289	Mark Antony	2014-04-15	Hizdahr already! Gods
5290	Lord Jennings	2014-04-15	The last episode of season 4 is called 'The Children' Dany's storyline will probably end with her chaining up her 'children'.


Â 
Pretty sure "the chidren" will be for the children of the forest that Bran will encounter when he finally gets to BR.Â The part of "child of the forest" has been cast for season 4. Same for the three eyed crow.

5292	Dany's Silver	2014-04-15	I don't think the TV series is going to pursue the Ironborn storylines that are in the book.Â  I think Yara is going to get captured and flayed (I know in the books some woman gets flayed by Ramsay, but as I think they are going to close the Ironborn storylines out of the TV series, I predict they'll end with Yara's capture and flaying.Â  Perhaps, Reek will get to kill Ramsay in the end somehow, but who knows.

See below. Are we assuming Yara/Asha and Euron and Victarion literally aren't going to do anything significant in the books? At all? These are some very bold assumptions.

I very much agree. They can't cut out one of the Great Houses from Westeros!

I agree on Balon. I expected it to be in 401. It's just weird that out of the 3 dead kings Balon is the first to die in the book but last in the show. Not that it'll majorly effect the storyline I just kind of want to see it happen already.Â
5296	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-15	Â 
I wonder how they'll portray that. Do they actually show Balon die, or do they just mention through other characters that he's fallen to his death so as to leave the suspicion up in the air?


I'm hoping they leave it up in the air. I really like the theory that Euron sent a FM after him.Â
5297	King Tommen	2014-04-15	Â 
According to the GoT Wiki page, that was Bowen at the "trial"
Â 
http://gameofthrones...iki/Bowen_Marsh


Â 
Brian Cogman came on Wic.net to specifically correct that. The GoT Wiki has it wrong. They assumed Brian Fortune was playing Bowen Marsh and Cogman specifically said that he is playing Othell Yarwyck. Bowen Marsh has not been cast on the show at this point. He will either be introduced in S5 by a more established actor than Fortune (who is just a featured extra) or Marsh's actions will be taken by a NW character that the audience already knows.
Â 
I would assume Othell Yarwyck will do nothing more than stand around in the background of scenes which is more or less what Fortune did in previous seasons. He's not an actor up to the calibre of what they need for a pivotal role like Bowen Marsh.Â  I'm sure that's why they made him someone else who really doesn't do anything.

Where are you getting this from? Are there any reviews of the third episode?
5302	Widows_Blood	2014-04-15	Â

She isn't trying to capture the Dreadfort but rescue Theon.Â
5303	YuvalTheVal	2014-04-15	How long until we see Sansa meeting up with Littlefinger?
5304	King Tommen	2014-04-15	She isn't trying to capture the Dreadfort but rescue Theon.Â 


Â 
Not to mention that like Winterfell, the Dreadfort doesn't appear to be heavily manned because most of their able bodied men went South with Roose. Roose's forces are trapped in the Neck and even after Moat Cailin, will probably be heading to WInterfell, not the Dreadfort.
Â 
I think a force of 50 fierce Ironborn could breach the walls in this scenario (they're supposed to be travelling up the Weeping Water which would most likely be the easier entry point for attack).
5305	King Tommen	2014-04-15	How long until we see Sansa meeting up with Littlefinger?


Â 
It will most likely be in the opening minutes of this episode.
5306	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	^Yeah, I imagine it will start off with a continuation of the direct PW aftermath and Tyrion's arrest etc. Then Cersei will shout something about arresting Sansa to, then we'll notice she's goneÂ and cut to her and Dontos on foot through the alleyways of KL.

Â 
I think it's Dany firing the barrels filled with broken slave collars over the walls of Meereen and the reaction of both the slaves and masters to what this implies.
5309	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-15	As far as Balon goes, I also thought he'd be gone before Joffrey, but since that hasn't happened I'll venture a guess that he'll die in eitherÂ First of His Name (episode five) or the season finale. Hell, he could even go in episode six, since that's supposed to be a Grejoy heavy episode.Â 
Â 
I think it makes sense to delay his death, though. Joffrey and Robb were central figures in the story since the first season, whereas Balon is a very minor character who has only appeared in a handful of episodes total. Having him die later in the season keeps the incident more fresh in the mind of non-readers, and the death of the king of the Iron Islands will be something they'll want the audience to recollect if they plan on introducing Euron & Victarion next season.Â 
Â 
So maybe it happens mid-season, maybe it happens in the finale, but either way it seems pretty logical to have him die last, considering how his death may potentially lead to an entirely new sub-plot with two brand new characters in the following season.Â
5310	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Sati, it ends with the siege of Meereen. They catapult broken collars over the walls to show that the slaves can take action by themselves, which I guess leads us to the slaves shanking masters in ep. 4.

Â 
And then cut to Sansa and Dontos runing in the streets of King's Landing and meeting with Littlefinger.
Â 
... Or opening directly with Sansa and Dontos.
5312	Pinkie Baelish	2014-04-15	Any chance they could somehow incorporate the Ghost of High Heart's vision about Balon's death into the show? Maybe show Balon dying through one of Bran's weirwood visions, with a Faceless Man standing by the bridge having a crow perched on his shoulder?

IMO fifty seems to be to few to breach the walls, but enough to (somehow) infiltrate the castle, if it's lightly manned as it should. Then again, this is D&D, also known by Robb Stark's Season 3 war campaign.

I think it will begin like the promo, with wide shot of the wedding and then Cersei yelling 'YOU did this!!!', then the guards take Tyrion away and we see Sansa running with Dontos in the next shot. Hopefully there will be 'the boy is gone, Cersei' moment from the book where she refuses to let go off Joffrey's body.

5318	Seer of Green	2014-04-16	The shot in the trailer that shows sam and gilly leaving presumably for oldtown, which if memory serves happens on jon's order as lord commander, does that mean we may get a lord commander vote next episode?

If you remember, they spend time in Braavos before reaching Oldtown. Something happens in Braavos. I know many have been speculating on why the Titan of Braavos was shown in the trailer. That's why we will see Braavos. Not because of Arya making it there this season like most seen to think. Seems like many forget that Sam and Gilly end up in Braavos. But then again, is Arya there when Sam and Co. arrive?
5319	Konradsmith	2014-04-16	No, Sam and Gilly will not go to Oldtown or Braavos this season. We already know why we'll see Braavos this season as well.
5320	Seer of Green	2014-04-16	Â 
They're leaving Castle Black, but I don't think they'll be going to Oldtown yet. And Maester Aemon has no reason to leave Castle Black yet. 
There's actually no reason for Sam and Gilly to leave yet either. That is, if they stay true to the source material. The whole reason they leave is to get the son of Rayder away from Melisandre and for Sam to get his Maester's chain. So they should t be leaving until after the attack on Castle Black and Stannis's subsequent arrival.

Was I just being obtuse here or is this reaching?

Could also be Bran reaching the cave and meeting "the children". Its likely going to be a bit of both.


The Children of the Forest are definitely in that episode Â

5339	grumdin	2014-04-18	Also, Hannah Murray said in an interview that she would be in an episode centered around the Wall. She is referring to episode nine. So they'll briefly go somewhere else 
	Spoiler  Mole's Town, be put in harm's way 
 and then come back.


So episode 9 is the wilding siege, giants and all? I assume Stannis will show up near the end..........burning everyone in sight for being a 'heathen' or some such.......meh. All the CGI budget will be going there, like the blackwater. Fingers crossed they do it justice.
5340	Konradsmith	2014-04-18	^It will be the battle from the south as well, they've merged the initial attack of Castle Black with the siege. Apparently most of the CG budget is actually being spent on episode ten according to Alex Graves and D and D in different interviews. As for your expectation about Stannis, that is doubtful. We have no reason to assume that that will differ from the books in any way.

Â 
Interesting that they said most of the CG budget is for episode 10. I can think of a few things that would definitely fit that:
Â 

	Spoiler Drogon killing the child, Bloodraven and his cave
.
Â 
Other than those two nothing much else comes to mind that would make it significantly more CG-heavy than any other episode, let alone 9.
5342	Konradsmith	2014-04-18	^Alex Graves said a 
	Spoiler  battle too, a CGI heavy battle on which the CG wouldn't be finished until JuneÂ right beforeÂ it airs. A lot of people on wicnet assumed he meant the fight with the wights outside of BR's cave. Since we got a WW in the second trailer and since Meera has dragonglass arrowheads I think some of them boys will be included too.

5345	Father of Dragons	2014-04-18	Aha! I may have worked the Greyjoy situation out!
When Yara unsuccessfully attacks the Dreadfort, Ramsay takes her as a prisoner. Balon or the captain of Moat Cailin will return only return it for Yara. Ramsay, in a deviation from the books, hands her over and lets her return to the Iron Islands. At this point, show-Ramsay has not been legitimised, and this is all that he wants, as D&D, George and Iwan have constantly reminded us of, so he'll do anything to "impress" his father. Remember what Roose said: "Take the Moat for our family, and I'll reconsider your position." Yara arrives home either just after, or just before Balon's death, setting up the Kingsmoot for next season.
Apologies if anyone else has already thought about this and I've just stolen it.
5346	Grrrod	2014-04-18	Â

Apologies if anyone else has already thought about this and I've just stolen it. I think that is a pretty clever idea
5348	SM4e	2014-04-18	I think it will work out the following:
- Yara will attack The Dreadfort in order to rescue Theon (who she believes alive)
- Ramsay wins the battle and makes Yara believe that Theon is dead
- Yara escapes alone or with just a few survivors to Moat Cailin where Victarion has put Ralf Kenning in power
- Kenning tells Yara that Balon is dead and that Victarion has left for the Kingsmoot - Yara leaves as well
- Moat Cailin happens as it does in the books
Â 
By the way, I assume that Balon's death will happen in 4x05 as the episode is called "First of his name" and I do also find it intelligent to place Balon's death last because this impacted Robb's and Joffrey's death. If they had Balon die first, the Unsullied had assumed that Robb and Joffrey had it coming as well. Balon is the guy that the least care about, therefore they made his death as anticlimatic as possible.
Â 
Â 
Regarding episode 10, this is how I picture the CGI heavy things:
- Lady Stoneheart (very few budget needed)
- Bran, Jojen, Meera and Hodor vs. The Wights. The Children appear to help them and the fight will appear longer and more dramatic than it does in the books (Possible death of any of Bran's companions!?). Bloodraven. (lot CGI needed)
- The Unsullied trying to chain the dragons; they manage to catch Viserion and Rhaegal. Drogon is furious and burns several Unsullied. Later Daenerys visits Viserion and Rhaegal in the cellar. (lot CGI needed)

- Kenning tells Yara that Balon is dead and that Victarion has left for the Kingsmoot - Yara leaves as well
- Moat Cailin happens as it does in the books
Â 
This seems more likely, but I'm not so sure about Yara just simply escaping
5350	SM4e	2014-04-18	Well, I actually meant that she acknowledges her loss and leaves for Moat Cailin. I don't think that she will be captured by Ramsay or other Bolton man. I see the Kingsmoot happening after all, yet in a smaller extent.
5351	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-18	I really hope the CG isn't for LS. I'm so tired of movies/shows using CG where an excellent makeup artist could make it 10X more realistic and gruesome.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
As far as the Greyjoys and Dorne for that matter, I will make a conservative prediction and say that both will be included in the show, but it will be a very truncated version compared to what goes on in the books, especially the Greyjoys. I won't be shocked if the Kingsmoot is not included. I could see the show naming Euron king, showing one raid, and then the next we see of them they're in Mereen.Â

I am always interested in the battle of Castle Black, though I have to say, I do not know how could wildling shoot arrows at target on the top of the wall which is 700 feet above them? is it even possible?
5353	SeventySeven	2014-04-18	Here's what happens
In King's Landing: Tyrion is taken to a cell, where he is visited by Podrick. Margeary and Olenna discuss their newfound position. Tywin offers Oberyn a spot on the judges' bench. Oberyn participates in an orgy. Cersei and Jaime visit their son in the sept. Sansa escapes with Dontos and meets with Baelish.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Excellent. No wonder between the sept scene and Oberyn participating in an orgy, reviewers have said this is the weakest episode.

5354	pwnt	2014-04-18	Interesting ideas about how the TV series is going to handle the Iron Islands people.Â  Personally, I think they (iron isles and characters therein) are going to written out of the TV series--it's already convoluted enough.Â  I think Yara is going to get captured and flayed alive and Ramsay will make Theon help him flay her.Â  They'll take Moat Cailin, Balon will drown and that is that.Â  Maybe at the end of the TV series, Theon will get to kill Ramsay or some such, but I think the iron isles are toast as far as the TV series is concerned.

Hey I'm with you. The heavy dose of Ironborn was one of the main reasons I skimmed through certain chapters in Feast. I could care less if they're written out of the show. They'll only be included if they have some pivotal roll to play in the endgame that cannot be given to some other character. If this is the case then I stick by my prediction that their time in the show will still be very limited.
5356	King Tommen	2014-04-18	Alfie Allen has said that he and Yara share scenes together this season so they can't have Ramsay tell her Theon's dead so that she leaves. Far more likely she's captured in the battle at the Dreadfort. The question is more about what happens after that.Â  My assumption is that she stays with Ramsay as a prisoner for the longhaul which will enhance the Theon/Ramsay dynamic by adding another element. Eventually, Theon will come to his senses and find a way to get Yara out and then they'll rejoin Stannis outside Winterfell and you'll have their storylines reset to the book.
5357	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-18	Hey I'm with you. The heavy dose of Ironborn was one of the main reasons I skimmed through certain chapters in Feast.

Â 
Same here. It's not even that I could care less for the Ironborn, I just openly despise them. I found it so bloody hard to get through their chapters in the books, especially that we were given POVs of several of them on the same topic. I think even in the books they're gonna get eliminated pretty soon, with the exception of Asha and Theon. So the less of them we see in the show, the better.
Â 
Yara's situation will be interesting to watch, cause really, if you look at all the places she's supposed to be and all the things she's supposed to witness, I think it's safe to say she has MUCH more to do this season than Dany.
Â 
I'm also curious if Bran and co.'s battle with the Wights, meeting the Child and Bloodraven all happens this season. If so, there is practically no storyline for Bran for season 5. Thanks to GRRM cosntantly moving her chapters to the next books, there is not much more for Sansa either. I wonder how they will solve this out and if GRRM as the show's writer will drop some book spoilers into the show before WoW gets published.
Â 
I sure hope the Hound giving Arya another lesson is "remember where the heart is". I was missing it in the inn scene.
5358	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-18	Is there a separate thread to post end of season stuff ATM? I know some people have posted episode ten/season 4 as a whole stuff here so I'd like to voice my thoughts and questions as well but if they can be moved am all for that.
Â 
I think everyone's in agreement that the battle for CB/Stannis' arrival will occur in Ep. 9. That makes logical sense, as Jon can be elected LC still either at the end of that ep or the start of 10 before Sam, Gilly, Aemon and co. leave for Oldtown.Â 
Â 
For episode 10, as a few people have pointed out, we'll (hopefully) get Dany chaining up her dragons, Bran arriving at the cave, Stannis asking Jon to be Lord of Winterfell, Sam and co. sailing off, Arya heading off to Braavos, if we haven't already seen it Lysa heading out the Moon Door (probably ep. 8 I'm thinking) and of course Tyrion and Tywin in the privy.
Â 
Which brings up the question of Lady Stoneheart. As much as I'd really, really like to see this scene, I think it has a good chance to be cut. I'm praying this isn't the case but I feel that they're going to cut most of the Brotherhood stuff out since in the grand scheme of things they are not overly important. The logistics of it presents a major problem too; after having a char like Tywin get killed off, pulling off zomb-Cat immediately afterwards will be tough. I think they can do it if they arrange the episode correctly though, like having Tywin die 2/3rds of the way through or something. Which would leave the weak Dany scene as a strong choice for last one before LS reveal.Â 
Â 
Regarding season 5 though, I highly doubt they'll cut out the Ironborn stuff. The way the Game of Thrones works in general is that new players are constantly being shuffled through and I feel that D&D and the writers could easily sell Season 5 as a "new players" season after the original war is basically over in Season 4 (i.e. four of the original 5 kings die). So I'm sure in Season 5, since the material from AFfC and ADwD isn't as good as ASoS but is still interesting, we'll see players like Euron, Victarion, and Quentyn quite early while the subplot/B story will be the Cersei-Margery feud as well as Riverlands stuff.Â

Wow, so this is interesting. This might either imply that Yara will make it into the Dreadfort and see Reek, but has to escape as Stannis had to during the Battle of the Blackwater. This would even strengthen Theon's belief that he is lost because he sees Yara leaving him with Ramsay and his fury for Yara attacking.
On the other hand this might also mean, as you said, that Yara is captured and so on. I am curious to see how this works out.

However, if they didn't include her D&D would just find some other way to drive Jamie and Brienne's storyline. Personally, I just believe it cheapens the story to have someone come back to life that you thought was dead for an entire season, and while I love me some Stark vengeance, I'd rather see it from characters that are actually alive not a mute zombie.Â

5364	Father of Dragons	2014-04-18	My thoughts on the LS situation is that we won't see the scene with Merret or another Frey. Brienne will likely have her "brawl" with Rorge and Biter (if it's them) in episode 8, and she'll be taken by the brotherhood to meet LS on episode 10.
5365	Konradsmith	2014-04-18	^She could always witness LSH and the BWB hanging a Frey and then have a cliffhanger once LSH turns her attention to her.
5366	iheartseverus	2014-04-18	I keep thinking back to that interview John Bradley (Sam) did sometime back.Â  When he revealed there would be no Coldhands in the show, he also added that another book character fans will be expecting, isn't going to be in the show.Â  I immediately took that to mean LS, but who knows?
5367	SeventySeven	2014-04-18	They wouldn't bother to send Brienne on her quest, if LSH wasn't to be included. I'd bet on Uncat making an appearance, not sure when, but if that wasn't the case Brienne's quest would have been left out entirely.
5368	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-18	They wouldn't bother to send Brienne on her quest, if LSH wasn't to be included. I'd bet on Uncat making an appearance, not sure when, but if that wasn't the case Brienne's quest would have been left out entirely.


Yeah I'm pretty sure LS will make it ; even if she doesn't end up doing much in the long run, she's pivotal for Jaime and Brienne's respective arcs, and I don't see who could plausibly replace her.
Â 
I'm also really looking forward to the Marg/Cersei 'banter'.
5369	Konradsmith	2014-04-18	I don't think LS can be cut. Keep in mind they kept the scene where Cat says she'd never ask anything of Brienne that would compromise her honour. As nice a scene as it was,Â the real reason to include it is asÂ set up forÂ what's to come.

5371	TheRatCook	2014-04-18	I don't think the TV series is going to pursue the Ironborn storylines that are in the book.Â  I think Yara is going to get captured and flayed (I know in the books some woman gets flayed by Ramsay, but as I think they are going to close the Ironborn storylines out of the TV series, I predict they'll end with Yara's capture and flaying.Â  Perhaps, Reek will get to kill Ramsay in the end somehow, but who knows.


Well that would depend on how central the Victarion/Dany arc is the ending. I don't see how they can cut the Iron Born out entirely unless its not important.

Assuming this is quite likely to be another character of the northern storyline (which Bradley is a part of), Val is also a possibility.Â
5374	King Tommen	2014-04-18	Sansa specifically stated in the S4 premiere that they had cut Cat's throat and thrown her in the river. Not sure what more of a hint you would require...
5375	JonDunn	2014-04-18	Aha! I may have worked the Greyjoy situation out!
When Yara unsuccessfully attacks the Dreadfort, Ramsay takes her as a prisoner. Balon or the captain of Moat Cailin will return only return it for Yara. Ramsay, in a deviation from the books, hands her over and lets her return to the Iron Islands. At this point, show-Ramsay has not been legitimised, and this is all that he wants, as D&D, George and Iwan have constantly reminded us of, so he'll do anything to "impress" his father. Remember what Roose said: "Take the Moat for our family, and I'll reconsider your position." Yara arrives home either just after, or just before Balon's death, setting up the Kingsmoot for next season.
Apologies if anyone else has already thought about this and I've just stolen it.

Â 
i agree. i also agree that jaime an brienne could get a new story line to keep things moving for them but i think stoneheart will appear because of that dream bran has where cat has a green skin tone and is very angry. they couldn't foreshadow her arrival any better than that and i fully expect that clip to be shown in the "previously on games of thrones" segment when she is revealed.

5382	sati	2014-04-19	I don't think LS can be cut. Keep in mind they kept the scene where Cat says she'd never ask anything of Brienne that would compromise her honour. As nice a scene as it was,Â the real reason to include it is asÂ set up forÂ what's to come.


Â 
Yeah and that creepy dream Bran had last season. No way she is gonna be cut from the show, her appearance is a cliffhanger like no other.
5383	Hath4	2014-04-19	Yara being captured by ramsay would be extremely repetitive. I think she will attack the dreadfort loss and retreat to deep wood Mott where she will be captured next year.
5384	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-19	Since Balon is still alive in the show, I think the Kingsmoot and Yara's presence there is all the more likelier so this is how I would do it:
Â 
Ep 6: Yara attacks the Dreadfort and fails to rescue Theon (Gemma Whelan was interviewed and said she filmed scenes with Alfie Allen)Â 
Ep 7: She retreats to Moat Cailin where she hears about Balon's death, leaves Ralf Kenning in charge (just like her uncle Victarion did in the books)
Ep 8: Ramsay catches up to Moat Cailin, Reek parlays with the Ironborn, the Ironborn are all flayed to death
Ep 10: Ramsay and Roose armies reunite (my only problem is the finale is suppose to be one hell of a ride, so maybe the flaying won't happen until this ep)
Â 
Season 5 Kingsmoot. Probably Episode 1, since Victarion needs to start sailing to Dany ASAP. Â I don't know if Deepwood Motte makes the cut, but she does need to get captured by Stannis after the Kingsmoot. Â She'll at least run away from Euron and the husband she's forced to marry.

5385	Conchobar	2014-04-19	They better show the brutality of Ramsay in that episode. I hope they don't hold back on the scene Theon sees of the Ironborn men's bodies after the parlay.
5386	Hath4	2014-04-19	well the show has gone wayÂ further than martin did in showing ramsays brutality. Most of it is mentioned off page in the novels. The psychological torture is actually better in showing off how evil he is. him and Euron are the best at mind crushing mind games. though I think that scene is important and somewhat sad because they were sympathetic and only wanted some food and toÂ go home. I hope the show portrays the ironborn at moat cailin as sympathetic as martin did.
5387	lostinasia	2014-04-19	well the show has gone wayÂ further than martin did in showing ramsays brutality. Most of it is mentioned off page in the novels.


I agree that the show is displaying more of the violence, but they've developed another problem for themselves: Show-Ramsay is too charismatic. Â Not quite Hannibal Lecter, but in that vein - he's someone who you know is a bad guy, and he's doing terrible things, but on the show he's somehow not as loathsome as he is in the books. There are plenty of "Wow, this guy is evil" moments, but I don't think they've presented enough "I want this guy dead!" moments - unlike Joffrey, who made himself more despicable and unlikeable pretty much every time he opened his mouth.
Â 
But we'll see how it develops. I thought the hunting scene that opened last week's episode was "good" in showing his brutality and trying to pass on the villain torch.
5388	Hath4	2014-04-19	well I think most book readers would say they hate joffreyÂ more even though he doesn't hold a torch to characters like ramsay, euron , the mountain. that's because of his spoiled personality. people can not stand the spoiled brat. Ramsay and euron are more psychotic and terrible but at least they had to work there way up unlike joffrey would was born with the silver spoon.
5389	iheartseverus	2014-04-19	I just watched the preview again.Â  For some reason, I just have to laugh at the last scene with Dany, only because the phrase is so common in our own world--she's saying 'I have something to say to Meereen,' and I envision a boyfriend/girlfriend or brother/sister or whatever, squabbling:

'I have just one thing to say to you!'

5394	iheartseverus	2014-04-19	I have to say I miss our Russian agents this year.Â  Last year, by Saturday afternoons, we were inundated with screengrabs from the upcoming episode.Â  I loved it, enjoyed studying and analyzing each still, trying to interpret exactly what was happening.Â  I miss 'From Russia, With Love,'Â  booooo.

Â 
Â 
Ohh. Gotcha. I thought that was obvious since the Battle at the Wall was happening in episode 9.Â
5396	Dysun	2014-04-19	Cutting Stoneheart makes no sense, they would not have bothered with Beric or Brienne's quest if that was the endgame.
Â 
Cutting the Ironborns, that I could see. Although I would personally hate it, I feel Euron and Victarion must remain but the Kingsmoot/Damphair stuff could be easily dropped.

Â 
Yeah, I suspect Damphair will be dropped too, and if there is a Kingsmoot, it will be greatly reduced in scale.
5398	MR92	2014-04-19	Â 
i agree. i also agree that jaime an brienne could get a new story line to keep things moving for them but i think stoneheart will appear because of that dream bran has where cat has a green skin tone and is very angry. they couldn't foreshadow her arrival any better than that and i fully expect that clip to be shown in the "previously on games of thrones" segment when she is revealed.


i just find that whenever D+D make a large departure from the show and make something up, it never works. Â Take the weird brienne scenes so far this season. Â Qarth was horrible and ruined dany in season 2. Â the theon torture all season was awful. Â If they make something up for brienne and jaime, im afraid its gonna be another character story arc ruined. Â

Not to mention those horrible Shae scenes this season.
5400	King Tommen	2014-04-19	For every instance they tried a deviation that didn't work so well, there are examples of deviations that worked just fine like Arya interacting with Tywin, Gendry being substituted for Edric Storm, Theon almost telling Robb about Balon's betrayal before burning the letter, Rickon and Osha staying with Bran after Winterfell, Tormund leading the southern Wildling raid, Ned seeing Arya in Baelor and alerting Yoren etc. etc.
Â 
And although we haven't seen them occur on screen, I think the Craster's Keep mission, Bronn pairing up with Jaime instead of Ilyn Payne and Yara attacking the Dreadfort instead of hanging out at Deepwood Motte for a year will all come off pretty well.
Â 
So, feel free to cite examples of things that didn't work out on the show but don't try and say that every single time the show strays from the books, it's terrible. Because that's just not true.

Agreed, although Arya with Tywin is debatable. Don't get me wrong, the interaction was cute, well-acted and served to make Tywin more three-dimensional, but Arya's stay at Harrenhal on screen was child's play compared to what she went through in the book; she was never in any danger and it felt more like the Jaqen H'gar (sp?) show (which is not such a bad thing because Tom was great, but Arya's development is more important in greater context).
Â 
The only other bad deviations I feel are worth noting are Stannis in 3x10, Mance Rayder, Sansa's stupidity in season three, Robb's love story and Dany's stay in Qarth. The rest of the show has been great.
5402	I'm_Tim	2014-04-19	They're not going to cut the Ironborn guys. If anything, they make for good TV. They're like bad ass Vikings and people eat that shit up. I would guess Asha breaches the Dreadfort and finds Theon. Theon refuses to leave or sets her up. I wouldn't even be surprised if Ramsay and Asha have an epic 1 on 1 fight. Asha either retreats or escapes and goes back to the Iron Islands for the Kingsmoot. 
I wouldn't be surprised if either Euron or Victarion have some sort of major role in the war with the Others. Either through Victarion and the Red God or Euron and his horn.
5403	King Tommen	2014-04-19	Agreed, although Arya with Tywin is debatable.

Â 
As you watched Season 2, those concerns had some validity. Based on where we are with Arya at this point, do we really still think she hasn't gone through enough hell in order to get her character where she needs to be? It was a conscious decision to delay a lot of her hardship until the following season and I think looking back, you can see why they went this way.

	Spoiler Because they either claim that she takes away from tragedy of RW (which is just the opposite - Catelyn is not at peace, she is hateful, tormented and vengeful shell now) or their hatred for Cat gets transferred to LS which is also not a reason to say 'hey she is lame, I bet she will be cut because I don't like her so that's what counts'.

Yeah but even beyond the 'was is a good idea' or 'is she a good character'Â debate, she's too important to other characters' arcs to be cut, unless theyÂ replace her with something/someone else (which would make zero sense), there's no way she can be cut.

Â 
I'm actually quite serious. If my relationship with this show was a marriage, I'd already have one foot out the door since the chances of the books being completed first is rather bleak (not trying to start that conversation here.) If my Lady does not make this show I have little reason to watch the Dance/Feast season. (well-written books, just not a lot in there I care about.)
Â 
Â

Â 
Well, if they'd actually do Viking things maybe, but in feast there was some squabbling over the Seastone chair and the revelation of the Dragonhorn, but not much for action. There's so little raving/reaving/general dickishness from the Ironborn in Dance and Feast that I'm pretty sure ratings would dip into cancellation territory if the Ironborn are included.

Â 
If they are included as it is written, I agree.Â 
Â 
I don't see the case for deleting them completely based on that argument though. I can see Damphair getting cut, but the other two I think will still be in. And they won't have all the politicial build up to the Kingsmoot - the Kingsmoot itself will still work if they do it in a greatly reduced format.
Â 
Handled well it will be an excellent dramatic foil for the events at Insanity Landing.

Â 
i can see them including a super reduced Ironborn story but I honestly think it would be a mistake to include all the "Arms of the Kraken" chapters faithfully as other chapters we've gotten so far. Sailing Vic chapters might make for a good filler... but idk how well HBO handles filler.Â
5412	Steve Stark	2014-04-20	Stoneheart will be there, if I had to guess in the final moments of the final episode. There really is no better "wtf cliffhanger" for them to leave everyone on and hook them for the next season. It would give huge shock factor points, and they could make it extremely powerful for a final moment of the season.
Â 
I'm not worried about them cutting her out entirely, because I don't see that happening at all.
Â 
If they did cut her out, which I find highly unlikely, I'd be upset. But I won't goÂ so far as to say that I would stop watching the show, because that would be a lie. It's all I have in regards to ASOIAF until the next book comes out, honestly.

Â 
Exactly. Tbh is always a bit funny to see people going on about cutting stuff because "they're not important" when the books are not finished, so there's not really any way to know what ends up being important or not.Â

5415	sati	2014-04-20	That's just a rumor. It would be so dumb for them to waste such big WTF moment on something other than finale. Besides from the people who saw the ep - no LS.

Also considering the outrage that will happen everywhere after Jaime/Cersei any 'oh my God! what a twist!' thread would probably disappear among the flood of 'they ruined Jaime!' cries.

The A Song of Ice and Fire author answers fan questions about his inspirations for Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, and the villainous Joffrey. He talks about writing strong female characters, and says that if he could play any character it would be the classic hero, Jon Snow.

I will start - Lord Manderley
5418	iheartseverus	2014-04-20	^^ Wouldn't that be great?Â  But, IMO, Manderly is more than a cameo, no?Â  Ironic though, if the person who created Ser-Too-Fat-To-Sit-A-Horse ends up becoming, in the eyes of millions of viewers, Ser-Too-Fat-To-Sit-A-Horse.

Didn't GRRM was meant to have a cameo during the PW, but had to refuse it because he was to busy promoting ADWD? Maybe he can have a (really) small role next season, and what better than a ManderlyÂ
5432	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-20	Alfie Allen has said that he and Yara share scenes together this season so they can't have Ramsay tell her Theon's dead so that she leaves. Far more likely she's captured in the battle at the Dreadfort. The question is more about what happens after that.Â  My assumption is that she stays with Ramsay as a prisoner for the longhaul which will enhance the Theon/Ramsay dynamic by adding another element. Eventually, Theon will come to his senses and find a way to get Yara out and then they'll rejoin Stannis outside Winterfell and you'll have their storylines reset to the book.
I wonder if they could use that dynamic to replace farya? Could be an interesting swap and really play well with the rescue at wf if theon finds a more emotional reason to snap out of reek.

What I saw in an ABC interview today (GRRM is their Person of the Week) is that the scene had to be reshot later from a different perspective, and his cameo didn't fit in anymore.Â  (DIdn't fit in?Â  That was not a pun on anyone's size.Â  Or anything.)Â
5434	Newstar	2014-04-20	She was talking about the mob scene in season 2.
Aidan Gillen suggests no kiss here:http://www.baltimore...0,2039438.story


Â 
That was my sense as well, unless it's just misdirection on Gillen's part.
Â 
There are artful ways of shooting a scene to imply a kiss between Gillen and Turner which don't actually involve the actors kissing, if the writers are concerned about Turner's age, so I don't know that her age is necessarily a bar.
Â 
Taking Gillen at his word, though, it would be very interesting if the show wound up boiling all of the creepiness out of the Petyr/Sansa relationship--no come-ons, no kisses, no inappropriate gestures, etc. etc.--since it seemed to me in the books that the creepiness was kind of the point. On the other hand, the show boiled a lot of the creepiness out of Sansa's relationships with the Hound and Tyrion, so who knows?
Â 
Â 
In what episode do you think this will happen? 4x07 "Mockingbird" or it's too soon?
Â 
I tend to think the snow castle scene has to happen in the same episode as the confrontation/Moon Door bit, to preserve the tension from Lysa spotting them, and I tend to think the Moon Door sequence will be in 4x10. 4x07 will probably have some Eyrie stuff, as the name suggests, but it could just involve the Lysa/Petyr wedding or setting up the various relationships in the Vale (Lady Waynwood, Nestor Royce, etc. etc.).

Grrm was a part of Dany's wedding in the original pilot.
5436	Volverin	2014-04-20	Sophie Turner was 17 when they were shooting season 4. So yeah, I dont think there will be a kiss.
Â 
About the creepiness of the relationship in the book - one must remember GRRM showed us the real world of real medieval "dark ages". And in those times it was normal for girls that young to marry much older men and even have sex with them and give them children. It is creepy from our perspective but if you try to get a feel of those times? Not as much.

Still is today, alas, in some countries.Â  I remember some months back a news story about a man in (country to be unnamed here) who was allowed to marry an 8-year old girl.Â  He raped her to death on their wedding night.Â  Wrong is wrong, creepy is creepy, sickening is sickening.Â  I'm pretty sure we're aware here that we're discussing a fictional world in a fictional story.Â  LOL, we've been discussing GRRM's world, after all, for many long years, day in, day out, long before the HBO series was even thought of.Â  Just sayin'

Underage actors kissing adult actors is not unusual in film and TV.
Â 
I really don't think Gillen's interview means they're changing that.Â  The only conceivable reason to do that would be to make Littlefinger less creepy, which has never been a concern before; if anything, they've made him even more obviously villainous.Â  But from the period after the initial rescue until the kiss/Moon Door stuff, Sansa wonders whether he might actually be more benevolent, so the show may try to lull viewers a bit in that regard.

Â 
I agree. That's why I dont see almost anything creepy with LF flirting with Sansa because these are just the ways of that fictional world.Â 
Â 
So maybe Sansa will kiss LF, hard to tell. They almost raped her so what's wrong with a kiss right?

I think you missed my point by a mile.Â  But, no matter.Â  Not worth discussing.Â 
Â 
The show's about to begin, peeps.Â  Crank up the popcorn machine!
5441	Colonel Green	2014-04-21	I'm pretty sure that talk about Littlefinger being "paternal" was Gillen joking, based on tonight's episode, where he was even handsier than usual (now that he's got his Catelyn doll all to himself).
5442	Impish	2014-04-21	Here's what happens
In King's Landing: Tyrion is taken to a cell, where he is visited by Podrick. Margeary and Olenna discuss their newfound position. Tywin offers Oberyn a spot on the judges' bench. Oberyn participates in an orgy. Cersei and Jaime visit their son in the sept. Sansa escapes with Dontos and meets with Baelish.
Â 
In the Riverlands: Arya and Sandor are taken in and fed, but Sandor just robs the nice family.
Â 
In the North: The wildlings attack a village, where a boy escapes and tells the Night's Watch. Grenn and Edd make it back to the Wall from Craster's Keep. Jon warns (again) of Mance's army. Sam drops Gilly off at Mole's Town.
Â 
At Dragonstone: Stannis and Davos discuss Joffrey's death.
Â 
Across the Narrow Sea: Daenerys arrives at the gates of Meereen, treats with Hizdahr, and lays siege to the city with catapults after Daario defeats the champion.
No Bran or Theon.
Â 
Am I missing anything?


Â 
Â 
Wow did you ever nail it!
5443	zaphodbrx	2014-04-21	Well, like all Stannis fans I am upset about the ongoing portrayal of him on the show.
However while a lot of attention has been brought to that, I feel that people have not discussed Show Davos that much.Â 
This is important to me. I like Stannis, but I like Davos too.
Â 
Show-Davos has stopped making any sense to me over the course of the last season and a half. I can't put my finger on it exactly. The acting is good, the lines are okay, and it's roughly the same character as the book. It's just that the circumstances are so different.
Â 
Nowadays he comes off as the lead henchman of a villain. You know, the ones who say 'You're running out of time!' and 'You have failed me for the last time!' and that type of crap. I can't remember the last time we had an actually good Stannis Davos scene since the one on the boat in Season 2. S3E8 came close, but it was still just so different..
Â 
Consider for the moment, Davos is the Hand of the King. Yet he doesn't have anyone to read and write on his behalf. And he has to turn to.. Shireen. Yes, because she is a main cast member and needs screentime and that makes logic somehow. Not.
Â 
I think the main problem here is the massive cut-out of everyone else in this storyline. Kings Men, Queens men, Justin Massey, Roland Storm, Maester Pylos, Alester Florent, Axell Florent, Sallador Saan, and basically it seems like his entire army at this point is himself, Davos, Mel, his wife and daughter, and 3 random guards.
Â 
Want to have Davos set Gendry free? Well, we cut out all the knights and Saan's Lyseni, so just have Davos mumble some crap about a star and rush him out in a dinghy in a scene that makes no sense and basically leave him to starve or drown.
Â 
Want to show some burning? Well let's cut out all the stuff about Alester and his treasonous behaviour and instead let him burn an 'infidel' , oh and also change the name because who cares.
Â 
And now, Davos is writing a letter to the Iron Bank. In Stannis' name. Behind his back. Making him the Beggar King v2.0 , to beg money, to buy mercenaries cause apparently his own army is all gone by now. ( no wonder, as he keeps burning infidels ) Y'know, the same kind of behaviour that got Alester burnt? Oh wait, Shireen is writing the letter. Yeaaaah...
Â 
Â 
This is all just so messed up.. Stannis had a scribe in season 2 you know. And he can write his own letters. I guess he burnt the scribe by now, for being an infidel.
Â 
Oh, and why would the Iron bank support Stannis exactly? TV Stannis is just some creep who burns infidels. I know some people say that the Iron bank will turn him down instead. So then what? TV Stannis has no money and no army and no ships. And how would it make sense for the Iron bank to support him later on?
Â 
I don't know where they are going with this. But honestly, I feel like they have screwed up Davos' storyline as badly as they have screwed Stannis as well.
Â 
And why exactly does TV-Davos support TV-Stannis at this point? I can't fathom the reason, I really can't.. His son is dead ( which is apparently the only reason he did all the stuff to become a lord ), and let me remind you,Â TV Stannis is just some creep who burns infidels.
Â
5444	AzorAhai42	2014-04-21	So, based on what happened in the scenes at the Wall and the fact that Coldhands seem to be cut out of the show, it seems like the Night's Watch is going to root out the mutineers at Craster's Keep instead of Coldhands?Â 
Â 
To me it seems like the timing for everything will be very tight and close if this is the way they are planning on doing things in the show. Your thoughts?

It also looks like there are injured NW members at Castle Black.

Â 
I'd be floored if Marg wasn't aware of the poisoning; my guess is she knew it was happening but maybe in post is question the wisdom of it. She does bring up an interesting point, because the Show!Tyrells had less of a reason to poison Joff given that Show!Marg controlled him so well.
Â 
Injured NW members are probably Grenn and Ed
5449	Lord Stokeworth	2014-04-16	In the show there was no risk of Marg getting poisoned since they didn't drink from the same cup as in the books. In this case she didn't really have to know.
Â 
Or maybe they're just playing along being in KL and people having spies all over.
5450	Konradsmith	2014-04-16	It is Grenn and Edd. If you watch the video on the HBO website the image quality is better and you can discern their faces more easily.
Â 
Has anyone made imgur screencaps of this promo btw? That would be helpful for more in-depth analysis on all of our parts...

5458	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-17	It also looks like Sam and Gilly are going away before Stannis makes it to the wall? Do you suppose they'll leave Maester Aemon behind?


Â 
I'm guessingÂ that Sam & Gilly areÂ going to get to Mole's Town, find it ransacked by the wilding raiders, maybe collect a few survivors and thenÂ bring them rightÂ back to the Wall so that they canÂ confirm that everything Jon told Allister & co.Â was true.

Â 
According to those who have seen the episode:
Â 

	Spoiler  Sam decides that Castle Black isn't safe for Gilly and the baby due to the upcoming wildling attack and drops them both off in Mole's Town with instructions to the madam there not to whore GIlly out. He is unaware that the wildlings coming from the south are going to decide to ransack Mole's Town on their way to Castle Black. John Bradley did a recent interview where he mentions Sam making bad decisions early in the season based on his cowardice and feelings of inadequacy that he regrets later but ultimately as the season progresses has his most heroic moments. I'm assuming him taking Gilly to Mole's town is the "bad decision" he's referencing.
5460	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-17	Well, in that case I am very worried for Gilly & baby Sam!

Â 
But for how much? Joffrey was really completely out of control during the wedding banquet, and everybody was there to witness.

Yeah I think even given how Margaery knew how to trick him and distract him, it wouldn't be long until he would seriously hurt her.

5463	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-17	That's why I think Margaery was a reluctant participant. I imagine she felt like she could handle Joffrey, and Olenna had to convince her that this plot was for the best, so she's basically telling her grandma, "you better be right."
5464	Warhawk137	2014-04-17	She might have felt like she could handle him, but I think others may know better.Â  She was having more success than anyone else, but, it was still pretty mixed success.Â  Marg is good, but nobody is THAT good.Â  At least Olenna is smart enough to recognize that controlling Joffrey has become... impracticable.

Â 
And leaving Marg's marriage un-consummated has its advantages: if the Lannisters go down, the Tyrells won't have to.

Aside from the advantage of, y'know, not having to bump uglies with Joffrey.
5467	Ser Jake	2014-04-18	I think everyone is missing the bigger picture here... that music in the promo is fucking epic!!! We better hear more of it.
5468	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-19	She might have felt like she could handle him, but I think others may know better.Â  She was having more success than anyone else, but, it was still pretty mixed success.Â  Marg is good, but nobody is THAT good.Â  At least Olenna is smart enough to recognize that controlling Joffrey has become... impracticable.


Yeah, as much control as Marg had over joffreyÂ (like with feeding the poor, which he probably gave the okay for) he's still a loose cannon, who's to say he doesn't royallyÂ fuck things up again like he did with the North.Like Ollena said, her circumstances have really improved. Assuming they stick with the storyline from the book, Tommen is much easier to mold and control.
5469	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-19	All you can interpret from the preview is that Marg wanted to be Queen. Â To say she wasn't in on the plan is reading too much into it. Â Wait for the episode. Â At most right now you can say she was a reluctant participant, which is much more likely.
Â 
Doesn't matter she knows the more manageable Tommen is up for grabs. Â  Marg is a character who wants it so bad that even 2 seconds of not being Queen anymore is going to drive her nuts. It would drive me nuts, too.
5470	Empress In The North	2014-04-19	Reluctant participant.
Â 
You can even kind of see her being a bit disappointed during the wedding at around 4:29:https://www.youtube....ScY2o3rpI#t=269Â It's almost as if she's thinking "Yeah, I suppose it's time for him to go".
Â 
The Tyrells didn't exactly need Joffrey, and they most certainly didn't want an Aerys II situation in which rather hot-headed Loras learns of Joffrey physically abusing his sister followed by him running his sword through Joffrey.

It's funny how Jack Gleeson said that he thinks Joffrey actually had feelings for Maergary. I actually am curious to know how long she would have gone unscratched with him.
5472	Janicia	2014-04-19	To me, the point of Ros' death was to drive home that Margery could NOT have controlled Joffrey. Â He has been escalating, and while he's been on best behavior with Margery so far, she would be in terrible danger as his wife. Â  Â

Jon would be a little early and he had a sort of speechy thing going on already in his "trial".
Dany didn't pull the "I am ....." thing yet much this season, so I guess she is the most likely.

What I really want to know is if they are finally going to introduce Strong Belwas?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Â 
If you folks can all remember the original 7 second sneak peak, there was clearly the rider in front of Mereen taunting Dany. Will Strong Belwas kill him and take a dump on his face, hence honoring the funniest thing to ever happen in ASOIAF, or will they scrap it for this new crappy "Daario?"

Â 
If I were a betting lady I'd say Dany and a "Freeeeeeedom!" speech delivered in ferocious Valyrian, but one could hope it's Stannis. He needs to build up some momentum, even if the Wall charge is what I believe will be the plotted "redemption moment" for his character. The same director for Blackwater is directing that episode, so Stannis better fucking be leading the charge, rein up in front of Jon, and be a sexier, more bloodied and gallant version of "Doctor Livingstone, I presume?"

Also, I read somewhere that Alex Graves said that the (First) Battle of Meereen would be bigger and more expensive than the Sack of Astapor in season 3. Seems a strange decision, but alright.

5487	Le Cygne	2014-04-19	This is very interesting, from the same director, another interview:Â A lot of that comes down to sitting down with Dave and Dan and saying, "What happens in season 6? Because I don't know what I'm doing." And they'll tell you what you're doing. I've had many moments with the actors where I've taken them aside and told them, "This is what happens next season" or even at the end of the whole series. And they'll go, "Oh, thank God you told me that. Now I know how to play it."Â http://www.hitfix.co...freys-wedding/2

5491	King Tommen	2014-04-20	In terms of the portrayal on the show, I think it's pretty clear between Melisandre, Selyse and Stannis who the most "evil" is and Stannis is in a distant 3rd in that race.

Â 
She (like all the critics) has only seen the 1st three episodes. After tonight, everybody is going to be watching the show in real time just like the rest of us.

I highly doubt the speech in the finale would come from Dany based on where she'll be in her story. My vote's for Jon.
5493	Jslay427	2014-04-20	We better see a Stannis!Stannis!Stannis! moment to make up for his use of the word infidel. I cringed hard when he said that.
5494	sati	2014-04-20	In terms of the portrayal on the show, I think it's pretty clear between Melisandre, Selyse and Stannis who the most "evil" is and Stannis is in a distant 3rd in that race.


Â 
I agree. I really don't see how this season is making him look any worse than season 2 where he was responsible for killing Renly - someone TV audience actually knew, than burning some random dude which was even followed by a scene in which it was quite clear this whole thing didn't sit well with Stannis.

Yeah same. The word infidel was just so wrong.Â
5496	sati	2014-04-20	Â 
She (like all the critics) has only seen the 1st three episodes. After tonight, everybody is going to be watching the show in real time just like the rest of us.

Â 
Was the article abut finale speech? I thought they were referring to something in tonight's episode?
5497	iheartseverus	2014-04-20	^^ Yes, tonight's episode.
5498	King Tommen	2014-04-20	Oh, then it's probably Dany. Not sure why so many people here would not want a great speech attributed to her. Much better than a crappy speech.

LF probably isn't going to have his "I was behind everything" monologue until later on this season. I imagine he's just going to take out Dontos, tell Sansa "I'm getting you out of here." and they'll go, leaving the explanation for the next episode.
Â
5499	ovis alba	2014-04-20	I'm fine with Dany having a great speech, I just wonder if I agree on the definition of great speech.
5500	Rashtibram	2014-04-20	I sincerely hope you're wrong,Â King Tommen, and LF's "reveal" speech is in tonight's episode. We've already seen a glimpse of it, and it would be perfect for an episode which will mostly consist of characters reacting to the PW. The Olenna reveal at least needs to be there IMO.
5501	Eleslayer	2014-04-20	Do you think that LF will appear in this night's episode? Because the title of episode nr. 7 is "mockingbird" so I suspect that LF will appear only in that episode, not before..Â
5502	Hath4	2014-04-20	He is in this epiosode.
5503	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-20	LF will certainly deliver his "always keep your enemies confused" speech in this episode. It's the same place it appears in the book.
5504	sati	2014-04-20	I sincerely hope you're wrong,Â King Tommen, and LF's "reveal" speech is in tonight's episode.

Â 
Yeah it does look like he is on the ship when he says that. Perhaps it's indeed in tonight's episode.
5505	King Tommen	2014-04-20	Â

Â 
We'll get something I'm sure but I don't think we're getting the "I've been behind everything since the start" monologue because that's more to do with Lysa's role in it and that won't be until much later.
Â 
I always equate "speech" with one person addressing a large group as opposed to dialogue between two characters so that's why I'm thinking it's Dany because at this point in the story, that's the only thing that fits. Maybe Graves has a different interpretation of "speech" though.
Â
5506	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-20	I interpret it as any extended monologue. I suspect they'll treat it like his "chaos is a ladder" speech from 3x06.

I think tonight it's the 'always keep your foes confused' thing, the Lysa thing I imagine will be in finale.
5508	iheartseverus	2014-04-20	The best speech Dany could give, IMO, is this:
Â 
Â  Drogon.Â  Rhaegal.Â  Viserion.
Â 
That is all.Â  Finally.
Â
5509	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-20	The best speech Dany could give, IMO, is this:
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
That is all.Â  Finally.
Â 
 


Â 
Maybe this is 'the epic speech' that is supposed to occur?
5510	TheBadboy	2014-04-20	Well as opposed to the growing Dany Hatred. 
She already had the best speech in Astapor. Nothing as of yet beats that badass moment.
5511	Clariana	2014-04-20	Yeah same. The word infidel was just so wrong.Â 


Â 
Stannis is a clever man when he used that word he was perfectly aware that several of the most fanatical R'hollerists within his camp were also within earshot, but the word has a double meaning, it can also mean unfaithful/disloyal and this, is how I believe was how he actually meant it to be interpreted by Davos.
5512	Seneti	2014-04-20	"Stan the Man Baratheon, on 20 Apr 2014 - 10:05 AM, said:
Yeah same. The word infidel was just so wrong."
Â 
Â 
Oh for f***'s sake, I wish people would just try to stop putting their cultural views on top of a fictional dialogue in a fictional world, but here we go:
Â 
http://www.oxfordlea...english/infidel
"an offensive way of referring to somebody who does not believe in what the speaker considers to be the true religion"
Nothing more. Nothing less.
Â 
Stannis is not in the US, he's in Westeros, i. e. a fictional universe, where real-world connotations do not apply. And for all the Stannis lovers out there: he did look positively pissed off and unconvinced when he said it, but it does fit the speech patterns of a religious fanatic like Melisandre, who is pulling the strings at this point (and hopefully won't be anymore once we get to ep. 9).
Â 
Move on people.

If you're asking for pirate advice, that's a no-no here.Â  The link is HBO or HBOGO.
5515	Rashtibram	2014-04-20	Yeah, if you don't already know how to pirate shows, you're probably not going to find the answer here.
5516	Volverin	2014-04-20	He only lives once apparently so I guess he saw no harm in asking that question.
5517	ebevan91	2014-04-20	I tend to call it "legally purchasing" just to be on the safe side 
But I don't pirate the show anyways. I just got extremely lucky this year and have HBO On Demand for free from my provider.
