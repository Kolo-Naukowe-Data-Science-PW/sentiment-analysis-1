"Ran",2014-04-20,"nonspoiler discussion of the show goes here for those whove not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion taking each episode as it comesthis topic should open automatically when the show begins airing"
"AryaSansa",2014-04-21,"overall was decentâ didnt like hound stealing or how danaerys loverboy killed the champion â didnt like how they were suddenly in fog when sansa escaped â loved tywins talk as well as shireen though â so when is stannis going to the wallâ it seemed pretty urgent but stannis is taking his sweet time â oh i think the entire danaeyrs plot should be in valyrian â predictions â littlefinger will take sansa to braavos where she will meet aryaâ sam will make out with gilly i hope they show the nude scene for that â also tyrion will somehow survive his ordeal  hes too popular a character to die â and when is yara going to rescue theonâ some plot lines are taking too longâ"
"Raffi lannister",2014-05-08,"i hate the jaimie cercei thing â â but after that it was a good episode"
"Ran",2014-04-06,"have at it edited by ran 06 april 2014  0418 am"
"SeA±or de la Tormenta",2014-04-20,"a strong 8 until daenerys dropped to a 6"
"Stan the Man Baratheon",2014-04-20,"seven seems fair for this ok episode"
"Bloodhair Petyr",2014-04-20,"i think that was the best daenerys scene since drogon rosting the astapori guy overall was good sam was super boring so 9"
"WTFSalami",2014-04-20,"9 that last speech was epic the command that clarke has over that language is so got damn hot"
"tito5601",2014-04-20,"i liked the wildling attack and littlefingers accent changed its creepier noww an 8 for me"
"Lord Godric",2014-04-20,"this episode to me really was on par with last week which to me was good but not great it just lacked the ending â joffreys death is a lot better than a flat dany ending 710â"
"KalibakCruel",2014-04-20,"besides the sam scenes i liked the episode dany didnt bore me to tears like usual i thought they set up things pretty well minuses go to the jaime portrayal that was just bad and to the champion fight anti climatic as hell also new daario still sucks imo and they had a chance to show off some moves and they had him go with the cop out shot instead will have to rewatch before i give a grade though"
"DreamSongs",2014-04-20,"this was one a the few times i was actually happy to see dany and mereen â emilia clarke did a fabulous job â tywin as always was a show stealer â what i really hated was the suggestiveness that the sex in the sept was less than consensual edited by dreamsongs 20 april 2014  0908 pm"
"FNF",2014-04-20,"seven seems fair its a transition episode so i wasnt really expecting anything but i feel like the ending could have been waaaay better it just fell flat on its face"
"Dany's Silver",2014-04-20,"810 but that may change when i rewatch it â i couldnt quite believe it was over so soon"
"darksellsword",2014-04-20,"i gave it a 9 i really liked this episode seemed so short obviously because i was enjoying itmy only pet peeve was wishing daario had of pissed on the champion to make up for strong belwas not taking a shit i think it was a bit of a cop out to be honest"
"Fez",2014-04-20,"810 â it was a solid episode throughout but not much stood out as outstanding either i didnt much like sams scenes but thats about it for my complaints â â except one i dont usually have any issues with the shows production designs but it looked embarrassingly warm and sunny during the wilding raid what happened to winter if it werent the starks words viewers could be forgiven for thinking winter already came and went and now its early summer"
"C0bR",2014-04-20,"710 too much dd butchery to my liking edited by c0br 20 april 2014  0911 pm"
"boojam",2014-04-20,"a strong 9 until danythen a 10emilia can really nail it when she is speaking high valyrianshe was excellent this episodei thought all the dialog was unformly better written this episode edited by boojam 20 april 2014  0912 pm"
"Zman1863",2014-04-20,"there were some good scenes but there were also some bad ones that jaimecersei scene was horrible and made no sense they are too set in their characterizations cersei and tyrion get consistently lightened as characters but when jaime goes through an actual in book transition they are resistant to following through with itâ"
"libertine",2014-04-20,"this one was a 9 for me tyrion  pod tywin  tommen tywin  oberyn littlefinger  sansa all were really great scenes i also liked the ending although the fight could have been a little more entertaining but nevermind it shows that daario is super badass sams scenes sucked a little though"
"TheHouseHB",2014-04-20,"a 10 best episode of the seasonâ"
"Shitmouth the Wise",2014-04-20,"very good episode considering nothing really big happened"
"Ran",2014-04-20,"8 i looked back over my votes for the first three episodes over the previous seasons and this one has had the best results from me yes even outdoing season 1  lord snow got a 7 so kudos to them for a solid start reviewed it in more detail here where i think its fair to say that its actually a fairly elegantly written episode im a sucker for stories with a strong thematic throughline though"
"Darth Pipes",2014-04-20,"810â a solid episode although not even close to the last twoâ at times it felt like the more expositionheavy episodes of season 1â but definitely a number of good scenesi liked tywintommen a lot for instance"
"Montey14",2014-04-20,"they twinoberynâ scene was the best of the episodethe sam scenes were blahhhhi would have liked to have seen the scene where littlefinger tells sansa about the true poisner of geoffryaria scenes were also very blehhhhand too bad they cut out the big eunich"
"RenlyTheOneTrueKing",2014-04-20,"7 i must be like the only one who likes sam liked the new daario except for when he peed littlefinger is so pervy but thats awesome dany was good jon was good not a fan of the jamiecersei scene oberyn still comes off as meh to me tywin is beast as per ush it looks like margaery didnt know of the plot and olenna is awesomely awesome davos is too good for stannis even though i totally ship them also yay shireen in another episode tommen is better like this for me laughed at aryas youre the biggest  to the hound used to love arya series 1 hated her 23 now love her again strange i love pod and liked tyrions wittiness wildling attack was amazing still love tormund i think thats pretty much the episode haha edited by renlytheonetrueking 20 april 2014  0924 pm"
"DreamSongs",2014-04-20,"810 â it was a solid episode throughout but not much stood out as outstanding either i didnt much like sams scenes but thats about it for my complaints â â yeah the sam scenes â the second one wasnt so bad but the first one was hard to get through"
"TheWhiteRabbit",2014-04-20,"i thought it was awesome enjoyed it more than episode 2 actually i feel like theyve finally figured out how to accurately pace each episode if the rest of the episodes are like the first three this season will turn out to be the best by far edited by thewhiterabbit 20 april 2014  0920 pm"
"Baltan",2014-04-20,"a 9 i really cracked at arya and the hound scene with the stew â i actually found myself asking what had davos figured out couldnt relate the bank of braavos loan that early in the story â im not sold into the gilly in mole town story but well she cant be around in the battle of castle black â new daario is ok but not super cool like daario should be total hottie either way â olenna and tywin were superb specially papa lannister educating tommen over a yet not so cold joffrey corpse â except one i dont usually have any issues with the shows production designs but it looked embarrassingly warm and sunny during the wilding raid what happened to winter if it werent the starks words viewers could be forgiven for thinking winter already came and went and now its early summer â where i live in winter if we have a polar wave the polar winds clear up the sky those sunny days are usually the coldest ones â edit spell edited by baltan 20 april 2014  0930 pm"
"Widows_Blood",2014-04-20,"i gave it an 8 only thing i didnt like was the sept scene and i could have gone without the samgilly stuffâ"
"Widows_Blood",2014-04-20,"also i think the pacing is the best its ever been the writing seems to be more confident and everything just flows seamlessly usually the first few episodes are the worst so the fact that i have really enjoyed the episodes thus far should mean good things for later in the seasonâ"
"boojam",2014-04-20,"ran man our perceptions of dany sure differi mean in the books george made her a juggernaut until dancei dont agree with the analysis"
"Jamie Lannister",2014-04-20,"710 the best scene by far was tywin quizzing tommen  that is the right kind of deviation it perfectly established the kind of thoughtful positive counterpart tommen will be to joff and dance killed it as usual excellent scene â shame it was followed by uh that edited by jamie lannister 20 april 2014  0922 pm"
"Batavian",2014-04-20,"i gave it a 5 mainly for the silliness in front of meereen"
"Ran",2014-04-20,"boojameh juggernaut shes stuck besieging the place for a good long stretch almost gets killed and discovers one of her most trusted advisors has been selling her out shes not that much of a juggernaut in asos"
"Bonifer Tasty",2014-04-20,"i liked the cerseijaime scene in teh sept but it was definitely creepy â was really excited to see sansa reunite with littlefinger but the scene ended up flat for menot sure why â and why did he throw the necklace into the boat with dontos â doesnt sansa still have the hairnet in the book  seems like that could be important â i really thought margaery might be in on the poisoning but this made it seem like she didnt know at all â sam scenes were boringwe know you love her just get on with it â also not sure im going to like the trip up to rout out the craster rebelsseems unnecessarily risky â i gave it a six maybe i should change it to a seven"
"shiola",2014-04-20,"i give it a 6 until i rewatch it â the dialogue wasnt engaging in most of the scenes â a lot of the acting felt kind of off â the way jaime was handled really really bothered me â new daario just doesnt work for me so far â margaery not being involved in the murder was disappointing to me â the good things seeing grenn again â the episode actually managing to shock me with the scene of the wildling massacre â the houndarya are a pleasure to watch â cersei in the very beginning of the episode was good â eta was gonna give it a 5 but i bumped it up to a 6 for shireen3 edited by shiola 20 april 2014  0947 pm"
"Sir Dominus",2014-04-20,"solid 8 from me"
"shiola",2014-04-20,"forgot to mention that i hate with every inch of my being the tv version of littlefinger â i can hardly stomach his stupid skeevy breathy voice â to me theres nothing compelling or interesting or intelligent about him at all"
"Ser Creighton",2014-04-20,"6 it was ok nothing stood out except i felt the acting was a bit over the top all around it felt more melodramatic than dramatic to me oberyn keeps doing the same thing raise chin stare cock head to the side a bit make a quip not really sure if that was stannis panic but he never seems to have the answer to anything dink is pushing his accent to hard its like he is speaking to children all the time sort of incest rape a lot of sam not doing much a little of jon being broody but not much else the wildlings i am going to eat mommy and daddy yes i know your so bad and scary you cant act but so scary really oh god and little finger elongating every word he could speaking of bad acting tywin and tommen what was that it was like some dark version of school house rocks arya and the hound came off almost like a comedy schtick to me meet the odd couple i thought the gate to meereen was the best part in terms of production and melodrama dany has always been a bit melodramatic so fit right in with her drama or soap opera can be a fine line at times i dont think dd would know a fine line if they tripped over it probably hit it with a sledge hammer like most things if they did i dont mind the changes or anything just thought the acting themes and plot were a bit off tonight and i didnt find much interesting in the episode"

"ohpooratlas",2014-04-20,"was kind of a flat episode for me until the siege of meereenâ that brought it up to a 7 forâ me â episode needed more creepy littlefinger"
"Daenerys Must Die",2014-04-20,"8 on par with the last few weeks and pacing was good felt it ramping up to the ending bits â tyrionpod 2nd half of aryasandor nights watch stuff samgilly felt like it dragged along but what can ya do tywintommen conversation  very socratesesque as a friend of mine pointed out mereen  just the scope of it felt very grand compared to seasons past and i enjoyed that despite my not being the biggest fan of that story edit how could i forget dontossansalf  seems well get more into the necklace next week â all highlights for me â will save the cons for nitpicking thread edited by daenerys must die 20 april 2014  1000 pm"

"P. frontalis chiripepe",2014-04-20,"i really liked this episode there was a few cheesy parts like when grey worm mormont and barristem all took turns asking to fight the lone warrier and then each took on a puppydog face when dany turned them down but overall great episode and ill have to watch it again to be sure but it might be my favorite of the 3 so far"

"Beric175",2014-04-21,"i gave it an 8 because of the jaimecersei scene not sitting all too well with me and because i do not yet see what theyre setting up with gilly other than that superb acting and dialogue and the last scene made me feel that the new daario is a nice compromise between the one from episode 1 of this season and the one from last season keep writing him like that dd please lots of great speeches in the episode"

"Aeva Demetre",2014-04-21,"i feel the redeeming scenes included how masterfully they depicted cersei feeling extremely threatened and almost trapped daario killing the champion from meereen and the hounds rather accurate advice to arya after stealing the farmers silver â jaime and cersei the rape scene i mean this woman is the only one mourning the loss of her child and after listening to her father insult her dead child and display his powers of manipulation using her other son and effectively the ruler she is raped by the only person she trusts and cares for otherwise right next to her dead sons corpse i mean damn â daario was just plain awesome the way he stood there waiting after winking at dany waiting lol thinking of the best way to kiss that knife look sexy and glance at dany at the same time then in two seconds he finishes off the arrogant champion swag â that bit where the hound blew his nose was a bit gross haha but he was on point with his later advice to arya after stealing the silver weak people arent going to survive let alone through winter i really began to like and pity the farmer and his little daughter they were kind and trusting it was difficult to hear the hounds reasoning afterward but it was so distressingly true it felt like a necessary juxtaposition to have someone who has harnessed strength from past suffering and who has a greater likelihood of survival and others who have good intentions but likely wont make it much further in a world full of strife â the rest of the episode was pretty good but these scenes stood out to me edited by aeva demetre 21 april 2014  0350 am"

"Awale",2014-04-21,"4 for me i slightly liked the dany scene but i see what you mean about how theyve turned her into this one note character that keeps giving off these speeches belwas will be missed but naharis  brown haired naharis did good i salute â im surprised so many people love the wildling scene it was bad ass in its own odd way but as a book reader knowing what the thenns are really like and what the magnar of thenn styr is really like its painful watching them being degraded into wild savage cannibals arent the thenns in the books supposed to stand out amongst the wildlings because theyre much more civilized than most free folk  â jaime raping cersei was painful to watch i mean what hell dd â i just didnt like this episode mereen looked amazing btw though if they have enough money to pull those kinds of environments off why didnt they just go all the way and make the pyramids colourful or give the mereenese their insane hairstyles â ahh i maybe give it a 5 at best all in all"

"NaarioDaharis",2014-04-21,"sansas escape  8â along with picking up at the purple wedding and joffreys little lifeless corpse again the lack of panic and disorder mainly due to lack of shots of the wedding party made everything feel off tywin shouted at no one as if the orders of no one leaves at this point could be followed the awkwardness of kingsguard extras standing stupidly in the background tyrion being carted away awkwardly at the behest of an obviously deranged cersei felt stupid sansa and dontos escape was rushed but i enjoyed it people complain about lfs voice yea its annoying i dont know why hes talking like that but we im glad to see him back margaery  olenna  4â i honestly pretty much forgot this scene already the sept of baelor  7the tywintommen bit had a point but it went on too long and was boring jaime didnt rape cersei she went along with it but also was conflicted because of the locale yea she was saying not here but she didnt quite fight him with determination she was conflicted i think they should have kept it more clearly by the book how strong this scene would have been if they hadnt made jaime arrive three episodes early arya  the hound  5â im not enjoying arya this season im seeing the actress coming through the acting and it takes me out shes made herself too much of a joke with the audience outside of the show and its bleeding into her performance shes the cute little girl who is also a badass the hounds winter lesson was a good darkening of the character but somewhat out of character unless he is beginning to despair for some reason but they havent set anything up for that so it just appears like sloppy writing sam  gilly  2â boring as seven hells should have stopped with the and what about you line sam is a very annoying character when he is being wimpy and since hes back basically a season too early at the wall they have to give his character filler crap to do which hurts the character was a big waste of uninteresting time for this not too exciting episode it drugâ dragonstone  2â i honestly forgot most of this already why isnt he at the wall even my unsullied family members were like whats he doing the poor choices the writers have made with the timeline is basically turning the rest of this season into a damn spoiler fest until the stupid attack on the wall can finally happen which just has to wait until episode 9 for some dumb reason when it could have happened this episode the first attack from the south but again theyve brought alister and janos back too early so now they have to do some stupid crap with them ugh filler fest the brothel  4â im a major major major fan of the viper first theyve cut the nickname and his affinity for poisons and made it into a stupid exposition line for tywin to bring up that cuts like half the character too much hey we like sex as people have already said the point of him coming to kl was to be on the small council but they changed it in the show to just attending the wedding which seems a little stupid why would tywin bribe him with basically nothing that the viper cares about excluding gregor why would the viper want a seat on the stupid small council that would be the most boring thing to him why would he want to help the lannisters at all gahh just so much dumb im waiting to see where they are taking this arc before i judge it too harshly having tywin promise gregor takes away so much of the characters drive and motivation tyrion  pod  4â stupid whitewashing of tyrion and bronn now pod has a more graceful exit from his service so that is ok i forgot most everything else that happened in this scene as well the wildling attack  1â the horselords took your land burn every village are teh wildlings bad guys mum im not sure oh cannibalism is bad so yes tehy are bad too yayyyyy castle black  2â what happened oh filler attack crasters camp what arent the wildlings like just about to attack your damn wall with 100k men didnt you just say being drawn out was a stupid idea now you want to march towards the main host to kill a bunch of people who have useless information such poorly contrived filler and why is everyone listening to jon now i figured since thorne hates him he would like not listen to him but yea something happened lets ask snows advice he probably knows whats best hes like 20 years old now daenerys  4â yeaaa again just a bit wut march that close up to the enemy gates why would the meereneese allow you to do that thats a pretty tight little pass you just marched your army through woulda been a great place for an ambush or for say 300 uber warriors to make a stand so that the overwhelming numbers of your army are nullified glad to get some more of captain expo ser jorah spouting off amazing lines like he is a hero of meereen oh ok i would never have gotten that poor mans daario is poor mans daario its like his understudy is playing him the placement of the fight was just awkward as hell and its obvious the daario actor has no physical training the whole chains thing would have been cool if dany didnt have a cool switcheroo move to pull every single time she ran into an enemy ever its predictable and expected at this point i dont have a calculator so overall like a 5 i guess still gonna watch it again just cause i love got so much"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2014-04-21,"that part truly was a huge mistake im disappointed â i rewatched the scene and it was more obvious to me that it was partly consentual but the way it ended was weird just have cersei look somewhat into it if a little conflicted rather than an ambiguous zoomed in tug of jaimes clothes i think too many will focus on it though and its a shame because the episode was really well written and there was clear direction and purpose to every scene"

"Cyvasse Khal",2014-04-23,"a 5 for me i expected a fallout from a big event episode to be a bit of a come down but there was a few extra bits that wasnt working for me either â negative  jaimecersei rape scene was terribly handled and not how it is supposed to or should have gone down discussed at length in another topic so dont need to get into it  the samgilly scenes were crap quite frankly  stannisdavos was not that riveting and unless youve read the books i think davos realising to use the iron bank to help stannis cause would have gone over a lot of peoples heads the not enough men to raid a pantry line was great though finally more of stannis dry wit and davos general grumpyness when he first starts his reading lesson was funny but not enough to save those scenes  never thought id say this but too much tywin talking this week great they brought tommen straight into it but that tywin lesson about what makes a great king went for too long especially considering he had another long but more necessary convo with oberyn laterâ  dany please stop trying to make everything she does epic dd that catapulting the broken chains thing was lame â positive  houndarya knowing that not much happens with these two until arya leaves for braavos was a bit of a concern coming into this season but once again just really funny stuff the way maisie delivered that line of you are the biggest shit in westeros was just amazing could watch these two all day  wildings raid and warning to nights watch brutal and just what we needed to realise they need to be taken seriously so we are invested in the upcoming battle at castle black  tyrionpod that was a sweet scene"

"grumdin",2014-04-23,"â may i ask what you hated so much about true detective ive seen a lot of excellent tv as some would say like the wire the sopranos deadwood etc and i honestly thought the first four episodes were some of the most flawless tv ive ever seen in my life and normally im a very critical person when it comes to tv and films also even if you didnt like the storyline or pacing i find it hard to believe anyone thats watched both game of thrones and true detective especially the six minute longtake in episode 4 can say game of thrones is better directed cary fukunaga the director of all of true detectives first season is leagues better than any director on game of thrones imho â  the show steadily started losing steam and brilliance in episodes 5 and 6 and episodes 7 and 8 were pieces of shit in my opinion at least compared to the first half the season but the first half is incredible beyond just about anything ive seen on tv the first half of true detective was some of the best film making ive seen on any media in years the last episode was risible dog shit which is 100 the fault of the writers and producers so compaing to got whats the issue well for me its how boringly safe the direction is it doesnt look right for a start the costumes are all wrong theyre swanning around in suits and dresses with modern cuts and materials the scenes are poorly directed overall poor use of close ups everything shot in medium frame with apparently unmoveable cameras yes mr direcor were watching a tv show as you will never let us forget it where are the risks where is the desire to dirve the show forward at a decent narriative pace they will have the biggest budget of any tv show i reckon and yes they have a big cast but attempting to bring some art into the most important part of film making should not be an issue of money"

"ovis alba",2014-04-23,"i think a main problem of the episode is that it deals with a lot of stuff either after an important event or leading up to another big event its a lot of people getting ready for something or discussing what just happened and not much that stands on its own thats basically what i got from everyone i talked to bookreader or not you feel a lot of stuff is getting planned but you sort of wait all episode for things to get going and although danys scene actually has stuff going on its still her getting ready to take the city so that even ends with somthing like that this in combination with an episode right before which turned a lot of things around makes it sort of a filler which is not really bad but just doesnt have that big impression to people"

"Modesty Lannister",2014-04-26,"a question about the scene why does joffrey have stones on his eyes cant remember what the books say about that could anyone inform me of thisâ ser desmond wines bane explained it but id add the idea was taken from the romans who put coins over eyes of the dead so that they can pay a fare for being ferried over the river styx to the underworld what i find a bit inconsistent with the world grrm created is the choice of eyes painted on stones this would make more sense in old gods religion with faces on weirwood trees but in the end â<U+0080> its ok thats how dd see it"
"Black Wolf Smith",2014-04-26,"black wolf smith  if people dropped the tone of pcinduced faux outrage at the butchering of saint jaime they might realise that the way the scene played out was in context to the changing of the sexual power dynamic of the two characters which has been going on for episodes now without anyone mentioning it but i moaned about that at the time and have learned to live with it i do believe that the low ratings this ep has been getting which is far superior to last weeks is mostly down to that one scene â show jaime doesnt know about the others not sure if any of them have happened on the show but this is suppose to be a turning point for both of them i agree the power dynamic between has been slowly turning from this point on jaime doesnt see her the same way sex is only a small part of it â i believe that this show tied 31 w the highest ratings mostâ on hbo since the sopranos final"
"The Killer Snark",2014-04-26,"its been getting low ratings here though i joined this site about a year and a half ago and ive never rated an episode with less than 7 and its taken a fair amount of nitpickings for me to get that low to an extent though im always dubious about changes to the source occasionally some of the larger ones are improvements the daenarys story arc in season 2 is dramatically stronger than it is in acok and im willing to suspend my own biases on occasion when i think an episode would work for me much better if i hadnt read the books so certain leeway has to be made for nonreaders the one thing which i am concerned about is that nonreaders might be getting made to feel too much sympathy at this stage for cersei because the way shes being presented now is going to clash with how she is in affc which is pretty much how shes always been in the novels it wont seem narratively consistent but to approach what must be seen on the show as a more gradual sinking into evil and insanity is going to undermine just how entertaining her pantomime battiness really is"

"nara",2014-04-20,"â having said that i do have to agree that the jaimecersei sept scene was just cringeinducing probably the sole negative aspect of the episode for me made even worse by the fact that cogman confirmed that it was intended to look 100 consensual if that is what the showrunners believe is consensual sex i think they have a very warped perspective on sexâ â â about tommens age and his marriage to margaery â did anyone notice that as tywin and tommen were walking away tywin was telling tommen about the need to marry and continue the family line â the rest of the conversation went like this â tywin to continue the family line do you know how that happens tommen yes tywin has anyone explained the details to you tommen i dont think so tywin its all relatively straightforward â hmmm sansa and tyrion never wound up consummating their marriage either but tywin giving tommen the talk i wonder â tv tommen isinteresting despite being older he still seems easily manipulated by tywinalthough to be fair tywin was not wrong in anything that he said â the moment they aged up tommen i started to wonder if he would consummate the marriage to margâ this convo supported that idea â well i dont know why everybody is so upseted about jaimiecersei sex scene it was not rape in the book he finds her alone with joffs body and takes her right there while she says stop jaimie please not here not nowâ whats the difference if that was rape so it was in the books the problem i see is that book cersei doesnt care about it she just accept the rape thing so she can control others just like happens with one of the kettleblacks â in the book she says no kind of feebly but then gives in to their passionsâ here she was saying no the whole time â okay clearly like most people i was disturbed by the jaimecersei sept scene which i confess i liked in the booksâ it did feel rapey and the only reasons for it that i can think are 1 to make jaime less sympathetic because he had become so in season 3 and 2 to push off jaimebrienne shippers because there is no way brienne can end up with a man who raped his sisterâ he has paid the price for bran with his hand but this was nuts â i also think they felt that they made the hound too funny and nice so they had him steal the silver to keep him grey â love the new tommenâ unlike joff he actually looks like he could be jaimes sonâ i liked the convo with tywin but i thought it strange that tywin would be so insensitive to cerseiâ this is the man who didnt want her to know that that tyrells had rejected the marriage between her and willasâ it looks like they are setting up for a break between tywin and cersei â i liked new daario especially his naked woman hilted dagger  which i thought was a nice detail from the books and i thought this was a reasonable way to continue the danydaario relationshipâ i thought they could have drawn out his fight a little moreâ random thought during the pissing match the thought popped into my head i wonder if the actors were told to come to the set with their bladders fullâ â i thought sansas escape was fine but yeah how did it suddenly become darkâ â when lf told her to call him petyr i was immediately grossed outâ also i get that shes a tall actress but somehow hes less scary when hes so much shorter than herâ can they not put some lifts in his shoes â wildling attack was great and well doneâ loved that ygritte shot the first arrowâ another example of them greying a character that had become too sympatheticâ same with jon suggesting that going after the mutineers was more important that protecting the smallfolk who were being attackedâ starting to see signs of the lord commander who forced gilly to leave her child"

"The Human Abstract",2014-04-21,"â i think that ship has sailed â although i do think the writers will coursecorrect around the end of the season with tyrions character there were complaints about arya and tywin being whitewashed in season 2 and the writers have coursecorrected since im not too too concerned at this point although ill be the first to raise hell if tyrion doesnt kill tywin and shae as he did in the books â calling it coursecorrect is probably a nice way of putting it â the show is just primarily interested in shock value rather than in love with its nuanced characters â â its why its necessary to open yet another oberyn dialog today with an edgy sex scene â its why jamie appears to be working towards deceny one episode and is raping someone the next â its why the wildlings are suddenly murderous star trek villains â its why the red wedding was made to be more unexpected and more heartbreaking â â when they have tyrion murder shae it wont be some attempt to fix his character the way it should be â the show could not give two shits about correcting tyrions character â its all just about setting up the next shocking blindside that will get people talking about the show â even better if tyrion appears like a great human being before being thrown into a murderous rage â more shocking that way edited by the human abstract 21 april 2014  0118 am"

"MizasterJ",2014-04-21,"my thoughts on last nights episode of game of thrones season 4 ep 3 very minor spoilers good opening scene w sansa just how i pictured it interesting how neither sansa nor littlefinger mentioned tyrion even though they didnt say amethyst im still happy they used the term the strangler they actually handled the aftermath of joffs death really well maybe even better than the book marg was def in on it its noteworthy that her grandmother never mentioned littlefinger or the ramifications the murder had on tyrion varys oddly absent bronn i cant help but wonder if he is part of an upcoming plot w shae in the book cersei didnt resist jaime nearly as much i guess they are trying to appeal to the female audience but cersei is supposed to be a horrible person and jaime is still a sleaze at best weak to his own indulgences so now hbo has officially ruined oberyn despite that his scene w tywin was an added bonus i love that they addressed how much he knows about poison and that he could have been but most likely was not the culprit side note charles dance is a superb actor more stannis why nothings happening no mel this time so we learn that the reason he hasnt gone to the wall yet is due to him not having enough ships interesting that they mentioned braavos and the golden companywhere is this going wildlings  the thenns are legit badass dany this new daario fails to impress me would have been the perfect opportunity to introduce strong belwas arya the hounds burn marks or lack there of in this season is really bothering meâ i wish her story would move forward im betting the hound will be ambushed fairly good episode but not dragon level good i give it a 610"

"brave  danny flint",2014-04-23,"after a long hard look at this episode ive watched it four times ive come to the conclusion that the sexual violence portrayed in that scene was just as terrible as some of the other violence in that episode  for instance the despicable filth the thenn told that poor little boy â also disturbing was seeing ygritte slaughter men women and children â and of course it was heartbreaking to see that beautiful little girl make rabbit stew for arya and the hound with a kind pious but admittedly someone not as robust as the hound praying for the gods blessingâ â the gods dont give a fuck â at least the gods of the seven it seems to me â my opinion of showjaime might be beyond repair â it is just so completely out of character for him that it twists the viewers perception of him irreparably â before he was on a path of redemption  with this act of sexual violence he has sullied his new chance to be good and honorable â sure the timing also made this act a possibility  she had just asked him to kill tyrion whom he loves and she was definitely giving him yesno responses  but it served no good purpose in the end i promise everyone that â benioffweiss will take a lot of flak for this esp from feminist groups â â george himself is unhappy about it although he phrased his response delicately â i am not sure how much of this stuff has been covered but im sorry i couldnt read 36 pages â random â  i liked how ser dontos told sansa youre stronger than you know  it was a nice echo to jojen reed telling summerbran in cok that the grey wolf is stronger than he knows â  how creepy was it when littlefingers arms descended from the top of the ship without being able to see the head from sansas angle and she was suddenly lifted up and over into his arms â i thought that was a delightfully visually symbolic shot rich in meaning â  i actually thought the arrival at meereen was really cool in no small part due to ramin djawadis brilliant song composition â this is a new theme  well probably be hearing it a lot throughout the next couple of seasons â meereen itself looks really beautiful actually â it looks like a city daenerys targaryen would rule over from a high pyramid â what does everyone else think â  the fight between daario and pahl was pretty good  since im not a fan of violence i like how it was sort of quick and short but really clever too â his wink at her was charming too â lets hope he gets sexier as the season goes along â but then im sure emilia coupling with any man makes it highoctane sexy â  the scene with tywin educating tommen was actually really thrilling to me for some reason â i have no idea why but i really liked it when tommen finally got that wisdom was a kings most important quality the way charles dance said yes just made me squee a littleâ â their acting is just so great â â  i have come to love lena headeys acting with all my heart she is cersei now"

"digiFemme",2014-04-27,"â what especially irritates me is that they seem to think that a female character will only be more likable if shes stripped of any agency and power and portrayed as a victim instead of someone who makes her own choices â i hate when people say that showcersei is more complex than bookcersei or that bookcersei is onedimensional no she is not bookcersei is a villain and shes also been a victim as a woman she had no choice in who she was going to marry married off to a stranger as a broodmare in political marriage sexually and physically abused by robert but shes also an unrepentant murderer and abuser herself and has no empathy for people who are in a similar position as she is she can be hateful pitiable unintentionally and sometimes even intentionally funny â but what i like about bookcersei is that she makes her own choices she wasnt able to decide who she would marry but she chooses whose children shell have she doesnt try to be a good wife to robert who is a bad husband to her she aborts his baby instead of some sob story in which she lost her baby and then it all went bad she actually made a choice she commits murders herself and isnt just joffreys powerless mother who whines that she cant control him it usually doesnt seem like she even tries to control him she has sex with her brother in the sept next to her dead sons body because she chooses to because shes as hungry for him as he is for her grrm about the book scene she never felt guilty about her sexual relationship with her twin brother as she does in the show which shes been having since they were kids she was just worried about getting caught â why does cersei have to what dd see as likable why cant she be a strong interesting villainantagonistcharacter who makes her choices and does what she wants people enjoy male villains who are ruthless and make their choices and do what they want why cant there be a female villain who does just that â furthermore why does she have to be initially in love with her husband that she never chose or try to be a good wife to him or wonder if they ever had a chance unpopular opinion i always disliked that cerseirobert scene because i found it ooc for her and incongruous with the rest of their interactions in the show not just the book whats dds obsession with making every female character try to be a good wifetry to give a chance to a bad marriage even if they dont in the book why is that required to make a character more likable why change the abortion to stillbirth  to make her more likable in the eyes of the antiabortionists i guess we should be relieved that they didnt make her relationship with jaime all about jaime raping her in order for her to be more likable to the moral brigade viewers â â your views on cersei are similar to mine unfortunately plenty of people dont seem to get that a character can be both a victim and a villain there are monsters like ramsay and the mountain who are worse than cersei is and there are characters like jaime and the hound in the other end she probably fits somewhere in between along with littlefinger stannis and mel but not in the same level i also dislike it when people say that her portrayal in the books is sexist simply because she isnt as sympathetic as her show counterpart where does this come from as if having a nasty female character is an injustice when there are plenty of male characters far worse and even less developed â i think what makes cerseis arc an interesting read is how irrational she is her nastiness wasnt what made her actions frustrating for me nor was her ambition being ambitious isnt a bad thing for any person nor was it presented in a bad light in the story as seen through characters like dany asha etc it was her irrationality and fears which led her to do things which hurt not only others but herself i saw it in the beginning when lady was executed while i understand a mothers wanting punishment on behalf of her son they didnt even get the right direwolf the one who bit joff was still out there forming her own pack and presumably biting anyone she pleased but cersei acted like ladys death was a small victory when logically she ought to have been angry that the real culprit got away â later she got paranoid that the tyrells were out to usurp her family but forming alliances through marriage was a way of life in westeros  even tywin knew and valued its importance as a woman the only way to prevent this is to change the system which i presume is what dany is trying to do but cerseis method was to remove any queen her sons married and thereby lose whatever allies her family had when joffrey was poisoned she thought tyrion was to blame when it wasnt why would he be stupid enough to commit regicide at the very gathering where he was mocked by the king not to mention the exact moment when he held the poisoned cup â when tywin was killed later on she thought it was the tyrells never mind that she was shown the exact passageway and cubby hole that only a certain person of short stature who just escaped could fit in but no its the tyrells later at a meeting when they are finally discussing someone she ought to be paranoid about dany and the dragons shes not paying attention and only thinks to eliminate margaeryâ â thats whats frustrating and fascinating about her character arc her lack of logicâ i actually like show cersei and dont mind how they softened her up but they seem to have gone overboard in making her a victim with this latest episode hopefully theyre not going to make her descent a simple result of being jaimes victim its way too simple â â â its not like they only do it with cersei who is a villain  theyve systematically stripped sansa of even those moments of agency and stuff she actively does that she has in the books â thats of course if the rape is supposed to make the viewers sorry for cersei maybe they wanted us to think that she deserved it which is even worse ok maybe its unfair to accuse them of that but it sucks when you have to choose between two sexist explanations â i feel that the show runners have good intentions but the results are sometimes lacking and not thought about enough they present tyrion as too much of a good guy where all the scenes which are supposed to focus on other characters become about him like when sansa finds out about her familys murder at the rw it was supposed to have been about her but something about how they filmed it made it seem like tyrion was the victim he got hurt by tywin and now sansa turns away from him then now we have this scene with cersei and jaimes characterization is affected the thing is that i find all these characters fascinating but i wish the treatment were equal cersei and tyrions actors may get top billing but we are talking about an endgame in got and plenty of other character have important things going on in their own arcs that get stripped away â"

"LMR",2014-05-04,"re her relationship or lack thereof to rheagar if i recall correctly is barely mentioned in the show so that could well explain why they attributed that initial affection to robert in the the show whilst i agree there are significant differences between bookcersei and showcersei i think i get why they were do and i do think in some cases these changes are as much about how influencing how we percieve the characters around her or rather how the show runners want us to percieve them her interaction with robert has a humanising affect on him as well as her and given the more limited scope of the show manages to convey a significant amount about the leanna back story ie why he went to war in a very condensed wayâ it also made both robert and cersei seem more nuanced i genuinly believed in that scene that this was a couple that had essentially been waging cold war on each other for years and were having a moment of recognition about how they got there it might fudge it a bit but i still feel it captures the essence of their marriage in that senseâ a lot of cerseis complexity in the book would have been tough to convey on screen and the changes for screen mean that she veers away from one dimensional cartoon villain which is always a possibility when you try and convey someone as unpleasant as cersei on screen i also think because they aged joffery up in the show by transferring a lot of her misdeeds to him they were more able to put across his character and by making even cersei appalled by much of it it had the desired effect i feel"

"Talking Hodor",2014-06-04,"i cant believe everyone interprets that as a rape sceneâ im quite sure the queen regent of the seven kingdoms is able to shout loud enough to get a kingsguards attention if she were really getting rapedâ she was emotionally conflicted about the deed and jaime was definitely coming on strong but it was more akin to a james bond sex scene â every time they have sex in the series it starts out with cersei not exactly giving inâ they just both like a little force to get the juices flowing"
"We Pay Our Debts",2014-06-15,"â what especially irritates me is that they seem to think that a female character will only be more likable if shes stripped of any agency and power and portrayed as a victim instead of someone who makes her own choices â i hate when people say that showcersei is more complex than bookcersei or that bookcersei is onedimensional no she is not bookcersei is a villain and shes also been a victim as a woman she had no choice in who she was going to marry married off to a stranger as a broodmare in political marriage sexually and physically abused by robert but shes also an unrepentant murderer and abuser herself and has no empathy for people who are in a similar position as she is she can be hateful pitiable unintentionally and sometimes even intentionally funny â but what i like about bookcersei is that she makes her own choices she wasnt able to decide who she would marry but she chooses whose children shell have she doesnt try to be a good wife to robert who is a bad husband to her she aborts his baby instead of some sob story in which she lost her baby and then it all went bad she actually made a choice she commits murders herself and isnt just joffreys powerless mother who whines that she cant control him it usually doesnt seem like she even tries to control him she has sex with her brother in the sept next to her dead sons body because she chooses to because shes as hungry for him as he is for her grrm about the book scene she never felt guilty about her sexual relationship with her twin brother as she does in the show which shes been having since they were kids she was just worried about getting caught â why does cersei have to what dd see as likable why cant she be a strong interesting villainantagonistcharacter who makes her choices and does what she wants people enjoy male villains who are ruthless and make their choices and do what they want why cant there be a female villain who does just that â furthermore why does she have to be initially in love with her husband that she never chose or try to be a good wife to him or wonder if they ever had a chance unpopular opinion i always disliked that cerseirobert scene because i found it ooc for her and incongruous with the rest of their interactions in the show not just the book whats dds obsession with making every female character try to be a good wifetry to give a chance to a bad marriage even if they dont in the book why is that required to make a character more likable why change the abortion to stillbirth  to make her more likable in the eyes of the antiabortionists i guess we should be relieved that they didnt make her relationship with jaime all about jaime raping her in order for her to be more likable to the moral brigade viewers â its not like they only do it with cersei who is a villain  theyve systematically stripped sansa of even those moments of agency and stuff she actively does that she has in the books â thats of course if the rape is supposed to make the viewers sorry for cersei maybe they wanted us to think that she deserved it which is even worse ok maybe its unfair to accuse them of that but it sucks when you have to choose between two sexist explanations â i agree they completely declawed cersei and i hate it in the books cersei did actually have control over joffrey for the most part but in the show shes just another poor female victim of evil overthetop showjoffrey it seems as if the writers want to make every woman more sympathetic and weak really coughcatelyncough"

"SlowLoras",2014-05-01,"im gonna chime in her and say that a lot of clarkes duff performances imo can be attributed in part to the writers making danaerys a onenote character â back in s1 clarke played dany beautifully  a scared young girl being sold off to a man she knew nothing about by her brother whom she trusted imo she did a great job  i bought danys fear and discomfort and her growing confidence as she won drogos love and respect there were facets to danaeryss character and while clarkes not exactly laurence olivier she did a fine job of bringing those facets to life â roll on the next two seasons and danys been reduced to a single set of characteristics defiant speechifying khaleesi even when her dragons are stolen theres precious little fear or concern but a whole lot of where are my dragons  laughable scriptwriting imo and it gives emilia very little to work with shes given a lot of bold speeches and quirked eyebrows but no heart  soul its almost as if the writers dont know how to make danaerys a person â you could argue that a better actor might be able to make all of this work and you may well be right  but look at aiden gillen he was phenomenal in the wire  clearly this man can act and in fact s1 littlefinger was fantastic imo especially his exchanges with varys lately hes become a comic book villain complete with batvoice spouting out great lumps of exposition every time hes onscreen hes a good actor i wont be convinced otherwiseâ because ive seen him pull off superb performances in other roles so whys he so bad all of a sudden â contrast kit harington who was good in s1 imo and onoff in s2  s3  his better scenes in the latter series were the ones where jon actually got to do something instead of trudge about in the snow the bear and the maiden fair is a good example of this  the scenes where hes flirting with ygritte where he tells her the wildlings cant possibly win  those were wellacted wellwritten scenes in s4 so far hes been consistently good again imo  and i do believe that this is partly because hes got something to work with theyve written jon as a character not as a cardboard cutout â im not pretending emilias the best actress in the world  shes clearly not but neither is she the worst i think shes a perfectly adequate actress struggling with some duff material and writers who cant write danaerys convincingly"

"Tadco26",2014-04-25,"i dont see a reason why they should not have portrayed littlefinger in a sympathetic nonthreatening way after season 1 in the book littlefingers betrayal of ned comes off more funny then evil i told you not to trust me you know is no threatening line what did ned expect installing stannis as king would have meant the end of his career andor his head pretty much any ambitious politician would have behaved like littlefinger in this situationâ it would have been easy enough to portray littlefinger as a funny nonthreatening guy who is mostly friends with good and bad guys alike he should only become really threatening this season when people begin to realize what this guy can pull off while feigning to be nonthreatening and likableâ they pretty much butchered the whole characterâ 1 littlefinger is no pimp he is a businessman investing in brothels he does not spend his leisurework hours there his brothel is not the treasury and he does not personally train educate or oversee his whoresâ 2 littlefinger does not appear threatening or allow anyone to realizededuce where his true interests lie he acts carefully through agents dontos lothor brune the kettleblacks and does not approach his targets directly sansaâ 3 littlefinger never threatens or antagonizes anyone openly if he is humiliated or fooled he swallows and secretly plots murder but he does not threaten anyone with a higher political standing directly tyrion cerseiâ 4 littlefinger does not explain or discuss his motivations or goals with varys they may talk to each other occasionally but i very much doubt that they would do this in the manner the show presents it littlefinger and varys are not chaos vs order but two political schemers who are trying to achieve different goals but they do use pretty much the same means when they deem them necessary varys is also an agent of chaos  in favor of his aegon plans which are not ready at this point he most certainly is not principally opposed to the means littlefinger usesâ in conclusion one can say that there is nothing left from grrms littlefinger in this show and if the show was imagining the realistic westeros grrm has invented the tv version of littlefinger would not survive a day in this world the core of the character is that he is nonthreatening friends with everyone who is smart enough to move up the ladder when no one is looking or caringâ â i agree and i think it is the writing more so than the actor that has hurt littlefingerâ i always viewed him as similar to verbal kint from the usual suspects who spoiler seems like a harmless relative nobody only at the end do you realize his true role in it all or ben from losttv littlefinger is a pimp with so subtlety instead of being a master diplomat and schemer who is pulling strings behind the scenes he is made into a stereo typical mustache twirling villain edited by tadco26 25 april 2014  1101 am"

"Dany's Silver",2014-05-01,"i disagree with you on roose i think â he is portrayed nearly perfectly he is disarmingly normal in his presence but when he speaks there is so much weight behind his voice i am not as convinced with ramsays portrayalmostly for shallow reasons to do with the length of his hair but there are moments that i go  thats ramsay when watching him so yeah i enjoy mes portrayal of roose bolton a lotâ it doesnt hurt that he looks a bit like putin â the actor portraying ramsey does the crazy eyes perfectly you can see the evil glint in the eyes this you get the sense that he really enjoys what he does so much that he seems like a child at play â the lannisters send their regards avada kedavra and then a huge snake eats greywind lololololol â back on topic i dont mind his portrayal of lfâ the raspy voice can be a bit much at times but he definitely knows how to invade a girls personal spaceâ he is different from booklf but part of me thinks that because of hbos ta quota he was the perfect vehicle for those sexposition scenes"

"Koi No Yokan",2014-04-22,"i think all of you are pegging aiden gillen entirely wrong while there may be legit complaints that his welsh accent is not correct if that is in fact what theyve directed him to use  i think the bad acting many of you are seeing is a more contrived posture hes using for the cheesycreepy littlefinger personality that was most definitely how he was portrayed in the books petyr was all about drama and being snively and rat like he reminds me of templeton from charlottes web very sneering and full of himself and also somewhat fake and melodramatic so what many of you are saying you dislike about his character portrayal is actually him being spot on despicable some of his scenes with varys in particular in seasons past were amazing â i agree i never understood the whole argument about lf being ambiguous in the books  hes a downright fucking creep and an untrustworthy backstabbing asshole from the moment you meet him in got gillen may change his accent up a bit i dont think its that bothersome or entirely noticeable but i guess it annoys others but otherwise i think hes playing the part well hes all smiles and japes around his superiors but his true character really starts to shine in front of sansa and yes those scenes with varys are brilliant not to mention the chaos is a ladder speech is still probably my single favourite monologue in the show edited by koi no yokan 22 april 2014  0259 am"
"Modesty Lannister",2014-04-22,"gillen is very consistent he always whispers to sansa invades her personal space and uses every opportunity to touch her viewers are confused because they mostly remember his appearance when talking to varys or his whores which is completely different the way gillen acted in the latest episode is not only consistent with his scenes with sophie from season 1 its a bit emphasised which it would be really because her arrival is something he wished for for a long time in his scheme of things and it also means his plot has succeeded which makes him giddy the change in accent â<U+0080> i dont see it but i do not think it has anything to do with wales the vale is described as equivalent of scotland not wales while dorne is being compared to both moorish spain and wales hence all these goat jokes so i dont see a problem at all too many people hate lf and then just translate that hate to poor mr gillen"

"Greywolf2375",2014-04-22,"for me littlefingers character was equivalent to silk in david eddings belgariad series  might be too obscure a reference though littlefinger in the books is not creepy firstly there was no evidence he was obsessed with sansa in the books indeed he had limited contact with her until he spirited her away for the most part he communicated indirectly via dantos the movie deliberately chose to show littlefinger with a sansa obsession  as was evident early in season one when he tells her the story of the hound and the mountain that scene never happened in the books  it was a story told by the hound himself in a meeting with sansa im not sure how those two are comparableâ â silk is a spy and a thief but doesnt exhibit any of the behaviors that lf is portrayed as havingâ the limited contact was intentional toâ create distance in his schemes while the show has portrayed that differently in some aspects he does have much the same feeling about her in the books as in the show â lf in the books is very creepy  how he interacts with sansa is just one piece of it"

"LuisDantas",2014-04-22,"the show generally goes way out of its way to make stannis look sympathetic without fully conflicting with the books â that some people feel the opposite shows how much of that sympathy is on the eyes of the beholder imo â and perhaps also how little we understand of the actual nature and boundaries of davos devotion to stannis from the books â â on the text davos seems to be almost afraid of even thinking about his own reasons â probably a wise choice"

"Electric Wizard",2014-04-22,"i think what irritates bookreaders most about this is the fact that the great majority of the little changes which set our own teeth grinding whilst watching the series do seem to be completely unnecessary in our eyes on the whole the merging together of minor characters and relocation of certain events in place and time are understood to be part and parcel of making a tv programme due to the time and money constraints they have we get that but why remove great characterdeveloping fanloved lines from the books like those mentioned above in favour of others though not always bad ones written by the writers yes its an adaptation but there seems little need to deviate in these minor things for no obvious gain â the stannis we know and love doesnt need softening again and again the best scenes in the series turn out to be taken directly or closely adapted in spirit if nothing else from the books dillane is a great actor for me he is stannis baratheon when hes given good lines and allowed to act the character from the books the writers need to trust more in the source material the cast and most importantly the audience no character from the books is black or white people understand that in real life too and stannis flaws and inner turmoil make him all the better a character that said he doesnt need painting as weak lustful and downright evil in the way they have if they want to have him leading from the front at blackwater or whatever else for cinematic value then fine but for everything else for stannis the character why fix what isnt broken"

"The Onion Sleight",2014-04-27,"i disagree that stannis has been butchered completely although the series has definitly made some missteps mostly in season 3 take a look at this httpwwwyoutubechvamekkskwycm this really shows the stannis that i loved in the book robert told me to hold storms end so i held it then he told me he was giving it to renly so i gave it up insult or not i gave it up because robert was my older brother and he was the king and ive always done my duty but now im the rightful king by every law of westeros and when i sit the iron throne youll be my hand this is stannis the man that holds duty and justice in such high regard and the man who cares little about a mans blood season 3 definitly did things wrong mostly during the sacrificing but so far ive liked him in season 4 during the burning scene he looked disgusted to me a stark contrast to his wifes enthusiasm  the problem as i see it is mellisandre because he seems a far better character in scenes that dont involve her the casting of stannis was flawless like most got castings dillane is almost exactly how i pictured stannis in my head and his acting is great â absolutely with you about the season 2 stannis this scene wonderful  the mistakes in season 3 stephen dillane  aso and i agree especially with you about melisandre shes still imo showstannis biggest problem â its not mel herself its definitely not carice its their relationship and when i think about my showwatching mother and sister the fact that many people believe mels the evil incarnate â my sister who is a total unsullied but knows that im a absolute stanstan said once i really dont hate stannis i absolutely hate the fire bitch my mother and sister always call her fire bitch oh and she really hates my constant laments about character assassination  butchery i understand this espically when we watch together a new episode during this i must be very annoying â my mother whos also an unsullied but allows me to spoiler her everything i want and spoiler is my second name  thinks once all that awesome stannis the king who cares baratheon in the north stuff happens she will warm up to him ive already spoilered her the all storylines till the twow theon sample chapter ive told her also more about the mel  stannis and mel  jon relationships in the future and in her opinion when he marches without mel through the north then shell definitely warm up to him â both think if he would get rid of her they would like him much more both think at the moment hes absolutely under her influence both think its more mels story than stannis okay my mother luckily knows the truth now both think mels evil really evil because their biggest problem with her is actually they want to know what exactly mel wants from stannis why does she think hes aar what does this mean does she really believes this or does she their opinion so far pretends this because she wants to exploit him for her for us unknown purposes and since shes evil or at least her actions so far are evil  evil purposes â i have to admit before her own pov nobody really knew the truth about mels belief in stannis being aar and her pov definitely changed opinions about her sometimes for the worse she always fails with her prophecies her thinking is narrowminded and naive theres no mysterious cool plan behind her belief in stannis she backed the wrong person the whole time she knows shes actually somehow wrong but wont give up her opinion about aar how dumb sometimes for the better its good that theres no evil plan behind her belief her intentions are really good she never pretended to believe something she wouldnt believe i can understand how she holds on her faith  opinion  stannis and doesnt wont to admit her mistakes and that she was wrong the whole time thats somehow human human failure for me it was the second case â â on the show stannis and mel are a duo they nearly always appear together since season 3 or if one of them alone its mostly mel even if dd want to ruin stannis coming arc in the north one thing they cant change yes im sure its impossible even for them is the fact that stannis and mel will part company at a moment on the show theyll go separate ways now we could argue about how much â<U+0080><U+009C>separate waysâ<U+0080><U+009D> but letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s say for a moment for both definitely physically separated â and imo that will be fucking good for both of them it will help them much and it will help their portrayalsâ the whole team dragonstone stannis davos and mel is at different places later they all have their own storylines they all interact with different main or big secondary characters everyone of them is involved in the great wonderful important north arc everyone with her  his own different involvement stannis is mels bitch will stop â when show watchers now donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about s d and m they canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t avoid caring later for them i hope it they wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t no longer sitting in dragonstone having no contact to other main characters being â<U+0080><U+009C>irrelevantâ<U+0080><U+009D> they become extreme important theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll meet a bunch of characters who the watchers love  hate or will love  hate theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re at the wall one of the most important places in asoiaf  got white harbour a cool new location for the unsullied or marching to winterfell is there one person who doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about what happens to winterfell one of these centre places since season 1 â and whether you love or hate jon and whether you love or hate jon on the show i think he will help stannis and mel very very much nobody can deny that the show loves oneonone dialogues thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of the many reasons why they give kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing so much â<U+0080><U+0093>unnecessary screen time and i could imagine season 5 having many jonstannis and jonmel dialogues i hope and think they will benefit them â jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of the most loved main characters one of my motherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and sisterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s favourites too and the show should use the potential of his relationships with these characters jon eg spends more than one book with trying to not root for stannis but then roots more and more for him and accepts more and more at the end that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s quasi in team stannis jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s struggle with his  the nwâ<U+0080><U+0099>s neutrality and how the avoids to back and support stannis too much but does it evermore is one of his most important aspects in his adwdâ<U+0080><U+0099>s  lcâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arc jon lovers should see and understand it i also hope theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see that stannis and jon are a good team their mutual respect that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re similar in many points that these are the guys who really think and care about the northâ<U+0080><U+0099>s situation the wildlings boltons the others when the most people donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give a shit about this things like the stannisnod jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s tip about deepwood and the mountain clans he warns stannis about the karstarkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s treachery stannis saves their all lifes offers him winterfell promises to bring arya to jon if he can how they handle the situation with the wildlings â<U+0080> you all know what i mean â and about mel i guess the most unsullied will be shocked when they see her staying with jon at the wall and they will worry about him when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see mel courting for jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trust and friendship but maybe theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll wonder whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s really the deal with mel and see that it hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t to do with stannis it has to do with aar when stannis leaves her behind and has later an army with râ<U+0080><U+0099>hllor the seven the old god and one drowned godworshippers but sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not with him the religious thing has nothing to do with her influence but with his queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men the battle is still dependent on his men his supporters but not on mel and then finally the unsullied should see the pragmatic atheist okay i could imagine the show would doing something so dumb like making him to burn innocents instead of cannibals but making him to trying to burn a northman and explain this dumb behaviour to watchers would be too difficult for dd i hope â they will and should show the burning of mance positively and how the wildlings should burn weirwood tree brunches certainly but hopefully we wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see mel running through castle black and trying to burn  proselytize everyone they should use her at his time to explain more about the aar prophecy and the great other and the others and her growing interest in jon but also how she misinterprets what she sees and her mistakes that shes an ultimate the end justifies the means or the road to hell is paved with good intentions character no villain but also definitely no good person which wont bring her much sympathy but maybe at least maybe more understanding â okay and want should i say about davos imo itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s impossible to not love him and i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe that people exist who didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t enjoy his adwd arc do they exist

borrell and sweet sister you have to love the onion knight and his storyline â â so briefly speaking every dragonstone character should benefit from having their own storyline in the future dont get me wrong i absolutely love them together thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no team i found more interesting and better in asoiaf than these three their dynamic and relationships to each other are by far the best and most fascinating for me whether itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stannisdavos or stannismel or meldavos or of course stannisdavosmel but on the show the separation will do them good and since weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re here to talk about stannis i want to emphasize especially stannis people should see him making decisions alone but still listening to good advice being the awesome leader who leads his host through a blizzard becoming one of the most important persons whose fate will also decide the fate of the north aso and no matter how much the show wants to screw him up or ruin his story â<U+0080><U+0093> they canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t ruin it totally and cant delete the important part heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to play they can lesser it yes and knowing the show they will and probably my hopes are shit and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll even manage to make his march to winterfell looking like something badâ<U+0080> but at the moment iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m hopeful  â i

"rocksniffer",2014-04-23,"i am curious if anyone else is wondering if tywin was the killer of joffreyafter all he was aware of joffs tendencies and knew he was not cut out to be kingcould he have been the mastermind behind the poisoninghis position was in jeopardy remember last season when he and the king had words in front of the throne if joff decided to put him aside for someone elsegramps might have decided to move on to a more easily manipulated grandsonjust this old assholes thoughts feel free to disagreeâ â â discuss"
"Woman of War",2014-04-24,"i think the episode heavily suggested this tywin demonstrating a certain understanding with olenna then tywins speech to tommen margaery seems to have been unaware of the poisoning plan finally tyrions suspicion verbalizing the viewers thoughts we saw two sides of tywin the kindly educating grandfather and the one who acts if education does not take roots joffrey did not grasp what it means to be king and tyrion still had emotions and semtimentalities left both failures who do no longer forward the lannister case if of a different kind so they received tywins personal kind of wisdom edited by woman of war 24 april 2014  0222 am"
"ovis alba",2014-04-24,"i agree that the show somehow hints it a lot in the show he has been shown several times making plans and interacting with olenna and in addition to the tommen speech and tyrions comments i would also add the encounter with oberyn he overall seems extremly aware of what is going on and who to blame and who not the only thing im really not sure about is if they wanna distract from the actual reveal or if they really want to hint that there has been something going on beyond what most think from the book version"
"rocksniffer",2014-04-24,"i also noted upon rewatch that tywin was standing in the same general direction joff pointed in â i have suspected that he would have preferred tommen who not only is more pliable being younger and of course not insane like joff but also i feel that tywin was concerned after the marriage etc joff would refuse to continue tywin as hand â in addition after casting jamie aside and killing joff tommen would not only be king but an acceptable heir to the rocktywin has repeatedly emphasized his concern above all with the family and the name continuing who better to put as lord of casterly rock that a son of tommens who had been properly raised by tywin and not controlledruined by cerseii noted how he completely ignored her like she was not there during his what makes a king speech over joffs dead bodyâ"
"Jairion Lannister",2014-04-24,"ive always been unsure about whether he was responsible or not but the show does hint at his possible involvement quite strongly also whereas tommen in the book is younger and a lot weaker show tommen is still a fairly nice innocent kid but hes at least a bit older than book tommen to the point where tywin would perhaps be happier with him as king"

"Skeksi",2014-04-26,"im absolutely sure im not the first person to complain about the rape scene but since its the nitpicking with impunity thread im going to do it anyway â now just to get this out of the way first i do find the sept scene in the books problematic jaime ignores cerseis initial protests so stricken with desire is he which even though cersei does consent to the sex after her initial reaction does reflect a problematic attitude towards consent ignore the person saying no just keep going until they admit they do want you after all when a persons no should always be taken seriously regardless of the reasoning had the director writers showrunners come out and stated well we found that the scene in the books was pretty ambiguously consensual and we felt that that gave off a troubling message so we decided to remove that and actually show that no this is a dark scene and what jaime is doing is wrong that would be i think fair enough but they didnt they see the scene as it appeared in the books two people who want each other but one of them is worried about discovery the sex is consensual or at least becomes that way by the end and that has to inform how the characters act going ahead not to mention this scene isnt like the books â  unlike the books where once cersei does give her consent it is verbal and enthusiastic there is no point in the scene where cersei is saying anything other than no stop or this isnt right there is never a point where that changes yes she kisses him back but we know they are were attracted to each other and that they were in a relationship in real life people in relationships are raped and sexually assaulted they are raped and sexually assaulted by people that they might find attractive if the notion was that it was be definitely consensual by the end then why have her continually voice her objections why not actually include the line out of the book it would still be a problematic scene see above but the notion that a person sobbing and asking their attacker to stop is consenting on any level beggars belief â  the whole scene in the books takes place when jaime and cersei first meet jaime in the books is motivated by desire for cersei to be with his lover again in the show jaime has been back for weeks cersei has rebuffed his advances during this time more than once jaime in the show is motivated by anger anger at cersei anger at cersei for rejecting him ive seen comments from viewers readers about cersei deserving it because shes a bad person and i have to point out a ew sexualised punishments not cool i dont get people framing theons castration as something he deserved either and cersei is being punished by jaime because she rejects him not because she killed lady or arrested ned or let joffrey run wild or for laughing at the red wedding or even for wanting tyrion killed without trial but for the ohsohorrendous crime of not wanting to fuck jaime people are not entitled to sex or a relationship and they are certainly not entitled to force someone into it until they give in â the problem is what the show did was take a somewhat problematic scene in the books and made it infinitely more problematic the problem is rather than intentionally portraying this as a monstrous action of jaimes in the way that joffreys execution of ned the red wedding and pretty much everything ramsay ever does are shown as monstrous horrible actions the people involved with this scene created this as something that they intended to represent a consensual sexual encounter in a disturbing setting and instead created something that the vast vast majority of their viewers see as a rape i mean on the one hand im relieved to see so many people labelling it as rape because of cerseis constant vocal protests rather than stating well shes not fighting enough or they were in a relationship so she must have consented not that i havent seen these reactions too but not as many as i might have expected given the victim blaming you often see in reports about sexual assaults in the modern day but on the other hand if these characters act like they just had a consensual sexual encounter on screen then  i dont even know ive overlooked a fair bit of questionable stuff from the tv show towards its female characters but usually i roll my eyes and move on this has been making me angry since i watched it â for another less serious bit of nitpicking i hope theyre not going to drag who really killed joffrey out into some sort of ongoing mystery it was solved pretty much instantly in the books by littlefinger the impact of the reveal was not because it was dragged out for ages but because we find out that after all the misery that joffrey caused and all of the people who had cause to genuinely hate him he was killed not out of revenge but to further the political agendas of two schemers olenna and the tyrells by allowing them to marry margaery to a more pleasant and easily influenced lannister king and lf by creating the chaos that he thrives in and allowing him to seize the heir to the north in the confusion and that they get away with it whilst tyrion and sansa  who do have reason to hate joff personally take the blame now that we know that lf knew about the murder and had the fake necklace made its pretty obvious that he has something to do with it just reveal the plan rather than drag it out"

"The Reader Lisa",2014-04-27,"i must confess that at the end of episode 3 i turned to my son and said that episode wasnt too bad the best so far howeveri want to pick up on grrms comment about the butterfly effect and apply it to what theyve done to my favorite part of the books arya and the hound â i once described their scenes in sos as the ransom of red chief meets true grit what hbo is giving us is lone wolf and cub played for laughs people seem to enjoy these scenes i find parts of them funny myself but they are a far cry from the beautifully developed story line grrm wrote the reason for this and this is where the butterfly effect comes in is that with the whole sansan story line tossed out the window like bran there isnt much left for arya and the hound to talk about theres no compelling hidden agenda for the hound to ingratiate himself with the starks when there were still starks the scene at the inn was when the hound found out sansa had been married to tyrion in the book and he was really thrown by the news on the show he just wants some chicken a word i dont think is ever used in the books  hows that for nitpicky whats he going to say on his deathbed ask for more chicken its beyond sad â and sansan aside isnt arya just a little too perky shouldnt she be more traumatized by the red wedding in the book she describes this hole in her where her heart used to be shes shellshocked not getting any of that from the show shes more like a prepubescent mary tyler moore running around with a grumpy lou grant the girls got spunk i hate spunk â also in the book they are running for their lives the freys are out in force mopping up escapees from the twins okay we see them ride by some unconvincing dead bodieswhere are the crows but the precariousness of their situation doesnt seem to come across â sadits just sad"

"Mladen",2014-04-20,"as usual we start with reminder that there will be spoilers from all 5 books of asoiaf series so you are advised to be careful if you havent read the books â given the experience from last thread please be polite to others and stick to the topicâ â and now sansa in this episode this episode in terms of sansas arc can be considered rather significant deviation from the book series although it is arguable that small change such as in how sansa escaped kings landing is significant there is that point that the words escape and taken from are in fact 2 different words and as such represent change luckily the adaptation of sansas character hasnt gone through debauchery such as tyrion known as st tyrion of house whitewashing jaime i pushed kid off the window whats raping a sister for me and stannis but the pile of these small changes can be considered troublesome â the second part of this threads discussion is the necklace many theories revolving sansa was around possibility of use of the hairnet in the books necklace in the tv show with destruction of the gems and throwing it into a boat with dontos one can argue that it was a small hint about the importance of the chekhovs hairnet whats your opinion about that â once again welcome to the discussing sansa thread"
"Queen Sansa Stark",2014-04-20,"didnt like it either we wont have sansa poisoning littlefinger with it or they just didnt care"
"Colonel Green",2014-04-20,"yeah i think we can write off the hairnet theory though that was always based more on a detail omission than anything else â i said over the review thread but the way the actual escape was staged was just terrible on a filming levelâ it makes getting out of kings landing look easypeasyâ i get that the books cliffscaling was not likely feasible but surely something more challenging could have been devisedâ and then just a smash cut to the middle of the night and fogâ no sense of the passage of time or anything â the actual scene with littlefinger was decent thoughâ they juryrigged an adequate substitute for littlefingers missing life is not a song line callbackâ though her protests regarding dontos intentions just have no emotional depth to them given how the grand sum of their interactions on the show were about thirty seconds edited by colonel green 20 april 2014  1050 pm"

"Newstar",2014-04-20,"i was super attached to the poetic justice of sansa using a gem from the hairnet to kill littlefinger sad that the show seems to have ruled that out by disposing of the necklace â of course if the giant prophecy does refer to sansa killing littlefinger i dunno that poisoning would really fall under what i consider slaying doesnt mean she wont kill littlefinger or have a hand in it just that it wont be through poison â st tyrion of house whitewashing â no lies detected â i said over the review thread but the way the actual escape was staged was just terrible on a filming level â yeah the cut from tywin bellowing no one leaves the capital to dontos and sansa easily leaving the capital added an element of absurdity to the proceedings"
"Scrambled Aegon",2014-04-20,"sansa will still kill lf just not with the hairnet no biggie there as far as im concerned the act itself will be more important than the method anyway and personally id rather see her shove him out the moon door anyway"
"Zombies That Were Promised",2014-04-20,"yeah it is sad sansas escape was a moment the show would rather just have you accept than when the show takes time to detail things so well like the filming of olenna snatching the gem last week â this means it was an artistic executive decision not that they were incapable of showing an elaborate sansa getaway â but oh well im glad shes finally out and excited to see her story evolve from here"
"juanml82",2014-04-20,"yeah the cut from tywin bellowing no one leaves the capital to dontos and sansa easily leaving the capital added an element of absurdity to the proceedings i dont know tywin orders go as fast as riders can go and in a city that big its likely that some point will be overseen its not like the gold cloaks are exactly exemplar city guards â as for the necklace it may or may not debunk the chekovs hairnet after all we didnt have a chain in season 2 and that didnt stop tyrion from blowing up stannis navy if sansa is scheduled to use the strangler in the books the show might resolve it in another fashion sweetsleep or some other medication can also do the job or the conflict might be resolved otherwise"

"Annara Snow",2014-04-27,"sansa separates petyr baelish into two different people petyr who is in her own thoughts her saviour and littlefinger whos the receptacle of everything thats wrong with

extent of robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s frailty and cowardice become too widely known her father had warned her i wish he were here he would know what to do â petyr baelish was clear across the vale though attending lord lyonel corbray at his wedding a widower of fortyodd years and childless lord lyonel was to wed the strapping sixteenyearold daughter of a rich gulltown merchant petyr had brokered the match himself the brideâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dower was said to be staggering it had to be since she was of common birth corbrayâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vassals would be there with the lords waxley grafton lynderly some petty lords and landed knights and lord belmore who had lately reconciled with her father the other lords declarant were expected to shun the nuptials so petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s presence was essential â alayne understood all that well enough but it meant that the burden of getting sweetrobin safely down the mountain fell on her â<U+0080><U+009C>give his lordship a cup of sweetmilkâ<U+0080><U+009D> she told the maester â<U+0080><U+009C>that will stop him from shaking on the journey downâ<U+0080><U+009D> â  â iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d like to give you a hundred spankings and five slaps you would not dare behave like this if petyr were here the little lord had a good healthy fear of his stepfather â she wishes he was there only because shes saddled with the task of getting sweetrobin down to meet the lords declarant and would rather that lf deals with him and because sr would be behaving if he was there but as it happens she manages to perform that task very well herself and doesnt wish for him to be there at any other point in the chapter â she never actually wishes that he was there because she personally enjoys his presence â oh but how could i forget you must be referring to this right â before she could summon the servants however sweetrobin threw his skinny arms around her and kissed her it was a little boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kiss and clumsy everything robert arryn did was clumsy if i close my eyes i can pretend he is the knight of flowers ser loras had given sansa stark a red rose once but he had never kissed her and no tyrell would ever kiss alayne stone pretty as she was she had been born on the wrong side of the blanket â as the boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lips touched her own she found herself thinking of another kiss she could still remember how it felt when his cruel mouth pressed down on her own he had come to sansa in the darkness as green fire filled the sky he took a song and a kiss and left me nothing but a bloody cloak â oh wait that was not about littlefinger that was about someone else â shes genuinely happy to see him you say where do we see that â as the riders were climbing off their mules however one of petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s guardsmen emerged from within the keep â<U+0080><U+009C>lady alayneâ<U+0080><U+009D> he said â<U+0080><U+009C>the lord protector has been waiting for youâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s backâ<U+0080><U+009D> she said startled â<U+0080><U+009C>at evenfall youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll find him in the west towerâ<U+0080><U+009D> the hour was closer to dawn than to dusk and most of the castle was asleep but not petyr baelish alayne found him seated by a crackling fire drinking hot mulled wine with three men she did not know they all rose when she entered and petyr smiled warmly â<U+0080><U+009C>alayne come give your father a kissâ<U+0080><U+009D> she hugged him dutifully and kissed him on the cheek â<U+0080><U+009C>i am sorry to intrude father no one told me you had companyâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>you are never an intrusion sweetling i was just now telling these good knights what a dutiful daughter i hadâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>dutiful and beautifulâ<U+0080><U+009D> said an elegant young knight whose thick blond mane cascaded down well past his shoulders â<U+0080><U+009C>ayeâ<U+0080><U+009D> said the second knight a burly fellow with a thick saltandpepper beard a red nose bulbous with broken veins and gnarled hands as large as hams â<U+0080><U+009C>you left out that part

orange hair â<U+0080><U+009C>particularly around louts like usâ<U+0080><U+009D> alayne laughed â<U+0080><U+009C>are you loutsâ<U+0080><U+009D> she said teasing â<U+0080><U+009C>why i took the three of you for gallant knightsâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>knights they areâ<U+0080><U+009D> said petyr â<U+0080><U+009C>their gallantry has yet to be demonstrated but we may hope allow me to present ser byron ser morgarth and ser shadrich sers the lady alayne my natural and very clever daughter with whom i must needs confer if you will be so good as to excuse usâ<U+0080><U+009D> the three knights bowed and withdrew though the tall one with the blond hair kissed her hand before taking his leave â<U+0080><U+009C>hedge knightsâ<U+0080><U+009D> said alayne when the door had closed â<U+0080><U+009C>hungry knights i thought it best that we have a few more swords about us the times grow ever more interesting my sweet and when the times are interesting you can never have too many swords the merling kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s returned to gulltown and old oswell had some tales to tellâ<U+0080><U+009D> she knew better than to ask what sort of tales if petyr had wanted her to know he would have told her â<U+0080><U+009C>i did not expect you back so soonâ<U+0080><U+009D> she said â<U+0080><U+009C>i am glad youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve comeâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>i would never

the sort of kiss that says welcome home see that you do better next timeâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>yes fatherâ<U+0080><U+009D> she could feel herself blushing â where are any signs that shes

make sure she doesnt suspect anything as if there is a progression in sansas storyline towards getting more and more cozy with littlefinger â geez really what possible reason could she have to make sure myranda doesnt suspect shes sansa â she would need to be brave down below where the chance of being unmasked was so much greater petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s friends at court had sent him word that

"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2014-04-21,"tywin and tommen scene wins this episode for me â there was so much going on there it shows how on top of things tywin really is and that while tommen is young and innocent he is not an idiot it was also a slap in the face to cersei and demonstrated how seriously out of touch she is when she started to protest tywin gave no reaction and just ignored her because he was speaking withâ the most important person in the room and cersei knew it the walk out at the end was tywin breaking the chains cersei thought she had on tommen â that scene was just absolutely delicious â 2nd was tyrion and pod â it conveyed a massive amount of information in a very efficient way it was also paced extremely well paced  first loyal pod arrives with gifts then the bad news starts to leak out  and gradually builds until pod reveals he had been asked to betray tyrion the climax was this is goodbye pod its just unfortunate it was overshadowed by the scene above â 3rd tywin and oberyn â it clearly demonstrated what a political genius tywin is and again exactly how on top of affairs he is as well perhaps even more importantly it showed how shrewd oberyn is as well  so much more than a killer with a rampant libido and an incredibly deep character"

"Strong Belwas!",2014-04-22,"do not downplay the exemption of strong belwas â i think people are upset about this change because jaimes character is one of the most dynamic in the books he also undergoes a massive transformation from agot to adwd having jaime rape cersei sets his character backwards and basically negates his saving of brienne from being rapedâ"
"complexphoenix",2014-04-22,"people care so much about this particular screwup because this is a particularly consequential screwup it makes jaime a lot less sympathetic and cersei a good deal more so the fact that it has to do with rape does indeed make it a whole lot worse because rape is a very very touchy subject â most of the stuff youve cited has to do with minor characters who most people dont care all that much about or are simple medium translation issues or are simply communicating something in a different way than it was communicated in the book this is a major scene involving two major characters who are central to the story which messes up their portrayal its also a very memorable book scene that many of us were really looking forward to seeing filmed and the fact that its completely ruined by a director who clearly doesnt understand what was going on in that scene at all makes it cause for outcry in a way that most changes arent â the scene turns jaime into someone who is capable of raping a woman he claims to love in a fit of anger whereas in the book he wouldnt do that in the book he is a man in love desperately horny after being apart from cersei for more than a year trying to comfort her in her grief in a way thats clueless and inept and incredibly gross but also wellmeaning and ultimately kind of sweet in the show hes angry with her and trying to hurt her he says outright that he doesnt care about her feelings the book version makes him sympathetic the show version makes him a monster if jaime were a minor character people wouldnt much care but hes a major character and a fan favorite so the outcry is deafening"
"Father of Dragons",2014-04-22,"because many people including myself see that this rape kills all of jaimes character development from the last season yes many things on your list irritate myself as well  id actually forgotten about some of them  but many of those changes can be justified tv budget not needed to move the plot forward etc however the fact that they chose to remove cerseis consent and make it outright rape is not justifiable we have to remember whenever we see a change that this is a television adaptation and may not have the budget or time to fill in tiny details and adapt the books word for word but to have a character spend a season redeeming himself after a bad first impression and then to destroy all that work is just mad on the whole i agree with you and i dont want a lengthily argument about this i was only explaining why people were irritated about this change"

"flamingothegreen",2014-04-22,"i agree with the original poster â i too dont understand why its such a huge deal that jaime does rape cersei other than obvious moral reasons but i mean for the charactershow itself as i said in the previous thread regarding jaime i believe both the scene in the book and show are parallel just slightly less obvious in the show i guess no one wants to admit  even grrmâ  that in the books its rape spoiler rape is a type ofâ sexual assaultâ usually involving sexual intercourse which is initiated by one or more people against another person without that persons consent the act may be carried out by physical force coercion abuse of authority or against a person who is incapable of valid consent such as one who is unconscious incapacitated or below the legal age of consentâ  wikipedia but we all know thats what rape is â no matter what the reason for cersei saying no its still no therefore it is rape i dont really understand why everyone defends book jaime for this either  he does rape her she just consents halfway through the act  just like she does in the show just less visiblyâ she kisses back barely fights back wraps her armsâ around him etc  someone who does not consent would not do those thingsâ which was probably the only mistake in that scene i dont think it takes away from his character therefore i dont think its a big deal  its not that far off from the book whereas other parts hugely differ from the books  so reallynothing to complain about there imo"

"complexphoenix",2014-04-22,"â right in my opinion the shades of rape is not a useful discussion to have i understand where youre coming from and ive heard the bookscene described as daterape whereas the showscene is thought of as more aggravated but i think its a troubling path to start down if we try and define where rape begins and ends and if we view some rapes as worse than others the tone is different aye and darker but its hardly character assassination and the outrage over the change troubles meâ â like i said i dont think a softer scene is necessarily better depicting violence against women as morally ambiguous is problematic and the conversation which would have followed isnt a good one to have even though watching it was really disturbing in a way im glad the show made us deal with jaimes assault headon martins bookscene and his comments on the episode instead present us with the disturbing idea that we shouldnt view it as rape because cersei gets into it its like completely ignore the moment where cersei is shouting for jaime to stop beating against his chest with her fists and he â<U+0080><U+009C>doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hear itâ<U+0080><U+009D> that is rape â theres no such thing as maybe rape or lessterrible rape was the tone different yes not that different though so rather than screaming and pointing fingers at the director who really dug his own grave with his comments and i cant excuse that i think we should be more critical of the source material or at the very least stop holding jaime up as the redeemed good knight hes a grey character in a very very grey universe the show stayed true to this the reason this is the scene that made everyone freak out is because they had false notions about the nature of jaimes character â i really disagree with you here violence against women  indeed violence in general  is very much a moral issue but every moral issue has gradations and degrees of wrongdoing if we can divide homicide into first second and third degree murder negligent homicide various degrees of manslaughter etc why on earth shouldnt sexual assault be dealt with similarly shouldnt it be obvious that beating a screaming woman to a bloody pulp and then forcibly raping her is way way worse than having sex with a romantic partner who is feeling conflicted about whether youre in the right place for it even if those two things do have some things in common and neither one is right â the fact of the matter is that there is a very wide spectrum of wrongness in the category of violence against women and what jaime did in the show was clearly worse than what he did in the books in both versions hes a gray character but the shows portrayal of the sept scene really does make him seem to be a much worse person than he is in the books â the fact that we want to see rapists punished in the real world and want the police and courts to take rape seriously as a crime shouldnt blind us to the fact that ambiguities and gray areas do exist in this issue insisting that an issue be treated as totally black and white and refusing to acknowledge the gray areas even when their existence is staring us in the face doesnt do us any good in my opinion denying reality for the sake of intellectual comfort is never a good idea â given how clueless the director is about what he showed jaime doing in this episode i think were likely to see jaime sympathetically portrayed going forward having the same character commit a clear unambiguous rape and then go and be a good guy after that should probably disturb us more than it would if the sept scene were ambiguous because it advances the unfortunate idea that a man can be a good guy even if hes a rapist"

"MoA«t",2014-04-22,"what i think it says about our culture is that many people lack the critical thinking skills that give people the talent to look at the actions and words of a character and differentiate the subtleties of human behavior and complexities of relationships and understand that a characters physical actions cersei grabbing jamie pulling him towards her and kissing him passionately  not the actions of a woman being raped go along with their dialog no not here its not right stop and do not exist separatelyâ so many people just seem to hear what cersei is saying while not taking into consideration her actions and the history of these two together and their complex relationshipâ whats disturbing is so many people are able to edit out everything but jamie being forceful and completely ignore what cersei is doing in the scene to get to their rape scenario which doesnt exist since more things were at play in this scene and cerseis actions do countâ if cersei lannister didnt want to have sex i have no doubt shed be able to fight off a onehanded jamie life isnt black and white neither is game of thrones"

"Chebyshov",2014-04-22,"all of you are biased cause you read the books and read the interviews read any unsullied post or ask any casual watcher they all think it was rape also people are upset because in the books there are at least 3 instance that show how jaime is against rape and having him rape her was way out of character â which is why the disturbingly violent nature of his relationship with cersei culminating in sexual assault both in the books and on film is so poignant and distressing in both cases theyre a low moment for jaime while the tone of it may be different in the books vs the show a relapse upon being back vs a ragefilled attack fueled by selfloathing it is still supposed to be a very dark moment for jaime emphasized by its location occurring on joffreys bierâ â â cersei has a pov she never thinks how jaime raped her but she thinks robert did so she at least doesnt feel she was raped by jaime in the books â which i think speaks to just how messed up their relationship is and why its such a corrosive influence on jaime to be clear im in no way defending jaimes actions or insinuating that hes the victim here just explaining the dynamics â also im not sure where this is in the book theres a line where she thinks about how sex had only been good with jaime but im not sure what youre referring to could you source it please â however having said that if a woman is saying no stop while shes forcibly pulling her rapist towards herself and passionately kissing him i really have to make the judgement call that those actions matterâ â as i said im not interested in arguing what is and isnt rape im glad you understand women dont ask to be raped but i would hope that you could understand a women voicing protest is where the line is drawn this happens in both the books and the show which is why i say theyre both rape and her getting into it is both a troubling dynamic within the relationship as well as a dangerous standard to set for the judgement call of what is and isnt rape this isnt your call and when a woman says no its no edited by chebyshov 22 april 2014  0326 pm"

"Lord Bronn Stokeworth",2014-04-22,"been reading all the social media about the last episode and i dont understand why this is the change that people are not okay withâ i watch the show only for those rare occasions where i can watch and enjoy a scene from the bookâ obviously i am usually disappointedâ so after 2 years of dd making a complete mess of things why is this instance of them butchering the story such a big dealâ just because it has to do with rapeâ in the book the scene becomes consensualâ so if this scene in the show is rape why doesnt she scream out as loud as she canâ why doesnt she punch and kickâ to me this was just poor representation of the book and not the biggest change everâ furthermore it goes all with most of the changes dd maketo add shock valueâ so why care so much now â who cares if irri and jhiqui are dead rightâ â who cares if missandei is suppose to be 10 and instead is a woman with voluptuous breasts â who cares if they completely ruin the house of the undying â why have arya kill the tickler when she can kill poliver instead â why bother having barristan kill the titans bastardâ why put that incredibly memorable scene in the show â strong belwassâ who â how are they going to have dany find out jorrah betrayed herâ not well â how will arya leave the hound when he is not injured in the fight at the innâ no reason to change it â why do i have to watch oberyn grab a handful of some guys junk every episodeâ one little teeny line about rumors that oberyn has had sex with everyone and dd run like the wind with itâ it adds nothing to showâ nothingâ and yet its thereevery episodewhyâ shock value â who cares if theyve completely annihilated the shaetrayal by giving her the laughable scorned lover motiveâ making it tryions own faultâ really â i could go on and onâ so i ask againwhy is this scene after allâ of the ridiculous and meaningless changes theyve made so far why is thisâ the one everyone is making such a big deal about â because pretty nothing you mention fundamentally alters a character like jamie raping cersei i mean is aryas character altered because she killed polliver instead of the tickler is oberyn doing anything utterly against his character by grabbing another mans junk â you gave only two examples of big alterations to characters missiandei is older and essentially taking over irri and jhiquis roles but ultimately there is nothing showmissiandei is doing that book version would never do except possibly romanticsex stuff but this is hardly a change in character since we have no reason to believe bookmissiandei wouldnt be when shes older â the other is shae yeah huge alteration but the difference is showshae is a lot more enjoyable than bookshae so people accept that easier its not like they are taking a popular character and having commit one of the horrible acts she would not do also considering tyrion is one of the few characters constantly getting whitewashed im guessing shaes betrayal will be even worse on the show than the books"

"Carey Snow",2014-04-22,"cersei has a pov she never thinks how jaime raped her but she thinks robert did so she at least doesnt feel she was raped by jaime in the books agreed cerseis initial objections in the book were very clearly about where they were and that they might get caught she says no because of the septons the gods their father etc her actions in the book showing her desire for jaime kissed till she moaned consenting and then guiding him in playing with his hairâ etc did not come across in the show clearly like they did in the book thus most of us can see in the book that despite her initial objections to having sex in the sept she very clearly wanted to have sex with jaime and very much desired him we also know that jaime was not angry with her nor was he trying to cause her harm because we are in his head we also know that afterwards neither cersei nor jaime considered it rape or a power play â the show does not dance this line at all she clearly says stop it over and over even while he is thrusting into her say what you want about body lang but cerseis desire for jaime is not made clear enough â i feel that the producerwritersdirectors just messed this one up after a night thinking about it cersies initial objections were never qualified her desire for jaime was never demonstrated strongly jaime sure looks angry and is not trying to make love to her or comfort her and this all adds up to the viewers feeling that cersei got 100 raped no gray area i never got that feeling reading the books and neither did it occur to the characters â also i am not upset that a rape was done on tv just what it does to jaimes arc which is one of the most fascinating in the series edited by carey snow 22 april 2014  0517 pm"

"Angielina",2014-04-22,"i posted this on the winter is coming website under nikolajs interview and wondered what thoughts people might have about it â â wow what a lightening rod of a scene my first reactions to this scene were silence sadness anger and confusion as i am a huge jaime fan i read all the books and it is clear to me in the book at least from jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pov that this was a consensual act an act of reconnection after reading martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s comments above it does make sense why the two are different given the set ups and yes although as nikolaj has stated that the scene was not intended to be an all out rape i definitely perceived it this way so for the purposes of this entry that is the framework i am coming from i do not think though whether the incident is interpreted as a rape or not changes how i conceptualize this scene in terms of jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character development after getting some space from this i tried to sort through what is the form and function of this interaction for jaime in the series i am a clinical psychologist by trade and specialize in trauma so i view got and its characters through this lens i have only watched the scene once and read the books once rape is about power and control as stated several times in this thread not about sexintimacy i think in this scene we finally have the gritty truth about the nature of jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship and jaime states this â<U+0080><U+009C>why have the gods made me love such a hateful womanâ<U+0080><U+009D> this is a huge realization for jaime that he acknowledges that the â<U+0080><U+009C>loveâ<U+0080><U+009D> relationship he has with his sister is in actuality based on his powerlessness over his need and dependency for her he accepts the truth of this at this point i believe only because he has a template of how kind and caring a woman can be in his experience with brienne yet still this knowledge can not change his ultimate action to reconnect again with cersai and then further to rape her which is very tragic for jaime never underestimate the power of familiar the other point is that both jaime and cersai are trauma survivors from the death of their mother cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rapes by robert and jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s loss of his hand so likely from the very beginning of their relationship they may have been attempting to comfort themselves from the loss of their mother via their sexual relationship with each other though this is difficult to definitively know from the very beginning then their relationship is fraught with power and control issues and attempts to gain mastery over trauma and loss as well as comfort each other in the pain of that loss this rape scene for jaime i see in this light and nikolaj has said that this scene for jaime is about his powerlessness yes i agree with the above comment by the criminal justice worker that perpetrators view rape in this light perpetrators are also sometimes trauma victims as is the case with jaime in coming back to kings landing jaime realizes all he has lost including his masculinity status and intimacy it is in this one moment with cersai that he is trying to obtain mastery over a life where he ultimately has had very little power due to his father and cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manipulation of him over the course of his entire life there is some foreshadowing of jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s attempts to gain power in his family in his interaction with tywin when his father gives him oathkeeper in a twisted way in raping cersai he can temporarily gain the masculinity and intimacy back â in coming back to kings landing jaime realizes all he has lost including his masculinity status and intimacy it is in this one

raping cersai he can temporarily gain the masculinity and intimacy back what is ironic though is that he is quite conflicted based on his above comment on the â<U+0080><U+009C>gods making him love a hateful womanâ<U+0080><U+009D> in that he needs to connect with her but he also wants to disconnect from her the rape he performs on cersai accomplishes both of these goals he can connect to her but disconnect from her simultaneously the rape also becomes a container for the rage and shame he feels about his own identity oathbreaker kingslayer etc although he tries to numb his own feelings by saying â<U+0080><U+009C>i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t careâ<U+0080><U+009D> finally this scene seems to bring forth again the theme of jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s loss of his ideals in the broader context of his life even his beliefs about rape can be on the table to be compromised in the â<U+0080><U+009C>rightâ<U+0080><U+009D> moment furthermore cersaiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s order to kill his own brother challenges his own ideals about his love and loyalty to his family a core character ideal for jaime we will see what becomes of this so although i do not like the scene at all as i am a jaime fan it does fit with his character development as i understand it from reading the books and the series the difference is that the series seems to be pushing the issue of jaime becoming a tragic figure more quickly i remain a jaime fan because nikolajâ<U+0080><U+0099>s portrayal is artful and the complexity of this character is fascinating i do hope it all ends well for jaime i welcome any comments just my take on things edited by angvalente 22 april 2014  0523 pm"
"Itchyscratch",2014-04-22,"a lot of couples who enjoy rough sex have a safe word to stop the action if its getting too extreme perhaps cerseis safe word is no which is why she didnt utter it once in that scene edited by itchyscratch 22 april 2014  0524 pm"
"the silver queen",2014-04-22,"my reading of the books gave me a clear impression that cersei and jaimes sexual relationship often had the pushpull nomeansyes aspect to it i dont like that personally but i clearly read it that way and even though she says no its obviously consensual the only sexual scenes that are given to us have this element in them and gives me the impression that cersei likes that dominance from jaime and always plays that gameâ â i feel like the show tried to display that with cersei kissing back and such but simply failed to make it clear enough but yeah its much more rapey and forceful and angry than in the book but i actually felt that storywise it was consistent with the strained relationship that the show has written due to jaime being back early and cersei not wanting him i dont feel it ruins jaime character entirely i think it shows him being very angry frustrated and desperate combined with him playing their game as usual that combination made it look like rape and yes the writer who did the scene made the mistake of not adding some dialog that could have helped if he truly had intended for it to be consensualâ"

"Fat Trell",2014-04-22,"i really dont see the argument that the book scene was rape it was rough and disgusting but it was consensual cersei never says she doesnt want to have sex she says they shouldnt do itâ because theyreâ in a public place their father is about and because theyre in a holy place she initiates the intimacy in the first place at the end she was very enthusiastic notâ her body reacted with arousal enthusiasm but telling her lover that he is home and for him to continue enthusiasmâ it was forceful not forced â its important to note this is jaime and cersei as well two people who have apparently been having a continuous hidden sexual relationship its doubtful this is the first time one of them has said its too risky or not here this could very likely be par for the course for them cersei never recalls this scene as rape iirc â the show scene is rape its done out of anger and selfloathing cersei never gives consent she clearly says no repeatedly"

"allie4645",2014-04-23,"after rewatching the scene i wasnt pushed into the it was a poorly directed consensual scene if anything it seemed more violent on the second go around when i first watched it i didnt notice that she rejected his first kiss and stepped a few feet away and refused to look at him he then gets angry at her physical rejectionâ aggressively takes hold of her and forcibly dominates her she kisses him for a bit but kissing is not a green light to bang her in a holy placeâ next to her dead son i also see her pushing against his chest and struggling when he is on top of her on the floor thrusting making it clear that at the moment of entry and after she was still not interested maybe that wasnt meant to look like her struggling but to me it did furthermore her continuation of verbal protestation along with his repeated i dont cares makes this pretty clearly rape if the director meant to include signs of physical consent that was straight up a terrible idea if someone is verbally denying a sexual partneraggressor but giving physical consent then thats a problem because the interpretation of the potentialactual victims actions are in the eye of the aggressor she could be struggling but he could interpret it as willful participation this is why filming a scene this way is a bad idea people can interpret it as look shes enjoying it if she were being raped she would try harder to get away while nearly everyone else sees it as rape that means that in subsequent episodes when there is no fallout from perceived violence the show seems to be condoning rape or at the very least sweeping its implications under the rug also objecting to have sex with someone in a specific time and place is objecting to have sex with them just because one is a willing sexual partner is some contexts does not give the corresponding partner rights to sex whenever wherever or whyever â so why are people so upset about this change because its entirely unnecessary one line would have changed it from obvious rape to consensual sex in the book cersei gave very explicit verbal consent so why the need to make the scene more complicated or more nuanced or more in danger of being misinterpreted this change had nothing to do with budgeting or production challenges or pagetoscreen translation issues it seems to have everything to do with shock value and making sure everyone is talking about the show it sets back jaimes character development and makes little sense in the continuity of the plot but should that really surprise us sansas development regressed quite a bit in season 3 imo and their apparent need to sanitize tyrion and dany while demonizing stannis makes little sense also turning renly into an offensive gay caricature ewwwwwwwww blood rather than the much more developed character of asoiaf really did nothing for the show the addition of ros but the subtraction of sansas assertion of agency or aryas weasel soup or the inclusion of reek in season 2 which why the hell did they not include him it made the burning of wf completely arbitrary and confusing completely baffled me as well i think we should all just assume that dd make changes just because they think it improves the story without real consideration to the repercussions of those changes this error is made all the more egregious because it was so blatantly unnecessary"

"Lady Fevre Dream",2014-04-23,"â but people are acting like jaimes behavior here is different from the books when its not at all â yes it is differentâ the whole scene has a different setting thanks to the above mentioned early arrival for jaime in klâ the earlier rejection and the line whyâ have the gods made me love such a hateful woman is a big difference from him and cersei seeing each other for the very first timeâ it sets a totally different mood and the missingdo me jaime do me makes a difference tooâ"
"Lady Fevre Dream",2014-04-23,"â yep joffreys death was clearly a tipping point previously she thought she was in control it was only a few rebukes by tyrion and tywin in the books that showed she had been making mistakes but she still thought she had it in hand post joffrey and post tywin was when she spiraled out of control â id always wanted a peek inside cerseis head before affc and i do suspect it would have been an interesting readâ shes so crazy and evil by affc i always feel like i need a shower after reading her thoughtsâ still she is funny though at times there is thatâ"

"digiFemme",2014-04-23,"been reading all the social media about the last episode and i dont understand why this is the change that people are not okay withâ i watch the show only for those rare occasions where i can watch and enjoy a scene from the bookâ obviously i am usually disappointedâ so after 2 years of dd making a complete mess of things why is this instance of them butchering the story such a big dealâ just because it has to do with rapeâ in the book the scene becomes consensualâ so if this scene in the show is rape why doesnt she scream out as loud as she canâ why doesnt she punch and kickâ to me this was just poor representation of the book and not the biggest change everâ furthermore it goes all with most of the changes dd maketo add shock valueâ so why care so much now â who cares if irri and jhiqui are dead rightâ â who cares if missandei is suppose to be 10 and instead is a woman with voluptuous breasts â who cares if they completely ruin the house of the undying â why have arya kill the tickler when she can kill poliver instead â why bother having barristan kill the titans bastardâ why put that incredibly memorable scene in the show â strong belwassâ who â how are they going to have dany find out jorrah betrayed herâ not well â how will arya leave the hound when he is not injured in the fight at the innâ no reason to change it â why do i have to watch oberyn grab a handful of some guys junk every episodeâ one little teeny line about rumors that oberyn has had sex with everyone and dd run like the wind with itâ it adds nothing to showâ nothingâ and yet its thereevery episodewhyâ shock value â who cares if theyve completely annihilated the shaetrayal by giving her the laughable scorned lover motiveâ making it tryions own faultâ really â i could go on and onâ so i ask againwhy is this scene after allâ of the ridiculous and meaningless changes theyve made so far why is thisâ the one everyone is making such a big deal about â ive been reading through some of the posts i think the problem is that a lot of people were starting to see jaimie as a good guy after he was captured lost his hand met brienne etc thats why it was so upsetting to them because they interpreted the character as going through a redemption arc which somehow meant transforming into a good guy of sorts personally ive never seen him as a good guy i agree with what martin said here in that in asoiaf there are plenty of characters that range from morally gray to downright evil and somewhere in between but once in awhile these characters will show compassion and do something good for others this has the tendency to confuse people andor cause a reinterpretation of the said character â personally ive never seen jaime as a good guy he may not be as bad as ramsay or gregor but i never forgot how he pushed bran off the tower my problem with the scene is that i consider it offcharacter and inconsistent can i believe that someone who stood by while his queen was being raped tried to murder a child and later killed his cousin in the tv show is somehow incapable of raping his sister sure given the context and background of said character â he was little more than a child himself when he served in the kingsguardat that time he clearly didnt like what was happening to queen rhaella but couldnt do a thing about it he was sworn to serve the king there were other kingsguard members there who wouldve stopped him had he even tried to intervene not to mention he probably wouldve been executed for treason in the same way he and the rest of the kingsguard stood by when aerys had brandon and rickard stark tortured and killed in courtâ â one consistent thing i can see in his actions is that he will do anything murder attempted murder to preserve his relationship with cersei anything that threatens it he will attack without conscience thats why he pushed bran off the tower and thats why he murdered cleos frey thats also probably why he endured being part of the kingsguard despite all that was happening not to mention witnessing aerys crimes against humanity etc given that it just doesnt make sense to me for him to rape his sister not because i see him as a nice person but because by hurting her that way hed be threatening his relationship with her wouldnt cersei make it even more difficult for him to be with her had he done something against her person and against her wishes i think when martin said that the scene was meant to be disturbing what he meant was that their relationship and everything about it that they were murderous people with a murderous son and while its not a crime to love a sibling per se it worked for the targs wasnt really good for jaime and cersei in particular because it didnt make them better people â i interpreted the way the scene was written in the books not just based on what was happening but also the context of their relationship and who they were to each other while i agree that a woman getting turned on in the latter part of the event doesnt make it ok and still counts as rape i felt that the scene wasnt depicted with that scenario in mind for one thing in the text cersei didnt just get turned on she became an active participant another thing is that her protests werent really a no i dont want to do this but a no i dont want to do this herebut maybe someplace else when the the text said that jaime didnt care i didnt interpret it as a he didnt care about her feelings but as a he didnt care if they were caught it is consistent with all their previous encounters not to mention what was happening to the characters at that exact time â theres has always been a twisted relationship where they have to sneak around but jaime is the more reckless that explains their reactions after their encounter in the sept in there cersei wasnt crying or whimpering or even angry with him her reaction was more of a this shouldnt have happenedwe couldve been caught whereas jaime at that point was all who cares what they think  â someone summed it up perfectly that while we find all these characters interesting and even come to care about them we shouldnt forget that not all of them are good or view them with rose colored lenses for me the problem is or should be that it was more inconsistent and off character â â the hound is not a good guy eitherbut he was good to the stark girls his killing mycah was not forgivable and whatever kindness he showed to aryasansa doesnt make up for it but it would be inconsistent for him to suddenly kill and torture someone just for the heck of it his crime is following orders from the king because as a knight thats what youre supposed to do and that includes killing anyoneit does not include enjoying torture or anything that borders on ramseyjoffrey territory same with littlefinger i was curious what his reaction to the red wedding was i dont think hed want catelyn hurt but he sure wouldnt mind if it was anyone else then again she did marry ned stark so im not sure â â edited by digifemme 23 april 2014  1012 am"

"Chebyshov",2014-04-23,"heres my final response to the op and my thoughts on the subject i wrote this for something else so i apologize for repeating some points ive made here already i dont think the tv writers made a mistake here and this is really my defense of whats depicted â from what i can tell the controversy is borne of two things 1 the director of the scene alex graves has stated that this scene â<U+0080><U+009C>becomes consensualâ<U+0080><U+009D> by the end and 2 the claim that the scene in the show differs greatly from the scene in the books the scene in the books is not one of rape the show is likely using this for shock value and this ruins jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization â iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d like to address both of these points in order â point 1 is simpler to address the scene in the show is not one of consensual sex to say that sex can â<U+0080><U+009C>becomeâ<U+0080><U+009D> consensual is a troubling notion iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure why graves said this whether it was in response to people being upset with this scene or if graves was hoping to point to some sort of subtlety in the scene but he should not have and is certainly wrong for suggesting it the showrunners view this as a rape and since that initial interview graves has described the scene as forced sex along with another interesting comment about it that iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get to when addressing point 2 iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad people jumped on his comments that it â<U+0080><U+009C>became consensualâ<U+0080><U+009D> because they should have but then this controversy becomes less about the content of the scene and more about somebodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blundered commentary on it but what graves meant with these poorly chosen remarks leads us into point 2 â this point which is rather difficult to unpack asserts that the scene was not one of rape in the books and this was a change in the show here is the text below â there was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her only hunger her mouth opened for his tongue â<U+0080><U+009C>noâ<U+0080><U+009D> she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck â<U+0080><U+009C>not here the septons    â<U+0080><U+009D> â â<U+0080><U+009C>the others can take the septonsâ<U+0080><U+009D> he kissed her again kissed her silent kissed her until she moaned then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the motherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s altar pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath she pounded on his chest with feeble fists murmuring about the risk the danger about their father about the septons about the wrath of gods he never heard her he undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart one hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes when he tore them away he saw that her moonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blood was on her but it made no difference â â<U+0080><U+009C>hurryâ<U+0080><U+009D> she was whispering now â<U+0080><U+009C>quickly quickly now do it now do me now jaime jaime jaimeâ<U+0080><U+009D> her hands helped guide him â<U+0080><U+009C>yesâ<U+0080><U+009D> cersei said as he thrust â<U+0080><U+009C>my brother sweet brother yes like that yes i have you youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re home now youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re homeâ<U+0080><U+009D> she kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair jaime lost himself in her flesh he could feel cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heart beating in time with his own and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined â but no sooner were they done than the queen said â<U+0080><U+009C>let me up if we are discovered like this    â<U+0080><U+009D> â this is a complicated scene and most people focus on the fact that cersei does give verbal consent eventually and guides him in as a point that it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t rape even martin himself has described cersei as being relatively onboard with the sex though notes that she finds the time and place wildly inappropriate however i would argue that this scene is not one that depicts consensual sex â rape is a sexual act carried out against someoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s will through force or coercion what a rape looks like is unique we even use terms like â<U+0080><U+009C>daterapeâ<U+0080><U+009D> to differentiate the way in which sexual assaults occur but is that to say that there are shades of rape that some rape is worse than others i find this notion distasteful and one that leads us towards a dangerous conversation i think a problem arises when you try to define what is and isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t rape â some have argued that the scene in the book is one of â<U+0080><U+009C>sexual assaultâ<U+0080><U+009D> not â<U+0080><U+009C>rapeâ<U+0080><U+009D> some have argued that the book scene is â<U+0080><U+009C>rapeyâ<U+0080><U+009D> but wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t come out and say â<U+0080><U+009C>rapeâ<U+0080><U+009D> we can argue the semantics of it all we like but i think to assert that this scene is incredibly different from what we saw on screen is a fallacious argument â i will paraphrase a forum post i read yesterday that i think puts it well it seems to me a dangerous place that when i say â<U+0080><U+009C>noâ<U+0080><U+009D> and a man still undresses me puts his hand between my legs even if i continue hitting him as a sign of rejection and he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t once â<U+0080><U+009C>hear itâ<U+0080><U+009D> or even consider it as him starting to rape me because he thinks i would eventually agree â just because cersei may be â<U+0080><U+009C>hungryâ<U+0080><U+009D> for jaime as martin puts it or willing in most circumstances doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mean that she forfeits the right to say â<U+0080><U+009C>noâ<U+0080><U+009D> to his advances he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hear itâ<U+0080>he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care to me this is a scene of rape cersei was not comfortable having sex in the sept next to her sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bier and whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s to blame her jaime forces himself on her and the idea that this is somehow mitigated because she â<U+0080><U+009C>gets into itâ<U+0080><U+009D> sets a very troubling precedent â i think graves was going for a scene more like what was described in the book not that it is less of rape but certainly different in tone which is why he made the comments about the scene that he did some people have tried to help graves out by noting that cersei kisses jaime back in the midst of the attack and visible pulls him closer i would argue that this was incredibly unclear upon first viewing i would also argue that we should in no way judge what a woman should look like and act like while being raped if graves was hoping to have a more of a morally ambiguous rape scene like what is in the books i think he failed the dialogue is that of unequivocal rape as we hear cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s repeated objections and even sobs the dialogue is also heavily emphasized to the point where jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s last â<U+0080><U+009C>i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t careâ<U+0080><U+009D> echoes into the next scene even after the visual has changed â this scene was difficult to watch but in a way iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d prefer not to have violence against women portrayed as being morally ambiguous or even defensible as weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen many rush to justify jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions in the book the television depiction forced us to deal with the fact that jaime forced himself on his sister in front of their sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s corpse the bookâ<U+0080><U+0099>s setting from inside jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head â<U+0080><U+009C>softensâ<U+0080><U+009D> the blow of this fact and peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fetishization of a redemption arc and love of jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character has caused many to look at his character with rosecolored glasses iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d argue that the tv show stripped us of that lens â this brings us to the claims that showjaime is out of character whereas bookjaime is within character because even if both scenes are depictions of rape they have a different â<U+0080><U+009C>feelâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>toneâ<U+0080><U+009D> yes they do in the show jaime attacks cersei in a bout of anger whereas in the book jaime is in a bout of â<U+0080><U+009C>passionâ<U+0080><U+009D> but let me argue that neither is out of character because his character is a far darkergrey than i think avid book fans want to admit â note when iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m explaining jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mentality and â<U+0080><U+009C>motivationsâ<U+0080><U+009D> for lack of a better word i am not in anyway way attempting to absolve him of guilt justify what happened or indicate that we should be okay with it iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m merely trying to explain the dynamics at play and why i think it is consistent with jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s start with the books â in the books jaime and cersei have one of the most messed up relationships iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard it defined as one of the most loving and pure at times it is not it has a corrosive effect on jaime which is why the same man who we saw heroically rescue brienne at great risk to himself is the man who also attempted to murder a sevenyear old iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard the argument that pushing bran from the tower is justified because he was trying to protect himself and cersei iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d argue instead that prelosing his hand and going through his â<U+0080><U+009C>redemption arcâ<U+0080><U+009D> jaime was not a very good man and his relationship with cersei brought out some of the worst in him â hereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a scene in the books where jaime is reflecting out loud to the mute ilyn payne on what he would have done to ayra during the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s road incident â â<U+0080><U+009C>ned starkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s daughter had run off after her wolf savaged joff youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll recall my sister wanted the girl to lose a hand the old penalty for striking one of the blood royal robert told her she was cruel and mad they fought for half the night well cersei fought and robert drank past midnight the queen summoned me inside the king was passed out snoring on the myrish carpet i asked my sister if she wanted me to carry him to bed she told me i should carry her to bed and shrugged out of her robe i took her on raymun darryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bed after stepping over robert if his grace had woken i would have killed him there and then he would not have been the first king to die upon my sword but you know that story donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t youâ<U+0080><U+009D> he slashed at a tree branch shearing it in half â<U+0080><U+009C>as i was fucking her cersei cried â<U+0080>i wantâ<U+0080><U+0099> i thought that she meant me but it was the stark girl that she wanted maimed or deadâ<U+0080><U+009D> the things i do for love â<U+0080><U+009C>it was only by chance that starkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own men found the girl before me if i had come on her firstâ<U+0080><U+009D> â this was jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mentality before his â<U+0080><U+009C>redemptionâ<U+0080><U+009D> arc in the 2nd and 3rd booksseasons would this jaime have tried to save brienne i sincerely doubt it his relationship with cersei is a toxic corrosive one that is often characterized as a â<U+0080><U+009C>powerstruggleâ<U+0080><U+009D> and punctuated by moments of violence it is unhealthy even the scene bran espies is one of dubious consent â there were soft wet sounds bran realized they were kissing he watched wide eyed and frightened his breath tight in his throat the man had a hand down between her legs and he must have been hurting her there because the woman s tarted to moan low in her throat stop it she said stop it stop it oh please    but her voice was low and weak and she did not push him away her hands buried themselves in his hair his tangled golden hair and pulled his face down to her breast â bookjaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reunion with cersei is the sept scene since being away jaime lost a hand which set him on a redemptive path i hate to describe rape as a â<U+0080><U+009C>relapseâ<U+0080><U+009D> but in many ways for jaime it was he was once again back near this woman who has been a very destructive force in his life he found himself sucked right back into that dynamic and excited by risk violence and depravity forced himself on cersei whether cersei was turned on by it is moot when she voiced her objections the scene should have stopped there in reflection afterwards jaime notes that â<U+0080><U+009C>if the sept had caught fire i might never have noticedâ<U+0080><U+009D> this is a low point for his character in the books as he couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t help himself from relapsing back to and engaging in their problematic dynamic which is highlighted by the inappropriateness of its location â showjaime hits a very similar low note through very similar means though the way in which the scene unfolds is decidedly different in the show jaime is now in the place of the spurned lover cersei is repulsed by his stump and unhappy with his selflessness when it comes to brienne as evidenced in episodes 1 and 2 respectively whether she is right in rejecting him is irrelevant to the discussion of what happens however if i havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t made one thing clear enough it is that cersei did not deserve to be raped and jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions both in the book and show are not justified â in the sept the scene begins with cersei attempting to manipulate jaime she asks him to kill their brother and kisses him in an attempt to solidify his support when she pulls away and turns her attention back towards her dead son as is her right jaime realizes what she was attempting to do for him this is a moment of being hit in the face with his past demons he sees cersei as she is a â<U+0080><U+009C>hatefulâ<U+0080><U+009D> woman who has caused him to do â<U+0080><U+009C>hatefulâ<U+0080><U+009D> things attempted childmurder and kinslaying in the show and what happens he snaps is it right no is it justified no but in a complicated way jaime attacking cersei is him committing a violent crime against himself or rather who he was â to quote alex graves again from the previously linked interview when asked why joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s body needed to be in the frame so prominently graves responds he is their first born he is their sin he is their lust and their loveâ<U+0080><U+0094>their everything if hes gone whats going to happen jaime is still trying to believe as hard as he possibly can that hes in love with cersei he cant admit that he is traumatized by his family and hes been forced his whole life to be something he doesnt want to be what he isâ<U+0080><U+0094>but has to denyâ<U+0080><U+0094>is he is actually the good knight like brienne â now iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d argue with graves that there are no truly good knights or people in westeros but what he says paints this scene as one that is nuanced and complex iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not saying that the question of â<U+0080><U+009C>was it rapeâ<U+0080><U+009D> is nuanced it was clearly a case of rape but what iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m saying is that jaime does snap when suddenly faced with his past itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a good knight but he did return to kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing a better man than he was â and this is why he suddenly doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care he realizes in that moment that he has given everything done everything for a â<U+0080><U+009C>hatefulâ<U+0080><U+009D> woman heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pushed bran out the window started a war fathered children that he could never be close to etc and this sort of all comes crashing down on him in that moment of anger he has to love cersei despite the fact that sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his twin despite the fact that their sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s corpse is right there despite the fact that they could get caught despite the fact that cersei is begging him to stop itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not okay itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not an appropriate reaction itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not a justified moment but i think it is perfectly in character with who he is and in fact even though it was darker and very upsetting to watch i feel like it was an almost better portrayal of jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character â for people to say the show has committed a sin here i think is a stretch theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not using the rape as a shock value and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not inventing it out of thin air itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in the book but because of the timeline change they made jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s emotions in the scene are different i think both fit with his character both are instances of rape and both are supposed to disturb us those who cry â<U+0080><U+009C>character assassinationâ<U+0080><U+009D> are looking for a clean redemption arc that simply doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t exist those who cry that alex graves may have a messed up view of consensual sex have a point â as a final point thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an argument to be made that if martin doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t view his book scene as rape or if cersei doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t view either instance as rape then we shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t consider it such first of all however i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think we can make blanket statements as to how rape victims â<U+0080><U+009C>shouldâ<U+0080><U+009D> act after the fact secondly if jaime and cersei were real people then perhaps theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>d be the only ones with a right to comment despite the fact that they engage in a largely abusive relationship but theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re fictionalized characters in books and a show which we are interacting with now i think we should be allowed to comment on the sexual violence that both mediums depict â thirdly martin is not the man who gets to define what is or is not â<U+0080><U+009C>rapeâ<U+0080><U+009D> he also doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t explicitly say it was consensualâ<U+0080>he merely points out the dynamic is different because cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just lost a son and feared her brotherlover was dead and he suddenly appears if martin does mean to say that cersei does not consider the encounter a rape then thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a fine comment to make and to that i would point to my previous assertions about their relationship being one of dysfunction which i think martin has been clearly trying to paint throughout his books â for me criticizing graves for his remarks that the show scene is one of sex that â<U+0080><U+009C>becomes consensualâ<U+0080><U+009D> is fair i think it would have been best if like the showrunners he tried to explain why it is an aggravated rape scene and how that works in the context of the timeline and jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character arc â however i find the criticism that this scene somehow was out of place or ruined jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization to be false jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a troubled figure who is like to be grappling with the incredibly messed up nature of his relationship with cersei for a long time both in the books and the show if you thought he was going to have a straightforward and happy redemption arcâ<U+0080>you havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been paying attention"
"DaveyJoe",2014-04-23,"â if we oversimplify and distort things then yes he acts like a rapist at times in both scenarios â if were grown ups who actually care about nuance and context there is a world of difference between making an inappropriately aggressive pass at someone which is ultimately received in a consensual manner versus sexually forcing yourself upon someone who never at any point consents to your advance â its really really freaking simple â the fact that 70 pages into this conversation there are still people who dont get it is quite frankly extremely alarming â â theres no nuance in the cheesy lines do me do me quickâ i dont think theres any need to insult me by implying that you have the grown up opinionâ i think people are upset because this scene makes jaime look bad where i think the book scene makes him look plenty badâ the way i read the scene jaime is forcing himself on cersei and would not have suddenly stopped for any reasonâ thank god grrm had cersei give consent so we can continue to like jaime thoughâ im just curious where we draw the line and decide its okay to forgive somebody for their rapacious behaviorâ again jaimes behavior in the show is quite consistent its cersei that behaves differently by not giving verbal consentâ you are all sugarcoating jaimes actions in the book"
"digiFemme",2014-04-23,"â the funny thing is that i agree with the beginning especially at this point especially after losing a hand a son and another king he would do anything to preserve the relationsship with cersei because thats almost all he has left and that he cares about but thats exactly why i disagree with the fact he wouldnt do it because as weird as it sounds due to how distubring weird and completly destructive their relationship is what happens in the sept is part of exactly that preserving their relationship which getting physical is a huge part of would it be out of character for jaime at this point to rape any other woman yes i would go as far as even sleeping with another woman would be out of character as it would be cheating on cersei i know this might sound extremly weird to any sane person but this is how messed up i see their relationship â i guess i just dont see how his doing that to her will preserve their relationship it does the opposite imho if he did anything she didnt want or made her truly angry to the point of not forgiving him shed definitely retaliate and find a way to end what was going on between them as reckless as jaime is i think he knows this the fact that they have to sneak around makes it difficult enough for thembut if she chose simply not to be with him she could and that could happen if he hurt her â as twisted as cersei is yes she likes it rough and vicious as she is i dont think shed stand for anyone to do that to her even jaime in fact since rape is an act of power over another person id go so far as to say i find it easier to see her attempt it rather than tolerate being a victim of it â this is not to say that cersei isnt a victim in general i see her as both a victim and as an antagonist but her relationship with jaime was the one part of her life where she didnt play that parteven if it didnt do them any good â â â â this is the part that seems to be driving everyone crazy for some odd reason if peopleâ trulyâ only cared about jaimes character being changed then they wouldnt be saying things like jaime better be punished next episode â the overall outrage is not about jaimes character being changed but more about people thinking got is a documentary and these are not actorsâ â â i can see why they are confused these characters are fictional and arent depicted as a hundred percent realistic even if the writer does show some realities when it comes to the darker side of human nature it makes them very hard to interpreti felt that grrm was writing opposite arcs for tyrion and jaime where the former got worse as the series progressed whereas the latter went the opposite in that he got better not arguing how realistic this is btw â but sometimes the changes in the tv show can give mixed signalsâ"
"Sigrunn",2014-04-23,"however having said that if a woman is saying no stop while shes forcibly pulling her rapist towards herself and passionately kissing him i really have to make the judgement call that those actions matter â this is a fickle subject what the body wants the mind rejects its not right this is like giving a cookie to a person on a diet obviously if theyre weak theyll take it tempting one might be seen as evil the actions that youre talking about show that shes weak and nothing more that the producers had in mind to film something else i have no doubt however this consensual sex scene was poorly executed here edited by james kidd 23 april 2014  1049 am"

"MotherMouse",2014-04-24,"i was also totally baffled by the outcry over this scene by definition the book scene and the show scene are both rape i can understand how someone who hasnt read the books could watch the scene and see it the aggressive onedimensional way its being described here but for me at least i was watching it through my bookfilter comparing it to what happened in the novel showcersei says its not right its not right which is parallel to her protests in the book about being caught shes protesting the circumstances because having sex in a place of worship next to your dead son is not right hello she is sobbing because shes an absolute emotional wreck and jaime is probably the only person shes willing to occasionally show that level of vulnerability her son is dead jaime just returned minus a hand she angry with him but still in love with him shes furious with her father shes uncertain about the future shes grieving i dont think it automatically points to her being scared or upset solely about the sex i also think that because these are fictional characters and we do get to see inside their heads we have the ability to speculate a bit and my opinion is that cersei is not and never has been scared or intimidated by jaime if she had truly been 100 opposed to his sexual advances and really wanted him to stop i think that we have evidence enough of her character and their relationship to suggest that she would have made him stop she would have screamed she would have hurt him the man only has one hand for heavens sake she would have had some sort of venomous words to throw in his face to cause him to lose interest moreso i think that she felt she should protest so she did the sex was by definition nonconsensual but like bookcersei i dont think that showcersei would assert that she felt violated after the encounter i think that this is part and parcel of their twisted and mutuallyabusive relationship its wrong but its not out of character imo i dont think that the intention is ever for jaime to be fully redeemed and i would be pretty disappointed if the show started trying to make black and white characters instead of the delightful mix of gray we get in the books okay who am i kidding they already started doing that not happy about it they could have easily softened the scene to a more ambiguous level and i think it was a stupid decision not to and definitely shows that the producers have the same wrong ideas about consensual sex that most of our culture shares but held against their storyline in the book i just dont see how it was worth all the fuss beyond they could have done a better job with that scene edited by mothermouse 24 april 2014  1049 am"

"MsLibby",2014-04-24,"are you referring to the fake satirical script that king tommen posted mslibby if not then link me ran saying that â httpasoiafwesterhatwaypage49 â and to quote ran â â so it seems to indicate an attempt at directing a giveandtake scene in which consent is being given then withheld then given  its a back and forth basically which is pretty much how jaime and cersei do things in the novels  i said there were two scenes where cersei starts off protesting but in fact theres three â in my mind that puts all this right on the shoulders of graves"
"Konradsmith",2014-04-24,"thanks for the link surely jaime and cersei interactions next episode will clarify what happened even if they dont mention it explicitly their body language and the dynamic between them will be very telling â my initial point before i went off a little was that next episode is not only jaimeheavy but redemptionheavy character development and selfimprovement arent a one way street he improved on the road with brienne had a sort of relapse which you could say in addict terms was his bottom and now will move ahead with hisâ more knightly behaviour this will manifest itselfâ in his helpingâ of brienne pod and tyrion edited by konradsmith 24 april 2014  0809 pm"

"Stark11",2014-04-21,"so just a theory here based on if tywin really does believe dany is a threat in the books ser barriston saves dany from mero outside of meereen and that leads to her finding out the truth of ser jorah if show tywin believes dany and her dragons are real maybe he will either a instruct varys to tell jorah to take out dany and somehow this message will be found by barriston daario or someone and that will lead to jorahs punishment or b he sends his own assassin that knows of jorahs involvement and before the assassin dies he reveals what jorah was really doing early on to dany i guess that would be a logical way to have dany find out this information since they cant do it how the book goes about it this would be a big variation between show and book tywin but since we all know whats going to happen i think i would enjoy this deviation overall i do believe he is just bsing with oberyn to persuade him to be a judge and get dorne on his side"

"Lord Varys",2014-04-22,"well the bad writing is in both scenes evident who the hell would have told joff about dany and the dragons varys not likely but then the bad writing started in season 2 when varys told tyrion about dany and her dragons in qarth â joff asking tywin about dany and her dragons is bad in itself not the fact that tywin is then using this sort of thing to put joff back into his place i never got what that was about anyway joff is the king and tywins grandson he should try to teach him how to rule not try to take power away from him tywin is an old man he wont be there forever and if does not teach joff how to cling to power everything he has accomplished will be lost in the very moment tywin dies â and honestly im not sure tv tywin is considering dany a huge threat he dismisses the size of the dragons in the same manner jorah questioned the very existence of the dragons back in season 1 theres a pattern there and this pattern does not portray the characters as very smart guys as of yet tywin has done nothing to get rid of daenerys and book tywin would have hired professional assassins most likely faceless men the very moment he learned of the existence of dany and her dragons grrm knows as much because he made house lannister the richest family in westeros it would be madnesssuicide for the lannisters to not assassinate dany while she is still half a world a way or to inform their enemies ie the martells of her existence to enable them to join forces with her if tywin allows dany to come close to westeros the support for king joffreytommen will diminish and disappear edited by lord varys 22 april 2014  0110 pm"

"White Harbors Wrath",2014-04-23,"one criticism of the show which i have is that the westerosi players varys lf tywin etc are entirely too wellinformed about what is happening on the other side of the world but for some reason dany does not have the same level of information about whats happening in westeros so far all shes heard is by the way king robert the usurper is dead  only because barristan sailed all the way to qarth to tell her â â in the books the lords of westeros are dismissive of what is apparently happening way over there in part because theyre too focused on what their own immediate concerns but in part because you simply cannot confirm any of it as truthful unless you start to hear many accounts of an event that all sound the same its not like people have news networks  by the time you hear anything about events far away it is indistinguishable from rumours and tall tales â in the show they are getting information that is too solid and too soon did hbo think they had to dumb things down for the twittergeneration audience who wouldnt understand a world where communication across long distances is nearly nonexistent  now theyve established that tywin lannister has heard some truly gamechanging forgeteverythingelse information and inexplicably tywin decides to casuallyâ tell this information to the one person whod be most pleased to hear that house lannister will burn in dragonfire as a sales pitch for an alliance â â i hope this is written as some sort of feint to test whether oberyn knows this already and is disloyal because otherwise  â â â â â news about a girl conquering cities with an animal who hasnt been around for hundreds of years would take huge precedence and travel a lot quicker than news of westerosi lords squabbling as usual the essos clique could probably care less whos backstabbing who at this point â not to mention if the primary means of communication between cities and ports are ravenssailorsword of mouth its not like dany has access to this as readily as any other party theyre basically raiders wandering the desert edited by white harbors wrath 23 april 2014  0811 am"
"Northern_Star",2014-04-23,"â true and also i find it hard to believe that if in the show tywin was aware of danys dragons he didnt do anything about it other than use her as an excuse to win over oberyn this is the man who ended the targ line for robert youd think hed be a tad more concerned about dany â maybe tywin does believe it but dismisses them thinking she wont be here anytime soon because her dragons are young â the matter is pretty simple dorn was offered a council seat by tyrion in the books as far as i can remember this didnt happen in the show which is good cause it would have confused the audience now where the audience knows the character they just had to make things up â i see tywin book  show as a practical man he deals with problems when they have to be dealt with theres nothing tywin lannister isnt aware of wildlings others dragons  all at their due time"

"Ran",2014-04-20,"she clearly said no repeatedlywhat she says and what she does can be two different things as i noted upthread the director indicates that the intention of the scene at the end was that it was consensual and thats how it was rehearsed and choreographed and as one can come to that conclusion just from watching carefully i suppose it works more or less though of course it raises questions about how various changes theyve made to the character has left her with less agency than she had in the novels"

"BasTyra",2014-04-21,"i think one of the problems for me was that theyve had jaime come home early and hes already been rejected by cersei in a pretty shitty way it made that scene even worse imo in the show hes been rejected he knows she doesnt want him and he forces himself on herâ â maybe i need to do a reread but i dont recall anything like that happening in the books hasnt he just returned home when they have that weird coffin sex when i read it i dont recall cersei being uninterested in jaime beforehand and i dont remember ever thinking rape  i get that the chapter is jaimes pov and thats an interesting point but yeah the scene in the show was pretty cut and dry for me "

"Maria Underfoot",2014-04-21,"theres a line between rough sex and rape the scene in the book is right on that line cersei is at first reluctantâ thenâ he kisses her before he penetrates her and her protests become meek and then she gives in and actually wants jaime the scene in the show crossed that line there was no warming up she was basicallyâ reluctant from start to end â and you know its annoying because it doesnt make sense the only purpose it serves is to make cersei even more pitiful and thats wrong because shes not supposed to be pitifulâ they could have just added one line to show that cersei was turned on rather than hint at it and require from the viewer to notice her hands or whatever"
"nara",2014-04-21,"my review with some thoughts on the scene i have been rewatching that scene quite a bit over the weeks theres four points i would note 1 as theyre slipping down to their knees its fairly clear that she actively kisses him back grabbing at his face and then pushing him away but the camera is playing tricks here when shes kissing back it suddenly dips down to sortofbutnotreally obscure and next its focused on jaimes hands 2  but at the same time it sure looks like her hands are fumbling around his waist area too 3 the final shot of her hand clenching at the cloth is pretty standard iconography in film and television to indicate passionate lovemaking 4 taking it to the books when bran witnesses jaime and cersei having sex and then again when jaime has sex with her on his return from kings landing cersei protests and then gives in the main difference in this scene as compared to the novels is that cersei both appears to give in and at the same time continues protesting it makes it all more ambiguous and i think this all ties to the changes theyve made to cerseis character on the show â i rewatched it this morning and while i agree that it looks slightly more consensual on rewatch i think its too subtle for the medium and on the whole is too rapey looking â in the books we have the benefit of jaime thinking how cersei always makes him take the initiative but eventually gives inâ we also know that he has been desperate to see her and the way hes surviving the hand loss is by thinking about her and being with her againâ both these thought make his initial persistence over her protests understandableâ then she actually tells him to do it nowâ â we also have the benefit of spoiler cersei and taena merryweather discussing a man who said yes a thousand times and cersei saying no a thousand times before finally giving in â â in the show they usually make things more obvious than in the books because its too hard to catch on to subtle things on televisionâ this was a bad time to stray from that approachâ a simple yes jaime or at least stopping of no would have been good â on the plus side at least we didnt have to suffer through her moons blood or cersei actually calling jaime brother while theyre having sex"

"Miryana",2014-04-21,"ive been vocal about my hate for jaime just about every time ive seen a thread about his redemption yet i still think this is an awful out of character choice for the adaptation to make it gets even worse reading the many many comments here and elsewhere expressing surprise at the idea that a scene where a woman keeps on saying no could have been interpreted as rape or contempt at posters who are treating it seriously instead of with cool indifference and endless references to the importance of ambiguity and interpretation â at least in the second interview linked the director calls it rape on the show cersei has made it clear to jaime that shes not interested in sex right now so jaime cant assume that shed welcome his advances hes been back for some time and shes been unwilling if the intention was rape that turns into consent it was an extremely difficult and problematic idea that was executed horribly  a distressedsounding cerseis dont and jaimes i dont care are the last damned lines in the scene in the episode it looks like jaime gets frustrated at being constantly denied sex and takes what he wants without cersei ever agreeing to it â â a part of me thinks this is done to make tyrion look better through the power of juxtaposition tyrion might spoiler kill his father and gf  but hey at least hes no rapistâ â i agree but its so strange why on earth do we have to put up with a saint tyrion stripped of all his edges if theyre prepared to go this black with jaime"

"Aoife",2014-04-21,"i guess it goes to show that those who argue that the show needs less nuance and subtlety and grey areas than the books because audiences cant handle complexity would be right in this specific occasion â i dont think thats fair im sure there are people for whom its true but its not all of the objectors especially in a scene like this where frankly you cant count on people rewatching for potential subtlety jaime was imo absolutely sexually assaulting cersei at the start of the same scene in the book  she had said no and he didnt stop however by the time penetration came about she was saying yes and come to me and all the rest while i see the argument that she said hurry just to get it over with that scene read more to me that theyre just that messed up and she was totally willing at that point â here she says no he doesnt stop she keeps saying this isnt right he says i dont care its arguable that shes clawing at his clothes but i didnt see that when i watched even after reading the first reactions and looking out for it it could still have been a completely fucked up scene had she said we shouldnt but hurry or this isnt right but i want you or even had she just been shown a little more clearly reaching for his falls or lifting up her skirt or doing anything to indicate that she was a willing if messed up participant lots of people cant watch a rape scene even once trying to say watch it again for where maybe shes doing xyz and maybe that means shes actually willing despite her words is probably not going to get far â there are also the options that 1 â shes doing this deliberately because she wants jaime to feel like shes raped her and is just messing with his head but i dont think either book or show cersei would ever actually go through with that or 2 she wants the reconnection as well but feels that she cant openly rescind her rejection of him so keeps protesting until he does the deed regardless twistedly of course theyre both still rape as from jaimes pov hes having sex with her despite her protests however given the hamfistedness of large parts of the previous 3 series i doubt it will end up being either of those scenarios im willing to see if they address it at all later or even have an obvious effect on the jaimecersei relationship but i think a lot of people will consider this too far yes even more than the other rapes and all of the murders and other violence"

"NomadicDirewolf",2014-04-21,"when i saw the scene originally i was thinking that it was a big departure from what happened in the books and wasnt reflective of what book jaime might have done but actually reading that passage from the book in detail they get pretty far into that scene before cersei actually says yes so jaime probably intended to go through with it either way so the way i see it the fact that he was going to rape her in both book and show is the important thing whether she later gave consent or not is secondary either way he was fine with raping her its possible she might have said no for different reasons in book and show but either way its a no so book jaime would have done that and im willing to accept that perhaps cersei doesnt so much consent as eventually capitulate to jaime its very interesting how a pov can change a scene completely what was bad about it was that it was definitely poorly handled by the show as the way they did the scene made jaime seem like an arsehole saying i dont care â and i question whether they should have included that scene in the show like that even if that was the way it was in the books as seeing on screen clearly makes the unsullied think a lot less of jaime than the sullied thought of him when they read that scene and that undoes a lot of his character development over season 3 and this â season however i dont see the issue that it seems that some viewers have with the show depicting rape like this aside from the fact its jaime if it were a softer show i could agree but as bad as rape is we have seen things worse than this babies have been killed children have died in most circumstances imaginable only last week we saw a very graphic death of a kid loads of characters have died horribly and we also saw drogo rape dany in s1 alot more explicitly yet many people like drogo this scene is not a step too far in this respect at all its definitely rape but because of the times i doubt either jaime or cersei would see it that way still its going to be interesting to see what grrm has to say about this scene and how it relates to its book counterpart edited by nomadicdirewolf 21 april 2014  0135 pm"
"goddessoftitsandwine",2014-04-21,"i get why people find the book scene problematic i mean aside from the dead son and the incest on the altar factors â with most other characters that scene would probably read like the woman only gave consent because she was pressured into it by the man which yes would be rape â a yes under duress is not a real yesâ â but we know cersei and we know that she is able and willing to slapattack someone for much less than forcing themselves on her â when shes hurt or angry she lashes out harshly either physically or with words â shes a very narcissistic person and most of her actions are based solely on her own desires and so i dont feel like she would experience the kind of pressure that would drive a lot of other people to say yes when they really mean nothe pressure usually stems from some kind of guilt or shame and those dont ring true with cersei â and in the book she makes her desires clear â she changed her mind not because jaime was pushing her into it but because she wanted something out of it â she wanted the sex too â her objection was to the location not the sex itself and she made the move to start the sex not him â its always important to listen to what the person says and feels and cersei did not feel violated by the encounter which makes me feel like her consent was completely genuine â we can still judge jaime for not listening to her during the first half of the encounter and im not sure if he would have kept going if shed continued to say no and slapped him to stop â id like to think he wouldnt have continued not because i think hes a great guy but because rape is one thing hes expressed disgust with in the past â most of his crimes were committed to protect cersei not to hurt her â but i can understand if someone reads that passage and feels like jaime wouldve continued to force himself on her because we already saw that he wasnt listening to her and he was so focused on his own pain at losing his hand he couldnt spare a few seconds to consider she was deeply in grief over losing her child â jaime can be just as selfish as cersei and that was an example of it â â now the show scene was straight up rape and im not sure how anyone can see it otherwise â there was no moment where cersei gave verbal consent but rather she continued to fight him and he actually said i dont care â and thats hugely different from the book scene â also go figure they were more willing to erase her consent than having her be on her period â apparently theyre only into blood when its a gory beheading"

"Thelastactionhero",2014-04-21,"â im a huge stannis fan too but i disagree stannis in the show is essentially a completely different character so its less jarring having him act like a dick for no reason because he always acts like a dick for no reason in the show having a largely bookfaithful adaptation of a pov character suddenly take an insane detour in to wtf insanelyoutofcharacter â territory is far more joltingâ â i mean jaime raping cersei what the hell were the writers even thinking when they wrote that social media has exploded in outrage even from showonly viewers it doesnt fit with anything theyve seen him do for the past season and a bit although theyve butchered the character and made him far less compelling stannis is still recognizably stannis in the show my point is that when you change the context of an event for example burning alester for being an infidel rather than for trying to sell his daughter to the lannisters the tone of the event is altered as are the characters in question in both the book and the show stannis burns a man alive in both the book and the show jaime has sexual intercourse with cersei during their dead sons vigil the difference is that jaime raping cersei instead of having consensual though admittedly agressive sex severely damages the character i feel bad for fans of jaime and im not too pleased about it myself because i really like where his story goes in a feast for crows but i find it telling that what happened to jaime is considered a legitmate complaint by most while those of us frustrated with the shows adaptation of stannis are treated like petulant whiners"

"SeventySeven",2014-04-21,"did anyone else see her confrontation of brienne about her being in love with him this way because to me it was quite clear she was telling brienne back off hes mine i disagree in the episode cersei goes after brienne pycelle oberyn and ellaria and she finds something horrible to say to each and everyone of them i doubt they wanted to show cersei as being jealous of brienne she might be much prettier than in the books but shes still masculine and made to look fairly plain so id be surprised if cersei was telling brienne to back off â anyway the way the scene was in the books was grotesque and twisted enough without turning it into rape it was unnecessary â â i think that fits to my impression the way jaime acts is maybe best described as similar to an addict he desperatly needs her and he basically does everything to have her and keep he his whole life is arranged around her and being with her but in the end this love is making him do horrible things and turns him into a person he doesnt want to be this to me climaxes in this scene in the books and also now in the show i think its safe to assume that also in the show he will start to realize more and more now how being with cersei basically keeps him from being the person he actually would prefer to be â but theyre not playing it this way cersei dumped him he raped her how is she keeping him from being who he wants to be if anything shes the one wanting to be done with it because she feels guilty apparently edited by seventyseven 21 april 2014  0308 pm"

"King Belushi",2014-04-21,"after the show last night i knew i would come here to find people fretting over this discussion in my view the show is doing right to change the arcs of the book not only because it is a different medium but also as a source of entertainment for all the book readers out there who remain constantly surprised by the shows take on their familiar interpretationsâ â if tv jaime is a rapist it is a result of their previous whitewashing as to balance out the viewers vision on the character and so that goes for all the established characters in the series who are living out different experiences than those witnessed by us book readers of course we cannot expect dds interpretations of an event or character to be always in line with our own but we can be certain they are trying their best â i hold hope they will use this change as the catalyst for jaimes departure of kings landing for we do not have ways to reach an insight on jaimes head on tv therefore exaggerating his thoughts through actions â edited by king belushi 21 april 2014  0330 pm"

"Prince_Snow",2014-04-21,"i apologize to be so serious about that question but just to be sur everyone understand what is the definition of rape  â rape andor sexual assault is forced manipulated or coerced sexual contact by a stranger friend or acquaintanceâ it is an act of aggression and power combined with some form of sexâ a person is forced into sexual contact through verbal coercion threats physical restraint andor physical violenceâ consent is not given â if you have these 3 elements you are raped and if you do these you are a rapist  â penetration of any orifice by any object force or threat of force or sexual contact against the will of the victim and if it is someone you know like a friend your doctor a family memberetc its called â<U+0080><U+009C>acquaintance rapeâ<U+0080><U+009D> â there is no 51 rape 20 there is rape or no rape and you better know that guys ive heard a lot of stories in parties that ended in jail for yearsso please be aware and careful â so by definition jaimie has raped cersei its a fact"

"Faint",2014-04-21,"i dont know how viewers will feel about it but my own guess is that cersei will try seducing jaime in the next episode in a bid to have him bring her sansas head and the attempt will failâ it will be much like jaimes last chapter in a storm of swords only in that chapter cersei was asking him to kill tyrion much as she was in this episodeâ although now that i think about it there is no reason why she cannot request that again as well"

"Chebyshov",2014-04-21,"having watched the episode and the scene again i can see that they were probably going for ambiguity and subtlety but i think they botched the execution the supposed subtlety of the scene simply does not come across for most viewers looking at it the first timeâ â you have to watch quite closely to pick out the signs of cersei being a more willing participant than her words indicate they are there but you almost have to go through it frame by frame like a jfk conspiracy theorist analyzing the zapruder film if you have to do that to try to match what is on screen with what the director says he was trying to convey i think the director missed the markâ â i also think jaimes actions and motivations dont come through well it has been suggested that cersei stops the initial kiss to entice jaime into agreeing to her proposition that jaime kill tyrion and that jaime percieves this and this motivates his hateful woman comment and the ensuing action but i just dont see any sign of cersei being conniving here it looks more like she kisses jaime in a moment of weakness and then pulls back knowing she has forgotten herselfâ â this perfectly sums up my feelings about it i think it is a scene that will sit better in hindsight but that is not a good quality for a scene to have"

"Zombies That Were Promised",2014-04-19,"since balon is still alive in the show i think the kingsmoot and yaras presence there is all the more likelier so this is how i would do it â ep 6 yara attacks the dreadfort and fails to rescue theon gemma whelan was interviewed and said she filmed scenes with alfie allenâ ep 7 she retreats to moat cailin where she hears about balons death leaves ralf kenning in charge just like her uncle victarion did in the books ep 8 ramsay catches up to moat cailin reek parlays with the ironborn the ironborn are all flayed to death ep 10 ramsay and roose armies reunite my only problem is the finale is suppose to be one hell of a ride so maybe the flaying wont happen until this ep â season 5 kingsmoot probably episode 1 since victarion needs to start sailing to dany asap â i dont know if deepwood motte makes the cut but she does need to get captured by stannis after the kingsmoot â shell at least run away from euron and the husband shes forced to marry edited by zombies that were promised 19 april 2014  0626 am"

"lostinasia",2014-04-19,"well the show has gone wayâ further than martin did in showing ramsays brutality most of it is mentioned off page in the novels i agree that the show is displaying more of the violence but theyve developed another problem for themselves showramsay is too charismatic â not quite hannibal lecter but in that vein  hes someone who you know is a bad guy and hes doing terrible things but on the show hes somehow not as loathsome as he is in the books there are plenty of wow this guy is evil moments but i dont think theyve presented enough i want this guy dead moments  unlike joffrey who made himself more despicable and unlikeable pretty much every time he opened his mouth â but well see how it develops i thought the hunting scene that opened last weeks episode was good in showing his brutality and trying to pass on the villain torch"
"Hath4",2014-04-19,"well i think most book readers would say they hate joffreyâ more even though he doesnt hold a torch to characters like ramsay euron  the mountain thats because of his spoiled personality people can not stand the spoiled brat ramsay and euron are more psychotic and terrible but at least they had to work there way up unlike joffrey would was born with the silver spoon"

"zaphodbrx",2014-04-21,"well like all stannis fans i am upset about the ongoing portrayal of him on the show however while a lot of attention has been brought to that i feel that people have not discussed show davos that muchâ this is important to me i like stannis but i like davos too â showdavos has stopped making any sense to me over the course of the last season and a half i cant put my finger on it exactly the acting is good the lines are okay and its roughly the same character as the book its just that the circumstances are so different â nowadays he comes off as the lead henchman of a villain you know the ones who say youre running out of time and you have failed me for the last time and that type of crap i cant remember the last time we had an actually good stannis davos scene since the one on the boat in season 2 s3e8 came close but it was still just so different â consider for the moment davos is the hand of the king yet he doesnt have anyone to read and write on his behalf and he has to turn to shireen yes because she is a main cast member and needs screentime and that makes logic somehow not â i think the main problem here is the massive cutout of everyone else in this storyline kings men queens men justin massey roland storm maester pylos alester florent axell florent sallador saan and basically it seems like his entire army at this point is himself davos mel his wife and daughter and 3 random guards â want to have davos set gendry free well we cut out all the knights and saans lyseni so just have davos mumble some crap about a star and rush him out in a dinghy in a scene that makes no sense and basically leave him to starve or drown â want to show some burning well lets cut out all the stuff about alester and his treasonous behaviour and instead let him burn an infidel  oh and also change the name because who cares â and now davos is writing a letter to the iron bank in stannis name behind his back making him the beggar king v20  to beg money to buy mercenaries cause apparently his own army is all gone by now  no wonder as he keeps burning infidels  yknow the same kind of behaviour that got alester burnt oh wait shireen is writing the letter yeaaaah â â this is all just so messed up stannis had a scribe in season 2 you know and he can write his own letters i guess he burnt the scribe by now for being an infidel â oh and why would the iron bank support stannis exactly tv stannis is just some creep who burns infidels i know some people say that the iron bank will turn him down instead so then what tv stannis has no money and no army and no ships and how would it make sense for the iron bank to support him later on â i dont know where they are going with this but honestly i feel like they have screwed up davos storyline as badly as they have screwed stannis as well â and why exactly does tvdavos support tvstannis at this point i cant fathom the reason i really cant his son is dead  which is apparently the only reason he did all the stuff to become a lord  and let me remind youâ tv stannis is just some creep who burns infidels â"
"AzorAhai42",2014-04-21,"so based on what happened in the scenes at the wall and the fact that coldhands seem to be cut out of the show it seems like the nights watch is going to root out the mutineers at crasters keep instead of coldhandsâ â to me it seems like the timing for everything will be very tight and close if this is the way they are planning on doing things in the show your thoughts"
