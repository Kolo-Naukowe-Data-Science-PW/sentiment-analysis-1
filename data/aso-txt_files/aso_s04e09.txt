3	sj4iy	2014-06-08	10 out of 10, omg, that was so incredibly awesome...I never wanted it to end XD
4	boojam	2014-06-08	I didn't exactly predict that!
Ending!!
Neil Marshall gets a 10... but I was hoping he would be back next week.
Next week should have been 90 min. long!

5	sillent	2014-06-08	I did not think it would end that soon what the fuck. I don't know how I feel about the episode.. its like nothing happened.. like for an episode nine this felt VERY underwhelming
6	Ice_Specter	2014-06-08	Wanted to see Stannis's arrival on the wall but looks like they are going to extend that to the season finale.
Â 
Also, why are these episodes ending nearly 10 minutes early?

7	MoIaF	2014-06-08	It was a good episode overall, however, the ending was completely anticlimactic.  Honestly, I don't understand why they couldn't have ended it with Stannis, that would have rounded up this episode nicely. I did give it an 8 because it did go by rather quickly and it was entertaining.
8	FalseKnight	2014-06-08	Â This episode was like a bad dream. Dreadful. 0.00/100

LOL, now Stanboys are mad at the show for cliffhangers.
9	Fool of a Book	2014-06-08	Freaking awesome. Â One of the best 50 minutes of TV I've ever seen in my life.
10	Corvinus	2014-06-08	The episode was pretty good, up until the end, so 9/10. They cut it too short. Also didn't like the 2 non-book deaths, though they were appropriately tragic.
I don't know how they are going to do all that needs doing in the last episode. It better last one and half hours.

11	FNF	2014-06-08	I can only give it an 8 purely because we didn't get Stannis and it was so damn fucking short
Â 
So yeah, great episode apart from the ending which was garbage.

12	TheHouseHB	2014-06-08	I gave it a 9, would have given it a 10 if not for the strip tease ending.
13	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	A seven. No Stannis no 10's.Â
14	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	Where the frack is my Stannis?
Why Pyp and Green are dead?
Im a purist. Its a 6.
15	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-08	I wouldn't knock it because of the ending. They cut it short to make the finale INCREDIBLE! Why would you give a bad rating because Stannis isn't in the episode? It's not like they cut it. THEY JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO IT YET!Â

16	Jslay427	2014-06-08	8, no Stannis!Stannis!Stannis! Sucked. Good episode, but no Blackwater.
17	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	A seven. No Stannis no 10's.Â No Stannis no 10s.
18	Tears of Lys	2014-06-08	Meh. Wasn't my cup of tea, but I can see how others might like it.Glad to see we're going back to the intrigue for the final episode.
19	Obebb	2014-06-08	5, I just didn't really like itÂ  
Â 
So much hype built up "best battle ever" come on...
20	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I gave it a 9, would have given it a 10 if not for the strip tease ending.Stephen Dillane wasn't in the opening credit sequence, so I wasn't expecting him to show up.
21	nothatso	2014-06-08	On the positive side the giants and mammoths were great, the fight choreography seemed better, and some of the shots were really cool.
Â 
On the negative side I thought the romance scenes were corny, I don't like that they seem to have killed off three characters that yet live in the books, and that ending was way too abrupt. Also the episode started at 9:04 and ended at 9:52. Stupid.
22	Died a Hero	2014-06-08	10
Â 
It was amazing. You know it was amazing. I know it was amazing. It was amazing.
23	Carey Snow	2014-06-08	It needed 10 more minutes, but Ygritte's death was well done. A shame Pyp went down. Janos hiding like a coward was great. It was the fastest 50 minutes of TV I have ever seen. I gave it a 9.0 because it should have been 60 minutes.

24	tallTale	2014-06-08	I gave it a 9.
Â 
Another solid episode overall.Â 
Â 
Acting was great, action was great, the mammoths/giants looked great.
Â 
HBO is finishing off the season on high note.
25	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	The guard had plenty more than 100 men.
26	tito5601	2014-06-08	i give it a 8
27	ohpooratlas	2014-06-08	That was the most underwhelming episode 9 of the series.
Â 
I really don't know who is going to be left at the Wall after this.
Â 
I gave it a 6. Only good moments were Ygritte's death and Jon being a BAMF.Â

29	greywindsrage	2014-06-08	Mammoths, Giants and Ghost. Plus Sam being a BOSS. 10
30	Rayn	2014-06-08	Too much romance, Ygritte being Legolas was a bit much. WAY TOO SHORT.
Also where do all the nights watch guys come from? They all seem to die and more come out of the woodwork. MORE THAN 100 BROTHERS THERE.
Still pretty solid. 7.5/10 for me.

31	the_dentman	2014-06-08	Horrible horrible horrible ending.. If they followed to stannis it may have been best episode ever.. Now it's maybe a 7 for be.. Books killed tv in this battle
32	Ser Blake	2014-06-08	It was absolutely perfect..... Until they cut it off....
Â 
I don't get it
33	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-08	It gets a solid 10 from me. That episode kicked ass.
34	boojam	2014-06-08	CiarA!n Hinds is in only one episode!Gezz that's weird.
35	ToTheWolves	2014-06-08	Jon: "I need him more than I need you"
Me: who is he talking about........GHOOSSTT!!!
36	Karmarni	2014-06-08	Gave it a 5. Battle was actually boring, despite the hype. Ygritte, too melodramatic, especially the music. Wished for more Ghost. Sorry to see Grenn and Pyp go.
37	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-06-08	Surprised we didn't see Stannis yet. Overall, 8 out of 10.
38	rmholt	2014-06-08	I didn't like much about it. I thought it could have been a  lot better. Just the basics: with the gate defended the battle was over. I liked the scythe given the climbers but would rather have had the turtle - suspense - the stair fire - and I can't even fathom how Pyp and Grenn became dispensable.  I did like the desperate energy of the wildlings. Since the battle was just pointless anyway (the Wall was to protect all people against the White Walkers) at least the show could have made an awesome performance.  I had a hard time figuring out where people were until I decided the elevator was actually a transporter.
No Blackwater.  7

Yeah Stannis us coming. I corrected for that.
40	Mark Antony	2014-06-08	9 
Ending pissed me off and they killed Grenn  at least he had an epic death but overall I was quite entertained. No blackwater though
41	Nictarion	2014-06-08	A 9 for me. I think "Blackwater" was better, but they did a damn good job with this one. I loved that we got the giants riding mammoths! Grenn and Pyp dying was surprising. Jon Bradley was great, he kind of stole the episode imo.
42	A Man Reads	2014-06-08	But . . . but . . . "Stannis!"?Â  
Â 
We had 20 minutes of dialogue. Followed by 20 minutes of fighting. Followed by 5-10 minutes of Tormund Husband of Bear in chains and Jon's "mission." I had hoped they would cover more ground tonight.
Â 
The fight scenes were very well done. Lots of great camera work and it was well coordinated. Aliser Thorne, Tormund, Ygritte, Jon, and Grenn had strong episodes. I suppose the CGI money went into giants? Ghost's scene was quite limited. The dialogue was noticeably lagging though.
Â 
It felt like they were half-way between a movie and TV show and forgot about the story.Â 
Â 
7 for now. Maybe revised on rewatch.

44	Ser Conky of Sunny Vale	2014-06-08	I only gave it a 10.Â 
Â 
It was soÂ disappointing because there were minor, inconsequentialÂ differences from the book, and Stannis, with another separate battle scene,Â and with all the lead-ins required for that, doesn't show up until nextÂ week.Â  Â Â

Praying this is dealt with appropriately
47	Darth Pipes	2014-06-08	10.
Â 
That was how it ended?!
Â 
Er...sorry about that.Â  The quick ending aside, this was a really impressive hour of television.Â  Not as good as Blackwater storywise but definitely surpassed it in terms of action.Â  Great job!
Â 
I was sorry to see Pyp and Grenn die too but at least they went out in a good way.
Â 
Loved getting to see Peter Vaughn as Aemon...that man never disappoints.
Â 
Owen Teele also shined as tonight and his fight with Tormund was awesome.Â  We didn't see Ser Alliser die so I would assume he'll live to see another day.
Â 
Good job by Kit Harrington...the character of Jon Snow really shined.Â  I did love how he utilized some dirty fighting against the Thenn.Â  Same with John Bradley and I'm glad he was part of this battle.Â  Loved him dropping an F bomb.Â  He might have been the MVP tonight.
Â 
Will miss Rose Leslie a lot.
Â 
Some really impressive action pieces and FX.Â  Nothing with the Giants disappointed, especially the one who fired an arrow all the way up to the top of the Wall.Â  That was awesome!
Â 
I can appreciate letting the Wilding situation go on another week and build things further but without Stannis's appearance, I agree this episode lacks from the other Episode 9 ones.Â  It wasn't a game-changer.Â  But next week's episode sure as hell will be and I think that's the key.
Â 
Next week is going to be a series-long 66 minutes and they are going to need it...that episode has a LOT to pack in.

48	Aldi_AA	2014-06-08	5 no stannis they can't put him in the beginning of next ep that's BS he should have had his triumphant episode ending moment now it's just gonna be a scene no one talks about because of all the other stuff that will happen in episode 10.
49	Howling Mad	2014-06-08	Very good. The adapted Ygritte death scene was excellent. Making Slynt out to be a coward was well done. The attack at the gate good but not great. However they missed once again when it comes to putting the direwolves on screen. Ghost should of had a more prominent role. Â Â
50	Zman1863	2014-06-08	I gave it a 9. It was close to a ten.
Â 
I haven't had many qualms with deaths for the show that don't happen in the books, but Grenn and Pyp hurt, even if they were both well done. I also understand that GRRM pretty much writes them out of ADWD when Jon goes all "A Commander can't hang with his boys". My reading of that was to put them out of danger for whatever mayhem breaks out in Castle Black in the wake of Jon's assassination. But maybe they won't figure into the story very much in the future even if they are alive.Â 
Â 
My other criticism is maybe a pacing complaint. The buildup might have lagged a bit in the beginning. I loved the middle section with the initiation of the attacks. But then it seemed to lag despite the action going on. I think they might have tightened it. I'm not sure it would have been enough time to have a Jon/Mance scene and Stannis's arrival, but maybe.Â 
Â 
Overall it was quite entertaining. They do very well when they can focus an episode, as occurred in Blackwater.Â

51	Dave Grose	2014-06-08	I thought this was a strong episode. I hope Neil is just their go to for battle episodes! I loved the scythe! Great addition. I thought the changes were actually beneficial in this episode, but I don't particularly like Jon walking out alone to meet with Mance. But, let's hope it's somewhat interesting. I was really hoping to see a certain person. I don't want to include spoilers, but I really wanted to see the end of this battle like it occurred in the books, but I understand the size and scope of such a thing in ONE episode.
Whew, I'm rambling. Good episode. Like a breath of fresh air after the previous episode's disappointments.
52	darksellsword	2014-06-08	It was a 10 for me if you can't give this episode a 10 then there's very little point to you watching the show because it was amazing!!! , I hope people remember this is not a spoiler free thread, and when things that you think should of happened in this episode happen in the next I hope you all will be big enough to come back here and raise your vote to a 10.

53	Knight of Ashes	2014-06-08	8 from me. Grenn (I believe that qualifies as a good death, if there is such a thing under those circumstances) and Pyp dying gave it that unpredictable feel. And so dId Dolorous Edd taking charge. 
I kinda wish they'd deviated and have TV Ygritte survive and be taken prisoner. Her death scene was rather generic. And so was Maester Aemon's "I was a young man once" speech.
But way to go, Sam.
54	FalseKnight	2014-06-08	It was absolutely perfect..... Until they cut it off....
Â 
I don't get it

They set out to tell the story of the first night of the battle and set up the battle north of the wall. They picked the natural break in the story.
55	Lonely_Wolf	2014-06-08	I loved the episode it was very well done. For all those that say the ending was anticlimactic, I say it was the opposite. Since his "betrayal" was dismissed earlier, the show needed another way for Jon to go to Mance. It was well written and it was very action packed. I liked how they concentrated all their efforts on the wall in order to really highlight the importance of it.Â 
Â 
As for Stannis coming to the rescue that would need a whole entire episode which I'm guessing would be next season. I haven't seen the preview for next week yet so I'm not sure.
Â 
It was an adrenaline rush for me and very emotional towards the end. Very well executed.Â 
Â 
I gave it a 10/10
Â 
Edit: Just saw the Preview....I guess it's next week then

56	DreamSongs	2014-06-08	I felt like this episode topped 'Blackwater' in S2.
Â 
I'm not a big fan of 'The Wall' story line on the show, but with this episode it came alive.
Â 
I was glued and my eyes didn't leave the screen for a second. Â The first 10 minutes was waiting for a Lannister scene. Â After the first 10 minutes, I just didn't care anymore because I was so engrossed.
57	sati	2014-06-08	6. Worst since Mhysa
58	LordStoneheart	2014-06-08	I... I don't know.Â 
Â 
I'm at such a loss for opinion here. there were some great visuals, great acting, the fight scenes seemed choreographed well enough, though its not my strong suit to judge... but why does it feel so underwhelming? If they tried to recreate Blackwater, I think they failed. I don't know exactly where its off... but if my sister who doesn't read the books actually hated it or felt cheated of a good episode, I think something is definitely wrong..
Â 
I give it a four for that anticlimactic ending, useless death of Grenn, very messy battle scene in the front of Castle Black, and the useless death of Grenn. I know I repeated myself.... Oh, and one more reason. the death of fucking Grenn!!!!!! RAAAAGGGGGEEEEEE!!!Â
59	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-06-08	I loved it. Loved that they devoted the whole episode to the wall. Gave it 9 only because Pyp & Grenn died which sucks
60	awesome possum	2014-06-08	First episode of the entire series I find myself disappointed with and underwhelmed by.Â
61	rmholt	2014-06-08	Â 
Eh, the Battle wasn't pointless. The Wildlings needed to be stopped, no matter the cost.

Riiiiight -- why? 
I guess that's why they didn't let them through later on. It was an error passed down over millennia. Books basically are a series of misunderstandings. Why did a lot if huge things happen? Bad assumptions, bad info, misunderstandings.

76	Cold Feet	2014-06-08	Kinda pissed Stannis didn't roll in, but I felt like I was having a fucking heart attack during that battle. Some of those death were really creative and well done. 
Giants riding a Mammoth? Kick ass. Pretty much every scene with the giants, my heart raced
77	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-08	My first 10/10 for an GOT episode. Still laughing at so called bookreaders thinking stannis shows up at the night siege when he comes during the day siege lmao.
78	ToTheWolves	2014-06-08	Ok assuming what we all expect to happen in episode 10 it would seem they have more than enough material to have a good finale. With that said I don't see why they save the stannis arrival for next episode. It could have very well fit in this one and I think it would've been great but hey who knows why D&D do the things they do...we should all tweet them.
But! I actually enjoyed the episode though
Going to have to learn that D&D can and will do whatever they like though.
79	Carey Snow	2014-06-08	Horrible horrible horrible ending.. If they followed to stannis it may have been best episode ever.. Now it's maybe a 7 for be.. Books killed tv in this battle

In the books, Stannis does not come the first night either.
80	Grizzly Mormont	2014-06-08	wow. silliest episode of the season; probably silliest of the entire show. they lost something in focusing the whole show in one place.Â 
Â 
however, the giants were awesome. the kid killing annoying redhead was awesome. I like how he looked at jon like "yeeeah, bitch, i got this!"Â

jon's die hard roll out of the elevator was cheesy. but ghost was badass.Â
81	John Hulboy	2014-06-08	I liked episode Jon killing  Thenn was good.little disappointed it ended after 52 min there is too much to  happen in last episode.ended too soon
82	BrettStark	2014-06-08	As a book reader this was one of my fav episodes of the season, had tremendous dialogue and action.
Â 
Why are people claiming they are upset that Stannis didn't come? In the books he didn't come until the Mance/Jon meetup anyway. lol, people will complain about anything, even when they're wrong.Â

Â 
its funny, during the first 4 seasons all I ever heard from friends/family/forums was that there wasn't enough fight scenes. We finally had a full episode worth of one giant battle and people are complaining. People have a right to their opinion, but damn, I don't understand how anyone could have disliked this episode. I've read the books twice and watched each episode like 3 times at least, this ranks in the top 5.Â
84	Whatsthedillio	2014-06-08	Where did the budget for this episode go? Â On the ferocious CG battle of the 3 giants and 10 climbers in front of the wall? Â Perhaps Neil Marshall bought a real forest to burn down.. we did see some nice scenes of trees burning.
Â 
Where are these "100,000 wildlings?" Â I saw like a 100 dudes standing around some trees. Â If there's an army, I want to see it. Â I used my imagination just fine when reading a book, I don't want to use it when WATCHING A TV SHOW.
Â 
Fortunately though, we got a slow motion action shot of John holding Ygritte, /gag. Â terrible.
Â 
According to George RR Martin:Â 
"Tomorrow night, on HBO. Neil Marshall returns, with a battle even bigger than "Blackwater." Should rival or surpass any battle ever seen before on television. Keep your swords sharp."

Um What? Â There wasn't even a battle north of the wall, and we got a crap battle of 40 people south of it. Â Perhaps if you only watch "Keeping up with the Kardashians" and "16 and Pregnant" than yes, this was the biggest battle ever seen on television. Â Otherwise, it was crap.
Â 
Â

Â 
Id rate this lower than a 1 if i could.
85	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-06-08	As a book reader this was one of my fav episodes of the season, had tremendous dialogue and action.
Â 
Why are people claiming they are upset that Stannis didn't come? In the books he didn't come until the Mance/Jon meetup anyway. lol, people will complain about anything, even when they're wrong.Â 


They are complaining that the episode ended before that happened. You're the one who is wrong.
86	BrettStark	2014-06-08	Where did the budget for this episode go? Â On the ferocious CG battle of the 3 giants and 10 climbers in front of the wall? Â Perhaps Neil Marshall bought a real forest to burn down.. we did see some nice scenes of trees burning.
Â 
Where are these "100,000 wildlings?" Â I saw like a 100 dudes standing around some trees. Â If there's an army, I want to see it. Â I used my imagination just fine when reading a book, I don't want to use it when WATCHING A TV SHOW.
Â 
Fortunately though, we got a slow motion action shot of John holding Ygritte, /gag. Â terrible.
Â 
According to George RR Martin:Â 
"Tomorrow night, on HBO. Neil Marshall returns, with a battle even bigger than "Blackwater." Should rival or surpass any battle ever seen before on television. Keep your swords sharp."

Â 
Even in the books the battle wasn't just one massive thing, Mance sent multiple small/medium sized forces at the wall. In the books we don't see Stannis until Jon's "treat" with Mance. Seriously, how could the show have done a better job at portraying the battle of castleblack besides a full 2.5 hour motion picture? They did a brilliant job. People are just haters.Â

Huh, well, at least we may know why episode 10 has the highest $/second sequence in the show, those horses ought to cost a lot.
88	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	I was ready to give it a 10.
Â 
But 8, because Stannis.
89	StrollofShame	2014-06-08	I was soooo expecting Stannis, I nearly wet myself with excitement...but it might have looked a little too much like Helms Deep in that big movie trilogy for comfort, if that'd happened. It will come. I can wait. 
I can't believe any episode of GOT made me scream in frantic support of Aliser Thorne. For that, plus the end of Ygritte, I say 10.
90	BrettStark	2014-06-08	They are complaining that the episode ended before that happened. You're the one who is wrong.


Â 
Lol, people complain there wasn't enough action, how the hell would you have liked them to fit the entire battle, then the delay (Jon goodbyes), treat with Mance, Stannis arriving in one episode. People's expectations are seriously flawed. We'll get that next week, ugh.Â

Â 
This is a show that has dialogue, they had to buildup Sam's feeling of loss before Gilly came back. They also had to make Jon reminisce about Ygritte before tonight's climax of Ygritte dying.Â 
Â 
It was obvious tonight's episode's climax was going to be Ygritte's death.Â

People aren't haters. There was a mammoth, a few wildings and two giants. Oh wow. Pfft. Extremely disappointing. I'm not a Stannis fan so his not being in this episode isn't a big deal. But this battle was hyped up and it just did not deliver. Did not deliver. That's not hate. That's a fact.
96	Baltan	2014-06-08	A 7.
Â 
It had great moments, like Ghost Time!, and Grenn telling Janos he was needed downstairs. And the SCYTHE 
Jon's speech with Alliser was fine, too, and didn't betray the relationship, so kudos for that.
Â 
So, a big  for the scripters for changing the plot a little bit and still getting a coherent and flowing story but for Jon leaving LongClaw with Sam.
Â 
But this episode left me feeling meh. And it was not only me, my (unsullied) family also felt the same way. Like if the cliffhanger was left at an odd moment: Jon crossing (unarmed) the Gate.
Â 
A whole episode dedicated to the Wall and it felt like it was not enough, that it needed to close some plotlines before the finale (that's going to be clogged with all the other plotlines getting their closure/cliffhangers). I really thought this was going to be the last episode this season to feature the Wall, hence a little more of of the plot advancing.
Â 
I don't know, maybe I'll review my scoring after a rewatch with the whole season finished.

Hence why people are hating jackass. Â This was supposed to be a battle episode, and instead we got to hear about Sam's extensive thoughts about sex instead of actually showing battle sequences. Â If thats what you'd rather watch, then well, I really dont know what to say.

Going to watch it again before rating it.
Â 
Fabulously entertaining TV on it's own merits but impossible to not judge vs the books. However Thorne was AWESOME. The few CGI effects were perfect, but left wishing they had done the Wall true justice throughout the season. Â Make it the siege the books had. Â No turtles, scarecrow Brothers. A missed opportunity for truly brilliant TV. Â As the book was of the battle, brilliant storytelling

102	OnlyOne	2014-06-08	It was a 10 for me if you can't give this episode a 10 then there's very little point to you watching the show because it was amazing!!! , I hope people remember this is not a spoiler free thread, and when things that you think should of happened in this episode happen in the next I hope you all will be big enough to come back here and raise your vote to a 10.

No way I'm ever voting this episode a 10. I gave it a 7 and that's too generous.
103	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	^The charge will be next episode. The battle that we got already was good.


It was good that is why i gave it a 7. Â But surely you also agree that Stannis should have been in this episode.
104	Ser Creighton	2014-06-08	God that sucked, I know some people liked it but that sucked. Major battle? 20 guys in the yard fighting a lot of guys on the wall standing around and looking, no sense of urgency. And the Wildlings use the worst battle plan ever. The attack consisted of 4 guys climbing the wall, 1 Mammoth, 2 giants and maybe 5 or 6 guys storming the gate with them or poking the mammoths ass with their spears. The guys on the wall killed more of their own than than Mance did. And Mance actually breached the wall with that force. Are you kidding me?
This was all about the battle in the yard where the Wildlings seem to slaughter the 20 men defending it over and over. Yig got 20 kills by herself. Ghost was totally wasted, Ghost vision, quick shot of his mouth, then a long shot of him eating. Apparently Jon needed Ghost to kill one Wildling really badly. Thought Sam was cheesy, don't care if Grenn or Pip die, Gilly is still annoying and can't act. The forward or backward role seems to be the wildling standard for fighting. Jon was ok and had a decent fight scene, thought Thorne was the best in the episode. Honestly just did not feel much emotion it felt bland. CGI was decent, nothing special, really just kind of blah about the whole thing. Nothing really happened except a few secondary characters die who have no emotional attachment too on the show. The cliffhanger I new was coming, and I get it but that doesn't mean it works all that well.
One thing I really couldn't stand was the wildling line, at no point did it look 100,000 strong, maybe 5000 which you know is fine, but for most of the episode whenever they showed them, they were standing there growling and snarling grrrrr, grrrrrr harg, snarl. Was the direction ok guys I need you to act like idiots. And what are they growling at, the men of the Watch are 700 feet up, they can't see your face, you like ants to them and they probably can barely hear you. Some stood there snarling and got shot, and about 10 seconds later after the third or 4th guy gets nailed they all act shocked and back up. This was suppose to be bigger than the Blackwater? Not even close, not even in the ball park.
I give it 4 because Jon and Thorne were solid, it had some solid CGI here and there but for the most part  everything around them sucked. Low energy, no emotion, bad acting. And that was not a battle is was friggin skirmish in the training yard.
I am glad some liked but it just did nothing for me, this is episode 9 and that was boring.

105	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	Well, since I'd hyped that along with the rest of you, Stan, I felt crestfallen that it didn't happen, but that's because I feel I might've shot my credibility by saying something incorrect over and over. There were enough signs that Stan's arrival would be in the Children that I should've put more thought into.
Â 
Anyways Stan, someone can make a youtube edit of the battle and tag Stan's chargeÂ on the end. So, in the end we get it all the same.

106	DreamSongs	2014-06-08	I liked that Stannis did not arrive in this episode. Â It gave clarity to what may come with the Others and how the Wildlings and the Westerosi must join together. Â If Stannis had arrived during this episode, it would have diminished the impact of BOTH...the joining of a common enemy AND OF STANNIS' attempt to join all together.
Â 
I think leaving Stannis' arrival at the Wall with reinforcements AFTER this episode makes sense and shows a savvy man who knows how to be a king.
107	Martini Sigil	2014-06-08	People who hated this episode should just stop watching.... The show is different from the books.... get over it.Â

112	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-08	10!!  great battle scenes, would have liked to see them actually kill the Giant, but the anchor that sliced through the wall made up for that, that was the coolest death scene i have ever seen.  The way some of the scenes were shot, were shot like the end of episode 4 I think of True Detective when Cohle is running through that gang neighborhood.  I don't see how anyone could score this episode less than an 8, even if it didn't happen like this in the books, enough of it did in my opinion, and to those who graded lower than 5's I'd say.....you know nothing Jon Snow.

Predictable how, some parts were, like the kid killing Ygritte as soon as he looks at the bow when Sam is being raised up to get Jon, I instantly thought he would kill Ygritte when I saw that so yeah that was very predictable, but what else?
117	WexPyke	2014-06-08	The entire feel and the take homes were dead on from the books. That is a good thing. Did you think Yuri the would survive or the inner gate fail? Jeepers.

I just don't want a boring drawn out episode.  I wanted a decent climax-- which the book gives & this episode could have.
There was no reason to have a drawn out episode when they still have lot of story to wrap up.
Did enjoy Mammoth & Giants & kid killing Ygritte.

The episode was great until the ending. Would have liked to see Stannis save the day instead of the unnecessary cliffhanger. Looks like Dolorous Edd lives to fight another day, could he be taking Bowen Marsh's place? Also, I consider Stannis taking the back seat to Davos, Melisandre, and now Jon Snow sort of a book spoiler. Seems that his character is not important enough to develop, so wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't survive the Boltons in TWoW. Disappointing.

Yeah i agree with this. I hate how people bitch why are they giving this episode low when they are giving ten's. I have only given two tens to any GoT and they were Blackwater and Rains of Castamere.
122	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-08	LOL at all you sour grapes!!!! Reading your reviews you would think this episode was complete garbage, but the ratings look pretty great to me.Â
123	DreamSongs	2014-06-08	It was the kid smiling at Jon that made it clear.
Â 
I am not disagreeing that the emotional parts were sappy. Â I feel like the episode resolved a very complicated plot at the Wall and left an appropriate entrance for Stannis.
Â 
eta: Â Yes, I tend to be a book purist. Â Yes, the show sometimes pisses me off. Â The sept scene proves that. Â But I do like how they have things set up now for Stannis, Davos and Mel to take over the Wall with their determination and vision. Â If it doesn't happen in the S4 finale, then it should happen the S5 premiere. Â JMHO

124	jarl the climber	2014-06-08	I gave it a 7. It was a good in some parts but it sort of lacked some coherency. Why establish that the Giants can shoot arrows the size of spears up to the top of the Wall and then not resolve that somehow? Why did the Giant stop when the results seemed to be so devastating? If they killed the Giant archer why not show it? it would have been cool if they showed the battle between Grenn and Co. and the Giant. I hated the Ygritte death scene, it was a little melodramatic, that and there was still a battle raging, it didn't make sense for Jon to start grieving under the circumstances. Her getting shot and him coming across the body after the battle was over would have worked better. Thorne was good, I'm not sure about the Slynt being a craven storyline. Have some other minor nitpicks but I'll leave it there.
125	ladyinblack	2014-06-08	I gave it a 4 and feel guilty for rating it that high...really was looking forward to this over hyped battle!! how could they have made such a mess of thingsÂ Â  went completely off the story again. D&D --you are not good writersÂ Â  leave it alone.
Â The whole great story of north of the wall, wildings, giants, the WWs and wights...totally f--ucked up.
Â First the cannibal Thenns---the Thenns have an amazing story so why do that?? cannibals??..Alistair Thorne fighting mano y mano to save the wall...Dolorous Ed not being Dolorous EdÂ Â  Grenn dying Pyp dyingÂ Â Â Â  the whole thing was so stupid I was screaming at the TVÂ Â  Janos Slynt hiding?Â Â  one of the worst episodes ever

The attack consisted of 4 guys climbing the wall, 1 Mammoth, 2 giants and maybe 5 or 6 guys storming the gate with them or poking the mammoths ass with their spears. The guys on the wall killed more of their own than than Mance did. And Mance actually breached the wall with that force. Are you kidding me?
This was all about the battle in the yard where the Wildlings seem to slaughter the 20 men defending it over and over. Yig got 20 kills by herself. Ghost was totally wasted, Ghost vision, quick shot of his mouth, then a long shot of him eating. Apparently Jon needed Ghost to kill one Wildling really badly. Thought Sam was cheesy, don't care if Grenn or Pip die, Gilly is still annoying and can't act. The forward or backward role seems to be the wildling standard for fighting. Jon was ok and had a decent fight scene, thought Thorne was the best in the episode. Honestly just did not feel much emotion it felt bland. CGI was decent, nothing special, really just kind of blah about the whole thing. Nothing really happened except a few secondary characters die who have no emotional attachment too on the show. The cliffhanger I new was coming, and I get it but that doesn't mean it works all that well.
One thing I really couldn't stand was the wildling line, at no point did it look 100,000 strong, maybe 5000 which you know is fine, but for most of the episode whenever they showed them, they were standing there growling and snarling grrrrr, grrrrrr harg, snarl. Was the direction ok guys I need you to act like idiots. And what are they growling at, the men of the Watch are 700 feet up, they can't see your face, you like ants to them and they probably can barely hear you. Some stood there snarling and got shot, and about 10 seconds later after the third or 4th guy gets nailed they all act shocked and back up. This was suppose to be bigger than the Blackwater? Not even close, not even in the ball park.
I give it 4 because Jon and Thorne were solid, it had some solid CGI here and there but for the most part everything around them sucked. Low energy, no emotion, bad acting. And that was not a battle is was friggin skirmish in the training yard.
I am glad some liked but it just did nothing for me, this is episode 9 and that was boring.


This. So much.
129	Whatsthedillio	2014-06-08	People who hated this episode should just stop watching.... The show is different from the books.... get over it.Â 
Â 
I love the books as much as anyone, but Stannis wasn't supposed to show up yet anyway....Â 
Â 
The production was incredible... Jon's coming out party.... great episode for anyone who doesn't have sex with their Stannis doll

141	Inquisitor Eisenhorn	2014-06-08	Haters are in full force huh? They should just shut up and deal with it.
142	Ruin	2014-06-08	The battle sequences in Blackwater were more epic, probably because it involved Stannis cutting down Lannisters.Â  With that said, I did enjoy the episode.Â  I'm not a big Jon Snow fan: both the actor and the character, but he was really good in this episode.Â  Also Thorne, and even Janos.Â  Those complaining about Janos should find something else to complain about.Â  The Sam/Gilly/love convos ran a little long, would've been able to give more screentime to Ghost.
Â 
And poor Tormund.....
143	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-08	Man come on dudes, you at least have to admit the anchor part was bad ass.
Yeah, it was. But emotionally it was pretty wooden.  Total waste of Maester Aemon.  The staging overall for the attack and fight were pretty bad.
Husband : A bunch of Hillibillies attack a giant ice wall.  The Blackwater was 100 percent better.

Edd with his anchor chain of doom was badass. Im sad about Pyp and Grenn but those guys ended up being composited. Grenn being the Donal Noye was kinda awesome though....

No im sure Stannis is in episode 10. I just meant i think the episode wouldve been received better with Stannis at the end.

Jon was ok and had a decent fight scene, thought Thorne was the best in the episode. Honestly just did not feel much emotion it felt bland. CGI was decent, nothing special, really just kind of blah about the whole thing. Nothing really happened except a few secondary characters die who have no emotional attachment too on the show.

One thing I really couldn't stand was the wildling line, at no point did it look 100,000 strong, maybe 5000 which you know is fine, but for most of the episode whenever they showed them, they were standing there growling and snarling grrrrr, grrrrrr harg, snarl. Was the direction ok guys I need you to act like idiots. And what are they growling at, the men of the Watch are 700 feet up, they can't see your face, you like ants to them and they probably can barely hear you. Some stood there snarling and got shot, and about 10 seconds later after the third or 4th guy gets nailed they all act shocked and back up. This was suppose to be bigger than the Blackwater? Not even close, not even in the ball park.

154	melisandre3000	2014-06-08	9.5/10 if I couldÂ  
Â 
I'm a sucker for the Wall and this episode really did it for me. Thorne was great, Jon's dueling down the stairs was perfect and intense. Ghost was a total boss as usual. As great as Blackwater was (it was GREAT), I felt the impact of this battle so much more by the end of the episode.Â 
Â 
They could have shaved off a few minutes in the beginning with the Sam/Jon conversation but I did like how they eased the viewers into the conflict. I love Sam/Gilly but that also took up just a little too much time (the kiss though! Mack Daddy Sam). So not perfect editing but it was pretty muchÂ 
Â 
Also, Jon may be no poet but that scene of him holding Ygritte as she died with the flames in the background couldn't have been more poetic. Beautiful shot that will stay with me.Â
155	gandalf.ohwaitwrongseries	2014-06-08	VERY disappointing. A 6, because I'm trying hard not to be a book purist, and judge the show for the show. Otherwise it'd be closer to 1 or 2. But even then, this episodes is short, underwhelming... just feels empty. 
D&D really screwed up big time this season. The whole Wall plotline is an utter mess. So much screentime wasted on non interesting fillers (Craster's, the first 20 min of this episodes, ...), that now they're force to postpone Stannis arrival to the final episode (which bothers me, not because I'm a Stannis fan (which I'm not, I don't even like the guy), but because next episode is clearly going to be very overwhelming, while this one wasn't enough.)
156	Mr Smith	2014-06-08	Well, colour me disappointed... but on the other hand, this does set the season finale up to be the most epic episode in GOT history.
Â 
I think I'll give this one an 8.5, bumped up to a nine, because the overall episode was quite good, and most of my disappointment stems from the fact that I know what comes next.
Â 
For a while I thought they were setting Sam up to kill Ygritte, which I thought would have been a good twist, but nevermind.
Â 
Wasn't particularly keen on the first 5-10 minutes, but the rest was generally very well done.

Â 
Unfortunately though, I have enough brains to fill a teaspoon, so I am not willing to accept that 10 wildlings breach the wall that has stood for 1000s of years. Â That's not a minor detail, its a huge plot flaw, and it was sheer laziness and/or incompetence by the creators.
Â 
And since you don't like nitpicking things, as you said, why don't you go nitpick your patients instead of other peoples opinions.

First we get the scene where Ygritte tells everyone she'll kill them if they go after Jon, then she just ends up standing there while he fights Styr. Then we get Maester Aemon recounting his bachelor days as hot young Targ. So 2 completely wasted scenes from the jump. Once things get going it was great, but ends too soon and nothing gets resolved, so -1 for what was NOT there. Final grade: 7

you guys are weird humans to give what you just watched a 5 - so perhaps the best CGI battle sequence in history gets a 5 because Green died? Fuck off

There are only 3 major things left that are needed, 1 of which we aren't even sure is gonna happen, that's plenty of time.
163	VermithorSunni	2014-06-08	I thought this was a strong episode. I hope Neil is just their go to for battle episodes! I loved the scythe! Great addition. I thought the changes were actually beneficial in this episode, but I don't particularly like Jon walking out alone to meet with Mance. But, let's hope it's somewhat interesting. I was really hoping to see a certain person. I don't want to include spoilers, but I really wanted to see the end of this battle like it occurred in the books, but I understand the size and scope of such a thing in ONE episode.
Whew, I'm rambling. Good episode. Like a breath of fresh air after the previous episode's disappointments.


Â 
I see there are a lot of Stannis fans here, but in the books Stannis doesn't arrive on the first night of the battle. Â Donal Noye holds the gate and the morning comes. Â This is what happened in the book. Â Why are people so disappointed? Â Stannis arrives later. Â The Wall is attacked, Jon takes command and repels the wildlings. Â That's an event. Â It was great to see Jon swinging Longclaw.
Â 
Jon was BAMF. Â And Sam, too.
Â 
RIP Pyp and Grenn. Â

166	IlAovatar	2014-06-08	5/10 
Â 
Big action packed battles do nothing for me, and i'm not the sort to be wowed by special effects. Could have done without all the romance crap too, and the cheesy dialogue.
Â 
That said, I was expecting much worse. They didn't go overboard turning Ygritte and Tormund into hollywood badasses as I thought they might. I was also very relieved they didn't kill off Alliser Thorne.
Â 
I'm sure a lot will be disappointed Stannis didn't show up to save the day in this episode, but honestly, that would have been too rushed and anticlimactic. I think it's better this way.

Did you miss the part where Jon explains that this was a preliminary force to test the strength of Castle Black and that eventually their numbers would easily overwhelm the NW? They didn't send 100k.


Yeah the whole point of the frontal assault was to set up the attack from the South, the attack from the North was just a diversionary tactic. I agree that this criticism is unfounded.Â

I see there are a lot of Stannis fans here, but in the books Stannis doesn't arrive on the first night of the battle. Â Donal Noye holds the gate and the morning comes. Â This is what happened in the book. Â Why are people so disappointed? Â Stannis arrives later. Â The Wall is attacked, Jon takes command and repels the wildlings. Â That's an event. Â It was great to see Jon swinging Longclaw.
Â 
Jon was BAMF. Â And Sam, too.
Â 
RIP Pyp and Grenn. Â  


Because Stannis fans are the loudest group of malcontents on the internet. Let them throw a hissy fit, its actually funny to read.Â

You don't obsess over every episode? Â Funny, you post about every one, yet this is the first time I have EVER complained about an episode.. I've never even posted yet you have almost 2000 posts. Â I like your logic, and seeing as how you lack any, I can understand why you enjoyed this episode.
Â 
Unfortunately though, I have enough brains to fill a teaspoon, so I am not willing to accept that 10 wildlings breach the wall that has stood for 1000s of years. Â That's not a minor detail, its a huge plot flaw, and it was sheer laziness and/or incompetence by the creators.
Â 
And since you don't like nitpicking things, as you said, why don't you go nitpick your patients instead of other peoples opinions.


Posting isn't nitpicking and I think I have maybe gotten 25 posts in this season...and the majority of those were admittedly because I was disenchanted with the sept scene. I have been on and off this board for over a decade. Â I'm sorry that you did not enjoy the episode.
Â 
I was simply pointing out that not everyone wants to analyze everything down to CGI as you do. Â I watch the show for pleasure. Â That does not make me 'illogical' as you claim. Â And if you are paying as much attention as you claim, you would understand that the point of the attack was that it occurred on multiple fronts.
Â 
You are the one that put your brain in a teaspoon, not I.
174	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	I gave it a 10. There were some pretty big sections that I wasn't crazy about, but I thought some pieces of it were just so, so excellent.  I thought the Ygritte buildup was terrible, but Jon, Thorn, Grenn, and Sam (and even little Oilie - only the closed captioning said Oily, ha!) were terrific, also poor Pyp and Sam.  Loved Maester Aemon's reminiscing about his lost love.  Thought the scythe was just awesome.

Im only worried because I feel episode 10 will be very rushed.Â
177	Ran	2014-06-08	Gave this one a 10, by the by. Although I do not consider it the best episode of the series, it's among the best, and it really beautifully put together action and character beats.I admit, I am shocked at the reaction from those who became wholly wedded to the idea that Stannis was going to show up to save the day. Ya'll need to re-read the books and consider why GRRM decided to have the Watch successfully hold off the wildlings for awhile before Stannis's arrival. It serves a very different purpose than when the Lannister-Tyrell host saves King's Landing at the last minute (hint: where does the credit go?)Having Stannis in the next episode is pretty accurate to rhythms of the novel, in allowing Jon and the Watch to have the full weight of their sacrifices given some meaning rather than having it undercut by a Johnny-come-lately.
178	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-08	Lets ignore the fact that this is being filmed in two weeks on a television budget. Please show anything on television that approaches this episode.Â 

Totally agree and...
Here's the thing, this series wasn't made for ASOIAF fans, it was made to attract those who aren't.  ASOIAF fans may bitch and whine about it not being like the books and being crap, shitty production and blah blah blah, but you know what, they'll be tuning in next week.  The idea is to attract as many people as possible, stay as true to the plot as possible, and squeeze as much as you can into 10 episodes.  
I'm not gonna complain, I thought the only episode this season that wasn't all that good was the Cersei Jaime rape/incest/sex episode.  All the rest were great, coming from a book reader.

Yes, but Blackwater episode was much better compared to this. This felt underwelming.
Â 
Â 
But again, Blackwater episode was shot in a real location and only the explosion was CGI, there was more CGI involvement in this one I think so they had to cut from other things.
181	Oberoth	2014-06-08	For the battle of castle black/ thewall it was very rushed. It was pretty much a giant firing three arrows and mag lifting the gate. Although it is just a 700ft wall of ice, so there isn't much to do if you have swords or axes. I suppose thats why they combined the assault on castle black with the battle for the wall. Pip & Grenn died. Sam heavy episode.
Â 
Meh it was good apart from the last two.
182	Mark Antony	2014-06-08	9 heads of the Ned out of 10. Kinda wanted the Stannis ending but oh well.
Â 
Edd with his anchor chain of doom was badass. Im sad about Pyp and Grenn but those guys ended up being composited. Grenn being the Donal Noye was kinda awesome though....
Thinking about it I don't mind them going out fighting compared to being dumped off by Jon Snow cause he was being a baby

186	roxWolfox	2014-06-08	I gave this a solid 10.
I gave Blackwater an 8, and the Red Wedding a 9.
The reason this got a whole point extra was for Neil Marshall (you Dog Soldiers devil, you) making me cheer for Alliser Thorne.Â  Never in my wildest nightmares/dreams would I have done so until tonight.Â
187	teej6	2014-06-08	Â 
Did you miss the part where Jon explains that this was a preliminary force to test the strength of Castle Black and that eventually their numbers would easily overwhelm the NW? They didn't send 100k.  
Yeah, I was thinking the same. Jon clearly makes that point.

189	Ran	2014-06-08	There is absolutely nothing in Vikings or Rome with the sustained action of this episode. Spartacus, maybe, but not those two. From the first man dying to Tormund being dragged off is over 20 minutes of sustained action. The battle between the Vikings and the English from last season was impressive, but that lasted all of three minutes.Of course, calling it "The Battle for the Wall" is a misnomer. It was never a battle, in the books, nor here. It's a siege, and that's what we see in that part of the fight.

While I think both sides go a bit extreme, the show isnt bad. Just a bit off the deep end this season. Of course im complicated. I bitch about what the show messed up then decide I like certain things they changed lol
191	Juan_Snow	2014-06-08	I give it a 9. I really liked the episode. I thought the pacing was good and it had some really good moments. Jon killing the Magnar was great. Ghost on a rampage was awesome. Unfortunately as soon as the episode ended I knew I would have to sift through page after page of bitching from the cult of Stannis. Kind of ruined my enjoyment.
192	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-08	I gave it 6. It seemed all over the place and not as epic as it should have been. They also wasted a lot of time with filler.
193	Defeatarion	2014-06-08	I think the show has created some "purists" of its own. How does wishing a certain even being in the episode to make it better make someone bitching?

Exactly. Â There are some things that the show does very well and others where I am less than happy. Â My angry point this season was the sept scene; some people have hit the angry point with this episode. Â Ultimately, you have to accept that this is an ADAPTATION of the books and will never match perfectly. Â 
Â 
And yes...its OK to be angry and dislike the episode. Â I quite enjoyed it since this is a story line that I typically gloss over and only know it well via multiple rereads. Â I felt that they did a great job of pulling everything happening at the Wall together. Â JMO.

This episode was incredible for me, and I am critical of the show when I need to be, I cringed at some of the Gilly/ Sam scenes, but this episode more than made up for the shit bits with bits that had my jaw drop and bits that moved me quite a bit( Grenn, Ygritte, Pyp)

197	teej6	2014-06-08	I gave the episode a 10. The acting/action sequences were all good. But I must say when it ended I felt something was missing. The episode was really good but had they built up the Wall story in prior episodes it would have been even better. Then, they could have ended this with the Jon/Mance parley and then Stannis riding in. I guess they wanted it to be a Jon Snow centric episode, which btw Kit handled quite well except for his reaction to Ygritte's death. And the music wilding attack music was epic.
198	Ran	2014-06-08	Blackwater went some 26 minutes before anyone died. None of this stuff was filler, in this case. Taking time to use Pypar as a focal point for the fear many felt, and as a way to understand how Samwell was dealing with it, and for showing us Alliser Thorne dealing with the tribulations of command, and so on -- they're important when you're putting lives in jeopardy, as they're a way to reinforce whatever connections people may have.Now, that said, had the writers done the smart thing and skipped the Craster nonsense and left Jon and co. at Castle Black, and given us more of a story about the tensions there, about the people there, maybe these pieces of characterization would have been stronger for some, or maybe they wouldn't have needed so much of it (though really, I doubt they were going to make it 45 minutes of non-stop action).
199	mickyd	2014-06-08	VERY disappointing. A 6, because I'm trying hard not to be a book purist, and judge the show for the show. Otherwise it'd be closer to 1 or 2. But even then, this episodes is short, underwhelming... just feels empty.D&D really screwed up big time this season. The whole Wall plotline is an utter mess. So much screentime wasted on non interesting fillers (Craster's, the first 20 min of this episodes, ...), that now they're force to postpone Stannis arrival to the final episode (which bothers me, not because I'm a Stannis fan (which I'm not, I don't even like the guy), but because next episode is clearly going to be very overwhelming, while this one wasn't enough.)


Â 
Â 
agreed 100%. Â Makes me very afraid for next season, when the plot lines, locations (and characters) expand substantially. Â I afraid season 4 was just the prelude to season 5 and perhaps the material just beyond being the ability of the producers to do well. The saving grace of the show are the actors, this season for me was the actors covering the asses of the producers. but I wonder myself just how much further that will carry me along if Season 5 was as bad, with unnecessary plot diversions and creations thus leaving little time to expand important and necessary canon plot lines.
Â 
Just my two cents!

Â 
This is what is my main problem. For almost four years, the Wall didn't have its proper moment, Jon's storyline was handled as it is almost secondary, and this year, it showed more than any other. The supporting ensemble in any other subplot, like Bronn, Shae, Brienne and Podrick in KL or Missandei and Greyworm in Essos are all fleshed out. Wall characters simply weren't. There was something lacking in the characterization that would make this episode be as memorable as the Blackwater was.Â 
Â 
There was a moment of pure gold in cinematic way when the camera almost flowed through the courtyard focusing on each element of the battle. But, it was too short and not enough... This wasn't nearly as epic as they made it sound.

True. The book is the standard and the show falls WAY short of the book too often. It's disappointing because they only get one shot at this. I doubt there will ever be another adaptation at ASOIAF.Â

Pyp and Grenn?
218	metr0man	2014-06-08	Enjoyed the episode but they haven't built the Wall storyline well enough for this episode to really mean something. I think the episode ended too early as well. Had it ended with Stannis it would have felt like a proper end to an epic battle.

All the build-up and interviews the actors and director gave made it sound like "this will be the best television you will ever see." The amount of hype was just too much..

Maybe when rewatched as a whole season finished it will feel "smoother".
221	Daenerys Must Die	2014-06-08	9/10 for me... thoroughly enjoyed it although my initial reaction after the cliffhanger was a bit of disappointment .. Some episodes you find yourself waiting for one moment, and when the moment doesn't come/or doesn't deliver, there's a sense of letdown as opposed to reflecting on what was good about it.
222	Quillon	2014-06-08	Â 
I think GOT did a great job with this episode in terms of their action scenes.Â  I will say that Vikings does a great job too.Â  Their battle sequences are amazing.


Only the last battle was good in Vikings, other battles needed more men, they were like people bashing/shieldwalling each other on a 10 meter line for most of the time.
223	Brother Walfrid	2014-06-08	6
Very underwhelmed, felt too piecemeal for their to be any tension,,,at no point did I feel they were fighting for their lives.
Given that the whole episode was at the wall,,why was there no climax?  Poor decision making
224	boojam	2014-06-08	Blackwater went some 26 minutes before anyone died. None of this stuff was filler, in this case. Taking time to use Pypar as a focal point for the fear many felt, and as a way to understand how Samwell was dealing with it, and for showing us Alliser Thorne dealing with the tribulations of command, and so on -- they're important when you're putting lives in jeopardy, as they're a way to reinforce whatever connections people may have.Now, that said, had the writers done the smart thing and skipped the Craster nonsense and left Jon and co. at Castle Black, and given us more of a story about the tensions there, about the people there, maybe these pieces of characterization would have been stronger for some, or maybe they wouldn't have needed so much of it (though really, I doubt they were going to make it 45 minutes of non-stop action).The 'battle' comprises 3 chapters of SoS (sort of) , as I remember, one is the assault from the south which was not exactly coordinated with Mance's attack.So I did not see how they could fit that all in.It seems we got most the repulse of the attack from the south and some of the assault on the Wall.There is a natural , sort of break, between Jon IX and Jon X , but I sort of expected Neil Marshall would finish of the sequence in Jon X... unless he directed it and it's next week, but HBO does not usually allow that kind of thing.I am satisfied with this episode... but , man!, only 5 extra min. next week to jam in all the rest of the arcs?Unless something something from SoS is being moved to next season?I sort of expected they would have keep more of Jon's few friends for the future, now we are running out of 2nd-ary actors!(That's weird)I swear at the end of the southern CB attack seemed there should have been about 5 crows left! That's kind of movie thing, always more wounded than killed does not fit film cannon.Neil Marshall is a fine action director but I noticed some of movie cliche ... all hell is going on.. and , what PAUSE for those lines to be said.If only Sam Peckinpah or Akira Kurosawa could have directed this episode! Naw they would have butted heads with HBO!

225	mickyd	2014-06-08	Just watched it a 2nd time Going with a 6.
Â 
For pure entertainment a 10, it really did have Â me on the edge of me seat at least the first time, Â though the ending still sucked and sucked even more the 2nd time around.
Â 
Â 
As a book reader a 2, and the ending REALLY sucked. It didn't have to be Stannis arriving (but could have should have if they had pacing the plot better, and perhaps spread out Â the events of ep. 9 and starting it earlier thus having his entry be the climax of the episode) but still felt wrong. Make it be the siege it was rather than the apparant Wall attack being a handful of people and 1 or 2 of the 100's of giants and mammoths Mance had. Total loss of the epic scale the book had.
Â 
btw Â Hopefully sometime soon we will have seen the last of emo-Jon.
226	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	Â 
You may want to grab a kleenex and cry it out, because 'haters' have as much a right to post as you do.


Â 
Focking right.
Â 
Negative opinions are also allowed.
227	jaeherys	2014-06-08	You guys are saying "book purist" like that's a bad thing. Why is pointing out the flaws in a very flawed show so angering? "Book purist haters" are definitely more annoying at this point and are defending a low quality product. Or perhaps you're all too sensitive and can't accept that this show is a poor representation of superior books?Â 


Â 
The problem with this attitude is that Game of Thrones is now the most successful series in the history of HBO.
Â 
So, regardless of whether this adaptation fits into your narrow view of what you believe is a "quality" product, it is indeed a quality product as indicated by the sustained success and weekly viewership.
Â 
Perhaps you are the one that is being too sensitive and can't accept the fact that the series is a wild success despite it not comporting to your narrow view of what makes for "quality" television.
228	ctid1977	2014-06-08	I thought it was an awesome episode.
Â 
What I loved:
Â 
I loved all the love on the minor characters showing the scale of the battle.
Â 
Thorne; great to see a three dimensional arsehole for a change, I loved him telling Jon how it is. He has the voice for battle (a la Robert Baratheon), and his speeches were all fantastic. I don't think he's dead either which makes me happy.
Grenn and co shouting the vows at a rushing giant.
The scythe looked class.
Pyps death and Sam being a hero.
I loved Tormunds capture too.
Ygritte; I was welling up as much as I was when I read it, really well done.
Ghost, what can I say.
Even the giant going mad when the other giant died was cool.
Â 
What I didn't love:
Nothing. It was ace.
Â 
As for not finishing on Stannis, well I liked it, it worked for me and I'm a Stan fan. It was a bleak finish, perfect set up for the last episode and great to focus on the Nights Watch. The fighting, direction and cinematography were epic for me, that panoramic shot showing Jon, then Styr, then Ygritte, the Tormund and finishing on Sam was just class.
229	Queen Whore	2014-06-08	9 because that was as close to an "all Jon Snow, all the time" episode as you're goingÂ  to get and I have been starving for some Jon Snow being his true book self. Several parts emo, at least one partÂ badass.Â It seemed like the previous episodes with him and Ygritte were dragged out terribly, whereas this one was pretty perfect for their interaction. Also, other than Pyp and Grenn (why oh why was there no Donal Noye?!) I thought it played out as pure as it could given some of the other twists that D&D have added in.
230	Haldebrandt	2014-06-08	Impressive action and visuals + Boring characters and story == Mildly entertaining, mostly underwhelming episode.
231	Bilbo Swaggins	2014-06-08	6/10. Would have had a 9.5/10 if they had Stannis!
232	Ran	2014-06-08	... as indicated by the sustained success and weekly viewership.Argumentum ad populum. Michael Bay, Adam Sandler, Justin Bieber have sustained success and enormous amounts of people willing to pay money to watch their films or listen to their music, but this doesn't actually say anything about the artistic merits of their work.I'm a book purist. I want them to hit the same highs as far as their budget and time and technical constraints allow, or to approach the spirit of those highs. For my part, they succeeded here, but I can see a couple of ways it could have been even better. Others feel much more strongly about those things, and that's their right.
233	Ser Creighton	2014-06-08	Yeah i agree with this. I hate how people bitch why are they giving this episode low when they are giving ten's. I have only given two tens to any GoT and they were Blackwater and Rains of Castamere.

Well you probably did that because they deserved it. You know some people like Bieber and Cirus, in fact a lot of people apparently. Keeping up with the Kardashians  and Honey BooBoo are hit shows. This tells you two things, Darwin was wrong, and a lot of people have really bad taste and will like just about anything that trends. Generally I find they don't even know why they like that stuff, but they will become obsessed with it, lose perspective then lash out at anyone who challenges their self induced misconception of what's good or bad in order to maintain the delusion that they are like everyone else and therefore excepted.
234	rmholt	2014-06-08	I thought it was going to be Sam too. Or maybe Pyp haha

I wanted Ygritte to change her mind and box the Thenn
235	DreamSongs	2014-06-08	I gave the episode a 10. The acting/action sequences were all good. But I must say when it ended I felt something was missing. The episode was really good but had they built up the Wall story in prior episodes it would have been even better. Then, they could have ended this with the Jon/Mance parley and then Stannis riding in. I guess they wanted it to be a Jon Snow centric episode, which btw Kit handled quite well except for his reaction to Ygritte's death. And the music wilding attack music was epic.


Â 
Did you also note the cycling of characters? Â It was like they did a panoramic view with characters stepping in and transferring to scenes as they went on fighting or dying within the music. Â It was probably one of the more spectacular scenes choreographed on-screen for home television.
Â 


Enjoyed the episode but they haven't built the Wall storyline well enough for this episode to really mean something. I think the episode ended too early as well. Had it ended with Stannis it would have felt like a proper end to an epic battle.


Â

Exactly...this empty feeling leaves us ready for something...or someone...who can truly take charge because Jon Snow hasn't become that person. Â 
Â 
The person that can step up and save the Wall now is Stannis. Â And I am OK with waiting until next week or next season to see that! Â If he had appeared in this episode, it would have been predictable. Â I am glad that they filmed this the way that they did. Â Technological CGI errors and all.

236	BeornJ	2014-06-08	10. Absolutely loved it. There was nothing I didn't like, and some of the scenes were amongst the best of the series. The Scythe, the great 360 crane shot of battle, Grenn inspiring his brothers while a giant charges at them, Jon killingÂ a Thenn, Sam offhandedly killing a Thenn, Sam's great speech about becoming 'nothing'.
Â 
I was surprised Stannis didn't arrive this episode but in the end I'm glad he didn't.Â It gave a chance for the Night's Watch to be heroic, to continue fighting when all seems lost, then, when defeat seems inevitable, for Stannis to arrive.
Â
237	rmholt	2014-06-08	Wanted to see Stannis's arrival on the wall but looks like they are going to extend that to the season finale.
Â 
Also, why are these episodes ending nearly 10 minutes early?

To butthurt me.
238	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-08	It's a good thing Jon didn't win the LC vote by 2 or less.
239	teej6	2014-06-08	Â 
This is what is my main problem. For almost four years, the Wall didn't have its proper moment, Jon's storyline was handled as it is almost secondary, and this year, it showed more than any other. The supporting ensemble in any other subplot, like Bronn, Shae, Brienne and Podrick in KL or Missandei and Greyworm in Essos are all fleshed out. Wall characters simply weren't. There was something lacking in the characterization that would make this episode be as memorable as the Blackwater was.Â 
Â 
There was a moment of pure gold in cinematic way when the camera almost flowed through the courtyard focusing on each element of the battle. But, it was too short and not enough... This wasn't nearly as epic as they made it sound.

Mladen, now here I agree with you. They could have had the audience more invested in these characters. But still, perhaps, you are rating the episode a bit too harshly.
240	BearQueen87	2014-06-08	I'm finding it hard to rate this one. I gave it an 8 overall, which is high, but it was a hard vote.
Â 
On the one hand the battle itself was great. Very dramatic! I loved all the giant stuff. I thought the 6 NW brothers saying the vow as a giant was charging at them was quite touching. The non-book deaths were shocking and gut-punchy. The death of Yigritte was expected, obviously and I thought it was done well and I'm glad they kept the final words
Â 
However...there was an obvious end to this episode and it didn't come. Had they spent less time in the beginning gearing up for the battle, we could have had the entire battle for the Wall in this one episode. So now we have to delay and have an JAM PACKED finale and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Worried, I guess.
241	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-08	It was a good episode overall, however, the ending was completely anticlimactic. Honestly, I don't understand why they couldn't have ended it with Stannis, that would have rounded up this episode nicely. I did give it an 8 because it did go by rather quickly and it was entertaining.


I agree the episode really could've used Stannis's arrival. Episode 10 is going to be absolutely insanity as it is. Why did they feel the need to push Stannis up?
242	DreamSongs	2014-06-08	I'm finding it hard to rate this one. I gave it an 8 overall, which is high, but it was a hard vote.

243	yushkevitch	2014-06-08	I try to rate episodes based on it's own merits, not based what I expected or wanted to see as a book reader. So I'm clearly not part of the "Where was Stannis?" crowd, many of whom clearly gave a bad rating simply because their hero didn't make an appearance...
Â 
So, judging the episode for what it was - basically a 1-hour action scene - it was extremely well done. I'm too tired to post all the points I liked but I thought the scale of the wall, the fight scenes, the pacing, the choreography, even most of the dialogue were spot on. And thankfully the Ygritte dying scene didn't stretch on. I am very happy she's gone forever.
Â 
Solid 9, maybe only the 2nd time I've given that high of a score this season.
244	Ser Redjed	2014-06-08	8/10Â 
Â 
Too Damn Short!
245	Bridgeburners	2014-06-08	6.
Â 
So it didn't infuriate me as much as the last episode with its shitty writing/dialogue. It was what it was supposed to be - a full battle episode. I was okay with the changes they made as they had to, but premature RIP for Pyp and Grenn. However it doesn't come close to Blackwater (still my favourite episode). There wasn't much tension with these characters (as many have mentioned, the wall is a very under-developed plot in the show). It just didn't seem as compelling overall. Plus it's a little too bad they couldn't put much more in the budget of the siege on the wall, with the besieging army. That certainly didn't exhibit the scale it was supposed to.
Â 
Certainly not the best GoT episode, but at least it didn't piss me off with shitty writing enough times.
246	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-08	10/10
Â 
Badass from start to finish. I was entertained the entire time and it never really slowed down, even during the talking bits. Don't give no shits that Stannis has to wait till next episode, I'm just glad the NW bros got their time to shine. A shame two of 'em are dead, but at least they went out fighting - Grenn especially. I don't mind that Grenn was given Donal's role, t'was a pretty badass execution. Definitely the best episode overall this season, and I'm really surprised I don't even have one complaint.
247	Into the Weirwood	2014-06-08	Based on my raw excitement throughout the entire episode, putting all "this-was-not-like-the-books" criticism aside, and for the fact I actually found myself cheering for Ser Alliser Thorne at one point (which I never would have expected to do), I give it a 9. I think they could have explored a little more the huge advantages of the Wall during the battle.
248	Mladen	2014-06-08	Mladen, now here I agree with you. They could have had the audience more invested in these characters. But still, perhaps, you are rating the episode a bit too harshly.


Â 
The funny thing is that I still haven't rated it... For me, this episode fell short where the Blackwater stood out. Those pauses between battles in Blackwater were stand-out scenes, here it's more of a mush of characters that weren't fleshed out. And that is the consequence of the mistreatment Wall subplot had to endure for the past, well, almost 3 years, especially this year with endless supply of fillers. There were good moments here, but generally this was Blackwater-wannabe episode that simply didn't bring the small moments that made Blackwater so memorable...Â
249	Eira Seren	2014-06-08	Gave it a 10.Â  It had a lot of surprises and the fight scenes were very satisfying.Â  Nice moment where Grenn starts quoting the NW oath.Â  Can't believe they killed him and Pip.
250	Starksmustwin	2014-06-08	I Gave it a 10 because it left out that idiot stannis.
					
					
							Edited by Starksmustwin, 08 June 2014 - 11:58 PM.
251	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-06-08	Well they were going for a Helm's Deep vibe here and in that they succeeded minus the climax. Sure it would have been more satisfying with Stannis ending but i'll reserve final judgement untill after we see the next episode. I'm REALLY HOPING the Stannis charge doesn't happen at the beginning but anywhere on the second half would be great ESPECIALLY if it's the last scene (I'm almost certain there's no LS reveal because the promo seemed to show Brienne meeting the Hound instead )
252	KalibakCruel	2014-06-09	Loved the episode, my only nitpick is that it was too damn short. I won't get at no Stannis as there's one episode left. This episode was great though. Awesome camera work, pacing, fight scenes were great, giants/mammoths looked downright awesome.
Â 
And it actually makes it so episode 10 isn't just a boring "tie up until next season" episode like last years.
253	Jon Black	2014-06-09	10/10
Â 
Strangely, this is the first time I've given back-to-back 10's.
Â 
I loved it despite not getting Stannis and the two (most despised) deaths (for myself). Â As usual, I'm basing my rating off of what it was and not what I wanted it to be. Â Sure, no Stannis, but there is plenty of time and they are sticking pretty close to the books and how things played out with this battle at the wall. Â So, really, why complain?? Â They don't ever really leave us with cliffhangers so It was a nice change of pace.
Â 
Anyhow, phenomenal episode. Â

This "epic" battle scene?Â 
Â 
The White queen, Da Vinci's Demons, Rome, spartacus, Camelot, Vikings, I could go on
Â 
This show had a $60 million budget this season, more than most movies. Â There's no excuse.


 Â Um no, that's basically Indie movie budget these days.
255	Quillon	2014-06-09	I agree the episode really could've used Stannis's arrival. Episode 10 is going to be absolutely insanity as it is. Why did they feel the need to push Stannis up?


I think this is all of wall we see this season, this episode ended in a way like a season finale(for the wall), they killed grenn&pyp to make room for new characters(Val and Queen Selyse's men). And we never saw Mance in this season, even in this episode. I don't think we'll see him in the next neither. This episode was full of NW, next will be full of KL and a bit dany, enough insanity there will be, aye

You said it. The pauses between the battle in the Blackwater episode involved Sansa, Tyrion, Cercei, Sandor... characters the show has spent time fleshing out. Yes, I completely agree with you on that point. But if you look at this episode as a Jon Snow killing the boy and becoming a man journey, it works, perhaps not perfectly. The action sequences were far more coherent and better executed in this episode than in Blackwater. Overall, I still liked the episode and Kit Harrington is finally beginning to look the part of Jon Snow. Can't wait for his and Dillane scenes next season.
257	Unbowed Unbent Unhodor	2014-06-09	Geez some of you are really harsh. That was awesome! 10/10. Stannis isn't even that great haha. Sucks that Pyp died but I expected Grenn dying since we saw him in the preview coming up against the giant. Will we be introduced to new nights watch members that become friends with Jon or will he have no one?
258	Knight of Ashes	2014-06-09	Never mind (point has been made)
					
					
							Edited by Knight of Ashes, 09 June 2014 - 12:45 AM.
259	Dragonglass Order	2014-06-09	9. Â Most of it was very good, and my eyes were glued to the screen. Â But... no Stannis. Â I don't know why they decided not to have a big climax this episode when there's so much more that has to happen next episode.
260	sj4iy	2014-06-09	The battle sequences in Blackwater were more epic, probably because it involved Stannis cutting down Lannisters.Â  With that said, I did enjoy the episode.Â  I'm not a big Jon Snow fan: both the actor and the character, but he was really good in this episode.Â  Also Thorne, and even Janos.Â  Those complaining about Janos should find something else to complain about.Â  The Sam/Gilly/love convos ran a little long, would've been able to give more screentime to Ghost.Â And poor Tormund.....Â Well, Tormund's not dead  Whoo! And this way we'll get more Tormund with him as Jon's prisoner. I thought it was badass how Jon handled him, though...that was great.Â Yeah the whole point of the frontal assault was to set up the attack from the South, the attack from the North was just a diversionary tactic. I agree that this criticism is unfounded.Â Thank you! Glad someone noticed Jon very explicitly saying that.Â Gave this one a 10, by the by. Although I do not consider it the best episode of the series, it's among the best, and it really beautifully put together action and character beats.I admit, I am shocked at the reaction from those who became wholly wedded to the idea that Stannis was going to show up to save the day. Ya'll need to re-read the books and consider why GRRM decided to have the Watch successfully hold off the wildlings for awhile before Stannis's arrival. It serves a very different purpose than when the Lannister-Tyrell host saves King's Landing at the last minute (hint: where does the credit go?)Having Stannis in the next episode is pretty accurate to rhythms of the novel, in allowing Jon and the Watch to have the full weight of their sacrifices given some meaning rather than having it undercut by a Johnny-come-lately.Completely agree. This episode was about the Watch and Jon, not Stannis and his "Here I come to save the day!" last-minute heroics.
261	About the Other Knight	2014-06-09	I give the episode an 8, as a lover of the book I don't see why the night's watch wasn't better prepared for the attack and had Mole town survivors aid in the battle. The nights watch was aware of the wildlings attacking Moletown. I wish I knew how the writers make their decisions when to stray from the book. Sometimes it works, other times it leaves me wondering why its necessary.(like the Thenns being canibals) The action was great and the episode did fly by, i kept waiting for Stannis's charge. I didn't like the fact that Jon came up with the assassination plot against Mance, it seemed out of character.Â
262	BarriStannis	2014-06-09	Definitely a 10. The mammoths/giants looked amazing and there were a lot of good lines/speeches from tonight.
Â 
Outstanding performance by all the actors, especially Owen Teale and John Bradley, lines were very well written too. As much as I liked Pyp and Grenn, I can understand why they had to die as they don't do much after the battle/during DWD, apart from being shipped off to Eastwatch.
Â 
Disappointed because of the lack of Stan the Man, but at least there will be enough time to properly show the Jon/Mance negotiation and Stannis saving the day in the finale

263	Eurymalys	2014-06-09	I liked the episode a lot. I also agree with a good deal of the criticism that has been offered in this thread. There have been valuable observations offered on either side: negative criticisms (such as those of the scale of the battle, which I quite agree with) and positive criticisms (the marriage of character/action beats). The least valuable criticism I've seen so far is that which has targeted the people offering arguments rather than the arguments themselves.
Â 
For my part, the episode as a whole worked. However, I think the Wall plot line could have been tightened so that some of the moments that were forced to occur here could have been implemented more smoothly earlier. But this complaint concerns episode 10 more than it does episode 9: I'm just worried that pushing Stannis' appearance into episode 10 is cramming even more into an episode that's already brimming with incredibly important stuff.Â
264	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-06-09	So long as there's no filler moments next episode, No Ls reveal, and no Eyrie. Then it can be done. One or two scenes for Dany. One for Bran. One or two for Arya. One or two for our long-awaited Stannis (and hopefully not rushed right away in the first five minutes of the episode!) then everything else in KL.
265	BearQueen87	2014-06-09	Gave this one a 10, by the by. Although I do not consider it the best episode of the series, it's among the best, and it really beautifully put together action and character beats.I admit, I am shocked at the reaction from those who became wholly wedded to the idea that Stannis was going to show up to save the day. Ya'll need to re-read the books and consider why GRRM decided to have the Watch successfully hold off the wildlings for awhile before Stannis's arrival. It serves a very different purpose than when the Lannister-Tyrell host saves King's Landing at the last minute (hint: where does the credit go?)
Having Stannis in the next episode is pretty accurate to rhythms of the novel, in allowing Jon and the Watch to have the full weight of their sacrifices given some meaning rather than having it undercut by a Johnny-come-lately.


Â 
That's a good point but that puts a lot of pressure on next weeks episode to give quite a bit of story. Condensing to get Stannis there NOW means that they can spend more time on the final S4 arcs next week. It's a lot of story to put into one episode, and I think that's where my biggest criticism is coming from right now.
266	roxWolfox	2014-06-09	You said it. The pauses between the battle in the Blackwater episode involved Sansa, Tyrion, Cercei, Sandor... characters the show has spent time fleshing out. Yes, I completely agree with you on that point. But if you look at this episode as a Jon Snow killing the boy and becoming a man journey, it works, perhaps not perfectly. The action sequences were far more coherent and better executed in this episode than in Blackwater. Overall, I still liked the episode and Kit Harrington is finally beginning to look the part of Jon Snow. Can't wait for his and Dillane scenes next season.
267	Seneti	2014-06-09	9/10. Was hoping for Stannis' arrival, but I'm okay with getting that in ep. 10. Otherwise, great episode.
268	Hodor's Dragon	2014-06-09	I give it a 7. Â There was some good action, but I'm not a big action fan. Â As for good conversations and good acting, very little. Â Even the nice scene with Maester Aemon didn't really work for me, because they were starting to get deep enough into what I already knew was a 50-minute episode that I was distracted by wondering how they'd get everything in. Â Turns out they couldn't.
Â 
There were definitely some high points. Â The fire, the scyth, the giants. Â Alliser humanizing himself a bit and stepping up in the clutch. Â The night's watch chant in the tunnel. Â Sam laying a big smacker on Gilly. Â Harrington is good at sword-fighting. Â They managed to make it relatively clear that the Wall was being defended from both sides, not so easy in a night battle.
Â 
But there were problems, too. Â Hell yeah, it was anti-climactic. Â Devote an episode to something, you want to make it a story to itself and I think viewers rightfully expected to get some resolution to the battle. Â And didn't, not at all. Â Nobody ever told Jon Snow the Wall was his, and while I'm usually the kind of sucker you throw a cheesy death scene at, Ygritte's was a little too schmaltzy/predictable. Â The unstoppable giant arrows that just stopped. Â Obvious technical issues with direwolf-human combat that means the 2 such "battles" we've scene this year both consisted of a direwolf blur steamrolling some guy from the side and wham bam, thank you ma'am, that's the entirety of what you call a human-direwolf fight. Â And I'd think with 104 guys to defend, somebody in charge would at least be estimating at some point how many had already bitten it and how many were left - I mean obviously, a big chunk of 104 will fight no more just from what we saw on TV. Â Also, as has been pointed out in this thread with pictorial evidence, Mance Rayder's gigungous wildling army was totally underwhelming. Â It seriously looked like there were more people attacking with Tormund and Ygritte from the south.
Â 
It was pretty good, but a cut below most of what we've seen during this outstanding season.

270	Ser Creighton	2014-06-09	This is what is my main problem. For almost four years, the Wall didn't have its proper moment, Jon's storyline was handled as it is almost secondary, and this year, it showed more than any other. The supporting ensemble in any other subplot, like Bronn, Shae, Brienne and Podrick in KL or Missandei and Greyworm in Essos are all fleshed out. Wall characters simply weren't. There was something lacking in the characterization that would make this episode be as memorable as the Blackwater was.Â 
Â 
There was a moment of pure gold in cinematic way when the camera almost flowed through the courtyard focusing on each element of the battle. But, it was too short and not enough... This wasn't nearly as epic as they made it sound.

I agree with most of that, though they did more than one panning shot and on a couple of them people were not doing a whole a lot and that bothers the hell out of me. Blackwater went some 26 minutes before anyone died. None of this stuff was filler, in this case. Taking time to use Pypar as a focal point for the fear many felt, and as a way to understand how Samwell was dealing with it, and for showing us Alliser Thorne dealing with the tribulations of command, and so on -- they're important when you're putting lives in jeopardy, as they're a way to reinforce whatever connections people may have.Now, that said, had the writers done the smart thing and skipped the Craster nonsense and left Jon and co. at Castle Black, and given us more of a story about the tensions there, about the people there, maybe these pieces of characterization would have been stronger for some, or maybe they wouldn't have needed so much of it (though really, I doubt they were going to make it 45 minutes of non-stop action).

I think leading up to the battle things were going pretty good, I liked some of the quiet tension at castle Black. But did not care for the Gilly scenes and although I have enjoyed Aemon in the series what little of him there has been, I thought that scene was unnecessary. Thought Thorne was good too.
But as pointed out by others the Well has been the second class citizen of the series, and they have not developed a lot there with the characters, and have wasted time on things like Crasters. Then they go out and promote it as the most epic battle on tv ever? Seriously just shooting themselves in the foot. As it goes the show goes like this, Tyrion and KL number 1, Dany number 2, Arya number 3, the Wall 4th, Stannis 5th. and when Robb and Cat were alive they were number 2 in the order of importance. At no point have they ever put a lot of stock in the wall so as a viewer why should anyone invest.
Season one episode 9. Baelor the Death of Ned Stark, for fans who had not read the books this was the OMG moment of omg moments.
Season 2, Episode 9. Blackwater, that's all you really need to say. The opening shot  blows up a fleet of ships with a giant green fireball. Dink was amazing.
Season 3, Episode 9, The Rains of Castamere, it's the red wedding the entire country was talking about this, well at least inn the states.
Season 4, Episode 9, The Watcher's on the wall. I now see why the title is so appropriate to this episode. The death of Pyp and Grenn, yes thee Pyp and Grenn. And Grenn got the honor of getting done off screen. Seriously I am not a die hard Stan fan, but it really could of used the arrival. Honestly I think casual fan probably saw Jon go out the gate and was like I hope he dies so we don't have to waste any time up following this arc anymore because it's so damn boring most of the time.
Do you think anyone will speak about this episode the way they did about the other 3? And that was not in any way shape or form the greatest anything on tv ever. That skirmish and that's what I call it because that is what it was lacked emotion, energy, action, drama, and investment. And the barrel poking scene? Of all the pathetic things in the world to do. Or the giants at the gate, how the hell do you drop 150 gallons of oil on top of them and they don't get burned at all, The Mammoth got burned and it was 30 ft away, all the men got burned, but the giants? What was this the second miracle, were they hatching dragons eggs?
You know it's fine that Jon says Mance is just testing the watches defenses, that's fine. It was a horrible plan to test a defense but whatever. But they hyped this up as like it was going to be a major battle, sorry but I feel lied too, and even a character on the show basically referred to it as probing. Not to mention the cliffhanger, really what was that? It's not like he got stabbed or anything, he is walking out a door by himself and it's going to last all of a week. Not like anyone is going oh my god they killed off Jon, he's in next weeks episode preview.
Honestly it felt pointless, and to waste 20-25 minutes trying to rush job some character development in the hopes of generating a connection with the general viewing public is a mistake, and something they shoulld have been doing for the last 3.8 seasons. Sorry but I don't need extra Shea scenes or Theon getting fixed and tortured over and over, I don't need to see Ros developed for no reason at all, while actual characters at the wall get shit for the better part of 4 years. They develop pointless crap with non characters that most people don't give to shits about for years and ignore the Wall, really? The god damn wall, Jon Snow and the Watch. I know the first book is called A game of thrones but the actual series is not all about Kings Landing and Tyrion, the series is called A song of Ice and Fire, they got no problem giving us the fire and that's great, but Jesus can I have a little ice in my god damn Kool aid so I can get my inner Jon Snow and the Watch fan boy on?
271	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-09	Good lord. I can't believe people actually thought this was good. This point in the story hardly meant anything to me in the first place on account of its only importance being the death of Ygritte and the arrival of Stannis (yawn) so I'm not really upset over it but wow... that was bad. Easily the worst episode in the series so far. All I could see was classic Hollywood bullshit. For one, the deaths in this episode were nothing short of comical. Every person who died died as soon as they were touched with a sword (excluding important characters of course). And every death of an extra involved absurd screaming and overdramatic body movements. Love how the watchman who got shot with a giant arrow landed perfectly on the ground 700 ft below. Not. Anyone see that massive, badass scythe thing slice those wildings to pieces?! So fucking cool! Wait. Where the hell did they find time to build something that big? And whose hairbrain idea was it exactly to begin production on an enormous, fantastical weapon which could only be used once and probably had no more than a 1% chance of hitting any climber let alone all of them in one single swing?
Â 
Two of the only three deaths in this episode that weren't laughably stupid were Grenn's and Pyp's, and they were horrible as well. What a lousy way to send off two supporting characters who have been with us from the start. I know D&D wanted to add some sort of price to be had for the battle and killing off Pyp and Grenn (even though they're both still alive in the books) seemed like an easy route, but why were their deaths so lacking in quality? One is shot through the neck and dies impassively five seconds later staring into space. The other is just found dead. The best part about it is Sam, who was supposed to be as close a friend as either of them had ever had, displayed no emotion whatsoever concerning their demise. All he responds to emotionally is Gilly and she's pretty much just the Westerosi equivalent of the ugly trailer trash girls who live in my neighborhood.
Â 
Despite all that, there are so many things about the battle which simply didn't make sense. That little skirmish at Castle Black should have been over in less than five minutes. It dragged on forever, like there was an infinite amount of soldiers on both sides killing each other relentlessly. The scythe thing, as I mentioned before, was an idiotic conception. And the door to the tunnel, by all rights, should have been rendered completely inoperative after the shit those giants and their pet mammoth subjected it to. Lastly, the writing was just utter shit. No memorable lines whatsoever and every time an attempt at comic relief was made, it came off as stale and awkward. What did it all lead up to? An entire episode dedicated to some insignificant event in the books? Jon walking outside to meet Mance. Would it have killed them to shorten up all the lame fights scenes and tie everything up with Mance and Stannis? They only had an entire fucking hour. If this is the kind of shit most people on the forums consider to be good, it's no wonder I hardly ever agree with anyone here. Sheesh.

272	Fez	2014-06-09	5/10, which I believe is the lowest rating I've ever given an episode (it may be a tie though, not sure).
Â 
There was lots of action, but it just felt hollow. I was always concerned about making the battle a full episode, much less an episode 9, and those fears were justified. The entire episode was a long tease, where the Watch never felt in much trouble, and the whole thing ended anti-climatically. I'm also rather concerned now about just how much is okay in the finale now. Sure its 66 minutes, but it still needs to have:
Â 
-Jon with Mance, and Stannis arriving
-Bran meeting Bloodraven
-Tyrion's escape
-Dany's season conclusion
-Arya's season conclusion
-Brienne's season conclusion
Â 
And I don't see how that's done. Jon, Tyrion, and Dany's stories look like they each need at least 15 minutes, Bran and Arya at least 10 minutes, and Brienne at least 5 minutes. That's 71 minutes, and from the preview it looks like there's still going to be some at least some other scenes, like a Tywin-Cersei one. This episode went short, they should've included Stannis' arrival in it; it would've helped two episodes.

Â 
The LS reveal is the most worthy finale scene, not including it would be madness.


They have a whole season 5 to deal with LS. Tyrion's actions and the outcome of the battle at the Wall are the real turning points of the story. Everything changes from there. LS would be great but at this point I rather have them concentrate on the important stuff instead of cramming everything together, which might ruin ALL those great moments. And they're already pushing it.
275	Ran	2014-06-09	322 votes, 7.94 average, 10 median, 8.20 normalized average, 85% "fresh"
276	Rhaquentis	2014-06-09	I gave it a 9, it was the "fastest" hour I have ever watched o_o Pretty cool and creative scenes.
-1 because I think Stannis should have been in the end of this episode and not the next, but I'm not too bothered.
277	Cake	2014-06-09	9/10Â 
Â 
The reason I thought that Stannis would arrive in this episode was that having that epic scene in the start of an episode didn't make much sense to me.Â 
Â 
I guess that this will mean that I will just give episode 10 a higher rating insteadÂ
278	Queen of Whores	2014-06-09	6. I was gonna give it a 7 while I watched it, but I wasn't that impressed. Yeah, I know, they did the best with the budget they had, but I just wasn't very excited. I never felt like there was any tension, and the deaths didn't have any emotional impact on me (except making me happy that Ygritte is finally dead).Â 
Â 
There were some cool moments, sure, and I was never bored. I really enjoyed the Sam/Aemon chat, but I would have preferred it was in episode 8, maybe, instead of, you know, NO FUCKING STANNIS ARRIVAL.Â 
Â 
I checked, and this has been the shortest episode of Game of Thrones ever. They had ten minutes already left to put Jon's meeting with Mance and the arrival of Stannis, and they could have taken out the dumb Jon/Sam talk about sex. That would have given them almost fifteen minutes extra time! I understand that the battle spans over more than one night, but when you spend eight bloody episodes building UP to the battle, I expect that was done so the episode could be a complete package, not have some cheap and lazy cliffhanger at the end. The battle ended suddenly, and there was no proper climax.Â 
Â 
Now the result of this dumb decision is that Stannis' most heroic and cheer worthy moment will just be an afterthought, quickly wrapped up so we can get more Khaleesi and the funny dwarf, cause gods forbid Stannis gets any meaningful time dedicated to just him.
Â 
Seriously, sometimes the decisions this show makes just piss me off, I'm sorry.

281	Sun	2014-06-09	Brilliant episode! Deserves a 10.Â Â And this is from someone who hardly ever gives out 10s to this show. I rated Blackwater an 8, and the Red Wedding an 8.Â 
Â 
It was just perfect. Pace, action, tension, emotional impact all right on the money. It's also faithful to the book in that the Wall battle is prolonged and over several tension filled, exhausting chapters/nights thus hightenening the relief of Stannis' rescue.Â 
Â 
I cried when Pyp died. It was beautifully done.
Â 
What I found most surprising about this episode - more surprising than how well the Giants were rendered, and the brilliance of the anchor sequence - is that for the first time since the beginning of the series, Kit Harrington actually delivered a good performance. I am utterly shocked!Â If the audience don't love Jon after tonight, they never will.Â 
Â 
Â 
It's just a wonderful piece of television.

Â 
I really enjoyed it during the episode, but at the end my mouth was literally agape with no Stannis. Â It NEEDED to be the end of the episode, he needed that moment. Â Now it will be lost in everything else that happens in the next episode.
Â 
Why did they do this?
283	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-06-09	10.
Â 
I realize it didn't end with a nice neat button with Stannis "Tyrelling" to the rescue, but I didn't mind Jon's going out into the frozen white - it sets up one of several "Holy Shit!" endings for ep 10. Â No doubt Mel will roast Orell's eagle, or the the nosey owl next ep. Â Or both.
Â 
I didn't miss the ambiguity of "did Jon Snow kill Ygritte?" Â  Don't worry - the show still has 400 other ambiguous plot points.
Â 
To be honest, it is a more epic battle than Blackwater - what with both flanks hit simultaneously, giants firing arrows 1000 feet and all, mammoths Â for God's sake, guys climbing a 700 foot wall, The World's Biggest WIndshield Wiper clearing the pesky climbers, oh yeah, the slight threat of 100,000 Wildings raping everything south of the Wall, and most important (as far as drama in a TV show) -- several characters we've grown to know over the past 4 seasons killing each other.Â  in "Blackwater", Stannis never crossed swords with the Hound, for example. Â Here we had Thorne vs. Tormund, Jon vs. Styr, Ygritte vs. Pip, Ollie vs. Ygritte, Grenn vs. Giant, Ghost vs. whomever he saw first, Janos vs. his shit-stained pants.
Â 
I loved the circle of death - the boy who witnessed Ygritte kill his father returned the favor.
Â 
So many epic moments setting things up. Â I know critics will complain Sam's kiss of Gilly was melodramatic, but it truly felt real to me, and added to the tension. Â He finally falls in love with a girl, thought he'd lost her in Mole's Town, gets her back, then suddenly realizes he probably won't live another day. Â Who WOULDN'T steal a kiss?
Â 
And I've seen several people say, "There were way more than 100 Night's Watchmen." Â Really? Â I missed the thousands of crows on the Wall or defending Castle Black. Â Seemed about 100 to me.

284	SkaggCannibal	2014-06-09	A 5, you know it wasn't the best episode when Allister Thorne is the most entertaining part of it.
Â 
What's with all the Sam and Gilly scenes??? Do people really care about them? That was a serious Sam-overdose, I don't want to see his face every three seconds. And how creepy was him trying to talk about his sex-obsession with Jon? Ugh those first scenes I was just wondering if anyone, anywhere, was interested in that shit. Can't be. Then came his newfound courage, like, sure now Sam is the best ever. NO.
Â 
I still give it a 5 because of Ygritte, Allister, a bit of Tormund, the actual action-scenes were great and Jon got his face smashed into an anvil . All the talk scenes (minus Ygritte's and Allister's) were boring, wasn't invested and so was less invested in the episode as a whole. I was also expecting Stannis at the end which may be another cause of my disappointment. Wonder how they will make that work in the next episode. This episode could've used some more Stannis and some less Sam/Gilly.
Â 
Â 
Mammoths and gianst were cool, have to say that though.

Oh, and the Jon/Ygritte scene was beautiful!

287	Cyril	2014-06-09	I gave it a 10, the first 10 I'd give an Episode this season.
There was no reason for Stannis to be in this episode, the first night of the battle on the wall.Â  I think people forget that he comes during the day.
Â 
I honestly feel a lot of the 1 ratings are being a bit irrational here.Â  I would only rate a show a 1 if it was completely and utterly unwatchable beyond 5 minutes in, which the episode certainly was not.
Â 
Edit: Also, I like Sam.Â  He's my favorite part of the current wall storyline.

288	BlackTalon	2014-06-09	worst episode of the season for meÂ  - 4/10
Â 
For the first time I felt the stuff in the beginning was really just filler, as much as I hate the people constantly whining about everything but plot twists and actin scenes being "filler".
Â 
The battle - so much stupid. 
Â 
Â 
Wildlings gather and light a huge campfire about 300 yards from Castle Black to spring their "surprise attack" from there.
Â 
Cold vegetable oil explodes when you poke a hole in the barrel.
Â 
Mance was a man of the Nights Watch but has his men climb the wall directly above the gate where all tthe defenses are, including that scythe on a chain.
Â 
ONE giant can lift the gate, it didn't occur to them to try that when they still had TWO of them and men that could have crawled under and taken out the defenders?
Â 
John cuddles Ygritte while his brothers are still fighting for their lives.
Â 
Plenty of brothers with swords and shields, but nobody does more damage than a stewart cook with a midsize kettle.
Â 
Wildlings are already over the castle wall and attacking but Ser Alliser is still holding speeches.
Â 
Most of all - that super diappointing ending. No Stannis.
Â 
Seems like the more CGI money you give a director the less thought tis given to anyother aspect of a film. "Prometheus" by Ridley Scott comes to mind here, the most stupid ffilm I have ever seen.

289	Alboin	2014-06-09	For some weird reason my vote is always coinciding withÂ third most voted grade.... 8 this time. Battle was great. Deducted two points
a) for badly constructed build-up about love. The theme itself is what it should be, I just find boring most of the Sam's talk with Jon and Aemon. The only part I liked there was Ygritte's frustration.
b ) for not showing what Gilly had to say to Slynt while he was shivering there.Â

290	xpozed	2014-06-09	Another "great" example of stringing things along until the season ends with useless dialog.
The fight was nice and well orchestrated but i was hoping for more out of the second last episode of the series.And thank god we didn't get more "walk and talk" from arya and clegane(the most boring things i've ever seen).
+3 points for a nice battle so i gave it a 4 becouse the feeling of rushing to the finish sticks after almost every episode of this season.

Â 
Brilliant episode! Deserves aÂ 10.Â Â And this is from someone who hardly ever gives out 10s to this show. I rated Blackwater an 8, and the Red Wedding an 8.Â 
Â 
It was just perfect. Pace, action, tension, emotional impact all right on the money. It's also faithful to the book in that the Wall battle is prolonged and over several tension filled, exhausting chapters/nights thus hightenening the relief of Stannis' rescue.Â 
Â 
I cried when Pyp died. It was beautifully done.
Â 
What I found most surprising about this episode - more surprising than how well the Giants were rendered, and the brilliance of the anchor sequence - is that for the first time since the beginning of the series, Kit Harrington actually delivered a good performance. I am utterly shocked!Â If the audience don't love Jon after tonight, they never will.Â 
Â 
Â 
It's just a wonderful piece of television.
Â 


Â 
Everything this man just said, i was crying like a little girl when Pep died. Then it was that dreadful feeling that Green will die also when the screen cut to black when the Giant attacked..
Â 
I normally don't like Allister but his speech was epic and funny at the same time, very well delivered. Onto the man of the hour Jon Snow, great performance loved how he rose to the occasion when needed but all trough the episode it was clear that he is still a kid well over his head.
Â

You're life must be really boring for you to nitpick this much on a tv series. I won't bother much with your posts cause its all kinds of silly but maybe this will shed some light for you:
Â 
"ONE giant can lift the gate, it didn't occur to them to try that when they still had TWO of them and men that could have crawled under and taken out the defenders?"
Â 
One giant was only able to take up the gate because he was in grief/ anger state over the death of his fellow giant and had most likely had a huge rush of adrenaline pumping trough him. Your post is utterÂ nonsense.
292	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-06-09	8/10. I liked it quite a bit, but not as much as Blackwater TBH. It's mostly because that episode had more interesting characters involved. Ser Alliser fighting Tormund was awesome, Ygritte's death was handled well, and the performances by Owen Teale, Kit Harington and Rose Leslie were quite good. Dissapointed that there was no Stannis. I was expecting next episode that he would offer Jon WF and that Jon would be elected LC. Oh well.

293	makchamp	2014-06-09	8.5. Â Any episode that doesn't include a Dany scene is a good episode.
Â 
Was kinda disappointed with the total length of the show. I didn't like that Jon and Sam scene where they talk about love. Not just because it took out time, but because it was kinda pointless.Â 
Â 
The running time of this show was 51 minutes
The next one will be 66 minutes
Â 
Idk why not balance it out but I'm fine with it. My expectation for the finale are extremely high. It better not disappoint.
294	Russo	2014-06-09	Purists should be happy with the ending. Its still in line with the books. I myself probably would have had Stannis coming in and smashing it plus Mance etc. In this ep. 
But I will reserve judgment until next week.
I thought the ep as a whole was great

There is nitpicking and there are legitimate complaints because what we get to see it plain stupid and getting it right would not have cost a dollar more, just some thought.
Â 
My remark about the giant seem to be the only part of my "utter nonsense" post you seem to be able to counter with some argument, no matter how desperately you have to reach and make up things out of thin air...
Â 
I guess you liked "Prometheus" too, did I twist your panties with that remark? Seriously, two-post dude, have you even read the books?

297	Kungsmurfen	2014-06-09	8. It was pretty good but there was a few things I didn't like.
298	Beric175	2014-06-09	9/10. Aemon and Ygritte had the best scenes and the fighting choreography and CG were all very well done. We also got some good character moments out of Sam, Jon, Pyp, and Alliser. Good to see itwas also true to the book so that Stannis can arrive when he's supposed to arrive.
299	Petyr Patter	2014-06-09	This episode was one of the most entertaining in the show's history.Â  For starters, it was an episode of people doing things.Â  The corollary to 'show, don't tell' is 'act, don't talk.'Â  I really did get a feel for the siege, and the strategies both sides were using.Â  Scythe versus scalers.Â  Giants versus Iron Gate.Â  Direwolf versus throat.Â 
Â 
Yet, when the episode ended, what had actually changed?Â  At the beginning, the wildlings were about to over run the Wall and the Night's Watch has a leadership crisis.Â  At the end... the wildlings are about to over run the Wall and the Night's Watch has a leadership crisis.Â 
Â 
I was so close to giving this a 10, but the episode lacked a resolution.Â  9/10
300	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-06-09	10 - it was awesome much better than the book version. I loved Gilly and Ygritte. And I really liked the cliffhanger.  I think possibly more could have been made of the fact that ravens begging for help from all the self proclaimed kings and not one has so far sent the army needed to win the war.  Series 3 had Melisandre tell Stannis he had to go to the wall and help but apart from the Iron Bank of Braavos scene where he begged for money and soldiers we haven't seen much. My son tells me he is really looking forward to seeing how the Red Witch deals with the wargs.  I'd just like to see her rescue Jon Snow from his enemies...
301	johnnysd	2014-06-09	Thought this was the weakest episode of any season so far. Liked Sam and Gilly and Rose Leslie's exit, other than that, meh......

Aemon's and Sam's scene was w/e.
	Spoiler The battle for me was just a bunch of men fighting for their lives. We didn't get to see that much of Jon commanding and show why he's Lord Commander material.

And Ygritte's death didn't quite deliver.
	Spoiler We better see "Stannis! Stannis! Stannis" next episode. It is time for non book readers to see why Stannis is so nice. 

4/10.
308	igrewupinKL	2014-06-09	I gave it a 9
Â 
The episode itself was beautifully shot, the wide panning shots were excellent and i enjoyed in one part of the episode how it followed the various characters in the fight at castle black.
The only thing about the shooting was that sometimes it was hard to tell who was wildling and who was NW. However that couldn't really be avoided with night and only black/brown colours.
Â 
I enjoyed all the build up, including Sam struggling with the concept of love over duty and trying to find loopholes from the vow. I as always, loved the Sam/Aemon scene. Aemon nearly made me cry, and i'm wondering whether they'll reveal who he was in love with. However this scene probably would've been better placed in 4x08 when Sam was upset over Gilly. In fact i think most of the Sam/Gilly scenes, although character building and lovely could've been shortened to finish off the battle this episode.
Â 
The fighting was excellent. I thought the people on top the wall could have been loosing more arrows..The giant's arrow was awesome when that guy went flying.Â 
Â 
Also I don't know about anyone else, but i felt a bit sad when the two giants died?
Â 
I thought Ygritte's death scene was well executed. Those two sold it, it didn't effect me as much in the books as it did on screen. Well done to Kit by showing the type of emotion only Jon would show. If you think he should've been more upset by it..no. They were in the middle of a battle for christs sake he didn't have time. Jon has become what he became in the books- a little cold and unemotional after the death, as Sam notices in the books, he's not Jon anymore.
Â 
I'm so upset that Pyp and Grenn died. I feel like the lack of exploration for characters on the wall affected this episode, characters that could've replaced Grenn and Pyp. But their deaths did serve to bring balance to the deaths- your favourite characters can't always live. I really liked the Ser Aliser Thorne redemption of sorts, he also had some of the best lines.
Â 
Why didn't they show Mance! Not many people (unsullied who aren't really into it like i am i.e my family) even remember who he was? They really should've shown the 3 camps; castle black, Tormund and Mance
Â 
I think with a little more cuts here and there they could have finished this episode like Blackwater, with Stannis riding in. But now i think about it, the attack on the wall is vastly more complicated and really needs 2 full episodes but we're only going to get a maximum of 15 minutes more at the wall. I'm a little concerned about the finale, there's so much to cram in there, that this episode would've been better had it ended with Stannis.
Â 
Not a perfect 10 but very close.

312	Andrey	2014-06-09	Neil Marshall and Dave&Dan would be great choice for Skyrim adaptation, not adapting last quarter of A Storm of Swords, one of the best reading experiences people can experience.
Â 
Cliche and stereotypes ridden adaptation (ygritte's way of death, standard cowardly high ranking arrogant boastful commander Janos Slynt, 300like idiotic battle shouts, awkward sex talk before deadly battle).
Â 
Fights were extra boring, music is super-mediocre and unoriginal. Very uncreative visualizations of Giants and wildling's leaders. But that we know of before.
Â 
Good parts: love talk (even though Aemon's past is another example of masterful DUMBING DOWN), some actor performances, directing, cinematography and choreography were more or less solid, maybe above solid for TV production.
Â 
All in all, it's 5/10 from me. Three years before I would never dream of seeing something so popcorny mass appealing, campy and cliched as average Hollywood history flic of HBO's production but times have changed, HBO is mere a shadow of it former self and money along with huge audience and all that...
Â 
But hey it was damn EPIC hour of television, whatever that word means.

313	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-06-09	In the Iron Bank scene it was Davos as usual making Stannis look good. I'm looking forward to Melisandre making him look like king material on the Wall.  Also what are the odds now of an Olenna Aemon reunion in KL Season 5 after the way they did Jon and Ygritte?
314	Jabberwocky106	2014-06-09	Are you guys kidding me? Blackwater was terrible compared to this battle; it left out a lot ofÂ  elements in that battle and this battleÂ  ADDEDÂ  a lot of elements. This battle was way better done in the show then in the books because the attack was simultaneous and I always wondered why the attackers never tried climbing the wall. They did that in this episode. The only nitpick I have with this is it seemed more like a 100 vs 50 battle at the bottom of the wall rather then 20 versus whatever. Blackwater was a boring battle compared to this one.

318	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	After some time to let it sink in (and a rewatch tomorrow maybe) I think its better than I originally said... but idk, something just really feels off. I can't describe it right. Maybe its overhype, or maybe its just general disinterest in the Wall since... well, since the show began. I love it in the books, but I swear, if D&D had enough power to just drop whole storylines it might just be the Wall. It's always seemed lackluster compared to the rest of the show and finally putting in a Wall-heavy episode doesn't seem to make up for that. Plus, the star power is very lacking here.
Â 
As for book purists (which I generally am not, I only defend them) they really do have the right of it. There are so few changes that are necessitated by the page-to-screen transition. Some are understandable and some reek of the showrunners wanting to attach their own credit to someone else's work (well, even more so than an adaption in the first place.) Plus, there's a big difference between "quality literature" and "quality television." The difference being quality. Which will always go to literature.

320	OnlyOne	2014-06-09	My first 10/10 for an GOT episode. Still laughing at so called bookreaders thinking stannis shows up at the night siege when he comes during the day siege lmao.

Laugh all you like. Not everyone is saying that at all. The battle scene was not epic. It was hyped up and didn't deliver. That is all.
321	Jay Stark	2014-06-09	8/10
Pyp and Grenn dying was unpredictable but unwanted. Why kill my guys 
Tormunds' bear story getting cut off annoyed me as show tormund isn't the larger than life character he is in the books. He finally gets a chance to reveal one of his major lines which everyone remembers him for, and gets cut off.
Slynt hiding was an excellent addition, i was afraid he was going to die before the "fetch me a block"
Dolorous Edd needed some of his dry lines, was left lacking there.
Allister thorne was great. The scythe was awesome. Shame they didnt use more mammoths/giants but alas I guess the budget wouldn't allow it
No stannis!Â 
Also minor tidbit- Was that three fingered hobb being a bad ass in the kitchens (That little scene got me so giddy) Â but it seems people have glossed over the small clip of THREE FINGER HOBB! casually walking out the kitchens with his butcher knife and making wilding stew. One of the most bad ass bits of the episode in my opinion!
I am not really a big fan of Jon Bradley (or of sam in general) but he shined tonight.Â 
As others have said anti-climatic ending, but i was engrossed in the episode all the way through. Sure i may be pointing out way more bad points then good, but it was an enjoyable episode.

They fought the battles one by one and it showed Jon Snow's courage and leadership even though he was always in pain. On top of that, it showed how unorganized the wildings were even though they were under a King named Mance.

Because as a book reader I can say that I care about a lot of these characters (Grenn why????????? ) but I swear, the show-only viewers probably have no one there to root for but Sam and Jon, plus Ghost who made one last-second CGI kill... I guess Gilly they probably can care about too. But really, compared to Blackwater, the characters just don't seem to hold up.

I agree. For blackwater you have this fascinating and quite important characters such as Tyrion, Cersei, Joffrey, Sandor, Stannis, Davos, Tywin (late) while TWotW had only two important characters.Â
330	Modesty Lannister	2014-06-09	I have one question for D&D. Why are they increasingly writing their own book? I can understand the changes that prolong a storyline of a character who viewers like and want to see more of them like Arya and the Hound, but I do not see ANY reason what-so-ever for the invention that was episode 9. It's dangerously inaccurate and it does NOTHING to better what GRRM has written. Why two simultaneous attacks? Why invented deaths? Why a pathetic death of Ygritte? Why, why, why? The books ARE written. They are best sellers. Why the need to needlessly rewrite them? This is NOT better than the original. It actually endangers the whole plot. This is ridiculous. 5/10 and I'm feeling generous.
331	igrewupinKL	2014-06-09	Blackwater was top notch in its execution. Even with less budget than this ep, it was much more entertaining for me.Â 


I think it's just that we had much more investment into the characters at KL, whereas at CB there was only really Jon and Sam (some people don't even like him) and thats about it. Since Aliser has been Jon's antagonist this whole season no one really wanted him to live. As for Pyp and Grenn, i loved their characters but they weren't really fleshed out in the series.
In terms of action this episode was better, but i think its complicated nature may have been its downfall. The battle of blackwater was much simpler, we had the ships and then men landing. Plus we also had the resolution to that episode, so that's probably what it was
332	Shpati	2014-06-09	I have one question for D&D. Why are they increasingly writing their own book? I can understand the changes that prolong a storyline of a character who viewers like and want to see more of them like Arya and the Hound, but I do not see ANY reason what-so-ever for the invention that was episode 9. It's dangerously inaccurate and it does NOTHING to better what GRRM has written. Why two simultaneous attacks? Why invented deaths? Why a pathetic death of Ygritte? Why, why, why? The books ARE written. They are best sellers. Why the need to needlessly rewrite them? This is NOT better than the original. It actually endangers the whole plot. This is ridiculous. 5/10 and I'm feeling generous.Yea, I agree.
Maybe remove the Night's Watch attacking Craster's Keep and just have the Castle Black battles separate. And leave Craster's Keep to Coldhands. I think this would've been better.
333	storm.131	2014-06-09	I enjoyed the episode but killing so many characters who are still alive in the coming books makes me wonder whether D&D expect this to be the final season.
Â 
As cheesy as they were, Jon's final moments with Ygritte were well acted and a predictable departure from the novel.
Â 
Rating: Â 8 out of 10

334	Three sisters	2014-06-09	I gave the awesome episode a 9. Giants with giant bows. A lot of tension. Great musique. A 360Â° view on the battle.Â 
They deviated from the book slightly, but hey, well done D&D and HBO crew!
335	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	@sj4iy, I'm really not sure... go through all the facts we know about every night's watch member besides Jon and Sam. Show-only facts. The list is short. They may be familiar faces but I'm not sure if the effect is powerful.
Â 
Total praise to John Bradley though. Some lines I thought were cheesy, but delivered in such a Samwell way I liked them.
336	Gwynbleidd	2014-06-09	This might have been said here before but The Wildlings are so like the germanic barbarian tribes. Overall, i thought the siege was good but not that great and Grenn and Pyp was not supposed to die! D&D with their fuckery of shock value for the sake of shock value.
337	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	Actually, you know what irks me most about Grenn's death? We didn't see it. We didn't see a human/giant brawl fight. It's just like the season 2 end/season 3 beginning nonsense. Set up something big, go back to it when its over for... budget cuts, maybe? I feel like that proves Grenn's death was for shock value.
338	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-09	I only gave it a 10.Â 
Â 
It was soÂ disappointing because there were minor, inconsequentialÂ differences from the book, and Stannis, with another separate battle scene,Â and with all the lead-ins required for that, doesn't show up until nextÂ week.Â  Â Â 
Â 
Stupid,

Couldn't agree more!
339	King Bolton	2014-06-09	I voted 9.Â 
Â 
I think the episode really needed to be longer, and I don't like the Stannis arrival being moved into the finale. I think the episode needed a proper conclusion, not a cliffhanger and I think there was too much focus on Sam and Gilly.Â 
Â 
That all being said, it was very well directed and did great justice to the battle on obvious budget restrictions. Ultimately, though the blackwater is the better episode.Â
340	Gronzag	2014-06-09	Disappointment. Bad acting, bad choreography, nothing made any sense.Â

I talked with my mil afterwards, and she thought the deaths (other than Ygritte's) we're pretty shocking and sad.  And she's not even that good with names.
342	Ser Graymax	2014-06-09	Certainly not the blockbuster we were led to believe Episode 9 was going to be as past episode 9s were and certainly no where near a 9 rating.Â  I gave it a 7 and had to struggle to do that.Â  Lowest rating Ive ever felt for an episode.
Â 
First GOT ever that bordered on boring and tedious for me.Â  An overlong (although well done) battle with little done in an entire episode to advance the storyline IMHO.Â  Giants and mammoths were the bright spots and I even found myself liking Ser Allister Thorne.Â  Slynt acting that way was, well, Slynt.
Â 
Ive never carred for Rose Leslie in this part while I loved Ygrette in the books so her death lacked impact.Â  Did it have to be by the hand of a peasant boy who had probably never touched a bow before and was barely big enough to pull one of that power?Â  The irony of leting him live in the raid by the Thenn and him then killing her was lazy and cheesy IMHO.Â  Better not to have seen who fired the arrow than that.
Â 
Speaking of cheesy, was there a red light special at K-Mart on the rigs for killing someone by an ax or hammer to the head and then holding it there?Â  Once OK but two weeks in a row?
Â 
The ending?Â  MEH!!!Â  This whole episode has me fearing for next week.Â  I expect a rushed, choppy episode with no real tension and a lackluster cliffhanger if there even is one.
Â 
I havent read any other posts in this thread yet so off to see if others agree with me in any way.

We don't get to see Donal Noye fight the giant in the book either.
344	Nictarion	2014-06-09	I enjoyed the episode but killing so many characters who are still alive in the coming books makes me wonder whether D&D expect this to be the final season.It's already been picked up for at least 2 more seasons. The characters that died were just merely not important to the story.

346	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	We didn't get to see Donal's death, sure, but I don't think we got to see the second right before his death either. A lot of the stuff we don't "see" in the books we can see in the show. One benefit I can definitely give the show, although sometimes they waste it horribly (Loras and Sansa wedding talk anyone?) I'm just saying, why tease a giant vs humans brawl when only the aftermath is shown?

And the scene he was saying the oath was a perfect send off imo.
348	WexPyke	2014-06-09	After reading the thread I lowered my vote a 6. The small number of attackers, the Giant entering the tunnel alone, not seeing the fight with giant.Â  Also, I really liked the ambiguity of whether Jon killed Ygritte that happens in the books.Â  Did he do it or not?Â  Of course, D and D are not that subtle nor that good at writing.
349	ladyinblack	2014-06-09	Disappointment. Bad acting, bad choreography, nothing made any sense.
Agree
350	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	I hadn't considered that...
Â 
I mean, after Oberyn's eyesÂ I could probably handle any death now, but a giant fight might sound even more crunchy

352	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-09	Do they have space to do everything next episode?!?!
353	MoIaF	2014-06-09	I agree the episode really could've used Stannis's arrival. Episode 10 is going to be absolutely insanity as it is. Why did they feel the need to push Stannis up?


Â 
I dono know, they probably wanted to end the season with Stannis' triumphant arrival to save the Nights Watch, but they really could have done that in this episode.
Â 
I'm sure it'll be a great scene next week, however, moving it to such a jam-packed episode will diminish it's importance IMHO.
354	lostinasia	2014-06-09	Wanted to give it an 8, but am bumping it up to a 9 to counter all the haters (and wow I need to be careful about reading these threads - anything except the positive nitpicking & foreshadowing threads start to make me feel like I didn't enjoy the show that I'd just thoroughly enjoyed).
Â 
I wasn't particularly looking forward to this episode, because I didn't think the show had done enough to make me care about the characters at the Wall - yet I was very pleasantly surprised by how much the battle mattered. In terms of cinematography, far more cool shots than at Blackwater, and visually far clearer.
Â 
Reminded me a lot of the experience of watchingÂ The Two Towers: spent the whole episode eagerly awaiting a scene that didn't yet happen (Stannis + Shelob), and was initially annoyed that the long-expected scene didn't happen. So I was initially disappointed, just by the ending - but have now decided I liked the episode a lot. I'm still not sure why they didn't bring Stannis in this week, but we'll see what happens next week.
355	Ran	2014-06-09	Hopefully someone drops their vote a point just because of other people voting not how they feel, but as counters to others.It really polarizes the results when people vote with agendas. Just vote what you really feel about the episode, and don't worry about what anyone else says.
356	The Fourth Head	2014-06-09	I voted 8.
It was certainly the most entertaining episode of the season, and I recognise the value of ending with Jon's decision to nobly walk out to his certain death, but Â it's no blackwater because this episode was basically 50 minutes making the journey from "we're doomed" to "we're doomed". After maintaining the dread for 50 minutes, the time was ripe for Stannis to have his moment- his blackwater revenge episode. Now, all that atmosphere will be lost between now and next week and I for one will care that little bit less by separating that moment of dread for the entire NW, from that moment of salvation. Now they will have to build it all again, and during a ceasefire, I doubt that will be possible.
Â 
Seriously, if we get a 5 minute sojourn next week, somewhere inbetween wrapping out heads around Uncat, Bran's Hodoring, the COTF, Tyrion's wife backstory, Shaes' death, or Tywins death to return to the wall, it will be totally cramped for style. Oh btw- Jons in a tent and heres Stannis on a horse- end scene. This week was the perfect moment for Stannis- newt week, he will be a small fish in a big pond.

362	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-09	I wouldn't knock it because of the ending. They cut it short to make the finale INCREDIBLE! Why would you give a bad rating because Stannis isn't in the episode? It's not like they cut it. THEY JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO IT YET!Â 


This^^ exactly. I thought this episode was spectacular in terms directing, plot and acting and it had plenty of action, thus I gave it a 10. I can understand why people were disappointed when Stannis did not make an appearance and save the Nights Watch from the wildlings as it would have made the episode even more action packed. However,Â I feel it would have made the episode play out in a manner too similar to Season 2's Blackwater episode (e.g. one army is on the losing side of the battle suffering huge losses, then another army rides in to save the day). Thats why I feel it is better they kind of left the story on a cliffhanger, thus making more anticipation and suspense for the finale. I have to admit though that having read the books, because you know what is generally going to happen, big events in the episode (e.g. Ygritte's death) dosen't have the same impact as if I hadn't read the books, as I was in complete awe and shock when watching Baelor and the Rains of Castamere (I read the books after watching Season 3.Â
363	Gendels Children	2014-06-09	10/10 possibly my fave episode ever!

365	Fevre River Warrior	2014-06-09	Wow.....wow.....gave it a solid 10. Yes, I was waiting for Stannis but I am patient and can wait till next week. I agree that it was too short.
Â 
I thought is was a WONDERFUL episode and am so glad they stayed at the Wall through the whole thing.
Â 
10....10....10.....10....all the way.

It looked to me like there was a quick shot in the scenes from next week of the Tyrion arc....can't wait to see that too.

367	graaf_x	2014-06-09	After I watched it I still give it a 10. Not the same amount of drama in comparison with Blackwater (and no drunk Cersei), but the scale was much bigger. If you wasn't entertained, then you have no heart. So 9.5 with 0.5 as a bonus for raging fans of you-know-whom.Â

Such a good episode. 
They've obviously changed the format of the series a bit. I think episode 9 is still a high point, but so was 8 and so will be 10.
371	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	5/10
Â 
Very very very disappointed with this episode. They dragged out the start way to long and it was really messy. All the one on one conversations didn't serve much purpose.
Â 
It didn't feel like they were in a battle. Giving slow orders and taking there time to load crossbows and walk around.Â 
Â 
No Stannis which was a complete cop out. This wasn't half as good as Blackwater and ended on the most boring note possible.
Â 
They could have easily cut out most of the start and had Stannis arrive in at the end which would have ended it on a high. They've completely stripped Stannis of his finest moment and pushed into next episode where he will be overshadowed by the final Tyrion scene.
Â 
Even the ending music didn't come across as epic.
Â 
You can spend 10-20 million on a 50 minute episode with crazy CGI but bad writing and pacing will bring it down.Â

Do you realise how challenging that fight would be to film. The giants are basically tall dudes who are shot against a green screen and then digitally enlarged into the shot. Correct me if im wrong, but choreographing a fight in that enclosed environment between Grenn and the giant would basically involve two people fighting nothing in seperate shots and then layering the images onto each other.Â
374	sati	2014-06-09	>Truth.


Also how laughable was them last week putting that scene with Jon's friends. I bet most of the people don't know their names let alone which is which. Emotionally flat episode all the way, the only one who managed to shine was Sam.

Sam the slayer.
376	teej6	2014-06-09	Did anyone else enjoy how Jon subdued (for a lack of a better word) Tormund? He totally owned that scene. Tormund's going to have a new found respect for Jonny boy.
377	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	I'm a musician so the part that really killed this episode for me was the ending music. Its so epic and is the perfect cavalry charge music. You can visualise the mood going from utter hopelessness to victorous as Stannis's forces ride in and route the wildling army. Pause to zoom in on Stannis's face. Credits and music again.
Â 
Instead we got "I love you Sam" and a terrible cliffhanger with epic music behind it that didn't fit at all.
Â 
I've been looking forward to this episode for two years and it completely fell short of my expectations.
378	The Fourth Head	2014-06-09	More nitpicking bringing it down from 10 to 8 for me:
Â 
1) With Jon fully fit, wouldn't it have been an opportunity for Thorne to order him to stay in a CB tower shooting arrows to defend the gate from the south side with the boy as a means of belittling him, preventing Jon from upstaging or undermining his battle plans? We could have had all the Satin bonding stuff with this Olly boy- a Bran or Rickon substitiute- and provided a sense of sequence as Jon would have started off basically on his own in command of one boy- Jon then could have wrestled with his discipline as we watch with him the wildlings killing his friends as he's stuck in a static position contrasting with the melee of the wildings advance as they get closer and closer to the gate and closer and closer to the tower roof before having to defend the boy- thrilling. With Jon fit and able, that would have been even better than the books IMO, and the book was better than the show here IMO. Battling to maintain discipline, defend the gate with arrows, and not rush out and be the hero leader like Thorne.
Â 
Eventually, Jon sees Thorne try and play the hero, fall, and enters the fray to organise a discliplined defense of the gate and tactical withdrawal up the stairs. THEN we get very clear progression in Jon's ascension to authority rather than Grenn tricking Slynt away (which makes me think we WONT now get Sam's trick next season to enable Jon to become LC, as GOT seems to use these homages as substitution- like Thorne sending Jon off to Crasters instead of sending Jon off to speak with Mance- if we get one, it's because we wont get the other).Â 
Â 
2) I really sorely missed the stair collapse moment. Rather than "outfight" the southern wildings- a mental solution for the show where basically, a few more men of the NW come down and - defeat the Thenns due mainly to Jon's unstoppable fighting prowess (!!!). -this trick was brilliant as it really showed they had Â been outmatched in fighting, but not in wits. Jon could even have improvised it organising a disciplined withdrawal, and coming up with the stairs plan on the hoof after Thorne fell- with barrels of oil from the wall- pouring oil down the stairs and destroying the charging Thenns.
Â 
Then Jon could have progressed from stuck in a little tower, impotent, to coordinating the defeat of the southern wildlings, to FINALLY getting on top of the wall, where Slynt was making a mess of it and taking the initiative back.
Â 
3) There was no sense of the watch's need to defend the gate from the wildlings to the south, which is why for half the episode, the fight seemed chaotic and unfocussed. I badly missed that clear sense of progression in the books.
Â 
4) WHY did the giants and mammoths stroll up to the gate, attach ropes, insert crowbars, and start pulling without a single arrow being fired at them? Why did the final giant, after the oil barrels fell, not face a single arrow being fired at him as he went about lifting the gate? I understand the angle issue, (he was so close to the wall) but without an order being given ("save your arrows- he's too close!") it made no sense- at least have arrows landing behind him as the watch desperately tried to stop him from the top of the wall. Instead, we had Jon chatting to Gren and the Giant calmly went about his work, as unhurried as a british road worker.
Â 
5) One mammoth and 2 giants sauntering up to the gates unprotected, and unmolested? what happened to the massive turtle slowly advancing? again- no tactics here.
379	RhaenysBalerion	2014-06-09	No... just no...Â 
Â 
I was torn between 3 and 4, but because of the couple cute/good scenes, I went with 4
Â 
In fact, I changed my mind. It's 3.Â

And like others have said my only gripe is that we would have felt more for the characters on the wall if D&D had fleshed them out better. But now I believe the only way they could have had Stannis in this Ep and not have it feel rushed is if they had built the attack on the Wall storyline over 2-3 eps.

They could have easily fit in some of the beginning of this ep in previous eps. Also the battle was underwhelming - was it shot well? Yes. Was it small and overhyped? Yes. Blackwater was far more epic - Wildfire > Fire, mammoth, giants. The music was better and the episode was so emotional and exciting. The ending was absolutely mesmerizing. Here the only emotions were from Sam, bunch of non important characters died and the ending was the worst Thrones ending ever.
384	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	They should have swapped episodes with 8. That would have been a much better 9.
385	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	@ghost, I think I said it before, but its the set up that bugs me... tease giant attack, show aftermath of giant attack. like, what if the Oberyn duel started with the spear twirling cut away to another beetle story and came back to them both lying on the ground bloody? Not a perfect example since the Elia Bowl had a lot of plot weight and important character dialogue, but still.
Â 
suggest action, don't deliver, show aftermath... I can understand why they take this approach in a lot of the more complicated scenes but I'll never like it...

the acting and directing were wonderful, easily worth a 10... i read so much negativity about diverging from the books that it's almost shocking to read the same type thing (maybe even by the same people, i didn't research that) about stannis not showing up, even when he isn't supposed to (yet - for book lovers)

I assume (probably fairly safely) that people voting 10 really enjoy the show, so it makes sense that they would continue to watch, no?
388	Frey Pies	2014-06-09	Easy 10.
Â 
I'm glad Stannis didn't show up- this episode should have, and did, focus solely on the Night's Watch. Stannis will get his big moment next episode. Be patient.
389	Alex21	2014-06-09	It was an amazing episode, I liked it, it showed us more of the Night's Watch and Jon that in the previous seasons. 10/10. In the last episode: Stannis.
390	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-06-09	It was a 10 for me.Â  For them to dedicate the whole showÂ to the wall and the first battle, epic.Â  I will say though I don't get how they continuously have left almost 10 minutes remaining to spare in almost all of the shows this season.Â  What is up with that? It hasn't even been hour long show.Â  It boggles my mind.Â  There is so much more that could be added in that 8-10 minutes that is getting left out.Â  Wonder if it is due to budget constraints?Â  Other than that I think they tried to match the book as much as possible with that battle and they did a great job.
391	Corvinus	2014-06-09	I changed my vote from 9 to 10. In hindsight, the abrupt ending makes sense, considering that they failed to give the audience a clue that Stannis is coming. It would have been totally a deus ex machina scene, and it would have been rushed, too. That being said, I hope we get to see the Horn of Winter and the eagle burning + some more giants kicking ass.
392	RottenAppleFossoway	2014-06-09	7/10 for me just because Jon Snow kicked ass, Sam and Thorne were great and the mammoth and Giants were well done. And the scythe, can't forget the scythe. Aside from that however, I felt it was a disappointment overall and in no way was as good as Blackwater. 
 Looking forward to the continuation and the surprise arrival, but it feels, to me, that even that will feel watered down since they'll be wrapping up so much in one episode.
  This one was waaaaaaaay too short.
393	SM4e	2014-06-09	Easy 10.

Yeah, I guess what bothers most people (inlcluding myself) is, that there will be so many big moments next episode and actually nobody of the Unsullied really cares about Stannis, do they?
I think it would have fit better into this episode (which was a bit short after all).
I gave it an 8 because I actually loved Alliser Thorne's and Grenn's scenes in this episode!
394	Set_Gecko	2014-06-09	1) In the books, the defense of the Wall lasts several days and consists of several skirmishes, none too big. The most important moments were the defense of Castle Black from the south and the destruction of the ram, with subsequent fight in the tunnels. I'm pretty pissed we got no ram, cause it's kinda the central piece of the siege.
Â 
2) The only "big" battle that happens is when Stannis arrives. I dont think it could have happened in this episode, because we got no real feel of the Mance army - we only got to see like a thousand people pointlessly snarling at the wall, even though they cant see anyone, 2 giants and 1 mammoth.Â 
Â 
3) The only reason I'm pissed Stannis didnt show up yet, is because I wanted to see more of Stannis on the wall this season and his dry wit, but seems we are not getting any of that.
Â 
To summirize the disappointments: no ram, we dont see Mance main host at all.
Â 
I think the episode was alright. I'd give it a 6 or 7. In no way does it measure up to episode 9 of other seasons. The battle didnt have the scale, and nothing important happened plotwise (like the arrival of Stannis, which shouldnt have happened so soon anyway).
Â 
The thing is, I believe the siege of the Wall should have started in episode 7 or so, or even earlier, with each episode spending 10-15 minutes at the wall to show the highlights of the siege. It shouldnt be this one thing that happens, should be more of a background setting for a couple of episodes. Substitute pointless Craster's plotline with attack on Castle Black from the south in episode 7, let them set the first ram on fire in episode 8, and have the intire episode 9 focusing on the wall, starting from the 2nd ram with giants and battle at the tunnel, then parley in the middle of the episode, finish with THE battle, when Stannis smashes Mance - and there you have it.Â
395	Ryuho Martell	2014-06-09	8.
Should have ended with Stannis. Not at the wall, but at least sailing to it.

Â 
Ending this episode with Stannis would have made it basically Blackwater at the Wall. Also, the moment will definitely be remembered. Just because it isn't an end scene doesn't mean it won't have an impact. Come next season, people will remember Stannis' heroics in the face of doom. Impact on Jon was personally what I wanted, and got
397	Cyvasse Khal	2014-06-09	5/10 for me. Look lets be honest, I don't know many people who were overly thrilled about spending 55mins at The Wall. It worked for King's Landing in a few episodes, notably the Blackwater, but the storylines attached to The Wall have generally been the dullest for definitely at least this season. To me this was an episode that had to happen, but I'm glad we're past it now.
Â 
Positives
- Cinematography: It looked great. The light snow falling, the fire arrows and torches against the darkness, The Wall itself, you really got the feeling of how high up they were with the wind and perspective you got.
- Alliser vs Tormund: I enjoyed that one-on-one more than any other. For an older guy and a large robust guy, they both moved great.
- One-liners: There was a couple of really nice little lines amongst the chaos that i liked. My favourite of the episode was Jon's "yeah it's a shit plan, what's your plan?"
- The Wall's defense: I really liked a couple of The Wall's defense mechanisms. That giant swinging axe thing was fricken amazing, and the oil barrels with added fire for explosions later were cool too.
- Giants & Mammoth: Looked amazing. When that Giant was running through the tunnel, I felt intimidated just watching.
Â 
Negatives
- Sam: This is one of the biggest problems. John Bradley is fine, Sam as a character is ok. But, he was largely responsible for carrying about half of the entire episode, and he is just not a good enough or strong enough character to be able to do this.
- General fighting: It got repetitive, like really repetitive.
- Ygritte's end: This one is not the shows fault. When i read her book death I thought it was pretty cheesy at the time. It was as expected even more cheesy on the show.
- Battle speeches: Did nothing for me, no matter who was giving them, couldn't put my finger on why. Possibly just general cliche type dialogue maybe.
- Janos Slynt: The show has gone a bit overboard in making him look as pathetic as possible i think.
- The ending point: The other major problem here. Where they ended it was dumb. They could have cut a good 15mins of this episode and used that time to make Stannis' arrival and quick victory the ending point.
398	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	How old are you? Middle teens I would guess, based on your apparent level of reading comprehension, lack of coherence in your posts and attempted display of edginess?
Â 
Shut the fuck up and let the grown ups talk. Lurk a bit, post again when you have learned how to behave in this forum


Ownage at its finest.
399	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-09	I voted 8 at first watch, then rewatched it and voted 9. Without the expectation that Stannis was coming I just evaluated the episode as a whole. I thought they did everything well, but it fell short of a 10 for me because it was quite short and I think they could've used that time to show anything really, not necessarily Stannis.
Â 
I really enjoyed:
- Jon telling Grenn to hold the gate and Grenn's response
- Thorne vs. Tormund fight
- Thorne's speech and general badassery
- Ygritte's reaction to Jon's smile
- Pyp dying in Sam's arms
- The exploration of fear/doubt from the NW boys about not being ready to die/ready for war
- Edd in command
- Tormund talking about fucking a bearÂ 
- Donal Noye nod with the hammer to the skull
- "There's no such thing as giants"
- Aemon and Sam's talk...I wanted him to go on!
- The scythe
Â 
Things I didn't care for:
- Olly killing Ygritte felt a bit too...cheesy? I don't know, at this point aSoIaF has ruined any predictable sentimental events for me, so this one felt a bit too much.
- The repeated notch, draw, loose commands...Just tell them to fire at will!
- Sam went a bit too quickly into being a romantic badass for my liking...Love or not, it would take some time for him to escape being shy, afraid, and I didn't really like his "I'm not nothing" speech.
400	Mexal	2014-06-09	Solid 8 from me. I felt disappointment at the end of the episode because I expected it to move further. I didn't think we'd have anymore Wall scenes in the finale (there was already enough to do)Â and I expected the arc to be completed given the solo treatment. What I saw was really good (especially the tracking shot through the fighting)Â but the epicness was definitely diminishedÂ  with the climax being put off a week. I'll give it a re-watch before the finale next week and should appreciate it more without the anticipation of resolution.
401	Peter George Stewart	2014-06-09	4. On the one hand, it was definitely fun and enjoyable as a battle episode, but on the other hand, it's the worst episode in the season for my money.
Â 
I guess big battles are such a financial black hole that it really requires a HUUUUUGE amount of money to make them look good, because this still looked kind of cheap and small scale, despite the undoubted tons of resources they must have put into it.Â  There just isn't a sense of 100,000 being on the other side (even though this was just a test skirmish) - they could have done with more CGI "filler crowd" down at the forest, or perhaps some made-up scene down with Mance, showing the masses hanging back.Â  Also, I can't remember if "100" was the number of NW left in the books or not, but the way this was played, too many NW were falling in relation to Wildlings, one felt that surely most of the 100 NW must be dead by now, after the "scale" of that battle.
Â 
Also, where the hell is you-know-who?Â  It looks like they're just going to jump to Jon doing the thing with the wildlings.Â  Might have been better to end the episode with you-know-who riding to the rescue, mirroring the end of the Blackwater episode when Tywin comes in.
Â 
Overall, certainly well done and a great effort, with some great 1v1 fights and some emotionally moving sequences (and Ygritte's death is heart-wrenching, as well as Pyp and Grenn), but still somehow disappointing.Â  I can't help but feel they must have lost a bit of momentum among the general public with this episode.

402	The Killer Snark	2014-06-09	A 9 from me, though I suspect I many have liked it more if I hadn't read the novels. For once, they finally have an episode that is set solely in the one location, and though I'd have preferred they'd done this with the Purple Wedding episode, which I still feel was an overhyped missed opportunity, I think they did the right thing here. The main problem with the episode for me is that it didn't surprise me. I've had more grievances and nits with this season than any other, but it's developed through the last few episodes into something truly fine, a real high water mark in the series, and I expected this to be a strong episode in keeping with that rise in quality but without the punch of the last few episodes. Some reservations about pacing aside, however, it was very well handled. I can't picture too many people going lower than an 8, because diversions from the novel (San's 'nothing' speech, Tormund injuring Allister, then being captured) were actually minor and judicious. The main change here is that Jon sees Ygritte being killed, though along with the fact we see a lot of her in this episode, this is actually for a change stronger than what was actually in the books. We won't hear any more the lovely Ygritte's sexy Yorkshire tones, and here she gets a proper send-off. Among the character omissions, though, I still think Rattleshirt's could prove to be quite problematic later: c'est la vie.
Â 
A few points of minor interest unconnected to my rating: - Ygritte's use of the word 'minge'; although it's mostly used in England, it is actually an old Scottish word, meaning 'drizzle', so apparently Westeros does have its equivalents to the cultural transactions between the old English and the Scots. Also, unrelatedly, the first chapter (for non-readers' sake) after Oberyn's death is actually a Dany chapter - I believe the one where she exiles jorah Mormont - so although the chronology in the series is not exact, they've started following it a bit more closely than in the last few seasons, I think, before.

403	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-06-09	I give it a 9. I'm saving my 10 for next week. But this was so well done and I was on the edge of my seat the entire episode. I was so happy to have an episode dedicated to the story at the Wall, so long overdue for them to get this type of focus. It was really great.
404	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-06-09	I gave it a 9. Should've been a 10 if they ended with Stannis, only bc the finale is going to be ridicously rushed unless they do Jon being elected LC at the beginning of next season, which I don't like, if that were the case we didn't need Brienne and Pod until next yr, Jaimie and Tyrion talking about beetles, or Crasters, idk, but I absolutely LOVED Thorne in this episode, they made him into one BAMF. Of we both live you can go on hating me and I can go on wishing that wilding bitch of yours finished the job lol
405	storm.131	2014-06-09	Why was everyone surprised that Stannis didn't show up? Â In the book he didn't show up at the end of the first battle, so at least that part was faithful to the novel.

406	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-09	Not going to lie, people giving it a 10/10 seriously infuriates me. If most people liked this empty Hollywood hunk of shit, there is no hope for Game of Thrones nor is there any hope for cinema in general. It deserves a 6 at most.Â
407	dbunting	2014-06-09	Very solid 9, I have only given a few 9's for the entire series.Pretty much enjoyed every bit from beginning to end. Liked how Jon learned from his fight and spit blood in the Thenns eye to get an advantage. Loved Sam dropping the F bomb at the gate, think his balls dropped finally. Really liked the giant shooting the arrow up the wall, yes it's unrealistic but it was a stunning visual with the body landing in the middle of the battle on the other side.
408	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-09	There just isn't a sense of 100,000 being on the other side (even though this was just a test skirmish) - they could have done with more CGI "filler crowd" down at the forest, or perhaps some made-up scene down with Mance, showing the masses hanging back. Â 


Â 
I don't understand this. You know Mance only sent a small force to test the wall yet you simultaneously complain that there weren't 100k of them. The point is that even a small force almost broke through and defeated the NW, so they'll need a miracle to get through it, hence Jon going to assassinate Mance. The dialogue makes it clear, a preliminary force almost wins so they're going to get smashed if someone doesn't try to take out Mance, and this will just set up the future events that obviously I won't discuss in a no spoiler thread.

Wasn't "Blackwater" all in KL?
410	The Killer Snark	2014-06-09	Oh yeah, it was, if I recall. I was referring to this season, though. The fact the RW didn't take up a whole episode infuriates me, even now.
411	ovis alba	2014-06-09	Just watched the ending again. Was not sure about it the first time, but I actually like it and here is why:
- it puts more focus on the Nightswatch, because now it does matter that they managed to hold the castle themselves. With Stannis showing up it would very likely have seemes a lot like just him saving the day and the fact that the Nightswatch really managed to stand against this first attack adds some credit to their importance.
- the viewers really have the feeling that all is lost now, because it can settle in for a week. It might have been just a little too similar to Blackwater otherwise, when it ends again with someone arriving by surprise that turns things around. Now instead the battle is pretty much over, but hope is lost and it can stick with people for a while.
- I like that the scene of Jon leaving to talk with Mance stands a little more on its own now and is not squeezed in between two spectacular battles. The scene back then when reading felt a little "Harry Potterish" to me (i hope at least some people get what scene exactly I mean) and I think ending it with him wandering of just sets up very nice tension for a big finale.

But yeah 10/10 for this? Don't get me wrong the CGI was good and all but really?

Do you really mean the RW? Or do you mean the PW? I could agree on the latter, but the RW really doesn't cover enough for a whole episode and the fact that it seems maybe a little bit like a "sidestory" adds a lot to it's tension in my view.

Â Stannis is still on the way.Â  He'll show up.
Â 


It was good that is why i gave it a 7. Â But surely you also agree that Stannis should have been in this episode.


Â No, I don't have to agree with that - it's going to be fine when Jon goes into the camp and we then get to see what 100,000 wildlings looks like and how fucked the NW truly are.
Â 


OH MY GOD AN OPINION THREAD WHERE PEOPLE GIVE THEIR OPINIONS! You should just stop posting.


Â It would be great if people gave opinions of the show and not just other peoples opinions or name calling.
Â 


Â 
Did you miss the part where Jon explains that this was a preliminary force to test the strength of Castle Black and that eventually their numbers would easily overwhelm the NW? They didn't send 100k.


Â Pretty much this.Â  This was the set up.Â  This was the fight to set up the battle.Â  We get to see it as all holy hell, and Mance hasn't even sent in his army.
Â 
The episode was ok - I'm much more interested in the politics and intrigue, so an episode of mostly just a battle isn't as interesting to me.Â  For what they were doing, they did fine.

Thorne was a badass - he ALMOST sounded like he was going to be nice to Snow and then dicked him.
Â 
Snow - Kit's very much coming into his own, though the Ygritte scene looked like it was a dress rehearsal and not the real thing.Â  Course, since they haven't seen each other in forever, might be forgiven.
Â 
Sam - did an amazing job this episode, I just wish we got a little less of them so that what - may - happen later is that much more a surprise/event.
Â 
Ygritte - Rose looked wooden.Â  Maybe that was her trying to portray showing no feelings, but it didn't come across well.
Â 
I give it a 7.Â  Fight was fine, the giant arrow through the NW was cool, Ghost looked great for the 3 seconds he was there, but just didn't have the oomph I expect based on the source material.
417	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	Â No, I don't have to agree with that - it's going to be fine when Jon goes into the camp and we then get to see what 100,000 wildlings looks like and how fucked the NW truly are.


I don't think i was talking to you. No need to reply. I know your stance fully well.
418	Greywolf2375	2014-06-09	It's interesting to see what the triggers are.Â  People are having specific scenes or interactions get changed, mutilated or even left out and pinning it mostly on the specific episode.Â  I think this season has been very good up to this point, but I think there has probably been 3 episodes worth of screen time that really hasn't added to the series as it stands now.
Â 
For example, Missandei & GreyWorm.Â  I don't see any value in that romance story.Â The hint there being that GW may not be a eunuch (fine, it's a change from the books for what we know now) just goes against everything we've been given/shown/told.Â  if we find out in the next book that GW isn't actually a eunuch (somehow) and there is a romance for him, cool.Â  But right now that seems like a waste where there definitely have been things missed or cut short that should have (in my opinion) been given better time.
Â 
Less talk of crushing beetles, more talk of Oberyn/Mountain.Â  Less Missandei, more prep at the Wall.
419	Starksmustwin	2014-06-09	They'll likely have Jon in Mance's Tent when Stannis arrives. Â They'll show maybe a minute or so of his soldiers riding in attacking with Stannis in the back doing his normal smirk. Â Mean while, I'll be laughing my ass off at the fact that this forum will once again be exploding into childish whining because "OMG, D&D hate stannis?!?"Â

422	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	The whole battle for the Wall felt empty. 1 mammoth and two giants just looked comical. Some CGI could have went far. Dany gets thousands of Unsullied and tons of catapults yet Mance gets a few climbers and some chains.Â
423	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-09	They have a whole season 5 to deal with LS. Tyrion's actions and the outcome of the battle at the Wall are the real turning points of the story. Everything changes from there. LS would be great but at this point I rather have them concentrate on the important stuff instead of cramming everything together, which might ruin ALL those great moments. And they're already pushing it.

I would have thought LS would appear in the closing seconds of episode 10, or it would be a great way to begin or end Episode 1 of season 5, a Frey running and being caught and hung and the cloaked figure raising her head to reveal herself.  I just hope it's at the end of the next episode.
424	BastardlyRock	2014-06-09	Alright, I've thought about it all night and morning and I'm going with a 7. At first I wanted to go lower, maybe a 5 or 6, as sadly I do agree with many here that it was underwhelming, anticlimactic and only a bit trite. The fact that Stannis didn't show up bothered me at first, not because I like deviations from the books, but because I think of all the changes they have made, this was one I was expecting them to make for a while. So initially, the end left me feeling like I'd spent the time waiting for it to really develop, then being horribly sad when I realized it never does.
Â 
That being said, now that I've put together (more or less) how they seem to be moving forward with the finale, and I've garnered a bit of appreciation for the episode as a means to showcase the struggle of the Night's Watch (look at the episode's title, after all...) AND there were a handful of very entertaining moments, I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained last night. So, a 7 from me, with cautious optimism for an epic finale...
425	The Killer Snark	2014-06-09	Nictarion - MIssandei does indeed have a beautiful rack.
Â 
avis olba - I meant the Purple Wedding. My bad. In the novel, it's built up towards in two consecutive chapters before the Tyrion chapter they adapted, but the show cut a lot of its backdrop out, or unnecessarily condensed it, and and just lunged straight into the wedding feast. I'd happily have taken less time at The Wall in the current episode, though it worked in this episode's favour, to have had a full King's Landing episode for ep 2.
426	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-09	I will be content with watching you moaners defend D&D.Â

The whole battle for the Wall felt empty. 1 mammoth and two giants just looked comical. Some CGI could have went far. Dany gets thousands of Unsullied and tons of catapults yet Mance gets a few climbers and some chains.Â 


Â 
I can see the frustration, but apparently even that takes a LOT of money to make, and they do mention that Mance has tons more giants and mammoths at his disposal and that this was a minor attack to test strength. I think people wanted the 100k vs NW battle in this episode (understandable, big battles are epic), but frankly that's not even how it happens in the books so I'm a bit confused about how people teeter from wanting purity to wanting something completely different.
427	teej6	2014-06-09	They could have easily fit in some of the beginning of this ep in previous eps. Also the battle was underwhelming - was it shot well? Yes. Was it small and overhyped? Yes. Blackwater was far more epic - Wildfire > Fire, mammoth, giants. The music was better and the episode was so emotional and exciting. The ending was absolutely mesmerizing. Here the only emotions were from Sam, bunch of non important characters died and the ending was the worst Thrones ending ever.  
Granted, we were more invested in the characters in Blackwater which made the in between scenes (Cercei, Sansa, Sandor, Tyrion) far better. But the action sequences were def better executed this time around... more coherent and tighter You got to actually see the sword fights.
428	Peter George Stewart	2014-06-09	Â 
I don't understand this. You know Mance only sent a small force to test the wall yet you simultaneously complain that there weren't 100k of them. The point is that even a small force almost broke through and defeated the NW, so they'll need a miracle to get through it, hence Jon going to assassinate Mance. The dialogue makes it clear, a preliminary force almost wins so they're going to get smashed if someone doesn't try to take out Mance, and this will just set up the future events that obviously I won't discuss in a no spoiler thread.


Â 
Read what I said, I didn't expect 100,000 to be attacking at that point, obviously, but what I did expect was a sense of 100,000 people hanging around somewhere.Â  Given D&D's penchant for inventing scenes to supplement lack of p.o.v., I would have expected some kind of scene with Mance, and a huge CGI camp, like they sometimes do.Â 
Â 
All punters have heard is "100,000" vs. "100", but that's telling not showing, and I should think 1 mammoth and a couple of giants (CGI anyway, so it would hardly have cost any more to have more - it's not like they're individually priced) plus a few Braveheart weapon-beaters, isn't going to cut it to give a sense of epicness.
Â 
Also, thinking further on the Stannis thing, I'm far from being a "Stannis lover" and I'm on record here as being baffled by all that stuff, but that he doesn't have his moment of glory as the one "king" who actually gives a toss about the events in the North, is annoying, even to someone who isn't a "Stannis lover".
Â 
Also, I've been a big fan of what D&D have done with the story on the whole, but this is the one episode this season where I think they've dropped the ball big time.

I will passionately argue with anyone who undercuts the Wall as a place that doesn't matter because the politics down south don't matter at all compared to what Jon, Grenn, Allister, Tormund and the gang are dealing with. The Wall and its characters have meaning and purpose!Â

Â 
Well, wouldn't it be weird to just have 100,000 people gathering around watching the wall when they weren't planning on attacking, like they were just watching a movie? I suppose it would've been nice to show a GIANT group of wildlings but ultimately we don't see that in the book until Jon goes to treat with Mance anyways.
Â 
Stannis didn't lose any glory yet. Like Ran said, if you read the book you know this is exactly how it happens. The first siege is stopped by the NW, but inevitably they can no longer hold it, and Stannis comes and saves the day. At least wait until next week before claiming they took anything away from him...It hasn't happened yet!
435	jarl the climber	2014-06-09	They'll likely have Jon in Mance's Tent when Stannis arrives. Â They'll show maybe a minute or so of his soldiers riding in attacking with Stannis in the back doing his normal smirk. Â Mean while, I'll be laughing my ass off at the fact that this forum will once again be exploding into childish whining because "OMG, D&D hate stannis?!?"Â 
Â 
It will be hilarious.Â  


Actually they have portrayed Stannis as a fighter who personally leads battles from the front, so its very possible that he will be in the thick of the battle and might even defeat Mance mano a mano.Â
436	teej6	2014-06-09	Â 
yeah if you never in your life watched historical action movie, you'll be crazy entertained
Â 
otherwise, it's like watching skyrim battle from spectator's perspective
This isn't a historical action movie (whatever that means).
437	Mexal	2014-06-09	Why was everyone surprised that Stannis didn't show up? Â In the book he didn't show up at the end of the first battle, so at least that part was faithful to the novel.


Â 
Mostly becauseÂ we thought the entire battle at the wall would take place, not just one night given the solo treatment.
Â 
Also, looks like next week is actually 66 minutes long, a full 15 minutes longer than last night's. As this show is only 10 episodes long, I do wish they'd use the full hour alotment to tease out as much story as possible. More than enough story to add another 5-7 minutes per episode of character beats or set up (looking at you episode 8 prior to the fight).
438	The Killer Snark	2014-06-09	Stannis doesn't even appear, as others have pointed out, until after Jon leaves The Wall to look for the wildling camp. There was no space to fit him in, though it would have made a better ending if there was.
439	Starksmustwin	2014-06-09	And you are contributing anything positive to the forums?

Telling off the constant moaners is pretty positive.
440	teej6	2014-06-09	I assume (probably fairly safely) that people voting 10 really enjoy the show, so it makes sense that they would continue to watch, no?
Generalize much, do you? I'm not a huge fan of the show, I don't hate it either. I liked this episode and I have disliked others

Â 
No, it wouldn't have. Â This episode was about the bravery of a few NW brothers holding the wall through impossible odds. Â  Having Stannis ride in at the end and save the day would have distracted from that. Â  The way D&D did it, we get both. Â We get the NW being heroic and next week, we'll get Stannis riding in to help. Â  And I'm not a D&D apologist in the least. Â I mostly hate how little they've built up the wall, as it's my favorite locale in the books, but I completely agree with giving the NW their due for an episode without having some other entity rush in to save the day.
443	Relic	2014-06-09	I don't understand all this talk of Stannis not arriving. He doesn't show up during the assault on Castle Black, as many others have said. This episode focused on that with a bit of the assault on the other side of the wall sprinkled in, obviously. 
Anyway, I enjoyed the final twenty minutes of this well enough, even if not much of it made any sense. The action was as good as its ever been in the show. Makes me wish they had this sort of Budget for the Whispering Woods. 
So many questions tho. Why sacrifice two Giants to try to get thru the gate? Why does the second giant charge in by himself? Where are the other wildlings? I understand this was a "probe" by Mance but even so... A few more men and the the gate would have been taken. 
Where are all the other men of the NW? Are they really down to 100 dudes in this show? Who is manning the other castles? Are there no other gates thru the wall in the show version? How do you get smashed face first into an anvil, gush blood, and then walk away with everything intact? How does a little kid with a shitty bow kill a wilding with armor on? What happens to Thorne? He gets sliced a bit,  two guys drag him off and he isn't seen or heard from again. 
Meh,  whatever. Enjoyable, if daft. Gave it a 6.
444	lakin1013	2014-06-09	A 9. Â And I wish I could score it a 9.5. Â I have a few nitpicks but they are small. Â When Jon was fighting Styr, I honestly thought Ghost would come to help him finish off the Thenn. Â Too little Ghost altogether!!! Â  The sex talk between Jon and Sam - why? Â And I completely agree with previous posters who argue that BlackWater had more fully fleshed out characters to care about, while the Battle for the Wall did not. Â And maybe that IS because the Kings Landing folks are played by more experienced actors (Dinklage, NCW, LH, C Dance and so on).
Â 
But as a reader, I always fancied the Wall, the Men of the Nights Watch, and the wildings so I was completely happy to have an entire episode set at the Wall. Â The siege was well done for television. Â Thought the scene of Grenn and the men reciting their vows while facing the giant was moving, as was Ygritte's death. Â Watching Jon Snow on his way to becoming the man is engaging. Loved the episode!
445	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-09	I agree. For blackwater you have this fascinating and quite important characters such as Tyrion, Cersei, Joffrey, Sandor, Stannis, Davos, Tywin (late) while TWotW had only two important characters.Â

Â 
It's a good point, and I didn't think about it until people said it on here, that Stannis riding up makes this Blackwater Pt. 2. Honestly GRRM does the "In the nick of time" thing a bit too often so there's a chance that the Stannis ending would've seemed a bit convenient and too similar for non-readers.
448	MarcusLloydAK	2014-06-09	I gave it an 8. I think there should have been more mammoths to make the battle feel more 'epic' like in the books. Also, I think Grenn should have been kept alive.

Keep in mind, this wasnt mance's main attack on the wall, just testing the defenses from the wildling side. But yes i agree that it would've been epic

454	storm.131	2014-06-09	It's already been picked up for at least 2 more seasons. The characters that died were just merely not important to the story.


Important does not have to be defined in terms of how crucial a character is to the plot. Â As is evidenced by the number of people here who expressed their disappointment that Grenn and Pyp were killed off, they were important to a lot of viewers.
Â 
I don't really take an interest in what happens behind the scenes regarding whether the series has been picked up for more seasons but will take your word for it.

I don't think they killed them off because they were "unimportant". I think it's the opposite, they killed them off because it had dramatic importance, because the audience cared about them. I hate to be a defender as the books are always better but I get it for pure tv and it worked. It made for a great piece of television. Emmy for Marshall?

461	Tadco26	2014-06-09	I'm kind of surprised that they haven't had Mance reappear on the show prior to the attack to remind non-readers who he is.Â  It would have also given a chance to introduce Dalla and Val, but I suspect they cut both of them from the show.
Â 
Jon's negotiation/assasination attempt was far-fetched in the books, but it appears he is going with no weapon?Â  And he has a significantly worse relationship with every wildling outside of Ygritte in the show.Â  Tormund still likes Jon and defends his right to speak to Mance when he is sent in the book.Â  Tormund is captured on the show, and has no respect or friendship with Jon to speak of, and of course won't be there to speak up for him when he goes to try and meet Mance.Â 
Â 
The changes also make their future book interactions of brokering the wildling/night's watch peace much harder to make convincing.Â  Of course the show has a history of changing things, and then going back to the book storyline as if the changes never happened, so who knows what they will do.
462	DemiNymph	2014-06-09	5, the lowest I ever gave for any GoT episode. I don't think the cherography for the fight scenes and the whole battle are very good. Good enough for a low budget TV I guess. But even Xena was better TV, sorry. And minus 1 point for killing Grenn and Pyp.
Â 
I only liked the scythe dropping from the wall thingy. That was cool.Â 
Â 
Why kill them off? Did the actors quit or something?Â
463	Andrey	2014-06-09	Last quarter or third of Storm of Swords, if you read it at once without spoilers, will be one of best hours of your life regarding artistic consummation, if not the best.
Â 
I couldn't possibly name one favorite scene, plot line resolution but the one that sticks out is Stannis arrival, it's so masterfully executed with GRRM characteristic short effective last sentence of chapters (along with first short effective sentence).
Â 
"Jon turned away, and went inside the tent."
Â 
I fear that adaptation will change that into some quasi overly dramatic sequence of Mance being close to killing Jon, then Stannis will arrive leading his army, exposing himself unrealistically. He will save Jon or something like that. Some stupid mediocre quasi-war music theme, Stannis shouting some "cool" lines, etc.
Â 
In the books you just have from Jon's POV, his thoughts and realization. No need tho show everything, GRRM don't write it if he can't depict some creative and important moment in mere battle. Show will ofcourse show it all, despite constant boring argument from show apologist of budget constraints.
Â 
Similar to Ygritte's death,: in books it's so surrealistically ordinary, sudden and feels naturally as always with GRRM (unlike stupid claiming that books and show use death for mere shock value!)
Â 
In the show it was horribly executed with super cheesy last minute bow in the back from inexperienced swordsman who saves the main character, seen 1000 times before.
Before that he got some advice to fight, not hide.
And then some slow motion.

Â 
Â 
Instead of sending Val to meet with Tormund, Jon will have Tormund go out and treat with the wildlings. Â  So, like they did with characters like Bronn, Tormund will likely be used more because his character already has some build up. Â  You can't just keep introducing tons of new characters in the TV show or it will become even more hard to follow for the non-readers.

Â  They were different than what he used during the battle.
Â 
Â 
Also, personally, I loved the way the show handled her death. Â After all the talk about wanting to kill Jon, in the end, her love for him caused hesitation and it cost her her life. Â I also loved that Jon, upon seeing her, simply smiled.. even though she was pointing an arrow at him at the time, his happiness in seeing her over ruled the fact that he may be about to die. Â  "Blah, blah, bloah, it was teh cheezy?!?".. well, it's a TV show and it made for interesting TV.

467	King Cheops	2014-06-09	I gave it a 6. Â Even my non-book reading wife didn't seem too impressed. Â "Ugh the whole episode is really at the Wall?". Â Her reaction to Thorne's speech in the courtyard: "Is this really all there's going to be?". Â She didn't cry like I thought she would when Ygritte died. Â She was wondering what the fuck was going on with the mammoths and giants: "What's the point of those barrels? Â Why aren't they shooting? Â Is that it?"
Â 
I am not a fan of Stannis, Jon bloody Snow, or any of the Night's Watch stuff. Â But if there is anything good in the books in regards to that storyline it is these battles. Â There are 3 important beats in the books and they messed them all up: Ygritte's death, Noye and the Giant, and Stannis's arrival. Â They cut the last one and the first two had no build ups. Â They made Ygritte a villain this whole season and thought the Thenns mocking her would make people give a flying hoop about her still loving Jon. Â They didn't show the giant fighting in the tunnels, didn't build up any of the "these are the last giants left on the planet so this is tragic" (although they did randomly show the king freaking out when the other one died -- wife didn't care), and didn't impress how heroic the sacrifice of the NW men was. Â Then they focus so much on that cliff hanger with that loser Snow and totally gloss over Grenn's death.
Â 
This episode was billed as being bigger than Blackwater. Â Sure maybe it cost more and was more technically challenging but it had no emotion or scale. Â The fight in the courtyard is a perfect 1 for 1 analog to Jarl Borg's attack on Kattegat -- just a bunch of dudes (and dudettes) skirmishing in a dark ages looking set. Â But even Vikings seemed to have more extras in that fight than GoT did. Â Sure the climactic fight between the Vikings and the Saxons only lasted 3 minutes but it featured 2 cavalry charges and well over 300 men and women fighting. Â If we have to give up the sense of scale for 1 shot of Ghost ripping a guy's throat out and the lamest Giant attack in the history of cinema then I'd take Vikings any day.
Â 
Worst episode of the season and worst 9th episode of the series.

Also, personally, I loved the way the show handled her death. Â After all the talk about wanting to kill Jon, in the end, her love for him caused hesitation and it cost her her life. Â I also loved that Jon, upon seeing her, simply smiled.. even though she was pointing an arrow at him at the time, his happiness in seeing her over ruled the fact that he may be about to die. Â  "Blah, blah, bloah, it was teh cheezy?!?".. well, it's a TV show and it made for interesting TV.

470	FalseKnight	2014-06-09	In an interview Neil mentioned there were going to be 3 battles ...
Â 
- Battle at Castle Black
- Battle at the Wall- Stannis' arrival
Â 
Not sure what the third one is supposed to be.
The battle in the tunnel.
471	Defeatarion	2014-06-09	IMHO 6-7 was fair. (I gave it a 7). If you gave it a 1 you're hating just to hate, and if you gave it a 10 I think you were very generous. Come on a 1? People keep comparing this show to other shows that literally do not even come close. Just stop......on the other hand this battle was being built up since season 1 and I feel like they could've really made it feel more gut wrenching if they spent more time on it rather than fake love stories and stupid filler. But this can be said for the entire season. I think cutting it up week to week hurts the overall reviews of each episode (But obviously they have to). All together it's good season. I felt like the ending was a buzzkill at first, I was expecting Stannis only because I feel like episode 10 will be rushed. I'm also afraid episode 10 will be something stupid like The Hound vs Brienne, too much Arya & Dany etc. And that the wall wont get it's proper ending, which in the books were a game changer and exciting. I also fear they may be no LS. ALL THIS BEING SAID, I really really hope I am proved wrong. I really do hope* they will end this in a fantastic edge of the seat way. We'll see.Â

Â 
Possibly the least enjoyable episode of the entire series for me. I like the show for its dialogue and intrigue, I didn't really care for 30 min of people hacking at each other in the dark, where I could hardly see anything.
473	AlienTwo	2014-06-09	I liked it, thought they should have finished the Castle Black stuff (seems like there is a LOT to include next week) but still good.Â  Sad that Pyp and Grenn died...
474	Ser Creighton	2014-06-09	Nictarion - MIssandei does indeed have a beautiful rack.
Â 
avis olba - I meant the Purple Wedding. My bad. In the novel, it's built up towards in two consecutive chapters before the Tyrion chapter they adapted, but the show cut a lot of its backdrop out, or unnecessarily condensed it, and and just lunged straight into the wedding feast. I'd happily have taken less time at The Wall in the current episode, though it worked in this episode's favour, to have had a full King's Landing episode for ep 2.

What time at the wall? So you basically want the Ice cut out of A song of Ice and Fire. You don't need to cut time from something that hardly has gotten any over the last 4 years. Battle of the fist ring a bell? Probably not because it didn't happen. Hey they built it up like it was going to happen, made it a cliffhanger but you know what? Didn't happen. How bout cutting some of that useless KL shit they have done for the actual important KL stuff. Hey get they put in some character development scenes and that's all good, but character development for non characters is where I draw the line. You know the wall is important, you know Stannis is important, and I love the Dink, but I don't need to see him in bad poorly written filler when there is much better stuff in the books that can be spread around to other arcs that are getting short changed.
And yeah Missandei is hot on the show, but you know what? Don't need the romance, great they want to give some time to the nobodies to create some emotional impact for when they kill off GW in place of her brothers. But I never met her brothers in the book and it still had impact. And before you run around giving away time to characters that really don't matter, how about giving some emotional impact to some of the actual arcs they have gutted. Or how about spreading the dreams around a bit, last I checked Bran is not the only one who has prophetic dreams.
You want more time for  some important developments in KL? That's fine there is plenty of wasted time to go around I'm not greedy. How about Stannis? They gut his arc, gut his arc, then create a scene in Braavos that's not needed and it doesn't matter because Stannis was once again unable to think. They want to change some his arc, fine, okay, but at what point has he ever been an idiot? This to hard, Davos help show them your hand, well everything is fixed. Yeah I can skip that crap and be just fine. Poorly written? Check. Waste of time? Check. Weak characterization? Check. Pointless? Check.
Or I know lets go to Crasters. Me fucking, fuck, rape, fuck, skull fuck, kill fuck, rape, fuck knives, of fucking alley to fuck up everyone, so fucking fuck fuck, to fuck rape the fuck fuck, out of fuck me so fucking dead fuck, you fat fuck cause I am the best fuck ever fuck, fuck Mormont skull drink fuck and rape. 
Sorry but fuck that garbage.
Or hey lets torture Theon, now lets do it again, now lets mix it up and some boobs, and you know what lets cut his dick off. Well glad that's over with oh shit we are back for more torture, really? I get it, put away the sledge hammer he is being tortured.
Oh hey it's Roz... again... oh great. "It's hard for girls like...." No shut up and get off my screen you irrelevant wast of time.  Oh she is there to show me how cruel Joff is. Well that's a horse of a different color because I had not picked up on that at all so thank god for Roz. Check Joff is cruel and I in no way would have figured that out without Roz.
475	cwwagner	2014-06-09	id only give it a 5. the episode was very entertaining, and the battle scenes were awesome. However, being a reader of the books, i am dissappointed in the overall structure of the episode, and notÂ  just this one, most of the scenes from the wall have been changed imo for the worst. It all startedwith jon having to deal with the mutineers beyond the wall. it was a plot line not derived from the books and imo that should have been relpaced that with the wildlings storming castle black from the south. they could have then added the first siege from from notrh off the wall an episode or so earlier and then had another one this past episode plus jon going beyond the wall to treat with mance, then the arrival of stannis at the end of the episode. i think this could have added clarity to what all is happening up at the wall plus t would have freed some space to better explain what is going to happen is episode ten becasue from what i know they will need to cover a lot of plot points as well as leaving some out either for good or next season. anyways this is only my opinion, i love thrones and i love all 4 seasons but i think it coulda been better feel free to tear this apart or agree its all for the good of the realm
476	Sand11751	2014-06-09	5 out of 10 for the episode itself, 9 out of 10 for the battle scenes. The penultimate has never underwhelmed, except for last night. I yawned at the wrong times; Maester Aemon and Sam, Jon and Ygritte at the end. I should have felt something and I didn't, except mild stiffening in the hand propping up my chin as I wondered if the characters were done speaking. The battle itself; well, you can't beat mammoths and giants.
477	Hodor's Dragon	2014-06-09	Unless you like action over dialogue and character development, you couldn't possibly prefer this episode to Blackwater. Â Blackwater had that really awesome series of scenes with drunk Cersei hectoring Sansa, the scene with Sansa and the Hound, Sansa trying to provoke Joffrey to charge into battle, Cersei ordering Joffrey to bed, and Tyrion's epic "Those are brave men knocking on our door! Â Let's go kill them!"
Â 
This episode isn't even comparable. Â John and Sam with a handful of decent lines, Aemon with a nice little scene but also a bit out of place, not comparable to the Cersei-Sansa stuff by any stretch of the imagination. Â That was some of the best dialogue in the whole series.
Â 
I'm not an action fan, but I did very much enjoy some of theÂ big action in this like the giants, fire, and scythe, the "tracers" going up and down the wall in a night action, the charge of the wildlings from the south. Â But the melee in the courtyard was just a big yawn. Â 2 minutes is plenty of screen time for a melee in my book, but this wentÂ on and on and on and on and on and on. . . .
Â 
Also: a probe? Â Against static defenses? Â That makes no sense at all. Â Why even let them know you're there unless you're really going to bring it? Â Probes are to find out where the enemy is. Â Mance knew exactly where the enemy was already. Â Only an all-out attack made sense.

478	gotgrrrl	2014-06-09	Giving it a 6.Â  I didn't have huge expectations going in as I'm not a fan of the whole Wall storyline and since that was all the episode was about I had fairly low expectations but I WAS super excited to see Stannis arrive and then...no Stannis this episode [note:Â  I'm not a Stannis fanatic or anything, I just really like it when he arrived at the Wall in the book. I was not expecting it].Â 
Â 
I thought the way Slynt was portrayed was weird -- cartoonish even.Â  Poor writing of the character.Â  Yes, he's an a-hole but to deny seeing mammoths and giants and then go hiding was just silly.
Â 
I also didn't think the Sam/Gilly scenes were necessary.Â  Getting to be annoying like Tyrion and Shae.Â  Same dialog over and over again.Â  And was Gilly really about to just sneak past the Wildling group, carrying a baby?Â  Really?Â 
Â 
I did like the mammoths and giants - glad they were included.Â  Makes North of the wall more interesting.Â 
Â 
I also liked seeing Maester Aemon -- had to wonder who the girl was.Â
479	The Reader Lisa	2014-06-09	Whenever I read someone saying that a book can never be put on the big or little screen exactly, I
always think of the Brideshead Revisited miniseries with Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews. I literally
read along in the book the last time I rewatched it on Bravo. John Mortimer (the Rumpole guy) did
the screen adaptation I think and that has to be the easiest money anyone ever made. It is literally
word for word. Okay, there are no giants, dragons, battles, etc but stop saying it can never be done.
And for something a little more challenging, I can't remember too many deviations from the book in
Gone with the Wind either.
Â 
And these are two books I love dearly and two adaptations I have watched countless times.
Because no one felt the need to "surprise" me.

 Â The first season of the GoT was so popular BECAUSE it was an accurate adaptation of AGOT. I do not see any value in this butchery. I do think it is damaging the story and at this stage really confusing the show audience. Also, I do understand the need of the producers to hide a possibility of R+L=J, but not for four whole seasons. Show viewers haven't seen a hint of that so far. To them, Jon is Ned's son and that's it. It's just silly. If R+L=J is true, it will not be the only twist by the end of this, so I don't see any point in hiding all the hints from the show. Furthermore, the show completely ignores dreams, prophecies and lore that have a huge significance in the books. Even animated additions to each season that go with the DVDs and can be found on You Tube do not contain enough information for the viewers to really get the gist of the story background and magical elements. There are many unnecessary and pointless scenes in the show, such as Greyworm/Myssandei "love story". I do not see their purpose. GRRM has not written these story lines. It is one thing to extend an existing storyline and quite the other to invent them. The whole episode nine is a fanfic. Not a single thing is taken from the books. Why? What's the purpose? It should be an adaptation, not a fan fiction.

 I'm this boat. I'm in the group that is oft laughed at because I would genuinely enjoy a word-for-word adaptation over what weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve received thus far, even if it meant a smaller audience for them in the long run. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all wrapped up in the money, and as long as the money keeps coming in, it will be seen as justification for the changes and alterations made to the plot/timeline/characters that have been made. At this point Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m honestly willing to watch a hundred hour +Â  animated version of aSoIaF ala Ralph Bakshiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s 1978 Lord of the Rings over these four seasons (and promise/threat of only 7 by the end).
Â 
Before the daggers come out, please, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hate the show. I enjoy it for what it is, but I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think that admitting that has to also come with me smiling at all the (often unnecessary) changes and not also being allowed to confide that I idly wish for a true, if not verbatim, adaptation.

484	The Dragon Prince	2014-06-09	10/10 I loved this episode. Definitely one of the best episodes EVER!!!!
485	Steve Stark	2014-06-09	So there were changes. Putting that aside...
Â 
Holy God, HBO. I am impressed.
Â 
I get the feeling ep10 is going to blow my mind. I can't wait!
486	Serr Parker	2014-06-09	I know what's going to happen but I thought the cliffhanger was very well done, my only problem is how they're going to squeeze everything into the final episode, I've said since S01 these should be 12 episodes with double premiers and double finales.
Â 
Absolutely loved the long shot of Jon getting off the lift panning all around to Sam, overall a 9 for me.
487	Brynden Blackstag	2014-06-09	So, I'm new here and signed up to give my two cents about this episode.
Well, I gave it a solid 7/10. It was definitely fun to watch and entertained through the whole lengths, but there's my problem with this one: it was too short for my opinion. I thought it last week with the duel and I thought it today again, there was too much unnecessary talk, while the more important parts were cut.
Â 
I think, and that's just my opinion, that the whole Mance & Jon negotiation should have been in this episode, with Stannis arriving at the end as the absolute climax of the episode.
I just cannot imagine a way how they gonna put all the remaining stuff in Ep.10 and doing all these epic scenes appropriate justice. There's just too much left!
488	Gerchon	2014-06-09	This show is already a disaster! WTF happened ...

Â 
I agree with all that. Â It would've been child's play to cut 10 minutes out of this and get Stannis coming in. Â Heck, cut 5 minutes and make it a 55-minute episode.
Â 
The only positive I take from that is that it sets up Ep. 10 as being even greater--but Ep. 10 already has a ton of great content expected. Â I just hope there's not too much. Â It's only 66 minutes. Â If I see any "filler" scenes early on I'm going to start worrying.
490	rmholt	2014-06-09	Â 
No LS reveal = This forum will explode from the hissy fits!
Â 
The LS reveal is the most worthy finale scene, not including it would be madness.

I think it could and should wait.
491	rmholt	2014-06-09	No Stannis or LS ending. A perfect ending would be a crossbow thrum!

I think that's got to be it. Then we can slowly die waiting to see Tyrions next move. Or if the bolt actually hits. Wherever they pull the plug! They end episodes like the Sopranos ended the series except w credits and a next ep! I'm always faked out that it's ending until the last seconds and then scream, then credits!
492	VeturKemur	2014-06-09	I gave this episode a 10. There was nothing I didn't like about it.
Â 
I'll probably give The Children a 10 too if it ends the endless whining about Stannis.
493	King Tyrion I	2014-06-09	10/10 
Because of 
- the mammoth and the giants
- Sam the Slayer in action
- Janos Slynt (!)
- awesome duels (Ser Alliser vs. Tormund)
- "You know nothing, Jon Snow."
- Ser Alliser agreeing for once with Jon
- Maester Aemon and Sam
- Sam and Jon
494	TheWolvesRemember	2014-06-09	6/10 for me. 
It's not so much that tho individual episode was bad, but it feels like this is what you get with a poorly paced season that didn't have nearly enough build-up. The producers needed 15 minutes setting up the battle because they failed to do so in previous episodes. 
This is really going to be obvious next week. There's no way that they can adequately cover the end of the book without leaving something major out.
As a standalone episode it was pretty entertaining. But within the overall framework of this season, it felt rushed and out of place.

496	The New Alive	2014-06-09	I gave it a 10, although after reading this thread I was reminded of a few points that could have been improved upon. I would have loved to see Grenn actually fighting Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg, and more Ghost action.
However, I still think it was my favourite episode so far. Pyp's death has got to be the biggest book-to-TV shock! Also Ser Alliser Thorne vs Tormund Giantsbane was a great fight.
Â 


Some stood there snarling and got shot, and about 10 seconds later after the third or 4th guy gets nailed they all act shocked and back up.


They backed up THREE seconds after the first guy got shot. I'm not trying to be pedantic, but to me it looked like a realistic reaction.
497	Newky	2014-06-09	Fan pleasing, shallow, and an unrelenting air of hollywood-esque emotive predictability.
Â 
Really disappointing after last week's mostly brilliant episode, and the first episode in the whole series I actually disliked watching.
Â 
- The battle tactics seemed oversimplified, everything is on this weird micro-scale like Blackwater where you feel like you're in a brawl in someone's back garden.
Â 
- The cartoonish Jonas Slynt 'cowardly dog' alteration is odd and unnecessary. He is a complete sh-t head but he is formidable as a bad guy and an enemy to Jon Snow and this change is really disappointing and damaging to the character.
Same with Thorne, it felt nice to see a relate-able human side to him but I know it's not right that the show is catering to shallow feelings over maintaining the harsh reality of this world - where Thorne is an eternally unappeasable c-t - and in which in the show is starting to feel less and less real.
Â 
- The mid-battle, holding in the arms, cliche-romance scene with Jon and Ygritte. I nearly pulled my eyes out. â<U+0080><U+009C>Hush now....â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>You know nothing..... Jon....... Snow....â<U+0080><U+009D> Seriously? Is this seriously happening right now? Okay yeah it's happening, f- it, I'm done. At this point I'm no longer in Westeros, I'm watching a scene done a thousand times before in a thousand different movies, interwoven with the worst kind of movie predictability.
Â 
- Pyp & Grenn shouldn't have died (where's Noye?). As Jon's closer friends he needs them to add depth to his character.
Â 
Last weeks episode gets an 8, this week its a 3, up from a 1 because ghost appeared (and I'm ignoring the fact that he just stops at one and chows down for a minute mid-battle) and up from a 2 because the anchor swing and giant-charge scenes (nervewracking, the vows recital made my skin shiver). Boy was this unenjoyable.. But, looking forward to next week a lot, and conversely am optimistic for how it will turn out.
498	Frey Pentos	2014-06-09	A disappointing 6 for me. Episode lacked tension, was too short and we didn't even get to see Grenn kill the giant. The whole battle including Mance and Stannis should have been covered. Blackwater told the whole story from build up to conclusion and was suitably raved about. This Wall battle feels like a missed opportunity to do something equally special.Â
499	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-06-09	10. Â Against all odds, the Night's Watch won a big battle...for a night. Â Looks like the Stannis shocker will show up next week. Â Not upset by that at all. Â Still a little shocked about Grenn and Pyp, but hey, it happens.

What I'm most shocked about is how so many people voted a 1. Â I don't think any episode could be a 1 in this series, unless you don't like the genre. Â And if you don't like this genre, why are you watching the show? Â If it's cause you're a book reader, as I am, you just have to realize, this isn't the book, it's the show. Â Did a bunch of Harry Potter fans sign up just to rate down episodes?
500	The Killer Snark	2014-06-09	Sometimes, I believe myself they do.
501	Miss Carnahan	2014-06-09	Damn, I was so certain we would see Stannis.
Â 
5/10, Blackwater was much better (as was the RW), very disappointing
502	sj4iy	2014-06-09	Â The first season of the GoT was so popular BECAUSE it was an accurate adaptation of AGOT. I do not see any value in this butchery. I do think it is damaging the story and at this stage really confusing the show audience.

It should be an adaptation, not a fan fiction.Then why is it more popular now than it was in Season 1?
503	Steelegrave	2014-06-09	Am I the only one who thinks Jon walking out the gate might be the last we see of this storyline this season? Â There isn't a lot of good source material left after ASoS. Maybe the battle for the wall stretches into next season. Â Jon is obviously one of the leads in this show and he doesn't do a hell of a lot that makes for great television in the next 2 books.
Â 
I gave it an 8. Â Here's why:
Â 
1) Â Killing Pyp and Grenn was unnecessary. Â For the casual non-reader viewer, they weren't significant deaths. Â Most people I've talked to had no idea who they were. Â For the reader, at least for me, they were very important characters. Â They are Jon's boys, his support team and without them he really has nobody for his upcoming political battles. Â The scenes with them and Sam are some of the best from AFFC. Â They were senseless deaths that really had no impact on the drama and tension of the episode for most viewers.
Â 
2) Â I also blame GRRM for creating way too much hype for this battle with his interviews and blog posts (how about just writing and stay out of the media George). Â I, along with most fans, anticipated a lot and we got 3 Giants and a Mammoth attacking the gate and 10 guys climbing. Â One guy on the wall with some arrows and oil could've taken that down. Â The scythe was completely unnecessary. Â What exactly were the 10 climbers gonna do when they got to the top and faced 50 or so sworn brothers of the nights watch?
Â 
I think they missed a huge opportunity with Slynt and Gilly in the larder. Â If you're gonna make him a bumbling comic villain then you had an chance to have Gilly berate him as a coward.
Â 
I loved seeing it. Â Jon on top of the wall, the view down, the giants marching and riding mammoths. Â All that was epic and judging it purely on the basis of the show, it was one of the top 5 or 10 episodes.

I agree that they should not have cut it off before Stannis saved the day. That's his big moment, and instead of it being a climactic ending, it's just going to be some other scene that's forgotten amid buzz over events at King's Landing. No surprise, however, considering that D&D have turned Stannis from an underdog into an antagonist. Whatever takes the wind out of his sails, I reckon.
Â 
I also didn't like that they wimped out on Ygritte's death, although it was predictable as soon as that kid piped up about being the best shot in his village. Instead of Jon coming to grips with the fact that he could have - and for all intents and purposes, did - kill Ygritte, we just get some cliche Romeo and Juliet moment. Killing more of Jon's buddies was also gratuitous.
Â 
That said, the battle itself was awesome. They did a great job of capturing its enormous scope - the size of the wildling horde, the size of the wall, etc. The giants and mammoths were ferocious. The fight-scene choreography was excellent. Loved that they let Ghost loose.

506	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-09	I gave it a 9.5
Â 
Â For me it was better than Blackwater. I was more invested in the threat facing the characters and enjoyed the displays of heroism and humour sprinkled through the epicness- it was more than just the effects. I was really feeling the characters. They all stepped up and accepted their fate- Grenn and the Vow scene was beyond touching. They were fighting for survival (all brothers in arms) and notÂ just the usual power grab which made it unique for GoT. The whole thing was entertaining and movie worthy.
Â 
My only criticism (preventing a 10/10) is finishing 8 minutes early and not including the whole battle and Stannis showing up. Dragging it out to next week degrades the whole thing as other, more exciting events will be happening. They should have ended the episode with Stannis turning up and the battle ending.
Â 
I did enjoy that Jon was the hero of the final scene (being all matyr) but he could have easily had his shinningÂ moment in the final with the LC election. However, I doubt we will be getting that now. He was great though and Kit did awesome.
Â 
Overall, this will become a re-watch favourite! Awesome episode!
507	roxWolfox	2014-06-09	Â The World's Biggest WIndshield Wiper clearing the pesky climbers-- several characters we've grown to know over the past 4 seasons killing each other. Janos vs. his shit-stained pants.
Â 


Thank you for providing one of the few moments of levity on this thread.Â  
Â 

Also I don't know about anyone else, but i felt a bit sad when the two giants died?


I actually cried out at the death of the first one, "That better not be Wun Wun!"Â  Poor giant.Â  
Â 


Effect of D&D's adaptation. Stannis the Mannis is so blackwashed.


Couldn't help myself.Â  I loled for a while.Â  
Â 



Â Just vote what you really feel about the episode, and don't worry about what anyone else says.


I can't figure out why people are changing their votes simply because of the opinions of others ...Â  easily swayed maybe?Â  
Â 
 
Your avatar is perfect!Â  It gets a 10/10 from me.Â  
Â 


Did anyone else enjoy how Jon subdued (for a lack of a better word) Tormund? He totally owned that scene. Tormund's going to have a new found respect for Jonny boy.


Oh man.Â  I had an image of Robert's Rebellion Ned in that scene.Â  Fantastic!Â  Yep, Jon is becoming Ned Stark II.
Â 


Â but I absolutely LOVED Thorne in this episode, they made him into one BAMF. Of we both live you can go on hating me and I can go on wishing that wilding bitch of yours finished the job lol


As did I!Â  I felt guilty for hating him all these years ... I actually cheered for him ("GO ALLISER!!!") three different times!Â  I'm still in shock.Â  
Â 

For example, Missandei & GreyWorm.Â  I don't see any value in that romance story.Â The hint there being that GW may not be a eunuch (fine, it's a change from the books for what we know now) just goes against everything we've been given/shown/told.Â  if we find out in the next book that GW isn't actually a eunuch (somehow) and there is a romance for him, cool.


Whereas I got the impression that they were trying to humanise GreyWorm ... make him more than a baby/puppy-killing murder machine; someone who can appreciate beauty, and is trying to figure out human emotions.
Mind you, that's just my take on it, and it made me wanna hug GreyWorm, where in the books I would've been running in the opposite direction at the sight of him and his army.Â 
Â 


A message to all who are getting a little hot under the collar...
Why let an arbitrary number that somebody attributes to an episode of a TV show affect you so much? Just let it wash over you. Nothing is going to happen based on these ratings, you do know that right?
It's certainly not worth getting enraged over.


Like +100 (were it possible).
 
Â 


The whole episode nine is a fanfic. Not a single thing is taken from the books. Why? What's the purpose? It should be an adaptation, not a fan fiction.


I'm still waiting on a definition of fanfiction.Â  No one has been able to clarify the difference of adaptation and fanfiction clearly enough for my satisfaction. Any takers?Â  O.OÂ Â  Please?

508	Autumn is Coming	2014-06-09	Usually I don't care about the wall storylines at all. Even in the books I find myself kind of skim reading a little bit because it just doesn't interest me. This episode, however, is the first in the series that's had my full attention from start to finish (which admittedly wasn't difficult seeing as the episode itself wasn't very long) I was completely emotionally invested, which was a bad idea seeing as Pyp and Grenn died.
Even the initial scenes with Sam chatting with Jon and Aemon were interesting - the acting was great.
Â 
The show was never going to please everyone, just reading the comments shows it. On one side, you've got people arguing that there wasn't enough fighting, that the action scenes were poor or not of high quality. On the other you have people arguing that there should have been more plot and less action overall. It just highlights the fact that there will never be an episode that pleases everyone. Especially seeing as this forum loves to criticize each episode so harshly... (don't kill me for saying that, oh god)
Â 
I loved nearly everything. It felt like such a break from the normal structure of each episode, and I think that's what was needed after last week. Yeah it would've been great for Stanny to show up at the end, but the omittance of him doesn't render the episode as complete shit. I think including the scene of his arrival, scotch-taped onto the end, would've felt very rushed. Save it for the final episode, and make it the best finale yet.
Â 
Edited to add that Thorne is a fucking boss.

509	The New Alive	2014-06-09	Also, personally, I loved the way the show handled her death. Â After all the talk about wanting to kill Jon, in the end, her love for him caused hesitation and it cost her her life. Â I also loved that Jon, upon seeing her, simply smiled.. even though she was pointing an arrow at him at the time, his happiness in seeing her over ruled the fact that he may be about to die. Â  "Blah, blah, bloah, it was teh cheezy?!?".. well, it's a TV show and it made for interesting TV.


I did not notice him smiling, so I went back to look, and after seeing that smile... I just couldn't carry on watching. I'd thought that bit was the episode's weak point, but now I can't handle the fact that YGRITTE DIES! I knew it was going to happen, but now it hurts almost as bad as when I read it in the book!

I concur.
511	Andrey	2014-06-09	I'd also like to add, randomly, that I've read some reviews online this morning and a few say, in a negative way, that the show messed up by having Jon see who killed Ygritte. Â They say that in the book, Jon wasn't sure if he was the one that killed her. Â  Hmm... am I wrong in remembering that Jon knew he didn't kill her thanks to the type of feathers in the arrow shaft? Â  They were different than what he used during the battle.

519	mickyd	2014-06-09	id only give it a 5. the episode was very entertaining, and the battle scenes were awesome. However, being a reader of the books, i am dissappointed in the overall structure of the episode, and notÂ  just this one, most of the scenes from the wall have been changed imo for the worst. It all startedwith jon having to deal with the mutineers beyond the wall. it was a plot line not derived from the books and imo that should have been relpaced that with the wildlings storming castle black from the south. they could have then added the first siege from from notrh off the wall an episode or so earlier and then had another one this past episode plus jon going beyond the wall to treat with mance, then the arrival of stannis at the end of the episode. i think this could have added clarity to what all is happening up at the wall plus t would have freed some space to better explain what is going to happen is episode ten becasue from what i know they will need to cover a lot of plot points as well as leaving some out either for good or next season. anyways this is only my opinion, i love thrones and i love all 4 seasons but i think it coulda been better feel free to tear this apart or agree its all for the good of the real


Â 
perfectly said. Very entertaining. Â The acting has been superb and casting has been first rate, and has been generally (Dario  ) from the start. However in my Â mind season 4, and the whole way the wall was handled in season 4, Â has been the first sign that the producers may not be up to the taskÂ to carry off this adaptation, Â  though it might be beyond anyone's considering the wealth and depth of the source material.Â So much useless, made up BS earlier in the season and because of it we got a rushed battle compressed into one episode that lost it's epic scope. any attachment to the men fighting such odds (though the episode sure failed in that. A handful of men and a couple of giants) AND what could have and should have been THE climax which was Stannis arriving. Â Even as little as 15 to 20 minutes of screen time earlier in the season in place of the 'made up' TV scenes could have given the characters on the wall much more depth, and an climax that didn't leave you unfulfilled. Â I love the books, but felt nothing when Grenn and Pyp died. Â I had not attachment as a TV viewer to them. I didnt' even feel it for Ygritte and her death in the books nearly brought a tear to these otherwise jaded eyes. lolÂ 
Â 
I guess my point and overall fear is, highlighted by this episode, is that D&D will not be able to be up to the task of next season when characters splinter to new different locations and new VITAL characters are (will be right?) introduced. Â Time will be mighty tight for all the established beloved characters, with time needed for the new ones to be introduced and developed, AND for time make up to continue previous Â D&D plot inventions/deviations.
Â 
IF episode 9 was rushed, episode 10 willl exceed that by all they need to cover, and season 5 might lap both in. Â
520	aovalle	2014-06-09	EDITED FOR MY SCORE- 5/10
Â 
my rant; the action of of it was pretty amazing, but i felt like D&D have been dragging this out far too long. I had read about how season 4 was going to be the post-RW to the end of book 3. okay. But i've been discussing the end of the book events with my brother and friends, and there is so much that has to happen that i don't think there will be enough time in the final episode for EVERYTHING to happen. D&D could have done a lot better. The episode where Jon goes to craster's keep was very unnecessary and pointless. it didn't do anything to add to the storyline. I mean the battle of blackwater bay episode was its own episode. They couldve had the wildings raid CB from the beginning and go from there. and correct me if i'm wrong but wasn't there a whole battle with NW brothers and wildings protecting the gate? I dont remember Grenn dying. And the fact that John going on his own to treat with Mance is total bullshit. He was basically forced to do it to test if he was a traitor or a sworn brother in ASoS.Â 
Â 
My rant for the finale; why the hell is Dany even in it? When she dismisses Jorah in ASoS, that is her last part in the book. And that already happened in episode 8. So why is she being shown? Why is Bran have a part too? Unless it is finally going to include Coldhands, I see no point to his scene. And then the glimpse of Cersei talking to Tywin and Cersei making out with Jaime? I am so confused as is what is going to happen in the finale that I am pretty annoyed. this season had a lot of hype to live up to and once again i am thoroughly disappointed. The shit with Arya, Tyrion, John/Stannis and Lady Stoneheart should ONLY be in the finale.
Â 
maybe i'm being too much of a stickler and a hopeful reader for everything that happens in the books should happen in the show verbatim, but i don't see how fans of the books can keep watching hbo destroy the books any longer, even with the miniscule storyline changes

521	RadoLukacs	2014-06-09	9/10.
The whole thing was very good and I had chills when Grenn and his companions had their speech while waiting for the giant to come at them. The acting was pretty amazing, too. I think they did justice to Ygritte dying and I am glad they did not kill off Ser Alliser or Tormund. This episode actually felt like something out of this season, the ending when Jon faces the sun on the northern side of the Wall was almost like reading the book. It was great, almost flawless. Give me the finale! (And I think that if they open with a rather long sequence of Jon talking to Mance, the moment from the books can be represented quite fine without the scene being in an episode completely devoted to the Wall; I hope Alex Graves keeps true to Marshall's style of directing.)
Â 
Episodes 1-9:Â Â  7;10;8;9;10;8;9;10;9/10.
522	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-06-09	8 It was missing something (besides Stannis). The ending was anticlimactic and...meh.
523	taipan	2014-06-09	Gave it a 6. My lowest of the series.
I can understand why the TV watchers loved it. Plenty of action, great film work, minimal talking. Great.
Sadly the plot development was zero. Wildlings attack wall, Wildlings lose. Wildlings regroup to attack on the morrow. Couple of minor characters killed off. Traditionally episode 9 has to be the showpiece action episode so we got that. Stannis arriving at the end should have closed it off.
Now we have a crap load to be telescoped into episode 10.
524	Velociraptor	2014-06-09	I'm just gonna go ahead and give this a 10/10. The small nitpicking I may have had with the episode had nothing to do with objective quality, but more to do with my preferences. In terms of produciton quality this was amazing. And well rounded for an episode that focused on one event in one place. The cinematography was spectacular, particularly that shot circling the courtyard and showing all the different fighters. The fighting itself was good and looked realistic enough too. The show has recently gone a bit overboard with the fight choreography, abandoning realism in favor of cinematic spins, twirls, etc, but watching this episode more often than not the actors sold that they were really people fighting for their lives. The special effects deserve a recognition as well, I actually expected the show would cut the mammoths due to costs, but I was happy and impressed to see that one made it and looked spectacular to behold. All in all, I sincerely doubt this episode, focusing solely on the Battle for Castle Black could have been done any better.Â
525	Dru	2014-06-09	8 only because Pip and Gren. Why both?  Also, very slow start. Didnt expect Stannis this episode but hoped to hear his horns blowing arrival to end it. Yorin was amazing.
526	Bowen	2014-06-09	Ok I've put up with some bad episodes of late but this episode was amazing I thought and was a real pay off,yes I'd of liked it to have gone on longer but there were no fillers in this just pure excitement all the way.
Interesting insight into Jon being a Warg,we could see through ghosts eyes which  told us it was Jon I'm sure,diet like Pyp n Edds death though guess they were replacing Donal Noye.
All those that were wondering about Stannis,he doesn't turn up at this battle anyway so I'm fine with it,so glad they for the most part stayed true to the books it was as epic as the Blackwater I reckon.
527	Daenor	2014-06-09	10 for me.I really enjoyed this.My only complaint is that i wish we had seen the fight against the giant at the gate.I have complained in the past about changes in the books but i didn't mind today.This was a great adaptation for TV
528	Ye_Olde_Huorn	2014-06-09	7
Â 
It was a solid episode overall.Â 
Â 
I can get behind the opinion that it didn't feel particularly important, or decisive. After I finished watching it, I did actually question just how important/necessary handling the battle like this really was. I had fun, though I think there might have been better ways to go about it.Â 
Â 
One big negative was that the writing for this episode was really duff. I liked theÂ ideaÂ of some of the scenes, but the execution was a real misfire.Â 
Â 
I missed Mance. I wish we'd had at least a scene or two with him, commanding, given that it's his army and he has (supposedly) been the primary antagonist for this arc. The lack of identifiable faces amongst the Northern host was a disappointment; where was Rattleshirt, or someone to connect with. Season 3 dropped the ball with the Wildling bonding, there's no reason for us to care particularly for any of them, save Ygritte.Â 
Â 
Ygritte's death was another misfire. That whole sequence felt over-blown, like when they were on top of the Wall. It was too maudlin for my taste.Â 
Â 
Marshall's direction was good, the best of the season actually. He had several fun shots, including that aerial one of the Thenn's moving towards Castle Black. the tracking shot was good too. I liked a lot of the action ideas, especially the archer Giant. The CG was impressive.Â 
Â 
The scale was fine, they're on a limited budget. What we got was good, I thought; at least we had several expansive shots of the army. The score was forgettable (although that's been a consistent grievance for me throughout the season).Â 
Â 
On the whole, it was fun, visually nice, and I wouldn't mind if Marshall came back and did a 'regular' type episode.Â

529	Rashtibram	2014-06-09	I gave this one an 8. Absolutely fantastic from both a production and narrative standpoint, but it could have easily pulled a nine had the producers not chosen to hold off on Stannis' arrival. As it was, it was quite brilliant for the most part, from Sam cursing to Giants Riding Mammoths to Grenn's last stand to Edd holding the Wall to Jon vs. Styrâ<U+0080>¦the list goes on. While I would have liked to have seen more wide shots of the 100,000 men who were supposedly just out of sight within the trees, I understand the budgetary restrictions (here's to hoping we at least get a decent shot of Stannis' cavalry next weekÂ  ) and it didn't unduly bother me as the Wildlings' tactics in not displaying the full army made sense. I also loved the added nod to the "cost of revenge" theme of the season in Olly being the one to dispatch Ygritte.
Â 
This is my first 8 since 'The Rains of Castamere' and one of three episodes in the entire series to have pulled a rating higher than seven. Needless to say, I enjoyed itÂ
530	KingintheNorth99	2014-06-09	Solid 8/10, however, definitely no Blackwater!
531	Wolf Girl Arya	2014-06-09	I know this is an unpopular opinion but I am perfectly okay with Stannis not showing up in this episode.
Â 
The entire thing was about the Night's Watch and having Stannis show up to save the day would have cheapened it, in my opinion, not to mention would have felt out of place.
Â 
The set up in the episode was phenomenal. Jon becoming the hardened man to lead the NW, Janos Slynt being the douche that he is, Sam and Maester Aemon bonding, the fact that the NW is actually needed.Â 
Â 
The CGI was excellent and while there wasn't a whole lot of dialogue, it fit perfectly and got the point across. Â I'll admit, I broke down when Grenn started reciting the vows.
Â 
I knocked it down to an 8, mostly because of the lightening. Â Sometimes, it was hard to tell who was attacking whom, but it wasn't the worst.Â 
Â 
Stannis' arrival may just be the hopeful ending Sophie Turner was hinting at.
532	Jaqen H'gcarl	2014-06-09	Freaking awesome. Â One of the best 50 minutes of TV I've ever seen in my life.


Â 
ABSOLUTELY.Â 
Â 
This episode was BY FAR the best of the Season. Holy fuck this episode was awesome.
533	ServantOnIce	2014-06-09	10/10. Â Second best of the season behind, "The Mountain and The Viper."
534	KalibakCruel	2014-06-09	I honestly think this was one of the best episodes of the series. The camera work was awesome, everyone acted fantastically, it sets up a fun episode 10 and not just a boring tie up episode 10, the fights were well done and we actually saw cool characters crossing swords.
535	StannisForKing299AL	2014-06-09	Id give it a 9 for creativity and 7 for true to book. Over all its about an 9/10 for me. I think too many people are pissed because its not exactly like the book. I liked hot the focus was purely on the wall so we were focused on it. The choice to remove some key players was risky but made for some pretty sombre moments, i was pretty sad when Grenn died tbh because hed been a main man on the wall. Pyp kinda but not so much since we werent very attuned to him. Edd in command of the archers was a good scene. Slynt logic was pretty good "giants arent real, just a story" even when theyre knocking down the gates then running off to hide. Thorne/Tormund fight was awesome. Jon/Styr fight was good, i like how he used that 'trick' he learnt from the fockin legend of gin alley Karl Tanner. The only thing i didnt really like was Ygrittes death. Having the kid kill her wasnt the best move but it happened so ah well. Only down side for me was delaying Stannis' arrival but as anyone whos saw next weeks preview knows... hes coming to save the day. Could have been better but still a great episode, doesnt really suprise me it went over one episode since the battle in the books is pretty long and a lot had to happen in the constraints of a one hour episode. It was also good to see Kit top billed for once, i think it was the shortest billings yet, only 5 regualar cast members. On top of all that it's building to neat little knot for which to tie off season 4, then all we have to do is wait another year for season 5
536	Widows_Blood	2014-06-09	Probably my favorite episode of the series so far. The action sequences were fantastic. But the quieter scenes were very memorable to me as well. Maestor Aemon's monolgue was beautifully acted and written, Jon and Ygritte was wonderful (brought a tear to my eye) some of the action set pieces were fantastic as well. Loved it all.Â
537	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-09	Well, I'm sorry, guys, but as I was entertained yet again from start to finish, I gave this 10. Â And call me a soppy old fart, but I blubbed like a pillock when Ygritte stayed her arm and couldn't kill Jon. Â From that moment I was in Hollywood and didn't give a shit 
Â 
I'm not a CGI expert, nor do I go in for a lot of 'action films' - they bore me usually - so as some have pointed out here, maybe my expectations were lower. Â I was blown away by the epic scenes, the camera work and the lighting etc. etc.
Â 
And because I'd stayed around last night reading all your comments, I knew Stannis wasn't going to show up, so I could watch without that expectation. Â Don't worry, we'll get him next week. Â However, I do feel your pain. Â I'm a Stannis fan too and he has been sidelined all the way through. Â It amazes me that D&D hired an actor of Dillane's calibre only to waste him. Â They don't deserve him! Â But I think the Stannis problem is only an echo of all the other story lines that are somewhat squeezed out by the Tyrion-centric show this has become. Â I love Tyrion as a character, and like Dinklage, but it is so obvious he's been set up as THE main character in this tale. Â As much as I admire his cleverness and the political intrigues at KL, I really think the time spent there does a disservice to other parts of the saga. Â Hope this isn't too much of a sacrilege to you all, but I've wanted to get it off my chest for a little while now.
538	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	So why Jon only close Grenn's eyes? I mean there were give others there. I thought he cared about all his NW brothers. What a jerk. He doesn't deserve Lord Commander position.
Â 
No, but really, rethinking that it's just a little funny.
539	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-09	8 only because Pip and Gren. Why both? Also, very slow start. Didnt expect Stannis this episode but hoped to hear his horns blowing arrival to end it. Yorin was amazing.


Didn't Yorin die in Season 2?
540	Hodor's Dragon	2014-06-09	I think one reason that opinions vary fairly widely on this episode is that this episode was,Â by far, the episode most dominated by action and least by dialogue, characterization and acting. Â Even in the other "battle episode," otherÂ than the wildfire explosion to me the most memorable scenes were scenes of dialogue.
Â 
Action movies are very popular, but they are not appreciated by all. Â It's not surprising that different folks see this episode very differently.
541	HelenaExMachina	2014-06-09	So-so. Wasn't my favourite episode, but wasn't horrendous. Didn't bother me that there was no Stannis, but felt the battle dragged too long. I was ready for the episode to finish by the end. 5.5 rounded to 6
ETA: To elavorate a little more. I did not feel excited or tense at all. We had some Wildlings run at the Wall and start climbing...around 10 of them, a number which is obviously no real threat. Then we had a mammoth and some giants (I liked the visuals here) but only one lives and gets into the tunnel. Grenn vs the Giant could have been a scene that excited me. Also, the Nights Watch must be Wights, the amount of times they sprang back up in the yard. Lackluster to me. 
 Also disliked the over exaggeration of Janos Slynt. We already dislike him, no need to make him so grossly incompetent and cowardly as he was this episode.

You're thinking about Yoren. Â ;-) Â Yorin was the 17th wildling from the left on the big charge. Â He was amazing.
543	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-09	A message to all who are getting a little hot under the collar...
Why let an arbitrary number that somebody attributes to an episode of a TV show affect you so much? Just let it wash over you. Nothing is going to happen based on these ratings, you do know that right?
It's certainly not worth getting enraged over.


A woman after my own heart. Â (Or man, of course - I shouldn't take user names for granted  )

545	The Reader Lisa	2014-06-09	As to the show's increasing popularity, are you familiar with the expression "There are lies, damn
lies and statistics"?Â  I'm cynical about stats.How could one possibly verify the figures? Knock on
every door in the world and take a census?
Â 
As to why people continue to watch the show who are disappointed in it? Quite frankly,Â  it has
become my surrogate MST3K. I enjoy rolling my eyes, groaning at its cheesiness and bursting
out laughing at truly ridiculous moments. Of which there have been so many since Season 1.
Any episode now I expect to see some extra wearing a Rolex or smoking a cigarette, a vapor
trail in the background. And then I can come to the Forum and read people explain it away as
some truly awesome or clever move on D&D's part. I'll enjoy that too!
Â 
Let's be honest, who doesn't rubberneck at the scene of an accident? Sometimes, a person
you like is part of the accident...say Stannis or Sansa....and you lose your objectivity and
become upset and rail against Fate.....but then you go back to rubbernecking despite the
big cop waving you past and saying "Show's over....nothin' to see here."
546	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	I watched the episode again and it wasn't half as bad the second time. No Stannis is still a complete cop out and completely takes away the glory of his moment(And Davos since it was his plan!).Â 
Â 
The Battle for Castle Black is amazing despite a few hiccups and terrible parts.
Â 
The Battle for the Wall just had no tension or suspense. Slowly watching the giants attach ropes to the gates was a joke.Â
547	Mulled Wino	2014-06-09	the worst episode I"ve even seenÂ
548	Zeppelin	2014-06-09	I wasn't looking forward to this episode for 2 reasons.
Â 
I didn't want a whole episode filled with one storyline, especially a continuing battle throughout. With only one episode left to go in the series, there's lots more going on throughout the realm that I wanted to get into.
Â 
My guts and heart were torn out last week after Oberyn's fight and death. I need to mourn with Ellaria and I need to share the shock and consequences of this tragedy with Tyrion. I don't want an interlude battle episode as a commercial break. Jeeeezus, they may as well give me a 10 minute beetle speech before the Mountain/Oberyn fight 
Â 
In saying that, I was pleasantly surprised with this episode. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it.
I didn't mind the character interactions before the fight, or the vocal exchanges during it. There was some touching moments pre and during the fight, but I thought some of the actual fight sequences cheesey and didn't wince once at any of the gore. Who the hell thought it feasible for Alliser Thorne to do a little sword jab around a pole?!
Â 
Samwell Tarley was the stand out character in this episode for me. Maester Aemon shone in his scene (as he always does),Ygritte's death was also moving.
Â 
One thing I was really grateful for, was no Stannis marching in to be the hero of this episode. This one was about the Wall, the Nights Watch, let them shine. Stannis will come to the rescue in due time, as he did in the book.
Â 
I usually rewatch the episodes at least 4 or 5 times, this one i've watched twice and won't bother again (until i'm going through withdrawals in the off season)
Â 
Better than I was expecting, but far from loving this episode. I gave it a 6
549	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-09	Only 19.43% of those who voted believed the episode was a 6 or less. 80.57% actually rated it higher. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
550	Derfel Cadarn	2014-06-09	I cheered Ser Alliser over Tormund??Â 
Â 
I liked it, but when did the Nights Watch invent cloning tech?Â  Way too many gusrdsmen, or rather they should never have numbered them at 100.Â  And what happened to Terminus people?Â  One minute he had wiped out most of the nights watch, next he was the last wildling standing.
Â 
It felt messy. Spartacus had better battle scenes, especially the finale.
551	Mulled Wino	2014-06-09	Only 19.43% of those who voted believed the episode was a 6 or less. 80.57% actually rated it higher. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

I just can't do it this time.... I am going to have to think on it for a day or two, and do a rewatch.Â 
Â 
Summary thoughts - really reallyÂ surprised they didn't do the full sequence up to the Stannis arrival. I don't have a problem with that per se, but I do have to reassess my position based on that knowledge.Â 
Â 
I do want to toss something out there though - about the lack of numbers of Wildlings (and I know this was never supposed to be about the full weight of Mance's army)... and the assertion it is because of budget. I'll just say this: "Mhysa"

Lol this is exactly the kind of shit most people go nuts over. Forget all the well written drama and raw human emotion, just overload us with action and violence because our attention spans are so short. Sad ain't it?Â
565	Corvinus	2014-06-09	I've just re-watched both Blackwater and this episode back to back. I like them both about equally.
IMO, the Wall had better visuals (FX, camera etc.) and also better action choreography. Blackwater had better dialogue, though the Wall is not far behind, and more plot development thanks to the battle being brought to a conclusion. The feel of urgency and stakes are about the same, both episodes feeling like they passed really quickly. The Wall also had more drama during the action scenes - there were notable deaths on both sides, while Blackwater had none; Blackwater did add drama with Tyrion's injury and some of the dialogue. The performances of the actors were great in both episodes, but Lena takes the crown.
If I am being subjective, I like the Wall better, because it's my favorite battle in the books, too.Â
566	Mr Hodor	2014-06-09	After giving this episode a low rating yesterday i rewatched it. Though there were some cheesy lines, it was a good episode on par with blackwater.
Â 
My major peeve was not the delayed stannis, but the absent trap to kill Styr and the wildlings.
Â 
Other than that it was a good episode. The chain on the wall was awesome, Ygritte, Pyp and Grenn was sad. Loved that Jon snow learned to fight dirty from Focking Karl of Focking Gin Alley.
567	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-09	Lol this is exactly the kind of shit most people go nuts over. Forget all the well written drama and raw human emotion, just overload us with action and violence because our attention spans are so short. Sad ain't it?Â 

You gotta take it for what it's worth.  It's a show, it's never going to truly depict the books.  The plot hasn't changed, so what's the problem?  I can understand when characters are omitted, I get why that upsets people.  But a few changes here and there aren't the end of the world. 
We are all GRRM and ASOIAF fans.  This show was made to make new fans.  The point is to gain new fans and have more people go out and read the books, and unfortunately you have to throw love bullshit into the mix, you have to have moments like Jon and Ygritte to get more people to watch. 
It was an action scene, a battle, and I thought they did a great job.  It wasn't Helms deep, but it was still pretty awesome.  There are episodes like the Trial episode where acting and dialogue rules, and that episode was bad ass, but just because there is action and blood and guts doesn't make it any less entertaining, just like dialogue heavy episodes aren't any less entertaining.  We just have to take it for what it is, a TV show "based" on a book series.
"This (insert any show here) was a true and accurate representation of the book.

What made anyone think that was going to change when Game of Thrones was brought to HBO?

Â 
I believe there was plenty of drama and raw human emotion:
Â 
1) Sam the self-admitted coward finally decides to fight for Gilly (starting with "open the fucking gate!!") Â and steals a kiss while he's at it.
2) Jon tries to put his relationship with Ygritte into words...and fails.
3) Ygritte tries very hard to hide her love for Jon Snow...and fails.
4) Maester Aemon reveals he too has suffered a broken heart for duty.
5) Thorne begrudgingly admits to Jon Snow that he was wrong, and admits he's been a prick, but if they can put their mutual hatred aside, they can hope to survive and get back to hating each other.
6) The very orphan whose father Ygritte killed returns the favor.
7) Sam actually COMFORTING someone else during a battle (Pip).
8) The look on Edd's face as he suddenly "has the Wall." Â ("Shit, ME??? Â But I just stand around and make smartass comments!")
9) Ygritte's revealing the Wildlings' bitterness at being forever excluded from the rest of the realms.
Â 
Seems that people who hate the episode have two major complaints: Â It took too long to get to the battle, what with all the tedious annoying talking and drama, and there wasn't enough talking and drama which made the battle tedious and annoying.

Â 
There's tons of drama and emotion in the episode, moreso than action, to be honest.Â
570	ground_control	2014-06-09	9 of 10 -- After my first view, I was going to give it a 6 (base 7 for an overall strong episode, -1 for cheap comparisons to last week I was going to make), but I don't cast my vote until after a second viewing, and I was really glad I waited this time.
Â 
While not *quite* as hyped as last episode (no two week break, and the prior episode build-up scenes were "very weak", especially compared to the multiple Tyrion & friend in dungeon scenes), it was definitely much awaited by book fans. Â Unlike last episode, where the "main event" got about 6 minutes of screen time that felt tacked on to the end of the episode, this episode's "main event" was very much front and center.
Â 
The main reason I'm not giving this episode a '10' is the "average" quality of the dialog -- no dialog really impressed me, and a few lines were pretty bad, but no scene overall struck me as horrible (well, some did on first viewing, but on my rewatch, it was more specific lines than entire scenes that irked me).
Â 
I think the story this week was pretty true to both the books and the (fortunately few references made to) prior show-only scenes. Â I don't get people griping about "no Stannis" -- in the books, the rag tag Watch holds off the Wildlings for several days before more Nights Watch reinforcements arrive, and then Thorne and Slynt send Jon off to kill Mance, which is how this episode ended. Â I was disappointed that Grenn and Pyp died, but that's because I like them. Â I thought they died well, which is much better than other characters (Locke, Karl) can say. Â Their deaths didn't feel cheap, and I think the episode would have had less impact without a Named character dying (and just introducing Donal Noye to die this episode would feel cheap, as would have having no-names die in his place -- Grenn was (imo) one of the best "younglings" at the wall, so losing him is a hurt to the Wall that you can feel).
Â 
I'm glad the show gave Thorne a chance to show his "true colors" as a dedicated man of the Night's Watch; in contrast, I was a little disappointed by how cowardly they made Slynt look; he is supposed to be corrupt, not incompetent. Â At least they didn't give him the complete Mace Tyrell = Tool treatment.
Â 
While I didn't like the elevator speed, I think that having the battle fought on both fronts at once (instead of Castle Black, then Mance's forces like in the books) really worked for the show -- in books, cutting back and forth would be distracting, but the use of long shots while going back and forth a few times really made it feel like one huge battle.
Â 
Anyway, I gave last episode a '1' for totally missing the "epic" feel of the main event; this week's episode shows the level of focus and integration I would have like to have seen. Â Not necessarily 100% of the episode at King's Landing, just a feeling that the duel was "main event" and everything else revolved around it.

571	new djinn	2014-06-09	A 7 for me. Good acting overall, great technical skill in the direction and photography, good CGI. But the writing really hurts the ranking. Over-extended cheesy scenes(sex by Jon, love by Aemon, Gilly shuttle), predictable deaths, missing third act and some over the top stretches of disbelief(anvil head, ghost locked,Â strangle Mance, no plan vs Tormund group).
572	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-09	I have to give this episode a 9 out of 10.
Â 
Sam killed it dialog-wise. He had the best lines overall. Loved Thorne's admission he was wrong. He proved to be a true man of the Watch, and the fight with Tormund was pure pleasure to watch.
Â 
Ygritte's death was a little too staid for me. I had no feeling except yay. But I did love the nod from Olly to Jon. Sometimes karma isn't a bitch, but a kid with a grudge.Â

Good One. I should do it for all seasons a week after episode 10
People really liked tyrion's speech i guess
583	valacirca	2014-06-10	People really liked tyrion's speech i guessyup.and hated the rape scene
584	oierem	2014-06-10	The more I think about it, the more I like the fact that they didn't include Stannis. A sudden arrival saving the day at the last minute would've felt like Blackwater all over again. And it would've diminished the importance of the NW and Jon Snow in the defense of the Wall.
Â 
What they did is much closer to what happens in the books. The northern and southern attack happen simultaneously, but once the action ends, the battle is not over and Jon has to go to try to kill Stannis (which, in the show, is a much more heroic moment because he is the one who decides to go).
Â 
And as the producers repeatedly said, the climax of this season will happen in episode 10. For EVERY storyline including the Wall.
585	Bonifer Tasty	2014-06-10	Just didn't work for me. Â They should have had this part of the attack happen much earlier in the season, and its delay, with no Stannis appearance, just felt anti-climactic to me. Â  I also thought there would be no Mance, which was irritating me, but at least it looks like next week they have a scene with him.
Â 
I gave it a 3. Â It was my least favorite episode all ALL seasons.
586	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	9/10
Haters gon hate.
587	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	Lack of Stannis was fine because he doesn't show up until later anyway. 
All the fights were good. 
Sam was awesome. 
All deaths I felt were really sad. 
Episode captured the hopeless bravery of the men of the nights watch. 
Grenn was awesome.
588	sati	2014-06-10	Plot armour is the strongest armour.


 Â  Â
589	Jdawg Laurence	2014-06-10	Good episode, but the hype was built up a little too much imo. Â It was very well done and there were some completely epic scenes, like the blade cutting across the ice! Â The Ygritte-Jon scene was also well done, and I thought they combined the two battles quite well considering they were at separate times in the books. Â The way they managed to get Jon commanding on the wall as well as him seeing Ygritte dying was great. Â Main disappointment to me was that they didn't show the mammoth wreaking havok when it got scared by the explosions, but that would probably have cost them a ton more.
Â 
I gave it an 8/10. Â Can't wait for next week!
590	spivo	2014-06-10	I gave it a 7.
It's a good long fight, but I like aGoT for the intrigue and plotting.
Â 
The "head on anvil" was annoying, as was the throwing through stuff afterwards. Styr has no reason to prolong his fight with Jon, just to continue bashing his head on the anvil until it was a bloody pulp.
I would have preferred Alliser to shine down there, and show just why he is Master-at-Arms, maybe even have him save Jon and say the line: "We can go on hating when this is over" then.
Â 
And finally, to much will be cramped in to episode 10, or postponed to season 5.
591	The hairy bear	2014-06-10	I gave it an eight. It's the highest mark I've given this season, shared by a couple episodes more. It was a fine action episode with excellent direction, but still, I don't think it deserves a nine.
592	Dragon Queen	2014-06-10	I gave it a 10, best episode of the season.
It was a great change of pace having the entire episode at one place, it felt nice to not switch between POV to POV. It seemed like a short movie to me.
I think given all the events that happen, having Stannis show up last minute to save the day wouldn't have worked. I think they would have run out of time. His rescue of the Wall would have been reduced to, "And then Stannis showed up, they chanted his name and he won! Cool!" And then they wouldn't have had time to explain how the Night's Watch won.
I loved the last scene between Ygritte and Jon. I teared up at it, like I did reading the book. Their last words to each other feel so poignant and sad.
Honestly, episode 9 has been built up so much for crazy shit to go down, I bet the Unsullied still have scars from the Red Wedding (and many in shock from Oberyn's death last ep). I'm glad it was a nice long battle instead of crazy political intrigue and killing major characters (Season 1- Ned, Season 3 - Robb, Talisa, Catelyn). If someone major dies every season in episode 9, it might make the show too predictable. The Unsullied I know seem quite depressed about all the deaths and about Tyrion, and I think they could use a win right now.
593	The Killer Snark	2014-06-10	The last two episodes, IMO, were better, but the ayes seem to have it (though I won't go beyond a 9). Boy, that's a lot of 10s. I think that people may be overrating it somewhat, however, because it's the first episode this series which is just a load of action going on. Objectively, more actually happened in the majestic episode 7.
594	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-06-10	The last two episodes, IMO, were better, but the ayes seem to have it (though I won't go beyond a 9). Boy, that's a lot of 10s. I think that people may be overrating it somewhat, however, because it's the first episode this series which is just a load of action going on. Objectively, more actually happened in the majestic episode 7.

I started rated them based on other episodes and not by what my expectations were.  That's why this episode got a 10 for me, only 3 others received 10's, season 0110 season0309 and season0209.
595	JagLover	2014-06-10	Wanted to give it a 10.
Â 
But I felt for what actual story progression was accomplished it was a little dragged out and the fighting down below went on too long for such limited forces being involved.
Â 
So a 9 from me, but some moments of great quality in the episode.
Â
596	Beldaros	2014-06-10	Long time reader/viewer and forum lurker. First time poster.
Â 
I have had kind of a love hate relationship with the series so far, I thought the first season was pretty amazing, the second season was very weak, the third was almost there and the fourth is finally doing what it should be.
Â 
I no longer think of the show as an adaptation of the books but instead a seperate story based on the books.
Â 
Anvil to face and giant bowman aside, this episode is probably the best one of all in terms of giving characters real purpose and meaningful turns (especially Allister)
Â 
Pyp and Grenns deaths really got to me, especially as I couldn't predict them. Especially Pyp, as he foreshadowed his own fate by saying a sword didn't belong in his hand or words to the same effect. And Grenn was a suitable replacement for the one armed smith, as in the show we are fully invested in Grenn's character and his death was suitably heroic.
Â 
Ygritte's death, though different, hit home just as hard for me, props to the actors there. Sam finally found some balls and I gained 10x respect for Allister putting all his grudges aside for the good of the wall and the realm of men and taking on one of the most dangerous enemies in the field.
Â 
From a purist point of view I could find issue with this episode but treating it as a seperate entity... wow.
Â 
The giant using a bow with the same power as a scorpion struck me as too silly, and the chain to an extent. The face into anvil would have also lead to the death of a real person with little doubt, certainly put the person out of contention for the rest of the day/week at the very least. I'm also not sure how I feel about coward Janos, after all he was leader of an elite unit of soldiers in the capital, has he never been in a fight that wasn't a certain victory? I guess not.
Â 
Unlike many, I was never that impressed by Blackwater, but this epic battle episode delivered.
Â 
My first 10.
597	sj4iy	2014-06-10	Same reason I finally binge watched The Wire and Breaking Bad. More people deciding to try it.

No, because if it sucked now, they wouldn't KEEP watching it every week, and the internet wouldn't be teeming with reaction videos, parodies, reviews, recaps, etc.  This season has been absolutely amazing, in terms of quality and reception.  The first season had great moments, but we don't really get into the 'game' until Ned is killed.
598	rmholt	2014-06-10	No, because if it sucked now, they wouldn't KEEP watching it every week, and the internet wouldn't be teeming with reaction videos, parodies, reviews, recaps, etc.  This season has been absolutely amazing, in terms of quality and reception.

Also true
599	Abaddon21	2014-06-10	9/10 from me.so long waiting sto see a really good fight on GOT.really enough us i expect.i am new on this forum.i wish see John <stark> one day on iron throne  if anyone greek can tell me how can i found the next book for 5 seazon to buy.
600	vividox	2014-06-10	10/10 for me. Loved what I saw. We all know Stannis is coming, they haven't shown it yet, so, IMO, it's kind of silly to knock this episode for not getting to what comes next. As a 50 minute show, it was entertaining as hell. The only knock slight nitpick I had was I wanted to see more in the tunnel fight. More like in the book where the bodies are piling on top of each other and blocking the way. All Grenn & Co. had to fight was one giant who didn't even bother to hold the door open for his friends.
601	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-10	No, because if it sucked now, they wouldn't KEEP watching it every week, and the internet wouldn't be teeming with reaction videos, parodies, reviews, recaps, etc. This season has been absolutely amazing, in terms of quality and reception. The first season had great moments, but we don't really get into the 'game' until Ned is killed.


Â 
Reception? A fig for reception! Some of the worst trash on television is also the best-received. Argument ad populum.
Â 
The show is good, no doubt, but readers are right to complain about the decline in the writing and plot. Those have gone downhill, unquestionably. The fact that this season has included two tangents which consumed a huge amount of time and did absolutely nothing to advance the story (Asha's aborted rescue of Theon and Bran's capture by Karl "fucking" Tanner) should disqualify the season from being "absolutely amazing in terms of quality."
Â 
When HBO follows the books, what they do is great. When they make necessary changes/adaptations, it's alright. When they invent their own material, it's abysmal. It's not that we're against any changes; we're just against HBO's ill-conceived ideas. I can't wait for the epic conclusion of Missandei and Grey Worm's dickless love this Sunday!

602	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	9. Not much wrong with it at all
603	Juan_Snow	2014-06-10	Lol this is exactly the kind of shit most people go nuts over. Forget all the well written drama and raw human emotion, just overload us with action and violence because our attention spans are so short. Sad ain't it?Â 


Says the guy with the most graphically violent avatar on the board.
604	The Reader Lisa	2014-06-10	There has been a lot of discussion of what an adaptation is and isn't. Yes, it does not have to be a word
for word depiction of the original material. It doesn't even have to be set in the same time period or in
the original language. Kurasowa based several of his films on Shakespeare's plays, 10 Things I Hate
About You is a very enjoyable, modern day version of The Taming of the Shrew and Clueless I've
often felt is closer to the original spirit of Emma than some of the period drama versions of it. But the
plot should still be recognizable and the author's intentions in writing the work honored. Otherwise, it's
a parody.
Â 
What HBO and D&D have given us is not an adaptation but a mutation. They've acted like some kind of
radiation and turned the show into a rampaging behemoth trampling Martin's beautiful and intricate plot
like it's Tokyo. They've changed characters' personalities and story arcs almost out of recognition; and
what I worry about is this mutation spreading and affecting, infecting the books yet to come. Martin should
be flattered people care this much about his work (more than he seems to) and HBO and D&D should
be flattered that they've gotten such a reaction from his fans. And please let's stop calling D&D's efforts
fanfiction. Since they've basically vandalised the books, vanfiction seems more appropriate.
605	A Redeemed Hound	2014-06-10	Gave it a solid 9. Â My highest score all season I think. Â Two things that bothered me were
Â 
1. Not nearly enough Ghost. Â Completely changed how important he is to Jon in the show as opposed to the books. Â 
Â 
2. So Tormund and the Thenns were camping out just over a hill not 100 yards away and the Watch never saw them? Â Even with cook fires and such? Â That was sloppy and funny in a bad way.
606	Defeatarion	2014-06-10	Gave it a solid 9. Â My highest score all season I think. Â Two things that bothered me were

I said the same exact thing. "Uh, you mean they were just sitting down there the whole time?"Â
607	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-10	Gave it a solid 9. Â My highest score all season I think. Â Two things that bothered me were

Â 
1. Completely agree here. Ghost should at the very least have gone North with Jon. I think the writers often forget Ghost exists.
Â 
2. I think the distance was supposed to be greater, but what was the NW supposed to do? Leave Castle Black and fight them? Jon notes they want to draw them out, but it did seem a bit close to me as well.

Bravo.
609	lil' ghost	2014-06-10	i thought it was great for show. there were a few parts I was thinking "well that's different, or that's different" but D&D made it work. i enjoyed the episode a lot, but i do wish it would have been a bit longer.. i hope the season finale won't be 53 minutes.. give us the full hour!
610	A Redeemed Hound	2014-06-10	It would have been stupid as hell if Stannis just came out of nowhere during the first part of an epic battle. Â What is wrong with you people?
611	roxWolfox	2014-06-10	Â 
Â I can't wait for the epic conclusion of Missandei and Grey Worm's dickless love this Sunday!

What importance does a penis have where love is concerned?
612	ser piggy of horn hill	2014-06-10	It would have been stupid as hell if Stannis just came out of nowhere during the first part of an epic battle. Â What is wrong with you people?


as long as he does arrive and smash the wildlings then no problem.Â  if he just strolls up to castle black without fighting , then it would be lame and unforgivable on D and D's part.
613	Buckbeak	2014-06-10	8 - Thought the ending could have been better and I dont really like the scenes between Gilly and Sam. A bit cringe worthy for me! Apart from that it was pretty good.Â
614	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-10	As to the show's increasing popularity, are you familiar with the expression "There are lies, damn
lies and statistics"?Â  I'm cynical about stats.How could one possibly verify the figures? Knock on
every door in the world and take a census?
Â 
As to why people continue to watch the show who are disappointed in it? Quite frankly,Â  it has
become my surrogate MST3K. I enjoy rolling my eyes, groaning at its cheesiness and bursting
out laughing at truly ridiculous moments. Of which there have been so many since Season 1.
Any episode now I expect to see some extra wearing a Rolex or smoking a cigarette, a vapor
trail in the background. And then I can come to the Forum and read people explain it away as
some truly awesome or clever move on D&D's part. I'll enjoy that too!
Â 
Let's be honest, who doesn't rubberneck at the scene of an accident? Sometimes, a person
you like is part of the accident...say Stannis or Sansa....and you lose your objectivity and
become upset and rail against Fate.....but then you go back to rubbernecking despite the
big cop waving you past and saying "Show's over....nothin' to see here."

I might rubberneck at an accident, but I wouldn't actively seek one out to view once a week, 10 weeks of the year for 8 years...
615	Zachary Snow	2014-06-10	The action sequences were absolutely amazing.... Marshall topped his work on blackwater the way it was shot was incredible and i love any time when Jon and ghost are shown being bad ass. Â They kept all of the important parts from the book and made it amazing for tv.... i didn't expect the episode to end like that but i guess they'll have to fit the rest into the finale. Â the giants were awesome too 10/10 Â my only gripe, which is very small, was that the archers on the top of the wall needed someone to tell them to fire arrows. Â i guess they had to do that to show Jon taking command it just seemed kinda silly.... like just fire the fucking arrows
616	Zachary Snow	2014-06-10	Â 
1. Completely agree here. Ghost should at the very least have gone North with Jon. I think the writers often forget Ghost exists.
Â

I want more ghost.... all the time, i have a 6 month old husky i named ghost. Â when i seen him in the cage at crasters i flipped out. Â how the hell did they get him in the cage? theres no way they got him or summer out of a trap and into that cage without the wolves tearing 20 people apart. Â that was the worst part of the red wedding, how grey wind died. Â in the books he kills dogs and rips a guys arm off while getting shot with crossbows. Â i love any scene with the wolves
617	Ghost of Snow	2014-06-10	I gave it Â a 9/10 score. It was almost perfect, with good special effects, nice dialogues and Jon Snow being the badass we know he is in the books. The only reason I didn't gave it a perfect score was the limited screen time of Ghost.
618	teej6	2014-06-10	Gave it a solid 9. Â My highest score all season I think. Â Two things that bothered me were
Â

Â 
2. So Tormund and the Thenns were camping out just over a hill not 100 yards away and the Watch never saw them? Â Even with cook fires and such? Â That was sloppy and funny in a bad way.
Regarding Ghost: 'I need him more than I need you' <U+00F0><U+009F><U+0089>. But agree, they've marginalized Ghost's importance in Jon's storyline <U+00F0><U+009F>!
619	Talking Hodor	2014-06-10	It was over too soon!Â  I guess this could count as a positive, since I was so into it that the abrupt ending jarred me.Â  Plus they killed some key characters off who are still alive and kickin' in the books.Â  It's not like they ever had a lot of named characters at Castle Black anyway.Â  Now if feels like they've reduced that number by half.
Â 
Nonetheless, it was a very good episode!Â  The musical score rocked.
620	~No One~	2014-06-10	Nonetheless, it was a very good episode!Â  The musical score rocked.

Amen, Hodor! I think Ramin's score went a loooooong way to making the 30-min action sequence so tense and exciting!
621	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-10	Has anybody counted up how many Night's watch men died?
622	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Has anybody counted up how many Night's watch men died?

45 ish on camera, at least another half a dozen unless Ygritte's an awful shot
623	sj4iy	2014-06-10	Amen, Hodor! I think Ramin's score went a loooooong way to making the 30-min action sequence so tense and exciting!


Â 
My absolute favorite part in the episode is where Jon jumps off the elevator, kills a few people, then stops (and the music stops)....looks around...then *cue music* and he starts fighting just as the 360 track shot begins. Â It was so, so perfect in every single way and sent a shiver of excitement down my spine.
624	SummerSong	2014-06-10	Hmm... am I wrong in remembering that Jon knew he didn't kill her thanks to the type of feathers in the arrow shaft? They were different than what he used during the battle.
Â 
Also, personally, I loved the way the show handled her death. Â After all the talk about wanting to kill Jon, in the end, her love for him caused hesitation and it cost her her life. Â I also loved that Jon, upon seeing her, simply smiled.. even though she was pointing an arrow at him at the time, his happiness in seeing her over ruled the fact that he may be about to die.


Â 
You're right that Jon knew he didn't kill her due to the arrow feathers. Ygritte's death scene in the show was excellently handled, a satisfying farewell.
Â 


This episode was about the bravery of a few NW brothers holding the wall through impossible odds. Â  Having Stannis ride in at the end and save the day would have distracted from that. Â  The way D&D did it, we get both. Â We get the NW being heroic and next week, we'll get Stannis riding in to help. Â  And I'm not a D&D apologist in the least. Â I mostly hate how little they've built up the wall, as it's my favorite locale in the books, but I completely agree with giving the NW their due for an episode without having some other entity rush in to save the day.


Â 
  Â Though I'm not a big fan of major battle scenes, this episode ROCKED. The NW was finally center stage, displaying heroism and impressive skill in the face of certain doom. The action was edge-of-your-seat tense, heartbreaking and visually stunning, both at a personal level and on a grand scale. It was great to see Jon's leadership skills in action. Kudos to the director and show runners.
Â 
[edit] Â I gave it a 9.

625	Hodor's Dragon	2014-06-10	Has anybody counted up how many Night's watch men died?


Â 
It's ambiguous since it's often hard to tell Night's Watch from wildlings, but I'd say at least 31 + 3 seriously injured + several more ambiguous as to allegiance dead + several more shots from Ygritte where we can't see the destination but I think we're supposed to think she's deadly.
Â 
When I say "at least 31" I'm assuming that a sword blow to the head or torso or an arrow to the torso is fatal. Â With the medical treatment options these guys had - and Thoros not around - it probably was.

627	StannisForKing299AL	2014-06-10	No, I think people really are just that tasteless.

Its nit tastelessness to like something you dont. Too many people are pissed because "it didnt happen the way i imagined when i read it" but still they did the best with what was available. Sure it wasnt as good as blackwater and somethings were changed from the book but thats always gonna happen in adaptation and tbh it was fun to watch a battle, especialy after the ten minuite conversation about beetle crushing last week, perhaps instead of a battle Tormund could have told us all a story about how he f'd a bear with who was soft below, had sharp fangs and knew how to use em. This episode was always going to be just the wall. It had to be, it would be so shitty to interupt all that by cutting away to daeny so we can see her 'interesting' story develop, and be constantly reminded of her many pointless titles, or Varys so he can remind us all that he has no penis, hell maybe even Cersei could pop up and remind us all shes still as bitchy as ever...
628	Steve Stark	2014-06-10	Am I the only one who thinks Jon walking out the gate might be the last we see of this storyline this season?Â 


Â 
Nope, me and some guys at work talked about this as well. That might be it for him this season.
Â 
EDIT: never mind. I saw him in the promo.

Â 
Would have loved it, but they killed Grenn and Pyp for fuck's sakes.
Â 
Highly suspect either or both of those characters have parts to play in the novels, so, way to go.
Â 
Of course, when you don't ever introduce the one armed blacksmith (Donal Noye iirc?), I suppose Grenn's got to eat it when he goes into the tunnels.
Â 
The action was really well choreographed imho. Allister Thorne actually looked like a guy who knew what to do with a sword.
630	WildlingButcher	2014-06-10	Best episode ever 11/10
Â 
WHY?
Â 
less talk, more action
Â 
the best parts
Â 
the battle: A horde of 100.000 against 100 EPIC!
Â 
the scythe is:so fucking cool (brilliant D&D)
Â 
Jon Snow and Alliser Thorne are fucking killing maschine
Â 
the potato boy: Like a boss
Â 
the wildlings; Â scum you really want to be dead. Only a dead wildling is good wildling.Â 
Â 
Gren the Giant Slayer
Â 
the giants were cool designed monsters
Â 
the butcher cook
Â 
the death of Ygritte: what a vile bitch
Â 
Ghost eating wildlings
Â 
Stannis not stealing the show (he is so boring ... Â  Â show and books)Â 
Â 
Jon Snow is going Kamikaze to save the Wall
Â 
negative
Â 
not enough violence (was hoping for more explicit scences)
Â 
not showing the battle with Grenn and the giant
Â 
Maester Aemon. Â A old man talking about woman is creppy (Waste of time)
Â 
Gilly/Sam is not hot, it's embrassing to watch (more Waste of time)
Â 
Tormund survived (why wouid you let a animal who killed a dozen of your men and hundred pf peasants let alive?)
Â 
Â 
The Show is better than the books at this moment.Â 
I really hope they will cut all the lame parts from the next books.

631	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-10	Â I'm also not sure how I feel about coward Janos, after all he was leader of an elite unit of soldiers in the capital, has he never been in a fight that wasn't a certain victory? I guess not.
Â 
.


Â 
I wouldn't put 'The City Watch' in the same category as 'Elite Unit of Soldiers'. They were paid thugs in armour used to quell violence in Flea Bottom - or start it if the price was right.
632	Pure Guava	2014-06-10	Easiest and only 10/10 from me, ever.
Â 
My favorite scene from the book translated so 'effing well on the show. I was terrified it wouldn't live up, it couldn't possibly live up, my god how could it live up? And while it's not as intense...it was close to being the damn finest hour of television I've ever seen. Most of the criticism I've seen so far was that "nothing happened" or "I don't care about the wall or Jon Snow". Well....TOO BAD. Because that story is a helluva lot more important than all your golden children in Politico Landing.Â

Such a shame the show has failed to communicate that point for the last 3 seasons.
635	StannisForKing299AL	2014-06-10	as long as he does arrive and smash the wildlings then no problem.Â  if he just strolls up to castle black without fighting , then it would be lame and unforgivable on D and D's part.
Watch the preview of the next episode, you shall not be dissapointed
636	roxWolfox	2014-06-10	I take it that you have never seen the Die Hard movies?


I've watched the Die Hard movies on television ... and they usually cut out the best scenes and best lines.
637	Frey Pies	2014-06-10	I think that this episode was a much bigger achievement than Blackwater ever was. Sure, the Night's Watch might not have been that developed before this. However, here, they get more development than all 4 seasons combined. We see how inexperienced and frightened they really are, and it is conveyed in such a believable and touching way. Allister Thorne Edd, Grenn, Pyp and Sam became a lot, lot more awesome as characters. The scene where the giant charges at the men of the night's watch while they chant their vow is, personally, the most moving scene for me.Â 
Â 
The very fact that they were able to create one of the most epic yet touching Â and heartbreaking with characters who were previously not so fleshed out before makes it a grand achievement in my eyes.
638	RottenAppleFossoway	2014-06-10	I re-watched the episode  again last night and it was much better than I originally thought.  
It's pretty much a 10/10 in my book now.
 There were a few things that bugged me: no Stannis, particularly when the episode ended 8 minutes or so early, ghost only killing one person and not walking out with Jon at the end, watching Tormund fight. The way he's all herky-jerky with his movements bugs me, but his fight with Ser Alliser was great. Aside from that, the entire episode was excellent. 
 I would have liked one scene with Mance in the wildling camp just to get a pov from there though.

640	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-06-10	Everyone that is worried about there being too much to do in the finale needs to chill. The episode is supposed to be 66min. Also, I know a lot of you will just roll your eyes at this statement, but D&D have pretty much said the finale next week is the greatest episode they have ever produced, and knowing what's to come I at least believe them (thrum! ). I brought this up before the season started, but does everyone here still think LS will make an appearance? Or is it next season now?
641	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-10	What importance does a penis have where love is concerned?

They say that about an episode each season. It's a combination of self-promotion, cheap publicity, and their own overweening arrogance as "show creators."
Â 
I'd love for Lady Stoneheart to appear, but who even knows anymore? If some of the rumors about cut/merged characters from FfC and DwD are true, then anything's possible.
644	A Redeemed Hound	2014-06-10	The Show is better than the books at this moment.Â

I think if she appears it would be unfair to the character and the rest of the story lines to put her in this season. We have two big finales and some short strings to tie. She would be a second boom out of nowhere. We know Bran is headed for something awesome, we know Tyrions arc is going to go somewhere big but not where ( as TV watchers) but putting LS on top of it - well if they did it with minimal explanation that could work -like a wtf scene - but Fairley is busy blowing up London.

Well, the first year I loved it, the second year I was disappointed, the third year I was angry and this year I'm just trying to have fun.
But eight years.......I don't think so. Next year I think will be the tipping point for me and possibly others. I know from watching anime
people tend to drift away during long filler arcs (like Naruto) and I think there will be a lot of filler next year unless Martin kicks it into
high gear. What's left? Stannis at the Wall, Dany in Meereen (always good times), Tyrion's travels, Arya at Faceless Man Hogwarts,
Cersei's machinations against Margaery, Robert Strong, Dorne and Martells, Theon and Ramsay's Excellent Adventures at Winterfell
........It seems like a lot of material. But they'd have to use all of it and their track record is to throw away scads of the books with both
hands. Unless LS shows up, Brienne is pretty much done. Balon's still alive so we haven't introduced Euron or Victarion Greyjoy and
the overly precise number of the ships Dario mentions to Dany puts that whole plot line in question. Fake Arya? We've alreadyÂ 
headed to Winterfell without her. Riverrun and Edmure seem to have been forgotten so I don't know if Jaime will go on his travels.
And will they want to use everything they have next season without some firm commitment from Martin that the next book is ready
to publish in the near future? And since Martin's editor seemed to call him out in the media the other day to get busy and protect
his legacy (from HBO was the implication) that doesn't seem likely. So, we'll just have to see.Â  Â

I don't mind the deaths of characters that they are still alive in the book and even though the death of Ingrid was much more romantic I still can live with it, but Stannis not coming and saving the day was a big error because even if he comes in the next episode, everyone will have their minds in the coming events and not Stannis.

Did you mean Ygritte?Â  
And quite honestly, the non-book-readers won't know about Stannis showing up.Â  All they saw was Jon deciding to go on a dangerous mission (without Ghost, apparently!), and the trailer for next week having Mance state that he will see to it that every Night's Watchmen is dead (can't remember the exact quote).Â  The book-readers know what is coming, but not all who watch the show have read the books, to be fair.
655	TheImpThatRides	2014-06-10	Gave it an 8.  The past couple of weeks the dialogue just hasn't seemed that great and I thought it detracted from the first twenty minutes or so.  Didn't like Pyp and Grenn dying although I wouldn't knock off serious points for that (well maybe half a point for Grenn). 
I did like the 360 degree continuous shot of the battle in the courtyard, thought that was fantastic.  And I may be alone in this but I kinda liked what they did with Thorne, to me it did something the books never really did (that I can recall) by validating why Mormont had him as the NW drill sergeant. 
And I know, I know where the CGI budget went for this episode but if you're gonna let Ghost out, you gotta let him out a bit more than that.
656	Zeppelin	2014-06-10	I'm surprised to see that 248 people gave this episode a score of 10. Meaning they thought every aspect of ep9 was perfect in every way.
Â 
Also, about half of the people dropped their 10 vote to a 9, because Stannis didn't arrive in this episode .... which also means they thought everything this episode actually contained, was perfect.
Â 
So roughly 320 voters thought episode 9 was perfect in every single way.
Â 
Really?!! 320 people thought the contents of this episode was perfection
657	Mark Antony	2014-06-10	I wouldn't say it was perfect. I was entertained enough to give it a 9

659	7th-key	2014-06-10	Vote: 5 to 6. Impression: who cares?
Again again and again, boring irrelevant fillers instead of a proper build up, that in this case has been missed all season. Maybe they should have let Mance (who?) deal with the mutineers and Bran, while the NW organized their defence (+ Noye!).
Â 

This episode was about the bravery of a few NW brothers holding the wall through impossible odds.

But that takes strategies and tactics. Instead, we got disorganization and Hollywood clichA©s.
You have the wall. - No, you have the wall. - And now, you. - But I want to fight below and show off. - I want, too! - And I'm going to hold the gate with no advantageous weaponry.
Another cliche:
Book!Ygritte dies like a warrior. In the show, no matter how tough and skilled she is, she dies as Jon's lover, due to a moment of emotional hesitation, killed by a boy so that he becomes a man.
Sam and Gilly: gah. He is a hero all of a sudden and she's all needy.
Â 

The whole battle for the Wall felt empty. 1 mammoth and two giants just looked comical. Some CGI could have went far. Dany gets thousands of Unsullied and tons of catapults yet Mance gets a few climbers and some chains.

I liked the design of the Giants and the Mammoths. As you said, they should have placed a lot more people around them.
Favorite parts of the ep: Thorne and Tortmund - they both had great presence in their scenes.

Best part will be when people start complaining that the book "adaptation" stray to far from the series
673	grufolo	2014-06-11	I give a 4.
The episode was well below the previous, beautiful one.
Slamming the two battles at the wall into one single event was probably a forced choice but still felt really clumsy. The attack of the Thenns and Tormund from the inside was turned into some kind of superhero battle between a few huberheroes and a crowd of dying extras, what a pity. As in the worst action movies, characters can only killed by characters. Extras can't kill charatcters, it seems.
Â 
The character of Alliser Thorne was glorified as a fierce warrior when he'd been mostly a ranting cunt so far, and Janos Slynt (a fighter) was ridiculed beyond recognition.
Â 
The speed of crossbow reloading is shortened beyond possibility.
Â 
All in all, they could have excluded the battle OUTside the wall, which was totally uncool (only CGI, that is) and focused on the only one that mattered, the one on the inside, making it more worthy. One thing that can't be explained is, if Mance thought that more crows were present in clastle black, how could he think to overcome them by such a small force as the one he sent?
Â 
And the last, totally ridicule scene, the Thenns+Tormund having a campfire (not spotted, clearly) a few hundred yards from the gate of the castle.... pfffffffffff
674	JagLover	2014-06-11	What is very entertaining about all the people marking it down because there was no Stannis is that there was no Stannis in the books either!
Â 
In the books the Nightswatch fight the wildlingsÂ off, then Jon is sent to kill Mance and then, and only then, Â Stannis arrives.
Â 
Aside from combining this with an earlier attack from the south and changing some characters around (due to characters not created on the show) this was fairly faithful to the books.

Thorne IS a formidable fighter in the books and show, he's a seasoned NW man, chosen to train the troops (though he may fail at that) and was a seasoned knight before that. There's no evidence that Slynt is a fighter at all

Agreed. Â I didn't see the characterizations of either as wrong...actually, I'm glad we see a different side of Thorne than we do in the book, because he always felt too one-note for my liking. Â Giving him some shades of grey doesn't change his character, it just makes him more real, imo.

Well Thorne was a knight, i know the ser title doesnt need much but he did fight and survive Tywin Lannisters sack of kings landing so he must be able to hold his own. As for Slynt, firstly he was a cheat and a liar who murdered and bribed his way to command. Secondly where was he when stannis lay seige? His absence was notable!

685	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-11	So after a rewatch.... and I will try to do it based on the show with minimal book bias.
Â 
Yes, it was a fantastic 49 minutes of television (or 50 min 30 seconds if the HBO static and end credits are included)
Great cinematics and camera work.
I totally bought the giant and mammoth sequences.
Thorne was just as he should be
Sam/Gilly and Sam/Aemon sequences annoyed me on first watch but I do like them second time around
Greatest moment - Grenn holding the gate. One of the best in the entire show IMO.
Â 
I'd really love to give it a 10 but there are just a few issues.Â 
Â 
Gilly saw the Wildlings encamped 200 m from Castle Black but didn't tell any one?
Jon has forgotten why the clans united behind Mance?
Slynt was a little too cartoony coward
The sequence immediately prior to Jon holding Ygritte was to cliche for my tastes.
Book reader me loved the depiction of Ygritte's death, but trying to judge the show by itself, Show watcher me just didn't care.
Why do I even care about this battle anyway (as a show watcher)?Â 
Not enough Ghost.Â 
Â 
The book reader in me had expected the episode to run through to show all the events up to the arrival of you-know-who. This really coloured how I viewed it the first time around and why I had to (for the first time) sit down for a rewatch before I passed a score. The episode as presented was visually fantastic but the niggles took me out of the moment too often.
Â 
So a 9 feels appropriate....
Â 
Except....
Â 
It was a 50 minute episode in a series that has now run for 8 hrs and 3 minutes (9 episodes) - and they just have not spent enough resources on making people care a single iota about the Wall. I have no doubt I'll be going back to review my scores on previous episodes too and fully expect to downgrade scores - where I had initially thought I might upgrade when I carried out that process.
Â 
8/10 - and I am still torn on that.
686	Rashtibram	2014-06-11	I think the major problem people are dancing around here in the more negative reviews is perfectly underlined by what the book reader critic for the AVÂ Club had to say about the episode. I found it absolutely spectacular from a production standpoint, and I'm a sucker for big battles (so I really enjoyed it), but I can completely see where he's coming from. I think he really captures the issue that held it back from fully matching the quality of 'Blackwater,' and it's even more frustrating when you realize this problem could have been entirely avoided by stretching the episode out a little longer and including the Mance parlay and the Stannis charge. It was still the best episode of the season from my perspective, but it could have been the best episode ever, and that qualifies as a disappointment in my book.
Â 
Â 
Â 
This is aÂ big momentÂ in Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arc. He loses Ygritte, and he essentially becomes the only person who can take command of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch in a moment when all hope seems lost. But not only does the show give this moment far too little weight; it also finds itself stretching the story out past this episode, so that this hour depicts only the first night of the Battle of Castle Black. Without spoiling how the other nights go or how the battle resolves itself, I can say that this is so ridiculously unimportant to not just the overall arc of this particular storyline but alsoÂ the arc of the full battle itselfÂ that blowing it up to â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwaterâ<U+0080><U+009D> proportions is just kind of pointless. The episode ends on a cliffhanger that only makes things seem more like we saw an episode entirely designed to show off how impressive the seriesâ<U+0080><U+0099> budget is.

True...why do the dirty work yourself when you have peons to do it for you?
Â 
I can totally imagine him in Office Space now XD


Lol, now imagining Tyrion's dinner with Janos is book/season 2:
Â 
Â 
Â 
Tyrion (reading a royal proclomation): Very nice -- Lord Janos, is it now?
Slynt (beaming): Why yes it is. Â A fair day's wage for a fair day's work.
Â 
Tyrion: So, when the Queen needs somebody murdered, she has you do it? Â Why wouldn't she just have her own men do it?
Slynt: Well, you see, her men are really her father's men -- your father's men, and the Gold Cloaks, well, we serve the King, and she is his regent. Â And Lannister guards -- well, they're not from here. Â If you want somebody murdered in King's Landing, you need somebody who knows King's Landing, and who knows King's Landing better than the Gold Cloaks sworn to protect it?
Â 
Tyrion: OK, so when you get a "kill" order, you actually go out and take care of the matter for the Queen?
Slynt: Â Yes, of course. Â I mean, no, not exactly -- depending on the circumstances, I'll have Allar Deem, or one of my other trusted men, actually go out and take care of the job.
Tyrion: So, why does Cersei need *you*, then? Â Couldn't she just speak to the brave Allar Deem himself?
Slynt: Not exactly. Â See, Deem, him and most of my men are what you'd call "smallfolk", and royalty can't really be seen consorting with them.
Tyrion: Â So the queen actually summons you personally and gives you the orders?
Slynt: Â Yes...well, no, not exactly. Â I am a Lord now, but she's still used to dealing with Littlefinger -- I mean, Lord Baelish, so she usually gives him the orders, and he gives them to me. Â But sometimes, I'm right outside the room they're in while she's giving him my orders.
Â 
[Slynt reaches for a bottle of wine, but Tyrion grabs it first, tilts back his head, and drains it.]
[Tyrion blots the wine from his lips with Slynt's proclomation.]
Â 
Tyrion: So, what exactly would you say, you do here?
Slynt (flushed): Â Look, Imp, I already told you...I deal with the killers so that the Queen doesn't have to. Â I have people skills. Â I am good at dealing with people. Â I betrayed Ned Stark for you and made sure he died just like Lord Baelish told me the King wanted!
688	chzzy_poop	2014-06-11	Disclaimer: I judge the episodes on their own merits. Â I put no expectations on them based of what I've read.
Â 
9/10
- Choreography was phenomenal. Â Ser Alliser vs Tormund, Jon vs. Styr, and even the extra's fights were well down. Â Sure, it wasn't The Raid quality 10/10, but it's probably the best I've seen on TV. Â 
- Cinematography. Â Tell me that one minute sweeping crane take wasn't impressive. Â I think it's the single most impressive shot in GoT. Â I think Neil Marshall did leagues better establishing the scale of this battle. Â I felt that was Black Waters' biggest problem.
- CGI was really good. Â The scythe scene was excellent.Â 
- The editing was great as well. Â I really like the decision to have the fighting continuous for a 20 minute period. Â Also, the editing was less chopping than in the Black Water episode.
- Ygritte's death scene was a little too corny for my liking.
Â 
Overall, this is very much a Neil Marshall production. Â This episode very much reminded me of Dog Soldiers (the buildup to battle, a confrontation that you don't see, the bastards of the group becoming likable). Â I'll probably get stoned for this, but Black Water, to me, is a 6/10. Â This episode was a marked improvement for Mr. Marshall.Â

I agree with most of your points here.Â 
I gave Blackwater an 8, and realistically I was going to give this a 9 until I realised that I had cheered for Alliser 3 separate times!Â  3 times, ffs!Â  So it got an extra full point from me.Â  I'm still shaking my head over that ...
Neil Marshall only had a few days (a week or so) to prepare for Blackwater, whereas he had several weeks/months to prepare for this one.
And the first time I watched, yep, corny Ygritte death.Â  Second watch?Â  I teared up.Â  :stillsnifflling:
Â 
Oh! Welcome to the board!Â  Â

I was hit much more with the deaths on subsequent viewings...I think I was so caught up in the action of what was going on that they didn't have time to sink in for me the first time. Â But then I watched it again, and I definitely teared up at Pyp, Grenn and Ygritte's deaths.

693	DanyStark	2014-06-11	I loved the giants and mammoths...they looked amazing! Ghost kicked ass! The whole scope was epic. I really enjoyed that one long shot of the whole battle-impressive. Jon Snow finally coming into his own was satisfying. Â Very sad about Pyp. Would have loved to see Stannis but there hasn't really been much set up in the show for it. The last we've seen him on the show wasn't he in Braavos with Davos asking for money?Â 
I am very curious how they are going to handle Mance since the show is obviously going in a very different direction. Will we get Val and how would work even? So, jumping ahead but I am looking forward to the episode where Stannis offers Jon to be a Stark and marry Val..if it will even happen?!
694	chzzy_poop	2014-06-11	I did think it was oddly appropriate that Pyp died from a vicious neck wound. Â Anybody that's seen Josef Altin in Eastern Promises knows what I'm talking about. Â

699	The Killer Snark	2014-06-11	You're both right of course, come to think of it. A mode is the highest number in a statistical range of values. A median is the middle number between the three highest values in a statistical series. 8 would be an average. The median is 9. Very pedantic, however, people, but technically you are right.

701	The Great Unwashed	2014-06-11	I gave it a 7.Â  I originally would have rated it a 5, but I've done two rewatches since Sunday night and I have to say the episode was better the second and third time around than I thought it was in my original estimation.Â  However, I'm still baffled by their choice to have Jon voluntarily go out beyond the Wall to try and assassinate Mance Rayder.Â  In a sane world, Jon should know that the wildlings would kill him before he got within 100 yards of Mance.Â  At least in the books it made sense...he was being forced out beyond the Wall and given that he was going out to parley with the wildlings...at least they might want to hear what he had to say.Â  But with this there isn't even that much.
Â

Yeah, it was an OK entertaining episode but as far as at being an epic episode that was equal to the Blackwater it was a bit of a disappointment and I think the episode poll accurately reflects that.

I think --and I could be wrong-- that they added the "Jon ranges to Craster's scene" to cover the Slynt/Thorne trying to get Jon killed thing.... If I recall, in the books Slynt & Thorne were at Eastwatch bts for the battle.... The change might be to help sell Jon's viability to be voted LC to a TV audience, who don't get all of the nuance we all got from the books,,,,
Â 
and I agree.... episodes are too short.... my wife yells at the TV every week at 9:52

Â 
I thought the same thing as you about CK- that was Thorne and Slynt's plan to get him killed off in the show. Â I do like that they gave the suicide parley mission decision to Jon, though...it really reflected a lot about what he was going through emotionally after all that he had just been through in a way that being sent out would not have.
Â 
Of course, we might just be spoiled from the fact that there are no commercials XD

707	LordStoneheart	2014-06-12	I think I've figured out why this episode just doesn't live up to a usual GoT episode for me. It's a book reader thing and that's something I'll never turn off. I really do like the Wall story line regardless of if Jon is a Mary Sue/ClichA© Hero/Special Snowflake or any other meaningless trope name. I've always enjoyed Jon's chapters, and Samwell. I like the Night's Watch and most of the characters up there... but the show has just not given this story line any of the greatness it has from the books. We only get a few central characters in the show whereas in the books we get a lot more. The show has always (IMO) struggled with making the Wall an interesting storyline. the best was probably Jon getting aquainted there. The worst was probably season two, particularly the latter half of Jon's story, the ending, and the terrible follow-up in S3 they did (budget reasons? no excuse. don't set up big epic battle if you can't follow through with even one visual like Tyrion S1). Nothing in this episode was engaging for me. I know the outcome and though I didn't expect Grenn to die, I knew for certain that Sam and Jon would survive, it's just a matter of how. The characters were not engaging and the storyline is not engaging.... The episode is executed remarkably well, and I'll even give it a guilty pleasure point for the giant metal scythe... but I don't think I'd give it anything higher than a 6 now.

Well considering how D&D didn't develop/flesh out the characters/storylines at the Wall, Jon (or rather Kit) and gang did a pretty awesome job this episode. Kudos to them for that.
709	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-06-12	i would have given it a 10 if stannis had arrived. they really could have fit that in. i think they just wanted to have a cliffhanger for jon too. this episode could have just been long and next week shorterÂ  (or regular length). i would still give it a 9
710	Mother of Flagons	2014-06-12	I give it a 10/10. Even as a book reader my heart was beating so fast i was on the edge on my seat. The only thing i would have changed is made the episode longer and have Stannis save the day in this one, not the next. But overall it was amazing, for those giving a low score ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?? i guess not...Â  


This. Although as a reader I think they made the right decision holding off on Stannis. Let Jon have his moment. I gave it a 10/10 based on the fact that I will rewatch and enjoy this episode for years to come, as I do Blackwater & Baelor. Really struggling to understand the 0s. Best part was Jon looking down on the fire from the Wall. Chills

Â 
I think you've touched on why I've felt so disatisfied with the Wall storyline on the show, even though that is one of my favorite storylines in the books.Â  I think there is a nearly unanimous consensus that the best thing about GoT and ASOIAF is the intrigue, the backstabbing and the struggle for power.Â  And you see that in spades in the King's Landing scenes...nearly all of them are dealing with that.Â  The same is going on to a lesser extent with Dany's storyline in the show...but the Wall scenes have been nearly bereft of intrigue, even though in the books there is a lot of intrigue going on at the Wall.Â  But the show has cut nearly all of that...Jon's return, the vacuum of power left with Mormont's death, Thorne and Slynt plotting against Jon, etc., in favor of sending Jon out beyond the Wall again to kill a bunch of deserters.Â  They're more focused on the action at the Wall, when, aside from the wildling attack, that's the least important aspect of the Wall storyline.Â  Hopefully that will change in season 5 as there will be even more opportunity for intrigue.

Â 
Well I don't think there really was much Wall intrigue in the book prior to the battle, and the sudden Janos/Thorne plot at the end was really more of an annoyance to the reader rooting for poor Jon, and I don't know how that would play out visually. Probably be a universal facepalm from the viewers, like "Really? there's an army on their doorstep and everyones gonna die but these two soulless antagonists are more concerned about Jon fucking Snow???" And this was BEFORE he really became a potential candidate for LC. Having it happen more subtly a few episodes prior to the attack does seem a bit more realistic. The real intrigue begins once Stannis settles in.

713	boojam	2014-06-12	Moved from a wrong thread.Watching the episode again, I noticed this, to my eye and ear , if one took each sequence as it appeared on the block flow chart , all would be , individually gems.Neil Marshall put them on 'film' (isn't pixels these days?) that way, so I gave the show a 10 because Marshall did an ace job of scene composition.However, and I don't know what happened, the sum of the parts are not as good as the parts.This is all technical , to me, something seems disjoint , to my eye, in the editing.Seems Marshall said the week before the showing that the VFX had only been completed ... that week!I just seemed to be getting pinged by 'under-the-surface' disjunctions , like the editors ran out of time to smooth things.The long tracking shot of the main courtyard of CB was fine, but then seemed elaborated again , in a way, as the fight progresses.The injection of the personal interactions , much needed in a chaotic dramatic visual narrative , like this, did not seem, to me, to well transitioned or elaborated ... I kept getting the feel of 'hasty pasty' ... I have seen lots worse, just seemed more time was needed in the end-to-end composition.

714	AGS Martell	2014-06-12	9 for me. The battle was really well managed, we got giants, mammoths, and enough blood; but the only reason it's not getting a 10 is because of what they've done to Gilly's character. How could she arrive unnoticed to Castle Black?
That's weird but as for the rest, no complaints.
715	Unscythed	2014-06-13	I'm a book-reader and a show-watcher. For me, one does not detract from the other.Â 
Â 
I gave the episode a 9Â because I feltÂ it was too short. I dislikedÂ  the rewrite of Ygritte's death (not that I'm opposed to rewriting things for show purposes). It was corny and if they had stuck moreÂ to the books and added a couple more minutes, it would have made it all the better.
Â 
I'm glad they left Stannis out of this episode, I can't stand him, should have named myself Traitor of Stannis.

The scythe, however,Â was brilliant even if pointless.
716	WexPyke	2014-06-13	I just hope the writing on the show improves next season.
717	solidviper	2014-06-13	I really liked this episode. I gave it an 8. It surprised me because I expected an entire episode about The Wall to be boring. This was anything but. The giants were really cool and the ice anchor thingy was cool. The deaths were sad.
Â 
Only thing I didn't like was Ghost not going with Jon at the end.Â
718	Steve Stark	2014-06-13	Only thing I didn't like was Ghost not going with Jon at the end.Â 


Â 
I noticed that too. I think he'll be there in the next episode (I hope). I think it must have been a budget issue since they spent a fortune creating ep 9. I was waiting for Ghost to pad up behind Jon as he left out the gate and that never happened. Who walks out beyond the wall alone at a time like this? I would have even been happy with a, "Ghost, with me."

He was going to parlay with Mance and try to kill him. If he took Ghost he is more likely to be killed on sight I suppose as he is more threatening
720	Chiki	2014-06-13	No nude scenes. 1/10
721	Yurii Hightower	2014-06-13	I give it a 7. Â There was some good action, but I'm not a big action fan. Â As for good conversations and good acting, very little. Â Even the nice scene with Maester Aemon didn't really work for me, because they were starting to get deep enough into what I already knew was a 50-minute episode that I was distracted by wondering how they'd get everything in. Â Turns out they couldn't.
Â 
There were definitely some high points. Â The fire, the scyth, the giants. Â Alliser humanizing himself a bit and stepping up in the clutch. Â The night's watch chant in the tunnel. Â Sam laying a big smacker on Gilly. Â Harrington is good at sword-fighting. Â They managed to make it relatively clear that the Wall was being defended from both sides, not so easy in a night battle.
Â 
But there were problems, too. Â Hell yeah, it was anti-climactic. Â Devote an episode to something, you want to make it a story to itself and I think viewers rightfully expected to get some resolution to the battle. Â And didn't, not at all. Â Nobody ever told Jon Snow the Wall was his, and while I'm usually the kind of sucker you throw a cheesy death scene at, Ygritte's was a little too schmaltzy/predictable. Â The unstoppable giant arrows that just stopped. Â Obvious technical issues with direwolf-human combat that means the 2 such "battles" we've scene this year both consisted of a direwolf blur steamrolling some guy from the side and wham bam, thank you ma'am, that's the entirety of what you call a human-direwolf fight. Â And I'd think with 104 guys to defend, somebody in charge would at least be estimating at some point how many had already bitten it and how many were left - I mean obviously, a big chunk of 104 will fight no more just from what we saw on TV. Â Also, as has been pointed out in this thread with pictorial evidence, Mance Rayder's gigungous wildling army was totally underwhelming. Â It seriously looked like there were more people attacking with Tormund and Ygritte from the south.
Â 
It was pretty good, but a cut below most of what we've seen during this outstanding season.


Â 
This!Â 
Â 
I still remember watching Blackwater and man, I went insane! A battle is not made of simply smashing heads and screaming. When this episode was over I thought 'ok, what just happened?'. Game of Thrones has the power to change everything in a scene of like 5 minutes. But then we have a full episode where nothing really happens, with characters' motivation poorly built along the season and a frustrating end.Â 
Â 
Shout out to Marshall, thought. It was visually perfect and I particularly liked the panning-scene.
722	Unscythed	2014-06-13	9 for me. The battle was really well managed, we got giants, mammoths, and enough blood; but the only reason it's not getting a 10 is because of what they've done to Gilly's character. How could she arrive unnoticed to Castle Black?
That's weird but as for the rest, no complaints.


I'm not sure how "realistically" she could go unnoticed, but they did address it when Ygritte & Co. were talking ish around the fire and sharpening arrows,Â Gilly walks by on the ridge and scurries along obviously hoping not to get noticed herself.

Books 4 and 5 are dull and boring if you are a simpleton.

Or a violence obsessed teenage boy, which is what this dude sounds like.
724	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-14	Books 4 and 5 were dull and boring because they were dull and boring, minus a few chapters. You're gonna judge a person entirely because they didn't like a book? How old are you? Haha.

Dull and boring? It focused too much on characters nobody really cares much about, yes, but this complaint sounds a whole lot like "WAAAAHHHH WHEN'S THE BATTLE GOING TO HAPPEN!" And that's just dumb.
726	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-14	More like "when is anything going to happen to propel the story forward significantly?" And right when those few things do happen the book ends. More happened in the first half of Storm than Feast/Dance combined. They're not bad books, but they do drag.

Yeah, they drag; but great dialogues and character moments are just as interesting (for me) as game-changing events. AFFC is one of my favorites.
728	Dope in Highgarden	2014-06-14	I gave it a 9 - John's story isn't my favorite but it was nice to see some awesome battle scenes,
and Ygritte was a beast with that bow.
729	eliamo	2014-06-14	9. Pretty great, but odd ending (even if it was faithful to the book)
730	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-14	It's the penultimate episode. I don't know why people were expecting the ending scene to be super climactic and final.

731	eliamo	2014-06-14	It's the penultimate episode. I don't know why people were expecting the ending scene to be super climactic and final.


Because the whole episode was basically a self-contained story. A self-contained story without a resolution is not satisfying.Â
732	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-14	It isn't a self contained story at all.
733	Count Balerion	2014-06-14	Episode 9: actually pretty good on the whole, although it's hard for me to judge action-y stuff.Â  The
mammoths and giants were cool.Â  The dialogue was decent, with a bit too much whispering.Â  I like the way
they have AT show some leadership and even take a sort of a stab at being statesmanlike.Â  On the debit
side, Jon's leadership was downplayed at a time when he should be coming into his own (part from the
end), and I found the J-Y scene rather rushed.Â  Showing Y's conflicted feelings worked well, though.Â  I
guess I'll give it a 9; it helps that they stayed focused instead of hopping about.Â
734	rmholt	2014-06-14	I guess I didn't like it because the strategy was so stupid ie unrealistic. There should never have been sword fighting out in the open. BW and Book Wall made sense. This was just a bunch of nonsense.
735	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-06-14	I don't understand how people can criticize this episode (and the show in general) for not closely adhering to the books, then complain that Stannis' arrival was the next day, which in fact, does adhere to the books. Â The books clearly set Jon & co. defending the Wall and Stannis' arrival as two separate moments, and the show follows that. Â 
Â 
I thought the decision to have a simultaneous north/south attack on the Wall/Castle Black was brilliant.
Â 
The bouncing back and forth between the castle and the Wall was great, kept the tension moving.
Â 
My giving the episode a 10 had nothing to to with "Awesome violence, bro!" and everything to do with the nonstop tension, excellent editing, writing, and acting from start to finish. Â (Okay, the violence was cool, too!) Â
736	High-born Plumber	2014-06-14	I went with 9, as high as I've rated.  
Not much I can say that hasn't been said...
Off toppic here, but as an (primarily)unsullied it bothers me we haven't had anything about Walder Frey since all his scenes in s03e10 ...
I look forward to the finale.
737	St. Daga	2014-06-15	Loved the episode! The real enemy has always been north of the Wall.(And I don't mean the wildlings)
10 out of 10. Would have given it like 15 out of 10 if they had not killed of Pip AND Grenn! One of them dead is enough of an emotional blow!
738	ebevan91	2014-06-15	I finally watched the episode last night as I was kinda put off by the fact that the rest of the battle was pushed to episode 10.Â 
Â 
Still a very good episode. I wish I hadn't been spoiled on Pyp/Grenn's deaths though. Would've made it even better. It's like they decided to get rid of some of Jon's group since Stannis would be showing up very soon.

740	boojam	2014-06-15	Ratings from elsewhere, just FYI.IMDb7735 weighted average vote of 9.5 / 10What's odd here is this is about ~ 5000 less voters less than episode 8, thought that was odd till went back and looked at earlier episodes, some range from over 10,000 to ~6000... a little at loss to square this with the ~ 8 million + totals for fist night showings. O well. I do think the NBA finals put a hit on the show. The TONYS award show must have had soke influence too.Still total USA first showing and second are holding at ~ 8 million, HBO may finish with a record breaking season.(The NBA seems to have snookered HBO the MEMORIAL DAY skip thing, but I see HBO continuing this formula.)Rotten Tomatoes, taken with a grain of salt gave The Watchers on the Wall a 93 , only 33 reviewers this time, not clear why the aggregate of critics ranges from ~ 40 to ~30+ when seems all those reviewers no included , who were included before, did write reviews... a puzzle.Since there were 3 (0 scored reviews out the 33) I read those. Actually RT should rate the reviews in fractions of 1, since all three of the 'rotten reviews' mostly were positive.For the 'negative' reviews it seemed to come down to a comparison of Watchers with Blackwater... since they are both battles. Points were subtracted for there not being an 'end'. Blackwater had a beginning, middle and end...(I have got say this episode surprised me too ... since they saved the Battle for the Wall's ending for today... even with more time... things are going to get jammed.)Positive reviewers , which was most of the critics, like that the episode had character driven events and was not all sword.HBO and D&D must have some Iron Clad circle they draw around an episode's ~60 min. , and I still don't see the rational for it.)I did not notice anyone mentioning , what to my eye, looked like last min. editing problems , a technicality but bothered me.By the by I notice that RT carries an overall non-critic users rating for the season, but not per episode.My usual note that Myles McNutt's lengthy reviews at Cultural Learnings is always an aesthetic profit because of the extensive analysis behind the critical assessment.

741	gmavridis	2014-06-18	It is 9 for me because I think a finale with Stannis arrival would have got a 10
742	Ser Blake	2014-06-19	After a couple of rewatches this is honestly one of the greatest episodes in the entire series.Â  It is an amazing tribute to the Night's Watch and is just flat out fun to watch.Â  It honeslty felt more like a movie than a TV show.Â  What's sad is that the rating for the episode is being weighed down by the absence of Stannis.Â  If he were in this episode then I truly feel like it would be among the top 5 highest rated episodes of the entire series on these threads.Â  Although it felt weird the first time watching it, saving Stannis for the finale was the right decision.Â  This episode is about the Night's Watch not Stannis the Mannis. Â
743	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-06-21	Gave it a straight 8. It was a good episode overall save for some unnecessary killing off of characters.
744	Hodor King of Westeros	2014-07-17	Awful episode. Least faithful to books

Overall, even after reading the books I am very impressed with a Game of Thrones (The Mountain and the Viper was perfect), but this single episode was poor and well beneath the standards set for the rest of the show.

757	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	Grenn leading the recitation of the Nights Watchman vows was powerful. And I loved it when they played the same music they played at the end of Season 2 (I think that was the season) when the White Walkers were marching towards the Fist of the First Men.
758	Thrones123	2014-06-09	So what is Jon's big plan going to be? Talk to mance somehow or try and kill him? He gave up his sword so unless he had a dagger or something he is useless there, and unless they just didn't show it, ghost wasn't going with him, so thought he could've done something better than that.
As far as defending the wall with future attacks, why couldn't they just blow out the tunnel now? That way with no wildling force across the wall, they could defend it on top where they have a clear advantage, also could expect reinforcement s from someone now that mance is a legit threat.
Do you think Thorne died? Last we saw he was getting dragged away after being cut by tormund.
Jon was out dueled again by the thenn and was lucky to come away alive, needs to step up his fighting skills

Jon could pretend he's given up on the Night's Watch and is surrendering to the wildings. Mance might have sympathy for him because he was a man of the NW and he has them beat 1000 to 1 anyway. Then,Â  when his guard's down, he can kill him.

The soundtrack for the show is really powerful. I loved the three blasts theme, i think thats what it was called, that played when the white walker army of wights approach the fist. It really builds the mood for whats going on.
763	ma_liky	2014-06-10	I promised myself that I wouldnt come here for this season because I wanted to stay out of spoilers. Last season I learnd about Red Wedding here and it spoild the season for me. And this season started and continued to be great, I wanted to be clear of spoilers. But this episode naild me to the sofa. I had to see what do you all think about it and about the season. But I see that most like me had abandond this no spoiler thread because you have to come across some spoilers and that messes up everything. But today I had to come and say what I need because It left me with a jaw down.
Throughout this week I thouth that the ninth episode will be the death of some big character (like every other ninth epiosode) and I thought it will be of Tyrion, and I hoped he will somehow manage to escape the death sentance. But when the episode started I quickly understud that it is going to be only the Wall in this episode. So it hit me: Jon will die. NOOOOOOO!!!! So throughout the episode I sweared, I begged, I prayed NOT JON PLEASE. Ygritt was all he is mine to kill and when the fighting started she was looking for him with every arrow. And the wildings from bouth sides of the wall. With Mammoths and Giants. Awsome!!!! With Giants throwing big arrows. Awsome!!! How to beat that. But when Jon came down the wall like a leader, I knew she would find him. Jon was awsome in this episode becoming the leader, giving orders. I thought Ygritt will kill Styr and save Jon to kill him for her self. But when Jon killed him it was just the matter of time when hi comesÂ  face to face with Ygritt. And than he turned around... i was naild to my sofa. Screaming in my head NOOOOO, DONT KILL HIM. Not another Stark dying in the ninth episode. I couldn take that again. He looked at her like like he was glad she will be the end of him. He smiled. My eyes filled with tear. And then the arrow hits her. I droped. The tear came down. I was sad. I am glad Jon lived through ninth episode. But Ygritt you hesitate girl. You can not kill the man you love. Awsome scene.
This episode was great from bigining to the end. It wasnt big characters death but some small characters I will miss a lot. And the fighting was graet.
Even if most think that Wall is insignificant to the hole story, I think it is very important.
The winter is coming!

Great that we're one person more in this thread.  And I have to say, so far I have not seen any spoilers in these threads in season 4.
Â 


But when Jon came down the wall like a leader, I knew she would find him. Jon was awsome in this episode becoming the leader, giving orders. I thought Ygritt will kill Styr and save Jon to kill him for her self. But when Jon killed him it was just the matter of time when hi comesÂ  face to face with Ygritt.

I also thought that she would save him. When they met I also thought for a moment that she would indeed kill him. Although, I had hoped there would be a happy end for the two of them. But, once again, no such thing in this show. I really liked the Ygritt-character and their story. Oh well.
Â 


Even if most think that Wall is insignificant to the hole story, I think it is very important.
The winter is coming!


I doubt that most think that. The wall has, so far, been less exciting than other stories, I agree. But it's obvious that this is where the fate of Westeros will be decided. King's Landing, Iron Islands, The Vale, Winterfell - that's thrilling but basically just bloody feuds. In contrast, the events up north are going to be historic once the white walkers arrive in masses. (Such as Danaeris with her dragons will bring a historic component into the story on another end.) But I expect it will take a while until the south acknowledges this danger, I doubt there will be coming any considerable help yet.
Â 
I'm very very curious about the season finale. I disliked Tyrion at the very beginning, but he has grown on to me a lot, I hope he can escape or some other way be saved. I think his character is one of the most round one, him being gone would seem quite a loss to the show.

Me too. I like Tyrion, he is one of my favourite. I think he will escape somehow. I think Varys and Jamie will help him, well they should. Do you think we will get some big character death at the finale or is it just Joffrey for this season? I dont know who might it be. Maybe Jamie while trying to save Tyrion or Cerasi (hope), if there is going to be, probably it will be Tyrion but something tells me not. I dont know. Cant wait for finale.
Â 
What do you think of Littlefinger? I dont like him at all. I was so stund (still am) that he was the one who poisoned Jon Arryn. Well he told Lysa to do it. That was shocking to me  . I had to watch all first season again because I have hadÂ  missed something. Everything happend because of it. Why did he do that? What is his motive? It buffels me. But while rewatching the first season I came across something (maybe it is just me), but I think he has something against Tyrion. He set him up for Joffreys murder and in the season one he was the one who told Catelyn that the dagger (wich was used in the atack on Bran) is Tyrions, we never found out if this is true or not. But I dont believe a word Littelfinger is saying. So is it possible that everything is set up by him? The war between the Starks and the Lannisters. I am intrigued.
Well one more and than a long year to wait.

I think that's how I will spend part of this year too: re-watch the 4 seasons. We should then open a non spoiler thread to discuss our new connections. My problem is that in a book I could flip back and forth pages where somebody is from who he is related to, check maps. Whereas on TV I forget things and think by this I miss a lot too, probably a lot more connections could be made with more attention to detail.Â Â 
Â

I almost don't dare to predict, I'm usually wrong about it.  One possibility I could imagine is that because both fighters died it's a tie and he has not to be sentenced to death. But I think it's unlikely, Tywin would have known i there was such a regulation. I don't think taht the finale needs a big character death, last season the Red Wedding was episode 9 too, not 10. But of course Tyrion's death would open new ways for the Sansa story. Right now I don't think she even could marry either her cousin or Baelish because she is already married. I don't think killing Cersei would add to the story - it would offer more possibilities if she lives and has to marry this Tyrell guy. Jamie dying while saving Tyrion on the other hand would be interesting.

I had to watch all first season again because I have hadÂ  missed something. Everything happend because of it. Why did he do that? What is his motive? It buffels me. But while rewatching the first season I came across something (maybe it is just me), but I think he has something against Tyrion. He set him up for Joffreys murder and in the season one he was the one who told Catelyn that the dagger (wich was used in the atack on Bran) is Tyrions, we never found out if this is true or not. But I dont believe a word Littelfinger is saying. So is it possible that everything is set up by him? The war between the Starks and the Lannisters. I am intrigued.


You are right about the dagger, somebody pointed this out elsewhere too. I don't think it's personal against Tyrion. Baelish is a ruthless power politician who does everything that serves himself. It least I can't really see any pattern: Jon Arryn was about to find out that Joffrey and his siblings have no right to the throne - would have been a disaster for the Lannisters, so he killed Arren. Also he supported Cersei against Ned Stark when he found out the same, and he was killed. Which would make Baelish a Lannister-agent. On the other hand he killed Joffrey and also with his comment on the dagger was willing to sacrifice Tyrion, not very pro-Lannister. (I do think though that Tyrian at some point admits that it was indeed his dagger, but he had lost it, or it was stolen. I'd have to re-watch.) So again the conclusion Baelish serves Baelish. Weakening everone, makes him stronger. And there might be ties and family-background we do not know yet. So I agree, I do not like him either. His cunning and ruthlessness is frightening. But he's definitely acting well and good for the story, one never knows what he will do next and why.

i think littlefinger was pro lannister early on because he saw them as the greatest way for him to get more power. Â so he did whatever he could to "help" them, but mostly looking out for himself and what was in his best interests to get the most power. once he started realizing how much of a douche joffery was and how he was uncontrollable, he made new alliances with the tyrells. Â there is some point where he is talking on the ship to sansa about both alliances and how the one with the tyrells was the easier or safer option. Â with maybe vary's being the only one who is close to litlefinger, he is definetly heads above everyone else i think with long term planning and strategy
Â 
just some things to think about moving into the final episode
Â 
what do you think will happen to jorah now? if he actually does stay away from dany, what would his storyline be where else could he go? maybe to night's watch if he thinks his father is still alive?
Â 
believe tyrion will definitely be sentenced to death, not quite sure whether it will happen or not, if anyone comes to his aid i believe it will be jaime
Â 
what happens to arya and the hound do you think they still go inside the vale, will they finda sansa or will they stay out on their own
771	AryaSansa	2014-06-12	Hated this episode.Â  There was no plot, just fight scenes.Â  Also, the fighting didn't make any sense.Â  Why would Mance send people behind the wall to attack during a "test run"?Â  Why not send all your forces behind the wall?
Â 
Also, why were there so few wildlings attacking the gate?Â  Why did the giant who lifted the gate go inside?Â  He should have held it open and propped it up so everyone could get through.
Â 
I like Blackwater much better!
Â 
Â 
Also, I hate that little boy for killing Ygritte.Â  And the way they portrayed Ygritte's death was terrible.Â  At least let her loosen the bow indicating that she wasn't going to kill Jon.Â  Or have Ygritte kill that bald dude just before he was going to kill Jon.Â Â  I wish Jon Snow would die, he's an annoying character.
Â 
So were there really 100,000 wildlings?Â  I just saw a big bush fire, but not many wildlings.
Â 
I really hoped the wildlings would win.Â  The wildlings are like the Germanic tribes vs the Roman Empire.Â  We always see the Germans lose, like in Gladiator, was hoping they'd win this time
772	valirpaz	2014-06-12	what do you think will happen to jorah now? if he actually does stay away from dany, what would his storyline be where else could he go? maybe to night's watch if he thinks his father is still alive?


Considering how they portraied him I can't see that he changes sides. He seems like the kind of guy who would still look for ways to support her from a distance. For example go back to Westeros and send her useful information. Or try to forge new alliances in Braavos. maybe it's also an option to have him disappear.
Â 


what happens to arya and the hound do you think they still go inside the vale, will they finda sansa or will they stay out on their own


From how the stories have developed so far, I doubt there will be a reunion. Arya was so close before, and Brann / Jon were so close too and it didn't happen. They could still go in but maybe Sansa is travelling around, and if they meet at all, I think it will be short before some other dramatic event occurs.
Â 


Also, why were there so few wildlings attacking the gate?Â  Why did the giant who lifted the gate go inside?Â  He should have held it open and propped it up so everyone could get through.


I agree with you on that, I also thought that about the giant.
Â 


And the way they portrayed Ygritte's death was terrible.Â  At least let her loosen the bow indicating that she wasn't going to kill Jon.


Yes but why? Wasn't her hesitating close to it? She indicated she was unsure about whether she should kill him. Would loosening the bow rightaway fit her character? She fired three (or four?) arrows into him last time. So I thought this ambiguity in the scene fit.
Â 


I wish Jon Snow would die, he's an annoying character.


Can you maybe explain? It's natural everyone has characters they like and dislike, I'm just interested in what/why you find him annoying.
Â 


I really hoped the wildlings would win.Â  The wildlings are like the Germanic tribes vs the Roman Empire.Â  We always see the Germans lose, like in Gladiator, was hoping they'd win this time 


Who knows maybe Jon can negotiate a compromise. The North is lost anyways, so what does it matter if it's controlled by the Lannisters or by Wildlings, provided they settled down in their original lands and did not slay everyone? So far I see your point but don't feel much about the Wildlings. Would have been different if say, Jon stayed with them longer and we got more attachment. Or if they were at the border of King's landings with the real contrast yes, but the North is more Central European Knights rather than Romans, I'm not sure I'd like to see all these lands being pillaged and burnt and butchered.
Â 
PS: [off topic] I do agree with you though that in popular film or also in documentaries (e.g. Rome - Rise and Fall of an Empire) there's quite a imbalanced storytelling about the "good, civil" Romans (how brutally they may be) vs the scary ruthless "barbarians".
773	ma_liky	2014-06-13	Thanks, nice to hear! Although it must be funny to see people wildly guess about things that you already know. 
Â 
Â 
I think that's how I will spend part of this year too: re-watch the 4 seasons. We should then open a non spoiler thread to discuss our new connections. My problem is that in a book I could flip back and forth pages where somebody is from who he is related to, check maps. Whereas on TV I forget things and think by this I miss a lot too, probably a lot more connections could be made with more attention to detail.Â Â 


Â 
I have to say that I am very interested about the story and history of GOT, so I managed to read something that had happened before the beggining of the story, staying out of spoilers of what is going to happen in the future. I explored the maps and the houses history, some "creatures" and some people who and what somethings are and how they managed to be where they are. I dont know if all of that is written in the books but it gave a depth to the story and my knowlage of matters in GOT. And I have to admit that that made me more interested and amaized how big and detailed is the world of GOT.
Â

Â 
I can understand why you didnt like the episode, we all have ours preferences in the show and want to see our favourite characters develop quickly and their stories in every episode. But this is why this show is great because it has so many characters and stories and everyone is given enough time. I loved this episode because GOT can allow themselfs to have a whole episode aboutÂ  no story movent, or is it?
Â 
I dont aggree with you about almost everything. The whole episode I thought she would kill Jon I thought this to the point before she dies. She hesitated it is well seen, doesnt matter who killed her. She couldnt kill Jon.
I understand that all have their favourite characters but saying that Jon should be dead I dont understand. I would also like to hear why. I think Jon is one of rare who is honest and true. He is loyal and in somewhat naive, but that gives him innocence and honor. He is one of the characters that is uncorrupted and actualy good. He is still to grow in seasons to come. His goodnes should be nurtured.
Â 
I think that there are 100.000 wildings, but why put them all in the first battel. The war is still to come. It is the question of who will come to aid the NW. And the fact that White Walkers are close and the wildings are running away from them too. So even alliance is probable. The real enemy are White walkers and how to stop them is true challenge.

Â 
I think Jorah will stay somewhere close to Meereen. He loves Dany he will try to stay close. I think first he will get drunk and cry about losing Dany but than trying to get back to her what ever the price.  this is what I would do. I feel sorry for him, it was too harsh on him he didnt deserve it. He was indeed loyal to her and truly loves her. But this is why he should have been honest with her, if he had told her at the beggining and admited himself I think she would have forgiven him, but finding out like this how can she trust him again.
I realy hope Tyrion will somehow manage to escape, and I think if some one is to help him it is Jamie. In my eyes Jamie will get some plus points for this. 
Well I am confused about what happens with Arya and the Hound, maybe he will try to randsome her to Jon now at the wall and join the NW. I dont think they will find Sansa, because no one knows that Sansa is Sansa they think she is Littlefingers niece, some Lords do but non who is able to tell Arya. So they will have to do something else. Maybe Arya escapes or he lets her go. I am interestid to se how it plays out.

This is a very good point you made. In the discussion thread of the last episode I said about the aunt's death: "generally I don't see, how this should change their plans. Yes the aunt's dead but that still means that she's got her cousin in the vale and shouldn't make it less safe for her. And if you apply traditional nobility values her cousin would still reward the hound. But I'm sure there'll be an event why that won't happen."
But now, with what you said, if Arya learns that Baelish has custody of her cousin and thus in a powerful position - that might be a reason why Arya will not enter the Vale - and thus not meet Sansa.
Â 
I think Arya and the Hound will stick together. They are a great combination and by now I think Arya starts to like the Hound and vice versa. Also she thinks she has no family left so he's the only one who protects her in these dangerous lands. I'm not sure Jon would be such a logical choice to go to: Doesn't being in the watch basically mean you live without much property? How could the Hound think he could get any money off Jon? But moving North would be an interesting turn: it would be very dangerous because around Winterfell people would probably recognise her. And where else would they move (other than that Arya has to end up in Braavos.

993	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-08	Quote from aFfC: "Why do you think Maester Aemon was sent to the wall when by all right he was to become an archmaester?" I highly doubt it was his own choice.


Â 
Another quote from AFfC and this one from the mouth of Aemon himself:
Â 
"The old man heard him. Though Aemon's eyes had dimmed and gone dark, there was nothing wrong with his ears. "I was not born blind," he reminded them. "When last I passed this way, I saw every rock and tree and whitecap, and watched the grey gulls flying in our wake. I was five-and-thirty and had been a maester of the chain for sixteen years. Egg wanted me to help him rule, but I knew my place was here. He sent me north aboard the Golden Dragon, and insisted that his friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch. No recruit had arrived at the Wall with so much pomp since Nymeria sent the Watch six kings in golden fetters. Egg emptied out the dungeons too, so I would not need to say my vows alone. My honor guard, he called them. One was no less a man than Brynden Rivers. Later he was chosen lord commander.""
Â 
Aemon therefore went voluntarily to the Wall because Egg (King Aegon V) would not have allowed him to be forced.
994	booknerd2	2014-06-08	That made me choke on popcorn but it was soooo worth it!

Stan, you're on on a roll tonight. Almost better than watching the episode (which, unfortunately, I'm not. Soon Â .)


Cheers.Â 
This Ep is so fast paced. Loves it. D&D good job, Neil Marshal you fooking Legend.
1055	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	I'm not even watching this, but HURRY UP STANNIS!!!!!
1056	kingofcombos	2014-06-08	I wanna hear more about Sam.
1057	The Drunkard	2014-06-08	So I take it this episode is a good one.
1058	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-08	Im at a hotel right now so I can't watch but it sounds like Stannis won't show up until next week?


All it takes is one final shot for that, though. Â Don't give up hope.
1059	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	So, let's see.  Janos Blount gets a Purple Heart, right?
1060	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Yeah, this was like one of the fastest hours ever.
1061	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	So I take it this episode is a good one.


Absolutely fantastic.
1062	Hakairyu	2014-06-08	The day siege has yet to happen, Stannis is next week.
1063	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	Yeah, this was like one of the fastest hours ever.


Is it over?
1064	Greywolf2375	2014-06-08	be interesting to see a count of how many brothers were seen to die and how many they say are left. Â Starting with 102 they're down....a shitload.
1065	Hakairyu	2014-06-08	be interesting to see a count of how many brothers were seen to die and how many they say are left. Â Starting with 102 they're down....a shitload.


They had a little over 300 at first didn't they?

Noye might be cut from the show, but he's there in spirit!
1069	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-08	theirs still 12 minutes left fellas, calm down. GOT fashion always save things for the last 5 minutes
1070	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Come on Stannis. Please arrive.
1071	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-08	The day siege has yet to happen, Stannis is next week.


Good God - that will be ONE packed episode!
1072	Mr Fixit	2014-06-08	The day siege has yet to happen, Stannis is next week.


Â 
But what about Marshall's comments on "three simultaneous battles"?
1073	Greywolf2375	2014-06-08	So, let's see. Janos Blount gets a Purple Heart, right?


Janos Slynt? Â I don't think Boros Blount made this round of the fight...
1074	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Is it over?


Â 
No, but in the blink of an eye 9:10 became 9:50. It flew.
1075	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-08	So I take it this episode is a good one.


Â 
Most certainly!!
1076	Mya Stone	2014-06-08	Grenn
1077	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	Â 
But what about Marshall's comments on "three simultaneous battles"?


Yeah, and have we seen the Jon/Sam pic from this ep that's in daylight?
1078	Greywolf2375	2014-06-08	Aw Grenn. Â
1079	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-08	Â 
But what about Marshall's comments on "three simultaneous battles"?


Yes, I've got everything crossed that I can cross here, folks!
1080	Pearlthegirl	2014-06-08	RIP Grenn
1081	sk888888	2014-06-08	I think this entire episode was show in only 4 colors: Â white, black, night, and BLOOD. Â Very dark.
1082	Raksha 2014	2014-06-08	"They held the Gate"....awww.
1083	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	Grenn, too?  Ack!
1084	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	Â 
No, but in the blink of an eye 9:10 became 9:50. It flew.


Oh, thank goodness. I was worried they'd left out Stannis.
1085	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	WHAT HAPPENED TO THORNE???!!!
1086	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-08	This fight is gonna take up half of the finale as well guys simmer down.
1087	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-08	Aw Grenn. Â  


Bugger it!
1088	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Donal Noye erm i mean Grenn RIP.

1090	Newstar	2014-06-08	Noooo, Grenn! Noooo, Pyp!
1091	Hakairyu	2014-06-08	I will need to watch this again. Way too fast xD
1092	Zman1863	2014-06-08	Grenn and Pyp. I've never cared much about the premature show deaths, but those two hurt more, especially when they could have easily had Alliser stand in for Noye.Â
1093	Tywin Manderly	2014-06-08	theirs still 12 minutes left fellas, calm down. GOT fashion always save things for the last 5 minutes


Â 
Indeed. They could do the same as they did with Blackwater.
1094	Keden	2014-06-08	Hate this episode for killing off Grenn and Pyp. Fuck that man. Fuck that.
1095	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	No sign of him yet? Has day broken?
1096	ebevan91	2014-06-08	No wonder the finale is 15 minutes longer.
1097	WinterKing	2014-06-08	It ends THIS way?
1098	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	Ahh! The watchers in the wall soundtrack
1099	Raksha 2014	2014-06-08	Darn. Â No Stannis.
1100	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-08	Grenn and Pyp. I've never cared much about the premature show deaths, but those two hurt more, especially when they could have easily had Alliser stand in for Noye.Â 


Yeah - I really LOVED show!Grenn.
1101	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-08	Here goes Jon and that's all she wrote??!?!?

Next week should be three hours long!
1102	kingofcombos	2014-06-08	OH COME ON.
1103	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	Unbelievable. End it without Stannis.
1104	SerHaHa	2014-06-08	Wow, I can't believe it.
Â 
Best episode of the entire series so far, even with the killing of 2 NW guys I wanted to keep watching.
1105	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Now it is overâ<U+0080>¦blink and miss it fast.
1106	Hakairyu	2014-06-08	I think someone said there were 12 minutes? *mocking tone*
1107	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Noooooo.
1108	Greywolf2375	2014-06-08	So this was the episode from Dinklage's interview that was the "stabby stabby stabby" part of his take on the show.
1109	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	Wow.
1110	sati	2014-06-08	are you fucking kidding me?!
1111	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	What, no Stanis this episode?

1120	Greywolf2375	2014-06-08	the shorting of the episode time is still annoying.
1121	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Next week looks awesome too.

1125	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	Wait, WTF? How did it end?

1130	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	No Stannis, No party.
1131	Newstar	2014-06-08	D&D said that they'd kill off a character who was still alive in the books. If I'm not mistaken, Pyp, Grenn and Thorne are all still alive in the books, no?
1132	Lady Lurksalot	2014-06-08	THAT. WAS. AMAZING!
1133	Zman1863	2014-06-08	Cliffhanger! I worried they would keep it until next season, but it looks like the finale is going to have a whole lot of ground to cover.Â
1134	Lightning Tiger	2014-06-08	I think after this it cannot be disputed that Weiss and Benioff must totally hate Stannis, i mean really....

Â 
I just popped in for the OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGÂ 
Â 
of that. Â YIKES!!~!~
1137	Pearlthegirl	2014-06-08	My GF hated it but she's not into a wall to wall(pun intended) battle episodes.  Best shot was the panoramic of the Castle Black fight!
1138	NightStark	2014-06-08	I knew Stannis wouldn't arrive this week, the ep. 10 synopsis was pretty telling;
Â 

Â 
An unexpected arrival north of the Wall changes circumstances. Dany is forced to face harsh realities. Bran learns more of his destiny. Tyrion sees the truth of his situation.
1139	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	I think after this it cannot be disputed that Weiss and Benioff must totally hate Stannis, i mean really....


I agree. Lets see what D&D apologists have to say.
1140	Hakairyu	2014-06-08	Oh ffs everybody calm down. You'll get your Stannis dosage, I promise. The ending wasn't horrible and the episode was amazing.
1141	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	We were all wrong about when we'd get Stan. I guess that'll open next episode. Don't fret, StanStans, he'll still get his due, you'll just have to wait another week.
1142	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-08	Holy cow Gilly was sexually assaulted.
1143	Dru	2014-06-08	Have a feeling next weeks episode will be very cramped. Good episode this week but it started late and ended early and could have skipped the "what does sex feel like?" crap at the beginning to at least have Jon with Mance and the horns blowing.
1144	Newstar	2014-06-08	The promo and 4x10 ep synopsis make it pretty clear that Stannis is showing up next episode.
Â 
Holy cow Gilly was sexually assaulted.
Â 
Wait, what? (Assuming you mean other than Craster raping her back when.)

1147	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	It's not even 9'pm!

Â 
MALDITOS PENDEJOS!!! DONDE CARAJOS ESTA STANNIS?????!?!?!?!
1148	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-08	D&D said that they'd kill off a character who was still alive in the books. If I'm not mistaken, Pyp, Grenn and Thorne are all still alive in the books, no?


Â 
they are all alive in the books, I'm not certain how Alister is on the show. Â I am pissed at the Grenn thing, I thought Alistar might stop him and go in his place? Â After Pyp, who never was book Pyp, I thought good ole Grenn had a chance.
Â 
Damn, no Stannis, people are gonna freak.Â
1149	jbob	2014-06-08	Stannis is obviously coming next week, people. It's silly to hate an entire episode for just that.
1150	greywindsrage	2014-06-08	OPEN THE FUCKING GATE!


Â 

DWL
1151	sati	2014-06-08	that is some fucking bullshit, ending the big battle episode before the big battle ends, what a joke
1152	Addam of Hull	2014-06-08	The rage of StanStans is hilarious.  He'll show up next week.  Calm your tits.  They haven't actually fucked him up in any way by delaying the latter half of the battle.
1153	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	So, what DiD happen to Alliser Thorne?
1154	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-06-08	D&D love to overlook Stannis, just like Bob the Great. How wise of them
1155	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-08	Holy cow Gilly was sexually assaulted.


WHAT??!!!
1156	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Stannis is obviously coming next week, people. It's silly to hate an entire episode for just that.


Not really the build is for Stannis to arrive and lead to the victory. But no Stannis can't have his triumphant moment. D&D your hatred is all too obvious now.
1157	SerHaHa	2014-06-08	I think considering the route D and D are taking with the books/tv show series to book line up, season 5 and 6 will have a disporportionate amount of Stannis.Â  I mean, it'll have to right, considering that many other story lines are over due to deaths etc.Â  I live in hope for a Stannis+10vorpal weapon season 5.Â  Or episode 10.Â  If Stannis and co get 25 mins of time in ep 10, the good times will roll.
1158	Jamie Lannister	2014-06-08	Can we all agree Thorne was the best character in that episode?Â
1159	E-Ro	2014-06-08	Stannis is not saving the wall. either jon will singlehandedly kill every wildling or Dany dispatched a covert force of unsullied to break the wildling army. Instead of STANNIS STANNIS STANNIS we will get KHALEESI KHALEESI KHALEESI.Â 
Â 
Fuck this showÂ
1160	NightStark	2014-06-08	Not really the build is for Stannis to arrive and lead to the victory. But no Stannis can't have his triumphant moment. D&D your hatred is all too obvious now.


Â 
It will happen just as it does in the books, Stannis rides through the morning after while Jon is in Mance's camp.
1161	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Stannis is obviously coming next week, people. It's silly to hate an entire episode for just that.This...they obviously wanted to focus on just the characters at the Wall without Stannis and the rest overtaking them. This also gives them more time to deal with Mance.
1162	Longman240	2014-06-08	I agree, they should have had Stannis this week, there were minutes to be cut from this episode for sure. Ending was contrived too.
1163	Iron Maiden Islands	2014-06-08	Stannis comes while Jon is meeting Mance, wouldn't make any sense to have him in this episode. Tons of great action this week, and lots of great stuff coming next week. Settle down people jeez
1164	sati	2014-06-08	The rage of StanStans is hilarious. He'll show up next week. Calm your tits. They haven't actually fucked him up in any way by delaying the latter half of the battle.


They deprived him of glorious ending and they deprived the battle episode of one. Fuck D&D never again am I defending them
1165	MsLibby	2014-06-08	Stannis is not saving the wall. either jon will singlehandedly kill every wildling or Dany dispatched a covert force of unsullied to break the wildling army. Instead of STANNIS STANNIS STANNIS we will get KHALEESI KHALEESI KHALEESI.Â 
Â 
Fuck this showÂ 


Â 
Huh? We knew he wasn't going to be in this episode because the episode descriptions have him in NEXT week's show.
1166	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-08	Shoud have known too hopeful expecting stannis!!
1167	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	D&D i trusted you and you failed me.
1168	Dru	2014-06-08	No way they would fit Stannis this week. Expected Jon to be at Mance's camp at least and the next attack on the wall and the ending with horns blowing.
1169	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-08	WHAT??!!!


Â 
Sammy the slayer forced himself on her without consent.
1170	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	Remember when we were happy that Stephen Dillane wasn't in the opening credits?
1171	sj4iy	2014-06-08	So, what DiD happen to Alliser Thorne?Looked like he was sliced through the leg, but I could be wrong.
1172	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	I am fuming because there was no Stannis arrival. That was pretty much entirely what I was looking forward to and expected to be the climax of the episode. Yeah they'll have it next week but the episode will be packed with things. Dany, Bran, Tyrion's escape and killing Tywin...all on top of the parlay with Mance and Stannis arriving. Hope they can do it all justice.
1173	Obebb	2014-06-08	Initial thoughts:
Â 
I didn't like it.
1174	Fredwin	2014-06-08	Yes, how long until we get our Ser Allister Thorne appreciation thread? Hard to hate the bastahd'.
1175	Fool of a Book	2014-06-08	Can we all agree Thorne was the best character in that episode?Â 


Â Outstanding.
1176	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	They deprived him of glorious ending and they deprived the battle episode of one. Fuck D&D never again am I defending them


Oath. No point in having it next week. Just bullshit D&D.
1177	of man and wolf	2014-06-08	Needed way more Ghost. Fuck Stannis, he'll be there next week anyway.
1178	WrathOfTinyKittens	2014-06-08	Grenn and Pyp :'-(
I'm honestly super sad about Grenn. I loved the character and the actor was solid. And that beard.
1179	cydas	2014-06-08	This was supposed to be the moment of Stannis. Whatever happens next episode, people will mostly remember Tyrion killing Tywin.
1180	NightStark	2014-06-08	I don't know why people thought he was coming this week, it was clear from the ep.10 synopsis that he was arriving next week.
1181	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	FUCK EVERYTHING.
Â 
NEXT WEEK IS NOT THE SAME.
Â 
HE SHOLD HAVE COME TONIGHT
Â 
I AGREE.
Â 
THEY HATE STANNIS
Â 
AND I HATE THEM TOO.
Â 
FUCK THEM! JODANSE TODOS!!!!!
1182	teej6	2014-06-08	No Stannis, seriously! I mean how are they going to manage to show it all next episode.
1183	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	That flew.  Now to watch my recording.
1184	Howdyphillip	2014-06-08	All of the calls for people being upset that Stannis didn't appear yet are about as unwarranted as any criticism that I have ever heard about this show. This episode was about the first night of battle. There is no Stannis in the first night of the battle for the wall.Â 
Â 
I have a few issues with the episode, but they are mostly budget related. I didn't think that the show actually was able to capture the scale of the battle.
1185	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	All it means is that next week's episode will be even better.
1186	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-08	So, what DiD happen to Alliser Thorne?


Â 
He seemed to be dragged off still injured, by NW men, I think? Â
1187	Keden	2014-06-08	Really disappointed. There were a couple of "oh cool" moments but beyond that. We lost Grenn & Pyp, Alliser was somehow supercool dude and Ygritte felt kind of forced. Somehow the circumstances in the books - finding her without knowing who'd shot the arrow and all that - seemed more appropriately tragic. I know it's only an adaptation but jeez. And then no Stannis at the end. Quite frankly I'd say this is one of the poorer episodes this season, and Blackwater knocks it out of the park by a long shot.
1188	Jasta11	2014-06-08	I'm more pissed that it makes for a pretty stupid ending. Having the trumpets roar and knights charge the Wildlings would make for a far better end than just a cliffhanger.
1189	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-08	Terrible episode. Waste of Neil Marshall.
1190	Dru	2014-06-08	Love the Stannis butthurt. Not a big deal and episode would have been hugely rushed and it wouldn't have been as significant.Â
1191	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	This...they obviously wanted to focus on just the characters at the Wall without Stannis and the rest overtaking them. This also gives them more time to deal with Mance.

Yeah exactly. But it felt like a tease of an episode. It moved very quickly
1192	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Just pure D&D bullshit. I take it back that you did good job.Â
1193	Zman1863	2014-06-08	Anyone's book allegiances curiously reversed during the Alliser/Tormund fight? I can't like show Tormund. Show Alliser is pretty close to how I'd picture him in those situations.Â
1194	NightStark	2014-06-08	No Stannis, seriously! I mean how are they going to manage to show it all next episode.


It's 15 mins longer.
1195	MoIaF	2014-06-08	Can we all agree Thorne was the best character in that episode?

He really was excellent.
1196	igrewupinKL	2014-06-08	Gods dammit i shouldn't have read the commentary im so spoiled right now.
I guess the bright side is i can enjoy the episode without expecting Stannis to show up and then being disappointedÂ 
Â 
the battle hasn't finished, Stannis is in 4x10 don't worry guys

1197	DarkerStar	2014-06-08	Stannis comes while Jon is meeting Mance, wouldn't make any sense to have him in this episode. Tons of great action this week, and lots of great stuff coming next week. Settle down people jeez


I thought I was the only person who remembered this. Actually I just remembered it myself. But why did they have to kill Pyp and Grenn? My heart can't take this stuff man
1198	Dracarys00	2014-06-08	No Stannis, I cannot believe!
1199	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-08	LOL, I'm sorry, but I find the lack of Stannis fucking hilarious.
1200	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-08	FUCK EVERYTHING.
Â 
NEXT WEEK IS NOT THE SAME.
Â 
HE SHOLD HAVE COME TONIGHT
Â 
I AGREE.
Â 
THEY HATE STANNIS
Â 
AND I HATE THEM TOO.
Â 
FUCK THEM! JODANSE TODOS!!!!!


Â 
Damn, I wish I was bilingual, I'm sure you are tossing out some good ones.
Â 
I can't believe this and it's hard to say that it's for any other reason than Stannis doesn't mean much to them. Â Hell, they'd have killed him off by now, too, if he wasn't still making stuff happen in TWOW chapters, sorry to say.Â
1201	teej6	2014-06-08	Kit Harrington was good though. I liked the episode. Would have been better if there was Stannis & Co in the end.
1202	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	I mean, when you really consider it I suppose this makes the most sense. There's supposed to be a respite from the battle while Jon is sent out to parlay with Mance. Then the horsemen arrive. It was like this in the books as well. I'll reserve judgement till I've watched it, but if STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS! is one of the last scenes of the episode I think it could be spectacular.
1203	LyrnaSnowBunnyAvenger	2014-06-08	Aemon droppin' the knowledge on Sam. Â And Sam showing some balls....but no pink mast yet


Â 
I hope I am not alone in avidly hoping the fat pink mast never makes an appearence in its shining glory.
1204	Stannis-the-Mannis	2014-06-08	I didn't mind it at first but I do think they're going to downplay Stannis arriving next week. There's too much else that needs wrapping up.Â
1205	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-08	Didnt you guys aalready read that the unexpectig arrival was ep 10 mentioned way earlier lol. It wasnt tonights descripton lol.
1206	MoIaF	2014-06-08	Oh - forgot to mention, Ygritte's death did not have the emotional punch it should have had.  I have to say Kit was a bit off.
1207	jbob	2014-06-08	Not really the build is for Stannis to arrive and lead to the victory. But no Stannis can't have his triumphant moment. D&D your hatred is all too obvious now.


Â 
The men of the NW needed to have their due. To be shown as capable and have their own victory. Having Stannis in this episode would've robbed them of that. They would've come across as weak. This way I think is better I think.
1208	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Love the Stannis butthurt. Not a big deal and episode would have been hugely rushed and it wouldn't have been as significant.Â 


Loves the apologists. Clearly Stannis is meant to arrive to save the wall in the episode they are getting annihilated. It would be a Glorious ending and a stark contrast to what he faced in S2 Ep 9.Â 
I knew GRRM should've written this episode.Â
1209	Dain Storm	2014-06-08	I'm not really mad that Stannis didn't show up, I'm just dissapointed that his big moment will now be overshadowed by Lady Stoneheart and Tyrion's escape.  Unsullied still won't really care about him. Otherwise entertaining episode.
1210	JonInVa	2014-06-08	Looked like he was sliced through the leg, but I could be wrong.

I thought he got it across the stomach. Can't really tell, though.
1211	E-Ro	2014-06-08	You know whats pretty funny, I think the anti stannis people are more pissed at Stannis fans criticism of the show then the stannis fans themselves are mad at the lack of Stannis.Â 
Â 
Too funny.Â
1212	Longman240	2014-06-08	Thorne was superb, but what a badass moment for Tormund, there's like seven arrows in him and he's still mowing people down
1213	sertravisredbeard	2014-06-08	I think they saved Stannis for the next episode to throw off the whole "Episode Nine" being momentous and shocking thing. Â We all knew the battle was going to be this episode, and all the bookreaders knew it ended with Stannis showing up and saving the day. Â Throwing off the bookreaders and the Unsullied at the same time might have been the goal. Â I'm still upset about Pyp and Grenn though.
Â 
Was Slynt dead or just shellshocked? Â If he's dead I'm more upset about that. Â His scene with Jon in Dance is Jon's best in the entire series.
Â 
I liked Thorne's duel with Tormund. Â Him being more of a main character lines up with some people's predictions of him warming up to Jon when he comes back from his ranging and R+L is revealed. Â I hope so anyway.

1214	Sunglass	2014-06-08	Garbage episode
1215	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Best part for me was when Jon came down out of elevator, then he stops for just a second, looks around and then the music changes and he starts kicking ass. Holy shit, was that a fun episode XD
1216	Colonel Green	2014-06-08	I don't know why people thought he was coming this week, it was clear from the ep.10 synopsis that he was arriving next week.


Not really.Â  That was interpreted by most to refer to the changed status quo at the Wall after the battle.
Â 
Cripes, the finale is going to be just crammed at this rate.
1217	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-08	Stannis once again gets the shaft. Instead of shining at the climax of this episode he will get CRAMMED in next episode.
1218	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	Also do we know if Thorne is dead? His wound didn't initially appear mortal (he got sliced in the lower body I thought and then dragged away by his men). Sam said he had fallen but not sure if that means he is dead or just was out of commission for the rest of the fight.
1219	Alia Atreides	2014-06-08	I Â loved Sam so MUCH; see he can be quite brave to the naysayers. Am disappointed that Stan the Man Baratheon IS not there. He better be next week and was that Pip that got killed . It was good to have an entire episode in one place but it was way too short.Â
1220	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	I'm not really mad that Stannis didn't show up, I'm just dissapointed that his big moment will now be overshadowed by Lady Stoneheart and Tyrion's escape. Unsullied still won't really care about him. Otherwise entertaining episode.


Yeah basically this too. He gets over-shadowed by LS and Tyrion's escape. Again neglected.Â
1221	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Not really.Â  That was interpreted by most to refer to the changed status quo at the Wall after the battle.Â Cripes, the finale is going to be just crammed at this rate.It is 66 minutes long, so I guess they will have the time.
1222	booknerd2	2014-06-08	I saw Pyp go, Alliser is injured, what happened to Grenn? My dog was acting up and I missed it.
Â 
And Stannis would have been a nice arrival. And I agree, a little too light on the Ghost. Thought he was going to take a chunk out of Ygritte. The show writes whatever so you never know.
1223	Talbot	2014-06-08	You know whats pretty funny, I think the anti stannis people are more pissed at Stannis fans criticism of the show then the stannis fans themselves are mad at the lack of Stannis.Â 
Â 
Too funny.Â 


You know that's not true
1224	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-08	Stannis will be coming next week but it won't be as impressive. Too many other climatic/exciting scenes are happening in the finale so "Stannis Stannis STANNIS!" won't get the spotlight it deserves.
1225	stunningsteve	2014-06-08	So, what DiD happen to Alliser Thorne?


I guess and hope he is severely wounded but still alive. That would also explain why he is not going to campaign for LC and is supporting Slynt instead.
No Stannis this episode sucks and they really should have included it here. However due to that the finale next week will be even better.
1226	Blutrabe	2014-06-08	Guys....
Â 
Â 
The promos showed Stannis' attack in DAYLIGHT.
Â 
The next episode's description hints at Stannis' arrival.
Â 
Dillane etc. were not credited.
Â 
Â 
Stop deluding yourselves.
1227	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Also do we know if Thorne is dead? His wound didn't initially appear mortal (he got sliced in the lower body I thought and then dragged away by his men). Sam said he had fallen but not sure if that means he is dead or just was out of commission for the rest of the fight.I don't think he's dead yet. If he dies, we will see it.
1228	The Drunkard	2014-06-08	This show, jesus.
1229	sati	2014-06-08	I was so fucking angry I turned it off before promo
1230	FNF	2014-06-08	I was thinking to myself "How can they fuck this up", after watching the Giants, Mammoths, Thorne and other magnificent performances... BUT THAT ENDING!!11!!???? My fucking god... How anti-climatic.Â 
Â 
Now Stannis' arrival is going to be played down like hell most likely because scenes like Dany locking her dragons away and Tyrion killing Tywin are going to be in line for being the final scenes of the season. I'm convinced D&D have it in for him....
1231	JonInVa	2014-06-08	I'm not really mad that Stannis didn't show up, I'm just dissapointed that his big moment will now be overshadowed by Lady Stoneheart and Tyrion's escape.  Unsullied still won't really care about him. Otherwise entertaining episode.

The way things are going, there may no be a LS. How much can they cram into one finale at this point?
1232	teej6	2014-06-08	I mean, when you really consider it I suppose this makes the most sense. There's supposed to be a respite from the battle while Jon is sent out to parlay with Mance.

STANNIS! is one of the last scenes of the episode I think it could be spectacular.

I hope you are right. But there's too much happening in the finale. How are they going to give screen time to Stannis and the Wall. Besides, we all know that d&d aren't very fondof Stannis. Unless they want to gjve 5 mins to Danny next week, I don't see how it's going to work.
1233	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I saw Pyp go, Alliser is injured, what happened to Grenn? My dog was acting up and I missed it.Â And Stannis would have been a nice arrival. And I agree, a little too light on the Ghost. Thought he was going to take a chunk out of Ygritte. The show writes whatever so you never know.Giant killed him ala Noye from the books.
1234	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	The byline on my DVR recording is "Jon Snow and the Nights Watch face a big challenge."  Ya think?
1235	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	Ygritte was supposed to be a mix of Rambo with Daryl Dixon and tits?
1236	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-08	Oh - forgot to mention, Ygritte's death did not have the emotional punch it should have had.  I have to say Kit was a bit off.

Imagine how much more powerful it would have been if it had happened like seven episodes ago, like it should have. Not after spending an entire season barely even seeing Ygritte and Jon Snow barely ever talking about her.
1237	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	I was thinking to myself "How can they fuck this up", after watching the Giants, Mammoths, Thorne and other magnificent performances... BUT THAT ENDING!!11!!???? My fucking god... How anti-climatic.Â

Fuck D&D. They can't just give his glorious moment.
1238	Theon'sSong	2014-06-08	GRRM really doesn't care about stannis either tho...


Loves the apologists. Clearly Stannis is meant to arrive to save the wall in the episode they are getting annihilated. It would be a Glorious ending and a stark contrast to what he faced in S2 Ep 9.Â 
I knew GRRM should've written this episode.Â
1239	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	Yes, we know Stannis gets there next week.
Â 
AFTER THE BATTLE.
Â 
"Oh, the watch was fighting and dying and Stannis just arrived? Fuck him".
Â 
That's the impression it will get.
Â 
D&D, Ok, we got the indirect pretty clear: you hate Stannis.
1240	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-08	I saw Pyp go, Alliser is injured, what happened to Grenn? My dog was acting up and I missed it.


Â 
Grenn's crew and the giant killed each other in a fight.
1241	Talbot	2014-06-08	Fuck D&D. They can't just give his glorious moment.


You're being ridiculous.
1242	E-Ro	2014-06-08	You know that's not true


It is tho, when some five year old screams to "calm your tits" you know its true.Â
1243	BericDondarrion	2014-06-08	FUCKING HORRIBLE EPISODE

don't forget our baby Ghost... he came in and tore shit up  as in throats
1245	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-08	Pyp.Â 
Grenn.
Â 
You will be missed. Grenn got to be the Donal Noye so its really a badass death. Sad over Pyp dying like a chump though. Â 
The Ygritte moment was good and Jon's absolute grimness afterwards was fitting. He felt like there was nothing left to live for and it shows. Him taking charge kicked so much ass though omg. Little Olly icing Ygritte was how i imagined. Lots of Thenn death.Â
1246	NightStark	2014-06-08	Not really.Â  That was interpreted by most to refer to the changed status quo at the Wall after the battle.
Â 
Cripes, the finale is going to be just crammed at this rate.


'An unexpected arrival north of the Wall', people should learn to interpret better.
Â 
If he had arrived in ep.9 he wouldn't have been 'changing circumstances' in 10.

1247	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	Wow. Has anyone actually watched the preview for 'The Children?' Absolutely epic. I have no doubt the Stannis moment will be amazing.Â
1248	Newstar	2014-06-08	I wasn't feeling Kit's acting when Ygritte was dying. Note to Kit: scrunching your face up is not acting.
Â 
Pretty much everyone saw Ollie killing Ygritte coming a mile away, so that was no great surprise.

					
					
							Edited by Newstar, 08 June 2014 - 09:10 PM.
1249	Simon Steele	2014-06-08	That was the most boring episode ever. So much changed from the book for no point. I feel bad that Martin has to be so closely tied to this--at least when Stephen King's books were mostly ruined into film/tv he wasn't a part of it (though I guess he was a part of it in some cases too).
Â 
I wonder how much input Martin gets anymore, I think he's lost control of this thing and is just watching it spiral away from what he wanted. Then again maybe he loves it.
Â 
Did Tormund say "har" once since he showed up?
Â 
I suppose I shouldn't be upset at how small the battle felt, that's a budget thing, but it never seemed like the Watch were overwhelmed at all. Ever. Had Stannis had his moment it would have had no punch at all.
Â 
If Ygritte's group hadn't attacked then they would have just stood on the wall and taken zero losses. Well one, one of the two giants in the army did kill one man of the Watch. Jon Snow being such a good leader of men (show wise) decides that they don't have a chance now? I mean they aren't going to be attacked from the south again. Then again, he should have known they were going to be attacked from the south as he came over the wall with those guys and knew how many of them there were. SO MUCH DUM.

1251	boojam	2014-06-08	Ok! Well maybe George was right HBO needs to had this off to Warner Brothers and just make feature films the rest of the way!
1252	JonInVa	2014-06-08	I suppose Slynt's cowardly actions set him up for Jon's having him chopped, as opposed to how it goes down in the book.
1253	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	Not really.Â  That was interpreted by most to refer to the changed status quo at the Wall after the battle.
Â 
Cripes, the finale is going to be just crammed at this rate.

It's making me concerned, because that was already a packed episode even assuming the battle was over. Guess no LC election until next season?
1254	DarkerStar	2014-06-08	How can Stannis's arrival be played down? He and 5000 men are going to come in and send 99000 men running. I don't think it is possible to ruin that. You guys are a bit greedy. The show is made for the average fan not the book reader.
1255	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-08	Stannis comes when Jon's talking to Mance you dumbasses. Stop whining.

1256	averde	2014-06-08	This episode and the preview for the next one locks in what I've said about TV Stannis since the beginning. He is one of the shows villians, he's not going to save the wall. Jon Snow will be negotiating with Mance about bringing the Wildlings across because the Others are coming and then boom Stannis heavy cavalry comes in and massacres a bunch of Wildlings. It's sad the show watchers are doing this with a character like Stannis but I am very confident in my analysis at this point.
1257	Epyon	2014-06-08	I liked the episode overall...
Â 
Some things in particular:
Â 
-John gets his taste of command
-John forced to send his friends to their deaths in the tunnel
-John actually wins a damn fight (still gets disarmed though, lol)
-Sam's had a good role this week
-Thorne actually ended up being strangely likeable
Â 
And things I didn't like:
Seriously though, wtf no Stannis... Now you have to chew into next week's show to close that plotline out, on top of:
Killing the Hound, Arya heading to Braavos, Jaime nearly killing Varys/Tyrion's escape, Tysha story time, Shae dying, Tywin dying, and possibly a Lady Stoneheart omg ending... That is a rediculous amount of stuff to push into one episode... especially when the previews also hinted at Cersei/Tywin scenes, and Danaerys/Dragon scenes.
1258	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-08	Â 
But what about Marshall's comments on "three simultaneous battles"?


Grenn's battle with the giant counts as one I suppose.Â
1259	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Â 
Grenn's crew and the giant killed each other in a fight.


Â 
Thanks!

Exactly! Even with the poor acting it would have been so much better if it had been done earlier. 
I honestly felt that the death scene was very dry.  There was no anguish in Kit's face and even Rose Leslie who is usually excellent didn't really sell it.
1261	sj4iy	2014-06-08	don't forget our baby Ghost... he came in and tore shit up  as in throats Admittedly, I clapped and yelled when that happened, Ghost had slipped my mind until then.
1262	Talbot	2014-06-08	Look who's talking.


Yeah, an emotionally stable poster.
Â 
Calm down man.
1263	JonInVa	2014-06-08	don't forget our baby Ghost... he came in and tore shit up  as in throats 

Bonus!
1264	ipsuel	2014-06-08	It makes no sense to hold off Stannis... all it means is more stuff they gotta get into 70-75 mins next time... So now the finale will be even more overstretched than it may already need to be. I'm sure it will be fine, but it won't be great.
Â 
My .02 is that D&D regularly butcher it. Not every episode but on a regular basis, they don't do all that well..Â If you have to make excuses for D&D every week, something's not right.Â 
Â 
I'll still watch but it just ISN'T that great of a show -- and I sooo want it to be Â
1265	E-Ro	2014-06-08	Stannis is getting played down because with all the huge stuff happening next week no one is even going to give a shit about the fight at the wall. As far as tv watchers are concerned the battle is over and won, the wildlings lost.Â
1266	Raksha 2014	2014-06-08	Needed way more Ghost. Fuck Stannis, he'll be there next week anyway.


Â 
Â 
Why didn't they have Ghost out as soon as the Wildlings came inside, or earlier? Â And why isn't Jon taking him along on his mission to kill Mance?
1267	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	This episode and the preview for the next one locks in what I've said about TV Stannis since the beginning.

Ridiculous. How is this indicated? The scene looks like it'll be exactly like the one from the books.
1268	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	I think they can make up for it but I want Stannis's arrival to be the final scene. Or at least the second to last before LS (if she is in it).

Â 
The battle is over.Â
1272	Jasta11	2014-06-08	We know he is in episode 10. It's just that it's going to be incredibly crammed; we have Bran and Bloodraven, Dany's inevitable scene (probably Drogon eating a child), Tyrion's escape and the Tywinicide, Arya abandoning the Hound and going to Braavos, Lady Stoneheart (if she's not here I WILL scream in rage ) and whatever other loose ends they need to tie up (Sansa, Theon, Yara maybe?). Now they also have to put in Jon, Mance and the Stannis cavalry. There's way too many important stuff in the finale. It would have been better to have Stannis arrive in ep. 9 so ep. 10 can entirely focus on what's happening down south.
Â 
And it would have made for better TV for Stannis to save the day after the grueling battle at the Wall.
1273	Cas Stark	2014-06-08	I was thinking to myself "How can they fuck this up", after watching the Giants, Mammoths, Thorne and other magnificent performances... BUT THAT ENDING!!11!!???? My fucking god... How anti-climatic.Â 
Â 
Now Stannis' arrival is going to be played down like hell most likely because scenes like Dany locking her dragons away and Tyrion killing Tywin are going to be in line for being the final scenes of the season. I'm convinced D&D have it in for him....


Â 
I'm beginning to think he must die really early in the next book, because they can't hate him that much, can they?

Why didn't they have Ghost out as soon as the Wildlings came inside, or earlier? Â And why isn't Jon taking him along on his mission to kill Mance?


Â 
Sweets have you read the books? not spoiling but well he is not going to kill anyone.
1275	Theon'sSong	2014-06-08	budgetary reasons really hampered the episode to me. That along with the terrible Ygitte death
1276	MoIaF	2014-06-08	Stannis comes when Jon's talking to Mance you dumbasses. Stop whining.

We know that happens, however, had Jon gone earlier in the episode to meet with Mance and then thy ended the episode with Stannis arrival it would have made the episode overall much better.
1277	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Yeah, an emotionally stable poster.
Â 
Calm down man.


Stable? errr.Â
1278	NightStark	2014-06-08	Â 
Â 
Why didn't they have Ghost out as soon as the Wildlings came inside, or earlier?Â  


Â 
Jon was on top of the Wall with the key.
1279	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	The problem for me isn't that there won't be any Stannis looking heroic...the problem is that this was a bad call just in terms of narrative. Now this story has to cut into an already packed episode to conclude the plot of something that should have been finished. It felt like a sudden, oddly disjointed episode. But maybe it's just because we know what happens so that frames how we would want to see episodes done?
1280	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	This episode and the preview for the next one locks in what I've said about TV Stannis since the beginning. He is one of the shows villians, he's not going to save the wall. Jon Snow will be negotiating with Mance about bringing the Wildlings across because the Others are coming and then boom Stannis heavy cavalry comes in and massacres a bunch of Wildlings. It's sad the show watchers are doing this with a character like Stannis but I am very confident in my analysis at this point.


That's pretty much the exact same thing that happens in the book. Â
1281	Gladiator of Dorne	2014-06-08	Truly a missed opportunity.
Â 
Why spend the entire episode at the wall only to end like that? At this rate they should have included at least Arya or even Dany's arc... this just feels like an incomplete episode, a massive letdown from last week, and we can only assume next week is going to suffer in a massive way without time for those major plot twists (Tywin's death, Stannis's arrival at the Wall) to breathe on their own.
Â 
Also, wtf HBO? Was a advertisement for True Blood REALLY necessary enough to cut into your premiere show, which, on top of that, is already cut six minutes short?

1284	MR92	2014-06-08	the most positive part of this episode was us getting our very first view through GHOSTS eyes! i believe this is the first GhostCam weve gotten right?
1285	Theon'sSong	2014-06-08	and all Stannis fanboys need to just stop. Stannis is not a protagonist of the show or the book series, despite certain readers affinity to his moral rigidity.Â
1286	Fool of a Book	2014-06-08	Jon proves himself in the first invasion, Stannis doesn't show up at the Wall til after the parlay with Mance... why are people whining about this?
Â 
Jon finally kicks ass and shows his leadership skills, and all you can think about is Stannis? Â Come on now.

This...they obviously wanted to focus on just the characters at the Wall without Stannis and the rest overtaking them. This also gives them more time to deal with Mance.


Â 
this. in fact, the thing that i kept thinking throughout the episode is that they are really making the watch look good. not like a rag tag bunch of losers and crooks but real men doing what needs to be done. i think they needed their moment since they really have looked like a weak bunch of idiots so far.
Â 
i also thought the horn blowing off screen was stannis arriving. i still think it's him - it was not the watch and it wasn't the wildings, so we'll see stannis next week for the end of season cliff hanger. that really does make sense when you think about it.

I knew it. Stannis is the ultimate villain in the eyes of D&D. Gods they hate him.Â
1289	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I like how they are changing things where it is Jon who decides to go 'parley' with Mance (i.e. sacrifice himself to kill Mance)...he's definitely the leader of the NW now in all but name.
1290	Cold Feet	2014-06-08	No fucking Stannis....
& we lost Grenn
1291	tmug	2014-06-08	I wish they would have tied up on HOW they defended the Wall and Castle Black... God damn every scene there were crows getting slaughtered then Ygritte dies then Tormund is surrounded by like 10 crows, game over Wildlings/Thenns.
Â 
The build up made it seem Castle Black was going down then 10 crows come down and everything is all good.
Â 
I was 100% sure that Stannis would be arriving in some form, ala Tywin in Blackwater... thats why the end was like 'huh?!'
Â 
Anyone else feel like this?
Â 
Â
1292	Talbot	2014-06-08	Stable? errr.Â 


You're making a scene here - you really need to calm down.
1293	The Drunkard	2014-06-08	That's pretty much the exact same thing that happens in the book. Â 


Â 
Mance made his position clear, though, that neither he nor his people would be bending the knee to a southern king or obeying their laws. An agreement didn't seem likely to be reached at all.
1294	Blutrabe	2014-06-08	The episode didn't show one scene and suddenly it's the worst show on television.
1295	Cas Stark	2014-06-08	How are they possibly going to conclude all the plots in the 45 minutes of show they're doing this year?
1296	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Yeah, the Ygritte death grief recovery time for Jon was not smooth.
Â 
Did Ghost attack one of those mammoth Snuffleupagus lookalikes? That would be interesting.
Â 
I missed stuff tonight. Between my dog being a pain, love him, but a pain, and trying to explain book stuff and what was going on to my non-reader husband, forget it. I missed Grenn, Alliser, and other stuff the first time.
1297	Justin Danford	2014-06-08	The wall should have been under siege for 2 episodes now, with battles and skirmishes happening in staggered segments, alongside the other story-lines (cut ridiculous grey worm love story for time). Ep 9 should have been a final night raid followed by Johns visit to Mance ending with Stannis and his saving attack.
That would have been a powerful episode.
Now we're supposed to wrap up the rest of book 3 in 66mins? How? If they cut LS im out. The show is fun but you can't cut LS. I don't think they will but I'm much less confident now with all they need to cram in.
1298	E-Ro	2014-06-08	You're making a scene here - you really need to calm down.

I though it was 10 mins more. Even if it is 15, too many loose end to tie. How are they going manage it. And I thought I saw a scene with Jamie and Cersie in next week's preview. How much can they show of Stannis. one thing's sure, no LC election this season
1300	The Red Melli	2014-06-08	So ... why was Ghost locked up all this time?Â
1301	of man and wolf	2014-06-08	Â 
Â 
Why didn't they have Ghost out as soon as the Wildlings came inside, or earlier? Â And why isn't Jon taking him along on his mission to kill Mance?


He better. I was thinking that as well. Ghost should be by his side.
1302	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	Agreed about the battle. Stannis's arrival will probably seem not so special anymore. For TV viewers the way this episode ended felt like the Wildlings had lost. The Wall is already saved.
1303	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	How are they possibly going to conclude all the plots in the 45 minutes of show they're doing this year?

The finale will be 65 minutes

Â 
I agree other things made up for it; I am happy Sam got some happiness for one. Sad that they killed off other characters, next week should be quite awesome I hope since this one was so short.
1305	Zman1863	2014-06-08	There's no way they can fit Jon's election into the next episode with everything else that has to happen, especially if were getting an off book Jaime/Cersei sex scene as the preview seemed to hint.Â
1306	Talbot	2014-06-08	So ... why was Ghost locked up all this time?Â 


Alliser had him chained when they returned from Crasters
1307	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-08	Yes, we know Stannis gets there next week.
Â 
AFTER THE BATTLE.
Â 
"Oh, the watch was fighting and dying and Stannis just arrived? Fuck him".
Â 
That's the impression it will get.
Â 
D&D, Ok, we got the indirect pretty clear: you hate Stannis.


Â This
Â 
The people saying "calm your tits" are just as bad as the extremists.
Â 
It's pretty damn logical to conclude that his 'big moment' (turning point for his character) will be degraded. The finale has too many exciting/climatic scenes and "stannis stannis STANNIS" won't even make the top 3.
1308	NightStark	2014-06-08	Â 
Mance made his position clear, though, that neither he nor his people would be bending the knee to a southern king or obeying their laws. An agreement didn't seem likely to be reached at all.


Â 
I think Mance's line in the preview 'I'm going to kill every man at Castle Black' demonstrates that no agreement has been made in the show either.

1310	Gladiator of Dorne	2014-06-08	Also, confirmed D&D are going to make it look like the Night's Watch did all the work and Stannis showed up to take all the glory.
Â 
Really close to dropping the show after this season. Stannis is all we have to go with cardboard (in terms to the actors) Jon Snow and blank-expression Dany, and if the added scenes are any indication of what we're going to get once D&D take over material after passing up the books... it's not going to be pretty.
Â 
Again, missed opportunity to deliver Stannis's finest moment. I watch the show with my father and he thinks Stannis is a shit commander who got his ass kicked at the Blackwater and that's it. Was so excited for tonight for him to see why I love the character... and then we get the credits six minutes early.

Â 
Stanis, playing the role of Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film.Â  Bullshit.Â  I waited for the entire episode for Stanis to save it all.Â  Still don't like the guy, but come the fuck on D&D!!!Â  Show him some respect.
1314	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-08	The dragons at the end o the promo looking mad scary
1315	Clayton_Suggs	2014-06-08	Stannis is one of my favorite characters, but I don't see how he could have appeared in this episode without rushing the battle. That doesn't mean the cliffhanger didn't suck though.
Â 
That said, I wasn't thrilled with the episode. Season 4 hasn't spent much time developing the Night's Watch and the scenes that did take place at the Wall were a mixed bag. I don't see how casual show watchers would care about Pyp and Grenn dying; why couldn't the showrunners have developed some of Jon's buddies instead of pointless Sam/Gilly scenes? Ygritte did noting but massacre people this season and all of her best material happened last season. Her death was ok, but I didn't like that Jon abandoned the battle to cradle her dead body. He's a professional, isn't he? Not some schoolboy. Ygritte's death should have been in the aftermath of the battle.
Â 
Blackwater was the culmination of narratives that had been building for the whole season; the Watchers on the Wall did not have the same momentum. The execution was fine, but we can see great battle scenes in any episode. My favorite parts of the episode came before the battle started. Jon/Sam, Sam/Aemon and Sam/Gilly were well-acted and written. Overall, an ok episode, but based on how the Night's Watch has been handled this season, I was expecting worse.
Â 
I'd be fine with the battle continuing next episode if not for the fact that there are so many storylines to wrap up. It's going to feel overcrowded. The pacing this season has been off and I'm afraid that in episode 10, important events won't get their proper attention. Oh well, at least it wasn't terrible.
1316	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	Â 
Mance made his position clear, though, that neither he nor his people would be bending the knee to a southern king or obeying their laws. An agreement didn't seem likely to be reached at all.


They were just beginning a possible negotiation when Stannis showed up. Â That was the whole "are you a true king" thing was all about. Â If Mance wasn't going to bend the knee and wasn't going to stop attacking the wall, would he have been able to control his people south of the wall. Â Then boom, Stannis attacks. Â Which is exactly what that poster described so it's weird that he's all butthurt that the show might turn out to be pretty true to the actual scene. Â

Most likely they won't have that this season. It will be next season. Part of his arc or something like that.

1322	Haldebrandt	2014-06-08	As insufferable as the Stannis fanatics are, I feel their pain. Â 
Â 
Even if next week the show managed to recreate the sort of tension that would have made his arrival rewarding, the explosion of anger online means that the moment already will have been spoiled for millions of viewers. Â A shame.
Â 
What an odd choice.
1323	go joff go	2014-06-08	Honestly the people on this site are doing a really good job of making everyone else hate stannis. It's pretty obvious there isn't enough time for Jon to meet with mance and for stannis to show up.  They couldn't wrap that up in the 7 or 8 minutes hbo would give them.  Hbo only lets shows go overtime in finales.

Oh definitely, I really did like the episode but I do have some legitimate (legitimate) qualms about it. What you mentioned and Ghost were some of my favorite things and Jon did well overall.  However, having an anticlimactic ending and a so so Ygritte death scene took away from the episode.
1326	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-08	Who's Stannis again?

Â 
Anyone who says that is an idiot.Â  For me, the end cliffhanger was just one of several reasons I felt underwhelmed by the episode.Â 
Â 


Yeah, the Ygritte death grief recovery time for Jon was not smooth.


Â 
Â 
I don't think he was recovered at all.Â  To me it felt like Jon was going on a suicide mission because he was so grief-stricken

Sadly, I would not be surprised if Stannis gets 4 minutes tops next week. And LSâ<U+0080>¦well, it better happen. I have non-reader peeps that are going to flip the hell out over the LS thing. And I am dying to see how she looks.
1329	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I knew it. Stannis is the ultimate villain in the eyes of D&D. Gods they hate him.Stannis isn't the ultimate villain, but he isn't the ultimate hero, either. The battle for the Wall has nothing to do with Stannis even in the books...Stannis only comes in after the battle is over and the Wildlings have won, just like it did here. They needed to focus more on Jon Snow and the rest of the Watch, because if they didn't, they wouldn't be able to convince the audience that Jon's going to be the next LC. Having Stannis come in at the end of this episode would steal that moment from Jon, whose character needs it more than Stannis. Stannis will have HIS moment next week, and it will be awesome. People need to get a fucking grip already and stop bitching about something that they WILL get to see.
1330	DominusNovus	2014-06-08	Why do they keep on doing shortened episodes (been a problem all season) if they're going to make the final episode run long? Â So dumb.

Â 
This episode you could feel people feeling for the watch, actually caring about them. As far as watchers know, it's over. The climax of the scene is gone and done. Next week is Stannis arriving AFTER the real mess is over too. It's not about "but it happens in book in this way!". In BOOK works. In TV, it doesn't work. It's a different media. They change things to the point to kill people who is still alive in the books (because cheap bastards, don't want to pay the actors next year), and they can't simply moves things a bi t so they can fit Stannis's arrival to THIS episode who only last around 50minutes?
Â 
I said nothing. I said to myself "ok, let's not overreact: HBO will make up for everything in ep. 9". And they simply didn't even include stannis in the episode.
1339	Crimson Viper	2014-06-08	Given the pacing of tonight's episode, I bet Tywin makes it into next season. That sucks!
1340	Fool of a Book	2014-06-08	99% of comments in the TV threads are whining about a change from the books. Â D&D did NOT change the sequence from the books for this episode... Stannis shows up later, after the first attack on the Wall, when Jon has gone to parlay with Mance. Â Now 99% of the comments about this episode are whining that D&D followed the books?
Â 
I thought it was an excellent episode. Â I particularly liked Aemon's chat with Sam, Slynt being a wussy, seeing Ghost again, and Ollie's little nod at Jon after he killed the woman who killed his father.
Â 
Sheesh let Jon have his moment, just like in the books. Â Stannis will get his later, just like in the books.

Ridiculous. Â anyone paying any attention knows the wildlings still have the upperhand x1000. Â they were just scoping things out like Jon said. Â Stannis will still save the day. Â Almost seems like some stuff may be pushed into next season though. Â Tyrion/Tywin possibly??
1343	Dubbs	2014-06-08	Only complaint is that Grenn died, really. The battle felt short, but there's no way to give it the long feel the books had in a single episode.

Why are all the Stans freaking out? He doesn't come until Jon goes to meet them outside the wall.
1344	Stormborn36	2014-06-08	God damn, you guys are TOUGH. That was a fucking phenomenal episode. The next one will be absolutely amazing and the Stannis arrival will be even more epic. Settle down you Stannis dick riders. With Stannis saving the day, Tyrion's escape/rampage, dragon rampage, Sandor's "death"/Arya's journey, Bllodraven/children of the forest, and hopefully Lady Stoneheart, next episode will be mind blowing to everyone.
1345	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Also, confirmed D&D are going to make it look like the Night's Watch did all the work and Stannis showed up to take all the glory.Uh, they did, even in the books. Stannis wouldn't have had a realm to save if the Night's Watch hadn't fought for days on end to keep the Wildlings from breaking the gate. Or did you miss those 3 chapters in the book?This isn't and never was "The Stannis Show".

Sweets have you read the books? not spoiling but well he is not going to kill anyone.


Â 
I know that Jon isn't going to kill Mance; but right now that's what he's trying to do, penetrate a force of perhaps hundreds of Wildlings and kill their leader. Â It might help to have a silent, super-large wolf come along as backup. Â I don't know why Jon didn't think of it.Â
1347	Dubbs	2014-06-08	Given the pacing of tonight's episode, I bet Tywin makes it into next season. That sucks!


Â 
I think it will be next week. The fact that it's on father's day is too good to pass up.
1348	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-08	WHY DID THEY HAVE TO GO AND KILL PIP AND GRENN?! 
Â 
Saddest change from the book ever.Â 


Â 
At least Grenn went out heroically.
1349	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Â 
Anyone who says that is an idiot.Â  For me, the end cliffhanger was just one of several reasons I felt underwhelmed by the episode.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
I don't think he was recovered at all.Â  To me it felt like Jon was going on a suicide mission because he was so grief-stricken


Â 
Â 
Ahâ<U+0080>¦like some others said too, it didn't sit right with me. The Jon Ygritte felt a bit, er, awkward and he walked out later with Sam and I felt a crickets chirping moment.
Â 
Could be me though.
Â 
But I love your avatar. Forza Azzurri!
Â 
We have a big weekend coming up. LOL! Italia on Saturdayâ<U+0080>¦.GOT on Sunday.
1350	jobmartell	2014-06-08	They were just beginning a possible negotiation when Stannis showed up. Â That was the whole "are you a true king" thing was all about. Â If Mance wasn't going to bend the knee and wasn't going to stop attacking the wall, would he have been able to control his people south of the wall. Â Then boom, Stannis attacks. Â Which is exactly what that poster described so it's weird that he's all butthurt that the show might turn out to be pretty true to the actual scene.

Butthurt. Perfect.
1351	NightStark	2014-06-08	Â 
Ridiculous. Â anyone paying any attention knows the wildlings still have the upperhand x1000. Â they were just scoping things out like Jon said. Â Stannis will still save the day. Â Almost seems like some stuff may be pushed into next season though. Â Tyrion/Tywin possibly??


Â 
Exactly..as Jon said..they will hit them again tomorrow night.
Â 
Tywin definitely gets it this season.
1352	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	I loved it when Maester Aemon reminisced about his lost love.  Made me think of "Egg, I dreamed I was old" - one of the best lines in all the books.
1353	MoIaF	2014-06-08	I just assumed they would allow more than 51 min. for this episodeI was surprised to the the 51 min., but even as the episode closed I thought the whole story could have been packed in... what happened to the extra time promised before, was it season 3?Ep 10 is going to be jam packed, apparently with a VFX budget bigger than this episode.

Exactly had they added the additional time they'll be using in the last episode (65 min) to end this episode properly it would have been an excellent episode. I think it is legitimate most poster have a legitimate complaint about the abruptness of the ending and the lack of Stannis.
1354	Lord Carson	2014-06-08	Does this forum have an ignore or block feature? I would really like to not have to see the Stannis fanatics whining all week.
1355	booknerd2	2014-06-08	Yeah, how come we only saw Ghost take one wildling down?


Â 
Yeah, I know. I feel embarrassed for Ghost. LOL! He totally took down more than that.
1356	Zman1863	2014-06-08	Looking at how this is probably going to go now, I think it could be a good thing that Jon's election, and Stannis's offer to Jon will come at the beginning of Season 5. That's fairly consequential material. It also means that Jon's tenure as LC will have that much less time to have fill up to bridge to how his Season 5 arc will end. It might come out feeling more tightly plotted than it otherwise might be.Â
1357	Simon Steele	2014-06-08	99% of comments in the TV threads are whining about a change from the books. Â D&D did NOT change the sequence from the books for this episode... Stannis shows up later, after the first attack on the Wall, when Jon has gone to parlay with Mance. Â Now 99% of the comments about this episode are whining that D&D followed the books?
Â 
I thought it was an excellent episode. Â I particularly liked Aemon's chat with Sam, Slynt being a wussy, seeing Ghost again, and Ollie's little nod at Jon after he killed the woman who killed his father.
Â 
Sheesh let Jon have his moment, just like in the books. Â Stannis will get his later, just like in the books.


Â 
Was Jon's moment when he was like "we're fooked, I'm going to go give up and talk to Mance and kill him without a sword because we're sooooo fooked"?
1358	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	People defending the episode are saying the battle would have had to be rushed. The episode was like 45 minutes long and the actual battle didn't start until halfway thru it. But I'm sure multiple Gilly scenes, Jon and Sam and Aemon talking about love and just the overall preparation took a large portion of the episode. 
Maybe if they spared us a good 15-20 minutes of Grey Worm/Missandei and Tyrion talking about the beetle crushing moron they could have for in 15 minutes of preparation at the Wall that took up so much of the episode.
1359	espec22	2014-06-08	They didnt have Stannis because then is going to be same plot as Blackwater.
1360	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	Stannis is getting played down because with all the huge stuff happening next week no one is even going to give a shit about the fight at the wall. As far as tv watchers are concerned the battle is over and won, the wildlings lost.Â I gave up all hope. 
Probably Jon Snow will be almost reaching an understanding with Mance when Stannis heavy cavalry shows up and starts killing women and children like some sort of Wonded Knee, while Jon screams "Noooo!"

Â 
I don't understand the complaints over scope, though. I thought this battle looked much more impressive than Blackwater. Sure, complain about the narrative all you want, but this was some phenomenal looking television -- visually.

1364	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	Great performance, Ser Alliser!
1365	Alia Atreides	2014-06-08	Oh definitely, I really did like the episode but I do have some legitimate (legitimate) qualms about it. What you mentioned and Ghost were some of my favorite things and Jon did well overall. However, having an anticlimactic ending and a so so Ygritte death scene took away from the episode.


Â 
I agree I wish they would of squeezed in Stannis and Pip dying did not sit well with me at all.Â
1366	The Kim in the North	2014-06-08	Too bad the extar 15 min will probably be spent on something similar to Greyworm and Missandei romance or a speech about beetles.Â
1367	Darth Pipes	2014-06-08	In fairness, I would point out that the end of this episode does stay true to the book in the fact that Stannis doesn't arrive after the hold Castle Black initially.Â  The Night's Watch held and the Wildlings regrouped.Â  It was the next day or so that Jon was sent (against his will) to treat with Mance.Â  So Stannis not showing up at this point is true to the books.
Â 
I think Stannis will show up on this show to route the Wildings once and for all.Â  But D and D (and Bryan Cogman do) do notÂ deserve the benefit of the doubt where the Stannis character is involved. They clearly hate the character and have done their best to undercut him.Â  The fact that it's Melisandre who made the decision to go to Castle Black in the first place is proof of that.
1368	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	From my previous post, I mean the Grey Worm subplot and Tyrion's story could have been cut last week to spread out the Battle at the Wall storyline.

1370	Chebyshov	2014-06-08	I think I'm going to duck out until the vitriol settles down. I'm hardly a Stannis fan, but he got shafted. His moment will have lost its effectiveness and be overshadowed by next week's shocks. Not to mention, we were given an incomplete narrative tonight, with the second half of it shoved into an already crammed episode next week. Maybe they can pull it off, but people gleefully calling Stannis fans "butt-hurt" are ignoring some glaring issues.
1371	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	You know what? Fuck everybody saying "chill out", "you're butthurt... uhhh".
Â 
This episode you could feel people feeling for the watch, actually caring about them. As far as watchers know, it's over. The climax of the scene is gone and done. Next week is Stannis arriving AFTER the real mess is over too. It's not about "but it happens in book in this way!". In BOOK works. In TV, it doesn't work. It's a different media. They change things to the point to kill people who is still alive in the books (because cheap bastards, don't want to pay the actors next year), and they can't simply moves things a bi t so they can fit Stannis's arrival to THIS episode who only last around 50minutes?
Â 
I said nothing. I said to myself "ok, let's not overreact: HBO will make up for everything in ep. 9". And they simply didn't even include stannis in the episode.


Â 
We can't say this until we have seen episode 10. Â Plenty of episodes have picked up directly from a cliffhanger from previous and maintained the dramatic impact. Â Remember Ned's execution leading to the shot of a bloody Ice? Â Or Joffrey's death leading into the chaotic scene in S4E3? Â Let's just wait and see how they handle the next attack.
1372	jbob	2014-06-08	Exactly had they added the additional time they'll be using in the last episode (65 min) to end this episode properly it would have been an excellent episode.

Â 
But then people would complain that that isn't enough time and needed to be longer. In fact, on other forums I saw people start to complain that there needs to be more than 10 minutes of Stannis and how disappointing that would be.
1373	HazelPhoenixFire	2014-06-08	Really disappointed. There were a couple of "oh cool" moments but beyond that. We lost Grenn & Pyp, Alliser was somehow supercool dude and Ygritte felt kind of forced. Somehow the circumstances in the books - finding her without knowing who'd shot the arrow and all that - seemed more appropriately tragic. I know it's only an adaptation but jeez. And then no Stannis at the end. Quite frankly I'd say this is one of the poorer episodes this season, and Blackwater knocks it out of the park by a long shot.

Agree.
1374	DarkerStar	2014-06-08	I gave up all hope.
Probably Jon Snow will be almost reaching an understanding with Mance when Stannis heavy cavalry shows up and starts killing women and children like some sort of Wonded Knee, while Jon screams "Noooo!"


I want this to happen just to read the comments
1375	SeanStark	2014-06-08	Have to conclude that this episode was quite underwhelming. Now don't get me wrong the battle itself was pretty damn good and I was enjoying it loads but to finish it with Jon just walking out like that and no Stannis was disappointing.
Â 
The main part of the Battle at the Wall, I had been looking forward to was Stannis arrival and how D & D portrayed it on screen, Now I just feel like, even though we know it's going to happen next week, it won't quite have the same impact due to Tyrion killing Tywin, Bran meeting Bloodraven and hopefully, although I'm not holding my breath at this point, the arrival of Lady Stoneheart. I think they could have done so much more to this episode considering the money they spent on it.
Â 
However on the flip side, I suppose when we think of it now, the Finale is going to be jam packed with a tonne of major WTF moments, here's hoping they have captured it right.Â
1376	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Does this forum have an ignore or block feature? I would really like to not have to see the Stannis fanatics whining all week.

how is anyone whining when all people are wanting is the climax we were waiting for from the books. its easy to ignore people but well you ignore to many of us you might miss GOOD things we may say one day
1379	Howdyphillip	2014-06-08	The one thought that kept going through my mind this episode was that Neil Marshall has probably heard so many people whining about no chain in Blackwater, that he made damn sure he pit a chain in this episode. I really felt like this was a loving wink.Â 
Â 
Â Overall, this was a really solid episode with strong performances throughout. The only complaint that I have is that the scale of this battle just didn't seem to be captured. I wanted to see more giants, mammoths and wildlings. Oh well, the budget is what it is.

Â 
Â 
whoopsÂ
1389	Clayton_Suggs	2014-06-08	Was anyone else annoyed that Jon abandoned the battle to cradle a dying Ygritte in his arms? Definitely not Lord Commander behavior. He could have saved one of his brothers in that time. Why couldn't their tearful goodbyes have happened a couple of minutes later after the battle was over? Why did the kid have to kill her instead of a random arrow? Seemed far to convenient.
Â 
At this rate, folks who haven't read the books will have no reason to think that Jon deserves to be LC. They'll probably accept it because he's a main character, but isn't Game of Thrones supposed to better than relying on TV tropes? Thorne seemed quite competent in this episode. Why should the brothers of the Night's Watch pick Jon over him? Other than that he's young, good looking and the main character.
Â 
From a dramatic standpoint, Stannis should have showed up, but from a narrative standpoint it wouldn't have made sense. The only way it could have worked is if parts of the battle (like the initial raid) had happened in prior episodes, which would have been a better choice. I've had serious problems with pacing in this season, as well as the effect many of the show-only scenes have had on the narrative. They could have taken out the pointless Craster's Keep sequence and spent more time on the lead-up to the battle, perhaps even had Ygritte's death occur in an earlier episode.
Â 
At its best, this season has still been great, but based on how the writers have struggled to weave together a narrative/prioritize in a way that makes sense even with ample book material to draw on, I"m having serious doubts about next season when they'll have to make up even more material and pull of some extreme narrative gymnastics in order for the timeline to make sense.Â

Exactly. Also wasting time with Gilly arc. Send her away to bring her back just to talk about something everyone knows. Sam likes her. We get it.
Fill those ridiculous fanfic segments with happenings on the wall. Have the Wall besieged by Mance in ep 7, put it on the backburner, show us some Lord Snow atop the wall, then in ep 9, have the Thenns finally attack the south-side while Mance full presses the North side. Have that be the first 35mins of ep 9. Have the last 16 mins be the Mance moot culminating in a heroic Stannis appearance.
That is the pacing you get in the books. That should have been the pacing we got here. Not cliche love talk and cliche sword play. Fun to watch but GoT is much much more.

1391	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	I'm so confused about why the fanatics are worried that Stannis will have lost his moment. Â If anything, the show went out of it's way to set up Stannis being some hero. Â They set up Jon looking as the hero of battle numero uno who talks to other heros of the battle about how they are totally fucked because Mance still so greatly outnumbers them, then our hero Jon goes off into the sunset to meet with Mance without wolf or weapon totally thinking he's going to die and he'll be surrounded by giants and mammoths and 100k wildlings and it will look impressively sinister for Jon until suddenly, this dude comes out of the trees and saves the fucking day. Â That's a better set up for Stannis in the books because this time, Jon volunteered rather than where he was forced to do it in the books. Â He's walking out there like a boss and if the negotiation doesn't go well, he's dead. Â Of course, Jon may likely be negotiating with Mance, like he was in the books, when Stannis shows up, but still...come on. Â How much more of a "stannis saves the day" set up do you fanatics need? Â Get a grip. Â

1400	HazelPhoenixFire	2014-06-08	Imagine how much more powerful it would have been if it had happened like seven episodes ago, like it should have. Not after spending an entire season barely even seeing Ygritte and Jon Snow barely ever talking about her.

They deviated heavily from the source this season and it unfortunately it's not working.
1401	Grayven	2014-06-08	I have never agreed with the idea that the show was somehow biased towards Stannis. Â I never really cared for him in the books, and actually notice and like him more in the show (due to Dillane) than I ever did while reading. Â So the endless and repetitive focus on 'how did this or that affect Stannis' and 'you should have cut X for more Stannis' has been a net negative for me while reading some of these threads.Â 
Â 
Having made that complete and honest acknowledgement of my own biases.. I will say that Stannis fans got totally hosed by the pacing of the events of this episode. Â If you're going to devote an entire show to one battle.. show the whole freakin' battle. Â There's way too much happening next week to toss in a 'by the way, here's how it ended' and expect anyone to really care.

It's happening next episode... my only hope is that the final scene, going in the pattern they've had since Season 1 in the finales (Fire, Ice, Fire) is Stannis turning the tide at the Wall is the final scene of the season.
Â 
What we'll likely get instead of Stannis showing up after the majority of the fighting is over, claiming all the credit, and the Children of the Forest/Bloodraven to close out the season.

Â Of course, Jon may likely be negotiating with Mance, like he was in the books, when Stannis shows up, but still...come on. Â How much more of a "stannis saves the day" set up do you fanatics need? Â Get a grip. Â 


I love you though brah brah. I will stop cuz i don't wanna beef with you.Â

Outstanding.
1407	Iron Maiden Islands	2014-06-08	Did anyone else notice that Jon used Karl Tanner's spit move in the fight against Styr?

Yeah, shows Jon is learning haha
1408	rmholt	2014-06-08	The Stan-stans are as usual are quite hilarious. Never change guys.

I'm a big Stannis fan & don't think it was quite time for him. They stumbled through the battle, though. Did like the giants. Felt like a missed opportunity. I've watched BW several times - & not done - I don't think this was even close but will give it a second try. DRUMMMMMS!!!!!
1409	Crimson Viper	2014-06-08	When Ghost first attacked it looked like someone threw a stuffed animal across the screen.
1410	kgreat1	2014-06-08	The episode was fine, but it was probably the worst of the season so far. Â That's not a burn on this episode the rest of this season has just been great. Â The fade to white at the end as Jon walks out to negotiate with Mance was a dumb ending. Â I could have done with way less of the pregame (Sam/Gilly, etc.). Â They could have extended the run time a little longer to show the morning where Jon is negotiating and Stannis shows up to save the day. Â Maybe I just had this episode too hyped up in my mind, but I thought they could have done a lot better. Â They had to kill off Grenn, because they hadn't established enough characters at the wall. Â The episode was fine, but it definitely could have been done better.

I said somewhere that Stannis must die early in the next book. Â What other excuse can there be for the way the show totally downplays that story?


He's gonna get flayed.Â
1412	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-08	I thought they were going to change it up so that Mance sends a 2nd wave, captures grieving Jon to bring him back and end on a cliffhanger with a Jon/Mance staredown and the Wall just about to be breached.
Â 
Either way I wasn't expecting Stanners
1413	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	That WAS the largest fire the north has ever seen.
1414	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Mother fuck a Stannis Baratheon. How badass was Jon fucking Snow??
You insane Stannis cult members will have your fun next week. Chill the fuck out lunatics.


Don't need advice from D&D lunatics. Cheers.
1415	JonInVa	2014-06-08	GIANTS RIDING MAMMOTHS, Tormund Giantsbane fighting Alliser Thorne in single combat, giants shooting gigantic arrows at people..... but the episode was the worst because King Stannis doesn't arrive until next week? lmao

Thorne was a badass in this show. The way Jon Snow keeps getting disarmed in all his major fights, it's clear that Thorne is definitely the best swordsman at the Wall.
1416	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	Â 
/fit time
Â 
TARGS ARE NOT FUCKING FIREPROOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Â 
/fit over
Â 
Yeah, I know that show watchers probably think they are.


I didn't think they were suggesting that Jon is suddenly fireproof, especially after he burned his hand. Â I mean, they went out of their way to make dany fireproof, but that's not actually how it works. Â However, the scene was just a cute little wink. Â Just more Jon fire connection. Â
1417	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-06-08	Its only unfortunately for the bookreaders which will never outnumber the mainstreamer tv viewers. So all is well my friends. GOT will live on lol.
1418	NikkiG	2014-06-08	So in espisode 10, we have Arya & Hound, Cersie and Jamie, Tyrion escape, possible end of Tywin, Bran and company, Brienne (still has to bite someone's ear of)f, and the end to the battle at the wall.Â  Even with extra time I am not sure how they can fit all this in and have the plotlines be clear
1419	rmholt	2014-06-08	Kudos for opening with the closest thing to a guy-oriented sex scene even at the Wall.
1420	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	I was expecting Maester Aemon say the girl he remembered was Olenna
1421	Darth Pipes	2014-06-08	I have a feeling that Lady Stoneheart is gonna be an opening scene for season 5.......


Â 
I suspect you're right.Â  There's too much to pack into next week's episode without Lady Stoneheart.Â  I think the season will end with Dany's dragons being chained up.
1422	MR92	2014-06-08	I didn't think they were suggesting that Jon is suddenly fireproof, especially after he burned his hand.

yeah def not a suggestion that hes a Targ... I Do think that the GhostCam was a little foreshadowing of Jons abilities to warg Ghost. Â I believe its the first weve seen through Ghosts eyes
1423	boojam	2014-06-08	Yeah, I know. I feel embarrassed for Ghost. LOL! He totally took down more than that.The VFX budget me thinks.

Beef away, brahster. Â
1425	MoIaF	2014-06-08	But then people would complain that that isn't enough time and needed to be longer. In fact, on other forums I saw people start to complain that there needs to be more than 10 minutes of Stannis and how disappointing that would be.

It more about having a complete and overall finished episode.  The anticlimactic ending could have been easily resolved by having the Stannis storyline in the epidote. People might have complained about there not being enough Stannis, however, I personally would have been satisfied that they had an overall complete story for the episode. Now, Stannis will come next week and I'm sure it'll be fine but it won't have the emotional appeal it could have had had it been done this episode.  There will be a lot of things going on in the finale and this will just be one amongst many.
1426	Steven P.	2014-06-08	I think the progress in Sam and Gilly's relationship somewhat ruins the surprise of their relationship later, on the ship to Oldtown...
1427	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	I'm so confused about why the fanatics are worried that Stannis will have lost his moment. Â If anything, the show went out of it's way to set up Stannis being some hero. Â They set up Jon looking as the hero of battle numero uno who talks to other heros of the battle about how they are totally fucked because Mance still so greatly outnumbers them, then our hero Jon goes off into the sunset to meet with Mance without wolf or weapon totally thinking he's going to die and he'll be surrounded by giants and mammoths and 100k wildlings and it will look impressively sinister for Jon until suddenly, this dude comes out of the trees and saves the fucking day. Â That's a better set up for Stannis in the books because this time, Jon volunteered rather than where he was forced to do it in the books. Â He's walking out there like a boss and if the negotiation doesn't go well, he's dead. Â Of course, Jon may likely be negotiating with Mance, like he was in the books, when Stannis shows up, but still...come on. Â How much more of a "stannis saves the day" set up do you fanatics need? Â Get a grip. Â This is going to be the episode where Tyron kills his father and kills Shae. Where he tells Jaime he killed Joff. This is going to be the episode where Bran meets Blood Raven. Probably LSH will pop out, and Daenerys will drop some dumb lines while stearing at stuff. Thats "the day" Stannis is going to save ? It has nothing to do with it.
1428	E-Ro	2014-06-08	Don't need advice from D&D lunatics. Cheers.


they dont like him because hes baldÂ
1429	Salad Days Saan	2014-06-08	This episode establishes that Jon is the real leader of the watch, stepping up when Thorne is knocked out of action and Slynt cowers.Â  He delegates like a leader, too.Â  To Sam, To Grenn, To Edd.Â  And they all give him that look when he does it.Â  They're recognizing HE'S THE MAN.Â  And behind him they rally and win.
Â 
[BTW, "Edd, the wall is yours."Â  AWESOMESAUCE.Â  WHO WOULD BE A TERRIBLE LORD COMMANDER NOW?Â  Handled yourself pretty damn well there, actually.Â  Loved it.]
Â 
Next week when he's off being Willard to Mance's Kurtz (or trying to, anyway), we'll see the crows get their ass kicked in his absence while Thorne is still incapacitated and Slynt comes up small once again.
Â 
Stannis saves the crows from certain doom without undercutting Jon as The Man To Lead The Crows.
Â 
Sucks that Stannis is going to get lost in the shuffle of next week's more ensemble show.Â  Would've been nice to see him in the main event spot, but 'tis not to be (Tyrion, with the Crotchbow, in the Bathroom has to be the big climax next week).

1432	MoIaF	2014-06-08	yes its like they are going to play it up that Jon has no one by his side on the Wall.

Of course and killing them both helps shorten that storyline for next year when Jon is LC. They have a lot to compact next season, Jon has 13 chapters they'll need to condense into one season as I'm almost sure they'll have the stabbing by the end of next season.
1433	Salad Days Saan	2014-06-08	Brienne is seriously running out of time and potential victims for Ear-Biting.Â  I am concerned.Â  Next week is gonna be crowded.

Oh god, I was terrified when I saw your previous post. I thought it was your way of chastising me indirectly.Â
1435	boojam	2014-06-08	They deviated heavily from the source this season and it unfortunately it's not working.You mean in like the number of GOT viewers is now more than for the Sopranos?
1436	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	This is going to be the episode where Tyron kills his father and kills Shae. Where he tells Jaime he killed Joff.

Ok, so you're saying that Stannis' only contribution to awesome is when he gobbles up screentime? Â Alrighty, then. Â I guess I see your point in that they've not made Stannis a suitable enough character to be able to own it in five minutes. Â
1437	BrettStark	2014-06-08	So in espisode 10, we have Arya & Hound, Cersie and Jamie, Tyrion escape, possible end of Tywin, Bran and company, Brienne (still has to bite someone's ear of)f, and the end to the battle at the wall.Â  Even with extra time I am not sure how they can fit all this in and have the plotlines be clear


Â 
Remember, next week's episode is extra long.Â
1438	Gladiator of Dorne	2014-06-08	No one complaining about the lack of Stannis (as far as I have read) has said a word about the battle being underwhelming on its own, though killing off two of the established and recognizable Wall characters isn't going to help any next season.
Â 
Our issue is more with the narrative and wasted time on other irrelevant issues. I'm a Stannis fan, though I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, and this episode should have been his moment by rights, as Episode 9 of Season 2 was Tywin's moment.
1439	Alia Atreides	2014-06-08	Of course and killing them both helps shorten that storyline for next year when Jon is LC. They have a lot to compact next season, Jon has 13 chapters they'll need to condense into one season as I'm almost sure they'll have the stabbing by the end of next season.

ahh yes wow then by the time we are in the 6th season I'm not going to wish to watch anymore it will of been caught up with the books.
1440	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	Â 
Remember, next week's episode is extra long.Â 


But it has so many other climaxes that Stannis' glorious moment will easily get over-shadowed. Dany upto some bs, Tyrion crossbowing and ofcourse LSH.Â

Agreed. I liked the Jon volunteering bit as well. And also this is Jon's moment to shine but as another poster said earlier they could have build this over a few episodes prior. (We really didn't need Missandei/Greyworm luv scenes and such pointless fillers.) And in this episode they could have ended the whole Wall story with Stannis riding in at the end. Too many things happening next week. It will be another episode where they hop from scene to scene and ultimately Stannis most rewarding scene in books will not have the impact it had in the books.
1442	averde	2014-06-08	That's pretty much the exact same thing that happens in the book. Â 


Theres a battle raging when Stannis arrives and its made pretty clear he just saved Castle Black from being overwhelmed in the books. In the show based on this episode and the preview for the next episode it looks like there won't be any fighting going on when Stannis arrives, just Jon and Mance about to team up and head out and all of a sudden Stannis arrives and genocides a bunch of now "good" wildlings.Â
1443	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-08	This episode and the preview for the next one locks in what I've said about TV Stannis since the beginning. He is one of the shows villians, he's not going to save the wall. Jon Snow will be negotiating with Mance about bringing the Wildlings across because the Others are coming and then boom Stannis heavy cavalry comes in and massacres a bunch of Wildlings. It's sad the show watchers are doing this with a character like Stannis but I am very confident in my analysis at this point.


Are you serious? Â The bloody preview has Mance blatantly saying he will massacre every Crow in Castle Black. Â

1446	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	Blah...can't go on about this episode any longer. Ill just hope for the best next week but D&D blew it with the storyline at the Wall over the course of the season. They had too much filler scenes that few viewers actually cared about and all that filler material? Leave it for the first and second seasons. SoS has so much crucial material that filler scenes should not be necessary. 
All the stuff from the first half of this episode could have been spread throughout the last two episodes. This episode should have started with the battle and ended with the parlay and Stannis's knights arriving. It was totally feasible and could have been done wonderfully but they didn't. 
Lost a bit of faith tonight...sadly.
1447	E-Ro	2014-06-08	You mean in like the number of GOT viewers is now more than for the Sopranos?


More viewers does not mean more quality. The sopranos was a once in a lifetime treat. This might have more viewers, but it is not better.Â
1448	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-06-08	to people saying that the episode sucks,
reeeaaalllly? i mean, come on. just because it didnt end how you pictured it doesnt make the whole thing terrible. i also wish that stannis would have shown up tonight, but i'm not devistated like so many of you are. d&d, who everyone just loves to hate on, probably have their reasons for putting it in ep 10. i could be wrong, but i dont think any of you have seen ep 10 yet, so how could you possibly know that this is as bad a decision as everyone thinks? it will probably open the episode. we will get a solid, long scene of jon with mance, then the battle. it's getting really irritating that i have to say this after what seems like every episode, but here we go.
WAIT FOR EVERYTHING TO PLAY OUT BEFORE YOU JUDGE THE ENTIRE SHOW.
1449	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	Oh god, I was terrified when I saw your previous post. I thought it was your way of chastising me indirectly.Â

Â 
E-RO, CALM DOWN BRAH. Â STANNIS IS GONNA SAVE JON, THE BOSS OF THE WATCH, AND OF COURSE THE REST OF THE WATCH, FROM DOOM AND GLOOM. Â HE'S ALSO GOING TO SINGLE-HANDEDLY TURN MANCE FROM HAVING THE UPPER HAND AND NEGOTIATING A PACT TO LEAD HIS OWN MEN SOUTH TO BEING FORCED TO BEND THE KNEE BECAUSE STANNIS JUST SAVED THE M-F'ING DAY.
Â 
Damn, I'm a douchebag for typing in caps. Â Now I feel bad for chastising. Â
1450	MoIaF	2014-06-08	ahh yes wow then by the time we are in the 6th season I'm not going to wish to watch anymore it will of been caught up with the books.

Oh really? I don't mind spoilers, I had scene the series before I read the books.  Doesn't bother me much. Honestly, I appreciate GRRM but he writes to slow and I really want to know what happens.
1451	teej6	2014-06-08	If they could only limit Dany and Mereen next week to 5 mins. Wishful thinking I know.
1452	The Red Haired Viper	2014-06-08	Clearly D + D hate Stannis. His big moment of the series is now going to be buried in an episode full of big moments.
1453	Perin Stone	2014-06-08	possible end of Tywin,


Â 
They show someone creeping with a crossbow up to a door. Â I think this will clearly be in the episode.
1454	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	If they could only limit Dany and Mereen next week to 5 mins. Wishful thinking I know.


Oh don't worry Dany will get full 10-15 mins. Stannis probs 2 mins if lucky.
1455	BrettStark	2014-06-08	Have to conclude that this episode was quite underwhelming. Now don't get me wrong the battle itself was pretty damn good and I was enjoying it loads but to finish it with Jon just walking out like that and no Stannis was disappointing.
Â 
The main part of the Battle at the Wall, I had been looking forward to was Stannis arrival and how D & D portrayed it on screen, Now I just feel like, even though we know it's going to happen next week, it won't quite have the same impact due to Tyrion killing Tywin, Bran meeting Bloodraven and hopefully, although I'm not holding my breath at this point, the arrival of Lady Stoneheart. I think they could have done so much more to this episode considering the money they spent on it.
Â 
However on the flip side, I suppose when we think of it now, the Finale is going to be jam packed with a tonne of major WTF moments, here's hoping they have captured it right.Â 


Â 
Stannis didn't arrive during this fight, lol... ugh people commmmon.,Â
1456	Fat Mac	2014-06-08	I'm not gonna complain about Stannis, though I could.

Â 
There's no battle when he arrives..who would they have been fighting..Jon goes alone in the books. He is treating with Mance and he hears a horn then Stannis crashes through.
1459	Zman1863	2014-06-08	I think the problems with the pacing of this episode and how it was left on a cliffhanger are partially due to the Craster detour. They could have done a bit more to set up with the time they had. But then, I'm sure the hordes of unsullied would have been complaining even more that nothing was happening.Â 
Â 
Perhaps they should have had Ygritte's band attack midseason instead of the Craster detour. Give Bran a couple more visions and maybe he finds Ghost and sends him home.Â

I said somewhere that Stannis must die early in the next book. Â What other excuse can there be for the way the show totally downplays that story?


Â 
I've felt all along that the reason Stannis is being somewhat downplayed in the show is that, in the long run, his character is not one of the important ones for the ending of the story arc.

Stannis brings the battle. However there is a cease fire between the NW and the Wildlings.

1464	Rockroi	2014-06-08	A great episode, though clearly Â1 a step behind the prior two â<U+0080><U+009C>Episode Ninesâ<U+0080><U+009D> (Blackwater; Red Wedding).Â  
Â 
What I liked:
Â 
The Battle of The Wall (in two parts): The episode continued the tradition of the Balckwater in giving the viewer a deep, personal and extremely raw look at a battle.Â  From the Giants to the wildings to Giantsbane to Ygritte to Jon to Grenn â<U+0080><U+0093> the episode told us the horror of this Battle and left us wanting for nothing â<U+0080>¦. (from the battle).Â  There was more than enough action, more than enough destruction and a great deal of plot and plotting so we can infer how horrible it has been for the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch â<U+0080><U+0093> even though they won.Â  I also loved how the episode gave us a glimpse at all these men and how they rose to the occasion (Grenn, Edd, Jon, Sam) and shrunk from it (Slynt).Â  There was a lot of character development and growth here. Â THe show did its best work in having two separate "fronts" - the Wall proper andÂ CastleÂ Black and integrating them together slowly and,Â whenÂ necessary, going back and forth. Â 
Â 
And even a note to the improvement of the fight scenes- yes there were still a few times I could see problems (there was one scene where I think its safe to say the action was way too slow and it LOOKED like they sped up the fim to make the action seem faster, which seems like poor craftsmanship to me).Â  But overall, this was a great action movie-episode with plenty to enjoy.Â  
Â 
Sam Tarly, Lord of the Wall: I get tagged with the â<U+0080><U+009C>book puristâ<U+0080><U+009D> label a bit, and I can live with that, but watching Sam Tarly grow from coward to capable man of the Watch is a dramatic and clear improvement over the books.Â  Sam is more a layered man than a scared child who cowers from everything.Â  The show has turned Sam FROM a sidekick and INTO a real, multi-dimensionalÂ Â character and it showed through from start to finish.Â  IN many ways, this was Sam TArlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s coming out Party, not John Snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>s.Â 
Â 
Â 
Alister Thorne; 100% Bad Ass: How great was that?Â  From telling great speeches, to calming the men by yelling at them, to fighting like he was the Hound + The Viper rolled together, Allister Thorne gave us the look at the cut of a man facing down his lifeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s purpose: this was not some outpost to civilization; this was not an Afterthought: Alister Thorne was at the Center of the Battle Between good and Evil and showed us that even complete assholes can rise to the occasion. Â Even his talk with Jon was half needle, half prep-session. Â He stayed true to himself AND true to what was going on around him to not be an ass-hat about it all. Â And that fight with Giantsbane?Â  Fucking styling shit there, huh? 
Â 
The Men of the Watch: Pyp, John, Grenn, Edd and Sam all had very meaningful roles and held them well.Â  Each one had only a handful of lines, but each one brought import and dimension to everything they did.Â  The writers did a tremendous job of giving each one enough to do and gave the audience enough time to interact with each one. Â 
Â 
Ygritte: They were true to her and she was true to the character; the show gave us the duality of Ygritte - both a strong-willed, wildling to the core, but also a very conflicted woman who, when it came time, was more conflicted than even she let on.Â While I thought the book did a better job of the ending (she dies â<U+0080><U+009C>off screenâ<U+0080><U+009D>), I think this telling as very true to form.Â 
Â 
On the Fence About 
Â 
First Time For Everything But Did You Have To Kill Everyone? I know its odd to have THIS complaint in AGoT, but the Wall is now DECIDEDLY... sparce... as of now. Â For starters, you killedÂ almostÂ everyone we knew and liked- only Edd, JOn and Sam escaped theÂ wrath of HBO- even Thorne's fate is up in the air. Â Pyp, Grenn, maybe Thorne - leaving JOn with PAINFULLY Few allies to... well... you know... vote.... And fewer still who we may beÂ interestedÂ in. Â KInd of leaving us with Sam and JOn and not much else. Â Though, I DID like that their deaths made that fight seem a HELL of a lot more horrifying. Â 
Â 
What I did not Like:
Â 
If You Are Going to Make The Season Ten Episodes, Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t Give us a 52 Minute Episode and a Shitty Cliffhanger: 
Â 
Did not Like the construction of the episode. Â It was too short and had far too much dead time.Â  
Â 
So, most cable series are 12-13 episodes; GoT is 10 and we should be luky to get that as its one of the most expensive series in the history of TV.Â  But, if you are going to give us 10 episodes, make then ten FULL episodes; donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give us shitty filler and donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t cut them off short; this episode did both.Â  For starters, there was a tremendous amount of dead-time in the episode; a very â<U+0080><U+009C>mehâ<U+0080><U+009D> discussion between Jon and Sam about Women (been there, done ALL of that); it then continues with a terrible, awful, totally unnecessary discussion between Sam and Maester Aemon (Still, technically, on the payroll) â<U+0080><U+0093> that discussion was 3 minutes, 30 seconds (Yes, went back and watched it).Â  It neither sets the stage for the upcoming battle nor builds up the tension; it is a completely wasted scene.Â  You then have the Gilly-Sam reunited Scene which wasâ<U+0080>¦ fineâ<U+0080>¦ but took 1:30 and then Sam locks her away, a few more minutes there.Â  We get more long shots of the wiildings and the scene with Ygritte et allâ<U+0080>¦ kinda redundant but I get it. 
Â 
All in all, the Battle does not actually start until 20 minutes in; it ends at around the 45 min mark with the capture of Giantsbane.Â  BY CONTRAST Blackwater has NO dead time- the battle starts at around the 12 minute mark and does not end until the final shot at the 53 min mark- a wall-to-wall episode of battle, tension, struggle and conflict.Â  Oh, and that conflict is resolvedâ<U+0080>¦. 
Â 
Here, we have plenty of filler and a lot of dead time which culminates inâ<U+0080>¦. oh, wait, noâ<U+0080>¦ itÂ didn'tÂ actually culminate in anything.Â  The episode ENDS at the 52 min mark, but nothing substantive happens AT ALL after GB is captured; we learn that GRenn died, but that wholeÂ thing could have been recut with Jon just in the tunnel; at Grenn when he starts talking.Â  You could have EASILY gotten to Mance within the confines of a legit episode.Â  And yes, you could have nabbed Stannis time too.
Â 
Instead?Â  We got aÂ long-windedÂ speech, a bullshit cliffhanger (which does NOT BODE WELL for the future of the show, mind you), zero closure and THE RESULT of the battle and its significance will be LOST - COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY LOST â<U+0080><U+0093>with the other events ofÂ next weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode
Â 

	Spoiler  Tyrion escapes, Tywin dies, Cat, possibly, returns 
 
Â 
IN OTHER WORDS, Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> gigantic rescue mission will be dulled-down and muted by the other events of the show.
Â 
Thanks again, D&D, for screwing the character, yet again.Â  
Â 
But EVEN IF that was not the caseâ<U+0080>¦ to end that onÂ a cliffhangerÂ like that is an insult to the viewers, most notably in the light of Blackwater and other battles where we KNOW what happens and can gain some level of satisfaction for ourÂ time and effort.Â  The show decided to leak that to the finale, which is â<U+0080>¦ fineâ<U+0080>¦ 
Â 
But it also makes me think that they are going to â<U+0080><U+009C>Water Downâ<U+0080><U+009D> the next season by extending Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s very redundant story-line into the next season and that will bore me to tears as well.Â  
Â 
All of that is a very long way of saying this: You could have done everything you needed to do in this episode and still have time to spare for Stannis and Mance if you ran a tighter ship.Â  Cut the fat, give us what we needed and wanted, tighten your focus, give us a few moreÂ minutesÂ on the back end and you could have done it all.Â  Instead? Wait Until Next Weekâ<U+0080>¦ Â Â 
Â 
And that â<U+0080>¦ bothers meâ<U+0080>¦. 
Â 
Overall, exceptional episode, one of the better ones of the series with much to discuss and enjoy.Â  But also, with a glaring flaw which has be concerned.Â

1465	axels15	2014-06-08	They didn't get as far as I thought they would in this episode...
Â 
Does this mean no Lady Stoneheart at the end of the final episode? I'll be so disappointed.
1466	E-Ro	2014-06-08	https://www.youtube....h?v=kdemFfbS5H0
Â 
I think thats the theme of next weeks episode.Â
1467	Alia Atreides	2014-06-08	Oh really? I don't mind spoilers, I had scene the series before I read the books. Doesn't bother me much. Honestly, I appreciate GRRM but he writes to slow and I really want to know what happens. 


Â 
it cuts both ways at least he doesn't churn out like a hack writer wanting to keep his audience but at the same time you want it NOW.
1468	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	Agreed. I liked the Jon volunteering bit as well. And also this is Jon's moment to shine but as another poster said earlier they could have build this over a few episodes prior. (We really didn't need Missandei/Greyworm luv scenes and such pointless fillers.) And in this episode they could have ended the whole Wall story with Stannis riding in at the end. Too many things happening next week. It will be another episode where they hop from scene to scene and ultimately Stannis most rewarding scene in books will not have the impact it had in the books.


I agree. Â I have felt underwhelmed with the entire watch arc all season. Â Mostly because they had to slow it down and add in the Craster filler in order for the rest of the arcs to catch up. Â I could have preferred Stannis showing up this episode, but I'm also glad that the timeline isn't so wonky when the season ends. Â 
Â 


Theres a battle raging when Stannis arrives and its made pretty clear he just saved Castle Black from being overwhelmed in the books. In the show based on this episode and the preview for the next episode it looks like there won't be any fighting going on when Stannis arrives, just Jon and Mance about to team up and head out and all of a sudden Stannis arrives and genocides a bunch of now "good" wildlings.Â 


What? Â There's no battle raging. Â Jon is parlaying with Mance at the moment. Â There's no battle at all going on until Stannis shows up.Â
1469	Cyril	2014-06-08	Oh don't worry Dany will get full 10-15 mins. Stannis probs 2 mins if lucky.


I don't see Dany needing even 10 minutes.Â  She should probably get two scenes (one of her learning about the child, the other with the caging).Â  I see 6-7.Â  Maybe 8, depending on how long the first scene takes.Â  Dany doesn't need a sweeping, slowed-down walk out of the cage where she chains her dragons to sad-yet-epic music.
1470	go joff go	2014-06-08	Absurd, The Watchers on the Wall blew Blackwater out of the... well water, as far as I'm concerned. Â This was one the best episodes of the series, but everybody is up in arms because of preconceived notions, as usual.it's so true. It's ls all over again from last year. Everyone convinced themselves something was going to happen, even though there ate perfectly legitimate logistical reasons it couldn't happen.  I feel bad for the show watchers since book readers are now deciding to retaliate by spoiling them.
1471	LyrnaSnowBunnyAvenger	2014-06-08	I didn't think they were suggesting that Jon is suddenly fireproof, especially after he burned his hand. Â I mean, they went out of their way to make dany fireproof, but that's not actually how it works. Â However, the scene was just a cute little wink. Â Just more Jon fire connection. Â 


Â 
Oh, it likely was just a cute wink of the eye which is why I ended fit.Â  I just tend to see red when I see any Targ=fireproof asbestos eating gods.Â  Rolling across fire in Jon's armor is not impressive.
1472	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	https://www.youtube....h?v=kdemFfbS5H0

They may just end up showing him riding in with his banners <U+00F0><U+009F><U+009E>
1476	Newstar	2014-06-08	Favourite part of the episode was Jon horrified at seeing Ygritte with an arrow sticking out of her and looking over to see Ollie nodding at him proudly, like "You're welcome." It was weirdly hilarious.
Â 
The sword fighting with Kit looked awesome.

					
					
							Edited by Newstar, 08 June 2014 - 09:54 PM.
1477	jobmartell	2014-06-08	Like someone mentioned, why is Stannis being downplayed? The episode didn't live up to the week long hype. Some cool CGI shit, but way too much soap opera filler. One funny part was the "wud up" look Ollie gave John after killing his girl. Priceless. Alot leading up to this episode could of been excluded to better reflect how epic this fight was. At one point the watch is fucked, then 6 guys and John show up and tormund is alone and surrounded.? Felt for sure we would at least get a glimpse of 'Stannis, stannis, stannis' in some way.
1478	E-Ro	2014-06-08	Oh man, I didn't mean to make you feel left out.
Â 
E-RO, CALM DOWN BRAH. Â STANNIS IS GONNA SAVE JON, THE BOSS OF THE WATCH, AND OF COURSE THE REST OF THE WATCH, FROM DOOM AND GLOOM. Â HE'S ALSO GOING TO SINGLE-HANDEDLY TURN MANCE FROM HAVING THE UPPER HAND AND NEGOTIATING A PACT TO LEAD HIS OWN MEN SOUTH TO BEING FORCED TO BEND THE KNEE BECAUSE STANNIS JUST SAVED THE M-F'ING DAY.
Â 
Damn, I'm a douchebag for typing in caps. Â Now I feel bad for chastising. Â 


your capslock has such a calming affect though. All of a sudden I feel safe and warm. tho to be fair that might just be the stannis selfie I just saw doing this to me.Â

1480	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	They may just end up showing him riding in with his banners 


It is a real possibility.Â

Â 
Yes, it certainly was. I did a slow clap.Â
1482	MoIaF	2014-06-08	it cuts both ways at least he doesn't churn out like a hack writer wanting to keep his audience but at the same time you want it NOW.

Absolutely! He takes the time to inter weave a very complex story which is amazing but he does (understandably) take a long time and I want to know what happens. I'm impatient.  
Anyhow, back to the episode. I really liked the Aemon scene were he discusses his past.  It was sort of lovely.
1483	Kevoncox	2014-06-08	Â 
Stannis didn't arrive during this fight, lol... ugh people commmmon.,Â 


Right...
The battle happens and then Jon is sent to treat with Mance. At that point stanis arrives. Remember, jon was placed in the ice cells because of the guys from eastwatch.
1484	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-08	I have a feeling that Lady Stoneheart is gonna be an opening scene for season 5.......


Nope, and here's why.
1. All the cast members say they wish Lady Stark would come back to life at the premiere during interviews (lol)
2. Lena Headley hinted that they were keeping in the Oberyn head smash with her photo of her pushing in Pedro's eyes, she also posted a stone heart. Â
1485	Alia Atreides	2014-06-08	Absolutely! He takes the time to inter weave a very complex story which is amazing but he does (understandably) take a long time and I want to know what happens. I'm impatient.

Â 
I liked that too he is also quite spry for a 102 year old man .Â
1486	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-08	Sweet Gerd. This fandom...
Â 
Â 


Stannis comes when Jon's talking to Mance you dumbasses. Stop whining.


Â 
Â 


Jon proves himself in the first invasion, Stannis doesn't show up at the Wall til after the parlay with Mance... why are people whining about this?
Â 
Jon finally kicks ass and shows his leadership skills, and all you can think about is Stannis? Â Come on now.


SERIOUSLY! I expected Stannis at the end of the episode too, but you dont see me tantruming about it do you? Its going to happen next week. Just...wow. You guys...i cant even...
http://i776.photobuc...69036483113.gif
Â 
Â 


They were just beginning a possible negotiation when Stannis showed up. Â That was the whole "are you a true king" thing was all about. Â If Mance wasn't going to bend the knee and wasn't going to stop attacking the wall, would he have been able to control his people south of the wall. Â Then boom, Stannis attacks. Â Which is exactly what that poster described so it's weird that he's all butthurt that the show might turn out to be pretty true to the actual scene. Â 


Indeed.
Also this:

Â 
I'm so confused about why the fanatics are worried that Stannis will have lost his moment. If anything, the show went out of it's way to set up Stannis being some hero. They set up Jon looking as the hero of battle numero uno who talks to other heros of the battle about how they are totally fucked because Mance still so greatly outnumbers them, then our hero Jon goes off into the sunset to meet with Mance without wolf or weapon totally thinking he's going to die and he'll be surrounded by giants and mammoths and 100k wildlings and it will look impressively sinister for Jon until suddenly, this dude comes out of the trees and saves the fucking day. That's a better set up for Stannis in the books because this time, Jon volunteered rather than where he was forced to do it in the books. He's walking out there like a boss and if the negotiation doesn't go well, he's dead. Of course, Jon may likely be negotiating with Mance, like he was in the books, when Stannis shows up, but still...come on. How much more of a "stannis saves the day" set up do you fanatics need? Get a grip. Â
1487	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-08	I was expecting Maester Aemon say the girl he remembered was Olenna 


Omg same, glad I wasn't the only one.
1488	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-06-08	Honestly, I didn't like this episode. There's something about this episode that feels off - And for certain It can't compare to Blackwater. You can see in this one that there was more budget involved, but Blackwater had actual stakes and had tons of characters beloved and known by the Unsullied. Honestly, as much as Grenn and Pyp are nice boys, I couldn't care for them the same as I cared for other characters in the show.
Â 
I don't think focusing on the Wall was honestly a good idea - The finale is going to be crammed. I mean, Stannis didn't even showed up! Stannis is not my favorite character, but this episode could have been edited to end with Jon/Mance and their parlay and Stannis arriving at the Wall. Also, Ygritte's death had no emotional impact, especially compared to it's book counterpart. Rose Leslie tried, but Kit decided to go full-out grumpy cat expression.
1489	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	No Stan, it's not a real possibility, we got a shot of Mel at CB in one of the earliest trailers. The arrival will be the same as it would have been had it been in this episode. I imagine we'll get that and his convo with Jon.
1490	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	no dude, Im saying that if you wanted him "to save the day" today was "the day".
Next week "day" is a different "day". With an other morning, mid day, afternoon and evening that have nothing to do with it.


Â 
Oh, I'm sorry. Â I thought you were familiar with the "save the day" idiom. Â It doesn't literally mean saving the actual day that something happened. Â It means solving a problem when something bad is expected.Â 
Â 


So do you think Mance not being able to negotiate and have the upper is a good or bad thing?


I think it depends on perspective. Â Mance has the upper hand in the negotiation because his force will eventually overwhelm the watch, unless the watch lets them through the wall wherein Mance can maintain leadership of his horde. Â But after the Stannis attack, Mance loses that upper hand so if he wants to get through, there needs to be some knee bending. Â It all depends on whether or not who the viewer feels the most sympathy with. Â It appears they set it up so that the most sympathy goes towards the watch so any plot where the wildling horde isn't free to reap and raid south of the wall and possibly overtake the watch is probably what the typical viewer wants. Â I mean, viewers aren't usually on the cannibal train, unless it's Hannibal, the Mads Mikkelson version. Â

1492	NikkiG	2014-06-08	Exactly how much time has pasted since the RW in the show?Â  In the book, I think it was only 3 days till LS but it seems like much more time has passed, which makes her appearance even less believable.Â  But I guess majic is majic

Â 
Given how they have truncated the Wall story for 4 seasons, if ever there was a time to truncate the wall story, this was it. Â And have less set up, a lot less Gilly and Sam, start the battle sooner and then have Stannis show up at the end.
Â 
Because, it will be a miracle if the wall gets more than 5 minutes in the finale.

1504	clawson24	2014-06-08	Unbelievably epic episode with some of the best battle action and CGI you're ever likely to see on TV. That said, I think we're all shocked Stannis didn't get his epic reveal to end it. Instead they're shoe-horning him in with the 5 or 6 other big moments next episode where his arrival will get lost in the fray.
1505	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-06-08	There sure is a lot to cover next week, by our book figurein' anyways. I do enjoy watching and listening to Stannis. With time constraints we may only see Renlys' armor appear over the rise, I mean Baratheon armor as a line of Knights sweep over the Free folk. After Tyrion escapes, Brienne fights and bites and TywinÂ  hums to himself the Raines of Castimere

It's months after the RW when we see LS. Thoros just tells you they found her 3 days later.
Â 
When we see her she'll already be back alive.


Thank you.Â  Been a while since I read this book.
1510	Zman1863	2014-06-08	Yeah, Jokes about Stannis not being around to save the wall aside, it will be a VERY quick scene. and that just sucks.Â 


Â 
To be fair its quick in the book as far as Stannis goes. Jon walks out there, talks with a couple people and then the news comes in secondhand that an attack, partially made up of NW is coming in and then at the very end it becomes clear that it's mostly made up of Stannis.Â
1511	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	Â 
Oh, I'm sorry. Â I thought you were familiar with the "save the day" idiom. Â It literally mean saving the actual day that something happened. Â It means solving a problem when something bad is expected.Â 
Â 
I think it depends on perspective. Â Mance has the upper hand in the negotiation because his force will eventually overwhelm the watch, unless the watch lets them through the wall wherein Mance can maintain leadership of his horde. Â But after the Stannis attack, Mance loses that upper hand so if he wants to get through, there needs to be some knee bending. Â It all depends on whether or not who the viewer feels the most sympathy with. Â It appears they set it up so that the most sympathy goes towards the watch so any plot where the wildling horde isn't free to reap and raid south of the wall and possibly overtake the watch is probably what the typical viewer wants. Â I mean, viewers aren't usually on the cannibal train, unless it's Hannibal, the Mads Mikkelson version. Â and I guess you were familiar with how a TV show is done. MacGyver doesnt save the day by stopping the ticking bomb at the begining of the nexts week episode....of Star Trek...you know, because thats how this is going to feel.

I'm not a "stan". I just like good tv and narrative.

Â 


Favourite part of the episode was Jon horrified at seeing Ygritte with an arrow sticking out of her and looking over to see Ollie nodding at him proudly, like "You're welcome." It was weirdly hilarious.

"You HAD ONE JOB... and you did outstanding" :V

D&D hate Stannis, and they do a good job of butchering his character. Any time they actually devote to his storyline is mostly just Melisandre. He is made to be a completely unlikeable and all of the brains behind the operation are not his but the Red Priestess.

1515	MegaMagick	2014-06-08	Hype deflation aside(I'm a huge Stannis fan and i hate being strung along like this ), i thought this was a decent episode. Definitely not Blackwater 2.0 like everyone was thinking.
Â 
Jon was heroic, Ygritte shot some arrows, Aliser redeemed himself (kinda), some cool special effects, and explosions.Â
1516	clawson24	2014-06-08	The rage of StanStans is hilarious. He'll show up next week. Calm your tits. They haven't actually fucked him up in any way by delaying the latter half of the battle.


Â 
To be fair, they took his most epic moment of the entire series through 5 books and instead of allowing it to be the climax of it's own episode, it's now going to be the 4th or 5th most memorable part of a different episode. Odd decision.
1517	ohpooratlas	2014-06-08	There were some fantastic moments in this episode like Ghost, Jon Snow and the music hitting when he gets into BAMF mode, Ygritte's death and that amazing panoramic shot.
Â 
But ... I felt so underwhelmed by the ending.Â 
Â 
They spent way too long on "the calm before the storm." We were about halfway in before any of the action even started.
Â 
And how is there even anyone left to defend the wall? We have Jon Snow, Bowen Marsh and Sam ... anÂ maybeÂ Thorne? Seriously. There has to be about fifty men of the watch left.
Â 
I'm not even a huge Stanis fan. I can think of at least ten other characters I like more than him, but this episode and this storyline should have ended with him. They've been dragging this out way too long to begin with and should have started the siege halfway through the season.
Â 
And I really don't know how they're supposed to fit everything in the finale. I didn't know how they were going to do it before, butÂ now?Â I think the Wall storyline is simply going to end with Stanis's arrival. I don't even think we'll get the funeral pyres or even a mention of Jon's legitimization.Â 
Â 
Seriously, how are they supposed to fit in the events we know for sure are going to happen: Mance & Jon's parlay, Stannis's arrival, Dany seeing the child bones, Dany chaining the dragons, Brienne biting some guy's ear off, Arya and the Hound having a skirmish, Arya leaving the Hound (we may not even get Arya on a boat untilÂ Season 5),Â The Mountain and Qyburn, Bran and co. making the cave, apparently there's a Cersei/Jaime scene???, Cersei and Tywin ... Tyrion's escape, Tyrion and Shae, Tyrion and the crossbow.Â 
Â 
I'm going to just not get my hopes up about LS. 10+ extra minutes means nothing when we have all that ground to cover.Â
1518	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	and I guess you were familiar with how a TV show is done. MacGyver doesnt save the day by stopping the ticking bomb at the begining of the next week episode.


Lol. Â Stannis isn't Macgyver, yo. Â

The typical viewer is left with the suspense of what's going to happen to Jon, as he's walking into the ticking bomb at the end of this episode.Â

1520	Baltan	2014-06-08	Yes, Kit's a master with sword.


I think Pompeii was a great experience for Kit, his performance improved a lot, and he seems more confident in the fighting scenes. Kudos for him, he used to be the target of all my critics.
Â 
Â 


The scythe. The scythe. The scythe. ,!!!


YEAH BABY
1521	teej6	2014-06-08	Â 
Given how they have truncated the Wall story for 4 seasons, if ever there was a time to truncate the wall story, this was it. Â And have less set up, a lot less Gilly and Sam, start the battle sooner and then have Stannis show up at the end.
Â 
Because, it will be a miracle if the wall gets more than 5 minutes in the finale.
Yes, they spent far too much time on Sam and Gilly. Not saying I didn't like the scene but considering how they could have had more time to show Jon/Mance parley and then Stannis, I think they could have tightened the episode better
1522	NightStark	2014-06-08	Brienne biting some guy's ear off, Arya and the Hound having a skirmish,


Â 
That's all one scene, Brienne confronts the Hound, you can tell it's her armour.
1523	Chuck88	2014-06-08	The extra ten minutes at the end doesn't mean shit when the last three episodes have all been under 52 minutes.Â

You are 100% correct. D&D crazies keep painting Stan fans are lunatics and whatnot.
1525	Frosta	2014-06-08	I cheered at the following moments:
Â 
Jon Snow taking charge like a boss
MAMMOTHS
Ghost being released to wreak havoc
Edd taking charge like a boss
that fucking scythe thing they released to "shave" the wildlings off the wall!
and #1 for me...
Grenn and the others saying their vows valienty in the face of certain death... so brave and EPIC!
Â 
the ending was anti-climactic, probably because i had my hopes up from reading too much speculation on the forums.
Â 
Soooooo looking forward to Bran/Bloodraven.Â  Episode 10s final scene will either be Tyrion's revenge (maybe a satyrical version Reins of Castamere for end credits?) or a badass reveal of LS.Â  I picture the Season 5x01 opener to be Cercei looking at Tywin's stinking, smiling corpse...
1526	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	It blows my mind that posters here have complained for 4 years about the show being unfaithful to the books and have nitpicked every single detail to death, then made up their minds about the pacing of this episode and are ripping the show apart because it was faithful to the pacing of the battle at the Wall. Â I've heard so many complaints about major events being rushed, but now people are upset because the show didn't rush the battle enough to give Stannis his moment in the sun. Â I'm a Stannis supporter for the IT, but the first skirmish at the Wall was about Jon Snow. Â A more prominent, a more important character in the books. Â The outrage here isn't because the show has been unfaithful, but because the show didn't rush the wall story line and make it about Stannis. Â There is no logic here.

1528	clawson24	2014-06-08	Really disappointed. There were a couple of "oh cool" moments but beyond that. We lost Grenn & Pyp, Alliser was somehow supercool dude and Ygritte felt kind of forced. Somehow the circumstances in the books - finding her without knowing who'd shot the arrow and all that - seemed more appropriately tragic. I know it's only an adaptation but jeez. And then no Stannis at the end. Quite frankly I'd say this is one of the poorer episodes this season, and Blackwater knocks it out of the park by a long shot.


Â 
In terms of pure scale and the entertainment value of the action, I'd put this episode over Blackwater by a considerable amount.

There's no battle when he arrives..who would they have been fighting..Jon goes alone in the books. He is treating with Mance and he hears a horn then Stannis crashes through.


The siege of Castle Black is not a peaceful affair, it isn't even as peaceful as most sieges where a force could just starve out a castle. Mance is besieging from only one side and is trying to escape an enemy so he needs to get across quickly. The Wildlings are constantly attacking even after the initial failed assault, in the books Jon Snow leads the defense against multiple assaults by the Wildlings. A siege, specifically this siege, is almost a constant state of warfare. In the show however it is made to look like one big battle followed by, based on the promo for next week, Jon and Mance making peace and teaming up only for Stannis to show up and slaughter a bunch of people who are just waiting around.Â

You call Stannis' arrival the most epic moment yet it doesn't even happen at the end of aSoS. See, things that don't occur right at the end of something can still be epic. I was really looking forward to the Stannis scene but now I'm just looking forward to it next week.

Finale - 66 minutes
Â 
1) Bran/Reeds and Bloodraven
2) Dany/dragons
3) Stannis at the wall
4) Jon/Mance
5) Arya/Hound - and apparently Brienne punking Hound now too??
6) Tyrion/Tywin/Shae/escape
7) Jaime/Cersei
Â 
Plus all the made up scenes that D&D will inevitably put inÂ  
Â 
I don't see how the finale will be effectively hit all these plot points effectively
1554	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-08	Honestly, I didn't like this episode. There's something about this episode that feels off - And for certain It can't compare to Blackwater. You can see in this one that there was more budget involved, but Blackwater had actual stakes and had tons of characters beloved and known by the Unsullied. Honestly, as much as Grenn and Pyp are nice boys, I couldn't care for them the same as I cared for other characters in the show.
Â 
I don't think focusing on the Wall was honestly a good idea - The finale is going to be crammed. I mean, Stannis didn't even showed up! Stannis is not my favorite character, but this episode could have been edited to end with Jon/Mance and their parlay and Stannis arriving at the Wall. Also, Ygritte's death had no emotional impact, especially compared to it's book counterpart. Rose Leslie tried, but Kit decided to go full-out grumpy cat expression.


What? Â At Blackwater the only people I gave a crap about were Tyrion and Bronn. Â Shae? Â Eh. Â Sansa? Â Seemed like she was gonna live no matter who won. Â Cersei? Â Man if only we could be so lucky Joff? Â Hahahahaha breathes hahaha Â The Hound? Â Yeah wasn't really a fan of him at this point, and when he said 'Fuck the King', it pleased me. Â Lancel?

Fuck are you serious? They are really about to disrespect the Hound like that too huh? Damn it D&D fuck you guys.
Â 
Â 
Finale - 66 minutes
Â 
1) Bran/Reeds and Bloodraven
2) Dany/dragons
3) Stannis at the wall
4) Jon/Mance
5) Arya/Hound - and apparently Brienne punking Hound now too??
6) Tyrion/Tywin/Shae/escape
7) Jaime/Cersei
Â 
Plus all the made up scenes that D&D will inevitably put inÂ  
Â 
I don't see how the finale will be effectively hit all these plot points effectively


7 dvided by 66=9 nine minutes each.Â
1561	Baltan	2014-06-08	All Tormund needed to do to win was use Tormund's Member. They wouldn't have stood a chance.Â 


Â 
He couldn't finish his bear-lover story, that's why his member power failed.
1562	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	Â I have no idea about how D&D feel about Stannis, nor do I think it really matters since this is their baby and they can tell it anyway they want. Â Still, my big problem is that a lot of Stannis fans lack the ability to articulate why Stannis' arc is problematic for the show. Â The thing about Melisandre being the one credited with Stannis' decisions is a good point because it has made Davos out to be a completely useless character since there is no angel on Stannis' shoulder to balance out that devil (I'm likening Mel to the devil here). Â From what I recall, they haven't yet made the shift from Stannis being reliant on Mel to him relying more on Davos. Â

1563	WTFSalami	2014-06-08	Now if I remember correctly the NW only had 102 men at last count. During this episode at least 39 NW deaths were shown, and I'm sure I probably missed a few.Â (yeah I counted, SO WHAT?) Which means there areÂ AT MOST 63 NW left at CB. Why do I get the feeling the show will ignore this fact, probably having the NW multiply through Meiosis, so that there will be more survivors?
LOL at counting the NW deaths. No wonder some of you get no joy from this show.
1564	RumHam	2014-06-08	After this episode I'm thinking LSH will not be making an appearance.


Â 
Why's that? Â I know the woman who plays Cersei tweeted a heart made up of stones during filming, which many took as unofficial confirmation.Â
1565	Dr. Pepper	2014-06-08	Â 
Except that "we" know a lot of other things are going to happen. Â We know that Tyrion escapes and kills Shae and kills Tywin, given the Dinklage love that alone could be almost half the episode. Â We know that Arya and the Mountain have to separate and presumably she will take the ship to Braavos. Â And there is Brienne. Â And there is Bran. Â and dany.
Â 
How much time can they possibly devote to Jon/Mance/Stannis?


I don't think we are in disagreement because I agree that the wall arc will have less screen time next episode. Â 
Â 
My point is that it seems many posters here are upset that this episode wasn't about Stannis or that Stannis is being set up to be the villain, when actually this episode served the purpose of setting up Stannis to be the hero who saves the heroes. Â I don't know why there is need for complaint on that specific aspect. Â I pointed out earlier that I would have preferred that Stannis show up in this episode. Â But that's mostly because I'm underwhelmed with the wall because the pacing has been really slow and just want to get to the other stuff. Â Still, I would think folks would be pleased that the finale will include Stannis saving the day rather than the penultimate episode being the last they see of Stannis until next year. Â It seems like the point would be that the Stannis of Blackwater isn't the same Stannis that will arrive in The Children. Â
1566	ohpooratlas	2014-06-08	Well as I said on another thread it's either that or they join together to fight a third party.
Â 
I don't think Brienne is actually after the Hound in the show.


Â 
I see option 2 as being more likely but no no no no no no! Brienne and Arya cannot meet. What is this?!
1567	Dirk blitzen	2014-06-08	The ending was a letdown only if you expected stannis to come at the end.   It was still a way better ending than blackwater however.

1569	Third of his Name	2014-06-08	Can someone do me a favor and photoshop an image of the actor who plays Stannis onto a milk carton? Preferably with that "If you see me, call" etc language? Someone must have the talent and know what I'm thinking about. This "meme" could be big.
1570	ballajam	2014-06-08	I think they made the episode end that way for us book readers. We were ALL expecting the inevitable drums with "Stannis" chants but were left wanting so much more. They clearly will set it up for the first scene next episode.Â 
Â 
I enjoyed the action, people needed this and I think the whole point was to set up Jon huge character development of a leader and the way he controlled it all. The fighting he was in was beautiful. Although Thornes part was fan freaking tastic. 
Â 
I enjoyed it, thought they could have cut the beginning BS and fit in Stannis or at least cliffhanger it as him entering form the distance. Not the greatest ever but it was awesome battle scenes, especially once Jon steps down from the top of the wall. The music was 10/10. And did anybody notice that Giants arrow that went straight through that one guy?!? Favorite partÂ

Sure it will.... only oh noes I accidentally spoiled some unsullied viewers with the reveal and they were just disappointed that Stannis would be the savior.Â

1578	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	It blows my mind that posters here have complained for 4 years about the show being unfaithful to the books and have nitpicked every single detail to death, then made up their minds about the pacing of this episode and are ripping the show apart because it was faithful to the pacing of the battle at the Wall. Â I've heard so many complaints about major events being rushed, but now people are upset because the show didn't rush the battle enough to give Stannis his moment in the sun. Â I'm a Stannis supporter for the IT, but the first skirmish at the Wall was about Jon Snow. Â A more prominent, a more important character in the books. Â The outrage here isn't because the show has been unfaithful, but because the show didn't rush the wall story line and make it about Stannis. Â There is no logic here. Â The naysayers here are guilty of the very same character bias they've accused D&D of previously. Â It's so sad because they won't be able to enjoy one of the most cinematic, intense episodes of television produced to date.
Your not paying attention to what we are saying. Stupid filler scenes like Missandei's or the moron beetle crusher convo last week could have been cut and there could have been Wall preparation scenes...a lot of the stuff that was talk and not the actual fighting.
The storyline of the Battle at the Wall didn't all need to be shoved into one episode. Spread it out over two or three episodes so that the battle isn't rushed and Stannis can arrive. It wouldn't be rushed, it'd be just right.

Lol. Good one.
1599	Raksha 2014	2014-06-08	Honestly, I didn't like this episode. There's something about this episode that feels off - And for certain It can't compare to Blackwater. You can see in this one that there was more budget involved, but Blackwater had actual stakes and had tons of characters beloved and known by the Unsullied. Honestly, as much as Grenn and Pyp are nice boys, I couldn't care for them the same as I cared for other characters in the show.
Â 
I don't think focusing on the Wall was honestly a good idea - The finale is going to be crammed. I mean, Stannis didn't even showed up! Stannis is not my favorite character, but this episode could have been edited to end with Jon/Mance and their parlay and Stannis arriving at the Wall. Also, Ygritte's death had no emotional impact, especially compared to it's book counterpart. Rose Leslie tried, but Kit decided to go full-out grumpy cat expression.


Â 
Â 
I thought the episode was pretty good, though it was not as good as Blackwater.
Â 
Highlights - Sam growing by leaps and bounds, bagging a Thenn and promising to stay with Gilly. Â Thorne vs. Tormund! Giants and mammoths! Â Grenn rallying the other Crows at the gate as they face their doom. Â Ghost coming out and fighting for our boys!
Â 
Could have done without - Anything with Slynt, the Wildlings' pre-battle discussion of Ygritte/Jon Snow. Â I don't understand why Pip and Grenn were killed off.
Â 
It is a shame that they're leaving the resolution of the Wildlings/Night's Watch battle, which should get at least 15 minutes, for the season finale, which will be utterly jam-packed with Important Stuff. Â They can't leave out or shorten the Tyrion scenes or the Dany/dragons business, or Bran communing with the trees or whatnot. Â I doubt we'll see much of Our Man Stannis next week. Â On the other hand, there may be more Sam/Gilly billing and cooing.

Because the debates aren't about what makes good television, but what goes against everybody's preconceived notions about the perfect adaptation of ASOIAF. Â Again, the pacing of the battle was more faithful to the books than what many posters wanted or were expecting, and that's what is upsetting so many. Â Jon Snow was one of my favorite characters in the books, and he's been my biggest disappointment in the show. Â I'm also a big fan of Stannis in the books, and I greatly prefer SD's Stannis performance than Kit's Jon Snow. Â But in the grand scheme of things we needed a good Jon Snow episode. Â The first couple of chapters about the battle were about Jon coming into his own and learning how to lead. Â I remember all of the outrage over the show combining all of the battles into one episode, and now everybody is upset that it is split over two episodes, not because it's bastardizing the books, but because certain posters wanted to rush the story to make it all about Stannis.

1609	Colonel Green	2014-06-08	I don't understand why Pip and Grenn were killed off.


They're very minor characters who don't have any meaningful role in subsequent books, and serve (in theory) to give some emotional resonance to the battle.
Â 
In practice the two of them have had very, very little screentime, so resonance is rather muted.Â  They'd have been better-served by developing them a bit more before their deaths this season.
1610	Maester Hodor	2014-06-08	So with the lack of Stannis in this episode, does this mean Jon won't become LC this season? I figured he would, but there's way too many things that have to happen at the wall, and only one episode to go now.

I advise you to drink a lot of coffee or red bull next week, because I have a feeling that if you blink a couple of times you might miss Stannis and his moment.
1616	Lord Carson	2014-06-08	I expect the same from you. I got called a fanatic by you i believe. Fanatic > Apologist.


I don't believe I addressed that directly to, but if I did, my apologies. In fact, I admire your devotion to the character. In my opinion, it's a bit silly to be as upset as some people are, but perhaps I should have chosen my words more carefully. Fanatic was the first to pop into my head but of course, it isn't the right choice. No offense intended.Â
1617	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	Document this thread, this is the first time you'll see so many people complain that a certain storyline wasn't rushed.Â
1618	RumHam	2014-06-08	I thought the episode was pretty great. Â Sam and Jon's talk about the wording of their oath was right off message boards like this. Â My only real complaint is Slynt being a total coward. Â Can't we have greyer characters? Â The dude can't just be a cunt he has to be a useless coward too?

Â 
Thank you, but I will drink a full horn of ale dressed as Robert Baratheon as I do every week. Â
1620	HouseHarrison	2014-06-08	Leaving Stannis out was definitely the right move. It would all have been too rushed otherwise.


Â 
Imo, I would have:
Â 
-Cut about 20 minutes of questionably relevant non-book material during the previous episode, and put the battle prep scenes for this episode in there
-Added 15 minutes to the runtime for this episode
To have an extra 35 minutes to devote to Mance/Stannis.
1621	Lord Carson	2014-06-08	Insulted, offended, defamation of character? Come on man...it's a freaking message board.


Perhaps the lightheartedness and joking nature of that post did not come across very well to some. I can assure you, I'm not too upset. I'm a peaceful fella, don't want no anger.
1622	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-08	Document this thread, this is the first time you'll see so many people complain that a certain storyline wasn't rushed.Â 


Yeah. Cause omtting a character entirely is totally the same as rushing their biggest moment. Can't wait to see his 2 minutes of glory next episode.
1623	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	Â

Because the debates aren't about what makes good television, but what goes against everybody's preconceived notions about the perfect adaptation of ASOIAF. Â Again, the pacing of the battle was more faithful to the books than what many posters wanted or were expecting, and that's what is upsetting so many. Â Jon Snow was one of my favorite characters in the books, and he's been my biggest disappointment in the show. Â I'm also a big fan of Stannis in the books, and I greatly prefer SD's Stannis performance than Kit's Jon Snow. Â But in the grand scheme of things we needed a good Jon Snow episode. Â The first couple of chapters about the battle were about Jon coming into his own and learning how to lead. Â I remember all of the outrage over the show combining all of the battles into one episode, and now everybody is upset that it is split over two episodes, not because it's bastardizing the books, but because certain posters wanted to rush the story to make it all about Stannis. Â Stannis will get his moment, but not at the expense of Jon Snow, who is a more important character, in the books and the show.


Â 
And this was a good Jon Snow episode? I have no problem with Stannis not being there, I have not problem with the deaths, but this was epic failure. This was like wannabe-Blackwater, and ended somewhere in confusion of what makes a good episode with an epic battle. Nothing here was faithful to the books, and that even isn't the issue here. The issue is that this sucked as the episode, not as the adaptation. This was badly constructed, unimaginative, humorless, uninspiring... There was CGI on some moments, but at the end, nothing that would live up to "as big as Tv gets"
Â 
Â 


To be quite fair, I don't think the episode sucked. But It was certainly not the best episode this season, and I'm not sure if it even makes it to the Top 5 of the season.


Â 
This was worse than Jaime raping Cersei and the beetles talk together... Not having Stannis tonight was the least of this episode's failures.
Â 
Â 


Wellcome to the club of the abused characters. You ve a place to sit between Jaime and Stannis.


Â 
Oh, dear... We have been in that club long before Stannis and Jaime

Well some people might hold the whole thing about not sealing the tunnel against him and he did leave an idiot craven in charge at the top of the Wall but he did fight bravely so I guess he might still have some support.Â

Â 
Oh don't worry, the now sure-to-be rushed as fuck finale will more than make up for it. I hope we're allowed to catch at least a small glimpse of Stannis walking by next episode, what with all the Daenerys and Tyrion bullshit we'll be subjected to.
1629	Pearlthegirl	2014-06-08	I'm so confused about why the fanatics are worried that Stannis will have lost his moment. Â If anything, the show went out of it's way to set up Stannis being some hero. Â They set up Jon looking as the hero of battle numero uno who talks to other heros of the battle about how they are totally fucked because Mance still so greatly outnumbers them, then our hero Jon goes off into the sunset to meet with Mance without wolf or weapon totally thinking he's going to die and he'll be surrounded by giants and mammoths and 100k wildlings and it will look impressively sinister for Jon until suddenly, this dude comes out of the trees and saves the fucking day. Â That's a better set up for Stannis in the books because this time, Jon volunteered rather than where he was forced to do it in the books. Â He's walking out there like a boss and if the negotiation doesn't go well, he's dead. Â Of course, Jon may likely be negotiating with Mance, like he was in the books, when Stannis shows up, but still...come on. Â How much more of a "stannis saves the day" set up do you fanatics need? Â Get a grip.

This entirely!
I was expecting Stannis myself, thinking they'd rush through the Wall story lines as they've butchered them all season.  In the end I'm glad they're sticking to the books this time! They did not properly build to this all season, it's true, but this episode was a love story to the Night's Watch.  And that alone.  Stannis' story really builds after this(in the books).  He UnderDog's his way in to save the day when the Watch has depleted themselves doing their jobs.  Its where I began to like and root for Stannis when I read the books.  Where he overcomes his previous defeats.  I hope he gets his due from here on.  I am worried considering his portrayal thus far but I'm not going to write off his looming heroism just because he didn't get an episode finale.  I pray they start showing Stannis some love because I can empathize with the StanStans frustrations with his show portrayal.  But really, this is a turning point for his character.  Where he fights for his realm and not his entitlement.  I do hope they don't blow that.
I'd like to repeat:  This episode was a love story to The Night's Watch.  I am pleased.  There were some great technical shots : 
The panoramic of the Castle Black side.
The swinging Scythe taking out the climbers.
Mammoths and Giants, oh my!
Ghost vision
And character development of, yes those guys, those Watchers on the Wall! (episode Title anyone?)
Aemon sharing wisdom
Jon and Sam showing the innocence of their youth before battle.
Grenn filling in for Donal Noye and HOLDING THE EFFIN GATE AGAINST AN EFFIN GIANT
Newfound respect for Aliser Thorne(what? Yeah!)
Slynt's denial and cowardice.
Jon's smile when he sees Ygritte aiming right at him!
The kid's vengeance for his parents.
Damnit Pyp, RIP
Sam releasing Ghost
Edd, the Wall is yours
For the Strangers sake people, not a bad little love story to the true heroes of the damn realm.
Here's hoping we're all happy with the finale next week.  Not bloody likely.
Yeah, alright, it went too fast and ended abruptly...I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
1630	Jay92	2014-06-08	So with the lack of Stannis in this episode, does this mean Jon won't become LC this season? I figured he would, but there's way too many things that have to happen at the wall, and only one episode to go now.
Â 
It was sad to see Pyp and Grenn die, but at least Edd is still around.


Â 
No it will happen since Jon season 5 arc will be a set up for command. We just won't have the whole vote over days and like 5 guys being voted for command. Stannis will offer Winterfell, Jon will struggle with the decision but ultimately decide he can't take it because Bran is out there and that's when he gets voted by all the men. It won't be drawn out as it was in the books.Â 
Â 
Still though, next episode will be crazy jam packed.Â
1631	BloodSausage	2014-06-08	7 dvided by 66=9 nine minutes each.Â 

You don't need the full allotment for each story line. 4 minutes is enough for the LSH reveal. Neither bran nor dani will need all that time either. Should leave enough for Tyrion and Stannis. 
Seriously though, D&D are trolls if we don't get LSH.
1632	juanml82	2014-06-08	I cant see why Thorne wont be named as LC.


Maybe because he didn't seal the Gate? In the books is clear everyone hates him after going through his boot camp. Slynt is definitely out of the competition, so I guess it will be between Thorne and Jon.
Then again, Thorne might not survive, making the competition between, I don't know, Jon and Edd?
Â 
On a side note, Edd was a badass. Too bad we missed Grenn and the other suckers killing the giant, though.
Â 
And now, carry on complaining. I guess that's why TV shows forums are for.
1633	Not Dead Just Broken	2014-06-08	Apparently, unnecessary trips to Braavos really hold you up. Although is it possible the Wildling retreat that they interpret as them just waiting until tomorrow is actually Stannis' army?
1634	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	Your not paying attention to what we are saying. Stupid filler scenes like Missandei's or the moron beetle crusher convo last week could have been cut and there could have been Wall preparation scenes...a lot of the stuff that was talk and not the actual fighting.
The storyline of the Battle at the Wall didn't all need to be shoved into one episode. Spread it out over two or three episodes so that the battle isn't rushed and Stannis can arrive. It wouldn't be rushed, it'd be just right.


Â 
I'm amazed that I see comments like this from people who have read the books. Â Character moments are not "stupid filler." Â It's a different medium, and it's smart that the show fleshes out supporting characters that are tied to the story instead of including everybody and making them all two dimensional caricatures. Â  I personally loved the Grey Worm/Missandei and Sam/Gilly scenes because they fleshed out characters that have been established. Â Sam and Gilly are important to the Wall storyline so it makes sense that they'd get some moments in this episode, along with Maester Aemon. Â Just wait and see how Stannis is handled next episode, I promise you he'll be featured.
1635	Cas Stark	2014-06-08	You don't need the full allotment for each story line. 4 minutes is enough for the LSH reveal. Neither bran nor dani will need all that time either. Should leave enough for Tyrion and Stannis.

Â 
You are clinically insane if you think D&D is going to end the season with only 4 minutes of Khaleesi.
1636	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-08	It blows my mind that posters here have complained for 4 years about the show being unfaithful to the books and have nitpicked every single detail to death, then made up their minds about the pacing of this episode and are ripping the show apart because it was faithful to the pacing of the battle at the Wall. Â I've heard so many complaints about major events being rushed, but now people are upset because the show didn't rush the battle enough to give Stannis his moment in the sun. Â I'm a Stannis supporter for the IT, but the first skirmish at the Wall was about Jon Snow. Â A more prominent, a more important character in the books. Â The outrage here isn't because the show has been unfaithful, but because the show didn't rush the wall story line and make it about Stannis. Â There is no logic here. Â The naysayers here are guilty of the very same character bias they've accused D&D of previously. Â It's so sad because they won't be able to enjoy one of the most cinematic, intense episodes of television produced to date.


LOL no joke, man. 
Â 


The Scythe was the coolest fucking thing ever.Â  


That was so bomb. Edd <3
Â 


Â I have no idea about how D&D feel about Stannis, nor do I think it really matters since this is their baby and they can tell it anyway they want. Â Still, my big problem is that a lot of Stannis fans lack the ability to articulate why Stannis' arc is problematic for the show. Â The thing about Melisandre being the one credited with Stannis' decisions is a good point because it has made Davos out to be a completely useless character since there is no angel on Stannis' shoulder to balance out that devil (I'm likening Mel to the devil here). Â From what I recall, they haven't yet made the shift from Stannis being reliant on Mel to him relying more on Davos. Â 


The show hasnt made that shift yet but i assume its coming. Stannis will have his Big Damn Heroes moment. Davos and Stannis made the trek to Braavos in the show, without Mel so i think that was the turning point for Stannis to rely on Davos more.Â Cuz Davos spoke up for him and gained the favor of the Iron Bank.
Â 


Nope, just vinegar.


Piss and vinegar. :V

1637	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	I think Pyp and Grenn dying was fitting (but I kinda wish Pyp survived). Grenn's death was really special. In GoT, very few die in such a heroic manner. Most deaths are grisly and leave a bitter feeling (ala Ned, RW, the Viper and most minor characters).
Grenn's scene was so great...better than any role he could have if he had lived on.

Jon specifically mentioned Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower in 3x5, when talking to Tormund about their numbers, and Jeor mentioned Cotter Pyke in passing in 1x10, so they do technically exist, but whether we'll actually see them is a different matter.

Absolutely!Â  Glad they showed why he is a leader in the NW and not just some guy who has it in for Jon Snow.
Â 
Fun episode!Â 
Lots of changes, but many were positive.
Â 
Loved:
I've already mentioned Thorne being more of a hero.
I love Show-Sam better than Book-Sam, who is so insufferably cowardly that I can't stand it.Â  I enjoyed the "loop-hole"-finding and him taking the initiative to kiss Gilly and hide her.
I enjoyed the Sam-Maester Aemon convo, but when I realized that it cut into their ability to show Stannis, that annoyed me.Â  Was I the only one who expected him to say that the girl whom he loved was Olenna Tyrell?Â  I know that she's nowhere nearly as old as him, but that thought popped into my
Death of Pyp and Grenn.Â  Sad, but I especially loved Grenn's heroism and the recitation of their vows as they prepared to face the giant.Â  That was very moving. Pyp's realistic shaky hands was also touching to me.Â  Losing 3 people he cared about will have a real impact on Jon.
Really enjoyed the mammoths and giants.Â 
Unleashing of Ghost!Â  Makes up for lack of unleashed Grey Wind in the RW episode!Â  Would have preferred to see more, but I get that the CGI budget was needed for giants and mammoths and such.
I've always preferred Show-Ygritte to Book Ygritte. I liked the fact they kept her death and Jon seemed willing to send himself on a suicide mission in consequence.Â  Didn't care for the way he held her as she died because I was thinking that someone could kill him during that time.Â  However, I did like the last "you know nothing, Jon Snow".Â 
Â 
Didn't love:
Janos Slynt the coward:Â  I didn't think this was realistic for a man who led the Gold Cloaks.Â  However, I was concerned that he would be killed and we would not get "Edd, fetch me a block," but it looks like they may have been setting that up.Â  Execution for cowardice works for me!Â  I was also afraid that he might rape Gilly in the room, so I'm thrilled that didn't happen.
Not ending with Stannis! I am no great Stannis fan, but I was yelling his name from the beginning of the credits.Â  I realized immediately (since he didn't appear in the credits) that he might not show up, but I think it would have been better to cut some of the pre-battle conversation and allow for Jon to meet with Mance and Stannis to arrive.Â  I agree with the folks who say that there's too much planned for episode 10.Â  In my opinion, Arya's departure could have been done in episode 8 (since they have been wasting him with her and the Hound anyway) and Stannis's arrival in Episode 9.Â  Not all the arcs have to tie up in the last episode of the season.
So looking forward to next week.
1652	Not Dead Just Broken	2014-06-08	Yes, but do Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower, let alone their commanders, even exist in the show?


Â 
No reason for them not to.Â  They aren't really in the books until after the battle anyway, right?Â  No need to cast actors or confuse people with questions like "why the bleep didn't they help" until Season 5.

Yeah. It was a great episode to expand on the Wall and show us the NW holding together even after so much.Â 
Â 
Do most of you watch with unsullied? Im kinda guessing not from some of the reactions in here. My mother was literally bouncing all over the room going "omfg! OH MAN! DO IT! JON!!! SOMEONE END THAT GUY! (Tormund) OMG!!! WOOOOAHHH! PYP! YGRITTE! OH NO!!" It was really special and fun.Â

I'm sorry but, no.  That crap  ^ plus Craster's deserters has been the absolute worst of the worst this season.  I usually agree with you too, Ser! You even taught me to love Sansa!  Rewatch it, I beg you! As an ode to the NW in the back of your mind.  With no other expectations....I promise you, you will see some merits in it.
1655	Fuse Prime	2014-06-08	I loved this episode. Â My only gripe is not having Thorne or Slynt order Jon to parlay with Mance. Â I think having Jon Snow come up with that decision on his own will have some kind of butterfly effect.
Â 
Now that I've had a chance to digest this episode, and from reading other boarders' opinions, I'm glad that Stannis didn't appear. Â
1656	Mladen	2014-06-08	Hyperbole really doesnt suit you, mate.


Â

Â

Â 
Was this simple enough, dear?
1657	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	And this was a good Jon Snow episode? I have no problem with Stannis not being there, I have not problem with the deaths, but this was epic failure. This was like wannabe-Blackwater, and ended somewhere in confusion of what makes a good episode with an epic battle. Nothing here was faithful to the books, and that even isn't the issue here.

Â 
Yes it was, it was all about Jon's growing role as a leader. Â If you think this episode was humorless, I encourage you to rewatch it. Â The first fifteen minutes of the episode was full of great comedic relief, Sam particularly was a scene-stealer that could give Dinklage a run for his money.

This was the main problem with this episode. Right here. The episode tried to be Blackwater in every step of the way. You can even compare the preparation scenes in Blackwater to similar scenes this episode. The problem is, however, that we haven't had a emotional connection to characters in the Wall to care for them, much less to hear their conversations. Instead of sounding like character-building, it sounded like filler. Pyp and Green, as I've said before, are nice lads, but they're only that. They have had less screen-time than Missandei and Grey Worm, why should we care about their deaths? And Ygritte's death just didn't work. I understood what they were trying to do, but it certainly didn't work as intended. Ygritte's death, one of my favorite scenes in the books, shattered. It just felt uninspired, even with a bigger budget.
Â 


This was worse than Jaime raping Cersei and the beetles talk together... Not having Stannis tonight was the least of this episode's failures.


I still feel the beetles takes the cake, if only because I felt that time was wasted on an unnecessary scene.
Â 


I love how you described it, as a love story to the NW. Â Because that explains exactly why I liked the episode despite it being a bit underwhelming for me. Â 


I did get that, but It just didn't work. Their love story to the NW seemed too flashy with no substance. I'd give them two months before their impending break-up.
1659	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Disappointed they didn't end with Stannis showing up but set up a good cliffhanger for show watchers. I think most of them will be surprised when Stannis saves them at the last minutes but still, I thought that was a great episode. Great fight sequences and freakin' Mammoths! I thought it was better than Blackwater.I liked it better than BW, too Â Â And doing absolutely nothing of importance.Â Exactly...Grenn and Pyp get sent off elsewhere in the books never to return. This way they get an emotional goodbye that adds drama to the show.Â I cant see why Thorne wont be named as LC.Because he dies, because he becomes too disabled to lead, because the men like Jon better...take your pick, there are a lot of reasons why Thorne won't get elected and Jon will.
1660	NightStark	2014-06-08	Â 
Â 
Didn't love:
Janos Slynt the coward:Â  I didn't think this was realistic for a man who led the Gold Cloaks.Â  However, I was concerned that he would be killed and we would not get "Edd, fetch me a block," but it looks like they may have been setting that up.Â  Execution for cowardice works for me!Â  I was also afraid that he might rape Gilly in the room, so I'm thrilled that didn't happen.


Â 

Quite a difference between brutalising peasants in KL and facing a hardened wildling army with giants and mammoths.

Maybe they will have Red Dress take another bath.


She'll take a bath next episode and win the next battle. #Redwomanalldayereday and Stannis and Davos can like, I don't know watch.
1662	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	Exactly...Grenn and Pyp get sent off elsewhere in the books never to return. This way they get an emotional goodbye that adds drama to the show.


Â 
It also adds a level of weight to the battle that wasn't present during Blackwater. Â It's one thing that extras are getting killed off, but when known, likable characters are dying it seriously ups the stakes, and will make Stannis' charge that much more impactful.Â
1663	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-06-08	Do most of you watch with unsullied? Im kinda guessing not from some of the reactions in here. My mother was literally bouncing all over the room going "omfg! OH MAN! DO IT! JON!!! SOMEONE END THAT GUY! (Tormund) OMG!!! WOOOOAHHH! PYP! YGRITTE! OH NO!!" It was really special and fun.Â 

I watch with unsullied, and they were both disappointed. Most of the reactions yet were "Eh, It was sort of dull." Especially comparing after last Sunday's episode.
1664	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	I've calmed down.
Â 
When I stop talking in my native language, you know I'm calm down.
Â 
Yes, I liked the episode.
Â 
Yes, it was a mistake to not showing Stannis yet.
Â 
I rated it 8. I was ready to give it a 10 with Stannis.
1665	nara	2014-06-08	Forgot to mention-- is it just me or have there been a couple of interesting mentions of "no one" and "no body" this season foreshadowing Arya's future?Â  Per Sam, when you're nobody you're not afraid...
1666	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-08	I wish all these Stannis cry babies would shut up. We needed a Gregor Clegane orgy with Ros's ghost, Ygritte, and Shae to bring the battle full circle.

Â 
That wasn't in the books so it's probably poorly thought out garbage.
1668	clawson24	2014-06-08	Stannis is getting played down because with all the huge stuff happening next week no one is even going to give a shit about the fight at the wall. As far as tv watchers are concerned the battle is over and won, the wildlings lost.Â 


Â 
You mean aside from the fact that Jon literally said the wildings will keep coming back and there's no way we'll be able to stop them?
1669	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-08	Much like my boy Jon Snow, I can see both sides. First of all:Stannis isn't the ultimate villain, but he isn't the ultimate hero, either. The battle for the Wall has nothing to do with Stannis even in the books...Stannis only comes in after the battle is over and the Wildlings have won, just like it did here. They needed to focus more on Jon Snow and the rest of the Watch, because if they didn't, they wouldn't be able to convince the audience that Jon's going to be the next LC. Having Stannis come in at the end of this episode would steal that moment from Jon, whose character needs it more than Stannis. Stannis will have HIS moment next week, and it will be awesome. People need to get a fucking grip already and stop bitching about something that they WILL get to see.

I agree. This episode belongs to Jon Snow, not Stannis. It frankly pissed me off that the pre-ep thread was like 20 pages (or more!) all about Stannis even when everyone thought he would only be in like the last two minutes. I do love Stannis, but he is really a minor character.
On the other hand:It more about having a complete and overall finished episode.  The anticlimactic ending could have been easily resolved by having the Stannis storyline in the epidote. People might have complained about there not being enough Stannis, however, I personally would have been satisfied that they had an overall complete story for the episode. Now, Stannis will come next week and I'm sure it'll be fine but it won't have the emotional appeal it could have had had it been done this episode.  There will be a lot of things going on in the finale and this will just be one amongst many.

Yes, it is a weird structural decision to leave this episode without a resolution. They could have easily started the battle earlier in order to have enough time for Stannis at the end. Most of the build up in the first 20 minutes could have been moved to previous episodes, seeing as they had THE ENTIRE FREAKING SEASON to spend on build up.
1670	Queen of Whores	2014-06-08	That wasn't in the books so it's probably poorly thought out garbage.


Â 
Omg, ouch, that passive-aggressive burn really put us in our place lol

Â 

Quite a difference between brutalising peasants in KL and facing a hardened wildling army with giants and mammoths.
Â 


True, but I assume that he fought well in some war to get that position.Â  After all, he was a butcher's son, so he had to earn his way up.
1672	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-08	Too many laugh out loud situations in this episode. That fucking head nod Olly (SP?) gave Jon after shooting Ygritte killed me, it was so funnyÂ  Â . Just O.K. as an adaptation; I'm realistic and get the budget issues. At least we did get Ygritte saying her cave line since everything else about her death was funny when it shouldn't have been. This one wasn't very faithful to the books and I would have liked to seen Stannis' arrival this week; there was a bunch of unnecessary filler that they could have taken out to make room for it.
Â 
I'd rate it about a C+. Good try, good effort, some cool scenes and some cringe-worthy as well as LOLWTF moments.Â
1673	The Red Melli	2014-06-08	I'm sorry but, no. That crap ^ plus Craster's deserters has been the absolute worst of the worst this season. I usually agree with you too, Ser! You even taught me to love Sansa! Rewatch it, I beg you! As an ode to the NW in the back of your mind. With no other expectations....I promise you, you will see some merits in it.


Locke storyline was so moronic... it has to be the worst.
1674	Salad Days Saan	2014-06-08	No way, Slynt being useless was great.
Â 
Because it set up Grenn stepping up to be a hero.Â  He, we, can sense that the men on the wall are shrinking.Â  Thorne had presence that was holding them together.Â  Slynt has no presence, and it was going to get them all killed.Â  The moment was too big for Slynt, Slynt didn't want to be there.Â  Grenn got him out of there, quickly.Â  Trusting Jon to step up and fill the void, because Jon's been Captain of that recruit class from the beginning.
Â 
It underscores the the theme of Jon becoming The Leader at the Wall.Â  And it was awesome.
Â 
I kinda miss having no "the wall is yours Jon Snow" but we could all feel it.Â  Better to have no one say it -- particularly when we can all SEE it being said between the lines -- than to have Slynt say it and have it be hollow.
1675	rmholt	2014-06-08	Â 
You can roll over a fire in clothes and not be burned. Targs aren'tÂ  immune to fire anyway.

IIRC you are SUPPOSED to roll if your clothes are on fire.
1676	clawson24	2014-06-08	Is Alister Thorne dead? And why did they kill Grenn?


Â 
Because Donal Noye wasn't introduced in the show whatsoever and it's much more fitting to have a named, well-known character go down dying a heroic death than a couple of extras.
1677	StrollofShame	2014-06-08	Oh - forgot to mention, Ygritte's death did not have the emotional punch it should have had.  I have to say Kit was a bit off.

I don't agree. Compare to Emilia's pathetic, underwhelming reaction to Ser Jonah's betrayal last week---Kit's performance was magnificent in comparison.
1678	JonInVa	2014-06-08	Well, I learned a number of things from this episode:
1. Ser Aliser is a bonafide badass and much better swordsman than Jon Snow, who seems to get disarmed when fighting anyone other than no-name hacks.
2. Slynt is, besides an asshat, a total craven, and his desertion will likely be the catalyst for Jon giving him some Stark justice.
3. Sam actually has balls and honor, more so than 99% of the NW. And he got some Gilly tongue. Bonus!
4. Everyone wants, and deserves, a Direwolf for Christmas.
5. Grenn is a hero, and deserved to be seen fighting and dying.
6. Never climb a wall of ice unless you want to be brushed off in a million pieces like dust on a Swiffer.
7. Every time you say the word "loose", you must scream yourself into an apopleptic fit.
8. Aliser Thorne looks a lot like Jimmy Page.
9. Every time Jon sees Ygritte with an arrow pointing at him, he's crunches his face up and smiles; never remembering the last time when she put three arrows in him for doing just that.
10. I know nothing about how this show will interpret the books. And neither do most others around here. And I couldn't care less. I enjoy the story for what it is - not what it should be.
1679	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-08	Loved this episode. I don't mind stannis not showing up yet, he'll show up next week.
1680	D-Shiznit	2014-06-08	I'm glad Stan didn't show up, this was the Nights watch's moment, don't need Stannis coming in at the last second and taking all the glory.
1681	rmholt	2014-06-08	I win in the reader married to non reader bc husband said I thought something was supposed to happen with the dwarf. First episode he's displayed any comprehension.
1682	Jasta11	2014-06-08	-We get it, Gilly and Sam like each other. No need to spend two scenes on that. I did like Sam taking a few levels in badass and delivering a few great lines (open the fucking door!).
Â 
-Maester Aemon is always nice to see, he's the best of the elderly actors if you ask me.
Â 
-The battle atop the Wall was great overall. Only bit I didn't like was that the scale was a bit low. Not enough men and giants. But that's understandable since it was probing defense time. And the scythe was a great idea, kudos to whoever thought of that. Also, Edd taking charge of things was great. Piss on Jon, I want this guy as Lord Commander.
Â 
-I think this needs to be said: Fookin giants riding fookin mammoths.
Â 
-Also, giant archers, which is just straight up brilliant. Much more believable than wildling shortbows shooting 700 feet up. I cringed at the guy who got hit by a ballista-like arrow, fell down said 700 feet, then got impaled on a spike. Ouch. Oberyn can't complain after that one.
Â 
-I got almost in tears at Grenn and friends reciting their oaths while facing down a big stonking giant. Pure. Fucking. Badass. Best scene in the episode.
Â 
-Ygritte dying was a bit let down by Kit's acting (which was otherwise pretty great) and by the fact I actually wanted the bitch dead after she killed Pyp.
Â 
-Loved the Jon/Styr duel, well choreographed and much better than Lord Snow's tussle with Karl the Fookin Legend.
Â 
-Alistair Thorne actually growing a set of brass balls and delivering great lines. Hope he survives to stay a lovable douche.
Â 
-The fight choreography in Castle Black, however, was pretty poor in general. I counted almost 40 Watchers dying, almost three quarters of them at the hands of Tormund, Styr or Ygritte. It's a wonder they weren't utterly routed at all. I get the main wildling characters are good fighters, but they kinda went overboard. Especially cruel to then only give one kill to poor Ghost.
Â 
-No Stannis is pretty surprising. I'll reserve final judgement based on how it's done next episode, but I'm pretty sure the series would have been better served by having him save the day. Instead he's going to be in what is possibly the most crammed episode of the series so far.
Â 
Â 
So yeah, overall it was very solid, with amazing visuals, great scenes and enough badassery on both sides to make up for Stannis's absence. But it still falls short of Blackwater and its amazing dialog.
1683	Conchobar	2014-06-08	This is the first time in the show we had an accurate depiction of aerial strategic movements. That pan from the north of the wall to the south of the wall from the firing archers perspective, with arrows falling on to the encroaching Wildling band attacking the South gate was incredible. It really gave us a perspective of the strategic landscape of the battle and wall at that time and I think it helped the unsullied understand the tactical scenarios that were about to present themselves to the Night's Watch.
1684	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	Â 
Omg, ouch, that passive-aggressive burn really put us in our place lol


Â 
Sorry, it was wrong of me to be emotional and irrational in an environment like this.Â
1685	Mladen	2014-06-08	I'm sorry but, no. That crap ^ plus Craster's deserters has been the absolute worst of the worst this season. I usually agree with you too, Ser! You even taught me to love Sansa! Rewatch it, I beg you! As an ode to the NW in the back of your mind. With no other expectations....I promise you, you will see some merits in it.


Â 
I do understand what they intended and I wished they had done the better job. I am not complaining about Stannis, I am actually complaining of the episode itself. When you haven't made sure that your characters for such centric episode are fleshed out enough, you do have a problem in maintaining the attention for 50 minutes. This was like never ending marathon. I do wanted nice NW episode, I wanted it to be as epic as Blackwater, but it wasn't. It failed where it should have been the strongest.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Yes it was, it was all about Jon's growing role as a leader. Â If you think this episode was humorless, I encourage you to rewatch it. Â The first fifteen minutes of the episode was full of great comedic relief, Sam particularly was a scene-stealer that could give Dinklage a run for his money.


Â 
This was all about Jon's growth? yes, it can be said that way... But, this episode failed to make a nuance in that approach. It was basically "OK, here I am, nothing changed, let me take control" There were ways to make this episode better, even without being super purist about Â it. the structural issues, no fleshed out characters, some strange pause, and illogical gate subplot (why do they need a mammoth, when a single giant could have pulled it up?) Yes, Sam saying "open the fucking door" might have pushed the right buttons for some, and it was indeed funny, but at the end, that's just not enough.
Â 
Â 


This was the main problem with this episode. Right here. The episode tried to be Blackwater in every step of the way. You can even compare the preparation scenes in Blackwater to similar scenes this episode. The problem is, however, that we haven't had a emotional connection to characters in the Wall to care for them, much less to hear their conversations. Instead of sounding like character-building, it sounded like filler. Pyp and Green, as I've said before, are nice lads, but they're only that. They have had less screen-time than Missandei and Grey Worm, why should we care about their deaths? And Ygritte's death just didn't work. I understood what they were trying to do, but it certainly didn't work as intended. Ygritte's death, one of my favorite scenes in the books, shattered. It just felt uninspired, even with a bigger budget.


Â 
This... I mean, the characters on the Wall are just group of extras, with exception of Sam and Jon... When you have this type of episode, you make sure you have enough to make it through the end. Blackwater had Tyrion, Sansa, Cersei, Hound, Bronn, all established characters. This one had nothing. It had Jon whose "learning to lead" path was done in such weird way that it is almost hysterical, and Sam who was more or less confused about what to do, with a deal of courage... The rest of gang is flat line... This just didn't push the right buttons, as the episode, not as adaptation.
1686	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-08	Â 
There was a time when I would ask for explanation, but not anymore...
Â 
And, btw, as someone who has watched Vikings, I do believe this was such bad episode.
Â 
Was this simple enough, dear?


Being a total shit doesnt suit you either. I have a hard time buying it, mate. No offense. I get that you dislike the episode, but i think you are tryingÂ way too hard to be edgy about it.
1687	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-08	Why is no one else concerned about the lack of Gregor Clegane and Ros this episode? I think you guys need to reread the books a little bit.
1688	Salad Days Saan	2014-06-08	Â 
-Also, giant archers, which is just straight up brilliant. Much more believable than wildling shortbows shooting 700 feet up. I cringed at the guy who got hit by a ballista-like arrow, fell down said 700 feet, then got impaled on a spike. Ouch. Oberyn can't complain after that one.


Â 
Can't wait until Edd mentions how lucky that guy was, missing the rocks and all.
1689	Pearlthegirl	2014-06-08	I'm thinking it will be between Jon and Slynt for LC of the Night's Watch, and then Sam threatens Slynt and says he'll tell everyone how much of a coward he was during the battle, unless he drops out of of the race for LC.

I can see that. Way easier than teaching/FX-ing talking birds.  But that's next season I'm sure.
1690	Lord Carson	2014-06-08	I wish all these Stannis cry babies would shut up. We needed a Gregor Clegane orgy with Ros's ghost, Ygritte, and Shae to bring the battle full circle.


I don't even but I'd totally watch that
1691	juanml82	2014-06-08	I love how you described it, as a love story to the NW. Â Because that explains exactly why I liked the episode despite it being a bit underwhelming for me. Â 


The aristocrats of Westeros are all too busy killing each other. A bunch of exiled thieves, rapists, criminals and other undesirables are the only ones holding their backs and doing their duty to the Realm.
1692	clawson24	2014-06-08	Yeah, how come we only saw Ghost take one wildling down?


Â 
It's almost comical how the only direwolf action we get each time they're involved in a fight is a .5 second shot of a direwolf leaping from off screen and tackling somebody out of frame. I completely understand it's due to budgetary/practical reasons, but it's still disappointing that we see so little of them. Everyone I was with literally cheered when Sam opened the door to see massive old Ghost sitting there ready to fight, then he kills one guy, and is never seen or referenced again. I guess it could be implied that him being released had a big part in turning the tide of the battle going on in Castle Black. I'm sure he ate his share of faces.

Me too. This was the kind of passion and energy I expected from Oberyn during the fight, but didn't get it. Loved Grenn! Had goosebumps when they were reciting the vows.

I have to laugh at this comment... Thanks for the compliment...
1695	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-08	It blows my mind that posters here have complained for 4 years about the show being unfaithful to the books and have nitpicked every single detail to death, then made up their minds about the pacing of this episode and are ripping the show apart because it was faithful to the pacing of the battle at the Wall. Â I've heard so many complaints about major events being rushed, but now people are upset because the show didn't rush the battle enough to give Stannis his moment in the sun. Â I'm a Stannis supporter for the IT, but the first skirmish at the Wall was about Jon Snow. Â A more prominent, a more important character in the books. Â The outrage here isn't because the show has been unfaithful, but because the show didn't rush the wall story line and make it about Stannis. Â There is no logic here. Â The naysayers here are guilty of the very same character bias they've accused D&D of previously. Â It's so sad because they won't be able to enjoy one of the most cinematic, intense episodes of television produced to date.


Â 
Sweet darling, I crooned from your first sentence.Â 
Â 
Shit got real. Really really SKYRIM real! Mammoths and giants? Fuck this milkdrinker blockade. They've taken on dragons and dovakiin, no fucking way are some namby-pamby emotionally-scarred teenagers getting the better of them.... Oh SNAP they got Fus Ro Dah'd!Â

Â 
There's nuance there, but you won't see it if you hate the approach. Â My friends were curious about the giant opening the gate on his own, but then we thought about and came to a consensus. Â He was running on adrenaline after being injured and watching his fellow wildlings and giant buddy die, and his mammoth run off in agony. Â It's like when a normal human finds the strength to lift a car off of a loved one. Â If you paid the same person a $1000 to do it for sport, it wouldn't be possible, but the human body can do amazing things when it's running off of adrenaline. Â Imagine what a Giant can do in a similar situation. Â Just because a Giant could theoretically lift a gate like that under certain circumstances, why waste your energy when you can have a beast of burden perform the same task? Â Have the mammoth open the gate so you can save your energy for the actual attack at the gate. Â When plan A fails spectacularly, go for plan B and open that shit yourself, because you're a giant.

For real. Grenn is a legend I really liked the kid playing him. He will be missed. I thought the night watch oath scene was awesome. Now his watch has ended

Â 
Pwnage of the hour:

- Tormund going rabid...and Jon putting him down. Just a tranq, whew!
- Samwell "Open the Fucking Gate" Tarly. Heartsbane has levitated from its sheathe and is flying across hill and heather!
- Ghost being needed...only Sam understands his badassery.Â 
- Grenn, the legend of fooking Castle Black ally.Â 
- Samwell "I'm not dying until I've kissed mah woman" Tarly.Â 
- Grenn, the legend of getting the teacher to leave the classroom so everyone could sit on desks and hang out...while Slynt hid in the lady's room.Â 
- Olly...um...Satin? Please don't be Satin's stand-in because I want adorable Jon/Stain UST...but I dunno there's still Stannis coming so I might be slaked.Â 
- Samwell "You May Be Fucking Ten But Step the Fuck Up" Tarly.Â 
- Jon vs. Qhorin Halfhand was the battle Westeros deserved, but not the one it needed...because it knew Jon vs. Styr was coming, and it was packing ANVILS AND HAMMERS.

Styr or whatever his name was fought like a beast! He was awesome

Overall the episode was pretty good. Shame about Stannis, though. Showing up next episode won't have the same effect

1702	clawson24	2014-06-08	Tough crowd. As a Stan fan, myself, I suppose I can see why some are sour towards this episode, though I'm willing to give D&D the benefit of the doubt until next week.

I don't understand the complaints over scope, though. I thought this battle looked much more impressive than Blackwater. Sure, complain about the narrative all you want, but this was some phenomenal looking television -- visually.
Â 
I'm more sad over Grenn and Pyp than Ygritte.


Â 
I'd sincerely like others to suggest episodes of television that were more epic in scope, with more impressive visual effects, showcasing more action across multiple fronts. At times I forgot it was even an episodic television show I was watching. The Giants, Mammoths, the Scythe chopping down people on the Wall, aerial views, long-takes of fighting, etc. were all absolutely top notch. That giant storming down the tunnel while Grenn and the other NW recited their vows. Epicness.

No reason for them not to.Â  They aren't really in the books until after the battle anyway, right?Â  No need to cast actors or confuse people with questions like "why the bleep didn't they help" until Season 5.


Yeah... right when Jon has almost drawn peace terms with Mance, then Stannis theÂ Menace comes storming in to save? the day... Tah tah taÂ Dah!Â  RedÂ Witch and all.Â  Should take about 5 min to cover thoroughly imo.Â
1704	HouseHarrison	2014-06-08	Why is no one else concerned about the lack of Gregor Clegane and Ros this episode? I think you guys need to reread the books a little bit.


Â 
I do at least. What are you on about?
1705	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	I know Jon said it, but why are we supposed to think Castle Black will fall?
Main threat was the attack by the back door with elite warriors and its over. All done in Mances side was a Joke. Their arrows just dont reach the wall, if they send a mamouth you set him on fire, and if they send you a giant youll stop him with six men. The door was not even broked, just lifted. And the climbing guys had 0 chanes of reaching the top.
1706	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-08	Grenn needs a fucking statue in King's Landing.Â  True Hero #S4.E9neverforget
Â 
Knock down that Joffrey Wolfslayer shit and make a real monument.


NO. JOKE.Â 
I just remembered that Pyp and Grenn were put on a bus so to speak in the books. I guess it makes sense that Grenn got Noye'd and hes all the more awesome for it.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Also, I NEED Melisandre to burn that fucking owl next episode! That's like, her most badass moment ever


lel yiss.
1707	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-08	GUYS!!!
Did anyone notice Jon spit blood in styrs face in order to blind him/ kill him?!
Jon learned that from Karl at the battle at crasters! That scene had a purpose! Yay!


Yeaaahh... I remember Kit explaining in one of the teasers for this season that they would focus on Jon learning to "fight to win" instead of "fighting with honor" over the course of the season, and they had him fighting Styr playing will he said that, I was waiting for the moment he did something more "dirty" after his fight with Karl... As soon as he spit, I was like "Fock Yeah!"
Â 
By the way- Yes, I would have liked to see Stannis make it in to tonight's episode. I kind of figured he would be at the end, with his Big Damn Hero moment.
Â 
Also, I wish Leslie had gotten a few more last words with Jon, but not a huge deal. As mentioned, would have preferred to have him not know who the shooter was, or whether or not he may have been the shooter. But, it's T.V., they would have probably had to cut a lot of the focus they had on Rose during the battle to really pull off the suspense of Jon (and us) subconciously wondering- not knowing where Ygritte was, or whether or not she was alive. Maybe they could have kept the shooter a mystery, too. I don't foresee that being of huge consequence, though. Jon smiling, and her almost betraying a smile right before the arrow hit, kind of heartbreaking.
Â 
Over all, I still loved this episode. I'd have a hard time choosing between this and Blackwater, in my opinion. At this point, though, I've watched Blackwater a dozen times, it will take some more views of this particular episode to really say.
Â 
-I've always thought that Kit showed the most promise among the cast in sword-fighting (not necessarily because of the choreography he's gotten, just his athleticism), even seasons back, and he really did a great job in the fight against Styr...
-Alliser Thorne and Tormund's fight was great. I am glad that they kept Tormund alive, I would have been sad if that Bear-Porker's member hadn't lived to seduce another grizzly. "I SHOULD HAVE THROWN YOU FROM THE TOP OF THE WALL BOY!" Hopefully he gets over it as fast as he does in the books. I love friendly ole Tormund.
-I did like Aemon's little talk with Sam, despite it taking away from the action.
-R.I.P Grenn, one of the most heroic deaths in the show to date. R.I.P Pip, right when he found his balls.
-GHOST!
Â 
My mother was counting how many N.W. members died, too, by the way. It's probably due to how much they've mentioned having "just 100 brothers" left. There really are not too many left.
Â 
We'll see how this all plays out next week.
1708	Winterfell is Burning	2014-06-08	I want to see who's going to say with a straight face there's nothing wrong with Stannis' treatment on the show. They spend nearly 10 minutes on Sam and Gilly, yet the episode ends in an anti-climax because they can't have his big moment in an episode that is not already completely crowed.
1709	Marion	2014-06-08	this was just a crap, honestly i love all the chapters of Jon in the book, but this is depressing, the worst episode I've seen, Jon Snow simply is not worth to become the Lord Commander after this. I'm crying inside after watching this.
1710	Salad Days Saan	2014-06-08	- Samwell "You May Be Fucking Ten But Step the Fuck Up" Tarly.Â 


Â 
"Ten years old?Â  TIME TO BE A MAN."Â  The Ned would approve.Â  Sam Tarly's "honorary Stark" application should clear any day now.
1711	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	Yeah... right when Jon has almost drawn peace terms with Mance, then Stannis theÂ Menace comes storming in to save? the day... Tah tah taÂ Dah!Â  RedÂ Witch and all.Â  Should take about 5 min to cover thoroughly imo.Â But he will say "I dont phisically abuse my daughter" again at some point, so we should all be satisfied with the big bone thrown at us with such a good trait.
1712	Pearlthegirl	2014-06-08	I do understand what they intended and I wished they had done the better job. I am not complaining about Stannis, I am actually complaining of the episode itself. When you haven't made sure that your characters for such centric episode are fleshed out enough, you do have a problem in maintaining the attention for 50 minutes. This was like never ending marathon. I do wanted nice NW episode, I wanted it to be as epic as Blackwater, but it wasn't. It failed where it should have been 
Â 
Â 
Â 
This... I mean, the characters on the Wall are just group of extras, with exception of Sam and Jon... When you have this type of episode, you make sure you have enough to make it through the end. Blackwater had Tyrion, Sansa, Cersei, Hound, Bronn, all established characters. This one had nothing. It had Jon whose "learning to lead" path was done in such weird way that it is almost hysterical, and Sam who was more or less confused about what to do, with a deal of courage... The rest of gang is flat line... This just didn't push the right buttons, as the episode, not as adaptation.

You are not wrong in that they gave our brave boys no love throughout the season in order to build to this.  My opinion is they didn't need to "blow the Night's Watch wad" on the 9th episode with a Wall only episode.  It made for sloppy whole season pacing.  True that.  I can still appreciate the effort they finally got around to.  
I am one of those that was thinking a shark was getting jumped until around episode 5 or so.  Then they started to redeem themselves....in my eyes anyway.  
He held the gate.

Â 
Hrm, I assumed Jon's "peace talk"/suicide mission would end with Mance telling him to fuck off. But oh ho ho Mance might not kill him where he stands but his 90,000+ warriors/fishwives/ninjas/mammoths/huskies will. Jon realizes he's fucked, until a certain unit of barded destriers smashes through the forest. Fancy import destriers who don't stop for no fucking roots or potholes.

There's nuance there, but you won't see it if you hate the approach. Â My friends were curious about the giant opening the gate on his own, but then we thought about and came to a consensus. Â He was running on adrenaline after being injured and watching his fellow wildlings and giant buddy die, and his mammoth run off in agony. Â It's like when a normal human finds the strength to lift a car off of a loved one. Â If you paid the same person a $1000 to do it for sport, it wouldn't be possible, but the human body can do amazing things when it's running off of adrenaline. Â Imagine what a Giant can do in a similar situation. Â Just because a Giant could theoretically lift a gate like that under certain circumstances, why waste your energy when you can have a beast of burden perform the same task? Â Have the mammoth open the gate so you can save your energy for the actual attack at the gate. Â When plan A fails spectacularly, go for plan B and open that shit yourself, because you're a giant.


Â 
I don't hate the approach. I am not book purist, but this was just bad in terms of characterization. Entire season we have fillers, and now, we wonder why the crown jewel of the Wall subplot didn't work? The characters weren't fleshed out and we now wonder why it was out of pace. We keep Jon tapping in one line, and now suddenly we remembered he needs to be taking the control? This episode was the product of not thinking some things through.
Â 
As for the adrenaline... LOL... Nice way to fill the obvious plot hole. Congrats to you and your friendsÂ
1715	meeh	2014-06-08	Â 
Yeah cause you felt the same when he arrived at the wall in the books.

It's a tv show, right? On the show it would made an impression of being a cliche way to adapt a chapter because of the same timing, not to mention it is an episode 9, known for its "omfg" last minutes that are expected. There would be nothing epic about it, unlike in the books.
Splitting it was a good call, hope they didn't ruin it, though.Â

More character bias, why shouldn't Sam be fleshed out? Â George Martin made him a POV character after all.

I'll make it easier: Mance Rayder can not know if a giant can lift the gate. So he sends a mammoth to make sure the gate is indeed opened. It's war, you don't go for the minimum if you can use something better.
1718	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-08	Me too. This was the kind of passion and energy I expected from Oberyn during the fight, but didn't get it. Loved Grenn! Had goosebumps when they were reciting the vows.


Thought that scene was especially cheesy. I'm just not big on seeing the same thing twice if it didn't work great OR worked just well enough the first time, which it did...back in Season 1. Here it just sort of added to the overall laughable tone of the episode where there shouldn't have been one. Like seriously, give Grenn any other badass speech like the one that Ser Alliser gave. Making me care for Ser Alliser was an impressive feat; I was more worried for his safety in the Tormund fight than I was for Grenn's even though it was extremely obvious Grenn was doomed. Â I cared more about Ser Alliser surviving than I did Grenn.Â 
Â 
Aside from the technical aspects (brief Ghost-cam, brilliant aerial shots, scenes on top of the wall), Ser Alliser's talk with Jon on top of the Wall was the best moment of the episode for me. I thought Grenn's speech only rivaled Ygritte's death and the Sam-Gilly stuff in cheesiness tonight.

How is that a plot hole? Â If you have a book bag full of supplies you need to lug up the mountain, strap it into the donkey. Â If the donkey gets set on fire and runs away, you have to lug up yourself. Â If you have a beast of burden, take advantage of it so you can conserve energy.
1721	teej6	2014-06-08	Just saw it again and I liked it more the second time. I've fully recovered from the initial shock of no Stannis. And again, Kit did a fine job. He's beginning to look like LC. And this time around I didn't mind Ygritte's death scene much. Only wish they had built up the Wall story in prior episodes instead of all those damn fillers. And I'm looking forward to the scenes between Kit and Dillane in the next season. And I think I read somewhere Kit saying that he'll do something really out of character (paraphrasing) this season. I wonder what that could be coz he hasn't done anything out of character so far
1722	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-08	I wish all these Stannis cry babies would shut up. We needed a Gregor Clegane orgy with Ros's ghost, Ygritte, and Shae to bring the battle full circle.

I do at least. What are you on about?


Don't you remember when Gregor saved the Night's Watch single handedly? And then him, Ros's ghost, Ygritte's ghost, Ashara Dayne's ghost, and Lynanna had a giant orgy, causing the biggest fire the North had ever seen? This is a complete bastardization of the books by omitting the scene and I'm really tired of it. Gregor's agency was completely usurped. He should have at least been able to take control of the Watch and give us: "The Wall is yours Lord Snow" line, before killing all the giants and mamoths with a tooth pick.

1727	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-08	Â 
Agreed. Stannis will get his moment next episode.


Â 
Yeah, but it won't have quite the same effect, I feel. And there's gonna be a shitload of showstopping moments in the next episode that will steal his thunder.
Â 
I mean, would the ending of "Blackwater" would have been as great without Tywin and the Tyrells showing up? Personally, I don't think so
Â 
On the whole I thought the episode was great, but I think they really should have spread the battle throughout the season instead of doing it all (or most) at once

Â 
The mammoth was actually trying to remove the gate for good, the giant just lifted it enough to let himself in so he could get through to CB.
Â 
Their success depended on getting through the gate, the mammoth was gone so the next best thing is to get through the gate himself and help on the other side and eventually winch the gate up if they win.

Â 
So the election, whenever it comes, should be nice and tight.Â  Even though to the viewer's eye it looks like it should be a slam dunk for Jon.Â  It'll get the blood boiling.Â  Good, Good.

I know that he will show up next week, but seriously WHAT THE FUCK? Nobody will care next week! People will talk about Tyrion and Lady Stone Heart and Khaleesi (somehow)! His arrival was going to be an awesome ending! Based on the preview, people can see someone else attacking Mance and it won't be a surprise like it was in the books! FUCK D&D! We have irrefutable evidence that they HATE STANNIS! Someone try to defend the writers on this! I dare you!

1734	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-08	The moment I loved (for a mix of humor and cringing) was Jon's face getting smashed into an anvil. Shit man! Then he regained...usurped...stole...backhanded his street cred by spitting blood in Styr's face. Though I was a bit perplexed as to how he didn't have two split lips and a tooth or two skittering off Styr's rock-hard facial scarring.Â 
Â 
If the dragon preteens are chained up next season, can they please splurge on direwolf SFX? Ghost running into the fray was awesome but I wanted MOAR carnage. Give me something like the Princess Mononoke scene with the wolves tearing stuff up.Â

When Jon becomes leader, he'll still have friends around him to send off even without Grenn and Pyp.Â  He'll still send Sam to the Citadel and Dolorous Edd will likely end up with command of his own garrison after tonight's episode.Â  I see Olly moving into the Satin role as Jon's steward and that should be an interesting dynamic between the two now.Â

1739	JonInVa	2014-06-08	I still say a high, wide shot of Jon walking away from the wall, moving on to show Mance's army, to finally zoom away to land close and tight behind a man on a large white horse looking down upon the entire scene below from afar would have been an epic ending.

Wait a minute...didnt that kinda happen in the books, but off screen? Like a giant gets through the gate and Noye murders the fuck out of it but gets murdered as well. We only saw the aftermath...? Im pretty sure it happened...
But yeah, the Mammoth was there as a gate puller. Yer right.
1743	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-08	I don't even but I'd totally watch that


Don't you remember where Ros tells Gregor: "Don't leave me alone in this world." And then he fights with everything he has left to prevent Mance from getting through the Wall? Even at one point warging into a bear before killing 50,000 of the wildlings? I'm really tired of Stannis getting so much credit for this battle when we all know who the real hero is.Â

Â 
They were trying to get the mammoth to rip the gate down to flood it for everybody to rush the tunnel. Â Again, it's a beast of burden situation. Â The mammoth is the strongest of the bunch, so have it rip the gate down, that plan failed, so the remaining giant lifts the gate and charges by himself. Â Just because he had the strength to lift the gate doesn't make it a plot hole. Â Giants are strong, but they have a mammoth, so have the beast rip down the gate and the giants can lead the attack through the tunnel. Â

Yeah, I know that... But, one has to wonder why two giants didn't just lift the gate and people made it permanently opened? This was a plot hole if there ever was one...


Â 
If they prop it open then the NW could have destroyed it and shut the gate...they thought they had 1000 men remember...they weren't to know the NW wouldn't surge into the tunnel and burn the tree or whatever they had holding it.
Â 
If they pull the gate completely off then there's nothing the NW can do to fix it before Mance gets through.
Â 
The only thing better than a gate being held open is no gate at all.

Â 
And this was a good Jon Snow episode? I have no problem with Stannis not being there, I have not problem with the deaths, but this was epic failure. This was like wannabe-Blackwater, and ended somewhere in confusion of what makes a good episode with an epic battle. Nothing here was faithful to the books, and that even isn't the issue here. The issue is that this sucked as the episode, not as the adaptation. This was badly constructed, unimaginative, humorless, uninspiring... There was CGI on some moments, but at the end, nothing that would live up to "as big as Tv gets"
Â

Wow.
1747	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-08	Is it just me or is HBO making it entirely more convincing by the episode that Jon actually does die as a result of his knife wounds? Seriously, the worst treated character in the show and his stupidity is magnified tenfold in the show, which has also decided to take away his only decent quality (skilled swordsman) and made him into a laughing stock as well.
Â 
The changes would make a whole heck of a lot more sense if he is indeed dead, despite our prior knowledge that the way Martin wrote that chapter makes it unlikely. But I almost feel it would be more believable now with the way the show has made his character out to be, even more of a dolt (somehow) than he is in the books. And I'm a big Jon fan, for the record.
1748	Zarafrustra	2014-06-08	The episode didn't show one scene and suddenly it's the worst show on television.


Â 
I don't care that much for the missing scenes and all that, but to me this show has a lot of weak links and is definately not one of the better HBO shows, at least not in the top5.Â 
Â 
People must know that some of us have been moderately critical of the show since s01e01. Some decisions are really not understandable, like how maester Cressen died (I think they fucked up who drinks first) and why make an abrupt ending like that.Â 
Â 
I want this show to be really good. In some instances it is. Today was more or less a good episode. But damn the pacing, the storytelling, the expositions, the unneeded nudity and some boring storylines..
Â 
edit: I can deal with the budget limitations...but not when it comes to storytelling.

1749	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-08	WTF!!!! They had time for Sam and Jon talking about sex, but NO STANNIS!?? Not even a minute? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME! This was the only shot of Stannis being the star of an episode! His only shot! Dany and Tyrion and almost everyone else has been the star of at least one episode! I know that he will show up next week, but seriously WHAT THE FUCK? Nobody will care next week! People will talk about Tyrion and Lady Stone Heart and Khaleesi (somehow)! His arrival was going to be an awesome ending! Based on the preview, people can see someone else attacking Mance and it won't be a surprise like it was in the books! FUCK D&D! We have irrefutable evidence that they HATE STANNIS! Someone try to defend the writers on this! I dare you!


Cleary Stannis willl star in an episode in Season 6 where he laughs at Theon for having no dick for half an hour.
1750	Newstar	2014-06-08	Someone pointed out in the Val thread over on the Casting board that Tormund's capture by the NW pretty much renders Val's mission to retrieve him unnecessary and therefore suggests that she'll be left out of the adaptation. Someone else pointed out that Pyp and Grenn being killed off suggested that D&D were making way for new characters at the Wall...so I don't know what to think, LOL.
1751	DaveyJoe	2014-06-08	Â 
Yeah, I know that... But, one has to wonder why two giants didn't just lift the gate and people made it permanently opened? This was a plot hole if there ever was one...


Â 
How is that a plot hole? Â Two giants could have lifted the gate for what? Â A mammoth to lead the charge through the tunnel lead by regular wildlings? Â The beast of burden is there to provide brute strength, the rest are there for their skills in battle.. Â Let the mammoth rip the gate down so the rest can save their strength for actual fighting. Â Nothing about this is a plot hole.

Agreed. The point is to open the tunnel, allowing many more fighters to get into the tunnel and away from oil bombs and arrows in order open the inner gates for the main horde.

Pyp's death came out of nowhere but Grenn was obviously Donal Noye so no surprise there. A couple of changes were just strange like that giant metal hook built and the guys repelling down the Wall... but I liked the episode.Â 
Â 
I wonder how Slynt's cowardice is going to come back on him. I wish there was more Ghost. He killed like one dude and that was it.Â

Â 

Do it yourself, lazybones.
1761	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-08	Badass episode. Loved everything about it, t'was even better than last week's episode. Only thing that sucked was them breakin' up the NW bros. Grenn and Pyp were awesome. It ain't gonna be the same without 'em.
Â 
This episode made up for the slow and dull moments of earlier episodes.
1762	clawson24	2014-06-08	Was anyone else annoyed that Jon abandoned the battle to cradle a dying Ygritte in his arms? Definitely not Lord Commander behavior. He could have saved one of his brothers in that time. Why couldn't their tearful goodbyes have happened a couple of minutes later after the battle was over? Why did the kid have to kill her instead of a random arrow? Seemed far to convenient.
Â 
At this rate, folks who haven't read the books will have no reason to think that Jon deserves to be LC. They'll probably accept it because he's a main character, but isn't Game of Thrones supposed to better than relying on TV tropes? Thorne seemed quite competent in this episode. Why should the brothers of the Night's Watch pick Jon over him? Other than that he's young, good looking and the main character.
Â 
From a dramatic standpoint, Stannis should have showed up, but from a narrative standpoint it wouldn't have made sense. The only way it could have worked is if parts of the battle (like the initial raid) had happened in prior episodes, which would have been a better choice. I've had serious problems with pacing in this season, as well as the effect many of the show-only scenes have had on the narrative. They could have taken out the pointless Craster's Keep sequence and spent more time on the lead-up to the battle, perhaps even had Ygritte's death occur in an earlier episode.
Â 
At its best, this season has still been great, but based on how the writers have struggled to weave together a narrative/prioritize in a way that makes sense even with ample book material to draw on, I"m having serious doubts about next season when they'll have to make up even more material and pull of some extreme narrative gymnastics in order for the timeline to make sense.Â 


Â 
Because Thorne will likely die from his wounds or be otherwise incapable of leading the NW any longer. Jon was incredibly heroic and competent throughout the episode, apart from a single 30 second sequence. They traded dramatic effect for realism. If you think that completely annihilates his character and his leadership credentials, you're nuts, especially in the company of other men with just as many if not significantly more faults.
1763	D-Shiznit	2014-06-08	Man that scene where Grenn rallies his crew with the Oath.......Â  Chilling to the bone.

Huh? Kit/Jon looked like a badass and was holding his own against a guy who was like 7 feet tall with a 5 foot axe. He got disarmed and still managed to kill him. Every swordsman has his match and Jon is far from a legendary swordsman, even in the books. Very good, but he did get his ass beat by Mance.
Also, every characters strengths and flaws are going to be magnified on the show, because you can't get in their head like you do in the books. Jon is stupid and doesn't always think things through in the books, he is also well liked by his brothers and is a good leader, the show accurately portrays that.

1768	Klavpod	2014-06-08	Stannis is just one piece of the puzzle. We all know he'll get his save-the-day scene, whether it was at the end of this episode or in the season finale shouldn't be a deal breaker. Seems silly to bash the show for that decision before it plays out.
I was initially disappointed it didn't happen in E.09 but now show watchers have a full week to worry about what happens at the wall which is a very good thing. In my view, this was a bittersweet victory as (whether you agree or not) it was made abundantly clear that the NW cannot hold back the Wildlings from many more attacks. It wasn't a, "Hooray! We won" type thing. Just ask Edd.
I think holding this scene off for another week will actually improve the Unsullied's view of Stannis. He will arrive in awesome fashion right when he does in the books. Being upset that he wasn't "the star" of this episode is taking an extremely narrow and personal view IMO.
In hindsight, I'm glad that Stannis's deus-ex-machina arrival didn't occur at the end of E.09 because then it would just seem like a Blackwater retread of Tywin and that isn't great storytelling.
Also, everyone upset that the show will have to push some things into Season 5 should be ecstatic as we are all painfully aware of the inevitability of the show surpassing the books. Any "filler" is a win for us, I think.
I feel for the Stannis fans who were mad that the show didn't fulfill their hopes, but I think in time, most of us will see that this decision will prove far more beneficial to the story as a whole... The story being the tv adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, not the tv adaptation of A Stannis of a Stannis and Stannis.
1769	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-08	Huh? Kit/Jon looked like a badass and was holding his own against a guy who was like 7 feet tall with a 5 foot axe.

1770	clawson24	2014-06-08	Â 
I suspect you're right.Â  There's too much to pack into next week's episode without Lady Stoneheart.Â  I think the season will end with Dany's dragons being chained up.


Â 
Dany's dragons being chained up is probably the 5th or 6th most dramatic thing that will happen next episode. If it is last I will finally join the anti-D&D fan club. I'd take Bloodraven/CotF, Tyrion/Shae, Tyrion/Tywin, Stannis, Stoneheart all over that ending in a heartbeat.

Â 
Okay, that's a little strong- it actually WAS a strong scene, in and of itself.Â 
Â 
At the same time... Its like the 5th time they have used this trope; they hardly ever have a Night-Watch conflict/argument without regurgitating the Oath. Â Its not that the oath has lost meaning, but it seems like its the ONLY way the show knows how to conclude a scene involving the NW. Â ITs as if they have a saying in their writing room- "When in Doubt, quote the oath."
Â 
Had this been the only time they had done it, it would have made a better scene. Â
1773	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-08	Okay I'm sorry, last thing guys, don't we think that Ser Gregor's agency was slightly usurpered when Alliser Thorne didn't say: "The Wall is yours Lord Gregor?" I'm just a little distraught. And bear in mind, this is before Ros's ghost holds him and says: "Don't leave me alone in this world." I just think Gregor's agency isn't being taken seriously by most readers and I really think that we need to focus less on stuff like Stannis, Grenn, and Pyp, and more on the lack of Gregor. We didn't even get the iconic chant of "Mountain! Mountain! Mountain!" at the end of the episode.
1774	Salad Days Saan	2014-06-08	Game Of Thrones has given us many great .gifs over the years.Â  I know I'll always remember where I was the first time I saw "ramsay wiggles a sausage at Theon".
Â 
However, THIS.Â  Beautiful in its simplicity.

1775	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-08	Â 
Did you actually see him fighting...he was demolishing people?
Â 
I seem to remember even the great Jaime Lannister got disarmed and captured at Whispering Wood. No matter how good you are you can still be taken down..we've seen that numerous times...Barristan Selmy injured at the Trident, Jaime captured, Arthur Dayne killed.


I should rephrase it to anyone skilled. He's essentially demolishing peasants before he fights Styr; the average Wildling is cake-fodder for Jon. As soon as he gets a somewhat skilled opponent (Karl, Styr) he's disarmed with relative ease to build "drama" that we don't really need. I'm not buying that he loses the sword again only so that as soon as he finishes Styr, which still was a decent fight, he can be unarmed when Ygritte has the chance to kill him to again build more "drama". He's laughably bad at fighting in the show compared to how he is in the books and again, that's kind of his only good quality.Â 
Â 
Plus having him mope around to the extreme and then just decide "My woman's dead so fook it, I'm going on a suicide mission" instead of just having a wounded Ser Alliser, or even Slynt, get one minute to order Jon to treat with Mance was just such a stupid plot. Seriously, they're making it very, very convincing that he is exceptionally daft and that easy to write off when the time comes. Show Jon basically deserves it already.
1776	of man and wolf	2014-06-08	Just watched it for a second time. Noticed in the guest starring roles during the credits that Ian Whyte was in the EP. He was the Mountain during season 2. Wonder who he played? I kinda wanna go back and see if I can spot him.

That was the most badass scythe since Buffy and Grim Fandango. They couldn't have installed a couple more though?Â   I guess it was decided the same time the Night's Watch dropped collision insurance to save some money.Â

Â I dont sit there watching episodes with my books on hand as if I have a checklist going over each scene and line to make sure it matches or is included. Â You should let yourself just watch it as a separate entity. Â It is an adaptation. Â We already know there will be changes. Â To say this isnt one of the better shows or even in the top 5 is scary. Â So many of my friends never read the books and whenever we discuss the show their eyes light up and say how amazing it was. Â Thats because theyre not watching saying wait hey hey that guy was supposed to be standing to Jon's left not the right!! Why is his hair so nicely done that doesnt make sense for a battle!! God I hate this theyre ruining it! Â Anybody not enjoying this show I wish could forget they ever read the books and just watch it unsullied. Â Maybe you guys wouldnt be so stuck up about it and could just be entertained. Â This has been the highest rated HBO show of all time. Â The only real show ahead of it including network shows would be The Walking Dead and some others. Â Averaged 18+ million/episode, Â sounds like its a pretty good show to me. Â Rotten Tomatoes has like a minimum 95 percent approval rating every time. Â Relax and enjoy the ride despite the changes and differences please. Â Sorry for no punctuation/grammatical errors this is on my phone.
1781	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-09	Alliser Thorne was okay for me. He did what he was suppose to do/what was expected, or else he'd be hiding in the cupboard w/ Gilly & the babe. I guess we can safely assume there's no way Slynt can make a bid for LC? Or Thorne for that matter he's seemingly too injured they had to drag him off.
I agree w/ all those who were wondering about the Night's watchmens numbers... I was sitting there like wait how many could there possibly be anymore?
Poor Pyp I did not see that coming. As for Grenn, the Donal Noye moment didn't even register for me at the time. I just knew the other 5 brothers would die and Grenn would make it out. RIP
I was really hoping they did a good job w/ the Jon and Ygritte death scene, which I think they did, except for the fact that it happened in the middle of battle! Anyone could've just walked by and nicked Jon's head off.
I was really needing more Ghost.
Maester Aemon was such a delight.
I hope they start calling that cute little boy who killed Ygritte Satin. Did you see him over in the corner, ears covered, blood all over his face & crying. Man this kid has had such a raw deal these past week/s. 
Ughhh that huge Thenn guy (Alabaster Seal) was really tryna f**k up Jon's face huh? Why are people always trying to f**k up this young man's face.
Tormund captured... Book canon? I can't recall
John Bradley for MVP this episode I really enjoyed his performance as well as the material he was given.

1783	clawson24	2014-06-09	No one complaining about the lack of Stannis (as far as I have read) has said a word about the battle being underwhelming on its own, though killing off two of the established and recognizable Wall characters isn't going to help any next season.
Â 
Our issue is more with the narrative and wasted time on other irrelevant issues. I'm a Stannis fan, though I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, and this episode should have been his moment by rights, as Episode 9 of Season 2 was Tywin's moment.


Â 
They will be replaced by Stannis's presence at the Wall for a time, probably Davos's presence at the Wall for a time, members of Stannis's army, wildlings that become increasingly important (Tormund, etc.) Was sad to Grenn and Pyp go but the Wall will have plenty of players next season.

I have to say that was majorly dissapointing.Â

ETA: Now that I have calmed down a little I will say this was a pretty damn good episode, but I still believe it would have been a much better idea to include the Stannis ending. The 10th episode will be epic, but possibly a little too crammed now.Â

1793	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-09	Correct me if I'm wrong but the Ygritte death part in the book, she was talking about castles right?Â 


She asks if Castle Black is a real Castle( calling back to that windmill she mistaked for a castle) , when Jon says it is, she starts with the "Do you remember that cave?"
1794	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-09	Question, how many men the NW had IN Books at this time?
1795	tmug	2014-06-09	I wonder how Slynt's cowardice is going to come back on him. I wish there was more Ghost. He killed like one dude and that was it.Â 
I expected Stannis to show up too but they didn't get to that part of the book yet.Â  


Â 
Slynt's cowardice is the ultimate lead to his beheading by Jon, that is the perfect lead on to it...
1796	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-09	Is it just me or is HBO making it entirely more convincing by the episode that Jon actually does die as a result of his knife wounds? Seriously, the worst treated character in the show and his stupidity is magnified tenfold in the show, which has also decided to take away his only decent quality (skilled swordsman) and made him into a laughing stock as well.
Â 
The changes would make a whole heck of a lot more sense if he is indeed dead, despite our prior knowledge that the way Martin wrote that chapter makes it unlikely. But I almost feel it would be more believable now with the way the show has made his character out to be, even more of a dolt (somehow) than he is in the books. And I'm a big Jon fan, for the record.


I think thats youÂ reading way too much into things.Â

And in there lies the rub....
Â 
The truly great shows of the modern era - Deadwood, Madmen, The Wire, Breaking Bad - didn't need to repeat themselves. Â You either 'got it' or you didn't. Â The show runners said it ONCE and then it was up to the viewer to keep up. Â No spoon-feeding story lines. Â

Giant Wall Scythe of Doom is now Westeros's most bad*** execution device.
1799	pleonasm	2014-06-09	Fascinating that the best fight scene in history of the show was in this episode and not the prior one. Kudos to Kit, the other actor, and the stunt team. That was exceptionally well done.
Â 
It was technically a pretty exceptional episode. I can't really quibble with any of the book changes. I really did like how Thorne had some redeeming moments. It definitely fleshed out a character who has been exceptionally one note since season 1.Â 
Â 
That said, the decision to make this episode 9, with all the associated filler (i.e. Craster's Keep), really undermined some of the story-lines. The Ygritte/Jon soap opera felt a little flat, by no fault of the actors, but rather that the fact Ygritte was a non entity for most of the season other than her brief appearance last week and in the opening episode.
1800	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-09	Thats because theyre not watching saying wait hey hey that guy was supposed to be standing to Jon's left not the right!! Why is his hair so nicely done that doesnt make sense for a battle!! God I hate this theyre ruining it! Â 


Â 
No one is doing this. You are glossing over why people (legitimately) are complaining about the show. There have been changes and omissions from the source material that have been terrible and nonsensical and 100% worthy of criticism. I know that they can't 100% adapt the books and that's not what I expect. Some of the things HBO have done are noticeably bad though.

1804	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-09	I was really digging Alliser this episode. It was a nice callback to his "do you fucking know what it's like to get stuck North of the wall and do some Hannibal shit just to survive?" speech in season 1. A good leader out in the field, not a good ruler. Then Slynt's flaccid "meep!" had me rolling. No giants, NOPE. We got a Mountain and he's just a shade shorter! But yeah, Alliser marching down like a boss because shit was about to get real was A+ in my book.Â

Fantastic analysis, well done. The show has a way of magnifying poor decisions made by characters and making them blatantly obvious if you know where to look when it comes back to bite them later on. Jon's never been a big favorite for plenty of people and is considered the least interesting lead character by most critics, sullied or unsullied. Jon's options for living, other than the fact that the knives were never in overly vulnerable locations were never great. I wouldn't buy the warg-into-Ghost plot for a second; that would just be a major cop-out on GRRM's part.Â 
Â 
All I'm saying is that D&D are doing a great job of making Jon as forgettable as possible; it's been that way from the get go, it was that way through this season, which was supposed to be his season, so if when the time comes and Jon is stabbed as it's likely we'll see it on the show and learn his fateÂ before we learn it from the books I wouldn't be surprised at all to find out he really is dead.

Me too dude. I was just a little put off by Ser Gregor not saving Alliser and putting Tormund in the brig like he does towards the end of SoS. I am hoping we might get some mention of Gregor healing Alliser from his wounds in episode 10 though, before he treats with Mance.

Â 
Yeah I totally get that non-readers love the show. Every unsullied who asks me if they should get the books I immediately shoot them down. I tell them straight up they will get significantly more enjoyment out of GRRM's story if they just watch the show and never bother with the books. For TV it's an awesome show.Â As a book reader I already know they could have done a better job. Sometimes I wish I didn't read the books so that I could enjoy the TV series more.
Â 
I know they cannot include everything but I do expect a reasonable amount of quality. They only get one shot at this. When they cut out important book material, interpret it poorly, waste air time on character development for shitty background characters, create original, extremely lame characters unnecessarily, make other characters heroes and other villains out of bias, ect., that's not cool.

Im pretty sure thats still just your opinion, mate. Unsullied viewers dont see Jon as forgettable, just a little dull in some areas. This episode was definitely one of those that has Jon in the forefrontÂ reminding us what hes capable of doing.Â People are gonna wanna see more Jon now. Especially since things are going to get interesting for him. If you think people wont be upset when his stabbing occurs, you are in for a rude awakening.

Â 
Agreed. When I found myself actually cheering for Alliser Thorne (which I'd never expected to do) I knew it was a great episode. The Night's Watch was finally shown with all the epicness it deserves. The way the NW's vows bound all the men together during the battle was able to give characters who are not particularly favourites to the audience (which is Ser Alliser's case) a quality that is, in my opinion, in the center of what makes the whole series awesome: the fact all the characters have multiple facets and aren't totally bad or good.
1825	Caerl Targaryen	2014-06-09	I wouldn't buy the warg-into-Ghost plot for a second; that would just be a major cop-out on GRRM's part.And yet the prologue for ADWD has a warg doing exactly that. So it wouldn't be like GRRM pulled it out of nowhere. He devoted an entire prologue to someone doing that sort of thing.
1826	wallofice	2014-06-09	I didn't feel like the battle at the wall earned a full episode the way Blackwater did, and I certainly don't think it needed to stretch out into the finale as well. I wish we had seen the Night's Watch making actual preparations in previous episodes instead of just telling us how many wildlings there are without ever showing us more than Ygritte's band of murderers.
Â 
I don't have strong feelings about Stannis, but his arrival would have made for a much stronger episode in my opinion. Not to mention that despite the previously reminding me that Mance exists, I almost ended up believing that Tormund would just replace him since there was no sign of anyone caring about him until the last few minutes.

Â 
In defense of D&D (shit, I can't believe I'm saying that), Jon Snow the character suffers on GOT and also in the books, because his story arc ,at least to date, is a fantasy trope writ large. He is Luke Skywalker and every other fantasy / Joseph Campbell type hero character every written. Its is easier to empathize with him with the books -- partly Â due to the POV structure of books, but a trope is a trope. And that does him no favors...
Â 
That being said, Season 2 really undermined the character in a significant way, and I don't think the character every truly recovered - at least on the tv show.

You call Stannis' arrival the most epic moment yet it doesn't even happen at the end of aSoS. See, things that don't occur right at the end of something can still be epic. I was really looking forward to the Stannis scene but now I'm just looking forward to it next week. Having it not be the final scene of the episode doesn't make me like it any less, just like how it wasn't the final chapter in aSoS doesn't make me like it less.


Â 
It does make it less though. If the last shot of this episode was triumphant music playing while Stannis proudly charges through his line of knights having just saved the Wall, it'd be stuck in viewers minds all week and would be a massive talking point and memorable moment. Now, it will more than likely be lost in the fray of one of the most noteworthy-moment packed episodes in TV history. Having it next week doesn't make the actual action of Stannis arriving there less cool, it will just affect the way it sticks in viewers' consciousness.

I'm hoping it's confirmed for a deleted scene on the bluray boxset. Gregor has a deep impact on Tormund's later character development and I'd be pretty upset if they didn't have their bromance before Gregor heads off towards Wintefell to defeat the Boltons.

My point is that it'sÂ exceptionally clear already that Jon makes poor decisions a little too often. HBO is going to blow that up like crazy and now that the unsullied have seen that happen to chars they care about many times, they're not going to be anywhere near as surprised when Jon gets it. You're in for a rude awakening yourself if you don't give the unsullied enough credit to be able to figure out that once Jon starts fucking up all the time he's going to get beetle-smashed. And that's the point; D&D are already hammering home that Jon can be gone that quickly, whereas with Rob or Cat or Oberyn or Ned or anyone else the Unsullied cared about it was so much lessÂ blatantlyÂ obvious. I just don't think that the fact that D&D are shipping it so hard this early is a good sign. I'll respectfully agree to disagree with you moving forward.

I was bored senseless by Jon until ADWD. Subsequent rereads I like him more because I can see the buildup better, but he's a character I've found more entertaining in forbidden and notably fecking immoral castaway...stuff.Â

Â 
I sure hope so! If it's a toss-up between Foucault introspection and Angela Carter joie de vivre, I'll go with the latter every time! It's going to be a million kinds of epic when Gregor comes across Ramsay in a snowy evil place, the Bastard having cornered Jeyne, and yanks him off with a velvety baritone "Why is it I'm always rescuing Starks?" Of course he understood the true deception, but in a zenith of lemming-incomprehensible moral complexity he saw the need to keep Jeyne's secret safe.Â

1838	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I want to see who's going to say with a straight face there's nothing wrong with Stannis' treatment on the show. They spend nearly 10 minutes on Sam and Gilly, yet the episode ends in an anti-climax because they can't have his big moment in an episode that is not already completely crowed.*Straight face*There's nothing wrong with Stannis' treatment on the show.

I wouldn't buy the warg-into-Ghost plot for a second; that would just be a major cop-out on GRRM's part.Â 
Â 
All I'm saying is that D&D are doing a great job of making Jon as forgettable as possible; it's been that way from the get go, it was that way through this season, which was supposed to be his season, so if when the time comes and Jon is stabbed as it's likely we'll see it on the show and learn his fateÂ before we learn it from the books I wouldn't be surprised at all to find out he really is dead.  
Up until this episode, perhaps, D&D handled Jon Snow's character badly. Although it wasn't too bad in season 1. But why do you think Jon Snow seemed liked an idiot in this episode? If it for his decision to go out and meet with Mance, I think it was explained well. He tells Sam they are fighting a losing battle and there's no other option. They even imply that he doesn't know what he hopes to achieve but he sees no other alternative. He's met Mance and explains to Sam that it's Mance that holds the Wildlings together. Granted they didn't flesh out Jon's and Mance's relationship well in the prior season but I don't see how Jon going to meet with Mance makes him an idiot.
1840	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-09	WhatÂ Â  Ser Gregor you're talking about???


I don't normally spoil stuff for Unsullied viewers, since you're clearly behind on the books, but after Ser Gregor gouges out Ser Oberyn's eyes and crushes his skull he seeks redemption for his life of savagery by saving the Night's Watch at Castle Black. After nearly single handedly defeating all of Mance's wildingling troops, (minus the Weeper's faction) he seeks to rescue Arya from Ramsay and defeat the Bolton army at Winterfell. Him and Jon Snow develop a tense, but heartfelt bromance, that leads to Gregor gaining the respect and loyalty of the Northern Mountain clans, (fitting no?) before marching against Roose and Ramsay. I haven't seen how it plays out in Winds of Winter, but I just haven't really figured out how the Mountain is going to become "The Mountain who Cared", due to his abscence this episode.
1841	ejhawman	2014-06-09	Well, I'm getting a vibe that D&D are going seriously off the rails here. Ygritte took this long to die, Pyp and Grenn dead, and NO STANNIS? WTF?Â  
Â 
This battle was supposed to have started two episodes ago and been part of a running background to events elsewhere. Not agreeing with the management at all.
1842	teej6	2014-06-09	Im pretty sure thats still just your opinion, mate. Unsullied viewers dont see Jon as forgettable, just a little dull in some areas. This episode was definitely one of those that has Jon in the forefrontÂ reminding us what hes capable of doing.Â People are gonna wanna see more Jon now. Especially since things are going to get interesting for him. If you think people wont be upset when his stabbing occurs, you are in for a rude awakening. The unsullied are going toÂ flip the fuck out over that.Â 
^ This
1843	Into the Weirwood	2014-06-09	And yet the prologue for ADWD has a warg doing exactly that. So it wouldn't be like GRRM pulled it out of nowhere. He devoted an entire prologue to someone doing that sort of thing.


Â 
Not really relevant to the discussion, but that prologue was one of my favourite chapters from all the books. It was a let down when they killed Varamyr Sixskins ahead of time on the TV series and now just replaced him with a Thenn warg. I do understand why it was done though, just thought they could have explored Varamyr's character a little more.

Damn. And I've also heard he's actually a secret Targaryen.
1846	clawson24	2014-06-09	I think Pyp and Grenn dying was fitting (but I kinda wish Pyp survived). Grenn's death was really special. In GoT, very few die in such a heroic manner. Most deaths are grisly and leave a bitter feeling (ala Ned, RW, the Viper and most minor characters).
Grenn's scene was so great...better than any role he could have if he had lived on.


Â 
Absolutely agreed. I thought him leading the recitation of the NW vows while a freaking 18 foot tall Giant stormed through the tunnels towards them was one of the most epic things in the show's history.

Varamyr hasn't been on the show, I can only assume you're thinking of Orell from season 3? Â Varamyr is in a casting call for the 5th season, so he'll be introduced next year!
1848	teej6	2014-06-09	My point is that it'sÂ exceptionally clear already that Jon makes poor decisions a little too often. HBO is going to blow that up like crazy and now that the unsullied have seen that happen to chars they care about many times, they're not going to be anywhere near as surprised when Jon gets it. You're in for a rude awakening yourself if you don't give the unsullied enough credit to be able to figure out that once Jon starts fucking up all the time he's going to get beetle-smashed. And that's the point; D&D are already hammering home that Jon can be gone that quickly, whereas with Rob or Cat or Oberyn or Ned or anyone else the Unsullied cared about it was so much lessÂ blatantlyÂ obvious. I just don't think that the fact that D&D are shipping it so hard this early is a good sign. I'll respectfully agree to disagree with you moving forward.
Seriously! Where are getting this 'Jon fucking up all the time' from?

1851	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-09	Up until this episode, perhaps, D&D handled Jon Snow's character badly. Although it wasn't too bad in season 1. But why do you think Jon Snow seemed liked an idiot in this episode? If it for his decision to go out and meet with Mance, I think it was explained well. He tells Sam they are fighting a losing battle and there's no other option. They even imply that he doesn't know what he hopes to achieve but he sees no other alternative.

Granted they didn't flesh out Jon's and Mance's relationship well in the prior season but I don't see how Jon going to meet with Mance makes him an idiot.


I'm not saying it wasn't explained well since it's quite obvious that the dumbing-down is paramount to storylines on GoT because of simple realities. Yes, I think Jon going on a suicide mission is stupid when it literally would have taken as much time or less for him to be ordered by Slynt or even Thorne to go treat with Mance instead. That's a realistic complaint. Jon looks amazingly petty and stupid and the dumbing down is so over the top that it's nearly unbearable when after Ygritte dies in the show his resolve is just, "Well fook it if I kill Mance we might have a chance"; all this does is achieve's a full-circle affect to Jon and Mance's first meeting in the show when Mance asks Jon why he wants to join the free folk and after giving the unsatisfactory answer Mance says something along the lines of, "No, I think you want to be a hero.".
Â 
That's what having suicide-mission Jon accomplishes, one shitty full-circle arc instead of the potential plot advancement that would have been achieved by him being order by Slynt, continuing the disdain for the man who's cowardice was a high note this episode, or even having the order come from Ser Alliser which would have been a nice touch and complimentary piece to his line which was essentially, "After the battle we'll go on hating each other but right now I need you and you need me."
Â 
Jon meeting with Mance obviously does not make him an idiot. Jon meeting with Mance under the suicide-plan is just the dullest and dumbest you can make his plot and story out to be.

1853	clawson24	2014-06-09	lmao! <3Â 
Â 
Yeah. It was a great episode to expand on the Wall and show us the NW holding together even after so much.Â 
Â 
Do most of you watch with unsullied? Im kinda guessing not from some of the reactions in here. My mother was literally bouncing all over the room going "omfg! OH MAN! DO IT! JON!!! SOMEONE END THAT GUY! (Tormund) OMG!!! WOOOOAHHH! PYP! YGRITTE! OH NO!!" It was really special and fun.Â 


Â 
I watch with 5 or 6 people each week -- 2 of which have read the books, the others haven't. There were copious amounts of cheering, shouting, laughing, etc. during the Giants/Mammoths intro, the build up to the Grenn/Giant tunnel encounter, Styr's death, the Scythe, etc. Was a really, really fun episode to watch with a group.
1854	PhoenixFlame	2014-06-09	Heh, my Unsullied father called me up after. He's only done that for the Hannibal season 2 finale and the Red Wedding.Â
1855	When Harry met Sansa	2014-06-09	Seriously! Where are getting this 'Jon fucking up all the time' from?


Have you not read ADwD? That's where "Jon fucking up all the time" comes from......
1856	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-09	Â 
I sure hope so! If it's a toss-up between Foucault introspection and Angela Carter joie de vivre, I'll go with the latter every time! It's going to be a million kinds of epic when Gregor comes across Ramsay in a snowy evil place, the Bastard having cornered Jeyne, and yanks him off with a velvety baritone "Why is it I'm always rescuing Starks?" Of course he understood the true deception, but in a zenith of lemming-incomprehensible moral complexity he saw the need to keep Jeyne's secret safe.Â 


Now you're catching on! I for one am voting that Gregor wrote the Pink Letter, before singlehandedly winning the Battle on the Ice against the Freys, in addition to rescuing Jeyne Poole. But the question becomes, how can Gregor's redemption arc appear on the show without his interactions with Tormund, Alliser, Gilly, and Jon Snow? Also, based on DnD's poor interpretation of the text we might never get quotes such as: "I had the cart before the horse," the Mountain said. "I was trying to win the throne to save the Kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the Kingdom to win the Throne." This quote definitely ties in with the idea that Gregor is a secret Targ, and I'm wondering if maybe him and Dany might even join forces come A Dream of Spring? We'll have to see though, because I for one am disgusted by this complete disrespect regarding his agency, autonomy, self-independence, and nuance in the show.

Wow you are reallyÂ upset.Â 
Its not obvious at all that Jon might get iced. Seriously, its not. Im saying that as a book reader, its not obvious. Jon has been depicted as the voice of reason this season against guys like Slynt and Thorne. His decision to go route out Craster's was seen as an honorable one by a lot of the Watch. His decision to meet with Mance and not being ordered to, is in line with his crushing feelings over Ygritte's death in the show. Which, if anything, is an indication heÂ isnt gonna die because heroes who do that never get owned. Its a trope.Â 
I think im giving more credit to the unsullied than you are. If i was unsullied and watching the show, id never guess that Jon is going die or even fail in this current mission. I wouldnt know about Stannis' coming (but i would wonder cuz Stannis said he would head North) so i wouldnt know that thats how Jon gets out. But i would assume he would get out because of how his character is portrayed. (The only honorable guy besides Sam in the Watch really.) And the lingering question about Jon's parents. I would not assume as an unsullied that that would go unanswered because of character death. (cuz that would be shit writing. Hence why i dont think Jon is dead in the books.) Just as i would never assume Tyrion is going to die if i hadnt read the books. My unsullied friends know Tyrion isnt going to die because of how he was depicted and his story isnt over.Â

dumbing down

I think this is why your jimmies are so out of place. You assume the show is dumbing down everything. It really hasnt dumbed down too much and i think this is more your opinion speaking. I do not see why you are lashing out atÂ us since we are being civil with you, mate.

^ Exactly the point I'm trying to make.
1860	clawson24	2014-06-09	I know Jon said it, but why are we supposed to think Castle Black will fall?
Main threat was the attack by the back door with elite warriors and its over. All done in Mances side was a Joke. Their arrows just dont reach the wall, if they send a mamouth you set him on fire, and if they send you a giant youll stop him with six men. The door was not even broked, just lifted. And the climbing guys had 0 chanes of reaching the top.


Â 
Because Mance and the Wildlings can continue doing that for weeks and months if they need to. The NW lost half it's men in just this episode. If even a few more were to die in each subsequent Wildling attack, the NW would be wiped out within a few weeks.
1861	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-09	Â 
Why not? Â If you have read the books you should know what the events at the wall are ultimately more important than whoever's ass is on the iron throne.


Â 
This is true, but the two battles are depicted differently. Blackwater is basically just a huge single attack. Sure, there's a bit of preparation earlier, but most of the action takes place in one day/night and then is done. That's why dedicating an entire episode to it worked so good.
Â 
But the battle of the Wall is the Battle of Castle Black first and then a siege that lasts several days. That's why I think it could have been better to spend several episodes in this battle rather than blowing their wad in one go
Â 
Plus, Blackwater features several main characters, while this one not so much
1862	LordBloodraven	2014-06-09	Stannis is not saving the wall. either jon will singlehandedly kill every wildling or Dany dispatched a covert force of unsullied to break the wildling army. Instead of STANNIS STANNIS STANNIS we will get KHALEESI KHALEESI KHALEESI.Â 
Â 
Fuck this showÂ 


Â 
Â 


Not really the build is for Stannis to arrive and lead to the victory. But no Stannis can't have his triumphant moment. D&D your hatred is all too obvious now.


Â 
Even in the books, Stannis didn't come when the battle was raging on the Wall. He came when all looked hopeless and that's probably the case next week. Chill up guys.
Â 
Besides, I think they made the Night's Watchmen look kind of incompetent, mostly at the start. The guys have no trebuchets, no catapults. They let Mag the Mighty open the gates without scorpioning his ass.
I'm really sad for Pyp and Grenn. Grenn should have survived, man.
Alliser was particularly funny. "I said fucking notch! Not draw you cunts!", "What you're waiting? Loose!!!". Great episode

1864	sj4iy	2014-06-09	They're not being criticized for "sticking to the books".Â  They're being criticized for how they structured the episode (and, by implication, the preceding episodes of this storyline).No, they're being criticized because a character they wanted to see didn't show up and save the day. I read through this forum all week long and it was crazy just how many people said "I can't wait to see Stannis!" in an episode very clearly focusing on the Night's Watch and Jon Snow. Now, despite the fact that the episode works better without Stannis, they are upset because they think that Stannis will get 'overlooked' next week by other story lines, even though they clearly were doing the same with the Night's Watch storyline themselves.
1865	clawson24	2014-06-09	Thought that scene was especially cheesy. I'm just not big on seeing the same thing twice if it didn't work great OR worked just well enough the first time, which it did...back in Season 1. Here it just sort of added to the overall laughable tone of the episode where there shouldn't have been one. Like seriously, give Grenn any other badass speech like the one that Ser Alliser gave. Making me care for Ser Alliser was an impressive feat; I was more worried for his safety in the Tormund fight than I was for Grenn's even though it was extremely obvious Grenn was doomed. Â I cared more about Ser Alliser surviving than I did Grenn.Â 
Â 
Aside from the technical aspects (brief Ghost-cam, brilliant aerial shots, scenes on top of the wall), Ser Alliser's talk with Jon on top of the Wall was the best moment of the episode for me. I thought Grenn's speech only rivaled Ygritte's death and the Sam-Gilly stuff in cheesiness tonight.


Â 
In what possible way, shape, or form was the NW holding the gate against an incredibly awesome, bad-ass looking giant "laughable"? I couldn't have possibly had a more different reaction than yours I don't think.
1866	Emperoreddy	2014-06-09	Â 
It does make it less though. If the last shot of this episode was triumphant music playing while Stannis proudly charges through his line of knights having just saved the Wall, it'd be stuck in viewers minds all week and would be a massive talking point and memorable moment. Now, it will more than likely be lost in the fray of one of the most noteworthy-moment packed episodes in TV history. Having it next week doesn't make the actual action of Stannis arriving there less cool, it will just affect the way it sticks in viewers' consciousness.


Â 
But it leaves viewers on a cliffhanger after a bittersweet ending and legit left wondering what Jon's fate will be. Everyone's focus will be on the epicness of the battle, on Sam, and Ygritte's death, and on what will happen to Jon next week.Â 
Â 
Maybe that upsets Stannis fans with the fact his hero moment will be in a packed episode, and maybe they have a right to be. That still doesn't mean this was bad TV. This was very good TV.
Â 
I think some people are to hung up with their "sullied" expectations and forget that the show is paced and written for the "unsullied".
1867	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-06-09	I'm not a Stanstan but I think it was stupid not to include Stannis. Â It would have been the perfect ending and it would have allowed us to focus on the other stories. Â I honestly feel that was bad storytelling.
Â 
There's so much going on in the season finale that I have no idea how they will fit everything in one episode. Â Oh well.

1868	clawson24	2014-06-09	The moment I loved (for a mix of humor and cringing) was Jon's face getting smashed into an anvil. Shit man! Then he regained...usurped...stole...backhanded his street cred by spitting blood in Styr's face. Though I was a bit perplexed as to how he didn't have two split lips and a tooth or two skittering off Styr's rock-hard facial scarring.Â 
Â 
If the dragon preteens are chained up next season, can they please splurge on direwolf SFX? Ghost running into the fray was awesome but I wanted MOAR carnage. Give me something like the Princess Mononoke scene with the wolves tearing stuff up.Â 


Â 
Hoping for some notable Summer action when (and if) Bran and co. get ambushed by wights in the finale.
1869	KarlVyt	2014-06-09	I don't understand why the fuck didn't they just have the whole wall story line conclude this episode. I mean they had an ENTIRE EPISODE TO DO THIS.
BUT NO WE HAVE TO GET FUCKING SAM AND GILLY AND MORE WASTED TIME.
WTF?
You could of had stannis save the day at the end and have a nice conclusion to the wall arc and finish it for the entire seasons and leave the other story lines for episode 10 cause some major shit is going to happenÂ 
Now we have to have everything cramped into one episode which surely means david and dan will fuck up something as always.
Jesus D&D must have developed a brain tumor when they wrote this and thought. Hey fuck george and his writing let's make our own incompetent shit.
1870	robbyhouston	2014-06-09	I'm hoping that Tormund takes over Sigorn's role. I'd love to see him marry a babe, get more lines, and get a Giantsbane (Bearfucker?) sigil. Think it'd be dope.
1871	Enosh	2014-06-09	don't worry guys, Stannis will get his 1 min and half next episode (can't have more because we already have a billion fucking other things in it) having 5 guys charge another 6 guys (in between Grey worm fucking Melisande and Tyrion giving another rousing speech about some dude he used to know) because putting a major battle in the episode that got the most money to show major battles is just to insane, better spend that money on the ever important plot point of Aemon talking about his love life
1872	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-09	don't worry guys, Stannis will get his 1 min and half next episode (can't have more because we already have a billion fucking other things in it) having 5 guys charge another 6 guys (in between Grey worm fucking Melisande and Tyrion giving another rousing speech about some dude he used to know) because putting a major battle in the episode that got the most money to show major battles is just to insane, better spend that money on the ever important plot point of Aemon talking about his love life

:V
1873	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-06-09	I'm honestly shocked there are people defending the showwriters' decision not to include Stannis. Â 
Â 
Movies usually have a happy ending, and a game changer if you want to have a sequel. Â Stannis saving the day is your happy ending that wraps everything up nicely while at the same time it changes everything in Westeros. Â If you're going to devote a whole episode to one storyline and you want to make the episode feel like a movie, you should have done that.

Missandei, my bad, I always forget her name and it's quite close to Melisandre ^^
1876	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	don't worry guys, Stannis will get his 1 min and half next episode (can't have more because we already have a billion fucking other things in it) having 5 guys charge another 6 guys (in between Grey worm fucking Melisande and Tyrion giving another rousing speech about some dude he used to know) because putting a major battle in the episode that got the most money to show major battles is just to insane, better spend that money on the ever important plot point of Aemon talking about his love life


And D&D apologists will definitely will find a way to say how fantastic that was.Â
1877	clawson24	2014-06-09	Â 
Â 
Â 
...meh....
Â 
Okay, that's a little strong- it actually WAS a strong scene, in and of itself.Â 
Â 
At the same time... Its like the 5th time they have used this trope; they hardly ever have a Night-Watch conflict/argument without regurgitating the Oath. Â Its not that the oath has lost meaning, but it seems like its the ONLY way the show knows how to conclude a scene involving the NW. Â ITs as if they have a saying in their writing room- "When in Doubt, quote the oath."
Â 
Had this been the only time they had done it, it would have made a better scene. Â 
Â 


Â 
It's been used a bit much, but it's being used very fittingly, especially here. Being around 10 seconds away from essentially certain death at the hands of a freaking massive, terrifying giant, it'd be emboldening to know that your impending death is actually in service of something great. I'm not sure what else they could have had them do that would've communicated the same idea.
1878	clawson24	2014-06-09	I should rephrase it to anyone skilled. He's essentially demolishing peasants before he fights Styr; the average Wildling is cake-fodder for Jon. As soon as he gets a somewhat skilled opponent (Karl, Styr) he's disarmed with relative ease to build "drama" that we don't really need. I'm not buying that he loses the sword again only so that as soon as he finishes Styr, which still was a decent fight, he can be unarmed when Ygritte has the chance to kill him to again build more "drama". He's laughably bad at fighting in the show compared to how he is in the books and again, that's kind of his only good quality.Â 
Â 
Plus having him mope around to the extreme and then just decide "My woman's dead so fook it, I'm going on a suicide mission" instead of just having a wounded Ser Alliser, or even Slynt, get one minute to order Jon to treat with Mance was just such a stupid plot. Seriously, they're making it very, very convincing that he is exceptionally daft and that easy to write off when the time comes. Show Jon basically deserves it already.



If you think sword fighting is Jon's only good quality, I refuse to believe you've read the books.

Oh,and ignore the possibility that that Stan's arrival may be even more effective in the final episode.
1880	LaughingTreeMaiden	2014-06-09	I totally cried when Ygritte diedÂ  Â 
Â 
Thumbs up to the person who predicted a Tormund vs Thorne fightÂ 
Â 
As for Stan the Man being pushed to ep 10, I wouldn't worry too much because the finale is 66 minutes long. Plenty of time for everyone to get their slice of action. (Also I'm a Jon fan and am thrilled he had ep 9 to himself. Sorry about that. Not.)
1881	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-06-09	they killed off Grenn and Pyp? Nooooo I cannot believe it, this really hurts, my faith in humanity has hit a new low, who will be Jon Snow's BFFs now? (apart from Sam) They were the in-betweeners of Westeros

1883	clawson24	2014-06-09	I feel bad for some people on here. Â Just watch the show and enjoy it for what it is. Â I have read the books several times. Â I enjoy every single episode. Â I dont sit there watching episodes with my books on hand as if I have a checklist going over each scene and line to make sure it matches or is included. Â You should let yourself just watch it as a separate entity. Â It is an adaptation. Â We already know there will be changes. Â To say this isnt one of the better shows or even in the top 5 is scary. Â So many of my friends never read the books and whenever we discuss the show their eyes light up and say how amazing it was. Â Thats because theyre not watching saying wait hey hey that guy was supposed to be standing to Jon's left not the right!! Why is his hair so nicely done that doesnt make sense for a battle!! God I hate this theyre ruining it! Â Anybody not enjoying this show I wish could forget they ever read the books and just watch it unsullied. Â Maybe you guys wouldnt be so stuck up about it and could just be entertained. Â This has been the highest rated HBO show of all time. Â The only real show ahead of it including network shows would be The Walking Dead and some others. Â Averaged 18+ million/episode, Â sounds like its a pretty good show to me. Â Rotten Tomatoes has like a minimum 95 percent approval rating every time. Â Relax and enjoy the ride despite the changes and differences please. Â Sorry for no punctuation/grammatical errors this is on my phone.

Well its not as if its not a major plot point in the entire series which also sets-up most of the key interactions from AFFC, if they have truly thrown that out of the window it is worrying franklyÂ
1887	redriver	2014-06-09	Ahaha. There comes the D&D cult members shite train.


No it doesn't.I like Stannis,especially from ADWD on.Stan will have his time.I just think it's important that Jon and Mance have their dialogue first.
1888	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-09	Really, though... How touching was it when Gregor showed up on the scene in the tunnel, in an uncharacteristic blink of tardiness, just to realize that the Giant had killed Grenn and his nameless fodder brothers. Realizing he had only been a ginger-minge's hair late, you could see the blood red tears of a warrior welling in his hazel eyes. That moment was so silent it was deafening. The existential anguish captured in Gregor's eyes as he realized, "Fuck, I want a Taco", was captivating. Seeing the seething rage manifest within, as he focused back on Grenn's twisted, de-animated corpse! We all knew what to expect. When Gregor assumed that battojutsu stance, I could hardly stay in my seat. FWOOMP! Down goes the giant, before he even has the opportunity to feel the fear. Gotta love it, how Gregor staged the scene post-kill, and methodically retraced his steps to make it appear as though Grenn & Friends did an admirable job. Gregor, the unsung hero of compassion and comradery.
Â 
Next, on Gregor of Thrones: Gregor fixes Pia's teeth.
1889	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	Stannis' arrival in the next episode will be as effective as having Mountain vs Viper in the same episode as LS Reveal or having Jaime's Bath scene in the same episode as Red wedding. Stannis' arrival will totally lose importance. No one can beat LS reveal not even Tyrion's crossbow massacre.
Next episode will also have more memorable moments. (In terms of importance rating)
Â 
1) LS Reveal.
2) Tyrion's crossbow massacre.Â 
3) Dany's chaining.Â 
4) Stannis' arrival.Â 
In this episode it would have been far more effective.Â 
Â 
Â 


No it doesn't.I like Stannis,especially from ADWD on.Stan will have his time.I just think it's important that Jon and Mance have their dialogue first.


Look above for why i think this was stupid and a shite move from D&D. It completely removes the effect of his most glorious moment upto date.

1890	TheReal_Rebel	2014-06-09	The CGI was impressive, but if you are not emotionally invested in the characters it felt flat and wooden.  Was more upset over Pyp & Grenn then Ygritte.  Jon, eh. Felt no jeopardy for Gilli, Babe & Sam.  So it was visually interesting, sometimes, but emotionally flat.
Master Aemon seemed wasted and not really pertinent but could have given more info.
Liked Alister or Alliser's speech & Ed.
The dialogue between Pyp & Sam insipid filler The pacing was strange. Also no climax.
The book wins on emotional involvement, the Show on visuals.

1891	Valonqar_	2014-06-09	Damm it D&D I trusted you not to turn this show into aDwD. (By which I mean, a lot of great moments huge buildup and the climaxgets delayed until next book/episode) sigh. If it was not possible to have everything this episode I would have at least liked to have the battle at Cb before (maybe instead of the Yara scene?)Â 
Â 
Â 
As sad as I am for losing Pyp, at least that means he will not replace Marsh. (That had been a theory) How dare those filthy men onf the NW slay a giant as brave and heroic as Mag? (excep fo Grenn, I wish he hadn't been a dead man from the moment the trailers aired) I must also say I Owen Teale was an awesome Thorne and I will regret it when/if he dies. Â It is still one of the best episodes of the season (after 2 and 8, that is)
1892	SkaggCannibal	2014-06-09	Well, at least Jon got his head smashed into an anvil .
Â 
So this episode... talk about a Sam-overdose. Replacing Stannis scenes with Sam&Gilly scenes, ugh. I hate Sam and I want him to die.
Â 
I did like Allister, Ygritte and Tormund. The mammoths and giants were awesome, the actions scenes were great, the conversations were crap. I was not as invested in it as I thought I would be. Allong the way II thought the ending would make up for it and it didn't, it was disappointed. It's great when people argue it's just delay for the big Stannis moment, but do you actually believe that? Crammed between a Dany and Tyrion scene, it will not be Stannis's big moment. Don't kid yourself.
Â 
Â 
EDIT: emotionally flat, yes that's how I would describe the episode. I just didn't care about the characters.

1893	clawson24	2014-06-09	Â 
But it leaves viewers on a cliffhanger after a bittersweet ending and legit left wondering what Jon's fate will be. Everyone's focus will be on the epicness of the battle, on Sam, and Ygritte's death, and on what will happen to Jon next week.Â 
Â 
Maybe that upsets Stannis fans with the fact his hero moment will be in a packed episode, and maybe they have a right to be. That still doesn't mean this was bad TV. This was very good TV.
Â 
I think some people are to hung up with their "sullied" expectations and forget that the show is paced and written for the "unsullied".


Â 
I agree that it was very good TV. I don't think the episode was completely ruined because Stannis didn't appear -- in fact, I loved the episode as a whole. But I completely understand people's frustrations in having Stannis's big arrival not being allowed to stand alone as an epic episode closer and instead will likely be just one cool scene amongst many next week.
1894	redriver	2014-06-09	explain why and how please


Like in the books Stannis didn't arrive until several days into the "assault" on the Wall.After the "cannibal savages" Wildling portrayal of this season,we need time to see that this is not by any means entirely the case.I hope to see Mance saying "my people have bled enough" before Stannis attacks.This would add nuance more in keeping with the books whilst giving Stanfans their cheer moment.
Â 
And in case anyone thinks I favour Mance over Stannis,I think they are actually working in concert in the latter half of ADWD whether knowingly or not.But the show needs to start redacting this all Wildlings are evil stuff otherwise Jon's ongoing role will be impossible.
1895	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-09	I wish Stannis had arrived this episode but next week is good enough. 
Christ the whinging in here is pathetic.
1896	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-06-09	Ive just watched the episode and slightly underwhelmed, it looks like they are going to sandwich in Stannis's moment of glory in with Tyrion's escape etc next episode, they could easily have done it all in this episode though I think, Blackwater was a lot better imo. I personally think they have botched the entire story-line at castle black this season, Craster's keep diversion which took up a few episodes looks more and more pointless, its saving grace was Burn GormanÂ
1897	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	Â It's great when people argue it's just delay for the big Stannis moment, but do you actually believe that? Crammed between a Dany and Tyrion scene, it will not be Stannis's big moment. Don't kid yourself.


There are fair few amount of people who believe that. Read: Anti-Stannis people.
The whining from apologists will continue.Â 
You forget that this episode will feature LS reveal. I am sorry but nothing beat LS reveal. It is also the reason why GRRM kept it in the epilogue.Â

1898	Jinjonator	2014-06-09	So I was definitely confused and a bit disappointed at first over Stannis not arriving, but... the more I think on it, the less I'm bothered. There wasn't any chance of Jon meeting up with Mance happening this episode unless they cut the battle disappointingly short, and with it happening in the next episode, that just means more time for it (both the Mance scene and Stannis's arrival). Everyone saying how it's ruined and how they don't even care anymore are still going to watch the finale and they're still going to be excited and glad when Stannis gets his moment in the sun.
1899	robbyhouston	2014-06-09	So the main complaint is that StanFans don't think their favorite character can keep up?Â 
Â 
I wanted him too, but putting him in the next episode doesn't hurt it to me. Stannis is cool and will get the respect he deserves.Â

Â 


Â 
That is like saying you have won a 100m dash against a quadruplegic without a wheelchair, considering the books don't even have any visuals. They are, you know, books.
Â 
So disappointed with this episode.

1902	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-06-09	I think the delay is probably because of the shooting schedule. This episode probably was already the one with the longest shooting schedule and to fit the Stannis part in would have kept Neil on set for too long.
A lot of times when viewers like us complain we have no idea about the behind the scene logistical nightmares that the changes we'd like to make would have caused.

1903	Brienne the Wench	2014-06-09	So, I totally thought that Stannis' arrival was gonna close out the episode! Â I was almost sure of it. Â But I can't say that I'm TOO disappointed that it didn't - Jon Snow is by far my favorite character (Jaime coming in second) and I loved him having this whole episode! Â I do think it was kinda weird to have him decide to go confront Mance himself - because he didn't seem to keen on the idea in the book! Â But I don't hate it, it's just... different. Â I still feel like Stannis will definitely get his moment! Â I have high hopes that it won't just be a bleh moment, it'll be all it's supposed to be.
Â 
Pyp AND Grenn?! Â Come on, RIP Grenn Â :-(
Â 
I don't think Jon is daft at all! Â In both the books and the show, I think he makes (mostly) the best decisions he can - and I happen to think he's a clever guy, with awesome swordfighting skills to boot! Â I think he's a super conflicted character - caught between two worlds - but that he tries to always do what he thinks is right. Â Sure he makes mistakes, but who doesn't?! Â I don't think those mistakes make him stupid. Â With the books, we are focused so much more on him that we get to know his character on a more personal level, so of course we know his depth even more in print. Â But show Jon is still kick-ass.
Â 
I totally liked this episode - and it breezed by! Â It was over before I was ready for it to be over, I didn't even realize it had reached the end! Â I have never not liked an episode of the show (just maybe little moments here and there where things were really CHANGED) and I'm not gonna start now!
1904	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	If it's handled well on screen it will be glorious.


Do you really think D&D can handle any Stannis moment gloriously? Don't kid yourself.Â
1905	Rodrik Stone	2014-06-09	I officially have no clue how they're going to fit the rest of ASOS into Episode 10. They need to do:
Â 
STANNIS STANNIS STANNIS (or equivalent)
Yes, I killed your vile son.
You are no son of mine.
Arya going to Braavos? Otherwise it'd be odd that we'd keep seeing it in the titles after Stannis goes to the IB.
Something with Bran- the Heart Tree was foreshadowed way too hard earlier in the season to not include it, plus the episode is called The Children.
Hazzea flambA©?
Lady Stoneheart, maybe- but honestly I'd rather S05E01 open with her at this point.
That's pretty much all high-impact stuff with no space for filler scenes + mandatory T&A.
1906	redriver	2014-06-09	Do you really think D&D can handle any Stannis moment gloriously? Don't kid yourself.Â 


I think as a Mance fan I might have more reason to complain!!
1907	Lord Voldemort	2014-06-09	Do you really think D&D can handle any Stannis moment gloriously? Don't kid yourself.Â 


Â 
They did Blackwater very good from little to no source material.
1908	Alboin	2014-06-09	Is Stannis being moved to e10 officially means no Lady Stoneheart?Â
1909	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	Â 
They did Blackwater very good from little to no source material.


Blackwater was written by GRRM and directed by Neil Marshall. D&D had no or little control on that one, which is why it was epic.
Stan's epic charge was either written by GRRM or a change by Neil Marshall. Had it been D&D he would have been back at Dragonstone burning some infidels.Â Â 
Â 


I think as a Mance fan I might have more reason to complain!!


Ouch. Yeah i agree that you will have loads to complain.

1910	Jinjonator	2014-06-09	Also: I don't find the argument of Stannis's moment being buried terribly persuasive, especially since you could apply that argument to literally any scene. "Arya leaving the Hound won't be as effective because there's so many epic scenes", "Dany chaining her dragons won't be as effective because there's so many epic scenes", etc etc etc. Yes, it's true that Stannis arriving will end up being one epic scene out of many; this description also applies to every other epic scene in the finale. And obviously you can't give each epic scene its own episode. The way I look at it is this: it means the finale will be that much better, because it's one more great scene added to the list of great scenes. Not sure if that kind of optimism is legal here, but that's my 2 cents.

Yeah LS reveal, almost forgot about that. I don't get why they would pack three awesome things (Stannis arrival, Tyrion-Tywin and LS) in one episode. We also get Bran, Arya+theHound goodbey, Dany and her dragons, the preview gives more Cersei+Jaime... That episode is already way too packed, it always is. Now here they had an extra 10minutes to show something, but no, we gonna spare it for the last episode, make it even longer and more packed. And lets fill this too-short episode with Sam scenes.... Ugh they could've scrapped so much Sam here, would've given them all the time in the world.

Arya going to Braavos? Otherwise it'd be odd that we'd keep seeing it in the titles after Stannis goes to the IB.
Something with Bran- the Heart Tree was foreshadowed way too hard earlier in the season to not include it, plus the episode is called The Children.
Hazzea flambA©?
Lady Stoneheart, maybe- but honestly I'd rather S05E01 open with her at this point.
That's pretty much all high-impact stuff with no space for filler scenes + mandatory T&A.


Right! Â I REALLY hope they don't skimp on Jaime & Tyrion's scene - I want to see it in all of its debilitating glory. Â Hazzea flambe? Â LoL! Â That's terrible.
And Lady Stoneheart, I feel like she could be the very last scene! Â I mean, it's not a terribly long scene. as I recall... is it? Â But definitely no space for fillers! Â Every second has to count.
Â 
On another note, Jon becoming Lord Commander, I'm definitely thinking that's not happening until next season! Â I think his arc will end with Stannis' (hopefully) epic arrival and subsequent kicking of some Wildling ass.
1915	SkaggCannibal	2014-06-09	Also: I don't find the argument of Stannis's moment being buried terribly persuasive, especially since you could apply that argument to literally any scene. "Arya leaving the Hound won't be as effective because there's so many epic scenes", "Dany chaining her dragons won't be as effective because there's so many epic scenes", etc etc etc. Yes, it's true that Stannis arriving will end up being one epic scene out of many; this description also applies to every other epic scene in the finale. And obviously you can't give each epic scene its own episode. The way I look at it is this: it means the finale will be that much better, because it's one more great scene added to the list of great scenes. Not sure if that kind of optimism is legal here, but that's my 2 cents.


It's that this episode they had the time to make it work and they choose not to. They had an extra 10 minutes left and they moved it to the last episode. And they had too much Sam-time, Stannis could've fitted in perfectly this episode.
1916	Rhaquentis	2014-06-09	Relax guys, we don't have to separate ourselves into Stannis vs AntiStannis. Â I too wanted him to be in the ending, and I agree that it would make him more likeable and heroic, but it would take from the NW. I can still admire him in the next episode, along with all the rest of the amazing scenes there.
1917	Gertrude	2014-06-09	Yes, it's true that Stannis arriving will end up being one epic scene out of many; this description also applies to every other epic scene in the finale. And obviously you can't give each epic scene its own episode.Â 


Â 
No, of course not, but I think that each epic scene needs a little breathing room. I am concerned that there is too much to fit into the finale and not be just overloaded. We shall see, I guess, but I would have preferred seeing them spread out a little.
1918	slon	2014-06-09	And they had too much Sam-time


this. i couldnt believe the waste of time.
1919	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-09	OK, I didn't hate it - solely based on the power of my love for Jon Snow and the NW as a bookreader - but it certainly was nowhere near as good (actually fantastic) as "Blackwater."
Imo they made four huge mistakes wrt this episode.
MISTAKE #1: Pushing the raid from the south to the end of the season. It made no sense, lead to pointless filler throughout the season, and undercut the emotional power of Ygritte's death scene.
MISTAKE #2: Not using the rest of the season to develop the characters at the Wall. The only characters we really know are Jon, Sam & Alliser (and one of them is an asshole). It's kind of hard to care about a bunch of nameless/soulless extras & vaguely-drawn bit players.
MISTAKE #3: Too much wall-to-wall action without a respite. Without anything else to cut to, the action gets repetitive, and it's hard to keep the momentum going. "Blackwater" had Maegor's Holdfast; this had nothing.
MISTAKE #4: Structuring the episode without a resolution. Not for Stannis's sake but for the sake of having a complete narrative, Jon going to treat with Mance should have been about the 4/5 mark, concluding with about 2 minutes of Stannis's army kicking ass. (And mirroring "Blackwater" is kind of the point.)
1920	Rhoynar	2014-06-09	Ok, so we know for sure the following plotlines will be in next episode:
Â 
1. Jon meets Mance.
2. Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!
3. The Mountain's agony and Qyburn's messing about (the actor playing Qyburn said he was appearing in the last episode with Bjornsson)
4. The Hound fights Brienne (WTF?)
5. Twincest
6. Bran meets the Children
7. "Khaleesi" locks the dragons up
8. Cersei speaks with Tywin
9. Tyrion and Jaime
10.Tyrion, Shae and Tywin
Â 
Maybe:
Â 
1. Stannis offers Winterfell to Jon
2. Lady Stoneheart
Â 
So, now, how the f* will they have time to make the battle of the Wall seem lost before Stannis arrives?? And how will they have enough time to give the man his due glory? Will they show us the crushing of the wildlings? How much do D&D hate Stannis?
1921	The Taxman	2014-06-09	They had an extra 7 minutes to add in Stannis this episode... fuckkkkkk
1922	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	^^ Yeah i am fairly disappoined with their decision to make Brienne fight Sandor while Arya is watching. Makes LS reveal, tad unlikely.

So basically: It's just going to be too epic of an episode. Mind blown.
1924	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-09	Ok, so we know for sure the following plotlines will be in next episode:

TBH things are still pretty dire at the wall. with them being big time outnumbered and all. So not really sure how much it'lltake to make things seem hopeless.
1925	MoIaF	2014-06-09	I don't agree. Compare to Emilia's pathetic, underwhelming reaction to Ser Jonah's betrayal last week---Kit's performance was magnificent in comparison.


Â 
Magnificent, really?Â 
Â 
There is no need to compare these two, however, comparing someone banishing their adviser/friend after a betrayal (which I though was a solid piece of acting) and having the only woman you ever loved die in your arms is the wrong comparison.Â 
Â 
If you want to do an apples to apples comparison you have to compare it to Dany smothering Drogo at the end of Season 1Â http://youtu.be/4zAFHETSTJo Now, that was emotional.Â
1926	The Red Melli	2014-06-09	No emotion during Ygritte's death.
Kit just stood there and did nothing other than "welp shit happens I guess!.
Â 
I felt the same way with Lena during Joffrey's death, it was just so bad as if Cersei didn't care. Â ... "I have still 2 children left! It's not a big deal."
1927	Mel_Rose	2014-06-09	So I was definitely confused and a bit disappointed at first over Stannis not arriving, but... the more I think on it, the less I'm bothered. There wasn't any chance of Jon meeting up with Mance happening this episode unless they cut the battle disappointingly short, and with it happening in the next episode, that just means more time for it (both the Mance scene and Stannis's arrival). Everyone saying how it's ruined and how they don't even care anymore are still going to watch the finale and they're still going to be excited and glad when Stannis gets his moment in the sun.


Â 
I totally agree with you. Actually I realized that the only reason I was confused about no-Stannis was because I expected Stannis due to reading this forum and people being sure that Stannis will appear. The battle is not over, the synopsis is clear about Stannis appearing in ep.10 but I guess nobody focused on that. If I had no expectations, then I'd have no problem with the ending. It was underwhelming but clearly a "To Be Continued" ending.
Â 
It was a great episode, I teared up with Grenn and the others reciting the vow and drawing swords; that tracking shot was awesome; overall I loved it and I'm not a fan of battles and fighting.

I was 100% sure Stannis would show up because Neil said that there were going to be 3 battles this episode.
Well imagine my face when the credits began to roll..
1929	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-09	I geuss Stannis' arrival is going to the fight scene that was really complicated to shoot.Â
1930	Shpati	2014-06-09	I didn't like Ygritte's death. It should take more than one arrow from a little boy to take her down for good. I thought it would've been better for Jon to find her dead after that battle was over.
Maybe we could have seen characters like Noye if they didn't waste time with things like the Grey Worm love story.
The Grenn and Pyp death got to me. Even though it didn't happen in the books. I hope this doesn't mean they will die in tWoW.
And I wish we got to see Jon commanding and leading more to show why he is LC material in the upcoming election.
I got a feeling that Alister will turn out to be honorable when Sam and Gilly reveal Janos hiding during battle, and that's how Snow becomes LC unanimously. So that may be a quick scene in E10 if they do it that way.
The Aemon and Sam scene sucked imo.
No "Stannis, Stannis!". If we don't see this next episode, I'm going to be sad.
1931	-Ghost-	2014-06-09	Im sad we got no Stannis, especially with it only being like 50 min. It was a great episode though. They have a lot to fit into next episode, the preview looked packed. Plus, theres still the Brianne biting scene.
1932	Druze	2014-06-09	What's up with Jon being the guy to initate the dishonorable parlay and attempt to kill Mance?  
Jon has Stark blood  and him coming up with that scheme is so out of character!

Â 
He showed more emotion in that 1 scene than he did for the entire duration of the books. Jon Snow in the books really didn't give a fuck about Ygirtte's death. He wasn't even sure if it was him or somebody else that shot her down. He was too enthralled into the battle itself.Â 
Â 
When he saw Ygritte's dead body, he was just "welp, there goes another dead wilding".
Â 
Here's a good illustration of her death in the books imo:

That is a more accurate representation of what went down.

Maybe Jon will do something more honorable and challenge him to single combat to settle it or something.

I predicted this would happen.  That they will have Jon volunteer for the suicide mission. It gives him agency, and makes it more heroic for him to basically give his life to save Sam and the rest of the Watch.

Yea it was a good talk. But I couldn't really sit still and listen b/c I was so anxious to see the battle.
I can't wait for the chant next episode. Lot of people, including me, are upset we didn't see it this episode (I thought they were going to finish all the battles in this episode tbh). But where this episode left off, it makes more sense to put the chant in E10 of course. Patience Stannis fans.

Yeh i was fully expecting to see the battle done this episode, but i guess what made it better for me is that i came on here and already saw that he didn't arrive this episode. So it kind've diffused the tension a bit and i could just sit back and enjoy it.Â 
If they muck it up next episode THEN ill be mad. But for now i think they left it at a logical place. The battle on the wall went for days in the books anyway.

I'm not even anti-Stannis XD  I just think that the episode worked better without him, and focused more on the story it was trying to tell rather than cram in something from the books that it wasn't.  I can't wait to see Stannis' glorious entrance, but the Night's Watch deserved to have this episode all alone.

That's probably why I was disappointed. I kept looking at the time wondering if they are going to get the Stannis scene right.
I think Stannis fans like my self will give it a higher rating when we revisit it.
1950	johndance	2014-06-09	Loved it. Glad they are being faithful to the books more or less and didnt have Stannis show up early. I hope they dont play him up to much next week. WTF is it with people being pissed he didnt show up in this episode. Did of you actually read the books? I assume its mostly the people with a man crush on Stannis that are willing to comprimise the integrity of the events just so he gets a bigger spot light then he actually deserves . I would think most book readers would be happy that its being portrayed correctly. Great job D&D sticking to the way it actually did go down. We'll see Stannis next week and it seems like it will properly be done.
1951	Shpati	2014-06-09	Having Stannis in next episode will make much more sense.
I can't wait for the non-readers to see what a hero Stannis is.
1952	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I predicted this would happen.  That they will have Jon volunteer for the suicide mission. It gives him agency, and makes it more heroic for him to basically give his life to save Sam and the rest of the Watch.

I think he's also utterly devastated emotionally by what happened to Ygritte that he is pretty dead inside already, so why not try to save people's lives by giving his own?
1953	Gronzag	2014-06-09	Jon is, along with Arya, my favorite character in the books but in the show he really annoys the hell out of me. Sam is also painful to watch. One of the worst episodes in the series ever.

LOL please no one forced D&D to stretch out the battle at night over the whole episode. if you don't see the many unnecesary, boring scenes that could've easily been scrapped, you still have to admit there were 10 minutes left which could've been used for the morning after and the Stannis arrival. That's extra clear when we know the last episode will be 66 minutes, an unnecesary packing of everything that still needs to happen, while having lots of extra time in the previous episode.
1955	SerZygote	2014-06-09	Wait for it.

1956	Tori Targaryen	2014-06-09	Really enjoyed the episode. Glad they didn't go with the predictable 'Stannis' ending. I really thought they would have, was pleasantly surprised. They're setting up for a big finale.
Â 
I didn't expect to like this episode more than Blackwater.... I didn't, but in saying that, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I wasn't very keen on the wall-to-wall action they've been promising for ages. I liked the quieter moments of Blackwater mixed with the action, but this had it's quiet moments too. Naturally the Jon/Ygritte scene was brilliantly done. I was worried it would be overdone, it wasn't, and not rushed either.

Â 
He had no emotions in the book in regards to Ygritte's death.


Â 
It was actually a very emotional scene in the books:
Â 
"He found Ygritte sprawled across a patch of old snow beneath the Lord Commanderâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Tower, with an arrow between her breasts. The ice crystals had settled over her face, and in the moonlight it looked as though she wore a glittering silver mask. 
Â 
The arrow was black, Jon saw, but it was fletched with white duck feathers . Not mine, he told himself, not one of mine. But he felt as if it were. When he knelt in the snow beside her, her eyes opened. â<U+0080><U+009C>Jon Snow,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said, very softly . It sounded as though the arrow had found a lung. â<U+0080><U+009C>Is this a proper castle now? Not just a tower?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>It is.â<U+0080><U+009D> Jon took her hand. â<U+0080><U+009C>Good,â<U+0080><U+009D> she whispered. â<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted tâ<U+0080><U+0099> see one proper castle, before â<U+0080>¦ before I â<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see a hundred castles,â<U+0080><U+009D> he promised her. â<U+0080><U+009C>The battleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s done . Maester Aemon will see to you.â<U+0080><U+009D> He touched her hair. â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re kissed by fire, remember? Lucky. It will take more than an arrow to kill you. Aemon will draw it out and patch you up, and weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get you some milk of the poppy for the pain.â<U+0080><U+009D> 
Â 
She just smiled at that. â<U+0080><U+009C>Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>you remember that cave? We should have stayed in that cave. I told you so.â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll go back to the cave,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said. â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not going to die, Ygritte. Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not.â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Oh.â<U+0080><U+009D> Ygritte cupped his cheek with her hand. â<U+0080><U+009C>You know nothing, Jon Snow,â<U+0080><U+009D> she sighed, dying."
1958	MoIaF	2014-06-09	OK, I didn't hate it - solely based on the power of my love for Jon Snow and the NW as a bookreader - but it certainly was nowhere near as good (actually fantastic) as "Blackwater."

MISTAKE #1: Pushing the raid from the south to the end of the season. It made no sense, lead to pointless filler throughout the season, and undercut the emotional power of Ygritte's death scene.
MISTAKE #2: Not using the rest of the season to develop the characters at the Wall. The only characters we really know are Jon, Sam & Alliser (and one of them is an asshole). It's kind of hard to care about a bunch of nameless/soulless extras & vaguely-drawn bit players.
MISTAKE #3: Too much wall-to-wall action without a respite. Without anything else to cut to, the action gets repetitive, and it's hard to keep the momentum going. "Blackwater" had Maegor's Holdfast; this had nothing.
MISTAKE #4: Structuring the episode without a resolution. Not for Stannis's sake but for the sake of having a complete narrative, Jon going to treat with Mance should have been about the 4/5 mark, concluding with about 2 minutes of Stannis's army kicking ass. (And mirroring "Blackwater" is kind of the point.)

Agree with each and everyone of these. Especially the first one and the fourth one.

It was actually a very emotional scene in the books:
Â 
"He found Ygritte sprawled across a patch of old snow beneath the Lord Commanderâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Tower, with an arrow between her breasts. The ice crystals had settled over her face, and in the moonlight it looked as though she wore a glittering silver mask. 
Â 
The arrow was black, Jon saw, but it was fletched with white duck feathers . Not mine, he told himself, not one of mine. But he felt as if it were. When he knelt in the snow beside her, her eyes opened. â<U+0080><U+009C>Jon Snow,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said, very softly . It sounded as though the arrow had found a lung. â<U+0080><U+009C>Is this a proper castle now? Not just a tower?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>It is.â<U+0080><U+009D> Jon took her hand. â<U+0080><U+009C>Good,â<U+0080><U+009D> she whispered. â<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted tâ<U+0080><U+0099> see one proper castle, before â<U+0080>¦ before I â<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see a hundred castles,â<U+0080><U+009D> he promised her. â<U+0080><U+009C>The battleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s done . Maester Aemon will see to you.â<U+0080><U+009D> He touched her hair. â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re kissed by fire, remember? Lucky. It will take more than an arrow to kill you. Aemon will draw it out and patch you up, and weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get you some milk of the poppy for the pain.â<U+0080><U+009D> 
Â 
She just smiled at that. â<U+0080><U+009C>Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>you remember that cave? We should have stayed in that cave. I told you so.â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll go back to the cave,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said. â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not going to die, Ygritte. Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not.â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Oh.â<U+0080><U+009D> Ygritte cupped his cheek with her hand. â<U+0080><U+009C>You know nothing, Jon Snow,â<U+0080><U+009D> she sighed, dying."


Seems like the same amount of emotion as they showed in the episode
1960	sj4iy	2014-06-09	Seems like the same amount of emotion as they showed in the episode

Me, too.  They pretty much did it straight from the book (her dying in his arms).
1961	MoIaF	2014-06-09	Seems like the same amount of emotion as they showed in the episode


Â 
I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree. IMO Kit's acting was off, standing there gawking (with no emotional facial expressions) while she's been pierced by an arrow is not emotional to me. But to each it's own.

He doesn't arrive at the first night in the books either. Did you throw hissy fits then??

His arrival has been in the descriptions for episode 10 for weeks. Learn to friggin read, guys!!

He showed happiness when he saw her, he was smiling. I agree that that part was a bit off, but when Ygritte was dying i thought it was perfect
1965	Enosh	2014-06-09	Loved it. Glad they are being faithful to the books more or less and didnt have Stannis show up early. I hope they dont play him up to much next week. WTF is it with people being pissed he didnt show up in this episode. Did of you actually read the books? I assume its mostly the people with a man crush on Stannis that are willing to comprimise the integrity of the events just so he gets a bigger spot light then he actually deserves . I would think most book readers would be happy that its being portrayed correctly. Great job D&D sticking to the way it actually did go down. We'll see Stannis next week and it seems like it will properly be done.


just fyi you might want to actually read some comments before making that straw man
people are fine with him showing up as he did in the books, when jon is with mance, what they want is for the useless 20 min pre battle filler to have been cut so the discussions and Stannis could fit into this episode

1970	E-Ro	2014-06-09	I wonder how many women and children are going to get butchered in the 30 second attack on the wildling army. We already know stannis will personally be killing numerous pregnant women as they beg for mercy, but how many people 12 and under will get killed? 
That's probably why they left it out if this episode, they wanted the wildlings to be as unsympathetic as possible for this. So Jon looks good. But next week they can make the wildlings look as helpless and easy to sympathize with as possible without harming Jon's reputation.
1971	-Ghost-	2014-06-09	I loved when Jon was like "I need him more than I need you" and sent Sam to let Ghost out.

the special effects are probably for something dragon related

I read it more as resignation to the fact that she would kill him, and he was fine with that.  Didn't seem off to me.
1975	johndance	2014-06-09	LOL please no one forced D&D to stretch out the battle at night over the whole episode. if you don't see the many unnecesary, boring scenes that could've easily been scrapped, you still have to admit there were 10 minutes left which could've been used for the morning after and the Stannis arrival. That's extra clear when we know the last episode will be 66 minutes, an unnecesary packing of everything that still needs to happen, while having lots of extra time in the previous episode.

Another Stannis man crush that blinds people to everything.  I swear the Stannis heads would be ok with it if the comet crashed into westeros and wiped half it off the map if it benefited Stannis in some way. So you'd rather change the events of the book COMPLETELY just so Stannis would appear at the end of this episode?  So silly. He's obviously going to show up next week, as he is supposed to and he'll have his 'big' moment.  D&D are remaining faithful to the book. Usually they are praised for this. I don't get it.

Yes because they obvious will blow their wad by showing the most expensive shot on the previews.
BTW, I don't think we're going to the the chaining of the dragons next week. People who think so a setting  themselves up for a disappointment. This is just like last year, when because of the episode name was "Mhysa" people went all "it also means mother, and Cat is a mother so omg well get the double meaning and that means Un-Cat!" They're doing it again this year with "The Children" and Dany's dragons are her children so omg she's going to chain her dragons!  Nope, the children will refer to Bran's story, and maybe Tywin and his children, but Dany will at best get the child's bones.

The shot is set in a dark place and they are screaming. I would think that this is the chaining scene. Ofcourse they will not show the chains in the promo.
1992	PrinceOfWesteros	2014-06-09	I like the walking dead, but last two seasons just deviated too much from the central plot of the walkers.
I think that nothing that is shown in that serie, even if it's good, can be compared to the epicness of this battle, just meant that.
1993	TheWolvesRemember	2014-06-09	The problem i had with this episode wasn't just the lack of Stannis at the end- it was the fact that the actual episode was only 48 minutes long, and half that time was spent doing setup that should have been done in previous episodes. 
Of course we know that Stannis doesn't show up until the daylight, but the issue is that the show has not paced itself very well this season. Like Martin said, little changes have a ripple effect, and last nights episode was the waves hitting the shore.
They've left themselves a WHOLE lot to do next week. We can only hope that they do each part justice.

Â 
I don't think anyone is really complaining about the battle itself, which was genuinely well done...
Â 
The real problem was that the episode didn't actually do all that much to move the storyline forward, leaves a MASSSSSSIVE amount of things that somehow need to now fit into the finale, and really felt lacking from a "reason to care" in many places.
Â 
What went well:
-Jon gets to assume a higher leadership role, but this is something he's already been doing. The single most interesting dynamic of that for me, was when he comes across his friends in the tunnels by the dead giant, knowing that his orders are the reason his friend was dead. That's something of a big growth/leadership moment for a battlefield commander.
Â 
-Sam gets to man up, but again, something he's already been doing.
Â 
What didn't really go over well:
Â 
-Yggrite's death was very detached, and I'm not talking about the acting, which seems to be the common complaint. John and Ygrrite haven't been together for an entire season, and there's been little reason to see her as a sympathetic character this season. I also didn't like how they depicted the kid killing her... Coulda gone over much better/had more emotional impact if he sees her, recognizes her, and hunts her down as she's hunting John down, maybe even being tearful or angry when he fires at her...There could have been real emotional impact of that kid avenging his family... instead it was just "suprise arrow, lol!" and him doing a "sup bro?" to John...
Â 
-There's no real resolution from the whole thing, on any real level.... The entire episode was just Orson Lannister smashing some beetles.
1997	Chebyshov	2014-06-09	All the people saying this episode is bullshit, you deserve to watch a pathetic money grabber serie like the walking dead. Not even have the intelligence to appreciate hard work that the production have made for this epic battle.


Â 
Epic half-battle. They didn't finish it, did they? There were definitely cool aspects to it, but it was an incomplete story. If they wanted to break it up so that the interpersonal stuff could shine through, then they shouldn't have lumped the attacks together in the first place. They wanted an extravaganza for Episode 9, but for it to be effective we either needed the complete battle, or pairing down some of the ridiculous visuals so that the poignant deaths (Ygritte) could actually have time to breathe. IMO they should have split this up into 3 battles like in the books, had it span a few episodes, and move the Viper vs. the Mountain to E09.
Â 
My only guess as to why they didn't do that is that had the duel been in E09, maybe too many people would have predicted Oberyn to lose.Â 
Â 
I liked so much about this episode, but it just felt so incomplete that it fell flat. I think this will be kinder on re-watch, especially when I can go directly into E10, but I'm kind of getting sick of needing that mentality about this show.
1998	PrinceOfWesteros	2014-06-09	Icomplete and whatever you want, but not boring or bullshit, that's it. At least the battle part.
1999	sj4iy	2014-06-09	i thought it was more a realisation that they can't kill each other. And Jon happy that she's alive and loves him too...or even that he was happy to see her one last time and that she would be the one killing him.Really, it's a very emotionally complex scene for having no words that it can be read in different ways depending on your view of it.

2002	High Sparrow Little Bird	2014-06-09	ASOS didn't do much justice to the Stannis arrival at The Wall, so i'm not surprised if the show doesn't either. Â I assume that D&D will spend no more than 10 minutes on this next week, which means they could have made episode 9 about 7 min longer and cut back on some of the pre-battle scenes. Â That being said, I think scenes like Gilly/Sam and last weeks Grey Worm/Missendei scenes are put in to break up the bleakness of the rest of the episode.

2009	Ferocious Veldt Roarer	2014-06-09	Â 
Epic half-battle. They didn't finish it, did they? There were definitely cool aspects to it, but it was an incomplete story. If they wanted to break it up so that the interpersonal stuff could shine through, then they shouldn't have lumped the attacks together in the first place. They wanted an extravaganza for Episode 9, but for it to be effective we either needed the complete battle, or pairing down some of the ridiculous visuals so that the poignant deaths (Ygritte) could actually have time to breathe. IMO they should have split this up into 3 battles like in the books, had it span a few episodes, and move the Viper vs. the Mountain to E09.


Â 
But it's as finished as it was in the books. They repel the attack, then there's a big interlude of Jon Snow being accused of treason, Jon Snow being sent to "parley" with Mance, etc. So in this instance the show pretty faithfully follows pacing of the books.
It sets up a collection of narrative climaxes for the season finale. Stannis coming North, Tywin not, after all, shitting gold, a goodbye between Arya and the Hound, and in Essos who the fuck knows, but maybe we'll see some boobs.Â

Jon's climax for the season finale should have been him becoming LC. Now that will either be rushed or pushed to next season. So in that respect, it deviated from the books. They tried to fit something into E09 that should have been earlier in the season, because they wanted a large, fabulous battle for the penultimate. Which is why they combined two fronts of the battle. If they were true to the pacing of the books, they would have repelled the Thenn-attack, dealt with Ygritte's death there. Then dealt with the siege. My point is that if you're going to mush that together to make a Helm's Deep episode, then you better also include Gandalf's arrival. It just fell a bit flat without it.

What do you mean, "movedÂ to next season"? Kingsmoot belongs in the next season. It's something like 11th chapter of AFFC.

2036	Chebyshov	2014-06-09	Oh lord, the Ironborn weren't afraid of the dogs, that was just kind of their "well this just got not worth it" moment. Theon bit Yara ffs. This was obviusly a lost cause. D&D were trying to create buy-in to her character, so that we understand what compells her next year for the kingsmoot, which I think will be left in. And it does belong in next season, so I'm not sure why we need them next episode.
2037	Greywolf2375	2014-06-09	D&D freaks are cute too.


Â 
Â 


Â 
Ridiculous. Â anyone paying any attention knows the wildlings still have the upperhand x1000. Â they were just scoping things out like Jon said. Â Stannis will still save the day. Â Almost seems like some stuff may be pushed into next season though. Â Tyrion/Tywin possibly??


Â This.Â  Paying attention to the last few episodes, how many times was it said there are more than 100,000 wildlings out there?Â  And how many were killed in the battle?Â  So there's still more than 100,000 out there and the NW lost...40% of their men?Â  That fight might be over, but the battle is far from over.Â  Stannis not showing up in the middle of that fight is fine - my hope is that they don't go back to the wall until the 2nd to last thing next week.Â  Have Jon with Mance...have the horns blow and watch Stannis and his men run through the Wildlings right after Mance says he will crush all the crows.Â  He gets his moment in the sun.
Â 


Whats all this bitching? The Watch won that first assualt all on their own. Book purist and their BS I guess.


Â This isn't anything with book purists...it's specifically about Stannis not showing up in this episode.Â  It actually is following the books from that standpoint.
Â 


Really? I thought this place was full of "D&D are great" cult members.Â 


Â Just because someone doesn't think that Stannis not showing up isn't a crime doesn't mean they are D&D fans.
Â 


Leaving Stannis out was definitely the right move. It would all have been too rushed otherwise.


Â I agree.Â  Since they have decided to add in a lot of filler/additional scenes it needs to go back to episode 1 -Â and prior seasons -Â to drive the critique of the sitation being rushed or split.Â  Could this have been handled in one episode?Â  Maybe, but I don't think it would have looked/felt as strong.Â  While I would have liked a better cliffhanger ending - Snow getting to Mance's tent maybe - I think splitting it is going to be fine.Â  Stannis will come in and save the day with his men, the NW will live on and next season we will see the discussions about the castles of the NW being turned over.

Â 
I wouldn't say "flat". Rather "incomplete". It's not a bug, it's a feature, that's how the penultimate episode is supposed to be. Ideally, to make you jump from your chair and angrily shout "where is my fucking conclusion?!" at the screen, and impatiently wait whole week for the finale.

2039	Daemon I Blackfyre	2014-06-09	Woh, they killed Pyp, Grenn and Thorne (probably?).
C'mon...Why all three? I could understand Thorne's death since he doesn't do much else in the books after this. Well to be fair it's the same thing for Grenn and Pyp, but they are Jon friends and greatest allies in the Nightswatch along with Edd, Sam and Satin after he's elected commander. In the show there sure isn't a lot of memorable NW characters left, so why kill off even Grenn and Pyp? Bad mistake imho.
Â 
Everything else was pretty much great. Even tough I dislike how they captured Tormund...This is going to make everything way too simple for his sub-plot in the show.

Â 
What exactly do Grenn and Pyp do in the books that as a show producer you would think "We need to keep paying these guys?" The siege needed to have meaningful casualties, and those two characters do basically nothing later on. In aDwD they're basically forgotten, and I don't think Thorne is dead since it looks like he just sustained a non-lethal injury. I do agree that they need more notable NW characters, but they need to be officers to setup Jon's tension and difficulties as LC.Â

Â 
All the other penultimates had some sort of resolution, as far as episodic narrative goes. We find out the sword swings through Ned's neck. We see Tywin & the Tyrells save the day. We see Robb, Talisa, and Cat murdered. We jump out of our seats because it's like, "well what happens next!?" Not because the story is incomplete.
2042	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-09	The biggest problem I am reading people having is this:
Stannis didn't get his moment and now unsullied won't like him. 
Which is wierd because Stannis doesn't arrive during the battle of castle black in the book either. 
He arrives days later. 
People are saying "but Tyrion will take away from Stannis" etc which to me just stinks of a lack of faith in Stannis himself. 
Surely a real Stanstan would be  thinking "Stannis is gonna detract from Tyrions big moment"
Tbh, who cares what unsullied think of stannis? Apart fom everyone here, who seem to really care what they think.

^ I agree. For the record, I really liked the Ep. But yeah, instead of all those pointless fillers this season (Missandei/Greyworm) they should have actually built the storyline of the attack on the Wall over 2-3 eps and ended Jon's arc this season with him becoming LC.

However, the power of LS, was that is how the book ended...leaving the audience on that particular note. Â Throwing her in somewhere randomly next season, it loses it's dramatic feeling. Â
2055	boojam	2014-06-09	More viewers does not mean more quality. The sopranos was a once in a lifetime treat. This might have more viewers, but it is not better.We have a disagreement about the quality, from the ratings everywhere the indication is that the show is held in high regard.I even left a link somewhere to an essay that claimed it was the best TV show ever.Anyway Time-Warner is crying all the way to the bank.
2056	teej6	2014-06-09	Â 
What exactly do Grenn and Pyp do in the books that as a show producer you would think "We need to keep paying these guys?" The siege needed to have meaningful casualties, and those two characters do basically nothing later on. In aDwD they're basically forgotten, and I don't think Thorne is dead since it looks like he just sustained a non-lethal injury. I do agree that they need more notable NW characters, but they need to be officers to setup Jon's tension and difficulties as LC.Â 
They are making room for Stannis & Co.
2057	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-09	No idea. In the Wyman casting thread some guy came in and said that In an interview Cogman said he's being replaced by Umbers...then failed to provide any kind of link. Could be a total falsehood...but with Osha going out of her way to mention taking Rickon to the Umbers...and with how they're condensing things to give Sam and Gilly more smoochie smooch...sticking to the seven season plan would really leave no room for the Manderly's.

Yeh, like the Red Wedding was so underwhelming in aSoS because it happened 2/3 of the way through. Sigh.
Â 
It's the single most vivid event for me in all five books for me and surprisingly GRRM didn't need to end the book on it to make it powerful.

2059	AIex	2014-06-09	Absolutely great episode in my opinion.
Didn't have any really unnecessary stuff like exploding heads or conversations about beetles fortunately. Love how it stayed pretty close to the books, but included interesting new stuff like Samwells and Aemons dialogue or that scythe, which was probably the fucking coolest thing in the whole episode. Pyp's and Grenn's deaths were pretty sad indeed, but since they didn't introduce too many other nights watch members like Noye or Dick Follard, I guess someone just had to die lol.
Â 
I actually think that Stannis showing up wouldve been a bit too much for a single episode, but hopefully it'll be in episode 10 because thats certainly one of my favourite scenes of the whole series.
Â 
For some reason this episode made me remember that one dialogue of Bran and Eddard in the very first chapter of Game of Thrones. I think it really suits that episode, especially the fight against the giant.
Bran: Can a man still be brave if heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s afraid? Eddard: That is the only time a man can be brave.
2060	teej6	2014-06-09	Â 
Will have to be an Umber since people in casting are saying Cogman confirmed Umbers replacing Manderly.
Seriously?
2061	Starksmustwin	2014-06-09	really thought we'd get some Stannis. I do think that his moment was taken from him. hopefully in ep. 10 his moment wont be rushed. It'll be interesting to see how they fit everything in with ep. 10. Bran gets to Bloodraven, tyrion/tywin, Stannis, Dany, Arya/houndÂ and, I very much hope, Lady Stoneheart reveal. Gonna be a lot!


Â 
Â 
This wasn't a Stannis moment. Â It was a NW moment. Â Something that has come way too few and far between in the TV series. Â This was about Jon. Â  And mark my words, Stannis will get maybe a minute or two and that will be it. Â They'll likely have Â Jon in Mances Tent while the Wildlings once again march on the wall. Â An army will roll in and start fighting them and you may get one shot of Stannis sitting in the back watching. Â That will probably be it. Â And this forums tears will be plentiful.
2062	boojam	2014-06-09	Oh lord, the Ironborn weren't afraid of the dogs, that was just kind of their "well this just got not worth it" moment. Theon bit Yara ffs. This was obviusly a lost cause. D&D were trying to create buy-in to her character, so that we understand what compells her next year for the kingsmoot, which I think will be left in. And it does belong in next season, so I'm not sure why we need them next episode.That was a badly written, and bizarrely edited scene.From the last shot , you are right, it did not look like Yara and here men where afraid of the dogs, they could have killed the dogs anyway. How did Ramsay know the dogs would not go after him?The dogs were all in a froth.That whole scene looked as if had been taken apart put together again (with a missing Ramsay scene) in a few days.

Â 
Well, I'll withhold concern until more casting details are leaked. But if they do end up doing this, then I guess it shouldn't be that surprising. GreatJon is still alive, so we at least would have a vaguely familiar face. And they did mush the Vale Lords together into 3 people. But you'd think they'd keep the most important one? Manderly had such a distinct personality, and all the White Harbor stuff was really cool. I'm hoping the person is wrong, but only time will tell.
2064	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-09	i had very mixed feelings on this episode...
Â 
the main problem is i had too high expectations of how far the story would progress...i did not expect 50mins devoted to only the first skirmish...i honestly expected they would show this much in about 25-30mins...then 5 jon with mance, then stannis attacks and another 15-20 mins of battle
Â 
anyway, what i liked about the ep -Â 
- GHOST! even if for 2 seconds
- action was up to par IMO
- fire was impressive
- Thorne actually admitting that Jon was right
- Jon's fight against the Thenn, finally redeemed himself as a worthy fighter
- the anchor was amazing
- ygrittes death was done well, not too much time wasted on it
Â 
what i disliked about the ep -Â 
- ofcourse no stannis
- too slow progression of story
- no one actually giving Jon the wall, but that he took it himself (mixed feelings about this though cuz in a way, its more mature of Jon to take command himself rather than wait for someone to force it upon him)Â 
- not enough giant/mammoth action
- tormund captured a bit too easily IMO
Â 
what i thought was very weird about the ep -Â 
- sams sudden maturity
- slynt hiding in same cellar with Gilly
- gillys baby not crying at all throughout the whole way from moles town to the wall
- less than 10 seconds devoted to Ghost
- why Thorne did not make an appearance after the fighting was done and before Jon decided to go speak to mance on his own
Â 
all in all, i would give the ep a 6.5 or 7 out of 10 if im being very generous
2065	sabrecmc	2014-06-09	I really liked it.Â  Jon said that Mance was just sending a small force to test their defenses.Â  I thought that made total sense and really put the dire circumstance of the NW into perspective since they almost got their asses handed to them without the full force of Mance's army coming at once.Â  Maybe it isn't as epic as the book, but it didn't disappoint me just from realistically what a TV show is going to be able to do.Â  Jon got to be smart and brave and self-sacrificing, so I'm happy.Â  And Ygritte is dead, thank the gods.Â  I guess I'm easy to please.
Â 
On the other hand, if we don't get "Edd, fetch me a block," I will seriously riot.Â
2066	Gustavo	2014-06-09	Tywin dies, Stannis arrives, The Hound dies, Arya goes to Braavos, Drogon eats a child / dragons gets imprisoned, Lady Stoneheart(?) all for next episode?
2067	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	Yep!
Â 
They could even end up adding in some Ironborn and Bolton plots too. Its going to be packed and could end up getting very rushed with a lot of stuff overlooked.
2068	Carl Rhaego	2014-06-09	I loved the episode but I hate d&d for pointlessly killing or not even including all my favorite secondary characters. I hope Strong Belwas will become the Prince that was Promised, Rakharo will be the Night's King and Irri, Pyp and Grenn will be the three heads of the dragon. Pls GRRM, that will show d&d!

Â 

Â 
Â 
I don't want to get to involved with your list (much of which I agree with), but this one thing I think can be chalked up to the show-runners wanting to leave themselves enough room for options. Â They may not want to bring Thorne back for next season, in which case they can say he dies off-screen; this will have the added benefit of removing yet another obstacle for JS' rise to LC. Â However, they may want him to live, and in order to do that they need him to live... silently. Â Alive so he can stick around for season 5, but not so alive that he can influence decisions and/or become LC of the NW. Â 
Â 
I think the creators are giving themselves "plausible deniability" as to whatever they decide later on. Â Frankly, I think Thorne's a great character that they added a lot of flesh to over the seasons; he is a jerk and a vicious Taskmaster, but he really is a true man of the watch and his determination is exemplified in his very harsh attitude. Â At the same time, he is not "vital" to the story so I can see them offing him. Â 
Â 
Â 
(And, my god, the arrogance of the people who defend everything in the show is rising to a level that rivals the most avid cult-member; disagreement is treason, right?). Â
2072	SkaggCannibal	2014-06-09	All the people saying this episode is bullshit, you deserve to watch a pathetic money grabber serie like the walking dead. Not even have the intelligence to appreciate hard work that the production have made for this epic battle.


Sorry I don't fall on my knees for the people making fat money by butchering my favorite fantasy series.

2076	SkaggCannibal	2014-06-09	Another Stannis man crush that blinds people to everything. I swear the Stannis heads would be ok with it if the comet crashed into westeros and wiped half it off the map if it benefited Stannis in some way. So you'd rather change the events of the book COMPLETELY just so Stannis would appear at the end of this episode? So silly. He's obviously going to show up next week, as he is supposed to and he'll have his 'big' moment. D&D are remaining faithful to the book. Usually they are praised for this. I don't get it.


Lol can't you read? I said they just shouldn't have wasted all their time on silly Sam conversations so that the next morning/day would have fitted into the episode. That is not changing anything, it's just not wasting time. Now it will still be Stannis coming in the next morning, only in the next episode. It would not have been that hard to have in the same episode.

I hope you aren't under the impression that because we have to wait a week for it, Stannis will actually arrive days later. That's not how television works .

People don't care if the show is faithful to the books if the show makes their favorite character look cool. Â Blackwater Stannis was nothing like the character in the books.

Â People say D&D let their biases get in the way but if some of the posters here were writing this episode, Sam and Gilly would have been killed by Wildlings, Jon is about to killed by Mance, when Stannis swoops in a dragon, chomping on a cigar and says "Hasta la vista, Wildlings."Â

2085	WeirwoodWorshiper	2014-06-09	Good episode, fantastic battle sequence. I was a little disappointed they killed both Grenn and Pyp, however Grenn died beautifully and Ed got the wall! highlight for me was seeing that scythe.
Â 
I think they have enough time in the last episode to resolved Arya and the Hound, for Bran to have a dream about the tree and three eyed crow, for Jon to chat with Mance, Dany's dragons to burn some children, Tyrion to have the mother of family disputes and for Stannis to show up right at the end, so long as there's no more idle beetle chat!Â
2086	IceFire125	2014-06-09	I hope book readers caught this part when Jon and Sam went down from the top of the wall to help out with the fight inside the castle.
Â 
Jon: I don't want you out there.
Â 
Sam: You can't protect me forever, there won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
Â 
Jon held out the key to Sam (to unlock the door where Ghost was being held)
Â 
Jon: I need him more than I need you.
Â 
Did show runners just foreshadowed the events at Jon's stabbings? Not the detailed explanation of 'second-life' of a skinchanger (Varamyr's prologue), but I think it adds weight to the theory, in my opinion.

Sam's about to get some show POVs next year like Briene did this year. Â  And you really think them trying to get him some development time was the wrong way to go?
2088	teej6	2014-06-09	I think the Jon/Mance meet next Ep won't be a short one. You don't cast someone like Ciaran Hinds and give him just 5 mins. But then with D&D nothing is certain. Also did anyone else notice a knife to Jon's throat in the preview. My apologies for going off topic
2089	Big Daddy	2014-06-09	I liked the episode quite a bit. I liked having the entire episode devoted to the siege on the Wall, and the buildup to it. It was jarring to have the episode end where it did (especially 9 or so minutes shy of an hour) with no Stannis/cavalry scene.
Â 
I'm trying to look at it objectively this morning. I'm not a huge Stannis fan, but I do like the character more and more as the books go on. I think some of his hardcore fans are just fuming that he didn't GET his big cavalry moment at the end here where it makes sense to put it. I agree with that...to a point. The other side of that is that this isn't Stannis' story, it's Jon and the Watch's story.
Â 
I'm feeling like it should have been included here, but my entire opinion of that depends on how well they pull off next week's episode. If it all comes together right, if the scenes are constructed well enough and the editing it done right, all of those things that need to happen can. They should make use of the musical montage at the end to show things like Arya getting on the ship with her coin, Dany locking up the dragons, etc. That can all be done musically without dialogue very effectively. Hell, they can even have 3 scenes at the wall; Jon getting saved by Stannis at the beginning, showing the need for an election for aÂ new LC, then at the end the crows chanting "snow!" and all the coins comedically being tossed in the thing. I can picture all of this in my head, how it would be shot.Â 
Â 
Of course, I pictured last night's episode in my head too, how it would be shot with Stannis saving the day at the end. That may be a problem a LOT of us have here, last night's episode didn't play out the way we envisioned it in our heads. Something to think about.

2096	Clocksquirrel	2014-06-09	Given that Mance has not appeared at all in this series, that we've just had an entire episode at the wall, and that putting in Stannis's attack would require all of the Stannis crew to be shipped to a new filming location for a scene or two, it seems unlikely that we'll see anything else of the wall next week. Surely it'd be more convenient to save the Jon-Mance-Stannis confrontation for next season and just pack next week's episode with the mass of other stuff they have left to cover?
Â 
Which wouldn't bother me to be honest, Stannis is still coming

2098	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-09	They've already shown Stannis' calvary riding through the forest in several previews.
2099	Big Daddy	2014-06-09	Given that Mance has not appeared at all in this series, that we've just had an entire episode at the wall, and that putting in Stannis's attack would require all of the Stannis crew to be shipped to a new filming location for a scene or two, it seems unlikely that we'll see anything else of the wall next week. Surely it'd be more convenient to save the Jon-Mance-Stannis confrontation for next season and just pack next week's episode with the mass of other stuff they have left to cover?
Â 
Which wouldn't bother me to be honest, Stannis is still coming 


Â 
Â 
And have ASOS stretch over THREE seasons?
2100	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-09	They've already shown Stannis' calvary riding through the forest in several previews.


Â 
stannis' army making an appearance for sure...but im starting to doubt if we will get more than just a glimpse of him in battle and such...no real interaction with anyone, no conversation...just battle and maybe victory
2101	Alex21	2014-06-09	I hope book readers caught this part when Jon and Sam went down from the top of the wall to help out with the fight inside the castle.
Â 
Jon: I don't want you out there.
Â 
Sam: You can't protect me forever, there won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
Â 
Jon held out the key to Sam (to unlock the door where Ghost was being held)
Â 
Jon: I need him more than I need you.
Â 
Did show runners just foreshadowed the events at Jon's stabbings? Not the detailed explanation of 'second-life' of a skinchanger (Varamyr's prologue), but I think it adds weight to the theory, in my opinion.
Â 


Â 
Please, explain it.
2102	Lord Jennings	2014-06-09	Stannis will be there next week. That I assure you.
2103	The Taxman	2014-06-09	Stannis will be there next week. That I assure you.


Â 
Well no shit.
2104	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I think the Jon/Mance meet next Ep won't be a short one. You don't cast someone like Ciaran Hinds and give him just 5 mins. But then with D&D nothing is certain. Also did anyone else notice a knife to Jon's throat in the preview. My apologies for going off topic


Â 
Nope, I saw it, too. Â Looks like Jon is about to get his throat cut...wonder if they'll have Stannis come in at just that moment. Â I have a feeling it will be very, very tense.
2105	Clocksquirrel	2014-06-09	Â

Â 
They've already started leaking AFOC and ADWD into the fourth series, I don't see why they wouldn't leave some ASOS stuff for next series, you only have to look to Balon Greyjoy to believe that...
2106	Ferocious Veldt Roarer	2014-06-09	Â 
People don't care if the show is faithful to the books if the show makes their favorite character look cool. Â Blackwater Stannis was nothing like the character in the books. Â With The Watchers on the Wall, people are pissed that the show didn't rush the initial skirmish, downplay the Night's Watch, and make the episode about Stannis. Â People say D&D let their biases get in the way but if some of the posters here were writing this episode, Sam and Gilly would have been killed by Wildlings, Jon is about to killed by Mance, when Stannis swoops in a dragon, chomping on a cigar and says "Hasta la vista, Wildlings."Â 


Â 
Pretty much.
There were complaints about the Meereneese wholesale crucifixion, even though it had more screen time than in the books, looked appropriately gruesome, and showed Dany as more bloodthirsty and more reason-resistant than in the books, as being "glossed over" as a part of consistent "whitewashing" of Dany.
I remember, also, someone complaining that show!Stannis' reaction to Davos smuggling his nephew away did not include his famous "cart before the horse" line, even though in the book he said that much, much later, after the whole business with the Battle Beneath the Wall.
And now, as I see, some already complain in advance that the battle which took whooping half a dozen paragraphs in the book, in the show won't be appropriately epic.
2107	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-06-09	In the Entertainment Weekly recap, it was said that Ollie should have gone all Oberyn on Ygritte "This is for my parents! You killed them, you ate them!"

I have a feeling that will be the wildlings reaction when Jon first arrives at their camp. Â Honestly, I'm hoping Jon some how takes Mance hostage when all of the commotion starts outside with Stannis riding in. Â MOAR JON LOVE PREASE.

Â 
Yeah, if the posters here were in charge the episode would not have been called "The Watchers on the Wall" but "The Mannis."
2111	Clocksquirrel	2014-06-09	My bad! Didn't see there was a preview for the next episode! If Mance is there, then Stannis obviously will be
2112	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-09	I've heard that D&D sink Stannis' ship next week and only Davos survives. He rescued by Yara and they team up with Jon to kill Mance.
2113	Half Man	2014-06-09	I can't help but laugh at everyone that says the episode sucked and that D&D failed them bc Stannis didn't show up in the episode. D&D didn't fail anyone, I don't remember them even saying that he's in the epiosode to begin with. Calm your tits and just wait until next weekend. I would rather wait for the finale anyways bc now it's going to be the most epic ending to an episode ever! Tywin and Shae meeting their end by the hands of Tyrion, Arya leaving the Hound to die, and Stannis leading his army against the wildlings....yes the finale will blow some minds!!

ASOS is a book with a lot of content, and the showrunners neither showed us about what happened at the Iron Islands, nor showed usÂ  Balon's death
Â 


Â 
They've already started leaking AFOC and ADWD into the fourth series, I don't see why they wouldn't leave some ASOS stuff for next series, you only have to look to Balon Greyjoy to believe that...


Â 
I think they even put some TWOW in this season

Yes, I want Jon to be in command of the situation not take Mance hostage per se but in a position where it doesn't look like he's dead if it wasn't for Stannis timely arrival. I do want Stannis and his banners, however, to coming riding in all their glory. And please D&D make use of Dillane's talent more.
2117	David Selig	2014-06-09	I was quite entertained, but mostly at how bad the tactics of the wildings was, the incredible crossbow and bow shooting and by a lot of the fight choreography. There were some genuinely good moments, but a lot of it was Tormund, Jon or the Thenn leader killing random redshirts with incredible ease.
Â 
The Jon Snow - Thenn leader boss fight was just embarrassing. Jon Snow got his head smashed into a freaking anvil, but it didn't affect him any, not even a broken nose.
Â 
I love TV Thorne (and not just because he hates Jon ), the guy is just so cool.
Â 
John Bradley is a really good actor and does his best with poor material, but his scenes in the first 10 minutes were boring as hell. I couldn't care less about his or Jon's love life.
Â 
I would've preferred to see Stannis battle against the Wildlings given a whole episode instead, it is the decisive one, not this skirmish here.

I agree with this. Now its just being shoe horned into an already jam packed finale
2120	teej6	2014-06-09	He won't hate Jon for long <U+00F0><U+009F><U+009C>.  
Edit: Thought you meant Tormund. Yes, I liked show Thorne. They made the character more nuanced
2121	Cersei Hates Frogs	2014-06-09	I agree with this. Now its just being shoe horned into an already jam packed finale


That's what I'm worried about... I thought "Oh they're not showing the actors' (Stannis, Melisandre etc.) names in the opening credits to keep it a surprise" but no... I know the finale is 60+ minutes or something but I'm having trouble believing so many events can take place at a reasonable pace even with the additional ten minutes, give or take.
2122	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	I agree with this. Now its just being shoe horned into an already jam packed finale


The neglected King.
2123	Rockroi	2014-06-09	So, they should have taken away from some Sam character development for the sole purpose of having Stannis ride in and save the day? Â  Which would have completely undermined the awesomeness that was a few NW men holding the wall against poor odds? Â Â 
Yeah.. great idea...
Â 

Â 
Â 
But that's what happens- almost exactly - in the books. Â The battle for the Wall is nearing an inescapable conclusion with the NW running out of men. Â The book managed to have that drama and horror AND still have room for Stannis and it all made perfect sense and NOBODY felt that the Wall's struggle was somehow cheapened by Stannis.Â 
Â 
And I think you are confusing "Sam's Character Development" with "Scenes that Have Sam in Them." Â I think Sam developed as a character beyond the Wall and they could have had Sam's development without resorting to cliches and a labored scene with Maester Aemon. Â Sam's development came mostly with Pyp- pyp opening the gate, then at the front Wall and then with Pyp dying. Â Sam rose to the occasion in all of that. Â You could have trimmed a lot of the fat with Aemon and then with the scenes with Gilly and then with that terrible scene at the end and have a lot of time to spare. Â And you would not needed to sacrifice ANY of Sam's "development" (which, I maintain, was done better in prior episodes). Â 
Â 
I really dislike the ending because its a silly cliffhanger that is utterly unnecessary and banal. Â What? Â Did the show-runners think "Jesus, we may not get a big audience for the finale! Â Better leave them wanting more." Â 
Â 
And it leaves me with a dreaded feeling: that the show-runners are going to make a new scene beyond the Wall - maybe akin to the satire that another poster had before, where Jon and Mance make a truce and just as they are about to make peace, Stannis comes in and kills people. Â While that may seem silly, its would be in line with other ways they have undercut their most reviled character. Â Also, it has a sincere threat of getting list in an episode that will have enough going on already. Â
2124	Diablotion	2014-06-09	The next episode will be too full to make any sense. I hope they're not going to include any Vale-stuff. One episode would have been enough to handle this battle, I'm very disappointed DnD. I was waiting the whole episode for Stannis to make a badass entry. But no.. sigh..
2125	Enosh	2014-06-09	That's what I'm worried about... I thought "Oh they're not showing the actors' (Stannis, Melisandre etc.) names in the opening credits to keep it a surprise" but no...

3 mins for Jon and Mance "debate" 2min for the 5 horses riding down the wildlings and to show some stannis banners
Â 
and you know, I wish people would actually debate the arguments presented instead of making up some straw arguments so they can feel all smug about shooting down opinions no one ever used

Â 
That's the problem with the episode, in and of itself, there is nothing wrong with it, except that there is only one more episode to cram in a huge amount of stuff, including the penultimate Stannis event.
2127	Defeatarion	2014-06-09	I cant wait for 2 minutes of Stannis and the final 15 minutes being Dany crowd surfing slaves while a dragon screeches. Again.
2128	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-09	This episode kicked ass. Thorne is so fucking awesome. That actor is perfect, the loveable asshole. Grenn went out like a boss, sad to see him go, but the Aurochs showed his strength, Ollisatin with the snipe on Ginger Legolas cathartic. Next up Stannis is going to kick the shit out of Mance. The duels were great, the sets were fucking brilliant. Anybody hating on this episode either doesn't like action (Which is fine) or have some kind of weird mental block when it comes to rationality on characters and time limits.Â 
Â 
Aka three of my friends who said this episode sucked because there was no Dany
2129	Tyrion4President	2014-06-09	Sam is getting some great lines tonight.

Pyp: "Sam, I think we're all going to die"

2134	RoamingRonin	2014-06-09	If they follow the Stannis-saves-the-day scene just like in the books, people will complain its rushed. It's only like 3.5 pages long and most of the fighting happens off screen.Â
2135	Trebla	2014-06-09	I loved this episode. A full episode in one location giving time to have a bit of the quiet before the storm with Sam and Jon, Sam and Gilly, and a louder one with Yrgitte and the Thenns. I thought the Wildlings had a pretty good plan with theÂ Thenn skinchanger waitng to see the inferno on the other side of the Wall and then signaling the attack. It hit home that Jon's mission worked because the Watch was prepared, but not well enough as Alliser Thorne points out. His exchange with Jon was outstanding, his icy, vulgarÂ regret along with the correct notion that thye had no time to dwell on it now.Â The battle itself was outstanding. The production itself semed to greatly dwarf even Blackwater. The ice shrapnel barrels and the pitch barrels looked awesome and the giants and mammoths were incredible.
Â 
On Grenn and Pyp. It was a gut-punch. I didn't see Pyp's death coming, but when Jon sent Grenn down to the gate, I told my spoiler-loving Dad that Grenn was doomed. I think their deaths combined with Yrgitte's combined to put Jon into his Heroic BSOD (blue screen of death) and forced him into his suicidal mission to kill Mance. I've read people saying that the showrunners could have screwed up because maybe Grenn and Pyp might have had huge roles to play later in the books. It's not like the showrunners don't have the author as the co-executive producer who has given them the plot outline.
Â 
On Stannis: As other keep having to point out, over and over and over again, Stannis didn't show in the booksÂ until days later. In the book, Jon had command of the Wall for daysÂ and then was put in the ice cells for days. The Watch held out and to have them saved the same night by Stannis would cheapen their heroism.

2143	Mark the Red	2014-06-09	I thought this episode was fantastic. Â So did a lot of my sullied friends who watched it. Â I am a Stannis fan.
Â 
It accomplished excellently what I felt it needed to accomplish:
Â 
(a) Establish that Jon Snow AND the Night's Watch have true grit; the Oath Recitation under the gate as the Giant approached was excellent TV and story telling. Â I absolutely loved Samwell's line to Gilly about "Keeping promises to my brothers is what men do." Â Especially in light of recent events.....
(b_)Â Wildings are savage and WILL kill everyone
(c) Samwell Tarly is becoming more of a man; Â despite all the hate on this thread I like what they are doing with Sam: Â I believe Sam to be the most relatable character for most of the people who watch the show. Â  Overweight, timid, but bookish and intelligent. Â I'd wager HBO has done some market analysis on this and I'd wager a lot of people really like Samwell and Gilly. Â I sure do. Â All my unsullied friends do too. Â They are relatable and based on the characterization of Samwell I believe great things are in place for him in WOW and ADOS. Â To be honest, I find Samwell infinitely more likeable than Sansa, Littlefinger, Brienne but thats a whole other thread.
(d) Dramatic death of Yrgitte; very well done and all my friends teared up. Â Mission accomplished by D&D. Â Very well done.
(e) The Night's Watch won the battle BUT at too great a cost
(f) Giants are totally awesome.
Â 
I like Stannis a lot, but I feel all the criticism of him not being in this episode was unfounded. Â This episode was about the Night's Watch. Â Period. Â Full Stop. Â Stannis is NOT part of the Night's Watch. Â This is almost exactly how it played out in the books too.
Â 
There is plenty of time for next episode for Stannis to save Jon's bacon. Â  If I recall, the whole battle of the wall with Stannis was like a page or two in the book; why does it need to be a 30 minute spectacle anyway? Â Plus all we saw of Stannis in the book was the following day when Melissandre takes Jon to the top of the wall with Stannis. Â That conversation between Jon and Stannis on the wall was infinitely more interesting to me than the actual battle of the wall.
Â 
Also, just because Tywin is getting capped next episode why does this diminish the fact Stannis saves the Watch any more? Â  I am bittersweet for the Tywin scene because we are going to lose one the most compelling actors on the show (Charles Dance) and at the same time we are going to lost one of the most uninteresting actors on the show (Sibel Kikelli). Â  I hope the Tyrion strangulation scene is awesome. I have been looking forward to it for 3.3 seasons worth of shows. Â God I hate Shae.
Â 
This was an excellent episode. Â  I liked it more than the Blackwater because the good guys won this one. Â Fantastic TV.
Â 
PS: I watched the surprisingly good Godzilla movie this weekend and I found this episode even better in terms of special effects. Â No small statement that.

It's not like the showrunners don't have the author as the co-executive producer who has given them the plot outline.

Â 
Or they can just have their future book roles consolidated with Edd on the show.
Â 
Since Edd should be getting more screen time and dialogue anyway.Â  
Â 
It's nice to have Jon's whole clique around but in terms of filming the show, having too many of them takes away from all of them.Â  Grenn and Pyp die heroes deaths and Edd becomes Jon's main Lieutenant dude (especially once Sam leaves for Maester College).Â  Works for me
2146	DaveyJoe	2014-06-09	Yeah I think Sam was a highlight of the episode, he's really coming into his own, and he had some great one liners.Â  I love Sam and Gilly and people here are calling it filler because their favorite character, Stannis, wasn't featured.Â  Terrible.Â  50 minutes of fighting would be bad television without the character scenes to actually make viewers care.
Â 
Also Tormund was a total beast.
2147	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-09	Quote from aFfC: "Why do you think Maester Aemon was sent to the wall when by all right he was to become an archmaester?" I highly doubt it was his own choice.

Doesn't the new Awoiaf reading imply at least that Aemon and BR went to the wall by choice, possibly to ensure they couldn't be used against Egg?

Spot on, you've absolutely nailed it. This episode was about the brotherhood of the Night's Watch and it was bloody brilliant.
2152	David Selig	2014-06-09	Yeah I think Sam was a highlight of the episode, he's really coming into his own, and he had some great one liners.Â  I love Sam and Gilly and people here are calling it filler because their favorite character, Stannis, wasn't featured.


IÂ  am not a fan of Stannis at all and still though it was filler. I don't care about Sam's love life, especially when it is written so badly as it was in this episode.

Â 
Ok.
2154	Rockroi	2014-06-09	Just rewatched the episode - How anyone can give that below an 8 is beyond me.
Â 

Â 
I think my point is that you can give the episode an "8" and still maintain valid, objective criticisms. Â
2155	Gargarax	2014-06-09	For the first time, I have to agree that the show doesn't really do Stannis justice. I'm not at all a fan of Stannis, and I'll hate him even more if LS gets cut because Stannis will be given too much screen time in 10  But he is one of the most interesting characters of books 4 and 5, whether you like him or not, and his plotline was set up very, very poorly this season. Still, let's wait for next week until we give up on the show's treatment of Stannis. Next week will decide much about the show anyway - depending on what they cut or include, the finale could save or ruin the whole season.
2156	RainBow	2014-06-09	I don't know why, but the deaths of the two giants bothered me much more that it should have D:
Damn, I really feel sad about their deaths....
2157	Batman	2014-06-09	It would be cool to see Mance getting on his horse in his raven helm and riding off to get captured, or Godry Farring killing a fleeing giant, or Harma Dogshead going down.Â 


Â 
I don't think they will include Godfry. They did not include Donal Noye, I can't imagine Godfry being included. Best I hope for is Richard Horpe (since he is one of Stannis' chief advisers in ADWD), but I doubt that as well.Â

I wanted to hear the guys firing the ballista sing "The Last of the Giants" as they killed him. Call me cruel.

Glad it isn't just me.
2160	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-09	Did anyone else get the sense that when Aemon Targaryen was talking about the girl that he loved that it was the Queen of Thornes?


She said the person she seduced wasn't a Targ- I don't think Aemon is the type to never notice in the subsequent 70 years since then, that his true love never loved him. Plus I think Aemon is a little bit older than Q.O.T
2161	Relic	2014-06-09	So many questions. Why sacrifice two Giants to try to get through the gate instead of supporting them with a couple of hundred wildlings? Why does the second giant charge in by himself? Where are the other wildlings? I understand this was a "probe" by Mance but even so... A few more men and the the gate would have been taken and the Night's Watch slaughtered.Where are all the other men of the NW? Are they really down to 100 dudes in this show? Who is manning the other castles? Are there even other Castles? Are there no other gates through the wall in the show version? Also, how do you get smashed face first into an anvil, gush blood, and then walk away with everything intact? How does a little kid with a shitty bow kill a wilding with armor on? What happens to Thorne? He gets sliced a bit, two guys drag him off and he isn't seen or heard from again. Why are the wildlings attacking Castle Black so uncoordinated? What was the fucking plan there??

The other giant was visibly pissed when his buddy got shot...that's why he stormed the gate.

It's ok, bud. Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun, baby.
2165	Caerl Targaryen	2014-06-09	Are we supposed to care about prologue chars, especially knowing that hmm...all of them die? Please don't try to tell me they are one and the same.
That wasn't my point and I honestly don't get how you arrived at that conclusion. My point is the prologue established the concept for a reason. Using it later for Jon's survival is a logical reason for the existence of the events in the prologue. It's foreshadowing. Whether it's foreshadowing something in Jon's arc I don't know. But it's a reasonable conclusion.
2166	sj4iy	2014-06-09	How would you get that feeling? it could have been jenny from the block...it's not like he went into any detail.I did like how he said "She's more real to me than you are"...that was really poignant.
2167	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-09	Just talked to some unsullied co-workers. They want to know if the Sam/Gilly stuff has a point because it's boring and seems like a waste of time. I told them I'm under the assumption that indestructo baby will be the last man standing.
2168	Defeatarion	2014-06-09	Honestly having it look like a grim situation then Stannis coming in to save the day at the end of the episode is good enough for me. The guy gets shit on for screen time.

Â 
i thought that was the point...wildlings are uncoordinated...
think mance's aim wasnt to take the castle right away, remember that Jon successfully lied and mentioned they have over a 1000 men...thats y he sent the raiding part of Tormund and Thenn's to distract them, bleed the NW...with that logic it would make sense why he sent so few for a frontal assault on the gate, again to distract them, test their defenses, use up their arrows/barrels, bleed them a bit if possible...
Â 
about why Mance decided to attack Castle Black and not one of the other unmanned castles...that is something i wondered while reading the books as wellÂ
2171	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-06-09	I couldn't care less if Stanners was in this episode, but upon rewatch what bothered me is how cliche this episode was. By no means is it overly cliche compared to other TV shows, but as far as Game of Thrones goes this was the most over the top ep yet. You really get the feeling that GRRM was constantly rolling his eyes watching this.
Â 
Having said that, yay giants. Yay Ghost.

They freeze shut the tunnel when they abandon a castle, like Jon wanted to do at Castle Black.

i agree, i don't understand all the hatred out there... there was no way stannis could have made it into this episode, unless you just wanted to see him riding... jon has to meet with mance first... some of the reactions i've seen seem a tad on the childish side

Will that plot even exist?
2178	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-09	I think the episode deserves more than 6, tbh. 4 and 3 is kinda harsh, and yes, I'm pissed. but I'm calm down now...
Â 


Remember when the show runner said that there is a scene in episode 10 that is the most expensive effects shot they've ever done? And people were wondering what it could possibly be? Now we know, it's the Stannis charge.


Â 
I hope.
2179	BastardlyRock	2014-06-09	Assuming they keep the plot it would make more sense in the confines of the show to give that role to Tormund (as much as I hate to say it...  )
2180	Lann Casterly	2014-06-09	I'm glad they didn't try to jam Stannis in there, he had no place in this episode.
Â 
I love what they did with Thorne. Â On one hand I want him to live and continue to do his thing, but on the other, even though he is a dick that most people probably don't like, it would be sort of difficult to believe anyone would be chosen above him for LC if he were alive and able.

2181	Baltan	2014-06-09	I think this season will end with the Stannis army coming, so all the other plotlines will be in next season.
Â 
Val and Little Monster may be casted for next season. I can't see the point in burning Tormund when you already have a Rattleshirt character. Tormund is the key to the peace pact, and people really like him, so no, I don;t think he'll be burned. Unless they wanna make Mel look more evil than ever
2182	RumHam	2014-06-09	Isn't it far more likely the expensive effects shot had something to do with the angry dragons glimpsed in the preview for next week?
2183	Mithras	2014-06-09	Rattleshirt has been cast when Jon killed Qhorin. I don't think they will replace him.
Â 
By the way, did anyone notice something in the fight of Styr and Jon?
Â 
The sucker smashed Jon to the anvil and then threw him to the fire. This looks like he is "forging" Jon like a sword. And the scene ends with Jon burying the hammer to his head.
Â 
I think this was a nod from the show implying that Jon is the Lightbringer.
Â 
The mindblowing theory is here (a very long read but totally worth it.)

I think that's a stretch, tbh. I think they had Jon smashed into an anvil because they were fighting near a forge and they thought it would be dramatic. And appropriate for Styr, a tough and proven warrior, to be killed with a small hammer.
2185	Starksmustwin	2014-06-09	The next episode will be too full to make any sense. I hope they're not going to include any Vale-stuff. One episode would have been enough to handle this battle, I'm very disappointed DnD. I was waiting the whole episode for Stannis to make a badass entry. But no.. sigh..


Â 
Â 
Stannis would have to be bad assed for that to happen. Â  But he's not.... at all. Â  He's more whiny and entitled in the books than most of the ASoIaF forum goers here. Â Which says a lot. Â
2186	Phonzadellika	2014-06-09	Â 
Â 
How would you get that feeling? it could have been jenny from the block...it's not like he went into any detail.


Â 
Mostly it was how he was talking about bold women going after him. After the way the QoT was talking about vigorously coupling with Mace's dad (I forget his name) it just struck me that I could see a young Aegon being attracted to someone very smart and bold in that fashion, a la QoT.
Â 
It's thin, obviously, was just my gut instinct.
2187	Phonzadellika	2014-06-09	Looks like Val will not be cast and Tormund will replace her.

I hope you're wrong...Val is probably my favorite character in the wildling group.

2190	juanml82	2014-06-09	I should rephrase it to anyone skilled. He's essentially demolishing peasants before he fights Styr; the average Wildling is cake-fodder for Jon. As soon as he gets a somewhat skilled opponent (Karl, Styr) he's disarmed with relative ease to build "drama" that we don't really need. I'm not buying that he loses the sword again only so that as soon as he finishes Styr, which still was a decent fight, he can be unarmed when Ygritte has the chance to kill him to again build more "drama". He's laughably bad at fighting in the show compared to how he is in the books and again, that's kind of his only good quality.Â 
Â 
Plus having him mope around to the extreme and then just decide "My woman's dead so fook it, I'm going on a suicide mission" instead of just having a wounded Ser Alliser, or even Slynt, get one minute to order Jon to treat with Mance was just such a stupid plot. Seriously, they're making it very, very convincing that he is exceptionally daft and that easy to write off when the time comes. Show Jon basically deserves it already.


He's a Stark. It is in the genes.
Â 
As for why, or if, a TV show needs to build up drama, we'll have to disagree.

  Agreed!
Â

Â 
-Love Jon
2192	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-06-09	I was thinking that the Blonde Ufc fighter-turned-actress (Ronda Rousey?) should have a go at Val, she was in the season 4 premier I guess- and I don't know where I got that impression from, but she would make a great Val. I hope they don't drop that role, she kind of has a part to play in all the chaotic obfuscation going on during Jon's "et tu, Brute?" moment.
2193	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-09	Okay so I sobered up and gave the episode a rewatch. While I am incredibly sceptical of the decision to cut Mance and Stannis from this episode, I do think that the Battle of Castle Black was definitely one of the high points this season. I think that there was way too much time spent on Sam and Gilly's relationship, but overall, they really managed to pull on a lot of emotional heart strings with various character interactions and suprising casaulties. Alliser Thorne in particular stole the show for me. We didn't get the heroic death many of us were expecting, but we did get a really interesting development in Jon and Alliser's relationship, and I enjoyed their dynamic immensely in this episode. I realize that some people are going overboard about Stannis being absent, but I don't think that this criticism should be entirely ignored on the basis of that. In terms of a narrative arc, ending this episode with a cliff hanger instead of giving it a satisfying conclusion makes the sequence feel somewhat incomplete. There was more than enough time to allocate towards Mance and Jon before having Stannis make his charge, especially given the length of the finale. Seeing as the show deviates from the narrative in ways that are far more substantial, I don't see why giving Stannis his "Red Dawn of the Rohirrim" moment last night would have been a bad move, even if he does arrive days after the initial skirmish at Castle Black. There's still a chance to make Stannis' scene satisfying, and I really did enjoy the episode for the most part, but I guess I just would have preferred to have had all of the Night's Watch scenes resolved in this episode, rather than leave everything so congested in the finale.
2194	Janicia	2014-06-09	When I read that Jon was sent on a suicide mission to kill Mance, it seemed kind of over the top to me. Â Like "seriously - all this stuff is happening and you're going to be petty enough to send Jon on a pointless suicide mission that will almost certainly fail and probably backfire?" Â It would feel much more that way in the show because events played out differently. Â Also, Jon going on a suicide mission feels like a man might respond to watching the woman he loved die, sending a friend on a suicide mission, and being in a hopeless situation with a hero complex. Â
2195	Maid So Fair	2014-06-09	I felt this episode was a bit of a let down when I watched it this morning but on rewatch I'm starting to appreciate it a lot more. It had just the right balance of action and emotion and some of the shots were spectacular. With a TV budget they did an absolutely amazing job with the fighting as well.
Â 
I liked: I loved Jon, probably more so than I did in the books at this point (started to really like him in ADWD), and it was a great way of showing off both his fighting and leadership skills. Some great choreography when he's fighting Styr. I even like the change of canon with him going on a suicide mission voluntarily out of the sense of duty. Master Aemon is always a great screen presence, and so is Tormund. Har! The biggest shock was Allister Thorne, however, I didn't think there was any way for me to come to sympathise with him, but the show proved me wrong. The Night's Watch as such really came into its own this episode.
Â 
Nitpicks: The wildlings having a bloody BBQ literally next to the Wall. I get that it makes for dramatic shots, but it was just idiotic - being behind a tiny hill makes no difference when people are looking out for you from the top of a 700-foot wall. I was hoping to see Mance, he is seriously underused - but I suppose there's the next episode for that. Wish there was more of Ghost but I understand why that couldn't be.
Â 
It was pretty obvious that Stannis was not going to be making an appearance ever since the episode synopses came out. Who else was going to be that unexpected arrival from beyond the Wall if not Stannis?

2198	Janicia	2014-06-09	I wonder what they'll do with Ser Allister going forward. Â If Allister had died, Jon will be the only obvious choice for taking over as Lord Commander and there won't any dramatic tension in an election. Â They already had as much of a quiet moment together as they're going to have, so he couldn't be alive just to have a touching deathbed scene with Jon. Â Maybe Meliisandre burns him, but I don't think Jon could cooperate at all with Stannis if that happened, so it seems unlikely. Â So I guess he's alive to lose the election to Jon and be a continuous source of leadership friction. Â

I liked all the Jon changes especially re Mance at the end. And he's not THAT great with a sword in the books, and Styr has an axe with a sword breaker in it, it's pretty much designed to disarm swordsmen.
However, thanks to what they did to Jaime's swordmanship and look like they will keep on with, I feel you pain

I've been wondering about this too. If anything, Allister would seem to have the leg up in the coming election. Based on his leading the defense of Castle Black.
2209	acacia	2014-06-09	People do realise this is a TV show right? "why did the wildlings do this, what was the point in only sending 2 giants? Why not send a few hundred wildlings to help them. Jon getting his face smashed off an anvil and not having his face smashed in is totally unrealistic etc." it's a TV show that's why, most viewers aren't going to dissect the strategy of war between armies, or the damage done to others in battle it's all for entertainment purposes. TV Shows and Movies have been like this for decades, why are people surprised? Seems like viewers just pick up the stupidest reasons to put the show down.
As for the episode, it lived up to my expectations. The scene with the Giant firing the arrow was awesome and the Scythe! Especially when the camera pans behind two people watching it swing across who then just stand there in shock was unintentionally funny. Thorne was excellent too, his comments on top of the wall were hilarious "you cunts!". Also, GHOST!!
2210	Demnia	2014-06-09	I expected to see Stan. And it's actually wrong book wise as he shouldn't have come this early. But yes I expected him and that's only on me. More importantly, the only thing I fear is that is there is so many things to wrap up in one episode.
Â 
I'm not disappointed by last night episode though I wished they would have set up the pace differently. But my main concern about Stannis not being in last episode is : how are they gonna manage to wrap up so much in the finale?
Â 
Kuddos to the one who said (basically) "it's an adaption, enjoy it as it is : an adaptation". It'll never be the books, of course. And I feel the same way, I enjoy the show for what it is, I don't expect it to be so trully to the books. ADAPATION =)"
Â 
Just enjoy, as a bonus gift, an help to "see" the books. But that remain this, Â just a visual help to the books. And I enjoy it as such.
Â 
Can I have next book George now, Please? PLEASE? =)
2211	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-09	Â 
Â 
Wait.. so people were hoping Jon would turn gay? Â  Or am I just taking your comment out of context?


Nah, there are people who are shipping Satin and Jon, since Jon says Satin is a good looking dude. But then again there's a group of people who ship Arya/Jon.
2212	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-09	When I read that Jon was sent on a suicide mission to kill Mance, it seemed kind of over the top to me. Â Like "seriously - all this stuff is happening and you're going to be petty enough to send Jon on a pointless suicide mission that will almost certainly fail and probably backfire?" Â It would feel much more that way in the show because events played out differently. Â Also, Jon going on a suicide mission feels like a man might respond to watching the woman he loved die, sending a friend on a suicide mission, and being in a hopeless situation with a hero complex. Â 


Â 
Â 
Yeah, I am not sure how I feel about that change.
Â 
On the one hand, it makes Jon more heroic, and I guess with Ygritte dying it makes some sense. On the other hand, it removes some of the blinkered hatred we see from Thorne & Slynt, gladly throwing Jon's life away. (Plus the act as planned out itself is not honourable, and Jon's a Stark).
Â 
I guess I'll just have to wait and see how this plays out.
2213	Mithras	2014-06-09	I think Tormund will replace Leathers as well. He will be the master at arms and translator of the Old Tongue.

Â 
Â 
They did that with the Craster's subplot though - that was meant to be a suicide mission. It is certainly dishonourable but personally I like that as well as IMHO it makes Jon more human.
2215	Janicia	2014-06-09	Now I am coming to the conclusion that there won't be a LC election until Season 5. Ugh, just another reason pushing the Stannis scene up was a horrible idea.Â 


It seems reasonable that Jon's season 5 arc would kick off with the election, since season 5 is all about his tenure in that role. Â If the election happened this season, it would really only be a pointer to "look at cool stuff happening next season!", but a scene with Stannis would probably be better at doing that.
2216	wallofice	2014-06-09	I like Jon going to see Mance on a suicide mission as a response to Ygritte's death (which harkened back to Sam thinking he had nothing to live for before Gilly showed up alive with the baby)... But I thought it was a poor move for him as a future commander. He himselfÂ says there's no one around to command anything - I assume he either doesn't know Alliser's alive or else Alliser's incapacitated - and he's leaving the men even more vulnerable to future attacks that he knows are coming.
Â 
So while I get that he wants to try to end it himself without putting anyone else in harm's way, it showed a lack of regard for his fellow night's watch members that I don't think was intentional on the showrunners' parts. At this point, I don't see why Jon would make a better commander than either Alliser or Edd, other than because I know he's commander in the books.
2217	Woman of War	2014-06-09	I only watched the episode an hour ago and so I'm a bit late to the party.
Originally I thought I might not like that episode too much since so many of my faves are not in it but I was wrong.
And now, reading this thread I do not understand anything anymore!
This episode was closer to the books than most other episodes and now people complain about that!
This episode had a wonderful inner beauty with the quiet foreshadowing of death, the dread, the emotional intensity. i loved the emphasis on Sam, one of my favorite characters, I enjoyed the portrayal of Jon, who gets better and better.
And while I am not one about heroic pathos, I loved  that gem with the defenders of the gate, their straightforward pride and determination. First of all here but during the whole episode the show honored the Nightwatch. Before this institution had somehow been presented as run down pile of shacks inhabited by a group of lowlifes and peasants.
But here they were people with a cause, average guys and a girl who grow above themselves and who show what people can achieve when they know what they want to. Without heroic pathos.
Why should I care more about Stannis than about these guys? They deserve their story in full episode length.
And that from me who is more into politics and human drama than fight scenes. Not this time.

True, Sam didn't get a 12-page sexual contract signed by Gilly, with 4 witnesses and a probate judge, giving Sam all permissions, authorizations, endorsements, and both implied and express consent to give her a soft smooch on the lips.
Same trap Jaime fell into.


Â 
LOL. Make sure to get all that shit notarized too.Â
2219	Rashtibram	2014-06-09	Can somebody please explain to me the Wildlings' tactics (budgetary reasons exlcuded)? Why was Mance sending small groups of 15 people at a time to climb the Wall/breach the gate? Wouldn't it be a lot simpler and more effective to send his entire force at once?
2220	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-09	Remember when we were happy that Stephen Dillane wasn't in the opening credits?

Â 
I was wrong Â¬Â¬
2221	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-09	Can somebody please explain to me the Wildlings' tactics (budgetary reasons exlcuded)? Why was Mance sending small groups of 15 people at a time to climb the Wall/breach the gate? Wouldn't it be a lot simpler and more effective to send his entire force at once?


Â 
According to Jon, Mance was testing their defenses.
Â 
Looks like it worked, 'cause that handful of Wildlings almost took the Castle.
Â 
Tho, to be fair, the NW could've easily won the fight if their cook joined the fight. But dude had to finish his stew.
2222	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I think Tormund will replace Leathers as well. He will be the master at arms and translator of the Old Tongue.


Â 
I'm all for giving Tormund more screen time in the show. Â He's an awesome character in the books, and I would love to get to know him better in the show.
2223	namifia	2014-06-09	Was anyone else annoyed that Jon abandoned the battle to cradle a dying Ygritte in his arms? Definitely not Lord Commander behavior. He could have saved one of his brothers in that time. Why couldn't their tearful goodbyes have happened a couple of minutes later after the battle was over? Why did the kid have to kill her instead of a random arrow? Seemed far to convenient.
Â 
At this rate, folks who haven't read the books will have no reason to think that Jon deserves to be LC. They'll probably accept it because he's a main character, but isn't Game of Thrones supposed to better than relying on TV tropes? Thorne seemed quite competent in this episode. Why should the brothers of the Night's Watch pick Jon over him? Other than that he's young, good looking and the main character.
Â 
From a dramatic standpoint, Stannis should have showed up, but from a narrative standpoint it wouldn't have made sense. The only way it could have worked is if parts of the battle (like the initial raid) had happened in prior episodes, which would have been a better choice. I've had serious problems with pacing in this season, as well as the effect many of the show-only scenes have had on the narrative. They could have taken out the pointless Craster's Keep sequence and spent more time on the lead-up to the battle, perhaps even had Ygritte's death occur in an earlier episode.
Â 
At its best, this season has still been great, but based on how the writers have struggled to weave together a narrative/prioritize in a way that makes sense even with ample book material to draw on, I"m having serious doubts about next season when they'll have to make up even more material and pull of some extreme narrative gymnastics in order for the timeline to make sense.Â 


Â totally agree
2224	Trebla	2014-06-09	Can somebody please explain to me the Wildlings' tactics (budgetary reasons exlcuded)? Why was Mance sending small groups of 15 people at a time to climb the Wall/breach the gate? Wouldn't it be a lot simpler and more effective to send his entire force at once?


Climbing the wall is HARD. As the saying goes, it defends itself. The whole plan was to distract the garrison with the huge army, have them on top of the wall, while the strike force attacks from the rear and takes the gate. Even the giants attacking the gate might have been just a feight to keep them on the Wall.
Â 
Another thing to remember is that Book Mance did not see himself as some hero or conqueror, he himself he wants to hide behind the Wall. And he would like to do so while keeping as many as his people alive as he can. I'm pretty sure TV SHow Mance is the same way.
2225	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I like Jon going to see Mance on a suicide mission as a response to Ygritte's death (which harkened back to Sam thinking he had nothing to live for before Gilly showed up alive with the baby)...

Â 
The thing is, he knows they are coming and he knows they are vulnerable, but he also knows there's absolutely nothing at all he can do to stop the Wildlings other than try to kill Mance. Â There's literally no other viable option left. Â If he stays and leads them, they will all die within a few days as the Wildlings continue their attack. Â This is his one opportunity to try to save everyone, even though it has a low probability of succeeding and will cost him his life (and it would be assured that they would torture him before killing him).
Â 
He's doing the best thing a leader could do in that situation, by taking the only real opportunity he has to stop the Wildlings.
2226	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-09	Lol if you're gettingÂ offendedÂ and saying I'mÂ lashing out because we have a difference of opinion and are arguing on the Internet over something I honestly don't know what to tell you except good luck. I'm not being uncivil in any way. I won't argue any further. Cheers.


:/ My jimmies were firmly in place so no offendedness going on.Â 
Â 


I'm hoping that Tormund takes over Sigorn's role. I'd love to see him marry a babe, get more lines, and get a Giantsbane (Bearfucker?) sigil. Think it'd be dope.


Yeah im almost positive this is a thing. Mostly cuz Tormund is more lovable and has been featured more in the show. Having him be the guy who winds up inadvertently forming a new house would be pretty cool. I see a lot of Tormund being redeemed as a character in the upcoming season. I think hes going to be one of Jon's biggest supporters (which is in line with the books anyway).Â
2227	ladybuc	2014-06-09	For a moment I was afraid they would let the Magnar of Thenn kill Slynt and not show the death he actually gets! That is one of the scenes I am dying to see! I hope they don't make any changes to it!

Good one!
2231	Gendrys Forge	2014-06-09	Jon Snow (Kit anyways) has become an absolute beast with that sword.Â  He brought down 4 blowsÂ from different directions onto Styr's axe in under 2 seconds, and he looked good doing it.Â  I don't know what happened, he has improved X10.Â  Id say Kit looks to be one of the top 5 sword handlers on the show at this point.

2234	hedgeknight001	2014-06-09	I consider myself a "Stan Fan," I suppose because bookStannis is one of the very few major characters that has a genuine sense of dignity, justice, and honor. And, I think that it has to be admitted, even if one isn't a Stan Fan, that D&D have intentionally butchered the character, and for the lamest of reasons: that in order for the show to be "edgy" everyone has to be scummy/insane/murderous/immoral. So, we live in a cynical age, and I suppose our entertainment will be cynical as well.
But, it also has to be admitted that the episode last night was well-done -- not perfect, the books aren't perfect and neither is the show, but extremely well-done. The ending was a little jarring, with Jon walking off into the North, but it was some of the best action tv that has ever been done in my opinion.
Just my 2 cents.

2239	mindingthesnow	2014-06-09	Common guys! I'm pretty sure D&D are not going to let us down, being fans themselves. We're going to get exactly what we want and in retrospect we'll be as pleased as we now are confused. Keep in mind that D&D are fans, that's why they're doing this show, so why on earth would they be doing anything that wouldn't make sense to us (fellow) fans!?
Â 
We're going to see Stannis kick ass; Tyrion kick ass; Danerys kick (dragon)ass; Bran see ass(ess); and Brienne biting the Hounds ass...sorry ear! So lets just enjoy the upcoming show and focus on WoW that'll come out 12/14!(?)!(?)!
2240	toffeejay	2014-06-09	Having only watched the episode about 2 hours ago but hearing this morning that Stannis fans were pissed I was actually expecting that the Nights Watch annihilate the wildlings or that theÂ  Baratheons come storming in while he broods in Dragonstone threatening to kill Davos for his own failings for the 100th time.

No character has been treated as shoddily as Stannis by GOT but I can't believe that people are complaining that he didn't appear. Unless the above happens next episode I'd reason he'll have more screen time in ep10 than the last couple of mins of 9.
2241	Shirlzknight	2014-06-09	Thanks for agreeing Jon was right about the gate, Thorne. Â A little too late don't we think.


And he was a dick about it- but yea at least he acknowledged he was wrong!
I am still chuckling with the 'Ginger Minge' comments. But poorÂ Ygritte - You know sweet f**k all Jon Snow!
2242	Nym sand	2014-06-09	I just cant wait till next season to see Jon cutting off Jonos`s fucking head OMG I hate this man so much from the books and the day I read that chapter was a happy day !! IÂ  just hate this man so much !! during the episode when he was running I was so scared that he will be killed by a thenn ! but thank the god the kept him !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2243	Cake	2014-06-09	Yeah, I think we were supposed to do one but the 2 shooting days were cancelled (probably due to budget restrictions). I was told by the AD on set though that the giant smashes his arm through, swats the guys on either side of Grenn then grabs me and pulls me through the gate "like a cheese grater"... For the final scene in the episode I wasn't required because they had a big trail of blood/guts which was me.
Â 

Â 
Â 
- One of the extras when asked about a fight scene between Mag and the watchmen Â 
Â 
If this is true then I'm not so sure if I would have wanted that scene after all.Â 
Â 
Not sure if I can trust him though, his evidence wasn't that convincing IMO
2244	The Red Melli	2014-06-09	I am sad Mel and her Army didn't arrive at the wallÂ  


Yeah. Totally thought the eagle we saw in the beginning would burst into flames by Melisandre at the ending ... They better not cut the eagle bursting into flames.Â  Â
2245	Ro0ster	2014-06-09	I was under the impression that Clive Russell would reprise his role as The Blackfish in season 4. Does anyone know whether he might appear in the last episode? I would like to see what happened to him after he survived the Red Wedding. Some friends who haven't read the book still actually think he was into the Red Wedding treason. They really need to show him still being loyal to the Stark cause; preferably still this season.
2246	intheswamp	2014-06-09	Edd, Thorne, Grenn, and Sam were all great. And, while I'm not a fan of the show's interpretation of Jon, Kit Harrington is great in combat scenes. Cowardly Janos was pretty amusing.
Â 
I know I wasn't supposed to, but I laughed when that kid gave Jon a what up bro nod after he shot Ygritte while Jon just has a dafuq look on his face.
Â 
A lot of awesome shots this episode: The Giants, giant arrow sniping, scythe, mammoth, etc...Â  I only wish we would get more Ghost.

Oberyn fighting the Mountain was incredibly shoddy, for example. Some better choreography and editing would have gone a long way to improve that fight. They've done a lot of things throughout the series that I've found completely baffling and nonsensical.
This episode wasn't one of those times, though. Even if it had a few problems. I don't know why so many were expecting Stannis to appear in this episode when he doesn't even appear at this point in the book.

2250	Rhaegar Targaryen's Ghost	2014-06-09	Well. That episode was awesome. It featured 3 of the best kills in the series (hammer to the skull, chain turning wildlings to mist on the wall, and my favorite, the giant's arrow launching a nights watch member from the top of the wall and pinning him to castle black on the south side). All in all i thought it was a great episode. i totally understand having Jon and Ygritte come face to face for the show. No complaints at all, other than only one episode left.Â

2252	echidna	2014-06-09	I really like what D&D are doing with the series. They have to deal with GRRM's very slow writing style and know they'll have to adapt an unwritten final book.
I think they're partially  taking different paths so that we won't know what plot points are a final book spoiler and what's their invention.
Also, I like what they've done with Stannis from the point of view of showing his frustration with the situations he finds himself in. And how he appeared to be The Villain in season two because Disney fantasy movies have brainwashed us to believe anyone using blood magic is evillllll - especially if its the new King's uncle. (Insert cliche Evil Uncle laugh here.) Now, thanks to the atrocities of the Boltons, the Thenns and the Red Wedding etc, that cliche is being soundly squished

2253	Pearlthegirl	2014-06-09	He is not whining; his character has grown evolved even better in the books where he cowered much of the time. I enjoyed seeing Sam grow and show every man can be brave even scared shitless.
^^Like!
He saved the girl and the babe.
Looked for Intel.
Went for reinforcements(top of the Wall and Ghost)
Inspired a kid.
Had some great comic relief lines with both Jon and Pyp.
Held and comforted a dying Brother.
And killed an EFFIN Thenn!
Jeez, when did he have time to whine this epi?
2254	diaur	2014-06-09	Why no Stannis?????? Just what I was waiting for the whole episode, how are they gonna squeeze it all into the next episode? We've had enough of the Wall, I want the other storylines (Tywin + LS) to evolve...
2255	JaegrM	2014-06-09	Does anyone else wonder if they're merging Thorne's character with Marsh's ?
Â 
Marsh got wounded and became more cautious/fearful, could we see a changed Thorne next season?
2256	Gort	2014-06-09	Why no Stannis?????? Just what I was waiting for the whole episode, how are they gonna squeeze it all into the next episode? We've had enough of the Wall, I want the other storylines (Tywin + LS) to evolve...


Â 
To be fair, they'd have had less room to squeeze him in this episode. Rather than panic now, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and wait a week, then panic. Still, even then there is a narrative problem with having Stannis come and save the day.
2257	sj4iy	2014-06-09	Think the buildup for the episode being weak was mainly due to the fact that season 3 and 4 were split.
Â 
Imagine a Jon snow season with
Â 
ep 1-2 jon/mance interaction
ep 4 scaling the wall
ep 6-7 - betraying the wildings
ep 9 - battle at castle black
Â 
same can be said for arya/stannis/bran
Â 
A lot of people suffered from the season split but it was neccesary to include a lot of moments.
Â 
next season will be the complete opposite.


Â 
Dunno how you get all of that into one season and still have room for all of the other people that needed to be in there, too.
2258	nara	2014-06-09	I don't know why, but the deaths of the two giants bothered me much more that it should have D:
Damn, I really feel sad about their deaths....


Â 


Â 
Â 
The other giant was visibly pissed when his buddy got shot...that's why he stormed the gate.


Â 
I really liked the younger giant's reaction to the other one's death.Â  I felt for him...
Â 
Â 


Looks like Val will not be cast and Tormund will replace her.


Â 
If there's one thing that D&D won't sacrifice, it's an attractive young woman who flirts with Jon!Â  They are more likely to invent reasons to get her naked.Â  However, she may not play the same role as she did in the books, which is a pity.
Â 


Jon Snow (Kit anyways) has become an absolute beast with that sword.Â  He brought down 4 blowsÂ from different directions onto Styr's axe in under 2 seconds, and he looked good doing it.Â  I don't know what happened, he has improved X10.Â  Id say Kit looks to be one of the top 5 sword handlers on the show at this point.


Did he have to use a sword in that Pompeii movie?Â  Perhaps the movie budget allowed for a great trainer.
2259	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-06-09	Â 
Â 
Â 
If there's one thing that D&D won't sacrifice, it's an attractive young woman who flirts with Jon! Â 


You don't think they're going to use Mel for that? Â I can see it coming a mile off. Â
2260	nara	2014-06-09	You don't think they're going to use Mel for that? Â I can see it coming a mile off. Â 


Oh, definitely--she does so in the books too.Â  Mel is totally going to do the seduction thing with Jon.Â  However, she can't be a serious love interest for him.
2261	Skeksi	2014-06-09	Well... my reactions to this episode were a very mixed bag.
Â 
Firstly, might as well get the obvious out of the way, I was not happy with a lack of Stannis in this episode. I assumed (apparently wrongly) that this episode would end with Stannis "riding to the rescue", so to speak, as all seemed lost- a kind of "positive cliffhanger" to end the episode with. As it is, it felt like the ending really trailed off a bit. The next episode is going to be really packed in now to finish all the arcs for the season, even if we assume that some characters are already done (I'm assuming Darth Sansa and Petyr won't show up again this season, and that we won't see any more of Ramsay and Reek, but I could be wrong on both counts), there's now another battle scene, and Jon and Mance's meeting, and Jon's election, we know there's still quite a lot of KL stuff to go too, plus tying up storylines for Bran, Arya and Dany. It seems like episode 10 could be very overstuffed, when a big part of the wall storyline could have fitted into this episode.
Â 
It was a shame to see Grenn and Pyp go, and the Ygritte death scene was done pretty well, but since this is probably the area of the show/ books I have the least interest in overall, it was a bit of a distant sadness for me. That's definitely a very subjective thing, though. I really, really enjoyed seeing Alliser Thorne get a chance to shine- he's a distinctly unpleasant person, and not well liked for a damn good reason, but he's also a brave, skilled fighter who'll do what he believes needs to be done, which is held up in stark contrast to Janos Slynt. Any scene with Dolorous Edd in it is a good scene for me, and his face when he was told he had the wall did not disappoint. If there's one thing to be said for an episode with so few "main" characters in it (you've got Jon, Sam, Ygritte, Tormund and Gilly in terms of characters who made it to the credits), then it's that it gave the supporting characters a chance to stand out more, and allowed the action to develop more than if it had been cutting away to other characters.
Â 
All that said... I still found it a bit anticlimactic. And that's possibly because of an overfocus on the Wall. I admit, as I said before, it's one of my least favourite plotlines and I find Jon Snow dull as dishwater, so I'm definitely biased. But I'm not sure it merited a full episode in the way that Blackwater did. Blackwater takes place at the end of S2, where King's Landing is basically THE main location, and Stannis is a major subplot. We saw Tyrion, Bronn and the Hound on the frontlines, we saw Cersei, Sansa and Shae in the palace waiting for the outcome, we saw Stannis and Davos in the oncoming ships, not to mention Joffrey, Varys, etc. There were a lot of major characters there, and it felt a bit more like it merited the focus of the whole episode. S4 has been a lot more spread out than S2, and the focus is certainly not as strongly on KL as it used to be, but it hasn't really been on the Wall this series, either, and there aren't nearly as many major characters there. Particularly for show only viewers, I'm wondering how popular this episode will prove.
Â 
To sum up:
Â 
- The episode was well done, but I feel they could have fitted more into it.
- Enjoyed the expansion of the role of supporting characters like Alliser Thorne and Edd.
- Given how many "big moments" remain in the series to tie up next episode, I worry that it's going to feel rushed.
- Think that Stannis's arrival when all seemed lost would have provided more of a "positive cliffhanger" kind of ending, as it was it fell a bit flat for me.
- Dramatic though it was, I'm not sure the battle at the Wall merited it's own "sole focus" episode.
2262	Jon-Michael Pearson	2014-06-09	This was the best epsidoe of the season by far loved how it stayed closer to the books.
Â 
ANd I gald the book really as not moved into book 4 at all outside of Theon.
2263	Wunhopkuendo	2014-06-09	I just saw the ep and I am so fucking angry and disapointet !! the first time in my life when I watch an episode from got and not go and rewatched quickly !!
Â 
Â 
not just because of Stannis let me tell you Â what did I saw worng and let me know if you agree
Â 
first I thought this episode will finlly showÂ us Jon snow the commander ! the leader !! instead they gave all the awasomÂ  scenes and speaches for Aliser thorne !!!!!!!
Â 
in the book there was that fucking perfect speach from Â Jon snow !! we didnt see enough of Jon leading and commanding this episode he was lost same as everyone esle !!
Â 
I didnt like sam running awayÂ after everyone I felt they didnt know whatÂ to do with him !!Â 
Â 
all the episoede was fighting without any point I am not saying that I didnt like these scenes I enjoyded but they could have let half the episode with sam going to Manc and show us something about ( Jourman horn - his pregnant wife and her sister ) then stannis arrivil ! we waited Â along time for this episode then they just gonna split it like this !! I just dont see the rest of the wallÂ events that still to come is fitt to the finale !!
Â 
Â 
now the finale is going to include the rest of ( Bran - AryaÂ  and the hound - tyrion with jaime and varysÂ and tyrion and shea - dany - brinne and pod - LSH ? - the rest of the wall sotry - Jon to be LC )

I mostly agree with what you wrote here and feel the same about Jon, both in the book and the show. If anything, I actually like the show version just a bit better, as he has evolved a little faster than the book version had at this point. I will disagree with you in regards to Stannis' arrival, though. In fact, I had to skip over 50 or so pages due to the same lame complaint of no Stannis. The Stannis fans want it all. They want him to be portrayed as he is in the books, yet fail to see any of his faults. They want the store to be like the books, yet complaint when he doesn't come to the rescue before he did in the books. As neither a Stannis fan, nor a Stannis hater, I want to see him get his due, which in my opinion the wall scene was perhaps his only shining moment in the series. To throw in a quick five minute rush job of him coming to the rescue would not have the effect that I hope the finale will have of him really saving the wall and shining a bright light on him. We'll see, but I think it will turn out better this way.

I hope they do. I would be sure as hell making one. Would love to see all those D&D crybabies argue against it.
2271	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-09	So I 100% understand the complaints about no Stannis at the end. Count me amongst the people that think it was a bad idea and will take away from the impact of Stannis's arrival. Having said that, I don't get why so many people are claiming Stannis will be breaking up some peaceful negotiation. In the preview Mance specifically says he will kill everyone in Castle Black. Jon also leaves Castle Black thinking there is a good chance he will not return. Yes I do think Stannis's moment may get overshadowed by Tyrion, but I don't believe Stannis will be made to look any less heroic in his actions. The show may have made the watch look a little too victorious, but Jon still made it clear that they are totally screwed. Letting Mance pass through the wall will be just as problematic as it was in the book and therefore, Stannis's arrival will still be very important.Â
2272	Theon {HUNGRY WOLF} Stark	2014-06-09	Well, thats what happens, when adaptatations try to prepare own story lines, or try to mess with the timeline. And once timeline is fucked (season 3) you try to streamline it to bring all strands of story on a even scale by creating fillers. You ignore certain storyline and it comes back to bite you in the ass.
Till last episode all filler scenes or so called character development was looking good on screen. Greyworm/Missendei is a prime example. In those two scenes it looked cute,but now in hindsight it looks unnecessary. Ditto Beetle speech. 
Regarding storylines. D& D have always treated Wall story as second class citizen in comparison to other stories.KL, Wherever Dany, Tyrion are, get preferantial treatment,maybe some degree of tweaking to keep them in good graces of Unsullied. We get it D&D, this show was your concept and you have every right to do with it as you please,but it shouldnt be forgotten that it was the popularity of books that enabled the show's initial success, so sometimes you should consider how a certain event has repurcussions for a certain character, in terms of their popularity in audience. You shouldnt always fuck it up, like you did with this episode.
Regarding character treatment. D& D have left no doubt that they truly hate Stannis' character in books and it looks like they will continue butchering his tv poryrayal.
I  mean if they can flesh out Cersei's character so much, despite having no pov till now, if they can flesh out Tywin despite having mimimal page presence, if they can create stuff to show how Varys/littlefinger work their intrigues , how come they decided to butcher Stannis's portrayal on screen. It clearly shows character bias on their part. If he wasnt doing some major shit in TWOW they might as well have killed him by now, just to save some dollars.
As for this episode, it was beautiful telivison,when seen as stand alone project. But when viewed in entirty of this season,  it feels disjointed from whole series. There is no smooth cohession with overall plot. Blackwater was also one-site episode but was miles better then Watchers on the Wall, because of proper build up whole season and a satisfying ending.
For people who hate the viewers who they call purists.
How would you have felt if Blackwater went like this. Mandon Moore is killed by Pod, Tyrion falls after being sliced across the face by Mandon Moore and then credits roll. Next episode opens with Tyrell/ Lannister cavalory charge and Stannis is forced to retreat after three minutes of screen time? You get the idea, why some people are pissed about No Stannis this weak.
Disclaimer; Not a Stannis fan, didnt like him till Wall story. So no need to throw vitriol at me. PEACE OUT.
2273	Milady May	2014-06-09	I really liked the episode, even though I'm not a fan of the fighting scenes in general, it just kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I actually screamed at the thing when Pyp died.
I spected Stannis to show up, because it felt like something that would work for the show, and possibly because I'd been reading about it here in the forums and I'm influentiableÂ (?)
But I absolutely can't complain when they for once stayed true to the books, it'll be really good to see the parley with Mance (if they don't screw it up, of course). It is going to be one heavy loaded episode though.
Â 
I liked Kit's acting this time (don't throw things at me), and Ygritte's stuff, and Sam. More Ghost would have been great, and it did seemed like they killed every black brother there, wtf.
Â 
I don't understand something, what made people think the LC choosing was happening this season? I can't make any sense of it.

With Tyrion's escape/murders, Daenerys locking down the dragons, Sandor's ''death'' and Arya's departure and Bran getting to the three eyed raven, theÂ victory at the WallÂ will be overshadowed i think. And it didn't had to be at all.
Â 
Just like season 2 was terrible for Daenerys story, i feelÂ the same is true for Jon's and Stannis stories this season.

The Helms Deep example is 100% the reason a lot of people are livid. The problem is more episodic TV. Guaranteed binge watching this will result in a much better result. But that's not how it's meant to be viewed so that's why people are pissed. This battle has been talked up for three seasons and we got 30 minutes of battle and 20 minutes of fluff.
2276	ServantOnIce	2014-06-09	This episode was as far closer to the book than Blackwater. Ending wasn't epic enough and should have ended with Stannis IMO.


True
2277	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-09	Mance specifically didn't send anything like his full strength in attack. He's trying to get an idea of the Watch's strength, he does it in the books too...

Â 


Â 
Material for Battle (Seige) of the Wall = Jon VII, VIII, IX, and X (All 4 chapters chock full of action)
vs.
Material for Blackwater = Sansa V and VI (nothing but girly jabberjawing), Tyrion XIII and XIV (Only XIV has any real action) and Davos III (Plenty of action)
Â 
So, yes I would have felt that the already spread thin Blackwater (2 real action chapters) was spread thinner.Â  However, plenty of material to work with at the Wall (4).
Â 
When I think of Blackwater from the books I think of one cohesive engagement.Â  When I think of the Wall I don't.
2280	thepooperthatwaspromised	2014-06-09	Without getting into the D&D likes/hates debate, or even whether or not Stannis should have showed up in this episode or not, there are some very practical, logistic reasons why certain characters get more TVtime than others, which has to do with set locations and cast bloat.
Â 
I think most book lovers agree that the 1st season is the most faithful season. It also had the smallest, most focused cast, and aside from Dany and the Wall, most of the action and character convening took place in either Winterfell or King's Landing. It was much easier to give everyone their due. Much of Dany's arc could be filmed on location but full sets with castles and interiors (which are expensive and time consuming) were largely absent.
Â 
As the seasons progressed and the cast bloated, characters became greater and more dispersed. To spend time on new sets with new characters, or even on already established sets with characters who have very little interaction with new and important characters becomes completely unfeasible in a show this expensive with already arguably the largest crew in TV history.Â 
Â 
This is why Brienne and Pod are together as soon as they leave Kings' Landing. To have Brienne on her own would have been a waste. This is also arguably why Jeyne Westerling turned into Talisa. Talisa had no family, no castle - No need for new sets or characters.
Â 
Which brings me to Stannis. He is such a solitary figure in the books, who after Blackwater and then 'Gendry (Edric)', has no real interaction with any of the other players. He's got Davos, Shireen, Melisandre and Selyse, but no contact with any of the other main characters. So realistically, how many times can we see him with those same characters doing the same thing? This isn't a criticism of his character, it's just a fact.
Â 
Sure, they can flesh out Tywin and Cersei, the Hound, Sam, (even Greyworm and Missandei because who else does Dany have other than Barristan and Jorah) because King's Landing and the Wall ARE focal sets (even though I think they've underdeveloped characters at the Wall horribly) and because Dany, like Arya ,is one of the MAIN characters through which other characters pass through and are introduced. Â Little time has been spent on the Iron Islands because no one else goes there so until it is absolutely necessary to go there, it's expendable. Likewise with Stannis, unfortunately. So, until he gets to the Wall and has something to do that involves other players, like it or not, little screentime is going to be devoted to him.Â 
Â 
Again, this is not to argue that what they have done with his charcter during the screentime they have allotted him is fair (I also feel that way about several other characters but I rarely see people complain about them as vehemently). I would have loved to hear about Proudwing already. I would have loved a lot of things. But in terms of screentime, and why they haven't fleshed out his character more yet, I totally get it. Â 
Â 
And just to weigh in on why he didn't get there in this episode -- like so many have said, this was the 1st and only episode just dedicated to the NW, and their 1 small victory, plus a breath to be taken (literally, as this was the 1st slow motion shot I think GOT has ever done) for Ygritte's death. Her death concluded a chapter in the book, it deserved a beat.
Â 
Stannis' heoric arrival does too, but the last several chapters of SoS were Tyrion, Jon as LC, Sansa, and then LS. If anyone got screwed out of not "ending" season 4 before the LS reveal, it's actually Sansa.
2281	Jorah the Explorer	2014-06-09	We needed Stannis at the end of the episode. Â It's my favourite moment of the entire series because it's the sole heroic climax, sometimes thought of as a fantasy trope.

2282	Chuck88	2014-06-09	I adored the entire episode on the first viewing up until it became clear that Stannis would not be making an appearance, thus cramming up the finale and also slightly diminishing the impact of his arrival altogether. Although that might turn out to not be the case.Â 
However on the second viewing, this is a truly fantastic episode. I can wax lyrical about the direction, the choreography, the editing and all the incredible effects to no end. i also remember being constantly in suspense from the first time we saw Joe Gatt's owl. Although that might have been down to some lingering PTSD from last week.
But it was the character moments that really stuck out for me. Sam guiding Pyp and Olly through the battle and death in the case of the former, whilst Janos Slynt cowered in that room where Sam downright refused to stay. Love is the death of duty.Â 
I can't say enough about Grenn. You constantly see interviews with cast members being asked how they would like to die on the show. "The way Grenn died" is probably the correct answer now. A heroic, blaze of glory death for the greater good is not something we've seen a lot of on this show.Â 
Then there's Jon and Ygritte. A little cheesy perhaps. But the infrequency of this sort of thing on this show make it feel somehow more real and incredibly emotional. I've always been a huge fan of Rose but this has been Kit's season in terms of acting and he absolutely nailed it again here and throughout the remainder of the episode.Â 
Even feckin Tormund! You can hear the self-loathing and blame in his voice when he calls out at Jon.Â 
Amidst all of it though, the character that I've grown to like the most is Ser Alliser. We talk about how Jorah, Tywin, Bronn etc are all improvements on their book counterparts. With Ser Alliser, the TV version is so far ahead it's unreal. Without going into too much detail, he encapsulates this 'grey' aspect as much as any character on the show or book. My own favourite character, Theon, included. So much props to Owen Teale.Â 
Anyway I still just wish we had Stannis arriving to round it off and probably confirm it in my own mind as the best episode in the show's history. I hope they have something special up their sleeve for next week.Â
2283	thepooperthatwaspromised	2014-06-09	p.s. having said all of that, if Stannis doesn't get proper screentime next season, then i might start agreeing with D&D hate Stannis crew.

Â 
When I think of Blackwater from the books I think of one cohesive engagement.Â  When I think of the Wall I don't.


Â 
Yes, this. Comparing apples and, um... peaches.Â 
Â 
However, if truth be told, when I think of the Wall action in the book, there were separate attacks. If I'm playing critic here, what exactly was the point of the simultaneous attacks? If Mance is feeling out the NW with a couple giants, a mammoth, and a few scalers, why waste good men attacking from the South? Why start the fire and signal a coordinated attack, if you aren't willing to devote major resources?
Â 
I'll call that a small beef. In the end, his resources are sufficient enough that Hodor could plan the strategy.
Â 
Also, the no Stannis thing: I won't comment on a bloated tenth episode until I see it and can judge it for myself.

Â 
Talk about instant death!
Â 
"If I had a hammer, I'hammer in the morning, I'd hammer in the evening all over this land...."
2287	teej6	2014-06-09	I saw the episode for the 3rd time and it gets better with each viewing. This was Kit's coming out episode and he did it with a blast. Contrary to what I thought up until now, the man has acting chops. And he's a master with the sword. Everyone's talking about the Thorne/Tormund fight but look at the choreography on the Jon/Styr fight and Kit's footwork. It's amazing. I just saw Weiss talking on Inside the Ep (or whatever that's called) and they really are amazed by Kit's swordplay. Another thing Weiss said was Jon 'assuming the mantle of authority without wanting it,' which really sounds like the reluctant hero trope <U+00F0><U+009F><U+0089>

Honestly, a simultaneous attack makes more sense than one at a time.  Castle Black is weak from the South, strong to the North.  Divide up the Night's Watch and you make them weaker than if you just attack one at a time where they can devote their full resources to it.  Strategically, what happens in the books doesn't make as much sense as what happens in the show.
2290	new djinn	2014-06-09	It's not quite the same with an episode that will be followed 1 week later, and a movie followed a year later...


Separating the third act while the other two go together is bad plotting IMHO. Either they are presented separate from each other or all together. Also most of the audience is casual and sees episode at a time. The story flow momentum is broken by the pause. I could bet good money that Tyrion scenes will outshine anything else in episode 10.
2291	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-09	We needed Stannis at the end of the episode. Â It's my favourite moment of the entire series because it's the sole heroic climax, sometimes thought of as a fantasy trope. Â The reality is it's the anti-cliche of the series, given that the depressing shock climax is far more prevalent. Â And now it will be shoved in as episode 10 filler.

Â 
I don't see why it has to be filler just because it's not the final scene. That would be like calling it filler in the books, or calling the RW filler. Something is filler when it's just extending the timeline with ultimately pointless plots until the major plots are ready to be set (See the majority of AFFC and ADWD).
2292	teej6	2014-06-09	GRRM loved the episode: http://time.com/2847...nights-episode/
2293	new djinn	2014-06-09	Without getting into the D&D likes/hates debate, or even whether or not Stannis should have showed up in this episode or not, there are some very practical, logistic reasons why certain characters get more TVtime than others, which has to do with set locations and cast bloat.
Â 
I think most book lovers agree that the 1st season is the most faithful season. It also had the smallest, most focused cast, and aside from Dany and the Wall, most of the action and character convening took place in either Winterfell or King's Landing. It was much easier to give everyone their due. Much of Dany's arc could be filmed on location but full sets with castles and interiors (which are expensive and time consuming) were largely absent.
Â 
As the seasons progressed and the cast bloated, characters became greater and more dispersed. To spend time on new sets with new characters, or even on already established sets with characters who have very little interaction with new and important characters becomes completely unfeasible in a show this expensive with already arguably the largest crew in TV history.Â 
Â 
This is why Brienne and Pod are together as soon as they leave Kings' Landing. To have Brienne on her own would have been a waste. This is also arguably why Jeyne Westerling turned into Talisa. Talisa had no family, no castle - No need for new sets or characters.
Â 
Which brings me to Stannis. He is such a solitary figure in the books, who after Blackwater and then 'Gendry (Edric)', has no real interaction with any of the other players. He's got Davos, Shireen, Melisandre and Selyse, but no contact with any of the other main characters. So realistically, how many times can we see him with those same characters doing the same thing? This isn't a criticism of his character, it's just a fact.
Â 
Sure, they can flesh out Tywin and Cersei, the Hound, Sam, (even Greyworm and Missandei because who else does Dany have other than Barristan and Jorah) because King's Landing and the Wall ARE focal sets (even though I think they've underdeveloped characters at the Wall horribly) and because Dany, like Arya ,is one of the MAIN characters through which other characters pass through and are introduced. Â Little time has been spent on the Iron Islands because no one else goes there so until it is absolutely necessary to go there, it's expendable. Likewise with Stannis, unfortunately. So, until he gets to the Wall and has something to do that involves other players, like it or not, little screentime is going to be devoted to him.Â 
Â 
Again, this is not to argue that what they have done with his charcter during the screentime they have allotted him is fair (I also feel that way about several other characters but I rarely see people complain about them as vehemently). I would have loved to hear about Proudwing already. I would have loved a lot of things. But in terms of screentime, and why they haven't fleshed out his character more yet, I totally get it. Â 
Â 
And just to weigh in on why he didn't get there in this episode -- like so many have said, this was the 1st and only episode just dedicated to the NW, and their 1 small victory, plus a breath to be taken (literally, as this was the 1st slow motion shot I think GOT has ever done) for Ygritte's death. Her death concluded a chapter in the book, it deserved a beat.
Â 
Stannis' heoric arrival does too, but the last several chapters of SoS were Tyrion, Jon as LC, Sansa, and then LS. If anyone got screwed out of not "ending" season 4 before the LS reveal, it's actually Sansa.


What about Bran and Theon? They are also very solitary figures(in relation to everybody else). Stannis had 2 scenes this season, with the finale it will be 3 scenes. Why would any show viewer care about a storyline that barely appears and is clearly sub-par when it does? Think about the mission to Caster's keep, Mel's bath, Locke's & Ramsay scene. Do you think that was the best use of allocatted time?

I am agreeing about the abundance of useless Wall crap, which includes the awful (arguably worst ever, Craster's crap), as well asÂ argue that Bran has gotten the same shaft (see Meera's almost rape). Theon, on the other hand, since his future storyline is so tied up with Roose and the North's storyline in general, has received an abundance, which just serves my points.
Â 
Mel's, as I have said, was Â also awful, but a way to keep the Stannis 'people' going with storyline...for the record, I do hate how they have made Stannis' storyline more about Mel than Stannis, but Stannis does keep disappearing for chunks at a time and she is the POV character in DwD so ....maybe they have a plan? i didn't say a good one.

2295	BlueDragon	2014-06-09	I love this show. Â I am ridiculously addicted to this show and this narrative as a whole. Â D&D constantly waste screen time with unnecessary embroidery, which might be nice if they had the time and budget, but they do not.
Â 
Every single episode this season wasted time on fluff or boobs or whatever when so many critical elements need time to be developed. Â I don't care if next week is 65 minutes, it will feel like 15 and we won't even have time to respond emotionally.
Â 
Jaime confesses to Tyrion, Tyrion climbs through the walls and kills Shae and Tywin
Jaime and Cersei have some private time. Â Why?
Tyrion escapes; Varys disappears
Arya and the Hound do something critical AND Arya gets on a boat to Bravos
Bran gets to the tree and learns his destiny (that is a movie in itself)
Jon treats with Mance and Stannis comes to the rescue. Â Sam and Gilly do something significant.
Dany discovers Drogon is eating little girls. Â Dragons are locked up except for the worst perpetrator.
Â 
I am sure there is a lot more that I have left out.
Â 
Why kill most of Jon's supporters before he becomes commander? Â Pip and Grenn were nicely developed characters. Â Now, Jon is alone at the wall except for Sam.
Â 
Adding stuff while not giving us a full hour is inexcusable. Â I am sure there is stuff on the cutting room floor that would help satisfy some of this.
Â 
Very frustrating. Â In one week, I will be in withdrawal again.

Actually, Davos is the POV character in Stannis's story in ACOK and ASOS. Melisandre only has one POV chapter and it's at the Wall after Stannis leaves to go after the Boltons in ADWD.

That is sort of my point.
2298	Khal Porno	2014-06-09	Stannis will be coming next week but it won't be as impressive. Too many other climatic/exciting scenes are happening in the finale so "Stannis Stannis STANNIS!" won't get the spotlight it deserves.


Really, did you feel that way about the book, that the scene with Stannis was overshadowed because the book also featured Tyrion killing Tywin and the Lady Stoneheart reveal?Â  Get a grip on yourselves.
2299	Zman1863	2014-06-09	There's a lot to be done in the finale. But I think they can get it done provided they allocate more time than they have to most of the episodes this season. They also need to be disciplined with relatively minor arcs. Dany and crew, Cersei, Tommen, and Marg can't be allowed to occupy undue amounts of time.
Â 
I'm also pretty apprehensive about how much of a time pit Arya, the Hound and Brienne and Pod will be. It would seem that it will require at least a few scenes to get an intersection plus Arya leaving the Hound plus getting on a ship in one episode. I'm skeptical that Arya will be seabound by the end of the episode because of this Brienne development. However, the last song on the soundtrack seems far too upbeat for any other story arc except for Arya sailing off for a new start, unless the song is not to appear in the show at all.Â
2300	Cold Feet	2014-06-09	Common guys! I'm pretty sure D&D are not going to let us down, being fans themselves. We're going to get exactly what we want and in retrospect we'll be as pleased as we now are confused. Keep in mind that D&D are fans, that's why they're doing this show, so why on earth would they be doing anything that wouldn't make sense to us (fellow) fans!?
Â 
We're going to see Stannis kick ass; Tyrion kick ass; Danerys kick (dragon)ass; Bran see ass(ess); and Brienne biting the Hounds ass...sorry ear! So lets just enjoy the upcoming show and focus on WoW that'll come out 12/14!(?)!(?)!

Unless you expect them to give Stannis a good twenty minutes of screen time, there was no point in splitting this into another episode. He'll get five minutes at most, and if we account for the Mance treaty, maybe trim some fat off of the Sam-Gilly scenes, than there was more than enough time in order to complete the entire Wall sequence and give the audience a satisfying narrative conclusion that doesn't end with a cliff hanger. I like a lot of things in the episode, but there are valid reasons to be disappointed with Stannis' charge being omitted, because it CAN'T have the same emotional impact anymore due to the gap between episodes. With all the liberties the show runners have taken, I don't understand why depriving us of our "Red Dawn of the Rohirrim" moment makes sense, when it really could have added so much to an otherwise fantastic episode. I'm not even so much worried about it being overshadowed by the Tyrion-Tywin stuff as I am annoyed that were no longer in the heat of battle, and thus its thematic power has been severely limited.

The thing is that argument for Theon also aplies to Stannis. There enough time to explore Theon mental breakdown, but the ideological debates happening in DG? I don't want to come of as some sort of Stannis fanatic, but it really jarring how his and Jon storylines have been handled, and i don't think it's a question of time so much as a question of quality writing.

2306	Metrael	2014-06-09	For those of you saying that placing a scene in the end or during the episode is the same thing, try putting the Lady Stoneheart scene during the half of next episode and see if it will have the same impact.
Both Stannis and the episode could have had a perfect and remarkeable ending, but they probably transfered the last scene to episode 10 only to decrease the glory of the moment. Episode 10 had enough cliffhangers by itself even without this episode 9.
Also, the episode could have enough time to finish this storyline, considering it was too short and they could just add some more minutes and finish it the way everyone expected.

Â 
Yeah I agree with this. The LS moment is built to be an overall ending. Stannis arriving at the wall not so much. This is especially true for the show since D&D virtually told the viewers that Stannis would be heading for the wall in Season 4.Â 
Â 
I agree with the Stannis fans that D&D don't like him very much and construct him as an important but secondary character. However, I think the majority of the readership agrees with this assessment of the character.Â
2311	TheFacelessOther	2014-06-09	I'm a tad disapointed. Now I fear the next episode will either be rushed, or things will be left out. Like maybe Stannis coming will be an early season 5 thing?

If you really go by that logic, what the fuck were Snow Winterfell & Lysa's Flight doing in the seventh episode of the season, when it clearly happened in last chapter,right before the prologue? 
Maybe they should have done that in last episode, followed by LSH reveal. Then how much emotional impact that would have created,you think?

Â 
I said we were all done with Stannis for this season. Nobody believed me. Oh no, there had been some interview in which the producers gave away the plot yasee...
Â 
I don't see why the producers would be in a rush to go through the book material any faster than they need to. Jon's stabbing isn't going to happen till 5.9 at the very earliest and might not happen till season 6.
Â 
There is more than enough Kings Landing material for episode 10 but we will might get some Ironborn and Danys action as well and the show's title clearly promises that Bran will meet the children of the forest. We are due some Brienne as well and where is Lady Stoneheart? Oh and Arya needs to leave the hound to go to Bravos.
Â 
And all that is on top of Tywin getting his comeupance which surely has to be the show closer now.

If you like Stannis you are in for a disappointment. He is obviously going to be killed off early in book 6 when Mel switches to supporting Jon. Stannis has to die before Cersei's brats because otherwise Stannis becomes the sole legitimate heir of Robert Baratheon and Dannys is restarting the war of five kings rather than helping fight the other.Â
2320	Cold Feet	2014-06-09	Honestly, at 10:01 I went through an intense fit of rage (all be it short lived) when Stannis didn't show up, and I don't even fucking like his character! But at 10:05, after my heart attack had subsided, I began to realize that if Stannis would have showed up toward the end, it would be nothing more than a damn ner direct copy of the Blackwater. Very predictable & incredibly cheesy, IMO.
But over all, I thought it was amazing...but... :[ (Grenn...Pyp)... *CRIES*
2321	Bilbo Swaggins	2014-06-09	The LC election will be next season.
I'm still not happy about moving Stannis to next week. With everything else happening, he and his cavalry charge will get a maximum of five minutes. They could have fit that and the Jon conversation with Mance in this episode if they cut out the filler stuff like Jon and Sam convo, some Sam and Gilly, and Sam and Aemon. (I don't hate Sam. He's one of my favorite characters, but most of his pre-battle scenes were unnecessary.)

Â I wouldn't expect GRRM to ever say (or email) that he totally disliked an episode; the man's no fool; this is a critically acclaimed highly rated adaption of his series, after all. Â But he doesn't have to say he liked it either. In this case, however, he reached out to Neil Marshall to say how much he loved the episode. I doubt he does that for every episode.
2323	thepooperthatwaspromised	2014-06-09	If you really go by that logic, what the fuck were Snow Winterfell & Lysa's Flight doing in the seventh episode of the season, when it clearly happened in last chapter,right before the prologue?
Maybe they should have done that in last episode, followed by LSH reveal. Then how much emotional impact that would have created,you think?


Truth be told, if it all made perfect sense to me, Craster's would never have happened, Ygritte would have died shortly after Joffrey, Episode 9 would have been Episode 6, then Episode 7 would have had Castle Black fallout etc, etc elsewhere, Episode 8 would have probably been Oberyn-centric, episode 9 would have reminded us of the remaining storylines to be tied up (because i could very wrongly but possibly rightly believe that the showrunners wanted to switch up the expectations for episode 9, i've just been getting this feeling since last season), Epsiode 9 would have covered several different storylines - including Arya and Stannis, Â and Episode 10 would have more or less stayed true to the book - Dany check-in (because she is a main character and we cannot end a season without her, so in this case, caging her dragons, Jon's fallout, Tyrion, Sansa, LS.
Â 
This is off the top of my head, in no way meant to be taken as gospel.
2324	teej6	2014-06-09	GRRM liked it before he saw it. Following the show his blog was full of...promos for his theater.  Guess we have to decide for ourselves 
Have you seen the link/read the article? GRRM said he loved the episode after watching it.

I neither love nor hate Stannis. My critiques 'try' not to have to do with that:)
2326	sati	2014-06-09	Â 
For those of you saying that placing a scene in the end or during the episode is the same thing, try putting the Lady Stoneheart scene during the half of next episode and see if it will have the same impact.
Both Stannis and the episode could have had a perfect and remarkeable ending, but they probably transfered the last scene to episode 10 only to decrease the glory of the moment. Episode 10 had enough cliffhangers by itself even without this episode 9.
Also, the episode could have enough time to finish this storyline, considering it was too short and they could just add some more minutes and finish it the way everyone expected.
Â 


Â 

This.
2327	sati	2014-06-09	Not being a shit, but is this a fair analogy? Stannis' big moment happened in the midst. LS's moment purposely happened at the very end.


Â 
Ask yourself would D&D had that 3rd battle as the end if Dany saved the Wall?
Â 
Yes.
2328	hallam	2014-06-09	I really like what D&D are doing with the series. They have to deal with GRRM's very slow writing style and know they'll have to adapt an unwritten final book.
I think they're partially taking different paths so that we won't know what plot points are a final book spoiler and what's their invention.
Also, I like what they've done with Stannis from the point of view of showing his frustration with the situations he finds himself in. And how he appeared to be The Villain in season two because Disney fantasy movies have brainwashed us to believe anyone using blood magic is evillllll - especially if its the new King's uncle. (Insert cliche Evil Uncle laugh here.) Now, thanks to the atrocities of the Boltons, the Thenns and the Red Wedding etc, that cliche is being soundly squished


Â 
I think the plotting of the series is a lot tighter than the books and an improvement in many ways. GRRM is rather indulgent but I suspect the main difference is that he can't go back an rewrite book 1 to help out a situation in book 5. The show's producers knew a lot more about where the story was headed. So instead of three random prostitutes in different places, Ros. Instead of a new character being used for the blood magic, reuse Gendry and set Arya against Berwick.
Â 
I have no sympathy for the folk who thought Stannis was going to come in and save the day and eliminate one of the main season to season cliffhangers. It was obvious that there had not been enough prep for the main battle with Mance and that Yggrite's death would be well into the episode. There was never room for Stannis. Even if they have shot the main battle scenes already they will be shown in season 5.
Â 
I disagree on the blood magic thing though. I have a nasty feeling that the God of light is going to turn out to be allied with the other or the dual of the other or something similar.Â

Ask yourself would D&D had that 3rd battle as the end if Dany saved the Wall?
Â 
Yes.


Yes. Because (oh feck, Â I often can't stand her) a MAIN character, and because she does finish some books.Â
2331	sati	2014-06-09	Yes. Because (oh feck, Â I often can't stand her) a MAIN character, and because she does finish some books.Â

Nah, she is a blonde with boobs and dragons and they looooooove her.
2332	thepooperthatwaspromised	2014-06-09	Yes. And because of that and more, she is a book finisher, whether she deserves this particular book or not.
2333	rmholt	2014-06-09	I'm a tad disapointed. Now I fear the next episode will either be rushed, or things will be left out. Like maybe Stannis coming will be an early season 5 thing? I wouldn't put it past them...hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Tyrion and Shae run off together, and tywin shakes his fist at them...but I digress, I'm setting the bar low for next week, in the hopes it'll surprise me, in a good way.

All that has to happen is Jon walks up to Mance. Some irrelevant trash talk occurs (eg they have Tormund) Things escalate. Stannis charging up with his army. Shot of Stannis gritting teeth.  Shot of Mel. Short scene. Long wait for us!
Another shortish scene: hound dies, or as good as. He doesn't, or does, deserve mercy. Arya rides off, trades in the horses, takes off to Braavos. Short scene. Long wait for us. 
Brienne might be done for the season. Do we have time for the massive battle at the inn? No. Nor the energy. Not for her trip to the cave where LS and the BWB are based. If that event is skipped we have a ways to go for Jaime to go on his road trip. So no LS. This is good because if she appears next season the build up will be appropriate, not an afterthought. 
The episode is Tyrion plus Bran. The rest is tying up short strings.

sorry, not directed at you rmholt.
2336	Caerl Targaryen	2014-06-09	That is sort of my point.
Ok, I guess I was confused about you saying that Melisandre was a POV in ASOS since she isn't. I actually agree with your larger points about how they've made Stannis's arc more about Mel than about him. And I find that rather frustrating. I'm not a huge Stannis fan myself (I respect the character, though) and even I'm seeing them not handling him very well. That's pretty much normal for a lot of characters on this show, though.
That said, I don't think it would have made sense to include him in this episode. His moment is more about sweeping in and scattering Mance's army than it is about coming in and saving the NW in the middle of a large battle. Or rather, he moves in and ends a series of attacks that would have led to a much larger assault. I don't think his importance to the NW will be lost on viewers. They've been hammering home the weaknesses of the NW for 4 seasons now and really showed how out of their depth they are in this episode. Stannis coming in and helping them will still be a big deal for the story moving forward. He changes the dynamic at the Wall. That's game changing whether he gets 5 minutes or 10 minutes.
2337	jerzy59	2014-06-09	OK, I didn't hate it - solely based on the power of my love for Jon Snow and the NW as a bookreader - but it certainly was nowhere near as good (actually fantastic) as "Blackwater."
Imo they made four huge mistakes wrt this episode.
MISTAKE #1: Pushing the raid from the south to the end of the season. It made no sense, lead to pointless filler throughout the season, and undercut the emotional power of Ygritte's death scene.
MISTAKE #2: Not using the rest of the season to develop the characters at the Wall. The only characters we really know are Jon, Sam & Alliser (and one of them is an asshole). It's kind of hard to care about a bunch of nameless/soulless extras & vaguely-drawn bit players.


Â 
This is the only good argumentation I've seen here about what's happening at the wall in this season. The massive problem here is that useful screen time is completely wasted by what's happening at Crasters. Having Ygritte's party attacking the wall instead (like in the book) would have allowed further building of character at the wall later + having a proper siege by the wildlings + having the state of desperation at the Wall leading to an heroic Stannis moment (which would have fit perfectly as a climax for ep 09). In aparte it would have left a bit of room for Bran North of the wall, maybe introducing some myths and legends about the place, maybe having Coldhands on screen.Â 
Â 
But instead D&D went for Craster's keep sub arc. Hence Ygritte's group syncing the attack with Mance's vanguard. Hence no room at all for Stannis in that episode in that particular context.Â 
Â 
Given the choices made by D&d at the Wall for this season, I truly believe - as much as I love book Stannis, that there was absolutely no room for him in that particular context they set for ep 09.Â 
Â 
Completely unrelated, I really liked the Sam & Jon discussion atop of the Wall.
2338	Caerl Targaryen	2014-06-09	Â 
President Obama gets copies of game of thrones in advance. You can be pretty sure GRRM does as well.
He's often said that he doesn't get episodes in advance and only sees them when they first air like everyone else. A recent example. He posted a blog entry a few days before this episode aired and said at the end that he hadn't seen it yet.
2339	rmholt	2014-06-09	Have you seen the link/read the article? GRRM said he loved the episode after watching it.
Missed it. Now I see the director also quoting an email saying Blackwater was a tough act to follow and he did a good job. The director says GRRM loved it, was happy.  Got it.
I seriously don't think GRRM wants to be the guy who proclaims episodes good or bad. He's let it go, it isn't his work. He responded to the rape controversy with his work only. He did not say anything about how he saw it played out. Using the public declarations of him or Elio or anyone else to decide on the legitimacy of someone else's opinion is IMHO an error.
That said I need to see it again but if I decide I liked Blackwater a lot better you all will just have to love me anyway.

2345	Caerl Targaryen	2014-06-10	That said I need to see it again but if I decide I liked Blackwater a lot better you all will just have to love me anyway. What makes "Blackwater" a better episode for me personally, even if it isn't as visually or technically impressive, is that they did a much better job setting it up. They spent time establishing the players and explaining the situation clearly while slowly building up to it over the course of the season.
Most of the material at the Wall this season has felt like one missed opportunity after another. The Craster's Keep material could have been completely cut and replaced with more direct material leading up to this bigger attack from Mance. The extra time could have also been used to show more of the struggles Bran and company were going through. Or they could have used Bran to tell more backstory.
There are a lot of ways they could have more effectively built up to this episode to give it a bigger impact. But this has been a problem all season outside of King's Landing. They could have been using the time with Dany to transition viewers into the more heavily political situation she finds herself in as well as establishing Meereen as a city. Instead we've ended up with a Missandei/Grey Worm romance and Dany deciding on a whim to sleep with Daario. Both were handled fairly well for what they are but it's time that could have been better spent on more relevant development. And that's really just one of many examples. Poor use of screen time has been a problem all season and has really diluted a lot of the stories for me.

They really do seem to have skimped heavily on characters on the Wall so caring about how Jon becomes LC is hard. OTOH Jon going rogue, taking over command de facto, and marching off to treat with Mance on his own is helped by not having to work with those other two castles and other men of command material. I presume he'll be LC of something so they'll need crow characters. Problem for next season.
Which is totally weird since it's the Wall and the Watchers, whom we see so little of, who start the story and who ought to end it, saving the world, and so forth. The action south of the wall and in Essos is all aiming at that purpose. No respect.

Ah the kid BBQ. Yeah that would work.That's the most likely thing they'll be ending Dany's arc with this season. It even fits with the episode title, "The Children."
Many of the plots they have left to deal with have to do with children in various ways. There are the children of the forest, Dany's children (the dragons), the dragons killing a child, Tyrion exacting revenge against his father and being helped by his brother to escape, there's Lady Stoneheart's revenge against those who butchered her last (known) living son, and of course there are the stories involving the remaining Stark children. We could probably break down the remaining subplots and look at them from the same perspective (some would probably be more forced...).
The title seemed rather lame when I first read it but it's actually a pretty smart title now that I've thought about it a little more. It doesn't really give anything away yet it's quite telling if you know anything about the books.

I agree with your issues. The tech superhuman efforts have at times exceeded character and plot.
There's nothing in Wall that chilled me like several moments in Blackwater. They scaled the tech way down but that single ship leaking green said enough.  I said "Cool!" a few times (Giants! who do archery! WTH is the Scythe?! OhWow!!) but only the Grenn-gate-oath scene hit me inside.
When Davos son hollers DRUMS! I just flip - that whole assault looked like the director took lessons from D-Day/Saving Private Ryan right up to anticipatory puking. Jon and Ygritte had an entire love affair with virtually no facial expressions or visible passion and that's how the fight at the Wall looked - on that side. Maybe that was on purpose bc the wildlings looked INTENSE. If it was on purpose I don't think it's working.
2349	Raksha 2014	2014-06-10	I think that much of the frustration that book readers feel with some of the choices that the show's writers and directors have made stems from the book readers' knowing that certain characters are very important to the story; and seeing them getting less screen time than they might need to accomplish the purposes they fulfilled in the book (not to mention seeing them characterized as they were in the books). Â 
Â 
Stannis plays an important role in the survival of the Night's Watch and destiny of the Wildlings and the North, at least for now, and during the time of the story we are seeing dramatized. Â He's a good leader and soldier. Â But in the show, Stannis is an unlikeable grump who burns trusted allies because they're "infidels" and does not, at least has not yet, come to the defense of the Night's Watch in a blaze of Rhlorry-glory. Â Yet we get invented scenes such as the Maester Aemon/Sam discussion about love. Â I wonder if Sam gets a lot more screen time than Stannis because TV-fans like Sam more than they like Stannis? Â (not saying they do, but it's a possibility) Â Also, it could be that the show is contractually obligated to give Peter Vaughan, the 91-year-old actor who plays Aemon, a certain amount of screen time per season. Or, they could have wanted to have this episode be all about the men of the Night's Watch themselves (plus Gilly) and the way they face hopeless odds, without a last-minute reprieve from Stannis the Mannis.
Â 
I confess that I cannot figure out the presentation of the character of Mance Rayder in the TV show. Â He was a hardened rogue in the book; but also possessed charm and charisma and genuinely seemed to like, or at least value Jon Snow. Â TV-Mance has just glowered and frowned and seemed to disapprove of Jon like every other Wildling except Ygritte. Â I wonder if Ciaran Hinds was bored or unhappy freezing up in Iceland; because he certainly looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Â 
Â 
And don't get me started on TV-Brienne's viciousness and now her surly disapproval of Pod. Â Perhaps the directors wanted her to be more edgy than the character in the book. Â Or Littlefinger, who is definitely less smart than his book counterpart. Â 
Â 
It would probably be easier for me, and other book readers, to have not read the books at all, so we could just enjoy the TV series as good entertainment. Â If only they could make each episode 10 minutes longer; it would improve things a bit, I think.
Â 
Meanwhile, I think that next week's finale will be very busy. Â If we're lucky, we'll see:
Â 
Brienne fightin' and bitin'.
Arya abandoning the dying Hound and Valar Morghulis-ing off to Braavos.
Bran meets a tree, the Children of the Forest, maybe Bloodraven.
Dany's dragon babies are growing up too fast; she has to lock them up.
Tyrion and Jaime's significant Tysha discussion during Tyrion's escape; Tyrion taking that fateful detour to the Chamber of the Hand and killing Tywin and Shae.
Jon vs. Wildling Host, hello, Mance. Â Then Stannis! Â Stannis! Â Stannis!
Lady Stoneheart.
Â 
There's no time for Cersei, Sansa, Littlefinger, Sam/Gilly, Margaery, Tommen, etc. Â Not even time for all that should be in the episode. Â I could see them pushing Lady Stoneheart to the end of the first episode of Season 5.
Â 
However, I might well be totally wrong...

There is no reason IMHO not to have developed the Tormund-Jon relationship. Plus whoever dresses him makes him a cartoon. He's a great character! So is Mance who is also underdeveloped but less so.

I feel like Mance got the short end of the stick in both character and screen time. ASOS being split in half didn't help. IIRC we don't see him at all Â after Jon leaves to climb The Wall, until he shows up Â to cross it, Â but that works better in the book than it does in the show. Since in the book you're not going a year plus without seeing him. Could have beinifted from a scene here and there. I don't mind made up stuff like Missandei and Grey Worm but i'd trade that for more Mance any time.
2352	Kyoshi	2014-06-10	Sometimes I wonder why some of the people on this forum still watch the show. The comments posted while the show was airing will lead you to believe everyone is having a good time and loving the episode. But then it ends and people don't see the ONE thing they wanted to be there and suddenly it was all bad.
Â 
Speaking as someone who started by watching the show and then reading the books, I have to say that I was generally more impressed with the show before I started reading the books. But that's because I came to the show with no expectations except thrilling entertainment. And that's what I got. This is the same reason the Unsullied are not complaining about the episode (from what I've seen anyway). The thing is that it was a BRILLIANT episode, like the rest of the episodes this season.
Â 
Assuming that the biggest disappointment was Stannis the Missing, I get the feeling that if Stannis had made it to the wall people might have then started complaining about the manner of his arrival, or how he just didn't seem heroic enough, or how D&D deviated from the book, or how the lighting didn't hit his hair at just the right angle...
Â 
In their disappointment people fail to realise that this is a show. Unlike GRRM's books, it has several limitations imposed on it. A lot of the things we read cannot be translated on to the screen. GRRM works with imagination and imagination alone. D&D work in the real world. I do admit that if the episodes were 10 minutes longer maybe that problem would not be so extensive. However, that would still strain the budget and D&D would still manage to piss off some people.
Â 
The thing to do when watching this show is to cast away all book expectations. I loved the episode, book knowledge or not, it was brilliantly done. Even better than Blackwater in my opinion.
2353	tmug	2014-06-10	Rewatched this episode.Â

just sayin.
2354	Yuki_no_JonI	2014-06-10	something that really bothered me (and made the episode much worse...) -although the only part I did love was the God of War style of chain getting out of the Wall....- is the end. Where Jon decides to go kill Mance!!!!
Hello....! That's out of character for Jon! He respects Mance, he is not an assassin and he believes in the common enemy... and that's according to his actions at ADWD.... I really can't see HOW he is willing to kill Mance but later made ammends with the Free Folk... and Tormund.. the hell Tormund.... Tormund was the closest thing to KBtW after Mance.... not a prisoner!
2355	C0bR	2014-06-10	Laughable episode. Some cool moments like giant bow, Thorne and Chekov's kiddo, but overall very underwhelming. Bad CGI and non-sensical, Rambo style action (how many crows did Tormund and Ygritte kill between themselves? 50?) with lame choreography (the Thorne/Tormund fight was a complete embarassment). Most of the action cornerstones were either stupid or pointless (like, why would they drop that scythe on 6 people? Why would they use a mammoth to tear out the gate when they could've just lifted it and propped it with something? Why would Jon jump from 12 feet when he just got stabbed in the thigh a week earlier just to have a cool moment? Why did the wildling attack on the Wall consist of about 30 people at max?

Â 
Seeing a Giant run after his Mammoth, chain dragging behind,
no matter how fast he runs, the chain is out of reach.
Priceless.
Â 
How many of us have been THERE!..
2357	Secu86	2014-06-10	Please someone do fill me in: the bald one who fights with Jon isn't Rattlesnake? I do remember a few episodes back when he met up with Ygritte&co., he presented himslef with this name.Â

Â 
I'm not sure if he is the one you menat, but one bald that was shown in the episode was non other that Varamyr Sixskins....
2359	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Â 
I'm not sure if he is the one you menat, but one bald that was shown in the episode was non other that Varamyr Sixskins....

Nah he's not, just a Thenn Warg. Varamyr is being casted for season 5
2360	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Please someone do fill me in: the bald one who fights with Jon isn't Rattlesnake? I do remember a few episodes back when he met up with Ygritte&co., he presented himslef with this name.Â 

It's Styr
2361	Yuki_no_JonI	2014-06-10	Nah he's not, just a Thenn Warg. Varamyr is being casted for season 5


Â 
Really??? I'd love to see him! I just reread his POV and then I realised Summer made his wolves his pack...in Bran I ADWD...
but when I saw the warg in the latest episode I though he would be Varamyr .... due to the fact that he was warging an eagle too...
2362	Thormund Giantsbabe	2014-06-10	Don't you guys think it kind of sucked how Jonas Flynt(??) and Allister Thorne were there? In the books, I thought that the fact that Jon had the wall really meant a lot, but here he's just listening to these two idiots...
2363	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Not really, no
2364	NigNag	2014-06-10	it's brilliant howÂ we Stannis fans get reality a little twisted for our Great King and Hero.. i mean in our minds his arrival happened thus:
Â 
Mance and his Wildlings had ALL the crows on the North side of the Wall, bound and gagged and on their knees (all lined up). Mance raised his arm and the Wildlings standing over the men of the Nights Watch raised their Axes above their heads. Tormund raised the Horn to his lips and Jon realized that with one Toot the Wall would come crashing down.Â 5 Million Wildlings and 7 million White walkers were seconds away from crossing over and wiping out Westeros and the Realm of men. Just when Mance is about to drop his arm and give the Signal... STANNIS, STANNIS, STANNIS...
Â 
That's why we were so pissed he didnt turn up!!
Â 
The reality that Jon and Mance were chatting in the tent about this 'n' that and then STANNIS STANNIS STANNIS... doesn't really compute.
Â 
I really am a Stannis lover and want to be his squire and STANNIS STANNIS STANNIS was one of my 'feel good moments' but D&D have the right of it. I loved the episode and it was very well done! Bravo to all involved
2365	Cold Feet	2014-06-10	Laughable episode. Some cool moments like giant bow, Thorne and Chekov's kiddo, but overall very underwhelming. Bad CGI and non-sensical, Rambo style action (how many crows did Tormund and Ygritte kill between themselves? 50?) with lame choreography (the Thorne/Tormund fight was a complete embarassment). Most of the action cornerstones were either stupid or pointless (like, why would they drop that scythe on 6 people? Why would they use a mammoth to tear out the gate when they could've just lifted it and propped it with something? Why would Jon jump from 12 feet when he just got stabbed in the thigh a week earlier just to have a cool moment? Why did the wildling attack on the Wall consist of about 30 people at max? And so on and on and on).
Â 
How did those two idiots even get their ends on the books? The censorship department of the Chinese goverment would make a better job of adapting it than those two butchers. Whenever they put their hands on something and try to change it, it becomes a pure, stinking shit. Not to mention them killing Grenn and Pyp for no reason.
Â 
Inb4 Stannis genocides the wildlings next week, just after Mance and Jon reach a peaceful agreement of them crossing the Wall (this will take 2 minutes of screentime before it cuts to some glorious Daenerys/Tyrion stuff).Wow, you whine like a bloody woman. Nit picking each and every fucking detail because it's not cool enough or it doesn't follow our laws of physics, wasn't real enough, and what have you
Please someone do fill me in: the bald one who fights with Jon isn't Rattlesnake? I do remember a few episodes back when he met up with Ygritte&co., he presented himslef with this name.That was Styr, 'Magnar of Thenn'. The dude that said "I am going to eat your dead mama, and I am going to eat your dead momma, go tell the crows at Castle Black.." and the guy that Ygritte threatens at the beginning of the episode
Don't you guys think it kind of sucked how Jonas Flynt(??) and Allister Thorne were there? In the books, I thought that the fact that Jon had the wall really meant a lot, but here he's just listening to these two idiots...... yeah...and? Alliser Thorne is still Lord Commander,  still giving orders, & Jon still has to obey them. When Thorne puts Slynt in control, that means Jon has to obey his orders. Luckily Grenn thought of a way to get Slynts bitch ass to fuck off, thus, making Jon now in control.
Don't get me wrong, there were a few time in the Thorne/Tormund & Jon/Styr fights that the brothers had wide open shots (quick! But shots none the less) when the T & S had just swung with the weapon still over their shoulders, an easy gut thrust would have finished it for them. BUT this is only acting for a TV show, so as long as 80% is like real life, I'm totally fine with it.

2366	ladybuc	2014-06-10	For a moment I was afraid they would let the Magnar of Thenn kill Slynt and not show the death he actually gets! That is one of the scenes I am dying to see! I hope they don't make any changes to it!


Â 
Duh, must have been sleeping. Of course it wasn't the Magnar. Tormund...
Feeling ignorant...
2367	Tattered_Prince	2014-06-10	So, it seems that Tormund will be the one to die instead of Rattleshirt...hope I'm wrong
2368	Chebyshov	2014-06-10	So, it seems that Tormund will be the one to die instead of Rattleshirt...hope I'm wrong


Â 
Who's going to become the titular leader of the Wildlings before Jon lets them through the Wall then?
2369	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-10	So, it seems that Tormund will be the one to die instead of Rattleshirt...hope I'm wrong


Â 
They're probably going to skip that whole thing and just negotiate with Tormund rather than have Val go and fetch him (I'm guessing Val is cut). They might just altogether skip the glamour thing since it's kind of silly anyways, and on screen it would look really foolish if Mance just turns up after being burned and says "Oh yeh that wasn't me that burned lolz was a trick. Gotcha!"
2370	sj4iy	2014-06-10	Not being a shit, but is this a fair analogy? Stannis' big moment happened in the midst. LS's moment purposely happened at the very end.

Honestly, I can't think if any moment more shocking than Cat's return...even Tywin's death.
2371	sj4iy	2014-06-10	I'm a tad disapointed. Now I fear the next episode will either be rushed, or things will be left out. Like maybe Stannis coming will be an early season 5 thing? I wouldn't put it past them...hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Tyrion and Shae run off together, and tywin shakes his fist at them...but I digress, I'm setting the bar low for next week, in the hopes it'll surprise me, in a good way.

His coming is in the trailers for Season 4 and in the trailer for episode 10.  They aren't leaving it out and never were.
2372	sj4iy	2014-06-10	I neither love nor hate Stannis. My critiques 'try' not to have to do with that:)

I'm the same way.  I don't think he's a hero, but I don't think he's a villain, either.  I try to just see him as he's portrayed and nothing else.
2373	sj4iy	2014-06-10	Â 
Ask yourself would D&D had that 3rd battle as the end if Dany saved the Wall?
Â 
Yes.

Are you serious?  The entire point of ending it like they did had nothing to do with Stannis...they ended it that way to make Jon's mission seem absolutely hopeless and to make it look like the NW will fall soon.  Showing ANYONE come in and save them would completely undermine that, and they didn't want to do that.  It has absolutely nothing to with Stannis.
2374	Pallantides	2014-06-10	I wasn't sure where to post this, so I figured I'd share it here. I wrote a ballad for Grenn and the five men he took with him to hold the gate. The fact that he got a very heroic death unlike the majority of characters in the show is what spurred me to write this (and I liked his actor and I'm sad to see him go).
The watchers stood upon the wall,
Stewards and rangers are we;
On that day the wildings came,
They thought they'd be set free.
It could be said they had the strength.
To march upon us in such force.
They lit the biggest fire the North had ever seen;
They'd kill without remorse.
They advanced without relent,
Marching through arrows and more.
The outer gate was being breached,
When Grenn stepped to the fore.
I had to send him down to the tunnels.
I told him to hold the gate.
He took five men; Hyll, Cooper and three more
Hopefully it would not be too late.
The giant was getting through,
It charged like a raging boar.
He roared aloud with thunder,
We stand fast or we'll be no more.
He gleamed like a star
And the sound of his sword was like a raging storm
Proudly the ranger challenges the doom.
Vowing to slay this unkown life form.
They were the sword in the darkness and the watcher on the walls,
the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn.
The horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.
These six brave men passed on.
He held the gate.
2375	teej6	2014-06-10	Missed it. Now I see the director also quoting an email saying Blackwater was a tough act to follow and he did a good job. The director says GRRM loved it, was happy.  Got it.
I seriously don't think GRRM wants to be the guy who proclaims episodes good or bad. He's let it go, it isn't his work. He responded to the rape controversy with his work only. He did not say anything about how he saw it played out. Using the public declarations of him or Elio or anyone else to decide on the legitimacy of someone else's opinion is IMHO an error.
That said I need to see it again but if I decide I liked Blackwater a lot better you all will just have to love me anyway. 

I posted the link in response to an earlier poster who called everyone who liked this episode as being tasteless. I don't make my judgement based on Elio's or GRRM's opinion and neither should anyone else.
2376	Sunglass	2014-06-10	Are you serious? The entire point of ending it like they did had nothing to do with Stannis...they ended it that way to make Jon's mission seem absolutely hopeless and to make it look like the NW will fall soon.Â

I adored the entire episode on the first viewing up until it became clear that Stannis would not be making an appearance, thus cramming up the finale and also slightly diminishing the impact of his arrival altogether. Although that might turn out to not be the case.Â 
However on the second viewing, this is a truly fantastic episode. I can wax lyrical about the direction, the choreography, the editing and all the incredible effects to no end. i also remember being constantly in suspense from the first time we saw Joe Gatt's owl. Although that might have been down to some lingering PTSD from last week.
But it was the character moments that really stuck out for me. Sam guiding Pyp and Olly through the battle and death in the case of the former, whilst Janos Slynt cowered in that room where Sam downright refused to stay. Love is the death of duty.Â 
I can't say enough about Grenn. You constantly see interviews with cast members being asked how they would like to die on the show. "The way Grenn died" is probably the correct answer now. A heroic, blaze of glory death for the greater good is not something we've seen a lot of on this show.Â 
Then there's Jon and Ygritte. A little cheesy perhaps. But the infrequency of this sort of thing on this show make it feel somehow more real and incredibly emotional. I've always been a huge fan of Rose but this has been Kit's season in terms of acting and he absolutely nailed it again here and throughout the remainder of the episode.Â 
Even feckin Tormund! You can hear the self-loathing and blame in his voice when he calls out at Jon.Â Amidst all of it though, the character that I've grown to like the most is Ser Alliser. We talk about how Jorah, Tywin, Bronn etc are all improvements on their book counterparts. With Ser Alliser, the TV version is so far ahead it's unreal. Without going into too much detail, he encapsulates this 'grey' aspect as much as any character on the show or book. My own favourite character, Theon, included. So much props to Owen Teale.Â 
Anyway I still just wish we had Stannis arriving to round it off and probably confirm it in my own mind as the best episode in the show's history. I hope they have something special up their sleeve for next week.Â 


Â 
To the bolded, ITA, he's an amazing Alester (spelling? too tired to care) and I cannot say how much I resent the fact that this terrific actor actually made me pause and rewind on my first watch....just so I could be sure it was NW men dragging him off, LOLÂ  I can't believe IÂ cared enough to do that.Â  I do wonder if his injury means that Thorne may take some of the future Bowen Marsh duty.Â  That wouldÂ totally fuck up The Ides of Marsh, LOLÂ  Â 
Â 
Grenn and the actor both are amazing and that makes me pissed that he had to take the Donal Noye death.Â  Loosing both Pyp and Grenn when they still live in the books shows that the show has not developed enough of the minor characters up at The Wall.Â  I'm still going to miss Jon and Tormund drinking to Ygritte and to Mag the Mighty and The One Armed Smith.Â

2378	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-10	p.s. having said all of that, if Stannis doesn't get proper screentime next season, then i might start agreeing with D&D hate Stannis crew.


Â 
THIS!!Â  I did hold out hope that it would be a better season for Stannis this year, not realizing how they'd delay lots of the Wall happenings.Â  If it doesn't start getting rectified next episode and next season, I'm gonna have to go with......there's something to the hate theory.
Â 
Honeslty, part of me does think if Stannis wasn't still moving serious plot and armies in TWOW chapters, he might have already been killed off in the show. Eh, the cast is going to be mighty depopulated soon, and has been this year, maybe Stannis will get his chance, I hope so.Â  I'm dying for the double straight man comedy team of Stannis and Jon.Â  That is priceless.Â
2379	Yuki_no_JonI	2014-06-10	I wanted to quote a previous post but really can't find it... the post was about
I hope they don't mess with the actual way Slynt dies. I'm really looking forward to that
or something similar. Unfortunately, as much as I really want to watch this (and even enjoy it) I honestly believe that we are not going to have such a moment. For the time being, in the tv show every "good" or even just "debating" point Jon has (or every other character in the Wall) just has to be changed....
they're really f&()_*ing this arc (as well as Bran's)... and I don't think it's due to lack of screentime or cast....
so they will probably don't go along the beheading too :S

What are you talking about? Jon just shot Tormund in the leg and kicked him in the gut, a man who he was supposed to be aligned with once. Jon is much more outwardly outspoken against his superiors in the show. If anything it will be less surprising on the show than it was in the book. Slynt is also way more of a bitch on the show, and they would never shy from a beheading. If you're going to complain at least try to root it in some reality or logic.Â

Having him captured and defeated could work. All the free folk want is to get behind the wall and to safety, and while "killing" Mance does work better, it also creates more tension between the free folk and Stannis/NW. It's just way too campy to show them burning Mance on screen and then suddenly have him show up in a scene with Melissandre and say "Haha, you fooled you!" This isn't Scooby Doo.Â

LOL I do kinda agree with this.Â  There's a bit too much glamouring and resurrection all over the place as the books continue.Â  Granted, on one hand it's provided some interesting dilemmas, but on the other hand.........it's getting cheesy.Â  Also, it contributes to way too much crackpottery as we wait for the books.Â
2383	sj4iy	2014-06-10	the preview shows that Jon Snow and the Wall will Â be saved ...Â  Â 

The preview isn't the episode.  And we only know what we are seeing because we know the story.  My family who hasn't read it?  They all think Jon Snow is going to die or something very bad is going to happen to him and the Wall.  They don't know what's coming, and you have to look at the show from the POV of not having read the books to get it.
2384	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-06-10	If Grenn and Pyp are now dead in the TV series, we can expect they will soon die in the next book

2386	Lord of Winterhell	2014-06-10	I feel geniunely sorry for everybody who rated these ep below 8, or who was somehow strongly dissapointed.
Â 
Every week I look forward next ep and every week I get top quality show which I can enjoy (with some small or bigger nitpicks here or there), and sometimes I get something extraordinary like this week. And apparently many of you watch the show week after week just to get more frustrated and angry because some line you love from the books was omitted or changed, some character was "butchered", episode was "anticlimactic", or there was "tons of filler" etc. I am not trying to mock you, I am just saying that no matter who is "right", I (and many others apparently) clearly get the better of it.
Â 
I know it won't help you, but here's the thing:
Â 
Season finale will not be as you hope/dream/wish. They will change a lot. I am pretty sure that something big you all expect will not happen at all, something will be changed. There will be scenes you don't expect at all.
Â 
So do yourself a favor. Stop counting that Stannis needs 15 minutes, Dany 5 minutes, Tyrion 15 minutes and so on. By doing this you are ALREADY frustrated because no, ep 410 won't last 75 minutes, it will last 66 minutes. You will not get it all. Accept it before the show airs, and you will not be dissapointed and nervous when they suddenly insert 3 minute scene which "shouldn't" be there. Your expectation is what ruins the show for you, not showrunners work.

Actually I hated Tormund being captured. and someone mentioned in a previous post that maybe Tormund will play Rattleshirt's part....
I won't disagree that I complain a lot about the way the show is at North, but hell.... I HATE how they changed the story. I can't see Jon willing to kill Mance by his own accord, I could not stand him being manipulated by Ygritte and the wildings....
it's not that the events didn't turn quite similar... is the way of getting to the end that bothers me
Â 
Honestly, I think his arc is better on the show than in the book because he's more believable as a leader, and it's more believable that he will get elected LC.
Â 
I won't disagree that it seems more leader-like BUT, it is on ADWD where he "kills the boy".... and it is Sam who elects him into LC.... it is not like it was his decision... with the trope things turn on show we might even see him placing his own name

"The horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men."
It flows a tad better if it ends on "...guards the realms" IMO, 'of mens' breaks up the flow a bit, as well as the very last line, I think it sounds good but make it'and the gate was held. But its awesome either way!

So what you're saying is that viewers should lower their expectations to cautious levels?

Bravo!! 
If loving the show is wrong, I don't want to be right
2391	Pallantides	2014-06-10	Very nice my good ser!! I take it you are a musician as well? It was brilliant, & the only thing I'd change would be on the last part...
"The horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men."
It flows a tad better if it ends on "...guards the realms" IMO, 'of mens' breaks up the flow a bit, as well as the very last line, I think it sounds good but make it'and the gate was held. But its awesome either way!


Thanks for the compliment and critique. I'm not really a musician (I do play guitar and drums occasionally), but this was the first time I've ever really written anything like that (I used to write Haikus, but that's not been for a long time or even in the same vein).
I agree with you in regards to the flow. I think it feels better with your suggestion. Though the "He held the gate" part was an homage to Jon's line. Reading it again, I think I could probably arrange the last line as this:
They were the sword in the darkness and the watcher on the walls,
the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn.
The horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of.
And forever will we remember how these six brave men passed on.
And just end it there.

I agree and I love Stannis. This episode simply kicked ass and was exciting from end to end...well I suppose the sexually frustrated Sam who really could use some of those naughty paintings Loras said Renly had and some time to himself was sort of, meh.Â
2394	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	Really, did you feel that way about the book, that the scene with Stannis was overshadowed because the book also featured Tyrion killing Tywin and the Lady Stoneheart reveal?Â  Get a grip on yourselves.

This this this this this this this this this this
2395	Arry Lannister	2014-06-10	The lack of Stannis really disturbed me........ that ending was the LAMEST ending to an episode EVER!Â 
Â 
"Open the gatezzzz!!!!!1111" *Fade to white* What the fuck was that?Â  
David and Dan hate Stannis so much they would rather give more scenes to Sam (which weren't in the books) to show their writing skills since they are soooooooooo "on par" with George's writing. The Aemon and Sam scene was so pathetically obvious that it was just there to take some minutes off the episode. My reaction was, "Well atleast we get to learn more about Aemon" but then NOPE. "I'd rather not talk about it bro, we're gonna die anyway".Â  
We learned nothing from that scene, we all know Aemon was supposed to be king and Sam wants that Gilly V.
Â 
Though I can't deny that the cinematics and combat throughout the episode was totally epic. Ser Alliser was a fooking bad-ass and Grenn *sheds tear* died a fooking hero. (you don't see that much in GoTÂ   )

2396	Talking Hodor	2014-06-10	Are you serious? The entire point of ending it like they did had nothing to do with Stannis...they ended it that way to make Jon's mission seem absolutely hopeless and to make it look like the NW will fall soon. Showing ANYONE come in and save them would completely undermine that, and they didn't want to do that. It has absolutely nothing to with Stannis.


Amen.Â  In the books, the NW had been defending the wall for days before Stannis finally arrived.Â  Granted, once the back-door pirates had been taken care of, defending the wall wasn't that bad, they were nonetheless exhausted and had done 90% of the work, only to have their victory taken away by the Late Lord Stannis.
Â 
Stannis will have his day next week; then we can have an entire season of him trying to get the NW to put him on the Iron Throne and fighting a bogged down land war in Asia The North.

Â 
There seem to be a lot of assumptions about book readers in that one sentence.Â  First off, complaints don't necessarily mean one finds something 'ruined.'Â  Not all of us anyway.Â  Maybe I'm just complex, but I can enjoy the show for it's own sake, realize I have too many expectations and try to temper them (sometimes successfully and sometimes not), compare it both pro and con to the books, appreciate something great or just fun regardless of who did the actual original writing in book or for screen, and still...........manage to notice when the show runners totally........FOOK IT UP!!!!!
Â 
Many complain about the blanket statements of book walkers and how they seem to perceive show only watchers, but honeslty....the hyberbole goes both ways.Â  I suspect many of us are somewhere inbetween.Â  I enjoyed lots about the episode, but I also see the pile up of bad decisions made over the seasons that hurt this visit to the Wall and only the Wall.Â
2398	sam90	2014-06-10	Don't you guys think it kind of sucked how Jonas Flynt(??) and Allister Thorne were there? In the books, I thought that the fact that Jon had the wall really meant a lot, but here he's just listening to these two idiots...


Â 
I was taken aback by how Ser Allister Throne and Janos Flynt were depicted in this episode. The two couldn't be more contrasted. In the books Ser Allister is always such a mean jerk, but then on this episode of the show he was a real leader, a true knight, the kind which you would follow straight into battle. On the other hand, I pictured Janos Slynt as a boaster in the books but thought him still a capable man, well as it stands in ep. E09 he couldn't be more of a craven. Even the 10 years old boy found more courage than him. Such a shame really.
Â 
They become fast-friend in the books and allies against Jon Snow, but I am no longer convinced it will be the case in the show now..

Â 
I rated it below 8, and you missed me badly. Â I have absolutely loved this entire season. Â This was the first episode that disappointed me. Â 
Â 
When I first heard the episode was going to be entirely Wall, my expectations were not very high, because the Wall has been the weakest part of the show with the weakest characterization. Â Unfortunately, in the last 2-3 days before it aired, I got swept away by the episode 9 hype and started having high expectations. Â That was my mistake. Â If that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have been disappointed.
Â 
I gave it a 7 because, while the action was generally strong except for Mance's numbers being so underwhelming, it had less good dialogue and character interaction than any other episode this season. Â Not that there was none by any means - e.g., the night's watch chant with the giant charging was very powerful, it was very cool to say Ser Alliser's character get some depth and step up in the clutch instead of staying a douchebag stereotype, and I liked the Sam-Gilly interactions and was overjoyed to see him lay a big fat smacker on her - but all that stuff gets out numbered by the good moments in every other episode. Â 
Â 
And while the episode laid good groundwork for the future in making Jon look like an action hero with leadership qualities, I think it missed fire on laying groundwork in a couple of ways: (1) it did a poor job of tying the defense of the Wall into the safety of the rest of the realm, and (2) I don't quite understand why they put so much emphasis on Sam. Â Yeah, Sam's a popular character, I like him a lot, but by having him actually get the most screen time in by far the biggest Wall episode, they're flirting with making him a bigger character than Jon Snow. Â That puzzles me.
Â 
I thought it was quite good TV, but this season has mostly been great TV from my perspective, and I think Sunday night wasn't that.

Â 
They become fast-friend in the books, but I am no longer convinced it will be the case in the show now..


Â 
Lord Janos was a coward, his meltdown in ADWD leaves preciously little room for doubt (he had a similar one earlier when Tyrion went from "I'm a friendly imp" mode to "OK, and now off to the Wall with you"). He was essentially a courtier, not a warrior.
Â 
Ser Alliser? Well, he was an asshole and a lousy dance master, but I don't remember any hints of him being cravenly.Â 
Â 
Their perceived friendship does look a little like a "we hate Jon Snow" club.
2401	Iron Maiden Islands	2014-06-10	Has anyone thought... just for a second... that TV Stannis is kind of a dick, so that when he shows up at the Wall to save the realm from the wildlings, and then rallies the Northmen to his cause and heads to take Winterfell back from the Boltons, viewers will be surprised and start to root for him?Â 
Â 
I know when I read the books, I didn't care for Stannis at all until he showed up at the Wall, as a true King should do when the realm is under attack. Then, when he marched south to take back Winterfell, I was all in.
Â 
The idea Stannis not being played up as a superhero so far on the show means he's going to just get killed early on in TWOW is laughable IMO, as is the notion that the show is butchering his character (when most of the things he does that make people like him haven't even happened in the story yet).

Â 
Agreed. Â It was hard to like for or root for Stannis until he came to the rescue of the Wall. Â I liked him the most when he gave the credit for it to Davos by saying that he wouldn't have come if Davos hadn't set him straight on the matter. Â "I was trying to win the throne to save the realm when I needed to save the realm to win the throne". Â Would love if they kept some version of that in when Stannis and Jon talk...oh man, I can't wait to see those talks next year, that will be so awesome. Â Until this episode, it would have been hard to imagine show Jon Snow being able to banter with Stannis on equal ground...but now? Â Hell yeah, Jon is now in his element and won't take shit from anyone XD Â Also can't wait for Jon's interaction with Melisandre. Â Don't guess we'll get Davos at the Wall for very long, though.

2403	Hodor's Dragon	2014-06-10	My take was similar, and in fact I think that's kind of what GRRM is setting you up to do. Â Stannis is described multiple times from the beginning as being unlikeable, uncharismatic, etc., but duty-bound.
Â 
Well, having somebody described as "duty-bound" isn't all that stirring, but then when you actuallyÂ see him step up in a difficult situation to do his duty, that's a horse of a different kettle. Â I think everybody's respect for Stannis kind of starts, or is supposed to start, when he shows up at the Wall.
Â 
It's a real turning point for Stannis in the story. Â And it's just possible that, to the extent Stannis has been short-changed in the show (e.g., begging for a piece of that fine Red stuff), it was all for the purpose of setting him up for a more dramatic redemption - this Sunday.
2404	UKS	2014-06-10	Saw episode just now. Brilliant! Moved to tears with Grenn, Pyp and Ygritte's death - And just realised I've been humming that bit of music since it must have appeared in season 3.. never knew where it was from till now!
Â 
No need for Stannis till next week. It would have completely stole Jon Snows thunder, and also cut his suicide mission.
Â 
Can't wait for next week. Loved the episode and noted how well directed it was. The action flowed naturally and "realistically".
Â 
UKS
Â 
P.S. I still don't get the Stannis fans. All the info we have on him really is through the POV of a lovely guy who thinks the sun shines out of his behind. Unreliable narrator perhaps? IÂ
2405	Wunhopkuendo	2014-06-10	Anecdotal for sure, but my non-reader wife kept saying "When is Stannis coming to the rescue?" during the whole battle. I asked her why she thought he was coming to bail out Jon and she mentioned the whole iron bank money and mercenary stuff from past episodes, so yeah people are getting it. Now that the battle is over and Jon is going to try to parlay with or killÂ  Mance she thinks Stannis won't come. I can't wait until next week when he does rescue the wall and she'll probably say something like "I knew he would come to the rescue!" Haha
2406	Skeksi	2014-06-10	I will disagree with you in regards to Stannis' arrival, though. In fact, I had to skip over 50 or so pages due to the same lame complaint of no Stannis. The Stannis fans want it all. They want him to be portrayed as he is in the books, yet fail to see any of his faults. They want the store to be like the books, yet complaint when he doesn't come to the rescue before he did in the books. As neither a Stannis fan, nor a Stannis hater, I want to see him get his due, which in my opinion the wall scene was perhaps his only shining moment in the series. To throw in a quick five minute rush job of him coming to the rescue would not have the effect that I hope the finale will have of him really saving the wall and shining a bright light on him. We'll see, but I think it will turn out better this way.


Â 
Just to address this, I don't think that Stannis should have turned up before Jon goes to kill Mance. I just think that all of the "battle" should have been in this episode- Jon going to Mance, their scene, and Stannis's arrival. They already changed the order around by bringing Ygritte and Tormund in for the "main battle", and having Ygritte die there, rather than in a smaller skirmish earlier on in the season, so it's not like the show (or I, come to that) has any issue with changing stuff around to keep the pace moving/ pack storylines into a season, if that's what is needed.
Â 
I think that in an episode where we have an awful lot of footage of people battling (brilliantly shot, great special effects, don't get me wrong), there would have been more than enough time to have Jon's scene with Mance, and Stannis's arrival at the end of the episode, had a few other scenes been cut shorter. It wouldn't NEED to be more than a 5 minute job, because all it has to end with are the wildlings beginning to attack the Wall, a larger force surrounding them/ fighting them, and men chanting "Stannis"- cut to quick shot of Stannis. I mean, at the end of Blackwater it didn't take more than 5 minutes to show Tywin and the Tyrells arriving, and Tywin to declare the battle won, leaving the next episode free to deal with the fallout.
Â 
As it is, this is now another scene that they have to add to the final episode, which is starting to look crowded. Unless they leave Jon's election as LC to next season, that's at least 2 big scenes on the Wall to fit in, including more battle. There's Tyrion's escape, and the murders in KL, and given that Tyrion is an audience favourite and Tywin's role is even larger in the books, I find it hard to believe that they're going to skimp on these scenes in order to make time back for the Wall. According to the promo for next week, there's a scene with Cersei, too. Bran and co. are arriving at the Children of the Forest, which, given the title of the episode, I would expect to be a fairly sizeable scene. There's tying up Arya and the Hound's storyline for the season- possibly with his death/ Arya leaving him behind. There's at least one scene with Dany. If you don't want Stannis's arrival to be a 5 minute rush job at the end of Episode 9, how much time do you honestly believe that his arrival is going to get in an episode where nearly every other major plotline requires tying up?
Â 
I mean, I am a Stannis fan, not going to lie, but by and large, I've been OK with him having a more reduced role in the series because of the time limits of TV, I just think that in this episode it takes the piss a bit to push one of Stannis's only major awesome bits into part-way through next episode, the main focus of which is going to be elsewhere, to replace it with Jon walking through a gate. And I think it's silly to have a whole episode dedicated to the Wall, and the battle with the wildlings, and take plenty of time to flesh out your side characters, and do long, beautiful battle sequences, which is fine and dandy, but then basically cut off the ending/ Act 3/ whatever you want to call it, of the sequence. I'm not going to stop watching the show or anything, and I didn't expect Stannis to be the focal point of this episode, but given that his appearance DOES bring the battle to an end, and it is a pretty major moment for his character, then yes, I was kind of expecting to see him.

I'm not going to stop watching the show or anything, and I didn't expect Stannis to be the focal point of this episode, but given that his appearance DOES bring the battle to an end, and it is a pretty major moment for his character, then yes, I was kind of expecting to see him.


I can see your point here, but I have to disagree with handling Stannis' saving the wall the same as Tywin saving KL. For one thing, I can't possible handle the "I told you D&D hate Stannis" fallout that would bring about. I know some on here think that it's all a conspiracy to make Stannis into this villain because they hate him and think he is a republican yada yada yada. I couldn't stand Stannis when I was reading the books until he came to the wall. Before then I just thought he was this butt hurt middle child that never got enough attention despite claiming to be this great warrior that lost every battle and constantly needed to be bailed out. After the wall is when I began to see Stannis as more than that and possibly a great leader. I'm starting to think he's back to being a sniveling whiny little bitch again after ADWD, but that's a topic for another debate. Anyway, I really think people should reserve judgment on how they handle Stannis' crowning moment until it actually happens rather than being pissed that it didn't already happen the way they wanted it to.Â

2414	marsyao	2014-06-10	Amen.Â  In the books, the NW had been defending the wall for days before Stannis finally arrived.Â  Granted, once the back-door pirates had been taken care of, defending the wall wasn't that bad, they were nonetheless exhausted and had done 90% of the work, only to have their victory taken away by the Late Lord Stannis.
Â 
Stannis will have his day next week; then we can have an entire season of him trying to get the NW to put him on the Iron Throne and fighting a bogged down land war in Asia The North.


Â 
That is not true, in the book, the NW repulsed Mance's first attack, but casualities of the wilding was not great (around 200-300), and as Mance told Jon, the first attack was just a probe, if NW do not yield, he would order attack on different location along the wall at the same time, and besides he had the Horn of Winter. So it was indeed Stannis's surprise attack save the wall

A book doesn't have to fit into 60-minute episodes, 10 per season. Â Literally, the only constraint is whether you can keep your readers' attention. Â 24 million sales tends to indicate that the answer is yes, it can.
Â 
Any TV show or movie - even something like GOT which will run to 70-80 hours overall - has to condense, pick and choose to get the whole story in. Â That's why people get irked when plot strands appear that don't lead anywhere (Craster's is probably the major example). Â Everybody has little things they liked in the books that don't make it into the show, so it's only natural to rant "Craster's blah blah blah why couldn't they show X?"

I agree. More than the actual episode at Craster's, the scenes leading up towards it (in episodes 3 and 4) were really strong and helped to turn Jon into a believable leader.
Â 
The more I think about it, the more I like how they structured the Wall storyline this season. Episodes 9 and 10 are the "meaty" storylines, but there was a nice character-based buil-up towards it, which is more apparent (and works better) when you bing watch all the season.

Â 
I don't really agree with you, but in any case, that's not my point. Â Craster's is just an example; the point is that "filler" is a concept that applies to the book and the TV show in very different ways. Â There's no time- or page-limit on a book.
2420	rmholt	2014-06-10	Honestly, I can't think if any moment more shocking than Cat's return...even Tywin's death.

I thought the reverse maybe bc there's precedent for UnCat.
2421	rmholt	2014-06-10	Â 
P.S. I still don't get the Stannis fans. All the info we have on him really is through the POV of a lovely guy who thinks the sun shines out of his behind. Unreliable narrator perhaps? IÂ 

 I'm a Stannis fan & if he gets 5 min that's fine bc it's 5 good minutes. If he waits til just the right moment to appear I prefer to wait as well
There is a floating population that can't believe something didn't meet their expectations one ep then it turns out fine if they'd just kept their pants on for a week or three. I just spritz some Xanax on the screen.
2422	WTFSalami	2014-06-10	I can't believe none of you realizes how stupid it would have been for them to cram Stannis into the end of this episode. Everybody would have rolled their eyes and called bullshit if this battle ended the exact same way Blackwater did. I can see it now:
"Really show? You show two battles in 4 seasons, and both are directed by the same exact guy, and both end the same exact way?? Seriously? Real fucking original, Game of Thrones." 
We absolutely needed an episode break before Stannis' charge, because it's going to be balls-to-the-wall epic when he shows up.
2423	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-10	I'm glad Stan didn't show up, this was the Nights watch's moment, don't need Stannis coming in at the last second and taking all the glory.


While I don't entirely agree or disagree with your post, as a fan who bleeds green I feel obligated to say Go Eagles!

Wait, Stannis can't arrive next episode because it's too crammed already, but in the next breath you hope it gets as far as the offer of Winterfell?
Do you just enjoy complaining so much that you can't be bothered by reason or sense?

It wasn't pointless, especially now that we have seen the Battle for the Wall and how the CK mission essentially made Jon into a leader that the men trusted when his time came to take control. Take away CK, and then you just have Jon Snow fighting the entire season with Thorne and Slynt...he has no way to prove himself as a capable leader without it, and the books didn't provide any alternatives because the book throws Jon straight into fighting as soon as he gets back to Castle Black. Take CK away from Bran, and we have...nothing. Basically, nothing. Nothing until he gets to the CotF. You could put Coldhands back in there, but still, that doesn't nothing for Bran's character...it just makes him look that more incompetent because he needs supernatural help to get there. To me, Locke's mission to kill Bran was "filler"...he literally didn't have a point. His only purpose was to make Bran warg Hodor to kill him, and they didn't need Locke to make that happen- of course, that could be important in the future, but it wasn't here.

Â 
Well yeah, I certainly agree that "anything that's not in the books" is a horrible definition of filler. Â I'm such a huge fan of the books that my obsession kind of scares me, but I am by no means a book purist when it comes to the TV show. Â Generally, I think the creators are doing a great job of putting out a good TV show, and rigid conformance to the book story would probably ruin that.
Â 
A lot of people would say that filler is any new material that doesn't advance the plot. Â I wouldn't even agree with that, so long as it's sufficiently entertaining. Â For example, I really liked the Grey Worm/Missandei stuff because it tangles with some really complicated emotional/physical/sexual/psychological material that really makes you think--although it goes nowhere (at least so far as is readily apparent) in terms of advancing the structure of the plot. Â I wouldn't even begin to call that "filler."
Â 
I would say that new material that isn't very entertaining and doesn't advance the plot very much is probably what qualifies as "filler." Â Obviously, we can disagree over whether the Craster's sub-plot meets that, but I call Craster's "filler" because (1) it wasn't very entertaining (in fact, a lot of people hated it as just another addition to the surfeit of sexual violence and human degradation), (2) it didn't add a tremendous amount to characterization, and (3) it didn't advance the plot.
Â 
I think they could've advanced the plot better by things like showing Mance in his camp plotting the destruction of the North, or having Jon and Sam talk about why it's so important to defend the wall against the wildlings. Â Those things could've set up this past episode a lot better than it actually got set up, IMO.

It's hard not to look at the overkill of sexual violence and human degradation that is the Craster's Keep subplot nonsense without noticing that even the gods awful rapists looked bored with the rape scenes. Â They looked more bored and fed up with it than I did. Â

Â Those things could've set up this past episode a lot better than it actually got set up, IMO....but that's what was happening there, even if the books didn't explicitly talk about it. I don't like rape, but it was completely obvious to me that those men would be using Craster's wives like that. And we never see it in the books because we basically don't get to see anything of the mutineers other than Coldhands' having killed them. I don't think anyone would have cared about the rape at if it hadn't aired so soon after the episode with Jaime and Cersei, tbh. If the show was going to show Craster's Keep, then it makes sense that they would show what the mutineers are doing to them. And I would have to disagree that everyone 'hated' it...Karl "The Fooking Legend" Tanner went up in popularity dramatically after that, and many people loved his death scene...especially since one of the abused women helped to kill him.I've already said why it added to their characterization, so I completely disagree with you there. And there are MANY things in this show that don't advance the plot that isn't filler. All of the interaction between Tyrion and Cersei, for example - it's not technically necessary to see him talk with his sister (something that isn't in the books but was added to the show), but it was absolutely great characterization for both Tyrion and Cersei. I think most people claim 'filler' to be something they don't care for, more than something that really is filler and doesn't belong in the show. I would say that CK belonged in the show, just like Tyrion and Cersei's talks belonged in the show. I would say that some of Theon's torture scenes didn't belong in the show because dwelling on absolutely everything they did to him wasn't necessary in order to drive the point home.

2438	le_pounce	2014-06-10	I feel like some of us are overestimating the dramatic power of Stannis' sneak attack. Yes, defeating the wildling army is a hugely important event for both Stannis and Westeros as a whole, but from a TV drama perspective, it's not terribly interesting. Consider:Â 
Â 
1) Stannis is not under any threat. He may be outnumbered, but he has superior resources and the element of surprise.Â 
Â 
2) His attack of the wildlings doesn't represent anything meaningful about him as a character. Sure, he's going through the trouble because he's decided that that's what kings do, but there's no personal element to it. He's not, say, choosing to save a former enemy, or reversing a character trait (e.g., Han Solo at the end of New Hope).Â 
Â 
Compare that to the battle of Castle Black, where everyone on the NW thinks they're going to die, but still manage to succeed against all odds by believing in their cause and because certain characters manage to change and grow.

plus, it wasn't even Stannis or Castle Black's denouement in the book. I'm actually glad they seem to be saving the LC election for next season, and thus giving Stannis' save a higher place of honor - in the season finale. For 3 seasons, episode 9 has been THE episode. How obvious do they have to make it that they're doing something different this season?

Â Obviously, we can disagree over whether the Craster's sub-plot meets that, but I call Craster's "filler" because (1) it wasn't very entertaining (in fact, a lot of people hated it as just another addition to the surfeit of sexual violence and human degradation), (2) it didn't add a tremendous amount to characterization, and (3) it didn't advance the plot.
Â 
I think they could've advanced the plot better by things like showing Mance in his camp plotting the destruction of the North, or having Jon and Sam talk about why it's so important to defend the wall against the wildlings. Â Those things could've set up this past episode a lot better than it actually got set up, IMO.
I completely agree with this.
2443	Hajk	2014-06-10	The problem with having Stannis coming in even next episode is that there is hardly any real action left for season 5. What we have from that point on is primarily:
Â 
1) Stannis and Jon discussing lots of stuff at the wall.
Â 
2) Tyrion and Jorah going through Essos. This has potential, especially because of the two excellent actors involved.
Â 
3) Dany dealing with problems of ruling while a coalition gathers against her.
Â 
4) Cersei mismanaging stuff and Jaime hating on her.
Â 
5) Arianne trying and failing to displace Doran and spending long time in silent imprisonment.
Â 
6) Arya training to be a faceless man
Â 
What about the big action scenes and victory scenes?
2444	roxWolfox	2014-06-10	Â 
I feel like some of us are overestimating the dramatic power of Stannis' sneak attack. Yes, defeating the wildling army is a hugely important event for both Stannis and Westeros as a whole, but from a TV drama perspective, it's not terribly interesting. Consider:Â 
Â 
1) Stannis is not under any threat. He may be outnumbered, but he has superior resources and the element of surprise.Â 
Â 
2) His attack of the wildlings doesn't represent anything meaningful about him as a character. Sure, he's going through the trouble because he's decided that that's what kings do, but there's no personal element to it. He's not, say, choosing to save a former enemy, or reversing a character trait (e.g., Han Solo at the end of New Hope).Â 
Â 
Compare that to the battle of Castle Black, where everyone on the NW thinks they're going to die, but still manage to succeed against all odds by believing in their cause and because certain characters manage to change and grow.
Â

Welcome to the boards.Â  
Â 
I had to think about this from a non-book-reader perspective, and I do think most of the audience (who don't know about Stannis' arrival to save the day, so to speak) are feeling the Wall is about to be breached and the Night's Watch end is nigh.Â  Mance's threat is rather menacing in the trailer, if nothing else.
The ones I've spoken to that haven't read the books are still reeling over Oberyn's death and Tyrion's apparent demise so they don't really 'feel' the emotions we book-readers did at the happenings at the Wall.

2446	DaveyJoe	2014-06-10	Hello, I am a lurker here -Â  I have read books 1-4, and started 5, but stopped. I am now reading book 4 over again, and will attempt to finish book 5Â this time aroundÂ  Â Â 
Â 
IÂ thouroughly enjoy reading everyone's thoughts here after the episodes air!Â Â 
Â 
I have a question - I read a lot of the pages here, and haven't seen it mentioned, so forgive me if it has been!
Â 
Eli Roth tweeted about the lastest episode yesterday, and he mentioned a 'cameo'... WHOÂ HADÂ A CAMEO?? (sorry if this is the wrong place for this question).

I think Neil Marshall is one of the archers on the wall. Here is a picture of Marshall: Â http://cdn.screenran...black-sails.jpg

Mind you, that grin on Edd's (Ben Crompton's) face just seems wrong somehow ...Â

I do love that picture. Â Now, just imagine if they'd actually fleshed out all of those characters. Â Hmmmmmm, perhaps I should take this picture to the Nitpick thread. Â I'm sure I could use a good rant about that, ehhhhh, maybe tomorrow or after the season ends. Â I do just love that picture and want to enjoy it. Â 
Â 
As for Edd, I'm just going to fanwank that the smile is from his one bout of optimism in the books, he was thinking he'd be lucky enough to die before they figured out a way to put his corpse back to work. Â LOL Â  Â Â

Stannis attack on Deepwood Motte.
Myrcella's disfigurement, which can be fleshed out.
Some action sequences during the siege of Mereen. A sortie, or something to that effect.
Quentyn and everyone else trying to infiltrate into Mereen, if it happens.
Hardhome, if they include it.
Euron's attack on the Reach, likely off screen due budget
Maybe something at the Vale, of which we are all unsullied.
The pits.

Â 
There really hasn't been anything other than minor clashes for most of this season outside of the battle on the wall and I think people overall are more interested in the game play and the interpersonal dynamics and 4 & 5 were filled with that. I mean, we have the rise of the sparrows to flesh out, Stannis and the conflict at the wall with Melisandre and Jon and whatever Shireen's purpose will be. Plus Mance infiltrating Winterfell and Yara (Asha) getting caught and reunited with Theon. Â 
Â 
There is just so much that I think may have read as boring in the books but given the quality of the cast can be just perfect. I mean, just Tyrion talking about people gets rave reviews so I don't think we need serious action to satisfy people.
2450	Hodor's Dragon	2014-06-10	I see so much talk in the forums about the whole Quentyn story getting left out.Â 
Â 
I just can't see that. Â It's central to the Dorne story, Quentyn and his buds are interesting characters, and DRAGONS!
Â 
Streamlining? Â Sure, I can see that. Â Left out, no way.
Â 
One thing people should take into account is that I think the show is going to be able to get away with giving the Dorne story nearly as much space as it gets in the books, if not as much. Â Initially, I had thought it was just way too much new stuff way too late in the story, and they were going to streamline it from sumo wrestler to Olympic gymnast.
Â 
But here's the X factor: Oberyn's popularity. Â His character really went over big. Â In fact, I saw a recent fanbase poll that had him as the 2nd most popular character (favorite character of 11% of the fan base) to Tyrion's #1. Â Granted, Tyrion crushed him with 26%, but still. Â As long as they tie Dorne heavily in to revenge for Oberyn, which in fact is really what kicks the Dorne story off, I think they can go with a lot of Dorne and it will work. Â Plus sexy Sand Snakes.

Â 
Who the heck was that dude? Has we seen him before?
Â 
One aspect of S3E09's aftermath is that basically now the only people at The Wall the audience knows or cares about are Lord Jon Snow, Samwell Tarly, Gilly, Little Sam, Dolorous Edd, Aemon Targaryen (and maybe the little kid who killed Ygritte). Janos Slyn, Allister and Tormund are also still at Castle Black as well but do we really care about them?
Â 
I thought the episode was good, not great. In the books, Jon is my favorite character (and then Arya) but in the show it is probably Tyrion followed by Brienne/Arya. Stannis I really don't care about one way or the other.

Â 
I don't think so. Â Sam's interpretation is "novel." Â 
Â 
But while they consider sex to be against the rules, it's the kind of violation that is treated with a nod and a wink. Â Numerous black brothers visit the brothels in Mole's Town regularly - I mean why do you think they even have multiple brothels in Mole's Town? Â 
Â 
In the books, most of Mole's Town is subterranean, and the crows call visiting the brothels "digging for buried treasure." Â Brothers visiting Mole's Town are known as "miners."

Â 
Well, people seem ready and willing to care about Alliser Thorne after his heroic showing in the defense of the Wall, anyway.Â  We'll see what sort of disposition he has in the next episode and if he has absorbed Bowen Marsh has more of a respect, if not like, for Jon Snow now going forward.
Â 
Or he could go the other way, believe whatever bullshit Slynt inevitably spins about himself and Jon, and cement his Hateable Status (hate's a form of emotional investment after all )

Hobb was mentioned earlier in the season so yeah, I think that was supposed to be him.

Janos Slyn, Allister and Tormund are also still at Castle Black as well but do we really care about them?Six important characters are pretty good to wrap up the remainder of the season (beyond the sea you have Dany, Barristan, Missandei, Grey Worm, Daario, Jorah, and possibly Hizdahr; Arya's storyline only has two important people; Stannis really only has himself, Melisandre, Davos, Shireen, and Selyse; Sansa, Petyr, and Robin are holding down the Vale story alone for the most part...).I think later they will reintroduce Mance Rayder though and possibly some other members of his court like Val if they decide to use that character. I also think that Alliser's bigger role in this episode was a good move too since it kind of showed him in a fairly positive light leading the main sortie against the wildlings and delivering three inspirational speeches in about two minutes.
2460	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Saw episode just now. Brilliant! Moved to tears with Grenn, Pyp and Ygritte's death - And just realised I've been humming that bit of music since it must have appeared in season 3.. never knew where it was from till now!
Â 
No need for Stannis till next week. It would have completely stole Jon Snows thunder, and also cut his suicide mission.
Â 
Can't wait for next week. Loved the episode and noted how well directed it was. The action flowed naturally and "realistically".
Â 
UKS
Â 
P.S. I still don't get the Stannis fans. All the info we have on him really is through the POV of a lovely guy who thinks the sun shines out of his behind. Unreliable narrator perhaps? IÂ 

I dunno, he came across pretty well in Jon's chapters too, and Asha's
2461	Raksha 2014	2014-06-10	I personally think part of the culling this year (RIP Pyp, Grenn, etc) is to make way for Dorne charcters. Excited.


Â 
While the Dornish contingent has an important political role to play, the Night's Watch is crucial in the fight against the Others, which seems so dire as to eventually overshadow all dynastic concerns in Westeros if the Others are not stopped. Â So I don't think that undercutting the Wall, via using too much filler there or killing established members of the Night's Watch, to accommodate Sexy Vixens of Dorne (sounds like a porn flick; and I'm sure the showrunners are aware of that) is a real good idea. Â We should have more Dornish characters; and not just to capitalize (?spelling) on the deserved popularity of Prince Oberyn (  ), but because they are part of the story. Â 
Â 
(I just hope we'll see the Kingsmoot and Victarion and Euron, etc., but I'm not sure we will; it depends on whether they think they can have Victarion sail to Essos with the goal of snaring Dany and her dragons without a Kingsmoot intro)
2462	ejhawman	2014-06-10	Having seen the uploads on YouTube, and heard about what did and didn't happen, I offer this:
Â 
The series is screwing up.Â 
Â 
This should have been a two-episode battle, starting in 8 and ending with Stannis' arrival in 9.
Â 
Ygritte should have died in a skirmish around 6 or 7.
Â 
I'm leery of Pyp and Grenn dying, but if this indicates they serve no real purpose in the books, I'll accept it.
Â 
Looks like Jon won't be getting elected Lord Commander this season. Maybe episode 2 next season, which is pushing it. Have to have enough time for Sam to get to the tropics for Aemon's funeral and the Fat Pink Mast (implied, of course).
Â 
Why are there only supposed to be 100 crows left at CB? Judging by what we saw, they should nearly all be dead. They should have gone with the book estimate of a thousand.
Â 
The issue of shooting stuff to the top of the Wall may have been dealt with properly: the one bolt that made it was from a giant's corssbow, equivalent to a ballista. Though I'm not sure even the largest ballista could reach - but it's a fudge any which way.

Â 
I think theoretically a very large well constructed ballista could strike the top of the wall. There is some evidence of some ballista's having a range of 500 yards (1500 feet), so the top of wall? Sure, why not.
Â 
I'm leery of Pyp and Grenn dying, but if this indicates they serve no real purpose in the books, I'll accept it.
Â 

Â 
Was there any evidence in the books that Pyp or Grenn would have really significant role to play in the end game? For me, they were pure supporting players through and through. And both characters got to shine with some memorable moments before getting killed off.
Â 
I wasn't supra impressed by the episode, but if your going to spend and entire hour televising a battle, there needs to be some casualties of consequence for the Night's Watch. It was a completely logical choice for D&D to make and I can't fault them for it. There simply wasn't enough screen time to introduce another set of characters at the Wall to only have them dispatched 7 or 8 episodes later.
Â 

Â 
Â 
This should have been a two-episode battle, starting in 8 and ending with Stannis' arrival in 9.
Â 
Personally, I think this episode should have been episode 4 and ended with Stannis's arrival in episode 5. The Craster's Keep subplot was pointless and that momentum from that great moment between Ygritte and Jon last season was lost because of the long delay before their eventual meetup again. Â
2464	espresso	2014-06-10	On rewatch, noticed that Jon took a lesson from Khal Turner, fookin legend of gin alley when he spat on the Magnar of Thenn's face.
Â 
Also, Sam killed a Thenn with a crossbow. A Tarly at last.

Judging by what we saw, they should nearly all be dead. They should have gone with the book estimate of a thousand.Several viewers counted on-screen deaths of the NWmen at about 30-50 people. So they lost about half of their men, it seems.

2466	Raksha 2014	2014-06-11	I watched the show again from start to finish.
Â 
Pro's:
1. Â The music - tense and powerful. Â I loved the drums.
2. Â Sam coming out of himself more and more; he's strong enough to mentor his comrades and the young refugee boy.
3. Â Alliser Thorne! Â Who knew he could be such a charismatic badass.
4. Â Decent CGI on the mammoth and giants.
5. Â The giant thundering through the tunnel with just five scared Crows to stop him - awesome moments as Grenn takes the lead and fires up the troops in the sight of certain doom.
6. Â Ghost!
7. Â The looks exchanged between Ygritte and Jon - he's so happy that she didn't shoot him; he actually smiles. Â Some decent acting from both actors, conveying that Ygritte's love for Jon was stronger than her anger over his choosing the Night's Watch over the Wildlings. Â Naturally, she's fatally wounded seconds later.
8. Â Some good single fights from Alliser and Jon and their foes. Â But Grenn and his men were the baddest-asses of them all.
9. No scenes with gratuitous boobage or pouting Daenerys. Â (and for once, when Jon looked sulky, it was obvious that he had good reason not to smile)
Â 
Cons:
1. Â They could have shaved off a few minutes from the extensive Sam-in-love discussions, so the actual battle could be 3 or 4 minutes longer.
2. Â Tell me again why Mance/Wildings torched all that acreage? Â It looked like it was mostly forest, which would provide good cover for the Wildlings. Â Burning it all down would also kill off many forest animals which could have otherwise provided food for hungry Wildlings.
3. Â Ygritte fatally shoots poor Pyp; then does nothing while Sam presents a great target as he sits down and comforts the dying Pyp in his arms. Â Why didn't Ygritte kill Sam? Â (they could have shown her distracted by a Crow actually engaging her in combat or shooting at her so she has to move to escape)
4. Â Jon and co. up on the Wall, seem to look down on the approaching giant and mammoth (with ropes, grappling hook-thingies, etc.) for several minutes before it occurs to Jon to order his men to throw down the barrel at them. Â Why did he wait? Â If he'd thrown it down (and also shot arrows) a few minutes earlier, he could have killed or crippled both mammoth and giant and burned the ropes and grappling hook thingummy), thus preventing the breaking of the outer gate, or at least tried! Â That made no sense to me. Â 
5. Â I know that Jon is saddened by Ygritte's death, but does it make any sense at all for him to head out to try to penetrate a force of thousands of Wildlings to assasinate Mance with no sword and apparently no other weapon either? Â Seriously, he couldn't have mentioned to Sam that he had a dagger or knife or something. Â  It would have made more sense to send Gilly to do the deed; she at least has the smarts to use whatever's handy (frozen leg of something) as a weapon. Â Jon's dramatic exit at the end of the sequel seemed as much a decision to commit suicide as it did seizing on a desperate tactic to try to save what was left of Castle Black and his brothers.
Â 
Overall, a fairly good episode, but it was no Blackwater.

By pretending to negotiate a truce, he can get close to Mance.In the book he is sent to kill Mance under the guise of parley...here, he makes the decision to do it himself.
2468	sj4iy	2014-06-11	I wanted to quote a previous post but really can't find it... the post was about
or something similar. Unfortunately, as much as I really want to watch this (and even enjoy it) I honestly believe that we are not going to have such a moment. For the time being, in the tv show every "good" or even just "debating" point Jon has (or every other character in the Wall) just has to be changed....
they're really f&()_*ing this arc (as well as Bran's)... and I don't think it's due to lack of screentime or cast....
so they will probably don't go along the beheading too :S

Honestly, I think his arc is better on the show than in the book because he's more believable as a leader, and it's more believable that he will get elected LC.
2469	Caerl Targaryen	2014-06-11	Honestly, I think his arc is better on the show than in the book because he's more believable as a leader, and it's more believable that he will get elected LC.How is he more believable as a leader on the show? He didn't organize the defense and simply followed Ser Alliser's orders.
He ordered some arrows to be fired and some oil to be dropped, all while letting a mammoth and two giants attach chains to the main gate. Only after the chains are attached and the mammoth starts walking away from the gate does he have anyone do anything about it. If he had had oil dropped as soon as they got close, both giants, all of the wildlings, and the mammoth would have been killed and he wouldn't have lost 6 men to the giant in the tunnel. If wildlings are approaching the gate with giants and a mammoth, you don't wait to see what they might do. They want to bring down the gate. So you kill them ASAP.
After he has some arrows fired, he heads down off the wall, kills a few wildlings, and decides to go on a suicide mission without clearly leaving anyone in charge. And that's just this episode.
That's not good leadership material.

Â 
I know very little about weapons and military strategy, but I couldn't understand why Jon wasn't throwing everything his up-top crew had at the giant & mammoth & equipment as they approached the gate, rather than waiting until the giant was affixing the grapplehook thingy to the gate. Â It made no sense to me. Â Â The directors could have made it more believable by having the giant shooting one of those monster bows upwards while the normal-sized wildlings pulled the mammoth to the gate and hitched him to it.

2473	The Drunkard	2014-06-11	Eh?
2474	boojam	2014-06-11	I don't think so. Â Sam's interpretation is "novel." Â Â But while they consider sex to be against the rules, it's the kind of violation that is treated with a nod and a wink. Â Numerous black brothers visit the brothels in Mole's Town regularly - I mean why do you think they even have multiple brothels in Mole's Town? Â Â In the books, most of Mole's Town is subterranean, and the crows call visiting the brothels "digging for buried treasure." Â Brothers visiting Mole's Town are known as "miners."Nothing 'novel' about it, from what Jeor Mormont says in season 1 what the NW does sexually has been in place for 8000 years! If the Oath has been in place for 8000 years.Elsewise what the hell is it?Seems the Oath does not prohibit homosexuality or five fingered Mary.So with out Sam's obvious analysis it's been going on , defacto, forever!Actually , on this forum, the whole issue has been raised many times, a celibate army, really?!The Spartans, Roman Army, the Mongol armies and all other fearsome military were not and were effective. George's alternate universe Earth has some magic, some of which may be faked, some of it delusional, some may be real (what ever the hell real 'magic' is , outside the metaphorical kind) and dragons, a few other fantasy trimmings, but all else is just flat Earth-like, including most biology.I can see not keeping a family for economic reasons. (Economics was the root cause of the imposition of celibacy in the Catholic Church, which did ban priests from marriage until 1022.)GRRM even has an emasculated slave army, I don't think , in this world, there has ever been an effective 'slave' army (in the literal sense, one could quibble about what being in an army and being a slave means)... however I will give GRRM a slave army, but 'emasculated' , I know what kind of psychological condition he is trying to create, and maybe the physiology of PLANETOS is wildly different, but even eunuchs in this world , due to lack of testosterone have less bone growth, small bodies but more body mass and are passive and less aggressive, just the opposite things you want in a soldier!The cases in this world are very rare.If George wanted to really put in a square wave an army of 10,000 slave women would have been a nice touch!An Amazon army.

2475	Janicia	2014-06-11	In my head cannon, the reason the cooks were skulking around in the kitchens rather than out fighting is that they're the medical team. Â The guy stalking stalking out of the other room with a cleaver probably had been performing surgeries on wounded nights watchmen. Â The boiling water was to clean out wounds. Â
2476	StannisForKing299AL	2014-06-11	My God i just noticed during my rewatch of episode 9, it appears one of the wildlings shouting at the wall at around 24 mins (hes the one in the center) has come into possession of what appear to be Karl Tanners magical dirks... If this is so the nights watch are in trouble. Except he dies two minuites later. What will come next in the story if these fockin legendary items? Who knows? Prehaps they come into possession of Karl Tanner/Azor Ahai reborn. Karl was burned supposedly and the fanboy and fangirls cried for him. Salt and fire. Also if you watch closely you can clearly see a lone figure emerge from crasters burning keep. The devil is in the detail!

Â The guy stalking stalking out of the other room with a cleaver probably had been performing surgeries on wounded nights watchmen. Â The boiling water was to clean out wounds.In the book Maester Aemon was the attending ER doctor during the battles, we don't see him doing any of this , but then there was no time.Always puzzled me everybody that needed a Maester during a battle or fight or whatever in the book probably could not find one in a 100 miles.But then I don't know how it was done in the 15th century anyway, you did what you could , some recovered, most died of infections.
2478	Rashtibram	2014-06-11	GRRM even has an emasculated slave army, I don't think , in this world, there has ever been an effective 'slave' army (in the literal sense, one could quibble about what being in an army and being a slave means)... however I will give GRRM a slave army, but 'emasculated' , I know what kind of psychological condition he is trying to create, and maybe the physiology of PLANETOS is wildly different, but even eunuchs in this world , due to lack of testosterone have less bone growth, small bodies but more body mass and are passive and less aggressive, just the opposite things you want in a soldier!
The cases in this world are very rare.
If George wanted to really put in a square wave an army of 10,000 slave women would have been a nice touch!
An Amazon army.


Well, elite slave armies like the Ottoman janissaries and the Safavid qizilbash were pretty effective for the most part; but the lack of testosterone is a major plot hole that doesn't make much sense. Suspension of disbelief, I guess.
2479	A Prince of Dorne	2014-06-11	Any time the dialogue differs from the books it's as if a 13 year old wrote it.Â
2480	rmholt	2014-06-11	Rewatched. Not better.
2481	Wunhopkuendo	2014-06-11	Having seen the uploads on YouTube, and heard about what did and didn't happen, I offer this:
Â 
The series is screwing up.Â 
Â 
This should have been a two-episode battle, starting in 8 and ending with Stannis' arrival in 9.
Â 
Ygritte should have died in a skirmish around 6 or 7.
Â 
I'm leery of Pyp and Grenn dying, but if this indicates they serve no real purpose in the books, I'll accept it.
Â 
Looks like Jon won't be getting elected Lord Commander this season. Maybe episode 2 next season, which is pushing it. Have to have enough time for Sam to get to the tropics for Aemon's funeral and the Fat Pink Mast (implied, of course).
Â 
Why are there only supposed to be 100 crows left at CB? Judging by what we saw, they should nearly all be dead. They should have gone with the book estimate of a thousand.
Â 
The issue of shooting stuff to the top of the Wall may have been dealt with properly: the one bolt that made it was from a giant's corssbow, equivalent to a ballista. Though I'm not sure even the largest ballista could reach - but it's a fudge any which way.


Wait a minute. So you didn't actually watch the show, but rather clips on youtube and read discussion here? Ah that really does make you some kind of authority on this episode eh? You're the kind of audience that no one should take seriously and whose comments should be ignored out of hand. Even the show writers, if they cared what the audience had to say post episodes, wouldn't give a shite about anything you had to say because you aren't even a customer at this point. So just do everyone a favor and disappear.
2482	Wunhopkuendo	2014-06-11	I watched the show again from start to finish.
Cons:
1. Â They could have shaved off a few minutes from the extensive Sam-in-love discussions, so the actual battle could be 3 or 4 minutes longer.
2. Â Tell me again why Mance/Wildings torched all that acreage? Â It looked like it was mostly forest, which would provide good cover for the Wildlings. Â Burning it all down would also kill off many forest animals which could have otherwise provided food for hungry Wildlings.
3. Â Ygritte fatally shoots poor Pyp; then does nothing while Sam presents a great target as he sits down and comforts the dying Pyp in his arms. Â Why didn't Ygritte kill Sam? Â (they could have shown her distracted by a Crow actually engaging her in combat or shooting at her so she has to move to escape)
4. Â Jon and co. up on the Wall, seem to look down on the approaching giant and mammoth (with ropes, grappling hook-thingies, etc.) for several minutes before it occurs to Jon to order his men to throw down the barrel at them. Â Why did he wait? Â If he'd thrown it down (and also shot arrows) a few minutes earlier, he could have killed or crippled both mammoth and giant and burned the ropes and grappling hook thingummy), thus preventing the breaking of the outer gate, or at least tried! Â That made no sense to me. Â 
5. Â I know that Jon is saddened by Ygritte's death, but does it make any sense at all for him to head out to try to penetrate a force of thousands of Wildlings to assasinate Mance with no sword and apparently no other weapon either? Â Seriously, he couldn't have mentioned to Sam that he had a dagger or knife or something. Â  It would have made more sense to send Gilly to do the deed; she at least has the smarts to use whatever's handy (frozen leg of something) as a weapon. Â Jon's dramatic exit at the end of the sequel seemed as much a decision to commit suicide as it did seizing on a desperate tactic to try to save what was left of Castle Black and his brothers.
Â 
Overall, a fairly good episode, but it was no Blackwater.


1. Did the battle need to be 3-4 minutes longer? What would more minutes gain us that the battle we had didn't?
2. I don't know why Mance did that other than to make a signal and perhaps scare the shit out of the wall. Maybe there were no animals left in that part of the woods. That could explain what took so friggin long to build the fire in the first place. I mean the advanced Tormund party had plenty of time to scale the wall and pillage the villages south of the wall while Jon had time to carry out the Craster's Keep raid. What was Mance doing all that time?
3. I think you weren't paying attention to the whole scene there. Did you not notice that Sam and Pyp kept popping up from cover to fire and then go back down? Pyp was hit on the way up, while Sam took care of him behind cover.
4. My guess is that they only had so many barrels and the best effect would be to hit them with the burning barrels while the mammoth was chained to the gait. Better chance of more casualties that way. No one would have know that the giant would be so angered by the loss of his friend(mate?) that he could lift the gate alone. Or perhaps it's a really long way down and hard to see details.Â 
5. Someone else covered this well, but I'll just add that we don't know for sure if he intends to suicide kill Mance just because he says so to Sam. Perhaps he feels like he is the only one who can parley with Mance since he knows him (ordered to in the books). So he'll try to get Mance to agree to some sort of truce, by time for the wall to recoup their losses, and try to assassinate Mance if all else fails. It's a desperate play no doubt, but as he says the will all die either way so it's a chance worth taking.Â

Â 
I think he will listen to what Mance has to say, but I don't think it will alter his plans to try and kill him if he gets the chance. Â

Perhaps, but we will most likely never know as Stannis will come in and save the day.
2485	sj4iy	2014-06-11	Perhaps, but we will most likely never know as Stannis will come in and save the day.


Â 
Well, we know they talk, because Mance says that he plans on killing every Crow in CB. Â Then we also see a shot of someone with a knife to Jon's throat, which could mean several things, although none of them good XD
Â 
In any case, I can't wait to see all of it come to fruition, it's damn exciting
2486	roxWolfox	2014-06-11	Â 
I do love that picture. Â Now, just imagine if they'd actually fleshed out all of those characters. Â Hmmmmmm, perhaps I should take this picture to the Nitpick thread. Â I'm sure I could use a good rant about that, ehhhhh, maybe tomorrow or after the season ends. Â I do just love that picture and want to enjoy it. Â 
Â 
As for Edd, I'm just going to fanwank that the smile is from his one bout of optimism in the books, he was thinking he'd be lucky enough to die before they figured out a way to put his corpse back to work. Â LOL Â  Â Â 


A picture of that smile right beside every single one of his quotes:Â  Edd the troll!Â Â  
Â 
Â 


Six important characters are pretty good to wrap up the remainder of the season (beyond the sea you have Dany, Barristan, Missandei, Grey Worm, Daario, Jorah, and possibly Hizdahr; Arya's storyline only has two important people; Stannis really only has himself, Melisandre, Davos, Shireen, and Selyse; Sansa, Petyr, and Robin are holding down the Vale story alone for the most part...).
I think later they will reintroduce Mance Rayder though and possibly some other members of his court like Val if they decide to use that character. I also think that Alliser's bigger role in this episode was a good move too since it kind of showed him in a fairly positive light leading the main sortie against the wildlings and delivering three inspirational speeches in about two minutes.


His scenes/lines certainly underlined his passion when defending the Night's Watch and the Wall for the non-book-readers.Â  This makes the speculation that he will assume Bowen Marsh's role all that more interesting.
2487	Maid So Fair	2014-06-11	Cons:
1. Â They could have shaved off a few minutes from the extensive Sam-in-love discussions, so the actual battle could be 3 or 4 minutes longer.


Â I might be a minority when it comes to this but I actually feel that the episode might have benefited from LESS battle scenes and more character drama (maybe not necessarily Sam and Gilly). Specifically more scenes with NW members apart from Jon and Sam and I was really really hoping for Mance. There were a number of really epic shots/fights like Thorne v Tormund, Jon v Styr, the see-saw and the giants in general, but I found many of the other battle scenes somewhat confusing, with a lot of similar-looking extras hacking at each other in the dark.
Â 
The wildfire explosion in Blackwater was sufficiently impressive but it were the character interactions that really made that episode for me. But to each their own.
2488	sj4iy	2014-06-11	Am I the only one who hopes that Martin finds a way to work the scythe into the book storyline? XD
2489	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-11	Am I the only one who hopes that Martin finds a way to work the scythe into the book storyline? XD


Nope. Im with ya there.
Â 
I think the reason why Mance lit a big ass fire is two-fold. To scare the piss out of the Watch, but also to keep the Others/White Walkers out of fray. At least the wights. By having a huge fire at his back, he protects the wildlings who fall in battle from turning into wights and remember, this is the reason why Mance is fighting anyway. To get away from those guys.Â

To get away from those guys.That's exactly what I thought, too. If he has all of those people, he will need a big-ass fire to protect them from the WW.
2491	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-11	Yeah its kinda common sense (as much as one can have in this 'verse) to take measures when you know theres gonna be a lot of dead people going on. This is likely the reason i have not seen astute viewers question why there was a massive fire.
2492	Amber W	2014-06-11	^ That's why I thought Mance lit the fire too. Although I did wonder why it took people so long to see it - doesn't it take time to get such a big-ass fire going?
2493	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-11	Ill chalk that one up to being TV/FIlm Logic.Â 
One does not see something spelling out impending doom until its already happened/happening. B:Â

And, on top, it cuts the main avenue of retreat for his "army", lowering the chances of a routing.

Wasn't it a signal to the guys south of the wall to attack? Or did they coordinate some other way?Â

hue! I do hope it makes it!
2500	Maid So Fair	2014-06-12	I thought the fire was just a show nod to the 'I'm going to light the biggest fire the north has ever seen' line, but I really like the idea of having it as a defence against the white walkers! If we can't have Mance at least we can have his epic one-liners!

2501	Ser Edmure Tully	2014-06-12	The fire was the signal for Tormund et al to attack, as discussed in 3x04.
But the WW idea is a cool added bonus.

Sort of an analog of the Native American , tho it's not clear to me that the north would not have made an 'arrangement' with them if they had of been promised to be peaceful.The non-cultured (so to speak) northern 'tribes' don't seem a lot different from the freefolk.There had my say.
2503	dbunting	2014-06-12	I am going to likely get burned alive for saying this, but I don't get all of the Blackwater love. To me, and I am entitled to my opinion, Blackwater was a good episode but it was also full of holes.This episode, had a lot of scenes that were very true to the book and it still gets slammed. If they hadn't wasted 45 seconds on this we could have had more of this....come on, really?For me, this has been the best season as a whole. Yes there have been some scenes that felt wasted but there were tens of thousands of words in the books that were wasted also, it just happens. Just relax and enjoy it for what it is, because after Sunday we have 10 months to wait and speculate again. If only we had a book to read between seasons to pass the time.....

I completely agree.  I liked BW, but it was never one of my favorite episodes...but I see people who treat it like the epitome of filmmaking.  I though WotW was a much bigger achievement.  I've seen numerous people comparing this to Helm's Deep...that's HUGE for a tv show.  No, it doesn't have all of the witty banter like KL, but it's not supposed to.  These are hardened men and scared boys, all of whom are expecting to die.  They aren't going to sit around, drinking wine and scaring the shit out of their bros just to be an ass...they are going to prepare and talk about women, fighting and dying.  Just the scope of this episode leaves me astounded on rewatch.  It's amazing, and BW pales in comparison.
Just my two cents.

That is both beautiful and heartbreaking........great to see them together, and still sad that Lady does not live.Â  They both look gorgeous, though.Â  That almost reminds me of a long haired Alaskan Malamute that a neighbor has that gets walked by my yard everyday.Â  That dog looks like a huge polar bear, but luckily, she's quite huggable.Â  "Lady" still looks oh so Ladylike.Â

(The impression given in the books is that The Others are not going to put on their BIG MOVE until WINTER HAS COME, on the show Winter has been kind of wimpy so far, in the books it's more of a 'in-your-face' harbinger , tho even George is still vague about just what's going to happen and when, it seems close.)
By the by the logical thing Mance could have done is to have negotiated with the NW about a peaceful migration to behind the Wall , to which price he would have to pay would be to be peacefull and using his troops to man the all the abandoned forts along the Wall, which is what happens eventually.
But as in the books and on the show Mance is full of wrath (I am never sure why) and vainglory (I am never sure why) and the Wildlings are in a froth and don't think rationally about what's a common enemy. Sort of an analog of the Native American , tho it's not clear to me that the north would not have made an 'arrangement' with them if they had of been promised to be peaceful.
The non-cultured (so to speak) northern 'tribes' don't seem a lot different from the freefolk.
There had my say.


Nicely stated.
Â 
Concerning the bolded part; as a Native (Arctic born/bred), I do sympathise with the Free Folk.Â  They (the Free Folk) are aware of the impending danger and have decided to fight for their lives no matter the cost.Â  They are being led by a man who (from what I recall) hasn't once attempted to contact the Night's Watch to warn them or reason with them, and he somehow manages to focus or magnify the wrath/resentment the Free Folk feel at being shut out of the 'realms of man' ... in essence they're tired of being told that they are not men/human.
The First Nations fought to keep their ancestral migration routes open.Â  The slaughter of the herds that the First Nations had followed for countless generations was probably the greatest source of their rage. There were warriors (Tecumseh, offhand) who tried to bring the nations together to drive away/slaughter the settlers, but most elders and chiefs chose to attempt negotiations rather than see the destruction of their ways.
Â 
Â 


I am going to likely get burned alive for saying this, but I don't get all of the Blackwater love. To me, and I am entitled to my opinion, Blackwater was a good episode but it was also full of holes.
This episode, had a lot of scenes that were very true to the book and it still gets slammed. If they hadn't wasted 45 seconds on this we could have had more of this....come on, really?
For me, this has been the best season as a whole. Yes there have been some scenes that felt wasted but there were tens of thousands of words in the books that were wasted also, it just happens. Just relax and enjoy it for what it is, because after Sunday we have 10 months to wait and speculate again. If only we had a book to read between seasons to pass the time.....


I think much of the Blackwater love has to do with Tyrion and the political climate of King's Landing, quite honestly.Â  I was never invested emotionally in the Lannisters (or King's Landing) or the back-stabbing/squabbling/scheming.Â  They all come across as self-indulgent, entitled jerks.Â  But I am a Neil Marshall fan - and knowing he only had a few days to get everything prepared, I think he did a bang-up job.
The reason I liked this past episode so much more is because of my emotional investment in the Night's Watch.Â  They are a group of uncouth, raw, and rather savage men/boys, and they live a day-to-day existence with very little awareness or recognition from the south concerning their sacrifices.Â  I shed a few tears, and dug holes in my husband's hand while watching ... and I'm still sad about the deaths.

2516	Farwynds Oceanseer	2014-06-12	Now that TV Alliser Thorne has shown actual leadership ability, does anyone else think he'll be merged with Ser Denys Mallister if the election comes next season? I see the Mallister merge more than Bown Marsh. The wound that Thorne got from Tormund could conceivably harden him against the wildlings, but, unlike Marsh, he doesn't seem stupid enough now to forget that the WW are coming and will be less difficult to fight if thousands of potential free folk wights can be made living allies.
2517	Maelys I Blackfyre	2014-06-12	Now, I didn't read through every page of this thread due to the fact that I just watched the episode a few moments ago and haven't had much time, but who exactly was the girl Maester Aemon was referring to when he spoke with Sam right before the beginning of the battle? I've always wanted to learn more about his past, as he seems to me like one of the most interesting characters.

Â I don't have evidence for this, but I immediately thought of Sheira Seastar (although Aemon would be 20-30 years younger than Sheira or BR); maybe that would explain why Aemon and Brynden Rivers don't talk?
2519	boojam	2014-06-13	Aww, that's lovely! I think Ygritte saved Gilly because she 'smelled out' she was a Wilding.
2520	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-06-13	I wonder how many men of the NW were slayed in this episode. If there were somewhere between 100 and 200 of them, I think their number now is between 50 and 100 after the battle. They need to fill their number at all cost.

There were 102 before the battle. Someone counted every NW death and it was above 40.

BR was sent to the Wall basically as a favour and an honour for Aemon, to make the transition easier - if they in fact could not stand each other it would have been a pretty dick move.

You're right. Well, Aemon + Sheira Seastar was pretty much crackpot anyway.Â 
Â 
You've got to wonder, though, why Aemon shows no awareness of BR's existence when they both served together at the wall for some time.

IIRC, I thought Aemon basically said that Egg had emptied the dungeons, and sent everyone including BR, as a sort of honor guard for Aemon when he traveled North to take the black. Â The way it's worded.....it's hard to say what his thoughts on BR might have been. Â I haven't read Dunk and Egg novellas yet, but I thought Aemon's statement was intentionally vague. Â

I'm talking about him leaving the Wall to become a tree root & intervening adventures
2531	Caerl Targaryen	2014-06-14	I disagree. 
He clearly demonstrated his leadership skills by commanding the wall and leading men into battle at castle black. 
He's then the only man with a plan to end this.How did he clearly demonstrate his leadership skills? Again, he didn't plan any of the defense of the Wall on the show. That was all Ser Alliser Thorne. When they pushed back Mance's first attempt to test the defenses of the Wall, Jon decides that he will best serve the Night's Watch and his brothers by abandoning them without anyone clearly in charge. This is even stated as being a suicide mission. How is this good leadership? He didn't do anything Edd didn't do.
This episode had Jon do the exact opposite of what he does in the book by having him choose to abandon his brothers (something he doesn't want to do there but is forced to by Ser Alliser and Janos Slynt) and by not having him heavily involved in the planning of the defense of the Wall.

It still doesn't change that Aemon's vagueness seems to suggest........there is a common story believed about BR, before and after the Wall. Â He speaks of him as a known quantity. Â I'd guess the vagueness all around is intentional on GRRMs part. Â
2533	rmholt	2014-06-14	I guess I didn't like it because the strategy was so stupid ie unrealistic. There should never have been sword fighting out in the open. BW and Book Wall made sense. This was just a bunch of random one on one fights. It should have been waves of wildlings crashing ineffectually against an impenetrable defense.

I agree. Â And most Unsullied I have talked to about this seem to think that Thorne was great leader. Â Unless the show has him die, I think it'd be a dick move to vote Jon as LC. Â Thorne clearly was the leader on the Wall.

He did fight well and finally got a quality kill on Styr at least. Really his only command was getting Grenn to go die in the tunnel to thwart the leader of the giants. That was an important move but it didn't seem like anyone even knew he gave that order. Sam and those that died in the tunnel know but that's it. Alliser Thorne was the hero in preparing Castle Black and leading the defense. What's done is done I guess.? Hooray for the bold and brave leader Thorne(I think I just threw up a little in my mouth).

Ok so they wanted the southern attack on the wall at the same time as Mance's attack from the north. No real problem there. I remember when reading about Snow having to go out to kill Mance what a suicide mission it was. Thorne and Slynt had him screwed. In the show him just choosing this as the best path shows how unprepared he is to be LC.
2539	robbyhouston	2014-06-15	In the books, he's prepared to go on a very risky ranging, until talked out of it. I think the mission makes sense, especially after losing the woman he loved.

It's tough because Noye was the leader of the battle for the Wall & died in the book. Yet Thorne remains unpopular, Slynt his buddy was a coward, Jon might still get LC wo it looking absurd. If they show a prev scene w Thorne abusing recruits ...

Â 
What's a better plan? Â They have no hope of help coming, they have maybe about 50-60 men left to fight (including the injured), they don't have time to seal the tunnel before the next assault begins, and with all of the Mammoths and Giants (who are able to shoot people off the top of the Wall), they have no real hope of defending the gate for more than one or two days.
Â 
He's not taking Ghost with him because he knows he's going to die and he doesn't want Ghost to die...he's not taking weapons with him because he's going to pretend to parley, and they would take his weapons from him before he ever got to Mance- he already stated he didn't want to lose Longclaw again. Â If he can kill Mance, however unlikely his chances at doing so, then the Wildlings would scatter, because he's the only one holding them all together. Â If he doesn't go, then everyone dies once the gate is broken and the Wildlings break through. Â Jon's plan may only give them a 1% chance of survival, but they have none if he doesn't go.
Â 
So really, for everyone who has criticized Jon's plan, what's a better one?

That's only a good plan if you know that Stannis-ex-machina is coming to their rescue otherwise it is just delaying the inevitable. I think the reason they changed it is because at this point it would just not be believable for Thorne/Slynt to be able to force Jon to go.
2553	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-06-15	Exactly Snow should stay and lead his men against impossible odds. Isn't that basically the job of the Night's Watch? When rangers go North of the wall isn't it a near suicide mission from the get go? Whoever leads each ranging north is always in this position. They still have to maintain leadership over their men.

Â 
How did Jon prove his leadership in the books?
Â 
Oh, that's right, he didn't. Â He was inexplicably given command of the Wall shortly after coming back from the enemy's camp all while being very badly injured and unable to walk. Â Then he was thrown into the ice cells to die by the leaders of the NW, only then to be sent on a suicide mission against his will when Maester Aemon wouldn't allow the leaders to kill him outright.
Â 
Then Stannis swoops in and saves everyone; and everyone, despite the fact that Jon was never given any sort of trial to prove his innocence, and despite the fact that there were people who still thought he was a traitor, elect him by over a 2/3rds majority as their new leader over much more qualified, older men who didn't have any blemishes on their resumA©s.
Â 
So yeah, tell me how scenes like Jon standing trial (and being exonerated), teaching others how to fight the Wildlings, volunteering to lead a dangerous mission to take care of the mutineers who killed the previous LC, taking command of the Wall when it was abandoned by his superior officer, going down to lead the fight below after his other superior officer fell, and then deciding to go on a kamikaze mission as a last ditch effort to save the NW, do less to prove Jon's leadership abilities than how it was done in the books.
Â 
I love those chapters in the book- in fact, they are the chapters I tend to reread most because I like them so much. Â But I'm not blind to the fact that Martin made Jon LC simply because he needed him to be LC- and despite the fact that it really didn't make much sense for Jon to be elected like he was so soon after he came back from enemy territory. Â I think the show did a much more believable progression of events, and while the execution may not have always been top notch, it's very, very plain for anyone to see that Jon is LC material.

It wasn't that inexplicable given the state of the NW, which Martin had well established was not good and populated with petty grievances at the top, like between Cotter Pyke & Bowen Marsh and between Ser Alliser & almost everyone.
You make good points regarding Jon showing leadership qualities in the show but you're wrong to suggest that it didn't make sense in the book. Most people are reasonably convinced of Jon's innocence through the fact that he warned them of the impending attack and led the Watch in defending the wall against said attack. The only reason it persists is because of Thorne and Slynt.

I don't like the decisions to kill off Pyp and Grenn, although Grenn's death was badass to the core.

Â 
I thought they ended it correctly. Â Adding Stannis completely undermines the point of the episode, which is that these men are alone and desperate, with no hope of any help- yet they fight bravely and valiantly, even though they have nothing to gain from it. Â Stannis didn't need to be there, and I'm glad they made the choice they did to end it where they did.

2561	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-21	They still did all that even with Stannis showing up. Them waiting a week to show them saving the NWs ass 10 minutes after Jon left the gate didn't do anything but suffocate 4.10.

Â 
No, it didn't. Â Even in the books, Stannis doesn't show up immediately. Â It takes him what, 4 chapters? Â But sure, let's cram all that in episode 4.9 where it doesn't fit thematically or dramatically because some people want it that way.
2563	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-22	We'll just putting a calendar week between show events didn't give the illusion of 4 chapters either. The battle was also longer than one night. It would have made 4.9 a full hour and gave them space in 4.10 to actually show characters working towards events instead of event, event, event, event, event, event....credits.

Â 
Spread it out longer than one night and then you can't have an entire episode dedicated to it because other things are happening.
Â 
But in any case, it still doesn't change the fact that the themes for both episodes worked better with the ending the way it was.
2565	White Harbors Wrath	2014-06-22	To each their own I guess. But the uncharacteristically low ratings for 4.10 on the ratings thread speaks volumes.
2566	sj4iy	2014-06-22	To each their own I guess. But the uncharacteristically low ratings for 4.10 on the ratings thread speaks volumes.


Â 
These ratings threads mean shit, to be honest. Â People can choose any number they want without any real system. Â Leaving out LS at the end shouldn't have been enough justification for giving the show a 1, but people did it anyway. Â Some people gave it a low rating simply because they didn't like that Brienne beat the Hound. Â I mean, it's ridiculous.
Â 
Critically, the episode was very well received. Â It was a great endcap for the first half of the story, while setting up the second half. Â It did exactly what it was supposed to.

Â It is known...Â
2568	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-06-08	Since there were less lines in this episode than kills.....I say we talk about the best of both. 
I liked "You can imagine all sorts of horrors that may have befallen that girl and her baby, but you can't imagine that an old man was once, more or less, like you?"
and Sam's headshot to the Thenn was pretty cool.

Hammer head. lol 
Was hoping Pyp would take at least two out before his fall. 
They should've shown Ghost going with Jon to meet Mance. Just sayin'.

Â 
Tormund: "this is how a man ends!" (kills nobody)
2581	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-06-08	I also was fond of the mammoth stepping on and crushing a wildling, and dragging another one on fire behind it.

Another Sam quote. He was on a role this episode.
2593	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-09	The kid's nod after he saved Jon. Badass.
Grenn saying the vows and goin' down like a badass.

2597	Muggle	2014-06-09	Sam took the show for me.Â  He had so many good lines.Â Â  One not mentioned yet is.Â 
Â 
PypÂ  "I Got one!"
Â 
Sam "Is it Over?"
Â 
Pyp "No"
Â 
SamÂ  "Keep on firing then"Â 
Â 
Â 
Or some thing to that effect.Â 
Â 
Sam was on fire
2598	Dirk blitzen	2014-06-09	"pyp, open the fucking gate" or something like that from Sam.
"with me now, now with me" from Thorne.
That little kids head nod.  Im positive he killed more wildlings with that nod than with that bow.  The nod that saved the wall.  Beware nods in the dark.  When you play the game of thrones you nod or you die.  Edd, Fetch me a nod.  I'm done.
2599	Newstar	2014-06-09	Meat cleaver kill, for sure. That was awesome. Also loved the mammoth stomping on some wildling, and the scythe.
Â 
Ollie's solemn, proud "You're welcome" nod to Jon Snow after killing the woman Jon loved was probably the funniest thing I've seen this season, except possibly for Sweetrobin tossing the toy bird out the Moon Door. So awesome.
2600	Emperoreddy	2014-06-09	Meat cleaver kill, for sure. That was awesome. Also loved the mammoth stomping on some wildling, and the scythe.

Â 
Man loved every moment of the episode. REALLY big fan of Sam, he stole the damn show. Jon was awesome. The anchor was crazy. BLOODY GIANTS RIDING MAMMOTHS!!!
2601	QorihnHalfFoot	2014-06-09	that scene ,over the shoulder Ygritte, dodging fire arrows while firing arrows during the charge was awesome. I've never seen that in a show.

Bonus points to Maester Aemon arguing with Sam - "YES, you DO!!"

2606	Shellysa Tyrell	2014-06-09	"You never fucked a bear" had me crying I was laughing so hard.
Â 
Surprisingly, this was probably one of the funniest episodes in the show's history
2607	Rhaquentis	2014-06-09	Lines: Â Alliser's speech, Grenn's vow.
Kills: Â  Â The giant arrow kill. The cook and his cleaver (how badass was that guy, even in his few seconds of screentime? I suggest he is recast or give the man more time next season!  )
I would have also liked to see Grenn and his men fight the giant though.
2608	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-09	"I don't want to hear about the bear you didn't fuck" - Ygritte
Â 
I loved the callback to Tormund's bear fucking story, even though with eight minutes on the clock they should have done it more justice. I don't think my friends understood.
2609	Sigrunn	2014-06-09	I liked the giant scythe as well but I can't stop wondering whether the Night's Watch truly has the possibility to build something like that.
2610	Koi No Yokan	2014-06-09	"Open the fucking gate, Pyp!"
Â 
Everything Thorne said was gold, though.Â
2611	avernite	2014-06-09	I liked the giant scythe as well but I can't stop wondering whether the Night's Watch truly has the possibility to build something like that.


They had centuries to do it 
Â 
As for me, I think the best kill was probably the suicide-by-oil. I mean, smart fellas 
Â 
And the best fight was the one we didn't see. The show really has a penchant for making lame-ish words turn into battlecries (Robb's Winter is Coming, the NW oath now).
2612	igrewupinKL	2014-06-09	Aliser by far had the best lines
Â 
"does hold mean loose ya cunts?"
2613	Cake	2014-06-09	"The wall is yours, Dolorous Edd" - Jon SnowÂ 
Â 
Or it would have been the best line if it appeared
2614	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Sam: What was she like?
Jon: She ... she had red hair.
Sam: Oh? How big were her feet?
Â 
Dwl


 Â Sam stole the episode imo.
Â 
I also liked his exchange with Pyp at the gate,
Â 
Sam ~ "Pyp open the gate"
Â 
Pyp ~ "I can't, Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate"
Â 
Sam~ Â "Open the fucking gate"
Â 
Pyp ~ "I never heard you curse before"
Â 
Sam ~ " Yes, well best get used to it"Â
2615	The Lord of Cinder	2014-06-09	Now that I think about it, this episode was full of amazing moments. And even though there wasn't much dialogue, most of it was golden. Like Sam speaking about how he managed to kill the White Walker, Ygritte's last words, Grenn rallying the other ones in the face of certain death, Alliser's speech etc. I feel Alliser and Sam were the standout characters of this episode. Sorry, Jon.
Â 
As for kills, there certainly were many great ones. Jon getting the anvil and Styr getting the hammer was a nice one. The giant's arrow was visually pleasing. But that scythe, man, that was cool and unexpected.
Â 
And everything Dolorous Edd says is pure gold.
2616	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Favorite kill had to be the giant archer, that shit was crazy!
2617	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-09	Best kill has to go to that Giant with the ginormous bow and arrow, which resembled a spear. Im surprised that crow didn't go flying all the way across to Kings Landing with that shot!
2618	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	"Castle Black will stand"
Â 
Alliser really took the spotlight this episode. Even Edd sounded heroic.Â
2619	GHOSTSTARK	2014-06-09	all of Thornes lines. Sam was on a roll with them too
2620	Plume	2014-06-09	Alliser Thorne was just awesome, all his lines were just golden

Hon mention: Pyp and hammerhead thenn (all i thought as the hammer hit the thenn was "stop, hammer time" Yeahh i like to think of bad puns as they die)
Â

Best line:

Anything from allister thorne and dol edd
The beginning of tormunds bear story (that was shamelessly cut off)Â 
Hon mention: Janos slynts fear induced ramblings (LOVED seeing him so craven)

2628	Rockroi	2014-06-09	Best LInes:
Â 
All in all, I thought the episode was only "average" for memorable lines, but most belonged to Thorne who had a great rhythm ("Does 'Notch' mean 'Draw?'" and "Do you want to be in the belly of a giant tonight?"). Â I also liked his speech to Jon Snow and how he warned him about second guessing. Â 
Â 
But I thought Sam's lines were great, most notably when Jon says "I'm not a poet!" Â Sam replies (accurately): "You're right, you aren't a poet." Â  Â 
Â 
There was also a GREAT bait-and-switch line where Sam promises Gilly he won't die, and thus makes you think he was ABSOLUTELY going to die. Â I like that the show teased us that way... and somehow made Sam true to his word. Â 
Â 
Best scene:
Â 
Allistere Thorne v. Thormon Giantsbane: Two dramatically different men came together in a fight-scene that rivalsed any other battle-fight so far. Â An edgy, fast, gritty scene that was fought to a standstill. Â There was a lot of drama in such a short scene. Â I also liked how Giantsbane's viciousness was offset by THorne's determination and that seemed very true to the spirit of both characters. Â
2629	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Grenns oath. Kinda hammy but still perfect.
Tormund bout to tell his bear story. Curse ye Ygritte for cutting him off


I must be the only one that thought Ygritte telling Tormund to shut the fuck up was hilarious.Â 
Â 
Â "I know you never fucked a bear, you know you never fucked a bear, right know I don't want to think about the bear you never fucked"Â  
Â 
Ygritte was all business! Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.Â
2630	lostinwesteros	2014-06-09	Best kills for me:
The giant scythe !!! 5 stars. 
Jon's ax buried in Styrr's head !!! Another 5 stars
Thorne and Tormund
And little Olly
Sam with the crossbow, and his look of surprise when he actually killed a wilding - obviously his return to being 'nothing' and . . . speaking of which, it just struck me that that perhaps  foreshadows Arya becoming 'no one' in THOBAW.
2631	Lord Martin	2014-06-09	"Fight them Olly. Â Find your weapon and fight them!"
2632	teej6	2014-06-09	I need him more than I need you.

Â 
Grenn was one of my favorites of the nw, behind Dolorous Edd. Seeing both him and Pyp die was heartbreaking.
2634	Batman	2014-06-09	I loved how cooly Jon shot Tormund at the end. Completely nonplussed, I liked that. Not a kill but still cool.

Over 12 hours later and I still can't get the Thenn theme music out of my head.
2637	The ~ Red ~ Viper	2014-06-09	Best line a slice of ginger minge. Best kill Jon killing styr with the hammer, and that arrow from the giant when the guy fell on the spike
2638	BarriStannis	2014-06-09	"You have the Wall, Edd" and all of Edd's lines after that were badass.Â 
Â 
Really liked Sam's lines, especially his "Well, I guess I'm not nothing anymore"Â 
Â 
Ygritte's "You know nothing, Jon Snow" death scene was perfect. Gotta love Olly's awesome nod to Jon after he shot Ygritte.
Â 
Best deaths, probably Jon's hammertime, the giant scythe, Sam killing a Thenn, and of course the giant knocking that one guy out of the park.Â
2639	Tyrion4President	2014-06-09	Pyp: I got one!

Â 
Tormund: "this is how a man ends!" (kills nobody)

Olly(the kid) killedÂ Â  Ygritte
Karma for her murdering his parents


Â 
Â 
Oh, yeah, I forgotÂ  ...Â Â
2641	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-09	best combat stuff:
Â 
Alliser Thorne and Tormund Giantbane were surprisingly badass in this episode. The fight between them was probably the best individual one of the night.
Â 
Jon Snow / Styr's anvil & hammer routine was interesting. (Is Snow always lucky, though?)
Â 
Sam the Slayer killing that Thenn at point-blank range.
Â 
The giant firing that huge arrow from that huge bow. Damn !
Â 
The Scythe (The Windshield Wiper) - double damn !
Â 
Mammoth panic ---> squashed wildling (hilarious)
Â 
Â 
Â 
Best lines of the night seemed to belong to either Alliser Thorne or Sam the Slayer. On the wilding side, Tormund.
Â 
Â 
Also, I'd like to make some mention of Janos Slynt's sequence on top of the wall, for his "There's no such thing as giants!" He can see they're right there (now does one not?) but his brain just refuses to acknowledge it. Total panic mode, totally useless.
And then another good line follows when they just lie to him and tell him he's been asked for down below.

I can't agree more. I loved that fight.

2645	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-06-09	Best LInes:
Â 
All in all, I thought the episode was only "average" for memorable lines, but most belonged to Thorne who had a great rhythm ("Does 'Notch' mean 'Draw?'" and "Do you want to be in the belly of a giant tonight?"). Â I also liked his speech to Jon Snow and how he warned him about second guessing. Â 
Â 
But I thought Sam's lines were great, most notably when Jon says "I'm not a poet!" Â Sam replies (accurately): "You're right, you aren't a poet." Â  Â 
Â 
There was also a GREAT bait-and-switch line where Sam promises Gilly he won't die, and thus makes you think he was ABSOLUTELY going to die. Â I like that the show teased us that way... and somehow made Sam true to his word. Â 
Â 
Best scene:
Â 
Allistere Thorne v. Thormon Giantsbane: Two dramatically different men came together in a fight-scene that rivalsed any other battle-fight so far. Â An edgy, fast, gritty scene that was fought to a standstill. Â There was a lot of drama in such a short scene. Â I also liked how Giantsbane's viciousness was offset by THorne's determination and that seemed very true to the spirit of both characters. Â 


Â 
That fight was a highlight for me. As awful as Thorne has been to Jon, he's still a veteran of the Night's Watch, and believes firmly in his cause. You've got to respect someone who sees the biggest, baddest dude on the battlefield and runs toward him. Hell yeah.
2646	Hodor of House Hodor	2014-06-09	Best line a slice of ginger minge. Best kill Jon killing styr with the hammer, and that arrow from the giant when the guy fell on the spike


Â 
That's no spike. That was the arrow itself wedged in him and stuck him to the ground.

I agree, if not the best then certainly quite memorable. I'm glad they showed Ser Alliser having the vastly superior sword-fighting skills that a genuine knight would have over commoners (which is what most of the Crows are, and the wildlings for that matter). There just isn't any comparison in terms of sword-fighting skills between an even strong and quick commoner and an otherwise healthy armored knight -- they're simply miles apart.

2648	Skore	2014-06-09	I loved the Giant's arrow kill! It made me say "whoah!" out loud, and it was like a Fatality from Mortal Kombat the way you followed the guy all the way down to his bone crushing end.
Â 
Lines, I don't know what they fed Sam this week but I loved just about everything he said in this episode.
Â 
Also, Thorne - never thought they could make him likable but seeing him in action gave me a new respect for the man even if he is a cunt.
Â 
Pyp and Grenn's deaths got me in the feels but Pyp's was the worst because you just had that little positive moment where he finally hits someone then BAM, arrow through his neck. Grenn's death was more of a slow, "oh man he didn't make it" feel to it that was really bittersweet after he and his 5 buddies manage to keep the giant from breaching the Gate.

Â 
"Put him in chains." Â  Jon locking up Tormmund Thunderfist
Â 
"Where's Stannis?" Â Me to HBO after the episode . .Â
2650	Bronn Urgundy	2014-06-09	Alisser Thorne
2651	ShaggyHound	2014-06-09	I actually liked a lotta lines in this episode. Thorne and Sam were the champions of badass shouts and funny quips respectfully and Ygritte being filled to the rim with piss and vinegar was also great. Jon calling for the arrival of Ghost "i need him more than i need you" was perhaps my personal favorite but the man of the match for me was Grenn. Thorne and Tormund are veterans,Â of course they are badass (even if they both outdid themselves) and SamÂ did surprisinglyÂ well now he's caried by the power of love, but Grenn was the man for me. Acknowledging Slynt as bad commander and sending him off, fighting the good fight, feeling the importance of certain orders and inspiring courage in the folks around him. He died a badass and probably had the best kill of the episode. Too bad we didn't see it. What we did see was his vows and for me that was the best line of the episode. Hands down.
Â 
The giant wielding that houwitzer-bow made for the best kill.
2652	TheGreenBell	2014-06-09	I also liked when Sam released Ghost and watching him rip that guy's throat.. wooooooo go Ghost!
2653	Mulled Wino	2014-06-09	there were none

Sam- "How big were her feet?"

The interaction between Sam and Pyp (before he dies).
Â 
The badass-
Â 
Grenn- "The Gods aren't here. The six of us are" (the whole reciting Vow scene was amazing)
Â 
Ed- "Lets enjoy our last night. LIGHT THE F*CKERS UP!" 
Â 
Thorne- "Do you want to fillÂ the belly of a ThennÂ tonight?" speech. There isÂ nothing like the threat of cannibalism to inspire!
Â 
Sam- " Pyp, open the F*CKING gate!"Â 
Â 
The wise-
Â 
Aemon- "Love is the death of duty"
Â 
Thorne talking about how a Commander can't afford to doubt himself.
Â 
Sam considering the wording of the NW oath. He has a point!
Â 
There were even romantic onesÂ with Sam/Gilly, Aemon and Jon/Ygritte.
Â 
Seriously, this episode was overflowing with good lines! How can anyone say there were none!?

2655	Left Wondering Whether	2014-06-09	I was definitely rooting for Alliser Thorne in an unexpected way.
Â 
I also felt like Jon spitting blood in Styr's face during their fight was reminiscent of the move that Karl Tanner pulled on him at Craster's. Like maybe there was a lesson in there about fighting with "honor" in the traditional sense vs. improvising in the trenches.Â
2656	greywindsrage	2014-06-09	"I need him more than I need you." or something like that.


Â
2657	Chuck88	2014-06-09	More about delivery than anything, but I loved Styr's super-dismissive "More words!" after Ygritte started mouthing off about killing Jon.Â 
Â
2658	sj4iy	2014-06-09	Best line is in my sig XD. But I also liked Aemon's line about seeing his lost love and how she was 'more real' than Sam.
Favorite death...that's HARD, lol.  Jon Snow was definitely badass if the night, and his takedown of Styr was perfect...but I also have to give props to Grenn for going down like he did, defending the gate.
2659	Mr Hodor	2014-06-09	The Giant's Missile. makes me wonder why didnt Mance have 20 giants shooting those goddamned arrows, blasting the NW halfway to winterhell.
Â 
The Chain Kill was awesome.
Â 
Best was the look on Pyp's eyes just when he go one of the wildlings.
2660	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-09	So hard to choose the best:
Â 
Sam was gold with everything that came out of his mouth. Favs were: "Open the f***ing gate Pyp!" and "That's what a man does"
Â 
Thorne redeemed himself with that fight with Tormund, along with his speech.Â 
Â 
The wildings and thenns around the fire waiting for the signal fire
Â 
Best laugh out loud moment: the mammoth with his ass on fire trampling everything in sight.Â 
Best crying moment: Grenn and company reciting the Oath as the waited for sudden death.Â 
Biggest WTF: Slynt "There are no giants," as the giants race to pull the gate open.
More deserved moment: Ygritte's death. And the nod from Olly to Jon was priceless. Karma isn't always a bitch, sometimes it a kid with a grudge.
Â 
I thought all the fight sequences were awesome, and Ghost just made the victory even sweeter. I wasn't upset with Stannis not arriving yet, but I know some people are really hot about it. I will say that was the fastest hour of GoT to date. It sucks the season finale is almost here, but man - these past two episodes have been pure awesomeness.Â 
Â 
And Oh yeah - "You know nothing Jon Snow" Â
2661	Valyrian_princess	2014-06-09	Grenn and the other five brothers reciting their vows as the giant charges towards them
Open the f*cking gate Pyp
I need him more than I need you
You have the wall, Edd
Aye, you should have
Thorne's battle cry speech
2662	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-06-10	Best kill - how can there be a doubt? Â After swaggering, gloating, and eating his way across the North, Styr got a hammer in the skull.
Â 
But so many amazing moments - the Scythe was awesome, and the nuclear giant arrow strike, and the Ghost kill were all beautiful.
Â 
Great script - very underrated for this episode.
Thorne: "Do you plan to die today?" "No!" "That's very good to hear!"
"Does nock mean draw?"
Â 
And of course, all of Sam's moments. Â It was really his show.

2663	joachim	2014-06-10	I'd dearly love to find a way to insert the phrase "ginger minge" into a conversation. And I loved when the giant shot that one guy off of the wall.
2664	rmholt	2014-06-10	"
Â 
Tormund: "this is how a man ends!" (kills nobody)

Yeah, confusing!
2665	Buckwheat	2014-06-10	Sammy: Open the f****g gate!
Pyp: I have never heard you swear.
Sammy: Well get used to it!
Â 
Because Sammy.
2666	SlowLoras	2014-06-10	The look Olly gave Jon after he shot Ygritte. And the look Jon gave him back.
Â 
Other than that, everything that came out of Edd's mouth.
2667	Michael Herman	2014-06-10	Best kills:
Giant archer: visually tasty
Three finger hobb FINALLY introduced and as a badass to boot! casually walking out the kitchens to lay waste to wildings with his god damn meat cleaver!
Grenn and his fellow 5 nights watchmen vs Mag the mighty
The anchor scythe
Hon mention: Pyp and hammerhead thenn (all i thought as the hammer hit the thenn was "stop, hammer time" Yeahh i like to think of bad puns as they die)


Well why do you think Stannis saw him as Lord Commander material?
2668	Jay Stark	2014-06-10	Well why do you think Stannis saw him as Lord Commander material?


True, True. At least if Hobb stays in the show now he can have a little more recognition, as in the books he only kept the garrison fed, whereas in the show he was a bamf nonchalantly killing wildings
2669	sj4iy	2014-06-10	Yeah, confusing!

It didn't mean that he was going to kill anyone, it meant that Tormund was going to die fighting.  He meant his own end, not that he would end others.
2670	sarah.jenice	2014-06-10	It didn't mean that he was going to kill anyone, it meant that Tormund was going to die fighting. He meant his own end, not that he would end others.


I agree.
Â 
I've been wondering all season what they were going to do with Tormund being on the wrong side of the Wall. I guess they'll just keep him captive and use him to negotiate the wildlings' surrender/peaceful walk through the Wall.
Â 
Sam was great and surprisingly so was Thorne.
Â 
I loved the giant with the arrow.
2671	Ser Pearce	2014-06-10	Dolourous Edd: Light the Fuckers up!
Â 
Also Alliser Thorne throughout the episode. While it is cheesy, I am a sucker for a good speech. And his kills were cool, plus the fight with Tormund.
2672	dbunting	2014-06-10	Too many to mention them all.Sam, "open the FUCKING gate!!!!"...Pyp pissed himself a little I think!Sam, to Pyp after he finally killed someone, "well is it over?..No...well then get back to it!Almost everything Thorne said and did in this episode. Especially, we are not going to die today Lord Snow. You can go on hating me and I can go on wishing your wildling bitch killed you. Like a Boss.As if that wasn't enough, Thorne sees Tormund and recognizes he is the baddest kid on the playground and he goes right for him, total bad ass move.Giant with the arrow was amazing, loved it as much as the scythe.Have to admit I was wondering who Jon was sending Sam to get, I didn't even think about Ghost. Loved seeing him in action.Giants riding mammoths into battle, can't stay much truer to the books can you!
2673	sj4iy	2014-06-10	I have to say it's ironic that some people think that the dialogue was the weak part of the episode, yet we have pages and pages of awesome quotes XD Â Maybe they aren't that original, but god, were they great.

					
					
							Edited by sj4iy, 10 June 2014 - 12:47 PM.
2674	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-10	Thorne and the actor portraying him stole the show. His line delivery was amazing, just really had the presence of an asshole who can shame you into working harder. I also loved that he's obviously 50+ in the show against a Tormund that looks closer to his thirties, he did pretty freaking well for a man of his age, something I wish they would use Selmy for more often (Though the actor for Selmy doesn't seem to be in the same shape and is much older) and from seeing Stannis running people through. Some of the old dogs still have it!Â 
Â 
I PROMISE YOU, WHEN THE NIGHT ENDS, CASTLE BLACK WILL NOT FALL! WITH ME AT THEM! AT THEM WITH ME!
2675	Bridgeburners	2014-06-10	I definitely loved Grenn and the bunch defending the gate. I always liked Grenn and, even though he was killed prematurely in the show, this is doing him a greater honour than the books do. From the whole series, I always maintained that Donal Noye (a one-armed blacksmith in the books who turned out to singlehandedly stop Mag Mar, best warrior of all the giants, in the tunnel, and died along with him) was the bravest character in the entire book series. Sure, you have people brave in less superficial ways like Dany, Sansa, Davos, etc... but no fucking way would any of them singlehandedly face the king of giants with one arm in a crowded tunnel.
Â 
Anyway, they gave that honour to Grenn (which wasn't as much of an honour considering he had four guys backing him up, has both of his arms, and faced just some random giant rather than Mag Mar, king of the giants) which is cool (and a hell of a lot more realistic BTW). When you think about it, Oberyn's challenge pales in comparison to Grenn's.
Â 
It did throw me off, though. I was completely expecting Donal Noye's role to be replaced by the leader of the builders who, in episode 7, was asked to give the final ruling on whether or not the tunnel should be blocked, and looking nervous (not wanting to displease Alliser Thorne), said "no". I thought he was going to feel overwhelmingly guilty for his call, to the point that he would take the stance on his own. Plus he kinda reminded me of Noye.

'I said nock and hold, you cunts! Does nock mean draw? Does fucking hold mean fucking drop? You all plan to die here tonight? That's very good to hear! Draw!' ... 'What are you fucking waiting for? LOOSE!'
Â 
Grenn reciting the Night's Watch vows gave me goosebumps, really well done.
Â 
Still sad Tormund didn't get to tell his story about fucking a bear though - now that would've provided us with some epic quotes
2679	sj4iy	2014-06-10	I loved Alliser Thorne this episode.Â 'I said nock and hold, you cunts! Does nock mean draw? Does fucking hold mean fucking drop? You all plan to die here tonight?

I also noticed Jon saying "let it end" to Tormund, which served as a nice little reminder (deliberate or not) of Catelyn in E09 last year.
2687	themostleastlikelyto	2014-06-11	"pyp, open the fucking gate" or something like that from Sam.
"with me now, now with me" from Thorne.
That little kids head nod. Im positive he killed more wildlings with that nod than with that bow. The nod that saved the wall. Beware nods in the dark. When you play the game of thrones you nod or you die. Edd, Fetch me a nod. I'm done.

Then there was Arya's lines to the Lannister Soldier she stabs in the throat and lastly Dany and Sir Barristans conversation about Mercy. Thsoe were my favorite Entire series lines but in this episode was Sam saying It doesn't say we can't have sex just father no children stuff. Also I liked the Line John Snow saying yes you should have to Turmond about The Wall buisness.

Â 
"It was a difficult decision either way."
Â 
Thorne conceding "Lord Snow" knows what he's talking about and Jon taking the high road in response.Â  I am so down with Thorne and Jon forging respect if not like in this canonical go-round and was really jazzed to see it really start to happen.Â  For however long or short it may actually last.
Â 
Also basically everything else Thorne said throughout the night.
Â 
And Jon's second "...Hold The Gate" to Grenn, because he totally knows he's sending Grenn off to die.Â  And that he has to do it anyway.
Â 


"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth."
Â 


Â 
"But if he second guesses himself, it's all over.Â  For him, for the clever little twat, for everyone.Â  But This Is Not The End. "
Â 
Man that exchange is going to be so awesome in the future when their positions are reversed and it's Jon giving the orders.Â  Thorne second guessing him and Jon reminding him of what he said leadership is.Â  Gonna be looking forward to that all through season 5.
Â 
Also,
Â 
"Might as well enjoy our last night, eh boys?Â  LIGHT THOSE FUCKERS UP!"Â Â  Fucking love Edd stepping up and rising to the occasion.Â  Would Make A Terrible Lord Commander MY ASS; Edd is born to it.Â  Slightly less awesome but much more Edd-like was his final "Don't cheer too loud boys, they still outnumber us 1000 to 1."

"Those are Thenns at our wall. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight?"Â 
Â 
"NO!!"
Â 
"Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you Castle Black will stand. The Night's Watch will STAND!!"
Â 
"With me now...NOW WITH ME!!"

As for kills - not actually a kill, but it could have been - The Thenn (is he actually called Styr in the show, or is he just a Styr proxy?) could have killed Jon easily by smashing his head against the anvil repeatedly - instead he's like 'right, only need to do that once, now I'm gonna chuck you through the fire - not in it, mind, just through it. Now that you're right by the fire, I'll pick you up, but instead of holding you down in the flames, I'll just look at you a bit, giving you just enough time to grab a hammer and...'

As I watched, seeing the wildlings' arrows falling pitifully short was an interesting moment - I sort of nodded and thought "well, of course", and then the giant steps up with his bow and "What's he... Oh... OH F**K !" That was even before he shot - once he did, I have to say I had that sort of graveyard laughter as well.

I caught Three Fingered Hobb's brief cameo whilst defending the kitchen too.  So much awesome.  He was only outdone by Olly feathering Ygritte and nodding over to Jon like "no problem brah".    
I was hoping to hear Pyp make some crack about breakfast arrows but we all know how that went.  
Grenn reciting the Night's Watch vows and rallying the troops to hold the inner gate was very inspiring and a thrill to watch.

In books, it doesn't.
Â 
For instance, Aemon left home to be a maester quite young.
Â 
In shows, who knows. There is no Jaehaerys there, Aegon is father of Aerys, so, age might fit.

Â 
Aemon, likely. But we know from TWOIAF that Lady Olenna was supposed to marry Daeron Targaryen (Aegon V's youngest son), whom it is implied was quite like Loras in his personal life. ;-)
But since the show either:
A] got rid of a generation of Targaryens
B] simply made Aerys a generation older than he was supposed to
C] didn't give a flying f*** about consistency (like most TV shows are notorious for)
Â 
This can be disputed in the show.
2729	ambi76	2014-11-30	I'm sorry but Aemon/Olenna doesn't make the least bit of sense on the show either. Aemon remembers "this girl" quite fondly. Olenna bitches her ass off about the ludicrous Targaryen. And their ages don't really fit either. Even on the show there should be at least 15 years (75/90, in the books they are even 30 years apart exactly, 198AL & 228AL) between them. This fan theory comes out of nowhere or rather from "Oh, look, two old people! They must have obviously fucked at one point."

2730	imp-ty	2014-12-08	So I just rewatched the episode. Aemon mentions that "some women were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections... one succeeded"
The ages from the wiki indicate that he didn't go to the wall unttil he was an adult. A child from the actions of forward women would be around 80, but the idea of additional unknown king's blood running around is interesting. I don't remember a similar conversation from the books, so it may be nothing.

2732	AdmiralKyrd	2014-12-10	I'm sorry but Aemon/Olenna doesn't make the least bit of sense on the show either. Aemon remembers "this girl" quite fondly.

Â 
Meh, its more than just that:
Â Olenna
- Mentioned being promised to a Targaryen, of which in the show there are only a handful of people suitable we're aware of who might possibly fit: Aerion (mentioned in histories and lore), Aemon, Aegon V, Aerys II, and Dunk
- Was known to be special in luring men
- Spoke of the Targaryen she was promised to with disdain, yet describing him in detail, saying he had a "little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair." When she saw him, she said he "wouldn't do," so she married Luthor, who she described as an "oaf" and a "great doughy lump."
- Says Margaery is even better than she was then.
Â Aemon
- Said he had many women after him, one managed to win his affections, and said he was in love.
Â 
These raise a few questions:
Â 
1. Why would Olenna forgo her Targaryen intended for a less powerful man, who doesn't seem to be physically anything special either?
2. Why does Olenna say/know Margaery is even better at winning men's affections than her?
3. Why did she abruptly go for Luthor, the night before he was supposed to propose to her sister? Why didn't she do this before? Why did she wait til the last minute?
4. What happened with Aemon and the girl he loved?
Â 
This is where this theory comes from, because in context, Olenna's story seems a little... odd. So what may have actually happened? Just for theories' sake...
Â 
Â 
Aemon was an eligible Targaryen and Olenna was one of many girls that was rather taken with him. She pursued him and eventually won his affections and they were intended to be wed. They were in love, but for one reason or another, Aemon wanted to become a maester and went to the Citadel. Maybe Aemon thought Olenna really just liked him for his lineage, and didn't really, truly love him. Olenna was heartbroken and waited for the chance that maybe he would come back to her, but he never did. Eventually, knowing that Luthor was going to propose to her sister and she couldn't wait for Aemon any longer, she snuck into Luthor's bed and went for the next best thing. Thus, she became the Lady of Highgarden.
Â 
Years later, when recounting this tale to Margaery, she passes off her Targaryen as simply not being good enough for her - possibly because she's still hurt by it. Even so, she leaves telltale signs of remembrance and cloaked reverence by describing the way he looked. She also wants to boost Margaerys confidence at this time, not wanting to give her any ideas that she might fail with Tommen like she did with Aemon. She does mention one truth about it though. She knows Margaery is two for two with Renly and Joffrey, but she was one for two with Aemon and Luthor. Ergo, when she compares herself to Margaery, Olenna says that Margaery "is even better."
Â 
Â 
So, yeah, as far as their ages are concerned, its a bit of a stretch. However, I wouldn't put it past the show to go ahead and just ignore it for the purposes of storytelling if this is their angle. I'm not saying its true, but you can see how the pieces of the puzzle are possibly there if they want Aemon to tell a story about it in Season 5.

2734	Steelborn	2014-12-19	I'm not sure, we may be looking too much into things. Even that the show cut one generation of Targaryens, Aemon is still older than Aegon V who was the father of Aerys, so the age gap between him and Olenna is still big.
Â 
But, consistency isn't something the show is known for to be fair.

2738	Ghosts Lunch	2014-12-22	Reckon the show writer just threw that in there. Not sure it's part of the lore. If so probably someone from Oldtown, I don't seriously take any Olenna idea seriously, that seemed like like it was just thrown in as part of the whole "Margaery go insert yourself between Cersei and Tommen" plot
2739	Ghosts Lunch	2014-12-22	I'm not sure, we may be looking too much into things. Even that the show cut one generation of Targaryens, Aemon is still older than Aegon V who was the father of Aerys, so the age gap between him and Olenna is still big.

Lol, age didn't stop Jon Arryn being married to Lysa Tully
Between the whole mashed generations and "old loves/betrothed" lines  sounds like they are just throwing crap in there, I don't expect there to be any plot relevance to it outside of the Sam/Margaery issues at the time
2740	Steelborn	2014-12-22	Between the whole mashed generations and "old loves/betrothed" lines sounds like they are just throwing crap in there, I don't expect there to be any plot relevance to it outside of the Sam/Margaery issues at the time


Â 
What Sam issue?
2741	ambi76	2014-12-23	IMHO that Aemon love backstory was just invented to make it "oh so funny" that Sam is in denial about loving/wanting Gilly, Steelborn.
2742	Dronuspk	2015-02-22	I don't think it was Olenna lol. Everything pretty much has been named off though on why.
Â 
I took Olenna's story as possible bullshit she was feeding for manipulative purposes. She really comes off as ultimate manipulator to me, I love Diana Rigg.
2743	Stringer Bill	2014-06-21	Lots of slow motion shots of him and flames. It struck me as odd in this episode and the last with Melisandre , the flames and Jon. I hope I am wrong but it convinced me that they were foreshadowing it.
2744	Lord Defiance	2014-07-28	At the end shot with Jon and Ygritte, I believe it was more meant to show Ygritte, kissed by fire, and Jon, who was ice and snow.
It could be that this was a hint that he is AA, but nothing official.
I think more it was meant as an emotional tug at viewers, as it was a strong death scene at the end.
2745	The North	2014-12-03	I think it was a hint without actually being a "hint"...meaning it can either be an early reveal or meaningless gesture, depending how Martin's story pans out.
2746	Steelborn	2014-12-03	I believe these are only coincidental things.
2747	Faceless Man Friday	2014-12-04	I think it was a hint without actually being a "hint"...meaning it can either be an early reveal or meaningless gesture, depending how Martin's story pans out.


I agree. Â It is similar to the passages in the ADWD where Mel repeats on more than one occasion that she has seen Jon in her fires. Â It can be taken as foreshadowing that Jon is AA or it cannot.Â
2748	Snowisnobastard	2014-06-08	Grenn and pyp?  They're both still alive post adwd. Maybe d&d know that they get offed anyway and decided to just throw it in for more emotional impact
2749	Frumpus	2014-06-08	They had to kill them because they made the mistake of not including other recognizable Wall characters.
Â 
IMO this is why they should have made Locke switch allegiance to Jon. He could have easily died here instead of Grenn.

Â

Yeah but nobody would give a shit if Locke died. I think Grenn was pretty much a marked man since the first previews came out, possibly before. He went out in a great way. Pyp on the other hand didn't have to go at all. That was my only nit-pick with the episode besides the obvious one.Â
2751	Arkash	2014-06-08	I really think the show should cast one new brother of the Night's Watch who'll be the voice, face and blade of Jon's opposition next season and to make up to all those deaths.
2752	HouseHarrison	2014-06-08	Because D&D have noticed Grenn and Pyp don't really do anything important as of ADWD and needed people to kill off.

2754	IlAovatar	2014-06-08	I'm not too fussed. I never cared much for them as characters, and there was always a high possibility that D&D would decide to kill off non-important characters earlier than in the books.

2757	YourMomsBox	2014-06-08	I think in particular Grenn's death was a very heroic end and there's really nothing further down the line that could do the character anymore justice.

2762	HODOR! HODOR!!	2014-06-08	I think one of the reasons was so Jon doesn't really have anyone he can trust next season. Â It forces him into that situation, rather than having him send them away.
2763	roxWolfox	2014-06-08	During Pyp's death scene I actually grabbed my husband's hand 'cause I needed his support in case I had to endure Grenn's death scene.Â  I was spared the trauma, but still ...Â

I think Tormund will take the role of Val next season. Someone has to go and spread the word with the wildlings
2770	dtones520	2014-06-08	Two words, CASTING BUDGET. The series is only going to expand in cast going forward with the Martells, Jon Conn and crew, the Greyjoys (if included), etc. Grenn and Pyp have done nothing in the books so far other than support Jon and you can cast other random wall peeps down the road if needed. Plus they give the losses at the wall some emotional impact other than seeing 50 nameless extras get offed.

Â 
Yes it's casting budget, but it wasn't done because they had to save money. It was done because they didn't cast additional Wall characters in prior seasons (Donal Noye mainly).
2772	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-08	'Cause they're heartless bastards.
Â 
Nah, they had to give the NW some notable casualties. Grenn took Donal's place - which was badass, and Pyp's death showed that Sam's a changed man.
2773	Chunk88	2014-06-09	My girlfriend "who dies???"
Me "well...as far as the nights watch goes, none of them that are in the show..." 
Realized we were losing some of them then.
Also, I think it's safe to say - Olly is here to stay now. Jon's steward? That alone fills in the hole left by those two IMO

Three cheers for Grenn the Giant Slayer and Sharpeye Pyp!

2775	Dragonglass Order	2014-06-09	Once Pyp died, I knew Grenn was also a goner.
2776	Seneti	2014-06-09	I didn't mind their deaths; they were emotional and added to the tragic scale of the battle. Plus, they have little to no parts in future storylines. I only wish that their characters were built up a bit. My SO thought that Pyp's death was much sadder than Ygritte's.Â 


Â 
This. And they were not just killed for shock value. Both of their deaths had meaning (Grenn's more so then Pyp's).
Â 


I really was praying that they didn't kill tormund...I knew grenn was dead as son as jon said hold the tunnel no matter what. I'm assuming ions relationship with Ed will improve along with more face time with Sam.


Â 
I think Grenn and Jon knew it, too. That was great acting from both actors.
Â 


Felt like reading the Red Wedding all over again.Â This can't be happening. This can't be happening.Â 


Â 
Well, maybe this is D&D's answer to everybody saying that the RW had less impact because there were no named Stark banner men that died. "You want deaths of likable secondary characters? Here you go!"
2777	Newstar	2014-06-09	Â 
I think Tormund will take the role of Val next season. Someone has to go and spread the word with the wildlings


Â 
I thought Tormund might take the place of Sigorn in the Alys Karstark marriage subplot, although that seems like something that's likely to be cut.
2778	The Ghost of Rhaegar	2014-06-09	i kinda wish jon still had his boys with himâ<U+0080>¦ we'll need some new characters at the wall then?
2779	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-09	i kinda wish jon still had his boys with himâ<U+0080>¦ we'll need some new characters at the wall then?


Â 
There's no way they're adding any non-essentials to the Wall. They killed of the badass bros 'cause of budget cuts, so it'd be pointless to replace them with lesser characters.
Â 
But obviously they'll add the important ones and that might make up for it, depending on how it's played out.
2780	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-09	Jon sends all his friends away over the course of ADWD, so I've had Pyp & Grenn marked down as prime candidates for show deaths for a while.
2781	Rhaquentis	2014-06-09	Because next season is going to have a shitload of Dornish and Ironborn peeps
2782	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-06-09	I think it will add more gravitas to the daggers in the dark scene, as Jon will be more or less truly on his alone. I also think their deaths added an emotional weight to the battle, otherwise, it would have felt like the NW were kind of invulnerable.
Â 
Otherwise, Valar Morghulis.Â
2783	Koi No Yokan	2014-06-09	I actually liked that they died. Not that I dislike them. Still wish Donal was fighting the giant though.


Â 
Â 
Agreed. I like both Grenn and Pyp (book and show), but they're not essential moving forward. Thought their deaths were profound and added weight to the episode; I was quite saddened by them (and it seems Unsullied were, too)!
Â 
I love that Grenn took Donal's spot to fight "Mag". Noye was always a favourite minor character of mine in the books, but I'm happy that someone like Grenn took up the hammer for him.Â
2784	Trillian	2014-06-09	They needed what Donal Noye was for book readers, a decent man and a likeable characters that represents what a good sworn brother of the night watch should be (in opposition with rapists, murderers, dodgy characters and Janos Slynt).
Also,for as much as I like them, Pyp and Grenn won't have a key role in the next couple of books, therefore they were expendables.
2785	Sun	2014-06-09	Pyp's death was one of the best moments in the episode. I cried real tears. I loved it.Â
2786	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-09	Pyp might have been the saddest death of the season for me =( But yeah, the wall will have enough going on next year. Although I wonder how they're going to garrison the abandoned castles with so few recognizable characters
Â 
As long as Dolorous Edd survives the series, I'm happy

2787	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-06-09	LOL I never knew how many fans Pyp and Grenn had. I like that they died. Not that I hated their characters, but if it's a battle, you have to have major casualties. Pyp dying did make me sad, and Grenn replacing Donal Noye didn't annoy me at all. His death was very heroic. Why are people mad that they died? They don't do anything in aDwD, and I doubt that GRRM has any big plans for them, so it made sense to kill them. I think they want to make space for Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck next season.
2788	Nocturne	2014-06-09	Yeah but nobody would give a shit if Locke died. I think Grenn was pretty much a marked man since the first previews came out, possibly before. He went out in a great way. Pyp on the other hand didn't have to go at all. That was my only nit-pick with the episode besides the obvious one.Â 


Â 
Pyp wen't out in a typical anti-climatic GRRM fashion. Plus it wasn't really in his character to be a bad ass, he was a poet wasn't he not? Sad this two died, the 4 musketeers band is no longer now:(
2789	andrew_	2014-06-09	Their deaths were the only disappointing part this episode. They don't have a big part to play in the series to come from what we've read in the books, making them an easy choice to kill and as stated above the budget must of come into consideration especially with the expanded cast of next season. The screenwriters think the only way to make an emotional impact on the viewer is to kill off a character, it's really poor screenwriting to be honest.
Â 
We saw Pyp grow as a character in the space of the first part of the episode only for them to kill him off, the Grenn death was a bit more understandable but still, they could've introduced Donald Noye over the pas few weeks instead of the little boy who kills Ygritte, Colin. I'm gutted, especially because the actors who played both parts were brilliant in their roles  .

Imagine how awesome it would be if we would have gotten a reuniting between Stannis and him

Pyps death was so bad, i had a flashback to season 1 when he was put on the wall because he stole bread for his sister

2792	LordStoneheart	2014-06-09	I haven't been so sad about a death since Joffrey.
2793	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I thought they would die and wasn't wrong...and their deaths added a tragic impact that the books didn't have at all, which I liked.  If they were just going to leave the story by being sent away, anyway, better for them to die when it matters.
2794	Greywolf2375	2014-06-09	I didn't like seeing them die because I do enjoy their characters in both the books and the show, but the fact that Jon has lost his family and is now losing his brothers really hits home.Â  War is a contact sport, if it was just nameless Black Brothers dying it wouldn't have had the impact.Â  Pyp went out in the way many do - a random, nameless arrow that took you unaware.Â  Grenn got to go out likeÂ a hero, but is dead nonetheless.
2795	Fevre River Warrior	2014-06-09	That leaves Jon with only two close friends - Sam and Dolorous Ed. I did not expect Gren and Pyp to die. That was a shock to me.
Â 
It makes me wonder what that says about the future of the Night's Watch since HBO seems to indicate that there are a lot fewer of them left than the books did. I wonder what that will mean for the future of Jon Snow and Winterfell. This episode raised more questions than gave answers to me as an avid book reader and HBO show fan. I loved the episode though, it was fabulous.
2796	salmonsnake	2014-06-09	Grenn's was the only time a show death has made me feel sad.
2797	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-09	Although they are probably not essential characters, I can't believe they Grenn and Pyp got killed of this episode! (especially Grenn who had stood alongside Jon since Day 1 in the watch). I have to admit though, it would have been epic to actually see him and the other nights watch brothers fight Mag the Mighty, although it was a great way for him to be go out from the series. As someone mentioned before, I will be happy if Dolorous Edd survives this season and the next.
2798	echidna	2014-06-09	I would rather see the characters die dramatically and early in a battle than to not have them at all. We needed to care about someone who died, so it makes sense and leaves Jon with 2 Nights Watch buddies. 
It could just as easily be Maester Aemon.
I'm just glad they didn't decide to save CGI costs and kill off Ghost!!!

2801	RhaenysBalerion	2014-06-09	It was pretty pretty obvious that Pyp was gonna die from the moment the camera first showed him with shaking hands followed by that conversation about how the odds aren't in his favor. It was pretty realistic too.Â 
Â 
As for Grenn... that was pretty realistic too.Â

Both deaths were sad, but at least something happened in this damned episode...Â

i don't think any bookreader was shocked upon seeing grenn and the giant lying there dead.
pyp's death however, was much more powerfull.
2803	Aethermancer	2014-06-09	Also shocked how many people seemed to think Thorne died, when he was telling his men to fight a large stannis.


Â 
Well, ask any of the Stannis fans what would be the outcome of trying to fight a large Stannis.Â  Perfectly reasonable to assume that death is the outcome of that situation.
2804	GHOSTSTARK	2014-06-09	Dolorous Edd will definitly have a more expanded role next year. I'm really glad of this and loved him this episode.
Â 
But I am still so sad for Pyp.Â 
Â 
Grenn's death is heroic as hell !Â

Â 
He was there in spirit, in the form of a hammer.
2806	NomadicDirewolf	2014-06-09	tbh i'm okay with them killing pyp and grenn (and possibly ser Aliser) in aDwD they are still alive but Jon sent them to staff the rebuilt castles along the wall, so its doubtful they will have anymore significant role in the plot, and they dont really feature in Jons plot as well, so there deaths have very little if any impact on the plot of the books. Plus in the book battle, the only significant one to die was Donal Noye (and Ygritte) and obviously he wasnt there, so it felt more realistic for a few more characters to die in battle, especially since the show probably wouldnt have much use for those characters past this season anyway. I would prefer for Grenn to die fighting the giant, therefore keeping that part from the book, than have him survive
2807	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	I'm ok as long as Edd is alive.
2808	sj4iy	2014-06-09	i don't think any bookreader was shocked upon seeing grenn and the giant lying there dead.pyp's death however, was much more powerfull.Book readers, no. People who have never read the books? Yes. My MIL didn't see either of those deaths coming at all.

He has too considering all there is to come.I would bet anything that we see Jon and Tormund having talks while Tormund is recovering from his one billion arrow wounds XD I think Tormund will grow to respect Jon when he sees what kind of leader he is.
2810	Fool of a Book	2014-06-09	Since we really have only Dolorous Edd. Slynt, Thorne, Sam, Jon and Aemon left as familiar faces on the Wall, it makes room for Stannis and his retinue next season. Â I was also sad to see them go.

I thought they would die and wasn't wrong...and their deaths added a tragic impact that the books didn't have at all, which I liked. If they were just going to leave the story by being sent away, anyway, better for them to die when it matters.

True enough at least Ygritte got it I'm sorry I couldn't stand her in the books or in the show either.
2812	Nymeria's pup	2014-06-09	I understand (sort of) why they killed Pyp and Grenn, but did they both have to die? Still they died well, especially Grenn. At least I know they are still alive in the book world, that is the most important.
Â 
Thank the gods they had enough sense not to kill Dolorous Edd...that would have been too much!
Â 
Oh and it was quite obvious to me that Thorne is still alive, just wounded. His character still has a part to play.Â
2813	Ankou	2014-06-09	I suspect this means Grenn and Pyp die soon in the book, since they felt it made no difference. At least it was a heroic death for Grenn.Â
2814	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-06-09	I didn't mind to lose them, to be honest. Although I thought Green's death was BAMF. It was dramatic as well, with them reciting the Night Watch's Oath. I liked it.
2815	Lann Casterly	2014-06-09	I was more surprised by Pyp's death than Grenn's. Â I didn't see Pyp's coming. Â But without Noye, Grenn seemed likely to end up with his job down there, and I love that he went out like that.
2816	Manderly's Horse	2014-06-09	Does this mean that GRRM has given the show runners a time line for all character's death? Maybe even a rating on how important they might be in future books?

Exactly. Â Next season there should finally be room in the show for Stannis to be great. Â I'm looking forward to it. Â 
Â 
The Nights Watch will have 50 able bodied men left, at best, by the end of next episode. Â This will make them even more dependent on Stannis than in the book. Â The show is unlikely to show Stannis' military campaign against the Ironborne or to spend much time on Stannis rallying the North, so he will probably spend most of next season with Jon. Â Between Jon, Edd, Sam, Aemon, little kid, Slynt, Thorne, Gilly, Tormond, Mance, Stannis, Davos, Melisandre, Selyse, and Shireen, there will be ample named characters at the wall. Grenn and Pyp wouldn't have been more than glorified extras anyway - much better to kill them in this episode so that the battle had weight. Â I also like that Jon sent Grenn to his death; I think that was hanging over Jon when he decided to go on his suicide mission.
Â 
Further, I expect the show to play around with Sam's plot line to keep characters more connected and to keep the whole thing film-able. Â I thought Aemon might die in the battle for the Wall (especially when the wildlings were breaking into rooms!) and then the show could keep Sam and Gilly at the wall or could send them to Kings Landing or whatever. Â But I'm pretty sure the main point of Aemon's discussion with Sam was to emphasize that he has king's blood so they probably will go on a trip together. Â If they go to the maester school, I expect it to be in Bravos.

2825	Envie	2014-06-09	Nothing about the show surprises me anymore. In fact, it's kind of depressing now. I used to really defend the show writer's choices to off characters that are still living in the books, but I'm starting to run out of defense steam.
Â 
It's not like Grenn or Pyp have life altering plot necessity in the last book, but they were Jon's support network and killing them before Jon's even elected to Lord Commander seems disjointed and nonsensical. I know they did it for the emotional effect of the battle - to give it heavier weight because we don't have many NW men we can identify with who aren't key roles like Sam and Jon, but still - I'm not convinced it was necessary. I'm just getting somewhat desensitized to it and that itself can't be a good thing. The show's lost some luster this season for me. I'm not even sure it's to do with the veering off book course or not. It seems to be an overall apathy for me. There have been some really killer / great scenes this season so it's not because the season has been boring. I can't really put a finger on it. Just. Slumping.
2826	King Tyrion I	2014-06-09	So sad Pyp and Grenn died, but thought it might happen. Was worried they were going to kill off Tormund as well.


Â 
Indeed. I agree with you.
2827	Seneti	2014-06-09	I love that Grenn took Donal's spot to fight "Mag". Noye was always a favourite minor character of mine in the books, but I'm happy that someone like Grenn took up the hammer for him.Â 


Â 
I see what you did there...  But I agree: Noye was awesome and one of the few minor characters in the books whose death made me cry. Grenn and co. facing the giant has now become my favorite moment of that episode, particularly since it was very clear from the conversation between Jon an Grenn that Grenn knew this was a suicide mission and yet he still accepted without a single word of complaint.
Â 


i understand using grenn instead of donal noye, but why the fuck of all deaths this episode, this one had to be off screen?!
could have been so fucking awesome to see on screen.. potentially could even match oberyn's exquisite death!


Â 
Probably logistics. It's easy to shoot giants and humans independently, but both together in a battle scene? I don't even want to imagine the trickery that goes into that one. Also, not showing us allows the viewer to hold up hope until Jon finally gets there and sees for himself what happened.
Â 


Does this mean that GRRM has given the show runners a time line for all character's death? Maybe even a rating on how important they might be in future books? For example - Pyp dead 1/4 through WoW, importance rating 2/10.... What if this list fell into the wrong hands? It would be chaos!!!!!


Â 
No, but he has given them the broad outline for the major characters and plot lines, so if Grenn and Pyp were in any way, shape of form singularly important to anybody's plot or the overall story, they'd know. And by singularly important I mean "can't be replaced by anybody else", which is why I think that GRRM is making a way bigger deal out of Mago getting killed than it actually is.
2828	Autumn is Coming	2014-06-09	They would never of died if Karl focking tanner from gin alley was there.that giant would of been fucked, he would of been drinking wine from the giants skull by dawn

There's always been room for Stannis to be great, and they've always opted to make him a dark and weak-minded antagonist. All of the Unsullied with whom I share this show absolutely despise him. Instead of thinking he's "too black/white," or any of the other legitimate criticisms which can be made of him, they think he's a petulant plaything of Mel's.

2830	Lann Casterly	2014-06-09	It would have been another ridiculous creation on their part if they had tried to portray Stannis as great in previous seasons. Â He is the furthest thing from great in the first few books. Â Finishing off the Wildlings, his interactions with Jon, his slowly winning over some of the northerners, I would expect and hope they will use those as opportunities to show Stannis' potential to be more than he seems early on in the story.
2831	Skore	2014-06-09	Pyp's death was a sudden brutal shock that came just after his little "yay" moment of finally hitting a foe.
Â 
Grenn's death was a slow, "aww man he didn't make it" deal that tasted bittersweet when you realise that he held the Gate no matter what.
Â 
Both got me right in the feels.

2832	Cyril	2014-06-09	I just don't see Grenn going out in a better way in the future.Â  Giving him Noye's part (which almost made me cry like a baby in the books) was perfect and added to his character.Â  The part where they were reciting their vows was extremely sad because you could tell exactly what was going to happen.
Â 
For some reason I felt more for Sam than I did Pyp, having to watch his friend die in his arms.Â  Which is strange, because I actually really do like Pyp.Â  I just happen to like Sam more, I suppose.
2833	crazibouncer	2014-06-09	I was upset that Pyp died and more so Grenn. Â He went out in a badass way. Â I knew when Jon stopped him and repeated "Hold the gate" he was a goner. Â
2834	NedStark2013	2014-06-09	Tormund would make a great allie to John to have at the wall really later on and a few other wildlings because most Nights watch are like those who Raped the Craster daughters and Id not trust them with my back.
2835	Jay Stark	2014-06-09	I am extremely saddened by the loss of both Pyp and Grenn. As most of you all said, Grenn went out a BAMF. Pyps' death was when I gave up hope for both men, you cant have one without the other. It is such a shame as Pyp was just starting to be built up a little more instead of being a familar face in a sea of extras. Grenn was just pure beast in his scenes and I have to say, i was a little disappointed his body wasn't wrapped in the giants hand, only slightly though. It did not affect the way i felt about it all. To those wondering about extra faces, i just want to point out we got an amazing 5 seconds of Three finger hobb casually strolling out and being a tough son of a bitch with his meat cleaver, hopefully it wasnt just a one time appearance. They're going to need some other faces for the eventually marsh situation.Â
2836	Mulled Wino	2014-06-09	It seemed like the whole watch was killed
2837	roxWolfox	2014-06-09	I think there's a dozen or so left.Â  And Ghost (Ghost does qualify as a Night's Watchwolf, doesn't he?).
2838	Mulled Wino	2014-06-09	I think there's a dozen or so left.Â  And Ghost (Ghost does qualify as a Night's Watchwolf, doesn't he?).


Â 
At the end they kept saying "they have 1000x more men than we do" Â so I guess 88k wildlings died
2839	Envie	2014-06-09	Ok - so they send Grenn down into the tunnel to take Donal Noye's place - I can live with that - but I was a little disappointed we didn't get to see the actual fight when the Giant hit the gate ... I know they did it off screen for a bigger impact at the end when Jon and Sam go down there and find them all dead but still - Grenn deserved his 15 seconds of hero glory if he had to die.
2840	teemo	2014-06-09	I'm thinking it was a money thing, but honestly, Jon not having any friends now is pretty stupid. There's still Edd; I guess he can play a bigger role next season.

Â 
...but he doesn't have any friends in the books, either. Â He sends all of them away. Â In ADWD, Sam, Pip and Grenn have all gone. Â This doesn't really make any difference story wise. Â Edd is in the books still, and he's still in the show, so I'm assuming he has a bigger role to play down the line.

2843	Envie	2014-06-09	Here's the thing - D&D may not know any more than we do if Grenn or Pyp played important roles in the future of the story. I'm starting to suspect they might be making some of these character cuts without George's approval. I've seen enough interviews with him now where he's said they do not have to get everything approved through him - they make their own plot choices. It's concerning. I'm losing my trust in D&D.

Â 
Well, if they are never coming back or doing anything important from here on out, I like the show runners' decision to kill them off and make this battle more dramatic with heavier consequences. Â Jon will be wrestling with the a lot of other things next season, and I think that this might give him more of an opportunity to befriend Tormund.

2849	ServantOnIce	2014-06-09	I didn't mind their deaths; they were emotional and added to the tragic scale of the battle. Plus, they have little to no parts in future storylines. I only wish that their characters were built up a bit. My SO thought that Pyp's death was much sadder than Ygritte's.Â 


Â 
Grenn hit me the hardest. I figured they both would die, but it was still shocking to see. Â

Â 
Agreed. Â That was when it really hit me how much the Watch had suffered in that battle. Â Jon's reaction was quite haunting...you could see that he knew what was coming, but all of the losses he had already suffered had deadened him to it. Â I know some people thought he should have cried more, but honestly, it makes more sense to me that he would be just shellshocked by everything that happened and everyone who was killed. Â He was also clearly exhausted and on a suicide mission of his own, so it's not as if he's expecting to outlive his dead friends much longer, anyway.
Â 
I thought it was a very powerful scene.

Yeah it definitely all ties into what has been Jon's theme throughout this entire season, growing into a leader. He sent Grenn to his death for the good of the watch and Grenn followed without hesitiation, literally dying for Jon in the process. Not only does it end a great, long-serving character's time on the show perfectly, but it's more gold in terms of Jon's own arc.Â 
You could even say the same for Sam with Pyp. For 38 episodes Sam has been the 'craven' of the show. He saw that queer fearful courage in Pyp and guided him through the battle, and eventually, his death.Â 
I was a little worried they would be dying purely just to amp up the named-casualty factor akin to the later seasons of TWD, but in typical Game of Thrones fashion, their deaths were serviced excellently and made for quality storytelling.Â

I find myself tearing up when I rewatch the episode...the deaths were so poignant.  Even Ygritte's death, which I didn't think would bother me, hit me with the prefect acting between the two of them,
2853	Theda Baratheon	2014-06-09	I fucking loved the Night's Watch bros.Â 
Â 
It's a DAMN SHAME they never had Donal Noye on the show (one of my FAVOURITE minor characters) but if they had to give the Epic Donal Noye Giant Slayer death to somebody, I'm glad it was Grenn. Loved him to bits, but it made for very emotional television.Â 
Â 
Oh, pyp.  I really wish they had't have had Ygritte kill Pyp...it made her death less sad for some people (I still cried my eyes out at it)
2854	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-06-09	To those who say Jon has no friends left on the Wall, I say FEAR NOT!!
He has:
Dolorous Edd (of course)
Sam
Maester Aemon
And perhaps a begrudging less spiteful ally in Allister Thorne
Tormund Giantsbane Who Beds Bears - he shall become a Jon ally as well. Â (I was most relieved they spared him!) Â Remember his line last season: "I like you boy, I do. But if you lie to me, I'll strangle you with your own guts." Â So he likes Jon, as long as he doesn't lie to him.
Â 
Losing Pyp and Grenn were sad, but any book reader had to know as soon as Grenn went down in the tunnel, he wasn't coming out.
Pyp's death did catch me by surprise. Â It was so sudden.

2855	boojam	2014-06-09	Yes it's casting budget, but it wasn't done because they had to save money. It was done because they didn't cast additional Wall characters in prior seasons (Donal Noye mainly).It's weird tho, HBO is raking it in...It's gonna seem odd that Jon only has what , two, recognizable NW brothers left? Maybe a couple of non speaking roles...?It's too bad it's like the loss of Dany's handmaidens.I noted before there are now too many 'major' characters and to few second stringers!That's odd.
2856	Jasta11	2014-06-09	It was sad, but well done. Their characters were no longer necessary and they presumably had to go to make room for Stannis, Melissandre and Oily (sp?). Grenn died the most heroic death possible, and while Pyp got the shaft on that front it was suitably shocking and sad. Much more powerful than Ygritte's if you ask me, and making the bitch kill him only made me want to see her dead.
2857	StrollofShame	2014-06-09	I didn't mind their deaths; they were emotional and added to the tragic scale of the battle. Plus, they have little to no parts in future storylines.

Yes, I insisted my Unsullied fiance watch the "previously on" segment twice, so he'd even remember that Ygritte & Jon were lovers...I was convinced he'd forgotten, & he hadn't, but all he's viewed all season is her "woman scorned" performance & he didn't really recall the depth of their relationship. Sad that this was so downplayed all season.

But GRRM has also said that he has told them what happens in books 6 and 7. And it seems rather likely that GRRM has some sort of plot line written down somewhere. So B&B aren't going to be killing off characters that are going to play leading roles in the war against the other.
Â 
Also Ser Alyster was distinctly referred to as having 'fallen'. Which usually implies dead but has not been clarified.Â

I did the same thing on my rewatch.Â  I was kind of surprised, as I didn't really have a strong connection to Ygritte (book or show, though I think Rose Leslie did a great job).Â  Maybe because their last moment reminded me of a particularly haunting tower of joy fanart.Â  Pyp and Grenn, though ... gah!Â  I even sniffled a little at the giants, too.Â
2860	Jameson Snow	2014-06-09	Why didn't Grenn and the others back away from the gate? They all got crushed... yet somehow the giant died too. Idk, seemed a little silly.

Â 
Well, I don't know if this makes it any better for you, but we never saw Jhiqui die (nor did we see her corpse), so there's still a chance that she's still around, but Missandei knows more about Slaver's Bay, making her a better companion for Dany right now.

I call 'bull' on that. GRRM thinks about all his minor characters that way. He said the same about the Dothraki that Drogo kills, yet he was/is a character that can be replaced by any generic Dothraki in the future.
2865	LordStoneheart	2014-06-10	Disagree. Mago's actions were the ones that seem keep Dany's hatred alive. The memory of Eroeh still haunts her. By cutting both the Eroeh and Mago story lines, it also takes away from a big part of Dany's character. If GRRM says killing Mago was a mistake, it was a mistake.

You still don't get it. If that is not part if the show (or minimal at best), it carries no weight going forward. And that minimal role can be played by ANY Dothraki.
Think show continuity - not book continuity.
2867	LordStoneheart	2014-06-10	I am thinking of both and of the author's own words that its a butterfly effect. He wouldn't say that for nothing. Sure, it can be played by a random Dothraki, but I'm guessing when the Winds of Winter comes out the interactions Dany will be heavily influenced by Mago's actions before. So in the show, whatever role he has to play (and it is confirmed he has one) will not carry the same weight as in the books. We know Dany wants her revenge against Jhaqo and Mago. In the show... well, Random Dothraki #s 21 & 53 just won't have impact.

Â 
The one with the meat cleaver was three finger hobb, who they have mentioned before but never shown, fingers crossed he starts getting screen time. And they can introduce other watchmen like iron emmet and Jaramy Rykker, they also did have character representations for Othell yarwick and bowen marsh, but they will most likely only stay background noise. Â Its a shame as i like almost every nights watch member (at least in the books).

They said that it had been shot with 20 arrows already...I don't think more would have phased it and arrows are a shit weapon in close combat.
2870	Tadco26	2014-06-10	If it had been shot by 20 arrows and survived that's pretty unbelieveable that ANYTHING the night's watch could do would kill it.
2871	diaur	2014-06-10	When asked about minor character deaths (that aren't dead in the books) I believe D&D said they have to kill characters off to be able to cast new ones.
Â 
I personally just don't like the fact that they now know exactly what happens in the last books so if they kill someone who isn't dead in the books (or do things very differently) we can assume things / see that something/someone isn't as relevant as we might have thought they were etc and I'm worried that it will ruin our book experience.

They do.  Hell, we do...they get shipped off without another word.
The plain fact is GRRM has too many fucking characters, most of which get mentioned once or twice and have very little reason to be there.  Even book readers forget them or mix them up with other people...I have to check the wiki to remember them sometimes.  He's free to do it, of course, but it weakens the story when we don't have emotional investment in the characters we are reading about.
The showrunners don't have that luxury because each character they cast costs money and takes up valuable screen time, so they have to simplify their character list by combining or completely cutting out characters to make it easier for the show watchers to follow.  Even then, it's still crowded.  They know which characters are important to the books..,but that doesn't mean those characters are or will be important to the show.  It's not one for one, and Martin isn't the authority on what will be important in the show...only his books.

I don't see why you worry about it. As most who dislike the show have stated, the way the showrunners/writers are destroying the carefully drawn-out plotlines Mr. Martin has crafted over the last 18 or so years, season 5-7 will be completely altered.Â  There will be nothing to compare, so there won't be any secrets revealed or spoilers to be concerned about.Â
2877	Ghost of Snow	2014-06-10	Truth to be told, Grenn and Pyp while being enjoyable characters never did something major in ADWD. From that perspective I can understand why they killed them. After all, they didn't want to just kill nameless soldiers, they wanted to kill some characters we care for.
Â 
Still, I don't think it's a good choice because the Wall already has a few likable characters in the tv series. I worry how the next season will progress on the wall with such a few good characters. At least, I hope they'll add some new black brothers to fill the gap.
2878	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-10	How could they kill them?...well

Â 
It's a giant. Â I doubt they have normal skin that can be easily penetrated by something like an arrow. Â It was probably akin to having porcupine needles shot at it...it would hurt, but it wouldn't be remotely fatal.

Â 
Well, it's going to have several major characters there (likable or not depends on your view, I guess). Â I'm sure there will be plenty of interest in that. Â I would be surprised if Tormund doesn't become more of a main character at the Wall, considering the role he has in the books. Â And I have a feeling that after viewers see how Jon's story progresses, he'll get some more fans who never really cared much about him before.

Well, I kinda agree about Mago. He canÂ be replaced for the plot purposes. But Willas may play a role in the books where him being the heir of Highgarden will play an important factor. And the show can't introduce him anymore because of the one line in season 3 that could have been easily avoided.Â
2882	Frank Fitzpatrick	2014-06-10	I get why they killed them and I thought it was excellently executed, but still...
Â 
Think the most unnerving thing about their deaths is that us fans of the books aren't even safe in knowing who lives and who dies when watching the show. It's almost like George and the showrunners have made a pact to keep killing off characters to keep us on our toes.

2884	sj4iy	2014-06-10	I get why they killed them and I thought it was excellently executed, but still...Â Think the most unnerving thing about their deaths is that us fans of the books aren't even safe in knowing who lives and who dies when watching the show. It's almost like George and the showrunners have made a pact to keep killing off characters to keep us on our toes.I don't know about you, but I do know that I love it XD It's nice to know that not everything is going to go the way we think it will.
2885	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-10	My girlfriend "who dies???"
Me "well...as far as the nights watch goes, none of them that are in the show..."
Realized we were losing some of them then.Also, I think it's safe to say - Olly is here to stay now. Jon's steward? That alone fills in the hole left by those two IMO


Â 
I don't know, I think I might have much rather have had the Gianted Bow and Arrow sling that kid back at least as far as Mole's Town and out of my life? Â   Â I know, I know, I'm evil. Â
2886	NedStark2013	2014-06-10	Maybe they will bring in Mance Sister the Wildling Princess and increase her role to that as a friend so people will Root for John to move on cause really Ygritte I don't moss her.
2887	jamal99	2014-06-10	I felt so bad for Pyp's death. For Grenn's too, but it was at least heroic...
Â 
Will they replace Marsh with Thorne for the stabbing?
2888	Young Nan	2014-06-11	I thought they would die and wasn't wrong...and their deaths added a tragic impact that the books didn't have at all, which I liked.  If they were just going to leave the story by being sent away, anyway, better for them to die when it matters.
That was my take on it as well.  Grenn's death was also pretty epic.  I was sorry to see them go, but since they were just gonna get shipped off anyhow, I don't think it matters in what manner they exit the story, so I am ok with their deaths adding more drama/tragedy to Jon's narrative.

2889	Aerheus Targaryen	2014-06-11	I really was praying that they didn't kill tormund...I knew grenn was dead as son as jon said hold the tunnel no matter what. I'm assuming ions relationship with Ed will improve along with more face time with Sam. They didn't kill Tormund, they took him prisoner. He is to replace Val, from the books.
2890	Raksha 2014	2014-06-11	They didn't kill Tormund, they took him prisoner. He is to replace Val, from the books.


Â 
Looking forward to seeing Stannis command Jon to marry Val if he wants to be Lord of Winterfell, then. Â Tormund the Wildling Princess! Â 
Â 
Seriously, I get your point. Â He'll play the role of Jon's intermediary with the Wildlings (that is, if someone gets Maester Aemon to treat Tormund's wounds before he dies of infection; and oh yes, get those arrows out in the first place). Â  I would think they would get someone to play Val, though; she does seem to be an important character at the Wall and ply into more than one arc - Jon, Gilly/baby, Mance, possibly Shireen, and Selyse's knights (who ignite the riot in which Jon is attacked, because one of them tried to steal Val and Wun Wun objected).
2891	Arkash	2014-06-11	Val ! Val ! Val ! We need Val !!!!!! (yeah, yeah, fan crush I know ! But I still have some more pragmatic reasons to really adore her character and hope she makes the cut and becomes more relevant later on !)
Â 
With the deaths of Grenn and Pyp, the show has some room to cast at least four new characters to the Wall storyline (not major all of them, since we'll already get Stan, Mel, Selyse and Shireen, manning the ranks) :
Â 
- Val.
- Bowen Marsh equivalent. At least one new important brother.
- Varamyr (who we know is being cast).
- A Queen's Man (Justin Massey seems the most logical choice).
2892	NedStark2013	2014-06-11	I like that the scared boy found his courage but too bad it didn't go through her head. Cause the Show Ygritte is always saying John Snow knows nothing and she is the one dying in his arms. Shae and Ygritte were annoying but that could be actor performance.
2893	Martini Sigil	2014-06-11	Donal Noye should have been on the show.


Totally agree... it wouldn't have taken much to mention him a couple of times....
Â 
If nothing else, at least Grenn's sword should have been sticking out of the giant's mouth, a la Noye heroics
2894	Koi No Yokan	2014-06-12	Val ! Val ! Val ! We need Val !!!!!! (yeah, yeah, fan crush I know ! But I still have some more pragmatic reasons to really adore her character and hope she makes the cut and becomes more relevant later on !)

I'm holding out on hope for Val, too. If she's cut, it'll be the first time I'm genuinely upset that they didn't cast a character.

But they had to use his (Donal Noye) character lines back in season 1 to begin to make us love show Tyrion.

Boy those guys were pretty stupidly equipped in the tunnel. Â The NW has no spears? Â Crossbows?

2897	Masamune	2014-06-12	Seeing as Grenn & Pyp feature marginally in the remaining books, they probably had a choice of either killing the characters off now in dramatic fashion or losing the actors later down the line. Although, they've had no trouble putting other characters on a bus and never mentioning them again *cough*Greatjon*cough*.=PS=I don't watch the show. Stopped after S2 when I realized where it was headed, but I do enjoy reading the nitpick threads, which only confirm what I always feared.

2903	Masamune	2014-06-13	I don't see what the big deal is.

All of the pointless and unnecessary changes soured the experience for me and I knew it was only going to get worse from that point on. Do I need to actually watch Jaime rape Cersei in the show to know that's what happened? Or any other egregious deviation that takes place?

Frankly, yes, considering that there's ongoing controversy about that scene and how closely it matches the scene and intentions of the main players in the book.

How would you know how egregious anything is based on someone else's opinion of the show? Basic fact is that you made up your mind long ago on the show, and are simply looking for others who confirm your view on it. If you don't like the show, fine, and if you don't want to watch it, that's fine, too...hell, if you watched the show JUST to criticize it, that's okay- but you cannot criticize something you have not watched because you don't KNOW how it actually played out. And coming into a thread where people are criticizing things isn't exactly a truthful representation of what's on the screen.

Bowen Marsh has actually already featured, albeit very briefly, so no need for an equivalent. Earlier on the season, when Jon suggests filling the tunnel, Thorne says, 'Bowen Marsh, you lead the builders, could it be done?' or words to that effect.
Â 
I have a vague memory of an attractive blonde woman being cast before season 3 - it wasn't confirmed who she would play, but everyone was sure she would be Val. She doesn't seem to have materialised though...I don't know if they would cast someone 2 seasons early, or if she just got sidelined. I don't think that actress played anyone else, because I can't think of any characters she could possibly be.
If Val hasn't been dropped, I imagine we'll meet her next episode in Mance Rayder's tent. I imagine they'll combine her with Dalla, no need for both of them really.

Â 
No, Thorne didn't say it was Bowen Marsh in charge of the builders, iirc, he actually used the correct name, Othell Yarwyck. Â I know it wasn't Bowen Marsh, I'm 90% certain that he said Brother Yarwyck?
Â 
I put some of the below in spoiler tag as I just noticed this thread is labelled show spoiler, not sure if I should put book spoilers in hiding. Â I did so to be certain. Â 
Â 

	Spoiler  want Val, too, though. Â She's a very intriguing person, and I suspect she might have a future role to play. Â Also, I think the baby switch with her sister's baby and Gilly's was to illustrate........how Jon could have been 'switched' or just someone else's, passed off as a bastard, as Sam wanted to do with Gilly's son. Â I'm wondering if D&D are interested in those kind of hints for the show?
 Â 
Â 
ETA: Â I just checked the episode guide here, and I was right, it is Yarwyck who is named as First Builder, not Marsh. Â IIRC, I think Marsh is said to exist, in previous season, I haven't checked on that, but I recall talk of him being named in cast lists in at least one previous year.

2911	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-06-14	Val is a hot chick. That alone means she'll make it in. Gotta fill that T&A quota.

I believe in the first season he was simply a stand in and never called by name in the show itself, but he may have been credited as Marsh...hence the confusion.
2915	Justin Danford	2014-06-15	The problem being, what did GRRM have in store for Jon Snow's best buds? Those 4 always reminded me of Frodo, Same, Pippen, and Merry, and these 4 had large roles to play. GRRM is a big Tolkien fan...not saying there is definitely a correlation, but this may be another case of what GRRM has noted "the butterfly effect" happening to his story. 
I'm curious how many butterflies D&D plan on squishing..:

Considering that neither of them do much in the books, particularly not post-ASOS, I think it's safe to say that they aren't that important plot-wise (unless Martin does a major a**pull in AWOW and ADOS and suddenly has them singlehandedly save the Wall or something like that).
2918	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-06-21	Scandaloso! How could they kill poor Pyp. He still had so much to do.

2924	Lady Grimshaw	2014-08-06	I know! I was watching this episode and I was like, whoa! Thorne is a
Â 
badass in this episode.
2925	zaphodbrx	2014-08-06	Show!Alliser is pretty awesome..
Â 
Book!Alliser, well, isn't.
2926	Batbob45	2014-08-06	Book Thorne-one of my least favorite
ShowThorne-Â  doesn't respect Janos and after the Battle at the wall, I hate him less
2927	siknes	2014-06-09	So Allister was wounded, but not mortally, thank the Gods. Which means he will be one of the candidates for LC.
Â 
Not sure if D&D will bring in other candidates from ST and EW, to make it more like the books, hence Bowden Marsh, but at least it won't be Slynt, the cravinous bastard. "I'm sorry about the children."
Â 
I'm sure Slynt will try and put his name in the hat, so to speak, but Sam willÂ bring him aside and set his ass straight. "I'll keep your secret only if you do not enter for candidacy. Otherwise every brother will know you as the coward Jonas Slynt, former commander of the Gold Cloaks of KL."
Â 
It will be great, Sam stepping up and being the man his vile father wanted him to be.
Â 
I wonder ifÂ D&D will ever have Maester Aemon tell the truth behind Ser Allister's hatredÂ toward 'Lord Snow.'Â Allister is too proud to tell the truth. It would work withÂ AemonÂ telling Sam. "Ser Allister came to Castle Black a beaten man soon after Robert's Rebellion. A former Lord himself,Â who fought for the wrong side. Truth be told it was called Robert'sÂ Rebellion, but it was Ned Stark with Jon Aryan's counselÂ that won that war and defeated Ser Allister in battle. Ned Stark told Ser Allister to take the black and live, or be served cold justice by Robert."
Â 
I'mÂ not sure if my theory is true according to GRRM, because we don't have all the facts of RR, but it sure does seem to fit. Ned and his vanguard seemed to be sweeping all over Westeros winning battle after battle, while Stannis held SE. From what I remember Robert was wounded early on, eventually healed and fought Raegar at the Trident.
Â 
It just seems more fitting that D&D kept Allister alive to continue his antagonist role toward Jon, rather than let Slynt take the role over.
Â
2928	Lord Defiance	2014-07-28	LC is a vote between all NW members, they need at least 50% of the votes I believe, maybe 65%. So in reality, someone like Janos who has only been at the wall for a short time could be nominated as well.
2929	bayjew	2014-06-15	Don't get me wrong, absolutely loved this episode. Really enjoyed how the show took a whole hour to express the battle and other elements to defending the wall. With that being said, I just feel as though deciding to kill off Grenn and Pyp were two terrible mistakes in this episode. Just quickly, I realise that the fight needed to kill characters that the audience is connected with, but this raises me to the issue with the wall storyline as a whole (just in the television show). The Wall itself is a setting that frequently draws complaints from many people who watch the show, mainly because it lacks pace and is "boring". Having always enjoyed the Jon perspective the most in the books and in the show, I can't really say the same, however I will say that I can understand why people may find it boring.
Â 
The Wall lacks any significant characters that can create intrigue. Certainly, Jon is obviously a pinnacle character, Sam too, but the audience has no other significant characters that it can attach to or like or hate in this story. We have Ser Aliser Thorne and recently Janos Slynt, but we as the audience are supposed to hate these characters. Grenn and Pyp, two characters given to us from season one, have remained somewhat consistently throughout the series, my main point here is that they are recognisable. We lack significant recognisable faces in this storyline, we have Jon, Sam, Aliser, Dolorous, Janos, Aemon, Grenn, Pyp. The wall supposedly had 100 men for this fight, yet it felt like we knew nothing about any of the nights watch members that fought and died. Establishing minor characters is essential, as Grenn had to fill Donal Noye's role. These two characters should not have died. Grenn represents Jon's connection with the fighting force of the Night's Watch, a man who he has known for two years almost. Pyp has the connection to the stewards etc. It just didn't feel right killing them off to me, also partially because of the role they play in helping Jom become Lord Commander.
Â 
Â
2930	WikkedLoli	2014-07-07	I was upset with the deaths of Pyp and Grenn as well. As you said, I believe they did it so we could feel the sadness of losing important characters from the Wall we knew, which we didn't know that many. And having started the next book AFFC(490 pages in), I agree it stinks because Jon has big important decision to make and then his friends do what they do with the vote for Lord Commander which of course is a huge impact in Jon making that final decision. And now that I know what happens with Sam, I feel like Jon will be friendless except for Dolorous Edd. But maybe that is how it should be as Jon may be changing and growing into his role of Lord Commander. He may not be able to be as soft and friendly as he was before. Â Aw man...when Stannis the Mannis gave Jon that choice...when I thought of Jon as Lord of Winterfell...:-( Oh, how I wanted it for him..
2931	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-07-10	Grenn really grew on me this season. I would have liked for him to stick around a little longer, at least until after Jon's election, but at least they gave him an awesome hero's death. I never really cared about Pyp.
2932	boojam	2014-07-24	Dave and Dan said they needed to kill off some sympathetic characters, which George did not do , as far as I can recall. IN fact the attack from the South was smaller in the book.But this leaves Jon with very few of the NW brother who were his circle of friends , I know they have team Stannis there, enough speaking parts... is it just Sam and Edd and Maester Aemon?It's kind of like D&D killing off all of Dany's handmaidens , she really has too few characters about her now.

^THIS. Guy gets shit done. I've actually always had some respect for him.
2943	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Everything...this is now my favorite episode ever. I don't care if there were clichA©s or if I could tell who would die, I thought the action was great, the pacing was great and the asskicking was off the charts. Scythes, hammers to the head, giant archers, people dying off who didn't in the books...just loved it. Thorne was amazing. I've always liked him in the show, but this just cemented it for me.And Jon Snow...wow, they did a great job with him taking command and just finally getting to kick some fucking ass, it was great. And I actually did like Ygritte's death here...I liked that they took a quiet moment for it among all of the chaos around them. I also like that it's Jon making the decision to sacrifice himself to try and kill Mance instead of being sent out. Nice change, it really solidifies how dead inside he feels from losing Ygritte.

2944	Corvinus	2014-06-08	I liked a lot about this episode, but here are a few things
Â 
The Wall's defenses (barrels, scorpions, guys with bows hanging from the edge, and of course the massive anchor)
The great camera work and bird's eye views - especially the part when the camera moves around Castle Black showing all the little skirmishes and duels going on
The walking ballistae i.e. giant with a bow
Thorne vs Tormund
Jon vs Styr
Grenn's final recital of the oath
Maester Aemon and Sam

2946	IvanDrago	2014-06-08	+ Maester Aemon & Sam
+ Janos Slynt being a wuss
+ Allister Thorne getting some love, one of the characters that is improved from books to the show.
+ Tormund, Jon Snow, & Allister getting some badass moments
+ Giants & Mammoths
2947	Dain Storm	2014-06-08	Loved the Edd has the Wall part.
2948	Batbob45	2014-06-08	The kid geting revenge on Ygritte for his parents death.
2949	wight knight	2014-06-08	Giants with giant arrows. Remiends me dark souls!
2950	Walkyier	2014-06-08	Jon and Ygritte's respective smiles. Good stuff.
2951	Darkbringer	2014-06-08	Everything.
Â 
but especially the scythe, Thorne, Tormund and Grenn's epic death.
2952	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-08	Loved the Edd has the Wall part.


For some reason i was sure that he was going to bite a arrow during that time. Â Would be Edd's luck, be in charge of the wall, take a arrow to the neck a couple seconds later.
2953	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-06-08	ALLISER THORNE WAS PERFECT. And I'd never thought i'd say that.Â 
Jon.Oh Jon. Further solidifies him as one of my fav GOT characters
The chain that took out the wildlings
Grenn and the Night's watch recital scene was beautiful
Ed was amazing I hope we get more of him
DAT TRACKING SHOTÂ 
Ygritte's death
Sam's character developmentÂ
2954	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-08	Oh man. Just... it all. Loved it all. The giant's bow and arrow and the scythe made me incredibly happy.
Â 
And Thorne's speech to Jon about leadership was perfect. Pyp before the battle was great acting, and it hurt so much to see him go. I don't even want to think about it being Ygritte who killed him.
Â 
I like that they used the fact that the Night's Watch are not an organized, experienced group of people. Nobody knew the proper orders for shooting arrows, they stabbed a flaming barrel full of oil, and Janos Slynt... really sold that as commander of the gold cloaks he'd never seen an ounce of real combat in his entire life. Fookin' coward.Â 
Â 
And I have to say, that long tracking shot of the fight in the courtyard was some of the best camera work I've ever seen.
2955	metr0man	2014-06-08	Tracking shot. Ghost. Thorne vs Tormund. Green in the tunnel. Sam being a badass. Jon vs the Thenn.
2956	go joff go	2014-06-08	Fade to white
2957	go joff go	2014-06-08	Fade to white
2958	Darkbringer	2014-06-08	Yeah Edd did a bang up job in charge of the wall.
2959	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	The scythe.
Sam really being Samwise.
Jon saying "Aye, you should have" in response to Tormund yelling as they carried him off, "I should've thrown you off the top of the wall when I had the chance, Boy."
Dolorous Edd, always anything with Dolorous Edd.
Maester Aemon.
Janos Blount, such a jerk, he was hilarious.
Grenn leading the recitation of the Nights Watchmen vows before they faced the giant.
Alliser Thorne was outstanding.
ETA:  So good to see Jon in his element.  He was awesome.

2960	Arkash	2014-06-08	Everything has been said !Â 
Â 
Reliving the episode just reading this thread !
2961	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-08	Alliser Thorne. The Fooking Legend.Â
2962	BearQueen87	2014-06-08	I thought the battle itself was very well done.
I loved all the giant stuff--they're fun to watch (and terrifying)
Â 
Jon, though. Jon's always been one of my favorite so it was good to see him really shine as commander this episode.
2963	Ser Edmure Tully	2014-06-08	um, Hob and the boys in the kitchen kicking ass with a soup bowl and a meat cleaver anyone?
2964	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-08	I liked seeing Ghost tear that guys throat out. The episode could have used more gore though. At this point I'm mainly watching the show for the violence, not D&D's brilliant fan fiction.
2965	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	When Jon said "I'm not a poet!" I wanted to throw an harp at him.
2966	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-08	um, Hob and the boys in the kitchen kicking ass with a soup bowl and a meat cleaver anyone?


Â 
Yeah, my friend was cheering for the stewards during that part
2967	BearQueen87	2014-06-08	When Jon said "I'm not a poet!" I wanted to throw an harp at him. 


Â 
Obvious foreshadowing of paternity is obvious
2968	NightStark	2014-06-08	um, Hob and the boys in the kitchen kicking ass with a soup bowl and a meat cleaver anyone?


Â 
Hobb was like 'Oh hell no..not in my kitchen'
2969	Ruin	2014-06-09	Ygritte calling Sam fat...insane scouting skills.
2970	The Sword of the Night	2014-06-09	Was Rhagear a poet? I know he wrote songs but can't remember poetry.
2971	Cyril	2014-06-09	The Anchor.Â  The people I watch with were cheering at that.
Grenn's death was suitably epic and fitting.Â  They really couldn't have given him a better death.Â  Also related was those shots of the hall through the wall as the Giant was coming in.Â  It was very dark and menacing and set the mood.
Edd getting the wall.Â  I was hoping for a snarky comment about it, but even he really couldn't muster anything.
Flaming mammoths.Â  Does it get any more awesome than that?
Gilly and Slynt near the end.Â  Gilly ready and willing to defend herself when the door opens revealing Sam while Slynt is, er, Slynt.
Alliser.
Â 
Finally, Jon commenting about not bein a poet early on, and later not fighting honorablyfelt like a little hinthintnudgenudge.

He came walking out of that kitchen with that meat cleaver and I was like damn.
2973	Newstar	2014-06-09	Sam was awesome in this episode.

Great swordplay and action scenes.

Â 
I am the cleaver that guards the kitchens of men
2975	BearQueen87	2014-06-09	One of my favorite moments: the 6 brothers standing before the gate, saying the vows as a GIANT charges at them. It was a moving scene.
2976	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-06-09	That awkward silence when Sam sees Janos Slynt in the same room as Gilly. I couldn't stop laughing.
2977	FaolchAo	2014-06-09	Favourite episode, easily! Favourite part - sweeping 30 second shot over the battlefield, all one shot. AMAZING.
2978	Ruin	2014-06-09	Giant with the longbow was also epic.
2979	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-09	Everything.
2980	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-09	I really liked the Jon & Ygritte scene it was everything that I've been hoping/waiting for. I think I even shed a tear. I may even now be able to forgive them for having Ygritte kill the old man w/ an arrow instead of opening his throat. These were my two favorite Ygritte moments and one the got perfect the other the completely botched.
I loved all the stuff w/ the little kid.
Its always a pleasure to see Maester Aemon.
The Giants and the Mammoths! I told myself as long as they had them they could bungle everything else.
The way Edd defended the Wall was pretty cool as well. So were those serious a** giants arrows, I mean man. And I loved how that one giant was like eff this I'm opening this gate myself lol and came running down the tunnel
One thing about Thorne though- He's getting a lot of praise and it was all good yay Thorne but he just didn't do it for me. I feel like he did what he was suppose to do/what was expected of him and anything less could be comparable to Slynt hiding away in the cupboard w/ Gilly and the babe.
2981	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-06-09	Favourite episode, easily! Favourite part - sweeping 30 second shot over the battlefield, all one shot. AMAZING.

I was gonna say this one... Amazing
2982	ohpooratlas	2014-06-09	The last twenty or so minutes were stellar.
Â 
As a former film major, my inner film geek was going wild during that beautiful uncut panoramic action shot. It was stellar.
Â 
I also loved Ghost.
Â 
Loved Thorne, never thought I'd say that.
Â 
LOVED when Jon Snow was lowered from the cage and the music hit and he immediately jumped into BAMF mode.
Â 
The CGI for the giants and the mammoths was spectacular, holy cow.
Â 
I know the slow motion with Jon holding Ygritte was unrealistic, but it was really touching for me so I was willing to suspend disbelief in that moment to simply appreciate the beauty and the sadness of it all.
2983	Nictarion	2014-06-09	- John Bradley killed it in this episode!
Â 
- The Giants, especially seeing a giant riding a mammoth! (the giant archer was awesome too)
Â 
- The scythe of death!
Â 
- Grenn and Co saying the NW oath and dying like bosses in the tunnel against the king of the giants!
Â 
- Jon killing the Magnar with a hammer to the head!
Â 
Tbh there wasn't much I didn't love in this episode. It's by far my favorite of the season, and probably since 'And Now His Watch Has Ended'.Â
2984	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Maester Aemon https://fbcdn-sphoto...879431914_n.jpg


 Â
2985	Arkash	2014-06-09	Jon / Styr was amazing ! The choregraphy mastered by the actor ! Kit has been increidible at sword-fight the entire episode and the rapidity of his movements D&D teased us was phenomenal !Â 
And I loved that he showed he learnt the lesson from Karl. No honor ! Spit at that ugly face ! And the final skull-smashing !Â 
Â 
I also loved that his meeting with Ygritte was just after the duel. You see that Jon barely stands up, he's exhausted, hurt, half knocked-down and there she is, the woman he loves.
Kit's smile was perfect, so full of love, hope and resignation. Very well done the both of them ! Rose Leslie delivered Ygritte's last lines perfectly and I shared my tear at her death.
Â 
Maybe I'm on the minority here but I loved the slow-mo shot. It is an amazig visual ! Really beautiful !
Â 
EDIT :
Â 
Â 

I know the slow motion with Jon holding Ygritte was unrealistic, but it was really touching for me so I was willing to suspend disbelief in that moment to simply appreciate the beauty and the sadness of it all.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Exactly ! I loved being able to breath and let the feels sink in before switching back to the real shitstorm during that shot.
Â 
And that sequence-shot of the battle ! Waaaaaaw !Â

I missed that part! (I really really needed to go to the ladies room... and this fucking thing doesn't have commercials) Jon killing someone with a Hammer isn't a bit ironic??
2987	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	Alliser Thorne was EASILY the best part of this episode. His delivery, his lines, his fight with Tormund - all of it, perfect.
Definitely one of the best actors in the TV series, and one of the very very very few instances of the show improving on a character rather than urinating all over one.

Hah, I hadn't thought of that. It was only a teeny tiny hammer though, not a big fuck off hammer like Robert used.

Agree 100% on the Thorne part.
Can't agree on the rest. Bronn, osha, spring to mind without trying.
2991	Matoro	2014-06-09	Alliser Thorne was awesome. The soundtrack was damn awesome. Moment when Grenn & guys defending the gate began their oath was the most awesome NW-thing in in the show.
2992	sj4iy	2014-06-09	LOVED when Jon Snow was lowered from the cage and the music hit and he immediately jumped into BAMF mode.
That was absolutely my favorite part...it's just like "Hell yeah, bitches...let's do this!"  It was the perfect start of that panorama shot.

gave him flashbacks.
2997	Lady Lurksalot	2014-06-09	I read the books, knew what was coming, but still couldn't sit still and watched the last half hour standing in front of the tv. For me, this one was far better than Blackwater, and I can't think of a single thing I didn't like or that bothered me. Easily my favorite episode ( so far!)
2998	Sun	2014-06-09	Loved nearly everything about this ep.Â
2999	Cake	2014-06-09	Strange how no one has mentioned Tormund telling the story about him and the bear. Too bad that he got interruptedÂ
3000	Koi No Yokan	2014-06-09	Everything.Â 
Â 
However...
Â 
A big shout out to Kit Harrington for this episode. He's cemented my love for him as Jon Snow. They haven't always given Jon the best material in the show (Season 2 and a good portion of Season 3), but I'm glad they did him justice by focusing solely on The Wall - and Kit hit it out of the park! Screw the haters; I'll always enjoy The Wall much more than King's Landing.
Â 
My favourite book character, now much closer to becoming my favourite show character.
3001	MarieAntoinette	2014-06-09	I really liked this episode, I think I might prefer it to Blackwater. Kit was great Â the fight between him and Styr was very well done. I also loved the glimpse of Ghost that we got, and Master Aemon talking to Sam. Other awesome things about this episode were Thorne, and Tormund Â still standing and fighting and his quote to Jon before being dragged away.
3002	Nocturne	2014-06-09	ALLISER. FOOKIN. THORNE.


Â 
I said knock and hold you cunts!! Does knock mean draw??? NO SIR/ Does fucking hold mean fucking drop????NO SIR / You all plan to die here tonight??? NO SIR/ That's very good to hearÂ DRAW!!!!!!
Â 


I liked a lot about this episode, but here are a few things
Â 
The Wall's defenses (barrels, scorpions, guys with bows hanging from the edge, and of course the massive anchor)
The great camera work and bird's eye views - especially the part when the camera moves around Castle Black showing all the little skirmishes and duels going on
The walking ballistae i.e. giant with a bow
Thorne vs Tormund
Jon vs Styr
Grenn's final recital of the oath
Maester Aemon and Sam


Â 
What i also loved in particular(loved the whole episode)
Â 
Jon dropping the hammer on Styr`s head.
Thorne vs Tormund.
Tormund going all rampage.
Everything related to giants.
Grenn going Â out like a total boss.
The walls defense, the scythe thing was awesome!
Jon and Yigrete:(
3003	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-09	I liked, that the kept in the strawdolls atop the wall, so that it looks from below as ifÂ  they had hundreds of archers.Â
3004	Allison of Tarth	2014-06-09	* Alliser redeeming himself somewhat. Very well conceived and well acted. I actually rooted for him. 
* Jon's fight with the Magnar was one of the show's best. Much better executed than the Viper/Mountain fight. 
* Sam power-smooching Gilly. Did not see that coming but I cheered.
3005	NomadicDirewolf	2014-06-09	The Giant firing the bow/ballista was awesome, i'm kind of sad that GRRM didnt think of that
3006	Mel_Rose	2014-06-09	It was a great episode, I loved everything in it more or less. The giants and the mammoth, Thorne's speech, Jon's fighting moves, the stupid Slynt, the anchor, the panoramic shot ending with Tormund Har Har-ing, Sam's lines, Ollie's like-a-boss look after shooting Ygritte.
Â 
If I had to pick the best aspects of it imo, then Grenn and the others reciting the vows and drawing the swords would probably come first. I actually teared up at the scene.Â  Also, the release of Ghost. Go boy!Â  (i mean, you have a weapon of mass destruction in your shed, why'd you keep it locked up?  )
3007	Nictarion	2014-06-09	The Giant firing the bow/ballista was awesome, i'm kind of sad that GRRM didnt think of that


It actually makes more sense than regular archers hitting men 700ft above them. I believe GRRM has said he made a mistake making the wall so big.
3008	Talleyrand	2014-06-09	The small bit were the cooks utterly fucking stomp the wildlings who break into the hall, using a pan and a cleaver.
Â 
Neil Marshall must have something for badasses with pans
3009	aerislair	2014-06-09	When Jon said "I'm not a poet!" I wanted to throw an harp at him. 


Â 
Â I knew what you did there, GOT script writer, hahahaha!
3010	ToTheWolves	2014-06-09	Ghost!
3011	DominusNovus	2014-06-09	Thorne, scythe, and anything involving the giants. Â Hell, even when one (was that Mag?) was running, it was awesome.
3012	igrewupinKL	2014-06-09	Ser Aliser's Lines
Â 
Jon, all round was really good. His heartbreaking smile when he saw Ygritte to then see her killed. I really liked Ygritte's death scene, very emotional. And i liked the fact she got her end by a little kid. Great revenge for his parents and Pyp.Â 
Â 
Grenn the Giantslayer. If only he had lived
Â 
Giant's were awesome. Felt a little sad when they died though
Â 
Edd. Just everything Edd does
Â 
Sam and Aemon talk. Just Aemon being a badass as usual
Â 
Great wide span shots during the fighting

- Sam killing the Thenn
- Wall defending tricksÂ 
- Tormund
3017	The Monkey	2014-06-09	I loved the episode, a small detail I loved was that they didn't repeat GRRM's mistake of having wildling archers be able to kill NW men on top of a 700 feet wall. The giant archer was a BAMF, though.
3018	Batman	2014-06-09	This is Jon.

3019	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-09	+ Mammoths and Giants wielding giant bows (that one shot that literally makes a crow go flying over the wall)
+ Ser Alliser Thorne not acting like a jealous twat but like an actual commander (plus faring reasonably well when fighting Tormund)
+ Jon Snow actually living up to his name in the books and slaying wildlings left, right and centre (his fight with Styr and caving in his head with a hammer)
+ Janos Slynt losing all dignity and living up to his reputation of a coward
+ Sam finally growing some balls ("just open the gate for fucksake!)
+ Tormund and his "bear" story and wreaking havoc at Castle Black (taking a whole group of crows to restrain him)
+ That Scythe/Blade weapon (no need to say why awesome that its)

3020	Jamie Lannister	2014-06-09	Ser Alliser in general. Seeing him admit his fuck ups, kick in the Wildlings, and rally the Watch was all quite satisfying.
3021	Three sisters	2014-06-09	Giants, giant bow, giant scythe, and the fact that we have to wait for Mannis (which is actually quiet like the book) till next week. Unsure though, how they gonna manage all the action going on in next weeks episode.
3022	BearQueen87	2014-06-09	Everything.Â 
Â 
However...
Â 
A big shout out to Kit Harrington for this episode. He's cemented my love for him as Jon Snow.

Â 
My favourite book character, now much closer to becoming my favourite show character.


Â 
Agreed. They screwed his whole "beyond the wall" storyline with Mance, but he really got ot shine in 409 as Jon Snow.
3023	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	The fight between Jon and Styr was epic.Â
3024	CatelynStrk	2014-06-09	The fight between Jon and Styr was epic.Â 


Â 
Looks like he had a splitting headache by the end of it.... heh heh.Â
3025	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	I loved the way he split him mouth open on the anvil and then threw him over the fire.
Â 
I had a really bad feeling that Ygritte was going to save him but nope. Hammer to the face!
Â 
I've said it at least ten times but GOT always have great one on one fights.Â
3026	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	The opening was fantastic.
3027	Kungsmurfen	2014-06-09	I loved the episode, a small detail I loved was that they didn't repeat GRRM's mistake of having wildling archers be able to kill NW men on top of a 700 feet wall. The giant archer was a BAMF, though.


Â 
  I really liked that.Â
3028	Corvinus	2014-06-09	Another thing I liked was Djawadi's soundtrack. Just as badass at the scenes it was complementing.
3029	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-06-09	First of all, I just love that this was a Wall-only episode. Book 3 and on, my favorite stories are all in the North and it has not been given the justice it deserves in this show so far (imo) and this episode just lit that story on fire.
Â 
I love seeing Jon coming into his own and becoming the leader that he is. Sam was just Everything in this episode. Alliser Thorne was amazing.Â 
Â 
I loved Ygritte's death - it moved me almost as much as it did in the books. Â 
Â 
Grenn defending the gate, although I'm sad to see Grenn go, I just love that he got to die a hero.
Â 
Pyp getting at least one kill before he died.Â 
Â 
And there were Giants!!
Â 
I also loved the NW's defense of the wall from the guys hanging over the wall to the barrels being sent over to explode and of course, the Scythe.
Â 
I'm like a kid at Christmas and can't wait until next week. It's gon' be good!!!!

3030	son1dow	2014-06-09	I liked the important parts, those being Jon's interactions, the battles and the decisions the characters face.
3031	Three sisters	2014-06-09	Giants, giant bow, giant scythe, and the fact that we have to wait for Mannis (which is actually quiet like the book) till next week. Unsure though, how they gonna manage all the action going on in next weeks episode.
3032	hannibal2121	2014-06-09	The music was amazing -- ratcheted up the tension and adrenaline 10-fold.
Â 
Grenn's recital of the vows was the most moving part of the episode to me.
Â 
Loved all of Sam's scenes.Â  He added humanity to all of the carnage.
Â 
Thorne was terrific.
Â 
Jon v. Styr
Â 
The scythe
Â 
That Rohan horn
Â 
Ghost.
3033	Carl Rhaego	2014-06-09	- Great action, effects, fights and choreography all around. The fights in Blackwater look like fake sparring in comparison. CGI is mindblowing for a TV show.
Â 
- Ygritte's death was sad and emotional but not over the top and drawn out.
Â 
- Jon vs Styr was awesome, especially those several blows from Jon to the axe with no cuts in-between.
Â 
- Sam was great the entire episode. He and Gilly are cute.
Â 
- Lots of funny bits between the fighting and the sad deaths.
Â 
- Some amazing individual action scenes: the scythe, the panorama shot of the battle inside Castle Black, the Giant knocking a brother from the Wall.
3034	jonny__bravo	2014-06-09	Hobb with the butchers cleaver: "Looks like wildling is back on the menu boys!!"
3035	Follmann	2014-06-09	-Hobb preparing some extra rare wild game.
-Thorne being a badass.
-The giants and the mammoth.
-The giant archer, that was brutal.
-Thorne vs. Tormund.
-Jon vs. Styr.
-The scythe of doom.
-That long panoramic shot.
-The vows during the giant's charge.
-A little bit of Ghost.
3036	Ankou	2014-06-09	Jon Snow winning that fight because what he learned from the Fookin' Legend. Karl Tanner's influence lives on.Â
3037	teej6	2014-06-09	Maester Aemon and Sam
I'm not a bleeding poet
Jon Snow finally...
the Chain
Thorne
Jon Snow taming Tormund 
Edd's command 
Grenn rallying the troops and then dying <U+00F0><U+009F>­
3038	The Iron Banker	2014-06-09	-I loved Sam he was great; OPEN THE FUCKING GATE
-Dolorious Edd of course
-Tormund
-THORNE
-The Archor, but WTF?
-The Giant with the bow
-Grenn and his boys reciting the vows gave me goosebumps
-Jon
Â 
So many awesome moments in this episode, got me to the edge of my chair even though I read the books and knew what was going to happen, more or less.
One of my fav episodes on the entire show
3039	teej6	2014-06-09	Jon Snow winning that fight because what he learned from the Fookin' Legend. Karl Tanner's influence lives on.Â  
Lol
3040	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-06-09	Mostly everything. Special mention to the tunnel/gate scene. Very cool. You didn't need to see them die, you know they were going to die, it was beautiful.
Â 
ETA: my first reaction was disappointment but a minute after that, I'm glad they didn't rush The Mannis appearance.

3041	Angmar	2014-06-09	Ygritte's death actually being soft and melancholic instead of being a massive sexual gorefest ala Talisa's death.
Â 
Â 
Mammoths!
Â 
Ghost kicking ass. 
Â 
Sam and Gilly and their kiss- best canon couple on the show next to OberynxEllaria. 
Â 
My boy Jon kicking ass.
Â 
Edd being Lord of the Wall.
3042	BoldGhost	2014-06-09	Grenn's scene gives me chills still with every re-watch. Brilliant.Â
3043	protar	2014-06-09	Everything with Giants, and the mammoth! I sure hope Wun Wun's in next season.
3044	Prince of the North	2014-06-09	I thought the giants and mammoth were good.
3045	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-09	- Ser Alliser Thorne - He may be a prejudiced asshole, but he fought like a badass former knight and did his duty. As for Janos Slynt: that craven windbag did pretty much what the audience expected of him.
Â 
- Tormund Giantsbane, Husband-to-Bears. Best wildling badass so far.
Â 
- The fight between Alliser and Tormund. Surprisingly hardcore but of duelling for two fairly minor characters.
Â 
- The giant with the bow - yikes !
Â 
- Sam promising to Gilly the same thing that Oberyn did to Ellaria.
Â 
- Sam in general, in this episode.
Â 
- The "Scythe" - more like the Windshield Wiper, har !
					
					
							Edited by Pod The Impaler, 09 June 2014 - 01:31 PM.
3046	Bleiz	2014-06-09	- I loved the hammer and the anvil parallels between Jon and Styr, quite poetic in a morbid kind of way- Pretty much everything that came out of Sam's mouth- Jon being a BAMF, especially when the music changed!!!- Ghost! (however brief)- Hold the gate! probably the best character death in terms of going out like a boss- The windshield wiper of doom- Tormand and the BearAnd so much more.. ahh I loved this episode
					
					
							Edited by Bleiz, 09 June 2014 - 02:03 PM.
3047	Seneti	2014-06-09	Okay, guys, this will take a while:
- Sam explaining the loopholes of the NW oath
- hooray for the warg owl
- Tormund and the bear story
- Gilly and her baby managing to get by the Wildlings without being seen
- Aemon! nice callback to his conversation with Jon
- Gilly + Sam reunion was truly heartwarming
- epic shot of the biggest fire the north has ever seen
- Aliser realizing his mistake and quasi apologizing for it, while still maintaining his dignity
- Sam + Gilly kiss
- Sam encouraging Pyp (and the look of awesomeness and joy on Pyp's face when he finally did manage to shoot a Wildling)
- giants + giant riding a mammoth - hell yeah!


Â 
I said knock and hold you cunts!! Does knock mean draw??? NO SIR/ Does fucking hold mean fucking drop????NO SIR / You all plan to die here tonight??? NO SIR/ That's very good to hear DRAW!!!!!!


- drill sergeant Thorne was epic and insanely funny - my second favorite moment of that episode
- Thorne's speech
- Slynt being a whiny ass after being given command of the Wall and leaving the Wall to Jon
- epic giant bow shot
- Hobb and his boys killing Wildlings with fookin' frying pans and a cleaver
- Janos Slynt in the pantry - now I'm afraid for Gilly - we know what Slynt did to the last baby he got his hands on
- Pyp's death!- nooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!! Â 
- Grenn not hesitating to fight for Jon, even thought they both know that it's a suicide mission
- duel between Aliser and Tormund
- Sam yelling at Ollie, then realizing he sounds like his father and speaking more gently to himÂ 
- epic shot of rampaging, burning mammothÂ  Â 
- Jon to Edd: you have the wall - boy, they are going through the chain of command very fast!
- epic repetition of NW creed to charging giant - my favorite moment of the episode
- Go, Ghost, go! (I told you that was Ghost in the promo)
- Jon vs. Styr - brutal fight with very realistic and pragmatic ending (fook the swords, use whatever weapon you have)
- Ygritte's death - so sad, so beautiful, "You know nothing, Jon Snow"
- and now we know what the slow-mo death is 
- the chain made me go wow, eww, wow (in that order) - also a nice callback to another chain we should have seen two seasons ago, third-favorite moment
- Gilly kicked Slynt's ass... with a piece of veal? I love it!Â   Â Just look at Slynt's terrified face when Sam comes in...
- Jon planning to kill Mance was a nice example of a change that makes sense
- Grenn... no... just no... don't go all Donal Noye on me (saddest death of the series so far for me)Â  Â  Â  Â 
- one certain moment missing at the end made me really look forward towards the forum outrage
Â
3048	TheonGreyjoy	2014-06-09	Best episode of the series so far. My heart was pumping for 60 minutes, it is the only episode which really can match the book on excitement. And that shot were the camera fly across castle black for like 30 seconds, is one of the best i ever saw on screen. Kit Harrington really stepped it up in this episode, his best performance so far, so much badass.Â 

					
					
							Edited by TheonGreyjoy, 09 June 2014 - 02:18 PM.
3049	protar	2014-06-09	Sam was really the high light of this episode. I know a lot of people don't like his love story with Gilly (and sometimes I wish he'd go five minutes without mentioning her ) but seeing him finally coming into his own a being a true man of the Night's Watch was great. And he was realistically badass. He wasn't slaughtering dozens of foes which is what you expect from medieval fantasy heroes, he was picking them off with his bow when he could and just generally being fearless and awesome.
3050	TheLoreSeeker	2014-06-09	Awww man. Giant Arrows from Giant Bows was amazing. Grenn's speech was great. Burning Mammoth.
But I got the most giddy when the Wildlings attack the dining hall and the cooks just bash them with pots and boiling water. Then Hobb just casually strolls in with a GIANT cleaver and messes dudes up.

The giant bow and arrow was cool, the chain too
Jon vs Styr was good - that anvil looked like it really hurt

3052	RavenKing23	2014-06-09	DI Throne chewing out the watchmen, there's always that one asshole. . .
3053	jakmanuk	2014-06-09	SPOILERS:
Â 
What I liked:
Grenn's epic death
Allister being a badass
Jon being a hero
Including mammoths and giants
Sam telling Pyp to open the fucking door
Pyp's sad death
Edd's anchor
The tracking shot of Castle Black
The giant's arrow flinging a crow off the other end of the wall
The people hanging off the wall whilst shooting arrows
Jon's face getting smashed against an anvil, just showed how much Jon is willing to do for the good of the realm
Mance's Fire
Tormund and Thorne's fight
Â 
Â 
What I didn't like:
Fade to white, so now Stannis's big moment is going to be early on in the last episode
Horn of Winter still has to be mentioned
Not enough Ghost
Love being the theme
3054	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-09	I loved how they can take an asshole (Thorne) and one of my favorite characters (Tormund) and have them fight and make me root for the asshole. Too many complex feelings xD
3055	Otho Bracken	2014-06-09	I liked the long-shot fire FX, looking down at the burning forest from the top of the wall. Fire FX can look pretty bad, but I thought this fire was perfect.Â 
Â 
I've seen some some folks say that fire looked fake. But lemmetellya, I live in San Diego and a few weeks ago we had some fire down here. During that week, I found myself running an errand a little after dusk where the view in front of me was a very large hill, with one of its lower ridgelines totally on fire. I'd say the fire line was about a quarter mile long and the flames were 10-20 feet high all along it. And as it got darker and darker that orange-red blow grew so scary and beautiful and captivating and despairing and dramatic.Â 
Â 
Real fire looks like S04E09 fire. They did good.
3056	The Lord of Cinder	2014-06-09	There was a lot to like.
Â 
That 360 degree shot, though, it's so impressive in so many ways. A battle scene has never felt more real to me. I wonder how long it took to get it right. It still wasn't as impressive as that reeeaaally long tracking shot in True Detective, but then again I can't think of any camerawork that's impressed me as much as that tracking shot.
3057	KalibakCruel	2014-06-09	Yeah the camera work was amazing this episode.
Also Kit this season seems like a different actor. So much confidence, and it showed this episode, especially in the fight scene with Styr, he moved gracefully, it was fun to watch.
Which is another point I think is being undersold, Styr looked absolutely huge and intimidating, especially with that battle axe.
3058	Boxus	2014-06-09	There was a lot to like.

Yeah this! The cinematography was great in this episode. Conveyed the massive scope of things so well. The action was fluid, smooth, easy to follow. In large scale action sequences many directors rely too much on quick cuts and disorientation (some Lord of the Rings scenes come to mind). The approach in this episode was hectic, but still graceful.
I also like brave Sam! Wasn't expecting him to come out of his shell so quickly, but it really worked for me. Similar to what they did with Sansa, but more natural.
3059	RedViperofDorne54	2014-06-09	Thorne (everything)
Jon vs Styr
SamÂ 
Grenn's death
A mammoth
Jon casually shooting Tormund
3060	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	Jon spitting blood in Styr's face and then bashing him with a hammer.
Â 
When Jon fought Karl he got spit in his face and told "He won't win because he doesn't fight dirty"
3061	Alia Atreides	2014-06-09	Sam actually making the first move.
Â 
Ghost tearing shit up.
3062	ShaggyHound	2014-06-09	Don't matter how much of a badass Thorne, Grenn, Sam, Jon, Tormund, Hob(!) and ygritte were this episode, Neill Marshall takes the cake. His camera work was off the charts. Ghosts point of view. The owl cut to the warg. The Giant archer kill followed all the way over the wall. The birdsview shotÂ beginning withÂ Tormund and styr's party charging, flowing over castle black, all the way up the wallÂ ending withÂ the burning forrest and the wildlings, mammoth and giants. The shoulder mounted view of Mags charging toward Grenn & co. The excellent views and cuts during the Tormund vs Thorne and Jon vs Styr fights. The first person shooter arrow shots of ygritte. And best of all the 30 second 360 around the castle with fighting everywhere, this was some of the best camera work i have ever seen in either tv or cinema. Shows that 3D is overrated. Only thing u need to make great looking spectacle is an outstanding director.
3063	Mulled Wino	2014-06-09	The best thing about this episode is that is was waaaay short and ended fast.
Â 
oh, the cinematography was good.
3064	Old Rusty Coin	2014-06-09	Hobb with the butchers cleaver: "Looks like wildling is back on the menu boys!!"


Â
3065	Corvinus	2014-06-09	Jon vs Styr was good - that anvil looked like it really hurt


I wonder how many viewers, Unsullied especially, had a nasty flashback of Oberyn's death when Jon's head met the anvil.
3066	Net-Viper X	2014-06-09	There are so many cool things its hard to name just one, but that boy that killed Igrit was just awesome. That pose he had after shooting her and that nod, total bad ass.
3067	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-09	I especially liked the little nod to book readers having a normal archer fail at even reaching halfway up the wall but then introducing a giant with a bow. That was hilarious.
3068	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	I especially liked the little nod to book readers having a normal archer fail at even reaching halfway up the wall but then introducing a giant with a bow. That was hilarious.



Yeah that was a cool moment. I laughed(out loud) and wondered if it was because D&D read online commenters complaining about the unrealism in the book, or if they only realized normal archers wouldn't work when they started filming the episode.
3069	StrollofShame	2014-06-09	I'm paraphrasing just a touch: "Hell yeah, my plan sucks balls--but what's YOURS?" Jon, grieving, angry, tired, beat to shit, but determined...his bloodshot eyes glowing...still has THIS amusing parting shot in him! I came away from this ep a solid Kit fan. 
Another vote for the panoramic shot. This is TV...WHO DOES THAT? Just kick-ass.
3070	Valyrian_princess	2014-06-09	Jon vs Styr especially when the former used Karl Tanner's spitting trick
Edd and the scythe
Jon taking charge and being a badass
Sam killing the thenn warg
Ghost unleashed
Giant shooting the arrow that sent the man flyingÂ 
Giants & mammoths
Thorne admitting he was wrong and goes out like a boss
Aemon Targaryen
3071	Seneti	2014-06-10	I wonder how many viewers, Unsullied especially, had a nasty flashback of Oberyn's death when Jon's head met the anvil.


Â 
Not sure about Jon's head meeting the anvil, but I certainly had Oberyn flashbacks when that one wildling put a dagger through the eye of a NW brother. It fit perfectly into the scene, but all I could think was "oh gods, not the eyes again..."
3072	Queen of Whores	2014-06-10	I loved Jon's crossbow then kick to the face take-down of Tormund. Easily the most (only) badass thing Jon has done so far in the show.Â

Â
3074	Indigocell	2014-06-10	There was a cool tracking shot of the battle from overhead, I appreciate those because they are difficult to pull off.
Â 
With that in mind, I liked the fight between Jon and Magnar.Â  Particularly the very beginning when Jon attacks 4 times without any camera cut-away tricks.Â  I wish that was more frequent to be honest.Â  
Â 
P.S. My only hope was that we'd get to see a Giant riding a Mammoth, so I'm happy.

Didn't see any teeth flying, so you gotta figure he'd be safe
3076	Indigocell	2014-06-10	The giant chain scythe was pretty cool.Â  I almost wonder if that was thrown in there as a nod to book readers, for the lack of a giant chain in Blackwater.Â  Probably just overthinking it.
3077	Buckwheat	2014-06-10	Everything with Sammy and Maester Aemon in it. Especially the Sammy/Gilly kiss.
3078	Dragon Queen	2014-06-10	Giant scythe scene and that giant firing an arrow all the way to the top of the Wall. That was awesome

I'd say he did a dozen other badass things this episode!
3082	lyanna_maria	2014-06-10	I liked most of the episode but I particularly loved seeing Ghost  I wish we got to see him more, next to Jon.
3083	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-10	Yeah that was a cool moment. I laughed(out loud) and wondered if it was because D&D read online commenters complaining about the unrealism in the book, or if they only realized normal archers wouldn't work when they started filming the episode.


Â 
Neil Marshall said in an interview that he'd realized archers obviously couldn't shoot up 700 feet, so he thought the only way it would work was if a giant were the archer. I think he basically read the battle and got the main points down and thought, well George, you made a 700 foot wall and giants, but you didn't think to have the giants shoot up at the wall!
3084	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	Pretty much everything. It really captured the desperate struggle of the NW I thought.
3085	sennahoj	2014-06-10	The giant chain scythe was pretty cool.Â  I almost wonder if that was thrown in there as a nod to book readers, for the lack of a giant chain in Blackwater.Â  Probably just overthinking it. 


Â 
That's what I thought. So in a way Show-Tyrion helped defend the Wall by having a chain made and sending it to the Night's Watch instead of using it on the Blackwater. 
"Release the Kraken Anchor!"
3086	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	I thought Gilly and her leg of lamb was a nod to the Red Wedding.
3087	Buckbeak	2014-06-10	I was just happy the mammoths and giants were there!Â
3088	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-10	Strange how no one has mentioned Tormund telling the story about him and the bear. Too bad that he got interruptedÂ 


Â 
that was awesome! Especially Ygritte's response: "I know... You know.." Â Way to call him on his crap!
Loved every moment of this episode. When the fade to white came, I was shocked because it seemed like only ten minutes had passed.
Â 
Gold stars to Pyp, Sam, Thorne, Grenn, Edd - for simply being fantastic
Â 
These last two episodes have been an emotional roller coaster, and next week should be the same. Â How long until season 5? Â

Adrenaline can do a lot for you...but he was really dazed when he saw Ygritte, then he had however long to sit there with her. Â He probably has one hell of a headache, though XD

Â 
Maybe you're right. He must have suffered quite a concussion indeed! Still to have watched some sports such as Hockey and American football I can tell you that such a blow on the head, even with an helmet on, more than often result in the player lying on the ground completely knocked-out, adrenaline or not.
Â 
But hey it's an epic Fantasy show!

Â 
Actually, most football and hockey players get concussions without even realizing it and continue to play without incident. Â The symptoms can be immediate or delayed by hours or even days in some cases. Â Most concussions don't knock you out...that's why they used to be called "ringing your bell" because you are dazed, but still conscious and you can still play and make decisions. Â And other concussions can knock you out, but only for a second or two. Â I'm sure that Jon has a concussion, but it doesn't necessarily mean he would be knocked out or even unable to make decisions. Â The adrenaline would just keep him from feeling the pain as intensely right away. Â

3094	Ankou	2014-06-10	The most common concussion symptom with professional athletes is they continue doing what they're doing, and have no recollection of it afterwards. They often puke too, though, just something extra Jon could've done to distract the Thenn.

And his little boyish smile when he saw Ygritte. Happy for the only time in Game of Thrones so far.

3098	A Misunderstood Skagosi	2014-06-10	I was surprised at how much I was rooting for Alliser Thorne, I thought he was brilliant in this episode.Â  Overall I thought it was a good episode, it could always be better.Â  As to Jon's head bouncing off the anvil, I'm a former hockey player who has had 2 confirmed concussions, I will say adrenaline really pushes you through that is as long it doesnt knock you out right away.

The fighting scenes were FAST and beautifully choreographed. GOT fighting scenes usually seems kind of sluggish to me.

I liked the look of the sword play when Jon fought as well. The scene with Sam comforting Pyp struck the right tone for me. So did the tunnel scene.

3109	Bear Island	2014-06-10	I really enjoyed this episode. I'm always happy to see more Edd and Aemon. There were a couple of changes that irked me, but generally I liked it. At first I was a bit 'WTF?' since they were said to only be 100 strong and it seemed like they were losing dozens of men and I was certain that in the book far fewer died, but generally I thought it was an engaging episode. I was so absurdly proud when Jon gave Edd the wall.
The deaths of Pyp and Grenn, and the last stand to hold the gate were really very emotional moments.
I was pleased that they more or less stuck to the script when Ygritte died. Both actors did a wonderful job in that scene. I'd been sure that the little kid was going to shoot her since his line about being the best archer in his village so I wasn't surprised.

Definitely.
Alife Allen SINGLE HANDILY carried the second season. (at least, for me personally)
Not even joking, if it wasn't for his performances in the second season, I would most likely never rewatch that season ever again. He deserved the Emmy, not Dinklage.

Lots of the little touches were so good
+ the cook with his cleaver, doing an 'Under Siege' moment
+ The look Gilly gave Slint
+ Edd taking command
+ The 'whats it like' conversation
+ Tormunds bear story
Etc etc
3119	Janicia	2014-06-11	I liked the callback to Jon and Sam's discussion about virginity in season 1. Â Jon mentioned that he had almost done it with Ros and Sam asked for a description. Â Jon said "she had red hair". Â Sam pried a few more descriptors out of Jon the first time; this time he just asks about her feet in exasperation. Â 
Â 
It was also lovely how the show delved a bit into the power and limitations of the vows. Sam commented that he and Gilly hadn't, but the reasons were about Gilly "she just had a baby, she didn't offer", not about Sam's vows. Â Jon brought up the vows because they're weighing on him. Â Jon and Aemon believe in the vows but Jon at least has trouble following them (not just Ygritte, Jon also ran away); Sam has less reverence and interprets them to fit his life view; and in his moment of death Grenn turns to them. Â 
Â 
I also really liked that they showed Edd's reaction to Jon giving Grenn his assignment. Â Edd and Grenn hung out together throughout season 2 and then were captives together at Craster's Keep in season 3. Â They must have been close. Â After Grenn leaves, Edd gives Jon a long look of "he's going to die but you made the right choice" and then Edd gets back to helping Jon run the wall's defenses. Â

Yeah, it was definitely a callback to show that Jon has learned from his experience. Â They had the other callback to when Jon and Sam were talking about sex:
Â 
"What was she like?"
"She had red hair."
Â 
Except that time, he was talking about Ros. Â I really think they did a great job of connecting all of the elements of the Wall storyline over the past 4 years, and I was really impressed by it.

The book had drama by the hierarchy sending Jon out to meet ManceÂ  and to die.
The show could do some interesting stuff at this point, what , I don't know but doors are open.
And if the show is kind enough to for-shadow, I would not be surprised if Ameon T knows who Jon is.

3155	Jay Stark	2014-07-03	As stated above, tis the badass that is Three finger Hobb.Â 
Honestly we could use some more nights watchmen cast for the upcoming season, given Jons arc. My guess is we'll see new faces arrive with Cotter Pyke andÂ Ser Denys Mallister. I truly Hope Hobbs gets more showtime, though he will probably be a different actor than the one we saw in Episode 9. (Just like how the bloke who played Bowen Marsh in previous seasons, miraculously became Othell Yarwyck.

					
					
							Edited by Jay Stark, 03 July 2014 - 06:13 AM.
3156	Everett Snow	2014-07-03	Given that Stannis, Melisandre, Davos, Selyse and Shireen (all people who have had speaking roles before) have arrived at the Wall and joined the ranks of Jon, Sam, Ser Alliser, Janos Slynt and Maester Aemon, I doubt we'll see any new faces popping up at Castle Black.
Â 
There are already plenty people to juggle, and brothers like Bowen Marsh, Othell Yarwyck and Three-Fingered Hobb are actually already cast as extras who we mostly see in the background, but they are credited on imdb.
Â 
The best you can hope for, with regards to exploring more brothers of the Night's Watch, is seeing short/quick tidbits with them peppered around the background or used to intro a scene between more central characters.

3158	JaegrM	2014-06-14	I posted a comment in the book spoilers thread, but no one seemed to notice it, so I thought it would make a decent thread by itself.
Â 
In the books Bowen Marsh takes a wound in a fight against wildlings. He becomes overly cautious/fearful/anti-wildling because of this wound.
Â 
Marsh seems to have vanished from the show
I seem to recall that in the books, Marsh acts as acting commander until their can be a choosing, something that Thorne has been tasked with in theÂ show.
Â 
In the battle for the wall Thorne takes a wound, and imo having stepped up to fill Marsh's place as acting commander I can't help but wonder if these two character's are being combined.
Â 
Is it possible we could see a changed Thorne next season? Or even in episode 10?
Â 
The talk he had with Jon displaying some respect for one another leads me to believe we may have a more likeable Thorne from now on, which would also fit with Marsh's character, who at first was quite amiable towards Jon.
Â 
It would make Jon's stabbing that much more shocking I think.
3159	IvanDrago	2014-06-24	Based on the rumors for Season 5, you're right. It will be Thorne doing the stabbing.
3160	Jay Stark	2014-06-24	I find it a darn shame that it looks like it is heading that way. They need to put some new NW faces up there. Janos will be gone for the moment almost all are waiting for. They can't have edd do the stabbing, that would break me. Maybe use some of the NW that got some screentime during the battle. NW member 54 or NW steward with boiling water. Â Satin looks to be replaced by Olly. I can only assume with the arrival of the fresh nw like Cotter pyke that they'll include some of the conspirators. If not mabye Thorne on his lonesome doing the stabbing?
3161	The Reckoner	2014-06-24	You know, Thorne wasn't my first candidate for our Bowen. It was Edd. I don't know, it was just some of the expressions his actor pulled during the battle of Castle Black that made me think he'd take that role. Plus D&D have shown that they like to ratchet up the big events from the books: the Red Wedding, with Talisa being stabbed in the Ned repeatedly, and again in Oberyn vs The Mountain when the Mountain exploded Oberyn's head. Edd being the one to take Bowen's place feels like a similar upgrade from the books, albeit one that's more emotional than it its graphic or grotesque.
3162	Arry Lannister	2014-06-28	Â You know, Thorne wasn't my first candidate for our Bowen. It was Edd.
Â 

You know, I can actually see that. Edd crying while coming up to stab Jon. "For the Watch"
3163	protar	2014-06-28	I think Ed will take the role of Dareon. Sad as that would be it conserves characters, Ed is someone you could see snapping and giving up and Ed doesn't really do anything in TWOW.Â 
Â 
Thorne can take on Bowen's role pretty easily and there isn't really any need to give his co-conspirators major speaking roles. They're all minor characters in the book.Â
3164	mindingthesnow	2014-06-19	Once again, theses threads are so long that it is impossible to know if this has been put forth, appologize beforehand.
Â 
So the fight between Jon and Styr was awesome, but wasn't there more to it than met the eye? After they lose their respective weapons, this happens: face against anvil, thrown into fire, picked up, spit in the face (water), hammer to the head = forging of a sword, but not just any sword. Ygritte encounter shows that this sword bends but does not break.

3171	Hound's She-wolf	2014-06-08	PYP and Grenn! What the hell?!
3172	jarl the climber	2014-06-08	I think that its odd that nobody on the Wall has never heard of the fire at will order, I guess nock, draw, loose does sound cool and commanderly but it was a little silly after the first volley.Â
3173	lostinwesteros	2014-06-08	They wasted time with the Ygitte scene saying she'll put an arrow in anyone who goes after Jon but she just stood there while Styr went after him.

Yeah,,I thought there was lots of time wasted on Ygritte, and I thought her dying scene with Jon was weak.  Also, what was the deal with the Thenn warging the owl?  I saw no point in that.

3174	new djinn	2014-06-08	Why did they let the Giant and mammoth get close to the gate without raining arrow on them? Fire at will is to modern a command? Why so many people on the Wall if the castle is the most vulnerable side? Grenn & co. are trying to stop someone in a portcullis and they choose axes and swords instead of spears and bows? Why keep Ghost locked up? No Stannis.
3175	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-08	I thought the battle was not as intense as it should have been. The episode seemed all over the place and not really epic like I was expecting.
3176	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-06-08	Why the dude who yells "Load, aim and fire!  cant fire also his own weapon?
3177	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-08	Is it just me, or was EVERY SINGLE LINE of dialogue in this episode absolutely cringeworthy and horrible?
3178	Cas Stark	2014-06-08	I only noticed that Maester Aemon is usually written better, and too much Sam. But I guess since they killed off almost every named repeating NW character, and soon there will be no one left but Jon and Edd, maybe they were making the most of who is left.
3179	Dain Storm	2014-06-08	No Satin or Donal. I knew they weren't going to be in the show, but they are missed.

3183	King Cheops	2014-06-08	This is probably the first time I feel like the show has really messed up in its adaptation. Â Did they seriously think that the cliffhanger of Jon going out to meet Mance is more poignant than Stannis riding in and saving the day? Â Horrible pacing and almost no emotion in the whole thing. Â There's three main beats from the battle and they pooched all three. Â I'm not a fan of Jon or Stannis but this was seriously the only time they were cool in the books. Â Now episode 10 is going to be crowded beyond belief. Â I'm seriously starting to hear sharks and water skis.

3185	eumaies	2014-06-08	I'm still watching this nonsense, but...
Â 
If you're going to spend a whole damn episode on a battle, think you could make it involve some actual intelligent interesting tactics?Â  Or perhaps set up some drama preceding this through the whole stupid season?Â  No, it's just a full episode battle that's hardly been prepped the whole season, in terms of its relevance.
Â 
Think you could actually CGI show hundred and thousands of enemies?Â 
Â 
Think you could do anything less cliched with all the bravado and the heroic speeches and the swordfights that last forever?Â  bah.
3186	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-08	My one problem with this episode. They cut the episode 8 minutes early, and they couldn't have given Tormund's bear fucking story its full, unadulterated glory?
3187	RoamingRonin	2014-06-08	Holding the Wall is an easy job. Just tell people "Knock, Draw, Loose" as loudly and dramatically as possible and then pass command to someone else.That's all it takes.

Just had this conversation with Unsullied. I'm like "we're not supposed to completely cheer for the NW because the wildings are running from the Others, and they're going to kill them and their families".

I never cared much for Ygritte in the books either; but I thought that TV-Ygritte had poor chemistry with TV-Jon (he's got more chemistry with Sam than he has with Ygritte). Â The actress was trying hard, and I've seen her on Downton Abbey and thought she did very well; but I couldn't stand the character of Ygritte or the writing for her. Â I thought that young boy was very brave, considering how scared he had been earlier in the battle and how he'd witnessed his village and parents massacred by Wildlings, to avenge his father by killing Ygritte. Â
3194	eumaies	2014-06-08	Also:Â  Someday I will watch a fantasy battle scene where the tactics aren't reduced to:
"Should we fire at the enemy?"
Â 
"But I'm scared.Â  And I was just going to stand here?"
Â 
"Don't worry, somebody told us fighting is worth doing, so do it!"
Â 
"Oh thank god because I wasn't going to fight without being convinced first."
Â 
Someday I will watch a fantasy battle scene like the ones in GRRM's books, where the smart good guys plan a clever trap on a bridge to stop the Thenns.Â  And the leaders don't all get killed.Â  And people send Jon to go do a suicidal thing rather than him sending himself out on a hopeless stupid mission.

So true. Hopefully Mance will mention the Others next episode, because the writers apparently forgot about the invincible undead army pressing at their heels
3196	Hound's She-wolf	2014-06-08	I expected Ghost kick some ass. Not just to stop and eat one Thenn before disappearing again.
3197	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-08	Next week's episode will be the last one I watch in most likelihood. I hope they can get the Stannis stuff right. Probably too much to expect though. It will get lost in the shuffle of Tyrion killing Shae and the usual badly acted Khaleesi nonsense.
3198	BearQueen87	2014-06-08	Um. Where's Stannis????? Obviously that's the biggest WTF of this episode.

Yeah I kind of really wanted to see some Stannis awesomeness. Now his arrival will be just one of multiple storylines next week.
3201	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-08	Now she died, I will give my opinion.
Â 
I love Y/J relationship in books, because it's a nice contrast: Jon is sexually innocent. Ygritte isn't. But she's quite innocent about "life" in a way Jon isn't. They kinda portrayed this when she tells "oh, yeah... we'll climb the wall and we kill everybody" and Jon tells her the harsh true: Westeros will pass you over if you try. The good thing about Ygritte is that she's a simple woman, exactly what Jon wanted, a simple life with a wife and kids, but at the moment, he didn't know he wanted that.
Â 
showYgritte is only there for a reason: "I'm so badass because HBO wants to show woman are so badass too and you know nothing, Jon Snow, except that thing you do with the mouth". And when Jon is gone, she does nothing but say "omg I so hate him because he's soooo mean" like a 13 years old sour girl who can't get over her boyfriend left her.
Â 
So, yes. She's, IMO, one of the characters "butchered", but as she isn't that popular, isn't something that people actually notices. I'm glad she's gone.
3202	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-08	Careful there, some might say that's....PURIST talk. Â  If you think a change doesn't make sense, you are an eeeeevil PURIST and you should just STOP WATCHING.

Â 
Â 
As I remember from the books, there were moments when the Wildlings, at least some of them, treated Jon well, and seemed to be fairly decent people. Â Mance Rayder took Jon into his tent, played music, introduced him to Dalla; etc. Â But on the show, all of them glowered at Jon, made fun of him, threatened him and bullied him; except for Ygritte who at least was fairly obvious about wanting to hang around with him. Â Why on earth would Jon feel any empathy or kindness for these people?
Â 
I don't remember the Wildlings slaughtering a village full of innocent people just going about their business in the book; did I forget it or was it another made-up scene for TV?
3204	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-08	Only a single nitpick, Pyp's death was kinda lame-ish. He didn't have to die, unlike Grenn.
3205	The Roose is Loose	2014-06-08	Only 102 NW defenders (per the dialogue last week)?  I'll have to count how many were killed on-screen when I re-watch (if I can bring myself to), but I'm pretty sure it was 30+.  It makes no sense that they defeated Tormund and Styr's raiders in hand-to-hand combat given the numbers as presented in the show.  Dumb.
Ygritte's death loses a lot with John not killing her (or thinking that he does).  That was an unfortunate change.  
I thought the logical conclusion of this episode would be the arrival of Stannis - an odd choice, and a lot to cram into next week.  Maybe they thought it would be too much like Tywin arriving at the end of Blackwater?
I was underwhelmed with this episode.

Â 
Well, I don't think they describe any of their raids just because we don't have any POV characters who see them, but the wildlings DO raid villages, kill people, steal their supplies and kidnap women in the books. Â It's talked about second hand a decent amount.
3207	JonInVa	2014-06-08	Oberyn had his teeth smashed out by a big man, on his back, with one punch. Jon Snow gets his face smashed into an anvil - an anvil for crissakes - by a beast of a large Thenn and doesn't so much as chip a tooth. Makes for action but ridiculous really. His cheek bone would be shattered. Period.

Jon doesn't kill her or think he kills her in the books. Â In fact, he specifically examines the arrow to find that it wasn't one of his own. Â He has no idea who actually killed her in the books, she just gets hit by some random arrow.
3209	The Sword of the Night	2014-06-08	It was killing me that they let the giant and mammoth close and just watched. 
Don't hate the kid as it added a little more to ygritte's death.
Interesting they made Thorne a little more likeable, well see how long it lasts. 
Worried about how they pull of next week in 55 minutes. 
Also was mad the episode was so short
3210	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-09	Only 102 NW defenders (per the dialogue last week)?

I didn't like how Tywin arrived in the Blackwater episode, felt hella sudden and rushed. I'd rather have a decent length of conversation between mance and Jon and THEN Â Stannis. Not sure we would have gotten that whti how much time was left in the episode.
3211	The Sword of the Night	2014-06-09	Also wish john could kill a notable character w some poise. I know he wasn't an all out badass in the books but he just seems to barely get by. With Locke and Magnar, he's gotten very lucky.

3214	zaphodbrx	2014-06-09	I'm starting to notice a pattern with bad episodes. They all start out bad.
Â 
This one had an insane amount of filler at the beginning. Jon discussing sex talk Sam, more Sam & Gilly bull shit, Master Aemon was ok but still filler.Â 
Â 
And DA FUCK! Why did the episode just end like that. What just happened..
3215	Aether	2014-06-09	Most of my nitpicks are pretty small for this episode. Â Biggest one is probably the fact that Janos Slynt is like a cartoon character. Â He's like the bumbling coward from a bad comedy movie, not a dangerous asshole like he is in the book.
3216	Simon Steele	2014-06-09	Why did mance only have 2 giants and one mammoth? He could've won the war with three giants and two mammoths.

Â

Â 
This is one of my biggest nitpicks as well. They could have done the entire battle for the Wall in one episode, Stannis coming in at the end. But they started the episode with stuff that wasn't needed--did we need sex talk with Jon and Sam (no). Did we need Sam and Gilly (gods no). Maester Aemon is always great but it could have been cut or reduced in order to get to the battle faster. And then Ygritte's scene with the Theens and Tormund before the battle when she's talking about arrows and killing Jon. We get it. You're scorned and angry and you plan on killing him. We don't need to be reminded that Jon Snow is on your list of men to kill.
3218	Newstar	2014-06-09	It was such a little thing, but when Tormund is supposedly being dragged up the staircase by the NW guys to be put in chains, you can clearly see the actor climbing the steps backwards. Now, Tormund's actor is a big guy, so it would be a tall order for two men to drag him up the steps like a sack of potatoes without him helping them, but the visual effect was a little ridiculous, as he was readily climbing the steps even as he was cursing Jon Snow.
Â 
Overall, the episode felt too much like Blackwater Part Deux. If Stannis had shown up at the end to save them just as Tywin and the Tyrell forces did in Blackwater, it would have put the comparison over the top.
3219	Ser Hugh BuckweII	2014-06-09	Honestly do not know what the fuck D&D were thinking when they decided to kill off Pyp and Grenn. Jon's storyline is screwed now.
3220	Aether	2014-06-09	Honestly do not know what the fuck D&D were thinking when they decided to kill off Pyp and Grenn. Jon's storyline is screwed now.


lol what? Â Grenn and Pyp do pretty much nothing in the books. Â Most of his meaningful interactions are with Sam and other high ranking members of the watch, wildlings, Stannis, etc.
3221	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-09	I just thought of something else, though it's more like a "oh, I wish they had done that" than a nitpick, but I wanted Styr and some other Thenns to survive and get killed by Stannis' men in the next episode. Killing those cannibal fuckers would have earned Stan a few points with the Unsullied
3222	TheCaptainSargey	2014-06-09	Fire arrows.Â 
It's a night battle, and the fire is for viewing pleasure. Regular arrows would've been sufficient.
3223	jmr1917	2014-06-09	- First 15 minutes of filler
- Looked like there were 200 wildlings north of the Wall, 5 of whom tried climbing the wall, and another handful escorted 2 giants and 1 mammoth to the gate. Jon Snow explains it away by saying Mance was just testing the defenses, but... c'mon.
- No fire at will. Letting the giants/mammoth get that close and only attacking them twice.
- The ending?!
Â 
I thought Ygritte's death and Alliser were both solid, but I honestly don't see how they can wrap up everything in episode 10 (Tyrion, Bran, Arya, Sansa maybe, now the Wall?)
This episode felt like further proof that the writers hate Stannis.
3224	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-09	lol what? Â Grenn and Pyp do pretty much nothing in the books. Â Most of his meaningful interactions are with Sam and other high ranking members of the watch, wildlings, Stannis, etc.


Â 
Yeah, Jon sends them away to other castles in aDwD anyway so it's not like they're featured a lot. StillÂ
3225	mothbomb	2014-06-09	Â This episode was basically a watered down action film with alot of 4th tier characters, and only two people we really enjoy the Point of view from.Â 
Â 
Jon Snow: it felt like he was much more important in the book. the reason why is because in the books he returns to castle black fresh off an injury and is barely healed when he has to hold the castle from attack. He wasnt surrounded by commanders from my recollection. This adaptation just sort of took far too long in the series to happen, and our complacency with the storyline is now significant.
Â  Â Jon Snow's character is supposed to really be the focus of this by showing too many of the different points of view it becomes hard to know what your supposed to care about.
Â 
Sam: I actually like sam and gilly, and especially was happy when sam dropped an F bomb. that was cool. I was hoping sam would have played a more heroic role somewhere, maybe him killing ygritte, or him killing the Thenn instead of Jon perhaps with a dragonglass spear again which would have been amusing to see how it would look killing a normal enemy.
Â 
The people I dont care about: Tormund, random owl guy, dude who dies in tunnell, dude who got arrow thru the neck, cannibal dbag #1,2,3, janos slynt (thank god he dies eventually), Alliser.
Â 
The people I do care about: Stannis, Mance, Jon Snow, Sam, Davos, Aemon, Ygritte, Ghost,Â 
Â 
Jon should have probably met mance, and stannis arrives, but that would make it like a movie, possibly 66 minutes or more. and clearly they want the finale to be the "GRAND RESOLUTION" for:
Â 
the wall, jon and mance, stannis, arya ditching hound, tyrion/tywin/shae, bran children of forest, dany's dragons, Lady Stoneheart is looking more and more unlikely in 66 minutes,Â 
Â 
Â
3226	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-09	lol what? Â Grenn and Pyp do pretty much nothing in the books. Â Most of his meaningful interactions are with Sam and other high ranking members of the watch, wildlings, Stannis, etc.


Â 
Book-wise it doesn't matter much. Show-wise it does. They did a lot in the show when it comes to the NW.
Â 
Tho, their deaths will most likely not have an effect on Jon's progression, but it won't be as fun and interesting to watch.

Tormund was on a berzerker rage. It would have been great to see how they subdued him.Â 
Â 
Anyone have a death count for NW members? 102 NW to start off this episode I could have sworn Tormund himself killed 100+ NW lol
Â 
The flow up to the end seemed pretty bleak if you were Unsullied. They should have shown Ghost changing the tide of battle and that would have made more sense...
Â 
Jon could have been holding Ygritte in his arms with Ghost pouncing on every Wilding around them

As much as I am in mourning for the loss of Grenn and Pyp from the show, they basically did disappear from the books ... so this is probably the best way for them to go for non-book-readers.
Saddest scenes of the entire episode for me.Â
3230	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-09	I just remember... Mance was in the episode???? Because he's like.. important, right?

3231	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-09	My one nitpick is i would have changed Â the way Ygritte and Jon met, mostly the holding of Ygritte after she died. Â There was still a battle going on and that's a good way to catch a axeto head.
3232	ohpooratlas	2014-06-09	I feel like just posting a link to Angry Got Fan's twitter, because those would pretty much be my nitpicks.
Â 
No, but seriously ...
Â 
If I'm throwingÂ out the whole Stanis not showing up at all (and the fact that the siege should have been started several episodes ago so this episode could have had a proper ending) I would say my biggest nitpick is that the episode built up "the calm before the storm" way too much.
Â 
Oh. And the fact that Grenn ad Pyp and about fifty other members of the already paltry Night's Watch died and now I really don't know who is left to defend it, even with Stanis's army coming soon.
Â 
I don't think I've ever nitpicked an episode this much. I really had such high hopes.

3233	tmug	2014-06-09	This was definitely a "Jon Snow" episode - not surprisingly. These directors know the Ending so I think this episode is a definite "tell" from GRRM about his vision of these characters. If you look at it, this is very "Danarys Targarean"-esqe depiction of how one comes to rise to power to rule. Her story had a similar treatment from the TV series...
Â 
The most memorable scene for me was when he ordered Grenn, pretty much, to his death at the Gate. Jon "knew" what he was telling Grenn to do, Grenn "knew" what was going to happen but he did so without question. Jon's reaction to seeing Grenn at the end was very important IMO because that is what leaders/rulers should feel when their friends/comrades/subjects/whatevers die. The exact thing that Stannis does not which is why I am kind of glad he didn't take the glory away from Jon this episode a la Tywin/Tyrion at Blackwater.Â
3234	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-09	As much as I am in mourning for the loss of Grenn and Pyp from the show, they basically did disappear from the books ... so this is probably the best way for them to go for non-book-readers.
Saddest scenes of the entire episode for me.Â  


Â 
Oh, I definitely agree. Giving them badass deaths was a great choice, especially if they were already planing on lowering their screen-time and what-not.
3235	Ours if the Fury	2014-06-09	I liked the episode - although no stannis pisses me off!!!!
3236	Aether	2014-06-09	I just remember... Mance was in the episode???? Because he's like.. important, right?
Â 
Maybe because HBO has done such a great job with mance... is that I didn't even remember if he was there.


Â 
Yeah, it would've been cool to see them switching back and forth between Mance giving commands to the wildlings and Jon/Alliser giving commands to the NW. Â The way this show has treated army leaders though, I'm just happy that Mance wasn't the first dude at the base of the wall with an icepick going "COME TAKE THIS FUCKING WALL WITH ME!!!!"
3237	of man and wolf	2014-06-09	Â 
Tormund was on a berzerker rage. It would have been great to see how they subdued him.Â 
Â 
Anyone have a death count for NW members? 102 NW to start off this episode I could have sworn Tormund himself killed 100+ NW lol
Â 
The flow up to the end seemed pretty bleak if you were Unsullied. They should have shown Ghost changing the tide of battle and that would have made more sense...
Â 
Jon could have been holding Ygritte in his arms with Ghost pouncing on every Wilding around them


Or even better, and I was hoping it might happen..but when Ygritte is just standing there with the arrow notched at Jon, Ghost just comes charging at her from the side and tears her apart right in front of Jon.
3238	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	Based off my facebook newsfeed, seems like every unsullied I know LOVED this episode.
"Best episode of Game of Thrones yet, tbh" is one status.
Ugh. Someone needs to invent a timemachine and go back in time and shoot hitler D&D.
3239	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	Also The AV Club's "Game of Thrones (Newbies)" just gave this episode an A- and the "Game of Thrones (Experts)" just gave this episode a B+.
What the flying fuck. The Newbies review, maybe I get that, but the Experts(aka bookreader) review too? What the hell.
Edit to add: Although one of my unsullied friends also posted "Yay Ingrid's finally dead." Lol @ three seasons of a character, and people still don't know their name.

It's no different than when BOOK READERS still spell Cersei Cercei, or Ramsay like "Ramsey"

John Snow.
3242	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	There's a difference between forgetting how a character's name is spelled by one letter, and thinking someone's name is completely different than it actually is.
I met someone once who actually thought Asha/Yara was named "Arya Greyjoy" because of how similar Yara and Arya are in the way they're pronounced in the show. Whoops.
Silly things that make me cringe.
3243	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-06-09	Just 'cause you didn't like the episode doesn't mean everyone else is batshit insane.

This is my only nitpick with this episode. I bet some of Unsullied think Tormund is the king. It's especially a waste because Ciaran Hinds is such a good actor.Â

Â 
I highly doubt it. Unless they've gone deaf during all the Mance-related discussions. Hell, Tormund even said they're waiting for Mance's orders.
3247	greywindsrage	2014-06-09	I expected Ghost kick some ass. Not just to stop and eat one Thenn before disappearing again.


Â 

All that CGI for the giants and they couldn't give us three more kills from Ghost?
3248	siknes	2014-06-09	Damn tmug
Â 
That was a great opinion, and true as far a character development for Jon. Which has been this season's purpose.Â 
Â 
I thought the final Ygrette scene showed she wanted toÂ join him more than kill him. Enhancing the "I am your's and you are mine," between themselves before the climb, AKAÂ marriage.
Â 
It is too bad people don't get itÂ exactly like the books, otherwise we wouldn't have a show now,Â because HBO would have dropped it like they did 'Deadwood' and 'Rome'
Â 
Although Deadwood was dropped because there was no stability/planning during production, and the damn planes kept interrupting filming on set. Plus Milch(God, SchweringerÂ had awesome dialogue and soliloquies) Â always wanted to change(Writing) things at the end, from what I heard.Â  A God damn shame we never got toÂ see the end ofÂ the Gold Tycoon's character, G. McCoy's character.Â Â Â Â Â
3249	Mark Antony	2014-06-09	This is my only nitpick with this episode. I bet some of Unsullied think Tormund is the king. It's especially a waste because Ciaran Hinds is such a good actor.Â 
Yup damn shame.
3250	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-09	Â 
I highly doubt it. Unless they've gone deaf during all the Mance-related discussions. Hell, Tormund even said they're waiting for Mance's orders.


Â 
In shows like GoT, you can't "hear". You have to "see". Mance wasn't even in the episode.
3251	Grbauc	2014-06-09	- First 15 minutes of filler
- Looked like there were 200 wildlings north of the Wall, 5 of whom tried climbing the wall, and another handful escorted 2 giants and 1 mammoth to the gate. Jon Snow explains it away by saying Mance was just testing the defenses, but... c'mon.
- No fire at will. Letting the giants/mammoth get that close and only attacking them twice.
- The ending?!
Â 
I thought Ygritte's death and Alliser were both solid, but I honestly don't see how they can wrap up everything in episode 10 (Tyrion, Bran, Arya, Sansa maybe, now the Wall?)
This episode felt like further proof that the writers hate Stannis.


Stannis is not a main character.. He's part of the filler while Danny / Jon develop into the characters that they need to be to finish off the story..Â 
Â 
D@D know the basic ending do you really think with the limited screen time that they have, that they will develop characters that are not necessary to the main plot?Â 
Â 
That's why books are Soooo much better then movies or tv series do to the fact that the author can develop minor characters so much easier. Along with the fact we can get so many more characters in books then movie/tv we would be way overwhelmed..
Â 
The Tv series and the book are two different animals its to easy to be disappointed by the tv series comparing it to the books.. I've gotten to the point where i expect things to be pale compared to the book and my expectations have gone way down and im really enjoying the tv series so much more now..Â
3252	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Â 
I highly doubt it. Unless they've gone deaf during all the Mance-related discussions. Hell, Tormund even said they're waiting for Mance's orders.


I just think it's probably hard enough for Unsullied to keep track of all the characters who are actually on screen, let alone only appeared once or twice and is just refereed to from time to time. Â
3253	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	Stannis is definitely NOT a filler character.
If anything, he's a decoy to make us THINK he's a filler character(particularly in books 3/4) when in actuality, he's probably one of the most important characters of the entire series.
3254	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-09	Stannis is definitely NOT a filler character.
If anything, he's a decoy to make us THINK he's a filler character(particularly in books 3/4) when in actuality, he's probably one of the most important characters of the entire series.


I think D&D read the books a bit differently. They definitely see him as the villain.Â
3255	Guard of the Rainking	2014-06-09	I never imagined that D&D could fuck this up, but they did it. To think that I was stupid enough to believe that they would stop the character butchering. Sure the scene is going to be in episode 10 woopde wreaking doo. That's like having Jaime's bath scene in the same episode as the Red Wedding. And it's going to have minimal screentime, we'll get no Winterfell offer this season if ever, everyone forgets that Stannis even saved the Wall and it might even be directed by Alex fucking Graves.
3256	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-09	Man, I've wanted Stannis so damn badly, turning the tide of battle at Sunrise, making a glorious charge. They could have cut the episode right at the charge, with trumpets in background and knights chasing the wildlings down. And then Stannis stops in front of the gate, lifts his visor and looks down to Jon, who is speechless. That would have been awesome, but they wasted that option. Why????????

3258	Queen of Whores	2014-06-09	I have a fair few things to complain about: Lack of scale or epic feel, no real tension, lack of emotional depth (for me personally at least), a lot of cringeworthy dialogue, flat-out shitty Sam and Gilly scenes, etc. But the thing I really want to discuss, is
Â 
NO FUCKING STANNIS!!!
Â 
I checked, and this has been the shortest episode of Game of Thrones ever. They had ten minutes already left to put Jon's meeting with Mance and the arrival of Stannis, and they could have taken out the dumb Jon/Sam talk about sex. That would have given them almost fifteen minutes extra time! I understand that the battle spans over more than one night, but when you spend eight bloody episodes building UP to the battle, I expect that was done so the episode could be a complete package, not have some cheap and lazy cliffhanger at the end. The battle ended suddenly, and there was no proper climax.Â 
Â 
Now the result of this dumb decision is that Stannis' most heroic and cheer worthy moment will just be an afterthought, quickly wrapped up so we can get more Khaleesi and the funny dwarf, cause gods forbid Stannis gets any meaningful time dedicated to just him.
Â 
I think we Stannis fans have now officially earned the right to be pissed the fuck off at D&D, right...?

Totally. Even more infuriating is how some smartypants are like: "Stannis fans stop your bitching he's going to be in the next episode".
3260	gvewolf243	2014-06-09	Damn, didn't expect Pyp and Grenn to die.Â  Â  Atleast Tormund is alive. Ygritte deserved an arrow just for cutting off Tormund's bear story.Â   Didn't like cliffhanger, that they've ended up with. I wanted to get ,, Stannis ! Stannis ! Stannis ! '' in this episode. More badass Ghost scenes, would be good.
3261	Sigrunn	2014-06-09	My expectations for this one were not too high as I'm not intrigued by The North and its storyline. I could watch an episode that's solely about King's Landing or Meereen, although not everyone would fancy this notion. I say that it's better to keep the multiple storylines structure.
Â 

Oberyn had his teeth smashed out by a big man, on his back, with one punch. Jon Snow gets his face smashed into an anvil - an anvil for crissakes - by a beast of a large Thenn and doesn't so much as chip a tooth. Makes for action but ridiculous really. His cheek bone would be shattered. Period.

I noticed this as well.

Â This! The battle had no climax, it wasn't boring, but Stannis could have saved the day with a heroic charge and this would have been the best ending to the episode.
3263	Sun	2014-06-09	Pyp's death affected me a lot more than Ygritte's, which surprised me. Pyp's death was beautifully done, made me cry, while Ygritte's death was underwhelming and emotionally slight. I'm not sure who's to blame for this, but I'm inclined to lay it at Kit's feet. Â Although he gave a surprisingly good performance throughout the episode, in that moment he fell short. I just didn't feel his pain. He just looked constipated to me.Â
3264	gvewolf243	2014-06-09	Â 
Just had this conversation with Unsullied. I'm like "we're not supposed to completely cheer for the NW because the wildings are running from the Others, and they're going to kill them and their families". But HBO hasn't really portrayed that, the wildings are only for the "WANNA KILL CROWS!!!". Fock, HBO. Fock
3265	SkaggCannibal	2014-06-09	Stannis scenes got replaced with Sam&Gilly scenes, now who doesn't love that.
Â 
Does anyone care about Sam and Gilly??? Or Sam talking about not having had sex? Haven't we got that already dozens of times??? That first scene on top of the wall, was I the only one thinking "don't care don't care don't care"? I actually found it a bit creepy when he said "you're the closest thing I'm ever gonna get to blablablalbla". I am starting to really hate Sam.
Â 
Â 
So, where you think Stannis's moment will be placed in the next episode? I think right before a Dany scene. Or maybe right before Tyrion kills Tywin, we wouldn't want the audience to get invested into Stannis now would we.
3266	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	Honestly, I would not be surprised if D&D only read through the books once - and then just use spark notes when writing episodes.
The blame is often unfairly laid upon the actors(particularly Kit Harrington and Sophie Turner and Emilia Clarke get this REAL bad) - but honestly, the show's always had a great cast of actors and decent directors/special effects geeks/action scene maker whatevers.
It's the writing which is fucking horrible. From the cringeworthy, painful dialogue to the overarching story writing. Ugh,
(I will note, as I did in the positive thread, that Alliser Thorne was a real delight in this episode. His lines were all good, his delivery was spot on, and his fight with Tormund thrilling.)

3268	Sun	2014-06-09	Another nitpick:
Â 
The NW looked to be more than 100 in number. By the seeming death count on the Wall an in Castle Black it looked like there shouldn't be more than 10 NWmen left alive.Â
3269	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-06-09	I think the reason the Stannis scenes got moved to another episode is that  actions scenes take forever to shoot and Neil Marshall probably could only shoot this many scenes in his schedule. It was probably already the episode with the longest shooting schedule without the Stannis scenes.
3270	FacelessMan7	2014-06-09	It ended and my family just kinda collectively went "wait...that's it?"
Â 
The direction was fine, but man, the script was so weak. Worst ep of the seasom for sure.
Â 
-The opening 15 minutes were so terribly scripted.
Â 
-Not even one scene with Stannis.
Â 
-Why didn't we see Mance at least giving orders?
Â 
-Why didn't they shoot the mammoth/giants down much earlier?
Â 
-This whole battle was NOT built up at all. "Oh hey these wildlings are coming and OH SHIT THEY'RE HERE AHHH"
Â 
-No real suspense at all

Â 
Â 
Â 
the Wildlings are at camp, showering Jon with gifts and the songs of their people Jon smiles, enjoying this valuable cultural experience a cry is heard in the distance suddenly, the camera pans to the thundering stampede of a thousand men on horses we see Stannis driving the men to fight by cracking a flaming whip "FORM RANKS, YOU DOGS" in the distance, Wildling women and children are burning, the soundtrack a high screaming wail "TAKE THE WOMEN FOR OUR THRALLS," Stannis shouts, "FEED THE BABES TO THE FIRES" "Yes," cries Davos, "R'hllor hungers!" Jon looks on, his face grief-stricken "Seven save us," Jon whispers, "he's even making the women and children pay the Iron price!"

>Heated words between Mance and Jon
>They come to a peace treaty of some sort
>Stannis comes in and ruins said peace
So it'll end up making Stannis look like a villain. Ugh.
3274	KalibakCruel	2014-06-09	I don't get it, I like Stannis and wanted to see him, but I didn't want him to basically show up rushed like Tywin did, which I thought was bad. 
I agree with the people wondering sit Mance, at least one scene or two would've been good. But whatever, taking the episode by itself without comparing it to the books, I liked it overall and it was thoroughly entertaining.

You forgot to gave credits.
Written by yours truly: D&D.
3276	Queen of Whores	2014-06-09	So I rewatched the 4x10 promo, paying attention to the Wall bits, and I believe Mance says (even though it's hard to hear him), "we'll kill every last man in Castle Black," and there's also a shot of someone holding a dagger to Jon's throat. I'm hoping beyond hope at this point that that is when Stannis arrives, essentially saving Jon's life. Because I swear, if Stannis arrives and starts killing wildlings when Jon and Mance reach a peaceful agreement, I will actually be so fucking done with this show. Even though by now I should not be optimistic at all with this show, I will try to be for the last time.Â

3277	MarieAntoinette	2014-06-09	Overall I iked this episode quite a lot. I was expecting Stannis arrival as the ending scene though, I'm not even a Stannis fan, but that was disappointing. IAnother small nitpick, the NW-men were dropping like flies during the fight, I feel like half of them are dead already. Also, I expected Ygrittes death to be more emotional. I was not that moved by that scene. i felt more for Ellaria when Oberyn died last episode.
3278	Allison of Tarth	2014-06-09	* Watching the mammoth and giants approach, doing nothing
* Tormund's unconvincing swordplay.  Seriously, go watch it again it's really terrible and clumsy.
* Jon Snow's face not being caved in by that anvil hit
* Infinite supply of NW redshirts (blackshirts?) after it's been clearly established how few men they have
* Surgical strike Ghost: get in, bite face, exit stage left.   I wanted to see him run wild the way Grey Wind is described as doing during battle.
* No sense of the larger structure of the fight.  Random, convenient cuts back and forth between top of the Wall, wildlings running at the forest edge, and the battle in the yard as necessary to drive the character moments, but no overarching structure to the battle.  It simply went on until all the points were covered then ended for no apparent reason. 
* Stannis crybabies infesting this board

3280	Raksha 2014	2014-06-09	Overall I iked this episode quite a lot. I was expecting Stannis arrival as the ending scene though, I'm not even a Stannis fan, but that was disappointing. IAnother small nitpick, the NW-men were dropping like flies during the fight, I feel like half of them are dead already. Also, I expected Ygrittes death to be more emotional. I was not that moved by that scene. i felt more for Ellaria when Oberyn died last episode.


Â 
Â 
I felt a lot more for Ellaria at Oberyn's death than I did for Jon and Ygritte. Â Not just because Oberyn is a favorite character of mine in book and TV show; but because the two characters like each other as well as lust for/love each other and convey an onscreen feeling of long association; as if they've been together for years and are happy with each other and their arrangement. Â And when Ellaria kissed Oberyn before the duel; they seemed to physically fit together. Â I didn't get that much passion from Jon & Ygritte, despite the supposed intensity of their doomed love affair; I found them an awkward pairing.
Â 
There certainly don't seem to be many NW left. Â They'll have to draft the little boy who killed Ygritte, and, at this rate, Gilly's infant son.
3281	Vesemir	2014-06-09	I don't get why they released their big Scythe, which surely took HOURS to get it there, on 4 people climbing the wall? Wouldn't it be better to wait for at least one or two hundred? Idk...
3282	Valandui	2014-06-09	Most of my nitpicks are pretty small for this episode. Â Biggest one is probably the fact that Janos Slynt is like a cartoon character. Â He's like the bumbling coward from a bad comedy movie, not a dangerous asshole like he is in the book.


Â 

I don't know.Â  I always pictured him as an inept cartoon character.Â  He only did stuff when Thorne told him to.Â
3283	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Yeah, honestly, I expect the scene to go like this
>Heated words between Mance and Jon
>They come to a peace treaty of some sort
>Stannis comes in and ruins said peace
So it'll end up making Stannis look like a villain. Ugh.


Mance in the preview "I will kill every man in Castle Black". You guys are going to get your heroic Stannis moment.Â
3284	teemo	2014-06-09	lol it was so predictable that Jon was going to take over when Janos stepped in for Alliser. I just knew they would have Jon and Ygritte somehow confront one another before her death, and it was really cheesy, like something out of a bad movie likeÂ Troy, wait - didn't David Benioff write that? Â It's so stupid that Jon is willingly going on a suicide mission rather than being forced to. Â Bad episode.
3285	Khaleesi did nothing wrong	2014-06-09	Honestly, I would not be surprised if D&D only read through the books once - and then just use spark notes when writing episodes.
The blame is often unfairly laid upon the actors(particularly Kit Harrington and Sophie Turner and Emilia Clarke get this REAL bad) - but honestly, the show's always had a great cast of actors and decent directors/special effects geeks/action scene maker whatevers.
It's the writing which is fucking horrible. From the cringeworthy, painful dialogue to the overarching story writing. Ugh,
(I will note, as I did in the positive thread, that Alliser Thorne was a real delight in this episode. His lines were all good, his delivery was spot on, and his fight with Tormund thrilling.)


Yeah, D&D are hack writers all things considered. There is aÂ reallyÂ apparent difference in quality of dialogue and plotting between the scenes they lift almost straight from the books, and the ones they choose to design on their own.Â

3294	Veltigar	2014-06-09	50 FUCKING MINUTES? REALLY? HAVE I BEEN WAITING ALL THIS TIME FOR A MEASLY FUCKING 50 MINUTES! 20 OF WHICH DIDN'T EVEN CONTAIN ACTION! WHERE THE FUCK IS <b>STANNIS</b>/end rant
Â 
Now, more seriously. This episode was way to short. Especially, since we get so much time wasted om Sam (I like John Bradley, but Sam isn't the character we need to be focussing on right now).
Â 
I had hoped for a less stagy feel to the fights, didn't think it was very convincing as a battle. But, as far as stage fights go, it was pretty good. Although I wished more people would have taken Tormund's example (can't spell the actor's name), his fighting might have been unrealistic but at least he was so in to it that it didn't feel that way.
Â 
Hated Jon vs. Styr. The only positive about that is that they didn't have Ygritte save him before getting wasted herself. I swear everytime Jon fights against a named character, he's a dork who get's his ass handed to him, but when fighting no names he's God's gift to warfare... Just for this once I would have liked to see Jon owning his opponent, without losing his sword or a miraculous save.
Â 
The hook thing was really dumb and I didn't get why they did it. They could have picked those wildlings of easily. It was a cool visual though, so I'll let it pass.
Â 
Jon and Ygritte was another disappointment. The acting was fine but the moment where it was inserted was just off. Jon, unarmed, going to her and speaking to her, while the battle around him was still raging on! Why didn't any of the Wildlings get after him? I also found the kids "whazz up" moment after he shot Ygritte a bit ridiculous.
Â 
Another thing that bothered me was the giants at the gate... Really, they were just standing there out in the open. Nobody ordered to fire on them and it took forever to throw something. Also, Gilly passing the wildlings with a baby. Did they really need to show that? It just made the Wildlings into a joke. I also didn't see the point in Ygritte's killing mode... she could have taken Castle Black on her own with her kill score.
Â 
Disappointed that Alliser isn't dead. I think that the show's rendition of the character is better than it's in the books, he's more relatable and understandable (awesome speech and cool convo with Jon btw). It would have been a good end to his arc if he had died in the tunnel. Now, they'll probably make him the <b>baddie that's going to stab Jon</b>
Â 
Things I liked:
Â 
1) Tormund: Ygritte deserved to die for interrupting the bear story. The actor is just great.
2) Gatt's death: All that speculation, all those teases and in the end he just get's a bolt in the head by Sam the Slayer.
3) Giant bow. I wished the hook thing from the NW had been like this. It was awesome and treatening.
4) Alliser's speech and conversation with Jon
5)Killing a lot of people. Making room for the Ironborn 
6) Ghost. Although I would not have wasted him on some no name character. Had he killed Styr it would have been better
7)Janos the coward. Sad, that Jon didn't get the wall from Alliser. But they'll fuck up their good work with Alliser anyway so it seems, so it doesn't matter.
8) Jon shooting Tormund. Very powerful convo
9) The cook with the cleaver. They need to bring that guy back as a recurring extra. He was badass + out of all the fighters he was probably the most realistic.
10) More Maester Aemon. The dialogue they gave him was pretty bad, but the man is awesome so fuck it.
11) Kit was passable. Not great or good, but decent at the very least.
Â 
Conclusion: Blackwater is still better imo, but this was a valiant efford. I'm worried about Graves take on the conclusion of the battle though, I think Marshall should have shot the whole of the battle, he would certainly do it better than Graves.

3301	Inv1ctus	2014-06-09	It's kind of ridiculous that they put in some unnecessary scenes (Sam/Jon & Sam/Aemon & Tormund bear talk) when the episode is only freaking 50 minutes long. Now in the last episode they "have" to put in there a ton of stuff and I just hope that scenes won't seem too much crowded. I really liked the Wall storyline in the books but I didn't care that much for it in this episode. I was expecting Stannis honestly, so that was probably a disappointment and I don't even like Stannis but his Wall appearance is the best as far as I'm concerned, so I guess we'll see him in the finale.Â
3302	King Zee	2014-06-09	Having seen it I think Â Episode 8 and 9 should have been switched. Â  This Battle coming after the Trail by Combat felt like a letdown . its not bad but its also not great. and its doesnt compare to the impact of the red viper.
3303	Veltigar	2014-06-09	Also, I feel that we can finally come down on Kit full force. People give Emilia a lot of shit, but in the big scenes she never disappoints. Kit on the other hand... He was just decent, not good, not great. He doesn't look like Jon and he isn't good enough of an actor to make me not care about that.
3304	R'hllor the Fabulous	2014-06-09	Some more general complaints, but all relevant to this episode.
Â 
The show's treatment of the WIldlings is terrible, I don't care for any of them, in fact, after seeing how bloodthirsty and mad they are I think it's better if the NW just executed them all. In the book they are human, like everyone else, and you care for them.
Â 
The fighting choreography in this show is just terrible, everyone just awkwardly swings their weapons around, no technique, no skill. Just stupid flashy moves and nonsensical strikes. On top of that we have the ever present problem of Armor is useless. Is it too much too ask that they get a couple of HEMA experts on the show to teach the actors some moves?
3305	The Taxman	2014-06-09	Only Stannis could have saved that episode the same way Oberyn saved episode 8.
Â 
Come the fuck on.
3306	Russo	2014-06-09	The Sam and Gilly scene reminded me so much ofTeam America

Armour can't be useless if it isn't there! Westeros is still in the stone age it seems.Â  
Â 
I agree with the rest of your points. The fighting looks like shit. At least the special effects surrounding it are cool, though.Â

3309	MoIaF	2014-06-09	Â 
 
I never cared much for Ygritte in the books either; but I thought that TV-Ygritte had poor chemistry with TV-Jon (he's got more chemistry with Sam than he has with Ygritte). Â The actress was trying hard, and I've seen her on Downton Abbey and thought she did very well; but I couldn't stand the character of Ygritte or the writing for her. Â I thought that young boy was very brave, considering how scared he had been earlier in the battle and how he'd witnessed his village and parents massacred by Wildlings, to avenge his father by killing Ygritte. Â 


Â 

Â 
I didn't care for her in the books either but the scene in the books did have a sadness about it. The scene in the show had none, Kit was just off.
3310	MoIaF	2014-06-09	Also, I feel that we can finally come down on Kit full force. People give Emilia a lot of shit, but in the big scenes she never disappoints. Kit on the other hand...

Â 
So very, very true.
Â 
I was having a discussion with someone who said the Kit was "magnificent" (yeah he used that word) in comparison to Emilia's performance last week.
Â 
To me that's apples and oranges. You want to make a comparison, make it to the scene were Emilia is forced to smother Drogo http://youtu.be/4zAFHETSTJo.
Â 
That's an emotional scene right there.
3311	Veltigar	2014-06-09	Jon Bradley totally outshines him in most scenes imo.


True, but up to this point I could never be sure about the man himself. His character was written so terrible, not even Charles Dance could have done anything with it. So, I couldn't really judge his performance. Now, that we have seen this episode, I think we can honestly come to the conclusion that he sucks balls. He's terribly bland and everyone arounds him out acts him. The only good scene this entire episode was with Tormund, but that wasn't nearly enough.

This. Plus Pyp & Grenn. Other than that I don't have any other complaints I guess. No big ones anyway. I liked that they had the boy kill Ygritte & I actually like Sam & Gilly better than their book counterparts.
3314	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-06-09	I thought it was a great episode, but Ygritte's death didn't resonate with the same impact as it did in the books (as this season was heavily centered around Kings Landing and Tyrions trial and thus people did not recall the intensity of the relationship between Jon and Ygritte). Also, one tiny nitpick is that I feel there should have been much more wildlings attacking the wall from the north, as it was a bit of a joke having a group of 5 running up to the wall (instead of the hundreds and thousands that there should have been).
3315	MoIaF	2014-06-09	Oh yeah, so much better than Ygritte and Jon.Â 


Â 
Also, I think that scene suffered because they waited so long to kill her. Her and Jon hadn't been together for a whole season, the emotional investment of the audience is diminished.
Â 
In general Kit can be decent (he was good when trying to rally the NW to go to Crasters) but he's inconsistent way to often. This was not the episode to be inconsistent, you get all this screen-time you better freaking deliver.Â
3316	Nictarion	2014-06-09	True, but up to this point I could never be sure about the man himself. His character was written so terrible, not even Charles Dance could have done anything with it.

I don't think Kit is horrible, he's just probably the worst of the main characters. I know the guy playing Ramsay auditioned for Jon, I wonder how he would have done with the role.
3317	Greywolf2375	2014-06-09	Right before he was release, I asked where Ghost was.Â  Then Sam opens the gate...releases the Hounds of Hell...and he has a snack.
Â 
Â 


Only a single nitpick, Pyp's death was kinda lame-ish. He didn't have to die, unlike Grenn.


For me, that was kinda the point of his death.Â  Not all deaths are heroic, sometimes they're just bad timing or being in the wrong spot.Â  I think the fact that it happened ONÂ Sam also was supposed to be another trigger for another portion of Sams spine to stiffen up andÂ Be A Man.Â
3318	Victarion Dondarrion	2014-06-09	hands down most disappointing episode this season.

In general Kit can be decent (he was good when trying to rally the NW to go to Crasters) but he's inconsistent way to often. This was not the episode to be inconsistent, you get all this screen-time you better freaking deliver.Â 


The thing is, at this level, decent just isn't good enough. Not everyone is NCW, Stephen Dillane or Charles Dance but at least the rest of the cast is on average good (quite the accomplishment for the actors with these writers). With Kit and someone like Sybil we're already glad if they are 'decent', often we even have to twist ourselves to find them decent. They just fall short.
Â 
Â 


In his defense, Jon could be seen as kind of bland until ADwD in the books too. I don't think Kit is horrible, he's just probably the worst of the main characters. I know the guy playing Ramsay auditioned for Jon, I wonder how he would have done with the role.


Jon has always been my favorite character in the books. Some might see him as bland, but he sure as hell wasn't. There was so much greatly understated emotion in his arc. So, many great moments (climbing the walls, talking to Mance, defending the wall, finding Ygritte, the Halfhand, etc.) and there is not a single one of them they didn't manage to destroy.
Â 
The writing is as always the greatest culprit, but Kit is to blame as well. It seems as if 'decent' is the best he has to offer and in a topnotch series like this is supposed to be he just isn't good enough. If he can't even drive home the big moments, than he has no place here.
Â 
They should have cast Kit as Waymar Royce and let that guy play Jon. He supposedly auditioned for Jon as well and that guy would do a better job. Hell, John Bradley would do a better job. It's to late for a recast and people would outrage at losing his hair, but we will never get the Jon we deserve.Â

Â 
Where were the other 99,845 wildlings? No turtle orÂ 


Also what bothered me, "Mance was just testing our defenses"... WHAT? The Wildlings best shot was the attack by the Thenns (both on the show and in the books). They waisted their best opportunity by not going all out against the Wall and tying up as much men as possible on the top.
3325	Cas Stark	2014-06-09	I thought Kit did well last night. Â I didn't know Iwan had auditioned for the part, he's a much better actor than Kit, I wonder why they didn't give it to him?
Â 
The episode itself wasn't bad, except for too much Sam and Gilly, but that's my personal preference, it's more that leaving out the actual culmination of the story, e.g. Mance and Stannis...knowing what HAS to happen next week, it's going to be impossible to do it justice.
Â 
And I know the show has been 10 minutes short all season allegedly due to budget, but perhaps that means they should reign in the location shoots a little so we can have a 60 minute show, it's bad enough it's only 10 episides, but losing all of this time amounts to loss of an entire episode's worth of time. Â
3326	Batman	2014-06-09	Not about the episode, but now GRRM is catching shit for the deaths of Grenn and Pyp, which he did not even do!Â
3327	horned lord	2014-06-09	They really failed this whole season to provide build up to this battle. I never liked that Thorne and Slint were already there when Jon returns. I disagree that there wouldn't have been enough for the NW to do all season. How about an evacuation of Mole's Town or the villages near The Gift? Or Jon and other NW's characters planning their defense strategies? In 8 episodes the only tactics discussed were getting pitch and sealing the gate. I would have liked to see the first attack from the South in an earlier episode and the main attack start before the 9th episode to show how long the siege was. Jon didn't look as heroic as he should have. I thought Thorne did more.Â 
Â 
Other nitpicks:
-The Wildlings and Mance Rayder are completely unsympathetic characters. Hope they can make Tormund a believable ally in season 5.
-The defense of the gate was not nearly as epic as it could have been.Â 
-I guess HBO couldn't afford more than one mammoth.
-Jon sending Grenn to his death.Â
3328	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	The twenty minute build up was really boring.
3329	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I thought Kit did well last night. Â I didn't know Iwan had auditioned for the part, he's a much better actor than Kit, I wonder why they didn't give it to him?Â The episode itself wasn't bad, except for too much Sam and Gilly, but that's my personal preference, it's more that leaving out the actual culmination of the story, e.g. Mance and Stannis...knowing what HAS to happen next week, it's going to be impossible to do it justice.Â And I know the show has been 10 minutes short all season allegedly due to budget, but perhaps that means they should reign in the location shoots a little so we can have a 60 minute show, it's bad enough it's only 10 episides, but losing all of this time amounts to loss of an entire episode's worth of time.Season 3Ep 1 55 minEp 2 57 minEp 3 53 minEp 4 54 minEp 5 58 minEp 6 53 minEp 7 59 minEp 8 58 minEp 9 52 minEp 10 64 minTotal: 563Season 4Ep 1 59 minEp 2 53 minEp 3 57 minEp 4 57 minEp 5 53 minEp 6 51 minEp 7 51 minEp 8 53 minEp 9 50 minEp 10 66 minTotal: 550Compared to last year, there's only a 13 minute difference. It's not that disparate.
3330	The Fourth Head	2014-06-09	the NW basically defeated the wildlings because Jon is harder then Styr, and Olly and Sam and the handful of men left to defend the Castle were better and harder and more effective than all those Thenns- crazy. At least organise a tactical withdrawal up the stairs and throw down some barrels of oil on them all. there wasn't even any need to give Thorne the credit for that plan as acting LC- thorne fell and Jon could have taken over and thought it up on the hoof- no preconceived stairs collapse needed- just oil and fire.
Â 
this solution was just dumb- the wildlings were winning until Jon killed Styr, Pyp shot a wildling, Sam shot a wildling, and Olly shot a wildling- is the mesage that if you get brave you can defeat a much larger force of better fighters without applying any real tactics or initiative? The wildlings were basically- not hard enough to win and never once looked to win the gate, and according to Jon, despite losing miserably to a few old men and boys with no tacticvs, still thought Castle Black was defended by 1,000 men. It doesn't make any sense. Why make Mance and wildlings tactically bereft? Why make the NW men amazing warriors without any plans?
3331	Cas Stark	2014-06-09	Someone somewhere on here said the music in this episode was lacking and I agree. Â They usually do a fantastic job with it.
3332	Banner Without Brothers	2014-06-09	Episode 8 we find out that there are 103 men of the night's watch including people like Aemon. How many were killed? I'm waiting for some dedicated person to actually make a count of how many died.
Â 
Some good fight scenes but still some silly spins. C'mon we know better than that by now. Also a lot of unnecessary swinging that seemed to be purposefully not to hit any opponents.
Â 
Bad ending. I'm not a huge fan of the wall stuff anyway and I was hoping they would tie up ALL of the wall storyline in this episode. I'm now really worried that the last episode is going to be insanely rushed.
Â 
But main thing how many brothers of the nights watch are left? Can't be more than 20.
3333	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	In think I saw the same guy get killed about 5 times.
Â 
What was with the big anchor in the wall swinging side to side??

3334	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-09	The thing is, at this level, decent just isn't good enough. Not everyone is NCW, Stephen Dillane or Charles Dance but at least the rest of the cast is on average good (quite the accomplishment for the actors with these writers). With Kit and someone like Sybil we're already glad if they are 'decent', often we even have to twist ourselves to find them decent. They just fall short.

I saw her in Gegen die Wand before she was on GoT. She was great in that movie, but she's horrible on GoT.
3337	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-09	5 people climbing the wall, 50 at most with two giants and a Mammoth tackling the gate. 100 or so killed by arrows
Â 
Where were the other 99,845 wildlings?


Â 
Yes, the climbers are just f*cking stupid. They just had to climb the wall like 5 miles down the road, where no watchmen was looking, instead of directly at the gate. Then they could have attacked the battlement atop the wall just easily, or maybe just throwing rope ladders down for others to follow.

Â

Â 
There was just no tension on the other side of the wall. They should have spread this battle out over a few episodes having separate battles.


What was actually the point of those 5 climbers? Mance is supposed to think that there are a thousand men in Castle Black. Did he really believe that those 5 climbers could climb all the way up to the Wall and actually do something important.
3340	RhaenysBalerion	2014-06-09	In truth the promo was suspicious already... But I was like Okay, whatever, the battle of the Wall will be highlight of the episode of course they put that into the promo. Well, I sat down to watch the episode, had a bowl of strawberry in my lap, my bruises still hurt, but the WiFi is working, so I was generally in a good and not at all nitpicky mood. Ten minutes into the episode I started to have a bad feeling. 18 minutes into the episode I paused it and fastforwarded a couple times to check if the fucking battle of the fucking Wall is TRULY taking up the entire fucking episode. And it was.Â 
Â 
That was the time when I decided whatever happens, I won't rate it higher than 5. Because the whole notion is completely absurd and unfair and ridiculous. Give me ONE reason why this piece of the Wall storyline deserved an entire episode over any other piece of storyline. After all the ridiculous amount of screentime wasted on relocating Gilly to Moles Town the Wildlings attacking Moles Town, Sam crying over leaving Gilly in Moles Town, Jon and Ser Alliser's power/testosterone/IQ demonstration clashes, Jon going on about how Mance's army is sooooo clooose by now.... After all that... ONE ENTIRE episode on the bloody battle of the bloody Wall! This is not even the right battle! Even the notion of the battle is wrong, since the whole point of the Jon storyline is that the Night's Watch should team up with the Wildlings to fight the REAL enemy, so it's not even a long awaited climax battle between the good guys and the bad guys. And what's even far worse than all this... ONE ENTIRE episode wasted and we never took one step forward. No peace, no Stannis, no victory, no nothing. In fact, I'll just go back and rewrite my vote from 4 to 3.Â 
Â 
Other than this, the episode was often boring. No cuts to different scenes with different people, just failed to maintain tension. Good fighting scenes and battle scenes, but too many and too long. Sam's scene with Maester Aemon was a complete waste of resources, who gives a shit about Maester Aemon and the girls he liked when he was young? I saw the Thenn boss die about three times. I know they look all the same, but how about some bloody distinction? Warg with a bird - that card had been played, plus, there was the fucking HORN who needed a bird to know it was time to attack. Wildlings camping and fighting each other - that card had been played and played and played. So much it's already torn. So Jon is the boss? How come? Ser Alliser grew some serious balls this episode, he was freaking awesome and far more of a leader than Jon. Jon didn't do anything.Â 
Â 
I was sorry Pyp and Grenn died, but both were good scenes and something HAD to HAPPEN in this damn episode, because let's stop for a moment and list the things that actually happened?Â 
- Stunts died
- Ygritte died
Did we get ahead with the plot by a single inch? No. So you need more characters people care about to die so the episode won't feel wasted. At least they got nice and realistic deaths, unlike Irri and Doreah.Â 
Â 
I can't fucking believe they wasted an ENTIRE episode on NOT getting ahead with the plot. And the ending... goodness, that was absolutely horrible. So bad, so, SO bad. So pointless, so nonsense... I can't find words for how much I hated this episode.

3341	Guard of the Rainking	2014-06-09	Seriously the wreaking pointless Siege of Meereen seemed like a bigger battle than this. I hope that Stannis arrival will be massive.
3342	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	Also a 30 second clip of Ghost killing one Wildling.
Â 
What did they spend their CGI budget on this season?
Â 
I'm just so annoyed how much they messed up this episode.
3343	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-09	I'm going to list my nitpicks first, then try and catch up reading the thread.
Â 
Ahhhhhhh, where to begin?Â 
Â 
I'm nitpicking that they killed off Pyp, even though I must nitpick that other than looking like him, this guy never was BookPyp to me anyway, LOL
Â 
Killing Grenn is MORE than a nitpick, and never having a Donal Noye to die at the gate is a nitpick.Â  Pyp not being Pyp, really, and No Donal is the reason we lost a terrific Grenn, because ya know, they had to kill someone that they actually bothered to flesh out a bit.
Â 
Ghost....... not enough Ghost and my daughter wanted to know why.......did Ghost stop to eat at his first takedown in the battle, instead of getting up and killing someone else.Â  Like my daughter said:Â  Ghost, eat later......they'll be plenty, go kill someone else.
Â 
No sign of Mance out on the other side of the Wall?Â  Kinda silly, just his fire and his giants and mammoths?Â 
Â 
Jon doing the Ygritte goodbye while the battle still rages?Â  I SWEAR......D&D live to make Jon look bad, but then again, at least he's not getting the Stannis treatment.Â  That's my last nitpick, I can see they didn't leave enough time for the Stannis stuff, but......still, WTF??Â  I can't see as how they will have room for half of the things they need to get done next week.
Â 
I did like alot of the episode, but it also shows in some respects how little has truly been devoted to the storyline up at The Wall.Â  That's it for now, I'm sure more will come to me soon, LOLÂ

3344	Cas Stark	2014-06-09	The problem with killing both Grenn and Pyp is going forward there is going to be no one at the Wall the audience cares about or even recognizes except Jon Snow. Â Sam and Aemon will be gone.
3345	Ingelheim	2014-06-09	I didn't feel the epicness the book battle had.
3346	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	There was no tension on the top of the wall. Slowly firing arrows and letting barrels go. Not to mention half the Crows were able to abandon their posts to fight below. Worst part was just staring a the giants and mammoth for a few minutes before doing anything.
3347	The Red Melli	2014-06-09	"Mance is testing our defences."

Bitch?! How is sending all your troops south of the wall to siege Castle Black "testing?".Â 
"Biggest fire the North has ever seen?" was just a kamikaze move? And what about the 5 climbers? What the hell was Mance expecting?

I bet Mance (D&D) really wanted to see the scythe move, which is the only reason i think there were only 5-6 people climbing.

Â 
"â<U+0080>¦â<U+0080>¦.shut up Sam, don't question D & D's script!"
3352	son1dow	2014-06-09	Â  I think the important parts were fine. I just don't enjoy the sex & women talk filler - they weren't in the books and they add nothing to the show.
Â  It just feels like they think they have to add them, so they do. But asoiaf is a great story in an of itself, and I think people get it, so why do they think they keep having to create and gloat over love interests.
3353	Veltigar	2014-06-09	Edd
They should have killed him. Edd isn't the real Dolorous Edd anyway, Grenn on the other hand was played by a very good actor, he should have remained.
3354	MilkSucSouthronKnight	2014-06-09	Agree with many of the nitpics posted, but here's something I really didn't get...
Â 
TV Mance was quoted as saying "I'm gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."Â  I guess that was his "ace" in TV show, since the TV show has chosen to ignore the Horn of Joramun (which was a fake anyways).Â  So while they're standing atop the Wall this episode, sure enough there's a gigantic fire in the woods before the Wall.Â  Ummmmm- why?Â  The Wall is 700 feet high, and those fires though close were still no-where near the Wall.Â  So the smoke nor the fire serves a purpose in the battle.Â  Actually building fortifications to assault the Wall is probably unrealistic even for a TV show, but you could still use the wood for fire, cover...ANYTHING other than getting smoke in your own armies eyes.
Â 
The ONLY reasoning I could figure is that the Wildling army started that fire BEHIND them for protection against the undead/WW army they showed at the end of last season.Â  But if that's the case, the TV show blew it because they didn't mention it this episode?!Â  Instead, its all about "we gotta kill dem Crows".Â  No shades of grey here- just straight up good vs. evil.Â  Now maybe when Jon goes to meet Mance in E10 this is made mention, but I think they dropped the ball by not establishing that the Wildling army is more about them fleeing a greater evil than trying to overcome the NW.
3355	Nictarion	2014-06-09	They should have killed him. Edd isn't the real Dolorous Edd anyway, Grenn on the other hand was played by a very good actor, he should have remained.


I actually kinda prefer show Edd tbh. I'm in the rare minority of people that don't find book Edd hilarious.
3356	Edmure's Floppy Fish	2014-06-09	Â 
So true. Hopefully Mance will mention the Others next episode, because the writers apparently forgot about the invincible undead army pressing at their heels

I know!!! My wife had been watching faithfully with me for the past 4 seasons (but hasn't read the books) and asked my "why are the widlings trying to cross the wall?" I think that was poor writing! They should have shown more back story on the Others and WW! Sure the faithful book readers like myself knew but Unsullied didn't!
3357	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	They could have at least showed Mance this season. He's like the orcs in LOTR. We don't care about them, we don't want them to win and we want to see them all get run over but the "good" guys. They have absolutely no substance and we have no cause to sympathise with them like in the books.
3358	Veltigar	2014-06-09	I actually kinda prefer show Edd tbh. I'm in the rare minority of people that don't find book Edd hilarious.


 Â   Well,Â de gustibus et coloribus non est disputandum
3359	Veltigar	2014-06-09	I thought that the fire would be used as a distraction. Everyone is watching this big fires and then the Wildlings launch an assault somewhere else. To bad Dumb&Dumber thought an unrealistic hook was cooler.Â
3360	Cas Stark	2014-06-09	I also kept expecting to see some cuts to Mance's army to build tension throughout the season and to remind the viewers that he's got an army, who he is, and why the wildlings are coming South. Â
3361	Cayrouse	2014-06-09	Knowing D&D stannis' arrival is probably going to interrupt/ cancel a massive treaty of peace and friendship between the wildlings and the nights watch against the white walkers or something.  Instead of the  being tge only king who  still cared he would end up as the king who doomed the north. well judging by their choices so far anyway...
3362	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Â   Well,Â de gustibus et coloribus non est disputandum 


Hey no fairÂ
3363	The Fourth Head	2014-06-09	In defence of the decision to show an entire episode devoted to the wall:
Â 
1) they did the same on the Blackwater, and thats widely considered to be the best episode ever
2) if wildlings vs NW-men is pointless, thats the point- the small mindedness of it all. Like pumping millions into fighting over oil reserves whilst climate change kills ever growing numbers of people. Equally, if this is pointless, so is Stannis vs Joffrey, Robb vs Tywin, Renly vs Stannis etc etc- it's like the Blackwater reenacted, but increasingly transparent in it's pointlessness. The book shares the same message, but the fight was better coordinated and thought out in the books. There's way too much mindless macho sword swinging here.
Â 
The NW couldn't take the Thenns without some plan. Here, they had none other than Jon and 4 reinforcements, and Ghost being enough to turn the tide. Nonsense.
3364	Guard of the Rainking	2014-06-09	Knowing D&D stannis' arrival is probably going to interrupt/ cancel a massive treaty of peace and friendship between the wildlings and the nights watch against the white walkers or something. Instead of the being tge only king who still cared he would end up as the king who doomed the north. well judging by their choices so far anyway...


While also killing all the Crows, burning Jon Snow for being a traitor's brother, raping the Wildling women and castrating and enslaving the Wildling men and forcing them to rebuild the Walls castles. All the while Stannis is sitting around in the King's Tower contemplating an alliance with Roose Bolton and drinking wine. No joke watch S2E01 again. Stannis drinks wine in the show.

3365	hannibal2121	2014-06-09	LOVED the episode, BUT several points that I did not like:
Â 
- The Wildlings south of the wall camping (w/ fire) within 400 yards of the Castle Black walls (very subtle!).
- It seemed like they used the same shot over and over again in the Castle Black courtyard -- perfectly matched pairs of combatants endlessly fighting each other.Â  Became filler.
- Jon's decision to parlay/assassinate Mance.Â Â Other than the Giant's infiltration, the attack from the NorthÂ was a complete failure.Â  The attack from the South was the really threat (and it has been eliminated).Â  Is it just me or do you think the NW's canÂ hold the 700 foot wall and its tiny tunnel indefinitely (especially since Brothers can be relocated from Castle Black to the top of the Wall)?Â  Of course, if I was Mance, I would instructÂ 1000 men to scale the wall a few miles to the east and to the west of Castle Black and then attack from the rear again.Â  He had a good plan, but sent -- what -- 70 men?Â  50 more and the Wildlings never would have needed to attack from the North.
-Â  Jon's mourning of Ygritte lasted a touch too long in the middle of the battle.Â  The death was very moving as was his reaction, but then I felt like, "hey dude, stand up -- your brothers are dying all around you."
- Giving us only one Ghost attack (and then Ghost seemed to linger over the body as if he was sitting down to a six-course meal).
Â 
But the good far outweighed the bad for me.Â 
Â
3366	The ~ Red ~ Viper	2014-06-09	With the nw having tormund does anyone think he will replace rattleshirts role next season.The scythe move was cool I liked it,but why would 5- 6 men be climbing the wall,did they think they could just pull thereselfs up at the top without getting hit with a arrow.
3367	AegonVI_rules	2014-06-09	The 8 episodes before it that back this episode into a corner. Yes, a battle spectacular makes good TV, but only if you are invested in it - even if you stretched out Jon's material so that you can Episode 9 the battle, why was the prep mere discussion?
Â 
We begin the season with Jon having just returned and catch up occurs (Jon VI)
Then we have Jon accused and tried by Thorne and Slint (Jon IX), spared by Aemon (background of Jon X)
Then we have the Crasters Keep nonsense
Then we have the discussion of battle plans (Jon VII and IX elements)
Then we have the battle (Jon VII & VIII)
Â 
we've gone three chapters into Jon's material in 9 episodes, just starting the forth, and haven't actually done a lot of the material from them, instead doing nonsense filler rather than prepping for the battle*. Sam avoids it and arrives afterwards in the books, but as well as 3 chapters of Jon's SoS arc to go, there's 3 chapters of Sam left in the SoS material. And it's not like Jon doesn't have 13 chapters in Dance to cover next season... I guess, however, that the election isn't needed, Jon is last man standing as everyone will know Janos is a coward and poor leader, and Thorne is out of the picture. We'll probably just have Jon X next week.
Â 
What would have worked better for those 4 chapters is as follows, allowing for Sam, Slint and Thorne to be at the wall and a roughly similar outline.
Episode 1 - Jon fills people in and is filled in, has his trial (same as show)
Episode 2 - nothing (same as show)
Episode 3 - Wilding raid on a village (same as show), Jon's worry for the villagers leads to a plan bring the Molestown people to Castle Black (this deals with Sam's worries for Gilly's safety as the only woman at the wall, changes Jon's quest)
Episode 4 - Getting men for Molestown (similar to show)
Episode 5 - Molestown evacuation
Episode 6 - Plans to defend Castle Black
Episode 7 -Â Preparations for Battle inc Wildlings both sides of the wall
Episode 8 - Preparations for Battle ending just before it begins
Episode 9 - Battle of Castle Black, Jon leaving for Mance
Episode 10 - Battle of the Wall
Â 
*In the books, Jon evacuates Molestown (Jon VI), returns to Castle Black and is caught up on events (Jon VI), preps Castle Black with Noye (Jon VII), fights the attack from the south (Jon VII), fights the first attack from the north (Jon VIII), finds Noye and the giant (Jon VIII), gets the interim command from Aemon (Jon VIII), the turtle comes (Jon IX), Thorne and Slint arrive and accuse him (Jon IX), Jon thrown in ice cell (Jon IX), Janos (who seems to be in charge now) sends Jon to Mance as Aemon won't let him be executed (Jon X).

Â 
I like both Edds, LOLÂ  I can see the potential of ShowEdd to give the books their due just by the looks on his face and some of his dialogue.Â  I loved the hell out of the TVTeam of Edd and Grenn.Â  I'm still pissed that they killed Grenn, I thought it looked for a second that it might have been Thorne to take his place at the last minute.Â  Out of the three, I'm fine with loosing Pyp, he was the one who had the least developed personality, hell....all he did was usually sit around and look as sullen as Jon Snow, not a joke cracked, iirc.Â

Â 
He had his little "you're too stupid to be a coward" moment with Grenn, but otherwise not really much to note about him. I really thought they'd have Pyp take the place of Dareon though, so I'm wondering if Arya is going to kill a NW member at all?Â
3370	Tankbuster	2014-06-09	And now we will never get the Turnips line.
3371	Peter George Stewart	2014-06-09	I was really quite disappointed by this episode, and it's probably my least favourite in the whole series so far, and I'm a bit worried that it's going to have lost the show some momentum in the eyes of the general public.
Â 
While I enjoyed the general fight scenes, the fire arrows, the single mammoth and couple of giants as much as anyone, and while I found the deaths in this episode moving enough, the episode just seems a waste of time to devote to the first testing skirmish at the Wall; having the rear attack at the same time just seemed half-arsed.
Â 
They could have cut out a lot of the fat (particularly Sam, much as I love him), and shown the couple of days, ending with Stannis "Tywining".Â  Cheesy or not, that would give the punters a better sense of the whole thing.
Â 
Here's the thing: evidently, amongst genereal punters, nobody cares about what's going on at the Wall, except for Jon.Â  Given that nobody cares, if you're going to devote a whole episode to Wall events, you've got to end it with something gratifying, and something that connects it to the stuff that's been depicted in the last few episodes.Â Â  Stannis is a bit of a "bridge" in that regard - he's still connected with the Clash, and he would have formed a good link between all that and the Wall stuff.
Â 
I say this as someone who is about as far from a "Stannis lover" as one can be - yet, at the same time, you have to give Stannis his due as the one "king" who is doing something about the thing that's the biggest threat to Westeros.Â 
Â 
I also say this as someone who's been a big fan of the way D&D have handled it all so far - but with this episode, I think they've mis-stepped.Â  Not fatally (they still have a huge amount of momentum), and it's probably good that it's just before the finale (which I'm sure people will watch no matter what), but still, it's a bit disappointing.
3372	AegonVI_rules	2014-06-09	Oh, and wrt the 103 NW on the wall, don't forget that there were quite a few massacred in Molestown!
Â 
It's just Sam, Slint, Jon, Edd, Aemon and the boy who survived, not this 20 nonsense. No need for elections, or at least not drawn out ones: Edd, Sam and Jon is 50%, with Aemon that's the two-thirds needed!
3373	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-09	Â 
He had his little "you're too stupid to be a coward" moment with Grenn, but otherwise not really much to note about him. I really thought they'd have Pyp take the place of Dareon though, so I'm wondering if Arya is going to kill a NW member at all?Â 


Â 
Hmmmmmmm, good point about Arya and the NW killing.Â  It looks like they are going need LOTS of recruiting.Â  I really am hopeful for someone doing a dead NW count for this episode.Â  I suspect that the killing in Braavos might not happen, just like we were minus a singer in the Eyrie for Lysa's murder, them having killed Marillion in KL.Â  Hell, surely there are more musicians in Westeros?Â  I try to maintain an easy going attitude, but D&D do make that difficult at times.Â 
Â 
On a related note to my previous post, I at first thought GRRM was trying too hard with Edd in the books, but I wound up loving him.Â  I think I just surrendered on his one positive note:Â  Edd thinking he might die before the NW could figure out how to put his body back to work, LOLÂ
3374	Alia Atreides	2014-06-09	My favorite part of the wall scene had to be when they broke apart the ice and you see the wildings being smashed right against it and also the Giant just splatting a wilding into the ground as he ran away. Â 
Â 
Sad to see Pyp and Green both get it as this was half of Jon's family on the wall I wonder now when he is to become Lord Commander who will stand for him now? Before he had them at his side as well as Samwell; now he has Sam but not for long he should be leaving soon enough once the Red Woman gets to the wall.
Â 
I wonder also how they are going to fit in all the rest next week with Stannis and Tywin dying and I saw some Dany's dragons as well appearing to be locked up already. Â 
Â 
We definitely need more Ghost I say; I will be sad to see the season yet again END until next year once again.Â

Aw, I just love Edd. And Show!Edd should be in contention for the LC election, IMO. He was quite the commander.

D&D write less episodes in season 5, Alex Graves left and David Nutter is directing the last two episodes.

Nutter managed to botch the RW (that silly walk of Roose, I just can't get over it) and D&D will still write 6 episodes. And they are the ones that map out the entire season and make the final decision. In other words, don't get your hopes up for next season.

Lol true he does kinda struggle with those scenes but Sam didn't even react from what I remember and Grenn was one of his first friends  kinda lame how he only seems to care about Gillehhhhh

Yeah I'm not sure if that still happens but she still probably will meet Sam. There is actually a Dareon in the TV show, Aemon sent him to Eastwatch in season 1 just like he was in the books. The Night Watch did lose the Yoren, who was their recruiter, the Nights Watch does need someone to replace him, so it seems like everything is in place if they want to do it I just do not know if they will but I think they will keep it in, it does play an important role in her training.

IMO The Rains of Castamere was well directed, but yeah a lot of the Mhysa stuff was botched.
3385	Northern Girl 30	2014-06-09	I forget what happen in the book. Did Jon leave the wall to go find Mance? Or was that a thing HBO did??

3387	zaphodbrx	2014-06-09	Sometimes I feel like this entire forum has turned into D&D fanatics. Maybe it's the percolation of show-only viewers. Or it's just people who have made their internal peace with the show and just see it as different from the books.
Â 
Whatever the reason, it's clear that the show gets less and less criticism as time goes on, even though they make more and more deviations from the book and the quality is overall worse and has more and more filler. Let's be honest, practically no one outside these forums ( and nowadays just this thread ) even criticizes the show at all. Remember the days when D & D got flayed for making nonsense changes like 'Talisa' and you got endless threads about that? They are gone. Each episode now only gets a handful of threads/comments and most of them praise the episode anyway. I get the feeling that book readers are slowly giving up and stopping posting, because why bother at this point. D & D won't change anything.
Â 
Even you look at this website's reviewers, and the folks at 'A podcast of ice and fire', and such. They still criticize the show somwehat, but the venom is gone. All episodes get between 4-4.5 /5 these days. No table flipping or losing their shit.
Â 
But I'll still nitpick. Hell yeah. Over multiple posts, starting with this one.
Â 
The elevator
Â 
The elevator is something that really bothered me this episode.
I'll get a bit nerdy and go into the physics of this thing. Now the elevator is powered by a human. The precise arrangement of the pulleys and winch doesn't really matter, because what such a system effectively does is trade force for speed, let us say in the ratio 8:1. So to lift a 80 kg man, you'd have to exert a force equivalent to lifting 10 kg, but he would go up at 8 times less speed. Let us say that the dude is pushing the winch at the rate of 5km/hr ( a brisk walk ). Divide this by 8, and we get the elevator speed as 0.09 m/sec. To climb a 100 ft ( 33 m ) wall , it would take 11 minutes.
Â 
Note that I reduced the height of the wall from 700 ft to 100 ft ( which is still very impressive - the height of a 10 story building ), and neglected friction, and also assumed that the weight of the elevator is balanced by a counterweight. It still takes a good deal of time to get up and down the wall, and the guy manning the winch would be pretty much winded out after a short while of huffing and puffing - exerting a 10 kg force for long period of time is not a small thing. Even in the books the elevator is somewhat problematic but atleast Martin doesn't have his characters go up and down like it's nothing. Jon Snow has the wall, Donal Noye is holding the gate, they don't clamber up and down.
Â 
But in this episode, characters clamber up and down the elevator in seemingly no time whatsoever. It is really distracting and stupid, like they couldn't have any main character at the bottom, so first Thorne goes down, Slynt goes down, Grenn, Sam goes up, Jon goes down. it's just a mess. And they could have just left the operation of the winch as a plot-hole or hidden, but no no no. D & D couldn't leave that be.
Â 
They put THE KID in charge of the elevator.
Â 
Let me emphasize. The elevator is one of the most crucial components of the wall. It is the only link between the top and bottom. And they put the one dude in charge who a.) has no upper body strength and b.) would probably be the first one to flee at the first sign of dangers.
Â 
I guess they were thinking in the writers room; We need to stick the kid somewhere for until the time when he shoots Ygritte. Let's put him at the winch, cause why not. LOL.
Well done, Dumb & Dumber. Well done.
3388	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-09	This is my fault, but no Stannis. 
Even though I knew this episode depicted the battle of castle black and that Stannis is not involved in that I though he would be in the episode. 
But he wasn't and I was gutted. 
Then I came here and read the endless whinging about it and it made me feel bad for thinking about whinging my self.

3390	sj4iy	2014-06-09	With the nw having tormund does anyone think he will replace rattleshirts role next season.The scythe move was cool I liked it,but why would 5- 6 men be climbing the wall,did they think they could just pull thereselfs up at the top without getting hit with a arrow.


Â 
I think he's replacing Val because I don't see them burning Tormund in Mance's place. Â Tormund can be Jon's envoy to the Wildlings like he is in the book.

The kid isn't powering the lift he's putting the system into motion. Notice when Sam goes up the kid only pushes it in a half circle before going back to his hiding space
3392	zaphodbrx	2014-06-09	Part II
Â 
Samwell Tarly's stupidity and general incompetence
Â 
Samwell Tarly is not present at Castle Black during any of the wildling attacks in the novels. In hindsight this was very clever of GRRM. His character doesn't really lend itself to be very useful during a battle, and a lone wildling woman with a kid hanging around is a nightmare dilemma as well.
Â 
So given that they have Sam return so early to Castle black I was curious as to how they would go with his character. And as it turns out, what we see in this season is not only complete filler / D & D fanfiction, it is also tedious, banal and completely skippable. It is a good example of D & D's incompetence when they don't have any material from the books to adapt and I expect to see a lot more of it going forward.
Â 
First and foremost, we have the UGLY romance. I'm sorry but it's just.. BAD. The writing is terrible and results in about half an hour of filler scenes throughout the season that I found so painful that I just skipped most of the time. And this was not the episode for a romance. B-But.. we need to give Sam something to do so why not fast forward the romance that occurs in AFFC. Except, next season Sam and Gilly will be stuck on the boat anyway. What else is there for them to do? Let's face it, they didn't fast forward or adapt anything. They just created filler.
Â 
Then you have the really bad Mole's town subplot. Even if you accept the mindboggling stupidity of trying to prevent someone being raped by packing them off to the whorehouse, this doesn't explain why Sam never brought Gilly back when he had at least five episodes to do so. I mean he could have easily done it while Jon went off to Craster's Keep. But no, he just whines all the time and adds several minutes of unnecessary filler.
Â 
So, let's come to this episode.
First you have Sam & Jon talking about sex ( incredibly poor dialogue ). Then if that's not enough he talks to Master Aemon about sex. (LOL what?) Then another massive filler segment with Gilly, and then he locks her in the room. Like what, how does that help. You could have her reload crossbows or something. There's even a precedent in the books - two whores from Mole's town that come over ( Zoe and Mully ).Â 
Â 
And he's reading. What's he reading? Wildling torture methods. What a great way to boost morale before a battle. God forbid you have him read anything useful. For comparison, Tyrion was reading 'The Great Sieges of Westeros'. He didn't read 'How to Sacrifice to the Lord of Light 101'.
Â 
And then let's go to the actual battle.
So when Pyp died, I thought. Hey! He's been shit whole season, but he will stand up to the plate now.
Except what followed was an astounding display of incompetence.
He doesn't understand the point of a ranged weapon, is to hide behind a wall and shoot at things from RANGE.
Instead, he runs right out there, like an idiot. And not with a loaded crossbow either. He takes the bolt out, and then starts loading it, right in front of the enemy.
What the flying fuck? Just drop the bolt and use the crossbow as melee weapon. Or pull out your sword/dagger.
But apparently the crossbow is magical and somehow loads itself in 1 sec and kills the Thenn. Then he runs back behind the wall.
Gee, you couldn't just have stayed behind the wall and aimed at people from there?
Â 
I could go on and on, but I think I've made the point. Show Sam is appalling. Every time he shows up in a filler scene, I get the urge to strangle him just for wasting my time. And this is coming from a big fan of Book Sam.
Â

Clockwork systems and the like (even a simple system where pushing the lever releases weights would work) still work and yes we see him do it several other times. But do we see him pushing it in circles over and over again as you would need to do to get the lift up to the top, no. We do however see him push it a little bit then running away

3395	WTF's a Lommy	2014-06-09	I think it would have been better if Thorne would have given the wall to Jon instead of Slynt like the blacksmith did in the book, it would have been a more powerful moment and fit in better with the moment they had just had with Thorne telling Jon he was right. Â It also would have been a nice "Fuck You Slynt" moment.
3396	David Selig	2014-06-09	Ygritte's death scene really made me laugh. First the little kid appearing out of nowhere and shooting her in the back, then suddenly all the noise of the battle disappeared for a minute and everyone around just ignored Jon Snow and let him have a nice quiet moment to mourn right in the middle of the battle. Nobody tried to attack him and take advantage of it, hell,Â  suddenly nobody could even be seen anywhere near so Jon could have his few minutes of grief. Hilarious.

Â 
Pretty much. Even though there are still lots of things that bother me, I have significantly reduced how much time I will spend debating it with people. For one, we have come to expect them to butcher things, so it's not really a surprise that they do it, just how much and what they will butcher. And while I still do get caught up in debates on some things, for the most part if after a day of debating you haven't changed the other person's mind, you never will.
Â 
I prefer a purist style, though I am also realistic in knowing that some things have to be changed for a TV budget. So casting cuts, battles being cut, conversations being condensed, these are all things that I can personally be OK with even if I would love it if they were avoided. It's the random changes that are most annoying to me. Messendei and Greyworm romance. Biter and Rorge dieing in spectacularly underwhelming fashion to Arya and the Hound, leaving no established characters for Brienne to encounter prior to Lady Stoneheart. I suspect next week Brienne and the Hound will fight though.
Â 
I liked alot of stuff about this episode, but I certainly have my nitpicks. I didn't really get why the wildlings started a massive forest fire on their flank. I know they wanted to signal the "biggest fire the north has ever seen" to let their raiders know they were coming, but beyond that signal what was the purpose? It seems given the numbers the wildlings have and the numbers the watch has that the uncontrollable forest fire raging behind them would be more threat than the Night's Watch.
Â 
Jon went to kill Mance, but didn't appear to bring a weapon. Tormund isn't with Mance to speak on Jon's behalf that he should be allowed to speak with Mance. Of course answering my own complaint and introducing a new one;Tormund's relationship isn't friendly with Jon anyway, and frankly Jon didn't develope any relationship of consequence with any wildling outside of Ygritte. If they are going to have non-POV scenes, reintroducing Mance prior to the attack might have been a good idea.
Â 
If you are going to have wildling climbers during the attack on the wall, you might want to climb a mile or so on to the left or right of the gate, where there would beÂ minimalÂ guards. I had to pause the show as the non-readers watching with me asked, "Why aren't they attacking this mammoth right below them that is obviously trying to break down the gate?", and all I could say is this specific scene didn't happen in the books so I don't know. Dramatic effect?
Â 
And while I'm fine with delaying Stannis til next episode, I'm worried that they won't have the budget to do it, and we will get another cut to aftermath battle.

D & D won't change anything.Or maybe the show has gotten much better over the years because many of those 'changes and deviations' aren't nearly as dramatic as book purists make them out to be, and the rest of us can see how they serve the larger storyline without getting blindsided by our own biases.I like the show. I like the books. I don't require the show to be a carbon copy of the books...in fact, I enjoy and appreciate the changes when they enhance the story and criticize the show based on its own merits- not on what I think should be in there from the books. I'm not a "D&D fanatic" or a "show apologist"...I hate those terms because I make no apologies for liking an excellent show and I don't give a damn who the show runners are.Honestly, I see more negativity in these threads than praise, because people act like the show is blaspheming a sacred text...but there's never been any show or movie that stayed completely and utterly faithful to its source material. And deviating from the source material isn't necessarily a bad thing...especially in the case of ASoIaF, where there are SOOOO many expendable characters and plot lines. Many book readers agree that Martin often has too much superfluous material, and that it's not all necessary to the overarching story. Yes, I have things I like in the story; but no, I'm not devastated when I don't see them on screen. And I would be the first to admit that many of the things I like in the story don't necessarily translate well onscreen. And when a moment that I love from the books DOES come onscreen, I don't mind if some things have been changed. Example: I loved Noye in the books...he was awesome, but he's not in the show. When I saw Grenn taking his place in the tunnel, I was really glad that we still got that moment, although with a different character. I can see the point in Grenn taking Noye's place in this situation, and the sacrifice still came off well...probably better than it did in the books, if I'm honest.Book readers â<U+0089>  people who don't like the show, basically.

3399	The ~ Red ~ Viper	2014-06-09	Â 
I think he's replacing Val because I don't see them burning Tormund in Mance's place. Â Tormund can be Jon's envoy to the Wildlings like he is in the book. I hope so I would love to see more scenes with them 2 than have Jon talking with davos.

Â 
I don't mean to be rude, but can you spare more than one moment of thought about it.
For getting a man 100 ft up, you have to do an equivalent amount of work. No two ways about it or handwaving it away with 'clockwork mechanisms' . The entire winch and pulley system trades force against speed ( and consequently time ). You can't get something for nothing. Basic conservation of energy. You can lift an 80 kg man with a much smaller force, but have to exert that force for a much longer period of time.
Â 
In fact, the winch system pulled by human is not only described in the novels , but we actually see it in one of the season 1 episodes. Except that time the winch was at the top of the wall instead of the bottom- but then I don't expect that level of continuity from the show.
3401	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-09	I hope so I would love to see more scenes with them 2 than have Jon talking with davos.


Â 
I have to admit, I'm stuck pondering where they are going with the Mance and Tormund equation. Â Part of me thinks that somehow Tormund will escape captivity and wind up in charge of the great remainder of the Wilding Host, but part of me thinks that Mance may just die, and somehow Tormund will take the Mance part.......off to Winterfell with his stories and maybe even a harp? Â Or, I suppose that Tormund may do the negotiating on a release such as Val did. Â I guess we'll know once we see who winds up in Mance's tent and if Rattleshirt turns up as a prisoner of Stannis? Â 
Â 
It's kind of a mess, everything in the vicinity of The Wall. Â I agree with previous opinions I've read........there is a reason that GRRM did not show Tormund murdering regular folk left and right, same with Ygritte and keeping her actions down to one throat slitting. Â

3402	Mark Antony	2014-06-09	Or maybe the show has gotten much better over the years.
Season 1 is still easily my favorite
3403	gvewolf243	2014-06-09	While also killing all the Crows, burning Jon Snow for being a traitor's brother, raping the Wildling women and castrating and enslaving the Wildling men and forcing them to rebuild the Walls castles. All the while Stannis is sitting around in the King's Tower contemplating an alliance with Roose Bolton and drinking wine. No joke watch S2E01 again. Stannis drinks wine in the show.


Also burning children, making more shadow babies, alliance with Freys and etc.
3404	WildBlood	2014-06-09	My main nit pick (i agree with a few listed here as well) is that it really seems to me that HBO could not afford the luxury of wasting an entire episode on one battle. Sure it made for decent TV, but at t he expense of the story IMO. And then, next week, the finale, will be marred by constant rushing to fit in what, 5 plot lines? Tyrion/Shae/Tywin, Arya/Hound, Bran/Jojen/Meera, Sansa, The Wall, Meereen, Ramsay/Theon (maybe?)... They should have tried to split the difference between the two epsiodes.

3406	gvewolf243	2014-06-09	Season 1 is still easily my favorite
3407	David Selig	2014-06-09	Honestly, I see more negativity in these threads than praise, because people act like the show is blaspheming a sacred text...but there's never been any show or movie that stayed completely and utterly faithful to its source material. And deviating from the source material isn't necessarily a bad thing...especially in the case of ASoIaF, where there are SOOOO many expendable characters and plot lines.


Sure, the problem for me is that most of the deviations are just poorly written IMO. D&D are just not good at writing dialogue at all. So many cringe-worthy lines. So many plot holes too in almost every episode. Sure, there are some good changes, but most of them just don't work for me. Not because they are different from the novels, but because they jsut aren't that good IMO.

I think we will still get Rattleshirt/Mance switch, because Rattleshirt was still an asshole in the show, too. Stannis could take Rattleshirt captive during the raid.This is just my thinking, of course...I could be totally wrong, but it makes sense to me XD
3411	sj4iy	2014-06-09	I think that Ramsay/Theon this season story-arc ended in 8th episode . There should be Brienne in next episode, though.I would say Sansa's storyline is done for the season, too.

Kill Mance and we will get Val afterall. Â HBO does like hot chicks afterall. Â 


Â 
I do highly suspect that they may kill Mance and still.......not replace him with the Hot Chick, LOL Â 
Â 
I'm not sure, I just can see many possibilities from the equation right now. Â The extreme lack of Mance so far does have me wondering. Â
3414	zaphodbrx	2014-06-09	Part III
Â 
The nonsense at the gate
Â 
The problems with the gate are so glaring that even non book readers pick it up at once. Here's a comment from the PTV unsullied.Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Keeping in mind that I have never actually been a NW nor tried to fend off giants nor mammoths from a 1000 ft plus ice wall, so I'm talking out my ass here, why did they not drop a bunch of flaming barrels right on the giant as he was trying to lift the outer gate?!? I mean shit, is that not obvious to everyone watching? You dont wait until he lifts the damn gate, you hit him before he opens the damnn gate, yanno, when he is still trying to lift it. DUH. Any NW should know that. That sort of lame detail breaks my concentration and my mind calls a big fat bullshit, taking me totally out of the moment.Â 
Â 
Exactly and this is one of the big problems with the scene.
Â 
Here's another: Why is the gate even 'liftable' ?Â 
Surely it should be secured by massive bolts and crossbars on the other side. Or are they so moronic to think the weight of the gate makes it secure enough?
Â 
Next: Once the giant lifts it up. He just goes inside and lets the gate drop, letting all the work go to waste, trapping himself inside.
WTF? How about 2 giants lift the gate, hold it open while a swarm of wildlings ( and say another giant ) go inside ?
Apparently, giants have peanut sized brains.
Â 
And the reaction of the NW to the giant lifting the door is: Let's go down and hold the gate.
How about: Let's drop things on him! And shoot him with a scorpion bolt. And have a bunch of men ALREADY in place, instead of clambering up and down the wall?
Â 
You know.. like the books?Â 
Damn, if only D & D read books.
Â 
No tactical thinking . No battering ram, no Turtle, no barrels filled with solid ice & gravel, no Donal Noye. Just mindless action.
Â 
And finally: If going up against a giant. Why not get a bunch of pikes and halberds? You could poke at him through the porticullis as one. Naah.. just turn up with whatever you have..
3415	Nictarion	2014-06-09	Season 1 is still easily my favorite Same here.
3416	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-09	I think Jon will send Tormund out to deal with the Wildlings and bring them back to the Wall...basically, just cut the middleman (Val) out and have Jon deal directly with Tormund.

This is just my thinking, of course...I could be totally wrong, but it makes sense to me XD


Â 
You may be right, I was just trying to think of other possibilities. Â The one thing that makes me think Tormund will not do the Winterfell duty in Mance's place is that I highly suspect that Mance is prisoner of The Bastard, if not dead, if even most of the pink letter is bullshit. Â
3417	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-09	Sure, the problem for me is that most of the deviations are just poorly written IMO. D&D are just not good at writing dialogue at all. So many cringe-worthy lines. So many plot holes too in almost every episode. Sure, there are some good changes, but most of them just don't work for me. Not because they are different from the novels, but because they jsut aren't that good IMO.


Â 
One of my main problems is that they don't keep track of their own changes and have them make sense, such as The Hound and his code about stealing until well.........he needs to steal something from someone. Â
3418	lostinwesteros	2014-06-09	My post got lost, and after searching and searching across all topics for this episode and the ones for predictions about episode 10, I still can't even find it in the thread I thought I posted it in - damn internet!
Anyway, my nitpick is actually in the preview for episode 10 shown at the end of this episode.  Arya is shown saying "there's people coming".  We know she is of noble birth and that her grammar is proper" (she speaks 'properly', as per that episode with Tywin when she was his cupbearer).  So why is she saying "There's people" instead of "There're people" ???  Has she been traveling with rough characters for so long that she's picked up their way of speaking?  I know this is a pretty minor point, but it really gave me a jolt when I heard it, and I'm completely mystified by it.   It's bugging me.
If anyone has a theory to share, please post it!  Thanks!

What a surprise we agree on something 
I do think season 4 will end up probably being my 2nd favorite but I feel like 2,3, and 4 are all of a very similar quality while season 1 is a notch above the other 3.
And yes lack of Mance this episode was a puzzling decision. Poor Caesar (

Excuse me this isn't an electrical system that you just have to 'put in motion'. And besides, we also see the kid do it a few other times.

Yeah, he will definitely die, but I've thought it would be closer to end.

And yes lack of Mance this episode was a puzzling decision. Poor Caesar (S2 had my favorite episode in "Blackwater", but they absolutely butchered Dany's storyline (especially the HOTU) which is unforgivable for me. But other than that 2,3, & 4 are all pretty close. S1 was the most faithful to the books, and surprise, surprise it's the best one.
3443	Angmar	2014-06-09	Ygritte. We're supposed to feel sad for her but imo the whole season she's been presented as a pyscho bitch, like all the other wildings. Didn't care for her death, I don't care for these people in general Â Â  I don't like HBO!Ygritte too much, her character is too much "strong independent womyn!!" for my liking.
Â 
Some of the deaths were too goofy. The anvil on Jon's face? That Thenn getting hammered?Â 
Â 
The Stannis cut. Not much for Stannis but because I wanted this storyline over for this episode. Seeing how packed next ep will be, adding this with Stannis and Mance will be even more stuff to deal with, and maybe another subplot will be cut. I swear if they cut again LS for ending with another dumb Khaleesi scene...*rage*

I have a fair few things to complain about: Lack of scale or epic feel, no real tension, lack of emotional depth (for me personally at least), a lot of cringeworthy dialogue, flat-out shitty Sam and Gilly scenes, etc. But the thing I really want to discuss, is
Â 
NO FUCKING STANNIS!!!
Â 
I checked, and this has been the shortest episode of Game of Thrones ever. They had ten minutes already left to put Jon's meeting with Mance and the arrival of Stannis, and they could have taken out the dumb Jon/Sam talk about sex. That would have given them almost fifteen minutes extra time! I understand that the battle spans over more than one night, but when you spend eight bloody episodes building UP to the battle, I expect that was done so the episode could be a complete package, not have some cheap and lazy cliffhanger at the end. The battle ended suddenly, and there was no proper climax.Â 
Â 
Now the result of this dumb decision is that Stannis' most heroic and cheer worthy moment will just be an afterthought, quickly wrapped up so we can get more Khaleesi and the funny dwarf, cause gods forbid Stannis gets any meaningful time dedicated to just him.
Â 
I think we Stannis fans have now officially earned the right to be pissed the fuck off at D&D, right...?
Â 


We earned that right a long time ago.

3449	ViennaGirl	2014-06-09	does anyone pay close attention to the theme music in different scenes? They played the Jon/Ygritte theme when she died - the first time I heard it when they fell in love, I was like, oh, that's what we'll be hearing when she dies, and yup. The music that started when Jon came out of the lift and joined the fight on the ground was a dramatic-sounding variation on the Stark theme that plays for the other Stark kids - I think maybe it played for Sansa last week. I'm looking for musical cues to the ending of the story (the ending of book 7...)
3450	MoIaF	2014-06-09	What a surprise we agree on something 
I do think season 4 will end up probably being my 2nd favorite but I feel like 2,3, and 4 are all of a very similar quality while season 1 is a notch above the other 3.
And yes lack of Mance this episode was a puzzling decision. Poor Caesar (


Â 
I agree, season 4 is better than seasons 2 & 3, however, they are all below season 1. I think the main problem is inconsistency. Season 2 was mostly a crap-shoot but there were a couple of good moments, season 3 was better but there was a lot of crap there too.
Â 
They need to be more consistent with the story telling and episode style in order to have a better season.

3452	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-09	My main nitpick about the tunnel scene is (aside from Donal Noye's non-existence, that is), the boys in the tunnel would have done better with some really long spears. At least a couple of them. Getting that part right would have cost the show-producers nothing, and changed nothing plot-wise.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Why did mance only have 2 giants and one mammoth? He could've won the war with three giants and two mammoths.


Â 
Â 
Favourite comment on that issue.
Â 
Yeah, and I guess the wildlings are not big on supporting their attacks.
Â 
If only some wildlings had rushed into the tunnel with the giant. They have so many, surely they could have spared a few dozen to just overwhelm the six guys guarding it.
I know they're not well-educated on the tactics and strategy stuff, but this seem obvious. "Create breach at the gate and exploit it" was their whole plan. How about actually following it ?

I actually liked that aspect of it. Ser Alliser Thorne is not a gutless wimp, he was a knight and for what it's worth, who still fights like one. A dangerous man, who does his duty, but still a prejudiced asshole.

Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in the middle of a battle sequence and youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re going to have this strong emotional moment. How do you do that? For me it was separating them from whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going on around them. It was at first going in close and then the final shot â<U+0080><U+0094> it was the only slow-motion shot I put in the whole thing.

3462	Nymeria Stone	2014-06-09	I really liked the episode, but there were a couple things that bothered me, like the fact that there didn't seem to have a hundred thousand wildilings at all. They were all scattered and not very intimidating.Â 
Â 
Also, why waste four barrels on five wildlings and then wait until the GIANT AND THE MAMMOTH were almost destroying the gate to do something about it.
Â 


Yes


No. Ygritte and Maester Aemon's lines were pretty good.

3464	Whipsy	2014-06-09	For me, and I'm sure it's been mentioned before, it was the wasted time with the Sam/Jon and Sam/Aemon scenes at the beginning. In my opinion neither was very good or worth the screentime. The episode was good but if they had managed their time better it could have been fantastic. I understand that we'll eventually get to see Stannis being a BAMF but I'm still butt-hurt over the fact that we were robbed of an amazingly exciting and uplifting ending because the episode was cut short and Sam and Jon need their time to talk about bewbs. Really, guys? Could have done without the beginning Yigritte "ain't nobody touchin' that Jon Snow tush, but me" scene. Ugh.

I would have preferred that they did something closer to how she died in the book. Jon never sees who fired the arrow which killed her. No time to weep over her as the battle is still going on, or even realize she's down.
Â 
It could still be the kid who does it, and maybe she's about the fire off the shot which would kill him, and hesitates long enough that the boy can actually get her. And then Jon finds her dying nearby. That would have brought them to the exact same place plot-wise, but then she's just another battle casualty.
Â 
On the other hand, I am glad they did not resort to having Sam fire the fatal shot. That would have been too much cheese.

Â 
I'm not sure what the show would have to do to get me to stop watching, the bad would have to really outweigh the good by miles and miles.Â  It always helps that I can and do reread.Â  The show can't take the story that's already written from me, I just wish GRRM would get busy with getting the rest of it out and about for all of us.Â

See I think what happened North of the Wall made sense. They were trying to distract the defenders and forcing them to keep some men atop the Wall while the real attack came from the South, it was the Southern attack that really did not make sense.

The first problem was Ygriite scouting out the strength holding the gate, why the heck would they have her do that? They have the owl guy, he would be able to get much more exact intelligence than she couid.

Secondly, the Wildling attack from the South lacked a clear objective and there was no discussion on what tactics to use to acheive that objective. So they get through Southern gate, what then? Maybe take the winch elevator out of comission so that no more reinforcements could come down and then take the Wall gate so the rest of the army could enter. Instead the plan was to kill crows and you had a bunch of people running around without any sort of purpose, why for instance were they trying to attack the kitchen?Â 
Â 
OK you could argue that the wildlings lack discipline so why not show that. The Owl Guy should have given them exact intelligence about where the Gate was and the elevator was and they should have had a plan but because Tormund and Magnarr maybe didn't get along and because once the battle started the command structure broke down the plan failed to be executed. It would have been better than what they did and it would have given the battle some structure instead of the free for all that we got.Â
3502	protar	2014-06-09	AÂ veryÂ small nitpick, but I really don't like the sound of the NW horn. It's too high pitched, it doesn't feel epic enough. Haven't liked it since the end of season 2. (Going back to S2, they really should have held that final horn blast off for a few seconds longer, really ramp up the tension.).
3503	The_Turncloak	2014-06-09	Tormund's story with the bear. We didn't get to hear it all.

3504	Veltigar	2014-06-09	I agree.Â  Also, I have a feeling that they'll abruptly end this season with Stannis riding in to save the day -Â that's it.Â  We won't see him victorious or see any of what comes next until the beginning of next season.Â  That will be their Wall cliffhanger.Â 


Ugh, that would be terrible. At least they should make clear that the NW won and have a first meeting between Jon and Stan the Man or Jon and Davos (or both).
Â 
Â 


I have watched only several of these, but isn't that always the case with them?


Yeah, but this time it's probably an even bigger circle jerk than usual.Â
3505	ViennaGirl	2014-06-09	A chipped tooth?Â  I don't even expect Jon to have a bruise from his face first into the anvil.


Â 
Totally agree - anyone who can get shot by three arrows and recover in about a day probably wouldn't bruise if you anviled him.

Â 
Â 
Well, yeah, they are not a professional army, no matter how many good warriors they may have.
Â 
Imagine, for example, if the wildlings from the south had attacked without screaming first ? Go in quick and quiet as they've done before? They might have gotten total surprise.
Â 
But then a counter-nitpick, as the Watch pretty much knows there are wildling raiders south of the wall, and Gilly just ran past the wildling camp to Castle Black (which the wildlings failed to notice?), so I suppose the wildlings would not have been able to achieve total surprise in any case.
Â 
I would not be surprised if the writers planned out two versions - one where Gilly escaping to Castle Black warns the Watch of their approach, but only after most of them are on top of the Wall (Problem = too much reliance on Gilly.); the other being what we actually saw.
3508	Prince of the North	2014-06-09	Ugh, that would be terrible. At least they should make clear that the NW won and have a first meeting between Jon and Stan the Man or Jon and Davos (or both).
Â 
Â 
Â 


Heh, I agree with you on this as well.Â  However, I could easily see them doing an end of season cliffhanger at the Wall in just this manner
3509	Veltigar	2014-06-09	A chipped tooth?Â  I don't even expect Jon to have a bruise from his face first into the anvil.


Can't hurt that face nor mess with the hair. That's GoT's real moneymaker. If anything happens to that, they can just insert a mop instead of Jon and have the other actors play against that.
Â 
Â 


See I think what happened North of the Wall made sense. They were trying to distract the defenders and forcing them to keep some men atop the Wall while the real attack came from the South, it was the Southern attack that really did not make sense.


Lol, the Northern attack didn't make sense as well. If they wanted to distract the NW men they should have mounted a fiercer attack on the gates. If Mance has more giants than why didn't he use them to shoot those arrows of theirs and break the top of the wall down.
Â 
Why weren't their climbers on other parts of the wall or why didn't they light fires one mile further, the NW would have to check that out. Also, the big fire only serves to paint them well against the ice. For a NW member with a ballista trying to bag himself a giant that light was a gift from the Gods.
Â 
Â 


The first problem was Ygriite scouting out the strength holding the gate, why the heck would they have her do that? They have the owl guy, he would be able to get much more exact intelligence than she couid.


So true, also why did the warg even participate in a head on assault. Any real life commander would get that he's much to valuable to use that way, especially since he controls a freaking bird and not a bear or a wolf.
Â

Obviously, the Thenns wanted the secure the kitchen in order to prepare their midnight snacks. Luckily, superhero cook stopped them! That guy was the most realistic warrior in this entire episode imo.

Â 
I'm not sure what the show would have to do to get me to stop watching, the bad would have to really outweigh the good by miles and miles.Â  It always helps that I can and do reread.Â  The show can't take the story that's already written from me, I just wish GRRM would get busy with getting the rest of it out and about for all of us.Â 


Personally, I won't stop watching even if it get's to tWD levels of quality. I want to be there to see spoilers for the books 
Â 
However, lately I have been thinking about watching the show drunk. It means that I'll have to wait a little while to see it, since Uni won't allow me to do that directly when the episodes comes out. But I could plan for it, if the booze shuts down my critical reasoning skills, I'll like this show a lot more.
Â 
I'm just sad that ASOIAF didn't get the dramatic adaptation it deserves. It's no the wire or Hannibal or any of the other greats. It's more like tWD and suits and that stuff. Fluff, entertaining fluff, but still fluff that tries to disguise itself as a serious drama.

3517	Maid So Fair	2014-06-09	I sort of understand the purpose of the southern attack on the wall, which presumably is the same as in the books just slightly better coordinated - opening the gate lets Mance use his superior numbers to wipe out the Night's Watch with hardly any losses. Assaulting the Wall is costly. It's just the details of the attack that make little sense.

I think this particular episode is a testament to the fact that they can divert from canon and do it well. They made me sympathise with Thorne! Jon's mission to kill Mance makes more sense than his parley in the books IMHO. The southern attack on the wall coinciding with the main thrust is good as well. There are other examples in other episodes like Arya and the Hound.
3518	Humble Maester	2014-06-09	Well I do have fair amount of nits to pick but I'll just say the one thing that's on top of my mind. Did they just waste their "big battle of the season" on "Mance just testing us", with couple of giants and one mammoth. Seriously.

Â 

Yeah, a bloody mouth and a concussion, at least. Adrenaline only lasts a short while after all.

He's got a bloody head, bloody nose (maybe broken) and bruises around his eye in the last scene before he walks out of the tunnel:

3520	Miodrag	2014-06-09	This "Inside the Episode" was hands down, the worst, most lame one of the entire series. Â Everyone patting each other on the back for what a fantastic episode they put together. Â 


Â 
Have to disagree, because of my personal reasons: I finally got some long awaited satisfaction.
Â 
You see, two years ago, on this very site I raised the issue of two scenes - one from episode 1x05 and one from episode 2x05 - in which parts of the action were sped up in the editing, in order for fighting to look more effective. And I heavily criticized D&D for that choice. I said it's a blasphemy no respectable show/movie would ever allow itself. Now, to say that I was heavily criticized for that criticism would be an understatement. Loads of show lovers were attacking and insulting me, saying, among other things, that I obviously know nothing about editing nor about television. By numerous posters, some of them professional editors (or so they claimed), speeding-up was described as a standard editing technique that is used all the time in movies and TV. Someone linked my essay on WiC.net, and posters there were even more furious at myself, with some going as far as speculating that I don't even exist - that it's just Elio&Linda (or even Martin himself) writing under false identity, because they secretly hate D&D because of the show's success.
Â 
So it is with great surprise and ultimate pleasure that I watched D.B. Weiss, of all people, essentially admitting the criticism of that editing was very justified. In "Inside the episode" video, starting at 4:21, Weiss says that Kit was so good in action scenes, that at one instance they (presumably he and Benioff) thought someone sped up the raw footage, and they wanted it brought back to normal speed. Weiss' words: "It looks fake, it looks too fast, can we fix whatever somebody did to that shot?" Eventually, after a visual effects editor checked the scene, it turned out nobody sped-up anything, just Kit was that fast. But, that's beside my point. And my point is: thank you, Mr. Weiss, for confirming that what you did in episodes 1x05 and 2x05 was very, very wrong. It was so wrong that, this time around, you insisted on fixing the scene you thought was sped-up, before the expert convinced you there's no need for fixing, because nobody sped-up the footage. A better man probably wouldn't enjoy this turn of events as much as I do at the moment. And a big hello to all those experts that for two years were calling me ignorant, prick, jerk, king of nitpicking, hateful purist, and so on.

I very much agree with the bolded. This is the true tragedy of it all. The show as it is now is good casual entertainment and holds up well compared to most of what is on TV and all, but it really could have beenÂ so muchÂ more than what it is, Â if it hadn't been written and directed by hacks. Now it will probably be decades before we can get a real adaption of ASOIAF, if we ever get one at all (depends very much on how well GRRM ends up finishing the series I think).Â

Yes, but in the books he has no choice in the matter while in the show he chooses to go because he decides it's the only way they stand a chance. It's more powerful that way and shows him in much more of a leading role. I love that he has a choice between his honour and a shot at saving his brothers and he chooses the Night's Watch.

They held off an attack from two sides, and the only attack that hurt them at all (aside from one of the two giants) was decided. They won. The other attack they just have stand on the wall and seal the tunnels. Not sure why he thought he needed to go out and kill Mance. Without a sword. At the very least he could have traded swords with Sam or some other brother. Going out without a weapon is just bad writing.
Â 



Honestly, I see more negativity in these threads than praise, because people act like the show is blaspheming a sacred text...but there's never been any show or movie that stayed completely and utterly faithful to its source material. And deviating from the source material isn't necessarily a bad thing...especially in the case of ASoIaF, where there are SOOOO many expendable characters and plot lines. Many book readers agree that Martin often has too much superfluous material, and that it's not all necessary to the overarching story. Yes, I have things I like in the story; but no, I'm not devastated when I don't see them on screen. And I would be the first to admit that many of the things I like in the story don't necessarily translate well onscreen. And when a moment that I love from the books DOES come onscreen, I don't mind if some things have been changed. Example: I loved Noye in the books...he was awesome, but he's not in the show. When I saw Grenn taking his place in the tunnel, I was really glad that we still got that moment, although with a different character. I can see the point in Grenn taking Noye's place in this situation, and the sacrifice still came off well...probably better than it did in the books, if I'm honest.
Book readers â<U+0089>  people who don't like the show, basically.

This thread is specifically for people to nitpick and pull apart what they don't like about the episode. Without repercussion. You shouldn't be in this thread arguing with people, that is not what this is for. This is the second thread I've seen you derailing by being contrary to the thread's intent. Your discussion and points would better fit in one of the other threads. Thank you.

That's really debatable. In the books, he's forced to do it, which really drives home that even in such a crisis, personal vendetta's and hate still muck up things. It's very much in line with the themes of the book. In the show we get a generic "oh, I'll sacrifice myself for ta, no prob", if people think Jon is a mary sue in the books than on the show they have removed all traces of doubt.
3532	Shadow Tower	2014-06-09	Yes, but in the books he has no choice in the matter while in the show he chooses to go because he decides it's the only way they stand a chance.

Sorry, but how does him going on a suicide mission that will accomplish nothing (he himself says so) help the watch. They are down one man... and nothing else. He doesn't even take his sword with him. Not that the watch would need every man they got...
Â 
In the books it's a hardly concealed attempt of Thorne and Slynt to get rid of him which goes wrong for reasons they couldn't have foreseen. But now? It's just some stupid comical heroism without any justification...

I feel like the writers of TwD actually try, like they have ambition or something. Â There have actually been a couple of episodes in the past of TwD with some pretty damn good writing.

3535	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-09	TWD is an original story, ja? Like, its not an adaptation? GoT is an adaptation so a lot of stuff is actually written for the show runners. They're writing new material due to deviations while still trying to come to the same conclusions of plot lines with the books. Its actually harder than it sounds and i think they are doing a decent job of it for the most part. I dont likeÂ everything they come up with, but i dont have any huge beefs.
Â 
I did have one beef about this episode and it wasnt Stannis not showing up.
Why didnt we see Mance at all?? Man....even a scene where hes helping order the wildlings around and him going "ATTACK!" would have been ok. But the lack of Mance was just a pisser.
3536	Cas Stark	2014-06-09	Personally, I won't stop watching even if it get's to tWD levels of quality. I want to be there to see spoilers for the books 
Â 
However, lately I have been thinking about watching the show drunk. It means that I'll have to wait a little while to see it, since Uni won't allow me to do that directly when the episodes comes out. But I could plan for it, if the booze shuts down my critical reasoning skills, I'll like this show a lot more.
Â 
I'm just sad that ASOIAF didn't get the dramatic adaptation it deserves. It's no the wire or Hannibal or any of the other greats. It's more like tWD and suits and that stuff. Fluff, entertaining fluff, but still fluff that tries to disguise itself as a serious drama.


Â 
That might backfire on you and instead of lulling your sense to sleep, you get fired up into a drunken rage, although, possibly if I had been drunk for the "let's save Theon, oh, who let the dogs out" segment I may have found it hysterically funny as only a drunk can. Â
3537	Maid So Fair	2014-06-09	That's really debatable. In the books, he's forced to do it, which really drives home that even in such a crisis, personal vendetta's and hate still muck up things. It's very much in line with the themes of the book. In the show we get a generic "oh, I'll sacrifice myself for ta, no prob", if people think Jon is a mary sue in the books than on the show they have removed all traces of doubt.


Â 
Â 


Sorry, but how does him going on a suicide mission that will accomplish nothing (he himself says so) help the watch. They are down one man... and nothing else. He doesn't even take his sword with him. Not that the watch would need every man they got...
Â 
In the books it's a hardly concealed attempt of Thorne and Slynt to get rid of him which goes wrong for reasons they couldn't have foreseen. But now? It's just some stupid comical heroism without any justification...


Â 
Your mileage may vary as to whether it's comical or tragic. The Craster's scene might have been mostly pointless, but it shows Thorne and Slynt's willingness to just send Jon to his death pretty well. Exploring what honour truly is and whether what is honourable is also always right has been an one of the most important themes of the books and wondering if you should root for someone who wants to kill an enemy under the peace flag to save his friends/protect the innocent is a perfect example of that. It is even more poignant since at some level Mance is doing the same thing, killing his old brothers to protect innocent people from the White Walkers.
Â 
It might be a long shot, but at this point it's all they've got and there IS a chance of success. There's what, 50 of them left? Mance can have 50 parties like Tormunds climb the wall and attack from the south, without even diminishing the main assault.Â
3538	Paid the Iron Price	2014-06-09	To be hones the TV-serie is blasphemous to the books.
Â 
fight scenes were bad. 1vs1 all the way around and Ygritte the sniper /facepalm.
3539	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-09	TWD is an original story, ja? Like, its not an adaptation? GoT is an adaptation so a lot of stuff is actually written for the show runners. They're writing new material due to deviations while still trying to come to the same conclusions of plot lines with the books. Its actually harder than it sounds and i think they are doing a decent job of it for the most part. I dont likeÂ everything they come up with, but i dont have any huge beefs.
Â

I'm not sure about the whole series, but TWD is based on a comic book.
Â 
I'm not too mad at no Mance, but would have enjoyed a couple scenes with him in it. Maybe they could have shown him building that big ass fire.
3540	The Red Melli	2014-06-09	Thank god there's actually criticism here about the writing on GoT.
Everyone on other forums loved the "Beetle scene" I felt like I was Â the only one who thought it was absolute horse shit.
3541	Simon Steele	2014-06-09	As per this show being on par with the Walking Dead level of viewing:
Â 
I was listening to the Indoor Kids podcast today and they were talking about the Viper and Mountain episode and how the gore and moment really paid off (man they said some stupid shit on that podcast, like they trusted DnD more than Martin to make this story good!?), and that's one of the things that really gets me. This show COULD be so good. Yes it was gory when the trial by combat ended, and yes it was shocking, but the gore of it kind of ruined everything about that story. I just got past the duel last night on my reread and it was described almost exactly as the show portrayed it, but the book didn't cheapen it with that. How much more powerful would it have been to see some blood, but to not see of what happened. I know the book said Oberyn got his teeth knocked out, but we didn't need to see it. It feels like grue intended to only make us vomit, it feels like a cheap low budget horror movie that doesn't respect its characters, and when you get a guy like Pascal bringing Oberyn to life in an unbelievable way like he did, to cheapen it with stupid bloody horror movie tactics is just awful. It happened with the Red Wedding scene too, and all of these moments that crushed me in the book left me feeling...dirty? Mildly disgusted, like I was in high school again and rented a horror movie that didn't deserve my time. To imply these moments visually would have left us far more crushed, I think, but maybe that's just me because people seem to be lapping this stuff up.
Â 
But it crosses into this episode too, with Pyp's death being overly bloody. I'm surprised we didn't see Grenn's head get crushed (as it happened to Donal in the book), or one of the Watch guys with him get their head twisted off. The hammer to the head of the Thenn was pure f13th circa 1986 level of violence. It just doesn't work for me. I love horror movies, or I did once, it doesn't fit with this. These things that happen are so cheapened by the in-your-face shock attempts.
Â 
I'm really disappointed, I think this series deserved better. I'm willing to forgive some of the things like four wildlings climbing the wall and like 2 giants, I get that these guys don't have the money to do it right (though I think more talented directors and cinematographers could create an illusion of great battles), but the huge missteps they make in how it is given to us makes me sad.
Â 
In some ways I hope we get a remake some day to do it right. Though I will always be sad that there was so much promise with this show with guys like Pascal and Dinklage and the guys who play Tywin and Jaime. I'll be sad too that Sean Bean couldn't bring Ned to life the way I thought he would (the way he made Boromir so awesome).
Â 
I suppose I'll keep watching, though it has marred my reading experience a bit. I think I will only stop when the shows pass the books.


I'm not touching that can of worms with a ten feet pole  Both have very shitty writing, but to decide which is the worst... Hard imo, but I'd give it to tWD. At least we get a "Jaime in the bathtub" sequence every once in a while. tWD doesn't even have that.
Â 
Â 
He'll razzle dazzle Mance with his hair, steal a weapon and then kill him of course. Or perhaps supercook will come to his aid with his giant meat cleaver.


Â 
Lol, I can't imagine Kit razzling anything!

No, TwD is based off the comic books. Â I think what really helps there is that the writer of the comics, Robert Kirkman, works very closely with the showrunners. Â He has a lot more involvement in the show than GRRM ever had in GoT, who basically has none.Â

It is. Â The amount of critical acclaim for this show blows my mind. Â I'm in the minority of people who critique shows who don't like it, although yes, I'm biased, I suppose. Â Even if I was Unsullied, however, I can't imagine liking the beetle scene or Ygritte's cheesy death. Â Just compare the beetle monologue to the worst monologue ever in The Sopranos, and The Sopranos one is still about 1000x better. Â

@Veltigar Â Dornish wine all around, it might help. Â That brings me to something I did realize even before this episode started. Â I had a feeling this epi would not live up to the hype of being the equal to Blackwater just because I do think Cersei's wine-induced torture snark to Sansa added to the total package of that episode. Â I can't praise both Lena and Sophie enough for those scenes. Â That just reminds me of THIS:

3550	Velociraptor	2014-06-09	I loathe the plot armor that Jon so obviously has. I understand they need to show him in danger due to tension and have him escape that danger, but getting his mouth smashed into that anvil was laughable. And after that he smiled with perfect pearly whities at Ygritte moments later. Given how they showed a character's head get crushed with bare hands in the last episode, having someone get smashed headfirst into an anvil and then walking away with only a few drops of blood from the mouth to show for it was just so inconsistent. At best Jon would have had his front teeth broken, possibly his jaw too. Most likely eating soup for the rest of his life. That is, if he even survived that hit in the first place. Either don't show such things at all, or have the balls to show the consequences somewhat. That was just ridiculous.Â

Â 
You make it sound like George's writing takes a subtle approach to violence. To me the books deal with violence very directly and explicitly. I always get vivid images in my head of gory details when reading of moments like the trial by combat. I agree that violence can often be better expressed with subtlety, but I don't agree that subtlety would make a scene like that more faithful to the books.
Â 
One of the things that's been bothering me for a while is Tormund's role. I just loved his character so much in the books, and I think the show has captured little of his charm. The actor is alright, but none of his more endearing dialogues ever make it into the show. I really wish we could see his conversation with Jon after Jon leaves to find Mance. That is such a beautiful moment, when amidst all the warfare they communicate almost like old friends. It dissolves the tension perfectly, but keeps intrigue afloat. I suppose it was too late for that to happen once they had Tormund over the wall with Ygritte, but I still wish for it. They've made Tormund out to be just another mean-looking wildling.
Â 
Overall though I liked the episode.
3556	Tadco26	2014-06-09	I don't think that D&D are purposely trying to troll the series.Â  They will follow the very rough outline of the story.Â  The thing is that paraphrasing what GRRM has saidÂ "It is the journey that makes the story as much as getting to the destination."Â  He knows where the story is going and so do D&D and I'm sure we will get there.Â  It just may not be along the same path.Â 
Â 
I just don't trust D&D's improvising skills and it seems like they feel they can make "improvements" where there doesn't seem to be any need to make a change.Â  IE, they have the character already on the cast needed for a good book scene, they have the screen time, it's not a scene that requires an extensive budget, and they just make something else up in it's place.

It's good that you're able to differentiate. Â I just can't bring myself to accept that the adaptation based off my favorite author ever is written by very poor writers who think they're better than him. Â Maybe one day I can accept it, but alas...perhaps not.Â

3562	Buckbeak	2014-06-09	I am confused, havent read books for a long time now so I am probably wrong but I thought there were two battles at the NW, first from the south when Ygritte dies, then a few hours/days later from Mance? So if this was only focusing on the first "mini" battle, then why would you expect to see Stannis anyway? He arrived when Jon went to speak to Mance which was days later right?
Â I guess the episode was just too short and may have been rushed if they had Jon go and see him then Stannis come. I just hope they dont pile it all into the next episode as I am assuming that is focusing on Tyrion.Â 
Â 
My nitpick really is Ghost. Thought they would show him killing more wildings, rather than just the one then eating for the rest of the show.Â 
I dont like any Sam/Gilly scene, I think thats just me though, and would rather watch action than the whole romance thing.Â 
I am not sure what they are going to show in next weeks episode now, there is just way too much to fit in, so they are either going to miss ALOT out or going to be very confusing episode and keep going back and forth to different characters.Â
3563	Guard of the Rainking	2014-06-09	I agree that D&D have ruined a lot of stuff, but does that actually make the show Walking Dead level bad?

Â 
Strange enough, some people seem to think that D&D's writing job is actually hard. But it isn't. In fact, they've chosen the easiest way to adapt this series, as far as writing goes. They decided to deliver the story only in "real time" fashion, without even trying to cover bigger amounts of time and space in characters' sequences, which is what books do all the time, practically in every chapter (incidentally, the rare exceptions are precisely the chapters that deal with Blackwater Battle and the Battle at the Wall, which mostly happen in real time too, and the show decided to abandon its usual format precisely in corresponding episodes). Now, I can't say it was a good or a bad decision. As far as I can remember, no show or a movie ever managed to that on a regular basis (possible exception is Godfather 2, which turned Martin-style exposition into a separate storyline), so I don't really hold it against D&D for not going there. But, the fact remains that, thanks to that choice, the writing for GOT is not too big a challenge, really. Especially in the fourth season, by which they should already be familiar with budget, casting, schedule and other issues that may complicate the final product.
3566	Veltigar	2014-06-09	Veto on PJ. Guy would make a three hour movie where Tyrion is just singing songs for an hour before getting to badly directed action scenes where Jon Snow and Dany hop from WW to WW and kill them all of.Â

3569	Miodrag	2014-06-09	If we compare Breaking Bad with the source material of GOT, then yes, GOT has the better story. I happen to think the source material for GOT provides the best story hat ever hit the screen. All due respect to The Sopranos, The Wire, True Detective, and other usual suspects, but ASOIAF is way richer plot-wise, thematically, characterization-wise... However, what we got just doesn't do justice to the source material. And GOT is not nearly as good as even some overrated shows like Breaking Bad are. Now, I quit The Walking Dead after season one, so I can't compare the two, but here are some questions that can help perhaps:

Does TWD have whores that refuse diamonds? Or whores that give the money back if they're satisfied? Or a character whose face is supposed to be lot stronger than an anvil? Or major characters releasing their crucial prisoners of war for no reason? And so on. If yes, than the two shows are comparable. If not, I'd say we have a clear winner.

The first season of tWD was the best season they had. After that the drop in quality was mindboggling (yes, even worse than GoT). I can't go into specifics, since I watch every episode only once and don't really like it. But from the top of my hat:
Â 
1) there is a guy who for no reason at all guns down his own men
2) there's a character who wants to be a good mother but drops her son of with everyone else whenever she gets the chance
3) The fact that characters still get killed by zombies after what they been through
4) Gas in cars lasting for eternity
5) improbable amount of headshots
6) Lori
7) Andrea
8) Carl
9)...
Â 
there is so much wrong with this
3572	The Lord of Cinder	2014-06-09	Personally I liked the episode a lot, and I'm not even a huge Jon or Sam fan. But after this episode I think I like show Sam better than book Sam.
Â 
I wish this episode had been the 66 minutes episode, so we could have gotten the Mance Rayder and Stannis stuff at the end. But it was just 50 minutes, and it's true that it would have been too Blackwaterish. So even though I'm a bit diappointed, I kinda get it. I still think they made the wrong choice.
Â 
My biggest nitpick is that Ygritte, Styr and Tormund alone seemed to kill more than half of the 102 men defending the Wall. Then think about all those on top of the Wall and the six who died in the tunnel. The Night's Watch shouldn't exist anymore! But I don't really care. Unlike a lot of people here, I don't think some missteps makes this "the worst thing since Dragonball: Evolution".
3573	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-09	Overall a horrible episode. Here's the things I didn't like:
Â 
Every bit of dialogue. From the awkward small talk, to the misplaced comic relief, to the underwhelming battle speeches. Nothing said in this episode was impactful in any way. Ygritte's last words about the cave were the only exception to this though the scene was sullied by what was going on around her and Jon. They killed about ten men each just a few moments ago but it's cute that they can still find it in themselves to trade sappy lines right in the middle of the battle.
Â 
The Hollywood-inspired combat sequences. Nothing seemed real. Nearly every extra who died on screen did so immediately after being swung on one single time with a sword and it seemed as if they were all specifically instructed by the choreographer in charge to scream absurdly and exaggerate their body movements during battle. And while all these supposedly seasoned men were dying left and right, Jon Snow was hacking his foes apart without issue save for the big baddy at the end. I'm sorry but when I read the books, Jon Snow did not strike me as a killing machine. It's ridiculous how over powered the main characters in this episode were compared to all the random, nameless watchmen and wildings. If you were facing Ser Alliser, Jon Snow, Tormund, Ygritte, or the Thenn, you didn't stand a chance. Unless of course you were Ser Alliser, Jon Snow, Tormund, Ygritte, or the Thenn.
Â 
The deaths of Grenn and Pyp.Â What a lousy way to send off two supporting characters who have been with us from the start. I know D&D wanted to add some sort of price to be had for the battle and killing off Pyp and Grenn (even though they're both still alive in the books) seemed like an easy route, but why were their deaths so completely lacking in dramatic quality? One is shot through the neck and dies impassively five seconds later staring into space. The other is found dead. It just didn't feel right. If they were going to kill them both off, I would have preferred them to space their deaths out a little more than that. And Sam, who was supposed to be as close a friend as either of them had ever had, displayed no emotion whatsoever concerning their demise. All he responded to emotionally was Gilly and that, to me, makes his character a lot less likable. I might have to blame this on John Bradley's acting ability though, or lack thereof. He's not necessarily bad but he by no means has the chops to be one of the main focuses of an entire episode and keep the viewer interested.
Â 
The cheesy action scenes that didn't make any sense. I like to think most people who have read the books are not entertained by things that look cool over that which is logical and still compelling. Multiple things in this episode were unfortunately put into the episode just because they looked cool. The watchman that was shot with a giant arrow landing perfectly 700 ft below, impaling the ground. The massive scythe flail that miraculously hit every wilding climber in one fell swingÂ (why would the Watch build a weapon of such size and unreliability for one single use at the cost of the Wall's integrity?). Jon's face being smashed into an anvil and coming out of the fight unscathed. The tunnel door still functioning as well as ever despite being severely damaged by two giants and a mammoth... In order to enjoy these things, you must either have no semblance of anÂ idea how they'd work in the real world or issue a willing suspension of disbelief because what you are seeing on screen is just so engaging. For me, nothing on screen was that engaging, so I was left to lament on the ludicrosityÂ of the episode's many impossible scenarios.Â 
Â 
The length and pacing. I never had a problem that they were dedicating a whole 50 uninterrupted minutes to the battle at the Wall. But I suspected, on account of that, I'd see a lot more than I actually did. There were a bunch of useless scenes in this episode between characters I could have done without. None of them were done well from Alliser & Jon to Sam & Aemon. Seemed like dribble compared to the usual stuff the show's writers think up. When it came to the combat, the siege on Castle Black from the south lasted far too long. Before the battle, Ygritte counted twenty men at the gate. When Ser Alliser goes down the lift, it's revealed that there is a force of at least 50 on the ground. Maybe it would have made sense if the watchmen were actually holding the castle but they were just throwing themselves at wildings in the courtyard. I feel like the battle on that side had no progression at all. They shot a few arrows in the beginning but after that, it was just one big melee that went on forever.Â Castle Black had no walls on the southern side in the books but upon watching the episode again, I can see that they gave them one for the show. More time could have been spent on the watchmen holding that wall but it was overran with ease while Alliser was busy giving his speech. Even with a force of 50 warriors on either side, it should have been over in a period of ten minutes or less. No time to send someone up to the top of the Wall and request help, no time for Slynt to come down, and no time to send Grenn down with reinforcements. The lift goes 700 ft up and 700 ft down each time at a rate of 5 mph or less. It seems unlikely that it would be able to make it up and down that many times even given the longitude of the battle. If they had cut it down to the point where the end to this episode happened at the 30 minute mark rather than the 50, the episode could have concluded with Jon being saved by the bell in Mance's tent by Stannis's cavalry (a much better cliffhanger than the one we got).

3575	Miodrag	2014-06-09	The way I see writing, one of its basic purposes is not to drop the ball. Regardless of how good your overall story may be, you must not let some parts be jarringly inconsistent, let alone to be in a clear discord with the rest. And GOT is dropping the ball too damn often. Jon surviving that anvil without a scratch is very damaging for the credibility of the show that presumes to portray human drama: if faces in this world don't act like human faces do, then how the hell is a viewer to be seriously invested in the human aspect of the story?! Practically, in every episode there is some complete nonsense. Not all of that is the writing. For example, even the much praised "Blackwater" has to look somewhat ridiculous now. I mean, just remember those moronic shots of people or their heads being cut in half! Thankfully, Marshal spared us of that content this time around. But, in 99% of the cases, it's D&D's writing that delivers the most ludicrous content in GOT, the content that can't help but damage the credibility of the overall story. Of course, it looks like the credibility is not too important for the general audience, which is fine, I guess, because the credibility of the story is maybe not the only quality one can enjoy while watching a TV show. For me its one of the crucial ones, but GOT numbers and ratings prove millions and millions look at that quite differently than myself.
Â 
Veltigar,
Â 
Just for the fun of it. I'm going to try to reply, even though I obviously don't know anything about those points, since I don't watch TWD.
Â 
About the guy killing his own men for no reason: we had that in GOT, too. Tywin's killing his own men in season two, when Gregor investigates who murdered Amory. And just remember that it was all happening just an episode or two after the very same Tywin Lannister saved some prisoners, because his army needs every single body. So, in GOT we have a guy who not only kills his own people for no reason, but also saves his enemies at the same time.
Â 
About mother who wants to be a good mother, TV Cat effectively ruined TV Robb's entire war effort for no reason, just like he himself tells her. And she's supposed to care about him. Also, TV Robb's supposed to care about his brothers, but, when he finds out TV Theon captured them, he - falls in love with a foreign nurse. Also, we have Selyse, who, while she keeps her stillborn babies in jars (?!), she doesn't seem to be too protective over that one daughter she actually did give birth to. And what to say about Starks in general: only TV Sansa seemed to be grieving after her mother and brother, though lately even she managed to deal with it somehow.
Â 
The rest of your points about TWD look incomparable to me.

Â 
wait, wat?
3577	Boxus	2014-06-09	I really think that actor could have done a great job with Tormund if the writers gave him more of his book lines, or at least versions of them, and if the directors told him to play it loose, to have fun. I feel like all they say to the wildling actors is "you're bad. look bad! look mean and fierce!"
For the record, I think GoT is not as good a show as Breaking Bad, but much better than Walking Dead.
3578	Miodrag	2014-06-09	teemo, 
Â 
Watched Breaking Bad all the way through the end, but honestly, ever since season two it was all downhill for me. First two seasons of BB were great, very refreshing as a TV storytelling, but after that it wasn't nearly as good. Now, it had brilliant moments, and it never had anything as ridiculous as GOT does so often, and I think BB is among the better shows I watched, but I can't count it among personal all-time favorites: The Wire, The Sopranos and True Detective.

Yeah I'm going to have to disagree here. It's also baffling because you're pointing out how unrealistic Jon not smashing all his teeth is, but your favorite BB seasons are the ones that have the most fake science, unrealistic events and requires the most suspension of belief?
3581	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-09	Much and more has been said and picked upon. I was rather unmoved by the whole episode (which isn't a good sign, really). But that anvil! Why for the love of Gods did they have to put that scene in? It's just so ridiculous. Smash the pretty boy face first onto a fucking anvil without so much as giving him a scratch... why? Why?

Don't forget getting is face clawed apart by an eagle, then getting short with 3 hours and then falling off a horse breaking at least two of the arrows inside him.

Just 'cause you didn't like the episode doesn't mean everyone else is batshit insane.

Â Atleast Tormund is alive. Ygritte deserved an arrow just for cutting off Tormund's bear story.


There was something really off about Ygritte - too hysterical for some reason.Â  And then Tormund looking rather scared for a few seconds kind of made me wince.Â  I don't recall Tormund being so easily intimidated.Â  
Â 

>Melisandre gives Davos a high five


That's just so amusing to picture.Â  
Â 


They should have killed him. Edd isn't the real Dolorous Edd anyway, Grenn on the other hand was played by a very good actor, he should have remained.


The outcries would have been too much for the internet to handle.Â  Then the change from 'Edd, fetch me...' to 'Grenn - or Sam -, fetch me...' would have made book-readers implode/explode in the fury.Â 
I'm really sad to see Grenn and Pyp go (I remember being rather sad in the first episode of Misfits because of him).
Â 


Sometimes I feel like this entire forum has turned into D&D fanatics. Maybe it's the percolation of show-only viewers. Or it's just people who have made their internal peace with the show and just see it as different from the books.
Â 
Well done, Dumb & Dumber. Well done.


I'm pretty sure many of us who enjoy the show don't worship D&D as much as those who dislike the show worship aSoIaF.Â 
I don't worship the books (and haven't read any other books from the author), but I do enjoy this particular story.Â  I'm not a fanatic, a show-apologist, or (as a poster here and there surmises about those who enjoy watching GoT) stupid. I like the story, that's it.
Â 
As for the Dumb and Dumber line?Â  Keep in mind that the author himself was the one who gave D&D permissionÂ  to play with his characters.Â 
Â 


Anyway, my nitpick is actually in the preview for episode 10 shown at the end of this episode. Arya is shown saying "there's people coming". We know she is of noble birth and that her grammar is proper" (she speaks 'properly', as per that episode with Tywin when she was his cupbearer). So why is she saying "There's people" instead of "There're people" ??? Has she been traveling with rough characters for so long that she's picked up their way of speaking? I know this is a pretty minor point, but it really gave me a jolt when I heard it, and I'm completely mystified by it. It's bugging me.
If anyone has a theory to share, please post it! Thanks!


I don't know about anyone else, but I was raised to speak 'the Queen's tongue' whilst growing up.Â  If I couldn't speak proper english, I wasn't to speakÂ  at all.Â  Then at the age of 20 I moved to a largely french-speaking town and scandalised everyone by suddenly developing 'gutter english' due to uttering most words with a pronounced french-speaking influence.Â Â  I assume the same thing is happening to Arya.
Â 


TWD is an original story, ja?


Nope, TWD is a comic book (or graphic novel) adaptation.
And the same divisiveness in the fanbase that is happening here is happening to them.Â 
Â 

http://www.collegehu...es-season-2-rpg
Â 


I do enjoy College Humor, and how much fun they have with GoT.Â 
 
Â 


Â 
I will stand by my word and differentiate between novel vs a TV adaptation and try to enjoy each for what they give to me. I always take books over any series but I try to not let it all get to me is all its miracle they have been able to adapt as much as they have adapted. Â 


 
Unless someone else can come up with 60 to 100 million, this is the adaptation we've got (plus the graphic novel/comic book version from what I've heard).

Â 
This whole season has pretty much sucked in my opinion, and its a direct result of these asshat writers continuing to let the story devolve from the original into typical Hollywood garbage.
Â 
That fucking giant arrow thing was aÂ totally unnecessary invention in line with what I absolutely hate the most about Hollywood action films.Â 
Â 
Its akin to the raping of the Hobbit/LOTR story by Hollywood, with each film containingÂ 1 hour of decent story and 2 hours of stupid, overly bombastic, completely unbelievable action, hobbits flying through the air in a rain shower of house sized boulders and coming out totally unscathed......aaaaarggg!

It blows my mind people are calling this one of the best episodes ever but then again, should I really be surprised? Look at the biggest blockbusters of our time.

3586	Alia Atreides	2014-06-09	Â 
Strange enough, some people seem to think that D&D's writing job is actually hard. But it isn't. In fact, they've chosen the easiest way to adapt this series, as far as writing goes. They decided to deliver the story only in "real time" fashion, without even trying to cover bigger amounts of time and space in characters' sequences, which is what books do all the time, practically in every chapter (incidentally, the rare exceptions are precisely the chapters that deal with Blackwater Battle and the Battle at the Wall, which mostly happen in real time too, and the show decided to abandon its usual format precisely in corresponding episodes). Now, I can't say it was a good or a bad decision. As far as I can remember, no show or a movie ever managed to that on a regular basis (possible exception is Godfather 2, which turned Martin-style exposition into a separate storyline), so I don't really hold it against D&D for not going there. But, the fact remains that, thanks to that choice, the writing for GOT is not too big a challenge, really. Especially in the fourth season, by which they should already be familiar with budget, casting, schedule and other issues that may complicate the final product.


Â 
Both of those things because you can have a great story it but it starts to be cost-effective for HBO it won't last; that is sadly what happened with their Rome Series it was originally slated for 7 seasons that got cut to Two for the expense of it to make etc.Â 
Â 
To be honestly while I don't always agree with the changes made I have seen worse done to beloved books that were put to film media.Â
3587	Mulled Wino	2014-06-09	Worst episode I"ve ever seen. Â So the Watch was surprised by the attack from south of the wall?
Â 
There was absolutely nothing I liked about this. Â Allister being the hype man, slant being a coward, sam being a tough guy, the watch losing about 100 men yet only having 100 before this episode, the remaining crows continuing to say they are outnumbered 100-1, not letting ghost out to fight until the very end of the battle. Â No planning for the wildlings on the south of the wall, none of that makes sense.

As it's been pointed out endlessly on this board, everyone has different tastes.Â  There is no right or wrong unless you've determined it to be so.
I liked the episode, and gave it major thumbs up for Neil Marshall making me cheer for Alliser, a character I loathe. He did the same thing to me in Dog Soldiers when I started cheering for Joe, Spoon, Terry, Cooper and Sarge over the werewolf gang.Â  I never cheered for humans over werewolves before that.Â Â 
It boils down to being a matter of opinion.Â  You have yours, so please don't demean those of us who have shared our own as well.Â

3592	Night'sQueen	2014-06-09	My nitpicks have all been mentioned, mainly:
- filler scenes (Jon and Sam having the talk about the birds & the bees was particularly painful)
- Gilly strolling past the wildlings unnoticed 
- pointless owl warging bit
- so many NW dying that it's really not believable that the wildlings didn't win on the Castle Black side
- no Mance 
- Ghost should have gone berserker on screen
- Jon's face fought an anvil and won
Bigger than a nitpick though is this shit dialog they keep writing. The dialog in some of those filler pre-battle scenes was like soap opera-level drek.

I liked the episode, and gave it major thumbs up for Neil Marshall making me cheer for Alliser, a character I loathe. He did the same thing to me in Dog Soldiers when I started cheering for Joe, Spoon, Terry, Cooper and Sarge over the werewolf gang.Â  I never cheered for humans over werewolves before that.Â Â 
It boils down to being a matter of opinion.Â  You have yours, so please don't demean those of us who have shared our own as well.Â  


It's not the fact people like this crap. It's the fact they would go so far as to say it's better than the rest of the series. And that frustrates me more than I can say.

3595	The Reader Lisa	2014-06-09	Now that someone's mentioned the RW......it's stupid since there were so many things wrong
with it....but the way they arranged the tables was so bad. Normally there is the table at the
top of the room for the high muckety mucks, guests of honor and such like and then you have
the long table or tables placed perpendicular to the high table. The way they set it up it looked
like they'd come into the lunchroom on a Saturday to take their SATs. Sorry, but that's always
bothered me. And don't say it was a clever way to isolate them so they could be stabbed by
their lab partners (sorry, dinner companion). It was just bad staging.
3596	Envie	2014-06-09	I will say I agree with the review analysis done here on the site at least - the directing and action fight scenes were more fluid and well done than the constant cutting done in the Oberyn / Mountain duel which while fancy looking ended up being rather confusing. The fight scenes in this episode were far more solid overall except for the few nitpicks I've seen (slo-mo between Ygritte and Jon, Jon's face smash on anvil for example).

3599	Chuck88	2014-06-09	Just noticed a small point. I think this was the first ever episode where Ned Stark didn't get referenced directly or indirectly... I think.Â
3600	Bowen	2014-06-09	I only noticed that Maester Aemon is usually written better, and too much Sam. But I guess since they killed off almost every named repeating NW character, and soon there will be no one left but Jon and Edd, maybe they were making the most of who is left.yep this is true about Aemons lines,he's also a superb actor,this episode was way better than the previous ones this season IMO,when they stay closer to the books things look and feel so much better,funny that I wonder why?
Is next weeks episode gonna be two hours long?I sincerely hope so as its goona feel rushed surely to cover Tyrion,Dany,Bran,Stannis,Arya and whatever else.
3601	Chuck88	2014-06-09	As I said, this moment in the books meant little to nothing to me. I'm not peeved because they changed stuff. I'm peeved because it sucked. To put it in layman's terms, most of the shit in this episode was fucking retarded and didn't make a damn bit of sense. It blows my mind people are calling this one of the best episodes ever but then again, should I really be surprised? Look at the biggest blockbusters of our time. Take Godzilla for example: a movie where the writing is pants and one guy does everything, from disarming nukes to participating in halo jumps but FUCK... how about them monster battles?! Am I right?!



You sound like someone who wasn't invited to go along and see Godzilla.Â 
If you're going to badmouth what is undoubtedly one of the most impressive (even if not to your own taste) episodes in the show's history, you would do well to come up with better critical analysis than 'fucking retarded'.Â

Â 


Â 
Overall a horrible episode. Here's the things I didn't like:
Â 
Every bit of dialogue. From the awkward small talk, to the misplaced comic relief, to the underwhelming battle speeches. Nothing said in this episode was impactful in any way. Ygritte's last words about the cave were the only exception to this though the scene was sullied by what was going on around her and Jon. They killed about ten men each just a few moments ago but it's cute that they can still find it in themselves to trade sappy lines right in the middle of the battle.
Â 
The Hollywood-inspired combat sequences. Nothing seemed real. Nearly every extra who died on screen did so immediately after being swung on one single time with a sword and it seemed as if they were all specifically instructed by the choreographer in charge to scream absurdly and exaggerate their body movements during battle. And while all these supposedly seasoned men were dying left and right, Jon Snow was hacking his foes apart without issue save for the big baddy at the end. I'm sorry but when I read the books, Jon Snow did not strike me as a killing machine. It's ridiculous how over powered the main characters in this episode were compared to all the random, nameless watchmen and wildings. If you were facing Ser Alliser, Jon Snow, Tormund, Ygritte, or the Thenn, you didn't stand a chance. Unless of course you were Ser Alliser, Jon Snow, Tormund, Ygritte, or the Thenn.
Â 
The deaths of Grenn and Pyp.Â What a lousy way to send off two supporting characters who have been with us from the start. I know D&D wanted to add some sort of price to be had for the battle and killing off Pyp and Grenn (even though they're both still alive in the books) seemed like an easy route, but why were their deaths so completely lacking in dramatic quality? One is shot through the neck and dies impassively five seconds later staring into space. The other is found dead. It just didn't feel right. If they were going to kill them both off, I would have preferred them to space their deaths out a little more than that. And Sam, who was supposed to be as close a friend as either of them had ever had, displayed no emotion whatsoever concerning their demise. All he responded to emotionally was Gilly and that, to me, makes his character a lot less likable. I might have to blame this on John Bradley's acting ability though, or lack thereof. He's not necessarily bad but he by no means has the chops to be one of the main focuses of an entire episode and keep the viewer interested.
Â 
The cheesy action scenes that didn't make any sense. I like to think most people who have read the books are not entertained by things that look cool over that which is logical and still compelling. Multiple things in this episode were unfortunately put into the episode just because they looked cool. The watchman that was shot with a giant arrow landing perfectly 700 ft below, impaling the ground. The massive scythe flail that miraculously hit every wilding climber in one fell swingÂ (why would the Watch build a weapon of such size and unreliability for one single use at the cost of the Wall's integrity?). Jon's face being smashed into an anvil and coming out of the fight unscathed. The tunnel door still functioning as well as ever despite being severely damaged by two giants and a mammoth... In order to enjoy these things, you must either have no semblance of anÂ idea how they'd work in the real world or issue a willing suspension of disbelief because what you are seeing on screen is just so engaging. For me, nothing on screen was that engaging, so I was left to lament on the ludicrosityÂ of the episode's many impossible scenarios.Â 
Â 
The length and pacing. I never had a problem that they were dedicating a whole 50 uninterrupted minutes to the battle at the Wall. But I suspected, on account of that, I'd see a lot more than I actually did. There were a bunch of useless scenes in this episode between characters I could have done without. None of them were done well from Alliser & Jon to Sam & Aemon. Seemed like dribble compared to the usual stuff the show's writers think up. When it came to the combat, the siege on Castle Black from the south lasted far too long. Before the battle, Ygritte counted twenty men at the gate. When Ser Alliser goes down the lift, it's revealed that there is a force of at least 50 on the ground. Maybe it would have made sense if the watchmen were actually holding the castle but they were just throwing themselves at wildings in the courtyard. I feel like the battle on that side had no progression at all. They shot a few arrows in the beginning but after that, it was just one big melee that went on forever.Â Castle Black had no walls on the southern side in the books but upon watching the episode again, I can see that they gave them one for the show. More time could have been spent on the watchmen holding that wall but it was overran with ease while Alliser was busy giving his speech. Even with a force of 50 warriors on either side, it should have been over in a period of ten minutes or less. No time to send someone up to the top of the Wall and request help, no time for Slynt to come down, and no time to send Grenn down with reinforcements. The lift goes 700 ft up and 700 ft down each time at a rate of 5 mph or less. It seems unlikely that it would be able to make it up and down that many times even given the longitude of the battle. If they had cut it down to the point where the end to this episode happened at the 30 minute mark rather than the 50, the episode could have concluded with Jon being saved by the bell in Mance's tent by Stannis's cavalry (a much better cliffhanger than the one we got).
3604	roxWolfox	2014-06-09	Just noticed a small point. I think this was the first ever episode where Ned Stark didn't get referenced directly or indirectly... I think.Â 


I thought the same thing, until I rewatched and if you look at Jon when's he telling Tormund to stand down, he almost looks like a younger version of Ned Stark ... as least I thought so.Â  It geeked me out to no end.Â
3605	Chuck88	2014-06-09	In response to post before last,
No, not like that. 'Fucking retarded' is probably more valid than whatever that was. Grenn's death not dramatic?
Â 
I know some elements are slightly over-convenient or unrealistic. But for one, it's a fictional show and for the sake of plot, sometimes things have to go down a certain way so why not make them visually engaging? And if you balance out the 'cheesiness' with character moments (which this episode certainly did, whether you enjoyed them or otherwise) then I'm all in favour of a guy getting speared through the air.Â 
Regardless, you're entitled to your opinion and although myself and others might disagree, it's your call to criticise the show's choices. What doesn't make any sense is to get yourself all angry because others did enjoy the episode. And believe it or not it was for more than just the visual effects.Â

Oh there was definitely some subtle character moments. I also found it interesting he used the phrase 'let it end' when Tormund was losing his shit. A throwback to last year's episode 9 perhaps?Â

You are correct. Â Stannis doesn't show up right away. Â Things were changed a bit because Jon's been back long enough to prove that he's not a traitor and everyone's already at Castle Black. Â But no, Stannis isn't supposed to show up until the very.last.minute.

3613	Miodrag	2014-06-09	Yeah I'm going to have to disagree here. It's also baffling because you're pointing out how unrealistic Jon not smashing all his teeth is, but your favorite BB seasons are the ones that have the most fake science, unrealistic events and requires the most suspension of belief?


Â 
I'm neither for nor against unrealistic scenes per se. BB was not very realistic from the very beginning, and had some heavy-handed writing (Skyler working on computer while hand-pleasing Walt in the pilot! It's almost D&D level of unsubtle!), but at least it had a strong themes I could enjoy. Plain crash is somewhat ridiculous in logistics, but, on the other hand, plain accidents do happen (not quite the same as that one, but still), and it was refreshing to see a protagonist responsible for hundreds of innocent lives, and he's the only one who's aware of it. And also, Skyler finally became a character by the end of season two: when she leaves him after he comes out of the hospital, there was some really good dialogue and progression there. Admittedly, suspension of disbelief was needed from time to time, but they made up for it with sharp dialogue, great humor, great acting (Cranston!), and, as I said, themes I generally like. In a way, the plain crash was something I put in a category not unlike dragons, meaning, very little suspension is required: yeah, planes never collide, but even accidents that do happen are caused by human factor, and that human factor was believable enough for me - similar to GRRM's dragons, which don't exist, but had they exist, I imagine they'd be very much like Martin describes them. That recurring shot of pink teddy-bear in the pool annoyed me way more than plain crash, to be honest.
Â 
Now, in season three something went wrong, because Cousins were a joke. I mean, speaking of a filler. Their entire arc was cartoonish, and their death especially. Unarmed man, cop or no cop, just can't kill two hitmen that were built as practically unstoppable up to that point. The overdoing ruined it for me. Like, OK if Hank has to kill them for the sake of story, but don't make the showdown too "dramatic", because it always ends up too absurd and comical. After that, more often than not the plot conveniently went where the show needed it (like Gus killing the only man who's not needed by the plot, even though the poor guy was the only one in that room who didn't fail Gus), and some sub-plots (like that kid Walt poisoned) were really too unbelievable. I watched through the end because of some brilliant developments, like Walt outsmarting Gus in the end (though I really disliked over-the-top half-face Gus), but I really prefer the first two seasons. Have to say that I'm a complete amateur when it comes to chemistry, so if seasons 1 and 2 were more unbelievable than later seasons because of science, I wouldn't know.
Â 
But, not even the weakest BB scenes contain anything as unnecessarily ridiculous as Jon against the anvil. Someone can buy Hank killing two hitmen while unarmed, or Gus killing his own guy just to send a message, but no way anyone can buy anvil the way it was filmed. It's not some big complain, because action scenes are usually peppered with ridiculous stuff a la anvil, but the most annoying thing is that the scene would possibly be very good if not for that detail. Opposite to previous episode's duel, fight between Jon and Tenn looked way better. Even with anvil.
Â 
About GOT's credibility in general, it's a really delicate ground. One of the things I adore about ASOIAF, is that it's full of passionate characters that live and die and kill for what they think is right (or against what they think is wrong). And, because of how passionate they are, they do all kind of stuff. I mean, a son kills his father after finding his own ex-whore in father's bed. That is not something you read about every day. Then, you have a brother and sister making love by their son's fresh corpse. A guy who's too scared to even think of his real name, because he's afraid his tormentor will sense that and torture him some more. A king who uses some much needed help from a particular god, but refuses the will of that god more often than not. And so on. When you have such characters doing all that, you need them to be as grounded in reality as possible. Martin achieved that with meticulous characterization, rooted not only in psychology, but also in culture he created for this world. Since they obviously chose to hit all the main points of the source material, D&D could've follow his characterization, or come up with their own that would have to be equally brilliant. They did neither. And the story is therefore unbelievable too often. I mean, a father fucks his son's ex-whore. How many father would do that? Very, very few. Fathers and sons have issues with each other since time immemorial, but it takes a very special person to do what Tywin did. It's not very believable that there can be two Tywins capable of that. And from what I can tell, TV Tywin is not that kind of person. He was unconvincing as someone who chastises his generals, how is he going to be believable as Shae's new lover/employer is beyond me.
Â 
Compared to what Martin's characters do, Walter White and other Breaking Bad characters and characters of other TV shows are just not on the same level. Not even close. If it works at all, it's because these characters are as realistic as any. D&D failed to do that. I'm not sure why they even try to mess with characterization on which ASOIAF rests, but it's obvious they made a chaotic situation with it. And in such a chaos, a lot of things tend to look unbelievable, even though it didn't in the books.
3614	Kev Morel	2014-06-09	The last two episodes have sucked major donkey balls.Â  I wanted to punch the screen during Jon and Sam's sex talk, and flying suplex the TV when Sam and Gillywere blathering on in the cellar.Â 
Â 
This whole season has pretty much sucked in my opinion, and its a direct result of these asshat writers continuing to let the story devolve from the original into typical Hollywood garbage.
Â 
That fucking giant arrow thing was aÂ totally unnecessary invention in line with what I absolutely hate the most about Hollywood action films.Â 
Â 
Its akin to the raping of the Hobbit/LOTR story by Hollywood, with each film containingÂ 1 hour of decent story and 2 hours of stupid, overly bombastic, completely unbelievable action, hobbits flying through the air in a rain shower of house sized boulders and coming out totally unscathed......aaaaarggg!

Â 
Right. I think this is actually one area D&D actually DID go with the original book plot and now a lot of people are being critical of it? I don't know why other than the build-up anticipation just got to some folks - because I remember thinking in the book "something's gotta happen soon, this is getting desperate" and it dragged on awhile with the suspense of it. I was certain they were going to lose the wall and in the show it certainly does seem pretty lost. I guess they could have done a suspenseful last second action shot of Stannis and army spilling out of their ships or something - but would that really have satisfied the book fans? We are more critical because we already know the story. Show only fans have no idea and thus leaving it hanging without Stannis on the scene is a better choice and puts some time between the first night of attack and when Stannis finally did show up in the book. The best way to show that space of time is with a week's episode break.

And in such a chaos, a lot of things tend to look unbelievable, even though it didn't in the books.

I don't know, I half agree on some of your points. In regards to BB, there I disagree lol the show got better season by season.
But on to GoT. If you see my comments in the "Greatest TV show ever?" thread, I'm pretty adamant about the fact that I don't think that GoT is anywhere near the best series. It's uneven, has cringe worthy dialogue and that.
But...and this is important, I take the show for what it is by itself. In that regard, it's a good show that flashes greatness here and there. And I might be in the minority here but while most people hate the changes, I feel that sticking too close to the source material is what brings this show down (and the laughably bad writing at times). My reason for feeling this is that Martin did create a great world with great characters, but that this need to always have a big reveal, or some action makes it so that much of the dialogue HAS to be exposition and clunky to beat it into the watchers head within the time limit. 
I think that affects the show more than the things that aren't believable, I think we only overlook a lot of the unbelievable things in the book because we can read their thoughts, we can take our time with them, we can understand them as people. On the show the book readers basically hate conversations that don't directly move the plot, because "filler" and they hate when things are done, but not the way they think the book characters did. This is frustrating because not all dialogue has to move the plot. I like when some conversations are just about building character. Look at the great TV shows, they all have conversations that this fandom would consider filler if they'd read a book based on those series beforehand. 
I don't think GoT is an all time great show, but I think it gets unfairly scrutinized by some of the readers who need to understand that it's an adaptation, everything won't be the same, there's constraints when it comes to many things, and we need to take the books and the show as separate entities.
3619	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-09	Forgive me, that was just my attempt to call out your sarcasm - clearly lost on you.Â 


Clearly, since I didn't bother to read anything after that initial statement. I bet you feel really smart.
Â 


I think you should look up the difference between analysis and complaint.Â

The simple fact that I'm still engaging in this tells me that I'm clearly the Â exact opposite of really smart.Â 
You've laid out why it's not to your taste - which is fine even if it seems rather unfounded and unreasonable from my own perspective. Â But then gone on to call people who do like it tasteless as a follow up. So maybe calling it a complaint wasn't the correct term for me to describe it after all. Perhaps rude, pretentious, superiority-complex fuelled rant would have been a better description. Given your obvious disdain for those who disagree with you.Â

Â 
The filler thing is, I think, more about answering the blatant show-apologia here. Ever since the show started, and especially after the first season, every criticism of the show was met with ridiculous accusations of book-purism, which is, as I can tell, something that doesn't really exist, at least here. At the beginning, every complain was "rebutted" with some brilliance a la "they don't have the time to include everything from the books, you stupid". So perhaps it's only natural when people start pointing to all the show scenes that really had no purpose, put there at the expense of some books scenes that, while perhaps not crucial, would add something to the story, at least in terms of world-building. It's not that it's filler, but that it's a bad filler that took place from a much better filler from the books.
Â 
About this being an adaptation, it doesn't have to mean anything, really. For example, the budget is what D&D agree with HBO, and the way they spend it is on them. If the budget doesn't allow better battle scenes, it's really not my fault. This is, among other things, story about a war, and a very brutal one at that, and it's strange that someone's trying to portray the said war without actually depicting it. And what's more, there isn't some insufferable amount of battles in this saga. One major battle per book, plus one or two we're either nearby or often hear about, and that's it. A dying man exchanging philosophical one-liners with Arya can't depict a war. The show needed some of those battles. Not because "they happen in the books" (some of them, truth be told, we're only told about, like the Oxcross battle), but because this is a bloody war that devastates the realm.
Â 
But OK, leave the budget aside. There's a bigger issue here, and I touched it in some of my earlier posts: the show can't cover time and space like books do. Martin manages to put a lot of stuff in each of those chapters: some social and political history, some personal history and background, some thoughts and intimacy... Because of all that, every chapter is like a mini novella about the character. After every chapter, I know about the character way more than I did before, and I have a feeling I spent much time with him/her. The show didn't achieve that. Perhaps it wasn't possible, and I honestly don't know of any show or a movie that managed to cover the time and space the way Martin does in the books. That was the real challenge in this adaptation, and perhaps some changes were needed in that regard (speaking theoretically, because I have no solution of my own). I can't hold against D&D for failing that, but it is a fact that they didn't manage to achieve the same effect Martin did with the characters.
Â 
One possible solution was through dialogue. Like, when Tywin tells to Tyrion that Oberyn was always half-mad. It would've make wonders for the characterization of Oberyn. Much better than his ridiculous brothel fight with Lannister soldiers (yeah, like someone can die of the hand wound!). Or Ned and Robert talking about how Ned found Jaime sitting in the Iron Throne that one time.Â  Or everyone in The North talking about how despicable Theon is for killing Bran and Rickon. And so on. That kind of dialogue helps a lot in many aspects. And yet, there's nothing like that in the show, where D&D always seem to be after some "harsh reality" or some other "wisdom".
Â 
As for the changes we're debating here, most usually they have nothing to do with any necessity. There was no need for Amory Lorch nonsense: D&D chose it. There was no need for abandoning Qhorin/Jon storyline in favor of Ygritte/Jon storyline. They wanted Ygritte to die in episode 9, so they postponed the attack from the south until then - and in the meantime, for NW to have something to do, they invented the ingenious Craster's, which they though could also serve Bran's storyline (in which they face some objective difficulties, truth be told). And I could go on, but you get my point about the changes. If they wanted to change something, I have to ask why did they do it, and what did they achieve with it. And much more often than not, the most likely answer is - they did because they can, and they managed to ruin much of the logic along the way.
3625	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-09	Well at least you seem to acknowledge your inability to handle the idea of others having different views than yourself. Props for that.Â 


No, I think you're right. I've said why I don't like it and I'll leave it at that. No need to go on about it more than I already have.Â
3626	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-09	Is it a direct adaptation of those comics or is it just taking place in the same verse with some of the same characters? (comic book adaptations are prone to that.)Â 
Doesnt GRRM write one episode each season? *scratches head*



1.) The Walking Dead is just in the same verse with the same characters, although many of the plot twists and qutoes and whatnot are taken straight from the comics. The Walking Dead and Dexter(another series based off a comic book series) have something which Game of Thrones don't though: Both The Walking Dead and Dexter were painfully mediocre and painfully cheesy(and often downright horrible) comic book stories, whereas A Song of Ice and Fire is genuinely amazing. It's why when most people bitch about how horrible The Walking Dead or Dexter are, they don't cite the source material, because the source material was just as bad most of the time. Whereas with Game of Thrones, naturally we cite the vastly superior source material. I mean, why wouldn't we?
2.) He does write one episode a season, but that means he's only writing that one episode. And D&D and whoever's directing, and even the actors, are allowed creative changes. I think I read something about how the vast majority of the Blackwater episode was changed, how nearly all the dialogue was altered in some way, etc. and how he doesn't even understand why he's credited with writing the episode.
3627	Young Nan	2014-06-09	My nitpicks:
Stannis NOT showing up at the end. Wtf?
Ser Alister Thorne giving 3 separate "inspirational" speeches plus a private "we hate each other but lets be coos just for this battle" talk with Jon
Ygritte cutting off Tormund's bear story.  We do too care about whether he "focked" a bear. 
Sam having way too many scenes
Not having any followup whatsoever into the events in Kings Landing.  Even an unsullied I know was upset about it.
Ygritte getting killed by that kid.

Um wrong, The Walking Dead comic book series is brilliant.Â  The show is awful.Â  And I don't care that the show is different from the comics, it's just a shame that the show isn't good.Â  Or at least it wasn't when I stopped watching it during season 3 (which I recommend to the Game of Thrones haters - if you don't like it, stop watching it and save yourself the mental anguish).

I'm pretty sure calling someone a twat and then telling him he wished he'd died is not being "coo."
3630	teemo	2014-06-09	TwD is really not all that bad. Â Watch the episode "Clear" in season 3, it's really good. Â It's not in the league of the greatest shows, but at least it's more ambitious than GoT. Â I feel like D&D just don't give a shit at all about their writing. Â And Breaking Bad isn't even close to overrated. Â It's one of the few shows that only progressively getsÂ betterÂ as time goes on. Â Every season somehow outdid the one before it. Â I wasn't a fan of the finale, but overall the show is brilliant and definitely in the league of the Sopanos or the Wire. Â The Sopranos is my all-time favorite love though <3

It is when it's immediately followed by "but we have to work together for now".  Way to totally miss my point LOL. Obviously, they have to put aside their differences for the duration of the battle.  It didn't seem necessary to break that down Barney-style for the audience.
3632	Young Nan	2014-06-09	Pyp's death affected me a lot more than Ygritte's, which surprised me. Pyp's death was beautifully done, made me cry, while Ygritte's death was underwhelming and emotionally slight. I'm not sure who's to blame for this, but I'm inclined to lay it at Kit's feet. Â Although he gave a surprisingly good performance throughout the episode, in that moment he fell short. I just didn't feel his pain. He just looked constipated to me.Â 

So true!  I am not too concerned about his death from a storyline perspective, since his only future role was to be shipped away, but I found his death really sad and emotional, while Ygritte's was just flat.

D&D have a knack for skipping all of the best one-liners in the books.  Too many missed opportunities to count, from "I only save maidens" to "The wall is yours, Jon Snow".  I doubt we'd get the line about turnips, even if he were alive. They seem to think they can paraphrase and/or improve upon them, but it always is a fail.  It's such a pity because they have pre-written gold that they never use. (Totally agree with you re: that line alone is better than all of D&D's lines combined)

It was actually a wrist wound, and yeah, you can die from that. Â You have about 5 minutes to treat a severed radial artery. Â Which Oberyn obviously knew.

3646	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-10	Breaking Bad season 2 spoilers in this entire post.
	Spoiler They address multiple times in season 2 that the way to stop someone from choking to death is to turn them onto their side. Jane tells Jesse this, and that's why they lay on their sides. But Walt prooves he ALSO knows this by earlier in the seasons telling someone(I think Marie, I forget) to ALWAYS leave the baby on their side otherwise they might choke.
The correct thing for Walt to do would be to put her on her side ASAP, then call 911 use napkins/tissues/something to try and clean her mouth out with her on her side, then if she was to wake up/gain some small control of her body - make her take small tiny sips(as opposed to gulps) of water while waiting for ambulances to arrive.
Sure you could make the argument that Walt panicked and didn't know what to do, but based off his original movements to help her before stopping, and how oddly collected he was - I don't think this was the case.
In fact, legally speaking(in the USA anyway), what Walt did with Jane is technically considered murder.

Â 
The guys climbing the Wall. It took a whole day for Tormund's group to do that, from morning till the evening, and when they reached the top, they were too exhausted to fight. Even if the battle took long enough for them to reach the top - which it did not - they would have been just pushed down the moment they peeked over the edge, so what is the point?

3650	of man and wolf	2014-06-10	Why all this chitter chatter over second rate shows like the walking dead, dexter, and breaking bad? Every single time I tune into twd, it's some people walking and walking, and then sometimes trying to escape a zombie attack. And they're all terribly slow and dumb and can be handled with relative ease.
Â 
True genius lies in the brain of one Larry David. Seinfeld and Curb would be proof of such.
Â 
As for GoT, yeah, it has it's missteps, but it's really rather awesome most of the time.
3651	SlowLoras	2014-06-10	I actually liked this episode a lot. My few nitpicks:
Â 
- I'm not going to throw Stannis's non-arrival in. I love Stannis. I am a gigantic Team Dragonstone fangirl. And it would'veÂ been crazy badass to end on STANNIS, STANNIS, STANNIS. But I'm not overly troubled that it didn't happe in this episode. It was about the Wall, and the people on it, and I think D&D have been seriously amiss in leaving the Wall out of the main storyline for such a long time because a lot of non book readers don't quite understand just how important the Wall storyline is (and will be). When I read the books I loved the Wall and Jon's storyline so it was satisfying, for me, to see it get the attention it deserved.
Â 
That said, I sincerely hope Stannis gets a decent look-in next episode. I'll be really pissed if they throw five minutes in for his triumphant ride to the rescue. Dude deserves more.
Â 
Actual nitpicks:
Â 
- Sad about their portrayal of Tormund. I feel like it would have added a lot more to Ygritte's death and the overall dynamic between Jon & the Wildlings to have that scene between them in the books where they drink to Ygritte. Mind you, the Jon/Ygritte stuff was so rushed and glossed over last season, and the gap between their parting & the battle so wide that I'd imagine a lot of Unsullied didn't care much. Which is sad, because imo their relationship in the books is sweet and sad.
Â 
As it was, the death scene was pretty good.Â But with all of that behind it, it could have been even more poignant.
Â 
- "The Wall is yours, Jon Snow". SUCH an oversight not to have that line. It symbolises the moment Jon goes from Ned Stark's Bastard to potential Lord Commander.
Â 
- I understand the CGI limitations but I'd have loved to see a little more Ghost.

Â 
you're doing it wrong. When you're defending the show you like (Breaking Bad), you have to insult us who criticize it, not talk about the actual show.
Â 
Seriously now. About BB, a lot of people were disappointed by the finale, but thematically I think it was perfectly in accord with the first two season, in which Walt was depicted as a brilliant man who was pushed into very dark corners of his nature, but not a genuine villain. That's what I liked the most about the show, the theme of those who are left behind by the society even though at first sight they don't look like they're left behind. Like, it's dangerous for the entire society if brilliant people like Walt are mocked and humiliated on daily basis (and the plane crash really brought the point home). Just, people shouldn't be punished for not being ambitious to the point of greed, and Walt was the ideal embodiment of that type: he is truly brilliant, and at the same time he was also truly ordinary. He wasn't obsessed with his own brilliance, and, sadly, in today's culture this modesty (for lack of a better word) looks like a fatal flaw. And after diagnosed with cancer, he lost it. He decided to finally use his potentials, but in the very wrong way (not that he could use it any other way at that point, it seems). And once he tried, he liked it. He liked it too much. And everybody was worse off because of it. IMHO, that was the whole point of first two seasons, ended with the plane crash. (In that aspect, Walt's not too unlike Tony Soprano. Tony never had the chance to be an ordinary fellow, but in essence he is one. He was not diagnosed with cancer, he was just born into a wrong family, and definitely to a wrong mother.) Now, when BB left that theme and tried to make Walt an outright villain, I think something was lost. But, on the other hand, the finale therefore didn't disappoint me, as it did to great many other viewers and critics, because I never bought Walt as an outright villain, and, apparently, Gilligan didn't attempt to make him one, but he did portray Walt as one ever since season 3.
Â 
All that sad, I liked a lot about Breaking Bad, but I don't think it's in the league of The Wire and The Sopranos, even though it's usually rated in there. And that's what I meant by overrated. But of course, not nearly as overrated as the most overrated show in the history. Perhaps you've heard of that show. It looks like those who don't find it brilliant have to come up with a "Nitpick without repercussion" thread every week, just so they can exchange their complains in peace.

3655	Miodrag	2014-06-10	It was actually a wrist wound, and yeah, you can die from that. Â You have about 5 minutes to treat a severed radial artery. Â Which Oberyn obviously knew.


Â 
Once you said it, it does make sense, I suppose. Still, they filmed it as if it's a matter of seconds. Five minutes window gives one enough time to, say, finish the fight. And I guess it's not that hard to treat a wrist wound, even if its potentially very dangerous to left it untreated. So my dislike about the scene remains in essence, though your correction seems spot on.

tbh i think the writing on twd is quite a bit better than GoT...

This is just... Jesus... I don't know what to say. 
You've seen the Walking Dead right? I actually cheered when SPOILER Andrea died. That's how bad it is. 
It is a stupid show genuinely aimed at the lowest common denominator. Zomg zombieeeeees. 
GOT aims higher than that. 
It's not perfect, but it's still great. 
It's biggest problem is that it has introduced a load of people who otherwise wouldn't like fantasy, into the genre and the rage is there for all to see. 
This is ours!!! They cry
Not yours. No. Ours!!!!
But it's not anymore... It's been released I to the wild and is thriving. 
The way people look down on show watchers as mouth breathing idiots is a massive indicator of this. 
It's all very "you can't possibly enjoy this on as many levels as I do" Dr Fink/Simpsons if you ask me, which you didn't. 
My only nitpicks are a lack of Stannis... But it's not his episode and it's not his time yet. 
Stannis comes later, to the tears of millions of readers. 
I truly hope D&D release an interview after the show is finished and say "yeah we made this show just to fuck the fans off" it would be hilarious.

Even stronger indication is the way GoT is defended on these forums all the time. Show apologists don't even attempt to prove we're wrong and our complains are not valid. On the contrary, they're not dealing with complains, because they're always dealing with complainers: "Stop watching the show if you hate it"; "Separate the show from the books"; "Everybody but you loves the show"; and other usual gems.
3658	ladyinblack	2014-06-10	Everyone is mentioning that they are disappointed Stannis did not show up. Maybe I remember thing wrong from the book and they are leaving a chunk out of the show but doesnt jon defend the wall with donal being in command? And then alister and janos come back from east watch after this battle and throw jon in ice cells? Then they decide to send jon out to kill mance under the ploy of making a deal? And thats when stannis attacks when jon is out there in mance's tent?
Yes

lol it's so easy to hate on twd because it's about zombies, but there is definitely some good writing in there, and at least the show is ambitious. Â Season 3's 'Clear' was really good. Â Sorry, i'm a critic, so I talk about this kind of stuff a lot :X
3661	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	TwD is really not all that bad. Â Watch the episode "Clear" in season 3, it's really good. Â It's not in the league of the greatest shows, but at least it's more ambitious than GoT. Â I feel like D&D just don't give a shit at all about their writing. Â And Breaking Bad isn't even close to overrated. Â It's one of the few shows that only progressively getsÂ betterÂ as time goes on. Â Every season somehow outdid the one before it. Â I wasn't a fan of the finale, but overall the show is brilliant and definitely in the league of the Sopanos or the Wire. Â The Sopranos is my all-time favorite love though <3

Not so meaningless in your case, it seems. I don't remember a single complain you proved illegitimate, unfounded, illogical, undeserved... You're not even addressing complains. All you do is repeat people shouldn't be criticizing GoT because you find it awesome.
Â 
For example, what did you think about the anvil thing? Like, if it was up to you, would you leave that little shot just like that, or you'd tell the director to change it?
3668	Miodrag	2014-06-10	And, for the record, I'm not sure TV Gilly is less annoying than any other among loads of annoying characters in TV and film. Her lines are horrible, she's acted horribly, and she's constantly given screen time even though she obviously has no purpose at all at this point. Compared to her and Sam, Missandei and Grey Worm look almost Shakespearean.
Â 
By the way, after Missandei/Grey Worm and Sam/Gilly, what impossible romance we're going to have next week, since it looks like that became the standard for D&D?
3669	sj4iy	2014-06-10	D&D have a knack for skipping all of the best one-liners in the books.  Too many missed opportunities to count, from "I only save maidens" to "The wall is yours, Jon Snow".  I doubt we'd get the line about turnips, even if he were alive. They seem to think they can paraphrase and/or improve upon them, but it always is a fail.  It's such a pity because they have pre-written gold that they never use. (Totally agree with you re: that line alone is better than all of D&D's lines combined)

I think we'll still hear "The Wall is yours, Jon Snow."  It wasn't as if someone was there to tell Jon...I liked that he just took charge, anyway,

Â 
A few judgements such as leaving Ghost locked up until late, though all minor really. I liked this episode, even the stuff they changed. Pyp and Grenn were heartbreaking, but it worked for the vision of the show.
Â 
The horn inconsistency also annoyed me a bit. Two quick blasts this time, repeated again and again. S02E10 1....2.....3 really slowly and this meant three blasts instead of repetition of one blast. Minor nitpicks only though.

Ok, LOL, I rewatched the episode this morning with the anvil smack in mind.Â  At first, I thought the blood spit later from Jon wasÂ because of the anvil hit, but I don't think so.......the anvil did look to hit him or be hit by him....in the forehead.Â  The blood spittle, minus his perfect teeth (MY POOR OBERYN), came from actual punches to the mouth, I think.Â  Still, I agree, I shouldn't have to rewatch to look for the sense of the matter.
Â 
All in all, I do think Kit is amazing with his swordplay, eh.......maybe the hair helps, LOL
Â 
Also, I did notice this time that Edd and company actually mentioned the scythe before they dropped it and did have it hauled back up,Â but honestly, I didn't notice that in the first watch.Â  Probably cause theÂ background noise is always much louder than the voices and dialogue.Â

I had no problem with the anvil scene and genuinely don't understand why people are kicking off over it. 
He was injured from the blow. It's hardly a fight ending move. 
And to be fair, it really dazed Jon and almost lead to his death, which is what would happen. It would not instantly kill him. 
Fair enough, his nose wasn't broke but I don't think many actors would break their noses for that. 
Also, GOT is not with out it's faults, but I just don't take joy in nitpicking the thing to death on the internet. I enjoy it for what it is. 
Is it awesome? Sometimes.
Also, how can I prove things? It's all just opinions. I have mine, I sit and watch the show with my mates, enjoy it for what it is. You sit at home, and I don't know but from your posts I imagine you sit with white knuckles, grinding your teeth Stannis style whilst watching D&D butcher the sacred text by shockingly making it look good on TV.

3674	The Red Melli	2014-06-10	I'm not saying he's not bad. I'm just saying that he's not that bad.

	Spoiler Jane would have died anyway, Mike was a murderer and a criminal, and Uncle Jack and Todd were the ones who made Jesse into a meth slave. IIRC correctly Walt personally kills only criminals. Sure he did things like bomb a nursing home, poison a kid and by a butterfly effect caused an airplane to crash, but in the first two no innocents died and as I said the third was caused by a butterfly effect.



Walt was absolutely disgusting at the desert scene in Ozy.
Â 

	Spoiler 'You know Jesse, I just told Jack where you were hiding and agreed to let them torture you first but lemme tell you something funny ... I watched Jane die, I totally could've saved her but I didn't just for the heck of it.'

Â 
After this scene I totally started rooting against Walt, from the awful manipulation attempts on both Skylar, Jesse and even his own son and everything else that happened on Walt's behalf it's pretty clear that he's one sadistic monster.

3676	Tadco26	2014-06-10	It's a nitpicking thread, so obviously some of the nitpicks are going to be trivial.Â  Specific to the anvil to the face for Jon, the problem is setting the tone of realistic consequences to violence.Â  Alot of the scenes and deathsÂ serve the purpose ofÂ making danger feelÂ very real.Â  Oberyn gets a smashed in skull, Ned doesn't find a way to escape his execution,Â theÂ Starks are slaughtered at the Red Wedding,Â ect.Â  It's counter-productive to that feeling of anyone can die at any timeÂ to then have typical TV/movie action scenes where the "minion" characters die in one swing of the blade, but the main characters can slam their face into an anvil and fight on as if it didn't even happen.Â
3677	Jojosh	2014-06-10	Ghost not going with Jon to meet Mance in the end. They are just making him a silly trained pet, as opposed to a loyal, understanding, supernatural, wise companion and sometimes a leader.
Â 
The guys climbing the Wall. It took a whole day for Tormund's group to do that, from morning till the evening, and when they reached the top, they were too exhausted to fight. Even if the battle took long enough for them to reach the top - which it did not - they would have been just pushed down the moment they peeked over the edge, so what is the point?


Ghost is Jon's pet thoughÂ

Well I meant it more as in it's a group thing for me. A Monday night ritual that I enjoy with a few mates.
3681	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-10	It is when it's immediately followed by "but we have to work together for now". Way to totally miss my point LOL. Obviously, they have to put aside their differences for the duration of the battle. It didn't seem necessary to break that down Barney-style for the audience.


Â 
They didn't break it down barney style, and I didn't miss your point. There's no friendliness or even camaraderie between them in that scene as you insinuated. Thorne basically says alright, you were right about one thing, but I'm not going to listen to everything that comes out of your twat mouth. Also I wish you died. When I need to leave the top of the wall I'm going to put an unseasoned, unskilled man in charge instead of a (relatively) veteran NW man, a notable fighter and someone groomed for command by his Warden of the North father and also the previous Lord Commander himself because my hatred for you will still lead me to make bad decisions with regard to defending the NW.Â 
Â 
The exchange was really almost perfect, and I understand this is the "Without repercussion" thread but sometimes I wonder if a number of people really pay attention to what they're watching before attempting to nit-pick. There are nitpicks and there are nitpicks. Nowhere in that exchange did Thorne insinuate that "Hey we hate each other but let's just fight alongside for once!" In fact he does the opposite, to be honest. He's giving Jon commands and telling him to do his duty but still won't honor him or give him any respect.
3682	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	I do wonder why the NW didn't drop more oil and stuff on the giant opening the gate. Maybe they couldn't see that far vertically down the wall?

3684	Buckwheat	2014-06-10	Ghost is Jon's pet thoughÂ

Nope, I am pretty sure they could establish a closer relationship between them if they tried. For example by having Ghost be with Jon more time and do stuff, have Jon touch him more often, see his reaction to other people ... but they decided not to.
3685	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-10	I would prefer if Tornund was more like he is in the books as well but he's not 
He was getting close as well there with his bear fucking story.
3686	Tadco26	2014-06-10	I do wonder why the NW didn't drop more oil and stuff on the giant opening the gate. Maybe they couldn't see that far vertically down the wall?


That was a complaint the non-reader viewers had as well, even before the giant started opening the gate.Â  It the giant hooking the mammoth up to the gate with the chains without anyone attacking was just odd, and they were all asking me why aren't they shooting at it or doing anything?Â  They eventually did catch the mammoth on fire, but it was odd not to have arrows flying around them when they were the only obvious threat to the wall at the time.

I agree that a few things are clarified on re-watch, and since I grabbed hubby's hand when Pyp died, and didn't let go until Jon shot Tormund in the leg, my husband truly appreciated seeing it again minus the fingernails imbedded into his palm.Â  
Â 
What strikes me as curious is the love book-readers have for Mr. Martin's obvious nods to other works in his writing, yet don't allow the same for the showrunners. (Man's gotta have a code, e.g.)
Watching the 'anvil scene' my first thought (and hubby's, too) was The Raid.Â  We once decided to do shots to The Raid after every concussion inducing punch, slam, etc.Â  We gave up simply for the fact that we were ridiculously drunk before the last battle came up - and that's when the face/head thumping really gets into full swing.
On my second watch, I thought of Rocket Richard.Â  That little guy got thumped and tossed around by guys way bigger than him (back when helmets were sneered at), yet he always got up, bloody as hell, and skated around them all.Â  Concussed?Â  Certainly.Â  Badassedly heroic?Â  Undeniably.
Â 
As for the blanket labels attached to anyone who likes watching the show ... I'm getting a little steamed by being called an apologist and stupid simply because I enjoy GoT.Â  It reminds me of the time I took a few days off work only to be called in to attend a staff meeting due to money disappearing when I was on holiday.Â  The owners reamed out everyone of us for being thieves (or being in on it) ... and I wasn't around at the time of the thievery!Â  Arggh!Â Â  So, prove to me that I make excuses for the show (in any post I've made), and I'll accept the label. I can't help but think of the AA saying:Â  when one finger points out, three point back.
We are all fans of the story here.Â  Book or show, we are fans of the same story.Â 
Â 
The hammer made me burst into laughter, simply because that's the second time in the last few weeks I've watched someone get a hammer to the head (Fargo, to be specific).Â  My hammers are now currently behind lock and key ...Â

It is not that big of a deal but it is a part of a larger trend within the show: The more important characters killing crazy amount of extras, Jon getting his face hit by the anvil, the giant's arrow hitting the guy, Ramsay dealing death shirtless and so on are just a continuation of Stannis fighting without a helmet and similar things. I just think that it cheapens the show when you mix these elements with the grittiness and a certain kind of realism. Overall this is a minor aspect at least for me. The real crime of the show is the atrocious show-only writing and the plot lines that you know (as a reader) will go nowhere. Sure, it is a hit and miss but lately it feels just miss and even if its a hit then it is the wrong note.

3689	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Most irritating thing for me was that by my approximate death count and the ludicrously small starting garrison of 102 (Mormont really shouldn't have taken all his men on the raid, and I'm hoping the other 2 towers do exist), the watch should be down to pretty much just named characters by now
3690	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-10	I agree that a few things are clarified on re-watch, and since I grabbed hubby's hand when Pyp died, and didn't let go until Jon shot Tormund in the leg, my husband truly appreciated seeing it again minus the fingernails imbedded into his palm.Â  
Â 
What strikes me as curious is the love book-readers have for Mr. Martin's obvious nods to other works in his writing, yet don't allow the same for the showrunners. (Man's gotta have a code, e.g.)
Watching the 'anvil scene' my first thought (and hubby's, too) was The Raid.Â  We once decided to do shots to The Raid after every concussion inducing punch, slam, etc.Â  We gave up simply for the fact that we were ridiculously drunk before the last battle came up - and that's when the face/head thumping really gets into full swing.
On my second watch, I thought of Rocket Richard.Â  That little guy got thumped and tossed around by guys way bigger than him (back when helmets were sneered at), yet he always got up, bloody as hell, and skated around them all.Â  Concussed?Â  Certainly.Â  Badassedly heroic?Â  Undeniably.
Â 
As for the blanket labels attached to anyone who likes watching the show ... I'm getting a little steamed by being called an apologist and stupid simply because I enjoy GoT.Â  It reminds me of the time I took a few days off work only to be called in to attend a staff meeting due to money disappearing when I was on holiday.Â  The owners reamed out everyone of us for being thieves (or being in on it) ... and I wasn't around at the time of the thievery!Â  Arggh!Â Â  So, prove to me that I make excuses for the show (in any post I've made), and I'll accept the label. I can't help but think of the AA saying:Â  when one finger points out, three point back.
We are all fans of the story here.Â  Book or show, we are fans of the same story.Â 
Â 
The hammer made me burst into laughing, simply because that's the second time in the last few weeks I've watched someone get a hammer to the head (Fargo, to be specific).Â  My hammers are now currently behind lock and key ...Â  


Â 
I thoroughly enjoyed your post and picturing you and the hubs smashed outta your heads (concussed humor) more and more as the episode and battles continued.Â  I didn't get too upset at Pyp, he just wasn't Pyp, ya know?Â  It's still the Grenn who is killing me.
Â 
I hope you don't think I'm one of those who goes around accusing people of one extreme or the other, I try not (I didn't think you were, just wanted to make sure that nothing I posted came out the wrong way) to be that way.Â  I do get enjoyment out of the show, and frustration, and try and remember that it is.......only works of fiction, LOLÂ  I try, LOLÂ 
Â 
I'm LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLIng at all the Hammering, too.Â  For some reason, last week my nitpicking on too much beetle time and too much filler time lead me to hear Hammertime and lead a poster to kindly erase that from my mind with a little Sledgehammering by Peter Gabriel.
Â 
I should post that again just for the fun of it.Â

Â 
I agree that they diminish the "anyone can die" feeling when some people can eat anvil, or fight with no armor, or have TV-only original scenes where they are put in danger, butÂ saved in typical dramaticÂ tv show fashion by luck or unlikely events, and anyone who isn't a named characterÂ is going to die the first time these main character's swing their weapon at them.Â  As a TV show this can still be entertaining, but it does diminish the feeling that violence has consequence and that even the most skilled protaganist is not supposed to be aÂ typical fantasy heroes who is capable of defeating dozens of foes at a time.
Â 
I love Lord of the Rings and Legolas and Gimli keeping score of their kills at Helms Deep was bad ass, but even though it's bad ass and can be entertaining, it doesn't fit with the tone the books set in Game of Thrones.

I am totally waiting for someone to do us a body count for members of the NW being as I am too lazy to do it.Â  All the extras that were killed and the Edd count are not adding up.Â  I can't believe I haven't found an actual nitpicking body count for this yet, then again.....I haven't looked for it myself.Â  I'll just lazily sit here and wait for it to show up.Â

Someone said they did it and counted 49, that seems too high to me, but I'm much too lazy to try it myself, I can/t remember which thread it was on, either the spoiler one or the ratings one, and it was from Sunday night I think.

Nah, I did a rough count and 40+ is right, and that's only NW dying on screen, realistically could be well over 100 given the way the battle unfolded and Ygritte's shooting
3696	Tadco26	2014-06-10	Well there were only a hundred total, so it couldn't have been well over that
3697	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Why was Jon standing around the whole time until he went down to defend CB?

His job and greatest asset, given his upbringing and stewardship of Mormont, is as a leader not a fighter, and even Thorne knew that.
3698	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-10	Well there were only a hundred total, so it couldn't have been well over that 

I reckon they went over 100 extras for the NW. 102 was way too low an official figure
3699	Tadco26	2014-06-10	If so then it makes giving that incredibly low official number even sillier.
3700	Miodrag	2014-06-10	I had no problem with the anvil scene and genuinely don't understand why people are kicking off over it.
He was injured from the blow. It's hardly a fight ending move.
And to be fair, it really dazed Jon and almost lead to his death, which is what would happen. It would not instantly kill him.
Fair enough, his nose wasn't broke but I don't think many actors would break their noses for that.


Â 
It was a strong blow. It was filmed as a strong, severe blow. His head bounces of the anvil. It has to leave serious consequences. In real life, anyone would be pretty much unconscious after a blow like that.
Â 


Also, how can I prove things? It's all just opinions. I have mine, I sit and watch the show with my mates, enjoy it for what it is. You sit at home, and I don't know but from your posts I imagine you sit with white knuckles, grinding your teeth Stannis style whilst watching D&D butcher the sacred text by shockingly making it look good on TV.


Â 
You somehow manage to be both polite and rude in the same sentence, which is quite an accomplishment. But, what you did here is perfect apologia. You're not discussing the show, you're discussing me watching the show. Which is, sorry to say, completely ridiculous, not the least because, once again, you've got everything wrong. Of course I don't watch the show like that. And D&D aren't butchering any "sacred text". ASOIAF is for me a great literature, not a sacred text, but anyway, D&D thankfully have no authority over the text, so it really isn't butchered by them. And no, I'm not shocked by how good it looks on TV. I'm actually disappointed by both how bad the shows looks on TV, and how unlike its source material it is.
Â 
What I could agree with, is that this is better than to have a bad show that is very similar to the books. And it's not like D&D couldn't do that. Seeing how competent a writers they are, I'm pretty sure they'd make a disappointing show even if they wanted to stay closer to the books. Thankfully, it's not the case, since the show is at this point so different than the source material it's really not the same story any more. It is a fan-fiction basically, only we can't call it that because GRRM agreed to sell the rights to HBO.
Â 
About proving things, that's what opinions are meant for: to be agreed on or disapproved. Impressions are impossible for discussions, but opinions are debated, proved right, disapproved or whatever all the time. If we're complaining without a proper reason, it would be easy to prove.

3701	Red Tiger	2014-06-10	I really don't see why this episode is getting such ridiculously high ratings. Most people who died were horribly developed, Ygritte had long ago overstayed her welcome, Sam I can feel for but Gilly is simply annoying as fuck and D&D keep shoving her into my face. Don't get me wrong it was a good episode, but great?
Â 
At Blackwater the characters were better developed at that point, plus I had no idea who to root for. Stannis and Davos or Tyrion? Now it was pretty obvious who had to go.

As for you wondering if I thought your posts were demeaning towards show-watchers? Nah, not that I recall offhand.Â  I've find your posts to be more thoughtful than derisive.Â  
Â 
I do understand the frustration. I stated in another post that my fave book of all time is The Stand.Â  I was geeked when I heard that they were making a mini-series of it, until I watched it. Then I was outraged!Â  With no internet to vent my rage on, I had to let it simmer/boil for 20 years.Â  But now, knowing that they are making The Stand into a three hour movie, my rage finally has meaning and purpose.Â  I will go watch the movie, and lambast it endlessly.Â  It's gonna be messy.Â  
Or not.Â  Depends on how I feel that week.
I simply cannot figure out why so many people make themselves miserable watching the show.Â  I absolutely detested what they did to Phoenix/Dark Phoenix (my fave comic book character) in the Xmen trilogy, so I don't watch Xmen anymore unless hubby bribes me to do so. Same with the new Star Trek movies.Â  The only enjoyment I get is watching hubs blow a gasket.Â Â  Â  I'm mean like that. But, I still need a bribe.Â  I have my standards.Â
3704	Matthew Marzolf	2014-06-10	Â 
Totally agree - anyone who can get shot by three arrows and recover in about a day probably wouldn't bruise if you anviled him.


Â 
Anvils never did much to Wile E Coyote either. I think their damage potential is overrated.
Â 
My nitpicks revolved mainly on the corner they painted themselves into with Thorne & Slynt being there, and the attacks from thread happening simultaneously with the attack from the front. Have they even mentioned The Shadow Tower or Eastwatch by the Sea or the Bridge of Skulls, where Thorne was during this attack in the books? Manipulating the commanders of those garrisons is how Sam gets Jon elected LC.Who is going to vote?
Â 
Then I don't know what's worse - Mance's decision to light The Haunted Forest on fire while he's still in it, or the fact the NW didn't notice anyone was there until the flames covered the horizon. I guess that's why they didn't notice the campfire to the south? Fortunately for them, the Wildlings screamed during their charge to let them know they were coming.
Â 
Someone else noticed that the gate mechanism still worked well enough for the giant to life despite getting yanked all out of whack by a mammoth and giants. Speaking of which, what's with the giant sized tunnel? Was it that big at the end of Season 1 - I know it was bigger than in the books, but it seemed to grow. In the book, the giant had to crawl in.
Â 
Just silly things. The first 15 minutes was bad. I've reached the point where I cringe when they have obvious not from the book small-talk scenes.

Yeah, I don't see a 10. Â I thought the action shots were good, and Kit was good, and the special effects were good. Â But, that doesn't add up to a 10. Â This episode showed what happens when you neglect a major plot line and then attempt to rectify that in 1 episode. Â

But I guess my friend was trying to say "Giant's Bane", and this was also a letdown.

It's hard to say.

Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww, this reminds me of my ex, LOLÂ  You have fun demeaning the Hell out of only 3 hours for The Stand, or not, either or.Â  Â  
Â 
I do understand what you mean about watching something that doesn't seem to bring a person any joy.Â  Sometimes it's hard to give up hope, so I'm sure that's why some watch.Â  There is also the issue of the internet bringing out all kinds.Â  I have a hard time giving up things I really love, a show or such, but will when I realize it's only making me miserable.Â  Quite honestly, modern entertainment notions have lead me to not see much in the way of new TV or movies as I've found so much of it to be a disappointment.Â  I haven't even bothered to try the new Star Trek yet, maybe we should blame Star Wars and George Lucas for that?Â 
Â 
I have that mean streak, too.Â  It's fun to watch some gasket blowing, both here and in RL.Â  The internet does bring all kinds of crazy and it's like rubber necking a train wreck, probably wrong but sometimes I just can't help it.Â  Besides, it's just typing soooooooo..........that's okay to laugh at, right?Â 
Â 
I've almost lost this post twice, so I'm just going with it here.Â  The minute watching or posting about this show and the books makes me myself miserable, I'm outta here.Â  I always take breaks anyway, maybe that helps me FEEL like I'm one of the sane and reasonable ones?Â  LOL Â  Â Â Â That and I do still get enjoyment out of the show.Â  Hell, I enjoy the nitpicking, too......variety does make the world go round.Â
3710	Miodrag	2014-06-10	Yeah, the absence of Mance is much more problematic than the delay of Stannis. Like, the way D&D handle Stannis, they're probably going to ruin his arrival to The Wall, regardless of the episode which they put it in. On the other hand, this is the episode in which Mance simply had to be brought back in the story. Without him, wildlings that are attacking The Wall from the north are just a bunch of nobodies, they're an entity with no identity whatsoever. Not that Mance was properly established so far, but at least he could be a vaguely familiar face - which is particularly important, given how they decided to end the episode.

Â 
Just a guess, but I'm wondering if the Giant Slayer your friend meant was Grenn and the other NW men with him.Â  The fact that D&D felt the need to kill Grenn and Pyp (or whoever he was as he wasn't really Pyp) shows that even they must realize how piss poor a job they've done at fleshing out most anyone in the extreme North.Â  I'm not surprised many don't realize the name of Jon and Sam's friend who took on the giant in Donal Noye's place.Â  How hard would it have been to put in a few more named characters, Noye included, up at the Wall during all of these past seasons?Â

I haven't understood this all season, really. Â I've been expecting at least a couple of short segments with Mance and his army to remind the audience of the actual problem the NW is facing....and they never came.

This.
Oh boy, I love Ciaran and his work, but I really think his cast for Mance was a big mistake the show made. Ciaran gave us a heavier, denser Mance. There is no fun with him, he is an old leader who won the wildlings attention through his force of character and skills of leadership, not a young bard who conquered wildlings hearts and trust with songs and charisma. I supposed Ciaran COULD give us a younger and happier Mance, but I doubt someone told him how the original Mance is ou should be.Â 
I hope we'll meet Mance's family on next episode, it would not only make him more likeable (he was on what? 3 episodes in the whole series, always like some kind of villain) but it also is necessary for the future of the character. If we do not have the women who make Mance what he is, then we'll have a sinister and stern Mance lurking in the dreadfort and hiding in the shadows instead of the gallant and beautiful Abel winning the eyes of everyone in the castle. Thats BS.

That is not the actors fault. Completely the fault of the writers who wrote a character that hardly even resembles the Mance from the books personality wise. No doubt in my mind Ciaran could have pulled off lute playing Mance

Also Jon was punched in the stomach when fighting Styr. His mouth was smashed of the anvil because blood sprays everywhere and straight after he spits blood at Styr. Jon should be eating Hobb's turnip soup for the rest of his life.

3718	Miodrag	2014-06-10	I haven't understood this all season, really. Â I've been expecting at least a couple of short segments with Mance and his army to remind the audience of the actual problem the NW is facing....and they never came.


Â 
That seems to be D&D's way of handling things from very early on. Between his imprisonment and his execution, Ned received how much screen time? A scene, maybe a scene and a half. It was way too little for the protagonist who's about to be killed. My guess is, if it wasn't for Sean Bean, at that point the audience wouldn't even know Ned is the protagonist of the first season. They did the same with Cat and Robb: reintroduced them to the story just in time for Red Wedding, without any build-up. Even their favorite character Tyrion got the same treatment last episode: he reappeared just minutes before the duel (and even worse, those minutes were used for beetles). All in all, I'd say the only way D&D know to shock the audience, is to make people forget on the character and then bring the character back in the story.
Â 
Mance is a somewhat strange case, because it's not like he's not talked about throughout the episode, so there's no big surprise waiting for the audience about him. I guess D&D just don't think they should change what they think works.

Â 
I think he was somewhat miscast, but the writing and direction are the biggest culprits here. Â They wrote Â him as grim. Â And I doubt he has read the books..good grief...why would he bother given his few minutes of screen time over two seasons. Â
3720	Saturno	2014-06-10	Â 
Just a guess, but I'm wondering if the Giant Slayer your friend meant was Grenn and the other NW men with him.Â  The fact that D&D felt the need to kill Grenn and Pyp (or whoever he was as he wasn't really Pyp) shows that even they must realize how piss poor a job they've done at fleshing out most anyone in the extreme North.Â  I'm not surprised many don't realize the name of Jon and Sam's friend who took on the giant in Donal Noye's place.Â  How hard would it have been to put in a few more named characters, Noye included, up at the Wall during all of these past seasons?Â 



It's possible, this friend is obviously a Unsullied and for him is hard to follow so much names. I cant judge him, because even reading the books I frequently was lost when a second or third-rate character was mentioned (the third book, with all the Freys, oh god). But I agree about the ridiculous abscence of noticeable characters in the North.
I mean, c'mon, they had the Cook in the kitchen owning arses and also the guy with the scorpion/trebuchet/etc killing a Giant, it's not like the diretor wants all the action for the main characterers only. But I guess it is better to have no Noye at all than some rushed Noye created just to die in the tunnel. I think the character was so important to Jon's identity that his end at the tunnel was just a noble way to say goodbye and not the apex of his performance.

Â 
I made the same type of complaint about the lack of Mance in my OG Nitpick post in the first pages of the thread.Â  I honestly even thought we'd see him out there in the forest a bit on this episode, yelling commands or something.Â  He was needed for this episode and the fact of no Mance, no where, no time all season is more than a nitpick.Â  But JEEZ, he was needed out there in the forest, not just his damn fire.Â 
Â 
Oh, LOL, I'd be easier to credit that fire blazing up all at once if we'd actually SEEN Mance and wildings pouring tons of.....whatever the fook they used for a type of fuel to start the fire..........all throughout the woods and then........Mance lighting a torch for a big FLAMING WHOOSH!!!!!!Â  Insert eye roll here at D&D for them not doing something like that.Â  Forget about where wildings would get oil and all, but Seven Hells, just do it.Â  That wouldn't be quite as stupid as just the fire magicked into place.Â  INCENDIO???????????????
3722	Sand11751	2014-06-10	My nitpick has to do with the portrayal of the wildlings as merciless killers with every attack this season, particularly in the nonsensical way Ygritte acted, and how the wildlings will play into Jon's arc.
Â 
With Ygritte, whom I never liked anyway, she was on some hell hath no fury trip. Suddenly she stopped acting like a Terminatrix because of Gilly and her baby? Makes absolutely no sense why she spared anyone if she attacked others with no such reserve. I guess D&D did it to show she had some some heart left, but it would have made more sense with her behavior that Jon Snow would be her lone Achilles heel. All she did for two-three eps she was in was talk about how she going to kill Jon Snow, almost guaranteeing that she would never kill Jon snow.
Â 
If a future season plays out like the books, I would seriously have to wonder why Jon would allow people who were so vicious beyond the Wall. It almost calls into question his common sense. On the show, I wanted all the wildlings dead as much as I really wanted all Thenns dead. In the books, my feelings were more ambiguous.

I have really no gripes with the first season.
Â 
I can intellectually understand why they cut Robb and Cat, because knowing they're going to get killed, they wanted to switch the audience identification to other longer lived characters. Â That doesn't excuse the rest of the botching of that storyline....but the more limited time they gave it, I can see for TV that it made sense.
Â 
Mance as far as we know is still alive after the end of the last book. Â So, him being invisible is odd, especially odd since the Wall story becomes more front and center in the last book.

I'm with you on both counts.Â  I don't judge show only viewers for not always getting the names, especially names of more minor characters.Â  Honestly, it took me a reread to keep all the details straight about the very overpopulated world of ASOIAF, LOLÂ  I do understand why they picked Grenn for the tunnel scene, and the vow recital was terrific.Â  I think Grenn's death bothers me so much because he was the most fleshed out of the younger NW characters.Â  The actor was terrific all the way through the series, and I did kind of like the tag team of him and Edd, too.Â  I liked the way the show did the two of them together.Â

It's another example of the show going for the shock factor and sacrificing logic, that they will worry about later. Â
3727	Saturno	2014-06-10	A little nitpick of mine is about Jon's "rise to power". In the books (please, correct me if I'm wrong) Noye look in Jon's eyes and say "the Wall is yours", clearing saying to us that he trusts in Jon's leadership and command. This means a "high-ranking" NW member (ok, Noye was not a high-ranked... but he was a veteran of the NW and very respected, he in many ways represented the NW itself, if not its values, as Yoren did too) trusted Jon.
Â 
Ok.
But we dont have something like that on the show. Jon Snow was not even a third option. He only got control of the wall because his friend tricked the man who was supposed to command. There is no logic whatsoever for, at the end of the battle, Jon walking through Black Castle shouting orders and planning the next step and saying take Tormund to here and there. I mean, I understand that, in absence of a commander, someone step in and everyone who is around in the Wall, awaiting orders, temporarily follows his command, but down there? At the meele and after? Alliser is obviously alive, and so is Janos Slynt. Why on earth is everyone following Jon's orders?
Or it is because they interpreted Jon's arrival as the turning tide who made them win this impossible victory?

Yeah, a lot of people still love the first season, and it really is way better than the later ones, but even then one could sense D&D's incompetence. People were generally pleased because the adaptation was much more faithful, and ASOIAF finally hit the mainstream, so some blunders were overlooked, but in hindsight, there's a lot to complain about the first season. One of my biggest complains is about the futile Pycelle/Ros scene in the finale. It goes on forever, and it serves absolutely nothing. On the other hand, the discussion between the northern lords in the same episode lasts for no more than 30 seconds! From the beginning of the scene, to the moment when Greatjon stands and addresses the crowd, only half a minute passes. In the book, it was a memorable discussion that tells us a lot about the political system of Westeros - it would've been infinitely more informative than Pycelle mumbling about kings he served while naked Ros parades around his chambers (not to mention that his sexual appetite was shown just three episodes later, so it really wasn't needed in the season finale).
Â 
Or what about Cat interrogating Jaime. He tells her it really was he who pushed Bran out of the window - but she leaves without the explanation why. She asks him why he tried to kill her son, and he tells her: "Go to sleep, it's going to be a long war", and she heeds his advice! What kind of a mother would leave it at that?! Cat from the books certainly wouldn't.
Â 
And that's just the finale. Of course, compared to later season, season one was way better, but even in it one can find all the indications of D&D's incompetence. It wasn't as blatant because the plot was less complex, but the tendency was there.

3730	Saturno	2014-06-10	I think it would be better if Alliser, even hating Jon, choose him over Janos, in a sign of pragmatism. Then we could have a infuriating Janos instead of a cowardly and cartoonish one, and he would have even more reason to hate Jon.Â 
I mean, we all know that Jon will kill Janos, right? But you guys can see this happening with THIS Janos? I fear Jon's justice will look much more like Jon simply cleaning up the wall of cowards, and this is not something I see a Stark doing... maybe a Bolton.

Â 
I do basically agree about the first bolded statement.Â  It taught me two things, one being that yes.........whores do clean up between jobs...or some of them do........and two, it really was in hindsight a clue about what would and wouldn't get more time going forward.Â  I'm still not over loosing The GreatJon (or of them recasting the role, as I think the RW suffered because of the lack of bannermen that we knew).Â  I have to say that I am now wondering if the scenes and their timing played a role in the actor not returning?Â 
Â 
As for the second bolded portion, I highly suspect that the show wanted to use the teaser of Jaime and Cat scenes in captivity for renewal purposes perhaps?Â  I think they wanted to show fans and those in power at HBO the promise of things to come?Â  Done perfectly?Â  No.Â  In hindsight, did they mess up lots of that segment of the story?Â  Yes.Â  I do suspect though that it was about providing a hook for the coming season, hoping that it would be something Unsullied would want to see.Â  I found the cell chats with Cat and Jaime to be surprisingly intriguing, and I suspect D&D wanted to give a taste of that intrigue to those without a clue about it.Â 
Â 
These are both good examples of the good and the bad methods that D&D use to whet the audiences appetites for more.........story, in Jaime and Cat's case, and well........boobs in the other.Â

I would say that his rise to power in the show makes more sense in the books, actually. Â Noye giving Jon command of the Wall when he was injured, 17, and still thought to be a traitor and deserter by many of the men around him made absolutely NO sense to me in the books and really seemed shoehorned in by Martin to give Jon an excuse to lead. Â Here, there's literally no one left to lead and Jon takes command because everyone expects him to, due to the fact that he's proven himself a capable leader throughout the season and there are no longer any questions about his loyalty to the NW. Â He's also older and has helped train the men, has led a successful ranging to kill the mutineers, and was the voice of reason on more than one occasion about what the NW should be doing to prepare for the Wildling attack. Â By making it Jon's decision to send his good friend Grenn to his death to protect the tunnel, and then making it his decision to sacrifice himself as a last ditch effort to kill Mance and break the Wildling army, they have made him look more heroic and perfectly capable of making the tough decisions a leader must make...and when it comes time for the NW to choose a new leader, Jon will be the obvious choice, unlike in the books.
Â 
In the books, I had to shut down my brain and accept that Jon was elected over men who were older, much more qualified and had no questions about their loyalty. Â Yes, Sam helped to rig it somewhat, but it wasn't a popular vote...it was a majority vote, which meant that most of the men had to vote that way...something I thought was ludicrous, but I shut my brain off somewhat and accepted it because it was obvious that Martin need Jon's role to change.
Â 
Basically, I think D+D did a better job by extending the length of time between Jon's return and the attack, as well as expanding Jon's role in the Night's Watch as someone who the men looked up to.
Â 
I will say, however, that they should have evacuated Molestown because having them slaughtered when the NW was obviously there and could have warned them didn't make any sense to me. Â But hey, nothing's perfect.

Nah, the Ice River cannibals are very real and presumably their cannibalism is well known to be a fact at least among the wildlings. There is the myth of Gendel's children stuck in underground caves but that's a different matter.

These are my thoughts on the supposed cannibal rumors about the Skagosi.Â  I'm thinking they are based on tall tales from long ago about some particular incident or incidents, and if anything, I think the Skagosi will be oh so civilized and contribute greatly to Rickon's personality when next we see him.Â  Everyone seems to expect that he will be WildRick but I suspect the opposite.Â  Him being raised and sheltered by a Wilding, an Angry Direwolf, and Skagosi Cannibals will all be aÂ cover for him returning different than most expect.Â  Well, at least I hope so as I am in love with the idea.Â

But my point is that Show!Jon, even being older, being successfull in his hunt of mutineers, even training everyone... he still did not took the wall by merit. He stole it's command with Grenn's help. And while I can see why the other brothers up in the wall followed his command (they after all changed looks with one another, so clearly they were balancing their options), there is no reason at all for his brothers down there doing the same, specially after the battle.
About the election, well. I wasn't talking about the election, maybe I expressed myself poorly, english is not my first language. I'm talking about this episode, his role as commander in the wall only.

Â 
But who was there to tell him to command? Â Slynt completely lost it and ran off without giving any orders (Grenn only gave him an excuse), and Thorne was seriously injured and couldn't give commands. Â Also, Jon didn't steal it from Slynt, he was trying to convince Slynt to give orders when Grenn came up with the idea to lie to Slynt about Thorne needing him. Â The chain of command was broken and they had no time to sort it out. Â A real leader doesn't hem and haw trying to find 'oh no, who do we ask now?'...he just takes command. Â Everyone looked at Jon when Slynt left and he knew what needed to be done. Â No one needed to tell Jon that the Wall was his...he knew it was, and so did the men (which made him more badass, imo). Â And when Sam came up for help, Jon delegated the Wall to Edd and led the men in an attack on the ground. Â He killed Styr and subdued Tormund, and no one questioned Jon's authority when he told the men to take Tormund and put him in chains. Â Basically, when everything is in chaos, a real leader will rise up and take control of it...and that's what Jon did. Â And he was successful.

Even if not everybody got a major moment in their character arc, that episode intentionally gave everyone a touchstone moment or scene. â<U+0080><U+009C>Watchersâ<U+0080><U+009D> struggles with the fact that the only two characters on the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch anybody gives a damn about are Jon and Sam, and the former is probably the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s leastÂ UnterpiestingÂ major character, a stereotypical fantasy hero whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s somehow wound up in this series and stayed alive this long.
Â 
This is a big moment in Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arc. He loses Ygritte, and he essentially becomes the only person who can take command of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch in a moment when all hope seems lost. But not only does the show give this moment far too little weight; it also finds itself stretching the story out past this episode, so that this hour depicts only the first night of the Battle oCastle Black. Without spoiling how the other nights go or how the battle resolves itself, I can say that this is so ridiculously unimportant to not just the overall arc of this particular storyline but also the arc of the full battle itself that blowing it up to â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwaterâ<U+0080><U+009D> proportions is just kind of pointless. The episode ends on a cliffhanger that only makes things seem more like we saw an episode entirely designed to show off how impressive the seriesâ<U+0080><U+0099> budget is.

3744	ellstaysia	2014-06-10	long time reader, first time poster here.
I have a couple complaints & praise to share. first of all, the diologue in this show is getting embarassing & laughable. jon & sam's conversation about sex was really silly, long winded & took up too much screen time. sometimes this show manages it's time very poorly (like with last weeks beetle scene, wtf!?).
yrgitte's little speech before the wildlings marched up to castle black was a nice moment where we see for a moment that, yeah, the wildlings are people too, not all senseless monsters going about for no reason. I loved the wildings in the novels, but the show always makes them look so weirdly one dimensional. I felt like yrgitte's screentime was wasted by her repeating over & over about how she's going to kill jon snow but I get this was thrown in so show watchers get reminded of why she's important.
that being said, the visuals were astounding along with the epic doomy music! I loved watching this episode with the giants & mammoths looking grim & badass together. very cool.
I need to rewatch it again, but my first impression was "stop talking everyone because you all are embarassing & totally cheesy" but like I said, the actual battle visuals were really satisying to me.
I loved ygritte & jon's relationship in the novels (they're both two of my favourite characters) but this ending for them seemed a little weak. didn't even cry even though I did during the read.
ah well.
3745	Ice_and_Fire	2014-06-10	This is a really petty nitpick I fear but...
Â 
As much as it made the visual of the battle better, I just cannot make peace with them all using flaming arrows against each other.Â 
Brilliant way to;
1. Give away your position to the enemy so they know where to aim their arrows to take out opposing archers.
2. Give away the position of the arrow as it flies towards its' intended target allowing them a chance to dodge (as we saw Ygritte do).
Â 
I was under the impression that flaming arrows are specifically for white walkers, or if you want to set something on fire at distance. Seemed silly to me.Â Even my unsullied boyfriend questioned why they were all using flaming arrows saying it didn't make sense.

Well sure you could argue it's just a myth, but unlike the Skaagosi the Ice River Clans are very minor. So there's no reason to confuse the story by lying about such an inconsequential detail.Â

Welcome to the boards!Â  
Though I didn't care for the Jon/Ygritte stuff (book or show), I'll admit that I had tears in my eyes when when Jon pressed his forehead against hers during my re-watch.Â  
Â 
eta: As for the music, I chuckled.Â  Dog Soldiers is one of my all time favourite movies (Neil Marshall!) and the theme starts off with heavy drumming very similar to the theme played at the end of this episode.Â  My inner geek almost exploded.Â  xD

3750	Bori	2014-06-10	Episode 8 we find out that there are 103 men of the night's watch including people like Aemon. How many were killed? I'm waiting for some dedicated person to actually make a count of how many died.

Well, I was so pissed off, that I did.
Â 
The butcher's bill so far:
Â 
41 members of the Night's Watch died or went down on screen + Grenn + Pyp. So, 59 left to defend...Â 
Â 
versus
Â 
36 widlings died on screen from Mance's army (including the climbers) + 2 giants; 26 wildlings died on screen from Tormund's raiders + Ygritte + Styr. So, 99936 left to attack...
Â 
My little nitpick: "I need him more than I need you." What? and the look on Sam's face. As if he is about to loose the Great Other on the world...
Â 
And why Jon leave him behind when going to kill Mance? And how does he plan to accomplish that without a sword?

3754	Pod The Impaler	2014-06-10	I was under the impression that flaming arrows are specifically for white walkers, or if you want to set something on fire at distance. Seemed silly to me.Â Even my unsullied boyfriend questioned why they were all using flaming arrows saying it didn't make sense.


Â 
Â 
Possible reason: Find range for your next bunchy of arrows, maybe set some shit on fire.
Â 
Actual reason: Flaming arrows help a night combat scene be filmed better and look better.
3755	Amber W	2014-06-10	Just watch the episode and my main complaint is that some of the 'tactics' were just laughable. Why on earth did they let that giant get in without shooting arrows or aiming rocks/oil/pitch/whatever at him? How on earth did they think they were successfully going to keep a giant from getting through a gate with a sword? Why weren't there any arrows or spears involved? Why is it that the only command anyone seems capable of giving is 'nock, draw, loose'? Seriously, I think they know how to shoot by now. They weren't firing nearly enough though, and kept letting everyone get way too close. And what's up with those flaming arrows? It looked good visually, but what was the point?
Â 
Seriously, I think I'd make a better battle commander than half the people in this show 
Â 
Another think I didn't like was Sam and his storyline. Why did they have to push the romance with Gilly, with Sam almost rubbing it in Pyp's face, and why did everyone act like having a girl's the only reason you'd want to live? And why was he being such an ass to Pyp, without doing shit himself? And why was he barking at Olly, forcing him to pick up a weapon - he is a child, not a man of the Night's Watch, that's what you are supposed to be, Sam. Get him to go fetch Jon or let Ghost loose and do some work yourself, geez.
Â 
And finally, why did Ghost just start eating people? I'd hoped for at least a few nice direwolf kills. And did everyone else think the fight constantly looked like it was going very badly for the Night's Watch, only to have it turn around way too suddenly? And what's with all that useless filler dialogue these past few episodes?
Â 
That being said (and I do apologise for the rant ), there were a few things I did like. The scythe, Dolorous Edd, Alliser Thorne, Jon's fight with Styr (even though he almost lost, again??), Tormund etc. were all really well done. And all the major deaths really gutted me; I cried a grant total of three times, which even by my standards is ridiculous. Pyp took me completely by surprise, and while I got a nasty feeling when Grenn was sent to defend the gate, I hoped against hope he was going to live. Props to them both, and to Rose Leslie of course, who absolutely nailed it.

That I don't agree. If the wildings reach inside, and he's without weapon, he's not safe. With a sword, or anything, he has more chances to even escape or help someone, which indeed happened.

Â 
- I was pretty psyched when they swung that ridiculous anchor, because for a moment I thought they were just going to crack Â  Â the wall and drop ice on them, which would have made perfect sense ("the wall defends itself")
- Still cannot get over the lack of Donal Noye
- There was totally time for stannis to be a mannis all over the wildlings
- Is it really that hard to cgi a massive army in the background?Â 
- Tormund is a bit disappointing, but so are all the wildlings in general

I know! You could forge dozens of weapons (or hundreds of arrowheads) from that amount of steel.

Why not just wait until the climbers are almost to the top, and then poke them with spears? They'll be exhausted from the climb, easy targets.

Sure, they could have used conventional means and weapons to knock the climbers off the Wall, but no one would have said "holy shit that's awesome!" when they did.In a more logical sense, it's something that would only need two men to use against a large number of climbers.

If only it was that simple. For example, remember how they translated Cat? Or what about Robb? And let's not forget good, old Baratheon brothers, Stannis and Renly. In fact, it's a pretty stiff competition for the worst translated character.

I had the same impression. Jon descends to the courtyard, kicks some ass, cries over Ygritte and they win... Although it isn't really shown, one could guess that secret weapon Ghost killed the rest.
Â 

And what's with all that useless filler dialogue these past few episodes?

Absurd waste of time, considering all the original mythology that is left out.

It wasn't as if the show had much to go on, because he's not extroverted, he's not overly-emotional and he doesn't talk much. Also, him being a peon in a militaristic organization doesn't give much of a chance for any of that stuff. But I agree that KH had done the best he can with what he has, and I think he's going to really shine next year as LC.

Not only that but why would the Watch build a weapon of such size and unreliability for one single use at the cost of the Wall's integrity? And for what? To kill five or six climbers who would have been slaughtered the moment they made it to the top, if they made it to the top?

3784	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-10	lol @ suggesting Jon is the most ruined character by D&D.
Jaime and Tyrion have a bone to pick with y'all.


Â 
Stannis and Asha say hi
3785	Mark Antony	2014-06-10	Catelyn was by far the most ruined character imo
3786	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-10	Catelyn was by far the most ruined character imo


Â 
I disagree. She was given far too little screentime and basically disappeared from the show in season 3, but at least you could tell she was Catelyn. Same with Jaime, he's had a few lapses (mainly killing his cousin and raping Cersei) but overall you can tell he's Jaime.
Â 
But in all honesty I can't say Asha made her way to the show. That sullen, uninspiring character is no Asha. It's a good thing they named her Yara, because she's a whole different person.
Â 
And in the same category I'd put Mance and Tormund, because other than the names they have next to zero traits from the book versions
Â 
Then come Stannis and Tyrion.Â

3787	Rattleskirt	2014-06-10	Also The AV Club's "Game of Thrones (Newbies)" just gave this episode an A- and the "Game of Thrones (Experts)" just gave this episode a B+.
What the flying fuck. The Newbies review, maybe I get that, but the Experts(aka bookreader) review too? What the hell.
Edit to add: Although one of my unsullied friends also posted "Yay Ingrid's finally dead." Lol @ three seasons of a character, and people still don't know their name.

Nitpick? 
Pyp and Grenn but at least G got to go out like a Fucking Bossanova!
Making Alliser so damn likeable for an hour so we can hate him come season 5. I dunno maybe it'll just be "hate."
-Also, I'm quoting this person because their screen name is awesome.
3788	Saturno	2014-06-10	Someone said that Sam was being a real douche with Pyp and the orphan boy, and I agree. I think the idea was to give some comic relief to the episode, but it kinda resulted in an arrogant and cynic Sam who only cares for Jon and Gilly.

The idea of the scythe is actually really cool, if it weren't for the fact they used it on literally five troops. If they had used CGI to make it appear like there's HUNDREDS on the wall, then yes the scythe would've been badass as fuck.
Edit to add: I think Stannis, Arya and Sansa all win a threeway tie for most butchered character. Which is depressing, considering all three actors have proven to be amazing.

3793	eumaies	2014-06-11	Well, I was so pissed off, that I did.
Â 
The butcher's bill so far:
Â 
41 members of the Night's Watch died or went down on screen + Grenn + Pyp. So, 59 left to defend...Â 
Â 
versus
Â 
36 widlings died on screen from Mance's army (including the climbers) + 2 giants; 26 wildlings died on screen from Tormund's raiders + Ygritte + Styr. So, 99936 left to attack...
Â 
My little nitpick: "I need him more than I need you." What? and the look on Sam's face. As if he is about to loose the Great Other on the world...
Â 
And why Jon leave him behind when going to kill Mance? And how does he plan to accomplish that without a sword?


Â 
Thank you for counting that.
Â 
The best part of it is that they are going to pretend their are still nights watch members left to, you know, have an election and vote for Jon snow.Â  I hate it when shows fail to capture the depth of a world.Â  It's the most important piece.Â  It's what made the original star wars so great, but it seems noone cares about depth any more.Â  Great CGI, plenty of gore, nice costumes, no depth.
Â 
Anyway, back to my original point.Â  Since D&D clearly are too frightened by complexity to mention the other nights watch people in the shadow tower, etc, not sure where the whole electing a new commander thing is supposed to make any sense at all. Who the hell cares about 60 nights watchmen?Â  And why did they have to say there were just 100 left to begin with? The battle could've made perfect sense if there were 500.Â  Just stupid.
Â
3794	Young Nan	2014-06-11	Â 
They didn't break it down barney style, and I didn't miss your point. There's no friendliness or even camaraderie between them in that scene as you insinuated. Thorne basically says alright, you were right about one thing, but I'm not going to listen to everything that comes out of your twat mouth. Also I wish you died. When I need to leave the top of the wall I'm going to put an unseasoned, unskilled man in charge instead of a (relatively) veteran NW man, a notable fighter and someone groomed for command by his Warden of the North father and also the previous Lord Commander himself because my hatred for you will still lead me to make bad decisions with regard to defending the NW.Â 
Â 
The exchange was really almost perfect, and I understand this is the "Without repercussion" thread but sometimes I wonder if a number of people really pay attention to what they're watching before attempting to nit-pick. There are nitpicks and there are nitpicks. Nowhere in that exchange did Thorne insinuate that "Hey we hate each other but let's just fight alongside for once!" In fact he does the opposite, to be honest. He's giving Jon commands and telling him to do his duty but still won't honor him or give him any respect.

I think you are reading way too deeply into my nitpick, and yes, I thought my nitpick through before posting it. You are missing my point (not sure what the big deal is with it?).  My main point was that we got too many inspiring battle speeches from Ser Thorne, plus a "lets work together grudgingly" speech to Jon.   I'm not sure where I said that they became BFF's for the duration fight, so I am not sure where you are getting that from. To me that scene came across as a token "enemies temporarily working together" scene, which I always find to be unnecessary.  One speech from Alister would have done the job, but the dude got way too much screen time, it seemed disproportionate to the importance (or lack thereof) of his character.  He and Sam Tarly seemed to be the stars of this episode.  And since this was supposed to be a character-building event for Jon, not a fleshing-out event for minor characters, I think it's a valid nitpick.
3795	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-11	The 43 dead watchmen also depends on Ygritte's missing all her shots!
As for main characters slaughtering extras, when it's Thorne, Jon or Tormund I actually think that's pretty realistic. Armour, real experience and training all huge assets and knights would kill loads of normal soldiers in these battles
3796	Young Nan	2014-06-11	Waiting for next week?
We know we'll see it next week, but I know for me personally, I'd have liked to see Stannis the Mannis this episode, rather than the 20+ min of filler with Sam, Gilly, Alister, etc.  From a pacing standpoint, next episode is going to be awfully crowded and disjointed because they still need to wrap up events in Kings Landing, the Eyrie, and with Arya as well.  I think we'll see a lot of rushing, jumping from scene to scene, and viewers missing major plot points in the shuffle.   I know that in the books Stannis didn't come until Jon treated with Mance, but it seemed like a logical place for this episode to end.  It had a shorter runtime than usual so I was surprised to see the episode end without Jon walking out to meet Mance, then Stannis bringing the awesome.

Nah, Littlefinger and Stannis are worse IMO
3798	eumaies	2014-06-11	Just in general, folks seem to be expecting Lady Stoneheart...
Â 
but they're not going to show her getting ressurected, because it's been WAY too long for her body to not have decomposed.Â  And they're not just going to drop us in on the robin hood and led by undead Cat?Â  So I suspect they drop it.
Â 
Also, I figure they do something really annoying and dumb like Brienne finds the Hound, kills him, but Arya runs away.Â

Personally, I don't know why people are worried about the pacing of the next episode when they don't even know for sure everything that's in it yet. People assuming they knew what this episode contained is the reason why so many people are upset about Stannis not being in it in the first place. Next week's episode is 66 minutes long...easily enough time to show Jon and Mance, then Stannis' grand entrance.

Â 
My problem with the scene is that Jon & co. watch the giant and mammoth approach the gate and the giant affix the grapple-hook thingy to the door and do absolutely nothing for a few minutes. Â They should have been firing everything they could at the giant, the mammoth and the ropes connecting both to the grapple-hook thingie before it was connected. Â Finally, Jon gets around to ordering the barrels; but it's too late by then unless they get incredibly lucky, which they don't.
3808	Russo	2014-06-11	Budget aside, they could have kept the anvil smash as long as Jon is basically knocked out by it. Then he gets saved by Ghost. It would show that in the scheme of things Jon is still basically a boy, and defeating a seasoned warrior twice his size is still beyond him. It would also sho how important and powerful Ghost actually is, and how important he is to Jon. Opportunity missed, but I'm not losing any sleep over it.

The TV show people are always missing opportunities to show how important the direwolves are to any Stark besides Bran; and it bothers me. Â Arya never dreams of Nymeria; Shaggydog is basically Rickon's big scary-looking pet when he appears (which isn't often). Â Did Ghost show up more than once or twice last season? Â I can't remember. Â And the middle of a battle in which Jon's life is in constant danger, Ghost just takes out one Wildling and then disappears? Â Makes no sense, especially since they've done a good job with Dany's dragons.
Â 
I thought that Jon hit the anvil with his forehead; which could explain why he still has all his teeth. Â It doesn't explain why he wasn't even momentarily dizzy, much less knocked unconscious.
3812	Fat Trell	2014-06-11	The problem with this episode, as with every episode this season, is that the show is unwilling to do its own thing.
Â 
The showrunners repeatedly change, alter, or removeÂ relatively smallÂ details from the story; but they refuse to allow these changes to have a logical effect on the plot.
Â 
Thus when you step back and look at the actions of the characters, they all seem downright idiotic. Why was the castle so lightly held when everyone knew the Wildling's plan to strike from both sides? Why has the Watch seemingly done absolutely nothing to prepare for an attack they've known about for weeks at least?
Â 
And then you just have good, old fashioned, ill thought outÂ scenes. Lets let those mammoths and giants toy with our gates for a little. Lets put the weakest, most unreliable person we have at our disposal in charge of the only way to travel from the Wall to the castle. Lets make camp literally 100 yards away from our enemy, who we are trying to sneak up on. Also lets build a fire and post no sentries or even pay attention to our camp's perimeter.
Â 
We should really sit down with Mance and discuss how he was able to ignite a forest fire well over a mile in diameter in a frozen wasteland.
Â 
Really see no reason why the parlay with Mance/arrival of Stannis couldn't have been done this episode. I mean if we absolutely need to spend about 45 minutes a season on Sam and Gilly, two strikingly uninteresting characters, why not spread that out a little? Why did we need to jam 5-8 minutes of already covered topics(Sam likes Gilly, Gilly likes Sam, the Wildlings murder people) into this already packed episode? And we definitely needed another rehash of Jon and Sam awkwardly discussing sex. We always need more of that.

Yeah. The inconsistency of their characters in particular is one of the most annoying flaws of the show. Jaime is the most bizarre example of this, since he regularly shifts between "cousin murdering for no reason psychopath-rapist" and the misunderstood antihero from the books between different scenes. But there are tons of others.Â
3814	SerArthurHeath	2014-06-11	That's a problem with multiple writers, frankly
3815	Miodrag	2014-06-11	To be honest, even Jon Snow in the first two books was a damn boring character. It wasn't as if the show had much to go on, because he's not extroverted, he's not overly-emotional and he doesn't talk much. Also, him being a peon in a militaristic organization doesn't give much of a chance for any of that stuff. But I agree that KH had done the best he can with what he has, and I think he's going to really shine next year as LC.


Â 
Just a quick check: you say Jon was a damn boring character in the first two books. Which indicates his arc in those two books was also boring for you. I mean, why not, if the protagonist of that arc you find boring? Then there's the third book, in which, as far as I can remember your posts, you think Mance's plan is illogical and nonsensical - which would indicate the entire Jon's ASOS arc, that is built around Mance's attack, is also somewhat nonsensical to you. And then you say that is your favorite storyline in the entire ASOIAF.
Â 
The way I see it, all adds up to one conclusion: you really don't like the books. Right? I mean, if your favorite storyline is something you have so many complaints about, what does it say of other storylines? So I really see no other conclusion. Don't get me wrong, you're absolutely entitled to dislike the books and criticize them on fan sites. In fact, it'd be refreshing to see a show-lover actually admitting that he/she doesn't really like the source material. It'd be much more honest than usual "I love the books very much but I find so many of its plotlines illogical and so many characters are either unrealistic or boring and yeah the show is so much better" bollocks. So I'm genuinely curious: if you dislike the books, why don't you say so? Why go telling that you love them, when it appears you probably don't?
3816	The Mountain That Posts	2014-06-11	That's a problem with multiple writers, frankly



Lost had over twenty writers, including in-betweeners.
And yet Lost's characters NEVER fell out of character. Sure, Lost the show got horrible at the end, but the characters themselves stayed true to themselves(for the first four or so seasons at least).
Game of Thrones is basically ENTIRELY written by D&D. Two people. They have no excuse.Â  They're just fucking hacks.
3817	Bori	2014-06-11	When you watch the episode on 50% of speed, then everyone sounds retarded and for me as viewer everything they do starts to make sense

Probably, I didn't feel the mechanics of their attack really worked. The gate is lifted upwards to let people through and they try to pull it out? That seems like a rather stupid way to get past such a gate.Â

Â 
Yeah. The inconsistency of their characters in particular is one of the most annoying flaws of the show. Jaime is the most bizarre example of this, since he regularly shifts between "cousin murdering for no reason psychopath-rapist" and the misunderstood antihero from the books between different scenes. But there are tons of others.Â 


Â 
And the total lack of acknowledgement between these wildly personalities set forth by the same people is vexing as well. Tyrion goes from the incredibly angry, bitterÂ man we see at the end of his trial to a jovially depressed guy in an episode. Jaime, like you say, goes from a rapist to a man seeking justice in the same amount of time. No one, least of all themselves, takes note of these huge swings in personality.

I also had something like this in mind. Much more realistic, less Hollywood cliche.
3830	Mulled Wino	2014-06-11	Nah, Littlefinger and Stannis are worse IMO


Â 
Â 
Jon has been belittled and degraded at every turn. Â While I agree that LF batman voice is a problem and Sansa embarrassing him in front of the Vale lords is bad, what they've done to Jon is that X 50.
Â 
Stannis is really bad, agreed, but he just hasn't had the sheer amount of airtime and disrespect that Jon has had. Â

3833	zaphodbrx	2014-06-11	I don't know why people keep harping on that anvil thing. Theon got hit by a morning star and just got a little winded. And Ramsey showed up to the fight naked. Main characters have plot armor, get over it.
Â 
Actually the Jon/ Thenn boss fight was one of the highlights of the episode for me. It was much better than the one last episode, because no one was drunk or practising for the ballet. They did have the no helmets rule strictly enforced but this doesn't really bother me much these days.
3834	Natasi	2014-06-11	Who handles the editing for the episodes? We lay a lot of blame on directing and writing but it seems to me that the major problem is with the way the episodes are spliced together. It's glaring in the fact that these last few haven't even made it to the proper time length. Scenes are being cut too short or the weakest takes are being chosen and the way they are pasted together is often jarring and incoherent.
3835	RedShirt47	2014-06-11	I'm not particularly a Stannis fan but I was really hoping to see him charge in and save the day.
Â 
I don't get this Jon walking out to parle with Mance. Why would they let him back and not either kill him or take him hostage at this stage of fighting?
3836	Miodrag	2014-06-11	Jon has been belittled and degraded at every turn. Â While I agree that LF batman voice is a problem and Sansa embarrassing him in front of the Vale lords is bad, what they've done to Jon is that X 50.

Â 
Know what, quite a challenge you posted, it seems. And you certainly have a very strong case, because TV Jon really is a joke of epic proportions (the only epic thing about him). However, in regards to efficiency in misinterpreting a character, I think the award goes to Mel. Like, in the books she's nothing if not intimidating. Every now and then we're reminded everyone's scared of her. Even though she is attractive, she frightens the living hell out of everyone. In the show - is anyone frightened by her?! Is she able to pull anything without seducing or bribing someone? Not to mention that, due to her importance for the overall characterization in Stannis' arc, changes to Mel effectively altered that entire storyline. And D&D managed all that with her limited screentime. Impressive.
Â 
I'll throw one more challenger against your boy Jon: Ramsay. Like, Jon at least had the beginning of his own story, while Ramsay was robbed of his. And he's philosophical! And he makes long-term plans that are both too elaborate and too stupid (posing as Theon's helper)! And his voice: they couldn't find an actor whose voice is not squeaky! Or what about Sandor? Jon at least didn't witness his iconic lines given to other characters.
Â 
I get what you're saying about Jon, but it'd be heartless to disregard the suffering of other characters. It appears every single character is somewhat misinterpreted in the show, with a possible exception of Hodor (I'm excluding Kevan and Greatjon, because they didn't have enough screentime to "develop"). Looks like D&D's scythe is merciless.

Â 
I think you hit the nail on the head. The truth is that deviations from the book generally have no consequences in the show.
Arya interacts heavily with Tywin, but her characterisation stagnates, and two seasons later there is no indication that anything that happened between them had an impact on her character. Similarly, whilst the scenes present Tywin in a different perspective to what we otherwise see of him, they are ultimately contradictory to his characterisation.Â 
The Red Waste and Qarth. In ACoK, Dany finds Vaes Tolorro and settles there, and then she chooses to go to Qarth after sending her bloodriders in various directions. In the show, Qarth is her only choice to escape the Red Waste. But this hasn't had an impact on any of her decisions. How could Dany spend so long helpless in the Red Waste watching her people die, and become dependent on the Qartheen only to be betrayed (and watch more of her people die), without it seriously affecting any future decision she makes?
Well, even the Qarth mess itself. Dany's dragons are kidnapped and she fights to get them back, but Jorah honestly believes she plans to sell one of them in Astapor? Dany is completely betrayed in Qarth by Xaro, Doreah and Pyat Pree... and yet she never shows concern about being betrayed in the show - she even walks unprotected into a crowd of Yunkai'i where she could have been killed (in ASoS, she only rides beyond her guards because she remembers her vision from the House of the Undying and knows she's safe, and later when she rides amongst them again whilst besieging Meereen she pays dearly for it as she is nearly killed).
I could list SO many more examples, but writing about these few has actually just made me so much more disappointed, and I think I got the point across. Ultimately, the show deviates from the books, but it doesn't support those deviations by allowing them to have an impact on the characters or future events. If the show itself doesn't take them seriously in the long-term, why should viewers?
3838	King Tam Stark	2014-06-11	The Giant let loose two arrows one caused severe damage and the other one sent a NW flying 100 metres it's so inaccurate or Mance could have won the war just by getting a few giants to shoot arrows while another one or two battered through the gate.
3839	Cas Stark	2014-06-11	The problem with this episode, as with every episode this season, is that the show is unwilling to do its own thing.
Â 
The showrunners repeatedly change, alter, or removeÂ relatively smallÂ details from the story; but they refuse to allow these changes to have a logical effect on the plot.
Â 
Thus when you step back and look at the actions of the characters, they all seem downright idiotic. Why was the castle so lightly held when everyone knew the Wildling's plan to strike from both sides? Why has the Watch seemingly done absolutely nothing to prepare for an attack they've known about for weeks at least?
Â 
And then you just have good, old fashioned, ill thought outÂ scenes. Lets let those mammoths and giants toy with our gates for a little. Lets put the weakest, most unreliable person we have at our disposal in charge of the only way to travel from the Wall to the castle. Lets make camp literally 100 yards away from our enemy, who we are trying to sneak up on. Also lets build a fire and post no sentries or even pay attention to our camp's perimeter.
Â 
We should really sit down with Mance and discuss how he was able to ignite a forest fire well over a mile in diameter in a frozen wasteland.
Â 
Really see no reason why the parlay with Mance/arrival of Stannis couldn't have been done this episode. I mean if we absolutely need to spend about 45 minutes a season on Sam and Gilly, two strikingly uninteresting characters, why not spread that out a little? Why did we need to jam 5-8 minutes of already covered topics(Sam likes Gilly, Gilly likes Sam, the Wildlings murder people) into this already packed episode? And we definitely needed another rehash of Jon and Sam awkwardly discussing sex. We always need more of that.


Â 
Yep. Â I agree w/all of this.
Â 
We didn't need another long segment w/the wildlings so Ygritte can say again how she wants to kill everyone, and definitely didn't need so much Sam and Gilly. Â LOL, unless Sam is the prince that was promised afterall.
Â 
And yes, yes, yes, the show changes the plot, but there is never a logical outcome of those changes....the "Asha" saving Theon and then running away leaving him still a captive was probably the worst of these change/but no change maneuvers.
3840	Veltigar	2014-06-11	I think next week's nitpick thread will be epic. There is a guy on IMDB who claims to have seen the episode and is giving spoilers. Now, he's probably bullshitting (though last year there was a guy who could describe certain shots from the RW before it had aired), but if he's not, than these boards will fucking melt down. And it will be violent
Â 
Claims from that guy:
Â 

	Spoiler A+J= T confirmed. That's why I know it's certainly BS, but imagine if D&D took a dump like that on the source material? Oh, and Brienne would apparently bite the Hounds ear of and break his leg. This is BS (Sandor would crush her) but it's bull shit that I could see D&D write into the story. It's the kind of lame screw up they do all the time.

What I find the most worrysome is that they'll probably have Brienne fight the Hound and win. Just so fucking unnecessary, Brienne is good but she's nowhere near the Hound. He beats her in every single aspect of combat (intelligence, size, speed, strength, viciousness, agility, endurance) but I could see D&D letting him lose to Brienne.
3845	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-11	Â  I confirm! However, you can also find funny things while watching it in slo-mo. For example there is a guy who got a head-sized rock falling right on his head but he forgot to go down (miracles can happen in the background...)

Honestly, with Sansa's super transformation on the show recently, part of me does suspect that Arya's training in Braavos may only equal about 3 or 4 episodes spread out over the next season.Â

That's the freaking problem. In the books it was a close call, because Jaime is magnificent even with the disadvantages he has. If Sandor goes up against Brienne, he better kill Pod and punch her square in the face. Any fight where Sandor get's bested by Brienne is utter bullshit.

Kit is good at Hollywood sword play. He wouldn't stand a chance in a real fight I'd imagine (one of those WMA practice fights).
Â 
The way he killed every single redshirt with one slash, which is about as unrealistic as you can get, and then that stupid fight with Styr. Ugh, if they had the fighting be realistic than we would have avoided the ridiculously high death toll.

I think Brienne will see that it's Arya, but Arya will not trust her imo. Than there's a fight, which will end with Arya going off to Braavos I guess?
3865	Veltigar	2014-06-11	Man, if Brienne and Podrick get to Sandor and Arya I'll be so pissed. Not because of the bizarre situation, nor because they'll probably fight, but C'MON! It took forever to Sandor and Arya to reach the Vale, and Brienne will get there between two episodes?


They borrowed LF's jetpack  Mellisandre didn't need it this season, so LF gave it to Brienne.
3866	Jslay427	2014-06-11	Thorne complementing Jon, and not seeming like such a dick.
3867	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-11	Myself, I hope all this Brienne and Sandor fighting info in the finale is as accurate a piece of info as Stannis and his appearance at the end of The Watchers on The Wall.Â  ~fingers crossed~
Â 
Maybe Shagga and Chella attack Sandor?Â  That reminds me, did they ever address their disappearance on the show after Tyrion's injury?Â

3869	Lady Grimshaw	2014-06-11	Ygritte's death. God, that was not good acting there.
Â 
She couldn't go limp or something?
Â 
The part where she and Jon meet and then afterwards with Jon cradling her were fine.

What happened in the middle?

We see her shoulder right in front of the Hound and Arya in one shot. Â As to what happens after that, I'm as clueless as you are. Â I could guess they fight, as it seems a logical conclusion to draw from what we see, but it's not something I would be wiling to bet money on.
Â 
Stannis never shown in the previews or recaps for the Wall. Â There was absolutely no evidence that he would be in the episode. Â People simply assumed he would show up based on their own wishes to see him show up, and then were angry when he didn't.

I'm not sure what Brienne and Pod will be doing in the finale, I think it's way too early for them to be the ones to come upon LS and well, that's what leads me to worry on the Sandor and Arya front with them.Â 
Â 
Now, I could maybe go with the flow on Jaime and Bronn in Dorne, as long as Jaime doesn't fuck a Sand Snake and him and Bronn take the damn Littlefinger Transporter to the Riverlands to get things back on track.Â  I do suspect there will be Bronn for him as a travelling companion.Â  But, being as this is SUPPOSED to be a Nitpick With Impunity thread, not only will I not take you to task for your thoughts on it, I will......support them 100%.Â  I suspect thatÂ  Bronn will be said to have knocked up his wife and then be the stand in for Ser Illyn.Â  He can fuck all the Sand Snakes he wants, Jaime doesn't do that.Â  I wonder, though, if Bronn will be all over the Kingdoms.........driving Cersei crazy in KL, fucking Sand Snakes, trading jests with Jaime, along with screwing his wife and naming their son Tyrion?Â

3878	Tadco26	2014-06-11	Brienne vs the Hound seem highly likely at this point.
Â 

	Spoiler Brienne said in an interview that she bites off someone's ear this season, so unless it's just a random person, the Hound seems like the most likely candidate.

I can see that they might wish to put Jamie in Dorne to keep a known character there....but, we both know that it will be senseless BS, he will be in Dorne, hanging around, and then, WHOOSH, back to KL and on to the Riverlands..I mean unless the future GRRM Blackfish goes to Dorne and so does Jamie, but i kinda doubt that....
Â 
I have refused to believe until they would be so asinine as to have Brienne and Pod meet Arya and the Hound, but it seems like this is what theyr'e going to do as insane as it is.

I have seen some of that over on the Casting forum.Â  Could be cute, could be awful, could be........putting a bunch of Nekked Snakes to play into the HBO Sand Box.Â

3887	bobbybuilderton	2014-06-11	If Jaime goes to Dorne purely to deliver Gregor's skull/Oberyn remains, I MIGHT be okay with it, maybe. It could be used as an introduction to Dorne/the rest of Oberyn's family. Show them giving him the stink eye and maybe offense at him being crippled? Sort of like how they sent Tyrion as envoy and it was insulting. Plus, his demeanor around the Sand Snakes could establish them as not to be fucked with, maybe? Maybe he could be under orders to bring Myrcella back but he talks to her and she's perfectly safe and happy, so he decides to disobey Cersei? IDK, just trying to think of some justification for sending Jaime there that won't be ridiculous.

Yes, Jamie delivering the head to Dorne isn't a bad way to get him there...which means they probably won't do it.
Â 
And, gee whiz, if they had given Ellaria more to do this season than lay around half naked in a brothel feeling up various whores....maybe then the audience would already have a Dorne character they could identify with. Â Or, even god forbid, Â have cast Prince Doran already and had him in this season for a couple of minutes...that they could have stolen off the worthless Sam and Gilly or Khaleesi doing up Missandei's hair.

They better give Jaime a Â scene where Doran/Arianne/sand snake confronts him with the death of Elia, Rhayneys and Aegon and asks him why he did not protect them. That's the only way they can justify that clusterfuck they'll be creating there.

The only thing I really had against the Tripod scene was the fact that it took up precious minutes of screentime. That could have been used better elsewhere, but the scene itself was quite solid (though of course campy as hell).
Â 
I just hope they don't put him back with the BwB. They already pulled a character assassination on the BwB and all it's members, so they should just cut their losses and roll with it. They probably won't, but I'd prefer it if he popped up in the Vale somewhere. Eventually replacing Mya Stone.

Â That IS a super nitpick of mine and will be going forward. Â

I do agree on the time needing to be spent elsewhere. Â And, things like that Podrick scene seem to have emboldened them to add tons and tons of filler this season, sad to say. Â My main nitpick is that they devote entirely too much time to their inventions, like Grey Worm and Missandei. Â It's an okay revision, but they spend too much time on it while putting the scenes in all the wrong places. Â 
Â 
I hope he doesn't go back to the Brotherhood either, but I highly suspect that the show might use the new leadership as a reason for trying to get away with it. Â It seems reminiscent of The Hound and his code........til he needed to steal from someone that is. Â

I just rewatched the episode 10 preview. In one of the shots with Hound and Arya, we're looking over someone's shoulder, who has a black plate armor on... So I think that pretty much confirms, that Brienne will meet the Hound. But the question is, will she bite his ear off and fight, or not?Â

Some of S3 was the roughest season for me (inspite of the many clusterfucks of S2), and I think it was because it was the first time I watched week by week instead of all at once. Â I read the books a few years ago (after stubbornly not reading them even after a friend gave them to me knowing I would like them. Â Well, I'm stubborn and it took awhile for me to actually open them, LOL) Â and not until I had read the whole series did I do S1 and S2 on dvd and OnDemand. Â I spent alot of S2 going WTF??? but then, popped in the next episode. Â S3 taught me that the week by week drip of episodes in comparison to a marathon can amount to what was called Chinese Water Torture in my youth, I guess now we call it Water Boarding. Â The way many of the actors handle the material makes it hard to throw in the towel with the show. Â Not to mention, the show looks beautiful. Â It did and does have so much potential, but the more I go forward with the show, the more convinced I become that D&D do not write fanfic better than some preteens do. Â 
Â 
As far as Oliver, ughhhhhhhhhh, I just don't like him, LOL Â He seems shifty. Â Granted, that one snippet about him not being on offer (for whoring and for Prince Oberyn) had promise, but with D&D it was more about Oberyn and nothing about Oliver, really. Â Now, though, I'd take him up at the Night's Watch in place of Lil Ollie and his 'wazzzzzzzzzzzzzz up' nod to Jon Snow after killing Ygritte. Â I'm telling you, I've seen soap opera writers who are considered butchers to that medium write better dreck than D&D. Â I do not like their lil creation of Ollie at the Wall. Â I'd rather have Oliver be Satin, truth be told. Â

3903	Fat Trell	2014-06-11	If Brienne does run across the Hound and Arya, the real question is whether she will even acknowledge Arya. She seems to forget her objectives the closer she gets to Stark girls.
3904	Cas Stark	2014-06-11	He is shifty, but that is why I thought him as "Satin" would be a nice touch, we could see him going from being a boy whore, who also spies for LF...up to the Wall, to confront real problems...as well as bias against him..... and could have gotten actual character development!!!! Â But, I guess not. Â
3905	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-11	Â 
Â 
I just rewatched the episode 10 preview. In one of the shots with Hound and Arya, we're looking over someone's shoulder, who has a black plate armor on... So I think that pretty much confirms, that Brienne will meet the Hound. But the question is, will she bite his ear off and fight, or not?Â 


Â 
I highly suspect she will bite his ear off if they have an encounter. Â IIRC, The Hound lost an ear in that fight at The Inn from the books. Â Honestly, no Roast Goat, no I only rescue maidens, more time for Arya and Sandor after The Inn, why even bother with the Brienne and ear biting?????????????? Â Â

LOLLLLLLLLL no problem. Â Yeah, that movie wasn't great, nor very historical, LOL, but Richard Harris was fabulous as always. Â Richard Madden, I'm dying. Â

Did you have to remind me of all those PW shots of Brienne standing 10 feet away from Sansa and doing nothing?

Â 
No reason. Â I expected that they would get in a fight with more random people...the Hound would get an additional injury and Arya would leave him. Â Brienne being the one to inflict the injury is so wrong on so many levels, and then not getting Arya, bad, bad, bad.
3909	Bori	2014-06-11	The 43 dead watchmen also depends on Ygritte's missing all her shots!
Â 

that's more or less true.  We see her shooting a lot, but only 2-3 times do we see what has happened with the arrow...
Â 
On the other hand, some of the watchmen might just be severly injured and not dead (you see, Jon survived three arrows, so anything can happen...)
3910	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-11	OMG!! Â I just found this snippet on WiC, supposedly from an interview that Kit did on Live with Kelly and Michael.

Â I'm going to watch the Live interview and post a link to that, too, once I do. Â 
Â 
On a lighter note, Kit stopped by Live with Kelly and Michael on Monday. He quickly teases the situation Jon Snow is in as we approach the finale, and reveals that his lovely locks are actually under contract by Game of Thrones, and haircuts are taken very seriously.

I can't even begin to list all the reasons it's bad, and well, I am super pissed as well that I was lulled a few episodes ago into thinking I didn't have to worry about Brienne and Sandor meeting pre Quiet Isle. Â Ughhhhhhhhhhhh. Â 
Â 
By the way, if the show really does kill off Sandor without the ambiguity of the books it will be much more than a nit for me. Â I'd be looking something like this: Â

I didn't notice it at the time either, not the first time nor on the rewatch. Â I only saw in my memory now, reading the previous post. Â That thing is damn shiny, even just in my memory. Â The funny video posted in the book spoiler discussion thread could be responsible for my noticing it, too.

BAHAHAHAHAHAAH
3916	Mother of Flagons	2014-06-11	The most memorable scene for me was when he ordered Grenn, pretty much, to his death at the Gate. Jon "knew" what he was telling Grenn to do, Grenn "knew" what was going to happen but he did so without question. Jon's reaction to seeing Grenn at the end was very important IMO because that is what leaders/rulers should feel when their friends/comrades/subjects/whatevers die. The exact thing that Stannis does not which is why I am kind of glad he didn't take the glory away from Jon this episode a la Tywin/Tyrion at Blackwater.Â 

This is exactly why I'm also relieved Stannis didn't swoop in.

3918	Fat Trell	2014-06-11	Aren't Jon's actions at the end of the episode the exact opposite of sound leadership? He takes no council, no time to think over his decision, he blatantly ignoresÂ the fact that Thorne, Aemon, and Slynt are all still alive. He basically makes a very rash decision that will have far reaching consequences for the entireÂ WatchÂ based off it being the firstÂ idea that popped into his exhausted, grief addled head and Sam having no idea of his own to put forth on the spot.

Â 
Hound being alive or dead in the books matters about as much to the show writers as any of the other characters they have killed off who are still alive in the books.Â  If they don't want to keep the actor on payroll or worry about having to bring him back laterÂ if he has a bigger role in future books, then they will kill him off and change what happens in the book.Â  It doesn't necessarily mean anything in regards to the future books though.Â  And of course fighting Brienne doesn't necessarily mean she kills him, could just leave him in a condition that makes it look like he will die.

I told my show-only friend how the circumstances were different in the books and he said that it makes much more sense the book's way. I did not tell him Stannis shows up, though. He usually doesnt mind too much hearing about the differences to the books. Â We were talking about it because we were discussing if the way it was in the show made for better tv. He agreed that it would have been better for them to have the southern attack in one episode and then the bigger battle in another, as he is one of the people who are not really interested in the wall, but recognizes that Jon is being set up as important.

It did gave me another serious nitpick though. At 00.32, when Styr comes at Jon after he threw him in that fire, you can clearly see Styr wearing a short sword (like the one Tormund fought with) on his belt. Why the fuck didn't he use that instead of picking Jon up?Â

Eventually the pricks who cry "purist!" every time someone says this will see the light. I'm pretty sure most people who are accused of being purists liked scenes in the first season with Robert and Cersei where he talks about Lyanna/past wars. Which shows that we do not demand that things be exactly like the books. We demand quality, plain and simple. And the truth of the matter is that the things they change or add tend to a)make no sense, b)be poorly written, or c)all of the above. Make some additions or changes that are on par with the quality of the material you are adapting, and we would be fine, I suspect.
Â 
This reminds me of another topic brought up when discussing the events at the wall, which is Sam not being there when the events of last episode happen. When my friend discovered this, he was understandably even more annoyed that we have spent time on tedious Sam scenes that (from what I've observed) most show viewers couldn't give a fart about.

Completely agreed.Â  Take Sam as just one example.Â  Instead of playing up Sam and Gilly now when the screen time could be so much better spent on other important parts of the story the writers couldÂ have saved theÂ Sam and Gilly romance for the ship voyage (you know, like in the books).Â  Everyone would still get the same romantic, emotional payoff for our reluctant hero Sam (i.e. fat pink mast Â ).Â  What would have been wrong with that?Â 
Â 
Although, at this point it just makes me think the writers probably aren't even going toÂ include the ship voyage and they'll just have Sam get ahold of Littlefinger's teleportation device to get to Oldtown (if that even happens).Â Â Â Â Â

I mentioned to my friend that he could have asked Jon if he knew any honorable houses/lords in the north who would take her into their service. With Jon then reminding him that he's just a bastard and has no place requesting favors of lords. That way you see Sam at least TRYING something mildly sensible And THEN if that fails, maybe sending her to Mole's Town. But even then it doesn't make much sense as he knows wildlings are coming from the south. We would also have Jon's station in their world reinforced, before he steps up to leadership during the battle. His response was that Sam isn't exactly a master tactician. Which was frustrating because Sam's intelligence is supposed to be one of his defining characteristics. Self perceived cowardice or not, he is still smart.Â

I think it starts off as a nitpick thread and everyone gets each other all riled up . Like when someone who is angry is talking to a crowd who is listening and every time something is said, the crowd goes "hmm, yeah! YEAH!"
3940	The Bastard of Summer	2014-06-11	Wasn't looking forward to this episode. Just like I wasn't looking forward to the Blackwater episode in season 2. I hate the battle scenes in the books and on the show. Hated that Jon saw Ygritte killed instead of just finding her. Hated most of the Sam scenes. I could have skipped that episode all together.

3942	Duckface	2014-06-11	Brienne met Sansa. She probably meets Arya in episode 10. Then in S5 she meets LSH. She will tell LSH that she saw Sansa&Arya and they are probably alive somewhere?
3943	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-11	The show and the books have now become completely different creatures. Its time to come to terms with that and not expect everything to follow the letter. Hell, things are gonna get really bizarro in the next episode and beyond. Like reallyÂ freaking bizarro.Â I heard something about Jaime going to Dorne... The time for being arsed about it has long passed. The show is now its own entity separate from the books. While i do think it will hint to how shit will go down in future books, its veering. I think most of the MAIN plot bombs will be exactly the same as the books, but how things arrive to those plot bombs is what differs here and there. (i am of the mind that Tyrion's stuff is going to remain largely unaltered.)Â 
Â 
Like with Arya, stuff is different with how she gets where she is. However, she still arrives to the same plot point(s). She'll wind up on that ship to Braavos, but it wont exactly be the same way she did in the books. Stannis is still gonna show up at the Wall and save the day. Its a lot of the in-between stuff that gets shuffled here and there.Â 
Â 
Thus is life.Â  

Im kinda excited about it cuz there will be things i wont see coming and thats always kinda cool. Especially when its done well.Â

I think most of us have come to terms with it. We're now just poking holes in the shitty writing this show has and occasionally we bring up the books to show what could be done better. I mean when I look at my list of things that were wrong with this episode, than I hardly refer to the books. It's been to long since the last time I read ASOS to be accurate about it.
Â 
But we can and must critique the show as an entity on its own. The stupid insipid battle choreography, the endless amount of redshirts getting killed, the moronic battleplans, the awkward uninterrupted Ygrette death scene, the poor dialogue in the Sam scenes no one cares about, that stupid scythe, the lack of Ghost, Kit's shitty acting, the fact that Grenn doesn't think of using speers, the annoying kid, Wildlings that don't check their camps perimeter, no Mance Rayder, the fact that they'll probably destroy one of the only things they did better on the show in future episodes (show Alliser is a more relatable character than book Alliser, but the wound they gave him probably means that he'll take on Bowen Marsh's role) and we can just keep on going really.
Â 
It's just really, really sad and disappointing.

3945	Cas Stark	2014-06-11	I don't think they're completely different at all, especially when they retain all of the major plot elements and the characters are with few exceptions, the same characters as the books. It's an adaptation. Â A fairly close adaptation.

And it is an adaptation that struggles the most with the plots that it invents.

The problem is that the show isn't consistent within itself. It makes changes that should have far reaching implications(Brienne and Jaime being in KL pre-PW, Thorne and Slynt being at the Wall before the battle's start, there being a considerable gap in time between Jon returning to the Wall and Styr's attack), but refuses to follow through with these actions' logical changes to the Book's plot. The Show always snaps back to the main plot line, it never deviates from major plot points and their immediate consequences. Â 
Â 
The things they change are always inconsequential, and largely illogical,Â to the plot.
Â 
For example; Sandor and Arya have had quite a different journey on the show than they did in the books. They have spent more time together, they have been much moreÂ friendly with each other, they have even travelled much further. But I would bet you my life that on Sunday, Arya will leave the Hound as he lay dying to board a ship headed for Braavos.

Now please don't take this as an insult to you or your intelligence, but when you use the word 'critique' then follow up with the word 'stupid', the two words just seem to negate themselves ... in my mind at least.Â  If you had substituted 'stupid' for : unintelligent, vacuous, vapid, obtuse, moronic, nonsensical, ill-considered, inane ... well, you get my drift, right?Â  And yes, I did just google the thesaurus to get that list of synonyms for 'stupid'!Â Â  
Â 
Anyways, I have no issue with critiques.Â  I just don't feel good about the 'attack' mentality some use while they are doing the critique.Â  It comes down to: are you Rex Reed or Robert Roger Ebert?Â  I like RobertÂ  Roger Ebert, even though I don't agree with him a whole lot of times.Â Â

I didnt find last week's episode too disappointing. There were things i wanted to see and didnt, but i didnt get too upset or disappointed in it because i know i will see Mance soon and Stannis.Â A lot of the stuff you pointed out is very opinionated and not exactly what i would call objective. Theres nothing wrong with that, but its not at all universal.Â Seriously, you are an extreme minority when it comes to that scythe, mate.Â Bolded, very much opinion. Very very much opinion.Â Â I don't think they're completely different at all, especially when they retain all of the major plot elements and the characters are with few exceptions, the same characters as the books. It's an adaptation. Â A fairly close adaptation.Â And it is an adaptation that struggles the most with the plots that it invents.Its pretty different. Most of the vibe is the same, and so are the characters for the most part, but everything else is rather different. This has a lot to do with composited characters and stuff. The show stopped being adapted by the letter after season 1. I wont deny that it does at times, struggle with reconciling subplots it invents. The Craster's subplot was too much of a clusterfuck.Â Â I don't spend a lot of time trying to predict what will happen in the future (book or show) because I do like being surprised/entertained.Â  Were I to know everything that was going to happen, the experience would be rather humdrum (book or show) for me.Â  As it stands, I'm intrigued by this rumour of Jaime heading south!Â Â  I definitely want to see him sass the Sand Snakes/Doran/whoever!Â  Jaime winding up in Dorne may be another composited circumstance. Balon Swann doesnt seem to exist in the show, so Jaime may wind up in his place. This is just a rumor i saw on WiC.net. I should be more arsed about that possibility than i am. Cuz this means his Riverlands arc is going to be pushed back if its true. But again, im just not thatÂ arsed to be all up in arms about it.Â Â For example; Sandor and Arya have had quite a different journey on the show than they did in the books. They have spent more time together, they have been much more friendly with each other, they have even travelled much further. But I would bet you my life that on Sunday, Arya will leave the Hound as he lay dying to board a ship headed for Braavos.The thing is, there will likely be a reason why Arya leaves him. Either she will be told to leave him by Sandor himself, or he says or does something that reminds her that she hates him. Thats one plot im sure there will be a logical explanation for.Â A better example would have been Asha's "raid" on the Dreadfort. Now that was just plain illogical.I dont think Stannis' trek to the Iron Bank was illogical cuz im almost certain that had a lot to do with him coming to rely on Davos more than Melisandre. Thus beginning Stannis' character development.Â So at least in my opinion, not all the changes are illogical.Â
3950	teemo	2014-06-11	I'm still not over Arya not killing The Tickler. Â The excuse that apologists had back in the day is that "people wouldn't remember the Tickler by then," well obviously the audience probably wouldn't have remembered Lommy either, because they had to add in the dialogue of Arya telling the Hound who he was. Â I just miss her screaming his own phrases as she killed him. Â That scene is so epic in the books. Â Her pissed over Lommy? Â Meh, whatever. Â
3951	roxWolfox	2014-06-11	I dont think Stannis' trek to the Iron Bank was illogical cuz im almost certain that had a lot to do with him coming to rely on Davos more than Melisandre. Thus beginning Stannis' character development.Â 
So at least in my opinion, not all the changes are illogical.Â 


I agree with this.Â  It is rather obvious on re-read that Stannis becomes more independent-thinking the further away from Melisandre he is.Â  Maybe the Iron Bank scene was a nod to that particular part of Stannis' storyline?

Â Snipped.
Â 
Yes, but logically, Arya and the Hound would never have made it out of The Vale to begin with, they would have been taken for questioning...because the Hound is wanted by the crown and because Arya Stark. Â They would never have been allowed to walk away. Â It's ridiculous.

Bolded, very much opinion. Very very much opinion.Â 


And did I refer to the fact that we didn't get to see Stannis? And the only reason I mentioned Mance (for whom I don't particularly care in the books btw) is because you would think we would get to see him. In a show that prides itself on having grey characters and portraying both sides, the wildlings were pretty one dimensional killing machines. I don't see how they can make up for that clusterfuck.
Â 
And was there stuff that was my opinion in my arguments? Sure, I personally like their Alliser (so far) better than what we got in the books. Others might disagree. The majority though, was plain truth. So much fails against logic and so many stupid cliches, in a franchise that claims it's all about circumventing them (Everyone can die! The good guys wear black clothing! This perfect golden knight fucks his sister and threw a kid out of a tower!).
Â 
Furthermore, we get the fanboys and the writers to partake in a circlejerk every freaking time ("best piece of television ever"). Which is really infuriating when you look at what a mess they make of things. Now, if I hadn't read the books I wouldn't be as passionate about it. I would just smile at the infuriating queste the writers seem to have to make as little sense as possible and I would consider GoT as campy fun at it's best (like Highlander or stuff like that). Sadly, I have read the books, so not only do their flaws as a show annoy me, but I have a guide right next to me that shows how they can do a better job with all the resources they have. We could see a serious drama, that happens to take place in a fantasy setting. And we get robbed of that!

He was a really good movie critic. Sad that he's no longer with us. I can only recall two three times where I really didn't agree with him (his rating for both Gladiator and Intouchables was way to low. And of course his take on "your highness").

You know this guy is a real douche if he turns out to be right. Not only does he not use spoilertags (eventhough he spoils an entire episode), he also breaks HBO's trust by telling everyone what's going to happen. No shred of integrity.
Â 
Not that he's right of course. Most of what he claims could happen, but he made the "A+J=T" mistake that gave it all away. You would think that these trolls were smarter than using something as obviously wrong as that.
3961	VladimirDulud	2014-06-11	Â 
The problem with their big plot changes is that they make no sense.
Â 
I mean come on. Â This stuff doesn't Â hold up for 60 seconds. Â And that is only the stupid stuff they've done this season, I can't even remember the stupid stuff they did last season and the season before that.


Â 
The one that struck me the most silly was the Asha storyline, which was ill prepared for. They built her up in seasons previous, and developed an arc where you most certainly expected her to rescue Theon. I'm in agreement that this was written oddly; if we were to see her arc on paper, apart from all other context, it would appear trite.
Â 
Then again, isn't GoT the series much like this, apart from these instances? The anti-climax, the non-meeting of the heros, etc...sigh. Brienne's non-reaction to Sansa, though, that bothered me not a little.

I cant imagine why they would have Arya kill Pod, nor do I think that Tyrion is not Tywin's son. Â Otherwise, that seems pretty believable as a finale.

Â 
Here's my two cents on the matter.Â 
Â 
I do think just as many people on here (the show side of the forum, anyway) get their knickers in a twist because some people critize the show one little bit.Â  I myself enjoy quite alot of the show, wouldn't watch if I didn't.Â  I think there are extremes on both ends of this equation.Â  I enjoy what I enjoy, show and book regardless of who wrote what, and well, I enjoy a good nitpick.
Â 
I enjoy talking about the series, too, books and show.Â  It is a shame that extremes on both ends can muck up the sharing, and it's a shame that sometimes, I think some people misinterpret nitpicking as hating.Â  Myself, I'm in this thread because it is marked book spoilers.Â  I don't go in the positive one because it's non spoiler.Â 
Â 
I like discussing it all around, and for the most part, I think most do, too.Â

I do think just as many people on here (the show side of the forum, anyway) get their knickers in a twist because some people critize the show one little bit.

There are only a few who do that. But, what i see is this:Â 
"Ygritte didnt mention the castle. RUINED FOREVER! D&D ARE FUCKING STUPID AND HACKS! AHHHHH PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS SHIT ARE JUST PLAIN STUPID!"Â 
Â 
You know what? Thats not at all cool. And this is why you will have some people come in like "Bitch, please."Â 
A better way to express a distaste for something is like: "Ok so Ygritte didnt make the callback to that windmill and ask if Castle Black was a real castle. Thats a bummer and i wish they included that because its touching in the books. It would have made her death scene more powerful and they really missed an opportunity there." Or for the Stannis fanatics, instead of frothing at the mouth like they did, they could have been like "This episode would have worked a lot better had Stannis shown up. Im disappointed that Stannis didnt show up like i was hoping."Â 

Â 
I think some people misinterpret nitpicking as hating.Â

I will say that it's pretty much like this in every fandom that has an 'original' source, though. Â Like LotR or Doctor Who...there's always, ALWAYS at each other's throats, trying to prove one version is better than another. Â  It's really no different here.
3969	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-11	There are only a few who do that. But, what i see is this:Â 
"Ygritte didnt mention the castle. RUINED FOREVER! D&D ARE FUCKING STUPID AND HACKS! AHHHHH PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS SHIT ARE JUST PLAIN STUPID!"Â 
Â 
You know what? Thats not at all cool. And this is why you will have some people come in like "Bitch, please."Â 
A better way to express a distaste for something is like: "Ok so Ygritte didnt make the callback to that windmill and ask if Castle Black was a real castle. Thats a bummer and i wish they included that because its touching in the books. It would have made her death scene more powerful and they really missed an opportunity there." Or for the Stannis fanatics, instead of frothing at the mouth like they did, they could have been like "This episode would have worked a lot better had Stannis shown up. Im disappointed that Stannis didnt show up like i was hoping."Â

LOL, that's why a certain tone in posts will cause my eyes to glaze over as I employ the scroll button. Â Also, tone itself in posting is something that can be misunderstood.

3977	Saturno	2014-06-11	Now you've got me thinking and I wouldn't be surprised at all if D & D have Jaime replace Arys Oakheart and/or Balon Swann and send him to Dorne.Â  I hope not but it wouldn't surprise me.Â  Also, I certainly hope Brienne doesn't bite off Sandor's ear!Â  He's only got one left as it is! 



Initially I thought exactly that about Jaime replacing a Kingsguard, but cant be Oakheart. If will be, than he cant meet his end at Areo Hotah's axe. I would not be surprised if they'll adapt the story and make Jaime falling in Arianne's graces, but if he is definitely going to Dorne then my bet is that he will replace Swann, and other actor will be cast as Arys.

Yeah, [sarcasm alert] at this point I think they'll have Jaime and Bronn replace Oakheart and Swann at the same time and have Bronn be the one who dies while the handless Jaime lives!
3979	Saturno	2014-06-11	About people defending the show:
There are many topics and discussions out there about how good the series are. There is only ONE topic exclusively created to discuss the problems and criticize each episode. I can see no other way around: the ones who come here complaining about the nitpickers just can't handle the fact that this kind of topic exist (and I think those topics "positive nitpickins" are proof of that.) The intention of coming here and say "well, I don't understand why you guys think that about the show" is clearly to show disapproval. To recognize a apologist is easy: his discussions involve mostly other's views and opinions (trying to understand them or oppose them), and rarely the object of the critique itself.
It's like a christian going to a mosque just to make sure that every muslim knows that he disagrees with their faith.

3980	Young Nan	2014-06-11	Â My problem with the scene is that Jon & co. watch the giant and mammoth approach the gate and the giant affix the grapple-hook thingy to the door and do absolutely nothing for a few minutes. Â They should have been firing everything they could at the giant, the mammoth and the ropes connecting both to the grapple-hook thingie before it was connected. Â Finally, Jon gets around to ordering the barrels; but it's too late by then unless they get incredibly lucky, which they don't.

Oh I totally agree, I just found it comical that he treated his mammoth like a Ford F250.
3981	Young Nan	2014-06-11	What I find the most worrysome is that they'll probably have Brienne fight the Hound and win. Just so fucking unnecessary, Brienne is good but she's nowhere near the Hound. He beats her in every single aspect of combat (intelligence, size, speed, strength, viciousness, agility, endurance) but I could see D&D letting him lose to Brienne.

Oh man I agree so much.  Brienne beating the hound is exactly the sort of thing they'd do, just so that they could pat themselves on the back for having so many strong female characters during their circle jerk a.k.a. Inside the Episode.
3982	Young Nan	2014-06-11	Â 
Â 
I do have a bad feeling that Brienne is going to bite the Hounds ear off, and for reasons unknown she will fail to see that it is the alive Arya Stark that Hotpie just told her about and ride off again with Pod.

That's probably just how it will go down.  I mean,hey- show Tywin Lannister spent a whole season hanging with Arya and was smart enough to notice that she was a highborn northern girl posing as a peasant, but wasn't smart enough to consider interrogating her, or to at least evaluate whether it was advisable to have this literate northern girl read his letters and be at his war councils.  And he's way, way smarter than Brienne.  Arya could probably introduce herself as Schmarya Stark and Brienne wouldn't catch on. She'd just ask if Arya had seen a fair maiden of three-and-ten and then be on her way.
3983	Lady Arwen	2014-06-11	Just saw this Jedi version of Jon vs. Styr. It's so much better with light sabers, at least the unrealistic fighting makes sense then.
Â 
It did gave me another serious nitpick though. At 00.32, when Styr comes at Jon after he threw him in that fire, you can clearly see Styr wearing a short sword (like the one Tormund fought with) on his belt. Why the fuck didn't he use that instead of picking Jon up?Â 


Â 
Â 
This. This is hilarious.Â
3984	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-11	Initially I thought exactly that about Jaime replacing a Kingsguard, but cant be Oakheart. If will be, than he cant meet his end at Areo Hotah's axe.

Nah, it wont be Oakheart. If Jaime ends up in Dorne, he will be the Balon Swann.Â 
Â 


Oh man I agree so much. Brienne beating the hound is exactly the sort of thing they'd do, just so that they could pat themselves on the back for having so many strong female characters during their circle jerk a.k.a. Inside the Episode.


Gee i dont know, maybe he loses to Brienne because hes got an infected wound on his neck?Â 
Â 
Just saiyan.
3985	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-06-11	Oh yeah. Like GRRM would ever admit that D&D failed and the episode is shit. He can't say what he thinks you know, it kind of brings him money, he is close to D&D and the popularity of the show grows. He might have actually liked it, but you can't judge just by him saying so in public.


He likes to talk about how apprehensive he was when D&D first approached him because he was afraid they'd muck up an adaption with their own ambitions and now that it's happening right before his very eyes, all he can do is condone it. Whenever he's prodded on how he really feels (because that's the only time he'll actually say anything), he comes off as meek and makes sure to be overly careful with his words. Also, I love howÂ Neil Marshall actually used the term "spice up" in reference to what he did to the Battle of Castle Black. The dude really thought he was improving on what a bestselling novelist wrote...

^Agreed.  She couldn't beat him if he were 100%, but he won't be.  The neck is a terrible place to have an infection, because of the proximity to the brain.  She could beat him then, because she's not a pushover.
3987	Young Nan	2014-06-12	Â 
Gee i dont know, maybe he loses to Brienne because hes got an infected wound on his neck?Â 
Â Just saiyan.
He has been hurt worse and still has won fights. He fucked up undead Dondarrion with his arm on fire.  And as for Brienne, in the books Jamie was giving her a run for her money despite being starved and having his hands shackled together.  That's the books though, so I suppose it's a different Brienne. Sure, she could win because he has an infected wound, but I still think they like to make her OP because girl power.  
Just super saiyan 
							Edited by Young Nan, 12 June 2014 - 12:38 AM.
3988	Florina Laufeyson	2014-06-12	Sure, but that wound is strongly implied to be fucking Sandor's shit up considerably. Making him rather ill and thus, he gets much slower in his movements and reactions. Brienne hits like a truck most of the time, but shes slow. If Sandor is sick, hes going to be slower than her and leave himself wide open. Hence the reason why there was a bit of time spent on his wound. It will be the explanation to why he gets tore up by Brienne.

3990	kkae	2014-06-12	I really hope that the fight between Brienne and the Hound never happens. I dislike those "Who would win in a fight?" threads and I cringe already thinking how some people would use Brienne beating Hound (or vice versa) in the show as an argument even when dicussing the books (like some have done about Ned's skills because of the Ned-vs-Jaime fight from the show). Â Show-Brienne is a lot more badass than the book-Brienne though. IIRC book-Brienne kills her first man in AFFC and it was a big deal for her. They have made the show version more one dimensional character.Â 
Â 
EDIT: It would be weird if the Hound gets bitten twice and does he bite back?

Â 
You're right that this fandom is really different from other fandoms, and I think there's a damn good reason for it: ASOIAF is way different from other stories that have fandoms. Fanaticism/obsession over it isn't inspired by cool stuff a la light sabers or time travels or secret castles. No, it's inspired by human characters and their tragic fates and themes those fates and those characters emphasize/deliver. All that brings a whole new level and nature of investment in the story. Of course there are no discussion between Gimli fans and Legolas fans about who's more or less moral between the two of them. What debate about Harry Potter or Star Wars or Star Trek can possibly resemble debates about the Red Wedding or Dany's war on slavery or Tyrion killing Shae and Tywin? I dare to say - none. Nothing against fans of those stories, but this is just a different kind of story. ASOIAF has much more in common with stories that are usually considered high literature. Faulkner is someone who Martin continually cites as an influence, and you can clearly see why. Gatsby is who Martin modeled Littlefinger on, and Littlefinger is who kinda sets everything in motion. Arya made a Faustian deal (and the best part is: she doesn't even know it). Lannisters are, in a way, as Corleones would've been if Vito was not a family-centered man but ego-maniac obsessed with personal power. And so on. You don't find characters like those and developments like those in typical genre stories, regardless of the genre. ASOIAF is not designed for geeks and nerds. To tell the truth, I'm not even sure there even is a geek/nerd culture outside USA and other English-speaking countries. Don't get me wrong, we have our own crazy obsessions, mainly about sports (The World Cup will be my religion for the coming month, even though my nation's team didn't even qualify for the tournament), but, as far as I know, there no fan conventions and similar events (certainly not on the US level). And yet, ASOIAF has a fanatical following throughout the world.
Â 
And it was like that even before the show. It wasn't nearly as big as it is today, but the popularity that came with the show is a two-edged sword. I usually speak about D&D, because they are the showrunners after all, but in essence this is way beyond them. The pop-culture just doesn't know what to do with ASOIAF. It had to do something, because pop-culture couldn't just ignore a story that is as popular as ASOIAF. Too much money in that potentially. But it just doesn't know what to deal with it. And you'll see what I'm talking about if you remember the original script for GoT's pilot episode that was leaked last year. That script was much more faithful to the source material than the actual pilot. The first version of the pilot was much more faithful. But something went wrong. Someone was dissatisfied with it. I can't possibly know if it was the focus group or some HBO executive, but the decision was made to change much of the pilot. The director was replaced, and the script was altered, and it was almost completely re-shot. Then and there one can find the root of this debate and every other debate of this kind. Before that, it looked like D&D were what you might call book-purists. After that, they started deviating from the source material whenever they wanted. Now, we'll probably never know what did the first pilot look like, but I'm positive that, if something was wrong with it, it wasn't because of the script. And honestly, I'm not even sure there was anything wrong with it. That wouldn't be the first time ever TV executives made a wrong decision. If HBO was afraid it'd loose money with a more faithful adaptation, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't. And the popularity of the book series kinda testifies to that.
Â 
The irony is that ASOIAF is a product of the pop-culture, partially at least. In that aspect, it's a lot like Tarantino's Pulp Fiction: it belongs to the pop-culture and it elevates the pop-culture to a whole new level. Some works, very rare works, are a cross between pop-culture and classics. And, five books in, ASOIAF does look like that kind of story. I'd dare to say it's the best story of that kind. And it's a shame HBO didn't recognize that. The Wire and The Sopranos are usually credited as the best TV shows of all time. For a good reason, because both are truly masterpieces. But, all due respect for them, they have nothing on ASOIAF. Thematically, characterization-wise, plot-wise, ASOIAF is just more complex and rewarding. Thanks to Martin's skill in creating various cultures (which societies are always rooted in), ASOIAF even resonates with our world not a bit less than contemporary dramas like The Wire and The Sopranos do. The Wire is brilliant in depicting institutions in our society, but ASOIAF goes even further and shows how institutions work in any society and why is it so.
Â 
Debates about that kind of story are inevitably going to be passionate. And debates about an adaptation that failed to capture much of that richness - and replaced it with cliches and/or simplifications - are definitely going to be passionate. Of course, it doesn't mean the venom is welcomed. But what creates venom is a basic disrespect for different opinions. Not impressions, but opinions. And that disrespect is present in various forms. When someone tells me: "Changes are necessary because of a different medium", it's offensive, because it implies I don't understand TV is a separate medium than the books (which I really do, thank you very much), but also because it prevents any reasonable discussion, because "medium dictates changes" is a highly theoretical assumption that doesn't have to do anything with a very practical examples pointed at on these boards. Yeah, in theory, some changes may be justified because of the difference between a visual medium and a textual one. But until you bring up a particular change like that, you're only ruining a discussion if you keep repeating that "medium dictates changes". And that may be offensive, because I was perhaps looking forward to the discussion you just ruined. And, basically, by repeating a standard, theoretical excuse, that doesn't have any significance for a particular discussion, perhaps in effect you're showing it is you who don't understand the natures of different mediums.
Â 
Not to mention that the significant portion of complaints here deals exactly with he medium of television and with GoT as a separate entity. One man striking another against an anvil doesn't have to be ridiculous, especially if it's depicted by a short textual line and left for our imagination to picture the scene it in our heads. But the way it was actually filmed, it's all kinds of ridiculous. (New nitpick in that regard: why didn't Styr just continue striking Jon's head against the anvil?) The essence is lost here: television, like any other medium, is not a breathing entity that follows its own logic. TV is what they put on screen and what we watch. As with any other medium, it's about humans. Humans film it, and humans watch it. There are conventional wisdoms and guidelines created out of practice, but theorizing about "necessary changes" is disregarding the human aspect. And it's strange, to say the least, to find that notion delivered by readers of ASOIAF.

3994	Conchobar	2014-06-12	I had a problem with very few things but here they are. Sometimes I felt the music didn't give enough of a dramatic feel to the fighting. I also did not really appreciate the way there was no real display of control points and lines of infantry fighting, rather it was just a load of one on one fights spread over the courtyard. My main problem was that, even later in the battle, there were hardly any bodies on the ground, contrary the amount of people that seemed to be dying. It is just a small detail but it is really important in my opinion.

Thank you. That was beautiful.
3996	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-12	I'm not sure what the purpose is for trying to stifle too much nitpicking in a nitpick thread. Â I suppose we could all just go around saying: Â Great show, great book, same but different and still great. Â I have to say........that sounds incredibly boring. Â
3997	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-12	I personally think the show is massively over criticised. 
I sit and watch, and yeah, when Sansa saved Littlefingner I was thinking "erm... As if Littlefinger hasn't got a plan" and "This Hound is too nice" etc 
Loads of "this wasn't how it went down in the books..."
But I still enjoy the show massively. 
It doesn't use the books as a screen play, but it's still, even now, pretty damn close to the source material IMO.
I 100% agree with the notion that a lot of the changes have no consequence for the characters involved. Like Arya/Tywin... No change for either character. Scenes night as well have not happened from a narrative point of view. 
Tbf Jon learned to spit in people's faces at Crasters Keep (I enjoyed those scenes. Karl Fooking Tanner should be a POV in TWOW). 
The show is overly focuses in Tyrion and Dany as well I think. Mainly Tyrion this season as well. 
Littlefinger isn't as devious etc. 
It's still very entertaining and a lot of the times, they do pull it off really well. 
I love how it allows some of my mates who would never read the novels to experience the story... Even if it isn't 100% exact.

Debates about that kind of story are inevitably going to be passionate. And debates about an adaptation that failed to capture much of that richness - and replaced it with cliches and/or simplifications - are definitely going to be passionate. Of course, it doesn't mean the venom is welcomed. But what creates venom is a basic disrespect for different opinions. Not impressions, but opinions. And that disrespect is present in various forms. When someone tells me: "Changes are necessary because of a different medium", it's offensive, because it implies I don't understand TV is a separate medium than the books (which I really do, thank you very much), but also because it prevents any reasonable discussion, because "medium dictates changes" is a highly theoretical assumption that doesn't have to do anything with a very practical examples pointed at on these boards. Yeah, in theory, some changes may be justified because of the difference between a visual medium and a textual one. But until you bring up a particular change like that, you're only ruining a discussion if you keep repeating that "medium dictates changes". And that may be offensive, because I was perhaps looking forward to the discussion you just ruined. And, basically, by repeating a standard, theoretical excuse, that doesn't have any significance for a particular discussion, perhaps in effect you're showing it is you who don't understand the natures of different mediums.

I do enjoy the negative nitpicking threads the most.Â  Not because I like to wallow in negativity, but because I'm reminded of how different we all are, even though it is our great love/admiration for the story that brought us together in the first place.
Most movies my husband and I go to see usually end up in a debate ... a discussion of likes/dislikes about what we've seen.Â  Our differences are so pronounced that I sometimes wonder if we've seen the same movie!Â  Maybe the movie has a secret 'man-code' that I'm unaware of!Â  
Then it hit me one day: the discussion/debate after the movie is the best part for both of us!Â  I think the only movie we've ever agree on was 300 ... we went to see it 3 times in the theatre to try to figure out why our enjoyment/entertainment was unanimous, but never did.Â  It was spooky!Â

You're right that this fandom is really different from other fandoms, and I think there's a damn good reason for it: ASOIAF is way different from other stories that have fandoms. Fanaticism/obsession over it isn't inspired by cool stuff a la light sabers or time travels or secret castles. No, it's inspired by human characters and their tragic fates and themes those fates and those characters emphasize/deliver. All that brings a whole new level and nature of investment in the story. Of course there are no discussion between Gimli fans and Legolas fans about who's more or less moral between the two of them. What debate about Harry Potter or Star Wars or Star Trek can possibly resemble debates about the Red Wedding or Dany's war on slavery or Tyrion killing Shae and Tywin? I dare to say - none. Nothing against fans of those stories, but this is just a different kind of story. ASOIAF has much more in common with stories that are usually considered high literature. Faulkner is someone who Martin continually cites as an influence, and you can clearly see why. Gatsby is who Martin modeled Littlefinger on, and Littlefinger is who kinda sets everything in motion. Arya made a Faustian deal (and the best part is: she doesn't even know it). Lannisters are, in a way, as Corleones would've been if Vito was not a family-centered man but ego-maniac obsessed with personal power. And so on. You don't find characters like those and developments like those in typical genre stories, regardless of the genre. ASOIAF is not designed for geeks and nerds. To tell the truth, I'm not even sure there even is a geek/nerd culture outside USA and other English-speaking countries. Don't get me wrong, we have our own crazy obsessions, mainly about sports (The World Cup will be my religion for the coming month, even though my nation's team didn't even qualify for the tournament), but, as far as I know, there no fan conventions and similar events (certainly not on the US level). And yet, ASOIAF has a fanatical following throughout the world.
Â 
And it was like that even before the show. It wasn't nearly as big as it is today, but the popularity that came with the show is a two-edged sword. I usually speak about D&D, because they are the showrunners after all, but in essence this is way beyond them. The pop-culture just doesn't know what to do with ASOIAF. It had to do something, because pop-culture couldn't just ignore a story that is as popular as ASOIAF. Too much money in that potentially. But it just doesn't know what to deal with it. And you'll see what I'm talking about if you remember the original script for GoT's pilot episode that was leaked last year. That script was much more faithful to the source material than the actual pilot. The first version of the pilot was much more faithful. But something went wrong. Someone was dissatisfied with it. I can't possibly know if it was the focus group or some HBO executive, but the decision was made to change much of the pilot. The director was replaced, and the script was altered, and it was almost completely re-shot. Then and there one can find the root of this debate and every other debate of this kind. Before that, it looked like D&D were what you might call book-purists. After that, they started deviating from the source material whenever they wanted. Now, we'll probably never know what did the first pilot look like, but I'm positive that, if something was wrong with it, it wasn't because of the script. And honestly, I'm not even sure there was anything wrong with it. That wouldn't be the first time ever TV executives made a wrong decision. If HBO was afraid it'd loose money with a more faithful adaptation, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't. And the popularity of the book series kinda testifies to that.
Â 
The irony is that ASOIAF is a product of the pop-culture, partially at least. In that aspect, it's a lot like Tarantino's Pulp Fiction: it belongs to the pop-culture and it elevates the pop-culture to a whole new level. Some works, very rare works, are a cross between pop-culture and classics. And, five books in, ASOIAF does look like that kind of story. I'd dare to say it's the best story of that kind. And it's a shame HBO didn't recognize that. The Wire and The Sopranos are usually credited as the best TV shows of all time. For a good reason, because both are truly masterpieces. But, all due respect for them, they have nothing on ASOIAF. Thematically, characterization-wise, plot-wise, ASOIAF is just more complex and rewarding. Thanks to Martin's skill in creating various cultures (which societies are always rooted in), ASOIAF even resonates with our world not a bit less than contemporary dramas like The Wire and The Sopranos do. The Wire is brilliant in depicting institutions in our society, but ASOIAF goes even further and shows how institutions work in any society and why is it so.

Â 
Our above poster Wolfox6 mentioning her and the hubby's varying tastes, as well as 300, has helped lead me to this question?Â 


Depends on what you are looking at really. Like, I would never question the battle scenes in Spartacus (the series that is) and 300. Those fight scenes are supposed to be over the top and unrealistic. They never claim they want to make a realistic version of the Spartacus revolt or the battle of Thermopylae. It's all about kickass ninja spins, double beheadings and over the top visuals.
Â 
GoT on the other hand, is different. This is the show that claims it's a serious drama, that it's gritty, realistic and unpredictable. So, they open themselves up to a higher level of scrutiny when it comes to their battle sequences. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't expect them to be 100% realistic (GRRM isn't either btw). Most viewers would probably be shocked if they did that, because actual sword fighting is nothing like what we see in Hollywood.
Â 
What I do want to get is a sense of danger from the fights Â and a sense of strategy from the battles. An observant poster in this very thread has pointed out all the flaws in the Â Thenn's attack on CB (namely the fact that they had no plan, e.g. they didn't try to take the elevator out or lay claim on the tunnel). And the flaws off the actual fights have been discussed at length as well.
Â 
How am I supposed to suspend my disbelief if Jon, Tormund, Styr, Ygritte and Alliser are all unstopable killing machines? Bosses, who can only lose when fighting against other bosses? What's even worse is the way they take out all their opponents. When Jon get's out of that lift the Wildlings attacks them and he kills them all with one slash of his sword. Not only is the one hit = one kill thing a terrible cliche, it's also unrealistic. They never seem to wound anybody, it's always slash and they're dead. We never see them really exchange blows with nameless opponents, it's always just "random enemy comes at them screaming" and Jon/Styr/... cut them down in one swoop.
Â 
Furthermore, they are also terribly inconsistent with their skills. Like Jon kills all those redshirts and he goes up against Styr and he get's his ass handed to him. They aren't even, they don't really exchange blows, Styr just whales on him. And then he throws Jon in that fire and walks over there to give him a good beat down... while he has this huge knife on his belt, ready to use. And then it get's even worse, because Styr goes down because of one smash with the hammer in the side. Now, that would hurt in real life... but 5 seconds ago Jon got his head smacked against an anvil without even breaking a sweat. Just takes me out of the moment.
Â 
In this entire episode there were only two good fight scenes. One involved supercook and his giant meat cleaver. That was realistic (the way he threw that boiling stew in the guys face) and funny (that giant meat cleaver is a marvel). The other was Alliser vs. Tormund. It's totally unrealistic of course, even without a shield Alliser should make short work of Tormund's little blade and then there's some terrible choreography with the stab around the pole and Tormund rolling away from him (if you do that in a real fight you'll be dead as a dodo). But when they actually engaged with each other, Tormunds acting was convincing enough to forget about all that and make it fun to watch.

It doesn't use the books as a screen play, but it's still, even now, pretty damn close to the source material IMO.
I 100% agree with the notion that a lot of the changes have no consequence for the characters involved. Like Arya/Tywin... No change for either character. Scenes night as well have not happened from a narrative point of view.
Tbf Jon learned to spit in people's faces at Crasters Keep (I enjoyed those scenes. Karl Fooking Tanner should be a POV in TWOW).
The show is overly focuses in Tyrion and Dany as well I think. Mainly Tyrion this season as well.
Littlefinger isn't as devious etc.
It's still very entertaining and a lot of the times, they do pull it off really well.
I love how it allows some of my mates who would never read the novels to experience the story... Even if it isn't 100% exact.


Karl Tanner is easily the best new character the show has come up with. He carried that filler arc by himself pretty much.Â
4009	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-12	Tsss, you're losing your grip Wolfox6  As punishment for missing their 50th installment, you have to watch 300 and take a shot everytime a male nipple is visible on screen 
Â 
Â 
  Are you telling me that Persian Goat People aren't a real thing?  I'm geniunely shocked 
Â 
Â 
Depends on what you are looking at really. Like, I would never question the battle scenes in Spartacus (the series that is) and 300. Those fight scenes are supposed to be over the top and unrealistic. They never claim they want to make a realistic version of the Spartacus revolt or the battle of Thermopylae. It's all about kickass ninja spins, double beheadings and over the top visuals.
Â 
GoT on the other hand, is different. This is the show that claims it's a serious drama, that it's gritty, realistic and unpredictable. So, they open themselves up to a higher level of scrutiny when it comes to their battle sequences. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't expect them to be 100% realistic (GRRM isn't either btw). Most viewers would probably be shocked if they did that, because actual sword fighting is nothing like what we see in Hollywood.
Â 
What I do want to get is a sense of danger from the fights Â and a sense of strategy from the battles. An observant poster in this very thread has pointed out all the flaws in the Â Thenn's attack on CB (namely the fact that they had no plan, e.g. they didn't try to take the elevator out or lay claim on the tunnel). And the flaws off the actual fights have been discussed at length as well.
Â 
How am I supposed to suspend my disbelief if Jon, Tormund, Styr, Ygritte and Alliser are all unstopable killing machines? Bosses, who can only lose when fighting against other bosses? What's even worse is the way they take out all their opponents. When Jon get's out of that lift the Wildlings attacks them and he kills them all with one slash of his sword. Not only is the one hit = one kill thing a terrible cliche, it's also unrealistic. They never seem to wound anybody, it's always slash and they're dead. We never see them really exchange blows with nameless opponents, it's always just "random enemy comes at them screaming" and Jon/Styr/... cut them down in one swoop.
Â 
Furthermore, they are also terribly inconsistent with their skills. Like Jon kills all those redshirts and he goes up against Styr and he get's his ass handed to him. They aren't even, they don't really exchange blows, Styr just whales on him. And then he throws Jon in that fire and walks over there to give him a good beat down... while he has this huge knife on his belt, ready to use. And then it get's even worse, because Styr goes down because of one smash with the hammer in the side. Now, that would hurt in real life... but 5 seconds ago Jon got his head smacked against an anvil without even breaking a sweat. Just takes me out of the moment.
Â 
In this entire episode there were only two good fight scenes. One involved supercook and his giant meat cleaver. That was realistic (the way he threw that boiling stew in the guys face) and funny (that giant meat cleaver is a marvel). The other was Alliser vs. Tormund. It's totally unrealistic of course, even without a shield Alliser should make short work of Tormund's little blade and then there's some terrible choreography with the stab around the pole and Tormund rolling away from him (if you do that in a real fight you'll be dead as a dodo). But when they actually engaged with each other, Tormunds acting was convincing enough to forget about all that and make it fun to watch.


Â 
There AREN'T really Persian Goat People?Â  I'll be crying over that off in a corner soon, but still grateful that I've only seen bits of the movie 300 on cable.Â  I have seen enough to know that lack of Goat doesn't just apply to Sapphires and GOT, LOL
Â 
I did just want to thank you for your answer.Â  This question about battle analysis has been on my mind since episode 8 and the thread that was more specific to the Duel itself.Â  The more I read it, the more I wondered if some of it was a 'guy thing' for want of a better phrase.Â  I do agree that the show seems to be going more and more Hollywood with the fights and the big battles, too.Â  Being interested in history and yes, the battles that go with them inspite of being a 'girl,' LOL, I do know that it's a messy, up close and in the face personal bit of bloody business face to face for those that are involved in it.Â  It most likely wouldn't be something, real world version past and present, that Hollywood choreographers would be interested in.Â 
Â 
This subject has been on my mind since that Duel thread, and I thank you for taking the time to answer me.Â  I remember noticing even the analysis about cuts in the scenes, comparisons to Rob Roy (which, hit me with a wet noodle, I still haven't seen.Â  As a Liam Neeson fan, I should be ashamed), etc.Â  I just wondered if some of the interest in these type of scenes, both content and technical detail, was a 'guy thing.'Â  I like guys, LOL, just curious and again, thank you for the answer.Â 
Â 
PS........LOVED the cook and the boiling water and the cleaver.Â  I do wonder if ole Three Finger Hobb was there in the mess, aka, kitchen.Â  He has been mentioned.Â  I guess I should be grateful he wasn't killed.Â  After all, D&D have left The Wall quite understaffed, and it's already cost us a Pyp and Spectacular Grenn.Â  That is STILL one of my big, big nitpicks.Â  If around The Wall had been fleshed out better these past four seasons (seems like plenty of time to me) there might be men left besides Jon, Sam, Thorne, and Slynt.Â

He was a hell of a lot of fun and made a lot of fans love him for his over the top behavior. Â Plus he had an awesome death, and taught Jon about fighting dirty. Â I liked it.

I don't enjoy wallowing in negativity either, hell......sometimes, it can be done for fun, for love of something, or just for the realization that nothing is perfect.Â  Loved the story of you and hubs and 300.Â  Can't say it's made me prefer it over a documentary, though, LOLÂ 


Oh, I enjoy watching docs and drama when at home, but my theatre interests are pretty simple.Â  "Gah!Â  Did you see that tiger in the trailer?Â  MUST GO SEE MOVIE!"Â  orÂ  "Look, look, look!Â  A WOLF/DRAGON/DINOSAUR!Â  RAWR!"Â  or "GARY OLDMAN/KARL URBAN!

100,000 brains cells just keeled over when I considered (for a fleeting moment) the amount of alcohol I'd have to buy were we to do a 'shot per nipple' rewatch of 300.Â  I'm feeling rather light-headed right now .... I'm hoping I didn't frighten them to death with the mere thought. Â  
Â 
As to the battle/duel discussion.Â  I'm of two minds about the 'realism' necessary for me to be entertained.Â  I've never fought in a war, or trained for one, so I can't judge on the reality of the experience.Â  I was raised by a military family, who have generations of wartime vets, so I have heard the stories ... but the ones who refused to ever speak of their experience on the battlefields were the ones who impressed me the most.Â  That maybe why I have no interest in watchingÂ  a realistic battle.Â  Over-the-top, action-packed, CGI battles though?Â  No prob!Â 
And simply because we are discussing a fantasy series here, I couldn't help but think of Morrowind when reading your words concerning Jon's skill. I started off the game getting slaughtered by caterpillar-worms and rats, and by the end of the game I was taking down Gods (3 of them, dammit!Â  Woot!).Â  Nothing realistic at all about those battles, but they were f'ing fun!Â  Who's to say Jon won't be a God-killer by the end of the story?
But, then again, I'm a gal who spends most of her days making sure our cat and cockatiel don't kill each other.Â  Those are the only realistic battles I do get to watch.Â  
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â  I remember noticing even the analysis about cuts in the scenes, comparisons to Rob Roy (which, hit me with a wet noodle, I still haven't seen.Â  As a Liam Neeson fan, I should be ashamed), etc.Â  I just wondered if some of the interest in these type of scenes, both content and technical detail, was a 'guy thing.'Â  I like guys, LOL, just curious and again, thank you for the answer.Â

Rob Roy!Â  I looked for a version of that movie for years wanting to see what the fuss was about ... hubs is a big fan of his, as well.Â 
Â 
I didn't notice the cook and that cleaver until my second watch, and boy was I scared.Â  That guy was terrifying!Â  Either that or my Dark Souls nightmares came back to haunt me the moment I saw the goddamn size of that goddamn cleaver!Â

4012	Miodrag	2014-06-12	How does ASOIAF delve deeper into institutions than The Wire? I don't see that at all.


Â 
The Wire depicts, rather brilliantly, whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong with the institutions of today: that they are constantly used for the benefits of a few, while interests of the public are almost completely disregarded, even though institutions are meant to serve the public first and foremost. That theme is the main one in the show and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s analyzed through five seasons, with multitude of angles covered â<U+0080><U+0093> but mostly, perhaps exclusively even, from the perspective of the so-called middle management. We never see whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s at the very top of the food chain. In ASOIAF, we do. Institutions, even those most powerful and therefore most distant, are just humans, even at the very top. Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s always some Tywin, or Aerys, or Drogo, or Doran, or whoever, pulling the strings. Their fears and frustrations and secrets are also depicted and calculated in. The closest thing we get in The Wire in that regard are The Greek and Avon and Marlo. Hypothetically, if they were somehow created by GRRM, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>d probably know their entire family trees, their childhood secrets, their sexual prerogatives, and so on.
Â 
Hope you realize Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not criticizing The Wire. They chose their theme and explored it thoroughly. But, as David Simon said, in the universe of The Wire institutions are like gods in Greek tragedies: entities that are above influence. And for the middle management, which was the focus of the show, it is true. But for the main players it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t. And ASOIAF does bring their perspective, too. And we often see them in dramatic circumstances, when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re facing tough choices, and where their weaknesses, as well as their strengths, are at full display.
Â 
Also, the perspective of the common people is somewhat in the back in The Wire. There are Sobotkas in season two, and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Cutty, and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s it, as far as I can remember. Basically, the question why do we obey institutions in the first place if we all know how corrupted they are, is never asked. In ASOIAF it is. Not only asked theoretically (Varysâ<U+0080><U+0099> riddle), but there are also practical examples of people accepting institutions for the first time in their lives (wildlings in ADWD, freed slaves from Slaverâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Bay), and we also have institutions that went through significant changes and are therefore forced to fight for legitimacy in the eyes of the public/their subjects (Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Rebellion as a crucial event from the past that is frequently visited through various recollections, and each of the Five Kings in the present). And Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d say individuals like Barristan also belong in this category.
Â 
Thanks to its scope and scale, ASOIAF deals with various forms of institutions, some of which are missing from The Wire: family as the basic institution of any society (in The Wire, we get a closer look only at the Barksdales), state governments, religious authorities, military orders, even financial superpowers a la Iron Bank. There are some institutions present in The Wire that are missing from ASOIAF â<U+0080><U+0093> education and the media â<U+0080><U+0093> but I guess they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fit well into a medieval-like world.
Â 
Because of all that, ASOIAF probably has a wider appeal. The Wire depicts very specific institutions in a very specific era: modern urban environments, as Herc says. Of course it resonates with me, because I live in a city. (One more testament to the brilliance of The Wire: Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a journalist, and I met quite a few politicians and other public officers in my career â<U+0080><U+0093> and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re perfect images of Carceti and Rawls and Clay Davis and Valchek; not to mention the media themselves, which are depicted extremely faithfully.) But, people from small towns or villages or other not so urban areas donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to feel the same connection I do. And, from my experience, they rarely do. Not that they dislike the show. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s written masterfully and easy to like, even if it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t resonate with oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s life too much. But ASOIAF, similar to The Sopranos for example, deals with things like families, which practically everyone can relate to.
Â 
One more thing. In ASOIAF, we see some institutions being challenged to their very limits (NW most of all). Speaking from a country that had more than its fair share of political and social disturbances in my lifetime, I find that perspective brilliantly explored in ASOIAF.
Â 
Once more, I adore and greatly respect The Wire. I just love and respect ASOIAF even more, and its take on institutions is one of the reasons why.
4013	Indigocell	2014-06-13	- The show didn't make me care about Ygritte as much as I did in the books.Â 
Â 
"Is this a proper castle now?" made me shed a tear.
4014	Veltigar	2014-06-13	Â 
There AREN'T really Persian Goat People?Â  I'll be crying over that off in a corner soon, but still grateful that I've only seen bits of the movie 300 on cable.Â  I have seen enough to know that lack of Goat doesn't just apply to Sapphires and GOT, LOL


I would still recommend 300. It's a dumb movie, but a dumb awesome movie imo  Don't let the lack of goat people stop you 
Â 


I did just want to thank you for your answer.Â  This question about battle analysis has been on my mind since episode 8 and the thread that was more specific to the Duel itself.Â  The more I read it, the more I wondered if some of it was a 'guy thing' for want of a better phrase.Â  I do agree that the show seems to be going more and more Hollywood with the fights and the big battles, too.Â  Being interested in history and yes, the battles that go with them inspite of being a 'girl,' LOL, I do know that it's a messy, up close and in the face personal bit of bloody business face to face for those that are involved in it.Â  It most likely wouldn't be something, real world version past and present, that Hollywood choreographers would be interested in.Â

Â 


It probably is more of a guy thing, since most students of WMA and military history seem to be men. But I'm sure there are plenty of women who are interested in this. Just like plenty of men are interested in the clothes and hairstyles of the characters for instance.
Â 
And great that you bring up the editing in Oberyn vs. the Mountain. I was one of the people that complained about that. And we were right to, Ran did an analysis of the length of each shot and it was ridiculously short compared to what is usually shown in film. The thing that bothered me about that duel is that Wushu is of course complete ballony in a fight like this (Oberyn was just tiring himself out), but also that they didn't use Pedro. I didn't feel emotionally invested becasue the guy who was doing those spins didn't even look like Pedro (he was more slender and his hair much darker). Pedro did such a good job, with so little material to work with, and they refused to let him act in the scene. There were a lot of other things wrong with the fight (Mountain holding that sword in one hand), but those were two of my main gripes.
Â 
Oh, and as a Liam Neeson fan, you seriously have to sit down and watch Rob Roy. It's a great movie, much better than Braveheart (which came out in the same year). And the final duel scene is really a thing of beauty. It's phenomenally shot, choreographed, acted (Tim Roth is deliciously evil throughout) and it has been built-up throughout the entire movie. All things that sadly weren't true for Oberyn vs. Gregor.
4015	Veltigar	2014-06-13	Â 



PS........LOVED the cook and the boiling water and the cleaver.Â  I do wonder if ole Three Finger Hobb was there in the mess, aka, kitchen.Â  He has been mentioned.Â  I guess I should be grateful he wasn't killed.Â  After all, D&D have left The Wall quite understaffed, and it's already cost us a Pyp and Spectacular Grenn.Â  That is STILL one of my big, big nitpicks.Â  If around The Wall had been fleshed out better these past four seasons (seems like plenty of time to me) there might be men left besides Jon, Sam, Thorne, and Slynt.Â Â  


I hope meat cleaver guy turns out to be Three Finger Hobb  This could be one of the rare times when D&D made a small improvement, if they keep Stannis line ("everyone... even the cook") in the show it would be much more epic 
Â 
True, there were like 43 confirmed dead NW members. And that's without counting the arrows Ygritte shoots that we don't see hitting someone. That's one of the setbacks of letting your heroes kill huge numbers of redshirts. Things just start to lose sense. If they made fightscenes a bit more realistic, they wouldn't need to resort to such ridiculously high kill counts.
Â 
And Slynt will be gone soon. And I dread what they'll do with Alliser. They had been doing such a good job with him, he was easily a better character than he was in the books (more relatable imo, certainly in season one). But now that they have killed Pyp and Grenn and gave Alliser a wound, I'm sure they'll make Thorne into Bowen Marsh. So stupid and cliche.
Â 
And it's not really hard to do better imo. I would have approached the season 3 storyline of the Wall like this:Â 
Â 
They should have made use of Locke better. Instead of doing that stupid CK's plot and the inane Gilly in moles town, they should have had Locke take refuge at CB in fear of reprisals from Tywin (which made a lot more sense). Perhaps have him take his family (wife, a son to replace Olly) with him and installing them in Moles town.Â 
Â 
Keep the early Jon-Locke scene in the courtyard. And keep Ygritte's attack on the other village (but postpone the introduction of the Thenns and cut the kid). Then, introduce a plotline where Jon pleeds to evacuate the villagers from other towns. He get's his volunteers and they ride out. They save Molestown and Locke get's newfound respect for Jon, eventhough he still hates nobles. At this point, Jon puts Ghost away because the villagers are affraid of him. Especially, Locke's son should be frightened (invent something about how the boy got bit by Ramsay's dogs once).
Â 
Introduce the Thenns and let them please not be superevil cannibals. In fact they should have emphasised the Thenns society. Let the Magnar be the Godlike figure he is in the books, a father to his people. Make the Thenn warriors old (like Styr only took the men of his generation with him, so that the young warriors could stay with their faimilies). Take time for a scene where Tormund and Styr make plans for battle (instead of that idiotic "sshhht" scene between Ygritte and Gilly) and then give Styr a speech in the Old Tongue. Something about how their families would have to die no more after today, and that they would be safe in the south. You know give them a heart ;-)
Â 
Then attack CB. Since the Thenns weren't there at Molestown, the attack is unexpected (because they though Tormunds band was to small to pose a threat). And we have a reason why the NW hadn't properly prepared. They get inside the, slaughter follows. Thorne goes downstairs, gives Jon the wall and takes Slynt with him (who disappears after that, until Sam finds him). When he steps out the lift, let him give his speech. The fight rekindles (have the cook scenes here) and eventually Alliser is killed by Tormund.
Â 
Then we have the Wildlings trying to break through the gate. Locke goes downstairs (armed with spears!!!) and he takes some men (including Grenn with him). The giant smashes through the gate (no ridiculous gate lifting) and he's accompanied by a couple of Wildlings (3-4 max) that survived the initial downpour of hot oil and arrows. Let Locke and company recite the NW vows (that was a good addition), while the giant charges forwards.
Â 
Meanwhile, Sam and Pyp are somewhere in the CB, trying to reach the lift. Pyp get's shot by Ygritte, but he doesn't die. Sam goes up and tells Jon what happens. Jon leaves the wall to Dolorous Edd (intro a funny Edd line). And he takes as many men as possible, because they are about to storm the barricade and take the tunnel.
Â 
In the lift, have Locke's son stand next to him. And then let Jon give him the old "you can only be brave when you're affraid line" (callback to Ned + shows how much Jon has grown and at the same time stayed the same). Jon hands Sam the key. They get out of the lift and Sam is immediately held back to help the wounded (you spend so much time reading, you ought to know a bit about patching them up). He hands the key to Locke's boy, Jon attacks.
Â 
Locke's boy hurries to get to the shed. Ygritte spots him and shoots at him, he shoots back. They exchange several arrows until he ducks and manages to release Ghost, who storms out. Ygritte's distracted (by the first clash between Styr and Jon) and the boy then picks up his bow and climbs on the roof. In the mean time Jon meets Styr. He and Ghost fight together and barely manage to overcome the Magnar (ideally, Jon would employ a dirty trick, like sending Ghost to attack a wounded man, to kill Styr).
Â 
The battle is running on it's last legs. Keep the scene where Jon shoots Tormund. Then Samwell comes and calls for Jon. They go behind the building and there they find Ygritte. Barely clinging to live, Jon kneels besides her. He sees the arrow (clearly recognizable as one of Locke's boy's arrows. Who would have a different color than the others since he made them himself) and they exchange last words. End episode nine.
Â 
Begin episode 10 with Sam and Jon going through the tunnel. They find Locke inside the tunnel, like they found Donal Nooye. All the others are death, except for maybe Grenn who's severly injured. Jon gives Longclaw to Sam, and hides a dagger. He sets out and then we have Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!
Â 
Next season. We have Slynt left to behead, Alliser and Locke are dead. Grenn's out of the picture and Edd and the boy provide back up to Jon. The role of Bowen Marsh is taken over by Pyp. He was always scared of the Wildlings and after his wound, he started to hate them even more. Add Â to that that it was Ygritte who shot him, and you get a personal motive for his attack on Jon.
Â 
EDIT: oh, and how I'd handle Bran's storyline in this case:
Â 
1) They get caught by the deserters.
2) Burn Gorman speech, with the addition that others tried to challenge him for leadership of the mutineers before, and that he killed them all (fights over wine and women). And you have an explanation for why there are just four or five of them.
3) Gorman interrogates them and makes his desire for Meera known.
4) Next episode: Gorman comes in their hut in the mids of night. Accompanying him is one of the scared daughter of Craster's. Gorman tries to rape Meera. Bran uses the Hodor force to kill him. Craster's daughter is frightened by Hodor, but Bran calms him down and they leave her be while they get out.
5) Bran frees Summer and they walk by the hut. They see a dead guard on the ground. Craster's women bar the exits and then they set fire to the place. You see Bran and company walking away and then it slowly fades to black with the sounds of screams and a roaring fire in the background.

4018	sj4iy	2014-06-13	That's "Karl Fookin' Tanner, Legend of Fookin' Fleabottom!" to you, Mister 


Â 
Exactly. Â He is no longer a mere mortal, he is a fooking legend and must be accorded all titles as such.

Yes.Â  Chuck Norris nor Randyl Tarly have anything on Karl Fookin' Tanner!Â  I would have given a great deal to hear Karl Fookin' Tanner say something along the lines of "Winter's Fookin' Comin'!" or "Fook!Â  It's cold up here!Â  I think Winter's Fookin' Comin'!"Â  That would have been even more awesome than Karl Fookin' Tanner already was

I will answer better later, but I felt I should at least give you an acknowledgement for now, I appreciate the time and typing and effort you took to answer me.
Â 
As a female, I can assure that women are interested in such things.Â  I can honestly say that watching a good break down of Hannibal's double envelopment at Cannae does things to me, sexually, LOLÂ  Then again, it could also be in relation to a certain documentary actor, my love of history and the battles that go with them, and well.......appreciation of the battle and Hannibal being described correctly.Â  I actually do critique documentaries on such things, LOLÂ  So, yes, women can and do have interest in these type of things, I had just been curious if the combo of battle accuracy and technical film workings was more of a male thing.Â 
Â 
Funny that you mention how Rob Roy came out around the time of Braveheart, I do believe that is why I didn't see the film at the time.Â  I remember thinking that as much as I love Liam Neeson that I should probably wait til later to see that film......having done Scotland and history and BATTLE already that year.Â  It is strange that now nothing ruins an old Mel Gibson movie like the fact of......trying to get past the fact it IS Mel Gibson in it.Â  Ughhhhhhhhh.Â 
Â 
I would answer better but the hubs is home today, and I'm trying to convince him that I don't spend all of my time on the computer, HA!!Â  Having been a cold war warrior in the Navy for 8 years, he has visited Scotland a few times, and I am now selling him on how we have to watch Rob Roy.Â  His interest in naval history had us rewatching Master and Commander this morning.Â Â  I think I'm going to try and sell him on us viewing Rob Roy sometime this weekend.Â  I love the hell out of shifty Tim Roth as much as towering, heroic, badass Liam Neeson.Â  One of my favorite movies of his is Michael Collins, loved the hell out that movie.Â  I always would seem to find MC on in the middle of the night, and YES, stay up til the wee hours of the morning watching it.
Â 
Appreciated all the answers, and will answer better later.Â  Hubs and Rob Roy might both be calling to me soon.Â  Â

The term 'Unsullied' on this site means 'unspoiled' or non-book-readers: people who haven't read the book for one reason or another.Â  Some of my friends don't read unfinished stories, so they are waiting until the series of novels is done before reading.Â  Others haven't the time, and one is dyslexic, making reading a story the length of ASoIaF intimidating.

Haha thanks, I figured it was something along those lines just couldnt find a place to confirm
4027	Kungsmurfen	2014-06-13	I enjoyed it but I think that the assaut from outside the Wall and the assault of Ygrittes group should have been in different episodes. That way we could have three episodes of the season that focused alot on major events at the Wall and we wouldn't get stuck with Stannis arrival at the Wall in the last episode. Imo that could have worked great in the same episode as Viper vs Mountain and that could have been the episode 9.
Â 
I'm also a bit annoyed that we haven't got much buildup for Bran which could have worked great in a Wall-based episode but I guess it's alright.
Â 
I thought Grenn and Pyp's death's were great but the scythe-thingy annoyed me. I also wanted more of a view of the huge wildling army but it's a tv-show so I can forgive them for that. Overall I don't have much to complain about in this episode!

For some reason I find that his movies haven't aged very well. In part that has to do with his private exploits, but there's something more I think. Perhaps the fact that all his movie always aim for the lowest common denominator has something to do with it?
Â 
It's a shame really that Braveheart took the spotlight that year, Rob Roy is a real masterpiece in it's genre imo. And it's still very relevant imo. The fight choreography has sadly never been surpassed.

4029	JonInVa	2014-06-13	Since folks are still nitpicking (without repercussions? Yeah, right), I'll add a few more minor ones:
1. Scythe coming out of frozen wall means it's been there a long time. How would NW know the length, or judge perfectly on a 700 foot wall that they'd be right on the money with the swing? When you haul it back up, how do you get it back to it's holding spot and reset when the apex of the chain is in the center of the swing radius?
2. No mention of Slynt's hiding from Sam to Jon.
3. Sam was literally covered in Pyp's blood, but his clothes were spotless at the end. Must have a laundromat with same hour service.
4. Every person shot with an arrow (in the body, not Pyp) seems to drop like a stone and die instantly - except Ygritte, who had time to wonder, and speak before drifting off.
5. Why does NW rely on people to hold the rope letting their comrades hang over the side of the wall? Not only does it waste a man who could be fighting, but one slip or injury and there goes the rope along with the brother hanging out there. Tie the rope off! Doy.

1. Just as a thought about the scythe, it wouldn't matter if they were spot on with it or not- the ice and snow from the breakage would knock anyone underneath it off.
Â 
2. I think that Slynt's cowardice will still come into play...thinking we might see it as a reason for Sam to blackmail Slynt into dropping out of the choosing for LC.

Why use that scythe though? If they can knock it free from the icy wall, they can just as easily break a part of the Wall of and drop it on the wildlings. Without wasting precious material on the Scythe, not to mention men to haul it back up and re-install it (+ I'm pretty sure that the whole idea of that scythe is bullshit from a physics standpoint as well.)

Tormund is a boss fighter though, so he doesn't really count. Why didn't we see anyone getting shot, who was just wounded instead of instantly dieing?

I think the chain part of the sythe is equally as effective as the blade and the debris - so overall it's a devastating weapon.

I had the honor to talk to GRRM, his wife, and friend/agent/not sure last year at ConQuest outside the hotel and it was really awesome. Â But even more interesting was the question that I asked during his Q&A session. Â I said, "What do you think of the change from Jeyne Westerling to Talisa?" Â he ended up saying that D&D must have thought that "their character was better." Â It didn't sound complimentary or welcoming at all to the changes and I loved hearing that. Â
4036	roxWolfox	2014-06-13	Quite honestly, I don't think someone with Jeyne Westerlings temperment/character would have had any screen presence.Â  I found her to be a wallflower in the books by the description her, and we already had a 'weak' character in Sansa.Â  Feisty Talisa worked well with Robb, and Oona Chaplin has great acting lineage/cred.
Just my take on the whole thing.
Â 
Â 
Eta:Â  Concerning the Talisa Maegyr family ties thing (Essos nobility) ... wasn't Maggy (as in Maggy the Frog) a shortened form of Maegyr?Â  I could be wrong, but that stood out for me when she chatted about her childhood for some reason.

Just checked the wiki, and it says that Maggy is likely a bastardized version of Maegi.Â

Yeah, I'm going to call bullshit on that. Firstly, the ice would be way more costefficient. Secondly, if it's such an effective weapon, why aren't there any real life examples of Medieval fortifications using something like this (smaller scale of course) to defend its walls with.
Â 
Â 


Â Just falling down doesn't constitute dying.


And yet I didn't see any one of those hit by arrows going down and groan or move back up again. If I don't see anyone get wounded, but they all slump down on the floor, stop making sounds or movement, than they are dead. [And I'm ignoring the massive amount of people who would get hit by arrows, but fight on because the arrow just sticks in their arrow or wounds a non-vital part]

Jeyne didn't need much personality, as Robb basically just had sex with her and felt he had to marry her. Of course he's written shallow characters. Not every character can or should be fleshed out. We see what happens when minor characters have pages dedicated to them (AFfC, anyone?).Â

Now, I'm not a girl anymore, but after listening to some gals chatting rather descriptively about of what they'd do to Robb Stark given the chance, I'm beginning to think Talisa/Robb fun-time scenes were put in with the young 'uns something to fantasize about.Â  (This does sound better in my head, believe me).
What I'm trying to get at is that the way Jeyne is in the books, any passionate scene would have been weird.Â  Talisa on the other hand, is passionate, making their sex scenes more believable.Â  Hope that makes sense.Â

Â 
He has over 2000 characters that are in the story or mentioned in the story. Â A majority of them are going to have to be shallow. Â The show can't afford to do that, though, so that's why I didn't mind the love story between Robb and Talisa.
4046	7th-key	2014-06-13	^ It's sad that they fanfictioned* Talisa for passionate scenes, while later rape-alize Jaime/Cersei and don't show Dany/Daario at all...

4047	JonInVa	2014-06-13	The way they've portrayed Ser Alliser in the show compared to the books, I think they might have gotten away with Jon asking him why he hates him when they had their honest conversation at the top of the wall, with impending death coming their way. Would have been interesting to me. Might have been cool to have Ser tell him he treats them all generally the same as shit, but Jon worse because he actually expects the most out of him as one of the few with the blood, brains, and temperament to be a leader. Another type of "forging", in other words. Would that be out of character and wreck the whole dynamic?
Also, I wonder if they'll forgo the whole Slynt's disobeying thing and use his cowardice as the excuse to have Jon give him the Stark justice bit. Just realized that with Jon's justice, all the grown Starks, and Theon, from Ned down, will have administered one each.

Yeah, that's true isn't it? Even though it was Tywin who gave him the wall or death choice, it makes sense he'd hate anyone on Roberts side of the rebellion. Thanks for reminding me.
4051	roxWolfox	2014-06-13	^ It's sad that they fanfictioned* Talisa for passionate scenes, while later rape-alize Jaime/Cersei and don't show Dany/Daario at all...
Â 
*nope, the show's own scenes are not fanfiction, except when they're so bad that they actually could be.



Â 


The way they've portrayed Ser Alliser in the show compared to the books, I think they might have gotten away with Jon asking him why he hates him when they had their honest conversation at the top of the wall, with impending death coming their way. Would have been interesting to me. Might have been cool to have Ser tell him he treats them all generally the same as shit, but Jon worse because he actually expects the most out of him as one of the few with the blood, brains, and temperament to be a leader. Another type of "forging", in other words. Would that be out of character and wreck the whole dynamic?Also, I wonder if they'll forgo the whole Slynt's disobeying thing and use his cowardice as the excuse to have Jon give him the Stark justice bit. Just realized that with Jon's justice, all the grown Starks, and Theon, from Ned down, will have administered one each.


I hadn't even considered Slynt's demise being because of cowardice.Â  Huh.
Yep, Robb and Jon do what they can to carry on Ned's justice!Â Â 
Â 


More importantly, shouldn't her family in Volantis, presumably with some power as they are noble, be fucking pissed that she was killed with her unborn child? Is this a show Chekov's gun or another error?


Reading this it just hit me.Â  Not only did they kill her, but little Ned too!Â 
That deserves 2 Faceless Men!
Damn Freys.Â
4052	ground_control	2014-06-13	Jeyne didn't need much personality, as Robb basically just had sex with her and felt he had to marry her. Of course he's written shallow characters. Not every character can or should be fleshed out. We see what happens when minor characters have pages dedicated to them (AFfC, anyone?).Â 
Â 
ETA: they only added more of a personality to Talisa because they CLEARLY thought the whole "forbidden romance between two characters with zero chemistry" angle was better. You can't really sell that with the amount of characterization Jeyne gets. But again, they serve two different purposes so it makes sense.Â 


The problem isn't that they gave Talisa "more personality" than Jeyne, it's that they made a "forbidden romance" book Robb wouldn't touch with Walder Frey's dick. Â The book description is pretty weak (mainly since we don't see it on-page, we get the Robb-talking-to-his-mother-censored version), but basically, Robb sleeps with Jeyne when he's wounded (i.e., closer to death than he's ever been) and he hears that his two true brothers are dead -- his sisters are Lannister captives, leaving him with a bastard brother who can't inherit and some cousins in the Vale he's never met (and notice that, in the books, he legitimizes Jon even though he's hoping to father children with Jeyne specifically because he doesn't want the unknown cousins as his heirs). Â And then he marries her, because if he doesn't, even if he did get her with child, that child couldn't inherit any more than Jon could. Â Technically, he could legitimize any bastard, but he'd have to live long enough for the child to be born, and that would still piss off the Freys.
Â 
Show Robb just falls in "twu wuv" and says "Fuck it" to his given word.
Â 
The show fucked Robb harder than Jeyne did in the books.

It also makes it clear why Ser Alliser is so happy when Ned gets declared to be a traitor and he gets to call Jon a "traitor's bastard." Â Alliser got sent to the Wall for defending the establishment against rebels, so when one of the rebels gets accused of betraying one of his fellow rebels, and Alliser has that accused traitor's son under his command...yeah, LC Mormont should probably have taken stronger precautions than just telling *Jon* not to do something stupid.

That would be better and more in line with the sympathetic Alliser they created in season one. But they seem to be intent on making Alliser into their version of Marsh, so they couldn't have him mentoring Jon in any way.
Â 


Also, I wonder if they'll forgo the whole Slynt's disobeying thing and use his cowardice as the excuse to have Jon give him the Stark justice bit. Just realized that with Jon's justice, all the grown Starks, and Theon, from Ned down, will have administered one each.


I think disobeying will still be the reason for the execution. They just made him a coward to make him even more despicable and to be able to exclude him from the LC election (no need for a long scene to be wasted on that now). I think that was a smart move to do really, although I think it would have been better if they had just implied his cowardice instead of letting him hide with Gilly (which didn't feel very Slynt to me). That way they could eliminate yet another pointless Gilly scene as an added bonus.
Â 
Â 


More importantly, shouldn't her family in Volantis, presumably with some power as they are noble, be fucking pissed that she was killed with her unborn child? Is this a show Chekov's gun or another error?


If they don't tie the Talisa storyline to Dany and Tyrion's storyline, I'll be fucking pissed. They should just merge Talisa's (grand)mother with the widow of the waterfront. That's the only way they can rectify part of that Talisa mess.
Â

Agreed. Reading your post a much more interesting possibility occurse to me. If they let Robb take a wound and have Talissa take care of him, they could make Talissa into a femme fatale/golddigger who wants to be Queen. That's a kind of character we haven't really seen in the show, nor in the books (well, Daario doesn't count because he's ridiculous). They could keep the Volantis angle (if they bring that back in Tyrion's storyline), without the gaping plotholes and the sappy backstory she had on the show (really, no guards at all? And of course you're against slavery). It would probably be cheaper to, since they wouldn't need to shoot on location (just a room and a wounded Robb).Â 
Â 
EDIT: And just think of what they could do in season 3 with the Cat and Talissa scenes. Cat wouldn't look as dumb as she did in the show and they could have some real interesting convo's.

4061	protar	2014-06-14	Quite honestly, I don't think someone with Jeyne Westerlings temperment/character would have had any screen presence.Â  I found her to be a wallflower in the books by the description her, and we already had a 'weak' character in Sansa.Â  Feisty Talisa worked well with Robb, and Oona Chaplin has great acting lineage/cred.
Just my take on the whole thing.
Â 
Â 
Eta:Â  Concerning the Talisa Maegyr family ties thing (Essos nobility) ... wasn't Maggy (as in Maggy the Frog) a shortened form of Maegyr?Â  I could be wrong, but that stood out for me when she chatted about her childhood for some reason.
Â 
Just checked the wiki, and it says that Maggy is likely a bastardized version of Maegi.Â  


Â 
They could easily have fleshed Jeyne out to create a likeable character who was sweet and meek. Not every female character needs to be a feisty, backtalking badass you know. In fact it's one of my big complaints about the show. D+D must have an obsession with badass women. They change quieter female characters into more "feisty" versions, give more screen time to the already badass women, and if they can't change a female character to be more in line with what they like they just ignore them.Â

Â 
Just another of the many loose ends. Â There is no way they're going to introduce an entire made up Volantis sub plot about "Talisa". Â All of their made up sub plots end where the book plots end. Â So, unless Volantis for some reason ends up involved in helping the Northern lords in the books, which seems impossible, then I'd say "no"

Â 


If D&D don't tie it in then her character is completely useless.Â 
Â 
In the books Volantis will end up supporting Dany, because of the result of the battle of fire and the slave revolt. Now, that would be hugely expensive to show and take up more time (If we onky get seven or eight seasons, we'll have to pick our battles to show. And I think that the Dance of Dragons 2.0. would also need a battle) than they can spare (especially since they'd cram useless filler into it).
Â 
So, the best thing for the show would be to merge the widow of the waterfront with Talisa's mother. Because the Lannisters killed her daughter, she wants vengeance against them and therefore she choses to support Daenerys. They could make her into the power behind the Volantinian government.
Â 
This would have some advantages:
Â 
1) You can cut the naval battle from the battle of fire. In fact you can probably skip the whole thing all together. Let the characters think that they're coming to fight them and then the Volantinians offer their support to Dany to avenge Talissa. That would save them a huge amount of money.
2) Another strong female character could be added
3) Talissa makes sense.
Â 
EDIT: They don't even have to cut the whole "freeing the slaves plotline". They can just have the widow explain that the loss of her daughter let her see the light and that she will free the slaves if Daenerys promises to avenge her daughter.

4066	Fat Trell	2014-06-14	Â 
The Wire depicts, rather brilliantly, whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong with the institutions of today: that they are constantly used for the benefits of a few, while interests of the public are almost completely disregarded, even though institutions are meant to serve the public first and foremost. That theme is the main one in the show and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s analyzed through five seasons, with multitude of angles covered â<U+0080><U+0093> but mostly, perhaps exclusively even, from the perspective of the so-called middle management. We never see whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s at the very top of the food chain. In ASOIAF, we do. Institutions, even those most powerful and therefore most distant, are just humans, even at the very top. Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s always some Tywin, or Aerys, or Drogo, or Doran, or whoever, pulling the strings. Their fears and frustrations and secrets are also depicted and calculated in. The closest thing we get in The Wire in that regard are The Greek and Avon and Marlo. Hypothetically, if they were somehow created by GRRM, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>d probably know their entire family trees, their childhood secrets, their sexual prerogatives, and so on.
Â 
Hope you realize Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not criticizing The Wire. They chose their theme and explored it thoroughly. But, as David Simon said, in the universe of The Wire institutions are like gods in Greek tragedies: entities that are above influence. And for the middle management, which was the focus of the show, it is true. But for the main players it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t. And ASOIAF does bring their perspective, too. And we often see them in dramatic circumstances, when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re facing tough choices, and where their weaknesses, as well as their strengths, are at full display.
Â 
Also, the perspective of the common people is somewhat in the back in The Wire. There are Sobotkas in season two, and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Cutty, and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s it, as far as I can remember. Basically, the question why do we obey institutions in the first place if we all know how corrupted they are, is never asked. In ASOIAF it is. Not only asked theoretically (Varysâ<U+0080><U+0099> riddle), but there are also practical examples of people accepting institutions for the first time in their lives (wildlings in ADWD, freed slaves from Slaverâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Bay), and we also have institutions that went through significant changes and are therefore forced to fight for legitimacy in the eyes of the public/their subjects (Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Rebellion as a crucial event from the past that is frequently visited through various recollections, and each of the Five Kings in the present). And Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d say individuals like Barristan also belong in this category.
Â 
Thanks to its scope and scale, ASOIAF deals with various forms of institutions, some of which are missing from The Wire: family as the basic institution of any society (in The Wire, we get a closer look only at the Barksdales), state governments, religious authorities, military orders, even financial superpowers a la Iron Bank. There are some institutions present in The Wire that are missing from ASOIAF â<U+0080><U+0093> education and the media â<U+0080><U+0093> but I guess they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fit well into a medieval-like world.
Â 
Because of all that, ASOIAF probably has a wider appeal. The Wire depicts very specific institutions in a very specific era: modern urban environments, as Herc says. Of course it resonates with me, because I live in a city. (One more testament to the brilliance of The Wire: Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a journalist, and I met quite a few politicians and other public officers in my career â<U+0080><U+0093> and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re perfect images of Carceti and Rawls and Clay Davis and Valchek; not to mention the media themselves, which are depicted extremely faithfully.) But, people from small towns or villages or other not so urban areas donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to feel the same connection I do. And, from my experience, they rarely do. Not that they dislike the show. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s written masterfully and easy to like, even if it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t resonate with oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s life too much. But ASOIAF, similar to The Sopranos for example, deals with things like families, which practically everyone can relate to.
Â 
One more thing. In ASOIAF, we see some institutions being challenged to their very limits (NW most of all). Speaking from a country that had more than its fair share of political and social disturbances in my lifetime, I find that perspective brilliantly explored in ASOIAF.
Â 
Once more, I adore and greatly respect The Wire. I just love and respect ASOIAF even more, and its take on institutions is one of the reasons why.

I have to disagree.
In ASOIAF we study people. We see how their actions effect others. We don't see how their actions are carried out in great detail. We don't study institutions in depth. We view them in relation to individuals. Whereas in The Wire almost every character is defined by their relationship to their institution, they are their role.
While we don't see the President or anyone who is actually at the top of the food chain in The Wire, for the setting, we definetly see the top dogs. We meet and explore the Police Commisioner, the Mayor, the Union head, the top westside and eastside drug dealers. While middle management in the grand scheme, they're hardly so in the setting.  
While we might meet a wider range of institutions in ASOIAF, do we study any of them as closely as we do drug-dealing organizations or the police in The Wire? What do we actually know about how the Iron Bank functions?
We absolutely see institutions being pushed to their edge on The Wire. The Hamsterdam and the New Day Co-op plots were entirely about individuals(Colvin and Bell, respectivally) trying to change institutions from within.
I absolutely love both series as well, I just don't find them comparable in the slightest. The Wire is a very much a narrative driven story with enthralling characters; ASOIAF is a character driven story with an enthralling narrative. For example; David Simon stated that despite Stringer Bell being an incredibly popular character, he had to die because to let him live would have served character, not story. GRRM himself has stated(iirc) that his characters drive his plot. Many here actually(wrongly imo) complain that Martin has lost control of the plot because of how he favors character over story.

4068	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-14	Oh, I enjoy watching docs and drama when at home, but my theatre interests are pretty simple.Â  "Gah!Â  Did you see that tiger in the trailer?Â  MUST GO SEE MOVIE!"Â  orÂ  "Look, look, look!Â  A WOLF/DRAGON/DINOSAUR!Â  RAWR!"Â  or "GARY OLDMAN/KARL URBAN! MARK IT ON THE CALENDER!"Â  See a pattern here?Â Â  xDÂ Â  Hubs is much more discerning in his movie watching, to be honest.Â  
Â 
Â 
100,000 brains cells just keeled over when I considered (for a fleeting moment) the amount of alcohol I'd have to buy were we to do a 'shot per nipple' rewatch of 300.Â  I'm feeling rather light-headed right now .... I'm hoping I didn't frighten them to death with the mere thought. Â  
Â 
As to the battle/duel discussion.Â  I'm of two minds about the 'realism' necessary for me to be entertained.Â  I've never fought in a war, or trained for one, so I can't judge on the reality of the experience.Â  I was raised by a military family, who have generations of wartime vets, so I have heard the stories ... but the ones who refused to ever speak of their experience on the battlefields were the ones who impressed me the most.Â  That maybe why I have no interest in watchingÂ  a realistic battle.Â  Over-the-top, action-packed, CGI battles though?Â  No prob!Â 
And simply because we are discussing a fantasy series here, I couldn't help but think of Morrowind when reading your words concerning Jon's skill. I started off the game getting slaughtered by caterpillar-worms and rats, and by the end of the game I was taking down Gods (3 of them, dammit!Â  Woot!).Â  Nothing realistic at all about those battles, but they were f'ing fun!Â  Who's to say Jon won't be a God-killer by the end of the story?
But, then again, I'm a gal who spends most of her days making sure our cat and cockatiel don't kill each other.Â  Those are the only realistic battles I do get to watch.Â  
Â 
Â 
Rob Roy!Â  I looked for a version of that movie for years wanting to see what the fuss was about ... hubs is a big fan of his, as well.Â 
Â 
I didn't notice the cook and that cleaver until my second watch, and boy was I scared.Â  That guy was terrifying!Â  Either that or my Dark Souls nightmares came back to haunt me the moment I saw the goddamn size of that goddamn cleaver!Â  
Â 
Â 
**edited for clarification now that 100,000 brains cells have been resuscitated and are back on duty.


Â 
You've reminded me that the hubs and I need to get serious with reinstitutioning movie date night. Â I miss that, drinks and/or dinner before, the talks afterwards. Â I will be keeping my eye out for movie ads now, and not.......waiting for dvd, netflix or hulu, and cable. Â Woo me, hubby, woo me, dammit!! Â  
Â 
Myself, I don't mind a little 'Hollywood' in battle scenes, but it does go a bit overboard sometimes. Â Like the shiny, super modern scythe, why IS it a scythe, by the way.......when I first saw it, I thought: Â They've attached an ANCHOR to The Wall, LOL Â But, it seems as if GOT tries to claim 'realism' while they do the "Hollywood Boss Thing" anyway. Â I am grateful there wasn't an awful man cut in half scene like the Blackwater, though. Â Some of the effects aren't as good as they think. Â That's like Oberyn and his mashed head and face, looks like The Mountain is mangling a Planet of The Apes Mask to me? Â  
Â 
I definitely have 300 and Rob Roy on my serious list now, though. Â

Getting close to what I predict is the most epic nitpick thread of the entire series. Â D&D say its' their best episode/ending yet, which almost guarantees it will be chock full of insanity. Â Okay that was mean. Â But, Brienne and the Mountain, that alone deserves serious condemnation unless they're totally trolling us in the previews. Â Stannis is sure to be demeaned somehow, LMAO. Â And if we get another glimpse of Sansa Jolie....
Â 
I am going to be interested in how the TV only people take Dany chaining up her dragons, I fucking hated her for that, that may have even been my point of no return w/her.

Â 
It's not that the actor for XXD bothered me, it was his damn repetitive dialogue, LOL
Â 
And speaking of an epic nitpick thread, I just told my daughter how it now does seem just about certain that they will have Brienne and The Hound fight, she looks at me at goes................why and WTF? Â I explained to her how it seems it may be a misunderstanding between them, he'll see Lannister cronies (specially with Pod there, IMO) and therefore.......all hell will break lose. Â She's much easier going than I am about some stuff (she rolls her eyes at my beetle complaints) but she looks none too pleased. Â Haha, maybe I can finally get her to post some nitpicks herself, instead of her doing so vicariously through me. Â 
Â 
ETA: Â The Hound and Brienne came up for us here at home by watching the behind the scenes fighting clip for this season and I noticed them applying blood to Sandor....out in the hill country, so I'm thinking it's for scenes we haven't seen. Â

4073	roxWolfox	2014-06-14	where the fuck is Stannis ??!?!? show is ruining everything. For this part is the best of ASOIAF. Show viewers have no clue what's coming. I pity them.


Much like me when I first read the books.Â  I'll admit I had absolutely no interest in Stannis (loved Davos though) until he came through at the Wall.Â  I quite enjoy his character now.Â 
Â 

If they don't tie the Talisa storyline to Dany and Tyrion's storyline, I'll be fucking pissed. They should just merge Talisa's (grand)mother with the widow of the waterfront. That's the only way they can rectify part of that Talisa mess.
Â 
They could keep the Volantis angle (if they bring that back in Tyrion's storyline) scenes. Cat wouldn't look as dumb as she did in the show and they could have some real interesting convo's.


What a brilliant idea!Â  
Â 


Â 
Just another of the many loose ends. Â There is no way they're going to introduce an entire made up Volantis sub plot about "Talisa". Â All of their made up sub plots end where the book plots end. Â So, unless Volantis for some reason ends up involved in helping the Northern lords in the books, which seems impossible, then I'd say "no"
Â 


If they could make the 'Avenge Talisa!' story tie in with either the Faceless Men or Dany, I'd be intrigued.Â  Since we have no idea where they're going with that, I can't outright condemn the Robb/Talisa storyline.Â  
Â 

I am going to be interested in how the TV only people take Dany chaining up her dragons, I fucking hated her for that, that may have even been my point of no return w/her.


I agree that chaining up the dragons was the beginning of the end for my support of Dany, so I'll be looking forward to the audience's reaction.Â  
Â 
Â 
Oh, and Lady Fevre Dream.Â  300 was one of the movies I dragged hubs to see 'cause it had a wolf!Â  A WOLF!Â  He almost didn't go, and kept reminding me that the last time I dragged him to the movies (against his will) was to see 10,000 B.C.Â  'cause it had a dozen fricking saber-tooth tigers!Â  in the trailer.
Man, I've never been able to live that one down.Â

Â 
I have. Â Many people get head injuries, like concussions or bleeding on the brain, where noticeable symptons don't show up immediately. Â It can take minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or even years for them to show up...if they do at all. Â Many people aren't even knocked out for more than a split second.
Â 
I had something cause a head injury with me which damaged my pituitary gland. Â I don't have any clue at all what could have done it. Â I don't remember any sort of real head trauma. Â I just started having symptoms over many months, until I was finally diagnosed and received proper treatment.
Â 
On the other hand, this is a fictional story where many of the main characters have survived something nearly unsurvivable at least once. Â I don't see why this should be a huge amount of focus when it's happened a lot, even in the books.

Well, in the books, Arya was lights out from being hit over the head with the flat of an axe blade...she probably should have had more head trauma from that, but it's a convenient trope in fiction to 'knock out' someone by hitting them on the head, but then they wake up a while later with no repercussions or lasting damage.

Yeah, I don't think GRRM is preventing anything. Â He's said numerous times that he has no creative control over the series at all. Â If he wanted to kill off Pyp and Grenn, they'd be dead.
4085	jarl the climber	2014-06-14	Since folks are still nitpicking (without repercussions? Yeah, right), I'll add a few more minor ones:
1. Scythe coming out of frozen wall means it's been there a long time. How would NW know the length, or judge perfectly on a 700 foot wall that they'd be right on the money with the swing? When you haul it back up, how do you get it back to it's holding spot and reset when the apex of the chain is in the center of the swing radius?
2. No mention of Slynt's hiding from Sam to Jon.
3. Sam was literally covered in Pyp's blood, but his clothes were spotless at the end. Must have a laundromat with same hour service.
4. Every person shot with an arrow (in the body, not Pyp) seems to drop like a stone and die instantly - except Ygritte, who had time to wonder, and speak before drifting off.
5. Why does NW rely on people to hold the rope letting their comrades hang over the side of the wall? Not only does it waste a man who could be fighting, but one slip or injury and there goes the rope along with the brother hanging out there. Tie the rope off! Doy.

1. The scythe was great, there is no bad mouthing of the scythe even if its logical and makes sense.
Â 
2. Nobody saw Slynt do anything during the battle, there are like 50-60 guys left alive and none of them saw Slynt do anything, thats something that should get around. There were no secrets at the Wall in the books. This isn't the books but if doesn't I have to agree that it won't make much sense.
Â 
3. It was dark the red mixes in with the black once it dries plus Sams a slob who gets gravy and juices all over the front whenever he eats, so it kind of blended in.
Â 
4. Some of these guys were cowards and cravens and they figured once they got shot it was a good excuse to lay down and play possum.Â 
Â 
5. Because the Watch has to take whatever they can get in terms of manpower, some of the guys they have, thats all they can do, they can hold a rope, tying a knot is a little to tricky for them. The question is why the bowmen they were holding didn't pick off all the climbers, they shot one arrow apiece and then they just stayed there and didn't do anything, they didn't even ask to get pulled back up. So I think that the recruits they have been getting have been of really limited value.Â

GRRM isn't preventing anything anymore. Direct me to the thread where I can commiserate with people who realize one of our favorite authors has given us .70% of the story and is ok with that.


Â 
Â 


Â

Â 
We know that GRRM hasn't been in control since the very first episode. In season one D&D killed off Marillion and Rakharo. We've also seen that every episode GRRM has written has had scenes cut from it so more of D&D's scenes can be added. Now we are at the point where D&D are writing, producing, and directing almost every episode. When they have zero talent as writers. David "amnesia bullets" Benioff was responsible for Wolverine: Origins. So the show has noticably declined in its writing quality and consistency.
Â 
The show borders on fan fiction at this point. Pointlessly changing characters' names and ethnicities (Talisa? Yara? Salladhor and Xaro Xhoan Daxos being black?). Introducing multiple romantic subplots with no consequence (Tyrio and Shae? Grey Worm and Missandei?). Bombarding the viewer with time consuming sex scenes to fill the nudity quota at expense of character and plot depth (Loras, Renly, Ros, Melisandre, Ros, Pycelle, Ros, Theon). Comically absurd action sequences (man falls 700 feet from top of wall after being shot with a giant's arrow.....and his body lands PERFECTLY in the ground with no splat). Meandering plots (Bran at Crasters? Melisandre and Gendry? Talisa? Jaime raping Cersei? WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?!!?!). Five dollar budget battle sequences (Tyrion gets hit in the head with a hammer, Here's some sounds on a black screen as The Others battle The Watch). Unbelievably awful dialog (Littlefinger's soliloquy of his life to Ros, Tyrion's ridiculous dung beetle speech). Advanced knowledge spoilers (Joffrey sent Ser Mandon, The Night's King, Dany in a frozen King's Landing). Why are they spoiling information from books six and seven?
Â 
I don't see how this show qualifies as a straight adaption at all.
Â 
It's more of a reboot. This is how Hollywood reboots their comic franchises. They take the basic premise of the previous franchise and then add in lots of sex appeal and keep the cast young and good looking. Every decade Spiderman gets younger and younger. The plot gets simpler and less complicated. They make the plot as easy as possible to understand. You can read ASOIAF dozens of times and miss many small details. You'd be hard-pressed to miss the main purpose of each episode of the show. This show is almost as if it is based on a rebooted version of the books. And not the original source material.
Â 
I think GRRM was overwhelmed. He saw HBO making shows like Band of Brothers and The Sopranos and was suckered into thinking that his show would be taken seriously. Instead he's getting the same treatment that shows like Rome and Deadwood got. But instead of beign disrespected by being canceled they just churn out subpar seasons and go in with enormous marketing campaigns. Ensuring huge viewership but a decline in artistic quality. The show is nothing more than a cash cow and a development vehicle for HBO executives and their friends. Work on Game of Thrones and you might parlay that into being the head writer for the Magic the Gathering Movie. The show is a plaything for powerful televison executives.
Â 
At this point there's nothing that GRRM can do but either lie about or downplay his disappointment in the direction of the show. I would estimate he's happy at seeing his characters mostly faithfully portrayed on a screen with live actors, sets, and costumes. But I can't possibly fathom how he would be at all impressed with the writing and narrative of the show. If people are cringing at D&D's horrid dialog I can't imagine what GRRM feels when a character utters such uninspired streams of verbal mediocrity. When the show is at the point where he has to make excuses to comment on storytelling failures like Jaime raping Cersei then the show ceases to be an adaptation and is something much different. But GRRM can't say "the rape change bothered me so I felt it was necessary to comment on it". He needs the convenient reason of "the fans kept asking so I felt compelled to answer, to move on from the subject".
Â 
If HBO were less money hungry they'd take the show off air for one year and let GRRM and D&D regroup. The Wire and The Sopranos, far superior shows, took years off. Mad Men just came back from a year off AND split its last season. They need to take a breather and reasses what the true purpsoe of this show really is. Is it a serious artistic piece or a rushed year-to-year adaptation to sell cable boxes?
4088	Justin Danford	2014-06-15	Bad pacing.
The series should have introduced the Wall under Mances siege as early as episode 6 or 7. Instead of the Sam and Ygritte Molestown run-around or Greyworm Fanfic, we should have been checking in on a battered Nights Watch, facing waves of Mances attack.
We could have gotten "The wall is yours, Lord Snow," a more sustained (and thus believable) growth as Jon as a commander (seemed to me Thorne was one heroic dude in Ep.9), and a more meaningful Ep.9
Imagine if Ep.9 began on the premise of the NW down on their last straw, tired and nearly beaten...and then Mance full presses from the North while Tormund attacks from the South. How much more heroic would Jon/Gren/Sam have been. How much more meaningful? And with all that extra time saved from sam/yrgitte/greyworm the episode can finallly end as it should have:
Jon treats with Mance. Stannis cliffhanger to save the day...
4089	swordswallower	2014-06-15	What I meant was that if Pyp and Grenn we're going to be instrumental in the last two (?) books, GRRM would've tipped D&D off - we know they have insider knowledge on that score. But of course, even if Grenn was going to turn out to be a great hero in WOW, They'll probably switch it to Edd
4090	Miodrag	2014-06-15	In ASOIAF we study people. We see how their actions effect others. We don't see how their actions are carried out in great detail. We don't study institutions in depth. We view them in relation to individuals. Whereas in The Wire almost every character is defined by their relationship to their institution, they are their role.


Â 
This is where I partially disagree. We do study people in ASOIAF, as you say, but it goes further, because majority of those people occupy prominent positions in the society. Their actions have serious consequences for the entire realms. Then there are people who find themselves in dire straits because their loyalty to the order/institution they belong to is challenged. Loyalty is one of the main themes of ASOIAF, and most of the characters are in one way or another forced to choose will they follow what they think is right or what written/unwritten rules command. Jaime's "so many vows" monologue is the essential dilemma every public official is facing at some point: what to honor, yourself or your position? And his choice had consequences not only for himself, but for the entire society as well. And he's still haunted for the choice he made. And we have an opposite example in Barristan, who always chooses an institution over himself, and yet, in ADWD we see his mind was never completely in peace with his decisions. There's also Aemon, and basically the entire Night's Watch, whose loyalty to the institution they serve is continually questioned. And there are institutions like the City Watch that aren't in focus too much, but we still find out great deal about them: in AGOT/ACOK, games played around and the corruption of the City Watch are among the crucial aspects of the fight for power, but the City Watch itself is not a one-dimensional entity; on the contrary, it's purpose and efficiency and rules and internal logic are all depicted.
Â 


While we might meet a wider range of institutions in ASOIAF, do we study any of them as closely as we do drug-dealing organizations or the police in The Wire? What do we actually know about how the Iron Bank functions?


Â 
As much as about people, ASOIAF is about the societies and cultures those people are part of. I don't think it'd be possible any other way. When a writer ignores the importance the culture bears for the characters, it always ends up with abominations like Talisa. In a contemporary drama, the culture and society don't have to be described in details, because we all know what police is or should be, and what the prime minister/secretary of state is or should be. When writing about a fictional world, the writer has to create a realistic, believable culture, and a realistic, believable society that stems from the said culture. Unfortunately, many writers fail to do that properly. GRRM is among the rare exceptions. I'd say he's second to none in that regard. And institutions are an integral part of the societies he created. His institutions are rawer, more primitive then modern ones, but in essence - because of the human aspect - they are not unlike our institutions. On the contrary, they're more similar to modern institutions than not. The City Watch can stand for police. Night's Watch can stand for a military service. Kingsguard can stand for secret service. And all of those institutions, along with various governments and other forms of authority (religions), are seen up-close. There are entities like Iron Bank that are at the outskirts (at least for now), but even in that case we see their reasoning and logic.
Â 


We absolutely see institutions being pushed to their edge on The Wire. The Hamsterdam and the New Day Co-op plots were entirely about individuals(Colvin and Bell, respectivally) trying to change institutions from within.


Â 
Colvin did try to change the way things function, but his attempt didn't endanger the institution of police. Bell is a somewhat different case in that regard, because he tried to create a new institution in New Day Co-op (an unofficial institution, but still), and payed dearly for it. While both plots are brilliant and smartly interwoven, I was talking about the challenge the Night's Watch is facing like all the time - either because of neglect, or because of physical threat, they're fighting for the bare existence. The only institution in The Wire that is challenged in its very core and fighting for the bare existence is the unions in season 2, of which I forgot the last time.
Â 


I absolutely love both series as well, I just don't find them comparable in the slightest. The Wire is a very much a narrative driven story with enthralling characters; ASOIAF is a character driven story with an enthralling narrative. For example; David Simon stated that despite Stringer Bell being an incredibly popular character, he had to die because to let him live would have served character, not story. GRRM himself has stated(iirc) that his characters drive his plot. Many here actually(wrongly imo) complain that Martin has lost control of the plot because of how he favors character over story.


Â 
I think they're very comparable, even though they are vastly different - but, different things can also be compared, especially if their respective foundations are similar, or perhaps identical even. And both ASOIAF and The Wire are brilliant in depicting the culture. Those institutions from The Wire would mean nothing if not for the people that represent them. That's why Simon and co. had to invent so many memorable characters, and they did. Martin also goes well beyond pure characters. Yes, his characters are brilliantly complex, but if the story was only about them, it wouldn't be as good as it is. I know many think ASOIAF is just a character study, but there I there I very much disagree. Characters carry the narrative and readers usually associate closely with them to the point of becoming genuine fans of this character or that one, but there's so much more to this story than just characters. Just look at Drogo and how similar his story is to Bell's: Drogo too wanted to change things in a way that he wanted for his people to do something they've never done before (sailing), but he also wanted to stay the same, to preserve everything Dothraki stand for (war and plundering) - and at the end, he couldn't have it both ways.
Â 
Not you, but many character-obsessed readers do complain about "Martin loosing control of the plot lately", however, I don't think that's the case at all. Just look at Slaver's Bay arc. It's not only about Dany, but also about what it really takes to truly end an oppression. It's about the oppressed and the oppressors, as much as it is about Dany. Looking through those lenses, Slaver's Bay is among the most favorite parts of ASOIAF for me. Jon's ADWD arc is also amazing in that regard, because it's not only about him and his leadership abilities, but also about the people (wildlings) who accepted to lose some liberty in order to gain some security. AFFC is as much about the ancient question of the cost of victory as it is about Jaime and Cersei as characters. I happen to think the first three books are also about bigger ideas and ideals, but, because of the crazy rich plot in those books, it was perhaps harder to notice that. But, after AFFC and especially ADWD, I think it's obvious ASOIAF is much more than a character study it's usually perceived as: it is about the ideas and ideals that hold any society together.
Â 
Martin's characters are as memorable precisely because they're the products of their culture and because they stand for those ideals and ideas (or against them), and they operate through the various institutions the society created. The Wire is about institutions in a modern society, but those institutions are so vivid and realistic precisely because they're represented by well rounded characters and ideals behind the institutions (ideals that are, sadly, so often ignored completely). That's why I find them so comparable, even though they're also vastly different. And here are some character parallels, I'd like to know what you and everyone else who watched and loved The Wire think about it:
Â 
(yeah, SPOILER ALERT: if you didn't watch The Wire, best skip this part)
Â 
Robert = Avon (a king well past his prime, but doesn't know it). Ned = Frank Sobotka (fighting a battle he didn't want and only accepted it for the greater good, but the battle was rigged and he didn't know; too honest for his own good - even though Ned is infinitely more honorable than Frank, what Frank did was not too dishonest, he wasn't OK with those bodies or with heroin). Sandor = Omar (slave to no institution, his own code is the most important thing for him - I guess D&D also found some similarity there, which is why they foolishly borrowed Omar's "a man must have a code" line for Sandor). Tyrion = McNulty (unconventional intelligence too often trapped in a conventional environment, and a lot of explosive results come from it). Theon = Prez (thorn between his family and his other "family"). Ramsay = Marlo (this is self-explanatory, probably).
Â 
Of course, I'm not saying they're identical character, by no means, because they are rich enough to be very different, but there is some similarity that, in a way, hopefully speaks about what I want to convey in this post: that characters in ASOIAF are as important because of the importance they have for the universe they exist in, just like the institutions depicted in The Wire are as vivid because of the characters they're represented through.
Â 
By the way, perhaps it'd be good idea to open a separate thread for this discussion. I mean, this one is probably going to be closed soon.
4091	Blockfetcher	2014-06-15	What annoys me most is how poor the writing has fallen from season 1. People keep saying that the original scenes have the worst writing and the ones straight from the book are the best. But just look at season 1, the scene between tywin and jaime, cersei and robert or season 2 arya and tywin. They have the potential to write really really good original scenes but this season I find myself rolling my eyes at most of the dialogue especially in this episode. It's definitely lost some of its magic maybe because they know how popular the show is now and so they can get away with lower quality writing.Â 
Â 
Not only that, but they mess with conversations in the book that really don't need to be messed with. The last conversation between ygritte and jon was much better in the books and there was no reason why they couldn't have just used the same conversation in the book. It makes no sense!
4092	Mirante	2014-06-15	Hello All
This is my first post... I've been visiting here for a few years but the last episode got me finally signing up! Thanks for all the fascinating, geeky discussions.
I use the audio book of ASOIAF as an insomnia remedy (really) .... not because its boring, but because it does get me out of my head and fast asleep... but I've had ample time to absorb the original material, and I really protest what happened the last episode, lol....So as my first post... sorry to be a hater.. butÂ the tv show Game of Thrones turned such a powerful and intricately designed battle and sequence of events on the wall into mush...Â I don't disagree with all Weiss and Benioff are up to and think generally they're doing a great job! But the book chapters with the Wall battle was extremely taut and powerful, one of the most intense and important sequences before book 4 where IMO GRRM royally looses the plot for 1000 pages.
In the book, its not about Sam, ffs... in the book, Jon is sick and wounded... a real endurance test... hes pouring burning oil down trap doors and firing arrows into the dark with only a young male prostitute to help! After the stairs are destroyed, using strategy to defeat the wildlings (who are not 'cannibal psycho's like they are in the show) , he has his time commandeering the wall,Â stepping into true leadership. Then there are dynamics that push him to negotiate with Mance, on what is a suicide mission, not just some voluntary brainwave that he thinks me may be able to pull off.
In the show... I feel Ygrittes death was handled well... I am fond of the actress and her character, Â but it was in the midst of a battle, rather than at the end. So he spends minutes lamenting whilst the battle rages around him. WTF? Thats an abandonment of his men into self absorbed grief, and a death wish. This is one example ofÂ illogical and poor pacing - Â along with the odd inaction of the Knights Watch whilst the giants are destroying the tunnel gate. And ok this anchor released from the wall was fun, a good special effect, but ludicrous overkill for a few climbers! Was the budget well allocated... hhrrmmfph. Yea I know its ludicrous to complain and I am not a television director.Â 
Some action on the wall was really well done, and I like Alliser Thorne as a point of antagonism... and Tormund is wild. But WHYÂ was more character development given to Sam and Gilly than Jon himself? I mean, I suppose Sam is a point of sympathy, but stretch the character and his preoccupation with Gilly too far, and it becomes really irritating, especially when its replacing really amazing, lean writing from GRRM.
I'm only moaning because I love the material so much and would encourage anyone who likes the show to check out book three as an audio book so they can experience the story arc on the wall as GRRM intended. It also makes me feel, gradually, that this is not the definitive Game of Thrones adaption. Perhaps in a decade or two it will be treated again, interpreted in a different way, and the story arc on the wall, one of the most important, will be honored better.Â
4093	Veltigar	2014-06-15	@VeltigarÂ I bet you rocked those exams......glad I could help you unwind from them. Â I'll never be able to answer well, til after the hubs is out of my hair, and until I stop the self water boarding type torture of reading finale spec., LOL Â I surrender for now, and well......I'm just waiting to see how the finale comes out in the wash. Â I'm sure I'll enjoy some of it, and I'm sure......I'll enjoy nitpicking some of it, too. Â  
Â 
Oh well, let's see if I can actually persuse some of this thread more thoroughly, along with some of the specific replies that I myself received. Â Surely, there is more nitpicking to be enjoyed around here. Â  


I wonder if we'll get passed 50 pages with episode 10's thread  We're close now, but we won't make it 
Â 
Â 


What a brilliant idea!Â

Â

Â 
I'll have you know, I am extremely proud of myself for curtailing my love of babble. Â I could have had this thread up to 50, easy. Â  Â Â 
I do highly suspect that the next thread will be prolific, my daughter is already giving side eye to the notion of Brienne and The Hound even encountering each other, and I'm a 'show hater' compared to her. Â That's just for starters, Brienne and The Hound, but I suspect there will be some serious nitpick potential. Â If she's already willing to admit that something like the two of them encountering and fighting each other is stupid, I doubt 50 and over will be a problem. Â 
Â 
I'm sure by the time next season starts, I'll make peace with more of my nitpicks this past season, but I'll also hit the ceiling even higher on some things, such as all the Oberyn we should have had........talking about Elia and HIS mother (yeah, his dad took them to Casterly Rock, insert eye roll here) and the Lannisters and Rhaegar and marriages. Â But hey, we did see him in bed with almost every whore in THE brothel, so really, why complain? Â  
Â 
I can't wait to see everyone on the other side of this episode. Â I'm sure I'll enjoy lots of it. Â IF LS should show up, I'm curious to see what she will look like. Â Less than 5 hours wait here. Â See ya all soon. Â

I can't post and watch at the same time, I don't like to be distracted when I watch. Â I pop in after the show and/or the next morning.

And I can't watch and twitter/read commentary at the same time either!Â  I'm truly impressed by those who can!
I was so amused at the excited commentary last week until about 9:48 on when the snark started (no Stannis!) then it went all downhill from there.Â 
Reading 80+ pages of angry posts is what I do to amuse myself when hubs is sleeping during the day, or at work in my attempts to keep the bird quiet.Â  Her favourite activity is jumping up and down on the keyboard whilst I type ... which is far easier to deal with than the foghorn screams she emits when the tv/radio is on.Â

I would absolutely adore a thread comparing and contrasting ASOIAF and The Wire as works.
Though I would still contend The Wire is a deeper study of institutions, I admit I hadn't looked at certain characters as representitives of their respective institutions. Your post has made me reevaluate some things.
I really like the Avon-Robert comparison btw. Both very martial men who value strength and are often misread as being stupid. Very patriarchical characters. Being relived to know future enemies, even toddlers, had been killed by others so he would not have to dirty his hands is the exact reaction Avon would have had in Robert's place. 
Comparing Ramsay to Marlo is a bit degrading to Marlo though don't you think? Marlo was a ruthless man who killed for practically any reason but he never struck me as anywhere near the sadist that Ramsay is. Much more of a Tywin imo.
4102	Miodrag	2014-06-16	Comparing Ramsay to Marlo is a bit degrading to Marlo though don't you think? Marlo was a ruthless man who killed for practically any reason but he never struck me as anywhere near the sadist that Ramsay is. Much more of a Tywin imo.


Â 
Yeah, it wasn't precise enough. What I meant is that both Ramsay and Marlo represent a degeneration. Ramsay is obviously Roose writ more sadistic, while in season 3 of The Wire, in which Marlo debuts, the theme of things becoming generally worse is a prominent one. I'd say his war with Avon is also about that. Like, it's a very common point that everything's becoming worse with each new generation, and it's almost always bullshit, but sometimes perhaps it's true.
Â 
About institutions, just to make myself clear: institutions are the main focus in The Wire, while in ASOIAF they're certainly aren't, so you're obviously right that they're dealt with in more details in The Wire than in ASOIAF. Not to mention that modern institutions are more complicated than medieval ones were. So if it looked like I'm denying that, sorry, my bad. But, institutions are an integral part of ASOIAF too, especially for the theme I recognize as the main one of Martin's saga, and that is the role of individualism in a society/culture that depends so much on various forms of collectivism. That is why GRRM had to create societies/cultures that are as believable as they actually are, and institutions, though not the main focus, are an integral parts of those societies. Because of the historical period he modeled his universe on, he had the opportunity to explore societies - and institutions - in their very cores. And in my eyes, he did it brilliantly, because he never lost the basic human perspective, as a lesser writer possibly would. That is why watching The Wire doesn't necessarily helps me with understanding institutions or societies or cultures in ASOIAF, while reading ASOIAF probably may help me - only to a certain extent, of course - in understanding a society in its roots, be it a modern urban society depicted in The Wire, or some other society.

4104	Duckface	2014-06-10	I make a new post because every other one has too much posts and my post will just be lost.
Â 
As many people have asked, I've done the Night's Watch death count.
Â 
How did i count:
1. I've watched every sequence at 50% speed
2. I've watched very closely, event the background stuff
3. If i see a person die or get wounded, then i assume he is dead.
4. If i see a person fall, but i don't see the cuts, i assume he is probably dead.
5. I've counted only what I've seen. I haven't counted Ygritte arrows for example.
Â 
Night's Watch casualties:
43 dead + 8 probably dead. I might have missed some, but not much, max 5 deaths.
Â 
My feelings:
I'm happy that it didn't reach 100. I should say that after a rewatch i'm very grateful to people, who make CGI, direct the scenes, make costumes&sets and music is just awesome (as always, heil Ramin Djawadi).
Now i hate D&D, their writing is just ridiculously stupid. I think they lack education, they lack talent, they don't spend enough time. They could be very good at writing simple stories and you can make a good movie with a simple story, there is no doubt. But if you are not GRRM or i don't know, Martin Scorsese or Wes Anderson, then you shouldn't try to make a scenario out of a book masterpiece (especially if you make changes).
One of the most stupid things is that everyone who is important is a boss, a killing machine, which can be killed only by another boss. The killing spree by Tormund, Styr or Jon Snow is ridicuosly high and don't even get me started with Ygritte. It feels like she is out of this world. She hasn't missed even once! If we would have seen Ygritte shooting arrows for 30 minutes,, then there would be a 1000 dead men.

4105	Perin Stone	2014-06-11	I think I counted 38 "dead". Â I ignored a lot of the background action because I couldn't always tell if the dead was NW or Wildling. Â I also didn't count all of the arrows that Ygritte shot that they didn't show hitting someone. Â Considering every shot of hers they showed was a kill, this would have added another half dozen people easily.
Â 
I don't understand the reason for there only being 100 in the NW instead of 1000 (and 2 other castles) in the books....
4106	Janicia	2014-06-11	Thanks for doing the counts! Â As I watched the episode I was wondering about the numbers. Â Losing a little less than half of the watch's fighting force feels about right. Â
4107	Arya Targaryen	2014-06-11	I don't understand the reason for there only being 100 in the NW instead of 1000 (and 2 other castles) in the books....less than a 1000 is the number Mormont gives to Tyrion, IIRC. THat's altogether the 3 castles, in the beginning.So let's assume CB has 400, Eastwatch and Shadow tower has 300-300Mormont took 300 with him. they practically all died. 200 from CB and 100 from STSo CB had about 200 men, but when MAnce attacked, Bowen took most of them with him. Hardly anyone (less than a 100) stayed at CB, when Jon got back. I think he had about 40 men (and women, kids from Mole's town) after the Thenn attack, and he had to hold the Wall with just them.In the show, if they had 100 in the beginning, at CB, and about 50-60 died, that leaves them with 40-50 men, just like in the books.

Absolutely correct. I also would like to add that in the books Jon Snow imakes watchmen out of straw and puts them on the wall. So Mance thinks there are a 1000 men in Castle Black!
4109	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-06-11	On a rewatch I noticed, that the scene with the giant shooting a black brother from the wall down to castle black with his big arrow must have changed his place in the production. It now takes place, as the skirmish in the courtyard of castle black is at his height, but you can already see a glimpse of the impaled body just before Alliser gives his great speech. So it seems the scene with the giant arrow was rearranged to be later in the episode.
4110	The Mountain That Flies	2014-06-11	Now i hate D&D, their writing is just ridiculously stupid. I think they lack education, they lack talent, they don't spend enough time.

First, anyone doing an adaptation of any story (wehther it's book to screen, book to stage, or stage to screen) is going to neccesitate changes, largely for practical reasons. I certainly don't agree with every change D&D have made or didn't make when they could have improved a storyline. But calling their writing ridiculously stupid seems a bit excessive, especially since their writing was good enough to convince Martin himself to sign over the rights.
Regarding the "bosses" issue, let's take a look at the people you mentioned, shall we?Tormund: Incredibly experienced raider who's climbed the Wall numerous times and is mentioned in both media to be a very skilled fighter. Additionally, he's a large man who seems uncommonly quick and is in very good shape, who was fighting a force made up largely of leftovers and stewards.Styr: Pretty much the same as Tormund, though he obviously changed a lot in adaptation. In the show, he's insanely viscous (givng him a psychological edge), big/strong to wield a giant axe easily, and seemed to fight other wildlings regularly before Mance came along.Jon: Aside from having had a great education in combat as a kid (which 99% of the participants in the battle did not), Jon has at this point a good deal of practical experience against wildlings, professional assassins, (Karl), and other NW members. Combine that with the fact he was wielding the best sword at the castle and clearly learns from his experiences (he spit in Styr's face the way Karl spit in his), it's really not that unbelievable he would do so well.Ygritte: Is it so hard to believe someone could be that good on an archer when they come from a militant society where archery is a valuable hunting tool? Almost all of Ygritte's kills throughout the season have been her sniping from a safe distance, and top archers can fire 15-20 arrows a minute. She would need to be in the top class of archers present in the series to do as well as she did, but is that really so hard to fathom?

Â 
You do have a point here also, but it still was a little bit unbelievable to me.
Tormund might be the most skilled compared to other regular wildlings, but aren't they all skilled? Only the best went with Tormund. Others seemed very regular compared to the Nights Watch, but Tormund could kill 10 men in a row without getting a single cut.
Styr is a thenn. Why does every single thenn fights like a regular person, but Styr is this awesome unkillable fighter?
Night's watch have (should have had) discipline. Thenns have discipline. Night's Watch has better weapons, wildlings are more fearsome though. The fight should have been more or less even. I don't mind showing Tormund killing three men in a row, but doing that three times and not getting even a scar?
Yes, Ygritte might be a good archer, but why she is supposed to be Legolas 2.0 ? She fired arrows at small windows three times, haven't missed once. She fired arrows multiple times later, haven't missed once. Pyp was shooting from a crossbow at a massive congestion of people running towards him and he missed. Wtf. Also, Ygritte is perfectly sitting in one place, shooting. I just can't believe someone didn't took a shield and just run at her if she is that dangerous. Show her miss one time, show her struggle another, show her run somewhere. Show Tormund killing five men, but getting a small wound. Why does it supposed to be Jon Snow who manages to kill Styr and why does a skilled warrior Jon Snow (on that i agree) become totally hopeless against Styr?
4112	Envie	2014-06-11	I think the numbers counted vs. the numbers they state they have in the show are fairly accurate and I appreciate both show fans counting and the show creators making sure they didn't overdo it and kill off too many to leave it unbelievable.
Â 
My problem is that they've given little to no focus on the other keeps along the wall so it appears like, in the show, there are 50 or so men left, which is not very believable. Non book readers won't remember or know there are other NW at the other keeps (albeit not many) and might be calling BS right now on how they managed to defend the wall when it seemed like a helluva lot more wildlings came into the keep from the other side. It's not a huge nitpick of mine and counting the actual numbers doesn't change much - we're left hanging much where we were in the book... without knowing how they will survive more nights of attack before Stannis shows up magically. I'm actually glad they didn't show him there in the end - it will make next episode, the finale, much better.

Season 1 was definitely the closets to the book, and the changes have grown steadily with each season since. It's a pity, especially since minor changes tend to spiral out of control, but I suppose it's a the price to be paid.
Regarding Styr/the Thenn, it's important to remember that the Thenn in the show are very different, and likely don't have the same discipline or style of fighting their book counterparts do. Show Styr likely had to win his leadership through combat, meaning he would be the best of them. And Jon was doing well against him until Styr knocked away Longclaw, at which point it became a hand-to-hand fight between one very big man and one regular sized man.
For Ygritte, she should have been behind cover more, but seeing as she's of a smaller build and wouldn't have been drawing attention to herself, I could see her no getting picked off too easily. You mentioned Pyp not hitting much, but he was scarred shitless the entire time (like most of the NW present), which would have been throwing off his aim. Ygritte, meanwhile, has nerves of steel, and psychology counts for a lot in a battle.
4114	Janicia	2014-06-11	Part of the explanation for any action sequence ever filmed is that "it looks cool this way". Â Movies and TV are supposed to look good. Â It is part of the art form, just the wordcraft of a book should feel good. Â 
Â 
Given that the wildlings are meritocratic and the Night's Watchmen experienced in combat are mostly dead; it is entirely plausible that Tormond, Styr, Jon, and Allister would be significantly better than their comrades on the battlefield. Â The Night's Watch could have better utilized their defenses and the Wildlings could have used better tactics; but the battle was fun to watch and the battle outcome was largely consistent with the book. Â If the universe of ASOIAF were real, that battle would probably have as little resemblance to the book description as it had with the show version. Â They're both stylized by people trying to make entertaining art. Â
4115	boojam	2014-06-11	I make a new post because every other one has too much posts and my post will just be lost.Â As many people have asked, I've done the Night's Watch death count.Â How did i count:1. I've watched every sequence at 50% speed2. I've watched very closely, event the background stuff3. If i see a person die or get wounded, then i assume he is dead.4. If i see a person fall, but i don't see the cuts, i assume he is probably dead.5. I've counted only what I've seen. I haven't counted Ygritte arrows for example.Â Night's Watch casualties:43 dead + 8 probably dead. I might have missed some, but not much, max 5 deaths.Â My feelings:I'm happy that it didn't reach 100. I should say that after a rewatch i'm very grateful to people, who make CGI, direct the scenes, make costumes&sets and music is just awesome (as always, heil Ramin Djawadi).Now i hate D&D, their writing is just ridiculously stupid. I think they lack education, they lack talent, they don't spend enough time. They could be very good at writing simple stories and you can make a good movie with a simple story, there is no doubt. But if you are not GRRM or i don't know, Martin Scorsese or Wes Anderson, then you shouldn't try to make a scenario out of a book masterpiece (especially if you make changes).One of the most stupid things is that everyone who is important is a boss, a killing machine, which can be killed only by another boss. The killing spree by Tormund, Styr or Jon Snow is ridicuosly high and don't even get me started with Ygritte. It feels like she is out of this world. She hasn't missed even once! If we would have seen Ygritte shooting arrows for 30 minutes,, then there would be a 1000 dead men.O well that has been a movie clichA© forever.I found it hard to count because since they were using rubber axes and aluminum swords , for the 'spear carriers , looked like many people where struck a disabling blow and not a death one.Rough number I remember about medieval battles is that there are about 30% killed, some fraction of the other 70% were wounded probably greater than 30%.Problem was , and it depended on the time and the warring parties, many prisoners and the prisoner wounded were just flat killed and only the nobles , who where worth something were spared.Read Barbara Tuchman's A DISTANT MIRROR sometime about the 14th century.The Battle of CrA©cy starts the novel, and other battles are included up too, tho most is about the life and times between 1332â<U+0080><U+0093>1382 , the best history book on the middle ages I ever read.Episode 9 didn't have Maester Aemon doing his triage work , as in the book, but's that's the kind of detail nobody cares about.

4116	snowy	2014-06-12	As far as the small numbers of NW at the time of battle: in the show, how many departed with LC Mormont when he wanted to see if they could ascertain what happened to the party led by Benjen?  How many were killed during the search, and then how many were murdered at Craster's?  I don't recall but that obviously contributed to such anemic numbers since Tyrion departed, correct?
4117	Jaqen Hghar	2014-06-12	Things being they way they are, I still have some "reality" issues with the outcome of the battle in this episode. Considering that the wall is about 200 metres high, you don't need a largeÂ garrisonÂ to fend off even an attacking force the size of Mance's wildling army. The top of the wall is unreachable for archers (with the exception of the giant's bow we saw in action), and any attempt to climb it gives the defenders on the top plenty of time to have you fall to a certain death by dropping stones, shooting arrows - or releasing a big MF-ing anchor on a chain that sweeps you away like flies . So presenting even the slightest target on the top of the wall for a giant's bow to aim at is sheer stupidity, and the rest should be a piece of cake as far as defending "the wall" comes.
Â 
No, the only vulnerable point - as we also see in the episode - is the tunnel. It's pretty incomprehensible to me why more wildlings didn't follow the giant into the tunnel once he managed to pry the gate open out of sheer rage. Sure, they might have been keeping a distance to be out of bow range but had they used any ability of thinking the would have stormed forward as soon as they noticed there was a chance to get through. Furtheremore this would be the reason Mance leads his army to one single spot like this - considering their numbers they could have had people climb the wall spread out over tens of miles if they thought that was really going to do any good.
Â 
And finally - the defence of Castle Black on the ground was planned and carried out in a totally amateurish manner! If you have walls even as "low" as the ones CB has in the show (compared to The Wall that is) you still have a tremendous advantage over attackers and neither here should it take a large force to fend off a band of at most a few dozen wildlings. Instead it seemed that only a minority of the force was deployed to the walls while the rest were waiting in the yard for the wildlings to break through the gate - completely giving up the advantage of the walls. Now, I do realise that in the books CB isn't (as far as I understand) really fortified at all to the South, since the threat is considered to come from the North - where The Wall is. But then why notÂ  acknowledge this in the show instead of adding walls that the defenders then fail to utilize?!

One of the most stupid things is that everyone who is important is a boss, a killing machine, which can be killed only by another boss. The killing spree by Tormund, Styr or Jon Snow is ridicuosly high and don't even get me started with Ygritte. It feels like she is out of this world. She hasn't missed even once! If we would have seen Ygritte shooting arrows for 30 minutes,, then there would be a 1000 dead men.


Â 
I agree with you but this trope has been there since time immemorial.
And I'm not talking about Aragorn or Legolas or Jedi cutting down hundreds of battle droids. Even if you go back to the epics of various sorts, you'll see these 'super-human' boss characters that simply can't be killed, except by another boss.
Â 
In real life this practically never happened. Richard the Lionharted was slain by a random crossbow bolt. One of the Teutonic kings died to a halberd. But when you have literally thousands of years of fiction bearing on you the other way, it is very hard to go down that route. Would you have your favourite character die to a nameless extra? I can not think of any fiction where it has happened, like ever.
Â 
And again in movies if you don't see a character cut down 3 extras in two seconds, you wouldn't believe they are any good at fighting.
Â 
GRRM is clever with this trope. He has stuff like Rhaegar getting killed by Robert , Lewyn Martell and Lyn Corbray, Lord Karstark kills Steffon Lannister and so on. But if you examine it carefully it mostly occurs in the past or off screen. AND he has inverted the trope on occasions - like Ygritte dies to a random arrow.
Â 
One of the best examples is the Hound fight at the inn in the books. Unlike the show where there are dozens of men that the Hound effortlessly dispatches one by one, there are only two, and - just like in real life -, it is extremely difficult for him, simply because of the fact that one of your opponents will be facing your back. He doesn't make the Hound a killing machine that is simply invulnerable to normal opponents.
4119	zaphodbrx	2014-06-12	I would also like to point out that the boss trope has been on the show since day 1.
Â 
Dany's 3 bosses manage to conquer Yunkai on their own, because Yunkai has no boss to send against them, No amount of normal soldiers would help.
And that's just one example.
4120	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-12	On a rewatch I noticed, that the scene with the giant shooting a black brother from the wall down to castle black with his big arrow must have changed his place in the production. It now takes place, as the skirmish in the courtyard of castle black is at his height, but you can already see a glimpse of the impaled body just before Alliser gives his great speech. So it seems the scene with the giant arrow was rearranged to be later in the episode.


Â 
Oh, I'm definitely going to have to look for that. Â I've done one rewatch, and still, the darkness that permeates the episode does contribute to viewing problems. Â I'll be looking for that dude now, and I'm wondering......if it seems the Gigantor Bow and Arrow was only used that one time? Â Hmmmmmmmm, something new to look for.
Â 
I also just wanted to thank the OP for the count. Â
4121	mteague26	2014-06-12	Wow, ya'll are really reaching with this thread haha.
4122	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-12	Regarding bosses: aren't Tormund and Styr both renowned wildling leaders and warriors?
What's the problem with great warriors killing stewards and cripples?
4123	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-12	Just watched for the third time and I cried all the way through
4124	Janicia	2014-06-12	Game of Thrones is not primarily an action show; nor is it primarily an action book. Â The action is in there because it moves the plot forward, but it isn't the point of the story. Â Some watchers are not enthusiastic about action sequences, either because they find them uninteresting or overly gory. Â But other watchers yearn for more action and less skipping of battles. Â If you're in the second camp, is it really in your best interest to nitpick and complain about the big battle episode? Â 
Â 
Would you prefer if they had Sam black out early on and then wake up to find Jon cradling a dying Ygritte, or had them
going into battle at the end of one episode and see the aftermath at the beginning of the next? Â The battle gave a series of neat scenes that were fun to watch. Â Make up better tactics for your head cannon, if you need to. Â
4125	Fredwin	2014-06-12	Not sure what the big deal about having 'bosses' is. This isn't just a trope, this is something that goes all the way back to the origins of storytelling. What about all those tales of heroic deeds and valor crafted into legends and myths throughout history?Â 
Â 
The producers don't have a thousand lines of text to describe how 'badass' a character is. If you want to get the point across that a character is proficient in combat, you actually have to show said prowess.
Â 
There are hundreds of threads on these forums alone mocking up hypothetical battles, postulating which character could beat another character in single combat. Certainly, this isn't the point of the show or the novels, but it is a part of it. GRRM does like to indulge himself in this type of thing here and there, not to spoil anything but there is a lot of this type of thing included in his last anthology.
Â 
It's just human nature. I mean, look at the Wildlings. Do you think you get to be chief of some of these tribes without proving yourself or unless people are physically afraid of you?Â
4126	boojam	2014-06-13	I would also like to point out that the boss trope has been on the show since day 1.Â Dany's 3 bosses manage to conquer Yunkai on their own, because Yunkai has no boss to send against them, No amount of normal soldiers would help.And that's just one example.I guess Dany's budget went on E4 in Season 3... because in the book there are battles at Yunkai and Meereen.In fact her tactical prowess is on display at Yunkai , she plans the battle which is both frontal and rear sneak attack.They neatly avoided the (FIRST) battle for Meereen with slave revolt, actually I thought that was neat, but in the books the Unsullied had to break down the gate at Meereen in a frontal assault while the 'sewer sneak-attack' was going on.Her uncanny military aptitude has yet to be on display again in the books.By the by , on the show if Dany now has a zillion loyal slaves, seems to be The Son's of the Harpy should be toast!

4127	Bran's Legs	2014-06-14	I just rewatched the episode. Did Maester Aemon father a child? He talked about hooking up with someone when he was chatting with Sam in the library.
4128	JonBranRickon	2014-06-14	My thoughts exactly about Aemon.Â  That has not been mentioned in the books.Â  Also, I believe his children would take precedence over the children fathered by Egg.

How did i count:
1. I've watched every sequence at 50% speed

3. If i see a person die or get wounded, then i assume he is dead.
4. If i see a person fall, but i don't see the cuts, i assume he is probably dead.
5. I've counted only what I've seen. I haven't counted Ygritte arrows for example.
Â 
Night's Watch casualties:
43 dead + 8 probably dead. I might have missed some, but not much, max 5 deaths.
Â 
My feelings:
I'm happy that it didn't reach 100. I should say that after a rewatch i'm very grateful to people, who make CGI, direct the scenes, make costumes&sets and music is just awesome (as always, heil Ramin Djawadi).

If we would have seen Ygritte shooting arrows for 30 minutes,, then there would be a 1000 dead men.


Â 
If you look that closely at anything you will see a ton of imperfections, i suggest you stop doing that and just enjoy the ride.
4130	Everett Snow	2014-06-14	I got to 47 dead and 4 probably wounded, and yet I am still shocked it's that low given the killing sprees from Jon, Ygritte, Styr and Tormund. I didn't mind their killing sprees, I just imagined it would lead to a higher body count.
4131	juanml82	2014-06-14	Has the OP seen The Hobbit movies? Yes, it's not realistic that four guys kill mostly everyone. The entire battle is probably unrealistic.
Well, as you've all guessed already, this series isn't a documentary on medieval warfare. It's supposed to be dramatic and fun to watch. If you're looking for realism, stay clear from fiction.
4132	7th-key	2014-06-15	Fine, if you watch the show for the pretty pictures, good for you.
Â 
From wiki: http://en.wikipedia....on_of_disbelief
Â 

Â 
Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an internally consistent fictional world, the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.

For a non-action book, GRRM sure manages to get an awful lot of action into every single installment.
4134	Gun Street Girl	2014-06-14	Is it possible that this apparently off-the-cuff conversation could be the set up for a Targaryen bastard? Might help explain Young Griff.
4135	WinterKing	2014-06-08	Share!
This time I posted it.Sorry for ep. 8.
4136	Lyanna_Lou	2014-06-08	My friend really liked it a lot. He figured out pretty quickly that Ygritte was going to die in the battle, and he really enjoyed Maester Aemon's scene with Sam. Grenn & Co. going after the giant was his favorite part. 
I asked him what he thinks is going to happen next, though, and he said that he thinks that Stannis is going to attack King's Landing again, and that's how Tyrion will escape (in the chaos). He also is worried that Jon is going to be attacked by White Walkers while trying to get Mance.
4137	Lord Carson	2014-06-08	Best episode ever.
4138	JonSnew	2014-06-08	My SO originally thought that:Â 
Â 
Sam and Gilly would die horrifically during the episode.Â 
Â 
At the end, she thinks that:Â 
Â 
Thorne is dead.Â 
Jon Snow will die.Â 
Pyp's death was sadder than Ygritte's.Â 
Ygritte's death was very underplayed.Â 
The best scene was Grenn and the other Night's Watchers reciting their vows before the giant attacked, although she thinks it was stupid for them not to have bows and arrows/fire with them.Â 
She loves and hates Alliser Thorne and is very confused about how to feel.Â 
Janos Slynt is a jerk.Â 
No idea what might happen in the next episode. I hope Stannis comes as a pleasant shock!Â
4139	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-06-08	My friends and I were so hyped up the entire time. They were sure Sam was going to die. Probably because that's what D&D wanted them to think, what with all the "don't die on me" talk, right after "today is not the day I die" from Oberyn. They thought the scythe was awesome, and a few of them forgot the wildlings had giants. Big cheer at Styr's death. They thought it was Sam who shot Ygritte until the shot panned to Olly, who they said was the hardest working kid ever. Oh, and during the Thorne/Tormund fight, they were confused why they did the whole attack around the pillar thing. It was kinda weird.
4140	Eve	2014-06-08	My husband just kept saying; "Shoot the fucking arrows, don't just stand there!"
4141	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-06-08	People were not feeling this episode in my house. About halfway through it my dad said: "Is this gonna be just the Wall guys", and I said, "Guess so", and then he went to brush his teeth and came back when it was ending
Â 
My mom liked well enough, but my gf was pissed that there was no Stannis on sight
4142	eternal_got	2014-06-08	Helm's Deep for poor people ...
4143	chicagostatecougars	2014-06-08	The Unsullied I know disliked the episode. Thought it was boring. I guess this is the consequence of barely doing any plot or character development related to the Wall.
4144	ohpooratlas	2014-06-09	My boyfriend liked the fact that it was an episode more centered on just one storyline, even though the Wall isn't his favorite storyline.
Â 
Last year he raged when Jon Snow left Ygritte, but when she died he was just kind of like "meh." I asked him what the deal was, and as I predicted he said "I cared when they were together, but they've been apart for so long that I stopped caring." Just another example of how the creators missed out on a big emotionally impacting moment by cramming everything into one episode and not killing her off sooner.
Â 
He felt the ending was anticlimactic too, and he is completely unaware that Stanis is supposed to turn up at the end.
4145	ipsuel	2014-06-09	An unsullied friend of mine loved the episode, all the action -- but when it ended, asked me why they "wasted a whole episode on the Wall, when it's really not important."Â 
Â 
After I explained the importance of 100,000 wildlings getting South, not to mention the WW are around again, he conceded its importance, but followed up with this:
Â 
"The battle was great, but it seemed like an hour just to showcase Jon Snow and kill some people. Nothing really happened."
4146	Inv1ctus	2014-06-09	Oh, and during the Thorne/Tormund fight, they were confused why they did the whole attack around the pillar thing. It was kinda weird.


Â 
Haha in that instance I thought to myself that Ser Alliser has some ninja skills.
4147	Kungsmurfen	2014-06-09	So far I have only talked to two unsullied who saw the episode.Â 
Â 
First guy: Damn. That episode sucked. Worst episode of the season, by far! I expected more.
-He also thinks that Jon will die by Mance but they won't show it until next season - for some reasonÂ  
Â 
Second guy: Best episode ever. Soo awesome! I thought Jon would die as he held YgritteÂ  
-He thinks that Jon will somehow survive the meeting with Mance and is looking forward to the next episode.
4148	King Zee	2014-06-09	Yeah looking at the unsullied reactions I episodes 8 and 9 should have been switched.
4149	DominusNovus	2014-06-09	My wife also was totally convinced that Sam was going to die.
4150	sj4iy	2014-06-09	My MIL loved it and was wanting me to tell her what happens next because she thinks Jon will die.  She guessed Ygritte would die (not hard to figure out) but was shocked by Pip and Grenn.
My friend loved it and wanted to watch it again immediately XD
4151	Three sisters	2014-06-09	My unsullied sister thought the episode awesome, recognized Pyp and Grenn, but forget their names, and was not specifically moved by Ygrittes' death. She has no idea that Mannis is coming.
4152	DominusNovus	2014-06-09	Yeah looking at the unsullied reactions I episodes 8 and 9 should have been switched.


Â 
Y'know, thats a great point. Â If they had switched the two episodes, so much could have been improved:
- Compressed the amount of time Ygritte and Jon have been apart.
- Kept the whole 'episode 9 includes a shocking death that shakes up the plot' thing going.
- Could have paced out the aftermath of the battle better, putting some stuff in 'mountain and viper.'
4153	AZAXD	2014-06-09	My dad theorized that King's Landing will get word of all the chaos at Castle Black and finally decide to send men to help and that Tyrion will be allowed to go with them to join the Watch.
I thought this was kind of a cool guess (not sure how fast Ravens are though) and sort of makes sense for the unsullied how a Wall-centric episode follows a huge cliffhanger on Tyrion's life.
Â 
He also was like... did Alisser (not that he knew his name) actually die though?
4154	Corvinus	2014-06-09	The two guys that I talk to at work about GoT are gone this week, and my brother only texts me after some big shocking moment like last week. So I am sad now
4155	gregg22	2014-06-09	I feel bad for them that they can't follow the characters by name and understand how things come together..
Â 
For instance, one guy I talked did not know Janos Slynt's back story or his name. He just thought he was some leader at the Wall who was a coward. Since Slynt's arc is one of the few examples of ACTUAL justice in the whole damn story, I feel bad that he will miss it.
Â 
Also, he was mad that the whole episode was at the Wall, likely because because he is not getting the overall significance of it in the story.
Â 
He didn't understand where Jon was going at the end either, for some reason.
4156	King Zee	2014-06-09	yeah I had to pull Season 2 episodes after Â "The Watchers" Â so that my mom could understand who Janos Slynt was.
4157	ovis alba	2014-06-09	I feel bad for them that they can't follow the characters by name and understand how things come together..

Â 
I for once thought they managed it quiet well, because a friend of mine actually got it, because they inserted the part where he complains that back in KL he had "real" men to fight and now just a bunch of criminals, so it's all their fault.
4158	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-06-09	My hubby just kept saying "Ygritte is crazy! Somebody kill her already!" Then she died and he got quiet. lol Â 
Â 
He didn't say much else, we were just both on the edge of our seats the whole episode. Â My mom was disappointed that it was only at the Wall. @@ Â She doesn't like an episode if it doesn't have Arya in it. Â My Dad loved it and he's ready for Stannis. He hasn't read the books, but he reads the Wiki.
4159	sj4iy	2014-06-09	Â

Â 
Honestly, I think doing that would have made #8 seem anticlimactic. Â It was much more low-key and, other than Oberyn's fight and death, isn't the type of episode that could follow an episode like this one without a feeling of deflation.
Â 
This episode was where it needed to be, and next week's episode will be the only thing that could follow up the massive spectacle we just got here.

But is it paranoid if it's true?
4165	ladybuc	2014-06-09	My husband was rather underwhelmed. Although he likes The Wall storyline, he felt like it was underdone. He said that historically the second to last episode ended with a big bang (i.e. the Red Wedding), but this one felt like it ended rather, well, lame...
Also, he could not get over the fact that the entire episode featured The Wall. He has waited for 2 weeks for the battle by combat (The Mountain vs. the Viper), and now it will be another week before Tyrion's fate will be known.
After talking to people at work this morning, I got more of the same!
4166	Mel_Rose	2014-06-09	Best episode ever.


Â 
That's exactly what a friend of mine posted on fb about the episode. Haven't spoken to other fans yet.
4167	Bird	2014-06-09	One of my most critical friends really enjoyed this episode, even though her fiance did not. She says "it def kept me interested. I thought it was good.. maybe people are just used to serious shit happening every episodes that an epic battle still pales in comparison to a character dying
Â 
When one friend asked another friend what Jon was doing going north of the wall with no weapons or Ghost, another friend answered "who the hell knows, CVS on the corner?" Basically meaning that trying to guess what will happen next is futile.
Â 
There was confusion about who Mance is and his relationship with Jon (prompting the conversation I mentioned above), little sympathy for Ygritte (egret as one friend calls her), extreme dislike for Tormund, no one caught that it was Slynt who ran and hid (no one even asked), concern that Sam would die next, and my Mom worrying over whether Ghost will die (she is still scarred from Lady's death).Â 
Â 
The mammoths and giants were a huge success, and Pip and Grenn's deaths brought tears to us all.Â 
Â 
As for what will happen next: Well, one friend has decided CVS is as good a guess as any. No one is guessing Stannis to the rescue.Â
4168	Cyril	2014-06-09	I had to explain Janos Slynt to my non-reader friends as well.Â  It's a bit sad.
Â 
They told me this episode gave them anxiety, like a brutal action movie might.Â  In a good way as well as a bad way.
Â 
Their best idea came from Wight Giants.Â  As if UnGregor wasn't terrifying enough, what a nightmare a Wight Giant would be to fight against. I give this idea 10/10 and hope the show eventually uses it.
Â 
A few episodes I was pleased when they guessed that the Hound would die to infection. I didn't say anything, but it means they were getting the hints, such as him moving a bit slow and also rubbing his neck.
Â 
I told them that there may or may not be people dying next episode and asked who, if any, was going to die.
They're convinced Tyrion will.Â  Their dreams or protagonists surviving have been crushed.
They think Dany is going to die, if not next episode, then eventually.
They don't seem entirely convinced Jon is going to die going out on his little suicide mission, but also have no idea how the Night's Watch will survive.Â  I admit I tried hinting at Stannis, asking where they thought he was, and they had no clue.
They're not sure what's going to happen with Arya.
They think Tywin is pretty much at the top of the world, though they admit that nothing is certain.
I don't think they care about Shae and they didn't even think about or mention her.
4169	Indigocell	2014-06-09	Â Oh, and during the Thorne/Tormund fight, they were confused why they did the whole attack around the pillar thing. It was kinda weird.


Â 
I just thought it was because they were fighting in an area that was disadvatageous for longswords.Â  You couldn't swing wide left or right because you had the wall on one side and the pillars on the other.Â  If all you can do is stab then it is much easier for your opponent to read.Â  He had to swing around because otherwise it would have lodged into it.
Â 
I thought it did look kind of theatrical though.

Â 
Yeah, and it leaves your body wide open to attack
4171	Dornish Hen	2014-06-09	My friend texted me halfway through the battle asking why the Wildlings hated the Night's Watch. Â She didn't understand the hatred that the Wildlings have for what the Wall stands for or the fear they feel about being left on the other side. Â But, she is also the one I had to tell twice that the Queen of Thorns was the one who killed Joffrey. Â
4172	ballajam	2014-06-09	All on my non reader friends loved the episode.Â 
Â 
Even my parents who watch it in terribly dubbed Spanish understood everything that was going on. I think people dont value the "Previously on Game of Thrones" part. It really explains everything you need to know about the episode going on.Â 
Â 
Anyway, my gf mentally prepared herself for Ygritte as she was battling so it wasnt too bad. At first she was like aww man this episode is only the wall how lame. But loved it once the drama set in of how unprepared the NW was. Â 
Â 
They loved the battle and all the fighting. I reacted more when the episode ended cause I was expecting Stannis and they werent. So I kinda spoiled some drama for them by accident.Â
4173	Nutbean	2014-06-09	My daughter thought it was okay. In and of itself, she thought it was a decent episode, however, she was also a little bored/annoyed that the entire episode took place at the wall which is one of her least favourite storylines. Also, she doesn't really know who is who on the wall so Grenn and Pyp's deaths had basically no impact on her whatsoever.
4174	A Man Is A Man	2014-06-09	I told my gf that this whole episode is at the Wall and she said "oh, well then I don't have to watch it then". Both the Wall and Essos leave her cold.
4175	franko99	2014-06-09	Yeah looking at the unsullied reactions I episodes 8 and 9 should have been switched.


Â 
Yup. It was a great episode, but it was a mistake to have a "wall only" episode after a giant cliffhanger in KL last week. Most people are more concerned about Tyrion's fate than in the Night's Watch.
Â 
I'm sure if this has been episode 7 or 8 everyone would be thinking it was the best episode of the season so far.
4176	The Giver	2014-06-09	My unsullied friend said the episode was good, not great, but good. She said it was like a smaller version of Helm's deep, and her biggest problem with the episode was when the little boy (Ollie) killed Ygritte, he was so serious and grown up, when a moment ago he had been bawling his eyes out. lol.
4177	Seneti	2014-06-10	Their best idea came from Wight Giants.Â  As if UnGregor wasn't terrifying enough, what a nightmare a Wight Giant would be to fight against. I give this idea 10/10 and hope the show eventually uses it.

Â 
Oh my god... giant Wights... you're right - that is nightmare fuel... Â *shudder*
Â 
As for the death predictions: Sounds like they've grasped the true meaning of "If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention". I'm glad that Tywin is going to come completely out of the left field.
4178	SlowLoras	2014-06-10	Mr SlowLoras:
Â 
- knew Ygritte was going to die, but was certain Sam and/or Gilly would too.
- thought the dead giant might come back as a wight *shudder*
- thought Grenn and co would fail in the tunnel
- has no idea that Stannis is on the way (although he does think Stannis will head to the wall eventually)
4179	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-06-10	" I fukin hate this show.Â I don't think I've ever been right about who does what or something like that. I mean, I knew this last ep was going to be like blackwater, so I knew there would be casualties... but I'm pretty sure almost everyone I thought would die, survived and vice versaÂ 1 more ep... assholes, I want more."
4180	Dragon Queen	2014-06-10	My husband thinks that Jon Snow has massive plot armor and thinks that somehow he'll survive. He thinks the Night's Watch must be able to kill Mance or convince the wildlings to go away, because otherwise they're doomed and what's the point of all this Wall time if every Wall character gets slaughtered.
Â 
Bro was worried Jon would die, is glad he didn't.
Â 
I don't think people cared too much about the deaths of Ygritte, Pyp, and Grenn. I couldn't have told you which one was Pyp and which one was Grenn so I didn't much care either. I'm just glad the overall body/character count is down, less names to keep track of. Husband was like, "So Eh-gret died?" and had no reaction to Pyp/Grenn dying.
4181	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-10	They all started screaming when Sam let Ghost loose. "No! Not Ghost!" They're completely battered and are now paranoid that the worst possible thing will happen to the protagonists and that everything will work out perfectly for the antagonists. But is it paranoid if it's true?


Â 
OMG!! Â and LOL!!! Â My first laugh of the day.
Â 
It is so true, though. Â Let's hope they don't go all Cersei with the paranoia. Â Let's hope I don't, I'm still waiting on those two to three books. Â
4182	westerosifitness	2014-06-10	This event should have happened in episode 4, if it all HAD to be in one episode.
Â 
I don't understand why they HAVE to save the 'big fight' for the end of the season, at the expense of the season.
Â 
Season 4 should have rocked everyone's world with its pacing and non-stop jaw-dropping moments, but like true Hollywood idiots, D&D messed it up by cramming everything in the last 4 episodes.
Â 
Hollywood seems to be obsessed with their big epic action sequences having to take place at the climax of the story. The battle for the wall is really only one epic part of the Wall's story in ASOS. The battle should have taken place mid-season, and the trial and election of Jon should have played out through the latter half of the season.
Â 
But NOOOO, there has to be a battle scene at the end of the season, and for some reason it has to be epic and everyone has to die and YGritte and Jon finally see each other again after months apart only to have her tragically killed before his very eyes. Oooh how epic!
Â 
Most of my family and friends really don't care about Jon and they thought Ygritte was a nasty slut. They also think the Night's Watch is incredibly stupid and incompetent and just want the wildlings to win.
4183	HTN02	2014-06-10	unsullied colleague of mine is already like "just let Stannis show up and kill them all"
Â 
when i asked him how he knew stannis would come to the rescue;
Â 
"cause he said so"
Â 
Â 
Tried to make him believe Tyrion dies next episode. he is getting to good at guessing (or the show gets to predictable)
4184	Plume	2014-06-10	My BF was glad it was a wall episode only. Jon is his favorite character and The wall plot is also his favorite so he liked everything.
Was very sad when Pyp and Grenn died.Â 
Â 
One of my colleagues was so pissed that we didn't get to see the afthermath of Oberyn's death, it prevented him from enjoying completely the episode.
4185	Lord Quork	2014-06-10	Hello, this is my first postÂ  
Â 
I haven't spoken to my friend about the ep in any detail yet, but he sent me a message afterwards saying he thought it was a brilliant episode - after having said last week that season 4 hasn't been as good as the rest. Don't think he has any clue about Stannis either (he previously found out about the details of Tyrion's escape).
4186	SansaSeastar	2014-06-10	I think the biggest problem with this episode for most of the non book readers is that they have to wait another week to see what happens to Tyrion. I like to make fun of a friend who just loves Tyrion. For example: he never liked Oberyn because he was mean to Tyrion (although he doesn't like to admit it LOL) but thought he finally became 'cool' when he became a champion for his small friend, everything just revolves around Tyrion, it really annoys me a bit XD and the same goes for most 'unsullied', just ask them who their favorite character is and most will tell you it's Tyrion.Â
4187	Lord Quork	2014-06-10	Oh also my friend keeps wondering why these latest episodes have been a few minutes shorter than usual.
4188	Dildo_Baggins	2014-06-10	Nobody has an idea that Stannis will come and crush Mance. And when i ask my friend " why do you think stannis got funded from the bank and is trying to build an army" he'd answer "well because he's trying to take over all westeros just like the evil antagonists who try to take overall the world in popular culture ". I mean come on, stannis said in the season 3 final that he's going to the wall to defend against the white walkers.
4189	Ghost wind	2014-06-10	A friend of mine told me after watching it:Â 
Â "If they keep going like that there is not going to be anyone left to kill! And then "Jon's wildling" is killed by a boy!"Â 
Â 
Also he thought Ygritte was going to swap sides and go with Jon. And he said that Jon was going to die anyway because he was "going to go kill some guy Â alone". I asked him if he didn't think that the King Beyond the Wall was important and he said that no he was not important because he was going to die anyway.Â 
Â 
Really I think they are not getting the feeling that I got when reading that really there were very high chances for the willings to invade the 7K. I always saw it as a big threat and they don't even care.
4190	lyanna_maria	2014-06-10	My best friend loved the episode, but it seems that he still doesn't like Jon. He's pissed off because he doesn't understand why on earth would he go after Mance without Ghost, without a sword and dressed all in black. And, to be honest, neither do I. What was exactly his plan again?
4191	A Man Is A Man	2014-06-10	I think the biggest problem with this episode for most of the non book readers is that they have to wait another week to see what happens to Tyrion.

Â 
Â Don't you think that's true of a lot of book-readers too? I think Tyrion is the most interesting character and I'm a book-reader.
4192	sj4iy	2014-06-10	My best friend loved the episode, but it seems that he still doesn't like Jon. He's pissed off because he doesn't understand why on earth would he go after Mance without Ghost, without a sword and dressed all in black. And, to be honest, neither do I. What was exactly his plan again?Pretty sure he's going to parley, like in the books. That's the only way he can get close to Mance, and you don't go to truce talks with weapons or large wolves. It's not as if he could fight his way through the wildling army by himself, so the guise of parley is his only option.

Along with the Monty Python "Wot's it like?" from Sam we have "I'm not dead!" from Thorne.
4198	Young Nan	2014-06-11	My coworker was pissed that they didn't show what happened to Tyrion after his trial, and said he heard that Tyrion is actually only a minor character in the books, and that's why they didn't show him this episode lol.
My husband predicted that Janos Slynt will get beheaded by Jon for desertion, which I agree is pretty likely.
4199	milkofthepoppy	2014-06-11	During the episode,
Me: aren't you loving that it's just the wall?
Unsullied BF: meh, this battle has been dragging on so long, and I don't even care about these people.
At the end of the episode, 
UBF: well, only thing that happened is Ygritte died.
Me: what about Pyp?
UBF: who?
Me: Grenn?
UBF: was that the little kid?
Me: no, the dude that died killing the giant.
UBF: at least they have Mance.
Me: no, that's Tormund. Mance is out beyond the wall with the rest of his army.
UBF: oh.
Now my bf must not have been paying attention, and I make it a point not to explain too many things to him during the show. But I think it's safe to say that unsullied that don't have book reader friends to explain things to them (and aren't interested in spending time on forums) have NO CLUE what's going on. It's like D&D have no interest in character development or giving each episode it's own arc within the larger story series arc. (In all fairness though, this is the one episode that does have it's own story arc).
4200	Young Nan	2014-06-11	You are right, Poppy.  Virtually every discussion I have with unsullied necessitates me explaining for 5 minutes who everyone is, why it's important, that it's "Roose" not "Bruce", etc.

Hahahaha funny you mention that, my dad's a big MP fan!
4204	Skagosi Pirate	2014-06-11	At first my OH was just really confused at the geography. I actually had to stop and explain to him that the Wildlings and the fire were North of the Wall, and Ygritte/Tormund/Thenns were south on a raiding party. He's a really smart guy but it's over a year since Mance's plan was set in motion and he'd forgotten it all.Â 
Â 
To be honest I really wish they'd not added all that stuff about Jon going back to Craster's and spent some time developing the wall plotlines so that non-book readers remembered and cared. Even if it was just the NW guys sitting around and eating porridge I think the battle would have been stronger.Â 
Â 
He's also REALLY worried that Tyrion will die, and that's all he can really think about right now.Â 
Â 
Finally, I asked him who he thinks will be on the IT at the end. He thinks all the men will die, without exception, and then we'll be left with Arya (his favourite), Dany, Brienne and Margaery. Then the women will decide to share the IT, "because that's the kind-of thing they'd do", and it's happy ever after.
Â

4205	Cyril	2014-06-11	Virtually every discussion I have with unsullied necessitates me explaining for 5 minutes who everyone is, why it's important, that it's "Roose" not "Bruce", etc.On this subject, my group constantly says "Samuel" (emphasis on the u) instead of "Samwell" despite corrections.
I suppose it's close enough, but I admit it does annoy me.

Makes sense. For some reason, I was a bit confused, even though that's what happens in the books. Thank you! 
I explained this to my best friend and now at least he doesn't think Jon has gone nuts, but he still doesn't think it's a good plan. He's pissed off at the lack of military strategy and wishes Jon would seal the tunnel. He's also suggested that they could use wildfire against the wildlings. I explained that it's not that easy to come by and stuff, and the Throne's attitude towards the NW, but he said "they know nothing of this in KL, if they did now they'd send help. Back then, they needed to use all their force in winning the War of the 5 Kings". 
My female friend thinks it was the best episode ever, shenloves Jon Snow more than ever, she's very sad for Ygritte and even Grenn and "Pypar" and she praises the admirable behaviour of all the members of the NW in general during the battle.
4207	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-11	My sister loved it very, very much and enjoyed every second! I said to her before watching so often: "You know, it's only The Wall! You know that, don't you?", but even although she worries and cares very much for Tyrion, aso. it didn't stop her from absolutely loving this episode (she's anyway one of those people who are able to enjoy almost every arc -she's bored by Dany- and says she doesn't want to have specific favourite charas, just enjoy the people and their stories as a whole).
Â 
She also loves Sam very much and was super-happy with his development and behaviour this episode, she cheered and jubilated after every Wildling death (and especially after Jon vs. Styr), thought the mammoth / giants / sycthe / aso. was extreme awesome; she even loved Sam's and Jon's sex talk and Sam/Aemon and everything with Sam/Gilly.
She still hates Alliser and hopes he's definitely dead (although she admitted he did a very good job), I've told her so often about Slynt's past she wasn't surprised at his cowardly behaviour, she was sad after Ygritte's, Pyp's and Grenn's death, but is glad Sam, Jon, Gilly, aso are still alive.
Â 
The deaths didn't affect her so much as Oberyn's - which made her the whole last week extremely angry, sad, more angry and worried - but she was the entire episode feverish, nervous, excited; more than me (because I already knew about the lack of Stannis and was still very angry, disappoited, felt trolled, aso.), but her love for the episode consoled me and made me actually enjoying the episode much more than I expected.
Â 
The best thing (which REALLY lifted my mood) was her saying: "And the rest of Westeros doesn't give a fuck about what happens there?! Nobody cares about that?! Fuck you rest of Westeros!" And I was just: "Tcha, it's The Wall, you know what other Westerosi think about the Wall, NW, threat of the Wildlings and WWs..." 
She never makes predicitions (or al least she never tells me any), but she has no glue about Stannis' arrival next episode, which really surprises me; she's actually so clever and knows that a certain thing didn't happen at the end of this episode, which fucked me up, but she still thinks it's just the fact that it ended with a cliffhanger and they didn't show the whole battle (She knows I'm a big StannisFan and maybe she thinks if I had expected him, I'd have moaned the whole time "WHERE IS STANNIS?!", but I didn't say a thing about him or even mentioned him), so his arrival next episode will be a surprise for her AND she loved the episode, which all makes me really happy
4208	Neumond	2014-06-11	My partner was in love with the episode.
Another unsullied thought the only things that happened was: Ygritte died and Jon is now gone...
They both were somewhat impatient because they hoped to see whatÂ´s going on with Tyrion. (I am a bit nerved that Tyrion seems to be the most important character for them by lenghts. The other characters are either cool or annoying but they arenÂ´t too interested in them.)
So they didnÂ´t enjoy the episode as I did (I loved it!) and were actually waiting for a KL-scene...
4209	sj4iy	2014-06-11	During the episode,
Me: aren't you loving that it's just the wall?
Unsullied BF: meh, this battle has been dragging on so long, and I don't even care about these people.

(In all fairness though, this is the one episode that does have it's own story arc).

Not a fair statement...some non book readers get it just as much as book readers.  Other non book readers don't get as invested in the show as we do, and therefore don't remember the characters as much.
4210	Bluesnow	2014-06-11	Unsullied friend at work did not like the episode.Â 
Â 
She said it was just too much random killing and not much else.Â 
Her favorite character was John, and she is deeply concerned about his fate in the next episode, but she thought the newest episode was boring because not that much happened.Â 
Â
4211	ctid1977	2014-06-11	I have 2 work mates who watch it and neither of them are book readers (well one has read Game of thrones and is halfway through clash).
Â 
Both of them loved it. One was upset that there was no Tyrion, but she was blown away by the mammoths and is convinced Jon will die. The other said it was the best piece of TV he's seen and is also convinced Jon is screwed.
Â 
I asked them how they though the season would end, between them they came up with Arya killing the hound. One saw Tyrion dying and the other saw him being saved when Stannis attacks KL, one said maybe Littlefinger will save Jon which is my personal favourite, and then decided that no Jon was still screwed. They both reckoned Danerys wouldn't do much.
4212	Mel_Rose	2014-06-11	At first my OH was just really confused at the geography. I actually had to stop and explain to him that the Wildlings and the fire were North of the Wall, and Ygritte/Tormund/Thenns were south on a raiding party. He's a really smart guy but it's over a year since Mance's plan was set in motion and he'd forgotten it all.Â 
Â 
To be honest I really wish they'd not added all that stuff about Jon going back to Craster's and spent some time developing the wall plotlines so that non-book readers remembered and cared. Even if it was just the NW guys sitting around and eating porridge I think the battle would have been stronger.Â 
Â 
He's also REALLY worried that Tyrion will die, and that's all he can really think about right now.Â 
Â 
Finally, I asked him who he thinks will be on the IT at the end. He thinks all the men will die, without exception, and then we'll be left with Arya (his favourite), Dany, Brienne and Margaery. Then the women will decide to share the IT, "because that's the kind-of thing they'd do", and it's happy ever after.
Â 
Â 


Of course if they did that, then you'd have everyone going "omg the Wall is so boring, they're just sitting there, doing nothing". Even if it obviously wasn't just eating porridge, if it was them doing stuff in preparation for the battle it would seem too long and dull for many viewers. I guess D&D can never win - if they spend time with the Wall characters: "why do we spend time with them, they're doing nothing, where's Tyrion" - if they don't spend time: "who are they? don't care if they die, where's Tyrion".

Unsullied: BEST. EPISODE. EVER.

4214	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-06-11	This is p r e c i s e l y the reaction I have seen so far from friends and the internets.Â (sorry for the double post!)In my FB timeline it was more like "where is spoiler?" or "Spoiler! Spoiler! Spoiler!".
4215	Skagosi Pirate	2014-06-11	Of course if they did that, then you'd have everyone going "omg the Wall is so boring, they're just sitting there, doing nothing".

Â 
I dunno, I think D&D are usually really good at keeping storylines alive just with little characterful moments. Loads of people like the Hound/Arya even though nothing has happened to them all season except they've found dying/dead people. Ditto Brienne; her biggest moment this season has been a long conversation about how to make good pies. I would have loved to see some deadpan humour from Dolorious Edd, or Pyp and Grenn wondering if they should visit the moletown ladies despite the ban. I'd like that a lot more than a trip up to Craster's Keep to get to know a whole load of new characters who will never appear again.Â 
Â 
And obviously I wish they had kept a lot of the political stuff. I much prefer the plot being that Jon is forced out to speak to Mance on a suicide mission, to get him out of the way, rather than the HBO version.Â 
Â 
Anyway these are all small gripes. I will forgive D&D everything because the mammoths were so frickin' cool.Â

Â 
I think this way works better in proving Jon's ability to lead, though. Â We see that he's willing to sacrifice his life and his honor to try to save the NW- something a real leader would do without hesitation, and will garner the respect of all of the men in CB. Â Plus we already saw the 'try to get him out of the way mission' when Slynt convinced Thorne to send Jon to Craster's Keep, so it would have been repetitive to do it again here.

This is gloriousÂ
4219	majgat	2014-06-11	Unsullied GF notes on the episode:
- was a bit annoyed, that it was all on the Wall
- didn't care about the Wall stuff before, but is now hooked a little more
- she likes Sam and thinks Jon is a cutie
- from the dead trio, she was sad about Grenn, because he was all right
- still thinks that the wildlings will go past the Wall
Â 
After that I asked her about almost every character and what she thinks will happen:
- Jon is gonna survive somehow (doesn't know how thought)
- Wildlings will go past the Wall eventually, but someone is gonna stop them. When I asked who, she just took a shot in a dark and said: "maybe Lady Melisandre is gonna come and do something" (not bad)
- Reek and Ramsay will stay in Winterfell now and nothings gonna happen there
- Brienne/Pod and Arya/Hound are gonna meet up
- Bran's storyline is not important right now, lot of stuff is going on south so they will focus on that
- Dany will just sit in Mereen for a while
- Tyrion will go to Wall, because a lot is happening there right now, so why not
- Tywin's ruling is getting out of hand
- she predicted Cersei's and Margaery's cat fight over Tommen
- Jaime is worthless now
Â 
I think that the last ep will be a treat for her :-)
4220	sj4iy	2014-06-12	Â 
This is gloriousÂ  

Hope she likes more Wall next year XD
4221	Ugly Little Girl	2014-06-12	My OH just watched it (he's been putting it off because he's convinced himself that 'The Imp' is going to get killed). 
He seemed to have a good idea of what was going on with the two pronged attack and who the major players were (although he doesn't always know their names!). He thought Ghost was going to kill Ygritte and was quite certain that 6 men wouldn't be able to defend the inner gate from the giant :')
I asked him what he thinks will happen next and he replied in a depressingly resigned tone 'everyone's going to die'
4222	sj4iy	2014-06-12	Finally talked to my sister. Â She's convinced that Jon is going to die, as well as Tyrion, because she likes both of them XD Â She didn't get some of the more minute things (like spitting in Styr's face being a lesson Jon learned from Karl TFL Tanner), but she loved the action sequences and said she was sad when Ygritte and Green died (she didn't remember who Pyp was). Â She didn't get that Jon was going to pretend to parley (something I felt they should have mentioned, myself), but it made sense to her what he was doing when I told her about it. Â Overall, she loved it, especially after what happened to Oberyn (which she did NOT see coming at all). Â She even ponied up for HBO even though there were 2 episodes left of GoT.

I totally see your point, but Hound/Arya and Brienne are main characters more or less and the first two in particular are huge fan favorites so people would probably watch them just walking around and talking for half an hour with no complaints. They have to be in the forefront of the audience's attention. Personally, apart from the fight at the inn and the chickens, I was pretty indifferent to the rest of the Arya and Hound scenes.
Edit: the mammoths were cool yeah!

4224	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-06-12	noone i know has any idea that stan the man is coming, which i guess is a good thing. everyone also loved the episode. there were some grumblings about not getting tyrion at first, but those faded and everyone loved the battle.
4225	Rashtibram	2014-06-12	They were underwhelmed. General thoughts: "It was just a lot of fighting. Who cares? Let's get back to Tyrion."
4226	westerosifitness	2014-06-12	They think A Lannister will die this season
4227	ohpooratlas	2014-06-12	Both of my coworkers loved the episode. I was really pleased to see that. I've been trying to get reactions from people unfamiliar with the books before putting any of my own input in. Both of them are happy that Jon Snow is finally stepping up as well.
Â 
Neither of them are convinced that Jon is going to die, but they are dreading the finale because I've managed to convince them to just "accept it, you're going to lose a Lannister." 
Â 
I think they'll be ecstatic with the episode.
4228	Boberyn Swann	2014-06-13	My one friend who doesn't read the books or care too much for character's names really loved the episode while my other friend who is a bit more involved with the storylines said it was an average ep with too much action, not enough story.
Â 
Agree with people saying that tv only viewers don't quite understand the importance of certain storylines and characters. Most people I know still call Ygritte, Ingred... sigh
4229	Arkash	2014-06-13	Apart from one or two friends who didnt like it, most of them really loved the episode !Â
4230	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-06-09	Pretty good. Â He had at least two kills - one by frying pan! Â Perhaps he could be one of the good Night's Watch to replace Grenn?
4231	Vaelya of Asshai	2014-04-18	We all know that something happens on the 9th episode, the first season was Ned's execution, the second was the Battle of Blackwater, the third was the Red Wedding, what do you think the fourth will be? I know it's a couple months away, but still. Personally, I think it could be Tywin's death, and parts of the Battle on the Wall, etc. I can't think of hat else happened at the end of ASOS, if anyone else has any predictions, I'd love to hear them for this episode.Â
4232	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-02	We all know that something happens on the 9th episode, the first season was Ned's execution, the second was the Battle of Blackwater, the third was the Red Wedding, what do you think the fourth will be?

	Spoiler The episode will take place entirely at the Wall for the Battle of Castle Black, just like the Blackwater episode. Tywin's death will be in episode ten.
4233	Arkash	2014-05-02	Nope, it will be fully dedicated to the Battle at the Wall.
Â 
I except the deaths of Ygritte, Thorne, Styr and Grenn there.
4234	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-02	The King who cared.Â 
Hopefully it will be as epic as Blackwater or perhaps even top that.Â
4235	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-02	I'm definitely expecting to see some mammoth action. Generally agree with the death predictions above, though I'm still on the fence about Thorne.Â
4236	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	It's pretty awesome that this thread was approved so early.
Â 
We've known for quite some time that this ep. would be entirely set during the battle. And now we know categorically that the Hands of Gold scene will be in episode ten (we'd guessed it anyways but Alex Graves confirmed that there would be a "confrontation" between Tyrion and Tywin in ep. 10, "the Children"). The weapons and training video, some Neil Marshall interviews and the ep. being called "the Watchers on the Wall" are confirmation enough that this will be a Blackwater style ep.
Â 
Stan, I think it will be way better than "Blackwater" because in terms of production the budget is way higher, meaning more wide shots of armies running etc, instead of all being tightly shot. Also Neil Marshall was brought in as a last-minute replacement for another director with Blackwater and only had a week or two to prepare, whereas this time he had months to prepare and D and D allowed him to come up with a lot of his own ideas. This info. I'm spouting came from a Neil Marshall in October or November IIRC.

4237	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-02	^However higher production values doesn't necessarily mean it will be better. I personally feel Blackwater was the best GoT episode, closely followed by Rains of Castamere, if this one comes even of close to those, it would be great.Â
4238	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	I flit back and forth between what I think is best and what isn't, but yeah, Blackwater was great. Its production values btw were one of the reasons that that was the case. They funneled a shit-ton of S2's funds towards it specifically. Now their budget has increased and they've spread the money throughout the season but there's still been a helluva lot put into this particular episode. I really doubt we'll get mammoths, but giants, the battles from the south and north combined to raise the stakes (which I think was a good choice because I like this Craster's Keep invented stuff quite a bit), Ygritte biting it, some awesome duels and the Mannis arrival... It'll take names. The Children will be the best episode of the season though.

4239	Crow'sEye	2014-05-02	The bit I am looking forward to most is the charge of the knights making the save, the armour shimmering in the sun and against the snow. The Blackwater was good, but this battle under the sun and above the snow should be better.
Also possibly reactions from both sides as to who the hell this third force is.
Hope they judge the music well.
4240	Arkash	2014-05-02	Yeah it will be action packed but damn, looking forward to great piece of dialogue in this episode as well... I wonder if the dialogue could be as intense as those of Blackwater !
4241	Lord Damian	2014-05-02	The big Tech budget buster will show mammoths, giants and large scale battle. We will cheer for Stannis because the show is reinforcing that this guy has not had a break since he killed his own brother, Renly.

I think we'll see a few. I don't remember who said it, but one of the crew members said we're going to see an army unlike any we've seen before.Â 
Â 
So we know we're going to have giants, as we've seen in the trailers, and hopefully we're going to have mammoths.

Â 
Can you imagine the wide shot of Stannis's army during victory while he rides triumphantly in front of them? 
Â 
I so hope they'll do the justice to that ending but as for the entire episode it will be hard to top Blackwater - among Unsullied I know the wildfire being lit remains the most epic scene from the show + the episode had so much gold in it - drunk Cersei, Tyrion's lines...but I'm sure 4x09 will be terrific.
4247	Dany's Silver	2014-05-02	I really wish they'll keep the Mammoths. Come on guys, Mammoths on TV? Everyone would be so hyped just seeing them!
Â 
(Might explain why we haven't seen the dragons since Episode 1, since they've been saving for the Mammoths)

Or we might see Dany's "children" in Ep 10. I suspect that the simultaneous battles in this episode will be epic. I suspect that the young boy whose father Ygritte killed will be the source of the arrow that takes her life. I am looking forward to the Night's Watch kicking ass, I would also like to see why Melisandre does in this battle. I can't help but think of the time she told Davos that she was a knight of sorts.  I also want to see Ghost's reaction to her (but I suspect we might have to wait for S5 to see that!). I, too, would like to see mammoths.
4248	Bran Snow	2014-05-02	I really wish they'll keep the Mammoths. Come on guys, Mammoths on TV? Everyone would be so hyped just seeing them!
Â 
(Might explain why we haven't seen the dragons since Episode 1, since they've been saving for the Mammoths)


Â 
I think the Dragon budget went to the Direwolves this season. They seem to play a bigger role this season then having dragons fly around on screen. Though, Mammoths would be cool to see.
Â 
I think we got a little foreshadowing in 404 with the boy saying he was the best shot in his village. I would say its safe to say, he'll be the source of the Ygritte's "scene".
Â 
As for Throne, I would say he is safe. Jon still needs someone at the wall within the brotherhood to cause some problems
4249	Bane66	2014-05-02	Ygritte will fall for sure, most likely at the hands of the boy. Â I hope Grenn doesn't fall but with no Donal Noye i can certainly see it hapening. Â Hope we see Mance before this episode though...
4250	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-02	To be fair, we will need to have a few character casualties in this battle, seeing as Blackwater just gave us Davos' son (who we didn't really care about), and thousands of extras.
Â 
Obviously we have Ygritte and Styr, but i think having Thorne and Grenn will make it all the more epic/tragic

4254	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-02	Do you think we'll see Davos riding and fighting alongside Stannis?
I think the show might change his storyline and make him sailing to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, then riding with Stannis' host to Castle Black and fighting with them in Episode 9 and then (in season 5) riding back to Eastwatch and travelling to White Habour(/Sweet Sister) - It's a detour, yeah, but why not?! 
Stannis could have the idea with Manderly in season 5, charges Davos with the mission at the season's beginning and maybe before this, we could see a Jon/Davos scene.
And I wouldn't mind seeing him at the Battle  Maybe he's that?:

4261	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	I think the one who slashes the wildling in the trailer is wearing a helmet, so its likely not Stan. Those two white horse-riding chaps could be Stan and Davey, but then the pictures are pretty blurry.

He might be the instigator of the revolt at the end of Season 5. Although I am hoping that Ser Janos gets his well deserved ending this season!
Â 
I am curious about the title 'The Children' - perhaps some reference to hostages Jon Snow takes to allow the Free Folk to come south of the Wall? Or perhaps Bran meeting with the Children of the Forest - only thing about that is he still has a long way to travel.
4263	Ice_and_Fire	2014-05-02	Apologies if this has already been discussed, but do you think they are combining the battle South of the Wall where Ygritte dies with the battle North of the Wall and Stannis arriving in to one big event for this episode? They were quite spaced out in the books, but it is looking likely with the distraction of the Craster's Keep mission atm.Â

Hopefully it will be as epic as Blackwater or perhaps even top that.Â 


Â 
So, do you think that horses-and-carts conversation and Stannis' offer to Jon will be in this episode or Ep.10?Â 
Â 
On a related note, do we know if the battle will take up pretty much the whole episode right until the end (like Blackwater) or if it'll be over earlier so we have time for some post-action stuff, like the abovementioned Jon-Stannis scene?

Aaah thanks, I wondered if it might have been discussed in an interview somewhere. I agree it is a good choice, will be much more dramatic having the NW attacked from both sides.Â

I really hope the ending is 'Stannis! Stannis!' moment. It would parallel his defeat in the ending of Blackwater nicely.
4268	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	I think that the siege and the attack from the south will happen simultaneously and then there will beÂ lull after Styr and Tormund's group is defeated.Â Then Jon willÂ stumble across Ygritte and they'll have theirÂ moment. This could be as late as forty minutes into the episode. Then Jon will go through the tunnel and meet with Mance and they'll talk and he'll realize that Mance won't accept their terms and would rather destroy them and go south as he pleases. Then Stannis will arrive and the wildling camp will scatter.

Do you think Jon will be "sent" by Thorne/Slynt? They're drastically changing that part in the show, so how does the Jon-Mance parlay end up happening, do you reckon?
4270	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	Well, if Thorne dies in his duel with Tormund then there would be no more "acting commander". For all we know the election will take place during the lull in the battle. If Jon was elected then maybe he'd send himself. Or maybe Slynt would claim to be acting commander then and order Jon to treat with Mance. Or maybe Jon will volunteer because he's already met Mance and thinks he can reason with him. We shall see.

Sure, the possibilities are endless. Thought you might have a solid theory/insider info. You seem so in the loop 
I'd have to disagree that Thorne dies, though. I know it's popular opinion, and would be a great death, but The Lord Commander conflict has been set up so nicely with ep. 4's comment by Slynt. It'd be a wasted opportunity. Plus, who knows what Thorne still has to do

What is this duel with Tormund that you speak up?
4273	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-02	I really hope the ending is 'Stannis! Stannis!' moment. It would parallel his defeat in the ending of Blackwater nicely.


Â 
Jep, I also hope this will be the ending and the parallel with his defeat and Tywin's surprising arrival would be great!
Â 
I think, Jon will have his "The Wall is yours, Jon Snow!" hero moment like Tyrion had his "soldiers cyring "Halfman! Halfman!"" moment in "Blackwater" and Stannis'll have an amazing deus-ex-machina-like moment (for the NW members, I think, it really felt like a DEM) like Tywin had in the same episode (remember: Cersei was ready to poison Tommen and herself, but in the last moment her father shows up, rides self-confidently in the throne room, Loras doffs his helmet [so the show watchers understand suddenly, ah okay, these fighing guys are Tyrell army], Tywin says, the battle's over, they've won, he saves the day, Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s happy, epic "Rains of Castamere" music).
I'm hoping, we'll see Stan saving the day, riding self-confidently and badass-stylish to the NW, surprising them with his presence, saying some epic sentence after the battle's won, incredible-awesome music theme (extra for him and this episode)  
Â 
So, this scene:
https://www.youtube....h?v=B1zViyQLor4 But longer, and instead of Stannis screaming "Stand and fight! Stand and fight! Damn you! NOOOO!!!" and being forced to flee and his emenies celebrating their victory; this time Stannis will be the "Deus" in "Deus ex machina" 
Â 
And yeah, Imo, the Jon/Stannis conversation on the Wall would be a very good scene for 4x10 (Episode 9 should end with a climax, the battle's aftermath is better something for the next episode).
The season would end for them with making together the first plans for the wildlings and thinking about the future, Stannis says his super-famous, very important quote and Jon's season's end would be him thinking about the offer, if the should become Lord of Winterfell or not.

Â 
It will
4278	Crow'sEye	2014-05-02	It'll be ace! Silly tart should have backed him more!
4279	King Tommen	2014-05-02	One of Grenn or Thorne is playing the Donal Noye role since we know the Giant makes it into the tunnels under the Wall and is met by the NW (Grenn being one of them that we can see in the trailers). We also see the individual one on one faceoffs during the battle of Styr vs Jon and Tormund vs Thorne. They've shown shots which look very much like the steps up the Wall being blown with the Thenns on them as it happens in the book. The laws of TV drama also dictate that the little kid (apparently his name is Guymon) who says he's a great archer will be the one to take down Ygritte in retribution for her killing his father in front of him.
Â 
Jon will take care of Styr and I can't see Tormund dying here so he either kills Thorne or escapes, wounded or something like that. You could also have Sam doing something heroic in defense of Gilly as well which would be a nice character progression for him.
Â 
The argument for Thorne's death during this battle is that because the show has made the change of having Thorne back early and being Acting LC, he's already in the power position. He's shown rallying the troops before the battle and obviously will fight valiantly during the battle. So if the NW prevail (which they will) and it's under his command, what reason would the NW ever have to elect Jon over him. Aliser has seniority, has been doing the job already and led them to victory (with Stannis' help) under his watch. You have to have him die during the battle in order to open up the options for the NW election.
Â 
There's also strong hints in interviews that Kit Harrington and Owen Teale have given which indicate that the Jon/Thorne dynamic will evolve over the season which probably means that Jon eventually earns Aliser's respect during the battle which would be amazing for Jon's arc given how staunchly Thorne has insisted Jon doesn't have what it takes for so long. To have him say with his dying words the Donal Noye "the Wall is yours" to Jon would be pretty powerful.
Â 
Really, Thorne does next to nothing in the books after the battle. Slynt always was the guy positioned as the front runner for the LC during the aftermath with Thorne basically just sitting around with him making sniveling comments. Slynt has been at the Wall long enough on the show to garner his own powerbase and lackeys that doesn't require Thorne to be present for. In the books, after executing Slynt, Jon just sends Thorne on a ranging in the middle of nowhere just to get rid of him. I highly doubt we hear from him again. So killing him off here and letting him give Jon his seal of approval after busting his balls for so long would be a great way to use him.
4280	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	^I do think we'll see Thorne again, likely in TWOW, but that doesn't mean the show won't kill him. If they need another important ranger to die or come back to the Wall they can make someone new up anyways.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 02 May 2014 - 08:27 PM.
4281	King Tommen	2014-05-02	Yeah, it's possible we see him again in the books. But will he be in any way important? Probably not, I agree.
4282	NightStark	2014-05-02	Jon will take care of Styr and I can't see Tormund dying here so he either kills Thorne or escapes, wounded or something like that. You could also have Sam doing something heroic in defense of Gilly as well which would be a nice character progression for him.

They could bring the two of those together and have Jon feather Tormund as he's about to kill Thorne thus earning his respect.
Â 
But that means Thorne has to live..no point in Jon saving him from Tormund only to have Wilding #5 just kill him anyway later. Either the respect between them only lasts for the battle and he's back to berating Jon afterwards or they become great friends which I can't see.
Â 
From what I can see, it's either this or Thorne dies which kills the tension in the election a bit and we wouldn't get to see him being pissed at Jon calling the shots.
Â 
Sure we could have Slynt do that but I think the Thorne/Jon relationship has more to it so it's a bit more interesting.

4284	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	Well I'm sure all of our Locke questions will be resolved next episode. If Jon's ranging is told by Karl that Bran is dead then Locke might return to the Wall and bide his time with the intention of killing Jon. If not, he'll likely pursue Bran.

Locke for Bowen Marsh.Â  Â  Â
4286	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	Personally I'd prefer they had a more seasoned NW guy for their Bowen figure, not Bolton's catspaw. But I'd also like Noah Taylor to stick around, so I'm conflicted.

Solid reasoning.
But then what was the point of Slynt trying to get rid of Jon and mentioning how popular he is? They could have just played up how much they both hate him...
4288	Bran Snow	2014-05-02	I don't like the idea of Locke for Bowen. Bowen reasons for the plot was to save the NW. At least that was how they were seeing it. Locke would just be doing it for Roose

I'm not sure that it would be all that different, especially since Locke will need some development to actually stay in the Night's Watch.  Sure, Bowen does it for the Watch, but he's ultimately trying to appease the Boltons by stopping Jon.  I don't think that's a far cry off from Locke doing something similar... and, actually, it could be pretty interesting, considering that we could get a Locke that's just as conflicted about his loyalties as Jon is about his own.

4290	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	But Locke is a sadistic psycho, so I doubt loyalty figures much into his thinking at all. We'll see though, if he doesn't die next episode or take off after Bran, then he may well stay at the NW for a time.

I think they've got Slynt positioned as the slimy, evil guy (which he is) that's playing Thorne at this point but as the season goes on and the battle occurs, Thorne will realize that Jon is probably the one best suited to lead and as he's dying, he'll finally tell Jon that he's the one who should take the reigns.
Â 
The election will be focused on Slynt making his political power move (which is his speciality) and Jon having to overcome that. I don't see why Thorne absolutely has to be by Slynt's side as he was in the books to make this work. Slynt being here longer on the show and already being positioned as a power player (they have basically made him acting LC Thorne's right hand already) should be enough to show that he's on his way to being elected LC unless someone else emerges.

I agree. Do you think the election will be in episode 10? And will it end with Slynt's beheading?
Â 
I have to say I'm liking Alister Thorne's portrayal in the show and in this season a lot. You can see he doesn't like Jon but he's closer to him that he wants to admit, and he knows that Jon's right about a lot of things. He's playing the "evil but smart" guy (whereas Slynt is the "evil and stupid" guy).
And how Jon said "someone has to train them" to Throne, as that was (is?) his duty and it seems that nobody is taking care about it.

Â 
I imagine the election will be in the finale but there's nothing to prove it at the moment. Whenver they do have the election, I'm sure it will be much more simplified and truncated than the books (i.e. no Cotter Pyke, Denys Mallister, no multiple votes etc). Slynt will be positioned as the front runner with the necessary backing and Sam will find a way to get Jon on the ballot and elected.
Â 
I guess I could see them doing Slynt's beheading that early but I tend to think they'll wait on that until S5. They've got a lot of ground to cover in the finale from all of the storylines. Better to set up Slynt as an early season adversary in S5 before dispatching him IMO.
Â 
Thorne on the show is a much more heroic character than in the books. He's got (a somewhat irrational) hatred for Jon but otherwise, he's a pretty stellar NW representative. He looks and acts like he should be the next LC which is why they'll have to kill him off. Also, as far as character arcs go, him finally begrudgingly giving Jon his respect after all this time is just too good of a development to pass up in favour of him simply to be a sniveling lackey with Slynt.
Â 
It's actually smart what they've done this season with the Slynt/Thorne pairing as they can allow Thorne to be a smart, strong commander but Slynt whispering in his ear about Jon justifies his actions with respect to keeping Jon down because it plays on his previous hate for Jon.Â  They aren't playing him as a true adversary to Jon but as someone who Jon will eventually win over with his actions.
4296	Arkash	2014-05-03	Damn, if Thorne's dying words are "The Wall is yours, Jon Snow." I would explode ! That would be really amazing !
Â 
I'd love for Locke to get some nice development. Maybe starting to "like" the Watch and finally be the one to stab Jon "For the Watch", but that is too long of a long-shot and I think that if he's ever the one to stab Jon, it will be "For the Fun" or "For the Bolton", which would be disapointing.
4297	Crow'sEye	2014-05-03	Roose Bolton Warden of the North sends his regards!
4298	King Tommen	2014-05-03	i have a hard time believing that the dynamic of Jon's assassination would be changed to that degree. I love Locke as a character and want to see him remain around but because of his existence as a show-only addition, he's basically a wildcard at this point. It's very hard to predict what he's going to do.
Â 
In terms of who would play the Bowen Marsh role next season, I think there's probably better candidates from existing NW guys like either Pyp or Edd who, while not longtime NW men, could be elevated into more senior positions by Jon once he becomes LC. The evolution of a one-time friend gradually losing trust in Jon and eventually being driven to do this over a fundamental philosophical difference in how they feel about the Wildlings would be more dramatic.
Â 
You're never going to have the audience fully on board with Locke being a Jon confidant based on what they know about his history. And I don't understand how they'd ever be able to effectively show a legitimate motivation change for Locke to completely abandon his Bolton mission. And if he's still "working undercover" for all this time, it's a completely unnecessary long con by him as there's no good reason to wait to take Jon out if that's what he wants to do.
Â 
I think I'd rather him eventually desert the NW in order to go after Rickon and then bring Osha/Rickon back into the story since Rickon being retrieved by Davos back into the North would appear to be a pretty important future development.

Â 
Aliser Thorne saying "The Wall is yours, Jon Snow" with his dying breath is just too good of a dramatic beat to omit. I can't see why you wouldn't do that as it makes far too much sense.

If this happens, I'll be satisfied. I agree that they've juggled the roles around a little, so this could work. Thanks for the reply. Cheers!
I do think that we'll see the election in ep. 10, and agree with an above poster that it'll be a truncated version. I'm guessing ep. 9 ends with a "Wall is yours Jon Snow" moment (if not those words exactly), then in ep. 10, we see Sam observing Slynt being a douche, or overhearing how he's the front runner, so he sneakily puts forth Jon's name. Then I'd guess we only see the actual counting and results, because ep. 10 is gonna be so jam-packed that there won't be any time for filler

Jon needs to be more established as LC before this happens. I think the rest of the NW needs to see Jon not immediately off one of the guys who brought Joffrey his father's (really, uncle's) head. Otherwise it looks too much like retribution, rather than meting out justice to someone ignoring the LC's orders.

If it's going to be one of the established NW characters that comes to odds with Jon about his Wildling policies, I have a feeling it'll likely be Pyp.  Pyp's reluctance to join in with Jon's ranging seems like it could be the beginning of a fracture between them.  Or, at least, retrospectively.
4303	Vaelya of Asshai	2014-05-03	Spoiler The episode will take place entirely at the Wall for the Battle of Castle Black, just like the Blackwater episode. Tywin's death will be in episode ten.



I enjoy that prediction. However, I'm unsure about it. The only characters at the wall are Jon and Sam, what would the episode consist of? 50 minutes of the Wall would bore me unless it was very eventful. Unsure whether I will love it or hate it.Â

Jon, Sam, Aliser, Locke, Pyp, Grenn, Edd, Ghost, Gilly, Styr, Tormund, Ygritte, Mance all joined by Team Dragonstone + Giants, Mammooths, wargs etc. I think there will be more than enough to keep everyone entertained in the episode. It's like Blackwater except characters you know and like actually die and there are real stakes.

They are all characters, yes but I meant main characters. There were stakes in Blackwater, and people did die, it's just we weren't familiar with them on the show or books as POV characters. If it is all The Wall, I will be disappointed because the Wall chapters and scenes are the most boring, but I still love them of course. There were so many characters in Blackwater to look for, and the same with the Wall, but I'm not connected to the people on the Wall like Grenn, and Edd, Pyp, etc. We haven't really gotten to know them that well so I don't care. I was connected to Cersei, Sansa, Tyrion, Joffrey, Shae, The Hound, etc as we have gotten to know them personally.Â

Disappointing. I love the idea of the mammoths and the giants. If the episode pulls these strange aspects off the episode will be great!
4308	Vaelya of Asshai	2014-05-03	I have looked at everyone's comment, I'd like to reply to them all but then there would be a pile of replies which would be pointless. Hmm. I am wondering what people's opinions are on Stannis? I see that "Stan the Man Baratheon" is in favour of Stannis, but I have mixed opinions about him. I feel he would be best for the people, but I think there are better characters for the Iron Throne? What do others think? I never knew there were Stannis fanatics and I'm just curious.
4309	Bran Snow	2014-05-03	It has been confirmed that this episode takes place at the wall. Its just like the Blackwater episode in season 2

Then they better fill it with interesting things, like Blackwater. I hope I don't find myself waiting for conflict. I want mammoths and giants and lots of conflict. I especially want to see the Thenns fighting, they intrigue me more in the TV series because of their cannibalism. Ygritte's death I feel will be sad, and I'm not looking forward to it, I feel sor for her.Â
4311	Carne	2014-05-03	Regarding mammoths, I do remember someone replying to someone else on Extras NI's Facebook page. It went something like "We played the best mammoth legs ever! Looking forward to season 5". Impying that they might have had some people operate some fake legs that would later be replaced by CGI or something.
4312	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	I do hope that's the case. That would be awesome, I just don't see how they'd do them. I guess they could do them fully CG or they could put some hair on an elephant and film it separately and impose it. That's all I can think of.

I mixed up some of the comments, but his exact one goes:
Â 
wait until you see the mammoth.....best looking CGI leg ever I was?
Â 
He also posted this pic of him on location in November: http://i.imgur.com/DXKhvO9.jpg. Although nothing revealing, the green outfit further points to him being a stand in for a mammoth leg.

4314	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	Maybe that's why they've shown the dragons less, they're saving up for the mammoths.
4315	sj4iy	2014-05-03	I hope we get the Wall for the whole episode, that would be incredibly awesome. The actors and producers have said that the battle is amazing, so I'm really excited for it.
4316	Mel_Rose	2014-05-03	I doubt that Slynt will be executed this season. With so many deaths in the last 2 episodes of this season - not to mention Oberyn in ep8-, his death will be totally insignificant and no show viewer will give a fuck. In the books it was quite a shock and a 'fuck yeah' moment and killing him now won't have any of that. It could work in the first couple episodes of S5, though - start the season with a bang like with Joff's death.
Â 
I have to say, though, I love the work of the actor who plays Slynt and I hope he meets his demise as late as poss in the show. His quickly suppressed laugh when Jon mentioned the giants, his facial expression when a NW man was arguing in favour of leaving the wall to kill Ygritte and the rest, his smug smile when Thorne sanctioned Jon's trip to Craster...Â  he is perfect as a slimy bastard. Can't wait to see what he does at the battle.

I think Jon will be chosen as LC in the last episode- it seems like the right type of note to end on for the season. I'm definitely looking forward to Jon's bigger role in the show now that all of the other male leads are gone. It'll be interesting to see how it evolves in comparison to the books.

It's like Blackwater except characters you know and like actually die and there are real stakes.


Â 
I understand what Vaelya means. The great thing about "Blackwater" was, that we had actually real POVs in this episode. Probably because GRRM wrote this episode, 'cause it was really exactly as it was in the book: We saw the Battle through the eyes of certain POV characters (Tyrion, Davos, Sansa; Team Lannister, Team Stannis and one, who actually only wants to get safe through it; so we saw also the different sides and storylines) and of course some fighting persons (The Hound, Stannis, Lancel, aso). And Cersei(+Tommen) had a wonderful ending scene.
Â 
Our Wall POVs are Jon and Sam, and they are also the ones who have their own storylines on the show. They (the producer) can't show anything about Team Dragonstone before they show up at the end, but I think we'll see much more of the Wildlings and maybe their point of view at the battle and I hope/think they'll show us more of the dynamic and relations inside the NW (their roles at the Battle, scenes with Jon/Thorne, Jon/friends,...) and to the Wildlings (Jon/Mance, aso).Â Â Â 
Of course, If somebody is way more interested in the KL stuff and the Lannisters & Co, he/she might enjoy the episode less than others (as regards me, I think we have/had more than enough KL this season (and the last ones), and I'm looking much forward to see that the North becomes more the focus, more than it was in the past; the people should understand how important the stuff there is, important for the whole realm and yeah, more important than KL).
Â 
I'm absolutely sure the episode will be brilliant, and the very last thing we can expect is boredom. Three battles, hopefully mammoths and giants, sad deaths, much action, but also dialogues, aso. Many things will happen at the same time and different characters should have "their" moments, I think we'll see many great scenes with Jon and Sam, but also their friends / frenemies / enemies...

4320	snowy	2014-05-03	https://www.facebook...?type=1
My tummy fluttered at viewing this screencap. I'm not pro-Stannis, but I am a total North-and-beyond-the-Wall gal so anything showing what is happening there and further north causes some happiness. Had the same feeling when I saw an Other in the S04 teaser.
4321	Seneti	2014-05-03	Â 
I imagine the election will be in the finale but there's nothing to prove it at the moment. Whenver they do have the election, I'm sure it will be much more simplified and truncated than the books (i.e. no Cotter Pyke, Denys Mallister, no multiple votes etc). Slynt will be positioned as the front runner with the necessary backing and Sam will find a way to get Jon on the ballot and elected.
Â 
I guess I could see them doing Slynt's beheading that early but I tend to think they'll wait on that until S5. They've got a lot of ground to cover in the finale from all of the storylines. Better to set up Slynt as an early season adversary in S5 before dispatching him IMO.


Â 
You are taking the words straight from my mouth. Ep. 4.10 will most likely have a truncated election, Slynt's beheading will be in the first half of season 5.
Â 


If it's going to be one of the established NW characters that comes to odds with Jon about his Wildling policies, I have a feeling it'll likely be Pyp. Pyp's reluctance to join in with Jon's ranging seems like it could be the beginning of a fracture between them. Or, at least, retrospectively.


Â 
Nice catch. Now that you mention it, I remember thinking that it was odd that Pyp didn't volunteer, but I quickly forgot about it. I hope they take Pyp for Bowen. Marsh never really felt right to me in the books, probably because I wasn't paying much attention to the Wall prior to ASoS, but in ADWD he just seemed like a storyline intruder to me and I couldn't wait to be done with his scenes. Pyp on the other hand is someone who's been on my "good guys" list since season 1. It would be truly heartbreaking to see him turn against Jon.
Â 


I have looked at everyone's comment, I'd like to reply to them all but then there would be a pile of replies which would be pointless. Hmm. I am wondering what people's opinions are on Stannis? I see that "Stan the Man Baratheon" is in favour of Stannis, but I have mixed opinions about him. I feel he would be best for the people, but I think there are better characters for the Iron Throne? What do others think? I never knew there were Stannis fanatics and I'm just curious.


Â 
Personally, I never cared much for Stannis until he got to the Wall. I did care for Davos and was intrigued by Melisandre though. Stannis saving the Wall was his moment in the sun, IMO. He became a lot more interesting after that (though I would not exactly say "likeable"). HeÂ never became one of my favourites and I don't want him to sit the IT (he would probably either break or be murdered before his first year of rule is over). I think he'll die in TWoW or ADOS, probably right about the time that the true Azor Ahai is revealed.
Â 


Do you guys think they'll bring the Horn? I was just thinking that probably 0 percent of the Unsullied would think 'yeah that'll do it' if horny Mance were to threaten to bring down the Wall with a trumpet solo


Â 
Depends. If the horn is going to be of real significance of some point, i. e. if somebody is going to use it to bring down the Wall, then yes, they'll have to introduce it some time soon. Personally, I think it's nothing but a big fat red herring.
4322	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-03	Ah, fantastic this was opened so early.
Â 
I'm withÂ Vaelya of Asshai. I'm only interested to see The Wall and Dragonstone come together, as it's a milestone of story convergence. I got serious goosebumps from Barristan joining Daenerys alone. I think us book readers are deeply invested in the story and thus care about The Wall and what happens there. As an Unsullied, I ignored all Night's Watch scenes..still have a really hard time watching them, and on casual Unsullied forums such as Neogaf I see the least favorite storyline is Jon, Sam, and the Night's Watch. It is truly dull. Grenn and Pyp, who? The wildlings - that redhead archer girl and Mince Raider? Haven't seen 'em. They can fight. They can die. I won't care. So for an entire episode dedicated to Jon, Sam, & co - well, sure is a good thing they placed it as the prestigious Episode 9. People will tune in anyway. I agreeÂ Blackwater worked because you had King's Landing as the sole location...which is already the central location of the show. (And I personally only liked that one for Cersei/Sansa/Shae's scenes and the wildfire explosion itself  The battle was generic.)
Â 
so yeah.. bundle of negativity here  I'mÂ begging for this episode to win me over and to be proven very, veryÂ wrong about the casual audience response (which matters more than our opinions, IMO).

4323	Arkash	2014-05-03	There is the potential for so much awesome dialogue for this episode : Jon with pretty much anyone else could be gold (be it Grenn, Edd, Sam; Pyp, Aemon, Thorne, Slynt, Ygritte, Tormund, Styr, Mance...)
And wthin those there could be so much interraction building along the battle ! This will be an epic hour !
4324	King Tommen	2014-05-03	There's a difference between watching a bunch of people talking/arguing in castle rooms or out in the snow somewhere and watching a full scale battle take place in which we're well acquainted with principals on both sides.
Â 
People will be more than invested in the Wall storyline when it's got this much going on and so much in the way of stakes.
Â 
And I think people romanticize Blackwater too much. It's the Helm's Deep of ASOIAF (big spectacle, little results of consequence). I enjoyed the episode but at the end of the day, it's not a great battle. Davos is dispatched with almost immediately so you've only got Stannis as the viewpoint on his side and he doesn't even breach the walls of the city.
Â 
The Wildfire explosion was great but after that, it's just a bunch of nameless soldiers rushing a beach and getting picked off. No one of any importance dies (unless you count Davos' son which you shouldn't) and the battle is cut off before it can really get going because Tywin shows up and Stannis runs away.
Â 
The Battle at the Wall not only has a massive diverse force in Mance's army which includes formidable foes like Giants, wargs and Mamooths, but you've also got the Wildlings attacking the undermanned Castle from it's exposed side from the South which leads to one on one battles between Jon and Styr, Tormund and Thorne, the Giant and Grenn (probably) as well as the little kid's showdown with Ygritte. Sam probably plays some kind of role in defense of Gilly as well.
Â 
Ygritte definitely dies, Styr will die, and there's a good chance that Thorne and Grenn could as well. And you've got the perfect capper when all is lost with Stannis coming to save the day and plowing through Mance's army. To make a dramatic battle, you not only need great action but you need deaths and sacrifices of consequence that hit your emotional beats during the battle itself. Combining the two attacks (although we have to deal with the delay in order to get us there) I think is a stroke of genius. There will be so much chaos going on at the same time and that works so much better on TV than a prolonged siege that Mance's attack is in the books.
4325	King Walder	2014-05-03	It's all good so long as Tormund lives. I'd be pretty annoyed if they made a deviation now and had him die.
4326	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-03	I feel that if we see the election it will end Â the season. Â I think it's ties in with the title name of "The Children" as we literally see the old guard start to fall away and the new generation move on. Â Jon, Arya, Sansa, Tyrion, Dany & the Dragons. Â 
Â 
Now sure what's going to happen with Locke. Â  Since we can only assume Bowen Marsh's actions are from strictly concern about the Night'sWatch he could conceivably take his place if there was more to Marsh than we thought. Â However, They've casually mentioned Eastwatch by the Sea and that other castle's are manned. So it wouldn't be too odd to have Bowen Marsh come in from one of those towers shortly after the battle, perhaps even with Stannis as he might have landed there first to introduce him.

So like Cotter Pyke?
4328	TheBadboy	2014-05-03	I think episode 10 will be better than episode 9
Tywin and Shae killed by Tyrion
Tyrion agrees to Varys's plan to meet Dany
Sansa and Snow castle
Lysa bites it and Only Cat
Bran meeting CoTF in a creepy cave
Arya arriving at house of Black and White
Â 
AND FinallyÂ 
UnCAT with Brienne
Â 
Â 
No way episode 9 is going to top all this !!! Yeah fine Ygritte dies and couple of characters like Styr or Thorne who I dont think anyone cares about. So this will be a dull a episode compared to the season finale . And plus Â I dont think the TV audience cares about the Wall so much anyhow.Â 
Â 
But the high budget suggests it would be visually stunning , but it will lack the emotional impact like the other episode 9s

Â 


I dont think anyone cares about Styr or Thorne , in fact I myself will cheer when they bite. Ygritte is the only one who will carry the emotional impact you are talking about. Compare with the season finale, this episode will be dull  Â - Tywin , Shae, Lysa, Uncat, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Dany , Tyrion, Varys, Jaime, Cersei and LF all doing some crazy epic shit , No way the finale wont be the best episode of the season...
Â 
Â 
And Blackwater was amazing because it was Tyrion's finest hour. Drunk Cersei was the amazing !! Cersei - Tommen closing scene- Kudos. The explosion mind blowing! All in all Cersei and Tyrion made this episode !!!!
4330	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	Why do people think we'll need so much emotional impact as in other ninth episodes? There were enough Stark deaths in ninth epis already, if I was an Unsullied I would be very glad to see finally once a victory of the "good guys" and no super-sad death of main characters (main characters like e.g. Ned, Cat, Robb).
As only show watcher, I would maybe expect Jon to die (since some Unsullied are sure that aaaaall good guys get killed on the show) and they'll make it look as a defeat for the NW till the end, so there will be still enough emotional impact, I guess (even if the people don't care about the Wall, which is really a pity...).

I agree.
4337	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	Moreover, a victory for the NW sounds much more unlikely atm than it was with the Lannisters at the Blackwater.
Stannis had more ships, but they had their "cheap trick" with the wildfire and then they actually hadn't much to fight (I agree with @King Tommen!).
At the Battle of Castle Black, Mance had ~20.000 fighters in the books & +100 mammoths & 100 Thenns, giants, oh, and actually 100.000 Wildlings as total number. 
On the show, I believe, we only heard something about the total number(!) and that the NW has atm around 1XX guys. And even if they all expect Stannis to show up, he won't have hundred tousands of men (in the book he had 1.300-1.500).
So it will be even a greater surprise when the people'll see a victory for this party / side, despite their big disadvantages.

I'm excited cuz I'll finally get to show my Unsullied mother why I like Stannis and that he isn't just a lump of a character
4340	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	^ Same here! I'm looking forward to this scene since I read ASOS and god, I want EVERYTHING! Stannis being the Mannis, badass fighting scenes, the "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!", an awesome Stannis music theme (I think we had "The Rains of Castamere" at an episode's end + during the credicts now 3 or 4 times), a DEM-feeling, surprised NW members, (less, but maybe still) surprised show watchers, aso... I'm expecting too much, I know... But hey, a girl can dream!
I have also an Unsullied sister and an half-Unsullied mother (she allows me to spoiler everything I want and I looooove to spoiler things, "Spoiler" is my second name  ). 
My sister knows I'm a huge StanStan (and that he'll do something great this season's end) and my mother knows now his whole storyline till Theon's TWOW chapter.
I'm looking forward to the badassy-NW-saving-Mannis this episode, but his conversation with Jon later is actually even more important for me. 
They both should see, that heading North wasn't just some small thing for him, they should see "the King who cares"; who thinks about his duties, not longer (only) his rights; who does his duties as king even if he doesn't sit the IT and nobody wants / accepts him as king; who takes the title "Protector of the realm" seriously; who realizes the greater threats in the North; who wants to show the North that there's still a king who cares about them (a Southerner who gives a shit about the NW and doesn't say "Lol, a brunch of murderers, rapists and thiefs and pff, Wildlings, Ironborn and White Walkers, fairy tales, but as long as they don't appear here, I'm not giving a shit about their problems!") and who DOES care!
If we don't get the "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!", I'll be okay with it, but if we don't get the "... He reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my right..." line, then... RAAAAAAAAAGE!!
4341	igrewupinKL	2014-05-04	I think this episode will mirror nicely with 2x09 in that stannis looses in that episode and in 4x09 he will be victorious.Â 
4x09 will be solely dedicated to the battle at the wall, i expect to see the death of ygritte (jons despair at that fact) at least one of jons friends in the watch to die, thorne and some wildlings. not sure if they will keep mance alive. Possible death of Locke (vargo hoat) if he tries anything on jon in the chaos.
4342	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	Btw, I'm quite optimistic!
My motto: Always expect the worst then you'll never be disappointed!
And as long as we don't get THIS:
- Short summary of season 4 episode 9 -
 * Jon and Mance reach a truce
  * Acknowledge that they must fight together to defeat the White Walkers
  * Suddenly trumpets are heard
  * Mance looks outside
  * fire everywhere, knights are charging towards the wildlings
  * Baratheon men cutting down every man, woman and child
  * Mance valiantly fights, but is captured and burnt alive on the spot
  * Stannis arrives
  * Orders his men to rape every wildling women
  * A couple of his men protest
  * Stannis has them gelded for insubordination
  * Finds Ygritte
  * Offers Jon a Lordship and orders him to burn all Weirwoods
  * Jon refuses
  * Stannis threatens to rape Ygritte
  * Stannis ties up Jon and forces him to watch as Ygritte is raped
  * Stannis then burns her alive on the orders of Melisandre
  * STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS!

... Okay seriously XD, I'm not kidding, I'm REALLY optimistic!
4343	Mel_Rose	2014-05-04	I don't know about you, but I kinda like Thorne this season and will be disappointed that he dies. He looks like a decent leader and (apart from the "sending Jon to Craster's in the hope he dies" thing) he commands my (grudging) respect. That shot of the trailers where he gives a rousing speech just before the battle is another good example of how he comes across this season.
Â 
I also used to be bored with the Wall's scenes until recently. With the Craster's addition, the North is now my most anticipated scene of next episode. My Unsullied sister has said the exact same thing, that the Wall and North of the Wall is now what she's most excited about, so presumably all this hype and excitement will carry viewers to ep. 9.
Â 
I really want to hear the Stannis!Stannis!Stannis! He has been isolated for so long in the series and I think the tv audience will enjoy seeing some storylines converging.

This is what i expect. The show runners are a complete joke.
4346	Konradsmith	2014-05-04	^There's no need for that. There wouldn't be a show to run without them. And we're speculating about how the episode will turn out on this thread, not resigning ourselves to a pessimistic view of how they'll adapt Stannis.
Â 
We already have footage of Stan's arrival/charge and it looks quite epic.Â There's no reason to believe that it will be cast in a negative light.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 04 May 2014 - 03:30 AM.
4347	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	@ Mel_Rose:  I absolutely agree with you!
I don't want Thorne to die! I think he's very well portrayed (hell, I find him maybe even better on the show than in the books!). I enjoy his scenes with Jon and their dynamic (oh, and you're also right about this trailer scene!)
And yeah, my respect for him is now much more than a few episodes/seasons before.
I still think that his death isn't sure... It's not confirmed yet, isn't?
I was veeery sceptical about the storylines changes... Because there are some storylines which are nearly/quasi the same (KL, Riverlands, Eyrie, Meereen -> South stuff) and then there are these storylines with added stuff (Wall, Beyond the Wall, Dragonstone, Dreadfort -> North stuff), all these guys who going to places now and meeting people and doing things they don't visit/meet/do (yet) in the books  (Jon&Co and Bran&Co at Craster's; Stannis and Davos in Braavos; Yara attacking soon the Dreadfort), all these storylines which are linked to each other in Season 5, but I understand they have to do this because the Battle of Castle Black MUST be in episode 9!
I was a bit pissed about some things (Jon knowing that Bran and Rickon are still alive) and I still don't want to see a Jon/Bran and Yara/Theon meeting on the show yet (I want to read the first one in the books before it happens on the show, and the second one was one of the most emotional moments for me in the books, I don't want this to be different), but now, I have actually less problems with the changes than a few days ago. 
I guess I simply hate the feeling of don't knowing the storylines' future and what will be the effects and consequences, but as I said, I think now it's actually nothing bad (you could argue about the different changes of the different storylines, but here's not the place for it).
I'm kinda enjoying now the feeling of being "Unsullied" about some storylines, it's somehow interesting 
And yeah, it makes the Wall stuff way more interesting and exciting which is a good thing for both, readers and Unsullied.
I want to hear "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!", too, definitely! It would be mega-awesome and brilliant! 
The converging of the storylines is one the things I love so much about the ADWD North plot. The characters there will benefit from it much! 
Especially when many characters doing things together in the North in later seasons, whereas more and more people leaving KL now (dead, fleeing to Essos, going to Riverrun, aso)... KL is the show's centre now, but in season 5+ this should definitely be the North!
@ Stan the Man Baratheon: I'm loving this page! Oh, and I'm now remembering you posted it before in one of the Balanced Review threads! Ah, and you also had this "Only Mel" thing (with Stannis = LF, Davos = Lysa, Mel = Cat and Jon = Marillion), it's soooo funny XDD (Somehow... awkward-funny)
4348	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	I'm somehow really obsessed with my wish for great music... Maybe because the Lannisters have their awesome "The Rains of Castemere" (and they have it instrumental, by The National, by Sigur RA3s,...) and Dany has her wonderful "Mhysa" (Damn, I don't even like neither her nor this scene, I just think the song's beautiful!). 
And "Blackwater" had really stunning music (I love how "Don't die with a clean sword" somekind of Dragonstone-theme-KL-theme-mashup is), and Ramin Djawadi never disappointes us, so I have huge expectations!
I'm expecting a theme dedicated to Stannis and his host, this theme begins when they show up and riding suddenly through the woods, then a cool music climax when... Stannis stops his horse in front of the NW members(?)... okay, something like that and then we hear this theme also during the credits! That would be so cooool *_____*
4349	Mel_Rose	2014-05-04	^^Thorne's death is not confirmed but he will most likely die. It's just that now I will be kinda sad about it, instead of going 'well, good riddance'.
4350	Crow'sEye	2014-05-04	Â 
I'm excited cuz I'll finally get to show my Unsullied mother why I like Stannis and that he isn't just a lump of a character


That is brilliant. Do you watch the episodes together?
4351	Father of Dragons	2014-05-04	Let's face it: even if there is a "Stannis! Stannis!" moment, there will be evil villain sort-of-defeat-for-the-good-guys music in the background. I'm sure D&D aren't going to change their representation so Stannis without making him seem more like a bad guy before-wards.
EDIT: If you watch the end of last year's Dark Wings, Dark Words when Locke and company move in on Brienne and Jaime, that's the kind of music I mean.
					
					
							Edited by Father of Dragons, 04 May 2014 - 05:22 AM.
4352	graaf_x	2014-05-04	Let's face it: Stannis will kill John, Melisandra will burn Gilly with the baby and eat Sam. And then D&D will show up and rape Stannis like in South Park "Indiana Jones" parody.
Â 
Or maybe I should stop typing nonsense and wait for the episode to air.
4353	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	@Father of Dragons:
I think there's nothing wrong with this -> http://www.youtube.c...be_gdata_player music  With another scene it wouldn't sound such evil / bad. It's probably too slow and calm for fighting scenes, but... well, still better something like that than e.g.  "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" :-P
People also say that the Dragonstone theme sounds evil ("Warrior of Light" at 1:22 min -> http://www.youtube.c...be_gdata_player), it sounds definitely Dark-Lord-in-his-dreaded-fortress-stylish, but I like it, I think it fits to him.
I don't expect any Superman theme thing, as long as it's fitting (and epic), okay. We'll still see the NW being glad and thankful at the end (or in the next episode) and I don't think the episode will have a bad aftertaste like "Baelor" or "The Rains of Castamere".

You forgot that Stannis will castrate Jon and throw his junk on the fire because the voices told him to!
4355	Jinjonator	2014-05-04	I feel like it'd be hard to portray a triumphant victory where someone shows up and defeats the bad guys in a negative light.
4356	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-05-04	Am I the only one who will actually be glad to see Ygritte go? Can't wait for the kid to off her. It'll be sad for Jon, and Rose Leslie is absolutely lovely, but I definitely won't miss Ygritte.


Â 
I'm with you. I shall be doing a happy dance. I never liked her. I'll probably watch her death over and over again with glee. Bring it on, little child marksman, BRING IT ON!
Â 
As for Jon, I can comfort you, if you'd like...
4357	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-05-04	And I don't care if the show watchers don't care enough about Jon, Sam, Stannis, aso. If they'll moan why Tyrion / Dany / Arya didn't appear in this episode, well, it's THEIR problem!
There are enough book readers who will celebrate NW's/Stannis' victory heavy and feel much emotional impact. Even if we all know how the battle ends, when we'll have extreme great scenes all the JonStans and every StanStan *>__> Stan the Man Baratheon* (me too  will have showrgasms and the KL loving show watchers can go hang (is that the right English phrase?!).
Maybe that will be more an episode for book favourites... Well, that's no bad thing - These characters deserve finally some respect!


Â 
I agree wholeheartedly!

I don't particularly mean the credits music, just the sinister beginning to it. They can play that music, then when the credits come, they can play something else, maybe "Warrior of Light" then.

Oh my God. Why went out of their way to hide his arrival at the Wall, then? Why throw in all the decoys, like hinting he will want to attack KL again? To take the hope away from the Watch and then make his arrival as surprising and triumphant as it can be.

Yes, the Watch will be grateful, but many Unsullied viewers will still hold a grudge against Stannis. Like many it her people in the books, they will be blind to the good he has done for the realm and still think of him as a villain.

I don't get why so many people think that D&D have made Stannis so different from the books. He's not exactly a nice or good guy in the books, either. Actually, I think he's one character that's absolutely spot on- feared, respected, and becoming more susceptible to using magic to win the IT.
					
					
							Edited by sj4iy, 04 May 2014 - 09:10 AM.

And who gives a f---k about them? That's their problem. If the show depicts that moment right and does it justice - the showrunners should't be blamed for audience's prejudices and twisted perception.

Well, we have to take what we can get (sadly ), let's hope they'll make the best of it. In one week we see them in Braavos, this late evening (or in my case, tomorrow night ) we can already see the 4x06 Preview and hey, we haven't seen the scenes till now -Yes, it's not the book arc and they totally messed up his storyline in season 3, and now we see the consequences of it- but I'll wait and see.
In one week, I guess, there'll be a new "Balanced Review of Show Stannis" thread and then we can talk there about it; until 4x06 (and 4x09) weren't aired, I'm really looking forward to the episodes and try to stay optimitic. Yeah, I even think there's potential in their (Stannis' and Davos') future arc now!
Btw, we don't really know about the role the IBoB will play in TWOW and ADOS, maybe it's also a bit foreshadowing...
Â 


Yes, the Watch will be grateful, but many Unsullied viewers will still hold a grudge against Stannis. Like many it her people in the books, they will be blind to the good he has done for the realm and still think of him as a villain.


Â 
Also here: I'll wait to the season's end to issue my statement. And the show doesn't stop after this season, he'll do the most of his ADWD things in season 5... also, as Stannis would say "A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good." I will be even somehow very happy, if they see begin to see him as a dark grey character, he doesn't need this blind, annoying "Khaleesi hype" of many Unsullied (which I found boring and one-dimensional).
They shouldn't be blind to the bad and the good he has done, important is, showing his development.
Â 
As I said before, this is the most important thing for me:
Â 


I'm looking forward to the badassy-NW-saving-Mannis this episode, but his conversation with Jon later is actually even more important for me.
They both (my Unsullied mother and sister) should see, that heading North wasn't just some small thing for him, they should see "the King who cares"; who thinks about his duties, not longer (only) his rights; who does his duties as king even if he doesn't sit the IT and nobody wants / accepts him as king; who takes the title "Protector of the realm" seriously; who realizes the greater threats in the North; who wants to show the North that there's still a king who cares about them (a Southerner who gives a shit about the NW and doesn't say "Lol, a brunch of murderers, rapists and thiefs and pff, Wildlings, Ironborn and White Walkers, fairy tales, but as long as they don't appear here, I'm not giving a shit about their problems!") and who DOES care!
If we don't get the "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!", I'll be okay with it, but if we don't get the "... He reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my right..." line, then... RAAAAAAAAAGE!!


Â 
And I wrote a week ago in the last Balance Review thread (http://asoiaf.wester...stannis/page-15, posts #283 and #285) why we shouldn't give up hopes now (and about the seperation of Team Dragonstone, Jon, aso...)
Â 
He'll probably never become Book!Stannis and has his depth and complexity, but he can still have his development, Imo, and maybe it will be able on the show to cry "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!" and supporting him, cheering for him, without people thinking "Oh nooo, not him!"

Â 


Â 
Haha, it's the same with my Unsullied family members !Â Â 
(The funniest thing is actually that my little sister has many "stannical" (as we call it) characteristics. She's extreme stubborn, absolutely direct and honest (always!), very blunt, she's serious, stoic and her humour is dry and sarcastic. She's way more responsible and dutiful than I am (even I'm 4,5 years older), introverted and reliable, always well-ordered and a very down-to-earth person, with no sense for romantic and a very realistic worldview. My mom's nearly the same (Although my sister has definitely Renly's sense for style and fashion ). My father and me are more Robert/Renly, super optimistic, laughing much, dreamy, often (unfortunately) unserious and less responsible, more spontaneous, chaotic and epicures and we rather turn a blind eye to bad things, hard truths, aso (My father's extreme Robert/Renly, I would say I'm more these than Stannis, but not so much as my dad)... I often think that's one of the reasons I love Stannis so much. He and my sister share many things I admire and I'd like to have more of their bluntness, honesty, sense of responsibility, ... Oh, and she knows it's a big compliment of mine when I call her "Stannis" XD).
Â 
I could see (and hope) this! If this doesn't happen in this season, there's still season 5+.
(Although they should definitely warm up to him in 4x09, 4x10)
Â 
Â 


Ah, good point. You win.


Â 
Stannis himself wouldn't give a shit about them

Oh that's so cute that they have all those characteristics of characters! My friends don't really remind me of anyone of the show, but it's fun because each of us has different favorites when it comes to the show - the guys all LOVE Dany ^^ I really warmed up to Stannis after I re-read ASOS but I always loved his scenes in the show - but that's because of Stephen Dillane, loved him ever since The Hours and I'm so happy he is now on my favorite show.
4374	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-04	Â 
^^ Thiiissss  but I just want the "I should have been trying to save the Kingdom to win the throne, but I was trying to win the throne to save the Kingdom" bit (not word for word quote, obvi )
Â 
Â 
Haha yep. Our viewings mostly consist of her sitting there trying to wrap her head around stuff, with me flailing my arms going about in either "NOOOoooo, why would they do that? thats not gonna work later on" or "Aww yeahhhh, did you see that character development mom?! Damn this son be going placesss"


Â 
Yup, of course, I also want to hear the whole line or at least this ^ important part! 
Â 
Jesus, that sounds exactly how it is at my home with my family! XDD
4375	~No One~	2014-05-04	I'm with you. I shall be doing a happy dance. I never liked her. I'll probably watch her death over and over again with glee. Bring it on, little child marksman, BRING IT ON!.

I can't wait for her to die, either!! I was hoping for an episode 4 death, cause she can't go too soon....no way she's so much of a loved character to be episode 9-worthy. But alas, I don't write for the show...
4376	Dany's Silver	2014-05-04	^^Thorne's death is not confirmed but he will most likely die. It's just that now I will be kinda sad about it, instead of going 'well, good riddance'.


I will definitely be sad if he dies now. I suspect that he's going to return from his ranging in TWOW.Â  I also want him to tacitly acknowledge that Jon was correct in executing Janos Slynt for defying Jon's orders (I want "Edd, fetch me a block!" ASAP in S5!) with his curt nod.

  That's priceless!
4380	Crow'sEye	2014-05-04	The threat/power of Stannis has been nicely downplayed this season. He has gone from being the greatest foe Cersei feared to not even warranting mention in Tywin's list of dangers; Ironborn revolt, Wilding army, Dany and her dragons etc.
Should be a good reveal.
4381	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	I agree about Blackwater,Â King Tommen. I hope I can see much more from the Battle of the Wall, and it will give a better idea of how they might handle the also-chaotic Battle of Meereen.
Â 
Â 
Lol, the intense Stannis fans around here crack me up. Â I get it I guess, he's the righteous king of justice, sworn toÂ do what's right, not what's loved. I think he's just okay.
4382	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-05-04	I can't wait for her to die, either!! I was hoping for an episode 4 death, cause she can't go too soon....no way she's so much of a loved character to be episode 9-worthy. But alas, I don't write for the show...


Â 
Â 
I was hoping she would have died earlier in the season too. lol I didn't want to have to wait for such a treat, but at least she hasn't had much airtime while we wait.Â
4383	Seneti	2014-05-04	Why do people think we'll need so much emotional impact as in other ninth episodes? There were enough Stark deaths in ninth epis already, if I was an Unsullied I would be very glad to see finally once a victory of the "good guys" and no super-sad death of main characters (main characters like e.g. Ned, Cat, Robb).
As only show watcher, I would maybe expect Jon to die (since some Unsullied are sure that aaaaall good guys get killed on the show) and they'll make it look as a defeat for the NW till the end, so there will be still enough emotional impact, I guess (even if the people don't care about the Wall, which is really a pity...).


Â 
Agreed. Episode 9 will be a nice change or pace from the usual.
Â 


People also say that the Dragonstone theme sounds evil ("Warrior of Light" at 1:22 min -> http://www.youtube.c...be_gdata_player), it sounds definitely Dark-Lord-in-his-dreaded-fortress-stylish, but I like it, I think it fits to him


Â 
I never understood why people say that. I love "Warrior of Light"! It starts out so mystical... and then that grand middle part *swoon* I'm not using ASOIAF-symbolism here, so don't get me wrong when I say that, but Warrior of Light always reminds me of a waking dragon - a mystery from the ages that slowly rises and spreads its wings until we see it in its full glory before it leaves to do... whatever it is that dragons do. I LOVE this music.
Â 


^Most people started liking Stannis after his triumphant wall sequence in the books too- he was a pretty forgettable character before then. Don't worry guys- he's being handled just fine. 


Â 
So much this.

Reminds me of a friend of mine who took me to see The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and who nearly had a heart attack when they showed the first glimpse of Beorn. She was all like "Oh my god, that's him, oh my god, oh my god, did you see?" and all I could think was "no, don't know that crazy woman next to me... I've never met her before".
Â 
Ah... it will be glorious to watch season 6 when every moment will just be huge spoilers for everyone
4384	jakmanuk	2014-05-04	I hope we get the Wall for the whole episode, that would be incredibly awesome. The actors and producers have said that the battle is amazing, so I'm really excited for it.

Ahh, I'm so torn on this! I don't like not knowing whats happening, cuz all that runs through my head is whether this is book!canon as well or if it's just D&D, but at the same time I got such a rush with the Other scene, feeling very Unsullied-like, and I can't say the feeling wasn't unwelcome
Â 
Ugh, so tooorrrnnnnÂ Â
4386	lostinwesteros	2014-05-04	Can't wait for the it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Stannis to the rescue moment.  It'll be a good battle, and I, too, will be glad to see Ygritte leave us, especially after seeing her killing villagers where the little archer lost his parents.  Would be a nice touch if his arrow is the one that brings her down.  
But, Thorne and Grenn don't get killed in the book, do they?  In fact, I can't remember NOT wait for the Ed, fetch me a block scene, but I think that comes much later, right?
4387	Ser Couch Potato	2014-05-04	Oh, yeah , these straw men dummies! I think we'll get them -> http://cdn.winterisc...n-Sloan_HBO.jpg (background)


Â 
I think those are the practice dummies they were using on episode 2. That scene with Sam going to see Gilly and passing behind the other brothers practicing with longbows. But since they already made the damn dummies, they might as well use them again. Let us hope!
Â 
Also really looking forward to that kid shooting someone. I've already pictured it in my head:
Â 
*Jon grabs a longbow from a dead brother, hands it over to the kid*
"All right, boy. You said you were good, now proove it.
*Boy takes the longbow, shoots Ygritte between the eyes from like 300yds*
Jon be like "yo, that's my girl!"
Boy be like "Deal with itÂ   "
4388	BiPolar Bear	2014-05-05	Who do you think they will have fight Mag the Mighty?
4389	ajmyk	2014-05-05	What i don't get is when they'll have time to put in the whole Jon election thing, and the whole Stannis-trying-to-convince-Jon-to-return-to-winterfell
Â 
The battles will last only half an episode, and the other half will be dedicated to "accelerated" Wall Politics ?
4390	Arkash	2014-05-05	I dont think Mag the Mighty will be named but we know some giants creep through the tunnels beneath the Wall according to the promos and that Grenn and a bunch of Watchmen meet them.
Â 
The election could work on episode 10. I assume it will feature a relatively lenghty scene with Jon during which one he'll be elected after his prowess at the battle and the plotting of Sam and then, after the election, probably short talk with Stannis. it could work well that way.
4391	Queen of Whores	2014-05-05	I'm curious as to how the episode will end. Will it end with Ygritte dying in Jon's arms, or will it end with "Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!"? Either they will go for sad(?) or epic. I really hope they go for the latter. I don't want Stannis' awesome victory overshadowed by anything. This is his moment, and for once D&D can't choose to make him look villainous.
...fuck, did I just jinx it?
4392	The Drunkard	2014-05-05	People also say that the Dragonstone theme sounds evil ("Warrior of Light" at 1:22 min -> http://www.youtube.c...be_gdata_player), it sounds definitely Dark-Lord-in-his-dreaded-fortress-stylish, but I like it, I think it fits to him.


Â 
I do too. In another series it could easily be a dark lord theme song... but in another series Stannis could easily be a dark lord, with the whole 'harsh, unfeeling warrior plotting from his volcano fortress to take what he believes is rightfully his from a young nephew, working alongside a renowned criminal and religious extremist', thing. Yet his renowned criminal is one of the most moral characters in the series, his religious extremist is one of the few people to acknowledge and work against the coming apocalypse, and Stannis himself is very dutiful, places a high value on justice, and thinks he'll die fighting the war, or as a consequence of winning it.
Â 



I'm curious as to how the episode will end. Will it end with Ygritte dying in Jon's arms, or will it end with "Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!"? Either they will go for sad(?) or epic.

...fuck, did I just jinx it?



Â 
I think the start of ep10 would be a good time for sad, maybe open it with Jon burning Ygritte and Melisandre joining him (we see her standing in front of a fire with some snow in the background in a trailer), before bringing him to Stannis. Ep9 should have a triumphant ending.
4393	LEX_12345	2014-05-05	Lady stoneheart will most likely be on the epilogue for the season. I still want to see Lord Bloodraven as well. They can't just introduce children of the forest without showing him!

4397	King Tommen	2014-05-05	The LC election stuff is not that tough to shoot (especially with the way the show will surely simplify it). You're really talking about a 4-5 minute sequence with perhaps another scene with Stannis and Jon to discuss his offer. It will be one of the many things happening in the finale.
Â 
As for the end of E9, Stannis arriving will certainly be the climax but it's hard to say exactly how the episode will end.

4403	Dain Storm	2014-05-05	Since Ser Godry Farring will most definitely not be in the show, I'm hoping they'll have Stannis do what he does during the Battle at the Wall. Stick a lance in a giant and decapitate it.

I doubt we'll get any Wall politics in ep. 09. That one will be battle talk, battle preparations and the battle itself. Ep. 4.10 will probably give us a truncated LC election and Stannis' offer to Jon.

I think it will be Stannis! Stannis! Stannis! The battle with the group from the south is the smaller of the two battles. It would be ridiculous to have the big battle first and the small battle last.
4407	~No One~	2014-05-05	What the hell did Stannis do in that battle anyway? Do we ever read about him actually fighting in the books? I cant recall.

No, we get Jon's musings about his perspective of it in retrospect. He speaks of seeing banners of a stag in a burning heart cutting through the Wildling ranks like a hot knife through butter (obviously paraphrased). 
I cannot wait for viewer opinion to change on (almost) every character after this series; Stan, Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, LF, Cersei, the list goes on....
4408	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	According to the GrrM commentary on Blackwater, in his original script Stannis stuck to the back of the army and barked out orders rather than running into the fray. It was Neil Marshall's idea for him to lead from the front, so that Stephen Dillane could have something to do in the later parts of the episode. Because of this and for consistency's sake, they'll likely have Stannis in combat again. Also, since Neil Marshall is good friends with Liam Cunningham and has worked with him before (in Dog Soldiers and Centurion IIRC), I think he'll give his buddy some action scenes too.

I'm gonna be furious if the ending is anything else than Stannis riding in front of his troops while they chant his name and he is all, you know, awesome. I can see how they'd be tempted to have Ygritte die Jon start crying and everything else happening in the distance but I really, really hope they won't. His arrival is the best part of the whole battle for the love of God.

4410	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	Ygritte sortof has to have died before Stan charges. Neil Marshall has said that the episode contains three battles, which looking over "the Battle of Castle Black" on this site's very wiki will informÂ anyone that theseÂ are the attack from the south, the siege on the WallÂ and Stan's charge. We've seen shots of Jon riding through the tunnel alone with a torch, clearly to treat with Mance. We've also seen a shot of Mance running from his tent while mounted StanStans flood his camp. For Jon to treat with Mance thereÂ has to have been a halt in the siege and more importantly, the raiders south of the Wall would have to have been stopped. Since it looks like that kid (Guymon/Boy from Hamlet) will kill her and she'll be attacking from the south, and that attack will be over before Jon goes to Mance, then she necessarily will already be dead and have said "you know nothing" before Stan charges.
Â 
I do think "the Children" will begin with Jon burning her though. With Mel looking on and her face warping in the smoke (the shot from one of the trailers). Then she'll take him up to see Stan and the rest is history/the beginning of another bromance.

I'm gonna be pissed as all hell if they end with Ygritte. I was never a fan of hers to being with, so if they overshadow my main man Stannis the Mannis' moment of badassery with her I'll riot.

I do think "the Children" will begin with Jon burning her though. With Mel looking on and her face warping in the smoke (the shot from one of the trailers). Then she'll take him up to see Stan and the rest is history/the beginning of another bromance.


This all sounds very convincing, I think they'll go that route. Opening the finale with the funeral seems like something they'd do.
4414	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	Still, I wonder when exactly they'll cut to black. As the newly crowned King Tommen said above, Stan's arrival will be the episode's climax, not necessarily its ending. I listed reasons above why I doubt Jon mourning Ygritte will end the episode but I still can't figure out what will actually cap it off. "Blackwater" had the charge but the actual ending wasÂ Tywin with his line "we have won" and Lena Headey's great reaction shot. I wonder what exactly will put the button on Stan's victory.

I think it will end with the victory like Blackwater did - instead of Tywin we'll see Stannis and we'll perhaps get Jon reaction shot? It would be a nice companion piece to Marshall's previous ep - last time Stannis lost and this time it's much different. I'd love Stannis raising his sword in victorious gesture or something ^^
4416	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	Maybe Stan will take Mance prisoner himself or something. Book Stan wouldn't stand a chance against Mance (nor could Jon) but, hell, show Stan cut a guy's head in two.
4417	King Tommen	2014-05-05	I think Jon's going to be on the other side of the Wall with Mance when the Stannis charge comes (we've seen him going through the tunnels alone on a horse in the trailers) so I don't think they'll be able to have it skip so far ahead to get him back to Castle Black, find Ygritte before she dies. Most likely, that scenes happens earlier in the episode, before he heads out to treat with Mance.
Â 
Maybe the last scene is a quick exchange between Jon and Mance after Mance sees his army decimated and scattered. Or even better, maybe Stannis riding up to Jon in the aftermath and giving him a Stannis-like line.
4418	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	^ "Now if you'd excuse me, Lord Snow, I've some rapers to castrate."Â  (not a serious suggestion). It should end with a line though, a la Blackwater.

Â 
I'd love for them to make a mention somewhere (not in 4x09) on the show of what Stannis orders in regards to rapists. I think it would get the audience to like him more and help the show a little with all this ridiculous outrage after 4x03+4. People are still going on and on about it.
4420	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	^That's the sort of detail they could have in 410 or 501. It would be a good "pet the dog" moment and it would impress Jon because its a kindof Stark-esque hands-on, morally absolutistÂ but ruthless punishment.

4421	Arkash	2014-05-05	I think it will just briefly be mentionned in 4x10. The Wall focus there (which I'm ready to bet will start the episode 10) will be Ygritte's funeral at first and Melisandre talking to Jon. Maybe cut to Slaver's Bay. Coming back just after that for either Stannis and Jon or Election (I think both will happen but I really wonder in what order).
4422	Ser Couch Potato	2014-05-05	It might end just as Blackwater did. Stannis coming through the Wall showing himself to whoever wasn't able to identify his banners. They might even cut to Slaver's Bay or Bran up north, just to give the viewers something else to expect in the finale.
Â 
I do hope we see him leading the attack, though, just like he was one of the first climbing up the walls of King's Landing. I think that's gonna earn him even more respect from the viewers.

Perhaps we'll see Arya warging into Nymeria and pulling her body out of the water in 406 or 407 and then Lady Stoneheart in the finale.

Â 
Nah don't think so :/ we discussed this in the LS thread for the Oathbreaker episode. It has been many months since the RW, so to pull her body out now, it would be rotten and swollen, dissolving etc. When we first see UnCat she should be very much revived. I was very much hoping to see a wargedNymeria, but I feel they're gonna wait till next season to introduce both Jon and Arya's warging abilities
4429	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	They've already established that Cat's body was thrown into a river. I don't even know if we'll need to hear about the BWB or anyone fishing her out. Seeing her near Thoros would make her return self-explanatory.
4430	Beastman	2014-05-06	I strongly believe that between episodes 8-9 we will see the resurrection of Cat/stone heart. and the last episode we see her hanging some Freys.
4431	protar	2014-05-06	Â 
Â 
I'm gonna be pissed as all hell if they end with Ygritte. I was never a fan of hers to being with, so if they overshadow my main man Stannis the Mannis' moment of badassery with her I'll riot. Ygritte dies, just let her go. Stannis needs this moment. I doubt they'll end with Ygirtte, but you never knowÂ Â  


Â 
They can't exactly end it with "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!" though, as that will presumably take up a large portion of the battle. Personally I think they'll end it with Ygritte's death, and then Stannis making Jon the offer of Winterfell. It'll have a proper denouement, rather than the abrupt end of Blackwater. That's the only way I can see all the politicking fit with the battle being in E9.Â
4432	Arkash	2014-05-06	I agree. The charge will happen around 10 minutes before the end. Lots of action. Battle calms down. Jon walks through the corpses, finds Ygritte while in the background men chants "Stannis". That would be a great ending, imo. Combining Jon and Stannis in the final shot of the episode.

You don't think they'll end it with Stan offering Winterfell? I think that would be much better than ending with Ygritte. 
Granted, I dislike Show!Ygritte, so I'm biased.
4434	Arkash	2014-05-06	Too early. That will happen in episode 10 I'm sure.
Â 
Ep 10 will start at the Wall at Ygritte's pyre. Melissandre will talk to Jon and then lead him to Stannis who will make his offer.
Â 
Either after a cut to Meereen or directly after the offer, we will have the election. Both Aemon and Stannis will demand it and Jon's arc will end with his election. Which would be the best move, imo.
4435	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	^It would be cool if after Stan talks about "demons made of ice" we cut to Bran and co. facing the wights at the hill with the weirwood. And since Sam gave them some dragonglass last season, I think they'll run into some WW too.

Or once Sam mentions being able to kill them with obsidian. Stannis mentions mining it from Dragonstone, then cut to Bran. 
Speaking of which, is it possible this is the 3rd fight of the episode? Or is it confirmed that Bran is not appearing?
If Ygritte ends episode 9, I'll be majorly disappointed. I do not think (my bias notwithstanding) that it packs enough of an emotional punch. That boat sailed in episode 3x08 and/or 3x10.
No other possibilities for 4x09 endings? Sam? Mel? Tormund? Mance? Brilliant Dolorous Edd one-liner?

Agree on Thorne. I've come around on that one. Even so, is this enough ep-9 worthy deaths? The Stannis! Stannis! Stannis! surprise has been taken away, so what's the climax? I know ep. 8 and 10 are going to be PACKED, but everyone expects such big things for 9.
4439	Arkash	2014-05-06	Just a thought here : we are not sure Rast's body was burned at Craster's Keep. What about the possibility that he comes back as a wight (maybe in episode 10, when Bran reaches the cave).

He's nowhere to be seen in the promos (surely because they didnt wanna spoil his return) but I really hope he's got some nice moments. Neil Marshall will surely want to throw in some direwolf action and for the occasion, the budget can follow ! I'd really love to see him fighting along Jon.
4444	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	^Yeah, Ghost could add a bit of fun to the battle too. It would be fitting if he ate some Thenns, given their diet in show canon.

Sadly, I feel we may have already seen all the Ghost action for S4.

I think the ep.10 thing that costs so much is wights/Child(ren) of the Forest scene. But I hope the chaining will look good, I'm sure it will - the little we saw of dragons this season was outstanding.

Â 
The Laws of Gods and Men (Dreadfort, Stannis w/ Gattis, Braavos, Iron Bank, Tyrion's Trial, Drogon kill, Hazzea)
Â 
Mockingbird (Cool Sansa developments, Brienne bite, Mountain intro, Tyrion+Bronn, +Oberyn, Jon's return, more Theon, more Arya, Dany-Daario)
Â 
The Mountain and the Viper (Tyrion + Varys [maybe], Oberyn vs Gregor!!, Moat Cailin beginning, Arya leaving the Hound, Dany banishing Jorah)
Â 
The Watchers on the Wall (Ygritte's death, Thorne's death + "The Wall is yours", Stannis STANNIS, Mammoths, all around coolness)
Â 
The Children (Moat Cailin end, Moon Door, golden poop, Tyrion + Jaime, Dany chaining Dragons, Bran w/ white walkers, Stoneheart, Jon + Stannis)

It just seems like the other developments are so huge too. Looking at the predictions (Moat Cailin end, Moon Door, golden poop, Tyrion + Jaime, Dany chaining Dragons, Bran w/ white walkers, Stoneheart, Jon + Stannis)... that's a lot to cover. I'm sometimes worried that it will be too little rather than too much, you know.

Oh yea? That's interesting, that makes up for that 45 minute episode a few weeks ago (ep3 maybe?).
4457	flyinmunky	2014-05-07	I wonder if Littlefinger will still push her as per book or if he makes her jump by giving a speech ending with "only Cat" of some sort. Plus theres no marillionÂ  (unless they cast a similar person)
4458	~No One~	2014-05-07	I've seen this worry come up a few times, and I've gotta say, it's been handled quite well in the past. Most recently, S3, ep. 10 and S4, ep. 1 were a couple of great examples of touching on (almost) every story line without it seeming to jump around too much.
If we think about it logistically, we have the following stories to see in the end:
1. Stannis, Jon, Mel (Davos? who knows), Sam, etc. at the Wall
2. Arya (possibly with the Hound, possibly already on her own)
3. Sansa, LF, Lysa, (Waynwoods? Royces?)
4. Tyrion, Cersei, Jamie, Tywin, Varys, (Margaery? Tommen?)
5. Dany, dragons, Jorah
6. Bran, Bloodraven
7. Reek and Ramsey
That's only 7 disparate story lines. Even if they throw in Brienne and Pod for an 8th story to follow, that is 8 minutes of screen time per group. That is a LONG time, on the screen. 
For comparison, the Arya and the Hound at the inn (episode 1) was just under 10 minutes long. That is including the intro of them riding Stranger, standing outside of the inn watching Polliver piss, the inn, the molesting of the innkeep's daughter, the fight, and riding away with two horses. 
Not every segment will be this long, and some will be longer (I'd imagine Tyrion will have extended screenplay, and we may not even see from Reek or Brienne).
4459	Arkash	2014-05-07	^ I'm quite sure Brienne and Pod will be the ones to encounter LS at the end of episode 10.
Â 
Season 5 is gonna be so tight, it's a good idea to shorten Brienne's arc and have the first meeting with LS through her eyes.
Â 
I think we will see Brienne and Pod hearing about the Brotherhood in episode 7 (rumors of Lady Stoneheart).
Â 
Have an ambush with Rorge and Biter in episode 8 (biting ear's off) and be rescued at the last moment by the Brotherhood (Anguy perhaps).
Â 
And see them again at the very end of the season meeting LS and Thoros.
4460	salmonsnake	2014-05-07	I would imagine Arya leaving The Hound, and then her selling the horse and giving the iron coin to the Braavosi captain to be in two separate episodes. I would imagine, in addition the things listed above, the last episode also having Qyburn and The Mountain, BwB and LSH, wights attacking Bran & co. before the cave scene. The Tyrion sequence might take a very long time if they include much of the dialogue and also have a quick shot of him aboard a ship for Essos. In the episode Sam might already leave for Oldtown with Gilly, Aemon and an equivalent of Dareon. Maybe they'll also have Jaqen throw Balon off the bridge. Would perhaps tie in nicely with what Arya's future is to be, reminding the audience of the FM. Maybe Ellaria heading back to Dorne on the Cersei ship? Generally, lots of ships sailing off to new adventures. Quick transition scenes to set a tone for the next season, in addition to the jaw-drops of Tyrion's murdering and Cat's reappearing, etc. But yeah, 66 minutes is going to be pretty sweet no matter what.

I'd love for them to get all the stuff away first for 3 big scenes to be at the end - Tywin/Shae with the last we see Tyrion saying this awful stuff to Jaime and walking away or getting on a boat, Only Cat and LS. I also hope we see Mountain in pain somewhere in the ep - showing everyone how clever Oberyn was and that he got his revenge after all.
4462	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	I think Bran will have quite a bit of screentime as well in ep. 10. It is called "the Children" after all. His season 4 time will likely end with the line "but you will fly."

4463	salmonsnake	2014-05-07	I think I recall the actress that plays Meera saying that the cave is going to be very very beautiful, which I imagine will also mean that the CotF and BR will be done with the appropriate aesthetic intricacy, hopefully down to the weirwood branch penetrating his eyesocket. I agree, '...but you will fly' would definitely be a pretty fitting end to his arc this season. Maybe next year GoT will hit 10 million American viewers after a season finale like that?
4464	~No One~	2014-05-07	However they divide up the time, it'll be amazing. I don't see a full 8-minute segment going to Reek or Arya, and I'm doubtful on Brienne being in there at all. 
They pretty much can't do anything wrong with the episode, based purely on the source material they're working with.
I'm also less excited for episode 9 than I am for both episodes 8 and 10. I almost feel like ep. 9 is going to be anti-climactic, considering the expectations people have of them. Hopefully it doesn't affect ep. 10 viewership, because that will likely blow all past episodes out of the water!
4465	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	^I think Brienne will have to be in the episode for the LSH reveal. It seems more and more likely that they're combining her last AFFC chapter with the ASOS epilogue.

Â 
Dont know about how it will exactly end. The hanging ? Her face ? Thoros traducing her words with an ominous tone ?
Â 
I'd love if we'd hear a very dark version of the Winterfell theme in the scene. Could be very haunting.

4469	~No One~	2014-05-07	@Arkash, @Konradsmith, I will believe Brienne is involved in the LS reveal of S4 only when I see it! I reserve the right to be very skeptical
4470	CandleWisps	2014-05-07	^^ I think they will be tying in Brienne's chapter with the LS reveal, it makes sense that they would to tie together certain arcs and such. So I understand why they are, but I wish they wouldn't given how little material Brienne has left. Unless they give Brienne fillers, or cut her entirely next season (unlikely), we're definitely going to be moving into WoW material for her and everyone tied to her plot line
4471	Mr Fixit	2014-05-08	^I think Brienne will have to be in the episode for the LSH reveal. It seems more and more likely that they're combining her last AFFC chapter with the ASOS epilogue.


Â 
Could be. Though what will she be doing in S5? Off screen? TWoW stuff?
4472	Konradsmith	2014-05-08	It would present season 5 Brienne with a problem for sure. I just can't see any other way for them to end her s4 quest. Also, I can't see them introducing a random Frey or even bothering to reintroduce a Frey we've already met, unless it ties to one of the main storylines. In the number of episodes that are left, I can't see another way for them to bring back the BWB and inevitably Cat,Â other thanÂ through Brienne's viewpoint.

4473	salmonsnake	2014-05-08	If it's a brief scene that doesn't exactly dwell on what Cat has become (as I hope it doesn't) I don't think it's a stylistic stretch to start (along with a pre-episode recap) with Thoros and Anguy casually riding horses, perhaps talking about Beric in the past tense, with LSH slowly entering the picture before it all fades to black. An unusual POV but not unlike the baby and the Other.
4474	Phil Sand	2014-05-08	I have looked at everyone's comment, I'd like to reply to them all but then there would be a pile of replies which would be pointless. Hmm. I am wondering what people's opinions are on Stannis? I see that "Stan the Man Baratheon" is in favour of Stannis, but I have mixed opinions about him. I feel he would be best for the people, but I think there are better characters for the Iron Throne? What do others think? I never knew there were Stannis fanatics and I'm just curious.


Stannis is the rightful king and the best option for king at this point well at least that is my opinion.
4475	Crow'sEye	2014-05-08	He is such an intractable personality.
I am hoping for a break-up of the Kingdoms, or some sort of triumvirate ruling.
4476	Raffi lannister	2014-05-08	i actully think itÂ will be the fight of Castle Black and with the clifhanger that tyrion escapes

That would be extremely chilling. Like that alien in home video in the movie Signs ^^
4478	Frey Pies	2014-05-08	Â 
Oh yea? That's interesting, that makes up for that 45 minute episode a few weeks ago (ep3 maybe?).


Â 
The smallest episode so far has been 51 minutes.Â
4479	Nikki of House Ringo	2014-05-08	Â

Â 
It makes me irrationally angry when all of those minutes are wasted Â
4480	Frey Pies	2014-05-08	Do you think there will be compelling character moments in this episode (like with Sansa, Cersei, etc in Blackwater), or will it focus much more heavily on the action aspect?
Â 
I can't think of many quieter moments that can be in this episode.
4481	salmonsnake	2014-05-08	Probably in preparation, with POVs of Mance, Jon and Thormund (hopefully all three) and possibly amidst the battle with Sam, Aemon, Slynt? Obviously nothing that would surpass Cersei etc during Blackwater, though.
					
					
							Edited by salmonsnake, 08 May 2014 - 10:15 AM.
4482	~No One~	2014-05-08	^fingers crossed for some great Aemon dialogue. He's one of my fave supporting characters, and one of the reasons I loved Sam's journey in the book. Hope they show it in TVland!!!
I'm also hoping they'll flesh out the village boy/Satin stand-in. If he really is gonna be Jon's steward in S5, they could get a head start on that relationship. Especially if the little dude ends up killing Ygritte!
4483	Arkash	2014-05-08	It would present season 5 Brienne with a problem for sure. I just can't see any other way for them to end her s4 quest.

Â 
I wouldnt be surprised at all if Brienne do not appear again until the end of season 5 (bringing Jaime away).
Â 
Â 
As for dialogues and quieter moments during episode 9, I feel we will get those :
Â 
- Beginning with some PoV in every camp (Jon / Tormund / Mance) preparing.
Â 
And then, during the battle :
- Sam / Aemon.
- Jon / Grenn / Edd / Pyp / young kid on the Wall between assaults.
- Thorne / Slynt (possibly Aemon).
- Tormund / Styr / Ygritte.
- Jon / Mance (Tormund).
- Jon / Stannis (briefly before Jon finds Ygritte's body).

4484	Konradsmith	2014-05-08	^I hope that at some point Tormund gives Ygritte a talking to, saying that what they're up to isn't about her revenge or the Thenns having some supper, it's about getting their families safe south of the Wall. That sort of thing would go a long way to humanize him for next year when he'll need to be a friendlier face. If he lives in show canon that is.

Â 
Whenever they attack Mole's Town, there does appear to be a sequence where Ygritte takes out an innocent person fairly violently from the footage that's been in the trailers. I'm guessing that they're doing this purposely to lead up to a Tormund chat prior to the big attack.
4486	Arkash	2014-05-08	^ Speaking of which, Gilly has to survive somehow. Maybe Sam will finally take her back in episode 7 or 8. Or she escapes when Tormund and co arrive but that would surprise me.
4487	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	I would love for Tormund to give Ygritte a reality check. And I shall join you ~No One~ in crossing both my fingers and my toes at some Aemon time. I spend 90% of the Wall scenes searching the background for a glimpse of his wispy white hair.
Â 
Agree with Konradsmith, Briennes season 4 end has to tie in with LS's somehow, for the benefit of both story arcs and how best to adapt it to screen. There will need to be some connecting element to the reveal other than Thoros suddenly walking around giving a monologue, audiences don't relate/connect with that all. For full impact, they're most likely going to have to reveal LS by means of Brienne, so the audience becomes even more emotionally invested than they would otherwise. As for Briennes season 5 material, I'm worried. Given the popularity of the show, and the so far regualr appearance of Briennes character, I doubt they will give her a season wide disappearance like they did with Barristan. At that point, Barristan was still a minor character (not that he isn't still minor-ish) with relatively little screen time, but Brienne has other things going for her that makes it unlikely they'll leave her alone for the majority of a season. As far as I'm concerned, this only leaves filler material or straight-up WoW material for her in the next season. Maybe she'll stick with the BwB for a while longer, therefore creating some more substantial LS filler as well?
4488	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	BTW all, the attack on Mole's Town is episode eight. From the footage we've seen of it in trailers, Ygritte uses a spear and, yes, takes down an innocent woman by the looks of it. In the weapons and training video we see a shot of Ygritte with a spear and other wildlings going between thatched roof buildings on a monitor. The monitor says 408 on it. I hope we see that south of the wall wildling crew at least once between now and then, but who knows. Ygritte hasn't said a word since episode one.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 09 May 2014 - 12:21 AM.
4489	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	^^ I was fairly certain they were going to end episode 8 with the Trial by Combat, but maybe they'll end it with the wildlings recuperating after their business in Moles Town before setting their eyes on the Wall. I'd prefer they end after the Trial though, with a close up of Tyrion's 'I am so totally screwed' face when Oberyn bites the dustÂ  Â Â  RIP Oberyn
4490	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	^I'm sure episode eight will end with the trial by combat. It will be packed with important shit though and action. I think we'll see the Hound wounded and Arya abandoning him there too. But there's no better potential ending than "crunch".

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 09 May 2014 - 12:35 AM.
4491	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	Maybe they'll end it with Ellaria's screams echoing around the courtyard. I don't remember 100%, but if memory serves she does cry out briefly
4492	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	^I'm sure she'll cry out. And Tyrion vomits.
4493	Hath4	2014-05-09	Episode 8 will most likely include: reek at moat cailin jorahs banishment  Briennes confrontation with Rorge and bitter wildling burning of molestown arya leaving the hound to die and the duel between the mountain and the viper. should be a great episode.
4494	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	Eight, nine and ten are going to take names. I'm looking forward to them and dreading them simultaneously. It's not just the conflict between wanting to see the episodesÂ and not wanting the season to be over, its the wanting to live vicariously through the UnsulliedÂ versus having to seeÂ characters you love die conflict. An age-old one for this show.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 09 May 2014 - 02:24 AM.
4495	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-05-09	I strongly believe that between episodes 8-9 we will see the resurrection of Cat/stone heart. and the last episode we see her hanging some Freys.


Â 
I think that Tywin needs to go first, to make the point that despite all his plotting she has outlasted him (sort of)
It would help to emphasise his downfall after his plot to kill his son has gone so very wrong as well.
Having said that, he doesn't seem quite so keen on offing Tyrion in the show as he was in the books, so that part could be entirely Cercei led.
Â 
The best place for the LS reveal would be the last scene in ep 10, hanging some Freys, with perhaps Tywin and / or Arya nad the Hound hearing some reports of the brotherhood being run by a woman now shortly beforeÂ Tywin picks Shae up for some jiggy time.
Â 
since there is no chain of the hand in the show, I think Shae will get it with that big Brooch pin through the heart.

^There is that golden necklace Tyrion wanted to give her in a previous episode. Maybe she'll wear it after all.
4497	~No One~	2014-05-09	^me too! And I think they will. There can't be a better ending than Oberyn/Tyrion dead-man-walking.
As an aside, I wonder if they'll need to make that explicit somehow in the show. In the books, we got a line like : "why talk to a dead man?" as the KG are leading him to the Black Cells. On tv we obviously don't have internal monologue....do you think it'll be clear enough that Tyrion is (gonna) die, as is? Or will Cersei get in a snarky line?
Hopefully Unsullied think his will be the big death of ep. 9! 
Maybe in ep. 9, Gilly escapes from Moles Town, and is the one to forewarn the NW that the Wildlings are attacking from the south? That'd be a cool cold open, though it'll never happen
4498	Frey Pies	2014-05-09	I am so anxious about the last three episodes of this season- I hope they are able to pull off all the big scenes, especially the Mountain vs the Viper (which might be hard to show in as epic a way on screen)
Â 
Although, seeing D&D's track record and the fact that Alex Graves and Neil Marshall are responsible for them, I'm 90% sure they will. I really hope that the pacing of Episodes 8 & 10 is not too quick though- some people might be overwhelmed by all the crucial scenes, making some of them hold less value than they otherwise would (I hope this doesn't happen).Â

Â 
Maybe not episode 9, it could be after the attack on episode 8, but she's a wildling, she knows how to survive north of the Wall, if there is one person able to make it to CB frome Mole's Town, even with her son, it'd be Gilly and it wouldnt surprise me if she's the one to warn the Watch.

Perhaps some viewers will be overwhelmed at the first viewing, but GoT is made to be watch several times and with a lot of attention, so in the end, I wouldnt mind about the overwhelming effect.

Â 
Hope so. It is 65 minutes, so I do think that they can fit all the epic events into The Children and still have it feel well paced. After all, Alex Graves did call it the "episode to end all episodes".Â
4501	Bane66	2014-05-09	Are they going to try and compress feast and dance into one season? I was hoping since they got the two season renewal it would be for those two books. Then 7 for winds and 8 for dream....I guess it all depends if they want it to last 7 instead of 8 seasons. Man the end of this season is going to be amazing

Â 
Same. Tywin's death going first would have greater impact and implication of the shows momentum moving forward
4503	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-09	^ Agreed. I can see the final twenty or so minutes of the season finale playing out like this:
Â 
- Dany chains up her dragons.Â 
- Jaime visits Tyrion in his cell, frees him, and tells him the truth about Tysha.
- Tyrion stops at the Tower of the Hand, murders Shae and Tywin.
- Sansa has her moment reflecting on her family and Winterfell, and Littlefinger kisses her.
- "Only Cat."
- Introduction of Lady Stoneheart.Â 
Â 
Whatever they decide to end the season with for Jon, Arya getting on the ship headed towards Braavos, and Bran meeting Bloodraven should all happen earlier in the episode (in addition to anything else that will occur in the finale).Â
4504	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	^^ More and more I find myself agreeing that Only Cat will be in 'Mockingbird' and not the finale. I initially wanted it in the finale, but there will already be so many OMG moments that they're gonna have to balance it out. I agree with the rest of your assessment though
4505	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-09	^ It's possible, but I don't know... Detailing that Lysa killed Jon Arryn gives that important revelation time to breath, which it wouldn't necessarily have had in the finale, so I can understand moving that bit of information up.Â 
Â 
But, in terms of the story line in the Vale, we've still got a few new characters that need to be introduced there. We know that Lady Waynwood has been cast, as well as Lord "Bronze" Yohn Royce, so I'm expecting that episode seven will see those two introduced, and the politics of the Vale will be expounded upon (including some attention paid to Alayne). Sending Lysa on her flight might also happen in Mockingbird, but I still think it's going to happen in the finale.Â
4506	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	^^ I'd prefer it happen in the finale just so we can save Sansa some substantial book material for season 5. This is all going so fast, and with the way they crunch down on some story arcs, the Lords of the Vale situation probably won't occupy the whole next season. I see more WoW material spoilers headed our way.
Also, Lysa's crazy self is fun. Though her scenes make me cringe, Dickie is good at Lysa and I enjoy her screen time, wish she would have more scenes
4507	Arkash	2014-05-09	I for one think it obvious that "Mockingbird" Vale's story arc will be dedicated to the introduction of the Lords Declarants of the Vale. It could give two or three great scenes there during the episode, justifying the title.
Â 
I feel confident we will have "Only Cat" in the finale.
4508	Frey Pies	2014-05-10	In regards to episode eight, what storylines do we expect to see in it?
Â 
I expect:
Â 
Lots of King's Landing
Arya and the Hound (I expect a lot of this in the episode)
Theon and Ramsay (Moat Cailin beginning)
Danaerys
Jon preparations for the epic Episode 9
4509	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	^Also the attack on Mole's Town. There is a TV guide summary for episode eight which teases "visitors" to Mole's Town and a verdict being decided for Tyrion, meaning the trial by combat.
4510	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-10	^Also the attack on Mole's Town. There is a TV guide summary for episode eight which teases "visitors" to Mole's Town and a verdict being decided for Tyrion, meaning the trial by combat.


Where is the summary for that?
4511	Colonel Green	2014-05-10	^ It's possible, but I don't know... Detailing that Lysa killed Jon Arryn gives that important revelation time to breath, which it wouldn't necessarily have had in the finale, so I can understand moving that bit of information up.Â

Sending Lysa on her flight might also happen in Mockingbird, but I still think it's going to happen in the finale.Â 


I think the two possible configurations of the Vale story at this point:
Â 
Scenario 1:
Â 
Episode 7 - snow castle & "Only Cat"
[Episode 8? - I'm really not sure the show can or would drop such a huge cliffhanger right before a week's break, then ignore it completely for two episodes; when a storyline sits out an episode, it generally arrived at a resolution point in the prior episode.Â  Episode 8 will be a packed episode either way, but if they went with that version I think there'd need to be something here, even if just a brief Sansa/Littlefinger conversation]
Episode 10 - Lords Declarant show up, material that is some combination of AFFC Sansa I & Alayne I.
Â 
Scenario 2:
Â 
Episode 7 - Royce, Waynwood et al. show up to demand that Lysa intervene to save Riverrun (which would be a good way for the show to have some exposition about where things stand with Ser Brynden and co., which hasn't been mentioned at all so far this season), and also to make clear they think Littlefinger is a schmuck.Â  Since they seem to be pacing out the reveals pertaining to Lysa, she could also potentially tell Sansa about her forced abortion here.
Episode 10 - Snow castle & "Only Cat".

I really enjoyed how the last episode showed how unhinged Lysa was and how it scared Sanse, conflicting her even more. It would be a shame if 'only Cat' came in episode 7, I could do with more of Lysa and Sweet Robin.

	Spoiler I think realistically Lysa needs to be there when the other Lords and Ladies of the Vale arrive, otherwise it will be even more suspect that Littlefinger has turned up and Lysa is dead. If they see Lysa alive and 'happy' with LF before she dies it will be easier for LF to pass the blame onto someone else. I think they also need an episode to introduce a minor character who will take the fall for LF (pun intended!)

Oh yeah a recap with a part of his scene in 1x09 where he tells the story would be good. I think it's important non book readers remember what Tywin had done to her, just showing, for example, the clip of angry Tyrion saying 'I was wed!' wouldn't be enough.

There is this scene in Forshadowing featurette with Jaime in Tyrion's cell saying 'careful, I'm the only friend you have left' - perhaps it will be mentioned there. Or in 'you always hated Tyrion' Jaime/Tywin conversation tomorrow.
4523	Wussel	2014-05-10	While I agree on the battle is E09, I would hope for Tyrion's escape following the trial by combat in E08 (Title pretty clear). That includes the retirement of other actors too.
Â 
For the E10 I would expect some more light hearted stuff. Green-seeing beyond the wall, maybe some happy dragons in Essos. Maybe we get Coldhand (more likely not)? Oh, Varys disposing of Kevan and Pyrcell for E10 too! And of course happy Arya ariving in Essos too! Will they wait with a Lady Coldheart apperance until E10? Would ber a nice shocking event.Â

4524	Seneti	2014-05-10	Spoiler I think realistically Lysa needs to be there when the other Lords and Ladies of the Vale arrive, otherwise it will be even more suspect that Littlefinger has turned up and Lysa is dead. If they see Lysa alive and 'happy' with LF before she dies it will be easier for LF to pass the blame onto someone else. I think they also need an episode to introduce a minor character who will take the fall for LF (pun intended!)



Â 
Agreed. I always found it kind of weird that we only got to see the Lords of the Vale so late. Ep. 4.06 should give them a chance to show us that the Eyrie is just as much of a snakes nest as KL and that nobody other than Lysa thinks it was a good idea for her to marry Petyr. It might also give us a glorious "why was I not invited" moment a la Disney's Sleeping Beauty
4525	Crow'sEye	2014-05-10	Didn't know that HBO do a recap. Sky Atlantic don't do that.
Not sure if I'd like it or not.
4526	Colonel Green	2014-05-10	I must say, looking at the projections we've been making for storylines based on spoilers, etc., the show's SAG cast nomination may be substantially reduced for this season, which is kind of sad considering I think they have a strong chance to win with Breaking Bad out of the way and the other buzzed-about TV dramas fading back a bit (I'm not sure if True Detective would be a force in the ensemble category).
Â 
You need to be in six episodes to get a nomination, and almost nobody outside of King's Landing and Essos seems likely to have that this year.Â  Dillane, Cunningham and Van Houten have two of the first five episodes, and would need four of the remaining five (they'll get three, we know).Â  Isaac Hempstead-Wright and co. may only be in one more episode, based on a cast interview; they'd need three more.Â  Sophie Turner will get seven episodes at least, but Aiden Gillen may only have five.Â  Maisie Williams should be okay, but Rory McCann would need three more episodes, and will likely only get two.
Â 
In the Night's Watch story that will dominate this episode, Kit Harrington and John Bradley are pretty much set already, but it's pretty much impossible that Rose Leslie, Hannah Murray and Kristofer Hivju, who were all nominated for last season, are going to get six (having 1-2 appearances so far).

I never knew of six ep requirement before. I hate SAG regulations, great actors constantly get snubbed because of their ridiculous rules.

I don't think it's at all ridiculous set to a minimum requirement for inclusion in the cast list of a TV show.Â  I thought previously it was half the episodes, but it appears based on last year's nominations that it's 60% or so, given that Dillane (who had five episodes) wasn't nominated then (among others in the cast).Â  Game of Thrones' cast is quite unusual for TV; you wouldn't normally be talking about people appearing in only 40% of the show (or less) as major characters.
Â 
The rules for movie casts (based on accreditation), are definitely dumb, though.

Yeah, but 6? Seems a bit much, especially if the show occasionally doesn't feature a character in several eps only to give them plenty to do in other episodes.
Â 
I don't really pay attention to awards for TV shows, though. The fact that Fairley and Waldau were snubbed everywhere last year says all I need to know about them.
4530	Colonel Green	2014-05-10	Fairley was barely in season 3.
4531	sati	2014-05-10	Fairley was barely in season 3.


So what? I don't care if she was in only 1 - lack of Emmy nomination for Rains when Clarke got one is a travesty. I'm pretty sure SAG nominated her too

Exactly. They nominated right number of people, just wrong people. Same with Dinklage - he is always good but is there anyone out there thinking he did anything in s3 that was better than Waldau's bath confession?

4536	CandleWisps	2014-05-10	While I agree on the battle is E09, I would hope for Tyrion's escape following the trial by combat in E08 (Title pretty clear). That includes the retirement of other actors too.

Â 
At this point, there is no way we are getting Coldhands. It would be unrealistic given the timing, budget, etc. And Varys doesn't dispose of Kevan and Pycelle till the end of Dance, so they wouldn't fast forward that arc too quickly. We haven't even gotten to Aegon material yet, or the trial, let alone let Kevan undo all Cersei's mistakes. That'll all be at the end of season 5

 ... and agree also so much with sati about Nikolaj, how on earth could you not nominate them?! God, Michelle was breathtaking in 3x09 and Nikolaj had the absolutely best performances in this whole season... And then they nominated Emilia - That's blasphemy! :-(

1. Lena, in spite of material being out of character for her and forcing her to just walk around with sad look on her face for several eps, hopefully bitchy Cersei returns tonight. She was on fire during PW episode.
2. Kit, who I always considered one of the worst in the show is killing it this season. He is actually charismatic and he plays a hero with heart, without being boring about it
3. Jack Gleeson, as usual
4. Pascal, very good performance
5. Dillane, because his expressions do more than most actors can with tons of words. And his scene in 4x03 was so good.

@Father of Dragons:
I think there's nothing wrong with this -> http://www.youtube.c...be_gdata_player music  With another scene it wouldn't sound such evil / bad. It's probably too slow and calm for fighting scenes, but... well, still better something like that than e.g. "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" :-P
People also say that the Dragonstone theme sounds evil ("Warrior of Light" at 1:22 min -> http://www.youtube.c...be_gdata_player), it sounds definitely Dark-Lord-in-his-dreaded-fortress-stylish, but I like it, I think it fits to him.
I don't expect any Superman theme thing, as long as it's fitting (and epic), okay. We'll still see the NW being glad and thankful at the end (or in the next episode) and I don't think the episode will have a bad aftertaste like "Baelor" or "The Rains of Castamere".


i would really like for them to give him the actual beratheon theme.
go to about the minute mark. this could be arranged nicely for a victorious army.

I agree with all of you, something like that (your ideas) would be AWESOME!
A mix of Wall music and Stannis' theme is a good idea, but "The King's Arrival" would be brilliant (espically this "Baratheon Theme" part as Chuckling Tree called it), a special heroic, badass version of it (extra for Stannis, then we'd have the "King Robert Arrival" version and the "King Stannis Arrival" ) would be wonderful and well fitting (Stan deserves his own! ;-)

Yeeeees, sooooo muuuuch! Not only my two favourite characters, also two of the greatest actors!
I hope we see the next episodes now more of them both together, in 4x06 it's confirmed, but I hope also for something in 4x09 maybe...
Queen of Whores once had this idea, in the last "A Balanced Review of Show Stannis" thread:
Â 


If they introduce Stannis by having his men chanting his name as he and Davos charge up on horses, cutting down wildlings left and right and giving a look to each other before taking down a giant together, I'll honestly forgive everything that's happened to this character before...

Agreed! They overdid the 'Stannis is the bad guy, renly is the nice one' in season 2, but I do think Dillane gets the light/dark of Stannis and captures that conflict superbly.
But all in all, I feel strongest about the lack of Davos time in the show. We have a little every now and again, but in the books for me he provides a lot of the heart and goodness that is lost when a certain character loses their head in the first one. A moral centre. The show could've done with a touch more Davos and a little more heart. If they follow the books in coming seasons, we can hope to see more!
4560	ToTheWolves	2014-05-11	One of Grenn or Thorne is playing the Donal Noye role since we know the Giant makes it into the tunnels under the Wall and is met by the NW (Grenn being one of them that we can see in the trailers). We also see the individual one on one faceoffs during the battle of Styr vs Jon and Tormund vs Thorne. They've shown shots which look very much like the steps up the Wall being blown with the Thenns on them as it happens in the book. The laws of TV drama also dictate that the little kid (apparently his name is Guymon) who says he's a great archer will be the one to take down Ygritte in retribution for her killing his father in front of him.
Â 
Jon will take care of Styr and I can't see Tormund dying here so he either kills Thorne or escapes, wounded or something like that. You could also have Sam doing something heroic in defense of Gilly as well which would be a nice character progression for him.
Â 
The argument for Thorne's death during this battle is that because the show has made the change of having Thorne back early and being Acting LC, he's already in the power position. He's shown rallying the troops before the battle and obviously will fight valiantly during the battle. So if the NW prevail (which they will) and it's under his command, what reason would the NW ever have to elect Jon over him. Aliser has seniority, has been doing the job already and led them to victory (with Stannis' help) under his watch. You have to have him die during the battle in order to open up the options for the NW election.
Â 
There's also strong hints in interviews that Kit Harrington and Owen Teale have given which indicate that the Jon/Thorne dynamic will evolve over the season which probably means that Jon eventually earns Aliser's respect during the battle which would be amazing for Jon's arc given how staunchly Thorne has insisted Jon doesn't have what it takes for so long. To have him say with his dying words the Donal Noye "the Wall is yours" to Jon would be pretty powerful.
Â 
Really, Thorne does next to nothing in the books after the battle. Slynt always was the guy positioned as the front runner for the LC during the aftermath with Thorne basically just sitting around with him making sniveling comments. Slynt has been at the Wall long enough on the show to garner his own powerbase and lackeys that doesn't require Thorne to be present for. In the books, after executing Slynt, Jon just sends Thorne on a ranging in the middle of nowhere just to get rid of him. I highly doubt we hear from him again. So killing him off here and letting him give Jon his seal of approval after busting his balls for so long would be a great way to use him. this makes sense.

4563	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	I think the two possible configurations of the Vale story at this point:
Â 
Scenario 1:
Â 
Episode 7 - snow castle & "Only Cat"
[Episode 8? - I'm really not sure the show can or would drop such a huge cliffhanger right before a week's break, then ignore it completely for two episodes; when a storyline sits out an episode, it generally arrived at a resolution point in the prior episode.Â  Episode 8 will be a packed episode either way, but if they went with that version I think there'd need to be something here, even if just a brief Sansa/Littlefinger conversation]
Episode 10 - Lords Declarant show up, material that is some combination of AFFC Sansa I & Alayne I.
Â 
Scenario 2:
Â 
Episode 7 - Royce, Waynwood et al. show up to demand that Lysa intervene to save Riverrun (which would be a good way for the show to have some exposition about where things stand with Ser Brynden and co., which hasn't been mentioned at all so far this season), and also to make clear they think Littlefinger is a schmuck.Â  Since they seem to be pacing out the reveals pertaining to Lysa, she could also potentially tell Sansa about her forced abortion here.
Episode 10 - Snow castle & "Only Cat".


Scenario 1 it is, then.
Â 
TWOW Sansa material seems virtually guaranteed for season 5 at this rate.Â  I can't think of any other reason to burn through so much material from a character whose published material is so limited and when it would have been easy to do otherwise.

4567	Frey Pies	2014-05-12	IDK but since this one is after it we might as well discuss ep. 7 here until it opens up? Snow castle, Only Cat, Arya and the Hound, Mel and Selyse, The Mountain, more Jaime and Tyrion, Oberyn and Tyrion... Big episode.


Â 
We were all thinking that it would be the weak link in the latter half  Â Episodes 6-10 will just be a giant roller-coaster ride that will give us some of the finest moments on TV (like the Tyrion trial already gave us).Â
4568	sati	2014-05-12	Does anyone know when the Episode 7 discussion thread is opening up?


I hope soon, I need a place to whine about OC being in the show faaar too soon and depriving what I hope is the final scene of that awesome set-up scene.

Â 
I think what they will do, to keep viewers anticipating the last 3 episodes more for the 2 week break, is have the Frey hanging scene right at the end of Only Cat. Then, in the finale, I think they will show her hanging Brienne and Pod.Â 
Â 
The synopsis:
Tyrion enlists an unlikely ally. Daario entreats Dany to allow him to do what he does best. Jon's warnings about the Wall's vulnerability fall on deaf ears. Brienne follows a new lead on the road with Pod.
Â 
I think it's weird that they don't show Brienne and Pod in the preview- could their scenes be too important for that (interaction with LS)?

4570	Arkash	2014-05-12	We need that episode 7 thread open ! Has anyone created it yet ?
Â 
If not, well, I'm gonna make one right now and hope it opens soon.
4571	salmonsnake	2014-05-12	I made one (hours ago) but it was super late, figured there might've been a slight chance no one has done it yet. The fact that it's not up makes me confident it's not the first. I think some admin is going to look at the section and see nineteen different preview threads
4572	The Drunkard	2014-05-12	I made a promo thread ages ago.Â  
Â 
In the spirit of predicting, do you think Stannis and Davos will appear again before this episode?
4573	Arkash	2014-05-12	Wow, I wonder how many of those threads are there waiting in the dark terrorfulled night. ^^
Â 
I dont think Stannis and Co will appear again. Most likely there is the scene between Mel and Selyse (and maybe Shireen) in episode 7, then no more from them until the end of 9.
4574	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-12	Episode 6 will turn out to be worst cliffhanger ever. I mean it should have ended better if Stannis is not appearing until his moment.Â

I like it the way it went. This way, Stannis' motivations remain ambiguous, keeping the unsullied guessing as to where he is going to land. And, when he does arrive, it will be glorious!

I'd consider showing LS sooner than finale the biggest waste of the scene in the show so far.

Â 
I dont think Stannis and Co will appear again. Most likely there is the scene between Mel and Selyse (and maybe Shireen) in episode 7, then no more from them until the end of 9.

I think Stannis will be the closer on episode 10. Otherwise there is no point in bringing in the Iron Bank at this point. The whole point of the Iron Bank plotline has to be that the season ends with Stannis getting the money from the Iron bank to restart the civil war.
Â 
Which means that Cersei has to stiff the bank before that which means that Tywin has to die in episode 9. I don't care what 'reveals' have been given, Tywins death raises a lot of non-obvious questions that can't be left for a season break. If Tywin dies in episode 10 its just a death. They have to make the consequences clear people have to see what Cesei is like on her own.
Â 
There are other deaths that have to be fitted in as well. Balon Greyjoy was one of the names said when the leeches were thrown in the fire. And he has to die and news get back to Kings Landing before Tywin dies because it has to be a complete reversal from his moment of victory.

Â 
To me it feels less ambiguous and more contradictory. Rather than leaving his final decision open to speculation, like in the books where he's drawn his sword and we get left wondering whether Davos will convince him or die, we have Melisandre telling Stannis to go north, which he seemingly agrees to, but then he spends the next half a season not even referencing that decision in any way whatsoever.
Â 
Plus, if episode 6 is the cliffhanger, that means Davos never has the "cart before the horse" speech. Which is absolute treason.
4579	Frey Pies	2014-05-12	I think Stannis will be the closer on episode 10. Otherwise there is no point in bringing in the Iron Bank at this point. The whole point of the Iron Bank plotline has to be that the season ends with Stannis getting the money from the Iron bank to restart the civil war.

Â 
Those things will happen, but the show, ultimately, is like a movie, so things can be pushed back or forth. Also, no way is the Iron Bank the most important plot point at the moment- it's a long-term thing rather than being something that will play out in the short term. It's best if Balon dies next season, as I presume that is when they will introduce all the other Ironborn characters- it will stick more in people's minds rather than them building on some arbit event that was overshadowed by other, better events from The Children. It also serves as a nice beginning point for the arc- I'm betting it will be the cold opening for next season.Â
4580	King Tommen	2014-05-12	On the show, it's not really clear (unless you're really paying attention to the credits map) that Braavos is on the way to the Wall so it's also a good misdirect for the audience to think that the most logical next step for Stannis is to head back to Dragonstone with Saan's fleet instead of making their big run to the Wall as they had always planned.
Â 
Remember that we're getting Dragonstone scenes in E7 with Mel/Selyse/Shireen and I'll bet that we'll get some hints within them about the next step as well. Mel has Selyse looking into the flames so I would imagine that's got to have something to do with them eventually setting up shop at the Wall.
Â 
I think the E9 arrival for Stannis will have be set up with just the right balance between surprise and foreshadowing.
4581	King Tommen	2014-05-12	I'm interested to see what the "new lead" Brienne and Pod follow on the road as per the E7 synopsis. They established that they were originally on the road to the Wall and we know they end up around the Vale so what exactly turns them in that direction?
Â 
Either they get some news about the Hound/Arya and start to follow their trail or perhaps they are tipped off to Sansa possibly being in the Vale (although I'm not sure how that news would be available in their travels). I'm wondering if it's some kind of mash-up of the book narrative where Brienne hears about the Hound with a girl and assumes it's Sansa instead of Arya.
Â 
I'd really like there to be some kind of Frey or BwB hints though which would foreshadow LS but I'm not sure how they incorporate that. Rorge and Biter will be encountered at some point but that might not be until the finale.

Â 
I'm pretty sure we will have the biting ear of scene that was mentioned in the Foreshadowing in this episode.
4583	Arkash	2014-05-12	^ I'm personaly convinced that Brienne and Pod will appear in episodes 7, 8 and 10.Â 
Â 
I could see it going this way :
Â 
7 - Leads about the Brotherhood and rumors of a Stark girl being over there.
8 - Nasty encounter with Rorge, Biter and some soldiers. Rescue in extremis by the Brotherhood (lead by Anguy ?).
10 - Encounter with Thoros and LS.
4584	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	D&D probably don't like Stannis because half a Season's budget gets spent when he's attacking something.
4585	Seneti	2014-05-12	Either they get some news about the Hound/Arya and start to follow their trail or perhaps they are tipped off to Sansa possibly being in the Vale (although I'm not sure how that news would be available in their travels). I'm wondering if it's some kind of mash-up of the book narrative where Brienne hears about the Hound with a girl and assumes it's Sansa instead of Arya.


Â 
I think it's going to be exactly this and I'm really looking forward to it (Brienne missing Arya just by a little bit, Hound finally getting his wound what with the bounty on his head, Brienne's ear-biting fight, possibly?)
4586	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	Either they get some news about the Hound/Arya and start to follow their trail or perhaps they are tipped off to Sansa possibly being in the Vale (although I'm not sure how that news would be available in their travels). I'm wondering if it's some kind of mash-up of the book narrative where Brienne hears about the Hound with a girl and assumes it's Sansa instead of Arya.


I'm not sure what Brienne could hear that would make her think the Hound has Sansa (or Arya, for that matter, unless it's from the Brotherhood).
4587	King Tommen	2014-05-12	I'm not sure what Brienne could hear that would make her think the Hound has Sansa (or Arya, for that matter, unless it's from the Brotherhood).


Â 
The "previously on" clip for this week should be informative because if the BwB or Rorge/Biter are in the episode at all, the audience will have to be reminded of them here.
4588	hallam	2014-05-12	Â 
At this point, there is no way we are getting Coldhands. It would be unrealistic given the timing, budget, etc. And Varys doesn't dispose of Kevan and Pycelle till the end of Dance, so they wouldn't fast forward that arc too quickly. We haven't even gotten to Aegon material yet, or the trial, let alone let Kevan undo all Cersei's mistakes. That'll all be at the end of season 5


Â I think we get the children of the forrest instead. Or at least up until the point where the series catches up with the books. Coldhands is pretty much superfluous in the books so far. It looks to me more like he is a character being introduced early on who will become much more important when the real battle with the other begins.Â 
Â 
GRRM can tease readers with a multi-book question mark. But once the showrunners introduce a major character they have to keep using them.
Â 
Bringing up coldhands now would kind of deaden the arrival of lady stoneheart because then there would be two undead Starks running round at the same time. Much better to keep coldhands until his main plot line emerges which I suspect won't happen in season 6.Â 
Â 
There is more than enough of the Kings Landing and Danny material in the remaining books for the series to run through to the end of season 6 and into 7. Add in the two big battles that are brewing at the end of book 5 and thats the end of season 7. But they will run out of material for Bran and the fight against the other a lot sooner.
Â 
We have already seen one spoiler for the books in the series. I think we will see a lot more of them in season 5 and 6.
Â 
By then of course we might have book 6 published. But the series will have been extended to 9 so the end will be even further away.

It hasnt been officially confirmed, but yeah we're getting the CotF in the finale. Its named the children, and there was a statement that I read somewhere that the finale has a giant scene comprising of a lot of CGI, and the only one that fits the markmis the CotF.
And from D&Ds track record we know they hold off unnessecary characters and plot arcs until needed, but I always got the feelingbfrom the books that Coldhands is sort of done. Whether he ends up being more important than has been assumed or not, if he does appear later on, itll be as someone else, his actual identity, and not under "Coldhands".
With the way we are running through material, there is no way that the show will get to 7 seasons with just book material. At the current pace, we should finish all Dance material by the end of next season, and get plenty of spoilers in there as well. Everything past next season should be unknown to us.

Â 
The Bank isn't an important plot line which is why I don't think they would have built a major set just to shoot one scene this series.
Â 
Its important because of what stiffing the bank shows about Cersei and her decisions. The bank switching sides is a huge reverse that affects Stannis and Cersei, the two principal characters left battling for the Iron throne on Westeros right now.Â 
Â 
Moving Balon's death to next season might make sense given the limited time left.Â

Â 
I was thinking that till I realized that we have the whole of Tyrions trip up river and the business with the prince and the ironborn sub plot and rebuilding Winterfell, Jon as commander of the watch, the battle with Mance, Arya in Davos. The vale sub plot. The rise of the high sparrow plus all the Danny material leading up to her learning to ride Drogon.
Â 
That is more than they have put in a series yet. Easily enough for two seasons. And if they are also pulling forward plotlines from the other its going to be more.
Â 
Of course they can finish the story in a season at any time: Danny arrives with her dragons and the white walkers get roasted. They don't really need GRRM to cap it.
4591	Arkash	2014-05-12	Arya in Davos
Â 

Â 
Ew... "stick'em with the pointy end." ... Although... I'd love if Arya and Davos ever get to meet, this could lead up to some great moments !
Â 
Â 
The storylines that get enough "Feast/Dance" material to last an entire season (and maybe more) before entering Winds territory exist :
- Cersei, she has a lot of ground to cover next season, since KL is arguably the most slowed down storyline.
- Jon (the politics at the Wall of Dance are worth an entire season).
- Arya (an entire season at Braavos).
- Dorne (sure we'll get to it now !)
- Iron Born (not giving up yet).
- Jaime in the Riverlands could take a whole season before reuniting with Brienne near the end of season 5.
- Sansa and the Vale story arc could last quite an entire season before spoiling Winds.
- Dany (half season 5 before Winds, imo).
- Tyrion (same as above).
- Stannis / Bolton, this could be the second half of season 5 before spoiling.
4592	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	- Sansa and the Vale story arc could last quite an entire season before spoiling Winds.

4600	Arkash	2014-05-13	^ First time I saw those !
Â 
So long for me thinking we wouldnt see the Eyrie again until the finale. Something there for 8, then and it mostly means the arrival of the Lord Declarants.
Â 
Attack on Mole's Town could be a nice scene and Gilly will probably be the one to escape, warning the Wall.
Â 
The Ramsay stuff makes me even more persuaded we will have the Moat Cailin event in 8. Wonder if Yara will be there and escape before the attack or if she'll do something else (Deepwood Motte ? Pyke ?). We will most certainly see her at least one more time this season.
Â 
Ep 10 for Dany : so does this means the Hazzeah finally playing out there ? Or something else (Sons of the Harpy) ? And what about Jorah's banishment ?
4601	King Tommen	2014-05-13	The E9 synopsis is predictably laughably succinct.
4602	Citabel	2014-05-13	The flayed ironborn put up on pikes along the road from Moat Cailin is going to be sick. The two week gap between e07 and e08 is even more painful now.
4603	Hath4	2014-05-13	What is flayed may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.
4604	Colonel Green	2014-05-13	Is this confirmed? Could they just be making stuff up with the Waynwoods and Royces?


Sansa's three AFFC chapters are built around three setpieces:
Â 
1.Â  Investigation of Lysa's death by Lord Nestor.
2.Â  The meeting with the Lords Declarant over the regency.
3.Â  The descent from the Eyrie.
Â 
The Lords appearing after Lysa's death will, at a minimum, cover the first chapter's content.Â  It's unclear whether they'll actually cover the denoument of the second chapter, or just end with the Lords vowing to lay siege.
Â 
Actually, though, the fact that they tore down the high hall set after this season actually raises the possibility that next season will open with the descent from the Eyrie.
Â 
So long for me thinking we wouldnt see the Eyrie again until the finale. Something there for 8, then and it mostly means the arrival of the Lord Declarants.


I think it's more likely that episode 8 sees the aftermath with Sansa and Littlefinger (something GRRM all but skipped over, incidentally, so I'm interested to see how they'll handle that), and then the Lords show up in the finale.

Tywin, like Selmy, feels guilty for his part in Robert's Rebellion (killing the Targaryen kids) and will admit this truth to Tyrion (synopsis:Â Tyrion sees the truth about his situation) before killing him. The situation is that Tywin could never love his own children because of this crime. That's why the episode is called The Children. It's the biggest revelation of the series and explains why Only Cat was pushed up to E5 and E7.

Or maybe Tyrion is replacing Victarion. Here me out. The letter was actually sent to Euron; whom Tywin is secretively corresponding with. Euron promises Tywin support in securing the realm (and not raiding in the Westerlands) in return for Tywin bringing him Daenaerys to wed. Tywin will make a deal with Tyrion absolving him of his guilt if he brings back Dany in chains. You don`t believe me. Remove `win` from Â Tywin and `Victa` from Victarion and you get the name Tyrion.Â

That's a massive spoiler and you shouldn't be putting it out there for public consumption, they definitely want it to be a shock for the book audience as well. Maybe putting tags on that and a big warning so people don't stumble on it when they don't mean to.

4618	Frey Pies	2014-05-14	Does anyone else think that the Unsullied will be slightly disappointed for the week following the episode, as they will be expecting another Red Wedding type scene? Or do you think the episode will be amazing enough to satisfy them (with the one-two episode 8/9 combo) for the season, until their jaws hit the ground during The Children?
4619	Yanninho	2014-05-14	I can't see in any way how possibly anyone could be disappointed by what's left of the season.
Â 
Starting from Tyrion's trial, the whole rest of ASoS is pure gold. Each remaining episode will blow minds, with at least a huge death in all of them.
Â 
However, I wonder how D&D will manage the Meereenese Knot and all the new players, Greyjoys, Martells, and Conningtons.

Â 
Everyone loved the battle in season 2 - this one is even bigger and I dare say the surprise of Stannis arriving is shocking than Tywin showing up.
Â 
Does anyone else wish they hid actors name in main titles? Dillane and Cunningham will be there - that's a big spoiler. Same with Sibel last week.

Â 
I don't know how they will do it, but I think having something like a "race to Meereen", with all of these different people with different expectations headed towards Dany, could give a real sense of anticipation during the season (I wouldn't mind Aegon being cut). The stories of Barristan, Greyjoys, Martells, and Tyrion/Jorah converging in the Battle of Meereen (which should happen here), could be amazing!
Â 
Jon's story will be great and tragic. I think Stannis will stick around till episode 6 or so.Â 
Â 
King's Landing, while limited, will be cool, with Cersei vs Margaery in full swing, and Lord Kevan trying to control a kingdom that refuses to succumb.Â 
Â 
Jaime's arc in the Riverlands could provide some great moments, especially if Bronn goes with him (and the meet the Blackfish). Brienne escorting him could be a nice cliffhanger, or be resolved completely (will be great either way). Â 
Theon in Winterfell will be eerie as well as nostalgic for the viewers- I think they will love it. Although, I don't think this will translate as well to the screen, due to much of the greatness of the chapters being internal. Anticipation for the battle on ice.Â 
Â 
Bran- I think his arc will be used solely for history and fleshing out the world (he could view several stories that are happening as well as flashbacks throughout, which will be pretty cool). End of season, idk.Â 
Â 
Sansa- wildcard
Â 
Arya- assassin's training in Braavos, probably ending with the Raff chapter, with her heading back towards Westeros, or becoming a faceless man.Â 
Â 
I think next season has a lot of potential, and, if done well, will be amazing! However, it is difficult to predict exactly what will happen, since we don't know what is coming in TWoW, and I'm pretty sure a lot of it will be (rightly) pushed forward, to give something to do for characters who have come to the end of their arcs, or to avoid the infuriating number of cliffhangers.
4622	hallam	2014-05-14	Â 
Actually, though, the fact that they tore down the high hall set after this season actually raises the possibility that next season will open with the descent from the Eyrie.
Â 


Â 
Not necessarily.
Â 
HBO has been approving funding for two seasons ahead knowing that this will allow sets to be used more efficiently. So if they only have one scene left in the Eyrie it is probably cheaper to film it this season even if they would use it in the next.
Â 
On the other hand, we have't had much Baelish since he helped Sansa escape. That might be this coming episode.
4623	Colonel Green	2014-05-14	So if they only have one scene left in the Eyrie it is probably cheaper to film it this season even if they would use it in the next.


They didn't start scripting season 5 until production was over.
4624	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-05-14	this episode is going to be legendary
4625	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-14	These next four episodes are all going to be fantastic. Don't think the unsullied will be disappointed at all with this episode; I'm struggling to come up where where Ygritte sits for them in the rankings, but if anything they will be slightly saddened when that happens, probably halfway to two-thirds of the way through the episode. Seriously though how sweet is the STANNIS-STANNIS-STANNIS moment going to be? You know, before he sits around and does effectively nothing for the first half at least and maybe all of Season 5.Â

Jon Snow sounded also eerily like Stannis when he was reflecting on Robb (who ironically is named after Robert) in the beginning of the season. I think they will also bond over stuff like that, or at least it seemed like foreshadowing to me.

All I'm saying is knowing how GoT has treated him so far, should we really expect much of anything else for Season 5? They'll have him standing around scratching his balls like they always do. They'll give him six minutes of screen time per episode maybe 3-4 of the first 5-6 episodes, drum it up as some big dramatic moment that closes an episode when he asks Jon to be Lord of Winterfell, etc, etc. Most of the latter stuff you mentioned won't happen until the second half of the season.
Â 


Seems like much of Stannis's ADWD material featured him playing diplomat and field commander. Yeah, he wasn't doing too much...


See above, latter half of the season. The first few episodes I'd anticipate him doing very, very little as we're slammed with new characters and locations that are much more interesting for the Unsullied.Â

Honestly there's so much fatalism. I for one am trying to generate positive vibes about that scene and stay hopeful. I'll rage hard if they fail me, but if they were to screw up the impact of the scene, why make such a big deal out of making his arrival a surprise.

If only George could even compete with JRRT in creating battles...though for him the lead up to STANNIS-STANNIS-STANNIS was certainly still good. Would have been fun to actually SEE it instead of have Jon turn away back to the tent, since GRRM professes to be on the "show, don't tell" side. I know the cav comes in and just routs the Wildlings but it could have been more epic; here's to hoping the show makes it as epic as possible.Â

4644	sj4iy	2014-05-15	This is the episode I'm most looking forward to this season (although Tyrion's storyline is a very close second). We haven't had a really big battle scene since Blackwater, and they are saying this blows it right out of the water (pun intended). So I'm excited./I see no point in pessimism, I think it will be awesome

He had those scenes in season 2. In season 3 I think he focused on regrouping his army. I'm pretty sure that we'll get those good old map scenes back in season 5.

4650	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-05-17	I assume this is gonna be the episode with the least number of the main cast so far.

The list of the most certain appearances:

- John Bradley (Sam Tarly)
- Rose Leslie (Ygritte)
- Kristofer Hivju (Tormund Giantsbane)
- Hanna Murray (Gilly)
- Stephen Dillane (Stannis Baratheon)
- Carice van Houten (Melisandre)
Â 
The characters for I don't think will appear, but could:
- Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth)
- Issac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark)
Â 
I think Ygritte will be shot down by an arrow from that kid whom she shot his father down. Styr will most likely die from the fall, just like he did in the book. And I would like to see Melisandre burning an owl of that Thenn Warg (who is portraited by Joseph Gatt).

4657	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-17	I think that Davos stayed at Eastwatch and left for White Harbor from there when Stannis send the orders from Castle Black.

Yes, he said in Davos II in ADWD he stayed with Selyse, Axell Florent (his story with the king's ape), Shireen, Salladhor and others at Eastwatch, before he and Salla & Co. began to sail to White Harbor.
We don't know when Stannis gave Davos the order, but I think on the show it will be after they all arrived and fought at The Wall.
So, Davos will -hopefully- fight alongside Stannis, then stay at the Wall the rest of this season, till Stannis gives him the Manderly-mission at the beginning of season 5 (my prediction). Maybe we'll see a Stannis/Jon/Davos talk about Stark vassals and then they mention White Harbor and that it's the North's primary trade port, its richness and importance and they won't introduce or mention the Manderlys till next season.
Liam is also listed for this episode on imdh: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060858/ (Don't know why there's Peter Dinklage, but imdb has often such mistakes).
I'm such Mel will be there, too. I actually thought, the last time I checked this imdb page it had also listed Carice... But she already talked about scenes on a horseback and a stunt woman / double and a scene with her burning the Thenn Warg's bird would look very cool!

4660	King Tommen	2014-05-17	Stannis leading the charge with his men (similarly to Blackwater) would be great and I think the show will have Davos with him. I don't see how they'd want to avoid giving Mel a big moment here as one of Stannis' secret weapons, that's just too perfect to not use.

They've already got her burning Orell's eagle in the books as a reference point so showing her having a moment where she uses her powers in the battle should be a gimme, IMO.

4666	King Tommen	2014-05-17	Everything that's happened this season with that little boy has screamed out "he's killing Ygritte". She murdered his father in front of him, he's joined up with the NW and he just happened to mention to Jon that he's the best archer in his village. It's a done deal.
4667	xandi	2014-05-17	My money is on the boy, otherwise why the major foreshadowing?
4668	Konradsmith	2014-05-17	BTW according to GoT wiki and Wikipedia the boy is meant to be named "Olly". It was his father who was named "Guymon".
Â 
And, yeah, he'sÂ definitely killing Ygritte.

I don't think so, I think it's just a really, really good fan art. Either way I cheered loudly when I saw the last one.
4672	Arkash	2014-05-17	Yeah, the boy's name is Olly, Jon said so when he mentioned he was the best archer in the hamlet.
Â 
I wonder if Jon will know / see it's him who kills Ygritte.

These next four episodes are all going to be fantastic. Don't think the unsullied will be disappointed at all with this episode; I'm struggling to come up where where Ygritte sits for them in the rankings, but if anything they will be slightly saddened when that happens, probably halfway to two-thirds of the way through the episode. Seriously though how sweet is the STANNIS-STANNIS-STANNIS moment going to be? You know, before he sits around and does effectively nothing for the first half at least and maybe all of Season 5.Â

I hope he doesn't. I liked how ambiguous it was in the books, and it would be great to keep it that way. Although it's different in a show.
If spec about Olly being Jon's showSatin are correct, it would create a weird dynamic if Jon knew he'd killed his ex.

Â 
The show lost all semblance of subtlety it seems though. If they don't show explicitly who fired the arrow (possibly with reaction shots and all) then someone will right out say who it was in the following episode.
Â 
Liberace was more subdued than the symbolism in the show.

I agree. But I can also maintain hope. *sigh* They can show Olly killing her all day long, as long as Jon doesn't see. #fingerscrossed
4677	King Tommen	2014-05-18	I don't think it's a bad thing to show the sequence of Ygritte's death. The show isn't locked into the POV structure and we don't always absolutely have to only see things through Jon's eyes.
Â 
I didn't particularly think it was an amazing choice by George to have her shot offscreen and have Jon discover her later. Just because that's the way they portrayed it in the books doesn't always make it the best way to go about things.
Â 
It's far more powerful to give you the boy's POV in this sequence where he spots her as part of the raid and is focused on finally getting his shot at her (being the [person who ruthlessly murdered his father in front of him).
Â 
That to me, is a way better option than Jon sifting through the aftermath and saying "hey look at this, somehow Ygritte got taken out in the chaos, guess I'll say my goodbyes now"
4678	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-18	Â 
That to me, is a way better option than Jon sifting through the aftermath and saying "hey look at this, somehow Ygritte got taken out in the chaos, guess I'll say my goodbyes now"


Â 
Tv is a different medium, so not everything works like in the books, agreed. But the issue is the uncertainty of Jon knowing and him having to live with it. The way the show would go about is that someone flat out spells it out for him, thus just taking away from the gravity of the fact, tv-show or not.
Â 
The important part is still Jon and Ygritte being on different sides of a conflict where either one or both can get killed. If they go with the revenge thing at least they should leave Jon be uncertain and the audience uncertain if he knows.
4679	King Tommen	2014-05-18	I didn't really feel like in the books the big conflict with Jon was whether he thought he was the one who might have killed Ygritte. It was the melancholy with knowing that this was more or less inevitable (them being on opposite sides and her being apart of the Wildling attack) and his regret about what could have been between them.
Â 
He's despondent that she died but I don't think the possibility that he killed her is that haunting for him.

Â

Â 
Well that's what I meant by them being of both sides of a conflict. They obviously loved each other but they were still enemies, so it couldn't really end well. And Jon knew it. Him finding her dead still had an impact on him since he was in charge and no matter what NW brother of his shot her, it still felt like it was his direct input. The tragedy is that he felt guilty either way, but hoped that it wasn't him who actually shot her. It's basically the slightly less of two evils.
Â 
Or at least that's what I took away from it.

Â 
Â 
You're right and I hope it goes that way. Only thing I wonder : what's gonna stop him from finishing her ? Yeah, a small detail I know, but I'm really curious about how Ygritte's death will play out in the show.

Â 


Â 
The other thing they could do on the show (which I would like less but could see them doing) is have a sequence where Jon has Ygritte in a prone position but can't bring himself to take her out. She takes that opportunity to turn the tide on him somehow and shows that she doesn't have any qualms about doing the same to him and the boy takes her out from distance at the last moment. That's more of a cliche and I hope they don't go that way. I'd prefer if she and Jon don't interact during the battle at all until her final moments and the boy is the one that's tracking her without her even realizing it before it's too late.
4683	jacob_stark	2014-05-19	If this is the great Mance battle where Stannis shows up, what about Ygritte and the Thenns south of the wall? Are they going to deal with them both in the same episode? That feels a little close.
4684	The Drunkard	2014-05-19	Mance's show-plan is to have the southern group attack Castle Black at the same time as his group. So they'll both be dealt with in the one episode, yeah.
4685	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-19	Yeah they're gonna condense both battles into one big one otherwise they would probably spend the budget of a whole season on that episode alone.
4686	flyerhawk	2014-05-19	So we get Ygritte's death scene at the end of this episode and the election in Ep. 10? Â That seems to make the most sense.

Â 
What others said. It looks like that group shows up in Mole'sÂ  Town next week.
4689	~No One~	2014-05-19	King Tommen , I wholeheartedly agree that we need to see the sequence. I think you may have misunderstood what I was trying to say. If Olly is indeed the one who kills Ygritte, I feel that it would harm the Jon-Olly dynamic if Jon was aware of that fact. I'm not holding my breath for a book-identical version. I've long given up on that 
Hopefully I've explained it a bit better.
4690	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-19	So we get Ygritte's death scene at the end of this episode and the election in Ep. 10? Â That seems to make the most sense.


I'd reckon we get Ygritte dying halfway-two thirds through the ep. We still need to have Jon be commanded to go to the tent, probably a <5 minute scene, followed by Jon in the tent, also probably a <5 minute scene. Then I'd expect Stannis' arrival to be about a minute and a half to end the episode. LC election should be lumped into all the cool stuff in episode 10.
4691	King Tommen	2014-05-19	And if you think about it, Mance having the attacks occurring simultaneously is the most effective battle strategy as it stretches the NW even more thin and increases your chances of having the Southern attack succeed to open the gates (which is really the key to winning this battle and can only really be achieved by a southern attack).
Â 
If the events happened this way in the book and the show decided to have the Southern attack happen early and play out as it does in the books, readers would question the logic behind doing it this way and say the showrunners were stupid for splitting up the best battle of the 3rd book.

Right on. High hopes for this episode and I think they'll mostly be met. I really am curious to see how/if they show any actual fighting at the top of the wall or if it is just concentrated on defending the gate from both sides+the skirmish for CB.
Either way, can't wait to see Helm's Deep 2.0 be adapted to the screen.Â

It's probably my most anticipated episode ever. Â Absolutely excited for it. Â I agree that they will probably attack simultaneously...it was something I felt should have been done in the books, so I can't see why they won't do it here.
4694	King Tommen	2014-05-19	Can someone refresh my memory and explain why exactly Styr, Ygritte and the gang attacked so early in the books when Mance wasn't even in position yet? Was the idea that they would wipe out everyone at Castle Black and do all the work so when Mance showed up with his gigantic army, they would open the gates for them and say "job's already done"?
Â 
If you only needed ~20 Wildlings to scale the Wall and sneak around back to get you through the Wall, why go to the trouble of amassing a huge army and joining all the Wildling tribes together? Or if you know that this small of a group wasn't going to get the job done without help, why send them well ahead of your arrival so the NW has the chance to defend the Wall and defeat before you're even there to do anything?

Â 
Yeah, that was the idea. The NW was able to beat the Thenns attack because Jon told them about it, something Mance didn't account for. It was not possible for him to predict that Jon would be able to escape the wildling group (thanks to Bran and the direwolves). Mance's plan was:
Â 
1. Send a wildling group South of the Wall.
2. Wildling group attacks Castle Black from the South. The NW is completly caught off guard and the Thenns easily take over the castle. Pratically no casualty for the wildlings.
3. They open the gate. Wildling army is now South of the Wall
4. Wildling army go South.
Â 
Jon going back to CB screwed that plan. So, Mance went to Plan B: Siege the Wall.

Which begs the question: Where exactly was Mance and his huge army planning on going after getting through the Wall. Just a general march South to try and conquer the realm? Sweet plan.

	Spoiler Actually, Tywin will kill Tyrion and then he will flee to Daenerys. That's why Tywin in 4x06 wrote a letter to Meereen, so he could rat out Jorah and take his spot. Tywin, like Selmy, feels guilty for his part in Robert's Rebellion (killing the Targaryen kids) and will admit this truth to Tyrion (synopsis:Â Tyrion sees the truth about his situation) before killing him. The situation is that Tywin could never love his own children because of this crime. That's why the episode is called The Children. It's the biggest revelation of the series and explains why Only Cat was pushed up to E5 and E7.

4700	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	I don't remember who it was in the book that was yammering on about King Robert coming to save them but I think that would be a cool little detail to include in the show. I can picture Sam or Edd saying about whoever they give the line to, maybe the kid Olly, "I don't have the heart to tell him Robert's dead."
Â 
Then it could be used at the end of the episode from atop the Wall.
Â 
Olly/Whoever: Is that King Robert?
Â 
Sam: No. It's his brother.
4701	LordCouture	2014-05-19	It was Jon who thought for a second that it was Robert.

Floating above them were the largest banners yet, royal standards as big as sheets; aÂ 
yellow one with long pointed tongues that showed a flaming heart, and another like a sheet ofÂ 
beaten gold, with a black stag prancing and rippling in the wind.Â 
Â Robert, Jon thought for one mad moment, remembering poor Owen, but when the trumpetsÂ 
blew again and the knights charged, the name they cried was â<U+0080><U+009C>Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!â<U+0080><U+009D>Â

Episode ten will be crowded as fuck as it is and there's no point leaving the battle unfinished until the finale. They're dedicating the entire episode to the battle, so it stands to reason that they'll takeÂ show its entirety.

They were putting the talking to Davos, that is his ability, people skills, of which Stannis has none. Tactics and strategy, that's all Stannis. He is perhaps the best field commander in Westeros. He doesn't need a smuggler to plan his battles.
4711	Scorched_Air	2014-05-20	Haldir, yeah I read the books that is why I made this prediction. Because that is how it happened in the books,

I won't say Stannis doesnt know have any people skills. Who convinces the clans to join him? Maybe you'll say it's horpe or massey, but I still thinks Stannis has the ability to talk.

From the books, it;'s the Jon Snow/Lord Commander introduction, and the offer of real power against the Bolton's/Iron Born, not Stannis personality. It's an easy sell.
From the show, Stannis fails utterly due to his lack of people skill with the bank, they cannot envisage anything he can offer. It is over, yet Davos jumps in last minute (and breaking curtsey by speaking without the leave of his liege) and turns things around a full 180Â° by his tongue, saving Stannis.

I really really wish theres mammoth, but think, if there are mammoths in the show, why didnt they boast it in the trailer? There are giants, dragons, horsmen, and meeren's freakish large pyramid, why not mammoths too? So maybe there are none. its a pity. Battle of the wall is probably the best battle Westeros has ever seen. maybe better than the field of fire.Â

Remind me, did Jon write some letters to mountain chiefs presenting Stannis? I think there none. And yes, maybe Bolton/Ironborn problem is one of the big reasons why they join, but Mountain chiefs wont follow just some southron guy with a small army for that.Personality is a factor because they would want to learn if that person has respect for them, would drink with them, and if that guy has balls against the Boltons.
Â 
From the show as well, Stannis give Davos a look as if, "your time is running out smuggler, think of something!". And I think it shouldn't be that way. And what Davos has said can be uttered by BookStannis himself if he wants to. Maybe he wont because of his pride, but still, I think the show undermines Stannis' capabilities.Â

Jon Snow makes the intro, not sure how wordy his letters were, if he wrote any. But the introduction was through him. Without real power to repel the Iron Born and deny the Boltons the clans wouldn't be able to do anything. Stannis' personality strength lies in his intractability, that is not people skills. The very intractability that the wordsmith Davos can play on at the bank. Stannis isn't able to win people by words, that is quite clear from both book and show. He believes his actions should be enough.
Â 
Stannis could have said similar to Davos if his personality at allowed it (which it wouldn't for reasons above), but it wouldn't have worked. Stannis has an innate ability to irritate pe9ople with his bluff manner. He has one course, blunt and rough like a true born Yorkshireman. Which might be why he has an affected Yorkshire accent.

Jon says not to beg but drink with them, compliment them on the beauty of their daughters etc and they would support him and even that he didn't want to do but grudgingly did so because it would be stupid to turn down 3000 men. TheÂ situation in the show and books is different. In the show he was required to persuade the iron bank and in the book scenario he was simply required to be hospitable.Â The former is not a strongpoint of Stannis. Robert was always the one who was noted for turning foes to friends. Stannis simply expects people to do their duty and obey the law. There is a reason Stannis sends Davos to rally Northern lords while he tends to the military side of things.Â

I can't quite recall, but there is a quote by Tyrion that touches on the personalty (the rough edge) of Stannis in an earlier series. Series 2 I suppose. But am not sure.
4719	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-20	About Stannis, Davos, people skills and abilities (I know that isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a Stannis thread, but nevertheless, I always wanted to write this):
Â 
Â 
What I really loved about their scene with the Iron Bank was that before Davos gave his speech, Tycho said to him:
â<U+0080><U+009C>Here in Braavos, we do not reward thieves with titlesâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a situation Davos experiences all the time since he became a knight and actually -before Stannis makes him to his hand!- he never stands up to those who insult him with â<U+0080><U+009C>smugglerâ<U+0080><U+009D>, â<U+0080><U+009C>thiefâ<U+0080><U+009D> or whatever. Nearly quite the opposite, he knows himself and always says that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an up jumped smuggler and will never forget his origin. His own sons said something like â<U+0080><U+009C>If you donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see yourself as a knight, how should others do this?â<U+0080><U+009D>
And I think Davos never saw himself as a knight, he will maybe never see himself as a lord, but he absolutely begins to see himself as the Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Hand! (Which is why I disagree, when people say Davos is one of the few characters who doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t change with the books, 'cause he does).
Â 
If somebody as Axell Florent or another of Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> lords insults him, laughs about him or talks behind his back, he has not so much problems with this, his own pride and his position doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter for him, but as Hand he knows he has to represents Stannis, his king without many things to offer to others, and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s absolutely good in convincing people, we see that also with Lord Borrell and of course Lord Manderly.
Â 
At the Mermanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Court Davos thinks:

Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>The Onion Knight would have bend his knee, but a kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand could not; to do so would suggest that the king he served was less than this fat lord.â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
They (Manderlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s court) also insult him as smuggler and his answer is very similar to his answer to Tycho.
Davos doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind being reminded of his former crimes, but if somebody says Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> treatment with him was wrong, then he disagrees heavy, because that insults not him, but his king. As Hand he has to show strength and stand up against the lords (who see him as â<U+0080><U+009C>the admirals without shipsâ<U+0080><U+009D> / â<U+0080><U+009C>hand without fingersâ<U+0080><U+009D> and Stannis as â<U+0080><U+009C>the king without throneâ<U+0080><U+009D> who canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t offer anything), and he does for Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> sake.
Davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> titles werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t very important for him in the past, after heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s made Hand he insists on them, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s very aware of his worth (remember Axellâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story with the apeâ<U+0080>¦) and hierachy levels with other highborns; in ASOS he felt he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fitting as Hand -> Stannis says thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no man more fitting -> in ADWD, Davos improves that all the time.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Here in Braavos, we do not reward thieves with titlesâ<U+0080><U+009D> is something Davos cannot let unanswered because this insults Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> justice, and his punishment+reward is everything for Davos, same as his kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s justice.
Â 
So the scene at the Iron Bank is actually similar to the chapter with Manderly's court, and the show shows Davos ability in talking and convincing, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his talent, and he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t manage this with flattering and courtesies, he manages it with his good people skills (he says he learnt reading people before learning to read words) and as a smuggler and man from Flea Bottom he never had a lot of resources, yet always known how to make the most of them, whether itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s onions or arguments for supporting Stannis!
Â 
And as hand you have to speak with your kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s voice which is Davos totally able to (We also see this at Sweet Sister and White Harbor when he lies about Sallaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s support but thinks heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d tell the truth about the burnt godwoods because he knows, Stannis would not have him lie).
And thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also this scene where Wyman asks, what could Stannis offer to them, and Davos answers:

Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>The chance to do your dutyâ<U+0080><U+009D> (â<U+0080>¦) That was the answer Stannis would have given Wyman Manderly. The Hand should speak with the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s voice.

Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s EXACT the answer Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>d have given, but it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t enough for Manderly and later Davos gives his wonderful â<U+0080><U+009C>vengeance speechâ<U+0080><U+009D> (God, I LOVE this chapter so much!)
Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s why Davos and Stannis are such a great wonderful team and make the best king/hand couple, they strengths and weaknesses compensate each other; I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind the 4x06 scene (I loved it!), but I definitely wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind showing Davos as charge leader / attack planer / a.s.o (but which wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t happen, anyway)!
Â 
The show definitely undermines Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> capabilities, yes, especially when it comes to making decisions by his own, but I want to say that his talents lie in other areas.
Â 
I always wanted to read/see how he convinced the Mountain Clans, if he really ate their bread, drank their ale, praised their sonsâ<U+0080><U+0099> strengths and their daughtersâ<U+0080><U+0099> beauty and listened to their pipers, aso. Stannis learns through the books (which said e.g. Bryan Cogman too) and actually bends more (yes, yes, even the Iron Mannis does it, sometimes) and does more and more actively (by his own) to show how he deserves that people fight for him and his cause, that the North has still a king who cares, and that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the king who defends his realm and people. And his people skills are getting better, Imo. (or let's say his realisings / insights about how he has to act as king and what he has to do help him in his development, successes and behaviour with others).
Nevertheless I think when he was with the Mountain Clans he was still the guy, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s always, who expects people to do their duty and obey the law. And as vassal itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s your duty to serve your liege lord, or in this case saving your liege lordâ<U+0080><U+0099>s little daughter (which is the main argument for the Mountain Clans, and the argument, I think, he used to win them on his side).
Â 
Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> people skills are way, way smaller than Davos' (who has a great knowledge of human nature), but the fact that he raised Davos and recognize his worth, shows they are better than many often say, Imo is Stannis good in seeing other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worths (letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forget Imry Florent for a moment), which is an important ability as king and military commander. (Just the same as listening to others' advides, and benefit of Davos'/Mel's/Jon's suggestions)
Â 
That same with inspiring loyalty which Stannis does well; e.g. his half fleet burns, many of his soldiers are dying and everyone is afraid, but he â<U+0080><U+0093>now I mean on the show- crys â<U+0080><U+009C>Come with me and take this city!â<U+0080><U+009D>, jumps in the boat and everyone follows his king. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no rhetorical genius, but he shows determination, his great military talents, and he fights together with his soldiers (we saw him fighting with them at the front in â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwaterâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+0093>first at the beach, first up the ladder, aso - and we see him marching, starving, soon fighting with them in ADWD/TWOW).
With 17 years old, he hold SS with 500 men and okay, I wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t deny this catapult-story about the guys who wanted to surrender, but despite this, he managed to motive and command his peopleâ<U+0080>¦ and later in the whole story we see him with an army of Stromlords, Crownlords, some Reachlords, Northmen, Clansmen, Asha (and later some Ironborn more); he has worshippers of the Seven, Râ<U+0080><U+0099>hllor, the Old God, the Drowned God; they are conflicts, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re starving, their army is smaller than Rooseâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080><U+0093> but Stannis is super confident and certain of victory and fearless and seem to have everything under control, especially in the TWOW sample chapter (where heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in an excellent mood, for Stannis' standards even sorta happy).
And thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no Melisandre and no Davos, he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to rely on Melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s powers (but on his queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men), he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need rely on Davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> abilities (but on his Manderly-mission); when Stannis is in power and has men on this side, then we see the â<U+0080><U+009C>bestâ<U+0080><U+009D> Stannis.
Â 
Many people change for the worse when they get power, Stannis is one of the few who absolutely change for the better and shows he can handle power well; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the times when he has nothing where he needs Davos/Mel more and considers things and ways, which are morally bad (And one of his characteristics is definitely that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s good in making â<U+0080><U+0093>or forcing- himself to do things he actually despises or hates, but sees them as necessary, and does what he thinks he must do).
Â 
Â 
Okay, (man, sorry for the lost post, but I always wanted to say that all) so, the long and the short of it:
Â 
Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing wrong, Imo, with Davos speaking for Stannis, he does it in the books as well, okay at the mermanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s court is Stannis absent, but Davos has his trust and expectation that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll manage it, and he does; at the Iron Bank the situation for Stannis is more helpless, but nevertheless similar to the other situation for Davos, we just have ASOS(pre-battle)-Stannis at this moment who still has a lot to do and who still got a long way to go, a way which will show his abilities (and it only begins with his victory at the Battle of Castle Black), where he develops and gets more and more people who supporting him.
Â 
That happens in the North, before that he had few men and mainly the queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men (because of Melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080><U+009C>helpâ<U+0080><U+009D>) and on the show now a Iron Bank loan (because of Davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> help), so they might brought him men in the past, but it's Stannis who leads and commands them, and later Davos&Mel leave Stan / he leaves them and he gets the peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s supports with his own actions, with his recognizing that has to defend his realm, fight against its enemies, do his duties as king â<U+0080><U+0093> And THAT shows the show hopefully in the future!
Episode 9 is there an important step (especially if/when we see him fighting Blackwater-like again, which is very certain) and then, in season 5, thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s even more awesome stuff to doâ<U+0080>¦

People skills normally refers to the direct communication between people, not judgement of characters.
"the ability to communicate effectively with people in a friendly way, especially in business."
https://en.wikipedia...i/People_skills
Â 
Stannis has an A-level in appraising a man's worth, but not even a GCSE in communicating in a friendly way.

Ah, and thank you for the wikipedia-link =) I always wondered if it ("people skills") means the german word "Sozialkompetenz" or rather/also "Menschenkenntnis", but I've read it so often, so I used this word for both meanings, although you're right and it doesn't means the same.

4722	Tormund Giant*****	2014-05-20	In ep 7 Jon and Thorne had a confrontation about giants and sealing the passage under the wall. Does this perhaps hint that it may well be Thorne in the end that dies in the tunnel fighting the giants. Would be a pretty badass way out. Dont see him surviving the episode to be honest, one way or another.
4723	Arkash	2014-05-20	It's gonna be Grenn defending the tunnels against the giants. We've seen him do so in trailers.
Â 
Thorne will most likely be killed by Tormund in their fight we saw on one behind the scenes videos. Although I really hope he has enough time to tell Jon "The Wall is yours."
4724	~No One~	2014-05-20	^ Lots of spec up-thread on this. General opinion ( in case you don't want to read all 25 pages) is that Thorne & Grenn are goners.

4725	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-20	Just curious-I've seen that a lot of people support the idea of Thorne getting killed here and I'm still trying to figure out why?
Â 
Grenn I'm 100% on board with to replace the absent Donal Noye since it's highly unlikely we'll get a two minute scene with Jon and some random dude in Ep. 8 who happens to be Donal Noye, since he was important in Jon's development and can't really be introduced now. So having Grenn die in his place is o.k.-we know he just sits around and doesn't do much in Dance.
Â 
Is it just because the same rationale can be applied to Thorne that so many people think he dies? They're not going to kill Tormund for obvious reasons but just because we see those two fighting doesn't mean that one necessarily kills the other-someone could intervene, they could have Ser Alliser parry and run, exposing him as a coward (which would be a nice reversal and probably set up Dance stuff easier). I really do hope we get Thorne's line even if they kill him. In Dance we know he watches Slynt get executed and then goes beyond the wall with the rangers on Jon's orders, but I'd really like for zombie-Thorne to come back and fight Jon, true to his word. I'd like it better if they don't kill him here.

4726	Hour of the Wolf	2014-05-20	Ugh, this thread is so long. My favourite thing from the TBC was how the Viper reflected the sun into the Mountains eyes. Probably won't have that in the show.
I just wanted to reflect on my memory of this fight.
4727	Mel_Rose	2014-05-21	Just curious-I've seen that a lot of people support the idea of Thorne getting killed here and I'm still trying to figure out why?

Â 
Most of us who are sure of Thorne's demise on the show hold this opinion because, if Thorne survives, he will be voted Lord Commander. And why not? That's who I'd vote, if I was there. He is older, has been there for ages, has way more experience than Jon, is already acting LC etc. I don't see anyone voting for Jon instead of Throne when Jon's only been there for a little bit (compared to others who've been there decades) and has recently been accused of being a traitor.
Â 
It is the absence of all the possible leaders, that gives Jon the chance to become LC. Slynt is his only real opponent but still very new in NW.
Finally, Show!Thorne with Book!Thorne are different - Book!Thorne doesn't show any leadership skills or inclination.
4728	OnlyOne	2014-05-21	Of course its a joke.

Yes.

4730	Arkash	2014-05-21	On Thorne's death :
Â 
There is also the fact that we can glan from interviews than Jon and Thorne's relation somehow evolve somewhere. And it makes sense that it happens during the battle. Thorne has no choice but to trust Jon and says something meaningful to him. I think Thorne will know he might not survive the night. I really hope he's the one to tell Jon "The Wall is Yours" before dying.
4731	King Tommen	2014-05-21	There is also the possibility that even though Grenn is in the tunnels with other NW men for the initial Giant attack, that Thorne will eventually join them to be the one to sacrifice himself and take down the Giant. That way, he would truly take on the Donal Noye role and give Jon his blessing with his dying breath.
Â 
If he's fighting Tormund though (as we've seen), I'm not entirely sure how that ends without one of them dying. And I have a hard time believing Tormund is going down. I think if that were going to be the case, he'd be fighting Jon and he'd be the one to kill him (and that job seems to have been given to Styr). Thorne killing Tormund doesn't really track.
Â 
In any case, I think Thorne dying during the battle is the only thing that makes sense, especially given the fact that if he lives, there's no reason for him not to become the LC.
4732	Chebyshov	2014-05-22	There was footage of Thorne and Styr having an amazing fight...any chance the Magnar will be the one to finish him off?

Â 
I don't see Thorne giving Jon his 'blessing' if Slynt is around. Â I don't see him giving Jon any blessing even if Jon were the last man left alive at the Wall.

Which interviews are those?


Â 
http://www.worcester...ised/?ref=var_0
Owen hints that there will be a "development" in the pair's relationship in the show but could not reveal details of the plot in series four.
Â 

Â 
That's vague but "development" usually means "change" so there's that. Also, dramatically, it's makes too much sense not to have him finally acknowledge Jon as a leader if he's going to die in the battle. It's the fitting end of his arc.
4736	TheCaptainSargey	2014-05-23	I can see Throne dying and giving command of the Wall of Jon after watching him fight.
4737	Frey Pies	2014-05-23	I think Thorne dying will be the smartest move they can pull. He doesn't have that big of a role going forward (it could easily be given to someone else if necessary), and "The wall is yours, Jon Snow" will have a huge impact that way, as we'll see that Jon's leadership has even impressed people who antagonised him.
4738	~No One~	2014-05-23	There was footage of Thorne and Styr having an amazing fight...any chance the Magnar will be the one to finish him off?

Was there not a scene, maybe in the Weapons and Training video, of Thorne vs. Tormund, and Snow vs. Styr? I could be wrong, it's hard to remember all the details from all the promos....

Â 
yaaa more Tormund!! i loved his lines last season...especially when he was talking to Jon about the right way to fukÂ  
Â 
i rmr their interaction being hilarious in the books...he can be the new favorite after Vipers death...i've missed Varys this season and he's gone next and Bronn will probably decrease as well and with the Hound gone, someone has to provide some brevity!Â 
Â 
damn i just realized how many characters are gone after this season!Â 
Joeffry
Varys
Hound
Tywin
Oberyn
Ygritte
Thorne?Â 
Â 
with reduced Bran and Sansa scenes, makes alot of room for the Greyjoys and Martells...cant wait to see Crow's Eye!Â
4741	Eurymalys	2014-05-23	Assuming that we still get the throat-stabbing/spine-crushing scene between Mag and Noye('s replacement)--which I think we will, if only because the moment is just too sweet to miss--do you think they'll do it justice on both sides? Or will we just get some crazed, unthinking beast crushing a hero of the Night's Watch?
Â 
This is part of the reason I'd prefer to see Thorne getting crushed rather than Grenn (assuming Thorne does die in this battle). It'd give Thorne the badass death that would cause viewers to reevaluate him. And there'd be less of a risk of demonizing Mag than if it were our beloved Grenn being crushed.
Â 
I hope that we get to see the humanity of both crow and giant while they're in their death throes. Maybe get some "Last of the Giants" in the background. But I'm keeping my expectations low.
4742	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-23	any idea on the budget for this ep?Â this will probably be the biggest budget ep since Blackwater....
Â 
i found this about Blackwater -Â 
Â 
According to the Hollywood Reporter the total budget for Season One is estimated at $60 million.Â 
Â 
However the show was granted a 15% increase in order to properly stage the Battle of Blackwater.
Â 
Assuming each episode roughly costs $6 million and add the 15% of $9 million; then the Blackwater episode approx cost $15 million. (wow!)

yaaa more Tormund!! i loved his lines last season...especially when he was talking to Jon about the right way to fukÂ  
Â 
i rmr their interaction being hilarious in the books...he can be the new favorite after Vipers death...i've missed Varys this season and he's gone next and Bronn will probably decrease as well and with the Hound gone, someone has to provide some brevity!Â

4744	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-25	So how is Melisandre going to kill the bird? Will she flick her wrist and the bird will burn from within? Will she snap fire like Roy Mustang? In "Mockingbird" she was talking about a pinch of a potion that when thrown in a bonfire would send a flaming column to the sky, but I don't foresee that happening.

4746	Crow'sEye	2014-05-25	Varys? Umm....what? Surely that's a mistype.


He disappears for almost the entire next two books.
Will D&D keep him hanging around in disguise? Not sure that would be a good idea. Bit Benny Hill? Though there are ways they could do it with dramatic impetus.
4747	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-05-25	So, when will this air? The 8th of June right? As I'm Dutch with a temp. HBO subscription, I'm watching it a day later, so the 9th.. I'm leaving for vacation on either the 29th or the 30th.. So.. I'm going to miss two episodes.. This means.. I'm watching the Viper and The Mountain and The Watchers on the Wall BACK2BACK! 
Â 
I can't effing wait! 
Â 


Varys? Umm....what? Surely that's a mistype.


Â 
Varys is only in the 4 last pages of the epilogue of Dance.. Also, Kevan hasn't been seen the past two seasons.. Pretty much the same situation as the Catelyn/Lady Stoneheart deal if you'd ask me. It's a big if for Varys, though it seems kind of detrimental to not have these murders.
Â 
As for predictions for this episode, I hope Grenn lives.. I think I'm going to be a bit sad if he goes..
Â 
Mostly:
I'm hoping they'll show the back of the Wildling train as well, showing that there's pregnant women, crones, elderly men and plenty of children as well - just to give the battle that large sense of duality that it has in the books. The wildling assault from the south can be all grim, bloody, gory and filled with violence - as they've demonized the Thenn's already, but in the third season, we learned that there's more to this effort from Mance then just to sack the south. The viewers know this, but they need to be reminded that the wildlings are humans and they are afraid of what's coming.
Â 
If they don't show the wildlings that are unable to fight, the showviewers will only rally for Jon on the Wall.. Which will make Jon's decision to let them through eventually seem a bit weird.. If we see that there's genuinely a large part of the wildlings that can't fight at all and that only show their despair - then it is easier for showviewers to understand why Jon will let them through, they'll remember that the Others are coming and that the Wildlings are just as afraid for them as the Night's Watch is.

  You're definitely right! I'm already sad that they demonized the Thenns :-( Alys Karstark wouldn't marry a cannibal... Although she's probably going to be cutted anyway 
But it's really important to make their motives clear and that there's a far worse enemy, the "only one that matters" and that it's the wildlings' and non-wildlings' comman enemy.
They need to show that the wildlings are still human beings and Jon's decisions and moves in season 5 should be seen as logical by the audience.
Â 
Jon and his brothers & Stannis and his host defeat the wildlings in the books and then, just in the next chapter, Jon and Stannis already talk about forming an alliance and agree both they want to let the wildlings who bend the knee through the Wall. I hope it will be as understanding as it was in the books, even after their great victory against them in this episode; and the later relationship of the wildlings and the Night's Watch is so interesting and important / essential for Jon's arc; hopefully it will work to make the people cheer and celebrate for the NW, Jon, Stannis & Co. during/after the battle, but remind them then that there's still the threat of the White Walkers and they're coming for EVERYONE.

Â 
We have seen only one glimpse of Mance in the preview : him in a forest, with warriors around him. I wonder if this shot will appear in episode 8 but seems unlikely seems it's a daylight shot and we know the final battle north of the wall happens in the morning, but I hope Mance wont be shown only as a war leader and we'll see him talking to some pregnant women, older people and children.

Â 
That's vague but "development" usually means "change" so there's that. Also, dramatically, it's makes too much sense not to have him finally acknowledge Jon as a leader if he's going to die in the battle. It's the fitting end of his arc.

Thanks!

It looks like it's just as Stannis' men come riding, I wonder if Jon will be there, he speaks with Mace as the riders show up.
4754	Arkash	2014-05-26	^ We've seen Jon alone crossing the tunnels many time in previews. It can only makes sense if he's supposed to go and see Mance by his own before hell breaks loose on the north side of the Wall. Not 100% sure but I really feel we'll get, somehow, the Jon and Mance scene.

In the book Jon does that and Tormund takes him to Mace. I think it may stay the same in the show. I re-read the chapters yesterday and I think the timeline will more or less stay the same, with Ygritte dying a little later in the show to give it more impact. I don't think they'll keep the whole Horn thing, so I wonder what Mace will say to Jon.

Â 
Even without the horn you could keep it much the same and get the same point across. Mance tries to scare Jon into surrendering saying he could take the Wall in a variety of ways, and the only reason he doesn't is because his people have suffered enough. Jon asks whether Mance can get his people to accept Westeros' law and order, Mance refuses, OwlGuy spots a host of "iron men", screams suddenly, and then the attack begins.
Â 
Though it wouldn't take much to keep the horn in. They seem to be upping the magical elements this season.

The Thenn Warg, let's call him Varamyr, will be south of the Wall for the battle. I dont think he'll be the one to spot the cavalry charging at them except if, somehow, he finds his way on the other side of the Wall.

Many, many of you already said it in this thread before, that "The Last of the Giants" would be wonderful, I agree it'd make a great song for this episode (especially after I heard this version -> http://www.youtube.c...h?v=w4cqcinpbvw It's sung with a much higher voice than it would be, but absolutely beautiful).
I just don't know when they should/could play it... The music during the credits should be triumphantly, awesome music, fitting to "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!" and "The Last of the Giants" is so sad and melancholic (which definitely should not be the atmosphere at the episode's end!)... But the song would be cool, nevertheless.
Â 
(As I know them, we'll probably hear "The Rains of Castamere" even it wouldn't make any sense; but as Olenna said: "I do so hope they play 'The Rains of Castamere.' It's been an hour two episodes, I've forgotten how it goes" )
Â 


Yeah, I want Tormund to live...I think he's very important going forward.


Â 
I really cannot see Tormund dying, he HAS to live! I love the Jon/Tormund relationship, and Jon needs some wildling friends he can rely on at The Wall and especially IF they'd cut Val, he needs him even more.
Â 


In the book Jon does that and Tormund takes him to Mace. I think it may stay the same in the show.

I'm not sure about the horn, but I think and hope you're all right and that's the way it will happen, so much similar to the books as possible. I actually think the Jon/Mance scene will be barely different from the books (but maybe/probably(?) without Dalla and Val), their dialogue aso should work just the same on the show as in the books.

It seems to me that if they had wanted to keep the Horn plotline they'd have started it in season 2, or even as late as season 3 when Jon is with Mance, or Tormund, or Orell, or Ygritte. Any of those could have feasibly mentioned it.
I find both Horns so interesting, but it's probably one of the easier areas to condense the story. I'm also inclined to believe that Dalla and Val won't be in. I think they are replaceable in the TV plot with Tormund. Or Sigorn.
Tormund is safe for now, I think. He's integral to Jon's arc next season. 
Grenn, unfortunately, is probably toast. Giant toast. I just re-watched the weapons and training preview, and he's front-and-centre fighting a giant.
4761	boojam	2014-05-26	I flit back and forth between what I think is best and what isn't, but yeah, Blackwater was great. Its production values btw were one of the reasons that that was the case. They funneled a shit-ton of S2's funds towards it specifically. Now their budget has increased and they've spread the money throughout the season but there's still been a helluva lot put into this particular episode. I really doubt we'll get mammoths, but giants, the battles from the south and north combined to raise the stakes (which I think was a good choice because I like this Craster's Keep invented stuff quite a bit), Ygritte biting it, some awesome duels and the Mannis arrival... It'll take names. The Children will be the best episode of the season though.I posted this elsewhere but I guess everybody did not read it.CINEFEX , kind of a CGI-VFX journal more than a magazine, has a long article in the April issue about GOT VFX.
	Spoiler  I guess this is a show spoiler but one of the CGI supervisors spelled the beans. Yes there are both giants and mammoths.You can read about it here, but you will have to buy the zine, I bought my copy at Barnes and Nobel, I don't know if this one is on line yet, still have to buy it.http://www.cinefex.c...es/issue137.htm

	Spoiler I don't think there will be any sneak peeks at the Mammoths and Giants... we have seen one Giant already.I bet they all don't look alike. George , seems to me, implied in the book, there were 'some' giants and Mammoths but not a whole train load of them.By the by the info comes from Joe Bauer Visual Effects Supervisor HBO Game of Thrones ....but I am not sure he really wanted CineFex reporter Jody Duncan to mention it in her write up.O yes, something big about dragons, but that's not elaborated on.There you have it.

That would be awesome. So much of the bad-ass direwolf action has been cut from the show already (Grey Wind ripping arms off and fighting alongside Robb, all the Nymeria stuff, etc.), obviously for practical/budgetary reasons, but it'd be gratifying even to see a shot or two of Ghost during this ep.

This would be so nice but because of the last episode where Thorne tells jon to lock ghost up I got a feeling they might pull a ghost was locked up for the whole battle scenario
4768	Arkash	2014-05-28	^ I hope not ! D&D must be aware that the direwolves have been a letdown since season 1 (maybe the biggest letdown of the show, imo) and they must know they have the perfect opportunity to fix that during the battle. If Ghost ends up locked the whole battle, there will be some outrage ! ... Well, I've never been a hardcore purist, but that... not seing Ghost for the battle... that I really do not want !Â 
Â 
About "The Wall is Yours", most people speculate that Thorne will say it to Jon before dying, after witnessing Jon's skills at leading the defense, and it would be the best move the show could do to have that very iconic and powerful line !Â 
Â 
I hope we also get "The Wall is Yours" of Jon to Grenn and Pyp's reaction to that !

4772	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-28	i like the idea of thorne getting cut down, then he sees jon being a badass, killing wildlings and rallying men around him. then jon could beat back some attack, go to thorne and thorne giving him the wall. i would like that moment with some cool music and very dramatic. jon needs to be show leading men around him though.

Yep, since the recap showed Mole's Town and the Wildlings as last scenes, it's confirmed(?) this episode will begin with the NW/Wildlings storyline. And this episode is full with stuff (and only 53 min long) so I don't think we'll have a second scene at the Wall. And I'm 100% sure it will end with Oberyn's dramatic, shocking death (and Tyrion vomitting?). This moment is too good to be a penultimate scene and the perfect shocker and cliffhanger...
Although I'm wondering if this cliffhanger will effect Unsullied-fan-rage, when they'll see Oberyn dying and then all "WHAAAA! Tyrion will DIIIIE! NOOO!"... and then they watch the trailer for 4x09 and it's "Lol, sorry guys! No Tyrion, you have to wait till episode 10 to see his fate :-P"
					
					
							Edited by The Onion Sleight, 28 May 2014 - 04:29 PM.
4776	King Tommen	2014-05-28	Like Blackwater, I imagine E9 will spend a healthy amount of time depicting the preparation for the imminent attack with various scenes between both NW character and Wildlings on both sides. Then you'll have the initial blow struck at maybe the 20 minute mark (the WIldling charge from the South I bet) and it will be all out action right until the end with Stannis' arrival being the climax of the episode.
4777	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-28	^ Sounds good, how exactly do you think will the episode begin?
4778	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-28	(Sorry, double post)
					
					
							Edited by The Onion Sleight, 28 May 2014 - 05:01 PM.
4779	King Tommen	2014-05-28	I actually think E9 has the potential to top Blackwater only because the battle is more eventful and the audience knows more of the characters involved.
Â 
I've always maintained that Blackwater suffers from the "Helm's Deep" issue in that it's a huge setpiece 'event' battle where one army is basically faceless (Stannis and a bunch of chumps) and it's a siege that doesn't end up succeeding. And no one of consequence dies. The status quo is more or less maintained at the end of everything.
Â 
While there is nothing that will match the sheer spectacle of the Wildfire explosion (although perhaps the Mammoths, Giants and the collapse of the Thenn-filled Wall elevator could give it a run), there is just simply more action taking place on more fronts with more varied characters.
Â 
In Blackwater, there are no one-on-one face-offs in the battlefield. It's essentially the Hound, occasionally Bronn, sometimes Stannis and right at the end Tyrion cutting down random faceless opponents. We know they're in no danger because they aren't facing off against anyone important on the other side. Aside from that, the only cutting away we have is to the "women in hiding" and while those scenes are interesting because of drunk Cersei, they don't accomplish a ton plot-wise.
Â 
In this battle not only will you have Jon and Sam as the heroes on one side, you've got their friends the little boy Olly, Grenn, Pyp, Edd (and Ghost) fighting alongside them who the audience also cares about. Then you have their leader Thorne who on top of leading the defense, will probably also have his whole relationship with Jon dealt with during the battle in which he most likely ends up dying and finally acknowledging Jon as a leader. And if you need to cut away to some potential "characters in peril" you've got Gilly and Aemon.
Â 
On the other side instead of just Stannis (and an immediately sidelined Davos) in Blackwater, you have Mance, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr who will all take part in the battle. The audience would especially have feelings about Ygritte and Tormund based on the way they've been portrayed. And they'd definitely want to see Styr die based on the way he's been portrayed. The Wildling army itself is differentiated with the Thenns being the "eviil and dangerous" ones that will function as the dangerous infantry. Then you've got the weapons of mass destruction in the Wargs, Giants and Mammoths who will need to be dealt with in their own specialized manner in order to be defeated.
Â 
You've got multiple dramatic beats that will take place during the battle with isolated confrontations. Jon vs Styr, Tormund vs Thorne, Grenn and co. vs the Giant under the gates, Olly vs Ygritte and Sam most likely doing something heroic to save or protect Gilly. Almost all of these confrontations will result in a death on one side at least.
Â 
The battle will also have multiple settings as opposed to the Blackwater battle that takes place almost exclusively outside of the Mud Gate. Â You've got the Southern attack infiltrating Castle Black completely, the Wildlings and Giants trying to breach the gates in the tunnels as well as whatever the NW are going to do in their defense at the top of the Wall. And then, when Stannis, Mel and Davos arrive, it's going to be a huge cavalry attack in the woods North of the Wall. Â And then you'll get a whole new sequence of action with a new set of characters the audience is very familiar with.
Â 
I know the focus this season is on all the cool things that will happen in the finale but this episode I think will really sneak up on people to be one of the best of the series.
4780	King Tommen	2014-05-28	^ Sounds good, how exactly do you think will the episode begin?


Â 
That's hard to say. After I see how the Wildling/NW stuff in E8 finishes up, I'll probably have a better guess.
4781	Hath4	2014-05-28	I agree, this episode as been really been overlooked by the fans. 8 and 10 are getting all the buzz and rightly so, but this will still be epic.
4782	Lord Carson	2014-05-28	^ Sounds good, how exactly do you think will the episode begin?


If I had it my way, I'd try to introduce Jon's warging here. Jon has a dream in which Ghost sees the raiders approaching from the south and Jon wakes up and warns everyone to get ready. Or if Gilly doesn't show up back at Castle Black in episode 8 (I think she probably will), have her return start off this one.
4783	ToTheWolves	2014-05-28	I actually think E9 has the potential to top Blackwater only because the battle is more eventful and the audience knows more of the characters involved.
Â 
I've always maintained that Blackwater suffers from the "Helm's Deep" issue in that it's a huge setpiece 'event' battle where one army is basically faceless (Stannis and a bunch of chumps) and it's a siege that doesn't end up succeeding. And no one of consequence dies. The status quo is more or less maintained at the end of everything.
Â 
While there is nothing that will match the sheer spectacle of the Wildfire explosion (although perhaps the Mammoths, Giants and the collapse of the Thenn-filled Wall elevator could give it a run), there is just simply more action taking place on more fronts with more varied characters.
Â 
In Blackwater, there are no one-on-one face-offs in the battlefield. It's essentially the Hound, occasionally Bronn, sometimes Stannis and right at the end Tyrion cutting down random faceless opponents. We know they're in no danger because they aren't facing off against anyone important on the other side. Aside from that, the only cutting away we have is to the "women in hiding" and while those scenes are interesting because of drunk Cersei, they don't accomplish a ton plot-wise.
Â 
In this battle not only will you have Jon and Sam as the heroes on one side, you've got their friends the little boy Olly, Grenn, Pyp, Edd (and Ghost) fighting alongside them who the audience also cares about. Then you have their leader Thorne who on top of leading the defense, will probably also have his whole relationship with Jon dealt with during the battle in which he most likely ends up dying and finally acknowledging Jon as a leader. And if you need to cut away to some potential "characters in peril" you've got Gilly and Aemon.
Â 
On the other side instead of just Stannis (and an immediately sidelined Davos) in Blackwater, you have Mance, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr who will all take part in the battle. The audience would especially have feelings about Ygritte and Tormund based on the way they've been portrayed. And they'd definitely want to see Styr die based on the way he's been portrayed. The Wildling army itself is differentiated with the Thenns being the "eviil and dangerous" ones that will function as the dangerous infantry. Then you've got the weapons of mass destruction in the Wargs, Giants and Mammoths who will need to be dealt with in their own specialized manner in order to be defeated.
Â 
You've got multiple dramatic beats that will take place during the battle with isolated confrontations. Jon vs Styr, Tormund vs Thorne, Grenn and co. vs the Giant under the gates, Olly vs Ygritte and Sam most likely doing something heroic to save or protect Gilly. Almost all of these confrontations will result in a death on one side at least.
Â 
The battle will also have multiple settings as opposed to the Blackwater battle that takes place almost exclusively outside of the Mud Gate. Â You've got the Southern attack infiltrating Castle Black completely, the Wildlings and Giants trying to breach the gates in the tunnels as well as whatever the NW are going to do in their defense at the top of the Wall. And then, when Stannis, Mel and Davos arrive, it's going to be a huge cavalry attack in the woods North of the Wall. Â And then you'll get a whole new sequence of action with a new set of characters the audience is very familiar with.
Â 
I know the focus this season is on all the cool things that will happen in the finale but this episode I think will really sneak up on people to be one of the best of the series.

Oh man! I hope this episode is as epic as you just made it sound.

Â 
This was an excellent breakdown and perfectly explains why I'm more excited for the Battle of the Wall than I was the Blackwater episode (which was an incredible spectacle and feat for TV).
4786	Rashtibram	2014-05-29	I don't know about anyone else, but I'd open the episode with the Wildlings and Mance lighting the "biggest fire the north has ever seen" accompanied by the Wildling soundtrack. Then cut to the NW making battle preparations.
Â 
King Tommen's post made me really insanely excited for this episode. 'Blackwater' is still my favorite so far (the only episode to have a earned a '9' from me on the voting polls) and this one really looks set to top it.
4787	Arkash	2014-05-29	I think the episode needs to open on a strong visual and the army of wildlings north of the Wall and "biggest fire the North has ever seen" are indeed the best way to start it all. But they could also decide to start with Jon and Sam watching the wildling host advance from top of the Wall.
4788	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-29	I kinda hope Stannis's arrival is kinda like the reveal that Dany has conquered Meereen: a glance into the sky to reveal that Orell's eagle is aflame, followed by the arrival of cavalry shouting "STANNIS!" with Stannis leading his troops, followed by Davos and Melisandre.
4789	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-29	I think they are going to set the battle before trial by combat. I'm 100% sure the ending ofÂ  ep.8 is the end of the trial


Â 
agreed! we've seen sam crying and all that...im hoping that just at the end of that scene at the wall, 2 horn blasts and someone screams "WILDLINGS!!!!!"Â  Â  
or jon standing on top of the wall and looks north and sees "the greatest fire the north has ever seen"Â  Â  
Â 
right then we cut to KL and start of the trial/combatÂ 
Â 
too high expectations?Â

I think the fire thing will be in ep.9, but hopefully they will set up the battle episode nicely, I'm not sure Unsullied care as much as they did about Blackwater when their beloved Tyrion was in danger.
4791	Arkash	2014-05-29	Imo, the Wall storyline for episode 8 will end with Jon saying something like : "They are here, time to fight", or something like that. The two blasts will be in 9, around the 15 minutes mark, I'd guess, after some setting up in the three camps (NW, Tormund and crew, Mance).
4792	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-29	I think the fire thing will be in ep.9, but hopefully they will set up the battle episode nicely, I'm not sure Unsullied care as much as they did about Blackwater when their beloved Tyrion was in danger.


Â 
i rmr my unsullied friends being super excited when Mance actually said "greatest fire the north has ever seen"...that was about 10eps ago now right? or was is in S2? im hoping for a good build up in 8th ep...they need to get the crowd up and ready and excited about 9th ep...they need highest ratings for this ep afterall
4793	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-29	Imo, the Wall storyline for episode 8 will end with Jon saying something like : "They are here, time to fight", or something like that. The two blasts will be in 9, around the 15 minutes mark, I'd guess, after some setting up in the three camps (NW, Tormund and crew, Mance).


Â 
i hope not...i cant rmr exactly how it was in the books, but i feel like the attack started within a few hours of the two blasts...so i'm hoping its in ep 8, so 9 just starts off with NW final prep and boom, action starts in the first 10mins and goes through out...
4794	salvatoredamon90	2014-05-29	I think the fire thing will be in ep.9, but hopefully they will set up the battle episode nicely, I'm not sure Unsullied care as much as they did about Blackwater when their beloved Tyrion was in danger.


Jon Snow is in the episode, he has his share of fans . And not to mention that the Blackwater battle was between two evil sides(well Stannis wasn't exactly evil but killing Renly by such manner sure didn't help him in the eyes of the non book readers) so this time they actually have someone to root for .

Tyrion is a vast fan favorite and I'm pretty sure Unsullied cared if he survived, the rest of Lannisters surviving would just be a price to pay for Tyrion winning the battle. As great as Snow is this season I keep reading how bored people are with the Wall (which is strange, it's actually one of my fav storylines this season).
Â 
Not to mention they hyped wildfire all season long. I don't think they established the wildling threat to the realm well enough this season. Hopefully they'll do that next ep

Â 
I don't think they hyped wildfire that much. The plan itself was a huge secret that was only revealed when it was lit up during the episode. It was much more telegraphed in the books than it was on the show.
Â 
I think Mance's army marching on the Wall has been a constant threat since last season and Jon's urging of his fellow cohorts to understand the scope of this threat mirrors almost exactly what Tyrion was trying to do in KL.
Â 
While the audience certainly likes Tyrion, it's not like they dislike Jon either.
Â 
There's been a lot of revisionist history with Blackwater. People remember the episode because of the spectacle and action (as well as being the first time the show devoted an entire episode to one locale). But the buildup in previous episodes wasn't much more than Tyrion telling some people that Stannis was going to show up eventually which was met with general indifferent shrugs. Once we actually got to the episode and the audience saw that this was going to be a big deal, then that's when the excitement started. Â The same will happen here. Â No one really gives a shit until the threat has arrived and the action starts. You can only talk about it happening down the road so much.

Â 


Â 
i agree with that...its not just us knowing that the battles coming, everyone is expecting it similar to blackwater...it is very similar to tyrion in S2...only difference is that Tyrion being the Hand, you could see him taking some action, reading, planning, meeting the pyromancers etc...jon being just a steward is not being able to do anything

No offense but i just don't enjoy reading that forum in particular, in seems it's just full of grumpy people upset that the story is not going into the direction that they want and just continue watching and whining at almost everything, i just don't even bother reading it anymore tbh.but whatever floats your boat .

4799	Mos	2014-05-29	I don't know if its been discussed, but there kinda needs to be a Bowen Marsh character next season. If they don't introduce Bowen next season, I think the role will be given to either Thorne or Grenn. Thorne seems like to obvious choice, but I'm leaning more towards Grenn now. He's getting a little more material this season, which I think will either lead to his death or to a bigger role next season.Â 
Â 
I used to think that both Thorne and Grenn would die in the battle, but now I'm leaning more towards just one of them.Â
4800	Konradsmith	2014-05-30	^They could always cast a new Bowen.
4801	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-30	He disappears for almost the entire next two books.
Will D&D keep him hanging around in disguise? Not sure that would be a good idea. Bit Benny Hill? Though there are ways they could do it with dramatic impetus.


Â 
Â 


So, when will this air? The 8th of June right? As I'm Dutch with a temp. HBO subscription, I'm watching it a day later, so the 9th.. I'm leaving for vacation on either the 29th or the 30th.. So.. I'm going to miss two episodes.. This means.. I'm watching the Viper and The Mountain and The Watchers on the Wall BACK2BACK! 
Â 
I can't effing wait! 
Â 
Â 
Varys is only in the 4 last pages of the epilogue of Dance.. Also, Kevan hasn't been seen the past two seasons.. Pretty much the same situation as the Catelyn/Lady Stoneheart deal if you'd ask me. It's a big if for Varys, though it seems kind of detrimental to not have these murders.
Â 
Â 


Yeah, but that list, with the exception of Thorne, was for characters who were dead. Varys still has an important role to play. Also, for the show's purposes I wouldn't be surprised at all if we get Varys subplot stuff or at least random characters saying stuff like, "Gee, we haven't seen the Spider in a while" while we're being introduced to Aegon and keeping tabs on that situation. It's not like he's going to be entirely gone.
Â 
Also, the rate at which the material is going to be adapted for the next two seasons will be much faster. Season 5 will include material from both and 6 will include TWoW as well. As interesting as the political intrigue is, the lack of action in the earlier stages will force them to move stuff along quickly. We've already seen this happen this season as well with the accelerated plotlines.Â 
Â 
So I'd be very surprised if Varys was left out going forward. Non-POV chars haven't had an issue getting plenty of screen time in the past on show in order to drive the plot. Expect it to happen again.
4802	Crow'sEye	2014-05-30	They can just stick to the story. From what I recall Cersei knows or is at least 95% sure that Varys is responsible for Tyrion's escape and was also the gaoler.
I can envisage scenes with a person who could be Varys from certain angles but we cannot be sure. No dialogue, he is watching proceedings. Or maybe that would be a bit hokey.
4803	King Tommen	2014-05-30	I don't know if its been discussed, but there kinda needs to be a Bowen Marsh character next season. If they don't introduce Bowen next season, I think the role will be given to either Thorne or Grenn. Thorne seems like to obvious choice, but I'm leaning more towards Grenn now.

Â 
I used to think that both Thorne and Grenn would die in the battle, but now I'm leaning more towards just one of them.Â 


Â 
One possibility that has been floated is that the Bowen Marsh role could go to Pyp next season. He's an actual Steward like Marsh was and Jon could choose to promote him up as one of his first acts as LC. This way, it's certainly a character that the audience knows and it's been established that they're friends. They could have Pyp first gently disagree with some of the things Jon is doing with the Wildlings and have his disillusionment grow stronger throughout the season. That would make his eventual reluctant betrayal that much more powerful.
Â 
They certainly could just bring in a Bowen Marsh next season as if he's been there all along and we've never seen him but I do find that strange that they've gone out of their way not to cast him at this point. Â In the books both Grenn and Pyp are just kind of sidelined out of the story which isn't a great way to deal with them on the show. Having Grenn die in the battle and Pyp take on a more important role in the following season would make better uses of them IMO.
4804	sati	2014-05-30	But the thing is, you take the opinion of the people from the previously forums as being the universal opinion of the Wall storyline, which i know for sure it's not true, i watch non book readers youtube videos as well as other forums besides that one and they actually care about other storylines besides KL .

Â 
Um, what? I visit a lot of forums, I have my own website, I do talk with a lot of fans of the show. Everyone gets to have their own opinionÂ  Sure people care, my comment wasn't about that it was a comparison of hype for this and Blackwater.
Â 
Then don't read it.

4805	Frey Pies	2014-05-30	I think this episode will go down as one of the all time best of TV in general if done right. From what we know so far, the scale of the battle will be unprecedented for TV. The greatest fire the north has ever seen, I'm hoping, will be able to rival the wildfire in terms of the awe it induces. Plus, attack from all sides and the fact that it is happening at the majestic Wall will just add to the spectacle. Unlike Blackwater, I'm assuming it will have quite a few emotional moments too, like Ygritte's death, "The wall is yours, Jon Snow", Jon riding out to concede to Mance, as well as having a more fist-pumping moment than anything in Blackwater in terms of "Stannis, STANNIS".
Â 
I know I'll enjoy it- D&D have said that it trumps Blackwater, and I have no reason to doubt them. I feel that, during its initial airing, it might not receive the immense public's approval that it will deserve due to people being annoyed over no follow-up on Tyrion.Â

Can't wait for that ep. I'm excited for ep.8 but that's mostly about the trial, battle ep and the finale are going to be so monumental.
4809	King Tommen	2014-05-30	If nothing else, the budget for this episode is bigger than the one for Blackwater. Additionally, this time Marshall is not being airlifted in weeks before the episode is shot. He has had the proper time to plan and map out all the sequences.
Â 
Really, outside of the fact that it's focused on Jon instead of Tyrion, there's really no reason that anyone shouldn't expect this episode to be better and more well-received than Blackwater was. Â We aren't going to get the same amount of hype beforehand but that's not really going to be an issue once the episode airs.

I think the episode is going to be great and I'll be very impressed if I find it better and more rewatchable than Blackwater.
4811	Arkash	2014-05-30	There is still something that bothers me (and it did bother me in the books) : how the hell can the wildling archers kill Watchmen that are top of the Wall ? There is no way an arrow can fly that high and stay fatal to the one receiving it. I really wonder how this will be handled by the show.

I thought Jon Snow was concerned by the 'lucky errant' arrow causing any sort of injury? Which in the situation, was a possible threat.

4816	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-30	Tyrion wasÂ impressive during Blackwater but I think Jon will top him.
Â 
Tyrion did deliver an inspirational speech but in terms of fighting he didn't get much done (understandable) but Jon will be kicking numerous Wildling ass and getting blood on Longclaw. HeÂ also getsÂ a position of power (the Wall is yours) providing a fist pump moment while Tyrion was expected to have authority as Hand (not out of the blue like Jon).Â Then addÂ the emotional, "should have stayed in the cave" scene to make us sympathise with him and heÂ becomes a favourite.
Â 
Jon being a mainÂ (Stark!!) character in the episode 9 slot will provideÂ lots of worry! Â No Stark bodes well in that slot!

4827	Rashtibram	2014-05-31	I am wondering how they would pull off the 'Stannis!' chant. Having the soldiers yell a name over and over works when it's three times, and read on paper, but "STANNIS!

Â 
I actually think it's one of the things that would adapt well. I mean, they weren't chanting all throughout the battle, it was when Stannis' honour guard (I guess that's the term for it) rode through the camp with their gigantic banners that the chant began, and the wildlings were essentially already in full retreat by then.

4845	AdmiraloftheDothrakiSea	2014-06-01	Glad that none of the Unsullied are getting many hints that Stannis will come and save the day. IIRC the only hint was like a two second shot in one of the trailers of a bunch of knights riding really fast

Â 
Agreed. They'll be like: "What the effs is he doing at the Wall? Never mind, he's with Jon. Go get them!"
Â 
Â 
I have to admit though that this is the episode I'm looking forward to the least, because IMO this is only where the good stuff at the Wall begins. I never cared much for Jon or Stannis before they met. (Yes, I know, "blasphemy! Heresy! Burn the witch!")
Â 
Still looking forward to mammoths and general fight scene awesomeness.
4851	JonDunn	2014-06-02	I think there are a lot of people who really only started caring about Stannis once he saved the day at the wall.
Â 
For the longest time I was like - why the hell is he still alive?
4852	Fjordgazer	2014-06-02	When the season kicked off, i didn't think they would have both the attack from the south and the north in the same episode, but now it's an inevitability. Ygritte's death will probably become the midpoint transition. Or... might they happen simultaneously!?
Â 
Anyway, there are 3 arcs in this, from what i remember in my only read of ASOS: attack from the South, attack from the North, and Jon's attempt at truce with Mance. If we have Stannis showing up, all 3 arcs should happen next Sunday. Can it be done?

Yes, for sure. I finally got to watch an HD version of the promo and it's pretty clear there. The SD version was cloudier.
4855	NightStark	2014-06-02	In the trailer at about 0.06 it looks like the forest is on fire as Jon looks out on it..that must be Mance's signal.
Â 
That poster that was on the forum here a while ago with the forest on fire as the Wildlings approach the Wall must have been real. This is it; http://37.media.tumb...lgwpo1_1280.jpg
Â 
Actually doesn't look like the scene from the trailer, might have just been a good guess on the part of whoever made it.

4856	clawson24	2014-06-02	Went from being somewhat ambivalent about Stannis in the books to having his arrival at the Wall be my 2nd most anticipated moment of the entire season. Really hoping for a heroic/triumphant arrival with the STANNIS chant in full effect.
Â 
Also, I think I'm going to like Thorne a lot in this episode. His pre-battle speech seems bad-freakin'-ass based on the preview, and as a lot of people have suggested, I wouldn't be surprised if he acknowledges Jon's virtues and leadership by the end of the battle.
Â

+1 I just finished watching the trailer for my post above yours and I thought his speech was very inspirational.

Apparently some interview Owen Teale(Thorne) did states that there is some sort of development in their relationship during the battle.

I think the Dragon budget went to the Direwolves this season. They seem to play a bigger role this season then having dragons fly around on screen. Though, Mammoths would be cool to see.
Â 
I think we got a little foreshadowing in 404 with the boy saying he was the best shot in his village. I would say its safe to say, he'll be the source of the Ygritte's "scene".
Â 
As for Throne, I would say he is safe. Jon still needs someone at the wall within the brotherhood to cause some problems


Â 
I doubt the direwolves have as big of a budget as dragons. Hoping for some mammoths.
Â 
I think Thorne will be saved to become the face of Jon's opposition in the Night's Watch, which is better (and would've been better in the books too imo) than having a random barely shown character like Othell Yarwick or Bowen Marsh start a coup against Jon.

Attack from the south will begin. battle ensues, Jon kills Thenn, Ygritte will die from that young boys arrow. Jon heartbreak. the NW wins. Tormund escapes (? maybe). jon has conversation with sam/aemon and confrontation with slynt.thorne. Jon takes command on top the wall against the raiders from the north. Giant's against the gate, i wonder who will defeat it...maybe Pyp or Grenn? Jon is sent to treat with mance, perhaps with Tormund as a prisoner of good faith. dalla and val (if they are included) and horn of joramun. Stannis saves the day.
Â 
Roughly how i think it'll go
Â 
I think Alliser will live and replace bowen marsh. Because slynt needs to die next season. we need 'edd fetch me a block'. We need that line.

Why on earth would they do that? He's not dead in the books yet, and given how well Owen Teale and Kit Harington interact on screen, the producers aren't going to pass on the opportunity to show the characters with the roles reversed.
4865	Mos	2014-06-02	I still have a feeling Thorne is going to bite it. He's acting commander and will lead the attack; how is Jon going to get in charge and show off his leader skills, that eventually makes him elected lord commander, with Thorne still in charge?
Â 
Jon would somehow take the reins and lead the crows during the battle and do something heroic to show what he's made of, otherwise it wouldn't really make sense for the others to elect him Lord Commander over Thorne.
Â 
Styr still needs to do something big for him to be remembered, and killing Thorne could be just that.Â 
Â 
And speaking of the Bowen Marsh role, I think they could either just introduce him in season 5, or give his storyline to Grenn. Having Grenn lead the coup against Jon would be so much harder to swallow than if Thorne did it.
4866	Caesar Augustus	2014-06-02	Will Stannis' attack be in this episode or the finale?
Â 
If I remember correct Stannis arrived in the morning while Jon was in the Wildling camp as Mance was preparing for a second assault? So would that mean he would arrive in the finale?
Â 
Anyone have any ideas?
4867	The Drunkard	2014-06-02	It'll be this episode.
4868	igrewupinKL	2014-06-02	Im hoping Stannis does it.


hmm im not sure how that would work, timing wise
Â 
No Grenn is a cool character  i see him going out doing something heroic not something against jon
If Thorne dies, all the better for it, he plays his character well but he is kind've annoying. They may just introduce Bowen marsh in season 5 i guess.Â 
People rally with Jon because he is a natural leader, he had the craster adventure and was successful in that. there are other things he has done this season to gain favour with the NW men. I'm guessing during the battle he will show real leadership...maybe after the attack from the south, alliser and men will chase after the remaining wildlings and jon will take command of the wall.Â

4869	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-02	I can't wait for this episode. They haven't hyped it up enough on the show. We haven't even seen Mance this season.
4870	Red Tiger	2014-06-02	Why on earth would they do that? He's not dead in the books yet, and given how well Owen Teale and Kit Harington interact on screen, the producers aren't going to pass on the opportunity to show the characters with the roles reversed.


Cause they made him even more unlikable than in the books, plus it's not like he's a big fan favourite in either medium and he is not important to the plot.
4871	King Tommen	2014-06-02	Like Blackwater, I suspect the first 15 minutes or so are devoted to the "calm before the storm" of both sides. It would be exceedingly difficult to have an hour of straight action taking place, that's way too much. They'll need to introduce the battle strategy of both groups and have individual scenes between key characters to set the stakes and pay off things that will happen during the battle. I don't imagine the initial Wildling attack (along with the massive fire from Mance we see in the promo) takes place until almost a third of the way into the episode and then we'll have non-stop action through to the end with Stannis.
4872	Frey Pies	2014-06-02	I agree. The Tormund and Thorne speeches, the Night's Watchmen being worried about the upcoming battle- I think that all will be shown before the fire is lit.
4873	Carl Rhaego	2014-06-02	OMG, are those mammoth legs in the trailer? I thought it was a giant at first but the way the foot bends backwards looks like an animal.

4877	Daemon I Blackfyre	2014-06-02	I think Ed Tollet, Grenn or Pyp should watch their backs on this one.
They did not introduce Donal Noye, but I think they'll want to kill someone off anyway.
4878	Bridgeburners	2014-06-02	When the season kicked off, i didn't think they would have both the attack from the south and the north in the same episode, but now it's an inevitability. Ygritte's death will probably become the midpoint transition. Or... might they happen simultaneously!?

Remember, in Blackwater they completely eliminated the initial advance into the gate where the chain was raised, as well as the fights on the decks of the ships-on-fire that form a bridge from the shore. It's a show, they have far less time and have to take liberties to fill the time properly, so they're going to make cuts. I wouldn't be surprised if the attacks from the south and the north happen at the same time.
Â 
I guess there will be no Donal Noye, since he wasn't introduced yet. If I were to guess, the guy who fights the breaching giant in the tunnel will be that builder guy (whose name escapes me) back in episode 7, who said "no" when Alliser Thorne asked him if he wants to block the tunnel with ice. He clearly felt nervous there, not knowing what to do, and I'll bet he'll feel really bad about his decision and feel like he's obligated to sacrifice his life to keep the tunnel from being breached, since it was ultimately his decision not to block it. Thing is, he still has two arms, so he'll never come close to the bravery of Donal Noye. Still, I like the way they set him up.
4879	ViennaGirl	2014-06-02	Maybe Thorne will be the hero in the tunnel, without Donall Noye? I can't see Thorne living and Jon being elected LC. It doesn't make sense, unless Thorne somehow is a coward in the battle, which I can't picture. It's too bad - I loved Noye...

4888	Targaryen loyalist	2014-06-02	I still have a feeling Thorne is going to bite it. He's acting commander and will lead the attack; how is Jon going to get in charge and show off his leader skills, that eventually makes him elected lord commander, with Thorne still in charge?
Â 
Jon would somehow take the reins and lead the crows during the battle and do something heroic to show what he's made of, otherwise it wouldn't really make sense for the others to elect him Lord Commander over Thorne.
Â 
Styr still needs to do something big for him to be remembered, and killing Thorne could be just that.Â 
Â 
And speaking of the Bowen Marsh role, I think they could either just introduce him in season 5, or give his storyline to Grenn. Having Grenn lead the coup against Jon would be so much harder to swallow than if Thorne did it.


Â 
They can either have Thorne injured (so not dead but out of combat) or have him chicken... I think that the fact that he marches north after Jon election is important so he can't die.
4889	Igziabeher	2014-06-02	I hope we get Melisandre torching one of the wildling warg's eagle out of the sky.  That will immediately become my favorite moment in the series.
4890	Mordos_Kull	2014-06-02	I personally would love to see Salladhor Saan in the battle, and a few of his fellow pirates.
4891	ChillinLikeSerIlyn	2014-06-02	I hope we get Melisandre torching one of the wildling warg's eagle out of the sky. That will immediately become my favorite moment in the series.


Â 
I have a feeling that one Thenn warg's owl will be going out in a "blaze" of glory.
4892	Samwell TarIy	2014-06-02	Â 
I hope so 
Â 
By the way, I can't believe that your name was actually available! Seems like someone would have used it up a long time ago by now.Â 


Replaced the L with a capital I xD

Could you link the French promo please!
4896	HairGrowsBack	2014-06-02	Sorry it's not online yet, butÂ if you want the details 
	Spoiler PypÂ gets an arrow in the neck.

Â

Where did you see it?


On OCS City, the channel broadcasting the show in France.

What else, what else?
4898	Seneti	2014-06-02	In the trailer at about 0.06 it looks like the forest is on fire as Jon looks out on it..that must be Mance's signal.
Â 
That poster that was on the forum here a while ago with the forest on fire as the Wildlings approach the Wall must have been real. This is it; http://37.media.tumb...lgwpo1_1280.jpg
Â 
Actually doesn't look like the scene from the trailer, might have just been a good guess on the part of whoever made it.


Â 
Wow, that's a nice poster. And I agree: that's definitely Mance lighting the biggest fire the north has ever scene in the promo.
4899	HairGrowsBack	2014-06-02	^It went very fast, 
	Spoiler the mammoth, giants and the Pyp
 thing are all I remember.
I'll try and catch it when they show it again, and I'll check their website.
4900	Rikard Stark	2014-06-02	Pyp dies and ser Allister thorn dies at the hands of Tormund
4901	Arkash	2014-06-02	I wonder how Mance's gonna light the fire ! It should take time, especially for wet wood like that !
Â 
And glad Joseph Gatt have lines ! He'll most probably warg his owl, spot the fire and announce that it is time.
4902	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-02	Grenn has been growing on me this season. They better not kill him!
4903	Arkash	2014-06-02	I wonder how Mance's gonna light the fire ! It should take time, especially for wet wood like that !

I think there are a lot of people who really only started caring about Stannis once he saved the day at the wall.
Â 
For the longest time I was like - why the hell is he still alive?


Yeah, I was always kind of a tentative stannis supporter until the wall. i kind of just thought "well, I guess he's the rightful heir, so I guess I'll root for him". But after the wall, i started to become a real fan
also, I really don't want to root for thorne, but he seems awesome
4905	Shy	2014-06-02	Alliser Thorne has to live, otherwise all the screen time with Jon and the beef built up between them has been wasted if Jon never gets the chance to rub it in his face.
4906	Fjordgazer	2014-06-02	I personally would love to see Salladhor Saan in the battle, and a few of his fellow pirates.


Â 
Since we've had some screen time with Salla, i think the show might use him as a viewpoint to feature Eastwatch-by-the-sea. I mean, until he betrays Davos. Although this betrayal might as well be changed from the book, it wouldn't surprise me too much.

4907	Kikiadiamond	2014-06-02	Alliser Thorne has to live, otherwise all the screen time with Jon and the beef built up between them has been wasted if Jon never gets the chance to rub it in his face.

It may be the typical Thorne is fighting-he's injured- he's about to get killed- Jon comes out of nowhere- saves his life in a killer fight against a scary wilding- drags Thorne to safety- etc.
4908	Bilbo Swaggins	2014-06-02	I'm so pumped for this episode! In the S4 Weapons and Training video, it was stated that the battle north of the Wall and the attack from the South will happen AT THE SAME TIME. From the previews, it looks like most of the Night's Watch will fight off the Thenns and Tormund's raiders. (I still have no clue how Tormund will escape/live). After they kill everyone coming from the south, the fight will focus more on the battle with Mance's army. At some point, the battle will come to a stalemate and Jon will get sent to treat with Mance. Then, in the last few minutes, Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!
4909	Tony Inchpractice	2014-06-02	The wildlings will win.
4910	cronnyberg	2014-06-02	looks like they're really going for it doesn't it!Â  Â Â 
Â 
I definitely think that dedicating the whole episode will work out for the best; It will allow for a real appreciation of the epic-ness of the whole thing; and apart from all that, it'll keep the unsullied guessing about Tyrion's fate for two whole weeks!Â  
Â 
I'm one of those who only started caring about Stannis after this battle, and I think that is how it's gonna play out in the show! When he finally rocks up out of nowhere when all seems lost to kick some wildling ass and save the day, its gonna be such a big payoff and people will finally realise how God damn awesome he is!Â  Â Â

4911	Daenor	2014-06-02	Thorne giving the heroic speech?Now that's a little bit strange.I was expecting this episode to pinpoint Jon's leading abilities which will lead to his election so now i'm even more curious how they are going to deliver that.Also something tells me that Jon will see Ygritte's death live(if he doesn't kill her himself) and not just find her dying
4912	Conchobar	2014-06-02	I really hate the way no one seems to use shields in this show in battle.
4913	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-06-02	Ser Vardis and Beric Dondarrion used shields, if I ever recall so correctly.
4914	Conchobar	2014-06-02	Shields are needed far more in battle than single combat They were not just for blocking your direct opponent, but leaving one of your sides of sight free while you searched the battlefield, rather than constantly worrying about an attack coming from any direction while you had on sword in your hand. Shields were essential.

					
					
							Edited by Cellio, 02 June 2014 - 07:21 PM.
4915	Rashtibram	2014-06-02	Please, let's not start arguing about the realism of battle. Quite apart from the no-helmet-or-shield issue, basically nothing about what Game of Thrones shows us (in terms of one-on-one combats as well as full-scale battles) is historically accurate. If you used medieval blades the way Jaime, Ned Stark, the Hound, etc. use them, they would all break after about five minutes (for example, you don't block with the sword; you block with your shield, and if you need to turn your opponents blade away with your own, you do so with the flat of it â<U+0080><U+0093> there's no hacking and hammering on each other's edges). This is cinematic fighting, not realistic fighting.
4916	JimbojoneS	2014-06-02	this season still has much more to show ( hopefully ) i expect at least ( within the chapter 9 & 10 )
STANNIS on the god damn Wall..
Arya and the Hound split
all the Kings Landing Madness
who knows if a surprise to Brienne and Podd..

Ep. 9 only focuses on the Wall.
4918	JimbojoneS	2014-06-02	Ep. 9 only focuses on the Wall.



i suppose that too, as the tittle of the chapter and previous episode's nÂo 9 being "special" in that meaning.
but, like i said, theres a lot of things still going on to wrap it all up in the Season finale, such as Arya/hound and most of all the Tyrion Killing spree + flee to Essos.. i hope we see all of it in this season.Â 
and for episode 9, who knows where they are gonna cut the Wall situation, Ygritte dying? Stannis joining? we will se a Lord Commander Jon this season? hmm..
4919	Shags the Dog	2014-06-02	I hope Stephen Dillane, Liam Cunningham and Carice do not appear in the opening credits just to play up on the surprise.
4920	go joff go	2014-06-02	I hope Stephen Dillane, Liam Cunningham and Carice do not appear in the opening credits just to play up on the surprise.that's actually an interesting point kit and maybe Sam's actor and maybe rose, I can't remember are the only other people in the opening credit. How in the world do they even shoot it.
4921	King Tommen	2014-06-02	I hope Stephen Dillane, Liam Cunningham and Carice do not appear in the opening credits just to play up on the surprise.


Â 
This fear is so unfounded.
Â 
1. You first have to assume that the viewing audience knows that these actors are playing their corresponding characters (many viewers have no idea what the actors' names are outside of the 4 or 5 top billed)
Â 
2. Then you have to assume people are even paying attention to the names flashing on the screen during the intro (as most of the audience are too busy watching the map sequence to notice the names).
Â 
3. Finally, the subset of the audience that is noticing both these things also has to realize that they only flash the names of the main cast actors appearing in that episode only. 99% of the audience doesn't know this because it's common practice for most shows to display all actors on the show whether they appear in the episode or not. Many on this site don't even realize that GoT does this.
Â 
4. Of the infinitesimal audience that knows all this and don't read the books, they're probably smart and perceptive enough to realize that this was happening anyways based on the hints given.

4922	NewJeffCT	2014-06-02	Will Stannis, Stannis, Stannis carry over into next season? Â I'm starting to think the big battle might be too much to get all in one episode? Â Or, do they get to that part at the end of the episode? Can they really justify Jon being named L-C in episode 10, as well as Stannis offering him Winterfell as Jon Stark? Â Will he be important enough in the battle to win the respect of all by Thorne & Slynt and a few others?
Â 
Tormund, Ygritte & the Thenns attack Castle Black from Molestown... that will take several minutes, since they have to give Ygritte a proper send-off and have Jon bemoan her death.
Â 
Then, we have them rallying the troops for Mance's attacks, and the giants in the tunnel... more time. Â Then, the wildings are thrown back for a bit? Â

They have an entire episode to work with. There will be more than enough time.
4924	Darth Pipes	2014-06-02	Ep. 9 only focuses on the Wall.


Â 
I have to admit being a little worried about this.Â  There are going to be very, very few of the show's stars in this one.Â  Rose Leslie and the guy who plays Tormund are technically leads but they've been mostly non-factors this season and Mance has been a complete non-factor on this show.Â  There's definitely talent with the guest stars like Owen Teale and Peter Vaughn.Â  But still, I don't think there's enough there for an entire episode.Â  They haven't exactly been building things up either.Â  There's also the fact that this battle will end the same exact way Blackwater did with a last-second rescue.Â  I wish they would consider doing what they did for the Red Wedding episode, where they cut into good stuff like Jon and Bran and the Wildings among others.
Â 
Hopefully I'm wrong though and this will turn out great.Â  I'm also hoping we eventually get a Jon and Davos scene out of all this.Â  I thought that was a missed opportunity in ADWD.

Exactly. What's more, a few friends I've recruited went marathon style and caught up, but always ffwd through the opening credits. I recently told them that the maps change based on relevance and they were floored. Makes sense, right? Unless someone tells you, you're just trying to get to the damn episode asap.Â 
Â 
I'd wager that under 2% of viewers pay attention to the credits, thus wouldn't notice if Dillane, Cunningham, et al, were included/excluded.Â

I agree. Except for the part where Stannis appears. The battle of Mole's town was different from the main battle with Mance Rayder. In my opinion, they might want to keep this as a smaller battle, as a build up to the main battle that will appear in the beginning of the next season.
Â 
My predictions for the next two episodes:
Â 
1) Ygritte dies. Expect a whole new stream of meme on facebook in which people curse GRRM
2) Lady Stoneheart appears.
3) Arya leaves.
4) Tywin is killed.
Â 
I would predict more, but the way the show is going, these 4 would take quite a lot of time. Anyone agrees?

Kristofer Hivju and Hannah Murray as well. It should be the fewest names ever and Kit Harington will receive top billing for the first time.
4928	Loodvip	2014-06-02	did you just see the promo ?? omg this is gonna be one of the most epic episodes ever !! and the most important thing is that we will watch it comfortably and happy knowing that stannis and the nights watch are going to kick the wildling assÂ  an no one we love so much will die (except of you love YigtyttÂ ):Â Â  )Â Â not like the last sad episode I!! did you see that larg mammoth leg !!!Â  Â and that gaint beating at the gate ( I think he is mag the mighty ) and the most perfect thing about the promo that they didn't show any thing about stannis !! cant wait to see the unsullied reaction I hope they don't show the letter scene from s3 before the intro
4929	Loodvip	2014-06-02	the watchers on the wall "" will only be (Â the wallXthe wall) from the infotmations HBO released and also the promo !! no supries here I always thought they will include complete ep for the wall events because the last chapters for jon`s in asos was full of epic events that cannot be divided into many episodes

4931	Konradsmith	2014-06-02	^I'm sure they'll still credit Team Dragonstone, surprise or no. Just like Charles Dance in Blackwater.
4932	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-06-02	No way ANY Stannis is even in the "Previously On."
4933	A Man Reads	2014-06-02	The "Stannis!" chant would be welcome. But I keep thinking back to "Stannis the Mannis" depicted in Blackwater. First off the ship, first on shore, first over the walls, last to flee -- and splicing open heads with Lightbringer. Do people think that we will get that Stannis again? I liked it in the show, but it would throw off the surprise factor from the books.
4934	The Drunkard	2014-06-02	Are they allowed to not show the names at the start?
Â 
I know Breaking Bad had to get special permission to jig around with the opening credits in Ozymandias, and that was just to delay them for a while.
4935	Konradsmith	2014-06-03	At most they'll show Sam sending the letter to the kings of Westeros in the previously on. Nothing more.
4936	Arya Targaryen	2014-06-03	If the ep. ends with the Stannis! chant, and we see some knights attacking the wildlings, an eagle burning, and the wildlings escaping, there is no need for Stannis actually making an appearance. So he can be left out of the opening credits. Same with Mel. They can cover what happened in ep.10, just like it was in the books. Jon never saw Stannis in the battle, only afterwards.
4937	HairGrowsBack	2014-06-03	So I've seen the French promo again and I can 99% confirm

gate with Grenn and co screaming in terror, and apparently wolves (which aren't
Ghost) attacking people.

4940	Konradsmith	2014-06-03	^Indeed. BTW do they dub GoT in France or just air it with subtitles?
Â 

	Spoiler  Also a damn shame about Pyp. Losing him and Grenn in one episode (or so it seems at least). Jon needs some buds next year, doesn't he? Well, so long as it's done well, I'll accept it. It's just that Josef Altin had inferred on twitter that he'd be back next year. I guess he was being purposefully misleading.

I don't think Olly features the promo, haven't seen him.

Â 
First the preparation for the battle south of the wall, then the battle itself with Ygritte dying. Then there is a brief calm before the massive army comes in from the North and fighting resumes.Â 
Â 
And how does it end? Do we see a cavalry of knights appear from the east flank of the wildling army and there is a brief frame with Stannis?
Â 
I don't know. Is what I just wrote more or less how this episode will go?
Â 
By the way, in another thread I wrote that there is still so much that takes place in book 3 that has yet to happen in season 4, that I think book 3 material will spill over into season 5! I wrote a list of all that has yet to take place and it only shrunk a little bit after episode 8.
4948	Konradsmith	2014-06-03	^It's been said in a couple of different interviews that the battle from the north and south have been combined into one. So there'll be some Wall-top defence going on at the same time as fighting Tormund and Styr's band. I imagine there'll be a calm after Ygritte dies and then we'll get the negotiations and Stan's arrival.

I don't want Jon's lads to go, but I wouldn't put it past the directors.

4951	SkaggCannibal	2014-06-03	I hope we get a conversation/guessing game on top of the Wall of who that is coming to their aid. I really liked how in the books Jon's first thought was Robert Baratheon, only for him to realize it is actually the much more awesome Stannis Baratheon. I'm also hoping on the burning eagle and a shot of King Stannis high on his horse while all his men are screaming his name, which is met with a stern look of course.
Â 
Hopes will be crushed when it's Mellisandre! Mellisandre! and Jon and Mance having signed a peace deal right before the attack.

4953	hallam	2014-06-03	Folk seem to be very confused about the plot. The battle at the wall can't be Mance trying to get through and the arrival of Stannis because the Iron bank hasn't given the money yet. And they won't do that until Cersei has stiffed them which can only happen after Tywin is dead.
Â 
This battle is going to be theÂ raid on Castle Black from the southÂ in which Ygritte is killed. The northern attack on the wall is still to come.
Â 
Which means that Tywin's death is the major event in episode 9 which was always to be expected as it gives time to address the aftermath in episode 10: Cersei stiffs the bank, Tyrion to Pentos and we meet up with the children of the forrest.
4954	Turncloak_	2014-06-03	I have hope they do Stannis justice in this episode since they gave Sansa fan service in episode 8 by making her a player much earlier than the books.

How is Stannis more awesome? Robert is the better fighter, the more charismatic of the two, the one with a sense of humour, and he'd tell the red woman and her gods to F right off. Stannis is supremely overrated here and will be flayed within a book or two.
4959	of man and wolf	2014-06-03	Are they allowed to not show the names at the start?

I know Breaking Bad had to get special permission to jig around with the opening credits in Ozymandias, and that was just to delay them for a while.

Can't completely agree with you there. It was a solid episode but not in my top 10. Grey Worm/Missandei fanfiction was not my cup of tea. Also, Emilia's acting is really distracting especially in the Jorah banishment scene. Jorah's actor nocked it out of the park though. Also, I wish the fight was more faithful to the book and the editing was slower paced much like Achilles vs Hector of Troy.
Also Stannis has come off as a gigantic a-hole in the show. I'm really hoping this episode goes along way in redeeming his character but I will temper my hopes until I see it unfold on screen

You've got about 28 things wrong in this post so it's hard for me to point out the specifics. A re-read of the books, a look at this week's promo and a quick read of this thread should help you out.

No I don't want Pyp, Grenn and possibly Edd to die :'(. They are still alive in the books. But I guess I brought this on myself. I've always complained about Kit's acting and hoped that Grenn would replace Donal Noye in his sacrifice scene to give Kit's actor better material to have reactions of. This season Kit has really stepped up to the plate though. I just hope one or two of the core 3 make it out alive.

Â 
Different tastes for different folks Â 
Â 
I thought that this was the first big episode of the series where I didn't even have a minor nitpick. With Blackwater, the Hound and Bronn scene was something I didn't like, and, with Rains of Castamere, it was the Dany plot-line. Here, I loved every single scene.Â 
Â 
I think it's mainly book readers who didn't like the episode though (which I understand)- many news sites and people I've talked to are calling it one of the best ever (which I agree with, of course!).
Â 
Anyways, sorry for the off-topic post :/

Â 
1) The Iron Bank has given Stannis funding. Re-watch episode 4x06.
2) Confirmed almost a year ago from multiple sources, including D&D and Neil Marshall, that both battles would be happening in the same episode.
3) Also confirmed around the same time that the entire episode would be devoted to the battle at Castle Black and the Wall.
4) Re-watch the promo. There are mammoths and giants, a glimpse of the "biggest fire the north has ever seen," etc.
Â 
Maybe take the time to read through some of the earlier speculation on this thread, re-watch the last three or four episodes, take a closer look at the promoâ<U+0080>¦you're pretty wildly off on all accounts.

4968	The Reckoner	2014-06-03	Well, what I like about Stannis is that he gets into the thick of the fighting with his men, and while he's going after people that I really hate, he also permitted the burnings and stuff. So he's not really good or evil. Just hellbent on claiming the throne.
4969	The Drunkard	2014-06-03	I have hope they do Stannis justice in this episode since they gave Sansa fan service in episode 8 by making her a player much earlier than the books.


Â 
Yeeeeaaah so long as justice means having it play out like it did in the books, I'm not a fan of rushing his story like they did Sansa's. They did the same in season 2 with making Davos his Hand, and that didn't have near the same impact as it did in ASOS, plus it deprived season 3 of that moment (which really could've used it).

If they stick to the book than that will go miles in improving Stannis' characterization. I think the show runners were throwing Sansa fans a bone since many have been whining about her on the show and the fact that they took away her "not kneeling" moment in episode 3.
4971	Guard of the Rainking	2014-06-03	How is Stannis more awesome?

Robert may be the better fighter, but Stannis is the better commander. Robert is also more charismatic, but Stannis is overall the better leader. Robert may have a better sense of humor, but Stannis' jokes are waaaay funnier.Â

Â 
thats gona be great IMO, theres no need to show KL, Eyrie, Meereen, Winterfell this ep...maybe Bran since its been about 4 eps since we've seen him, but i definitely wana see full focus being given to the Wall and the Battle...been building up since S2 after all

Ah I see. So since he is there in the tv show, are we expected to believe that Ghost is just going to be sleeping through this attack, when in all likelihood they wont show him doing anything during it?
4975	sati	2014-06-03	If the ep. ends with the Stannis! chant, and we see some knights attacking the wildlings, an eagle burning, and the wildlings escaping, there is no need for Stannis actually making an appearance. So he can be left out of the opening credits. Same with Mel. They can cover what happened in ep.10, just like it was in the books. Jon never saw Stannis in the battle, only afterwards.


If they did that I'd be furious.

Definitly ! And Ghost is maybe the most "important" of the direwolves (well, there's Summer as well). They have to fully establish him. And now is the perfect opportunity. We probably never saw him in the promos because the CGI was not finished but now, I feel like we're gonna see him fight by the side of Jon, at least during the fight south at Castle Black.Â 
Â 
And if Ghost aint with Jon in that scene where he rides alone under the tunnel to go North, it would be a shame !Â

5005	alcasinoroyale	2014-06-03	I guess this episode will feature the least main characters if it's all about the Battle on the Wall. It will only have Jon Snow, Sam, Ygritte, Tormund, and Gilly with Stannis, Melisandre, and Davos showing up at the very end. I assume that it will cover the following chapters from A Storm of Swords:
Chapter 55: Jon VII - Ygritte's death
Chapter 64: Jon VIII - Jon firing arrows at the giants and mammoths
Chapter 73: Jon X - Mance is captured and The Night's Watch shouting Stannis
Maybe Chapter 76: Jon XI - Jon meeting with Stannis and Melisandre but I could see that being in the season finale.Â

It's definitely a wolf, but it doesn't look white

I used the effects I normally use on Stannis scenes and it works there but here it's way too dark
5015	Nick_Scryer	2014-06-03	Holy Shit this episode looks amazing! The visuals are incredible even from a low quality video. Wow, can't wait!!
5016	Guard of the Rainking	2014-06-03	Anyone else think we'll get a new Stannis theme? The Warrior of Light is great and all, but IMO it doesn't fit scene. Maybe Stannis' very own version of the Baratheon theme?
Â 
Edit. Maybe: Stannis Just Can't Wait to be the King Who Cared

I doubt it. Episode 10 is going to be packed with stuff, and they're even presumably ending storylines for the season in episode 8 (the Boltons and the Eyrie) because there's no room for them in episode 10.
5020	The hairy bear	2014-06-03	I think it's at least possible we will see some of Stannis/Melisandre/etc. earlier in the episode, too, maybe on a boat, without specifying destination.I think that wouldn't be a wise decision, scriptwise. The arrival of Stannis has to be a surprise, and if we see him in ships going to a mystery lcoation and afterwards we spend the entire episode at the Wall, it will be very easy to deduce what's going to happen.Although I fear that the surprise will be spoiled anyway by the "previously on GoT" at the begining of the episode, as every scene will be at the Wall except for the Dragonstone one at the end of last season where Davos urges Stannis to go to the Wall.
5021	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-03	Spoiler  Also a damn shame about Pyp. Losing him and Grenn in one episode (or so it seems at least). Jon needs some buds next year, doesn't he?


	Spoiler Jon sends all his friends away in ADWD, so I've always felt they were prime candidates to join the 'alive in the books but dead on the show' camp.

Â 
I don't think they'd do that. Especially with all the other scenes in recap clip being the Wall team, team Dragonstone would stand out so much. It would be the equivalent of showing Beric scene and then Cat dying as the last thing in the recap for ep.10
5023	Chebyshov	2014-06-03	Anyone remember if in the "previously on" for the Blackwater episode they showed the scene of LF talking to Marg or Renly vowing to kill Stannis? I'd be surprised if they gave it away in the recap portion. Listing actors is where they might mess up.
Â 
But is it really a spoiler? I thought they were explicit about Stan's plans last season.
Â 
EDIT: I know that was awhile ago, I'm just surprised how many Unsullied have completely forgotten about it.

Â 
Before any king Stannis named died, I wouldn't call that a huge spoiler. People might have thought that was just to remind us of Stannis's mindset/place in the story. I'm not sure how many Unsullied believed the leeches meant that Robb, Balon, or Joffrey was really going to die that episode. Showing Mel saying "the true war is to the north," isn't really veiled.Â

To be fairÂ  the leap 'leech burning - the gigantic massacre' is bigger than 'Stannis hears he has to go north - Stannis goes North'
Â

Wow! Awesome work! Looks like we get Ghost on a spree, and methinks I saw Sam with a crossbow!

Thank you!  Yeah it's Sam with a crossbow. The wolf looks Ghost's size and it can be flames, but the video is so dark no amount of my slowmotion/brightness/sharpening photoshop maneuvers proves helpful here

Well, we can definitely see mammoths, and no amount of photoshop maneuvers can take that away! Brilliant! I just got excited for this episode now after seeing these.
I'm gonna believe it's Ghost, as that (to me) is the best explanation. Jon also looks pretty badass in all those gifs.

I'm surprised at that too. I thought they'd made it really obvious, but now this season they've been acting like it never happened.
I really hope D&D keep Jon's line, "You came because we sent for you, I hope. Though I could not say why you took so long about it." It would be a nice meta-shot at themselves.

It's obviously working. Two of my unsullied friends are convinced Stannis will use his new gold to hire more men to attack King's Landing again on the day Tyrion is to be executed, inadvertently saving his life.

5036	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-06-03	[SPOILERS] - My Speculation
Â 
Pre-fight: We'll get some scenes of the various parties preparing for the battle. Definitely one with Ygritte and company at a camp fire, in which the Thenn warg uses his owl to witness Mance's signal and lets the group know that "it's time." Apparently, a scene between Jon and Sam on top of the Wall while they're on patrol. A scene where a Night's Watchman blows the horn for wildlings. Another one with Ser Alliser Thorne giving a grand speech to rouse the Night's Watch. Hopefully, we'll get something with Mance.
Attack from the South: During the night, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr and co. will raid Castle Black. There's shots in the trailers of them running down a trail towards the gates while taking arrow fire, shots of them climbing over the front gate, and several shots of them fighting the Night's Watchmen throughout the castle, in the yard and on the catwalks, including a fight between Jon and Styr. It looks like there will also be some fighting on the elevator platform. In the books, Ygritte dies while storming the castle, so naturally I'm gonna assume she meets a similar fate on screen. It's pretty likely, in this one's humble opinion, that the orphan boy Olly will be the one to kill her. A new addition (not from the books) is a battle between Tormund and Alliser. I say Tormund will win, because I can't believe he would be upgraded to regular status only to be quickly killed off, but I wonder if Alliser survives (I doubt it; his leadership during the battle would make it really hard for Jon to win the following election). At some point, there will be a scene in the tunnel under the Wall, in which some black brothers fight off a giant who is trying to break down the inner gate. I expect Grenn will take over Donal Noye's role in the novel by slaying, and being slayed by, the mighty giant.
Attack from the North: In the book, this part follows the failed attack from the south, but I believe the two battles will take place simultaneously on the show, and will be intercut. This would mean Jon won't be up on top of the Wall to lead the men, unfortunately. Jon IS up on top at some point, though (and in that shot, there is a scarecrow behind him - it looks like those are in!). He sees Mance's signal (the Haunted Forest on fire, or a sea of torches?) from the parapets, but I assume he eventually goes down to fight in the yard while some others hold the Wall. There are several shots in the trailers of wildlings and even a mammoth marching through the trees and grouping up for a mass battle cry in front of the Haunted Forest. We haven't seen a lot of footage from the actual attack in the promotional videos, though. A few shots of Night's Watch bowmen loosing arrows down at the approaching horde, some leaning too far out and some falling, while the battlements around them explode into splinters. Down below, we see some wildlings running towards the Wall and the ones reaching it being thrown back by a blast, apparently from barrels thrown down from up above. Also, a mammoth turning away from some sort of explosion at the gate.
Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!: I wonder what causes Jon to venture north to treat with Mance, if he does so at all? Having Janos and Alliser arrive earlier than in the novels has compromised their role in this subplot. Alliser is probably going to die and, even if he doesn't, why would they send him? He's also proven himself at court and during battle. I can see this instead: Jon goes up to the top of the Wall during a break in the fighting, takes account of how few men they have left, looks at Mance's vast host, says "we're fucked" or something along those lines, and decides to go treat with Mance, willing to sacrifice himself to possibly salvage the situation. Whatever the case, there is a trailer shot of a distressed Mance running around his camp and many of Stannis' cavalry running down the confused and disorganized wildlings. There are shots in the trailers of Jon riding inside the ice tunnel of the Wall; this could be him going to see Mance, but it could just as easily be something else cut from earlier in the season. There is an extra shot of Jon in the tunnel, with Sam holding a torch and looking morose. This could be Sam accompanying Jon on his way to Mance, briefly looking at the remains of Grenn and the giant, or it could be them welcoming Stannis to Castle Black, although I think that will happen in episode ten.
Loose Ends: Will we see Stannis during his charge? I hope so. I want a brave, heroic Stannis moment. Will we see Davos during the battle or not until the finale? Melisandre lighting Orell's eagle on fire? I assume the eagle will come back into play during the battle (why else have it get away alive last season?). Pyp will get shot in the neck by an arrow at some point, but I'm not sure if he dies from it. I wonder if the arrow is from Ygritte? What does Sam do during the battle? He WILL reunite with Gilly, but I'm not sure if this happens in episode nine or ten. We see him in the promo running around with a crossbow. Maybe he kills somebody? According to an interview, one of the major deaths this season was filmed to be in slow-motion. It wasn't Lysa or Oberyn, and I hope it isn't Tywin, so I'm going to assume it will be Ygritte or Pyp. In the trailers, there are several more shots I didn't discuss above. There was a scene in the Foreshadowing video of Sam and Jon discussing Ygritte; this could be a scene from the pre-battle section of this episode, or it could have been cut from an earlier episode or be from the season finale. Finally, there is a shot of a bunch of burning men around a burning man getting dragged through the snow by a rope. If it wasn't for the snow, I would think this was the dragons getting chained up. It still could be, if their intention was to replace the snow with sand in post-production. If not, what could it be? Some sort of trap or them getting dragged by a mammoth?
Â 
Let me know if I am missing anything or wrong on something.
5037	Konradsmith	2014-06-03	^I assume that Sam saying, "your wildling girl she's one of the raiders" is in this episode. So his info on that would have to either come from Olly or Gilly I think.
5038	sati	2014-06-03	I think Tormund meets with Jon in the tunnel and he takes him to Mace's camp. We see a shot of Mace running in one promo, I assume when the attack of Stannis' forces happen they will have confused Jon standing there showing him try to figure out the banners and then I think
Â 
1. either at the very end of the ep, Blackwater style, we see Stannis ride forth with the chant happening perhaps him, you know, riding victoriously in front of his army than looking straight at Jon and the ep ends
Â 
2. Stannis is wearing a helmet and we see him cut down some wildlings and then before the chant/banner reveal he removes his helmet.
Â 
I like 1 better but the 2nd gives Stannis more ass kicking to do
5039	protar	2014-06-03	Well, we can definitely see mammoths, and no amount of photoshop maneuvers can take that away! Brilliant! I just got excited for this episode now after seeing these.

5042	Stark11	2014-06-03	I don't know if unsullied will get that Stannis is going there even with the recap. The episode should be so packed full of awesomeness that halfway through they will completely forgot about Stannis.
Also I watch the show with a few unsullied and they didn't expect Jorah getting banished even with the recap which I thought made it completely obvious.

5047	Rashtibram	2014-06-03	I doubt they'd include Stannis' decision to go north in the recap. What Unsullied are supposed to think right now (and what has been indicated by his scenes this season â<U+0080><U+0093> particularly in 4x03) is that hearing of Joffrey's murder gave Stannis renewed hope of mounting an assault on King's Landing. It's definitely still intended to be a complete surprise.

5068	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-03	Goood, I'm so MEGA-hyped now *_____* Even more than I was already all the time, this going to be awesome!!!
I just wonder how many NW members will die? On the show they are now only 105 (or 102 according to Edd) brothers, and Thorne and Pyp  (IF they should die) won't certainly be the only casualties... Even if the Watch would just lose Thorne&Pyp + a very few nameless crows and many of Stannis' men would die and even more of Mance's men die or flee - The ratio NW members : Stannis' men / Wildlings would be still very extreme at Castle Black in the future (extremer than in the books).
Even if only 10 crows die, that'd mean ~10% overall...
5069	A Redeemed Hound	2014-06-03	They are really doing the entire battle with Mance and Tormund? Â It seems like it but there was zero Mance build up and zero wildling army build up. Â And I guess Stannis won't be there to save everyone? Â I am not sure how they are going to cover this battle. Â I am having huge doubts about it now. Â All season, they have dropped the ball with the story of Jon Snow and the plight of the Night's Watch. Â Instead of ending the show at 9:50, take some extra time showing Mance, developing the size of his army, etc. Â Show more Ygritte and her feelings about Jon Snow's betrayal.

5070	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-03	There has been pretty much no build up for the Wildling army this season, yes there have built up Tormund and Tgritte but pretty much nothing of Mance.Â
5071	Haldebrandt	2014-06-03	I'm on the record as being very skeptical of this episode, but those shots of great fires are enticing.
Â 
I'm still dreading a collection of cliches, and stuff like "This day we fight" or the speculations of Jon earning Thorne's respect aren't exactly filing me with confidence. Â What's next, Sam rescues Gilly from a Wildling at the last second? Ugh. Â As I typed that, I realized that was totally gonna happen.
Â 
Well I guess we'll know in 5 days...
5072	14ccKemistk	2014-06-03	Kristofer Hivju and Hannah Murray as well. It should be the fewest names ever and Kit Harington will receive top billing for the first time.


Â 
Yes, normally we have 13-18 names in the opening credits. This time it will only be 4(!) if they omit the Stannis team for the sake of surprise:
- Kit Harrington
- John Bradley
- Rose Leslie
- Kristofer Hivju
Â 
Also, will the entire opening sequence maybe only be on the Wall?
5073	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-03	They won't leave Team Stannis out of the credits. I'm pretty sure that kind of thing is contractually obligated.
5074	14ccKemistk	2014-06-03	They won't leave Team Stannis out of the credits. I'm pretty sure that kind of thing is contractually obligated.

Well, in episode 405, Varys was uncredited but appeared anyway...
But I guess you are right but I _hope_ you are wrong.
5075	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-03	Do you guys think the burning eagle will still be included now that Orell is dead? I realize that he was also dead in the book, but the eagle was still hanging around the group and I haven't noticed it in the show. I really hope it is included.
5076	StannisForKing299AL	2014-06-03	We all know that something happens on the 9th episode, the first season was Ned's execution, the second was the Battle of Blackwater, the third was the Red Wedding, what do you think the fourth will be? I know it's a couple months away, but still. Personally, I think it could be Tywin's death, and parts of the Battle on the Wall, etc. I can't think of hat else happened at the end of ASOS, if anyone else has any predictions, I'd love to hear them for this episode.
Definatly the battle of the wall. Its a pretty long battle so maybe the directors will do a battle of the blackwater type episode where the story stays at the wall the whole way through without a change in location. I think theyd have to since if i remember correctly the battle of castle black is pretty looooong...
As for Tywins death and Tyrions escape i see that been the end poiny of the series seeing as how it ties up  the loose ends of Tyrions story and lets his travel be picked up in season 5. This sadly means we likely wont see coldhands this series, or in possibly at all, which if hes who people think he is could cause a bit of a problem in the future.
5077	hallam	2014-06-03	There has been pretty much no build up for the Wildling army this season, yes there have built up Tormund and Tgritte but pretty much nothing of Mance.Â 


Â 
Glad I'm not the only person who noticed that.
Â 
I don't see how the wilding attack is going to be done with this season. I have seen the promo and I don't see huge fight scenes with 100,000 men. I see a raiding party that is maybe meant to be a thousand but not main attack from the North.
Â 
The way to build up the Wildings is gradually, first the small attack that almost kills them, then Jon goes to try to assassinate Mance, then the full scale attack and Stannis comes in.
Â 
The producers have a whole season to fill but some people insist that we go pretty much to the end of the Castle Black material before the end of this season.
Â 
And I don't see any proof that the episode is only about the wall either. I don't quite expect the intro to read 'Tyrion escapes and goes to off his dad'.
Â 
We have two episodes left in which we have to see Ygritte killed, Shae killed, Tywin killed, Bran meets the children of the forrest and if she is going to appear at all, Lady Stoneheart. That is plenty of stuff without an hour long battle scene that isn't necessary and quite likely to be rather boring because there hasn't been the prep work.
Â 
Cersei hasn't stiffed the bank yet. If Stannis could get to the wall without their money then why bring them up at all? Cersei has to stiff the bank while the viewers remember the bank scenes. Which means she has to do it this season which means that Tywin has to die in episode 9.
Â 
I am pretty sure we are getting Stoneheart because the Brienne plot needs her. I also suspect that Stoneheart is the reason we are not getting Coldhands. Introducing two undead characters in the space of a few episodes would be stretching it a bit. Coldhands would diminish Stoneheart.Â
5078	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-03	I feel like Â I'm not going to be able to see anything for half this episode. Not that I don't love the dark scenes...


Seriously I could barely see anything in that promo video.Â

Â 
The inclusion of Ygritte and Jon in the cave makes me very happy. Her last words will be similar to those in the book 
Â 
And it looks like the greatest fire the North has ever seen will start off the episode...interesting.

Â 
I suggest a re-watch of the episode of Stannis going to the Iron bank. You know that scene where Davos goes to Saan in the brothel and gives him that pile of money? That's the loan from the IB that they were able to secure after Davos gave his big speech to them. The IB are hedging their bets with the Lannisters by giving Stannis enough money to get some of his forces together. Once Cersei full out rejects them in S5, they'll throw their full support behind Stannis as they do in the books.
Â 
Stannis has Saan's fleet as well as his 5000 men (which he mentioned in the IB scene). Selyse, Shireen and Mel are meeting them at the Wall (as they mentioned in the next episode during their conversation).
Â 
The only thing they haven't done is say "HEY EVERYBODY, WE'RE GOING TO THE WALL" because, y'know, the producers are wanting to keep it a surprise for the audience. But for anyone who's paying attention (and especially those who supposedly have read the books and know what's going to happen) it's pretty clear.

Anyone else think we'll get a new Stannis theme? The Warrior of Light is great and all, but IMO it doesn't fit scene. Maybe Stannis' very own version of the Baratheon theme?
Â 
Edit. Maybe: Stannis Just Can't Wait to be the King Who Cared


yeah, i really hope he gets some actual beratheon love. his theme is too dark. it fits some of the darker stuff and all the stuff with mel, but this should be victorious music

So then basically you must hate every battle ever filmed...
5085	Arkash	2014-06-03	I just wonder how many NW members will die? On the show they are now only 105 (or 102 according to Edd) brothers, and Thorne and Pyp  (IF they should die) won't certainly be the only casualties... Even if the Watch would just lose Thorne&Pyp + a very few nameless crows and many of Stannis' men would die and even more of Mance's men die or flee - The ratio NW members : Stannis' men / Wildlings would be still very extreme at Castle Black in the future (extremer than in the books).
Even if only 10 crows die, that'd mean ~10% overall...


Â 
Just checked the Wiki about the Night's Watch.
Â 
At the election of the new commander, there are approximatively 600 votes (including voters from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and Shadow Tower). If in the show there is only 100 men left at CB, it must be even less at the two other castles. I understand the reasoning to lower down the battle on TV but I hope the show says something like there is 200 men at EbtS and 100 at the ST to add more credibility to the Watch.

I really love that it ends with the two horn blasts.
Â 
I'm glad there is no mention of Stannis and only talk of giant (to keep some surprise).
Â 
The reminder of Jon / Slynt tension is interesting, I think it will truly pay off during the episode ! Makes my hopes high again about Jon being sent alone to treat with Mance.
Â 
A lot of focus on the Jon / Ygritte storyline. I know it's what makes many viewers most interested about this storyline but I hope the episode truly takes time to give some moment to all the other characters up there :Â 
Â 
- Sam.
- Tormund.
- Mance.
- Grenn.
- Dolorous Edd.
- Pyp.
- Styr.
- Gilly.
- Aemon.
- Thorne.
- Slynt.
- Thenn Warg.
- Mag the Giant ?
- Ghost !
Â 
All these characters deserve to have at least spoken lines (yeah, even Ghost ! ^^) if not whole moments for themselves !Â

No, I just hate cliches, and I should hope you do too. Â Blackwater was terrific. Â The speeches were original. Â Sure Pod saved Tyrion but the whole thing was very fast, not the sort of drawn out, knife-her-throat damsel in distress situation that soils the third act of every other hollywood flick. Â And it actually served a purpose in the plot, it wasn't inserted there as a boilerplate scene.
Â 
Even the arrival was of the "cavalry" was handled very well. Â It wasn't telegraphed. Â You weren't sitting there thinking: "OK, they are totally fucked, now someone is gonna show up right in the nick of time." Â Really, there is virtually nothing in Blackwater that I can recall being cliche.
Â 
That's why I'm really hoping that Stannis actually does arrive during the parley.

Â 
I really think all the time that was spent introducing the Thenns and showing the Wildings raid villages/Jon's trek to Craster's should have been spent on the "first" smaller battle South of the Wall. 
Â

Â 
I'll raise you a Tyrion "rally the men with a rousing speech just as all seems lost", an army poised but still not attacking while a dumbfounded Joffrey asks why they aren't doing anything before Tyrion gives his "now" signal to unleash the "big trap" on the enemy, the overwhelmed defending army retreating into the inner gates as the siege presses forward, the ladies and children all cowering in a confined space listening to the sounds of the battle, the Hound about to get cut down, but saved by his begrudging ally Bronn's arrow at the last moment with a knowing wink afterwards etc. etc.

Battles are battles, there are cliches all over the place my friend.

Â 
I'm sure there will be a quieter scene with their crew at the beginning of the episode when we'll finally get our Tormund - Ygritte conversation about motives !
Â 
EDIT : And pause at 26 seconds of the preview.Â Apparently the Watch is going to hang archers with a rope down the Wall to fire at the Wildlings belowÂ !

We're also going to get very close to the book dialogue between Jon and Ygritte (you're not going to did, we should have stayed in that cave, etc.), and I'm guessing giants galavanting through the tunnel. Wondering why they showed all three of Ygritte's shots fired on Jon...is she going to have three arrows in her for symmetry? And, of course, we're going to have the biggest fire the North has ever seen (go watch the French promo...looks awesome),

Â 
I think it's possible. They did keep Orell's jealousy storyline and the scars he gave Jon after he had to warg into his eagle to escape death. I hope he'll be in.
Â 
Â 
As for the recap: I am really looking forward to this episode now, even though I definitely count The Wall pre-LC-election as one of the most boring story lines in the book (and show). Those battles will be epic. I'm also looking forward to seeing why they included the Janos Slynt confrontation in the recap.

People love them when the stakes matter. Â For now, it's been rather difficult to care about much that's going on up there.
Â 
I do find it funny that no matter how many major or beloved characters the show unexpected kills, few seriously believe that Jon or even Tyrion will die.
Â 
More interestingly, no one seems to contemplate the possibility of an actual wildling invasion. Â That maybe, these people might just breach the wall and upset the balance of power in the 7Ks. Â It just doesn't seem like a credible threat for some reason, despite the savagery of the Moles Town attack, and the presence of cannibals among the invaders
Â 
That's another difference with Blackwater: A Stannis win would have dramatically altered the story. Â But what happens if the Wildlings win? Â Man, now I wish they would. Â But we're getting them in the North next year anyway.

Â 
Indeed.. they are also quite uneasy after last week (with many saying things like "Jon Snow better not die!") .. I hope they set up a sense of impending death for Jon when he goes to treat with Mance beyond the Wall just to torture viewers before Stannis shows up. (not sure how this will go down if Thorne isn't there, but there are some ideas for it mentioned already that I think would work)

5119	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-04	I really hate that Ygritte isn't dead already. We've now been an entire season removed from her character and her relationship with Jon. Who even remembers how funny she can be? Who even remembers how adorable she & Jon were together? I feel it's really going to undercut the emotional power of her death scene.

Who even remembers how funny she can be? Who even remembers how adorable she & Jon were together? I feel it's really going to undercut the emotional power of her death scene.


Â 
That's why I strongly believed that she had to be killed in episode 10 last season.... Anyway, there's still hope for some strong material for Jon-Ygritte. There's a discussion about her between Sam and Jon in the trailers that we haven't seen yet... and the previously on features Ygritte VERY prominently.
5121	clawson24	2014-06-04	I love South Park but GoT doesn't really have much male nudity. That was an off-base observation on their part. Rome on the other hand...


Â 
I know it's OT but I agree. Seemed like kind of a stupid oversimplication of the show for that to be the one aspect that they go on and on and on about. I'm a pretty big South Park fan but was sort of disappointed in the GoT ep.
5122	Abyssalix	2014-06-04	Â 
Glad I'm not the only person who noticed that.
Â 
I don't see how the wilding attack is going to be done with this season. I have seen the promo and I don't see huge fight scenes with 100,000 men. I see a raiding party that is maybe meant to be a thousand but not main attack from the North.
Â 
The way to build up the Wildings is gradually, first the small attack that almost kills them, then Jon goes to try to assassinate Mance, then the full scale attack and Stannis comes in.
Â 
The producers have a whole season to fill but some people insist that we go pretty much to the end of the Castle Black material before the end of this season.
Â 
And I don't see any proof that the episode is only about the wall either. I don't quite expect the intro to read 'Tyrion escapes and goes to off his dad'.
Â 
We have two episodes left in which we have to see Ygritte killed, Shae killed, Tywin killed, Bran meets the children of the forrest and if she is going to appear at all, Lady Stoneheart. That is plenty of stuff without an hour long battle scene that isn't necessary and quite likely to be rather boring because there hasn't been the prep work.
Â 
Cersei hasn't stiffed the bank yet. If Stannis could get to the wall without their money then why bring them up at all? Cersei has to stiff the bank while the viewers remember the bank scenes. Which means she has to do it this season which means that Tywin has to die in episode 9.
Â 
I am pretty sure we are getting Stoneheart because the Brienne plot needs her. I also suspect that Stoneheart is the reason we are not getting Coldhands. Introducing two undead characters in the space of a few episodes would be stretching it a bit. Coldhands would diminish Stoneheart.Â 


Â 
This is why they said that the finale would be one of the best episodes that we will see.
Plus they said that there was a battle in the finale that was so heavily-reliant on VFX that they finished post-production like a few weeks ago (CoTF vs. WW) perhaps?
Â 
Plus the finale is like 66 minutes long, making it the longest game of thrones episode to air, ever. beating valar morghulis (64 minutes)
5123	clawson24	2014-06-04	I really hate that Ygritte isn't dead already. We've now been an entire season removed from her character and her relationship with Jon. Who even remembers how funny she can be? Who even remembers how adorable she & Jon were together? I feel it's really going to undercut the emotional power of her death scene.


Â 
While I do largely agree with your point, I think maybe even just the dialogue between Ygritte and Jon as she lays dying will be enough to conjure up most of that emotional resonance.
5124	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	^Rose Leslie can convey a lot in very little time. I mean, she hasn't spoken since "Two Swords" but even just her "shhh" in 408 was a well-acted moment. She'll sell her death scene properly and summon up the requisite feels from the audience.
Â 
Also she'll likely talk about Jon before the battle and we know that Jon and Sam WILL talk about her. So there we have it. I think it's pretty ballsy on the showrunners' part to leave characters out for so many episodes. They finally trust the Unsullied that they won't forget who someone is without endlessly checking in on people every episode even when they have nothing to do.

5125	HairGrowsBack	2014-06-04	Her death will work out, I've no doubts, especially if they stcik to the books and give her her dying speech.
5126	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	^Which the recap seems to hint at strongly by showing them in the cave again.
5127	LadyAryaBaratheon	2014-06-04	I'm very curious to see how this will play out.
Â 
Idiot leader guy giving orders, blah blah blah
Â 
Will they send Jon out to meet with Mance? Effectively cutting the battle into 2 battles as in the book.Â 
Â 
Will we meet Dalla and Val?
5128	HairGrowsBack	2014-06-04	^Which the recap seems to hint at strongly by showing them in the cave again.


Yep, hope they'll keep the castle bit as well.
5129	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	I'm sure it will be somewhat abridged (to the chagrin of some of us) or even somewhat altered, but Rose Leslie will do it justice. She's tasteful enough not to make it melodramatic and do a big death rattle and flop around like a fish. She'll play it right.

5130	Sun	2014-06-04	Th promo looks really dark (as in lighting) to me. I'm finding it really hard to make out details. I'm going to find it really annoying if the entire battle is filmed in low light.Â

Check that. The lighting looks much better in the HBO promoÂ https://www.youtube....h?v=rEVGHvMt6yo

 Â But I think they will be surprised by how much they enjoy it. The wholeÂ episode is pretty muchÂ an epic battle and people don't seem aware of this.
Personally, I think it will be better than Blackwater. It has a very LotR/ Battle of Hogwarts feel to it...just me? People love epic "these odds suck!"Â fantasy battles.


I agree. I just think that for some reason the possibility of a Wildling success hasn't even entered some people's radars. Hopefully that will change as they actually watch the episode.
Â 
One particularly ironic YouTube comment really made me laugh: The only thing more boring than Jon Snow and the Wall is dumb Stannis.
5132	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-06-04	FUCK YEAH MAMMOTHS! Wasn't expecting that to make the cut.
5133	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-04	Well, I don't know "your" Unsullied, but my Unsullied family/friends are jonesing for finally again a big battle. It's still a medieval fantasy series and people expect awesome battles in a medieval fantasy series, don't they? And Blackwater was now two years ago...
And even if they are not yet interested in the Wall stuff/Jon/Wildlings (and I know, many aren't), as long as they begin to watch nevertheless, I expect them to be very surprised and I think they'll enjoy the ep. more and more (especially if it's really starts with the "greatest fire the North has ever seen", that'll be an exciting beginning).
And I for myself know people who definitely care for Jon, Sam, aso. and are aware of the great threat. My mother already knows ca. 3/4 of what will happen, but I know she'll be very sad when Ygritte dies (even more if it happens as in the books) and my sister'll be afraid of Jon's and Sam's fate the whole episode...
And c'mon, people now need so much a "feel good moment"! I've read about so many Unsullied who are EXTREMELY depressed after Oberyn's death and see GoT now even more as a show where ALWAYS ALL good guys die and some are really extreme with their thinking of "The good guys lose and the bad guys win all the time". Some people except the battle to be a bloodbath and that simply the NW will get slaughtered (What else should you think about 102 vs. 100.000?!).
Hell, I've read about people who think the NW won't exist and matter anymore in the future, and the story will be about how Roose and Balon deal with hundred tousand Wildlings XD 
For the reason alone that this episode ends well, has an happy end (despite "OMG, it's the 9th episode! We all know what that means..." and "102 vs. 100.000 CAN'T end well" and their mood after last episode) it will have an surprise for many.
I myself hope "The Watchers on The Wall" can bring a bit belief in justice and happiness back - Last epi. we saw the beautiful smiles and joy of Ramsay, Cersei, aso.; some cheering and victory for the NW+Stannis should do everyone good!
5134	Rashtibram	2014-06-04	Â 
This fear is so unfounded.
Â 
1. You first have to assume that the viewing audience knows that these actors are playing their corresponding characters (many viewers have no idea what the actors' names are outside of the 4 or 5 top billed)
Â 
2. Then you have to assume people are even paying attention to the names flashing on the screen during the intro (as most of the audience are too busy watching the map sequence to notice the names).
Â 
3. Finally, the subset of the audience that is noticing both these things also has to realize that they only flash the names of the main cast actors appearing in that episode only. 99% of the audience doesn't know this because it's common practice for most shows to display all actors on the show whether they appear in the episode or not. Many on this site don't even realize that GoT does this.
Â 
4. Of the infinitesimal audience that knows all this and don't read the books, they're probably smart and perceptive enough to realize that this was happening anyways based on the hints given.


This is actually a legitimate concern for me, because my Unsullied friends always read out all the names in the credits to determine who's going to be in the episode. They obviously don't remember who everyone is, so I have to clarify a whole lot; I suppose I'm just going to have to say Stephan Dillane is Pyp or something on this occasion.
5135	FNF	2014-06-04	I don't know where the doubt about Mammoths making the cut came from. I remember reading something months and months ago suggesting that this season was going to have all these insane fantasy elements...

Â 
Plus the guy months ago who wrote on Extras NI's Facebook page that he played a mammoth's leg.
5137	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-04	Stannis is coming
5138	ToTheWolves	2014-06-04	Folk seem to be very confused about the plot. The battle at the wall can't be Mance trying to get through and the arrival of Stannis because the Iron bank hasn't given the money yet. And they won't do that until Cersei has stiffed them which can only happen after Tywin is dead.
Â 
This battle is going to be theÂ raid on Castle Black from the southÂ in which Ygritte is killed. The northern attack on the wall is still to come.
Â 
Which means that Tywin's death is the major event in episode 9 which was always to be expected as it gives time to address the aftermath in episode 10: Cersei stiffs the bank, Tyrion to Pentos and we meet up with the children of the forrest.

I'm sorry if someone already answered this or if I'm misunderstanding what you are saying. We seen the iron bank give stannis the money a couple episodes back and it's confirmed that this episode will take place all at the wall and that the battles have been condensed into one big battle.
Again sorry if someone alread replied to this.
5139	ToTheWolves	2014-06-04	Goddammit! I don't know why I assumed GRRM was writing this episode. I was hoping he would do for Jon what he did for Stannis and the Hound in the "Blackwater" episode.Â 

This didn't even occur to me...now I just got a little worried. I'm sure it'll still be a great episode and I am putting this episode on a pedestal. D&D please don't let us down.
5140	Arrowtic	2014-06-04	I just hope that they make Stannis' arrival as epic as it was in the books . He arrives when Jon is desperate .(Kinda like Tywin in Blackwater)
Would love to see what people who mostly hate TV Stannis would say !(Assuming they don't destroy his arrival as well as most of his other scenes)
5141	~No One~	2014-06-04	I just watched the recap, and I have to agree, it seems as if the two horn blasts at the end are leading into a cold open. I would love this, but am doubtful. I'd love it if the two blasts cold opened into Gilly returning. Ironic and touching all at once 
The recap seems to confirm (yet again) that Olly kills Ygritte, that Slynt, not Thorne, is Jon's main antagonistic character, and that Ygritte will get her line in (yet again) as she dies in Jon's arms. 
I'm not concerned that GRRM didn't write it. Because, really, he already did, and they look to be sticking very, very closely to the books. And even if they don't, it'll be fantastic, from the looks of it.
For those worried about the lighting, Blackwater was just fine, and this'll be the same. I think we'll have a nice mix of dialogue scenes and action. Just give me some Maester Aemon, and I'll be happy!

5143	Carl Rhaego	2014-06-04	Is that Ygritte killing Pyp at 0:42 in the french promo?! Noooooo, dumb & dumber what are you doing? You can't just kill Jon's bro like that!
5144	ToTheWolves	2014-06-04	I only request two things of D&D for this episode ...just two! 
1.) Ghost being the badass that he is
2.)"STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS"
5145	King of the Road	2014-06-04	I'm in two minds about whether I want to hear 'Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!'.
Â 
Before anyone asks, I am a Stannis fan, both in the show and the books. I like the above line because it's Stannis' moment in the sun, where he gets to be the classic hero, gaining the admiration, if not love, that men always gave to Robert but denied to him. That said, it always felt a little out of place to me, Stannis isn't the kind of man that his men cheer for, and I doubt ever will be, it's the aspect of him that appeals to me; firm, honest and pragmatic. Won't win hearts or love, but it wins respect. Whether that respect amounts to chanting, that's another debate.Â 
Â 
Either way, line included or not, I'm hoping for some sort of effective reveal. If not chanting and charging, then show him with Davos and Melisandre, banners behind as his army sweeps the wildling forces away, the Dragonstone theme, or presumably some variation, playing in the background. Alternatively, try and keep some sort of mystery intact, Â if only to represent the wildling point of view, and have Stannis helmeted until Mance is brought before him. That could work.Â 
Â 
Really looking forward to this episode, it ought to be one of the finest yet, particularly given the unknown additions such as the role of Ser Alliser, Pyp, Grenn defending the gate, and of course Samwell Tarly's hopefully mad skills with the crossbow.
5146	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	Alliser Thorne will die at the gate he didn't want to ice up at the hands of a giant, whom he'll also kill, taking Donal Noye's place.Â  He was an ass, but he'll die heroically, because, quite honestly, he's still a bad-ass ranger.
Â 
The archer boy will put an arrow through Ygritte's brain.Â  Tormund will be captured and the Thenns will be eaten by the direwolf.
Â 
I see the attack by Mance's main host happening simultaneously to the attack behind the wall, and Stannis will come to the rescue a bit more quickly than he did in the book.Â  He'll offer to legitimize Jon and make him the Lord of Winterfell, but Jon'll refuse because of Melisandre's desire to burn the weirwoods and renounce the old gods.Â  Then they'll have the election for new lord commander, and Jon will win.
Â 
Akin to the Blackwater episode, this one will be entirely at one location, and it'll contain a season's worth of battles they couldn't afford to spread out over ten episodes.
5147	sati	2014-06-04	I really hope that the reveal is at first just him. No showing of Davos and Melisandre by his side. Not Team Dragonstone saves the day, STANNIS saves the day kind of moment.
Â 
Yeah, yeah I know that without them he wouldn't be there but I'd love for the credit going to him in that scene.
5148	DaveyJoe	2014-06-04	The archer boy will put an arrow through Ygritte's brain.Â 


Â 
Ygritte has to die in Jon's arms, telling him he knows nothing.Â  She can't die instantly to a headshot.
5149	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	Stannis' motive for rescuing the NW is solely to vaunt his claim to the IT.Â  His desire to vanquish the Others is secondary to his desire for the throne. He's a godless, heartless misanthrope in cahoots with a religious fanatic because he's p-whipped by her, he has a penchant for getting himself into battles he cannot win, and yet barely escapes each and every time.Â  The show portraying him in a bad light is quite accurate and on par with the books.Â  Only in these forums is he venerated like a pope.

Yeah, you're probably right. Perhaps she'll be wounded, give Jon her "You know nothing line," and the archer boy will walk up and put an arrow in her head to serve her justice.

Yeah, we know they're going to chat, because in the "previously on" it showed her saying the thing about staying in the cave. So you can bet we're going to get something like her book line: "Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>you remember that cave? We should have stayed in that cave. I told you so."

That is far more likely a shot of Jon and Sam talking before Jon goes to treat with Mance (some farewell sweet nothings perhaps). We know from the Stannis cavalry charge shots, that he doesn't arrive until the morning. The battle at CB will last through the night.

There's a shot in the trailers of Jon by himself on a horse going through the tunnels so it's going to happen. Probably why they have the shots of Jon running Slynt down in the "Previously on" since Slynt's going to be the one to send him (another clue that Thorne bites it during the battle).

To be fair, his queen's men shouting his name during nightfires all the time; you know, the "One realm, one god, one king! Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!" (Whether on Dragonstone or at The Wall ) or when they see Lightbringer, aso...
Say against them what you want, but guys like Horpe, Massey, Farring, Suggs, aso. are some of Stannis' most loyal knights and were/are with him at the Blackwater/Wall/Deepwood/Winterfell.
There are still of course king's men with Stannis at the Wall, but fewer than at Dragonstone, since some are with Edric and some the garnison at DS; even Jon noticed that Stannis surround himself more with QM (e.g. when they discuss plans) and wonders why he sees no KM with the king, but he heard they incurred Stannis' wrath at DS...
Davos explains to Manderly the KM still outnumber the QM, but even if there are a rather small group, I totally see the R'hllor worshippers chanting Stannis' name while/before charging and why shouldn't others (non-QM) participate?
I found the chanting always very fitting

Â 
Good point there at the end there, I never considered it from a religious perspective. If they all follow R'hllor then they presumably believe Stannis to be Azor Ahai. Still not sure about it, but it's an interesting slant to take.
5164	Father of Dragons	2014-06-04	I very much doubt that the episode starts immediately with the (first?) battle. There should be some set up.. Maybe 10-15 minutes. Then the first battle (at least 10), then a little talk amongst each other for about 5. Finally, if Jon goes to treat with Mance, he could walk into his nameless wife giving birth. I really thought the addition of Dalla in the books gave the Wildlings a sense of society. Val... I'm a bit iffy. I could see her being cut but I wouldn't mind either way. I'd really like it if when Jon is negotiating, there is a single blast from the horn and Mance runs outside, seeing cavalry charge towards him. The "Stannis, Stannis (etc) moment has been covered enough previously by so many others, so I won't bother.
The only thing I am positive about Ygritte is that she is shot by Olly.
Also, I like the new picture, Konradsmith. Loved Roose in that episode.
5165	Ignacio	2014-06-04	Maybe the episode will end of a cliffhanger? It seems like a lot to get in the episode including Stannis.. perhaps that will be shown in the first 15 minutes of episode 10?
5166	Rhaquentis	2014-06-04	Maybe the episode will end of a cliffhanger? It seems like a lot to get in the episode including Stannis.. perhaps that will be shown in the first 15 minutes of episode 10?


It will most likely end with Stannis arriving, and him clearly winning over the wildlings. All the rest will be in the last episode.

Don't know why I'm bothering to take the bait on this one but I will. The fact that some Stanstans have an unrealistic image of the character that isn't really in the text doesn't justify your one dimensional, flawed interpretation of the character. George himself confirmed that Stannis is, "in spite of everything", a "righteous man" for saving the Wall because he realizes that the true battle lies up North, which takes precedent over winning the Throne. This is also supported by Jon and Sam's POVs where they call him "the king who still cared". Stannis has far more autonomy in the books than in the show, and there are plenty of valid reasons to take issue with how they've adapted him for television. He's nuanced, like every most characters in the books, and a lot of that has been sacrificed in favor of making him into a cheap villain that is largely in conflict with his character arc in the novels. Many of us are speculating that his negative aspects have been hyped up in the show in order to make his arrival at the Wall more surprisng and emotional, as it is, indisputably, a turning point for Stannis. But yeah, I get why some Stannis fans can be annoying, but you don't really do yourself any favors by being reactionary and ignoring the text yourself.
5168	alcasinoroyale	2014-06-04	I think the Opening Credits will include:
Kit Harington
Liam Cunningham
Stephen Dillane
Carice van Houten
John Bradley
Rose Leslie
Kristofer Hivju
Hannah Murray
Â 
They would have to have Stannis and his party in the credits because he shows up at the end of the battle, kind of like Tywin did in the Battle of Blackwater and he was still in the credits.Â

Â 
Didn't they learn their lesson from that though? They were purposely cagey in their "previously on," I'd hate to see them ruin the surprise here.
5170	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-04	They may have no choice.
5171	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	^This. I think they have to credit them by contract.
5172	Zell Holland	2014-06-04	I agree. I just think that for some reason the possibility of a Wildling success hasn't even entered some people's radars. Hopefully that will change as they actually watch the episode.
Â 
One particularly ironic YouTube comment really made me laugh:


Â 
Some hilarious anti Stannis comments on youtube recently, also there wasÂ 

Â 
Â 
"the most likable character left on the show is Stannis Baratheon who has a swag rating of 14/100."
Â 
Also in reaction to naked Stannis, hmmm...(no homo, okay little bit)
5173	sati	2014-06-04	I keep telling people everywhere not to watch the opening credits 'because they update the map' and it's a spoiler  I lie...to protect
5174	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-04	Lost had a similar problem, I remember, with a surprise returning character one season. He didn't show up till a number of episodes into the season, but the actor's name had been in the opening credits the whole time because it was required by contract.

Brilliant, lol. To quote the great Dwight Schrute: "We must deceive them, so as to not hurt them. And in that way, we honor them."Â
5176	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	Or just say if they ask, sometimes they credit the wrong people. Which is true, Jerome Flynn was credited in "First of His Name" and didn't appear. In the same episode Varys did appear (albeit as essentially just an extra) and he wasn't credited. So if the Unsullied you're watching with asks, say I guess that's just a mistake or something. Or just distract them while the credits are rolling.

That won't work with the people I watch it with. They see me in a good mood on Sunday and they see Dillane's name in the credits - they'll know 
I could pretend I'm fainting but on Stannis day it's actually possible and I don't want to jinx it ^^

5179	~DarkHorse~	2014-06-04	Don't worry, most people don't pay attention to the actor names in the opening credits. They probably don't even know Stephen Dillane is. HeÂ could be the guy who plays Thorne for all they care.

Â 
I can confidently say the 1. people who watch the show with me 2. people who read my recaps know who Stephen Dillane is and pay attention to opening credits - especially now when they keep hoping Eyrie is finally featured again and tor some reason it's not.
Â 
So If I don't distract them, thanks to HBO/contracts I'm effectively spoiling the reveal for around 50 people and it's the last thing I want to do.

5181	Emperoreddy	2014-06-04	I think most people don't notice the credits as much, but they definitely notice the previously on, which has zero Stannis in it.
Â 
Also if there was any doubt yet, I think we can safely say the boy is going to kill Ygritte. Previously on seems to solidify that.
5182	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	Well, I think Stephen Dillane will be the third name credited. Cunningham I think would be the second. So distract them early on in the credits.
5183	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-04	Also, I like the new picture, Konradsmith. Loved Roose in that episode.
 Wanted to say that, too! 
Always love the Roose, in everything 
I've had so goosebumps when I saw Roose/Ramsay/Reek and their huge army riding to Winterfell, I've had to think the whole time about the coming Battle of Ice and how exciting I am and that Stannis vs. Roose is going to be the absolutely awesomest shit ever! I just need so much a Stannis/Roose showdown/conversation before Stannis smashs the Boltons!
(I always love your Roose pics, I just hope he's shaved the next time we'll time him. I didn't mind the short beard of 4x02, but hopefully after last episode he'll find some time to shave in Winterfell, hopefully he hasn't in season 5 a Davos/Pycelle/Wendel Manderly/Rodrik Cassel style beard )
5184	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-04	I hope we get Stannis charging into the fray like on Blackwater. Seeing Stannis face of against Mace would be an awesome way to introduce him.
5185	Nick_Scryer	2014-06-04	I can easily see Ygritte, Thorne, Pyp, Grenn, Styr, and the Thenn Warg all dying in this episode but doesÂ anyone else think Maester Aemon may die in this episode too? I don't know why, I just think it might happen.

I really liked Roose's facial hair. Thank God for Stephen being on the show otherwise he would be my crush and he is a Bolton! Noo!  Hopefully Stannis hauled ass to the Wall so bad he had no time to shave either.

Â 
Sam's not going to travel with him? I guess it's not really needed, but the whole point of Jon sending him away is to get his king's blood out of Mel's reach. I rather liked that decision of Jon's.

I just hate AND love the show so much for making Iwan Rheon play Ramsay! Since I know and fell in love with "Misfits" it's hard for me to believe Simon and Ramsay are played by the same person. And my sister has a huge crash on Iwan since "Misfits" and since she heard his songs... She once asked me how are the chances that we'll ever hear Ramsay singing in GoT XD

5202	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-04	I hope we'll get after the episode some nice stuff on GoT's youtube channel. "Behind the scenes" and "Inside the episode" videos (I just want to hear D&D -especially Weiss- saying ONE time something positive about Stannis! One time!), and Making-of stuff with Neil Marshall comments. And they had very often the last episodes Emilia Clarke commenting her scenes, we definitely should get Kit this time!
And I love the GoT-yt-videos with GRRM explaining and amplifying things, it'd be super awesome to get George himself calling Stannis a righteous man (despite everything) and saying something about his decision to go North on GoT's channel 
Oh, and there are of course always the videos with single scenes, I hope one's going to be his arrival!
So, I don't know how it was after Baelor/Blackwater/TRoC, but I expect or hope to see:
- The usual "Inside the episode" video with D&D (and please Weiss, not again "He's now full Melisandre" or whatever! -.-)
- Making-of / "Behind the scenes" with Marshall
- Kit getting his own video as Clarke the whole season
- (Hopefully) a GRRM video
- The usual single scenes videos (e.g. Mag riding on a mammoth? "The Wall is yours"? Ygritte's death? Awesome Badass fight scenes? Jon/Mance? Stannis' arrival?...)

5203	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-04	Wow! Awesome work! Looks like we get Ghost on a spree, and methinks I saw Sam with a crossbow!


Â I think more direwolves will show up drawn by the blood, and the scent of Ghost.
5204	Mordos_Kull	2014-06-04	I wouldn't be surprised if D&D have replaced "Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!" with a "...Your Sister" equivalent.
Â 
"Miserable Git! Miserable Git! Miserable Git!"
5205	ToTheWolves	2014-06-04	Â I think more direwolves will show up drawn by the blood, and the scent of Ghost. are those for sure direwolves? or just plain wolves? I always thought that ghost and his pack mates were the last of the direwolves, and the wolf in the promo looked a little to dark to be ghost BUT gives me high hopes because if they can have other cgi wolves,mammoths,giants I  KNOW GHOST BETTER GET HIS MOMENT TO SHINE. D&D have underplayed the dire wolves to much.
5206	Seneti	2014-06-04	I really hope that the reveal is at first just him. No showing of Davos and Melisandre by his side. Not Team Dragonstone saves the day, STANNIS saves the day kind of moment.
Â 
Yeah, yeah I know that without them he wouldn't be there but I'd love for the credit going to him in that scene.


Â 
Personally, I hope for this:
1) Shot of eagle going up in flames
2) sound of another horn (neither NW nor wildling) in the distance
3) shots of Stannis' forces arriving shouting "Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!"
4) overall carnage
Â 


Will Michelle Fairley's name pop up in the credits to spoil Lady Stonehart?


Â 
Don't think so. Not since she's probably only going to be in one episode for a few seconds.
Â

D&D have underplayed the dire wolves to much.


Â 
From what I understand, Ghost and co. are the last direwolves SOUTH of the Wall, but not in total (still some left further north). I do think the wolf in the promo was Ghost, even if he looked a little dark. All cats (and direwolves) are grey in the dark.
5207	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-06-04	are those for sure direwolves? or just plain wolves?

D&D have underplayed the dire wolves to much.


Â 
I read somewhere that the CGI budget for this episode was huge, and that included several direwolves who are drawn to the kennel where Ghost is kept penned. Once Ghost is set free, the direwolves join the fray. Not sure where that was, but it makes sense. In the first episode the mentioned that direwolves only remained above the wall.
5208	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-04	Â From what I understand, Ghost and co. are the last direwolves SOUTH of the Wall, but not in total (still some left further north).

In the book Benjen tells Jon he hears them on his rangings.
5209	MiniMitch	2014-06-04	We might not even see Stannis and Davos, we might just see the riders and heard people shouting "STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS"... or they could even be credited as 'Also starring' in the end credits, as Jason Momoa was (though I've no idea why he was).
Â 
In reagrds to Stoneheart, I think if it is Michelle Fairley, she will either be 'Also starring' or uncredited...
5210	MiniMitch	2014-06-04	Also, in reagrds to Thorne, could he not survive and that would give Jon an adveriser to run against for Lord Commander? I.e, due to Thorne leading the NW aginst the Wildlings, that could make in a very strong candicate for Lord Commander?
Â 
And that would mean either Grenn or Pyp have to die...
Â 
Although, I think it all really comes down to what Pyp, Grenn and Thorne do in the last two books, I don't think it will be much, but Thorne, out of all of them, is the most intersting "I'll return, one way or another"...

Oh man!  I'm Even more excited now to see this all happen.
5212	Arkash	2014-06-04	^ It would be cool to find the source of this but, yeah, c'mon show, direwolf action time ! Ghost's time to shine !Â 
Â 
I think Thorne will bite the dust during the battle. Not a 100% sure, but it seems very likely. Unlike Blackwater, there will be many casualties this episode !
Â 
Man, I can say it : this is the episode I am the most excited about of the whole story so far ! Cant wait !

					
					
							Edited by Arkash, 04 June 2014 - 07:54 PM.
5213	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	It's possible that Thorne could just be wounded or something. But him and Tormund are both pretty effective fighters, so I think one of them will have to do die. Also they emphasised Slynt being a cock-bag in the recap so I think that means he'll take charge after Thorne is out of commission and make Jon treat with Mance/tell him to kill Mance.
5214	Arkash	2014-06-04	From the released promo pics ( http://winteriscomin...-watchers-wall/ ), we know Jon will lead the defense top of the Wall (beginning of the episode I think, after he contemplates the fire) and fight down at Castle Black when Tormund and co show up.Â 
Later on, morning comes and on one of the picture we see Jon and Sam face to face. Jon seems very sad / exhausted (looking forward to Kit's acting !!!). I suppose this is after Ygritte's death and the small victory against their raid (only Tormund will survive it I think) and before Slynt decides to send Jon treat with Mance.
Â 
I think we havent seen anything so far in promos (apart from brief shots of the charge) of what happens after mornful Jon rides alone (or maybe with Ghost) down the tunnel to, I hope meet with Mance.
I'm glad none of this leaked before the episode ! I'm sure we're still in for some surprises !

or at least he needs to be riding ahead of davos and mel. it needs to show him being the leader, not him and davos or him and davos and mel. just stannis.
5218	Konradsmith	2014-06-04	Well I doubt Mel would be in the fray, but I hope we at least see her there. Carice should have four appearances this season, not just three. It's only fair, this would put Dillane and Cunningham at five appearances after all.
5219	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-06-04	about unsullied not being excited about this episode,
of course people are really going to want to know what happens to tyrion, but i think they'll get over it. a lot of people get bored by jon's storyline, but i havent heard many people say they dislike him. they will care enough about his and the watch's fate. i think eventually people will not care that it is on the wall and they will be drawn into the awesomeness that is battles on screen. i really think this one is going to be great. people are going to really dig it, though there might be some grumbling about not getting tyrion. in the end, they will just be like "awesome! huge fight!"
5220	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-04	Well I doubt Mel would be in the fray, but I hope we at least see her there. Carice should have four appearances this season, not just three. It's only fair, this would put Dillane and Cunningham at five appearances after all.

I'm pretty sure we'll see all three in Episode 9, and Dillane and van Houten again in 10.
You say Cunningham, too? Because with appearances in 4x02, x03, x06 and x09, he'd have only four, not five...
Btw, I wonder when we'll see Selyse and Shireen again... They won't be in the middle of the battle, of course, but I'm not sure if they stay as long at Eastwatch as in the books, or if they show up at Castle Black in season 5 maybe very early (Especially after Mel's&Sel's talk about Shireen).
If the show's going to give me a Jon/Davos meeting (something I always wanted to happen in the books), I demand a Sam/Shireen meeting, too! Both smart guys with big hearts, books lovers, he's fat / she has a disfigured face, both half-Florents (and great cousins, IIRC).
With Stannis&family at The Wall it will actually be like a family gathering: If R+L=J is true, then are all, Aemon, Jon, Stannis, Shireen, Selyse and Sam, related to each other 
(I know this was never a topic in the books -and maybe it's good that it wasn't since Mel burned Sam's grandpa- but somehow I find this cute. Jon of course doesn't know this, but nevertheless are Aemon/Stannis/Shireen still some of the few guys left with Targ-blood, and Shireen/Selyse/Sam have all Florent-blood).
5221	ballajam	2014-06-04	I think people are bored of Jon story just because of this season. Last season (as a non book reader at that point) Jon was my favorite because the way he was interacting with the wildlings and ygritte and always knowing there was going to be some type of betrayal. People just kind of forgot about him with all thats been going on in other places. And the short time he has had this season has been a bit dull. Other than the curveball of Bran showing up.Â 
Â 
Â 


or at least he needs to be riding ahead of davos and mel. it needs to show him being the leader, not him and davos or him and davos and mel. just stannis.


Â 
And yes to this! I feel like it has to be a "Stannis Stannis STANNIS" moment with him leading the charge with his army behind him. He is that type of commander. Once this happens everyone is going to be infatuated with Jons story line, especially once the offer that Stannis gives him is presented to the people.Â
5222	alcasinoroyale	2014-06-04	Did anyone else notice in the first Season 4 trailer that at the very end, there were people on horses in the snow killing wildlings? I wonder if that was Stannis's army coming, but probably not.Â
5223	Arkash	2014-06-04	Well I doubt Mel would be in the fray, but I hope we at least see her there. Carice should have four appearances this season, not just three. It's only fair, this would put Dillane and Cunningham at five appearances after all.


Â 
Speaking of Mel, I would love an Aemon / Melisandre scene during episode 10 but most probably they'll keep it for next season. They meet in the book and this would be a great way to start hinting at prophecies about AA and Jon.
5224	alcasinoroyale	2014-06-04	Also if Melisandre is going to use Shireen to sacrifice because the lord of light needs her then the baby switch sub-plot doesn't seem likely.Â
5225	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-04	I think people are bored of Jon story just because of this season. Last season (as a non book reader at that point) Jon was my favorite because the way he was interacting with the wildlings and ygritte and always knowing there was going to be some type of betrayal. People just kind of forgot about him with all thats been going on in other places. And the short time he has had this season has been a bit dull. Other than the curveball of Bran showing up.Â 

That really surprises me if that's true of people. I've thought his material this season has been far superior to what he's gotten in the past. First of all, he's finally gotten to actually SPEAK, and he's gotten to show his great leadership skills, and he's gotten a pretty awesome fight sequence under his belt already.
5226	Arkash	2014-06-04	Aemon has king's blood as well and that is one of the reasons Jon sends him away.
Â 
Melisandre's interactions at the Wall are one of the major points of the show I'm expecting next season !
5227	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-04	about unsullied not being excited about this episode,
of course people are really going to want to know what happens to tyrion, but i think they'll get over it. a lot of people get bored by jon's storyline, but i havent heard many people say they dislike him. they will care enough about his and the watch's fate. i think eventually people will not care that it is on the wall and they will be drawn into the awesomeness that is battles on screen. i really think this one is going to be great. people are going to really dig it, though there might be some grumbling about not getting tyrion. in the end, they will just be like "awesome! huge fight!"
 with that all.
Criticsm I've heard about the Wall and Jon was never about hate, just boredom - And if there's one thing I'm expecting this episode will not be, then boring!
I'm sure they will be surprised how 102 dudes are able to manage to defend their Wall against 100.000+mammoth+giants, when you'd actually expect them to go down very fast. And even more that it all ends with a happy end for these few crows, 'cause of a Helm's Deep/Gandalf-like arrival of Stannis.
3 battles in 1 episode, giants, mammoth, direwolves, explosions, greatest fire, single combats like Tormund/Thorne or Styr/Jon, some Ghost action, Ygritte's death, some other deaths, Mance Rayder, burning eagle, "Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!", and that all with hopefully brillant music and effects will maybe make them to forget Tyrion for at least ~50min.
5228	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-04	Aemon has king's blood as well and that is one of the reasons Jon sends him away.
Â 
Melisandre's interactions at the Wall are one of the major points of the show I'm expecting next season !
I wonder if the lack of Mance junior (if we won't have Dalla and Mance's son) will make Aemon even more attractive as Mel's sacrifice in Jon's view or if the show will rather concentrate on Mance's king's blood, and how that all will effect the storyline of Sam/Gilly/her son/Aemon?
So, maybe they will get sent away as in the books, but without the baby switch?

5229	Arkash	2014-06-04	^ I've been wondering that as well.

Yet I still think Mance's baby will be presented next season. I can totally see a little group of wildlings led by Val (please please please) arriving at CB announcing that the mother has died giving birth and presenting his son to Mance.
5230	King Tommen	2014-06-04	Oh King's blood, you silly silly plot device. If you want to get technical and trace everyone's ancestry in Westeros back far enough (since every family and their dog has had someone declare themselves a king at some point in history), you can have a million candidates with king's blood in them.
Hopefully the show is seriously downplaying that aspect and we won't have to think too hard about it since it's a silly plothole that Martin introduced without thinking it through very well.

Honestly, I'd find it "a bit" unfair if we'll get dozen of Dornish people next year, but many people in the North would get cutted. I'm totally unsure about Val, I'm just pissed since season's beginning that Alys will veeeery likely not appear (since Jon wouldn't marry her to a cannibal... unless they let her marry Tormund or another Wildling?).
I'm still waiting for some cast news about Victarion, Euron, Manderly, fArya, aso... If the show can have Areo Hotah and even three sand snakes, than I'd say we could get Val, too (and Imo, also some Stannis' camp and Roose' camp guys like Alysane Mormont, Barbrey Dustin, some more Umbers, Freys, aso. They'll need to build up these two camps before the Battle of Ice happens, especially to show, well, that "the North remembers".)

Well, this battle was what made me love Jon in the first place, so I imagine this scene might have the same effect on some viewers, as well.

Ah, I think you're right. Downplaying would also confirm us that this aspect really won't matter in the future books.
And they need to show next year Mel being interested in Jon and courting for his favour and friendship and trying to help Jon, which would work better without showing her looking for potential king's blood everywhere.

That was a very beautiful moment for both.
5235	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-04	I have a strong suspicion that Mel is going to burn or attempt to burn Shireen for her king's blood, especially after Martin became visibly nervous during an Elio interview after it was brought up. Melisandre also being adamant about bringing Shireen along because she has some role to play for the Lord of Light is another piece of foreshadowing that supports this possibility. I do think that the Val and Dalla plotlines will likely be cut, which personally I'm all for. There are plenty of other valid reasons to send Gilly away from Castle Black with Sam and Maester Aemon. So while I think king's blood will be very important later, I do think it'll probably be toned down next season to some degree.Â

I agree with you. As much as it would disturb me to have Martin kill off Shireen (she's especially amazing on the show), the drama of Stannis coming back to Caslte Black (assuming he survives the impending battle with the Boltons) and potentially killing Melisandre in retaliation, is incredibly fascinating to think about. My current theory is that she's going to realize Jon is Azor Ahai, which she already suspects, and perhaps sacrifice Shireen to revive him in WoW.
Â 
Regarding the topic at hand, following Cogman's latest interview, I have high hopes that they're going to do right by Stannis on Sunday. They did a great job with him in season 2, despite openly expressing their dislike of the character, and I think that shows they have the potential to get him right again.

I liked all his scenes in season 4 and season 3 scenes were at least visually pleasing, so I'm hopeful
5242	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-04	I like episode 3 of season 4 cause of the pantry line, and the dinner table scene in episode 2, but the burning of "infidels" felt like such a slap in the face to the character. Benioff demonstrates a mild understanding of him as a political pragmatist, but they're both content to portray him as Mel's lapdog primarily, rather than a conflicted desperate soldier going through an intense emotional and psychological conflcit regarding utilitarian morality, power, and duty. I just hope that it hasn't all been for nothing, and that on Sunday we get to see a different side of him that brings Stannis into a more gray light, rather than overwhelmingly black. Even in the books it wasn't really until he came to the Wall that I fell in love with the character, though I was never anywhere near as hostile to him beforehand as the showrunners think we ought to be.

D&D know these three episodes are the summum of the story so far. Hey, it's the end of the 1st act of the entire story, after all. It's so full of amazing events.
And they must have had a great pressure doing them, knowing how much they are expected and how many details are revered as some of the best moments of the books.
Â 
This is Stannis biggest moment (so far), they wont screw it up. We will get our Stannis riding helmet-less at the frontline of his army, in the morning light, stern and stoic as ever. Cause Stannis !

To what interview are you referring?
5246	Thelastactionhero	2014-06-05	To what interview are you referring?


I'll have to scour for it. I remember distinctly that Elio asked George R Martin: "So how's Stannis going to react when Mel sacrifices Shireen?" And he became nervous, saying: "Yes King's blood is important," or something to that effect. Admittedly it has been a while since I looked at it though, so apologies if it's not air tight.
5247	clawson24	2014-06-05	I know some people have their doubts about how the STANNIS! chant would translate to the screen, but I honestly can't think of a better way to end the episode unless they are going to have the time to get into the LC/Winterfell offer stuff all in this episode (which I doubt). Stannis arrives (viewers unclear who is coming at first), routs the Wildlings, it becomes clear it's Stannis -- cut to a wide shot pulling back to reveal the devastation at Castle Black and in front of the Wall as the STANNIS! chants ring out, straight into the credits. Maximum shock/epicness/fist-pump value (especially given how depressing the last episode ended).
5248	Ordos	2014-06-05	I don't know if this has been asked but: Will there be a reference to the Horn of Joramun this episode?
5249	Lady Lurksalot	2014-06-05	I just watched the recap, and I have to agree, it seems as if the two horn blasts at the end are leading into a cold open. I would love this, but am doubtful. I'd love it if the two blasts cold opened into Gilly returning. !

A cold opening would be amazing, but those are reserved for season premieres, I'm afraid. Though I agree with the opening scene being Gilly stumbling towards Castle Black with babe in arms. I wonder if there will be a look of recognition between Gilly and Ygritte, which leads to Ygritte being distracted long enough for Olly the Archer Boy to shoot her? I'm curious to find out who Sam takes out with that crossbow, too. This episode can not come fast enough!!
5250	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-05	Do you know, when they released the last years the soundtrack's tracks list?
I've read "Available July 1, 2014", but is there the possibility that they'll release the song titles before season's end?

I am not looking forward to seeing Ygritte die, I hope they do it justice!Â
5264	Lord Martin	2014-06-05	Can't wait, but I expect the show adaptation to be a bit different. Â Here are my predictions:
Â 
1. Â The Giants make it through the Wall, proving that Jon's assessment of the wildlings was correct and the gate should have been sealed. Â 
Â 
2. Â Either Grenn or Pyp (i'm guessing Grenn) will die a la Donal Noye.
Â 
3. Â Jon will not be sent to treat with Mance, Stannis will save the day just after the breach a la Gandalf in The Two Towers.
Â 
4. Â Jon kills Styr, no burning stair. Â 
Â 
5. Â Thorne vs. Tormund - not sure what happens here, but "the wall is yours Jon Snow" would be cool as he dies. Â 
Â 
6. Â I predict no election, no post battle maneuvering for power... just battle and leave the rest for next season.

I think it would be cool if the episode begins with the immediate aftermath of the trial by combat. Tyrion is thrown into the black cells and all hope seems lost. Then cut to the wall for the battle. That can be a solid 35 minutes of awesome stuff. Then end the episode with people coming down to meet Tyrion, TV viewers are going to think OMG there going to end this episode with Tryions beheading, EPISODE 9 EPISODE 9. It ends up being either Jamie or Varys to set Tyrions escape into motion and along the way kills Tywin and Shae. Fade to black, ejaculation.

5271	Brandon Martell	2014-06-05	I have to say, the build-up to this battle has been pretty bad. They could've at least shown Mance at some point.
And I still think the whole Craster's plot was an unnecessary replacement of the southern wildling attack which they could've had early on rather than have Ygritte's death outweighed by all the other things happening in one episode. Or better, they could've included both without a 2-minute scene every episode.

Â 
I'm kind of inclined to agree here. They're making this out to be a Blackwater 2.0, but have done a really poor job of getting us excited about any of the players, other than Jon. We don't have the buy-in that we did with Blackwater (Tyrion, Sansa, Cersei all being in KL), and even though there's no dearth of Stannis fans on these forums, I think you'd be hardpressed to find many TV viewers that would care.
Â 
I mean. We're getting mother fu**ing mammoths, so there's that. But I've been thinking for a while they shouldn't have tried to make this a giant battle episode. Or as you suggested, give it a full second-half of an episode, but not the whole thing. Then again, I'm also okay with Episode 9 not always being the OMG moment. It's been cool, but they may find it constraining moving forward. People are going to feel let down by this episode for the reason of OMG EPISODE 9, but it probably is helpful overall if where the "shocks" of the show fall isn't so predictable.

But yeah, my roommate (another book reader) has been describing this episode as a "cold shower" after the episode we just got.Â

I'm kind of inclined to agree here. They're making this out to be a Blackwater 2.0, but have done a really poor job of getting us excited about any of the players, other than Jon. We don't have the buy-in that we did with Blackwater (Tyrion, Sansa, Cersei all being in KL), and even though there's no dearth of Stannis fans on these forums, I think you'd be hardpressed to find many TV viewers that would care.
Â 
I mean. We're getting mother fu**ing mammoths, so there's that. But I've been thinking for a while they shouldn't have tried to make this a giant battle episode. Or as you suggested, give it a full second-half of an episode, but not the whole thing. Then again, I'm also okay with Episode 9 not always being the OMG moment. It's been cool, but they may find it constraining moving forward. People are going to feel let down by this episode for the reason of OMG EPISODE 9, but it probably is helpful overall if where the "shocks" of the show fall isn't so predictable.

I actually think it may work to the ep's advantage. People are like 'whatever' and then not only will the Battle be great but the surprise arrival of Stannis - if done right - will get them to go WOAH. Sometimes the low expectations of 'an ep like that! We want to see what happens to Tyrion!' and the episode being awesome may work to people appreciating it even more.
5276	ballajam	2014-06-05	That really surprises me if that's true of people. I've thought his material this season has been far superior to what he's gotten in the past. First of all, he's finally gotten to actually SPEAK, and he's gotten to show his great leadership skills, and he's gotten a pretty awesome fight sequence under his belt already.


Â 
Â 
Like someone said above. The buildup to this huge monumental battle that is one of the best parts of the book has been very very bad for somebody who just watches the show. That is probably where the part of people think Jon is boring this season. There hasnt been the X factor that makes everyone crazy about this fight. Yeah this season as a whole is better but Jon's scenes are not. The Bran sequence was interesting but I was more confused about it than impressed since it was so weird.Â
5277	Onna Lewyys	2014-06-05	Yeah, I agree the build up to the battle itself has been bad. And they really haven't developed the characters at the Wall besides Jon and Sam. That's why I was surprised when I found out this whole episode was going to be set at the Wall. It's not like "Blackwater" where there were about 10 actual main characters involved.
I'm super excited, though.

5278	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-05	I have to say, the build-up to this battle has been pretty bad. They could've at least shown Mance at some point.
And I still think the whole Craster's plot was an unnecessary replacement of the southern wildling attack which they could've had early on rather than have Ygritte's death outweighed by all the other things happening in one episode. Or better, they could've included both without a 2-minute scene every episode.


Â 
Yep they have done an absolutely awful job building up the suspense for this battle. Casually mentioning there are 100,000 wildlings marching on the wall does nothing for common viewer. Showing Mance and a sea of troops would have done a lot. I don't get how him just showing up again after 14-15? episodes is meant to work. My Unsullied friends don't even know who he is or have at least forgotten since he didn't even do much in S3.Â 
Â 
The Battle for Blackwater in season 2 had a really suspenseful build up. We were constantly reminded Stannis was getting closer every episode and that they would have to go to extreme means to defend the city with wildfire. We had POVs on both sides of the battle and both had just reasons to win. I wanted Davos/Stannis to win but I also wanted Tyrion/Hound to win aswell. It was an incredible instrument that had me on the edge of my seat wondering how was going to win.
Â 
This time its just a band of marauding cannibals that will pillage and eat the North that we will have no reason to sympathise with. On the bright side it will make Stannis look like a hero and give him the proper portrayal his finest moment deserves.
Â 
Its just lazy bad writing and inexcusable for a show of this size.Â
5279	sati	2014-06-05	Oh come on. They did what they could. There was plenty of scenes on the Wall establishing the wildling threat. Sure it's not as sexy as drunk Cersei and - for some reason beloved Sansa but I don't think they could do more.
5280	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-05	They certainly did not do what they could and could have done a lot more. If they did the unsullied would be more interested in Jon's storyline. I'm not a writer and I've never worked with TV but I know for a fact me and hundreds of others on this forum could do a lot better than the writers they have on the show.Â 
Â 
Â 
Interesting they have Alliser Thorne in charge of the defences. I wonder where Jon will come in. Maybe he will take care of defending the top of the wall.Â

I bet you you're wrong.
5283	Gladiator of Dorne	2014-06-05	I just hope D&D's bias against Stannis doesn't get in the way of accurately representing this scene. For all we've seen, Melisandre might enter the battle alongside Stannis, and in Episode 10 she may remind Jon Snow and the viewers that it was she who reminded him of his duty to the realm. After the burning of his cousin and showing little to no loyalty to Davos this entire season, I wouldn't be surprised. Perhaps what they said in Season (2?) about him being a terrible king was an assessment of his character at the time, and they believe he turns a corner (as most readers feel) when he decides to go to the Wall. We'll have to wait and see.
Â 
My question is, with so many big bombs potentially being dropped in Episode 10: Tywin's Death, the Children of the Forest reveal, Bloodraven and Lady Stoneheart (who I doubt is going to show up at this point due to the complete lack of mention of the Brotherhood or Thoros), in which order are they going to be presented in Episode 10?
Â 
Furthermore, is Tywin's death going to be at the middle or end of the episode? It's a rather awkward situation considering such a massive scene is most appropriate to the end of an episode and cutting from it to the Children of the Forest scene could be jarring. People are going to be flipping out over Tyrion killing Shae and Tywin, hard to imagine them calming back down to be like, "oh cool, the Children of the Forest, who we barely know anything about."
Â 
Unless Tywin's death closes out the episode, with how the fans love him, it's going to be near impossible to follow.

Â 
Agreed. They made the Thenns cannibals ffs! If that's not establishing a threat, I don't know what is. I'd argue that they completelyÂ dropped the ball with Mance though. I'm fine(ish) with not getting a Val, but we've seen the wildling king for like 3 minutes of screen-time. I just wish there was more buy-in for the Unsullied.Â 
Â 
Oh well, I'll just reread it myself and get hypedÂ

Â 
Â 

Â 
Last five scenes of 10, imo : Arya setting sail. Lord Commander election. Arrival at the Cave. Tywin / Tyrion. LS.
Â 
Â 
Back to 9 : the outcome of the duel between Thorne and Tormund is really interesting.
Â 
There are many ways Thorne could die this episode : defending the gate, from Tormund, from a wound in battle... I just wish he has time to whisper "The Wall is yours Jon Snow" before dying.
Â 
Maybe Tormund cannot finish him and has to fly away (I can see him being the sole survivor of his group) and in the calm that follows, Thorne saying his last line to Jon (who'd be mourning Ygritte at that moment).
Â 
Quickly after that, I can see Janos Slynt fucking around deciding to send Jon beyond the Wall.

haha MELISANDRE! MELISANDRE! ROBERTS BROTHER"S WITTTTTCH!!!!!

I think the order will be:
Â 
1) The wall stuff
2) Random kings landing scene to give CD more screen time. "I will burn this house down before i let that happen" part in trailer.
2) Dany and her dragons getting chained
3) Arya leaving Westeros
3) Bran stuff, bloodraven revealÂ 
4) Tywin and Shae death, tyrion escape
5) Cut to black
6) No wait fade back inâ<U+0080>¦. why is brienne in a caveâ<U+0080>¦ oh its the brotherhoodâ<U+0080>¦ wait whats that hooded figure. "She don't speak, but she remembers." Hood down. Cut to credits.Â 
7) No wait why aren't the credits starting?
8) Fade to white text on black screen.Â 
9) (Winds of) Winter is coming
8) 31/07/14
9) Credits play.Â 
Â 
Then the unsullied will freak, the book readers will have a thousand orgasms, and the show will be called the greatest of all timz.Â

I think we're definitely going to get into some dire straights in this episode, and that Stannis' arrival will be pretty damn epic after the nighttime fighting. Â Basically, this will be some GOOD news for once in the show, and I think a lot of people will really enjoy that after what happened in the last episode.

Bullshit. How many shows have you and your friends created. Yeah, that's right, none. It's one thing to critique a show and suggest ways that you would have done it, but to openly unequivocally dismiss D&D is, quite frankly, an insukt to both D&D, and GRRM himself. They're human, and admit as much themselves, but they've also created HBO's most succesful series ever, and the series is critically acclaimed. ASoIaF does not lead itself well to being adapted. D&D have worked their socks of to create this show, and have the blessing of GRRM. HBO doesn't give two hoots about book readers. Just be grateful that D&D do, because they have been incredibly faithful to th e source material. Just looo at other book series adaptations.
Â 
Â 
When you create a show as succesful as D&D have I will listen, but until then STFU.
5290	SerMixalot	2014-06-05	mammoths AWESOME

Â 
That's based on that article that I made that spec.
Â 
All the people I've talked about the upcoming battle at the Wall seemed at least interested if not really enthusiasts, so I think it's gonna be well received.
Â 
I know that personally it is THE episode I've been awaiting a long time !
5296	King Tommen	2014-06-05	Does it really matter what the build-up of the episode is if the episode is awesome? The Rains of Castamere is one of the highest rated episodes of the show by audience voting and the events there were barely built up at all.
Â 
And really, if you go back to Blackwater, outside of Tyrion reminding everyone a few times about Stannis coming in the episodes prior (the same way Jon is now) where exactly was the awesome build-up with that episode?
Â 
It's a massive battle with a huge SFX budget, giants, mammoths, direwolves, cannibals, wargs, one on one faceoffs, characters we actually are aware of and can sympathize with on both sides, monumental deaths and a surprise save at the last moment. Â I'm sure the audience is going to absolutely HATE all that stuff.
Â 
Blackwater had Tyrion, Cersei, Joffrey, Pod, Bronn, the Hound, Sansa, Lancel, Shae, Stannis and Davos (for about 2 minutes).
Â 
This episode will have Jon, Sam, Gilly, Grenn, Pyp, Edd, Olly, Ghost, Aemon, Thorne, Slynt, Stannis, Davos, Melisandre, Mance, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr, Rattleshirt, a Thenn warg and Mance's differentiated army which includes regular Wildlings, Thenns, Giants and Mammoths as opposed to Stannis forces in Blackwater which consisted of Stannis and a bunch of nameless random redshirts.
Â 
I think whatever lowered expectations that exist out there are going to elevate the reaction tenfold of just how awesome this is going to be.
5297	SerMixalot	2014-06-05	Is that wolf a shadowcat maybe? it seems to have a prominent main like a lion
5298	NightStark	2014-06-05	So, are your friends excited for this episode (if they know that it is only on the Wall)?


Â 
From what I've seen non readers are excited for it but they're not really sure how it will go down. The Wall is pretty formidable but Mance has 100,000 men so they're not really sure which way it will go. They know the NW is really short of men but Thorne's confidence that they can hold their ground seems to have convinced them that the odds aren't entirely against the Watch. I think the mammoths and the giant smashing the gate will make them worried for Jon etc.

5305	Konradsmith	2014-06-05	If they kill him off, it's nice that they gave him this moment to shine before the end. Owen Teale brought a helluva lot more to the role than he needed to. I hope his speech in totality is better than his awesome, "you die...like fliiiiiesss".
Â

Â 
I think that the "Love is the death of duty" line will be followed up by "Kill the boy, Jon Snow, and let the man be born." This, in my opinion, can go down as one of the best lines of the series, up there with "If you think this has a happy ending..."

Â 
Same. Â I think they've done a great job rounding out his character into something other than "I HATE JON SNOW"...which they seem to have saved for Slynt, but that's fine with me.
Â 
I would love some sort of dying moment between Thorne and Jon where he bequeaths the defense of the Wall to him, because I think it would definitely add an element of legitimacy that I always felt lacking in the novels...but I won't be counting on it.
5309	Ruin	2014-06-05	Will we get a possible turn for Thorne during/after the battle?Â  A couple of my friends asked me after watching the trailer, and at first I wanted to say no.Â  I started to think it over, and it could happen.Â  It should be interesting to see what Lord Slynt does during the attack...guard Aemon, lol.

from what we've seen, it is awesome. may end up being one of the best battle speeches i've seen in a while or on the show. my favorite "battle" speech is theon's from s2 e10. it didnt end too well for him, but it was a fantastic speech.

Yeh that wouldn't be too bad. Probably better, it'll be such an emotional scene for Jon, this will help him get over it quickly because he has more time in the books but no time in this episode

5319	sj4iy	2014-06-06	Really? I feel like "I HATE JON SNOW" has been the driving force behind every one of his scenes this season.He doesn't like him, that's for sure...but he's not ridiculing him the way that Slynt does. You can see that he's actually thinking about the things that Jon says, even if he doesn't want to agree with it. Look at how he acts during Jon's trial...Slynt is the one mouthing off and making stupid comments, Thorne is actually listening. Look at how he calls on Jon in the hall after the Wildlings attack saying "Lord Snow, you're a champion of the common people..." and then he agrees with Jon's assessment of the situation about having to stay at Castle Black. Yes, we know that Thorne doesn't want Jon to come back from the mission at Craster's Keep...but even then, it's something Jon wants to do and Thorne agrees to it.Does Thorne like Jon? Hell, no. But does he recognize that Jon is a capable fighter and leader of men? Reluctantly, yes. To me, all of this was much more nuanced than it ever was in the books, and Thorne's character is just so much more fleshed out than in the story. I have really enjoyed it and like what they've done there.
5320	Konradsmith	2014-06-06	^This. He's still a mean-spirited dick, but he's a layered, much more interesting mean-spirited dick. And played to perfection by the excellent Owen Teale.

Look at how he calls on Jon in the hall after the Wildlings attack saying "Lord Snow, you're a champion of the common people..." and then he agrees with Jon's assessment of the situation about having to stay at Castle Black. Yes, we know that Thorne doesn't want Jon to come back from the mission at Craster's Keep...but even then, it's something Jon wants to do and Thorne agrees to it.
Does Thorne like Jon? Hell, no. But does he recognize that Jon is a capable fighter and leader of men? Reluctantly, yes. To me, all of this was much more nuanced than it ever was in the books, and Thorne's character is just so much more fleshed out than in the story. I have really enjoyed it and like what they've done there.


Â 
Holy cow, you are the most optimistic person I think I've ever encountered.
Â 
I'm reminded of a quote from The West Wing: "You get my support the same way I get yours: when I agree with what you're saying or when I don't care about what you're saying." Thorne isn't going to betray his own cause on matters which he and Jon are aligned, but other than the occasional show of mild begrudging respect I think thatÂ "I HATE JON SNOW" pretty much sums up every word we've heard from his smarmy mouth.
5322	clawson24	2014-06-06	Do people like or dislike the snippet of Thorne's speech? I think it sounds pretty awesome myself but are you gentlemen making fun of it?


Â 
I actually genuinely like what we've seen and heard of it so far. It's interesting and more rewarding to have a character like him who is such an epic dick also be a legit bad-ass who knows his stuff.
5323	Konradsmith	2014-06-06	^We also got a nice shot of him slashing a wildling's torso in the promo, so I'm sure he'll win some respect from the fans this episode. Which is fitting if it is indeed his last appearance.
5324	sati	2014-06-06	^This. He's still a mean-spirited dick, but he's a layered, much more interesting mean-spirited dick. And played to perfection by the excellent Owen Teale.


Â 
That actor is so good. I still remember that scene where Jon and Sam were being cute and carefree and he came in to tell them about the cold and how people eat each other in s1.
5325	jentario	2014-06-06	This episode could potentially be the best in the entire show... Yay!
5326	LordStoneheart	2014-06-06	I forgot to make the bets that the cheer will be "Snow" instead of "Stannis."
5327	Guard of the Rainking	2014-06-06	If they do the Stannis arrival scene justice do you think that the Unsullied viewers opinions will change about Stannis? Many of the unsullied reviewers I watch either have an open mind about him or think that he's boring. But at this point in the story whose left for the Unsullied to root for in Westeros? Sansa is in camp Littlefinger, Tyrion's sentenced to death and Arya doesn't have the power to avenge her family. Also Daenerys has just stated that she's going to stay in Meereen, and we're just about to witness her power start to crumble. IIRC people started to root for Daenerys heavily after the Dracarys scene and after the Red Wedding. Stannis' Arrival is IMO far more epic and "important" than the Dracarys scene. Can't wait for the reactions.

Â 
I think so. People like badasses and they do seem not to really hate those who do the right thing and rescue other characters in the show. And speaking of Unsullied I know, they are kind of on the fence with Stannis - they like his expressions(always) and character (sometimes)Â but his story bores him. Hopefully since he is gonna get involved in all that Bolton shitstorm business they will warm up to him.
5329	stannisismyking	2014-06-06	Â 
I thought so! Â I love the page, the first batch from S2E10 is so good, that is probably my favorite Stannis scene in the show. Â He goes through so many emotions in so little time, and totally effortlessly. Â SD is going to kill it in the next 2 episodes! Â Â 


Â 
As much as I'm looking forward to seeing the charge (fingers crossed), episode 10 is also going to be a doozy for Stannis I feel, with him settling in at the Wall and (hopefully) starting to throw his weight and some shade around.Â  The episode description mentions how the "situation has changed" at the Wall after an "unexpected arrival".
Â 
Entitled, snarky Stannis is my favourite Stannis and he has that in spades during his time at the Wall
5330	stannisismyking	2014-06-06	^We also got a nice shot of him slashing a wildling's torso in the promo, so I'm sure he'll win some respect from the fans this episode. Which is fitting if it is indeed his last appearance.


Definitely.
Â 
One of my favourite moments was earlier this season when Jon came back and was being grilled by Slynt, Thorne and AN Other. Jon mentioned about Giants and Slynt was so dismissive and looking to Thorne to sneer along with him, but his expression changed when he saw that Thorne was taking it seriously.Â  So many of my favourite moments on this show are small facial expression changes IS2G...
Â 
Thorne will still be side-eyeing Jon Snow but he sees the bigger picture.
5331	Beric175	2014-06-06	Loks like Pyp's gonna bite the dust. I mean all of Jon Snow's friends at the Wall are side characters anyway, even in the books. It's not like in LOTR where Frodo and his friends are the main focus and they have been known to kill characters prematurely on the show before....it raises the stakes too, which is good.
5332	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-06-06	I have a suspicion they'll make Jon volunteer to assassinate Mance after Thorne dies, as the only way to save the wall, to make Jon more heroic in his self sacrifice.
5333	Koi No Yokan	2014-06-06	Although I don't expect the baby sub-plot to make the cut, I'm still holding out on hope that Dalla will be there and make mention of Val.
5334	King Tommen	2014-06-06	If either Dalla or Val had been cast, even in a brief scene, it would have been sussed out by now. We knew about characters like the Braavosi ship captain Arya will meet, Ralf Kenning at Moat Cailin and even the Knight at the gate of the Vale this season. Pretty sure if someone was cast as either woman, it would be known.Â

That might very well be the case.  I remember reading an interview with Kit earlier this year where he said that Jon would do something quite cold near the end of this season.  I had thought that he might have meant Jon turning down Winterfell even quicker in the show, but this makes more sense.

But how would that help...there is still so many wildlings left and their purpose is running southÂ from WW
5337	The Drunkard	2014-06-06	He could surmise that Mance is the only one holding together the wildling cause, and by killing him at a parley he could, potentially, scatter the wildlings and only lose one life to do it.
Â 
If they're really desperate by the end of the fight, it's worth a shot.

Don't the Unsullied fanbase's opinions form during the off-season? If so than many of the Unsullied viewers favorite characters might have a drop in popularity. Dany sending Jorah away, staying in Meereen and chaining the dragons, Tyrion killing Shae and Arya leaving the Hound to die might make many people dislike those characters.
5339	Northbound2.0	2014-06-06	Does it really matter what the build-up of the episode is if the episode is awesome? The Rains of Castamere is one of the highest rated episodes of the show by audience voting and the events there were barely built up at all.
Â 
And really, if you go back to Blackwater, outside of Tyrion reminding everyone a few times about Stannis coming in the episodes prior (the same way Jon is now) where exactly was the awesome build-up with that episode?
Â 
It's a massive battle with a huge SFX budget, giants, mammoths, direwolves, cannibals, wargs, one on one faceoffs, characters we actually are aware of and can sympathize with on both sides, monumental deaths and a surprise save at the last moment. Â I'm sure the audience is going to absolutely HATE all that stuff.
Â 
Blackwater had Tyrion, Cersei, Joffrey, Pod, Bronn, the Hound, Sansa, Lancel, Shae, Stannis and Davos (for about 2 minutes).
Â 
This episode will have Jon, Sam, Gilly, Grenn, Pyp, Edd, Olly, Ghost, Aemon, Thorne, Slynt, Stannis, Davos, Melisandre, Mance, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr, Rattleshirt, a Thenn warg and Mance's differentiated army which includes regular Wildlings, Thenns, Giants and Mammoths as opposed to Stannis forces in Blackwater which consisted of Stannis and a bunch of nameless random redshirts.
Â 
I think whatever lowered expectations that exist out there are going to elevate the reaction tenfold of just how awesome this is going to be.Tommen, why would you come in here and post something logical? Here I was having a blast, listening to how the build up to this episode is "awful" or how D&D are terrible writers.... how awful of you to ruin it! Thanks pal!
For those of us who have read the books,  before the this the series was turned in to a show and are now constantly complaining on a weekly basis; I would ask you to pause for a moment. We should actually be thankful to D&D, for staying as close to the books as they have; because HBO could give a damn about being true to Martin's work. If you don't want to take my word on the matter, just go look at the horrible job HBO and the creators of True Blood have done. They completely destroyed that series.
Episode 9 is going to be a blast. It's the beginning of a Jon/Stannis bromance! Sit back and enjoy!

Just basing this on my comment section under recaps there is pretty much a universal opinion of 'Dany sucks and Emilia is terrible' this season

Â 
I cant wait to see more of him during the battle ! And I hope we get an Aemon / Slynt / Thorne scene full of tensions somewhere down the line !

Â 
I like it because they've taken a character that they had clearly made look like an asshole and gave him a moment where you can actually respect him. It's one of those relatively nuanced things people tend to complain the show lacks, so I'm glad they've made Thorne more interesting than he is in the books.Â
5346	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-06	Owen Teale has the absolute perfect voice for a battle speech and I find "...and when the sun rises I promise you CASTLE BLACK WILL STAND!" sounds pretty awesome, confident and badass *looking really forward to Thorne vs. Tormund*
And I'm excited about Jon's face once he realizes there's somebody who really comes to help them. I loved it that in the books he was first "Huh, who's this?! Robb? Tommen?..." *sees large Baratheon banners* "Robert?!" But then the knights give him the right answer 
Even if or when Unsullied won't be surprised (some will, some won't, I guess), the NW has still the biggest surprise of all, even after 44 letters they didn't really expect someone to come and then this someone arrives exactely in THIS moment and it is somebody totally unexpected for all! Hopefully we get the expressions/reactions of some crows, especially of course Jon. If there's no woman giving birth or another important reason for him to go in Mance's tent, I hope for a nice end scene with Stannis' arrival and surprised Jon.
The way it happens in the books worked for the books, but on the show I want some extreme epic end shot of Jon/Stannis (similar to Cersei/Tywin in "Blackwater"... only that Stannis and Jon are two character I love).
ETA: ^ Plus epic music. Cersei/Tommen/Tywin at the end had "I Will Keep You Safe" (one of my favourite tracks) and then during the credits "The Rains of Castamere" by The National (epic as well), hopefully they/Ramin do/does something as great as these this time again.

Serious, grumpy, bad temperedâ<U+0080>¦"), but if they consider them now as boring / useless / whiny, then they'll be surprised to see them together and what awesome shit ADWD-Jon and ADWD-Stannis manage to do!

I've began 10 minutes ago to laugh and couldn't stop till now 
*  for these pics/gifs* You really made my day! Â 
Â 
Â 


The Jon/Stannis bromance is one of the best things in ADWD.
I really hope they keep Stannis's nod of approval after Jon beheads Slynt.


Â 
Couldn't agree more!
5358	Chebyshov	2014-06-06	Ach, they don't know what they are talking about, that are Unsullied, have they ever seen Jon/Stannis? No!
Jon and Stannis may be Westeros' grumpiest / moodiest / sullenest guys (Even Stephen Dillane said once in an interview: "Jon Snow is pretty moody. Is moody the right word? Serious, grumpy, bad temperedâ<U+0080>¦"), but if they consider them now as boring / useless / whiny, then they'll be surprised to see them together and what awesome shit ADWD-Jon and ADWD-Stannis manage to do!


Â 
I agree their moments together are going to be great (gdi, you guys are turning me into a Stannis fan!), but because the Unsullied really have no buy-in to Stannis now, even if that may change in the near future, I'm worried they'll think of this episode as a big "who cares?" Then again, both book and show Stannis are dour and inscrutable, so they're not all that different at this point in the story.Â I was thrilled when Book!Stannis saved the day, so mayhaps the show will produce the same effect. Plus, given the mammoths, giants, and high death-count, you'd have to hope this can entertain them for 50 minutes.

*takes a bow*
Â 
It's really gonna be a laugh riot in the show.
Â 
Â 
Â 
  I really hope so too, it's such a fantastic scene. I hope they'll show a lot of that storyline, I'll take that over Dorne, Dany and pretty much everything except for King's Landing's Cersei arc


Â 
Yes! The things/arcs I'm looking the most forward in season 5 are 1.) Stannis/Jon, 2.) Davos/Manderly 3.) Roose/Ramsay/Reek (their three actors  ) and mad Cersei would be the fourth thing/arc (Lena ). Oh, and I hope we see more of Asha/Yara next season and -although I'm no big Dorne fan- that we'll see Ellaria again (  she's sooo hooot and beautiful!)
Â 
Couldn't care less about Dany... and if we don't get crazy Ironborn with their horn coming to her on the show, then even lesser than less... Vic trying to get/tame/ride a dragon, failing and making things even worse in Meereen is the only thing I would like to see there and be interested in.

Â 
I'm to 99,99% sure, they won't cut this!
Â 
1.) The show loves speeches, monologues, one-on-one-dialogues and mean cliffhangers. Davos in WH gives them that all, especially if they "kill" him in one episode (looking forward to the shitstorm and fanrage about Manderly ) and then show the living Davos one or two episodes later and Manderly's reveal about his true plans and his mummer's speech (Manderly is going to be a new fan-favourite-badass).
Â 
2.) I think GRRM has a really soft spot for Manderly and everyone I know considers Davos's ADWD chapters as some of the best in ADWD (or even the whole series), D&D should be aware of that.
Â 
3.) Even if we don't really know what will happen to Manderly in TWOW, I expect him to play a huge and VERY important role in the Battle of Ice and his schemings with the Boltons and in Winterfell can get wonderfully adapted, Imo, the same with the Merman's Court.
Â 
4.) White Harbor would made a cool new location for the intro!
Â 
5.) Davos/Manderly is the best example to show the still lasting love and power for/of the Starks; the Northmen's thirst for vengeance, that they haven't forgotten what Freys and Boltons did. I think, "The North remembers, Lord Davos..." is one of the most famous, hyped and epic moments and lines in ADWD ASOIAF.
This whole season we haven't heard a word from any Northmen, only how Roose and Ramsay had more and more success and it almost seems that the former Stark vassals are now simply sworn to the Boltons, simply "okay" with it. And Davos III and Davos IV will be mindblowing and is perfect stuff for a TV show, IMO, especially first Manderly's behaviour to his Frey guests and to Davos and then this great "WOOAAH" moment when we see Manderly's true intentions/opinions/actions.
Â 
If that isn't great material for a show, then I don't know...

Â 
- Wyman Manderly (after all, they didnt introduce the Mermaid sigil at the RW for nothing).
- Justin Massey (as the face and voice of the Queens Men).
- A new Karstark Lord.
- Lady Dustin.
- At least one new member of the Watch after all the loss of the upcoming battle.
- Val (more of a personal wish than absolute necessity but I think she can add some nice dynamics at the Wall).
- Jeyne Pool equivalent.
- One Yara crewmember (Tristifer please !)
Â 
I think that would suffice. 8 new characters that would really help the Northern story next year.

And we visited Moat Cailin only once as well. The show could easily have some brief shots of a coastal city and interior shots for the castle of White Harbor.

Â 
1.) Bryan Cogman said Stannis didn't get fully what he wanted, we don't know how much gold they gave him, maybe just enough to pay Salla and buy some sellswords. And even if Stannis is now super-rich, it could rather mean that we won't get Tycho negotiating with Jon, because Stannis will give him gold to get his people through the Winter and repairing and fixing the castles faster/more than in the books, or something like that (that's at least what I thought  ).

  They also had a room for the IBoB for one episode this season, it shouldn't been so difficult to get the same for Manderly's New Castle in WH.

Â 
Bryan Cogman said that Stannis has only been given a "bridging loan" so he will probably just have enough to pay for his troops for a little while, but the Iron Bank wouldn't throw their lot in with him completely until Cersei stiffs them, so he'll probably still have to scrabble around for support.
Â 
I'm pretty sure the WH storyline will appear in some form. Â A Manderly was very visible at the RW so I think the plan was always to include them (unless that was just throwing a bone to book fans).
Â 
What does Davos do if not go off his on his Big Adventure? Â I think it's a great idea that he gets to accompany Stannis to the Wall on the show as he's so instrumental in getting him there in the first place, but I can't see him going on the march with Stannis afterwards; he is much more use to Stannis for his "people skills" than as a battle commander at his side (unless he brings him to meet with the Mountain Clans ha ha). Â I think he'll be at the Wall for a while at the start of S5 then we will see Stannis instructing him to go treat with Manderly. Â 
Â 
They just need to build one set (or rebuild an existing set) and do some CGI trickery. THEY CAN BUILD IT. THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY ;p

5376	Seneti	2014-06-06	If they do the Stannis arrival scene justice do you think that the Unsullied viewers opinions will change about Stannis? Many of the unsullied reviewers I watch either have an open mind about him or think that he's boring. But at this point in the story whose left for the Unsullied to root for in Westeros? Sansa is in camp Littlefinger, Tyrion's sentenced to death and Arya doesn't have the power to avenge her family. Also Daenerys has just stated that she's going to stay in Meereen, and we're just about to witness her power start to crumble. IIRC people started to root for Daenerys heavily after the Dracarys scene and after the Red Wedding. Stannis' Arrival is IMO far more epic and "important" than the Dracarys scene. Can't wait for the reactions.




Don't the Unsullied fanbase's opinions form during the off-season? If so than many of the Unsullied viewers favorite characters might have a drop in popularity. Dany sending Jorah away, staying in Meereen and chaining the dragons, Tyrion killing Shae and Arya leaving the Hound to die might make many people dislike those characters.


Â 
Let's break this down by character. Here's what I think is going to happen:
- Stannis: will get a boost in popularity for helping the NW and hopefully his ADWD snark will boost him even more
- Sansa: has finally become interesting for viewers, now that she's taken her destiny into her own hands and stopped being the damsel in distress at last
- Tyrion: after being betrayed by Shae during the trial, I doubt him killing her will make viewers like him any less. If anything at all, they will love him for kiling Tywin. Now, ADWD, where he becomes a drunk asshole wallowing in self-pity - that's where popularity will diminish
- Arya: Will always remain awesome in the eyes of the viewers, because she's badass tomboy Stark who snarks her way through a war zone and has a hitlist that includes all the characters we hate. Leaving the hound to die my put a slight dent into her popularity, but not much.
- Dany: Has already lost some points by staying in Meereen and will probably continue losing popularity points until she gets to the fighting pit.
Â 


If either Dalla or Val had been cast, even in a brief scene, it would have been sussed out by now. We knew about characters like the Braavosi ship captain Arya will meet, Ralf Kenning at Moat Cailin and even the Knight at the gate of the Vale this season. Pretty sure if someone was cast as either woman, it would be known.Â 


Â 
I agree and I think it's entirely possible that we areÂ only going to be introduced to Val (and possibly Dalla) next season. Here's what I think could happen:
- epic battle between NW and Wildlings, with Wildlings seeming to gain the upper hand.
- Jon is either sent or volunteers to negotiate a truce with Mance
- they meet before Mance's tent, but just as they are about to negotiate, Stannis & co. come in and save the day for the NW
- next season, we get the NW letting the Wildlings through the gate - this is where we get Val with the baby, explaining that the child belonged to Mance.

Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â That's been my spec all along ! Val brings really interesting dynamics to the Wall, and having Jon's somehow inner conflict between the Fire that is Mel and the Ice that is Val is really a nice touch.Â

- Arya: Will always remain awesome in the eyes of the viewers, because she's badass tomboy Stark who snarks her way through a war zone and has a hitlist that includes all the characters we hate. Leaving the hound to die my put a slight dent into her popularity, but not much.
- Dany: Has already lost some points by staying in Meereen and will probably continue losing popularity points until she gets to the fighting pit.
Â 


Â 
I agree with all! (Except that Arya's list in the show includes Beric and Thoros and I don't hate Beric and Thoros )
5380	LordStoneheart	2014-06-06	For those of us who have read the books, before the this the series was turned in to a show and are now constantly complaining on a weekly basis; I would ask you to pause for a moment. We should actually be thankful to D&D, for staying as close to the books as they have; because HBO could give a damn about being true to Martin's work. If you don't want to take my word on the matter, just go look at the horrible job HBO and the creators of True Blood have done. They completely destroyed that series.
Â 


Â 
I don't exactly agree with this. I give D&D credit where they deserve it, sometimes their writing can be pretty great, or rather their adaptation choice. Most of this largely isn't "their" writing. But from what I've read of the development in the show, GRRM was a hard sell and D&D had to kind of grovel with how accurate they were going to be to adapt it in the first place. S1 was rather amazing, I think. But the changes don't seem to be HBO at all, except for more nudity. When D&D change things, its probably because they either want their own type of credit (Talisa comes to mind) or their letting their own views of the material affect their execution of it (Stannis, Theon, Cersei, Tyrion). I don't doubt that HBO could have different writers ruin it, but it's not HBO that truly brought us this adaption. It's the showrunners who brought it to HBO and from them to us. D&D can be great but they're not above criticism because other writers could make it worse.Â

Â 
I'm not sure he was insinuating they're above criticism (Which is pretty obvious), but rather that they've actually managed to stay quite faithful to the books. Most every change has been minor to the overall plot and we get to the same place anyways. Some of the changes have been improvements, some worse. Certainly more changes that have been worse since I think GRRM is obviously a better writer, but overall it hasn't been so different and I think he means we should be thankful that nothing is really significantly different at least as far as major plots go.Â
5383	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-06	Â 
Let's break this down by character. Here's what I think is going to happen:
- Stannis: will get a boost in popularity for helping the NW and hopefully his ADWD snark will boost him even more
- Sansa: has finally become interesting for viewers, now that she's taken her destiny into her own hands and stopped being the damsel in distress at last
- Tyrion: after being betrayed by Shae during the trial, I doubt him killing her will make viewers like him any less. If anything at all, they will love him for kiling Tywin. Now, ADWD, where he becomes a drunk asshole wallowing in self-pity - that's where popularity will diminish
- Arya: Will always remain awesome in the eyes of the viewers, because she's badass tomboy Stark who snarks her way through a war zone and has a hitlist that includes all the characters we hate. Leaving the hound to die my put a slight dent into her popularity, but not much.
- Dany: Has already lost some points by staying in Meereen and will probably continue losing popularity points until she gets to the fighting pit.

What do you think will be their opinion about the BwB and especially Thoros after the finale? (And about LS?)

Â 
PEERFEECT Â  I love this "So what?!" / "What of it?!" reaction to Jon's fighting skills XDD He's so unimpressed XD


I need to stop - my extensive fangirling over Dillane is wrecking lives - several people watched the Hours because of my endless tweets/posts/tumblr posts about him in it and he basically ruins all men for women in this. Nothing can ever top that.
Â 
But I do have high hopes for that furry cloak

5386	Theon {HUNGRY WOLF} Stark	2014-06-06	I'm just worried because:
Â 
1: The Iron Bank's support might not mean getting WH is vital.
2: WH is a new location, that will add cost. It is really only visited once, and in a season that will include Dorne & several locations in Essos, I'm honestly scared they will cut it.
1.Davos/Mandereley meeting isnt only about money/soldiers of WH. Sure Stannis needs money and soldiers for his northern campaign.... That meeting is more about showing Mandereley's loyalty towards Starks who seem to, paraphrasing Jaime from AFFC "moving,things from their graves". It shows how enduring loyalty is earned in otherwise fickle westerosi Noblety. It also shows that Northmen can play the game of thrones and get down & dirty if need be. And of course prelude to Frey Pies.
5387	LordStoneheart	2014-06-06	Just saw the Jannis gifs... pure awesomeness, and I'm not very keen on Stannis.Â
5388	Theon {HUNGRY WOLF} Stark	2014-06-06	What do you think will be their opinion about the BwB and especially Thoros after the finale? (And about LS?)
If they show LS hanging Frey Portaits on Trees in ep10 , Unsullied will loveThoros for bringing LS back. If not in this season.then.less excited but not outright hate.

I know D&D kept talking about how the show's most expensive scene is in E10 (https://uk.tv.yahoo....-123500864.html), which I'm guessing is Dany chaining the dragons, but I'd have to imagine in total, E09 is costlier?

Damn they spent like half the budget on these two eps, I'm guessing.
5394	Arkash	2014-06-06	I think the Watchers on the Wall is more expensive than the Children. Consider all we're gonna get this episode that requires a hell of a budget : giants, fires, mammoth(s), blood, Wall, extras, horses and other animals, stunts, weaponry and all the team behind ! No wonder this will be "as big as TV gets" !

Has the dragon chaining been hinted at? Â We've only seen one scene with the dragons causing...er..mischief so far? Â That means we have to have the child's bones in the next Meereen scene.

And next epsiode is stuff for the legends.
Heroes will rise.
5407	Colonel Green	2014-06-06	I'm not clear what Gilly's role in all this is going to be in all this.Â  The Sam/Gilly story this season has been said to be him mistakenly pushing her away and then making up for it, which seems to imply he's going to try and rescue her or something, but I'm not sure how that logically fits into the narrative.Â  Among other things, taking her back to Castle Black at this point would just be putting her in even more danger.
5408	sati	2014-06-06	" Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a very intense episode, more intense than Blackwater." http://winteriscomin...filming-battle/
5409	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-06	Theory:
Sam will run around with this crossbow (as we have seen in the preview) to kill a giant (because he's about to harm Gilly and they want to show super-brave Sam), but he'll fail, everything's lost, but then comes the Mannis and saves Sam (and Gilly) from the giant, and Sam will say his "A King who still cares"-line out loudÂ
5410	King Tommen	2014-06-06	Â 
Â 
Weiss:Â With Blackwater when we got the episode in, so much of it was visual effects dependent we were kind of unsure â<U+0080><U+0094> the performances were fantastic and the action was great, but we werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely sure what we had until the pieces were put together. But with this, even Neilâ<U+0080><U+0099>s first directorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cut that we saw without a single frame of visual effects finished, just something about it really grabbed us by the neck thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s very rare even with the great directors weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re fortunate to work with.Benioff:Â In terms of the sets, our new production designer Deborah Riley did this magnificent top-of-The Wall set, far bigger than what we had before, so you can do walk-and-talks, you can have massive action sequences. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s completely surrounded by green screen, which is apparently the biggest green screen in Europe.Weiss:Â Neil and Deb both spent a lot of time watching the Kubrick film Paths of Glory to get a sense of how to apply trench warfare set-building to an icy top-of-The Wall environment. She did a really fantastic job. It has to be the biggest Styrofoam piece in existence.
Benioff:Â Giants. Giants are tricky. Having Neil Marshall directing it, you have confidence; like going to a really good doctor whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to make everything better. Neil is very soft spoken, but heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the kind of guy when heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s on the set everyone is calm because he knows exactly what heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s doing. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a very intense episode, more intense than Blackwater. Weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re seeing it now, even before visual effects have gone in, and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s still magnificent.Â

5412	Jdawg Laurence	2014-06-06	It's supposed to be all the battle at the wall as many have said. Â GRRM was told by the directors this episode will be the largest battle the show has seen.

Â 
Oh, I'm sure that's the case. I think they have interviews from a few months ago in the can with him for every episode and EW just releases them pre and post episode when warranted. This is probably because they're too busy to do anything as the season airs media-wise on account them being in the thick of writing, pre-production, casting, location scouting etc for Season 5.

I imagine very soon after the episode airs. That seems to be the MO for the other director interviews that EW release for previous episodes.

BTW, how did EW strike gold with all the access to essentially everyone involved with the show? D&D especially seem to only exclusively do interviews with Hibbard and no one else.
5419	Konradsmith	2014-06-06	^He's been involved with the show since the pilot casting IIRC. He's their proxy or inside man in the press. Maybe one of them went to school with him.

5420	Khal-a-bunga	2014-06-06	Entertainment Weekly is owned by HBO's parent company, Time Warner Cable, so it's probably equal parts corporate synergy and Hibberd's enthusiasm for the source material (and now the show) that led to him being their go-to-guy.Â
5421	sj4iy	2014-06-06	Is it Sunday night yet? God, I am already insanely excited for this episode...I've already watched and rewatched the previews over and over again just to see if I can see anything else XD
5422	Father of Dragons	2014-06-06	Does the lack of a Lysa or Oberyn slow motion death "confirm" it'll be Ygritte in Boromir fashion?
5423	alcasinoroyale	2014-06-06	I don't know if Ygritte dying will be as emotional as Oberyn because this would be her fourth episode this season and she hasn't really had many lines. I feel like they could have added Stannis and Ygritte scenes to some of these episodes that were only 51 minutes.Â
5424	Arkash	2014-06-06	Even if Ygritte dies in slow-mo, I doubt it will be the final punch of the episode as I see her dying around the 40 minutes mark (at the end of her group's raid and defeat at CB, before Jon is sent to treat with Stannis).
Â 
About her group's raid. The Watch will end victorious on that front, no mysteries there, apart from the fates of Tormund and the Thenn Warg. I hope both survive. I can see Tormund escaping after fataly injuring Thorne, maybe even finding his way through the tunnel and back to Mance's camp. And I hope the owl of the Thenn Warg will be the bird set aflame by Melisandre (if this makes the cut).
5425	Konradsmith	2014-06-06	^The promo pic of Jon and Sam that is in the daylight sure looks like they've been through some shit. Jon looks like he's mourning her for sure. I'd guess it might even be earlier than the forty minute mark.
5426	Arkash	2014-06-06	Yeah, I think you're right. This picture is cleary in the early-morning light, so after Ygritte's death, Jon having a moment to mourn her, before probably, Slynt decides to send him treat with Mance. I hope we'll get an angy Jon trying to jump at him to kill him and that Sam or some other holds him back before Jon realize (I hope aloud) it is the best choice, he's the one who knows the wildlings best and the only one who could talk with them.Â 
Â 
This episode is the perfect opportunity for the "Kill the boy and let the man be born" and the morning calm would be a good moment to put it.
5427	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-06	Why do so many people here seem to believe that there will be an eagle burning? I find it much more likely that eitherÂ 
1. The eagle is replaced with the Thenn Warg's owl. This would make sense because Orell's eagle which Mel burns, was used to scout just like the Thenn Warg's owl is used to scout
Or
2. There is no burning at allÂ 
Â 


Good point. I suppose it doesn't matter whether its the eagle or owl, I'm just hoping one of them burns.Â
5428	Finch	2014-06-06	This could possibly be the best episode of season 4, although i'm aware of certain events in episode 10 which will raise some eyebrows.
5429	Frey Pies	2014-06-06	From what I've read on GoT's official FB page, people seem to be loving the preview! The battle should go down well with the audience
5430	MR92	2014-06-06	Good point. I suppose it doesn't matter whether its the eagle or owl, I'm just hoping one of them burns.Â  


we better get mel burnin something...idk it was always a cool scene in my mind when reading the book and i think it adds a lot without having to do much at all. Â
5431	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-06	I'm somehow pretty sure we'll get Mel buring some Warg bird, otherwhile Carice's statement about spending time on a horse back wouldn't make much sense. And it just seems like a scene which would work very well and epic in both, book and show (and too good to get cutted  ).
And it would be nice to see Stannis using all his 'weapons' (I count a powerful sorceress as very useful weapon) he has in a battle.
ETA: I know this is STANNIS' great moment, but I wouldn't mind a nice Stannis/Davos/Mel shot all on horses, as we also had during his parley with Renly:http://images5.fanpo...661-245-245.gifhttp://images6.fanpo...409-500-281.jpg

5435	sj4iy	2014-06-06	https://www.youtube....h?v=hd-RBTvLhI4Â Soundtrack preview released !!Â Loving that snippet of "The Watchers of the Wall" theme ! Hope to get it in full during the episode !Â EDIT : the same goes for "The Biggest Fire the North has ever seen" and "Lets kill Crows" !Thank you so much, I can't wait to get the soundtrack and now I'm even more excited for the next episode
5436	Arkash	2014-06-06	"Craster's Keep" theme is (was) amazing ! Hope to hear it again sometimes !
5437	sj4iy	2014-06-06	Oh wow, I love "The Children"...I think the end of the series is going to absolutely epic.
5438	go joff go	2014-06-06	Children sounds like mhysa no?
5439	Newstar	2014-06-06	Children sounds like mhysa no?


Â 
Sounds like "Mhysa" and as someone with a better ear than I pointed out, it also sounds a bit like that unused track from the Season 3 soundtrack "Dark Wings, Dark Words." From the sounds of it, it seems like there's a good chance that this is the track playing over the final scene of Season 4 and the end credits.
Â 
If they go with the fire/ice/fire/ice pattern some have speculated they're using for the ending of the episodes, and if "The Children" plays over the final scene of the season, it seems likely that "Children" refers to the Children of the Forest, and that the "ice" final scene is Bran meeting Bloodraven.

5440	Arkash	2014-06-06	Apparently, the themes do not appear chronologically on the tracklist.
Â 
Except if some of them have already appeared so far, there are high chances "The North Remembers" is the last one we listen to this year.
Â 
I like that "The Watchers on the Wall" and "TBFTNHES" both have a similar vibe to "The Lannister send their regards". This fast and nervous beat speeding up slowly. It will work amazingly during the Battle !
Â 
"Let's Kill Some Crows" is definitly an even more brutal variation of the "Thenn" theme (try saying that fast). I think Styr's gonna end his potential speech before the battle with that. I was hoping for a Tormund speech but I doubt we'll get both.

5441	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-06-06	1.Davos/Mandereley meeting isnt only about money/soldiers of WH. Sure Stannis needs money and soldiers for his northern campaign.... That meeting is more about showing Mandereley's loyalty towards Starks who seem to, paraphrasing Jaime from AFFC "moving,things from their graves". It shows how enduring loyalty is earned in otherwise fickle westerosi Noblety. It also shows that Northmen can play the game of thrones and get down & dirty if need be. And of course prelude to Frey Pies. 
I thin mostly it's t deconstruct the trope that fans have developed that Ned was stupid and Tywin is brilliant, that things like honor, mercy and idealism have no place in this world and the only thing that works are cruelty, fear and pragmatism, as we watch the foundations of Tywin's legacy crumble like sand, and witness the deep roots of Ned's legacy endure like the roots of the weirwood, we get a new perspective on who was truly wise and who was truly foolish.

5443	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-06-07	Not sure, some people think even ygritte will survive and replace Val.
5444	Arkash	2014-06-07	My thought is that Tormund will fataly injure Thorne but will be the last one standing of his raiding party (with the possible exception of the Thenn Warg) and will have to fly away from the fight.
Â 
I'd like to see him try his way through the tunnels to meet with Mance north of the Wall but that is too much of an ask I think.

I'm a bit surprised (and happy) by just how much music seems to be from the next episode alone...it really seems as if they have devoted a lot of resources to this one episode. Â The way the music sounds, it really, really looks like we'll be on the edge of our seat the entire time. Â I surely hope so.

Â 
Nicely put, and absolutely true. Â I feel like in the show Tywin seems to be at the height of his apparent brilliance right now, but in just a few short weeks he will be dead, his family broke, his line under siege (Myrcella), his carefully formed alliances in disarray...
5447	stannisismyking	2014-06-07	I'm somehow pretty sure we'll get Mel buring some Warg bird, otherwhile Carice's statement about spending time on a horse back wouldn't make much sense. And it just seems like a scene which would work very well and epic in both, book and show (and too good to get cutted  ).
And it would be nice to see Stannis using all his 'weapons' (I count a powerful sorceress as very useful weapon) he has in a battle.
ETA: I know this is STANNIS' great moment, but I wouldn't mind a nice Stannis/Davos/Mel shot all on horses, as we also had during his parley with Renly:http://images5.fanpo...661-245-245.gifhttp://images6.fanpo...409-500-281.jpg
Â 


Â 
It is Stannis' moment for sure, and he deserves to be back in the spotlight and savour a moment of triumph for once, but he wouldn't be there without Davos OR Mel so hopefully they won't be too far from his side.

Â 
I love Val, but I want her for two precise reasons in the show :
Â 
- She adds interesting dynamics to the Wall. She has a great relationship with Jon and I love the tensions about her among the Queen's Man at CB.
- She is Ice where Melisandre is Fire and Jon is hanging between these two gorgeous and very different women. I hope this makes the cut.

I love the beginning of that track as well although the snippet I linked might've been something composed separately.. same key at least judging from a quick listen but different dynamicsÂ  (was played over 405 credits - https://www.youtube....h?v=tw-98xG3u8Y) but the part here has such a different dynamic.. the audio cues definitely work well for what you're describing from the actual track though.

Holy shit, I hope we get at least one wide shot of the army (at least something on the vein of what we got when Roose was watching the massacre at The Twins)The clip of the fire in the promo was pretty damn impressive...I will be curious to see how much we will be able to see during a night battle.
5471	Cake	2014-06-07	Just wanted to say how weird it is how we book readers who know the outcome speculate much more about this episode than the unsullied.Â 
Â 
Most of them seem like they couldn't care less even though the building up for the battle has lasted for more than 2 yearsÂ
5472	Rhaquentis	2014-06-07	Hopefully it won't look as "empty" as Blackwater looked. I mean, it was still pretty cool considering it's a TV show, but a little CGI was needed to show more soldiers in the field or something. I would love to see an overhead shot of thousands of wildlings attacking at least, not only random shots of five wildlings against five crows
5473	Seneti	2014-06-07	Â 
I agree with all! (Except that Arya's list in the show includes Beric and Thoros and I don't hate Beric and Thoros )


Â 


What do you think will be their opinion about the BwB and especially Thoros after the finale? (And about LS?)


Â 
Well, I think most Unsullied judge the named characters by how they relate to other known characters and not the unnamed populace in general, which is why I think that their opinion of the BwB might be pretty low atm - no matter how many people they saved, they sold out Gendry to Melisandre and betrayed Arya. Bringing Catelyn back from the dead and hanging Freys will most likely earn them some popularity points, which will go straight back down the drain once they try to hang Brienne.
Â 


It's funny that there's interviews out there about the episode but at the time of the interviews, no one has actually seen the finished product yet. Kit Harrington is only referencing the stuff he was involved with the in the filming and D&D are talking to EW well before the SFX have even been included.


Â 
Fun fact: The thing that's so expensive about CGI is not the equipment or the software - it's the hours of work involved in rendering all the stuff. Chances are they were still working on that well into May.
Â 


Question: does anyone think Tormund will be killed off in the show (even though he's still alive in the books)? Thoughts?


Â 
I don't think so, unless they skip the capture of Mance and have him be the one that Jon deals with in season 5 (in terms of letting the Wildlings through the Wall).Â 
Â 


I just realized what an enormous phrase. TBFTNHES is. It could pass as one of Dany's titles.

That's what I had thought, but rewatching the scene, they do not use it at the coronation. It would be perfect for Stannis since it somehow resembles"the King's arrival" (when Robert arrives North)Â
5500	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-06-08	I'm pretty much just as excited to see the episode 10 preview tomorrow. It uploads to HBOGo alongside the episode, just shortly after the episode has begun. So I'll probably be looking at it during the battle prep.

5505	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-06-08	If they take out the Stannis chant.... fuck D&D.


Yup. I'll be mightily pissed if they cut out the chant. They had one for Tyrion, have one for Stan the Man too.
5506	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	I wouldn't be so quick to judge the entire episode based on whether or not they include a chant. I mean, it's Neil Marshall doing another battle but this time with way more time to plan ahead before filming (for Blackwater he only had a few weeks!) The episode is going to be good no matter what they cut and include. They put aside a good deal of time to shoot this one specifically and put tons of love and money into it. Besides, we know Stan will arrive and show up and his badassery will likely cap the episode. They may well include the chant and if it plays onscreen I hope they do. If they cut it however, it's still Stan's victory and chant or no, he'll look awesome for winning it. Would you really be mad about a bunch of troops yelling a guy's name when you could actually see that guy in person on horseback taking names instead? That seems like a stretch.
Â 
Let's try and go into this one without prejudice. Like Blackwater this will be a cinematic experience where you sit down and you get one story rather than bits of many stories. IT WILL BE GOOD. This needs to be stressed, I think. I just rewatched Blackwater and I'm hyped as fuck. I hope that we approach it with gleeful anticipation rather than pre-emptive quibbling.
5507	The Drunkard	2014-06-08	Personally I'd rather Stannis commanding from the rear, with the chant, than him zerging into the camp without the chant.
5508	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	^Is your thumbnail Adam Goldberg?
5509	The Drunkard	2014-06-08	Yeeeep. Him and his partner's awesome drum theme on Fargo made me change it.
5510	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	^Yeah, that's a great show so far. I didn't know Martin Freeman could go so dark, maybe he should be on GoT!
5511	The Taxman	2014-06-08	I wouldn't be so quick to judge the entire episode based on whether or not they include a chant. I mean, it's Neil Marshall doing another battle but this time with way more time to plan ahead before filming (for Blackwater he only had a few weeks!) The episode is going to be good no matter what they cut and include. They put aside a good deal of time to shoot this one specifically and put tons of love and money into it. Besides, we know Stan will arrive and show up and his badassery will likely cap the episode. They may well include the chant and if it plays onscreen I hope they do. If they cut it however, it's still Stan's victory and chant or no, he'll look awesome for winning it. Would you really be mad about a bunch of troops yelling a guy's name when you could actually see that guy in person on horseback taking names instead? That seems like a stretch.

Â 
In any other scenario I'd agree with these sentiments... but when it comes to Stannis, no. They need to include the chant, period. They have downgraded Stannis enough. Time to let the man have his shine.Â
5512	Professional Dragonslayer	2014-06-08	I really hope they leave out the "Stannis"-chant because I dislike all battle chants. However, they should show some badass Stannis.
5513	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-08	I hope Thorne kicks some major ass. Really love that actor.

5515	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I hope Thorne kicks some major ass. Really love that actor.

Me, too.  He's actually made me like Thorne, despite his asshole treatment of Jon.  I think he's a much more rounded character in the show than in the books, tbh.  I hope he goes out in an awesome fashion.
5516	sati	2014-06-08	I have been waiting for that goddamn scene so long but I'll be OK with them cutting the chant. That little snippet of the track is amazing and I'm almost sure they will use it in the ending - they always go with original tracks for big moments. I'm also almost sure in the last second or 2 Stannis shows up in the frame (1:46 of soundtrack preview) and that's the end of the ep.
Â 
I love the chant but the reason I love it is that it conveys the importance of the event and gives him the credit - it's Stannis who rescued them, rescued the North from the wildlings, rescued the Wall. He is the only one who cared. And no matter what, he came to help.
Â 
Beautiful, hopeful sounding music building up and building up and showing him at the very end does just as much as chant. I dare to say - does more.

Hopefully it ends there and not Jon's puppy face gasping

In the books I think Thorne was Targ supporter before he got expelled by the new regime after Rebellion. That was his main reason for his snarkiness/assholish behaviour with Jon, because Jon was bastard son of Eddard Stark, military hero of the Rebellion.

I think the episode will end with Stannis charging through the wildlings and while his army keeps attacking the wildlings, he stops in front of Mance tent (made distinctibly recognizable) and we have a brief exchange between Jon and Stannis :
Â 
- You're a brother of the Night's Watch, I see. Where is the King-Beyond-the Wall ?
*Jon presents Mance to Stannis.*
- Who are you boy ?
- My name is Jon Snow. I am the bastard son of Ned Stark, a brother of the Night's Watch, the Watcher on the Wall.
- I am King Stannis Baratheon, King of the Andals, *titles, titles...* and I've come to protect my Kingdom.
Â 
Ending.

It looks like 75% of the episode will be him fighting and pitching woo to anybody who wants to hear him.
Â 
Looks like he's going to make Janos Slynt shit his pants on the Wall looking down on what's coming what with Janos' bluster.Â 
Â 
Might be nice to see some of the more minor characters get their turn to shine in an episode (Thorne, Slynt, Grenn, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr, Eddison...Stannis Â ). I'm kind of wondering what Sam will do.

Â 
Yeah, I think this episode is MUCH more about Jon than Stannis. Â Stannis comes in and saves the day, sure, but like Jon pointed out in the book, there wouldn't have been anything to save if Jon and the Night's Watch hadn't staved off the attack in the first place. Â I think Stannis' battle against Ramsay will be more about him than his coming in and finishing off the Wildlings.
5529	Arkash	2014-06-08	We need more Dolorous Edd !
Â 
Ot at least one name-dropping of "Dolorous Edd" and I'll be happy, even if it translates bad aloud (never found it to have a really nice ring to it aloud).

Â 
Yes, in A Game of Thrones, while Tyrion is visiting the Wall, they tell him Thorne was fighting in King's Landing during the rebellion, but on the "wrong side". Tywin gave him the choice of taking the black, or having his head on a spike. This may be the reason for his overall bitterness and bad treatment of the recruits in general, and of course there are the above reasons to hate Jon, in particular.

That may be, but I think that the show version's Thorne has a few more layers in him. Â We got his talk with Jon and Sam about how he had to survive out beyond the Wall and ended up eating his dead comrades, so to me, it seems that he's being hard on recruits simply because he knows how harsh the conditions will be out there. Â He also just doesn't seem as bent on revenge against Jon as much as in the books...we even see him call on Jon to ask his advice- and he even agrees with him about not going after the Wildling raiders. Â I'm not saying he's a good person or a better person than in the novels, but I sympathize with him more in the show. Â There are just very, very subtle changes to his character without really changing him, I think.

I agree he's a deeper and more interesting character in the show. And I also completely buy the theory that he will die a heroic death in the coming episode, possibly getting the "The Wall is yours, Jon Snow" line. Or will it be "The Wall is yours, Lord Snow"?

He doesn't ask Jon's advice; he forces Jon to publicly agree with him in order to put Jon in his place. Then there's also the scene where he publicly berates Jon for daring to train the men how to fight wildlings better! Surely there's no logical reason for that, with battle imminent, other than putting that bastard in his place again just because Thorne hates him.
I agree that Owen Teale is doing a great job with the part, and that the character had some layers in S1, but in S4 not so much.

Aww (Love this scene so much ), he feels so cute uncomfortable with hugs and much love for him.
But after tonight everyone will want to hug him, whether forum user or NW brother... (Now I imagine this scene with Jon instead of Shireen XD)
Or the Stannis/Davos scene in 2x08 with Jon/Stannis:
Jon: "Every man at the Wall wanted to kiss you that morning."
Stannis: "I was relieved they did not."

Either way, every time he 'asks' for advice from Jon, he is putting Jon in a position of leadership. Â I think he's done a good job this season and isn't nearly as hateful as he is in the books. Â And he's definitely not as much of a suck up to Slynt like he is in the books.

5549	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	I think they'll want to end the episode in the thick of the battle, an emotional high; giving the moment enough time to develop into any kind of dialogue would diminish it IMO.
5550	Zylathas	2014-06-08	I would certainly love the episode ending with Stannis saying something. "I am King Stannis Baratheon and I have to come to save the realm would certainly be fitting." But I think "The realm is saved, the wildling army has been routed" would do aswell. Although line 1 sounds much more epic.
5551	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-08	I thin mostly it's t deconstruct the trope that fans have developed that Ned was stupid and Tywin is brilliant, that things like honor, mercy and idealism have no place in this world and the only thing that works are cruelty, fear and pragmatism, as we watch the foundations of Tywin's legacy crumble like sand, and witness the deep roots of Ned's legacy endure like the roots of the weirwood, we get a new perspective on who was truly wise and who was truly foolish.

Agree with this.Also the Wildlings have been painted badly this season.Repairing that is probably a job for next season but hopefully they can start the process in this episode.Hope there's some Mance dialogue too.

5572	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-08	I wouldn't be so quick to judge the entire episode based on whether or not they include a chant. I mean, it's Neil Marshall doing another battle but this time with way more time to plan ahead before filming (for Blackwater he only had a few weeks!) The episode is going to be good no matter what they cut and include. They put aside a good deal of time to shoot this one specifically and put tons of love and money into it. Besides, we know Stan will arrive and show up and his badassery will likely cap the episode. They may well include the chant and if it plays onscreen I hope they do. If they cut it however, it's still Stan's victory and chant or no, he'll look awesome for winning it. Would you really be mad about a bunch of troops yelling a guy's name when you could actually see that guy in person on horseback taking names instead? That seems like a stretch.
Â 
Let's try and go into this one without prejudice. Like Blackwater this will be a cinematic experience where you sit down and you get one story rather than bits of many stories. IT WILL BE GOOD. This needs to be stressed, I think. I just rewatched Blackwater and I'm hyped as fuck. I hope that we approach it with gleeful anticipation rather than pre-emptive quibbling.


I definitely agree with you. While I would love to hear the chants, seeing Stannis ride in victorious would suffice. In the book Jon never gets a look at Stannis so the chants were a necessity. They won't be a necessity in the show. Having said that, I'd still rather them be included than not. Starting with the chants and then panning to Stannis riding would be epic.Â

5573	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-06-08	I really hope this episode will be the one to make the Unsullieds care about the Wall. They have time to flesh up many characters during the battle and I'm sure that will help a lot for the future season.


Â 
That won't happen because D & D don't care one bit about The Wall. The showrunners would have to be invested for the audience to be so. That will never happen. The audience only cares about what the show cares about so there is no chance that they will be invested in the future.
5574	Mark Antony	2014-06-08	Plenty of fans like Jon
5575	MyLittleFinger	2014-06-08	I hadn't even considered Tormund being killed in this episode. If that were to happen I would be crushed. He's a great character.Â 


He's a great character in the books, he's an ok character in the show. I wouldn't really miss him, but them bringing Styr into the fold makes it seem more likely Tormund survives and gets to do his thing in S5.
5576	stannisismyking	2014-06-08	Plenty of fans like Jon 


I always assumed he was one of the fan favourites!?
Â 
I mean he's certainly not one of mine (I don't dislike him at all just don't really care about him) but I usually like unpopular characters so I'm never able to guage these things properly.
5577	go joff go	2014-06-08	Here is my crazy prediction.  Mance is killed and tormund ends up taking his book responsibilities post battle.
5578	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-06-08	My dream ending is Stannis in a helmet faces of Mance in the thick of battle, swords clash and Mance is eventually knocked to the ground with Stannis holding light bringer against his neck. Multiple camera angles of the wildlings being slaughtered and routed. Jon and the Night's watch looking around in shock.
Â 
Stannis takes of his helmet, says something badass to Mance like he used to in season 2 and the cries of "Stannis! Stannis!Â Stannis!" abrupt around him.
Â 
Fade to black. Â 
Â 
Edit: Its hilarious how we are all most interested in the last few minutes of the episode. I can't wait to see Jon defending the top of the wall. Thorne will most likely get killed but he will go out taking out a giant or the Magnar.Â 


 Â So true. At least 50% of the speculation has been about Stannis which will likely consist of about 5% of the episode. I really like your idea for the ending. The concept of him saying some quick badass line about saving the realm is becoming more appealing to me.Â
5579	sati	2014-06-08	And how dare anyone behave like that on the STANNIS DAY. My God, this is outrageous

He's definitely a fan favorite
5581	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-08	It's funny, because Stephen Dillane is more than 20 years older than Stannis.
I know, but actually, tbh, I've always thought Show!Stannis would look even younger than Book!Stannis.
Stannis in the books is 34/35, but almost bald, his skin looks like leather, he's gaunt and later in the books his head reminds on a skull, he looks very unhealthy (especially after the shadow babies) and 10 years older than he actually is.
Stannis in the show is Stephen Dillane, who's 57, but well, what should I say: He's Stephen Dillane  (who looks, Imo, younger than he actually is).

Stephen Dillane is God so I don't think age matters in any way  The normal standards just don't apply to him.
5583	14ccKemistk	2014-06-08	Personally, I hope that this Episode is not too much of a Blackwater mirroring. When Tywin made his Deus Ex Machina entrance, I personally didn't even understand who was coming and which side they were on. Then all of a sudden, the Lannisters has won.
Â 
I would like to see an earlier Stannis entrance, with a prolonged sequence where we really see who is coming and their fight to victory. Then of course topped with some badass Stannis quotes about pantries and pudding .

Lol what? they really are a bunch of raiding, murdering, raping scumbags. That's what's in the books. In previous seasons they were painted way to nice in my opinion.

Now, I think the Wall deserves an entire episode, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the show-only fans upset that they have to wait until the finale next week to see what happens to Tyrion.

Â 
Yeah I've always thought Stephen could pass for mid to late 40s as Stannis, particularly in S2. I think having his hair dyed in S2 was deliberate because they knew they'd want him to look very aged in S3 after the shadow babies etc. I can buy that Show!Stannis is younger than Davos too, even though Dillane is older than Liam Cunningham.

I just remember that the cook Hobb grilled one mammoth after the battle, I hope they do it on the show, too. I'd like to see Stan smelling at mammoth meat and making that "The meat's off" grimace as in 4x02 XD

Â 
Great casting is one of Thrones huge strengths and Dillane is definitely one of the best. First season I saw him in I really complained about the actor. I didn't know that the character actually was supposed to be such a charmless, rigid bore.
Â 
Stannis' greatest dialogues are still in ahead of us, as Lord Commander Snow will be the first person to actually be his equal in stature.

Yep, I see it as you! Whereas Book!Stannis looks 10 years older than he is, looks Stephen 10 years younger than he is (and yes, also Imo, younger than Liam. The beard makes him older, but it's a wonderful Davos-beard  ). 
And the darker hair in S2 fits also to Robert's and Renly's, I guess they also wanted to make the typical Baratheon-appearance more visible.

Yes! Â I've always been fascinated by this. He looks particularly different in the parley scene in 2.04 to any other scene IMO

Nobody will ever be as popular as Tyrion, anybody wishing differently are deluding themselves (not that you're one of them obviously)

I think, being a book reader, I have a different opinion of them because of what happens in the later books. Tyrion and Dany diminish in the later books and I feel less compelled by their stories, while Jon and Arya's stories get much, much better and exciting. I will be interested to see if the same thing happens in the show. Admittedly, I didn't like Jon much in the first book, but I loved him in the third book and read through ADwD purely for his POVs. Dany was pretty much the opposite, and Tyrion's story took a nosedive after ASoS.

He said he doesn't like giving interviews in general and would rather leave "that sort of thing" to other people so I'm thinking he might manage to get out of doing them for GoT some way. Â  The only time I've seen him actively doing promo work was for The Tunnel. But he's the lead actor in that so I reckon he has nowhere to hide and promo work is just part of the deal.

No helmet, no shield, first on the beach, first to the wall, first up the ladder and then proceeded to make mince meat out of Lannisters until he was dragged away by his bannermen.Â

Â 
As for whether Stannis will be portrayed as badass as in Blackwater, the proof to me is evidenced by the episode's director. It was Neil Marshall's idea after for Stan to be a front line commander, where he just yelled out orders from the back of the troops in Martin's script. (As GrrM says on his Blackwater commentary).

Only way I think it can play out other than him just hiding at the top of the Wall and I'm guessing he gets chewed out by Jon at some point for being a coward and playing up there whole "You killed a white walker, you survived the fist, get a hold of yourself."

Ugh yes we're gonna have a lot of fatty coward time too .
5632	King Tommen	2014-06-08	John Bradley talked about Sam's arc this season and how at the start of the season he makes some poor decisions based on his own self loathing and fears (sending Gilly to Moletown) but that by the end, he'd have redeemed himself and that when all was said and done, it would be Sam's most triumphant season. Â Pretty sure he's going to find a way to save Gilly during this battle.
Â 

Â 
Â 
"Samâ<U+0080><U+0099>s progression over the 10 hours of Season 4 is one of the most rapid, dramatic progressions weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever seen because he starts in a relatively content place, makes some catastrophic decisions -- based on his own neurosis and his own self-loathing -- that plunges him back down to the lowest emotional point heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been in the series. For Sam, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kinda saying something. From then on itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a very, very slow, a very, very palpable upward progression, culminating in what will essentially be his finest hour."

Agreed, and almost certainly with a crossbow.

5635	Mark Antony	2014-06-08	^Unless he's referring to his electoral jiggering.
Yeah that was my first thought. I originally agreed with the people theorizing Jon would get elected early season 5 now I think they might sneak it in the finale
5636	King Tommen	2014-06-08	^Unless he's referring to his electoral jiggering.


Â 
Even if that's it, I find it hard to believe he won't get a good moment during the battle since we've seen shots of him running around with a crossbow. The whole "upward progression" Bradley is referencing.
Â 

Â 
Â 
Will there be more instances where Sam gets to show his bravery again?Absolutely, yeah. Sam is the best kind of bravery there is. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the best kind of hero because he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a hero. I was doing an interview the other day and the reporter pointed out the parallel between Samwell and Joffrey, that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re both completely unaware of their blind spots. Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s unaware of the negative aspects of himself and Samâ<U+0080><U+0099>s unaware of the positive aspects of himself. Sam is the last person to acknowledge that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s any good at all because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been told all his life heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no good and worth nothing. Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s so many places where he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have time to think, to convince himself not to do something. He has to act impulsively and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s when you see the best of him. I think heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll have plenty opportunity to flex those muscles this year.

5637	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	The election really wouldn't need to take up much time. They could just show how it works with the kettle and arrowheads and whatnot without explaining it, just like they showed rather than told about the bread and salt in 309. It could be a few really short scenes with some of the comic relief of those chapters peppered in from Edd and co. Or it could be one medium length scene leading into Jon's last scene of the season. But I guess this is stuff that ought to be for the 410 page.
Â 
I do agree. He'll shoot a baddie with that crossbow. And maybe get a kiss from Gilly or something.

HBO doesn't give a shit about episode runtimes because they don't advertise. I think the way D&D have explained it before is that the runtimes are the last thing that are determined after the episodes are shot and edited. They shoot what they think they need to tell the story they need to for the season. They don't have to adhere to a very specific runtime like network shows do.

But someone posted that in the UK, they DO run commercials during the episode.Â  There was a kerfluffle because Sky (is that the UK tv station that runs HBO stuff?) grandly announced that for the rest of this season they're only going to interrupt the episode with commercials once, instead of several times as usual.

Â 
In the UK it comes on at 9pm, Monday (tomorrow) on Sky Atlantic. It sucks having to wait a day later! 
Â 
However, it is usually uploaded onto the internet about 15 mins-1hour after the episode ends in America. That means sometime after 3am forÂ UK timeÂ which is pretty late but if you're desperate enough then it beats waiting a day.Â 
Â 
Should watch the live discussion on the forum. It isÂ very entertaining!

It works both ways. If Stannis had arrived, Jon's effort could've been overshadowed by Stannis. Arriving only in the next episode, Stannis' victory could be overshadowed by the other events of the episode. It depends on which character is more important. Also, it's likely they didn't want the episode to be too similar to Blackwater, with "the cavalry" arriving at the last minute once again. That could've made the episode less original and kinda repetitive. I'm not sure what to think about the ending just yet, but the rest of the episode was perfect. I'm glad they didn't kill Tormund, Throne and Slynt this soon.

iircÂ  in the books theÂ battle at the wall was divided between two books.Â  This part of the battle was spot on.Â Â Exactly like the books, or close enough not to matter.Â  Next episode, things will be getting worse and worse for NW until Jon gets Mance nearly at a truce.Â  Then D&D drop theÂ WallÂ until season 5 leaving the NW in terrible condition and almost done in.Â  That way they can leave us with another famous cliffhanger.Â Â

Jon won't reach the end of his book3 storyline in S4, and probably will need about 2 episodes to get elected. And he has plenty of book5 stuff, unlike practically all of the other characters. (Dany is well within her book5 arc, Tyrion will start book5 next season, Sansa almost covered all her book 4 stuff, and Arya doesn't have that much stuff to do. Bran has 3 ADWD chapters and they will cover the first one next ep. Theon/Boltons are already at Wf.If this means Jon will have more screentime next season to catch up, I'm fine with it.

5690	Tadco26	2014-06-09	I'm fine with the Stannis delay, but my concern is that they blew their budgetÂ here and Stannis attack won't actually be shown like most battles on the show that have been cut.

I imagine that scene was also directed by Marshall and might've been moved from episode 9 to the finale. It has happened in many other episodes.
5692	Tadco26	2014-06-09	It looks like from the preview for next weekÂ that at least some of the fight will be shown, at least significantly more than what we were given with the White Walkers attacking the Fist of the First Men.
5693	A Man Reads	2014-06-09	I imagine that scene was also directed by Marshall and might've been moved from episode 9 to the finale. It has happened in many other episodes.


I'm not sure about that. Episode nine was shot entirely at night save for the ending. The charge scene in the preview was clearly shot during the day. That's probably a built in transition between the episodes.
5694	Pilusmagnus	2014-06-09	Since Tormund has been captured by the Watch and Mance will likely be captured too, who will Jon treat with when it comes to discussing the alliance between wildlings and Night's Watch ? It seems unlikely that they'll introduce a character to do that, and I don't see Tormund escaping Castle Black...
So what do you think?
5695	Logodnica	2014-06-09	The fight between Thormud and Slynt, and between Jon and the Thenn were the best I've seen these 4 seasons.  They movements didn't just look natural, but they were so fast! 
And they were both better than the disappointing Viper vs. Mountain fight.
5696	Taylor Goddard	2014-06-09	I like how the wildlings have method in their madness by lighting that huge fire. Not sure if anyone noticed but that would have made sure their attack on the Wall would not interrupted by the Others.

Official Synopsis: Jon Snow and the Night's Watch face a big challenge.
Official Promo: https://www.youtube....h?v=Mo9AmIbob1c, https://www.youtube....eature=youtu.be
Official Recap: https://www.youtube....h?v=FmQuzhNlyl4
Â 
NOTES: I will update this post throughout the week as I learn new information. The following is my own personal speculation based on what I've seen from the trailers and promos, what I have heard from other sources and read from the source material.
Â 
---
This will go a little different than the usual speculation threads, since only one storyline is featured in this episode. Yes, the entire hour is centered around the events at the Wall. No Tyrion awaiting his execution, no Arya or Dany or Brienne - just Jon Snow, Sam, Ygritte, Gilly, Mance Rayder and Stannis fucking Baratheon entangled in one huge spectacle.
Â 
The battle will be comprised of three smaller battles, according to director Neil Marshall. I assume they are: 1) Tormund's group and the Thenns assaulting Castle Black from the south, 2) Mance's army besieging the Wall from the North, and 3) Stannis' forces charging down and routing the wildling host.
Â 
The first two parts will apparently take place entirely over one night (and the third part the following morning), though in the book they occurred over several nights and days. I get it: the darkness is easy on the budget (that's why they had the Battle of Blackwater take place at night as well), but I would really like to see a daytime battle at SOME point in the series' run. Anyway...
Â 
Pre-fight: We'll get some scenes of the various parties preparing for the battle. Definitely one with Ygritte and company at a camp fire, in which the Thenn warg uses his owl to witness Mance's signal and lets the group know that "it's time." Apparently, a scene between Jon and Sam on top of the Wall while they're on patrol. A scene where a Night's Watchman blows the horn for wildlings. Another one with Ser Alliser Thorne giving a grand speech to rouse the Night's Watch. Hopefully, we'll get something with Mance.
Â 
Attack from the South: During the night, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr and the Thenns will raid Castle Black. There's shots in the trailers of them running down a trail towards the gates while taking arrow fire, shots of them climbing over the front gate, and several shots of them fighting the Night's Watchmen throughout the castle, in the yard and on the catwalks, including a fight between Jon and Styr. It looks like there will also be some fighting on the elevator platform. In the books, Ygritte dies while storming the castle, so naturally I'm going to assume she meets a similar fate on screen. It's pretty likely that the orphan boy Olly will be the one to kill her. Apparently, Pyp will get an arrow through the neck himself (and probably die from it), and apparently it comes from Ygritte. A new addition (not from the books) is a battle between Tormund and Alliser. I say Tormund will win, because I can't believe he was upgraded to regular status only to be quickly killed off, but I wonder if Alliser survives (I doubt it; his leadership during the battle would make it really hard for Jon to win the following election fairly). At some point, there will be a scene in the tunnel under the Wall, in which some black brothers fight off a giant who is trying to break down the inner gate. I expect Grenn will take over Donal Noye's role in the novel by slaying, and being slayed by, the mighty giant.
Â 
Attack from the North: In the book, this part follows the failed attack from the south, but I believe the two battles will take place simultaneously on the show, and will be intercut. This would mean Jon won't be up on top of the Wall to lead the men, unfortunately. Jon IS up on top at some point, though (and in that shot, there is a scarecrow behind him - it looks like those are in!). He sees Mance's signal (the Haunted Forest on fire, or a sea of torches?) from the parapets, but I assume he eventually goes down to fight in the yard after giving some orders. There are several shots in the trailers of wildlings and even a mammoth marching through the trees and grouping up for a mass battle cry in front of the Haunted Forest. We haven't seen a lot of footage from the actual attack in the promotional videos, though. A few shots of archers loosing arrows down at the approaching horde, some leaning too far out and some falling, while the battlements around them explode into splinters. Down below, we see some wildlings running towards the Wall and the ones reaching it being thrown back by a blast, apparently from barrels thrown down from up above. Also, some sort of explosion near the gate causing the mammoth to turn around and start trampling some wildlings (I knew Neil couldn't resist!).
Â 
Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!: I'm guessing Janos sends Jon to treat with Mance. There is a trailer shot of a distressed Mance running around his camp and many of Stannis' cavalry running down the confused and disorganized wildlings. There are shots in the trailers of Jon riding inside the ice tunnel of the Wall; this could be him going to see Mance, but it could just as easily be something else cut from earlier in the season. There is an extra shot of Jon in the tunnel, with Sam holding a torch and looking morose. This could be Sam accompanying Jon on his way to Mance, briefly looking at the remains of Grenn and the giant, or it could be them welcoming Stannis to Castle Black, although I think that will happen in episode ten.
Â 
Loose Ends: Will we see Stannis during his charge? I hope so. I want a brave, heroic Stannis moment. Will we see Davos during the battle or not until the finale? Melisandre lighting Orell's eagle on fire? I assume the eagle will come back into play during the battle (why else have it get away alive last season?). What does Sam do during the battle? He WILL reunite with Gilly, but I'm not sure if this happens in episode nine or ten. We see him in the promo running around with a crossbow. Maybe he kills somebody? According to an interview, one of the major deaths this season was filmed to be in slow-motion. It wasn't Lysa or Oberyn, and I hope it isn't Tywin, so I'm going to assume it will be Ygritte or Pyp. In the trailers, there are several more shots I didn't discuss above. There was a scene in the Foreshadowing video of Sam and Jon discussing Ygritte; this could be a scene from the pre-battle section of this episode, or it could have been cut from an earlier episode or be from the season finale. Finally, there is a shot of a bunch of burning men around a burning man getting dragged through the snow by a rope. If it wasn't for the snow, I would think this was the dragons getting chained up. It still could be, if their intention was to replace the snow with sand in post-production. If not, what could it be? Some sort of trap or the mammoth dragging them?
Â 
---
Â 
In summation: should be awesome... very, very awesome. Ygritte's death, Alliser v. Tormund, giants and mammoths and STANNIS!
Â 
What do you guys think? Anything to add?

5698	Patchfaith	2014-06-06	Great work. Only thing I've got to add is that Jon will obviously kick ass, kill Styr and probably their warg. Don't think he's going out to Mance at all, that was mostly a GRRM diversion to use him as POV camera for Stannis' attack.
5699	Konradsmith	2014-06-06	Great work, Ignorant Bow Woman, a shame this was only approved now because the other 409 thread is way too fucking long.
Â 
They list the ep. as being 51 minutes and the recap is 1 minute and 45 seconds. That leads me to believe the episode will only really be 49 minutes or so.

I think it's just some random horn that signals the battle
5702	stannisismyking	2014-06-06	Probably a fairly good chance the Joseph Gatt!Thenn!Owl will take the place of the eagle?
Â 
I know IMDB is not very reliable but Carice is not listed as a cast member for this ep (at least not the last time I checked) and Stephen and Liam are.Â  But I really hope we see Melisandre AND Davos at Stannis' side.Â  I know a lot of people in this fandom get the vapours over Melisandre's role in Stannis' storyline but she is really important and I think it would be great to see her have some part in the battle.
5703	The Drunkard	2014-06-06	I hope Melisandre is in this battle. She belongs there more than Davos does; she's a powerful sorcerer, he's more of a diplomat-ninja-pirate, andÂ I want to see that owl burn.
Â 
Really hope they include the parley. They haven't done anything much with Mance and this is a good chapter for him.Â Though I don't know why on earth they wouldn't and we've seen Jon riding through the tunnel, so this looks good.

I haven't been impressed with Mance in the show - though to be fair I didn't think much of him in the books - but an actual scene between Stannis and Mance has the potential to be great.
5705	~No One~	2014-06-06	Well summarized, Ignorant Bog Woman! The only thing I'd add is that due to the voice-over on the promo, there'll be at least one scene with my favourite Maester 
My speculation is that it occurs after Ygritte's death, but it could be used as foreshadowing, too. Aemon says that, and then boom! Buh bye Gritte-zy!
5706	Dildo_Baggins	2014-06-06	What makes you sure that Stannis will strike in this episode
5707	The Drunkard	2014-06-06	One of the people in charge (the director, IIRC) said this episode features three battles in one. Two are obviously the southern attack by Tormund, Ygritte and ThennGuy, and Mance's attack from the North.Â The third would have to be Stannis' attack from the east.
Â 
Plus, 50 minutes on what was something like two or three chapters is a bit much already. Not even getting through those chapters would be such a drag.
5708	Chebyshov	2014-06-06	Well done as always,Â Ignorant Bog Woman.
Â 

What makes you sure that Stannis will strike in this episode

Â 
Well, as the OP said,

There is a trailer shot of a distressed Mance running around his camp and many of Stannis' cavalry running down the confused and disorganized wildlings.

But moreover, if Stannis doesn't come, then how the heck is this episode going to last an hour? And what would be the point of it.
5709	sati	2014-06-06	What makes you sure that Stannis will strike in this episode


Common sense? What use of whole battle episode if they don't show the outcome in it?
5710	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-06-06	What makes you sure that Stannis will strike in this episode


Â 
Why would he not? How would the episode even end if not for Stannis saving the day?
Â 
They confirmed Stannis going to the Wall in S3, so it's not like the NW somehow beats 100k wildlings and then Stannis will show up next year saying hey good job guys can I have your castles?

And the actual promo footage, a bunch of footage really - his knights charging, Mace running, scared Giant in the morning light...if Stannis is gonna kill a giant I'm gonna explode.
5712	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-06-06	two things popped in my head after the official recap -Â 
Â 
1) seems like very obvious set up for Janos Slynt's beheading. the scene where Jon tells him he was obviously not good at his job and his rage at that...no reason to throw that specifically in if no beheading
Â 
2) any chance ygritte might be carrying jon's child? just the sequence of their interaction in the recap...the cave scene, to show they had sex, then her saying you'll be loyal to your woman, then jon saying he has to go back and her in tears saying you know nothing, then just a few clips later showing her sparing gilly and child...
Â 
seemed suspicious to me, cant rmr it from the books if she was actually pregnant...but if its an addition in the show...not sure yet how i feel about that...

Â 
1) It's likely that if Thorne dies during the battle, that Slynt is the one (as acting senior NW leadership group) who sends Jon to treat with Mance. That's why they need to show their previous antagonistic interactions so that it's clear why Slynt is doing this. There wouldn't be time for Jon to be elected or for him to behead someone from the NW in the middle of this battle.
Â 
2) I think they highlighted the previous Ygritte/Jon stuff (including the cave sex) to remind the audience of their relationship for their conversation as she's dying in his arms. In the books, she says "We should have stayed in the cave" and I'd bet they use that line on the show. Â Gilly was shown being spared because she'll find her way back to Castle Black this episode somehow.

Â 
iv been hoping to see Slynt die since he betrayed Ned in the Throne roomÂ  
i didnt think about that...but you might be right....just seemed suspicious to me

Â 
yes i guess that does make sense...unexpected but acceptable...i was thinking they might show stannis come in, save their asses, pull a Tywin and march in to Castle Black saying "the battle is over, we have won!" then jon beheads slynt...but after your post i rmred that he does that after becoming LC, so thats definitely gona have to wait till next season...
Â 
again, very much makes sense that gilly being spared was so she returns safely to castle black...im kinda relieved they wont be showing Ygritte pregnant, might have been a bit too cheesy
5720	iheartseverus	2014-06-06	And the actual promo footage, a bunch of footage really - his knights charging, Mace running, scared Giant in the morning light...if Stannis is gonna kill a giant I'm gonna explode.


What, you don't have an appropriate Stannis pic for this statement?Â
5721	Arkash	2014-06-06	This would mean Jon won't be up on top of the Wall to lead the men, unfortunately. Jon IS up on top at some point
Â 

Â 
I've said it once but from the promos, it seems that the archers of the Watch will be suspended from top of the Wall to be able to fire at the wildlings below. It always bothered me the distance between the archers top of the Wall and the wildlings archers in the books, so I'm glad of this very visual change.
Â 
As for Jon top of the Wall I think he'll start the defense of the episode up there (witnessing the fire) before having to go down to stop the attack from the south.
5722	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-06	It'll actually be really cool considering two seasons ago the Battle of Blackwater showed Stannis' defeat in fire now it'll have an episode dedicated to Stannis' victory in ice. Â Loving the parallels.Â

Â 
i actually thought about it in a different way...
at blackwater and the wall, both cases, Stannis' enemy is wielding fire and trying to use it as a weapon against him...
at blackwater, Mel was left behind and hence he lost
at the Wall, she's with him and so he wins...
Â 
of course i do not believe Mel's involvement had anything to do with either outcome, but i bet she's gona spin it to make it seem like it was all her...i recall her stating to davos already last season something along the lines that if she was present during blackwater, the fire wouldn't have harmed them and it was his fault she was left behind...
Â 
curious to see if she's gona take credit for the victory in the show, dont think she did in the books...

Â 
Yes. And that was his last - and only - epic moment in the show. He's been lower than a snake's belly since 2.10 so it will be great to see him back on top, to see the man that people once feared (apart from Joffrey obviously, he was going to give him a red smile.....), the fierce warrior from pre-series.
Â 
Yeah I'm totally Â not working myself into a lather for this episode

Sam will run around with this crossbow to kill the giant (because he's about to harm Gilly and they want to show super-brave Sam), but he'll fail, everything's lost, but then comes the Mannis and saves Sam (and Gilly) from the giant, and Sam will say his "A King who still cares"-line out loud

"The Children" gives me nightmares. I swear, if they end on Dany again...
5746	Beric175	2014-06-07	Either 'The Children' refers to the Children of the Forest or the dragons, either of which works for me but would that mean that we either end on the Children of the Forest or Dany putting her dragons in the vault as it were?

Last track doesn't necessarily needs to be used last. Also the music can turn into something darker near the end for LS

Sounds very Dany to me... also sounds like an episode closeout kind of song.
Â 
Don't think the end the episode on that though as there are multiple shockers to this season.
Â 
I've gone and accomplished nothing here but made myself worry that they might close on Daenerys.. and yes, I know all the reasons why they probably won't but after last season, the fear is hard to shake.Â
5749	Arkash	2014-06-07	Well, just for the sake of playing, I'll keep my bet that "The Children" will be used for LC election. It would be a great theme... maybe ending when Jon and Stannis cross eyes.
5750	Frey Pies	2014-06-07	I wish this episode was longer. The past 3 episodes have been so awesome, but have ended so quickly. And now this too...
5751	eliamo	2014-06-07	Looks like this is going to be a great episode. Neil Marshall's work on Blackwater was incredible, and the extra pocket money he's been given for this episode is going to allow for a lot of wow moments. Bring on Monday!

Thanks! Just listened to it, and I'm not sure what scene it could fit in with. It's too uplifting for LS, and it has the wrong mood for Dany chaining up her dragons. As Daenerys Must Die said, it does have an episode closeout feel to it, which is definitely worrying. This season NEEDS to end with the reveal of LS. If it doesn't... D & D will have awoken the dragon.Â
5756	Arkash	2014-06-07	It still could only be used as a closing title theme after no music at all during LS reveal.
5757	eliamo	2014-06-07	Maybe, but I don't think D&D will want to present Catelyn's revival as some sort of triumphant event. It's not. After listening to some of the other tracks, I think Oathkeeper (5:30 in the video) could be for LS. It's ominous, dread-building, dark... and of course, its name ties in perfectly with Brienne's encounter with LS.

Either creepy, dark and heavy : Oathkeeper.
Either sad and depressing : The North Remembers.

5761	eliamo	2014-06-07	I reckon they'll go for a creepy mood. The show loves to shock. The ominous-ness (new word I made upÂ  Â ) of "Oathkeeper" will accentuate the surprise.

Â 
Apart from LS, this could also apply to the possibility of a Rickon appearance or Stannis declaring he'll march against the Boltons (unlikely to happen this season, though, and on that theme, moreover).
Â 
There is also still the possibility that Bran has a vision of all his siblings and that is the theme played over.

Â 

Â 
"The Wall is Yours" line will be in, I think but I wouldnt get my hopes high for the rest of the sentence. Wouldnt keep'em low, either, for all I know ! ^^
This is typically the kind of line that could make the cut.

I liked the beetle monologueÂ  Â  That line you quoted is very powerful, and I think we will get something very similar. Donal Noye wouldn't be included in it though, since he hasn't been mentioned on the show.

5774	Arkash	2014-06-07	Oh, guys, by the way, do we know if the actor who plays Rattleshirt came back for season 4 ?
Â 
He's the only notable wildling that's left with Mance. I hope he features in during the battle, if only to give Mance someone to talk to.
5775	Konradsmith	2014-06-07	^It would be nice and consistent if he featured in the ep., but I've heard nothing of the sort. I assume they could get the guy to come back for one appearance, after all they did for episode 301.
5776	Arkash	2014-06-07	^ Or even get a completely new actor beneath the Giant skull.
Â 
But the Lord of Bones is one of the most visuals characters of the saga, it would be a shame not to use him and he's the only one I can see Mance talking to during the attack. And I hope we get pov from his camp as well.
5777	Cake	2014-06-07	I feel like "The Children" could be used if there is a scene where Tyrion boards a boat away from King's Landing. To make it look like the final scene, but suddenly, there's the LS scene

I think The Children will be second to last before Oathkeeper, depending on how long that track is. They will want to have something creepy play over end titles not freaking Dany theme and I refuse to think they'd end the season with her again.

^ HAHAHAHAHAHA, your endless Stannis pics crack me up!!
Â 
Speaking of GRRM not spending time writing, I got an email from Amazon a few days ago, trumpeting a book called 'Rogues,' a collection of short stories by various authors including, dun-dun-dun, George R. R. Martin, whose contribution to the book is described as:Â  'And George R. R. Martin himself offers a brand-new A Game of Thrones tale chronicling one of the biggest rogues in the entire history of Ice and Fire.'

All these posts and interviews scare me sometimes. I know it must feel amazing to be so famous and he must be very proud, but sometimes he takes it too far and it seems as if he has lost focus on his goal, and what made him so loved in the first place; his books. I think that he doesn't need any more publicity.Â  Â It does make sense that he would be excited for the show though, seeing as he's the one who made it all up.

^ I will spread this around / show this every Unsullied I know, after this episode 
Oh, and this:
"The series title reminds us constantly that the real issue lies in the North beyond the Wall. Stannis becomes one of the few characters fully to understand that, which is why in spite of everything he is a righteous man" -George R. R. Martin

5821	ToTheWolves	2014-06-08	Title: The Watchers on the Wall
Runtime: 51 minutes
Written by: David Benioff and Dan Weiss
Directed by: Neil Marshall
TVMA: Adult Content, Adult Language, Graphic Content
Official Synopsis: Jon Snow and the Night's Watch face a big challenge.
Official Promo: https://www.youtube....h?v=Mo9AmIbob1c, https://www.youtube....eature=youtu.be
Official Recap: https://www.youtube....h?v=FmQuzhNlyl4
Â 
NOTES: I will update this post throughout the week as I learn new information. The following is my own personal speculation based on what I've seen from the trailers and promos, what I have heard from other sources and read from the source material.
Â 
---
This will go a little different than the usual speculation threads, since only one storyline is featured in this episode. Yes, the entire hour is centered around the events at the Wall. No Tyrion awaiting his execution, no Arya or Dany or Brienne - just Jon Snow, Sam, Ygritte, Gilly, Mance Rayder and Stannis fucking Baratheon entangled in one huge spectacle.
Â 
The battle will be comprised of three smaller battles, according to director Neil Marshall. I assume they are: 1) Tormund's group and the Thenns assaulting Castle Black from the south, 2) Mance's army besieging the Wall from the North, and 3) Stannis' forces charging down and routing the wildling host.
Â 
The first two parts will apparently take place entirely over one night (and the third part the following morning), though in the book they occurred over several nights and days. I get it: the darkness is easy on the budget (that's why they had the Battle of Blackwater take place at night as well), but I would really like to see a daytime battle at SOME point in the series' run. Anyway...
Â 
Pre-fight: We'll get some scenes of the various parties preparing for the battle. Definitely one with Ygritte and company at a camp fire, in which the Thenn warg uses his owl to witness Mance's signal and lets the group know that "it's time." Apparently, a scene between Jon and Sam on top of the Wall while they're on patrol. A scene where a Night's Watchman blows the horn for wildlings. Another one with Ser Alliser Thorne giving a grand speech to rouse the Night's Watch. Hopefully, we'll get something with Mance.
Â 
Attack from the South: During the night, Tormund, Ygritte, Styr and the Thenns will raid Castle Black. There's shots in the trailers of them running down a trail towards the gates while taking arrow fire, shots of them climbing over the front gate, and several shots of them fighting the Night's Watchmen throughout the castle, in the yard and on the catwalks, including a fight between Jon and Styr. It looks like there will also be some fighting on the elevator platform. In the books, Ygritte dies while storming the castle, so naturally I'm going to assume she meets a similar fate on screen. It's pretty likely that the orphan boy Olly will be the one to kill her. Apparently, Pyp will get an arrow through the neck himself (and probably die from it), and apparently it comes from Ygritte. A new addition (not from the books) is a battle between Tormund and Alliser. I say Tormund will win, because I can't believe he was upgraded to regular status only to be quickly killed off, but I wonder if Alliser survives (I doubt it; his leadership during the battle would make it really hard for Jon to win the following election fairly). At some point, there will be a scene in the tunnel under the Wall, in which some black brothers fight off a giant who is trying to break down the inner gate. I expect Grenn will take over Donal Noye's role in the novel by slaying, and being slayed by, the mighty giant.
Â 
Attack from the North: In the book, this part follows the failed attack from the south, but I believe the two battles will take place simultaneously on the show, and will be intercut. This would mean Jon won't be up on top of the Wall to lead the men, unfortunately. Jon IS up on top at some point, though (and in that shot, there is a scarecrow behind him - it looks like those are in!). He sees Mance's signal (the Haunted Forest on fire, or a sea of torches?) from the parapets, but I assume he eventually goes down to fight in the yard after giving some orders. There are several shots in the trailers of wildlings and even a mammoth marching through the trees and grouping up for a mass battle cry in front of the Haunted Forest. We haven't seen a lot of footage from the actual attack in the promotional videos, though. A few shots of archers loosing arrows down at the approaching horde, some leaning too far out and some falling, while the battlements around them explode into splinters. Down below, we see some wildlings running towards the Wall and the ones reaching it being thrown back by a blast, apparently from barrels thrown down from up above. Also, some sort of explosion near the gate causing the mammoth to turn around and start trampling some wildlings (I knew Neil couldn't resist!).
Â 
Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!: I'm guessing Janos sends Jon to treat with Mance. There is a trailer shot of a distressed Mance running around his camp and many of Stannis' cavalry running down the confused and disorganized wildlings. There are shots in the trailers of Jon riding inside the ice tunnel of the Wall; this could be him going to see Mance, but it could just as easily be something else cut from earlier in the season. There is an extra shot of Jon in the tunnel, with Sam holding a torch and looking morose. This could be Sam accompanying Jon on his way to Mance, briefly looking at the remains of Grenn and the giant, or it could be them welcoming Stannis to Castle Black, although I think that will happen in episode ten.
Â 
Loose Ends: Will we see Stannis during his charge? I hope so. I want a brave, heroic Stannis moment. Will we see Davos during the battle or not until the finale? Melisandre lighting Orell's eagle on fire? I assume the eagle will come back into play during the battle (why else have it get away alive last season?). What does Sam do during the battle? He WILL reunite with Gilly, but I'm not sure if this happens in episode nine or ten. We see him in the promo running around with a crossbow. Maybe he kills somebody? According to an interview, one of the major deaths this season was filmed to be in slow-motion. It wasn't Lysa or Oberyn, and I hope it isn't Tywin, so I'm going to assume it will be Ygritte or Pyp. In the trailers, there are several more shots I didn't discuss above. There was a scene in the Foreshadowing video of Sam and Jon discussing Ygritte; this could be a scene from the pre-battle section of this episode, or it could have been cut from an earlier episode or be from the season finale. Finally, there is a shot of a bunch of burning men around a burning man getting dragged through the snow by a rope. If it wasn't for the snow, I would think this was the dragons getting chained up. It still could be, if their intention was to replace the snow with sand in post-production. If not, what could it be? Some sort of trap or the mammoth dragging them?
Â

Â 
In summation: should be awesome... very, very awesome. Ygritte's death, Alliser v. Tormund, giants and mammoths and STANNIS!
Â 
What do you guys think? Anything to add?

Anything on ghost?
5822	igrewupinKL	2014-06-08	i think Tormund will go to treat with Jon with Mance. If he lives, how else will he get on the other side of the wall?
5823	sati	2014-06-08	For me, too 
But I'm looking forward to the reactions of the Americans and other people with HBO (And I'm glad for them  Even I envy these guys).

If you'll be curious about Stannis moment just get on my twitter in 12,5h - there will be meltdown there and if it's happy it means they did a good job with his big moment

I truly think he will have his moment in S5...I'm not sure TV viewers care enough about the Wall (warning: huge generalization), so I'm not sure I anticipate unsullied liking him right away. Heck, I didn't even like him right away... it took ADWD exploits to fully convince me, and of course GRRM saying Stannis was the closest thing to a hero remaining in the books

Well this is his first huge fuck yeah moment in the show so the Unsullied I know will see. They will finally see ;P

Here's hoping, my friend!  D&D started Sansa down a different path, and Tyrion too, so there's hope for the Mannis!
5827	sj4iy	2014-06-08	Â 
iv been hoping to see Slynt die since he betrayed Ned in the Throne roomÂ  
i didnt think about that...but you might be right....just seemed suspicious to me

Next season for sure.  There's just too much left at the Wall this season to work that in, but it will be a great 'first test' after Jon becomes LC next season.

I'll also be manically checking the "Episode discussion" thread as I can't watch it until tomorrow.
5829	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I wish this episode was longer. The past 3 episodes have been so awesome, but have ended so quickly. And now this too...


Â 
Well, those episodes jumped around. Â This will be full on Wall with nobody else...so I'm not disappointed.
Â 
Although I would always gladly take more GoT over less ^^
5830	SoManyVows	2014-06-08	Anything on ghost?


Â 
In the French promo for the episode, there is a very brief, blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot of Ghost leaping across the screen and killing a wildling (I'm not sure if the link will work, but if it does, it's around 0:40 - https://www.youtube....h?v=3h01fkqQTf0). I think it's safe to say that he'll be let out of his cage for battle.

Thanks for sharing.  The music they were playing sounded like it's the same they used in the Dracarys episode last season.
5834	Neumond	2014-06-08	It looks amazing. Like a trailer of a whole movie... I canÂ´t wait.
After the last episode my Unsullied where discussing whether Tyrion will die now. I did nothing to appease them. Actually they now think he will die for sure. And it is telling that I even didnÂ´t have to say anything for them being convinced of his death. But I (with some of the board discussions in mind) tried to get them thinking about the wall-storyline. They just said: How can you think of this now? That is totally boring! Aside from the Zombies nothing interesting ever happened there.
I am so eager to see their reaction to the episode!
And to Tyrions survival in the next one .
5835	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-08	Now that I think about it this episode may be pretty devastating to the Unsullied lol. Â First Oberyn, then the lovely couple get split up in a tragic way. Â Kind of reminds me of how in Season 1 Ned Stark lost his head in King's Landing, then we lost Drogo.
5836	Cold Feet	2014-06-08	Personally I wouldn't be that bent out of shape if they cut the chant as he's riding in. As long as him & his army come out of nowhere & you can clearly tell it's Stannis, I'd be happy as hell. Most people aren't going to expect to see Stannis & an army in an episode that's 100% on the wall. It will be incredible with or without the chanting.
5837	Arkash	2014-06-08	Anything on ghost?


Â 
Nothing official and not a glimpse in the preview, but I wouldnt worry at all for Ghost.
Â 
I'd bet they were still working on the CGI two weeks ago so we still have some surprises in reserve not shown by the previews.
Â 
And we have seen there will be wolves during the episode. Why show wolves and not Ghost during the episode, especially since he and Summer are the two most important direwolves. Now, the question is : are the CGI good enough to give us a shot of Jon and Ghost fighting together side by side ? Or will we just see him attacking just in brief shots ?
5838	FNF	2014-06-08	The trumpets need to stay in imo. Just to give the Unsullied a bit of a shock like "that's not a northern war horn!".
5839	aFeastForDragons	2014-06-08	"Stannis, Stannis, Stannis!"
5840	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-06-08	Well summarized, Ignorant Bog Woman! The only thing I'd add is that due to the voice-over on the promo, there'll be at least one scene with my favourite Maester 
My speculation is that it occurs after Ygritte's death, but it could be used as foreshadowing, too. Aemon says that, and then boom! Buh bye Gritte-zy!


Â Yes, I will be quite disappointed if we go through this entire episode without any Aemon!
5841	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-08	8 hours left, guys! http://www.gameofthronescountdown.com
5842	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I will not be disappointed by any changes they make- I just want to see this finally happen
5843	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-08	Â 
If you'll be curious about Stannis moment just get on my twitter in 12,5h - there will be meltdown there and if it's happy it means they did a good job with his big moment 

Yes, for sure! That's definitely one of the first things I'll do after the episode! I'm looking forward to all the new 4x09 stuff on your websites soon (and your Review tomorrow  Always love your reviews).
I hope so much they'll give you and us all awesome badass Stannis stuff, so you can make maaany new gifs.
5844	OnlyOne	2014-06-08	I'm not a big Stannis fan and honestly I cannot believe so many people are die hard Stannis fans. Yes, Stannis will save the wall in a triumphant fashion...try to retake the North, etc...I'm glad for those things, but I really dislike him.

Â 
I find it funny that so many people want this episode just for the Stannis moment, something that will take up all of a couple of minutes as most at the very end. Â Personally, I'm more interested in seeing how the battle plays out, seeing who dies and seeing if Jon Snow has his big moment as a leader of the Night's Watch. Â All of those are more important than Stannis' men charging and wiping out the Wildlings by surprise. I can already see the outrage that will flow in this forum if we don't get the 'chant' at the end, even if the rest of the episode is spectacular.

5846	Cake	2014-06-08	Since this is the 9th episode of the season, many people believe that Jon will die, and that the thenns eat every crow at the wallÂ 
Â 
Even people who remember that Stannis once said that he was going to the wall believes that he will either be too late, or arrive at the southern side of the wall.Â 
Â 
I have a feeling that after they see a good thing happening in the 9th episode, many of them will stop believing that Tyrion will die in episode 10Â

Actually, I think they would be more apt to believe that because something good happened at the Wall, that means something horrible will happen to Tyrion XDÂ
5848	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-08	"WAAAAAH! IT FELT RUSHED! THEY DESTROYED HIS MOMENT! HE DIDN'T SLAUGHTER 1.000.000 GIANTS BY HIS OWN!!! RAAAAGE!!!!" 
Really, I don't expect too much. As long as I get a great badass shot of him at the end, and they do him and this moment justice, I'll be very, very happy! (I won't whine about the cutted chant or somerthing)
And I'm not ONlY looking forward to this episode because of the very few Stannis minutes/seconds, I'm also looking extremely forward to see Jon being the great leader, and the awesome battles generally, many minor characters having (hopefully) their moments, the giants, mammoth, wolves (Ghost!), I'm very excited about Jon/Mance... Really, this episode is going to have many brilliant things!
5849	sati	2014-06-08	Yes, for sure! That's definitely one of the first things I'll do after the episode! I'm looking forward to all the new 4x09 stuff on your websites soon (and your Review tomorrow  Always love your reviews).

I may only have enough footage for one gif  Don't know what the hell I'll do with my Stannis per ep thing, probably just make the gif really big ^^

Â 
Well that is your opinion. I just care about the Stannis moment even if it's a second of him on screen. I like Jon Snow this season but it's all about Stannis for me. I don't care if they don't include the chant as long as they do the justice to the scene - because if he didn't come they would all be dead meat. And if they don't I'll hate the episode. I don't care about how awesome it will be, I always found the endings important and this is a moment I've been looking forward to seeing for a long time. It all hangs on that for me, much like LS in finale, but they still have Tyrion's last ASOS chapter there which is my fav, so I think I'll like the finale either way.

it's just a really big moment for him in the books and marks the turning point of his storyline. I'm actually more interested in what happens in episode 10 when he settles in at the Wall and starts to appraise the situation. Â He has been so isolated up to this point and focussed on HIS issues (in both books and show), that it will be good to see him change his focus.
Â 
Â 
But I absolutely love these big GoT setpieces. They've all been spot on so far so this should be brilliant too, especially as they have a bigger budget now compared to Blackwater.
Â 
There will be so much rage if there is no chanting but I don't know will it work as well on TV if you can actually see him. Â In the books Jon is looking out and wondering who the troops belong to and only realises who it is when he hears the name. Â I would much rather SEE him, though if he's charging in with his troops chanting behind him then that would also be acceptable to meÂ

I'm don't mind that people want to see Stannis, I do, too...I just have seen some people building up the chant like they did 'Only Cat', when really, the words are not as important as what's going on.
5853	iheartseverus	2014-06-08	I'm still wondering who will be the slo-mo death we heard about, and whether it'll be Ygritte in this episode.Â  Is this episode being directed by the director who likes to use slo-mo?Â  *Calling KonradSmith!*Â  (Looks around, where is he??!!Â  He always knows this stuff...)

Â 
Yeah Neil Marshall used slow-mo in Blackwater and has used it in some of his movies so I expect it'll be Ygritte's death tonight.
5856	Arkash	2014-06-08	Personally, I'm more interested in seeing how the battle plays out
Â 

Â 
What I most want to see this episode :
- Quiet moment of talk in all the three groups before the attack.
- Archers and scarecrows top of the Wall.
- Giant attack on the tunnels.
- Jon and Ghost fighting together.
- Ygritte's last words and Kit Harrington acting at this moment.
- Jon and Styr duel.
- Thorne and Tormund duel.
- Slynt being a pain in the ass.
- Mance and Jon meeting.
- The charge and Jon / Stannis meeting to end the episode.
Â 
Aaaand... I realize that's pretty much the entire episode ! ^^
So excited !
5857	Rashtibram	2014-06-08	I very much hope Stannis' rescue is given the screentime it deserves, rather than ending the moment you see his face. There should be a real battle, with Stannis at the forefront. This, I think, is a lot more important than a cliched chant.
5858	Mark Antony	2014-06-08	Why is a chant cliched?
5859	The Onion Sleight	2014-06-08	I very much hope Stannis' rescue is given the screentime it deserves, rather than ending the moment you see his face. There should be a real battle, with Stannis at the forefront. This, I think, is a lot more important than a cliched chant.

Well, they / Neil Marshall promised us "3 battles", not 2,5 or 2 1/4 battles.
So, I guess we'll get three, indeed (even two happen more or less at the same time, and one very short at the end... But nevertheless 3).
5860	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-06-08	I very much hope Stannis' rescue is given the screentime it deserves, rather than ending the moment you see his face. There should be a real battle, with Stannis at the forefront. This, I think, is a lot more important than a cliched chant.


Â 
I agree with this. I also suspect they're going to add another reivindicative factor by him refusing to use Shireen, as had been implied during Mel and Selyse's chat, showing that he's not a crazy fanatic like the others. It should be something like 'I won't sacrifice my own daughter for your god. If I am to be king it will be fighting' sort of thing. In that way Melissandre's presence there may not be seen as gravitating as it is for many. Well, that's my hope anyway...
Â 
As for the Stannis! chant, it'd be cool if they kept it, but it's not that important. If they show Jon's seeing the Baratheon banner and saying 'Stannis' and then Stan The Man leading the charge and the wildlings pissing their pants, I'm happy.
Â 
ETA: the soundtrack preview. You Are No Son of Mine, even that little bit, sounds so dramatic and promising! I can't wait for that moment.

5861	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	Sorry, iheartseverus, I was asleep and couldn't swoop in sooner with an answer on the slow-mo front.
Â 
I don't know specifically which director the scene would be in, but I assume Neil Marshall since he used slow-mo before pretty prominently in Blackwater. Since Ygritte's is the biggest death I'd go with her too. But then who knows, it could be Alex Graves as well. If it is I'm going to guess Tywin because in terms of power shifts and whatnot that'll be the biggest death of the season and might need extra epicness to sink the point home. Then, if he indeed is sitting on the crapper as it happens, we might not want to see what happens any slower than it ought to be.
5862	sati	2014-06-08	I'm don't mind that people want to see Stannis, I do, too...I just have seen some people building up the chant like they did 'Only Cat', when really, the words are not as important as what's going on.


I found Only Cat change to be awful because it's essentially writers dumbing down the line because they think the audience is a bunch of utter morons who don't know who Cat is

Wow ! The charge will be epic ! I loved seing Mance reacting to it, drawing his sword and watching what the hell is happening.
Â 
I doubt Mance will have a tent. The meeting with Jon (and Sam) will take place in the open, I think. Jon is probably right behind Mance in that shot we see of him.

5869	Arkash	2014-06-08	^ Had the same reaction.
Â 
I stand corrected on what I just said above, Jon is definitly not in that shot with Mance.
Â 
This makes me worrying that their talk will be cut, since I dont see where in the episode Mance could be fighting other than Stannis charge. Moreover this shot is in the morning so it is definitly Stannis charge. But Jon should be somewhere around !

I'm sure they'll have the talk and Jon is somewhere there, they can't really cut it out or just have Jon there about to talk to Mace and then the one true God arrives
5871	Arkash	2014-06-08	I wonder what show!Jon reaction will be when the trumpets starts. In the book he returns inside the tent, but this will surely be different in the show. Mance will probably react quickly as we see in the preview and face the cavalry but will Jon tries to capture him ? Will he prepare himself to fight this new foe ? Will he stay blatantly doing nothing ? Will he try to protect the eventual extra playing Mance's pregnant wife (doubt it) ? Will he kill Rattleshirt ? ...

I find it funny that so many people want this episode just for the Stannis moment, something that will take up all of a couple of minutes as most at the very end. Â Personally, I'm more interested in seeing how the battle plays out, seeing who dies and seeing if Jon Snow has his big moment as a leader of the Night's Watch. Â All of those are more important than Stannis' men charging and wiping out the Wildlings by surprise. I can already see the outrage that will flow in this forum if we don't get the 'chant' at the end, even if the rest of the episode is spectacular.seriously. I feel like D&D "disrespect" for Stannis has done more to raise his stature than anything that happened the book.

This. I don't see how that particular fan would have access to material not yet released in trailers/promos. It's far more likely that they just used trumpet/cavalry sound effects from somewhere else to generate hype.

5882	sj4iy	2014-06-08	I found Only Cat change to be awful because it's essentially writers dumbing down the line because they think the audience is a bunch of utter morons who don't know who Cat is


Â 
I'm sorry, but changing "Only Cat" to "Your sister" isn't dumbing down anything. Â It's just a change in dialogue that means the exact same thing. Â The only people who cared about that in the first place are those who hang around these forums and build up words and phrases to have more meaning than they were ever meant to have originally. Â Go off these forums, and I guarantee you people will look at you funny if you say "Only Cat".
Â 
I'm just worried that people will do the same thing to the "Stannis!" chant. Â I don't really care what they do or say as long as the action is still there and still awesome.
5883	Mark Antony	2014-06-08	It was a pointless change imo. Some book readers are more attached to the source material than you are clearly. Its great that you don't care but like I said before if they leave out the Stannis chant I probably will be a little disapointed. It won't ruin the episode or anything (I greatly enjoyed the "Only Cat" scene while still being ticked off they changed an iconic line for no reason at all) but I'll still probably bitch about it in the nitpicking thread 
And that's bullshit about these forums being the only place people complained about Only Cat.

5886	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-06-08	As Ignorant Bog Woman said in the first post, there will probably be a mammoth in this episode. I hope she's right. But I don't know will there be a reappearance of Orell's eagle. I would like to see Thenn warg screaming after his owl takes a taste of Melisandre's flame. We really might expect the death's of Pyp (from Ygritte's arrow), Grenn (from the giant) and Alliser Thorne (Tormund kills him in one on one duel). I think Tormund will survive the battle, probably because something will fall upon his head and knock him down. And, when he wakes up, surprise! He's in chains.

Â "Only Cat" confused the hell out of me when I came on this forum and my husband had no idea what I was talking about (and he's read the books since they came out). Â I talked about it with people who have read the books and watch the show and they had absolutely no clue that it was even and issue. Â It was an insignificant line that was made significant by a few fans and then became a meme of sorts. Â The show runners shouldn't feel compelled to hold to something simply because a few fans think it should be that way if they feel something different works better.Â Anyway, I won't hijack this thread about something that has nothing to do with this subject, especially when it's already been beaten to death in other threads.Â And no, I don't really get upset by minor changes...hell, most of the time major changes don't bother me, either, as long as they work in the show (or movie). I never start watching an episode of GoT with expectations of certain things needing to happen for me to like it...I know the general framework, but I love when they deviate from what I know because that's what makes it exciting.All I want out of this episode is an exciting battle and some great spectacle...both of which we have had very little of this entire season. I think it will be great, no matter what they do, and I love the prospect of people unexpectedly dying or things from the book unexpectedly changing. Maybe that makes me different from some book readers in this forum, but it's just a show and it's just a book...I don't take them very seriously to begin with.

Â As excited as I am for this (and believe me, excited I am), there's a small part of me thats almost more excited to see the 30 seconds or so previewing "The Children" after the credits roll. I've been too ungodly stoked on that episode since before I knew what it was called. Â So much excite.


Â 
Absolutely! Ever since they announced the split of ASOS over season 3 and 4 I've been waiting for ep. 4.10. And just yesterday I found out that I'll be working 9 pm to 5 am on Sunday/Monday. The Gods are cruelÂ  
Â 


Anything on ghost?


Â 
We see a huge wolf jumping somebody in the promo. He looks sort of greyish there, but promos are usually darker than the actual episode. Also, at night all cats/wolves are grey.
Â 


Â 
Nothing official and not a glimpse in the preview, but I wouldnt worry at all for Ghost.
Â 
I'd bet they were still working on the CGI two weeks ago so we still have some surprises in reserve not shown by the previews.
Â 
And we have seen there will be wolves during the episode. Why show wolves and not Ghost during the episode, especially since he and Summer are the two most important direwolves. Now, the question is : are the CGI good enough to give us a shot of Jon and Ghost fighting together side by side ? Or will we just see him attacking just in brief shots ?


Â 
I think that wolf IS Ghost. See my argument above.
Â 


I'm not a big Stannis fan and honestly I cannot believe so many people are die hard Stannis fans. Yes, Stannis will save the wall in a triumphant fashion...try to retake the North, etc...I'm glad for those things, but I really dislike him.


Â 
Agreed. I'll never understand the StanStans. Then again, most people think I'm crazy when I tell them that my favourite characters include Baelish, Cersei and Melisandre...Â  
Â 


Â 
I find it funny that so many people want this episode just for the Stannis moment, something that will take up all of a couple of minutes as most at the very end. Â Personally, I'm more interested in seeing how the battle plays out, seeing who dies and seeing if Jon Snow has his big moment as a leader of the Night's Watch. Â All of those are more important than Stannis' men charging and wiping out the Wildlings by surprise. I can already see the outrage that will flow in this forum if we don't get the 'chant' at the end, even if the rest of the episode is spectacular.


Â 
Absolutely. There is going to be so much wonderful stuff in this episode and 'Stannis to the rescue' is only a very small part of it. Regardless of what happened though, this episode will be nitpicked to death. Just look at what happened with the duel last week:
Â 
Oberyn being awesome - check
Mountain being huge and insanely strong - check
Oberyn screaming "Elia - you raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children" - check
Mountain correcting his order of events - check
Oberyn nearly winning - check
Mountain killing him in gruesome fashion - check
awesome reactions from all the other characters - check
Â 
And what was the reaction here on this forum?
Â 
Too many cuts - they ruined it.
Oberyn screamed like a bitch - they ruined it.
Tyrion didn't throw up or laugh - they ruined it.
Â 
Seriously, I've given up on some of the people on this forum. I actually feel sorry for them because no matter how good the episodes will be, they will always find something to be unsatisfied with. Sad, really.
Â 


Â 
What I most want to see this episode :
[1] Quiet moment of talk in all the three groups before the attack.
[2] Archers and scarecrows top of the Wall.
[3] Giant attack on the tunnels.
[4] Jon and Ghost fighting together.
[5] Ygritte's last words and Kit Harrington acting at this moment.
[6] Jon and Styr duel.
[7] Thorne and Tormund duel.
[8] Slynt being a pain in the ass.
[9] Mance and Jon meeting.
[10] The charge and Jon / Stannis meeting to end the episode.


Â 
1) Can't imagine that they'll not have that. Just look at how much of that they had for Blackwater.
2) Confirmed by the promo videos and stills.
3) Confirmed by the promo videos.
4) I think we've seen Ghost in the French promo. Don't know if he'll be fighting side-by-side with Jon, though.
5) The recap made sure to remind us of their relationship, so no worries 
6) Confirmed by the promo. If it's anything like his duel with Karl fookin Tanner, it will be great.
7) Not sure, but I think there were shots of it in the promo.
8) He's Slynt. How could he not be an ass?
9) Will most likely deviate quite a bit from the books (I doubt they'll introduce Val and Dalla yet).
10) The charge will definitely be in and looks awesome (judging from the promo). Not sure if Stannis and Jon will meet/talk in this ep. though.
Â

But is it only me who actually hopes that Alliser Thorne doesn't die? I mean, in the books he's still there in aDwD, in fact, Jon sends him over the wall, and he promises to return or something... I don't know if that will turn out to be important, but it was cool seeing Jon getting rid of him and Slynt when becoming LC. I hope they keep it, and not just kill Alliser Thorne in this ep.
5916	sati	2014-06-08	I post threads similar to this one on IMDb, since episode three of this season:
http://www.imdb.com/.../nest/230470394
http://www.imdb.com/.../nest/230703702
Â 
I maintain a Stannis appreciation thread, inspired by a thread I found on here a while back:http://www.imdb.com/...t/226496905?p=1
Â 
And I'm starting to post outlines for season five:http://www.imdb.com/.../nest/230177911
http://www.imdb.com/.../nest/230757680
Â 
Too bad none of that gets as much attention as the "OT: Sophie's new hair" and "OT: how's your foreplay" threads. 


Â 
Well I imagine it's hard to compete with Dany's diarrhea threads

5918	Konradsmith	2014-06-08	The loopiness of imdb can be pretty great though. I just clicked on a thread now there called "the Viper lost because" and what did the guy say? Pride? Overconfidence? Nope, the guy said, "He gave up on the gravy, you CANNOT give up on the gravy."
Â 
Some of the trolls there actually come up with decent satire too.

Â 
I think they will want to make everything as quick and mindblowing as possible, so Mace will probably just run off somewhere and Jon will be standing there, stunned

That's fucking brilliant
5920	Arkash	2014-06-08	Hey guys! I've seen that many people are expecting to see Tormund killing Thorne, or at least leaving him fatally wounded, so that he passes the Wall to Jon.Â 
Â 
But is it only me who actually hopes that Alliser Thorne doesn't die? I mean, in the books he's still there in aDwD, in fact, Jon sends him over the wall, and he promises to return or something...

Â 
Yeah, but seing the reduced cast of the NW, they dont have any Denys Malliser or Cotter Pyke to be real contenders for the election. Or even Hobb or whoever else presented himself.
Â 
There we have only Thorne and Slynt. Thorne is already acting commander and if he survives he should normally stay in command. Especially with Stannis demanding someone to really lead them quickly.
Â 
Though, they could always have Thorne survive and still be commander at the end of the season and have the election brought next season but that's a shame considering all the material Jon has in Dance (reread all his chapters today, they are awesome !).Â 
Â 
The election needs to happen in the finale, and with Thorne living there would be no election. So I think and somehow hope that he dies heroically during the battle.Â 
Â 
That would leave only Slynt as an opposant to Jon and seing how he is hated and how much Jon did during the battle, Jon will be easily elected, allowing the series to continue on other material next season.

Â 
Yeah, I guess you're right! I agree with you that Jon should end this season as LC. I'll just hope they manage to build this up without killing Thorne. However, if that's the price for having a cool development for the elections, and a badass Jon Snow in season 5, I'll totally let Ser Alliser dieÂ
5923	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-06-08	I hope so very much than Stannis kills a giant. I'd forgive everything about show Stannis if he kills a giant. 
Hopefully we get the trumpets and Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!!!!
Edit: I now know trumpets are confirmed. 
This is probably my favourite scene in the books. When I first read them, and this happened, I was genuinely "fuck yeah" as I'm pretty sure it's the first good thing to happen to anybody in the entire series.

5931	siknes	2014-06-08	The LC vote would get more justice next season.
Stannis demands it, so heÂ only has to deal with the real LC.Â 
Bran is part of the Tree, and takes over BR's role of warging the CrowÂ out of the pot or what ever it was holding the slips of paper, screaming, "Snow, Snow, Snow." Although for time sake there will be only one vote most likely.

This will probably be after they have the Dalia bloody birth scene, and intro of Val.Â

In some ways the off-season is the on-season. At least when it comes to speculating and whatnot.

As stated previously, this is pretty clearly a fan-edit compiling all the footage of the battle we've seen from various trailers (the "OCS Lundi" image wouldn't be there in select clips otherwise). The trumpets are probably from some other source (movie, sound effect, etc). I don't think there's any actual new footage in it to suggest otherwise.
5960	ToTheWolves	2014-06-08	Let's do this!!!
5961	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-06-08	Wow. Well, LC election definitely isn't making it.
5962	OnlyOne	2014-06-08	Â 
I find it funny that so many people want this episode just for the Stannis moment, something that will take up all of a couple of minutes as most at the very end. Â Personally, I'm more interested in seeing how the battle plays out, seeing who dies and seeing if Jon Snow has his big moment as a leader of the Night's Watch. Â All of those are more important than Stannis' men charging and wiping out the Wildlings by surprise. I can already see the outrage that will flow in this forum if we don't get the 'chant' at the end, even if the rest of the episode is spectacular.

I have been very vocal about the fact that I'm not a Stannis fan. This battle scene was very anticlimactic for me. I don't know where you get 'spectacular' from but hey...if you liked it...great. One mammoth, two giants and not a whole lot of wildings. Extremely disappointing.

I just can't imagine them killing all of pyp, grenn, and Thorne.there would be so few characters at the wall.


...
i think that was the point. it sucks. i liked those guys, but they need to trim the number of characters. jon doesnt even really interact with any of them in adwd, so it probably doesnt matter too much in the long run. at least we got some good scenes with them.
5964	Lord Carson	2014-06-08	To be honest, I don't think Grenn will be back from Hardhome, so at least he got a cool death! But the killing of Grenn and Pyp makes me lean slightly more toward Val being cast...if the gods are kind, they'll hear my prayers, PLEASE GIVE ME VAL!Â  Â
5965	ladyinblack	2014-06-08	THIS WAS ALL AROUND AWFULÂ Â  with plenty of good story and characters to work with....but D and D didn'tÂ Â Â  and it shows
pathetic
5966	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-06-08	FFS, Thorne isn't dead. He took a bad wound and was dragged off the battlefield giving commands. Pyp and Grenn dying sucked though. Who else thought all those extended late shots of Grenn would result in him waking up? I was truly stunned when he didn't.
5967	Dildo_Baggins	2014-06-09	And when i doubted the arrival of Stannis this episode i got bashed for it.........Another week of Â waiting!Â
