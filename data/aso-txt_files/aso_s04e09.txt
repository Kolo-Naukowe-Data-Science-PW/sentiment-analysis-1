"A Man Reads",2014-06-08,"but    but    stannisâ â we had 20 minutes of dialogue followed by 20 minutes of fighting followed by 510 minutes of tormund husband of bear in chains and jons mission i had hoped they would cover more ground tonight â the fight scenes were very well done lots of great camera work and it was well coordinated aliser thorne tormund ygritte jon and grenn had strong episodes i suppose the cgi money went into giants ghosts scene was quite limited the dialogue was noticeably lagging though â it felt like they were halfway between a movie and tv show and forgot about the storyâ â 7 for now maybe revised on rewatch edited by a man reads 08 june 2014  0914 pm"

"Aldi_AA",2014-06-08,"5 no stannis they cant put him in the beginning of next ep thats bs he should have had his triumphant episode ending moment now its just gonna be a scene no one talks about because of all the other stuff that will happen in episode 10"
"Howling Mad",2014-06-08,"very good the adapted ygritte death scene was excellent making slynt out to be a coward was well done the attack at the gate good but not great however they missed once again when it comes to putting the direwolves on screen ghost should of had a more prominent role â â"
"Zman1863",2014-06-08,"i gave it a 9 it was close to a ten â i havent had many qualms with deaths for the show that dont happen in the books but grenn and pyp hurt even if they were both well done i also understand that grrm pretty much writes them out of adwd when jon goes all a commander cant hang with his boys my reading of that was to put them out of danger for whatever mayhem breaks out in castle black in the wake of jons assassination but maybe they wont figure into the story very much in the future even if they are aliveâ â my other criticism is maybe a pacing complaint the buildup might have lagged a bit in the beginning i loved the middle section with the initiation of the attacks but then it seemed to lag despite the action going on i think they might have tightened it im not sure it would have been enough time to have a jonmance scene and stanniss arrival but maybeâ â overall it was quite entertaining they do very well when they can focus an episode as occurred in blackwaterâ edited by zman1863 08 june 2014  0914 pm"
"Dave Grose",2014-06-08,"i thought this was a strong episode i hope neil is just their go to for battle episodes i loved the scythe great addition i thought the changes were actually beneficial in this episode but i dont particularly like jon walking out alone to meet with mance but lets hope its somewhat interesting i was really hoping to see a certain person i dont want to include spoilers but i really wanted to see the end of this battle like it occurred in the books but i understand the size and scope of such a thing in one episode whew im rambling good episode like a breath of fresh air after the previous episodes disappointments"
"darksellsword",2014-06-08,"it was a 10 for me if you cant give this episode a 10 then theres very little point to you watching the show because it was amazing  i hope people remember this is not a spoiler free thread and when things that you think should of happened in this episode happen in the next i hope you all will be big enough to come back here and raise your vote to a 10 edited by darksellsword 08 june 2014  0915 pm"
"Knight of Ashes",2014-06-08,"8 from me grenn i believe that qualifies as a good death if there is such a thing under those circumstances and pyp dying gave it that unpredictable feel and so did dolorous edd taking charge i kinda wish theyd deviated and have tv ygritte survive and be taken prisoner her death scene was rather generic and so was maester aemons i was a young man once speech but way to go sam"
"FalseKnight",2014-06-08,"it was absolutely perfect until they cut it off â i dont get it they set out to tell the story of the first night of the battle and set up the battle north of the wall they picked the natural break in the story"
"Lonely_Wolf",2014-06-08,"i loved the episode it was very well done for all those that say the ending was anticlimactic i say it was the opposite since his betrayal was dismissed earlier the show needed another way for jon to go to mance it was well written and it was very action packed i liked how they concentrated all their efforts on the wall in order to really highlight the importance of itâ â as for stannis coming to the rescue that would need a whole entire episode which im guessing would be next season i havent seen the preview for next week yet so im not sure â it was an adrenaline rush for me and very emotional towards the end very well executedâ â i gave it a 1010 â edit just saw the previewi guess its next week then edited by lonelywolf 08 june 2014  0931 pm"

"MegaMagick",2014-06-08,"god that sucked i know some people liked it but that sucked major battle 20 guys in the yard fighting a lot of guys on the wall standing around and looking no sense of urgency and the wildlings use the worst battle plan ever the attack consisted of 4 guys climbing the wall 1 mammoth 2 giants and maybe 5 or 6 guys storming the gate with them or poking the mammoths ass with their spears the guys on the wall killed more of their own than than mance did and mance actually breached the wall with that force are you kidding me this was all about the battle in the yard where the wildlings seem to slaughter the 20 men defending it over and over yig got 20 kills by herself ghost was totally wasted ghost vision quick shot of his mouth then a long shot of him eating apparently jon needed ghost to kill one wildling really badly thought sam was cheesy dont care if grenn or pip die gilly is still annoying and cant act the forward or backward role seems to be the wildling standard for fighting jon was ok and had a decent fight scene thought thorne was the best in the episode honestly just did not feel much emotion it felt bland cgi was decent nothing special really just kind of blah about the whole thing nothing really happened except a few secondary characters die who have no emotional attachment too on the show the cliffhanger i new was coming and i get it but that doesnt mean it works all that well one thing i really couldnt stand was the wildling line at no point did it look 100000 strong maybe 5000 which you know is fine but for most of the episode whenever they showed them they were standing there growling and snarling grrrrr grrrrrr harg snarl was the direction ok guys i need you to act like idiots and what are they growling at the men of the watch are 700 feet up they cant see your face you like ants to them and they probably can barely hear you some stood there snarling and got shot and about 10 seconds later after the third or 4th guy gets nailed they all act shocked and back up this was suppose to be bigger than the blackwater not even close not even in the ball park i give it 4 because jon and thorne were solid it had some solid cgi here and there but for the most part everything around them sucked low energy no emotion bad acting and that was not a battle is was friggin skirmish in the training yard i am glad some liked but it just did nothing for me this is episode 9 and that was boring â you pretty much summed it up for me at the end i was like really and it wasnt even about being a stannis fan for me the episode was just sort oflacklusterâ"

"BearQueen87",2014-06-09,"gave this one a 10 by the by although i do not consider it the best episode of the series its among the best and it really beautifully put together action and character beatsi admit i am shocked at the reaction from those who became wholly wedded to the idea that stannis was going to show up to save the day yall need to reread the books and consider why grrm decided to have the watch successfully hold off the wildlings for awhile before stanniss arrival it serves a very different purpose than when the lannistertyrell host saves kings landing at the last minute hint where does the credit go having stannis in the next episode is pretty accurate to rhythms of the novel in allowing jon and the watch to have the full weight of their sacrifices given some meaning rather than having it undercut by a johnnycomelately â thats a good point but that puts a lot of pressure on next weeks episode to give quite a bit of story condensing to get stannis there now means that they can spend more time on the final s4 arcs next week its a lot of story to put into one episode and i think thats where my biggest criticism is coming from right now"
"roxWolfox",2014-06-09,"you said it the pauses between the battle in the blackwater episode involved sansa tyrion cercei sandor characters the show has spent time fleshing out yes i completely agree with you on that point but if you look at this episode as a jon snow killing the boy and becoming a man journey it works perhaps not perfectly the action sequences were far more coherent and better executed in this episode than in blackwater overall i still liked the episode and kit harrington is finally beginning to look the part of jon snow cant wait for his and dillane scenes next season"

"Ser Creighton",2014-06-09,"this is what is my main problem for almost four years the wall didnt have its proper moment jons storyline was handled as it is almost secondary and this year it showed more than any other the supporting ensemble in any other subplot like bronn shae brienne and podrick in kl or missandei and greyworm in essos are all fleshed out wall characters simply werent there was something lacking in the characterization that would make this episode be as memorable as the blackwater wasâ â there was a moment of pure gold in cinematic way when the camera almost flowed through the courtyard focusing on each element of the battle but it was too short and not enough this wasnt nearly as epic as they made it sound i agree with most of that though they did more than one panning shot and on a couple of them people were not doing a whole a lot and that bothers the hell out of me blackwater went some 26 minutes before anyone died none of this stuff was filler in this case taking time to use pypar as a focal point for the fear many felt and as a way to understand how samwell was dealing with it and for showing us alliser thorne dealing with the tribulations of command and so on  theyre important when youre putting lives in jeopardy as theyre a way to reinforce whatever connections people may havenow that said had the writers done the smart thing and skipped the craster nonsense and left jon and co at castle black and given us more of a story about the tensions there about the people there maybe these pieces of characterization would have been stronger for some or maybe they wouldnt have needed so much of it though really i doubt they were going to make it 45 minutes of nonstop action i think leading up to the battle things were going pretty good i liked some of the quiet tension at castle black but did not care for the gilly scenes and although i have enjoyed aemon in the series what little of him there has been i thought that scene was unnecessary thought thorne was good too but as pointed out by others the well has been the second class citizen of the series and they have not developed a lot there with the characters and have wasted time on things like crasters then they go out and promote it as the most epic battle on tv ever seriously just shooting themselves in the foot as it goes the show goes like this tyrion and kl number 1 dany number 2 arya number 3 the wall 4th stannis 5th and when robb and cat were alive they were number 2 in the order of importance at no point have they ever put a lot of stock in the wall so as a viewer why should anyone invest season one episode 9 baelor the death of ned stark for fans who had not read the books this was the omg moment of omg moments season 2 episode 9 blackwater thats all you really need to say the opening shot blows up a fleet of ships with a giant green fireball dink was amazing season 3 episode 9 the rains of castamere its the red wedding the entire country was talking about this well at least inn the states season 4 episode 9 the watchers on the wall i now see why the title is so appropriate to this episode the death of pyp and grenn yes thee pyp and grenn and grenn got the honor of getting done off screen seriously i am not a die hard stan fan but it really could of used the arrival honestly i think casual fan probably saw jon go out the gate and was like i hope he dies so we dont have to waste any time up following this arc anymore because its so damn boring most of the time do you think anyone will speak about this episode the way they did about the other 3 and that was not in any way shape or form the greatest anything on tv ever that skirmish and thats what i call it because that is what it was lacked emotion energy action drama and investment and the barrel poking scene of all the pathetic things in the world to do or the giants at the gate how the hell do you drop 150 gallons of oil on top of them and they dont get burned at all the mammoth got burned and it was 30 ft away all the men got burned but the giants what was this the second miracle were they hatching dragons eggs you know its fine that jon says mance is just testing the watches defenses thats fine it was a horrible plan to test a defense but whatever but they hyped this up as like it was going to be a major battle sorry but i feel lied too and even a character on the show basically referred to it as probing not to mention the cliffhanger really what was that its not like he got stabbed or anything he is walking out a door by himself and its going to last all of a week not like anyone is going oh my god they killed off jon hes in next weeks episode preview honestly it felt pointless and to waste 2025 minutes trying to rush job some character development in the hopes of generating a connection with the general viewing public is a mistake and something they shoulld have been doing for the last 38 seasons sorry but i dont need extra shea scenes or theon getting fixed and tortured over and over i dont need to see ros developed for no reason at all while actual characters at the wall get shit for the better part of 4 years they develop pointless crap with non characters that most people dont give to shits about for years and ignore the wall really the god damn wall jon snow and the watch i know the first book is called a game of thrones but the actual series is not all about kings landing and tyrion the series is called a song of ice and fire they got no problem giving us the fire and thats great but jesus can i have a little ice in my god damn kool aid so i can get my inner jon snow and the watch fan boy on"

"igrewupinKL",2014-06-09,"i gave it a 9 â the episode itself was beautifully shot the wide panning shots were excellent and i enjoyed in one part of the episode how it followed the various characters in the fight at castle black the only thing about the shooting was that sometimes it was hard to tell who was wildling and who was nw however that couldnt really be avoided with night and only blackbrown colours â i enjoyed all the build up including sam struggling with the concept of love over duty and trying to find loopholes from the vow i as always loved the samaemon scene aemon nearly made me cry and im wondering whether theyll reveal who he was in love with however this scene probably wouldve been better placed in 4x08 when sam was upset over gilly in fact i think most of the samgilly scenes although character building and lovely couldve been shortened to finish off the battle this episode â the fighting was excellent i thought the people on top the wall could have been loosing more arrowsthe giants arrow was awesome when that guy went flyingâ â also i dont know about anyone else but i felt a bit sad when the two giants died â i thought ygrittes death scene was well executed those two sold it it didnt effect me as much in the books as it did on screen well done to kit by showing the type of emotion only jon would show if you think he shouldve been more upset by itno they were in the middle of a battle for christs sake he didnt have time jon has become what he became in the books a little cold and unemotional after the death as sam notices in the books hes not jon anymore â im so upset that pyp and grenn died i feel like the lack of exploration for characters on the wall affected this episode characters that couldve replaced grenn and pyp but their deaths did serve to bring balance to the deaths your favourite characters cant always live i really liked the ser aliser thorne redemption of sorts he also had some of the best lines â why didnt they show mance not many people unsullied who arent really into it like i am ie my family even remember who he was they really shouldve shown the 3 camps castle black tormund and mance â i think with a little more cuts here and there they could have finished this episode like blackwater with stannis riding in but now i think about it the attack on the wall is vastly more complicated and really needs 2 full episodes but were only going to get a maximum of 15 minutes more at the wall im a little concerned about the finale theres so much to cram in there that this episode wouldve been better had it ended with stannis â not a perfect 10 but very close edited by igrewupinkl 09 june 2014  0502 am"

"The Fourth Head",2014-06-09,"i voted 8 it was certainly the most entertaining episode of the season and i recognise the value of ending with jons decision to nobly walk out to his certain death but â its no blackwater because this episode was basically 50 minutes making the journey from were doomed to were doomed after maintaining the dread for 50 minutes the time was ripe for stannis to have his moment his blackwater revenge episode now all that atmosphere will be lost between now and next week and i for one will care that little bit less by separating that moment of dread for the entire nw from that moment of salvation now they will have to build it all again and during a ceasefire i doubt that will be possible â seriously if we get a 5 minute sojourn next week somewhere inbetween wrapping out heads around uncat brans hodoring the cotf tyrions wife backstory shaes death or tywins death to return to the wall it will be totally cramped for style oh btw jons in a tent and heres stannis on a horse end scene this week was the perfect moment for stannis newt week he will be a small fish in a big pond â â"

"Nictarion",2014-06-09,"a 9 from me though i suspect i many have liked it more if i hadnt read the novels for once they finally have an episode that is set solely in the one location and though id have preferred theyd done this with the red wedding episode which i still feel was an overhyped missed opportunity i think they did the right thing here the main problem with the episode for me is that it didnt surprise me ive had more grievances and nits with this season than any other but its developed through the last few episodes into something truly fine a real high water mark in the series and i expected this to be a strong episode in keeping with that rise in quality but without the punch of the last few episodes some reservations about pacing aside however it was very well handled i cant picture too many people going lower than an 8 because diversions from the novel sans nothing speech tormund injuring allister then being captured were actually minor and judicious the main change here is that jon sees ygritte being killed though along with the fact we see a lot of her in this episode this is actually for a change stronger than what was actually in the books we wont hear any more the lovely ygrittes sexy yorkshire tones and here she gets a proper sendoff among the character omissions though i still think rattleshirts could prove to be quite problematic later cest la vie â a few points of minor interest unconnected to my rating  ygrittes use of the word minge although its mostly used in england it is actually an old scottish word meaning drizzle so apparently westeros does have its equivalents to the cultural transactions between the old english and the scots also unrelatedly the first chapter for nonreaders sake after oberyns death is actually a dany chapter  i believe the one where she exiles jorah mormont  so although the chronology in the series is not exact theyve started following it a bit more closely than in the last few seasons i think before wasnt blackwater all in kl"

"ovis alba",2014-06-09,"just watched the ending again was not sure about it the first time but i actually like it and here is why  it puts more focus on the nightswatch because now it does matter that they managed to hold the castle themselves with stannis showing up it would very likely have seemes a lot like just him saving the day and the fact that the nightswatch really managed to stand against this first attack adds some credit to their importance  the viewers really have the feeling that all is lost now because it can settle in for a week it might have been just a little too similar to blackwater otherwise when it ends again with someone arriving by surprise that turns things around now instead the battle is pretty much over but hope is lost and it can stick with people for a while  i like that the scene of jon leaving to talk with mance stands a little more on its own now and is not squeezed in between two spectacular battles the scene back then when reading felt a little harry potterish to me i hope at least some people get what scene exactly i mean and i think ending it with him wandering of just sets up very nice tension for a big finale"

"mickyd",2014-06-09,"id only give it a 5 the episode was very entertaining and the battle scenes were awesome however being a reader of the books i am dissappointed in the overall structure of the episode and notâ just this one most of the scenes from the wall have been changed imo for the worst it all startedwith jon having to deal with the mutineers beyond the wall it was a plot line not derived from the books and imo that should have been relpaced that with the wildlings storming castle black from the south they could have then added the first siege from from notrh off the wall an episode or so earlier and then had another one this past episode plus jon going beyond the wall to treat with mance then the arrival of stannis at the end of the episode i think this could have added clarity to what all is happening up at the wall plus t would have freed some space to better explain what is going to happen is episode ten becasue from what i know they will need to cover a lot of plot points as well as leaving some out either for good or next season anyways this is only my opinion i love thrones and i love all 4 seasons but i think it coulda been better feel free to tear this apart or agree its all for the good of the real â perfectly said very entertaining â the acting has been superb and casting has been first rate and has been generally dario  from the start however in my â mind season 4 and the whole way the wall was handled in season 4 â has been the first sign that the producers may not be up to the taskâ to carry off this adaptation â though it might be beyond anyones considering the wealth and depth of the source materialâ so much useless made up bs earlier in the season and because of it we got a rushed battle compressed into one episode that lost its epic scope any attachment to the men fighting such odds though the episode sure failed in that a handful of men and a couple of giants and what could have and should have been the climax which was stannis arriving â even as little as 15 to 20 minutes of screen time earlier in the season in place of the made up tv scenes could have given the characters on the wall much more depth and an climax that didnt leave you unfulfilled â i love the books but felt nothing when grenn and pyp died â i had not attachment as a tv viewer to them i didnt even feel it for ygritte and her death in the books nearly brought a tear to these otherwise jaded eyes lolâ â i guess my point and overall fear is highlighted by this episode is that dd will not be able to be up to the task of next season when characters splinter to new different locations and new vital characters are will be right introduced â time will be mighty tight for all the established beloved characters with time needed for the new ones to be introduced and developed and for time make up to continue previous â dd plot inventionsdeviations â if episode 9 was rushed episode 10 willl exceed that by all they need to cover and season 5 might lap both in â"
"aovalle",2014-06-09,"edited for my score 510 â my rant the action of of it was pretty amazing but i felt like dd have been dragging this out far too long i had read about how season 4 was going to be the postrw to the end of book 3 okay but ive been discussing the end of the book events with my brother and friends and there is so much that has to happen that i dont think there will be enough time in the final episode for everything to happen dd could have done a lot better the episode where jon goes to crasters keep was very unnecessary and pointless it didnt do anything to add to the storyline i mean the battle of blackwater bay episode was its own episode they couldve had the wildings raid cb from the beginning and go from there and correct me if im wrong but wasnt there a whole battle with nw brothers and wildings protecting the gate i dont remember grenn dying and the fact that john going on his own to treat with mance is total bullshit he was basically forced to do it to test if he was a traitor or a sworn brother in asosâ â my rant for the finale why the hell is dany even in it when she dismisses jorah in asos that is her last part in the book and that already happened in episode 8 so why is she being shown why is bran have a part too unless it is finally going to include coldhands i see no point to his scene and then the glimpse of cersei talking to tywin and cersei making out with jaime i am so confused as is what is going to happen in the finale that i am pretty annoyed this season had a lot of hype to live up to and once again i am thoroughly disappointed the shit with arya tyrion johnstannis and lady stoneheart should only be in the finale â maybe im being too much of a stickler and a hopeful reader for everything that happens in the books should happen in the show verbatim but i dont see how fans of the books can keep watching hbo destroy the books any longer even with the miniscule storyline changes edited by aovalle 09 june 2014  0421 pm"

"Corvinus",2014-06-09,"ive just rewatched both blackwater and this episode back to back i like them both about equally imo the wall had better visuals fx camera etc and also better action choreography blackwater had better dialogue though the wall is not far behind and more plot development thanks to the battle being brought to a conclusion the feel of urgency and stakes are about the same both episodes feeling like they passed really quickly the wall also had more drama during the action scenes  there were notable deaths on both sides while blackwater had none blackwater did add drama with tyrions injury and some of the dialogue the performances of the actors were great in both episodes but lena takes the crown if i am being subjective i like the wall better because its my favorite battle in the books tooâ"

"Anarchosaurus Rex",2014-06-10,"there has been a lot of discussion of what an adaptation is and isnt yes it does not have to be a word for word depiction of the original material it doesnt even have to be set in the same time period or in the original language kurasowa based several of his films on shakespeares plays 10 things i hate about you is a very enjoyable modern day version of the taming of the shrew and clueless ive often felt is closer to the original spirit of emma than some of the period drama versions of it but the plot should still be recognizable and the authors intentions in writing the work honored otherwise its a parody â what hbo and dd have given us is not an adaptation but a mutation theyve acted like some kind of radiation and turned the show into a rampaging behemoth trampling martins beautiful and intricate plot like its tokyo theyve changed characters personalities and story arcs almost out of recognition and what i worry about is this mutation spreading and affecting infecting the books yet to come martin should be flattered people care this much about his work more than he seems to and hbo and dd should be flattered that theyve gotten such a reaction from his fans and please lets stop calling dds efforts fanfiction since theyve basically vandalised the books vanfiction seems more appropriate â bravo"

"Unscythed",2014-06-13,"9 for me the battle was really well managed we got giants mammoths and enough blood but the only reason its not getting a 10 is because of what theyve done to gillys character how could she arrive unnoticed to castle black thats weird but as for the rest no complaints im not sure how realistically she could go unnoticed but they did address it when ygritte  co were talking ish around the fire and sharpening arrowsâ gilly walks by on the ridge and scurries along obviously hoping not to get noticed herself"

"valirpaz",2014-06-12,"what do you think will happen to jorah now if he actually does stay away from dany what would his storyline be where else could he go maybe to nights watch if he thinks his father is still alive considering how they portraied him i cant see that he changes sides he seems like the kind of guy who would still look for ways to support her from a distance for example go back to westeros and send her useful information or try to forge new alliances in braavos maybe its also an option to have him disappear â what happens to arya and the hound do you think they still go inside the vale will they finda sansa or will they stay out on their own from how the stories have developed so far i doubt there will be a reunion arya was so close before and brann  jon were so close too and it didnt happen they could still go in but maybe sansa is travelling around and if they meet at all i think it will be short before some other dramatic event occurs â also why were there so few wildlings attacking the gateâ why did the giant who lifted the gate go insideâ he should have held it open and propped it up so everyone could get through i agree with you on that i also thought that about the giant â and the way they portrayed ygrittes death was terribleâ at least let her loosen the bow indicating that she wasnt going to kill jon yes but why wasnt her hesitating close to it she indicated she was unsure about whether she should kill him would loosening the bow rightaway fit her character she fired three or four arrows into him last time so i thought this ambiguity in the scene fit â i wish jon snow would die hes an annoying character can you maybe explain its natural everyone has characters they like and dislike im just interested in whatwhy you find him annoying â i really hoped the wildlings would winâ the wildlings are like the germanic tribes vs the roman empireâ we always see the germans lose like in gladiator was hoping theyd win this time who knows maybe jon can negotiate a compromise the north is lost anyways so what does it matter if its controlled by the lannisters or by wildlings provided they settled down in their original lands and did not slay everyone so far i see your point but dont feel much about the wildlings would have been different if say jon stayed with them longer and we got more attachment or if they were at the border of kings landings with the real contrast yes but the north is more central european knights rather than romans im not sure id like to see all these lands being pillaged and burnt and butchered â ps off topic i do agree with you though that in popular film or also in documentaries eg rome  rise and fall of an empire theres quite a imbalanced storytelling about the good civil romans how brutally they may be vs the scary ruthless barbarians"
"ma_liky",2014-06-13,"thanks nice to hear although it must be funny to see people wildly guess about things that you already know â â i think thats how i will spend part of this year too rewatch the 4 seasons we should then open a non spoiler thread to discuss our new connections my problem is that in a book i could flip back and forth pages where somebody is from who he is related to check maps whereas on tv i forget things and think by this i miss a lot too probably a lot more connections could be made with more attention to detailâ â â i have to say that i am very interested about the story and history of got so i managed to read something that had happened before the beggining of the story staying out of spoilers of what is going to happen in the future i explored the maps and the houses history some creatures and some people who and what somethings are and how they managed to be where they are i dont know if all of that is written in the books but it gave a depth to the story and my knowlage of matters in got and i have to admit that that made me more interested and amaized how big and detailed is the world of got â hated this episodeâ there was no plot just fight scenesâ also the fighting didnt make any senseâ why would mance send people behind the wall to attack during a test runâ why not send all your forces behind the wall â also why were there so few wildlings attacking the gateâ why did the giant who lifted the gate go insideâ he should have held it open and propped it up so everyone could get through â i like blackwater much better â also i hate that little boy for killing ygritteâ and the way they portrayed ygrittes death was terribleâ at least let her loosen the bow indicating that she wasnt going to kill jonâ or have ygritte kill that bald dude just before he was going to kill jonâ â i wish jon snow would die hes an annoying character â so were there really 100000 wildlingsâ i just saw a big bush fire but not many wildlings i really hoped the wildlings would winâ the wildlings are like the germanic tribes vs the roman empireâ we always see the germans lose like in gladiator was hoping theyd win this time â i can understand why you didnt like the episode we all have ours preferences in the show and want to see our favourite characters develop quickly and their stories in every episode but this is why this show is great because it has so many characters and stories and everyone is given enough time i loved this episode because got can allow themselfs to have a whole episode aboutâ no story movent or is it â i dont aggree with you about almost everything the whole episode i thought she would kill jon i thought this to the point before she dies she hesitated it is well seen doesnt matter who killed her she couldnt kill jon i understand that all have their favourite characters but saying that jon should be dead i dont understand i would also like to hear why i think jon is one of rare who is honest and true he is loyal and in somewhat naive but that gives him innocence and honor he is one of the characters that is uncorrupted and actualy good he is still to grow in seasons to come his goodnes should be nurtured â i think that there are 100000 wildings but why put them all in the first battel the war is still to come it is the question of who will come to aid the nw and the fact that white walkers are close and the wildings are running away from them too so even alliance is probable the real enemy are white walkers and how to stop them is true challenge"
"ma_liky",2014-06-13,"i think littlefinger was pro lannister early on because he saw them as the greatest way for him to get more power â so he did whatever he could to help them but mostly looking out for himself and what was in his best interests to get the most power once he started realizing how much of a douche joffery was and how he was uncontrollable he made new alliances with the tyrells â there is some point where he is talking on the ship to sansa about both alliances and how the one with the tyrells was the easier or safer option â with maybe varys being the only one who is close to litlefinger he is definetly heads above everyone else i think with long term planning and strategy â just some things to think about moving into the final episode â what do you think will happen to jorah now if he actually does stay away from dany what would his storyline be where else could he go maybe to nights watch if he thinks his father is still alive â believe tyrion will definitely be sentenced to death not quite sure whether it will happen or not if anyone comes to his aid i believe it will be jaime â what happens to arya and the hound do you think they still go inside the vale will they finda sansa or will they stay out on their own â i think jorah will stay somewhere close to meereen he loves dany he will try to stay close i think first he will get drunk and cry about losing dany but than trying to get back to her what ever the price this is what i would do i feel sorry for him it was too harsh on him he didnt deserve it he was indeed loyal to her and truly loves her but this is why he should have been honest with her if he had told her at the beggining and admited himself i think she would have forgiven him but finding out like this how can she trust him again i realy hope tyrion will somehow manage to escape and i think if some one is to help him it is jamie in my eyes jamie will get some plus points for this well i am confused about what happens with arya and the hound maybe he will try to randsome her to jon now at the wall and join the nw i dont think they will find sansa because no one knows that sansa is sansa they think she is littlefingers niece some lords do but non who is able to tell arya so they will have to do something else maybe arya escapes or he lets her go i am interestid to se how it plays out edited by maliky 13 june 2014  0212 am"
"valirpaz",2014-06-13,"well i am confused about what happens with arya and the hound maybe he will try to randsome her to jon now at the wall and join the nw i dont think they will find sansa because no one knows that sansa is sansa they think she is littlefingers niece some lords do but non who is able to tell arya so they will have to do something else maybe arya escapes or he lets her go i am interestid to se how it plays out this is a very good point you made in the discussion thread of the last episode i said about the aunts death generally i dont see how this should change their plans yes the aunts dead but that still means that shes got her cousin in the vale and shouldnt make it less safe for her and if you apply traditional nobility values her cousin would still reward the hound but im sure therell be an event why that wont happen but now with what you said if arya learns that baelish has custody of her cousin and thus in a powerful position  that might be a reason why arya will not enter the vale  and thus not meet sansa â i think arya and the hound will stick together they are a great combination and by now i think arya starts to like the hound and vice versa also she thinks she has no family left so hes the only one who protects her in these dangerous lands im not sure jon would be such a logical choice to go to doesnt being in the watch basically mean you live without much property how could the hound think he could get any money off jon but moving north would be an interesting turn it would be very dangerous because around winterfell people would probably recognise her and where else would they move other than that arya has to end up in braavos"

"jbob",2014-06-08,"exactly had they added the additional time theyll be using in the last episode 65 min to end this episode properly it would have been an excellent episode i think it is legitimate most poster have a legitimate complaint about the abruptness of the ending and the lack of stannis â but then people would complain that that isnt enough time and needed to be longer in fact on other forums i saw people start to complain that there needs to be more than 10 minutes of stannis and how disappointing that would be"

"Gladiator of Dorne",2014-06-08,"no one complaining about the lack of stannis as far as i have read has said a word about the battle being underwhelming on its own though killing off two of the established and recognizable wall characters isnt going to help any next season â our issue is more with the narrative and wasted time on other irrelevant issues im a stannis fan though i was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and this episode should have been his moment by rights as episode 9 of season 2 was tywins moment"
"Alia Atreides",2014-06-08,"of course and killing them both helps shorten that storyline for next year when jon is lc they have a lot to compact next season jon has 13 chapters theyll need to condense into one season as im almost sure theyll have the stabbing by the end of next season â ahh yes wow then by the time we are in the 6th season im not going to wish to watch anymore it will of been caught up with the books"

"teej6",2014-06-08,"im so confused about why the fanatics are worried that stannis will have lost his moment â if anything the show went out of its way to set up stannis being some hero â they set up jon looking as the hero of battle numero uno who talks to other heros of the battle about how they are totally fucked because mance still so greatly outnumbers them then our hero jon goes off into the sunset to meet with mance without wolf or weapon totally thinking hes going to die and hell be surrounded by giants and mammoths and 100k wildlings and it will look impressively sinister for jon until suddenly this dude comes out of the trees and saves the fucking day â thats a better set up for stannis in the books because this time jon volunteered rather than where he was forced to do it in the books â hes walking out there like a boss and if the negotiation doesnt go well hes dead â of course jon may likely be negotiating with mance like he was in the books when stannis shows up but stillcome on â how much more of a stannis saves the day set up do you fanatics need â get a grip â agreed i liked the jon volunteering bit as well and also this is jons moment to shine but as another poster said earlier they could have build this over a few episodes prior we really didnt need missandeigreyworm luv scenes and such pointless fillers and in this episode they could have ended the whole wall story with stannis riding in at the end too many things happening next week it will be another episode where they hop from scene to scene and ultimately stannis most rewarding scene in books will not have the impact it had in the books"
"averde",2014-06-08,"thats pretty much the exact same thing that happens in the book â theres a battle raging when stannis arrives and its made pretty clear he just saved castle black from being overwhelmed in the books in the show based on this episode and the preview for the next episode it looks like there wont be any fighting going on when stannis arrives just jon and mance about to team up and head out and all of a sudden stannis arrives and genocides a bunch of now good wildlingsâ"

"BrettStark",2014-06-08,"have to conclude that this episode was quite underwhelming now dont get me wrong the battle itself was pretty damn good and i was enjoying it loads but to finish it with jon just walking out like that and no stannis was disappointing â the main part of the battle at the wall i had been looking forward to was stannis arrival and how d  d portrayed it on screen now i just feel like even though we know its going to happen next week it wont quite have the same impact due to tyrion killing tywin bran meeting bloodraven and hopefully although im not holding my breath at this point the arrival of lady stoneheart i think they could have done so much more to this episode considering the money they spent on it â however on the flip side i suppose when we think of it now the finale is going to be jam packed with a tonne of major wtf moments heres hoping they have captured it rightâ â stannis didnt arrive during this fight lol ugh people commmmonâ"

"Zman1863",2014-06-08,"i think the problems with the pacing of this episode and how it was left on a cliffhanger are partially due to the craster detour they could have done a bit more to set up with the time they had but then im sure the hordes of unsullied would have been complaining even more that nothing was happeningâ â perhaps they should have had ygrittes band attack midseason instead of the craster detour give bran a couple more visions and maybe he finds ghost and sends him homeâ"

"Rockroi",2014-06-08,"a great episode though clearly â a step behind the prior two â<U+0080><U+009C>episode ninesâ<U+0080><U+009D> blackwater red weddingâ â what i liked â the battle of the wall in two parts the episode continued the tradition of the balckwater in giving the viewer a deep personal and extremely raw look at a battleâ from the giants to the wildings to giantsbane to ygritte to jon to grenn â<U+0080><U+0093> the episode told us the horror of this battle and left us wanting for nothing â<U+0080> from the battleâ there was more than enough action more than enough destruction and a great deal of plot and plotting so we can infer how horrible it has been for the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch â<U+0080><U+0093> even though they wonâ i also loved how the episode gave us a glimpse at all these men and how they rose to the occasion grenn edd jon sam and shrunk from it slyntâ there was a lot of character development and growth here â the show did its best work in having two separate fronts  the wall proper andâ castleâ black and integrating them together slowly andâ whenâ necessary going back and forth â â and even a note to the improvement of the fight scenes yes there were still a few times i could see problems there was one scene where i think its safe to say the action was way too slow and it looked like they sped up the fim to make the action seem faster which seems like poor craftsmanship to meâ but overall this was a great action movieepisode with plenty to enjoyâ â sam tarly lord of the wall i get tagged with the â<U+0080><U+009C>book puristâ<U+0080><U+009D> label a bit and i can live with that but watching sam tarly grow from coward to capable man of the watch is a dramatic and clear improvement over the booksâ sam is more a layered man than a scared child who cowers from everythingâ the show has turned sam from a sidekick and into a real multidimensionalâ â character and it showed through from start to finishâ in many ways this was sam tarlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s coming out party not john snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>sâ â â alister thorne 100 bad ass how great was thatâ from telling great speeches to calming the men by yelling at them to fighting like he was the hound  the viper rolled together allister thorne gave us the look at the cut of a man facing down his lifeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s purpose this was not some outpost to civilization this was not an afterthought alister thorne was at the center of the battle between good and evil and showed us that even complete assholes can rise to the occasion â even his talk with jon was half needle half prepsession â he stayed true to himself and true to what was going on around him to not be an asshat about it all â and that fight with giantsbaneâ fucking styling shit there huh â the men of the watch pyp john grenn edd and sam all had very meaningful roles and held them wellâ each one had only a handful of lines but each one brought import and dimension to everything they didâ the writers did a tremendous job of giving each one enough to do and gave the audience enough time to interact with each one â â ygritte they were true to her and she was true to the character the show gave us the duality of ygritte  both a strongwilled wildling to the core but also a very conflicted woman who when it came time was more conflicted than even she let onâ while i thought the book did a better job of the ending she dies â<U+0080><U+009C>off screenâ<U+0080><U+009D> i think this telling as very true to formâ â on the fence about â first time for everything but did you have to kill everyone i know its odd to have this complaint in agot but the wall is now decidedly sparce as of now â for starters you killedâ almostâ everyone we knew and liked only edd jon and sam escaped theâ wrath of hbo even thornes fate is up in the air â pyp grenn maybe thorne  leaving jon with painfully few allies to well you know vote and fewer still who we may beâ interestedâ in â kind of leaving us with sam and jon and not much else â though i did like that their deaths made that fight seem a hell of a lot more horrifying â â what i did not like â if you are going to make the season ten episodes donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give us a 52 minute episode and a shitty cliffhanger â did not like the construction of the episode â it was too short and had far too much dead timeâ â so most cable series are 1213 episodes got is 10 and we should be luky to get that as its one of the most expensive series in the history of tvâ but if you are going to give us 10 episodes make then ten full episodes donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give us shitty filler and donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t cut them off short this episode did bothâ for starters there was a tremendous amount of deadtime in the episode a very â<U+0080><U+009C>mehâ<U+0080><U+009D> discussion between jon and sam about women been there done all of that it then continues with a terrible awful totally unnecessary discussion between sam and maester aemon still technically on the payroll â<U+0080><U+0093> that discussion was 3 minutes 30 seconds yes went back and watched itâ it neither sets the stage for the upcoming battle nor builds up the tension it is a completely wasted sceneâ you then have the gillysam reunited scene which wasâ<U+0080> fineâ<U+0080> but took 130 and then sam locks her away a few more minutes thereâ we get more long shots of the wiildings and the scene with ygritte et allâ<U+0080> kinda redundant but i get it â all in all the battle does not actually start until 20 minutes in it ends at around the 45 min mark with the capture of giantsbaneâ by contrast blackwater has no dead time the battle starts at around the 12 minute mark and does not end until the final shot at the 53 min mark a walltowall episode of battle tension struggle and conflictâ oh and that conflict is resolvedâ<U+0080> â here we have plenty of filler and a lot of dead time which culminates inâ<U+0080> oh wait noâ<U+0080> itâ didntâ actually culminate in anythingâ the episode ends at the 52 min mark but nothing substantive happens at all after gb is captured we learn that grenn died but that wholeâ thing could have been recut with jon just in the tunnel at grenn when he starts talkingâ you could have easily gotten to mance within the confines of a legit episodeâ and yes you could have nabbed stannis time too â insteadâ we got aâ longwindedâ speech a bullshit cliffhanger which does not bode well for the future of the show mind you zero closure and the result of the battle and its significance will be lost  completely and totally lost â<U+0080><U+0093>with the other events ofâ next weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode â spoiler tyrion escapes tywin dies cat possibly returns â in other words stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> gigantic rescue mission will be dulleddown and muted by the other events of the show â thanks again dd for screwing the character yet againâ â but even if that was not the caseâ<U+0080> to end that onâ a cliffhangerâ like that is an insult to the viewers most notably in the light of blackwater and other battles where we know what happens and can gain some level of satisfaction for ourâ time and effortâ the show decided to leak that to the finale which is â<U+0080> fineâ<U+0080> â but it also makes me think that they are going to â<U+0080><U+009C>water downâ<U+0080><U+009D> the next season by extending jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s very redundant storyline into the next season and that will bore me to tears as wellâ â all of that is a very long way of saying this you could have done everything you needed to do in this episode and still have time to spare for stannis and mance if you ran a tighter shipâ cut the fat give us what we needed and wanted tighten your focus give us a few moreâ minutesâ on the back end and you could have done it allâ instead wait until next weekâ<U+0080> â â â and that â<U+0080> bothers meâ<U+0080> â overall exceptional episode one of the better ones of the series with much to discuss and enjoyâ but also with a glaring flaw which has be concernedâ edited by rockroi 08 june 2014  0957 pm"

"Pearlthegirl",2014-06-08,"im so confused about why the fanatics are worried that stannis will have lost his moment â if anything the show went out of its way to set up stannis being some hero â they set up jon looking as the hero of battle numero uno who talks to other heros of the battle about how they are totally fucked because mance still so greatly outnumbers them then our hero jon goes off into the sunset to meet with mance without wolf or weapon totally thinking hes going to die and hell be surrounded by giants and mammoths and 100k wildlings and it will look impressively sinister for jon until suddenly this dude comes out of the trees and saves the fucking day â thats a better set up for stannis in the books because this time jon volunteered rather than where he was forced to do it in the books â hes walking out there like a boss and if the negotiation doesnt go well hes dead â of course jon may likely be negotiating with mance like he was in the books when stannis shows up but stillcome on â how much more of a stannis saves the day set up do you fanatics need â get a grip this entirely i was expecting stannis myself thinking theyd rush through the wall story lines as theyve butchered them all season in the end im glad theyre sticking to the books this time they did not properly build to this all season its true but this episode was a love story to the nights watch and that alone stannis story really builds after thisin the books he underdogs his way in to save the day when the watch has depleted themselves doing their jobs its where i began to like and root for stannis when i read the books where he overcomes his previous defeats i hope he gets his due from here on i am worried considering his portrayal thus far but im not going to write off his looming heroism just because he didnt get an episode finale i pray they start showing stannis some love because i can empathize with the stanstans frustrations with his show portrayal but really this is a turning point for his character where he fights for his realm and not his entitlement i do hope they dont blow that id like to repeat this episode was a love story to the nights watch i am pleased there were some great technical shots  the panoramic of the castle black side the swinging scythe taking out the climbers mammoths and giants oh my ghost vision and character development of yes those guys those watchers on the wall episode title anyone aemon sharing wisdom jon and sam showing the innocence of their youth before battle grenn filling in for donal noye and holding the effin gate against an effin giant newfound respect for aliser thornewhat yeah slynts denial and cowardice jons smile when he sees ygritte aiming right at him the kids vengeance for his parents damnit pyp rip sam releasing ghost edd the wall is yours for the strangers sake people not a bad little love story to the true heroes of the damn realm heres hoping were all happy with the finale next week not bloody likely yeah alright it went too fast and ended abruptlyi was on the edge of my seat the whole time"
"Jay92",2014-06-08,"so with the lack of stannis in this episode does this mean jon wont become lc this season i figured he would but theres way too many things that have to happen at the wall and only one episode to go now â it was sad to see pyp and grenn die but at least edd is still around â no it will happen since jon season 5 arc will be a set up for command we just wont have the whole vote over days and like 5 guys being voted for command stannis will offer winterfell jon will struggle with the decision but ultimately decide he cant take it because bran is out there and thats when he gets voted by all the men it wont be drawn out as it was in the booksâ â still though next episode will be crazy jam packedâ"

"Conchobar",2014-06-08,"this is the first time in the show we had an accurate depiction of aerial strategic movements that pan from the north of the wall to the south of the wall from the firing archers perspective with arrows falling on to the encroaching wildling band attacking the south gate was incredible it really gave us a perspective of the strategic landscape of the battle and wall at that time and i think it helped the unsullied understand the tactical scenarios that were about to present themselves to the nights watch"

"redriver",2014-06-09,"explain why and how please like in the books stannis didnt arrive until several days into the assault on the wallafter the cannibal savages wildling portrayal of this seasonwe need time to see that this is not by any means entirely the casei hope to see mance saying my people have bled enough before stannis attacksthis would add nuance more in keeping with the books whilst giving stanfans their cheer moment â and in case anyone thinks i favour mance over stannisi think they are actually working in concert in the latter half of adwd whether knowingly or notbut the show needs to start redacting this all wildlings are evil stuff otherwise jons ongoing role will be impossible"

"Onna Lewyys",2014-06-09,"ok i didnt hate it  solely based on the power of my love for jon snow and the nw as a bookreader  but it certainly was nowhere near as good actually fantastic as blackwater imo they made four huge mistakes wrt this episode mistake 1 pushing the raid from the south to the end of the season it made no sense lead to pointless filler throughout the season and undercut the emotional power of ygrittes death scene mistake 2 not using the rest of the season to develop the characters at the wall the only characters we really know are jon sam  alliser and one of them is an asshole its kind of hard to care about a bunch of namelesssoulless extras  vaguelydrawn bit players mistake 3 too much walltowall action without a respite without anything else to cut to the action gets repetitive and its hard to keep the momentum going blackwater had maegors holdfast this had nothing mistake 4 structuring the episode without a resolution not for stanniss sake but for the sake of having a complete narrative jon going to treat with mance should have been about the 45 mark concluding with about 2 minutes of stanniss army kicking ass and mirroring blackwater is kind of the point"

"MoIaF",2014-06-09,"ok i didnt hate it  solely based on the power of my love for jon snow and the nw as a bookreader  but it certainly was nowhere near as good actually fantastic as blackwater imo they made four huge mistakes wrt this episode mistake 1 pushing the raid from the south to the end of the season it made no sense lead to pointless filler throughout the season and undercut the emotional power of ygrittes death scene mistake 2 not using the rest of the season to develop the characters at the wall the only characters we really know are jon sam  alliser and one of them is an asshole its kind of hard to care about a bunch of namelesssoulless extras  vaguelydrawn bit players mistake 3 too much walltowall action without a respite without anything else to cut to the action gets repetitive and its hard to keep the momentum going blackwater had maegors holdfast this had nothing mistake 4 structuring the episode without a resolution not for stanniss sake but for the sake of having a complete narrative jon going to treat with mance should have been about the 45 mark concluding with about 2 minutes of stanniss army kicking ass and mirroring blackwater is kind of the point â agree with each and everyone of these especially the first one and the fourth one"

"Thelastactionhero",2014-06-09,"okay so i sobered up and gave the episode a rewatch while i am incredibly sceptical of the decision to cut mance and stannis from this episode i do think that the battle of castle black was definitely one of the high points this season i think that there was way too much time spent on sam and gillys relationship but overall they really managed to pull on a lot of emotional heart strings with various character interactions and suprising casaulties alliser thorne in particular stole the show for me we didnt get the heroic death many of us were expecting but we did get a really interesting development in jon and allisers relationship and i enjoyed their dynamic immensely in this episode i realize that some people are going overboard about stannis being absent but i dont think that this criticism should be entirely ignored on the basis of that in terms of a narrative arc ending this episode with a cliff hanger instead of giving it a satisfying conclusion makes the sequence feel somewhat incomplete there was more than enough time to allocate towards mance and jon before having stannis make his charge especially given the length of the finale seeing as the show deviates from the narrative in ways that are far more substantial i dont see why giving stannis his red dawn of the rohirrim moment last night would have been a bad move even if he does arrive days after the initial skirmish at castle black theres still a chance to make stannis scene satisfying and i really did enjoy the episode for the most part but i guess i just would have preferred to have had all of the nights watch scenes resolved in this episode rather than leave everything so congested in the finale"
"Janicia",2014-06-09,"when i read that jon was sent on a suicide mission to kill mance it seemed kind of over the top to me â like seriously  all this stuff is happening and youre going to be petty enough to send jon on a pointless suicide mission that will almost certainly fail and probably backfire â it would feel much more that way in the show because events played out differently â also jon going on a suicide mission feels like a man might respond to watching the woman he loved die sending a friend on a suicide mission and being in a hopeless situation with a hero complex â"
"Maid So Fair",2014-06-09,"i felt this episode was a bit of a let down when i watched it this morning but on rewatch im starting to appreciate it a lot more it had just the right balance of action and emotion and some of the shots were spectacular with a tv budget they did an absolutely amazing job with the fighting as well â i liked i loved jon probably more so than i did in the books at this point started to really like him in adwd and it was a great way of showing off both his fighting and leadership skills some great choreography when hes fighting styr i even like the change of canon with him going on a suicide mission voluntarily out of the sense of duty master aemon is always a great screen presence and so is tormund har the biggest shock was allister thorne however i didnt think there was any way for me to come to sympathise with him but the show proved me wrong the nights watch as such really came into its own this episode â nitpicks the wildlings having a bloody bbq literally next to the wall i get that it makes for dramatic shots but it was just idiotic  being behind a tiny hill makes no difference when people are looking out for you from the top of a 700foot wall i was hoping to see mance he is seriously underused  but i suppose theres the next episode for that wish there was more of ghost but i understand why that couldnt be â it was pretty obvious that stannis was not going to be making an appearance ever since the episode synopses came out who else was going to be that unexpected arrival from beyond the wall if not stannis"

"Zman1863",2014-06-09,"theres a lot to be done in the finale but i think they can get it done provided they allocate more time than they have to most of the episodes this season they also need to be disciplined with relatively minor arcs dany and crew cersei tommen and marg cant be allowed to occupy undue amounts of time â im also pretty apprehensive about how much of a time pit arya the hound and brienne and pod will be it would seem that it will require at least a few scenes to get an intersection plus arya leaving the hound plus getting on a ship in one episode im skeptical that arya will be seabound by the end of the episode because of this brienne development however the last song on the soundtrack seems far too upbeat for any other story arc except for arya sailing off for a new start unless the song is not to appear in the show at allâ"

"Caerl Targaryen",2014-06-10,"that said i need to see it again but if i decide i liked blackwater a lot better you all will just have to love me anyway what makes blackwater a better episode for me personally even if it isnt as visually or technically impressive is that they did a much better job setting it up they spent time establishing the players and explaining the situation clearly while slowly building up to it over the course of the season most of the material at the wall this season has felt like one missed opportunity after another the crasters keep material could have been completely cut and replaced with more direct material leading up to this bigger attack from mance the extra time could have also been used to show more of the struggles bran and company were going through or they could have used bran to tell more backstory there are a lot of ways they could have more effectively built up to this episode to give it a bigger impact but this has been a problem all season outside of kings landing they could have been using the time with dany to transition viewers into the more heavily political situation she finds herself in as well as establishing meereen as a city instead weve ended up with a missandeigrey worm romance and dany deciding on a whim to sleep with daario both were handled fairly well for what they are but its time that could have been better spent on more relevant development and thats really just one of many examples poor use of screen time has been a problem all season and has really diluted a lot of the stories for me edited by caerl targaryen 10 june 2014  1238 am"

"Caerl Targaryen",2014-06-10,"sorry if i made myself unclear basically i agree with youno worries its all good ah the kid bbq yeah that would workthats the most likely thing theyll be ending danys arc with this season it even fits with the episode title the children many of the plots they have left to deal with have to do with children in various ways there are the children of the forest danys children the dragons the dragons killing a child tyrion exacting revenge against his father and being helped by his brother to escape theres lady stonehearts revenge against those who butchered her last known living son and of course there are the stories involving the remaining stark children we could probably break down the remaining subplots and look at them from the same perspective some would probably be more forced the title seemed rather lame when i first read it but its actually a pretty smart title now that ive thought about it a little more it doesnt really give anything away yet its quite telling if you know anything about the books edited by caerl targaryen 10 june 2014  1219 am"
"rmholt",2014-06-10,"what makes blackwater a better episode for me personally even if it isnt as visually or technically impressive is that they did a much better job setting it up they spent time establishing the players and explaining the situation clearly while slowly building up to it over the course of the season most of the material at the wall this season has felt like one missed opportunity after another the crasters keep material could have been completely cut and replaced with more direct material leading up to this bigger attack from mance the extra time could have also been used to show more of the struggles bran and company were going through or they could have used bran to tell more backstory there are a lot of ways they could have more effectively built up to this episode to give it a bigger impact but this has been a problem all season outside of kings landing they could have been using the time with dany to transition viewers into the more heavily political situation she finds herself in as well as establishing meereen as a city instead weve ended up with a missandeigrey worm romance and dany deciding on a whim to sleep with daario both were handled fairly well for what they are but its time that could have been better spent on more relevant development and thats really just one of many examples poor use of screen time has been a problem all season and has really diluted a lot of the stores for me i agree with your issues the tech superhuman efforts have at times exceeded character and plot theres nothing in wall that chilled me like several moments in blackwater they scaled the tech way down but that single ship leaking green said enough i said cool a few times giants who do archery wth is the scythe ohwow but only the grenngateoath scene hit me inside when davos son hollers drums i just flip  that whole assault looked like the director took lessons from ddaysaving private ryan right up to anticipatory puking jon and ygritte had an entire love affair with virtually no facial expressions or visible passion and thats how the fight at the wall looked  on that side maybe that was on purpose bc the wildlings looked intense if it was on purpose i dont think its working"
"Raksha 2014",2014-06-10,"i think that much of the frustration that book readers feel with some of the choices that the shows writers and directors have made stems from the book readers knowing that certain characters are very important to the story and seeing them getting less screen time than they might need to accomplish the purposes they fulfilled in the book not to mention seeing them characterized as they were in the books â â stannis plays an important role in the survival of the nights watch and destiny of the wildlings and the north at least for now and during the time of the story we are seeing dramatized â hes a good leader and soldier â but in the show stannis is an unlikeable grump who burns trusted allies because theyre infidels and does not at least has not yet come to the defense of the nights watch in a blaze of rhlorryglory â yet we get invented scenes such as the maester aemonsam discussion about love â i wonder if sam gets a lot more screen time than stannis because tvfans like sam more than they like stannis â not saying they do but its a possibility â also it could be that the show is contractually obligated to give peter vaughan the 91yearold actor who plays aemon a certain amount of screen time per season or they could have wanted to have this episode be all about the men of the nights watch themselves plus gilly and the way they face hopeless odds without a lastminute reprieve from stannis the mannis â i confess that i cannot figure out the presentation of the character of mance rayder in the tv show â he was a hardened rogue in the book but also possessed charm and charisma and genuinely seemed to like or at least value jon snow â tvmance has just glowered and frowned and seemed to disapprove of jon like every other wildling except ygritte â i wonder if ciaran hinds was bored or unhappy freezing up in iceland because he certainly looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there â â and dont get me started on tvbriennes viciousness and now her surly disapproval of pod â perhaps the directors wanted her to be more edgy than the character in the book â or littlefinger who is definitely less smart than his book counterpart â â it would probably be easier for me and other book readers to have not read the books at all so we could just enjoy the tv series as good entertainment â if only they could make each episode 10 minutes longer it would improve things a bit i think â meanwhile i think that next weeks finale will be very busy â if were lucky well see â brienne fightin and bitin arya abandoning the dying hound and valar morghulising off to braavos bran meets a tree the children of the forest maybe bloodraven danys dragon babies are growing up too fast she has to lock them up tyrion and jaimes significant tysha discussion during tyrions escape tyrion taking that fateful detour to the chamber of the hand and killing tywin and shae jon vs wildling host hello mance â then stannis â stannis â stannis lady stoneheart â theres no time for cersei sansa littlefinger samgilly margaery tommen etc â not even time for all that should be in the episode â i could see them pushing lady stoneheart to the end of the first episode of season 5 â however i might well be totally wrong"

"Kyoshi",2014-06-10,"sometimes i wonder why some of the people on this forum still watch the show the comments posted while the show was airing will lead you to believe everyone is having a good time and loving the episode but then it ends and people dont see the one thing they wanted to be there and suddenly it was all bad â speaking as someone who started by watching the show and then reading the books i have to say that i was generally more impressed with the show before i started reading the books but thats because i came to the show with no expectations except thrilling entertainment and thats what i got this is the same reason the unsullied are not complaining about the episode from what ive seen anyway the thing is that it was a brilliant episode like the rest of the episodes this season â assuming that the biggest disappointment was stannis the missing i get the feeling that if stannis had made it to the wall people might have then started complaining about the manner of his arrival or how he just didnt seem heroic enough or how dd deviated from the book or how the lighting didnt hit his hair at just the right angle â in their disappointment people fail to realise that this is a show unlike grrms books it has several limitations imposed on it a lot of the things we read cannot be translated on to the screen grrm works with imagination and imagination alone dd work in the real world i do admit that if the episodes were 10 minutes longer maybe that problem would not be so extensive however that would still strain the budget and dd would still manage to piss off some people â the thing to do when watching this show is to cast away all book expectations i loved the episode book knowledge or not it was brilliantly done even better than blackwater in my opinion"

"Yuki_no_JonI",2014-06-10,"â â what are you talking about jon just shot tormund in the leg and kicked him in the gut a man who he was supposed to be aligned with once jon is much more outwardly outspoken against his superiors in the show if anything it will be less surprising on the show than it was in the book slynt is also way more of a bitch on the show and they would never shy from a beheading if youre going to complain at least try to root it in some reality or logicâ â â â having him captured and defeated could work all the free folk want is to get behind the wall and to safety and while killing mance does work better it also creates more tension between the free folk and stannisnw its just way too campy to show them burning mance on screen and then suddenly have him show up in a scene with melissandre and say haha you fooled you this isnt scooby dooâ â â actually i hated tormund being captured and someone mentioned in a previous post that maybe tormund will play rattleshirts part i wont disagree that i complain a lot about the way the show is at north but hell i hate how they changed the story i cant see jon willing to kill mance by his own accord i could not stand him being manipulated by ygritte and the wildings its not that the events didnt turn quite similar is the way of getting to the end that bothers me â honestly i think his arc is better on the show than in the book because hes more believable as a leader and its more believable that he will get elected lc â i wont disagree that it seems more leaderlike but it is on adwd where he kills the boy and it is sam who elects him into lc it is not like it was his decision with the trope things turn on show we might even see him placing his own name edited by yukinojoni 10 june 2014  0925 am"

"bayjew",2014-06-15,"dont get me wrong absolutely loved this episode really enjoyed how the show took a whole hour to express the battle and other elements to defending the wall with that being said i just feel as though deciding to kill off grenn and pyp were two terrible mistakes in this episode just quickly i realise that the fight needed to kill characters that the audience is connected with but this raises me to the issue with the wall storyline as a whole just in the television show the wall itself is a setting that frequently draws complaints from many people who watch the show mainly because it lacks pace and is boring having always enjoyed the jon perspective the most in the books and in the show i cant really say the same however i will say that i can understand why people may find it boring â the wall lacks any significant characters that can create intrigue certainly jon is obviously a pinnacle character sam too but the audience has no other significant characters that it can attach to or like or hate in this story we have ser aliser thorne and recently janos slynt but we as the audience are supposed to hate these characters grenn and pyp two characters given to us from season one have remained somewhat consistently throughout the series my main point here is that they are recognisable we lack significant recognisable faces in this storyline we have jon sam aliser dolorous janos aemon grenn pyp the wall supposedly had 100 men for this fight yet it felt like we knew nothing about any of the nights watch members that fought and died establishing minor characters is essential as grenn had to fill donal noyes role these two characters should not have died grenn represents jons connection with the fighting force of the nights watch a man who he has known for two years almost pyp has the connection to the stewards etc it just didnt feel right killing them off to me also partially because of the role they play in helping jom become lord commander â â"

"Miodrag",2014-06-09,"this inside the episode was hands down the worst most lame one of the entire series â everyone patting each other on the back for what a fantastic episode they put together â â have to disagree because of my personal reasons i finally got some long awaited satisfaction â you see two years ago on this very site i raised the issue of two scenes  one from episode 1x05 and one from episode 2x05  in which parts of the action were sped up in the editing in order for fighting to look more effective and i heavily criticized dd for that choice i said its a blasphemy no respectable showmovie would ever allow itself now to say that i was heavily criticized for that criticism would be an understatement loads of show lovers were attacking and insulting me saying among other things that i obviously know nothing about editing nor about television by numerous posters some of them professional editors or so they claimed speedingup was described as a standard editing technique that is used all the time in movies and tv someone linked my essay on wicnet and posters there were even more furious at myself with some going as far as speculating that i dont even exist  that its just eliolinda or even martin himself writing under false identity because they secretly hate dd because of the shows success â so it is with great surprise and ultimate pleasure that i watched db weiss of all people essentially admitting the criticism of that editing was very justified in inside the episode video starting at 421 weiss says that kit was so good in action scenes that at one instance they presumably he and benioff thought someone sped up the raw footage and they wanted it brought back to normal speed weiss words it looks fake it looks too fast can we fix whatever somebody did to that shot eventually after a visual effects editor checked the scene it turned out nobody spedup anything just kit was that fast but thats beside my point and my point is thank you mr weiss for confirming that what you did in episodes 1x05 and 2x05 was very very wrong it was so wrong that this time around you insisted on fixing the scene you thought was spedup before the expert convinced you theres no need for fixing because nobody spedup the footage a better man probably wouldnt enjoy this turn of events as much as i do at the moment and a big hello to all those experts that for two years were calling me ignorant prick jerk king of nitpicking hateful purist and so on"

"Buckbeak",2014-06-09,"i am confused havent read books for a long time now so i am probably wrong but i thought there were two battles at the nw first from the south when ygritte dies then a few hoursdays later from mance so if this was only focusing on the first mini battle then why would you expect to see stannis anyway he arrived when jon went to speak to mance which was days later right â i guess the episode was just too short and may have been rushed if they had jon go and see him then stannis come i just hope they dont pile it all into the next episode as i am assuming that is focusing on tyrionâ â my nitpick really is ghost thought they would show him killing more wildings rather than just the one then eating for the rest of the showâ i dont like any samgilly scene i think thats just me though and would rather watch action than the whole romance thingâ i am not sure what they are going to show in next weeks episode now there is just way too much to fit in so they are either going to miss alot out or going to be very confusing episode and keep going back and forth to different charactersâ"

"Bowen",2014-06-09,"you make it sound like georges writing takes a subtle approach to violence to me the books deal with violence very directly and explicitly i always get vivid images in my head of gory details when reading of moments like the trial by combat i agree that violence can often be better expressed with subtlety but i dont agree that subtlety would make a scene like that more faithful to the books â one of the things thats been bothering me for a while is tormunds role i just loved his character so much in the books and i think the show has captured little of his charm the actor is alright but none of his more endearing dialogues ever make it into the show i really wish we could see his conversation with jon after jon leaves to find mance that is such a beautiful moment when amidst all the warfare they communicate almost like old friends it dissolves the tension perfectly but keeps intrigue afloat i suppose it was too late for that to happen once they had tormund over the wall with ygritte but i still wish for it theyve made tormund out to be just another meanlooking wildling â overall though i liked the episodetheyve turned tormund into the biggest nob in westeroshow on earth could they fail to notice jon and tormund in the books"

"Gregor's Nancy Boy",2014-06-09,"overall a horrible episode heres the things i didnt like â every bit of dialogue from the awkward small talk to the misplaced comic relief to the underwhelming battle speeches nothing said in this episode was impactful in any way ygrittes last words about the cave were the only exception to this though the scene was sullied by what was going on around her and jon they killed about ten men each just a few moments ago but its cute that they can still find it in themselves to trade sappy lines right in the middle of the battle â the hollywoodinspired combat sequences nothing seemed real nearly every extra who died on screen did so immediately after being swung on one single time with a sword and it seemed as if they were all specifically instructed by the choreographer in charge to scream absurdly and exaggerate their body movements during battle and while all these supposedly seasoned men were dying left and right jon snow was hacking his foes apart without issue save for the big baddy at the end im sorry but when i read the books jon snow did not strike me as a killing machine its ridiculous how over powered the main characters in this episode were compared to all the random nameless watchmen and wildings if you were facing ser alliser jon snow tormund ygritte or the thenn you didnt stand a chance unless of course you were ser alliser jon snow tormund ygritte or the thenn â the deaths of grenn and pypâ what a lousy way to send off two supporting characters who have been with us from the start i know dd wanted to add some sort of price to be had for the battle and killing off pyp and grenn even though theyre both still alive in the books seemed like an easy route but why were their deaths so completely lacking in dramatic quality one is shot through the neck and dies impassively five seconds later staring into space the other is found dead it just didnt feel right if they were going to kill them both off i would have preferred them to space their deaths out a little more than that and sam who was supposed to be as close a friend as either of them had ever had displayed no emotion whatsoever concerning their demise all he responded to emotionally was gilly and that to me makes his character a lot less likable i might have to blame this on john bradleys acting ability though or lack thereof hes not necessarily bad but he by no means has the chops to be one of the main focuses of an entire episode and keep the viewer interested â the cheesy action scenes that didnt make any sense i like to think most people who have read the books are not entertained by things that look cool over that which is logical and still compelling multiple things in this episode were unfortunately put into the episode just because they looked cool the watchman that was shot with a giant arrow landing perfectly 700 ft below impaling the ground the massive scythe flail that miraculously hit every wilding climber in one fell swingâ why would the watch build a weapon of such size and unreliability for one single use at the cost of the walls integrity jons face being smashed into an anvil and coming out of the fight unscathed the tunnel door still functioning as well as ever despite being severely damaged by two giants and a mammoth in order to enjoy these things you must either have no semblance of anâ idea how theyd work in the real world or issue a willing suspension of disbelief because what you are seeing on screen is just so engaging for me nothing on screen was that engaging so i was left to lament on the ludicrosityâ of the episodes many impossible scenariosâ â the length and pacing i never had a problem that they were dedicating a whole 50 uninterrupted minutes to the battle at the wall but i suspected on account of that id see a lot more than i actually did there were a bunch of useless scenes in this episode between characters i could have done without none of them were done well from alliser  jon to sam  aemon seemed like dribble compared to the usual stuff the shows writers think up when it came to the combat the siege on castle black from the south lasted far too long before the battle ygritte counted twenty men at the gate when ser alliser goes down the lift its revealed that there is a force of at least 50 on the ground maybe it would have made sense if the watchmen were actually holding the castle but they were just throwing themselves at wildings in the courtyard i feel like the battle on that side had no progression at all they shot a few arrows in the beginning but after that it was just one big melee that went on foreverâ castle black had no walls on the southern side in the books but upon watching the episode again i can see that they gave them one for the show more time could have been spent on the watchmen holding that wall but it was overran with ease while alliser was busy giving his speech even with a force of 50 warriors on either side it should have been over in a period of ten minutes or less no time to send someone up to the top of the wall and request help no time for slynt to come down and no time to send grenn down with reinforcements the lift goes 700 ft up and 700 ft down each time at a rate of 5 mph or less it seems unlikely that it would be able to make it up and down that many times even given the longitude of the battle if they had cut it down to the point where the end to this episode happened at the 30 minute mark rather than the 50 the episode could have concluded with jon being saved by the bell in mances tent by stanniss cavalry a much better cliffhanger than the one we got edited by gregors nancy boy 09 june 2014  0534 pm"

"Envie",2014-06-09,"i will say i agree with the review analysis done here on the site at least  the directing and action fight scenes were more fluid and well done than the constant cutting done in the oberyn  mountain duel which while fancy looking ended up being rather confusing the fight scenes in this episode were far more solid overall except for the few nitpicks ive seen slomo between ygritte and jon jons face smash on anvil for example"

"Chuck88",2014-06-09,"as i said this moment in the books meant little to nothing to me im not peeved because they changed stuff im peeved because it sucked to put it in laymans terms most of the shit in this episode was fucking retarded and didnt make a damn bit of sense it blows my mind people are calling this one of the best episodes ever but then again should i really be surprised look at the biggest blockbusters of our time take godzilla for example a movie where the writing is pants and one guy does everything from disarming nukes to participating in halo jumps but fuck how about them monster battles am i right you sound like someone who wasnt invited to go along and see godzillaâ if youre going to badmouth what is undoubtedly one of the most impressive even if not to your own taste episodes in the shows history you would do well to come up with better critical analysis than fucking retardedâ â"

own taste episodes in the shows history you would do well to come up with better critical analysis than fucking retardedâ oh shit you mean likeâ this â â overall a horrible episode heres the things i didnt like â every bit of dialogue from the awkward small talk to the misplaced comic relief to the underwhelming battle speeches nothing said in this episode was impactful in any way ygrittes last words about the cave were the only exception to this though the scene was sullied by what was going on around her and jon they killed about ten men each just a few moments ago but its cute that they can still find it in themselves to trade sappy lines right in the middle of the battle â the hollywoodinspired combat sequences nothing seemed real nearly every extra who died on screen did so immediately after being swung on one single time with a sword and it seemed as if they were all specifically instructed by the choreographer in charge to scream absurdly and exaggerate their body movements during battle and while all these supposedly seasoned men were dying left and right jon snow was hacking his foes apart without issue save for the big baddy at the end im sorry but when i read the books jon snow did not strike me as a killing machine its ridiculous how over powered the main characters in this episode were compared to all the random nameless watchmen and wildings if you were facing ser alliser jon snow tormund ygritte or the thenn you didnt stand a chance unless of course you were ser alliser jon snow tormund ygritte or the thenn â the deaths of grenn and pypâ what a lousy way to send off two supporting characters who have been with us from the start i know dd wanted to add some sort of price to be had for the battle and killing off pyp and grenn even though theyre both still alive in the books seemed like an easy route but why were their deaths so completely lacking in dramatic quality one is shot through the neck and dies impassively five seconds later staring into space the other is found dead it just didnt feel right if they were going to kill them both off i would have preferred them to space their deaths out a little more than that and sam who was supposed to be as close a friend as either of them had ever had displayed no emotion whatsoever concerning their demise all he responded to emotionally was gilly and that to me makes his character a lot less likable i might have to blame this on john bradleys acting ability though or lack thereof hes not necessarily bad but he by no means has the chops to be one of the main focuses of an entire episode and keep the viewer interested â the cheesy action scenes that didnt make any sense i like to think most people who have read the books are not entertained by things that look cool over that which is logical and still compelling multiple things in this episode were unfortunately put into the episode just because they looked cool the watchman that was shot with a giant arrow landing perfectly 700 ft below impaling the ground the massive scythe flail that miraculously hit every wilding climber in one fell swingâ why would the watch build a weapon of such size and unreliability for one single use at the cost of the walls integrity jons face being smashed into an anvil and coming out of the fight unscathed the tunnel door still functioning as well as ever despite being severely damaged by two giants and a mammoth in order to enjoy these things you must either have no semblance of anâ idea how theyd work in the real world or issue a willing suspension of disbelief because what you are seeing on screen is just so engaging for me nothing on screen was that engaging so i was left to lament on the ludicrosityâ of the episodes many impossible scenariosâ â the length and pacing i never had a problem that they were dedicating a whole 50 uninterrupted minutes to the battle at the wall but i suspected on account of that id see a lot more than i actually did there were a bunch of useless scenes in this episode between characters i could have done without none of them were done well from alliser  jon to sam  aemon seemed like dribble compared to the usual stuff the shows writers think up when it came to the combat the siege on castle black from the south lasted far too long before the battle ygritte counted twenty men at the gate when ser alliser goes down the lift its revealed that there is a force of at least 50 on the ground maybe it would have made sense if the watchmen were actually holding the castle but they were just throwing themselves at wildings in the courtyard i feel like the battle on that side had no progression at all they shot a few arrows in the beginning but after that it was just one big melee that went on foreverâ castle black had no walls on the southern side in the books but upon watching the episode again i can see that they gave them one for the show more time could have been spent on the watchmen holding that wall but it was overran with ease while alliser was busy giving his speech even with a force of 50 warriors on either side it should have been over in a period of ten minutes or less no time to send someone up to the top of the wall and request help no time for slynt to come down and no time to send grenn down with reinforcements the lift goes 700 ft up and 700 ft down each time at a rate of 5 mph or less it seems unlikely that it would be able to make it up and down that many times even given the longitude of the battle if they had cut it down to the point where the end to this episode happened at the 30 minute mark rather than the 50 the episode could have concluded with jon being saved by the bell in mances tent by stanniss cavalry a much better cliffhanger than the one we got"

"Chuck88",2014-06-09,"in response to post before last no not like that fucking retarded is probably more valid than whatever that was grenns death not dramatic â i know some elements are slightly overconvenient or unrealistic but for one its a fictional show and for the sake of plot sometimes things have to go down a certain way so why not make them visually engaging and if you balance out the cheesiness with character moments which this episode certainly did whether you enjoyed them or otherwise then im all in favour of a guy getting speared through the airâ regardless youre entitled to your opinion and although myself and others might disagree its your call to criticise the shows choices what doesnt make any sense is to get yourself all angry because others did enjoy the episode and believe it or not it was for more than just the visual effectsâ edited by chuck88 09 june 2014  0757 pm"

"Miodrag",2014-06-09,"yeah im going to have to disagree here its also baffling because youre pointing out how unrealistic jon not smashing all his teeth is but your favorite bb seasons are the ones that have the most fake science unrealistic events and requires the most suspension of belief â im neither for nor against unrealistic scenes per se bb was not very realistic from the very beginning and had some heavyhanded writing skyler working on computer while handpleasing walt in the pilot its almost dd level of unsubtle but at least it had a strong themes i could enjoy plain crash is somewhat ridiculous in logistics but on the other hand plain accidents do happen not quite the same as that one but still and it was refreshing to see a protagonist responsible for hundreds of innocent lives and hes the only one whos aware of it and also skyler finally became a character by the end of season two when she leaves him after he comes out of the hospital there was some really good dialogue and progression there admittedly suspension of disbelief was needed from time to time but they made up for it with sharp dialogue great humor great acting cranston and as i said themes i generally like in a way the plain crash was something i put in a category not unlike dragons meaning very little suspension is required yeah planes never collide but even accidents that do happen are caused by human factor and that human factor was believable enough for me  similar to grrms dragons which dont exist but had they exist i imagine theyd be very much like martin describes them that recurring shot of pink teddybear in the pool annoyed me way more than plain crash to be honest â now in season three something went wrong because cousins were a joke i mean speaking of a filler their entire arc was cartoonish and their death especially unarmed man cop or no cop just cant kill two hitmen that were built as practically unstoppable up to that point the overdoing ruined it for me like ok if hank has to kill them for the sake of story but dont make the showdown too dramatic because it always ends up too absurd and comical after that more often than not the plot conveniently went where the show needed it like gus killing the only man whos not needed by the plot even though the poor guy was the only one in that room who didnt fail gus and some subplots like that kid walt poisoned were really too unbelievable i watched through the end because of some brilliant developments like walt outsmarting gus in the end though i really disliked overthetop halfface gus but i really prefer the first two seasons have to say that im a complete amateur when it comes to chemistry so if seasons 1 and 2 were more unbelievable than later seasons because of science i wouldnt know â but not even the weakest bb scenes contain anything as unnecessarily ridiculous as jon against the anvil someone can buy hank killing two hitmen while unarmed or gus killing his own guy just to send a message but no way anyone can buy anvil the way it was filmed its not some big complain because action scenes are usually peppered with ridiculous stuff a la anvil but the most annoying thing is that the scene would possibly be very good if not for that detail opposite to previous episodes duel fight between jon and tenn looked way better even with anvil â about gots credibility in general its a really delicate ground one of the things i adore about asoiaf is that its full of passionate characters that live and die and kill for what they think is right or against what they think is wrong and because of how passionate they are they do all kind of stuff i mean a son kills his father after finding his own exwhore in fathers bed that is not something you read about every day then you have a brother and sister making love by their sons fresh corpse a guy whos too scared to even think of his real name because hes afraid his tormentor will sense that and torture him some more a king who uses some much needed help from a particular god but refuses the will of that god more often than not and so on when you have such characters doing all that you need them to be as grounded in reality as possible martin achieved that with meticulous characterization rooted not only in psychology but also in culture he created for this world since they obviously chose to hit all the main points of the source material dd couldve follow his characterization or come up with their own that would have to be equally brilliant they did neither and the story is therefore unbelievable too often i mean a father fucks his sons exwhore how many father would do that very very few fathers and sons have issues with each other since time immemorial but it takes a very special person to do what tywin did its not very believable that there can be two tywins capable of that and from what i can tell tv tywin is not that kind of person he was unconvincing as someone who chastises his generals how is he going to be believable as shaes new loveremployer is beyond me â compared to what martins characters do walter white and other breaking bad characters and characters of other tv shows are just not on the same level not even close if it works at all its because these characters are as realistic as any dd failed to do that im not sure why they even try to mess with characterization on which asoiaf rests but its obvious they made a chaotic situation with it and in such a chaos a lot of things tend to look unbelievable even though it didnt in the books"

has cringe worthy dialogue and that butand this is important i take the show for what it is by itself in that regard its a good show that flashes greatness here and there and i might be in the minority here but while most people hate the changes i feel that sticking too close to the source material is what brings this show down and the laughably bad writing at times my reason for feeling this is that martin did create a great world with great characters but that this need to always have a big reveal or some action makes it so that much of the dialogue has to be exposition and clunky to beat it into the watchers head within the time limit i think that affects the show more than the things that arent believable i think we only overlook a lot of the unbelievable things in the book because we can read their thoughts we can take our time with them we can understand them as people on the show the book readers basically hate conversations that dont directly move the plot because filler and they hate when things are done but not the way they think the book characters did this is frustrating because not all dialogue has to move the plot i like when some conversations are just about building character look at the great tv shows they all have conversations that this fandom would consider filler if theyd read a book based on those series beforehand i dont think got is an all

thing is i think more about answering the blatant showapologia here ever since the show started and especially after the first season every criticism of the show was met with ridiculous accusations of bookpurism which is as i can tell something that doesnt really exist at least here at the beginning every complain was rebutted with some brilliance a la they dont have the time to include everything from the books you stupid so perhaps its only natural when people start pointing to all the show scenes that really had no purpose put there at the expense of some books scenes that while perhaps not crucial would add something to the story at least in terms of worldbuilding its not that its filler but that its a bad filler that took place from a much better filler from the books â about this being an adaptation it doesnt have to mean anything really for example the budget is what dd agree with hbo and the way they spend it is on them if the budget doesnt allow better battle scenes its really not my fault this is among other things story about a war and a very brutal one at that and its strange that someones trying to portray the said war without actually depicting it and whats more there isnt some insufferable amount of battles in this saga one major battle per book plus one or two were either nearby or often hear about and thats it a dying man exchanging philosophical oneliners with arya cant depict a war the show needed some of those battles not because they happen in the books some of them truth be told were only told about like the oxcross battle but because this is a bloody war that devastates the realm â but ok leave the budget aside theres a bigger issue here and i touched it in some of my earlier posts the show cant cover time and space like books do martin manages to put a lot of stuff in each of those chapters some social and political history some personal history and background some thoughts and intimacy because of all that every chapter is like a mini novella about the character after every chapter i know about the character way more than i did before and i have a feeling i spent much time with himher the show didnt achieve that perhaps it wasnt possible and i honestly dont know of any show or a movie that managed to cover the time and space the way martin does in the books that was the real challenge in this adaptation and perhaps some changes were needed in that regard speaking theoretically because i have no solution of my own i cant hold against dd for failing that but it is a fact that they didnt manage to achieve the same effect martin did with the characters â one possible solution was through dialogue like when tywin tells to tyrion that oberyn was always halfmad it wouldve make wonders for the characterization of oberyn much better than his ridiculous brothel fight with lannister soldiers yeah like someone can die of the hand wound or ned and robert talking about how ned found jaime sitting in the iron throne that one timeâ or everyone in the north talking about how despicable theon is for killing bran and rickon and so on that kind of dialogue helps a lot in many aspects and yet theres nothing like that in the show where dd always seem to be after some harsh reality or some other wisdom â as for the changes were debating here most usually they have nothing to do with any necessity there was no need for amory lorch nonsense dd chose it there was no need for abandoning qhorinjon storyline in favor of ygrittejon storyline they wanted ygritte to die in episode 9 so they postponed the attack from the south until then  and in the meantime for nw to have something to do they invented the ingenious crasters which they though could also serve brans storyline in which they face some objective difficulties truth be told and i could go on but you get my point about the changes if they wanted to change something i have to ask why did they do it and what did they achieve with it and much more often than not the most likely answer is  they did because they can and they managed to ruin much of the logic along the way"

"sj4iy",2014-06-11,"we know well see it next week but i know for me personally id have liked to see stannis the mannis this episode rather than the 20 min of filler with sam gilly alister etc from a pacing standpoint next episode is going to be awfully crowded and disjointed because they still need to wrap up events in kings landing the eyrie and with arya as well i think well see a lot of rushing jumping from scene to scene and viewers missing major plot points in the shuffle i know that in the books stannis didnt come until jon treated with mance but it seemed like a logical place for this episode to end it had a shorter runtime than usual so i was surprised to see the episode end without jon walking out to meet mance then stannis bringing the awesome personally i dont know why people are worried about the pacing of the next episode when they dont even know for sure everything thats in it yet people assuming they knew what this episode contained is the reason why so many people are upset about stannis not being in it in the first place next weeks episode is 66 minutes longeasily enough time to show jon and mance then stannis grand entrance edited by sj4iy 11 june 2014  0118 am"

"Florina Laufeyson",2014-06-11,"initially i thought exactly that about jaime replacing a kingsguard but cant be oakheart if will be than he cant meet his end at areo hotahs axe i would not be surprised if theyll adapt the story and make jaime falling in ariannes graces but if he is definitely going to dorne then my bet is that he will replace swann and other actor will be cast as arys nah it wont be oakheart if jaime ends up in dorne he will be the balon swannâ â oh man i agree so much brienne beating the hound is exactly the sort of thing theyd do just so that they could pat themselves on the back for having so many strong female characters during their circle jerk aka inside the episode gee i dont know maybe he loses to brienne because hes got an infected wound on his neckâ â just saiyan"
"Gregor's Nancy Boy",2014-06-11,"oh yeah like grrm would ever admit that dd failed and the episode is shit he cant say what he thinks you know it kind of brings him money he is close to dd and the popularity of the show grows he might have actually liked it but you cant judge just by him saying so in public he likes to talk about how apprehensive he was when dd first approached him because he was afraid theyd muck up an adaption with their own ambitions and now that its happening right before his very eyes all he can do is condone it whenever hes prodded on how he really feels because thats the only time hell actually say anything he comes off as meek and makes sure to be overly careful with his words also i love howâ neil marshall actually used the term spice up in reference to what he did to the battle of castle black the dude really thought he was improving on what a bestselling novelist wrote edited by gregors nancy boy 11 june 2014  1147 pm"

"Young Nan",2014-06-12,"â gee i dont know maybe he loses to brienne because hes got an infected wound on his neckâ â just saiyan he has been hurt worse and still has won fights he fucked up undead dondarrion with his arm on fire and as for brienne in the books jamie was giving her a run for her money despite being starved and having his hands shackled together thats the books though so i suppose its a different brienne sure she could win because he has an infected wound but i still think they like to make her op because girl power just super saiyan edited by young nan 12 june 2014  1238 am"

material whenever they wanted now well probably never know what did the first pilot look like but im positive that if something was wrong with it it wasnt because of the script and honestly im not

"Fat Trell",2014-06-12,"â youre right that this fandom is really different from other fandoms and i think theres a damn good reason for it asoiaf is way different from other stories that have fandoms fanaticismobsession over it isnt inspired by cool stuff a la light sabers or time travels or secret castles no its inspired by human characters and their tragic fates and themes those fates and those characters emphasizedeliver all that brings a whole new level and nature of investment in the story of course there are no discussion between gimli fans and legolas fans about whos more or less moral between the two of them what debate about harry potter or star wars or star trek can possibly resemble debates about the red wedding or danys war on slavery or tyrion killing shae and tywin i dare to say  none nothing against fans of those stories but this is just a different kind of story asoiaf has much more in common with stories that are usually considered high literature faulkner is someone who martin continually cites as an influence and you can clearly see why gatsby is who martin modeled littlefinger on and littlefinger is who kinda sets everything in motion arya made a faustian deal and the best part is she doesnt even know it lannisters are in a way as corleones wouldve been if vito was not a familycentered man but egomaniac obsessed with personal power and so on you dont find characters like those and developments like those in typical genre stories regardless of the genre asoiaf is not designed for geeks and nerds to tell the truth im not even sure there even is a geeknerd culture outside usa and other englishspeaking countries dont get me wrong we have our own crazy obsessions mainly about sports the world cup will be my religion for the coming month even though my nations team didnt even qualify for the tournament but as far as i know there no fan conventions and similar events certainly not on the us level and yet asoiaf has a fanatical following throughout the world â and it was like that even before the show it wasnt nearly as big as it is today but the popularity that came with the show is a twoedged sword i usually speak about dd because they are the showrunners after all but in essence this is way beyond them the popculture just doesnt know what to do with asoiaf it had to do something because popculture couldnt just ignore a story that is as popular as asoiaf too much money in that potentially but it just doesnt know what to deal with it and youll see what im talking about if you remember the original script for gots pilot episode that was leaked last year that script was much more faithful to the source material than the actual pilot the first version of the pilot was much more faithful but something went wrong someone was dissatisfied with it i cant possibly know if it was the focus group or some hbo executive but the decision was made to change much of the pilot the director was replaced and the script was altered and it was almost completely reshot then and there one can find the root of this debate and every other debate of this kind before that it looked like dd were what you might call bookpurists after that they started deviating from the source material whenever they wanted now well probably never know what did the first pilot look like but im positive that if something was wrong with it it wasnt because of the script and honestly im not even sure there was anything wrong with it that wouldnt be the first time ever tv executives made a wrong decision if hbo was afraid itd loose money with a more faithful adaptation im pretty sure it wouldnt and the popularity of the book series kinda testifies to that â the irony is that asoiaf is a product of the popculture partially at least in that aspect its a lot like tarantinos pulp fiction it belongs to the popculture and it elevates the popculture to a whole new level some works very rare works are a cross between popculture and classics and five books in asoiaf does look like that kind of story id dare to say its the best story of that kind and its a shame hbo didnt recognize that the wire and the sopranos are usually credited as the best tv shows of all time for a good reason because both are truly masterpieces but all due respect for them they have nothing on asoiaf thematically characterizationwise plotwise asoiaf is just more complex and rewarding thanks to martins skill in creating various cultures which societies are always rooted in asoiaf even resonates with our world not a bit less than contemporary dramas like the wire and the sopranos do the wire is brilliant in depicting institutions in our society but asoiaf goes even further and shows how institutions work in any society and why is it so â debates about that kind of story are inevitably going to be passionate and debates about an adaptation that failed to capture much of that richness  and replaced it with cliches andor simplifications  are definitely going to be passionate of course it doesnt mean the venom is welcomed but what creates venom is a basic disrespect for different opinions not impressions but opinions and that disrespect is present in various forms when someone tells me changes are necessary because of a different medium its offensive because it implies i dont understand tv is a separate medium than the books which i really do thank you very much but also because it prevents any reasonable discussion because medium dictates changes is a highly theoretical assumption that doesnt have to do anything with a very practical examples pointed at on these boards yeah in theory some changes may be justified because of the difference between a visual medium and a textual one but until you bring up a particular change like that youre only ruining a discussion if you keep repeating that medium dictates changes and that may be offensive because i was perhaps looking forward to the discussion you just ruined and basically by repeating a standard theoretical excuse that doesnt have any significance for a particular discussion perhaps in effect youre showing it is you who dont understand the natures of different mediums â not to mention that the significant portion of complaints here deals exactly with he medium of television and with got as a separate entity one man striking another against an anvil doesnt have to be ridiculous especially if its depicted by a short textual line and left for our imagination to picture the scene it in our heads but the way it was actually filmed its all kinds of ridiculous new nitpick in that regard why didnt styr just continue striking jons head against the anvil the essence is lost here television like any other medium is not a breathing entity that follows its own logic tv is what they put on screen and what we watch as with any other medium its about humans humans film it and humans watch it there are conventional wisdoms and guidelines created out of practice but theorizing about necessary changes is disregarding the human aspect and its strange to say the least to find that notion delivered by readers of asoiaf how does asoiaf delve deeper into institutions than the wire i dont see that at all"
"Khaleesi did nothing wrong",2014-06-12,"i personally think the show is massively over criticised i sit and watch and yeah when sansa saved littlefingner i was thinking erm as if littlefinger hasnt got a plan and this hound is too nice etc loads of this wasnt how it went down in the books but i still enjoy the show massively it doesnt use the books as a screen play but its still even now pretty damn close to the source material imo i 100 agree with the notion that a lot of the changes have no consequence for the characters involved like aryatywin no change for either character scenes night as well have not happened from a narrative point of view tbf jon learned to spit in peoples faces at crasters keep i enjoyed those scenes karl fooking tanner should be a pov in twow the show is overly focuses in tyrion and dany as well i think mainly tyrion this season as well littlefinger isnt as devious etc its still very entertaining and a lot of the times they do pull it off really well i love how it allows some of my mates who would never read the novels to experience the story even if it isnt 100 exact karl tanner is easily the best new character the show has come up with he carried that filler arc by himself pretty muchâ"
"Lady Fevre Dream",2014-06-12,"tsss youre losing your grip wolfox6 as punishment for missing their 50th installment you have to watch 300 and take a shot everytime a male nipple is visible on screen â â are you telling me that persian goat people arent a real thing im geniunely shocked â â depends on what you are looking at really like i would never question the battle scenes in spartacus the series that is and 300 those fight scenes are supposed to be over the top and unrealistic they never claim they want to make a realistic version of the spartacus revolt or the battle of thermopylae its all about kickass ninja spins double beheadings and over the top visuals â got on the other hand is different this is the show that claims its a serious drama that its gritty realistic and unpredictable so they open themselves up to a higher level of scrutiny when it comes to their battle sequences dont get me wrong i wouldnt expect them to be 100 realistic grrm isnt either btw most viewers would probably be shocked if they did that because actual sword fighting is nothing like what we see in hollywood â what i do want to get is a sense of danger from the fights â and a sense of strategy from the battles an observant poster in this very thread has pointed out all the flaws in the â thenns attack on cb namely the fact that they had no plan eg they didnt try to take the elevator out or lay claim on the tunnel and the flaws off the actual fights have been discussed at length as well â how am i supposed to suspend my disbelief if jon tormund styr ygritte and alliser are all unstopable killing machines bosses who can only lose when fighting against other bosses whats even worse is the way they take out all their opponents when jon gets out of that lift the wildlings attacks them and he kills them all with one slash of his sword not only is the one hit  one kill thing a terrible cliche its also unrealistic they never seem to wound anybody its always slash and theyre dead we never see them really exchange blows with nameless opponents its always just random enemy comes at them screaming and jonstyr cut them down in one swoop â furthermore they are also terribly inconsistent with their skills like jon kills all those redshirts and he goes up against styr and he gets his ass handed to him they arent even they dont really exchange blows styr just whales on him and then he throws jon in that fire and walks over there to give him a good beat down while he has this huge knife on his belt ready to use and then it gets even worse because styr goes down because of one smash with the hammer in the side now that would hurt in real life but 5 seconds ago jon got his head smacked against an anvil without even breaking a sweat just takes me out of the moment â in this entire episode there were only two good fight scenes one involved supercook and his giant meat cleaver that was realistic the way he threw that boiling stew in the guys face and funny that giant meat cleaver is a marvel the other was alliser vs tormund its totally unrealistic of course even without a shield alliser should make short work of tormunds little blade and then theres some terrible choreography with the stab around the pole and tormund rolling away from him if you do that in a real fight youll be dead as a dodo but when they actually engaged with each other tormunds acting was convincing enough to forget about all that and make it fun to watch â there arent really persian goat peopleâ ill be crying over that off in a corner soon but still grateful that ive only seen bits of the movie 300 on cableâ i have seen enough to know that lack of goat doesnt just apply to sapphires and got lol â i did just want to thank you for your answerâ this question about battle analysis has been on my mind since episode 8 and the thread that was more specific to the duel itselfâ the more i read it the more i wondered if some of it was a guy thing for want of a

being a girl lol i do know that its a messy up close and in the face personal bit of bloody business face to face for those that are involved in itâ it most likely wouldnt be something real world

save molestown and locke gets newfound respect for jon eventhough he still hates nobles at this point jon puts ghost away because the villagers are affraid of him especially lockes son should be frightened invent something about how the boy got bit by ramsays dogs once â introduce the thenns and let them please not be superevil cannibals in fact they should have emphasised the thenns society let the magnar be the godlike figure he is in the books a father to his people make the thenn warriors old like styr only took the men of his generation with him so that the young warriors could stay with their faimilies take time for a scene where tormund and styr make plans for battle instead of that idiotic sshhht scene between ygritte and gilly and then give styr a speech in the old tongue something about how their families would have to die no more after today and that they would be safe in the south you know give them a heart  â then attack cb since the thenns werent there at molestown the attack is unexpected because they though tormunds band was to small to pose a threat and we have a reason why the nw hadnt properly prepared they get inside the slaughter follows thorne goes downstairs gives jon the wall and takes slynt with him who disappears after that until sam finds him when he steps out the lift let him give his speech the fight rekindles have the cook scenes here and eventually alliser is killed by tormund â then we have the wildlings trying to break through the gate locke goes downstairs armed with spears and he takes some men including grenn with him the giant smashes through the gate no ridiculous gate lifting and hes accompanied by a couple of wildlings 34 max that survived the initial downpour of hot oil and arrows let locke and company recite the nw vows that was a good addition while the giant charges forwards â meanwhile sam and pyp are somewhere in the cb trying to reach the lift pyp gets shot by ygritte but he doesnt die sam goes up and tells jon what happens jon leaves the wall to dolorous edd intro a funny edd line and he takes as many men as possible because they are about to storm the barricade and take the tunnel â in the lift have lockes son stand next to him and then let jon give him the old you can only be brave when youre affraid line callback to ned  shows how much jon has grown and at the same time stayed the same jon hands sam the key they get out of the lift and sam is immediately held back to help the wounded you spend so much time reading you ought to know a bit about patching them up he hands the key to lockes boy jon attacks â lockes boy hurries to get to the shed ygritte spots him and shoots at him he shoots back they exchange several arrows until he ducks and manages to release ghost who storms out ygrittes distracted by the first clash between styr and jon and the boy then picks up his bow and climbs on the roof in the mean time jon meets styr he and ghost fight together and barely manage to overcome the magnar ideally jon would employ a dirty trick like sending ghost to attack a wounded man to kill styr â the battle is running on its last legs keep the scene where jon shoots tormund then samwell comes and calls for jon they go behind the building and there they find ygritte barely clinging to live jon kneels besides her he sees the arrow clearly recognizable as one of lockes boys arrows who would have a different color than the others since he made them himself and they exchange last words end episode nine â begin episode 10 with sam and jon going through the tunnel they find locke inside the tunnel like they found donal nooye all the others are death except for maybe grenn whos severly injured jon gives longclaw to sam and hides a dagger he sets out and then we have stannis stannis stannis â next season we have slynt left to behead alliser and locke are dead grenns out of the picture and edd and the boy provide back up to jon the role of bowen marsh is taken over by pyp he was always scared of the wildlings and after his wound he started to hate them even more add â to that that it was ygritte who shot him and you get a personal motive for his attack on jon â edit oh and how id handle brans storyline in this case â 1 they get caught by the deserters 2 burn gorman speech with the addition that others tried to challenge him for leadership of the mutineers before and that he killed them all fights over wine and women and you have an explanation for why there are just four or five of them 3 gorman interrogates them and makes his desire for meera known 4 next episode gorman comes in their hut in the mids of night accompanying him is one of the scared daughter of crasters gorman tries to rape meera bran uses the hodor force to kill him crasters daughter is frightened by hodor but bran calms him down and they leave her be while they get out 5 bran frees summer and they walk by the hut they see a dead guard on the ground crasters women bar the exits and then they set fire to the place you see bran and company walking away and then it slowly fades to black with the sounds of screams and a roaring fire in the background â â â edited by

"Fat Trell",2014-06-14,"â the wire depicts rather brilliantly whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong with the institutions of today that they are constantly used for the benefits of a few while interests of the public are almost completely disregarded even though institutions are meant to serve the public first and foremost that theme is the main one in the show and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s analyzed through five seasons with multitude of angles covered â<U+0080><U+0093> but mostly perhaps exclusively even from the perspective of the socalled middle management we never see whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s at the very top of the food chain in asoiaf we do institutions even those most powerful and therefore most distant are just humans even at the very top thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s always some tywin or aerys or drogo or doran or whoever pulling the strings their fears and frustrations and secrets are also depicted and calculated in the closest thing we get in the wire in that regard are the greek and avon and marlo hypothetically if they were somehow created by grrm weâ<U+0080><U+0099>d probably know their entire family trees their childhood secrets their sexual prerogatives and so on â hope you realize iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not criticizing the wire they chose their theme and explored it thoroughly but as david simon said in the universe of the wire institutions are like gods in greek tragedies entities that are above influence and for the middle management which was the focus of the show it is true but for the main players it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t and asoiaf does bring their perspective too and we often see them in dramatic circumstances when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re facing tough choices and where their weaknesses as well as their strengths are at full display â also the perspective of the common people is somewhat in the back in the wire there are sobotkas in season two and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cutty and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s it as far as i can remember basically the question why do we obey institutions in the first place if we all know how corrupted they are is never asked in asoiaf it is not only asked theoretically varysâ<U+0080><U+0099> riddle but there are also practical examples of people accepting institutions for the first time in their lives wildlings in adwd freed slaves from slaverâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bay and we also have institutions that went through significant changes and are therefore forced to fight for legitimacy in the eyes of the publictheir subjects robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rebellion as a crucial event from the past that is frequently visited through various recollections and each of the five kings in the present and iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d say individuals like barristan also belong in this category â thanks to its scope and scale asoiaf deals with various forms of institutions some of which are missing from the wire family as the basic institution of any society in the wire we get a closer look only at the barksdales state governments religious authorities military orders even financial superpowers a la iron bank there are some institutions present in the wire that are missing from asoiaf â<U+0080><U+0093> education and the media â<U+0080><U+0093> but i guess they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fit well into a medievallike world â because of all that asoiaf probably has a wider appeal the wire depicts very specific institutions in a very specific era modern urban environments as herc says of course it resonates with me because i live in a city one more testament to the brilliance of the wire iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a journalist and i met quite a few politicians and other public officers in my career â<U+0080><U+0093> and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re perfect images of carceti and rawls and clay davis and valchek not to mention the media themselves which are depicted extremely faithfully but people from small towns or villages or other not so urban areas donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to feel the same connection i do and from my experience they rarely do not that they dislike the show itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s written masterfully and easy to like even if it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t resonate with oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s life too much but asoiaf similar to the sopranos for example deals with things like families which practically everyone can relate to â one more thing in asoiaf we see some institutions being challenged to their very limits nw most of all speaking from a country that had more than its fair share of political and social disturbances in my lifetime i find that perspective brilliantly explored in asoiaf â once more i adore and greatly respect the wire i just love and respect asoiaf even more and its take on institutions is one of the reasons why i have to disagree in asoiaf we study people we see how their actions effect others we dont see how their actions are carried out in great detail we dont study institutions in depth we view them in relation to individuals whereas in the wire almost every character is defined by their relationship to their institution they are their role while we dont see the president or anyone who is actually at the top of the food chain in the wire for the setting we definetly see the top dogs we meet and explore the police commisioner the mayor the union head the top westside and eastside drug dealers while middle management in the grand scheme theyre hardly so in the setting while we might meet a wider range of institutions in asoiaf do we study any of them as closely as we do drugdealing organizations or the police in the wire what do we actually know about how the iron bank functions we absolutely see institutions being pushed to their edge on the wire the hamsterdam and the new day coop plots were entirely about individualscolvin and bell respectivally trying to change institutions from within i absolutely love both series as well i just dont find them comparable in the slightest the wire is a very much a narrative driven story with enthralling characters asoiaf is a character driven story with an enthralling narrative for example david simon stated that despite stringer bell being an incredibly popular character he had to die because to let him live would have served character not story grrm himself has statediirc that his characters drive his plot many here actuallywrongly imo complain that martin has lost control of the plot because of how he favors character over story"

"Miodrag",2014-06-15,"in asoiaf we study people we see how their actions effect others we dont see how their actions are carried out in great detail we dont study institutions in depth we view them in relation to individuals whereas in the wire almost every character is defined by their relationship to their institution they are their role â this is where i partially disagree we do study people in asoiaf as you say but it goes further because majority of those people occupy prominent positions in the society their actions have serious consequences for the entire realms then there are people who find themselves in dire straits because their loyalty to the orderinstitution they belong to is challenged loyalty is one of the main themes of asoiaf and most of the characters are in one way or another forced to choose will they follow what they think is right or what writtenunwritten rules command jaimes so many vows monologue is the essential dilemma every public official is facing at some point what to honor yourself or your position and his choice had consequences not only for himself but for the entire society as well and hes still haunted for the choice he made and we have an opposite example in barristan who always chooses an institution over himself and yet in adwd we see his mind was never completely in peace with his decisions theres also aemon and basically the entire nights watch whose loyalty to the institution they serve is continually questioned and there are institutions like the city watch that arent in focus too much but we still find out great deal about them in agotacok games played around and the corruption of the city watch are among the crucial aspects of the fight for power but the city watch itself is not a onedimensional entity on the contrary its purpose and efficiency and rules and internal logic are all depicted â while we might meet a wider range of institutions in asoiaf do we study any of them as closely as we do drugdealing organizations or the police in the wire what do we actually know about how the iron bank functions â as much as about people asoiaf is about the societies and cultures those people are part of i dont think itd be possible any other way when a writer ignores the importance the culture bears for the characters it always ends up with abominations like talisa in a contemporary drama the culture and society dont have to be described in details because we all know what police is or should be and what the prime ministersecretary of state is or should be when writing about a fictional world the writer has to create a realistic believable culture and a realistic believable society that stems from the said culture unfortunately many writers fail to do that properly grrm is among the rare exceptions id say hes second to none in that regard and institutions are an integral part of the societies he created his institutions are rawer more primitive then modern ones but in essence  because of the human aspect  they are not unlike our institutions on the contrary theyre more similar to modern institutions than not the city watch can stand for police nights watch can stand for a military service kingsguard can stand for secret service and all of those institutions along with various governments and other forms of authority religions are seen upclose there are entities like iron bank that are at the outskirts at least for now but even in that case we see their reasoning and logic â we absolutely see institutions being pushed to their edge on the wire the hamsterdam and the new day coop plots were entirely about individualscolvin and bell respectivally trying to change institutions from within â colvin did try to change the way things function but his attempt didnt endanger the institution of police bell is a somewhat different case in that regard because he tried to create a new institution in new day coop an unofficial institution but still and payed dearly for it while both plots are brilliant and smartly interwoven i was talking about the challenge the nights watch is facing like all the time  either because of neglect or because of physical threat theyre fighting for the bare existence the only institution in the wire that is challenged in its very core and fighting for the bare existence is the unions in season 2 of which i forgot the last time â i absolutely love both series as well i just dont find them comparable in the slightest the wire is a very much a narrative driven story with enthralling characters asoiaf is a character driven story with an enthralling narrative for example david simon stated that despite stringer bell being an incredibly popular character he had to die because to let him live would have served character not story grrm himself has statediirc that his characters drive his plot many here actuallywrongly imo complain that martin has lost control of the plot because of how he favors character over story â i think theyre very comparable even though they are vastly different  but different things can also be compared especially if their respective foundations are similar or perhaps identical even and both asoiaf and the wire are brilliant in depicting the culture those institutions from the wire would mean nothing if not for the people that represent them thats why simon and co had to invent so many memorable characters and they did martin also goes well beyond pure characters yes his characters are brilliantly complex but if the story was only about them it wouldnt be as good as it is i know many think asoiaf is just a character study but there i there i very much disagree characters carry the narrative and readers usually associate closely with them to the point of becoming genuine fans of this character or that one but theres so much more to this story than just characters just look at drogo and how similar his story is to bells drogo too wanted to change things in a way that he wanted for his people to do something theyve never done before sailing but he also wanted to stay the same to preserve everything dothraki stand for war and plundering  and at the end he couldnt have it both ways â not you but many characterobsessed readers do complain about martin loosing control of the plot lately however i dont think thats the case at all just look at slavers bay arc its not only about dany but also about what it really takes to truly end an oppression its about the oppressed and the oppressors as much as it is about dany looking through those lenses slavers bay is among the most favorite parts of asoiaf for me jons adwd arc is also amazing in that regard because its not only about him and his leadership abilities but also about the people wildlings who accepted to lose some liberty in order to gain some security affc is as much about the ancient question of the cost of victory as it is about jaime and cersei as characters i happen to think the first three books are also about bigger ideas and ideals but because of the crazy rich plot in those books it was perhaps harder to notice that but after affc and especially adwd i think its obvious asoiaf is much more than a character study its usually perceived as it is about the ideas and ideals that hold any society together â martins characters are as memorable precisely because theyre the products of their culture and because they stand for those ideals and ideas or against them and they operate through the various institutions the society created the wire is about institutions in a modern society but those institutions are so vivid and realistic precisely because theyre represented by well rounded characters and ideals behind the institutions ideals that are sadly so often ignored completely thats why i find them so comparable even though theyre also vastly different and here are some character parallels id like to know what you and everyone else who watched and loved the wire think about it â yeah spoiler alert if you didnt watch the wire best skip this part â robert  avon a king well past his prime but doesnt know it ned  frank sobotka fighting a battle he didnt want and only accepted it for the greater good but the battle was rigged and he didnt know too honest for his own good  even though ned is infinitely more honorable than frank what frank did was not too dishonest he wasnt ok with those bodies or with heroin sandor  omar slave to no institution his own code is the most important thing for him  i guess dd also found some similarity there which is why they foolishly borrowed omars a man must have a code line for sandor tyrion  mcnulty unconventional intelligence too often trapped in a conventional environment and a lot of explosive results come from it theon  prez thorn between his family and his other family ramsay  marlo this is selfexplanatory probably â of course im not saying theyre identical character by no means because they are rich enough to be very different but there is some similarity that in a way hopefully speaks about what i want to convey in this post that characters in asoiaf are as important because of the importance they have for the universe they exist in just like the institutions depicted in the wire are as vivid because of the characters theyre represented through â by the way perhaps itd be good idea to open a separate thread for this discussion i mean this one is probably going to be closed soon"
"Blockfetcher",2014-06-15,"what annoys me most is how poor the writing has fallen from season 1 people keep saying that the original scenes have the worst writing and the ones straight from the book are the best but just look at season 1 the scene between tywin and jaime cersei and robert or season 2 arya and tywin they have the potential to write really really good original scenes but this season i find myself rolling my eyes at most of the dialogue especially in this episode its definitely lost some of its magic maybe because they know how popular the show is now and so they can get away with lower quality writingâ â not only that but they mess with conversations in the book that really dont need to be messed with the last conversation between ygritte and jon was much better in the books and there was no reason why they couldnt have just used the same conversation in the book it makes no sense"

"Duron Qel-Droma",2014-06-11,"on a rewatch i noticed that the scene with the giant shooting a black brother from the wall down to castle black with his big arrow must have changed his place in the production it now takes place as the skirmish in the courtyard of castle black is at his height but you can already see a glimpse of the impaled body just before alliser gives his great speech so it seems the scene with the giant arrow was rearranged to be later in the episode"

"Envie",2014-06-11,"i think the numbers counted vs the numbers they state they have in the show are fairly accurate and i appreciate both show fans counting and the show creators making sure they didnt overdo it and kill off too many to leave it unbelievable â my problem is that theyve given little to no focus on the other keeps along the wall so it appears like in the show there are 50 or so men left which is not very believable non book readers wont remember or know there are other nw at the other keeps albeit not many and might be calling bs right now on how they managed to defend the wall when it seemed like a helluva lot more wildlings came into the keep from the other side its not a huge nitpick of mine and counting the actual numbers doesnt change much  were left hanging much where we were in the book without knowing how they will survive more nights of attack before stannis shows up magically im actually glad they didnt show him there in the end  it will make next episode the finale much better edited by envie 11 june 2014  0616 pm"

"Janicia",2014-06-11,"part of the explanation for any action sequence ever filmed is that it looks cool this way â movies and tv are supposed to look good â it is part of the art form just the wordcraft of a book should feel good â â given that the wildlings are meritocratic and the nights watchmen experienced in combat are mostly dead it is entirely plausible that tormond styr jon and allister would be significantly better than their comrades on the battlefield â the nights watch could have better utilized their defenses and the wildlings could have used better tactics but the battle was fun to watch and the battle outcome was largely consistent with the book â if the universe of asoiaf were real that battle would probably have as little resemblance to the book description as it had with the show version â theyre both stylized by people trying to make entertaining art â"

"Jaqen Hghar",2014-06-12,"things being they way they are i still have some reality issues with the outcome of the battle in this episode considering that the wall is about 200 metres high you dont need a largeâ garrisonâ to fend off even an attacking force the size of mances wildling army the top of the wall is unreachable for archers with the exception of the giants bow we saw in action and any attempt to climb it gives the defenders on the top plenty of time to have you fall to a certain death by dropping stones shooting arrows  or releasing a big mfing anchor on a chain that sweeps you away like flies  so presenting even the slightest target on the top of the wall for a giants bow to aim at is sheer stupidity and the rest should be a piece of cake as far as defending the wall comes â no the only vulnerable point  as we also see in the episode  is the tunnel its pretty incomprehensible to me why more wildlings didnt follow the giant into the tunnel once he managed to pry the gate open out of sheer rage sure they might have been keeping a distance to be out of bow range but had they used any ability of thinking the would have stormed forward as soon as they noticed there was a chance to get through furtheremore this would be the reason mance leads his army to one single spot like this  considering their numbers they could have had people climb the wall spread out over tens of miles if they thought that was really going to do any good â and finally  the defence of castle black on the ground was planned and carried out in a totally amateurish manner if you have walls even as low as the ones cb has in the show compared to the wall that is you still have a tremendous advantage over attackers and neither here should it take a large force to fend off a band of at most a few dozen wildlings instead it seemed that only a minority of the force was deployed to the walls while the rest were waiting in the yard for the wildlings to break through the gate  completely giving up the advantage of the walls now i do realise that in the books cb isnt as far as i understand really fortified at all to the south since the threat is considered to come from the north  where the wall is but then why notâ acknowledge this in the show instead of adding walls that the defenders then fail to utilize"

"Zombies That Were Promised",2014-05-03,"ah fantastic this was opened so early â im withâ vaelya of asshai im only interested to see the wall and dragonstone come together as its a milestone of story convergence i got serious goosebumps from barristan joining daenerys alone i think us book readers are deeply invested in the story and thus care about the wall and what happens there as an unsullied i ignored all nights watch scenesstill have a really hard time watching them and on casual unsullied forums such as neogaf i see the least favorite storyline is jon sam and the nights watch it is truly dull grenn and pyp who the wildlings  that redhead archer girl and mince raider havent seen em they can fight they can die i wont care so for an entire episode dedicated to jon sam  co  well sure is a good thing they placed it as the prestigious episode 9 people will tune in anyway i agreeâ blackwater worked because you had kings landing as the sole locationwhich is already the central location of the show and i personally only liked that one for cerseisansashaes scenes and the wildfire explosion itself the battle was generic â so yeah bundle of negativity here imâ begging for this episode to win me over and to be proven very veryâ wrong about the casual audience response which matters more than our opinions imo edited by zombies that were promised 03 may 2014  0702 pm"

"Konradsmith",2014-05-05,"still i wonder when exactly theyll cut to black as the newly crowned king tommen said above stans arrival will be the episodes climax not necessarily its ending i listed reasons above why i doubt jon mourning ygritte will end the episode but i still cant figure out what will actually cap it off blackwater had the charge but the actual ending wasâ tywin with his line we have won and lena headeys great reaction shot i wonder what exactly will put the button on stans victory edited by konradsmith 05 may 2014  0628 pm"

"Konradsmith",2014-05-05,"maybe stan will take mance prisoner himself or something book stan wouldnt stand a chance against mance nor could jon but hell show stan cut a guys head in two"
"King Tommen",2014-05-05,"i think jons going to be on the other side of the wall with mance when the stannis charge comes weve seen him going through the tunnels alone on a horse in the trailers so i dont think theyll be able to have it skip so far ahead to get him back to castle black find ygritte before she dies most likely that scenes happens earlier in the episode before he heads out to treat with mance â maybe the last scene is a quick exchange between jon and mance after mance sees his army decimated and scattered or even better maybe stannis riding up to jon in the aftermath and giving him a stannislike line"

"Ser Couch Potato",2014-05-05,"it might end just as blackwater did stannis coming through the wall showing himself to whoever wasnt able to identify his banners they might even cut to slavers bay or bran up north just to give the viewers something else to expect in the finale â i do hope we see him leading the attack though just like he was one of the first climbing up the walls of kings landing i think thats gonna earn him even more respect from the viewers edited by ser couch potato 05 may 2014  1027 pm"

"Arkash",2014-05-06,"i agree the charge will happen around 10 minutes before the end lots of action battle calms down jon walks through the corpses finds ygritte while in the background men chants stannis that would be a great ending imo combining jon and stannis in the final shot of the episode"

"~No One~",2014-05-07,"ive seen this worry come up a few times and ive gotta say its been handled quite well in the past most recently s3 ep 10 and s4 ep 1 were a couple of great examples of touching on almost every story line without it seeming to jump around too much if we think about it logistically we have the following stories to see in the end 1 stannis jon mel davos who knows sam etc at the wall 2 arya possibly with the hound possibly already on her own 3 sansa lf lysa waynwoods royces 4 tyrion cersei jamie tywin varys margaery tommen 5 dany dragons jorah 6 bran bloodraven 7 reek and ramsey thats only 7 disparate story lines even if they throw in brienne and pod for an 8th story to follow that is 8 minutes of screen time per group that is a long time on the screen for comparison the arya and the hound at the inn episode 1 was just under 10 minutes long that is including the intro of them riding stranger standing outside of the inn watching polliver piss the inn the molesting of the innkeeps daughter the fight and riding away with two horses not every segment will be this long and some will be longer id imagine tyrion will have extended screenplay and we may not even see from reek or brienne"
"Arkash",2014-05-07," im quite sure brienne and pod will be the ones to encounter ls at the end of episode 10 â season 5 is gonna be so tight its a good idea to shorten briennes arc and have the first meeting with ls through her eyes â i think we will see brienne and pod hearing about the brotherhood in episode 7 rumors of lady stoneheart â have an ambush with rorge and biter in episode 8 biting ears off and be rescued at the last moment by the brotherhood anguy perhaps â and see them again at the very end of the season meeting ls and thoros"

"Konradsmith",2014-05-09,"btw all the attack on moles town is episode eight from the footage weve seen of it in trailers ygritte uses a spear and yes takes down an innocent woman by the looks of it in the weapons and training video we see a shot of ygritte with a spear and other wildlings going between thatched roof buildings on a monitor the monitor says 408 on it i hope we see that south of the wall wildling crew at least once between now and then but who knows ygritte hasnt said a word since episode one edited by konradsmith 09 may 2014  1221 am"

"King Tommen",2014-05-18,"i dont think its a bad thing to show the sequence of ygrittes death the show isnt locked into the pov structure and we dont always absolutely have to only see things through jons eyes â i didnt particularly think it was an amazing choice by george to have her shot offscreen and have jon discover her later just because thats the way they portrayed it in the books doesnt always make it the best way to go about things â its far more powerful to give you the boys pov in this sequence where he spots her as part of the raid and is focused on finally getting his shot at her being the person who ruthlessly murdered his father in front of him â that to me is a way better option than jon sifting through the aftermath and saying hey look at this somehow ygritte got taken out in the chaos guess ill say my goodbyes now"
"Stormland's Fury",2014-05-18,"â that to me is a way better option than jon sifting through the aftermath and saying hey look at this somehow ygritte got taken out in the chaos guess ill say my goodbyes now â tv is a different medium so not everything works like in the books agreed but the issue is the uncertainty of jon knowing and him having to live with it the way the show would go about is that someone flat out spells it out for him thus just taking away from the gravity of the fact tvshow or not â the important part is still jon and ygritte being on different sides of a conflict where either one or both can get killed if they go with the revenge thing at least they should leave jon be uncertain and the audience uncertain if he knows"
"King Tommen",2014-05-18,"i didnt really feel like in the books the big conflict with jon was whether he thought he was the one who might have killed ygritte it was the melancholy with knowing that this was more or less inevitable them being on opposite sides and her being apart of the wildling attack and his regret about what could have been between them â hes despondent that she died but i dont think the possibility that he killed her is that haunting for him"

"The Onion Sleight",2014-05-20,"about stannis davos people skills and abilities i know that isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a stannis thread but nevertheless i always wanted to write this â â what i really loved about their scene with the iron bank was that before davos gave his speech tycho said to him â<U+0080><U+009C>here in braavos we do not reward thieves with titlesâ<U+0080><U+009D> itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a situation davos experiences all the time since he became a knight and actually before stannis makes him to his hand he never stands up to those who insult him with â<U+0080><U+009C>smugglerâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>thiefâ<U+0080><U+009D> or whatever nearly quite the opposite he knows himself and always says that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an up jumped

davos never saw himself as a knight he will maybe never see himself as a lord but he absolutely begins to see himself as the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand which is why i disagree when people say davos is one of the few characters who doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t change with the books cause he does â if somebody as axell florent or another of stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> lords insults him laughs about him or talks behind his back he has not so much problems with this his own pride and his position doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter for him but as hand he knows he has to represents stannis his king without many things to offer to others and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s absolutely good in convincing people we see that also with lord borrell and of course lord manderly â at the mermanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s court davos thinks â â<U+0080><U+009C>the onion knight would have bend his knee but a kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand could not to do so would suggest that the king he served was less than this fat lordâ<U+0080><U+009D> â they manderlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s court also insult him as smuggler and his answer is very similar to his answer to tycho davos doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind being reminded of his former crimes but if somebody says stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> treatment with him was wrong then he disagrees heavy because that insults not him but his king as hand he has to show strength and stand up against the lords who see him as â<U+0080><U+009C>the admirals without shipsâ<U+0080><U+009D>  â<U+0080><U+009C>hand without fingersâ<U+0080><U+009D> and stannis as â<U+0080><U+009C>the king without

highborns in asos he felt he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fitting as hand  stannis says thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no man more fitting  in adwd davos improves that all the time â â<U+0080><U+009C>here in braavos we do not reward thieves with titlesâ<U+0080><U+009D> is something davos cannot let unanswered because this insults stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> justice and his punishmentreward is everything for davos same as his kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s justice â so the scene at the iron bank is actually similar to the chapter with manderlys court and the show shows davos ability in talking and convincing thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his talent and he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t manage this with flattering and courtesies he manages it with his good people skills he says he learnt reading people before learning to read words and as a smuggler and man from flea bottom he never had a lot of resources yet always known how to make the most of them whether itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s onions or arguments for supporting stannis â and as hand you have to speak with your kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s voice which is davos totally able to we also see this at sweet sister and white harbor when he lies about sallaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s support but thinks heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d tell the truth about the burnt godwoods because he knows stannis would not have him lie and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also this scene where wyman asks what could stannis offer to them and davos answers â â<U+0080><U+009C>the chance to do your dutyâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080> that was the answer stannis would have given wyman manderly the hand should speak with the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s voice â thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s exact the answer stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>d have given but it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t enough for manderly and later

best kinghand couple they strengths and weaknesses compensate each other i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind the 4x06 scene i loved it but i definitely wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind showing davos as charge leader  attack planer  aso but which wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t happen anyway â the show definitely undermines stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> capabilities yes especially when it comes to making decisions by his own but i want to say that his talents lie in other areas â i always wanted to readsee how he convinced the mountain clans if he really ate their bread drank their ale praised their sonsâ<U+0080><U+0099> strengths and their daughtersâ<U+0080><U+0099> beauty and listened to their pipers aso stannis learns through the books which said eg bryan cogman too and actually bends more yes yes even the iron mannis does it sometimes and does more and more actively by his own to show how he deserves that people fight for him and his cause that the north has still a king who cares and that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the king who defends his realm and people and his people skills are getting better imo or lets say his realisings  insights about how he has to act as king and what he has to do help him in his development successes and behaviour with others nevertheless i think when he was with the mountain clans he was still the guy heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s always who expects people to do their duty and obey the law and as vassal itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s your duty to serve your liege lord or in this case saving your liege lordâ<U+0080><U+0099>s little daughter which is the main argument for the mountain clans and the argument i think he used to win them on his side â stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> people skills are way way smaller than davos who has a great knowledge of human nature but the fact that he raised davos and recognize his worth shows they are better than many often say imo is stannis good in seeing other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worths letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forget imry florent for a moment which is an important ability as king and military commander just the same as listening to others advides and benefit of davosmelsjons suggestions â that same with inspiring loyalty which stannis does well eg his half fleet burns many of his soldiers are dying and everyone is afraid but he â<U+0080><U+0093>now i mean on the show crys â<U+0080><U+009C>come with me and take this cityâ<U+0080><U+009D> jumps in the boat and everyone follows his king heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no rhetorical genius but he shows determination his great military talents and he fights together with his soldiers we saw him fighting with them at the front in â<U+0080><U+009C>blackwaterâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+0093>first at the beach first up the ladder aso  and we see him marching starving soon fighting with them in adwdtwow with 17 years old he hold ss with 500 men and okay i wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t deny this catapultstory about the guys who wanted to surrender but despite this he managed to motive and command his peopleâ<U+0080> and later in the whole story we see him with an army of stromlords crownlords some reachlords northmen clansmen asha and later some ironborn more he has worshippers of the seven râ<U+0080><U+0099>hllor the old god the drowned god they are conflicts theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re starving their army is smaller than rooseâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080><U+0093> but stannis is super confident and certain of victory and fearless and seem to have everything under control especially in the twow sample chapter where heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in an excellent mood for stannis standards even sorta happy and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no melisandre and no davos he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to rely on melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s powers but on his queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need rely on davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> abilities but on his manderlymission when stannis is in power and has men on this side then we see the â<U+0080><U+009C>bestâ<U+0080><U+009D> stannis â many people change for the worse when they get power stannis is one of the few who absolutely change for the better and shows he can handle power well itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the times when he has nothing where he needs davosmel more and considers things and ways which are morally bad and one of his characteristics is definitely that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s good in making â<U+0080><U+0093>or forcing himself to do things he actually despises or hates but sees them as necessary and does what he thinks he must do â â okay man sorry for the lost post but i always wanted to say that all so the long and the short of it â thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing wrong imo with davos speaking for stannis he does it in the books as well okay at the mermanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s court is stannis absent but davos has his trust and expectation that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll manage it and he does at the iron bank the situation for stannis is more helpless but nevertheless similar to the other situation for davos we just have asosprebattlestannis at this moment who still has a lot to do and who still got a long way to go a way which will show his abilities and it only begins with his victory at the battle of castle black where he develops and gets more and more people who supporting him â that happens in the north before that he had few men and mainly the queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men because of melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080><U+009C>helpâ<U+0080><U+009D> and on the show now a iron bank loan because of davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> help so they might brought him men in the past but its stannis who leads and commands them and later davosmel leave stan  he leaves them and he gets the peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s supports with his own actions with his recognizing that has to defend his realm fight against its enemies do his duties as king â<U+0080><U+0093> and that shows the show hopefully in the future episode 9 is there an important step especially ifwhen we see him fighting blackwaterlike again which is very certain and then in season 5 thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s even more awesome stuff to doâ<U+0080> â edited typos edited by the onion

"King Tommen",2014-05-30,"i dont know if its been discussed but there kinda needs to be a bowen marsh character next season if they dont introduce bowen next season i think the role will be given to either thorne or grenn thorne seems like to obvious choice but im leaning more towards grenn now hes getting a little more material this season which i think will either lead to his death or to a bigger role next seasonâ â i used to think that both thorne and grenn would die in the battle but now im leaning more towards just one of themâ â one possibility that has been floated is that the bowen marsh role could go to pyp next season hes an actual steward like marsh was and jon could choose to promote him up as one of his first acts as lc this way its certainly a character that the audience knows and its been established that theyre friends they could have pyp first gently disagree with some of the things jon is doing with the wildlings and have his disillusionment grow stronger throughout the season that would make his eventual reluctant betrayal that much more powerful â they certainly could just bring in a bowen marsh next season as if hes been there all along and weve never seen him but i do find that strange that theyve gone out of their way not to cast him at this point â in the books both grenn and pyp are just kind of sidelined out of the story which isnt a great way to deal with them on the show having grenn die in the battle and pyp take on a more important role in the following season would make better uses of them imo"
"sati",2014-05-30,"but the thing is you take the opinion of the people from the previously forums as being the universal opinion of the wall storyline which i know for sure its not true i watch non book readers youtube videos as well as other forums besides that one and they actually care about other storylines besides kl  no offense but i just dont enjoy reading that forum in particular in seems its just full of grumpy people upset that the story is not going into the direction that they want and just continue watching and whining at almost everything i just dont even bother reading it anymore tbhbut whatever floats your boat  â um what i visit a lot of forums i have my own website i do talk with a lot of fans of the show everyone gets to have their own opinionâ sure people care my comment wasnt about that it was a comparison of hype for this and blackwater â then dont read it edited by sati 30 may 2014  0726 am"

"Ignorant Bog Woman",2014-06-03,"spoilers  my speculation â prefight well get some scenes of the various parties preparing for the battle definitely one with ygritte and company at a camp fire in which the thenn warg uses his owl to witness mances signal and lets the group know that its time apparently a scene between jon and sam on top of the wall while theyre on patrol a scene where a nights watchman blows the horn for wildlings another one with ser alliser thorne giving a grand speech to rouse the nights watch hopefully well get something with mance attack from the south during the night tormund ygritte styr and co will raid castle black theres shots in the trailers of them running down a trail towards the gates while taking arrow fire shots of them climbing over the front gate and several shots of them fighting the nights watchmen throughout the castle in the yard and on the catwalks including a fight between jon and styr it looks like there will also be some fighting on the elevator platform in the books ygritte dies while storming the castle so naturally im gonna assume she meets a similar fate on screen its pretty likely in this ones humble opinion that the orphan boy olly will be the one to kill her a new addition not from the books is a battle between tormund and alliser i say tormund will win because i cant believe he would be upgraded to regular status only to be quickly killed off but i wonder if alliser survives i doubt it his leadership during the battle would make it really hard for jon to win the following election at some point there will be a scene in the tunnel under the wall in which some black brothers fight off a giant who is trying to break down the inner gate i expect grenn will take over donal noyes role in the novel by slaying and being slayed by the mighty giant attack from the north in the book this part follows the failed attack from the south but i believe the two battles will take place simultaneously on the show and will be intercut this would mean jon wont be up on top of the wall to lead the men unfortunately jon is up on top at some point though and in that shot there is a scarecrow behind him  it looks like those are in he sees mances signal the haunted forest on fire or a sea of torches from the parapets but i assume he eventually goes down to fight in the yard while some others hold the wall there are several shots in the trailers of wildlings and even a mammoth marching through the trees and grouping up for a mass battle cry in front of the haunted forest we havent seen a lot of footage from the actual attack in the promotional videos though a few shots of nights watch bowmen loosing arrows down at the approaching horde some leaning too far out and some falling while the battlements around them explode into splinters down below we see some wildlings running towards the wall and the ones reaching it being thrown back by a blast apparently from barrels thrown down from up above also a mammoth turning away from some sort of explosion at the gate stannis stannis stannis i wonder what causes jon to venture north to treat with mance if he does so at all having janos and alliser arrive earlier than in the novels has compromised their role in this subplot alliser is probably going to die and even if he doesnt why would they send him hes also proven himself at court and during battle i can see this instead jon goes up to the top of the wall during a break in the fighting takes account of how few men they have left looks at mances vast host says were fucked or something along those lines and decides to go treat with mance willing to sacrifice himself to possibly salvage the situation whatever the case there is a trailer shot of a distressed mance running around his camp and many of stannis cavalry running down the confused and disorganized wildlings there are shots in the trailers of jon riding inside the ice tunnel of the wall this could be him going to see mance but it could just as easily be something else cut from earlier in the season there is an extra shot of jon in the tunnel with sam holding a torch and looking morose this could be sam accompanying jon on his way to mance briefly looking at the remains of grenn and the giant or it could be them welcoming stannis to castle black although i think that will happen in episode ten loose ends will we see stannis during his charge i hope so i want a brave heroic stannis moment will we see davos during the battle or not until the finale melisandre lighting orells eagle on fire i assume the eagle will come back into play during the battle why else have it get away alive last season pyp will get shot in the neck by an arrow at some point but im not sure if he dies from it i wonder if the arrow is from ygritte what does sam do during the battle he will reunite with gilly but im not sure if this happens in episode nine or ten we see him in the promo running around with a crossbow maybe he kills somebody according to an interview one of the major deaths this season was filmed to be in slowmotion it wasnt lysa or oberyn and i hope it isnt tywin so im going to assume it will be ygritte or pyp in the trailers there are several more shots i didnt discuss above there was a scene in the foreshadowing video of sam and jon discussing ygritte this could be a scene from the prebattle section of this episode or it could have been cut from an earlier episode or be from the season finale finally there is a shot of a bunch of burning men around a burning man getting dragged through the snow by a rope if it wasnt for the snow i would think this was the dragons getting chained up it still could be if their intention was to replace the snow with sand in postproduction if not what could it be some sort of trap or them getting dragged by a mammoth â let me know if i am missing anything or wrong on something"
"Konradsmith",2014-06-03,"i assume that sam saying your wildling girl shes one of the raiders is in this episode so his info on that would have to either come from olly or gilly i think"
"sati",2014-06-03,"i think tormund meets with jon in the tunnel and he takes him to maces camp we see a shot of mace running in one promo i assume when the attack of stannis forces happen they will have confused jon standing there showing him try to figure out the banners and then i think â 1 either at the very end of the ep blackwater style we see stannis ride forth with the chant happening perhaps him you know riding victoriously in front of his army than looking straight at jon and the ep ends â 2 stannis is wearing a helmet and we see him cut down some wildlings and then before the chantbanner reveal he removes his helmet â i like 1 better but the 2nd gives stannis more ass kicking to do"

"Thelastactionhero",2014-06-05,"to what interview are you referring ill have to scour for it i remember distinctly that elio asked george r martin so hows stannis going to react when mel sacrifices shireen and he became nervous saying yes kings blood is important or something to that effect admittedly it has been a while since i looked at it though so apologies if its not air tight"

"Ignorant Bog Woman",2014-06-02,"title the watchers on the wall runtime 51 minutes written by david benioff and dan weiss directed by neil marshall tvma adult content adult language graphic content official synopsis jon snow and the nights watch face a big challenge official promo httpswwwyoutubehvmo9amibob1c httpswwwyoutubeeatureyoutube official recap httpswwwyoutubehvfmquzhnlyl4 â notes i will update this post throughout the week as i learn new information the following is my own personal speculation based on what ive seen from the trailers and promos what i have heard from other sources and read from the source material â  this will go a little different than the usual speculation threads since only one storyline is featured in this episode yes the entire hour is centered around the events at the wall no tyrion awaiting his execution no arya or dany or brienne  just jon snow sam ygritte gilly mance rayder and stannis fucking baratheon entangled in one huge spectacle â the battle will be comprised of three smaller battles according to director neil marshall i assume they are 1 tormunds group and the thenns assaulting castle black from the south 2 mances army besieging the wall from the north and 3 stannis forces charging down and routing the wildling host â the first two parts will apparently take place entirely over one night and the third part the following morning though in the book they occurred over several nights and days i get it the darkness is easy on the budget thats why they had the battle of blackwater take place at night as well but i would really like to see a daytime battle at some point in the series run anyway â prefight well get some scenes of the various parties preparing for the battle definitely one with ygritte and company at a camp fire in which the thenn warg uses his owl to witness mances signal and lets the group know that its time apparently a scene between jon and sam on top of the wall while theyre on patrol a scene where a nights watchman blows the horn for wildlings another one with ser alliser thorne giving a grand speech to rouse the nights watch hopefully well get something with mance â attack from the south during the night tormund ygritte styr and the thenns will raid castle black theres shots in the trailers of them running down a trail towards the gates while taking arrow fire shots of them climbing over the front gate and several shots of them fighting the nights watchmen throughout the castle in the yard and on the catwalks including a fight between jon and styr it looks like there will also be some fighting on the elevator platform in the books ygritte dies while storming the castle so naturally im going to assume she meets a similar fate on screen its pretty likely that the orphan boy olly will be the one to kill her apparently pyp will get an arrow through the neck himself and probably die from it and apparently it comes from ygritte a new addition not from the books is a battle between tormund and alliser i say tormund will win because i cant believe he was upgraded to regular status only to be quickly killed off but i wonder if alliser survives i doubt it his leadership during the battle would make it really hard for jon to win the following election fairly at some point there will be a scene in the tunnel under the wall in which some black brothers fight off a giant who is trying to break down the inner gate i expect grenn will take over donal noyes role in the novel by slaying and being slayed by the mighty giant â attack from the north in the book this part follows the failed attack from the south but i believe the two battles will take place simultaneously on the show and will be intercut this would mean jon wont be up on top of the wall to lead the men unfortunately jon is up on top at some point though and in that shot there is a scarecrow behind him  it looks like those are in he sees mances signal the haunted forest on fire or a sea of torches from the parapets but i assume he eventually goes down to fight in the yard after giving some orders there are several shots in the trailers of wildlings and even a mammoth marching through the trees and grouping up for a mass battle cry in front of the haunted forest we havent seen a lot of footage from the actual attack in the promotional videos though a few shots of archers loosing arrows down at the approaching horde some leaning too far out and some falling while the battlements around them explode into splinters down below we see some wildlings running towards the wall and the ones reaching it being thrown back by a blast apparently from barrels thrown down from up above also some sort of explosion near the gate causing the mammoth to turn around and start trampling some wildlings i knew neil couldnt resist â stannis stannis stannis im guessing janos sends jon to treat with mance there is a trailer shot of a distressed mance running around his camp and many of stannis cavalry running down the confused and disorganized wildlings there are shots in the trailers of jon riding inside the ice tunnel of the wall this could be him going to see mance but it could just as easily be something else cut from earlier in the season there is an extra shot of jon in the tunnel with sam holding a torch and looking morose this could be sam accompanying jon on his way to mance briefly looking at the remains of grenn and the giant or it could be them welcoming stannis to castle black although i think that will happen in episode ten â loose ends will we see stannis during his charge i hope so i want a brave heroic stannis moment will we see davos during the battle or not until the finale melisandre lighting orells eagle on fire i assume the eagle will come back into play during the battle why else have it get away alive last season what does sam do during the battle he will reunite with gilly but im not sure if this happens in episode nine or ten we see him in the promo running around with a crossbow maybe he kills somebody according to an interview one of the major deaths this season was filmed to be in slowmotion it wasnt lysa or oberyn and i hope it isnt tywin so im going to assume it will be ygritte or pyp in the trailers there are several more shots i didnt discuss above there was a scene in the foreshadowing video of sam and jon discussing ygritte this could be a scene from the prebattle section of this episode or it could have been cut from an earlier episode or be from the season finale finally there is a shot of a bunch of burning men around a burning man getting dragged through the snow by a rope if it wasnt for the snow i would think this was the dragons getting chained up it still could be if their intention was to replace the snow with sand in postproduction if not what could it be some sort of trap or the mammoth dragging them â  â in summation should be awesome very very awesome ygrittes death alliser v tormund giants and mammoths and stannis â what do you guys think anything to add edited by ignorant bog woman 06 june 2014  0428 am"
"Patchfaith",2014-06-06,"great work only thing ive got to add is that jon will obviously kick ass kill styr and probably their warg dont think hes going out to mance at all that was mostly a grrm diversion to use him as pov camera for stannis attack"

"ToTheWolves",2014-06-08,"title the watchers on the wall runtime 51 minutes written by david benioff and dan weiss directed by neil marshall tvma adult content adult language graphic content official synopsis jon snow and the nights watch face a big challenge official promo httpswwwyoutubehvmo9amibob1c httpswwwyoutubeeatureyoutube official recap httpswwwyoutubehvfmquzhnlyl4 â notes i will update this post throughout the week as i learn new information the following is my own personal speculation based on what ive seen from the trailers and promos what i have heard from other sources and read from the source material â  this will go a little different than the usual speculation threads since only one storyline is featured in this episode yes the entire hour is centered around the events at the wall no tyrion awaiting his execution no arya or dany or brienne  just jon snow sam ygritte gilly mance rayder and stannis fucking baratheon entangled in one huge spectacle â the battle will be comprised of three smaller battles according to director neil marshall i assume they are 1 tormunds group and the thenns assaulting castle black from the south 2 mances army besieging the wall from the north and 3 stannis forces charging down and routing the wildling host â the first two parts will apparently take place entirely over one night and the third part the following morning though in the book they occurred over several nights and days i get it the darkness is easy on the budget thats why they had the battle of blackwater take place at night as well but i would really like to see a daytime battle at some point in the series run anyway â prefight well get some scenes of the various parties preparing for the battle definitely one with ygritte and company at a camp fire in which the thenn warg uses his owl to witness mances signal and lets the group know that its time apparently a scene between jon and sam on top of the wall while theyre on patrol a scene where a nights watchman blows the horn for wildlings another one with ser alliser thorne giving a grand speech to rouse the nights watch hopefully well get something with mance â attack from the south during the night tormund ygritte styr and the thenns will raid castle black theres shots in the trailers of them running down a trail towards the gates while taking arrow fire shots of them climbing over the front gate and several shots of them fighting the nights watchmen throughout the castle in the yard and on the catwalks including a fight between jon and styr it looks like there will also be some fighting on the elevator platform in the books ygritte dies while storming the castle so naturally im going to assume she meets a similar fate on screen its pretty likely that the orphan boy olly will be the one to kill her apparently pyp will get an arrow through the neck himself and probably die from it and apparently it comes from ygritte a new addition not from the books is a battle between tormund and alliser i say tormund will win because i cant believe he was upgraded to regular status only to be quickly killed off but i wonder if alliser survives i doubt it his leadership during the battle would make it really hard for jon to win the following election fairly at some point there will be a scene in the tunnel under the wall in which some black brothers fight off a giant who is trying to break down the inner gate i expect grenn will take over donal noyes role in the novel by slaying and being slayed by the mighty giant â attack from the north in the book this part follows the failed attack from the south but i believe the two battles will take place simultaneously on the show and will be intercut this would mean jon wont be up on top of the wall to lead the men unfortunately jon is up on top at some point though and in that shot there is a scarecrow behind him  it looks like those are in he sees mances signal the haunted forest on fire or a sea of torches from the parapets but i assume he eventually goes down to fight in the yard after giving some orders there are several shots in the trailers of wildlings and even a mammoth marching through the trees and grouping up for a mass battle cry in front of the haunted forest we havent seen a lot of footage from the actual attack in the promotional videos though a few shots of archers loosing arrows down at the approaching horde some leaning too far out and some falling while the battlements around them explode into splinters down below we see some wildlings running towards the wall and the ones reaching it being thrown back by a blast apparently from barrels thrown down from up above also some sort of explosion near the gate causing the mammoth to turn around and start trampling some wildlings i knew neil couldnt resist â stannis stannis stannis im guessing janos sends jon to treat with mance there is a trailer shot of a distressed mance running around his camp and many of stannis cavalry running down the confused and disorganized wildlings there are shots in the trailers of jon riding inside the ice tunnel of the wall this could be him going to see mance but it could just as easily be something else cut from earlier in the season there is an extra shot of jon in the tunnel with sam holding a torch and looking morose this could be sam accompanying jon on his way to mance briefly looking at the remains of grenn and the giant or it could be them welcoming stannis to castle black although i think that will happen in episode ten â loose ends will we see stannis during his charge i hope so i want a brave heroic stannis moment will we see davos during the battle or not until the finale melisandre lighting orells eagle on fire i assume the eagle will come back into play during the battle why else have it get away alive last season what does sam do during the battle he will reunite with gilly but im not sure if this happens in episode nine or ten we see him in the promo running around with a crossbow maybe he kills somebody according to an interview one of the major deaths this season was filmed to be in slowmotion it wasnt lysa or oberyn and i hope it isnt tywin so im going to assume it will be ygritte or pyp in the trailers there are several more shots i didnt discuss above there was a scene in the foreshadowing video of sam and jon discussing ygritte this could be a scene from the prebattle section of this episode or it could have been cut from an earlier episode or be from the season finale finally there is a shot of a bunch of burning men around a burning man getting dragged through the snow by a rope if it wasnt for the snow i would think this was the dragons getting chained up it still could be if their intention was to replace the snow with sand in postproduction if not what could it be some sort of trap or the mammoth dragging them â  â in summation should be awesome very very awesome ygrittes death alliser v tormund giants and mammoths and stannis â what do you guys think anything to add anything on ghost"
