"Darth Pipes",2013-03-31,"910 while not perfect i was very happy with this episode and think its a promising start for the new season the highlight was the tyriontywin scene which comes off as strong as it does in the book the lowlight is robb the oathbreaking hypocrite"

"Bastard of Boston",2013-03-31,"loved this episode i gave it an 8probably bumped up a point due to my nerdboner  my computer desk is levitating right now i needed this back in my life kind of a slow episode but thanks to rans review i was prepared and even optimistic i appreciate the drastic ideology change from last year where they felt the need to visit every single character arc id rather get prolonged exposure than the more erratic pace where youre not truly able to sit in it i sat all up in this episode guys my ass print is right there next to the yuckmouth girli cant decide what my favorite part was  tywintyrion or dany in astapor as much as i love tyrion i love tyrion more when its not so easy for him its refreshing to see tyrion not be in complete controland even a little humbled astapor looks amazing and the high valyrian scene was better than anything from season 2 qarthgotta highlight an invented scene  marge with the orphans in flea bottom love seeing the curtain get pulled back in regard to the character great job establishing her as the peoples queen setting up the stuff between her and cersei  sure to be great and giants god i love this show"
"Greyjoy67",2013-03-31,"better than i expected considering the pessimism on here but then the reviews have been so positive810 which is what i wanted for an opening episode tywin  tyrion is one of my fave chapters in the book and they nailed it thats like two points in itself i digged the davos stuff as well that was more or less straight from the book tarly stuff was good jon snow joining wildlings worked quite nicely arstans joining dany was a bit rushed but okay some good foreshadowing with roose bolton and co that i liked as well stuff that was added  margaerys stuff worked and they played her off against cersei nice and early which i was glad to see somewhat predictably the only part i really objected to was shae  ros hopefully they dont crop up too much again it seemed like they were building some sort of storyline there too  i guess well just have to accept that one for what it is id have preferred some dontos but whatevergood episode found it quite cinematic at points  dragon scene white walkers armies marching etc it was cool i can see how theyve improved visually  i found season two claustrophobic at points and theyve improved upon that in this episode"
"Greyjoy67",2013-03-31,"610 felt rushed and dumbed down compared to the books no ars whitebeardnot dumbed down the arstan thing was one of the first things i knew dd would cut down on and it makes a lot of sense"

"Stallion That Mounts Texas",2013-03-31,"i gave it a solid 8 its about what i expected as the first four episodes or the setup for the rest of the season 1 love how they introduced barristan from the start but i do miss strong belwas the assassination attempt by the warlock was awesome2 i love natalie dormer as marg i love how she making herself right at home and positioning herself to be queeen3 i love how cersei is powerless to stop the monster she gave birth to she is bound by her love for joff and will suffer any and all insults4 the unsullied are outstanding cant wait to see them in action"
"Died a Hero",2013-03-31,"9 i loved most of the episode tyrions interactions with his sister bronn and his father were amazing jons scenes were good mance may not have been wielding his lute but i think ciaran hinds was an excellent choice for the role he commands attention while on the screen and carries the air of a born leader i loved the cgi shot of the giant too davos being brought to the one true king was annoying but the tv audience wouldnt have understood him being arrested right as he touched town on the shore i have high hopes for daenerys this season shes my fav pov in the book davos is 2ed and what they did to her cok story was hard to watch however seeing her dragons her detest for how the unsullied are trained and of course the reappearance of ser grandfather im excited the only thing i disliked is the ongoing development of shae and the outright knowledge of littlefingers part in sansas escape with shae what are they building towards her turn for no reason in season 4 what because tyrion didnt want to run away with her she sells him out to the court and bangs his father seems pointless and littlefinger why go through the trouble of introducing dontons in season 2 if youre not going to use him again seems pointless though all and all a great start to what should be the best two seasons in television history im not setting the bar for failure am i"
"rystine",2013-03-31,"a little slow i actually preferred that they stuck with various characters stories longer and excluded others altogether rather than giving us very small pieces of all the stories tyrion and tywin was superbly done and barristans reveal was simplified but very well done danys story in general is off to a great start jon and mance was also a highlight for me 810 edited by rystine 31 march 2013  0931 pm"
"TheHedgeWizard",2013-03-31,"gave it a 910 when i dont see great moments from the book in the show i get really disappointed but i have to remind myself its an adaptation and a lot of those moments wont make the cut it was a strong first episode it felt very rushed but it was all set up for what seems to be a great season 3 the beginning with sam and ghost coming out of no where i thought was the weakest part excited for next week and what i hope will be a great dracarys moment"
"drm7",2013-03-31,"loved tyriontywin dragons danys little smirk at the unsullied owners ignorance of her language skills tormund ok mance  had that cleverness about him but didnt look as hard as i thought davos  felt a little rushed to get to stannismel but his convo with sal saan was great barristan  it would have been nice to hide his identity but viewers would recognize the actor anyway so ok  putting all the starks at harrenhall seems forced and weird no belwas margaery at the orphanage a little over the top shaeroz  meh all in all  it was great im so excited the new season has started"
"pntrlqst",2013-03-31,"7510 but i always enjoy the episodes more on rewatch some of the dialogue made me cringe some of it made me smile wide something about balls brushing ankles and everything spoken in the tywintyrion scene from what i recall there wasnt a single scene i disliked while i thought the first two episodes of season two were strong neither escaped cleanly without a wtf scene cum in episode 202 and littlefingers idiocy in 201 come to mind here nothing i felt dragged down the episode because of its presence with that said slow but understandably slow"
"Broken Fox",2013-03-31,"solid 8 nothing huge or flashy but it set the stage for the next chapter in the story"
"NickSnow",2013-03-31,"rating 8 out of 10a very solid first episode i think there didnt think that there was anything particularly cringeworthy gooddavos very good stuff his conversation with sallador saan is very good as well as his interactions with stannis and melisandredaenerys dany had a very bad season last year but everything seems to be improving the unsullied are great as well as kranzys and missandei and a very good ending with barristankings landing everything in kings landing was very good as well i particularly liked the scenes with margaery lancel joffrey and cersei the dynamic between the lannisters and the tyrells is very well done also tyrions conversation with tywin was very good indeedbadjon snow and mance rayder meh i wasnt too impressed with the wildlings mance rayder did not have the necessary charisma to make me convinced that he had become the leader of all these wildlings and tormund giantsbane was underwhelming as wellcatelyn and robb there wasnt a lot of robb and cat in this episode and whatever is there is fairly underwhelming as well they arrive in harrenhal  and meet qyburn  huhuglyagain i didnt flip any tables in this epsidode i thought it was very good"
"Dragonblood Stormborn",2013-03-31,"i love the series truly i know its different in some ways from the books i was excited about this opening seasonepisode i agree with others it was a bit slow and im conflicted about some of the choices to change certain things for the tv show the scene between tywin and tyrion was powerful i must confess im struggling for some reason to understand shaes show character and role in relation to who she is in the book i hope sam will get a chance to use his dragon glass and prove he is the slayer after all i guess i can understand revealing barristen selmy right away instead of whitebeard makes sense for the show i wonder does this mean jorers character developments will be expedited as well i cant wait to see next week i love the a song of ice and fire and a game of thrones combo i wish they had insisted hbo do 13 or 14 episodes per season instead of a mere 10 13 for the 13 of qarth or 14 for 7x2 new gods smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  edited by dragonblood stormborn 31 march 2013  0955 pm"

"tito5601",2013-03-31,"i gave it an 8 overall great season i think the locations are even more beautiful than last season and the acting as always is top notch but in the end this was an episode to kickstart the season so maybe it wasnt the most interesting episode but every season needs an episode like this also comparing it to season 1 and 2 premiere i think they were both more interesting than this one especially with the way they ended"
"Lord Godric",2013-03-31,"one thing i am worried about if the purpose wedding is indeed next season what is there for sansa to do is the already established plan with littlefinger to sit on the back burner for a whole year"
"Lyanna's rose",2013-03-31,"i give it a solid 8 season premiere episodes are usually slow in general because there are a lot of story lines to try to catch up on i was a little disappointed by the change in the story jon tells mance on why he wants to join the wildlings because i really liked the bastard story but i think the tv version was also a really good substitute so im not complaining my favorite scene was probably tywin tyrion i thought danys first scene in astapor was really good too although i wish they had hinted at the fact that dany is only pretending that she cant speak valyrian idk if tv viewers would catch onto that maybe theyll bring it up later also since ser barristan was revealed so quickly i wonder howwhen hell reveal to dany that jorah was originally spying on her to robert edited by lyannas rose 31 march 2013  0946 pm"
"Lucamore the Lusty",2013-03-31,"same as last seasons opener heres a lot of setup and heres some new folks i expect next week to be about the same"
"kephv",2013-03-31,"i gave it 7 though even that feels generous the opening scenes with the watch were extremely dull as i expected nothing was shown for how they survived an army of wights and others as was jons meeting with mance some highlights include tyrions scene with tywin davos alone on the seastack and his meeting with salladhor and the unsullied being cut up thats about it the rest was setting the board though none of it particularly interesting the reveal of barristan was also a total waste and poorly handled hopefully the next episode is better"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-03-31,"i was hoping they would have mance tell jon he had seen him before it sets up that awesome line jon has about why hes joining the wildlings the conversation they have was much weaker than in the books and i feel like mance is a bit too intense but thats my only complaint 810 overall danys story was great and i fucking love charles dance that scene was better to watch than to read and i loved reading it"
"lostinwesteros",2013-03-31,"i am torn on this one i was disappointed overall and im not entirely sure why what i loved were the parts north of the wall and with dany in astapor the dragons were super and baristan selmy but i wasnt bowled over by the rest of it ill have to give it a 7"
"Arya rules",2013-03-31,"was the battle of the fist just skipped and the end was the scene with lc and sam"
"alwayswinter",2013-03-31,"9 thought the tywintyrion scene was fantastic along with davos interactions with salladhorstannismel jons scene got better  better as it went was also pleased with tormund after hearing some had reservations regarding his characters portrayal plus the giant looked awesome thought danys scenes were good too  especially the unsullied one only the sansashaeroslittlefinger scene seemed a little disjointed to me otherwise it would have been a 10 great start to the seasonnow to rewatch"
"Zman1863",2013-03-31,"810 pacing was definitely slower than normal but necessary for the first couple episodes in order to set up the rest of the season the tyriontywin scene was superb and my favorite of the episode i also liked the joffrey and margery scenes a lot danys scenes were pretty good wasnt much of a fan of the beginning with the nw also wasnt thrilled with robbs scene headlined by a sensible roose bolton i was satisfied with everything else"
"cybobbie",2013-03-31,"gave an 810 because as a first episode of the season it was great but kind of slow understandable thoughreally liked the giant despite some of the critics that ive read here i love ciaran hinds as mance because i really feel that he can portray a very powerful character tormund was perfect for me as wellthe best scenes for me are tyriontywin dany with the unsullied and the last scene with barristan and i get the choice to not hide his identity what would seem really strange in the show the only scene that i didnt like much was robs scenes but i will watch the episode again in an hour and maybe i change my mind"

"Nezzer",2013-03-31,"this was my favorite premiere so far i dont know if its because i knew all about the episode before watching it but i have nothing of importance to complain i gave it a 9 i just dont give it a 10 because stannis sounded too much like a douche when he ordered his men to arrest davos and because of the lack of the battle of the fist which bothered me much less than i expected"

"Greyjoy the Reaver",2013-04-01,"i gave it a 910 i thought it was a great episode the tyrion tywin scene was really good dany in astapor was sweet as well as the dragon catching the fish scene the appearance of mance raydar was excellent and jon snows dialogue with him turned out nice over all i feel like it was a very promising episode and i cant wait until next week i may even dig out my book and start reading it again im about 70 pages from the end of what im reading right now hmmmmm"
"Words of Winter",2013-04-01,"i gave the episode a 8 but i could easily be persuaded to go higher to a 9 10s for me are a rare feat so an 8 is really high season openers in a drama arc are very hard to do and they did it well and for me did it surprisingly close to what i remember from the books with minor tweaks of scene placement and character placement pros tywin and tyrion shout out to book lovers about tyrions nose the entire astapor scene while watching i remembered the book seemed pretty close they kept the nipple scene shout out to book lovers about tyrions nose cons margerys tv scene isnt in the book i dont think its been a while sense i read it i like the juxtaposition of her vs joffrey both want power but joffrey loathes his subjects and while margery probably doesnt care for them either she know she has to win their support and she has to do it publically nevertheless it slowed the pace down tormand better say har that is all i have to say about that"
"bent branch",2013-04-01,"i gave it 810 i thought the opening with sam interesting as everyone is saying the scene with tyrion and tywin is incredibly powerful i liked how they handled all of the dany material i actually liked the assassination attempt and the reveal of selmy a lot when littlefinger was speaking of arya i thought it was a veiled reference to spoiler jeyne poole  i had actually forgotten about the almost meeting of lf and arya in season 2 until i read other posts i liked most of the wilding stuff but mance raydar was a bit difficult the actor doesnt look like how i imagined mance to look nor did he have the demeanor i imagined mance would have however the disconnect between the show mance and book mance is not so great that i cant reconcile the two the difference between book jorah and show jorah is so great that i think of them as two entirely different characters i dont think it will be that bad with mance i like the guy portraying tormund i like what was done with margaery and joffrey this is one place where the show can actually add something more to the books both margaery and joffrey are nonpovs and the show allows us to see them from a different angle i find it fascinating how enthralled joffrey appeared to be margaerys take on noblesse oblige seemed to baffle yet enchant joffrey i really liked how both actors handled their scenes the only part i really had problems with was at harrenhal it just didnt feel right to me im kind of not liking show robb edited by bent branch 01 april 2013  0131 am"

"Justin Danford",2013-04-01,"my biggest gripe is how apparent it is that juggling all of martins storylines in 10 episodes okay even 20 is getting extremely difficult even for brillant writers like d  d they are doing a good job with the scenes they port over from the book with all the minor changes but the scenes they add to try and tie things together seem wobbly ie little finger telling sansa he plans to help her escape random qyburn appearancesince season 1 the nature of the story and its expanse has caused each episode to jump and become very decentralized that cant really be helped i suppose but it gets almost formulaic at times 5 mins jon 8 mins tyrion 4 mins danny 5 mins stannis 3 mins rob 5 mins tyrion etc etc i think breather episodes like blackwater should be more commonplace  not as extreme where you only follow one story line but you dont have to cover a chapter from the majority of the major characters every episode give them each a bit more room to breathe so we get a greater sense of living with that character obviously that is a huge disadvantage of an on screen adaptaion but with a world so expansive and a season so short it gets really disjointed juggling all those povsas it is there was no arya jamie theon or bran in this episode they did a better job sticking with the character for a bit than they did in season 2 but im starting to believe having a character excluding maybe jon or danny ortyrion appear every 3rd episode might be a stronger way of depicting the story i believe blackwater was so loved not because of the battle which is great but because it really develops one aspect of the story and allows that single aspect of martins world to mature in all its richnesstldr feels like visual cliff notes at timesbut what do i know everyones a critic i still love the show edited by justin danford 01 april 2013  0159 am"

classbbcemoticon alt my review of the episode i rated it an 8 out of 10 with my biggest problems being the direction i really dont like daniel minahan as a director and the order of scenes  surely tyriontywin should have been the climax of the kings landing plothas there ever been a title so apt for an episode of â<U+0080><U+009C>game of thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D> the season premiere is titled â<U+0080>˜valar doeherisâ<U+0080><U+0099> which when translated from valyrian reads â<U+0080>˜all men must serveâ<U+0080><U+0099> the theme carried through from the title touches on all of the major stories running through this episode â<U+0080>˜valar doeherisâ<U+0080><U+0099> is a beautifully produced episode of the show â<U+0080><U+0093> but it does not come without flawsthe opening sequenceevery year part of the joy of â<U+0080><U+009C>thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D> is the opening sequence i am always excited to see how the steam punk map will reflect my own images of the cities and castles that inhabit westeros and beyond last year i was bitterly disappointed with their rendering of qarth â<U+0080><U+0093> which was lifeless and uninspired i guess it reflected that particular storyline wellthis year my worries have been put to rest the camera drops down onto the burning ruins of winterfell â<U+0080><U+0093> which is in itself a poignant reminder of the events that unfolded in last seasonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s finale after that we are treated to a stunning representation of astapor complete with harpy statue beautiful imposing i want to get there right nowwhat i likedbeyond the wall it is not often that i have praise for the â<U+0080><U+009D>jon snowâ<U+0080><U+009D> storyline but it looks like things are about to change the wildling camp was a beautiful thing to behold although it seems to have snowed a great deal in the time it has taken them to climb down that cliff gemma jackson is a genius â<U+0080><U+0093> and it was completed by a cgi giant i really enjoy the character of ygritte especially now that she has been raised from inconsequential talk of stones bones and handjobs rose leslie captures the spearwife perfectly and i cannot help but be drawn to her when she is on screengoing into this episode i was concerned about hinds in the role of mance but he blew me away he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t caesar beyond the wall â<U+0080><U+0093> but a charismatic clearly intelligent leader of men he has captured the nuance of mance extremely well in his limited screentime and i look forward to seeing his work going forward similarly tormund was well played by hivju seems to have been born to play the role while this tormund might be grimmer than his largerthanlife book counterpart i enjoyed his introduction and i love referring to jon as â<U+0080><U+009C>baby crowâ<U+0080><U+009D> perhaps there is an engaging jon storyline on the cards fingers crossedastapor the shot of daenerys targaryen looking over the prow of her boat to the slaver city of astapor must be one of the most beautiful shots of the series to date the colours of the shot were outstanding credit must go to minahan though there will be more on him later again there seems to have been course correction here from the poor â<U+0080><U+009D>daenerys targaryenâ<U+0080><U+009D> storyline in season 2 it was lovely to hear astapori valyrian another wonderful language from david peterson though i am not sure whether the casual viewer would be aware of daenerysâ<U+0080><U+0099> understandingthe final section of the episode was wonderful if somewhat predictable the manticore was more great cgi and the score to barristanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reveal was epickingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing oh how i love kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing and this episode is no different i found every scene other than bronnâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pointless brothel scene and having to endure aiden gillenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s littlefinger on screen captivating natalie dormer really brought her agame as margaery i think that this is one of the benefits to having introduced her in the second season we already know what she is about but this episode added a tonne of flesh to those bonescharles dance and peter dinklage gave me goosebumps during that confrontation scene another wonderful piece of acting i am enjoying the less confident tyrion following the battle i look forward to all of their other scenes to comeall the small things this episode was brimming with moments that made my heart soar i loved the small conversation between roose bolton and rickard karstark where roose promises revenge for his sonsâ<U+0080><U+0099> deaths i love how the scornful look of the northmen forced robb to find a cell for his mother i loved talisaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brief appearance though did anyone else notice that oonaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sigil in the credits is two circling lions i loved davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> rock and sallador saan i loved all of the establishing shots â<U+0080><U+0093> kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing from the blackwater and astapor from danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s shipswhat i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t likeso i guess you must be wondering what i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like about the episode well there are two things direction and structure direction i have already mentioned that i thought that minahan has some moments of brilliance in this episode the way that he captures astapor is beautiful and the framing of margaery speaking to the septa from within joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s litter is a touch of genius yet he also has his flaws as a director â<U+0080><U+0093> in the first season he butchered one of my favourite scenes from the novels ned confessing to cersei so perhaps i hold a grudgeminahan seems to really struggle to direct action sequences minahan directed three episodes in season one â<U+0080>˜a golden crownâ<U+0080><U+0099> â<U+0080>˜you win or you dieâ<U+0080><U+0099> and â<U+0080>˜the pointy endâ<U+0080><U+0099> i have always thought that he struggles with action particularly in the grrm penned â<U+0080>˜the pointy endâ<U+0080><U+0099> his framing of arya killing the stable boy is for me the worst moment of the entire show so far it took me completely out of the scene he also seemed to struggle with the wight attacking mormont at castle black he seems to get quite glitchy during these scenes â<U+0080><U+0093> and cuts about all over the placewe see this style of direction again in this episode and it pulls the viewer out of both the cold open and the episodeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s climax when sam is running through the snow we are treated to this dark foreboding snow storm â<U+0080><U+0093> we know why he is running and we are willing him to be ok then he is attacked by the wight and the camera jumps all over the place it is a mess dragging us out of the horror of the scene while the director plays with camera angles then the wight is suddenly set on fire great and mormont is standing right beside it the direction is really poor which leads me to be disappointed in the cold openthe action at the end is equally poor and choppy i hope the idea for barristan wearing that ridiculous cloak to attempt a classic bait and switch was not his idea this would have involved that barristan and not the little girl was the assassin anyway the fight with the manticore was just messy â<U+0080><U+0093> sloppy even â<U+0080><U+0093> direction we hardly see dany get pushed for a start again it drags you away from the action and the importance of the sequencei sincerely hope that minahan does not have much action to direct in the next episode he just needs to leave the camera alone pick an angle and stick to it rant over â<U+0080><U+0093> until next week i imagine"

"StannisandDaeny",2013-04-01,"910 this episode made me happy i had a lot of fear for it and was very much relieved the first episode is always a challenge but theyve managed to squeeze a lot in there that had to be done that looked really greati dont mind them leaving out the wight attack on the fist for those complaining it was only a flashback in the books too ive seen enough zombie films as with the aliens films 1 alien is scarier than a whole lot of aliens and in the same way 1 wight is scarier than an army of wights james cosmo was impressive as the old bear as always i mustve missed something but i was confused by ghosts arrival at the nights watch since it looked like sam had only just come running back from the initial attack jeors question on whether he sent the ravens didnt make much sense to me though i feel like maybe theres a catch i missedthe giant looked grand and realistic mance was excellently cast i love that guy hes both sympathetic and tough at the same time which is what you want in mace tormund not really he looks sounds and appears terrible and stereotypical acting more like styr than booktormund we finally saw the real jon snow as hes supposed to be for a couple of seconds when he manages to convince mance i hope jon carries this through and becomes the badass hes meant to be while i liked her better initially ygritte is now starting to irritate me in the show just as she did in the booksfor once a nude chick the one with bronn is actually sexy the sex  nude scenes in both books and show so far have never done much for me i always found them rather cringeworthy and gratuitous were getting into bronns sellsword philosophy more clearly and thats interestingi cant for the life of me remember what tyrion and cersei talked about in their scene though there were a few cheesy lines ser meryns loses the hand line was pretty much copied from craster and kind of already used by daeny once come on people be more creativeros warning shae about littlefinger is kinda interesting sansa trying to play a game with shae is funny and reminds me of the first season with tyrion its also a nice metaphor for sansa having more hopejoffrey is clearly still a little shit i hope they dont make the tyrells too sympathetic everyone including the audience forgets that its their army that was starving the city firststannis looks really handsome with his beard cool4gif classbbcemoticon altcool4  it was good to see salladhor saan again the portrayal makes me wish he was a more recurring characteri literally went omg its qyburn squee really looking forward to seeing this guys progression with the crowd from oh that poor man to whatthe dragons are impressivetywin is an ass while i liked the shows take on tywin it made him more interesting im glad they finally showed what an ass he is and of course charles dance pulls it off brilliantly i dont really like tyrion i have sympathy for him but i believe people forget his flaws too often but i really felt for him the way peter dinklage played him you could clearly see the sadness and how difficult it was for tyrion to keep up his usual swaggerthe unsullied look great and the slaver was excellent i remember loving his interaction with missandei and how she translated the foul things he spewed at dany its one of my favourite parts in the books and they did get that across slightlyim also really glad to see barristan again he was my favourite second tier character in season 1 and one of the bestcast people lookswise ian mcelhinney brings this classy feel to the show you can tell hes an actor of a past generation but he adapts while still bringing his classy qualities to the show in a really great way edited by stannisanddaeny 01 april 2013  0158 pm"

"Sun and Moon",2013-04-01,"despite having a few quibbles i enjoyed the episode and gave it a seven the main scene that caused me to mark down was that of margaery with the orphans whilst i appreciate what the writers were trying to do i thought the scene was ridiculously heavy handed like so many others i was a little underawed by the scene with jon and mance and yes i was looking out for the lining of his cloak i always viewed it as a symbol of mances defiance i was quite surprised when i heard of hinds being cast he is certainly not what i pictured in my head but hes a actor of considerable charisma so ill be interested to see what he does with the role nonetheless the unsullied hmmm babies hmmm for the time being im going to reserve judgement but was the original idea not that they would carry out orders even those that were of personal detriment i dont see that this change adds anything but manages to detract plenty there was much to like however and many of the departures from the source material for eg selmy not bothering with his pseud was a good move and made sense why attempt the pretense when screen time is so precious okay so weve lost belwas but i can live with it great scenes with many of the other characters i especially enjoyed tywin and tyrion davos and saan to name but two massive kudos to the guys responsible for the cgi i was so impressed how wonderfully they handled the depiction of the giant tasteful and not over played in the least when i first heard asoiaf was making its way to the telly this aspect troubled me most i was afraid if done badly it would make it harder for those watching who are not of a fantasy bent to take the series seriously and as these aspects will only become stronger the further into it we go sympathetic handling is essential going on what ive seen so far im quietly optimistic and now a repeat viewing is the order of the hour"

"utecifa",2013-04-01,"7 solid for a season debut i think season debuts are likely the hardest to write and pull off a nice effort i dont rate it any higher or lower than season 2s to be honest i felt the same after watching both solid but not great as for rosshae i think its necessary because i think theyre swapping roles from the book i wont go into any further detail than to say i think ros will wind up the shae from the books and shae will wind up the tysha from the books so i think theyre setting the stage for that edited by utecifa 01 april 2013  0259 pm"
"Abaddon",2013-04-01,"im feeling an 85 since i cant do that im going to knock it down to an 8 plus because i dont think it quite deserves a 9a few random notes i dont have as much a problem with the opening as most people seem to i wouldnt call it a standout of the episode but i am fine with them skipping the battle the giant rocked they do such a great job of not making things too fantasy there has to be an edge of plausibility and they do that very well i liked the change in jons stated motivation in deserting i think the bastard bit worked for a proud 14 yr old boy in the books but would have felt a bit ridiculous for the jon snow in the series i also liked that they built on the previous change of jon actually seeing the walker and mormont knowing not just suspecting something weird was afoot it makes me dislike that change a little bit less and shows they are at least thoughtfully considering their changes even in cases where i dont like them i will need to rewatch the robb in harrenhall bit my guests i host a smallish party every week of the show were talking during this and i missed a lot of conversation sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  i am intrigued by the introduction of qyburn surviving the bloodbath at harrenhall spoiler i think this is an indication that in the show the roosetywin connection might have come about due to qyburn being a plant by the lannister forces i am pretty bad about reading between the lines in the books so i dont know if anything like this was ever implied or not  loved the kings landing stuff all of it the tywintyrion scene being the standout naturally davos yay and dragonstone were good glad to see salla back hope we get to see him more than once this season loved the astapor stuff all of it out of the entire episode the dany stuff wowed me more than anything else other than the giant i supposeim really looking forward to catching up with the rest of the gang next week and then onward and upward"

"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2013-04-01,"ok lets go i gave a 6 but im wavering as to whether it should be a 7 then i remember the fist scene pros first margaery yeahhuh ive read rans analysis of the episode and hes not really sold on either dormer or the angle they used for this scene i see his point but dont agree completely firstly i think that dormer did a good job in her scenes having not been at all convinced by her in season 2 meanwhile i see the criticism attached to the scene at the flea bottom orphanage that it doesnt fit with the time period but i dont think that margaerys actions are that out of place im pretty certain that there are anecdotes of monarchs such as elizabeth i conversing with and mingling with lowborn members of society the idea of political spin was prevalent way back when too i also think there is a need to establish that the tyrells are indeed playing the game we never get a pov from them and much of cerseis perfectly valid criticisms lie behind too many layers of egomania and paranoia i also thought the dinner scene was good joffrey reminds me more and more of nero tyrioncerseitywin well acted well crafted scenes you could argue the cerseityrion one was necessary but i think theyre really trying to emphasis tyrions isolation both politically and from his family kraznys was very good as were the visuals of the giant the dragons etc weaknesses rip the characters formerly known as catelyn and robb stark extend this to littlefinger as well the beauty of sansas escape lies entirely in the shock the reader gets at hearing lfs voice then having him emerge from the shadows removing dontos and essentially refusing to acknowledge the presence of either varys or the fact that lf conversing with sansa in the open would place suspicion upon a man whose primary motto is to keep ones hands clean i mean i can just about see the logic behind this if it looks like theyre throwing a curveball should lf tell the small council about sansas betrothal to willas when it comes around but even so show lf is a poor imitation of his literary counterpart the fist debacle ive seen this criticism elsewhere but its perfectly valid why bother going to the trouble of making the massive cgi white walker army and then doing jack with them it just seems a complete waste the plotholes regarding this storyline were also incredibly frustrating why is ghost with the nw it makes no sense likewise mormont chastising sam oh sam didnt get the ravens off in time well maybe thats because he was made to go out on patrol away from his ravens the ravens that were supposedly his only job anyway if he didnt get the ravens off so what are they dead now because if sam didnt get them off theyre probably still on the fist the scene just made no sense waiting to pass judgement on mance and tormund but that scene was ok as were the davos scenes its been indicated that the episodes will get progressively better lets hope so because there is much to improve upon"

"kevin1989",2013-04-01,"a 8 some things were good some things werent but overall a good start of the season best start really and we have too look at it as a half premiere because half the characters are in episode 2 so first half of the premiere of the season is a 8 now scenes by scene  first scene wonderful scene as a book reader i was afraid that sam was going to die they did there job good shame there wasnt a little bit more budget even 10 seconds where we see mormont killing one wight more would be enought but still great season opener they let us really know what will going to happen if nobody gets back to the wall and why are people complaining about sam being a failure because in my opinion this is better for the show because they can have a build up for sam he will be more brave at crastens keep and later killing an other bam sam changed but i dont see why people complaining the season ends with sam and this season begins with sam nice way of telling the battle in my eyes  the scene with jon loved how he was welcomed by the wildlings tormund mistaken for mance was funny dd were smart by choosing a different reason as in the books even that reason was better the whole story would have been too long and what an actor is cirian hinds and we got a giant wonderful to see him building things great adaption not perfect but great  scene with bronn not because it was a great scene but they have learned that they dont need a major sexscene in the show  tyrion cercei great scene frightened cercei was great wonderful story about the past shows how cercei was back then and how tyrion was and dont forget bronn and ser meryn dialogue that was great  bronn and tyrion together was in someway beautiful  davos rescue was well done well played by liam and the scene with salador was great youre a great father made me cry  robb scene feels like we missing something this could have been better left for episode 2 or davos had to be left for season 2 so that there was more robb story here it felt incomplete but i loved the bolton karstark scene  the scene with tyrion and tywin heartbreaking  i really liked the sansa scene love to see how she was playing the game with shea nice buildup for next 2 seasons loved the two quotes that sansa said about rich people getting drunk and that the truth is either boring or horrible even if i understand why they needed to let lf tell sansa directly about taking here it was a shame that first he was so directly instead of saying that he will help here but when he can she will hear it through ross for instance and second that he told here about arya this could have better be told later  dragons do i need to say more biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  you can see all three of them dothraki being sick was awesome  melisandre davos stannis wonderful scene wonderful how stannis is doing only problem is the way melisandre behave not carices fault but a writing fault she would never provoke somebody like she did in the show im talking of course about talking about mathos and doesnt liam perform great this episode  my favorite scene of the episode margery at the orphanage and didnt she go behind jofreys back here  cerceis dinner party great setup for later and first time i liked jofrey my mothers getting old whahaha still i found him a dick and poor cercei  astapor the scene with the unsulied was great nice that kraznyk called danny a whore the nipple thing is in nice scene after with the child and baristan great that they show him directly because everybody that know baristan will know its him and everybody that doesnt wouldnt get even if they did it later on"

"brinson2000",2013-04-01,"610 the scene with tywintyrion was on point as well as margerys flea bottom scne and thats about it for this episode the sansalittlefinger scene completely takes all the suspense out of sansas eventual escape from kings landing seems like getting a girl that is willing to get naked on camera was more important than having dontos be here savior rob starks taking over harrenhal and finding qyburn is one of the biggest disasters of this episode and made absolutely no sensewhy not just have him at riverun and create the books plotline at harrenhalwhich brings me to another point what is the shows obsession with completely screwing all parts of the books dealing with harrenhal it has been completely assbackward from the time arya stepped foot in the castle until the most recent episode it isnt a complex storyline that takes place yet they have completely changed the books account of harrenhal at every turn in the show the scenes in the books that take place in harrenhal have grave implications in the overall plot and i am surprised that they would choose to completely change them in the show if anyone would like me to elaborate further on this please ask my biggest dissapointment came from the barristan selmy scene his hidding as whitebeard and eventual uncovering was one of my favorite parts of asos with the proper thought and makeup the crew could have easily created a character that the audience those that havent read the books would not have recognized and been just as surprised as i was reading the story i mean how do they explain dany magically getting a ship to take her to a land that hadnt even been discussed in season 2 astapor with that said another travesty was done with the exclusion of strong belwashands down he is one of my favorite characters all the way through adwd his one on one combat with the warrior from yunkai was one of my favorite scenes from any of the books and i was looking forward to seeing it in the show i would assume this scene if portrayed at all will be given to daario who i cant stand and will help to build his character i guess finding an actual person that is massively overweight but extremely athletic at the same time to play the character must have been too daunting a task for the shows staff overall i was extremely disappointed with this episode and felt as if the crew took the easy road to telling the story that grrm spent years of his life creating and putting his heart and soul in to i get that its an adaptation of the book but there is a reason they are so popular they create imagery and characters that the fans become invested in and if the show cannot portray that same emotion then i personally believe it falls short of its goal"

"Queen of Whores",2013-04-02,"probably my favorite premiere of the series im glad they didnt cram too much into the one episode and left some storylines for later like bran jaime and arya the good tyrion and tywin scene was excellent mostly due to it being lifted directly from the book and the performances of dinklage and dance barristans reveal i dont care that he was introduced earlier hes one of my favorite characters from the book so im glad to see him back dany and the unsullied i forget the slavers name but that scene was great all of davos scenes especially his talk with saan i think its spelt like that good to see that stannis looks more grey and worn like in the book the meh robb and catelyn in harrenhal felt like it could have just been moved to the second episode to give them more to do the cold open with sam was very anti climactic and disappointing but i guess we should be used to it by now with the show jon seeing the giant was great but while ciaran hinds is a great actor he doesnt bring much charisma to mance the bad why the hell is ros still in this show and how exactly is she an advisor to littlefinger argh and the ros and shae scene the two characters i hate the most on this show having a pointless conversation together 810 a solid premiere that sets up great stuff to come"
"Moseh Khayim",2013-04-02,"710 a slowmoving episode with some good dialogue and a thumbs up for some sidecharacters saan bronn best scene was obviously the conversation between tyrion and tywin where the showrunners definitely wanted to establish the fact that tywin is not a nice guy in season 2 they portrayed him as pretty likeable mostly because of his interaction with arya the credit he gained there he loses in this first episode i loved gleesons facial expressions and overall acting especially in the dinner scene at that point he wasnt the little brat he portrayed in earlier seasons he almost looked like a sane adult eekgif classbbcemoticon alteek  i liked seeing robb again even though it was just for a moment liked the reintroduction of bolton and karstark didnt really care for jon but then again i never really have the scenery shots were beautiful kings landing dragonstone and astapor perhaps this season clarkedaenerys can win me over a bit since she too hasnt been one of my favorites on the show or in the books"

"DutchGit",2013-04-02,"i gave it a 7 it was good but there was definitely something missing as a first episode it needs something to grasp viewers attention start with a bang the obvious scene for this would have been at least a more dramatic representation of the battle of the fist there was just nothing also i am very disappointed with the lack of strong belwas he would have added a comedy layer as dany is now surrounded by barristan and mormont hardly a barrel of laughs it would have made most of the future dany scenes more interesting imo also think robb is being presented as a bit of a knobhead i hope they will make him more likeable spoiler or the rw will get more of a well he had that coming reaction rather than a wtfff reaction"

"RSasoiaf",2013-04-02,"i will give it a 7 it is still really good television and i was close to giving an 8 the thing that keeps me from going into higher grades is that the show seems to keep its tendency to not be really made as a whole from episode to episode and now from season to season things are set up one way then they change then they change againit is still great but there seems a lack of overal management like several people are giving inputs to adapt the story and no one can clearly get everything fit together the example on this episode was quite clear at the start lucky enough everything else was great but the start was simply too disconected from last season sam starting where he does ghost showing up out of nowhere lord comander asking sam for the ravens we didnt even know about beforeit almost seems someone had seen a different season 2 ending before writting this one and someone forget to tell them they ended up editing it differently but ok rant awayalmost everything else is great for me and this is still great tv by all accounts jon  mance iâm ok not too enthusiast but it still works well enough i am on board with all who think jon is a bit emo but we will have to wait and see bronn  whore broon is amazing so i am all well with having more from him at least he was a character on the book so if he is working better on the show so bit it unleash him lets have him around more then tyrion  cersei mehnothing special what could be said about this scene is nothing happens not a particular good scene for either cersei or tyrion also stillthe line still makes me more clever then you deserved to be on screen and makes this worth the time smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  bronn again yeahhhhh i stand by my previous statement bronn works well on screen lets have him no issue with it davos  salador nice scene altough this one makes me wonder about saladorwhy could we not see him at the blackwater somewhere if he was to still be in the show and be used now and he felt quite in place in this episode but was this the second and last scene from him if this is soallasthe character had potential i think i am still feelling i would have liked seing him at the blackwater maybe at the end trying to lead some rearguard action or ordering someone to come with him for stannis robb at harrenhall ok fair enough makes total sense considering the plot changes on season 2 my take here is well played considering where they decided to go with the show and when they play it well i have no issue stillfrom my personal view i dont like this robb and the way he relates to his mother i guess it can make sense considering its an older robbmaybejust maybe but this really messes up the relationship bettween robb and cat or at least seems to but as this is got most likely next episode it will be like robb never arrested cat at alland i dont know if i just hope for that or not tywin  tyrion great amazing perfect scene well done butallasthis scene seems now a bit disconected after where they went with tywin on previous seasons tywin seemed to recognize tyrion at the end of season 1 he also seemed a lot nicer all along season 2 wellitâs nice to see we have the real tywin back where was he charles dance is trully something to behold tough and i am 100 confident he can take tywin the right way now if they let him hope they let him keep the style now sansa  shae  lf  ros meh again i think removing dontos makes sense seems like something necessary or at least wise to do but having shae and ros there in his place doesnt make for a necessary better dealat least for me havin lf revealing himself i can take it and understand it gives him a lot more to do now and i am totally fine with having more of him around just please dont make him do stupid stuff like on season 2 if we can sail clear from that i am fine with him being a bit more 1st stage ros can stay but please get her something better to do she is still not a character and still maybe a most used propwould they care to give her a character if they insist she has to stay around shae is still different from the book but at least she keeps consistent so i will give them the credit and wait to see where she will end up before judging if its a good story or not dany  jorah nice to see the dragons and the seasick dothraki davos  stanis  mel i enjoy davos stanis does really nothing for me but i think this is well done and looks good on tv blaming davos is consistent with the show makes davos a bit less awesome as he was in the books but that awesomness was already lost when they decided to go this way in season 2 glad they keep consistent here good scene to me marg  joff  cersei  loras enjoyed everything well done and they have me on board marg train so my respect for that i am now totally ok with the actress and the way they are going with marg feels quite good storywise danny and unsullied good not exactly like the book but cool enough and the main message was there perfect for me barristan  murder i have no problems with the murder atemp being from the warlocks makes sense inside the show the barristan reveal was cool to see so as for the moment i am an happy camper about it feelling could change depending on how this will impact the mechanics bettween danny  selmy and jorah but for now was well done and i am willing to take their train if it goes somewhere on track even if not exactly by the book edited by rsasoiaf 02 april 2013  0752 pm"

"Hound Dog",2013-04-03,"long time lurker to this site and finally decided to register and submit a post apart from a few scenes i was disappointed by this episode im not quite sure what it is about the show that bothers me so much but it really does that doesnt keep me from watching it though i dont get why they introduced dontos in s2 and then ignored him after that the scenes with lf always seem to me to be so obvious and scream hey viewer this guy is a snake look what a snake he is when i read the books he was so very enigmatic and his scattered scenes throughout the series only made me enjoy him that much more i suppose thats hard to replicate on screen when you dont have the advantage of specific character povs dontos on the dock or just go to the bloody godswood at night with sansa wouldve been so great nonreaders wouldve asked who the hell is this why deny them the surprise of having lf on the boat it was great in the books itd be great on tv too cant stand ros she drives me nuts i resent that shes been given such a huge role in the show especially when youre leaving out characters like the reeds i know i know theyre coming this season but that isnt the point in the books the reeds were so integral to brans character development ros is just an annoying set of boobs and has a confident swagger about her that i resent because shes not in the books no fist but everyones commenting about that and rightly so that was just poorly mishandled i suppose budget had something to do with that i imagined mance to be grittier and to have a bit more of an edgy swagger to him than he did on the show the scene between he and jon was all right but i didnt feel that sense of ohh the king beyond the wall here he is that i got when reading i think its due to the guy they have playing jon he always has that stupid dullard look on his face and i find that all of his scenes lack emotion or intensity the scene with tywin and tyrion of course was great and davos is awesome they cast all of those roles splendidly i thought jaime would be in this episode as his is the first pov chapter in sos but it only means hell show up next episode so not a big deal i think the biggest peeve i have with the show is that it leaves nothing to the imagination in the books youre constantly guessing whether that be plot direction or character motives the tv show lays it all out for you eg that davos and stannis reunion scene davos just couldve gone to a cell like in the books leaving viewers to wonder wtf is going on with stannis letting you anticipate the moment when they finally do speak again ah i dont mean to sound so negative about it i just greatly favour the books and i really resent any deviations from it"

"flyersfan2588",2013-04-03,"a couple things i felt the barristan reveal was necessary  i mean we wouldve recognized his face and it would have been awkward if they waited 8 episodes but then it messes up his purpose for revealing himself so late because he wanted to see if dany was as mad as her father i just hope were not in for a whole season of jorah being jealous and when is barristan going to call him out for being a snitch the tywintyrion scene was one of the best scenes in recent memory just knowing what happens down the road i assume season finale of 4 made that epic but i was disappointed with jon snows first encounter with mance in the books mance tells him about when he climbed the wall and attended the feast for robert and jon goes into that spiel about well did you see where i was seated etc etc i felt that this was much stronger than his reasoning in the first episode yea it was a bit of a slow episode but understandable because in 54 min they need to remind the viewers where every character is at but no bran arya jaime or brienne curiously on a side note i think that its great to take the show for what it is and not compare which is better  the books or the series  but enjoy the fact that they compliment each other its great for us to watch the show because we know what is generally going to happen and we have that dramatic irony in our pockets so were able to pick up on all the little things that foreshadow whats to come im actually surprised that the show is so popular because i cant figure out how people keep up with all the characters settings and such i talk to my roommate about it asking what he feels about margaery or davos and hes like whos that"

"nara",2013-04-04,"not sure i like the introduction of qyburn this way putting my reasoning within book spoiler code spoiler if he almost died at the hands of lannisters why would he be so helpful to cersei during the wos and with robert strong this is kinda off topic but am i the only one who found herself agreeing a little with tywin during his conversation with tyrion never thought that would happen not sure if its the power of charles dance tyrion talks about how much he enjoyed being hand tywin sees it more as a duty than something to enjoy and seems annoyed that tyrion treats it as something fun tyrion did spend an awful lot of time with a prostitute even though the kingdoms were at war tywin gave him great responsibility and power and he sullied the family name by hanging with prostitutes tyrion acts as though tywin took something away from him the lodgings the position the hand pin even though he knew all along that he was just temporarily in the position of hand that being said tyrion did save kl including cersei and the kids and should have been shown respect and some attention from his father when he was ill however i can see why tywin doesnt take him seriously"

"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-05,"yeah tormund was important as a likeable character to show that not all wildlings were like the stereotype personally i found him really annoying in the books but he was still likeable the show version is just completely unlikeablethis was the one book with interesting jon material imo so im disappointed that his scene was so boringi posted in the ros and shae thread that the sansa scene wouldve been better with sansa just sitting there watching the ships until lf comes up to her the sansashaeros scene was one of the few scenes that passed the bechdal test so im glad it was included moreover the conversation between shae and sansa was very important and included a lot of foreshadowing the rosshae conversation was also important too it established the norths loyalty to the starks and set up shaes mistrust of littlefinger which i expect will lead to him being sent to the valesansa was the most important part of the scene cutting shae and ros from the scene would have done a disservice to sansa"

"Throng of Mice and Mire",2013-04-02,"it is really odd to have ghost just abandon jon for seemingly no reason it would seem that if the wolf can sense how jon is feeling he might notice that jon is in a spot of bother at the minute but hes clearly far more in tune with sams troubles why even have him show up then anyway hes not even needed to save sam the way they did it either because mormont was there 3 seconds later to set the white alight maybe they are trying to answer the question of why he wasnt around for the fight with the halfhand at the end of s2 when he was conspicuously absent why not just leave him missing and show up when jon needs him on the show and have us wonder what he might be doing rather than be confused by what he actually is doing"

"jugdesh258",2013-04-03,"he lost to brandon so hes a pencilneckreally we already know hes one of the most cunning characters in got he doesnt forget the details and end up where he is your post is a reach if anythings a reach hes on the small council while brandon and ned are deadfighting brandon over cat has zero to do with whether or not he would recognize arya in this situationsorry if you think i am mocking your favorite character it is the recounting of the story in the book that suggests that littlefinger was in fact foolish for taking on such a strapping young lad as brandon starknot me characters in the book mock him behind his back regardless of his accomplishments the scar is his reminderall the characters in the book have flaws they either overcome them or are consumed by them i am just voting that littlefinger is headed for a crash hard to say with grrm if littlefinger had that attention to detail he might be able to avoid it"
"Elba the Intoner",2013-04-03,"of course littlefinger was lying how can you tell because his lips were moving and words were coming out of his mouth if he had recognized her he would have made use of that somehow and as for the arguments that if he didnt recognize arya then that scene with him taking little looks at her would just be silly and have no purpose  bingo that as well as the chase by amory lorch later on in that same episode was a poorly written scene that turned aryas stay in harenhall which should have been dangerous into a joke see rans analysis of that episode here"
"Sun",2013-04-03,"i remember seeing recognition on aidan gillens face in his harrenhal scene with arya i thought last year that he had recognized her but chose to not to inform tywin for some reason i suppose from the show writers point of view that scene could be read as the first inkling the viewers get of littlefingers true agenda as a man ultimately working for himself not the lannisters"
"Lux Umbar",2013-04-03,"well kind of too bad about the definitive answer from grrm i was kind of enjoying the speculation but as i was speculating it finally struck me that not recognizing arya  or not being capable of doing anything immediately with that knowledge whether tywin also recognized her or not  was far more in keeping with the story arc of the books correct me if im wrong but in the books to this point lf has not actually seen arya anywhere after shes left kl so any motives he might have in the series for filing away that tidbit of info for later consumption dont strike me as going anywhere"
"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-04-03,"can anybody remember when lf saw arya or spoke to her in the previous 2 seasonshe saw her in harrenhall in season 2 and spoke to her at the hands tourney when the moutain kills the new knight from the vale in season one also it appears that arya might have listened to the hound burned face story but who knows yet littlefinger outright lies to tywin telling him tyrion had an interesting proposal for catlyn concerning her daughters tyrions proposal couldnt have included arya cause when lf left the capital it was already clear that arya wasnt available at allit didnt matter they offered her both daughters even if they didnt have them both they hope that she will turn up but as more time goes by more and more people conclude she must be dead i think lf is preparing his next change of sides  and running a high risk at that what if somebody tells tywin oh we lost that stark girl but lf was supposed to find her tywin will remember baelishs lie even without figuring out who his cupbearer was even after the battle of blackwater no one dares to inform tywin of aryas missing otherwise petyr baelish wouldnt get the lordship of harrenhal but a fast beheading littlefinger has a pressing need to leave the city with or without sansa stark readgif classbbcemoticon altread edited for spellingi think youre taking it a little too far lf knows arya is missing but it doesnt change the fact that tyrion offers jaime lannister for both the stark girlsif tywin brings it up lf just has to say that the deal was made for both girls even though they dont have both of themthe better question is did twyin deduce who she wasit could be he did since the scene is not in the book and he knew that kl had sansa and she was a good enough bargaining chip for jamie he had other ideascould be he knew that jamie was indeed on his way back to kli am very curious this season how twyin reacts and what he has to say if it is reveledtheres no way tywin deduced who she was tywin wouldve taken her with him to kl when he left harrenhall shes too valuable of a hostage to leave there"
"Wong Chia Chi",2013-04-14,"i would like to think littlefinger recognised arya because it would be stupid for someone as perceptive as hes presented to be not to but at the same time it could just as easily have been a red herring put in by the writers to jerk viewer around and create cheap suspense that whole arc was used for that purpose it seemed for the most parti think hes probably lying this is tv littlefinger after all who has no subtlety at all compared to book littlefingeri guess well have to wait and see dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno "
"Gendels Children",2013-04-27,"agreed unless the shows adds in some new storyline im sticking with littlefinger bullshittingyeah what he said could easily have been misread you could see it as his simply stating that arya was also meantioned when talking to cat letting sansa deduct what ever she wanted from that when she says aryas alive he makes to attempt to asure her or correct her i think that lf thinks he may have seen her but not sure"
"aWildlingontheIronThrone",2013-05-08,"littlefinger totally recognized arya lies just as easily sufficed for his purposes leaving her to whatever doom in the wilderness suits him fine he has so little to gain by outing her to tywin  feeling like i know something you dont know might really float his boat dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno "

"WiDMNDBAMMD",2014-03-17,"indeed that is when he told her the story of what happened to the hound from his brother â littlefinger actually tells sansa about it with arya overhearing it â a couple days ago bryan cogman tweeted this after he decided to rewatch season 13 before he started writing for season 5 just to refresh himself â currently cogman is the only writter for the show besides dd and grrm  â httpstwittercom047390764933120 â â we never specified in the script  i have no idea what aidan thinks but i think lf does recognize arya gotrewatch theoldgodsandthenew â and cogman has also commented about how littlefinger couldve been lying to sansa about seeing her sister in episode 31 so its something that is still up in the air as far as the writersscripts go â i would think that sansa might possibly ask lf if her sister is still alive or where he saw arya or something this seasonfour not after so bryan is either really cleverly addressing something that gets resolved if the show does address it this year or it is not addressed this yearâ"

"aFeastForDragons",2013-04-01,"for most of us its not about there being no battle its how they introduced sam and reunited him with all his brothers a much better intro would have been the one from the book in sams pov where he is struggling to run surrounded by all his brothers fleeing the fist we have no idea what happened but all we know is they had to retreat and suffered some serious losses the synopsis of the battle could have been filled in later at crasters for non bookreaders it must be kind of confusing how sam managed to flee passed several hundred wights"
"DragonAge93",2013-04-01,"gotta admit im a little disappointed i kinda hyped it up to people i knew that the opening would be spectacular but it was a copout they really shouldnt have ended season 2 like that if they werent going to show anything and i dont know why people think sam the slayers not gonna happen sam didnt kill a white walker on the fist he killed one when they were retreating through the forest so well definitely get sam the slayer in episode 3 at the latest and in the trailers we see a white walker roaming through the dark forest so maybe its hunting sam and thats when he kills it"
"Khal-a-bunga",2013-04-01,"i wouldve liked to have seen something smallscale to represent the attack on the fist but im neither surprised nor disappointed that we didnt see it it was the first scene of the season and established that the nights watch members who had gone beyond the wall had been severely crippled there are several shots of dozens of men with the nw throughout season two and not even half of that number is seen when mormont rescues sam beyond that im not sure what was so confusing about the opening if the audience is so confused about how or why sam is alive then surely they were just as confused when will somehow survived his encounter with the white walkers in the opening of the pilot which also happened albeit with a different character in the books so my assumption supported through precedence is that the white walker meant to allow sam to run free and that the army shambled past him on their way to the fist sam makes a run for it at one point and is found by the lord commander and the rest of the survivors nothing too complicated here as for ghost being with them its a nonissue jon sends him away at one point in asos anyway so this isnt really much of a change at all when it comes down to it i imagine well see sam the slayer in either episode four or five given the title of the fourth episode so thats not something im particularly concerned about either"
"The House of Dude",2013-04-01,"its also an exaggeration to say the nights watch has 12 men they may only have 12 men left in the scouting party which wouldnt be ridiculous but the rest of the force is on the other side of the wall i dont think we need to worry about large numbers david and dan mentioned a blackwater style battle next season and it would have to be the battle of the wall i thinki doubt its going to be that one the season previews have mance climbing the wall which makes me think theyre going to leave out the battle for the wall completely the battle for castle black or the red wedding will probably take a substantial amount of the budget"

"LordStoneheart",2013-04-01,"the issue i have is that as others have said it doesnt not explain at all how sam got away when it clearly suggests the white walker looks right at him last season also this is mostly because i hate zombies but i really dont like that they dont make the distinction between the others and wights so nonbook readers consider this part of the story a zombie thing its not like that at all wights are other puppets they dont spread infection then again i think some book readers might think the others are just zombies also"

"pleonasm",2013-04-03,"its a question of budget priorities i think benioff and weiss made a big mistake in not allocating some time and money to this sequence this episode alone was filled dozens possibly a 100 or more effects shots yes  watching a dragon swoop down and snag a fish was neat but also expensive was it a must have i do wonder especially when someone could have creatively put together a scary compelling scene to rival the prolouge sequence from the pilot i have two issues of them skipping the fight or showing a more detailed aftermath of the fight folks running for their lives chaos etc1 it was setup as the cliffhanger of season 2 it needed some sort of competent resolution not mormont and dozen extras standing around holding a torch2 it needed to demonstrate to the audience the nights watch and possibly the realm as a whole was woefully ill prepared to deal with the white walkers and their undead army this threat is the real danger to the realm and not the petty conflicts south of the wall"
"Teren_Kanan",2013-04-03,"i didnt expect the battle to be shown but i certainly hoped for and am disappointed by the lack of some horror elements of the scene why this is all happening during the daytime i will never understand assuming filming there at night is difficult it should be night time too dark to see at least toss some scenes out with brothers fleeing from unseen horrors screams maybe a quick few shots of zombies glowing blue eyes in the distance just a quick scene of how awful that fight went from everyone it didnt have to be an expensive cgi battle just some quick scenes of defeat and terror barely taking up more time than the black screen  battle sounds did and then move on to sam running away the way it comes off in the tv show is that they fended off the undead hoard and are now just standing around deciding what to do instead of a madly fleeing the area as everyone is dying all around the scene doesnt give off any urgency and the terror element is removed when its in broad albeit snowy daylight and im nit picking here but having ghost attack the wight here in this throw away scene and not having ghost involved in jon vs halfhand feels like a slap  edited by terenkanan 03 april 2013  0116 am"

"protar",2013-04-03,"i do have to wonder why if iceland was so expensive a troublesome did they choose to film there it certainly looks very beautiful and cinematic but its not like there arent other such places hell ireland can look pretty stunning itself and it looks a lot closer to beyond the wall does in the books and indeed the scenes in the haunted forest where shot in ireland and the fist is supposed to be nestled within that so i guess this can be blamed on dds decision to go with somewhere very pretty rather than somewhere practical and somewhat pretty but even in iceland id still say it could have been done especially with that little tidbit about the ravens thank you elmis"

"Ampris",2013-04-04,"tadco26you know that they cant save money from a last season you have a budget per season if you dont use it all youre not going to get whats left for next season and yes they could handle it better maybe it was better to have cut when sam saw the wights and wait when jon visited the fist next episode we think theyre all dead than we see that sam lives but they need to write somethingpersonally i liked the way that they didnt show the battle that way it remains a mystery how they fight and it will be more epic once the real battle with the white walkers occure and for not showing that there was a battle people have blood over their face and i liked it that you dont see the bodys before jons chapter if they had shown the battle people would be moaning about that scene because we already know there was a battle people dieddid you watch the same episode because as far as i heard mormont stated there was a big battle and that most had died as far as i know he isnt a liar i think its a beautiful thing we didnt had the battle now the mystery remains and showing the battle would also made some thing worse like when we have the big battle at the end of the series we would have had already saw that on screen boringbut why not be happy that they saved money for more important things like the rw that doesnt have a second run in the show a battle with the others we havei watched twice and i dont remember mormont saying anything about a battle all i remember is him asking sam about the ravens and saying they needed to warn the wall before everyone theyve ever known is dead anyone else remember mormont talking about a battle hbo is still replaying it so maybe ill go dvr it again and rewatch"
"Head of The Ned",2013-04-04,"no mormont didnt say anything about a battle but his face was kinda bloodied as was everyone else with him so it indicated some shit went down i thought they would have at least shown sam sending the ravens while the battle was happening outside with a few quick shots of fire arrows being shot at the army of wights then intro then the retreat edited by head of the ned 04 april 2013  0725 pm"

"Snookson",2013-04-05,"forgive me if this has already been mentioned as i have not read all the posts in this thread but i just had an idea since ghost is with the survivors of the nw beyond the wall and not with jon maybe we will get some sort of flashback of the battle through ghosts eyes when jon sees the remnants of the fight this would help introduce the nonbook readers more to warging as well i feel like this could help tie everything up nicely as to what happened at the fist along with adding an integral part of the story into one scene thoughts"

"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2013-04-03,"of all the ros scenes thus far this was about my equal favourite it was important to reinforce at the start of the season the back story of sansa and why she is still important despite being set aside by joffrey and also to reestablish the menacing character of baelish the other scene i liked was when she was leaving winterfell that had a lot of charm going for it other than that i really find myself grimmacing my way through ros scenes for me it is not the actor in fact i give her a lot of credit because she has the toughest job in the cast all the other actors have the books as a fall back guide to develop their roles esme doesnt have that  only the advice of the writers as the script lands in her hands and as the role is a bucket role her story flipflops i am firmly on the side of those who argue that ros was not required for the development of theons character this could have been done perfectly well with leering looks and comments at serving girls the ros character was not required for the tyrion scene in winterfell  in fact she was so inconsequential that i forgot she was in it she was not required for the joffrey scene she does help with the development of littlefinger but i really question whether the importance justifies the time and emphasis put on it i love a good sex scene as much as the next redblooded human but i emphasise good a couple of the brothel scenes just had me scratching my head thinking what the heck was that all about the entire ros character development just irks against the flow of character development in the story perhaps now with a guaranteed contract for 2 seasons dd can actually develop her into a replacement role for one or more other characters with small yet significant roles edited by angalin 03 april 2013  0348 pm"

"gregorio",2013-04-05,"the roose change video is silly the ability to recite simple wedding vows talisas lack of small clothes and no accent do not constitute evidence that shes a spy the only real evidence this video presented was the letter which everyone noticed whether a dedicated book reader or one time accidental viewer the letter and talk of being a spy was so blatant i thought it was either a red herring covering up for the real spy or a playful shout out to the readers similar to cerseis remark on tyrions nose  or both i admit the business about her father being the dismissed lannister is interesting but i dont like it because its way too subtle the rest is a classic case of the conspiracy theorist trying to tailor the evidence to his or her hypothesis i mean im just as impressed that robb was able to perfectly recite his wedding vows i dont imagine he stayed up long hours practicing them with maester luwin as a boy regardles of culture isnt this the type of thing we nail down right before the wedding have we seen anyone in small clothes in this series doesnt hbo just want to fill the nudity quota here and i agree with those who said that talisa as a spy would damage the rw storyline the villains are the boltons the freys and tywin  not an invented character the outrage is the freys breaking guest right and their depravity  not a false wife many of us may be able to keep it all in perspective with the benefit of book knowledge but for the average tvonly viewer when they think of the rw if it plays out according to this theory they will think of it largely in terms of talisas betrayal because they bought into this love story and her character was built up over two seasons whereas the boltons and freys were not i believe that is incredibly problematic for the integrity of the rw and the story moving forward it might be cool that talisa is a spy but is it worth the risk that the betrayal of the wife usurps the betrayal of the bannermen in the minds of the tv viewers i prefered the westerling story like most but the westerling story and talisaspy story share a fundamental weakness which the shows writers might be responding to in simplying it their plots are too eleaborate and rely on the stars lining up perfectly  something that rarely happens in the real world in this case robb has to fall for the girl marry her the freys and boltons both have to side with tywin down the road and the freys cant know talisa was really a spy because then tywin shares significant blame in robbs betrayal etc the best laid plans of mice and men its more realistic that robb blunders and tywin seizes the opportunity rather than that lord tywin plays matchmaker and places the fate of his campaign in the hands of this young woman"

"Ser Luke.",2013-04-07,"i think its not really a bad change at all first of all theres only so many great child actors out there and this show already has a ton also if they want to include the scene with irri they can use her instead something a child actor obviously couldnt do"
"cuendillar",2013-04-08,"that sex scene is almost certainly not going to take place unless possibly exclusively as a dany apologizing afterwards  as she did to irri there wont be any actual touching for sure there wasnt in the theonosha matchup that one was made totally obvious due to context and later comments dd doesnt always take any excuse for showing sex onscreen emilia actually said in an interview connected to season 1 that the sex scene she was most uncomfortable with was the sex lesson with doreah due to its girlgirl component that was a fullyclothed scene and much too important for her relationship with drogo to omit it pretty much had to be in the show the irri scene is much more explicit so much so that i think shell refuse or be extremely reticent about it and its not important enough to contractually bludgeon her into it i dont think it serves any particular purpose as dany isnt lesbian nor is there any plotcharacterwise need for such a scene besides one of the key elements about missandei in the books is that shes knowledgeable about so much while completely ignorant of any sexual matters this blind spot of hers is rather interesting and i think it might very well come to have significance down the line ageing her up doesnt really change this as shes likely trained almost as harshly as the unsullied"

"LordStoneheart",2013-04-10,"well i dont think emilia should feel obliged to do sex scenes thats almost rape but i do think the sex scene with irri was important for the book danys development as she does think about it a few times later when contemplating getting with daario if they include the scene with missandei in place of irri it could work as more than just insert girlongirl scene for our male audience though few might see it that way but in no way do i think the actress should have to do it just because it was in the books"

"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2013-04-16,"theres so much higher chance of getting a good actor if you arent casting a child dd lucked out with several child actors but as good as maisie williams has been as arya she was found very late in the process and apparently no other girl had been close to her it seems smart to make missandei older since its a far smaller role and less work can go into casting her nothing of real importance will change either and it will be easier to give her actions made by other characters in the books this wayall characters have been aged up as well so in terms of the shows normal standards shed still be about in her mid teens so the change is also smaller than it might seem at first glancemaise is 16 she only looks 12"

"Tywin's bastard",2013-04-02,"as stereotypical as bronn or moresoidk pretty much the scene outside of yunkai is better than any scene i know if involving any of those guys and would make for some shocking tv that would have to be talked abouttheres plenty of examples of mistakes in the second bolded area for example the single combat scene would make for better tv than anything ros greatjohn doloros pod etc have done there are pretty easy replacements for those folks as well hot pie toodefinitely more than bronn although i do like belwas so i dont have a problem with him i just acknowledge that he isnt a character of importancei disagree about that scene as well while its a good battle scene the others have plenty of scenes that actually helps show new depth with characters character growth or to tell things that is mainly told through inner monologue in the books the characters you mention have already been cast in previous seasons so they didnt compete with belwas but belwas competes with the entire existing cast and all the potential new characters of the third season i see easier use of belwas actions to help establish other characters more quickly daario naharis in particular while the others dont really have things that would benefit others to the same extent"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-02,"i cant truly be the only person who thought strong belwas was a waste of space in the books good riddancewell fortunately he didnt take up much space in the text"
"aFeastForDragons",2013-04-02,"funny you know how tormund is just by watching a 3 minute scene with him wait till you see the next couple of episodes before complainingfirst impressions mean a lot hopefully im proved wrong but it looks like he is going to be axed at the castle black battle"
"jmk51",2013-04-02,"yep usually works that way the tormund character is not going to be funny you can tell by his tone if he was going to be bombastic like in the book they would have introduced him that waybut not having belwas makes sense there are more fighters around dany in the book than the show could possibly have roles forso when he said paraphrasing everyone must kneel everytime i fart that isnt his crude humorbragadocio what did you expect a 5 minute monologue about his member the first time jon snow was introduced to mance"
"Big Daddy Dave",2013-04-02,"i really enjoyed belwas in the book belwas shitting in front of everybody was a riot not to mention his character added some much needed comedy in the series but if i step back and look at the show objectively that is if i was making the show id cut him too every second hes onscreen getting a line is time taken away from danys story moving forward and the tension that will come out of selmy mormont and dany scenes is going to be worth it it was also worth jumping past selmys disguise just getting on with it was the right choice edited by big daddy dave 02 april 2013  1024 am"
"Gordon Freeman",2013-04-02,"i think the point i was trying to make about belwas is that he does play a small role time wise but why not just have selmy introduce him as his companion no crazy back story needed he wouldnt take up a lot of time with a lengthy scenes because he never says anything he never did in the books either only briefly bragging about his fighting prowess for me thats what i got from him in the book was just this physically strong presence around danny and you dont know until later on what his true intentions are towards her this just added an element of suspense and on screen it would be aesthetically pleasing to see some huge guy with a little vest stalking around being lazy all the time then just as in the book when danny questioned his skill and worth he would go out destroy the champion of meereen with ease besides its not like they didnt have scenes that couldve been cut like margaery spending all that time with the orphans even the books didnt go into such detail except to just tell you high gardenmargaery had been giving out food to the city and that the small folk loved her or as previously mentioned the scene with bronn and the whore i think both couldve been cut to give selmy and belwas a true introduction edited by gordon freeman 02 april 2013  1043 am"
"Greywolf2375",2013-04-02,"could belwas not be introduced in season 4 his only key role is to spoiler lead danys men through the sewers of meereen  so surely he could come in laterwhile he is fun to have around he isnt a key character  what he does barristan can do or jorah can do id enjoy seeing him but not having him isnt a continuity or plot loss"
"rodrik Cassel",2013-04-02,"i agree that he is not a key character but he is the fun cahracter for essos we have mrmember behind the wall greatjonumber with the northerners bronn and tyrion in kingslanding and stannis with well stannis biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd and btw it would have been a little gift to all the bookreadersi demand compensation for his absence eg a 5 minute monologue about his member"
"DutchGit",2013-04-02,"i am definitely disappointed about him not being in you need a funny side kick from time to time also i thought thormund was quite funny there is definitely room for him to grow in the role i am sure it will get better when the jonthormund bromance will develop"
"Young Nan",2013-04-02,"i have a strange notion that they are cutting the comic relief characters they have completely changed tormund so that he has the personality of a potatoe the reason behind is maybe to keep tyrion and bronn as the funny ones thats the only reason i can think ofi just hope they keep tormunds braggadocio about his memberi know rite i was really looking forward to tormund and instead theres some melancholy skinny guy who doesnt even talk about his member i was really disappointed with the casting of basically all of the wildlings except for ygritte shes too pretty for the role but got the personality down imo"
"Holdfast",2013-04-02,"i dont think the show needs strong belwas hes entertaining in the books but so are others that well probably never get to see its hard to introduce new characters to an already packed list in a season that only covers about 10 hours unless theyre essential to the storyline and i dont think sb is i did like the reveal of barristan selmy at the outset again thinking this is the best way it could have been handled within the confines of the show"
"PetyrPunkinhead",2013-04-02,"the dockside assassination attempt was a disappointment on several levels content wise i of course miss strong belwas and the interplay he and whitebeardselmy had i also think the reveal of selmys true self wouldve been a great show moment and im not sure why the showrunners cheated the audience out of that but visually it was just shot and stage din such a mediocre cliched way hooded guy in obvious pursuit of daeny then the hood comes off and its gasp some dude the tv audience saw for maybe 10minutes total on screen in s1 then jorah exposition has to chime in and explain who the fuck this guy is to everyone just a meh bit of storytellingso much whiningyes lets have the show introduce one of very few foreign looking and sounding characters and them have him act and speak like a gigantic moron im sure that would go down wellselmy was never at the sc meetings in s1 so its possible that he will not know that jorah was a spyehhh i find that a stretch he can still fuck up shit for jorah and his kahlessi crush hopefully selmy and jorah will have the same adversarial relationship on the show to keep things interesting in camp kahlessi"
"Mulled Wino",2013-04-02,"definitely more than bronn although i do like belwas so i dont have a problem with him i just acknowledge that he isnt a character of importancei disagree about that scene as well while its a good battle scene the others have plenty of scenes that actually helps show new depth with characters character growth or to tell things that is mainly told through inner monologue in the books the characters you mention have already been cast in previous seasons so they didnt compete with belwas but belwas competes with the entire existing cast and all the potential new characters of the third season i see easier use of belwas actions to help establish other characters more quickly daario naharis in particular while the others dont really have things that would benefit others to the same extentthey save a battle scene and get a single combat scene saving  if daario does the same thing ill be satisfied for sure"
"LordStoneheart",2013-04-02,"ive never thought of belwas as very important to be honest except for a certain spoiler bowl of locusts of course even then that could be very easily retconned just like the manticore was also my brother instantly recognized barristan and he hasnt watched season one in a while he never read the books apart from book one prologue i think it was a good decision to reveal right away"

"wolverine",2013-04-02,"it sounds like as the show continues it will depart more and more from the books which is logical imo"
"Mr Smith",2013-04-02,"my care cup is empty as far as strong belwas is concerned decent character yes but by no means necessary its a lot harder to keep track of characters in a tv show than in a book especially when you dont have martins little references i think d and d have done what they needed to do and good on them for it two many characters can kill a show like this particularly for nonbook readers ive been trying to work out how on earth they could keep aws identity a secret from the audience again much harder in a tv show than in a book and i actually think having barristan out in the open will make the tension between him and jorah more interesting  jorah will know that barristan has his number and will be edgier than ever"

"Kasrith",2013-04-02,"1 then karstark says 200 northmen dead and those who killed them are roaming free  obviously referring to jamiehello jamie didnt kill these guys its fking impossible2 so what is king robbs first reaction on seeing all these slaughtered prisoners is it to proclaim bloody vengeance give the order to execute lannister prisoners in retaliation nope its to lock his mom up sorry dude im feeling less and less sympathetic towards yourobb3 first of all robb  show  has a secret wedding so no one knows he has broken his vow yet so what leads to the rw maybe walder frey will keep demanding the wedding to be held at once and then robb will have to admit gee sorry i married this hot volantene chickive numbered your points so that they are easier to address1 no one obviously referred to jaime as the one who killed them but to whoever actually did since they werent present at the scene they obviously are roaming freely2 locking up his mom in front of those who may hold her even remotely responsible for some of these lannister actions especially for letting jaime go is exactly what he should have done and i gave him respect and props for that something i noticed in that scene is that he didnt do this in front of karstark and bolton since they had already left this may prove to be significant for later events if karstark especially thinks that robb isnt doing anything at all about his motherrobb is already on a campaign of bloody vengeance what would the point of him demanding more blood be at this point his people are tired of blood of fighting and may even hold this whole thing in contempt and thus partially blame the starks for having 200 northmen at harrenhal to begin withfinally 3 we dont know if his troupe is aware of the secret wedding they have traveled together for a while to reach harrenhal and id be very surprised if he doesnt treat her like his queen in front of everyone by now even if he has kept it a secret to this point the lannisters are still looking for a way to get to him since they cant do it in battle tywin has expressed his wish to aid robb fail that being said bolton could provide information on the wedding or even talisa herself if you believe that very popular video thats floating around which claims she is a lannister agentalso there is plenty of time to involve edmure and get sympathy toward him as cats brother and robbs uncle since they will be traveling to riverrun very soon if they are at the same keep it makes sense that they would spend plenty of screen time together and the fact that they will be there for a funeral allows the sympathy to flow edited by kasrith 02 april 2013  0636 pm"

"WhiteWalder",2013-04-02,"i rewatched s03e01 again last night and i could not help thinking that by hbo not revealing barristan selmy as whitebeard it set up jorah mormont to die instead of being banished by dany here is my thinking in the books after whitebeard reveals himself as barristan he tells dany that he could not reveal himself as such in qarth because he knew there was spy for king robert accompanying her dany then realizes that the spy must be jorah dany asks them both to go away but then sends both jorah and barristan with 20 men on a mission that will either kill them or prove their loyalty after a successful mission barristan is forgiven but jorah is not in the book jorah is banished or will be killed if seen by dany again why would it set up jorahs death to not reveal barristan as whitebeard in the books when both barristan and jorah are thought to be traitors there is a feeling from dany that she cannot lose the two closest people to her and her advisors when dany figures out that jorah was the spy for king robert he continuously deflects her ire towards barristan like a child i am a spy well barristan helped the usurper robert he is much worse than me dany thinks about why she should forgive the two i think without the betrayal from barristan all of danys wrath will be directed towards jorah there will not be a sense of losing both her advisors and those closest to her all at once there will be only the one person who has betrayed her there will be nobody for jorah to deflect danys attention towards and all her ire will come on him at once i dont think this leaves any room for redemption or forgiveness it sets up jorah to go on a solo mission to mereen a solo mission would sign his death warrant or dany might just kill him with blood and fire what are your thoughts"
"Kuroiga",2013-04-02,"the main reason was that the entire audience would recognize barristan anyway and since jorah had seen barristan before he was exiled he would have to recognize him too it would be pretty stupid if everyone pretended not to know the greatest knight in all of westeros smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "

"Ser Edmure Tully",2013-04-01,"i kind of liked the whole did you see where they put the bastard thing but i can see why they changed it in the show for one it draws the viewers mind back to crasters keep where fairly important events will take place this season the thing i really missed was mances story about his cloak and why he left the watch although we might still get it"
"victim",2013-04-01,"i liked this change too at this point we know how much jon hates being a bastard and the more he complains about it the less i like him as a character like when tyrion wallowed about his misfortune throughout a dance with dragons jons purpose in the books is to be one of a few characters who knows about and actively tries to stop the white walker invasion the show is trying to make him less of an emo and more of a hero  so no complaints here the part of this scene i wasnt crazy about was mance i didnt need to hear the red cloak story but i would have liked an explanation as to how he knew jon was ned starks bastard did he just happen to know that neds bastard joined to watch and then assumed jon was he or is he going to get into more detail later please be the second one"
"Nezzer",2013-04-01,"i also think his reasoning was better in the show in the nights watch it doesnt matter much if you are a lord a bastard or a commoner jon barely even mentioned the nights watch in his explanation in the book i dont know how mance thought that was convincing mance is much smarter in the show apparently my only gripe with that scene is the same as victims i missed mances story about climbing the wall and infiltrating winterfell that was a great story i wish they hadnt cut at least they can still include it and i really hope they do"

"kwak76",2013-04-01,"i prefer the book version over the tv version  in the book version if i remember correctly one of the core reason why mance left the night watch is because he fell in love and found a woman im not sure if they have mance wife around in the tv version  most likely not since in the book version i think he was singing or playing something to his wife in the book version john left the night watch because not only was he a bastard but i think john was able to connect with mance in that he has nothing back home  what i mean is that as a bastard he will get nothing at winter fell and joining the night watch for what to die for no good cause its more than john being a bastard by joining mance its a chance for john to build a new life outside the 7 kingdom  just like mance left the night watch because of love not sure if i make sense but thats what i gather from reading the book but i think i understand why the tv version cut it out its just more simple to explainbut the weakness of that is that the night watch was created to fight the white walkers etc"
"TomBadgerlock",2013-04-01,"i like the change its hard for a modern audience to grasp just how much jon hates being a bastard especially given half of us watching were probably born out of wedlock and no one cares in the books we have the benefit of being inside his head and we can learn his rationale and his insecurities in the show its more difficult this change nicely sets up jons future story ie the reason why he allies with the wildlings after becoming lc"

"Bluesnow",2013-04-02,"i preferred the book reasoning the wildlings believe in freedom from societal systems that burden the south and embrace merit over lineage jons reasoning that he wants to join the wildlings because he was the bastard his entire life makes sense you can argue that on the wall being a bastard doesnt matter but the reality is he only went to the wall in the first place because there was no other place for him and mance saw that at the party because his reason directly associates his very personal back story to the strong ideals of the wildlings it was the perfect excuse the baby killing thing was pulled out of no where i guess in the show they made a bigger deal out of it and threw in that whole scene for extra suspense maybe it would have worked if there was more build up to this decision or if they had explained it better it was so rushed i had to go back and rewatch that scene just to make sure i got it right edited by bluesnow 02 april 2013  0732 pm"
"MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat",2013-04-03,"it was a very good change imo for one there was no way they could include the whole mance was at winterfell during the royal visit story to set it up in the scene like it was in the book thus the original reason was not going to work or couldnt play out in the same way i love it in the book but if they tried to make it work without the set up it would of fell very very flat the reason the show gave was possibly even better and called in a more recent event from last season but also did tv viewers the added bonus of reorienting them with the more important back story info that the free folk are decedents of the first men like jon and that they are just as dedicated to fightingsurviving the true enemy if not far more so"
"Mr Smith",2013-04-03,"although i really liked jons reasoning for leaving the nw in the book im totally fine with the change for several reasons firstly its a totally valid one second it seems a more persuasive argument to put to this mance who seems a lot more solem than the book mance but most importantly for me i think it leaves the viewer somewhat unsure as to whether jon really is still loyal to the nights watch and i think that would be a great thing for his arc in the book we were always sure of his true loyalties because we were inside his head i think making it more uncertain adds a lot of depth to jons arc a slight aside i personally think this was kit harringtons best scene to date up till now ive felt his performances while good lacked a certain amount of maturity though that suited his character in some scenes i wish hed dropped the angry little boy act in season 2 this scene gave me huge hope for his portrayal of jon this season i thought his sentiments about the purpose of the nights watch in defending the realms of men from the others were delivered with a real gravity that has been lacking up till now"
"Titan",2013-04-03,"it was an excellent change especially for a tv audiencei have a feeling that if people get to hear jon being emo and whining about being a bastard one more time things would be thrown at the tv especially considering how clear the book and show made it that jon had a very cushy upbringing compared to most men at the wallyeah it would have been nice to hear mances story about being a bard and seeing him before at winterfell  but that has nothing to do with jons claimed reason that he wants to join the wildlings im not sure why people think one change causes the other we might still hear about mances exploits later"
"Set_Gecko",2013-04-03,"one thing that irked me during his explanation of his reasoning forjoining the wildlings jon says but when i told lord commander he already knew earlier he said that he went beyond the wall for seasoning with qhorin halfhand he encounters this craster during that seasoning and how do you imagine jon telling commander about what he saw sure theoretically jon could have gone with qhorin back to castle black from crasters keep which is a couple of days to tell this to commander but would qhorin suffer such a deviation during a seasoning i mean how plausible is that the bastard boy is lying through his teeth"

"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-03,"my point isnt the potential intentions of the white walkers but that jon has no idea what are mances intentionson what basis does he makes the decision that mance fights for the living what has mance done at this point to show that he fights for the living besides gathering an army to try and storm the very barrier meant to keep the ww at bayjon has no solid evidence to reach this kind of conclusion because he doesnt know mance beyond the fact that hes a turncloak whos heading south what circumstantial evidence does jon posses that shows he knows what fighting alongside the wildings means fighting for the livingand like i said earlier mance has absolutely no plans to fight dead men and white walkers not that jon knows this he is taking his battle against the men of the nw and not the ww themselvesthe point is that the nw is not what it claims to be in jons eyes and while he has no idea what mance is up to exactly he safely assumes he isnt sacrificing babies to their enemies and is protecting his people by heading south the only way to escape them is to break through the walljon is merely offering his allegiance to the side that he would prefer to fight for its a risk he takes but using the reasoning of being a bastard is actually more risky since mance knows the nw doesnt care about bastards or trueborns anymore than wildlings do he has to hate the nw to want to desert and sounds convincing and i think his point about how his lc is sort of shady in his principles accomplishes that"
"Stark in Winterfell",2013-04-03,"the showrunners did the best they could with jons reasoning for joining mance in the books we are privy to so much more information than they have time to reveal in the 10 hours of a season they obviously want to impart the cataclysmic danger of an otherled invasion of westeros so must tweek some of the story to let nonreaders know the gravity of the situation thus jons disgust at the nws allowing craster to continue with his fell deeds becoming his reason rather than his bastardry if the nw doesnt stop craster from empowering the white walkers with the supple flesh of infants then they are somewhat complicit there simply wasnt enough time for mance to regale jon with the tale of his time in winterfell nor to remind us of jons anger at not being a part of the family during the feast in one of the first episodes sure it could have been handled better but there is a whole lot of tale theyre trying to condense into ten easily understood hours id say most of the viewing public has neither the wit nor the desire to understand the complexities of asoiaf so as thoreu said they must simplify simplify simplify"
"Tyrion4President",2013-04-04,"i thought this was a better reason than the one in the book the book reason was pretty weak and i dont really see the importance of the mance winterfell back story that much i care more than the personality of mance seems to be completely different from the one in the booksthe book version is supposed to be weak mance is not supposed to fully trust that answer and that is why he keeps telling jon that he needs to do the sideways monster mash with ygritte that will solidify him foresaking his vows"

"Eponine",2013-04-04,"the best thing about the show is jon finally shutting up about being a bastard seriously though in the show its clear that the writers have decided its a priority to keep the threat of the others in the viewers memories and they already made past changes toward that goal honestly when i read the books long periods of time passed where i virtually forgot the others or at least they were much less interesting to me than the stuff happening in kings landing bringing it up again as a plot point makes more sense than trying to stuff all the pov whinging into a long conversation"

"BrojenReed",2013-04-02,"i was super confused and a little annoyed at the hh scene after i first watched the premiere but after a couple more viewings i agree with what many of you are saying the scene was done this way to simplify the hh storyline and to conveniently place roose and qyburn in the same place i think the main reason that robb had to be in the scene is that many viewers who havent read the books often confuse characters spoiler i have many friends who are big fans of the series but havent read the books so they dont yet understand just how critical a character roose bolton is the writers havent even had his name spoken enough times to make it memorable so i think having robb and catelyn present was one last reminder of who roose is his current allegiance and his importance as one of robbs main generals this will add to the impact of the rw for those who have not read the books"
"Tadco26",2013-04-02,"when i watched it initially i thought i missed another battle fast forward like the fist of first men to explain what happened there i would have expected the dead men to be restrained if they were just slaughtered prisoners and you wouldnt expect qyburn to have any chance of living if he was excecuted as a prisoner vs just being a survivor in a battle where the enemy might not check every body that was down at the very least it was poorly explained perhaps qyburn will explain more in the future"

"stunningsteve",2013-04-02,"i didnt like the arrival at harrenhal last time we saw robb somewhere in westerlands near the crag maybe his camp still was at oxcross and suddenly he marched through most part of the riverlands to harrenhal and ignored riverrun the second time first time after whispering wood which was even worse we do know that he will be at riverrun rather soon for hosters funeral it would have made more sense for him arriving at rr in this episode and sending bolton with a part of his army to harrenhal with them arriving in the beginning of e3 clegane leaving harrenhal made more sense his scouts or spies informed about robb marching to harrenhal we dont know how many men tywin left him but harrenhal is huge and more ruin than castle it cant be defended against such a force like robbs he know he had to leave to survive and the prisoners probably from the green fork and his raids in the riverlands like the mallister knight would have slowed him down so he ordered to kill them and arranged them as welcoming present for robb if qyburn was just lucky to survive or was left alive intentional as a spy or contact person between roose and tywin is hard to say right now we dont know how long exactly roose has been aligned with the lannisters and what nackground story they will give qyburn in the series edited by stunningsteve 02 april 2013  0244 pm"

"jonny__bravo",2013-04-02,"i agree with mulled vino you can see the logic for the scene and placing roose at hh but its the whirlwind tour of the westerriverlands by robb with his entire host thats problematic here before tywin decides to march to the aid of the capital ser kevan points out that robbs host remained north of ashemark which tallys with robb and talisa going to the crag to accept their surrender now if robb and roose know its the mountain and only a small garrsion that were left defending hh then it stands to reason they know tywin has left hh whether they know about stannis defeat remains uncertain now if we specuate that robb upon hearing of hosters death heads to riverrun much to karstarks annoyance from there judging by the trailers take his home take his gold plans an attack on casterly rock you have to wonder why he didnt pursue such an attack when he was near ashemark initially edited by jonnybravo 02 april 2013  0251 pm"

"King Tommen",2013-04-02,"the show doesnt really care a whole lot about the logistics of the geography and the way the characters move around it the way the books do so i dont know why some here continue to harp on it for the convenience of the plot some characters will be able to move to different locations quicker than others and since you dont see their journey you can either manufacture some reason as to how that happened on horseback travelled through the night took a shortcut off the main road etc or you can use your suspension of disbelief to just accept that this is the way it is its really not something that should alter your enjoyment of the show to any real degree"

"King Tommen",2013-04-02,"if you watch the scene again you can see that pretty much every dead person scattered in harrenhal has their hands bound together andor have been strung up and piled up on wooden restraints its pretty obvious as for qyburn being alive hes been bloodied and worked over and appears to be dead until he weakly awakens and coughs talisa goes to treat him and after looking at his wounds says hes lucky to be alive which he can barely respond to i dont see how thats too hard to believe that in their haste to slaughter everyone they may not have went and checked everyones pulse afterwards to make sure they were completely dead heres the dialogue from when robb approaches harrenhal roose we should set the siege lines a 1000 yards from harrenhal they even say its harrenhal not winterfell for all the people who couldnt tell by just looking at it robb there wont be a siege the mountain cant defend a ruin roose i imagine the mountain will defend whatever tywin lannister tells him to defend robb the lannisters have been running from us since oxcross the men would love a fight sees the hanging bodies above the walls i dont think were going to get one robb walks into harrnehal immediately comes across a soldier hanging by a noose bled out on the ground he looks around the courtyard and sees bodies of dead men and women piled on top of carts and bound to wooden restraints some of them have spears stuck in their backs or through their bodies most of them have their hands bound together with rope roose and karstark walk in to survey the damage karstark 200 northmen slaughtered like sheep pretty good indication of a slaughter not a battle if it wasnt made distinctly clear enough by the visuals roose the debt will be repaid my friend for them and for your sons karstark they rot in the ground while their killer runs free looks over at catelyn as she enters the scene to look at the bodies roose the kingslayer wont remain free for long my best hunter is after him obvious reference to locke robb and cat approach a dead man bound up with a knife through a sigil on his chest while talisa checks on some of the other bodies robb a mallister cat ser jeremy my fathers bannerman karstark has had enough and storms out roose sticks around long enough to give the evil eye and then leaves too robb looks up to see the faces of some of his soldiers who are staring intently at cat he gathers himself and puts on his im in charge voice robb find her a chamber that will serve as a cell catelyn leaves with one of the men talisa approaches robb talisa quietly shes your mother robb she freed jaime lannister the lannisters robbed them of their sons she robbed them of their justice the man bound up beside ser jeremy suddenly coughs and talisa and robb rush over to check on himtalisa looks at the huge gash on the mans neck talisa this wound needs to be cleaned and closed robb gives him some water to drink robb whats your name friend man qyburn talisa youre lucky to be alive qyburn looks around at all the carnage raises his eyebrow and grins weakly lucky"

"Khal Pono",2013-04-03,"i wonder if theyll make qyburn as horrible as he is in the books i certainly hope so cos hes the creepiest guy in the series imoagreed i love the way how grrm goes out of his way to describe some of the most terrifyingly evil minor characters the tickler qyburn roose bolton as having an utterly unremarkable ordinary appearance book qyburn even looks kindlyfatherly and completely nonthreatening whenever i picutre him while reading the books i picture my own dad a pudgy harmless teddy bear of a guy curious to see what this actor will do with this very chilling role"

"Patchface123",2013-04-04,"i was watching the episode with a friend who hasnt read the books and this scene made him ask me what happened here i didnt really have a good answer since the whole storyline differs so much from the books in the show you never get feeling that the northern army is split up in s01e09 robb sends a splinter force on a suicide mission but otherwise the whole army seems to stay with him during aryas stay at harrenhal there are prisoners sure but they seem to be local farmers rather than northern soldiers i think it was necessary to change this storyline from the books but i feel it couldve been done better anyways things seems to be getting back on track with roose in harrenhal and robb and cat on their way to riverrun i guess"
"Tommen",2013-04-04,"yeah the show really needs to clarify its version of events regarding harrenhal"

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-01,"bronnvardis was great but i also felt that the shots during robb and the wildlings was a little bit off ditto with danys assassination attempt but apart from that i felt that pretty much every other scene was just fine its just the fast cuts during his action sequences that bother me a little they dont really gel well with the shows overall filming style compare robb and the wildlings to any of the fighting sequences in blackwater the latter feels more at home with the shows camerawork offtopic but imo the best action sequence director the show has used is neil marshall they should just get him to direct any battles from now on and judging by her work in breaking bad i think michelle maclaren will be able to pull of action scenes really well i cant wait to see how the bear pit scene is directed hell based on her work in bb i wouldnt be surprised if michelle maclaren uses pov shots during sex scenes biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd "

"Thendel",2013-04-04,"i hope not tyrion learning the truth about tysha is instrumental to how his story arc develops and itd be butchery to his character to leave that out and from ive seen so far tyrion is being depicted as becoming increasingly bitter and disillusioned which ties in very neatly with his story arc in storm for those reasons im fairly certain that tyrion will off shae himself"
"scurvy",2013-04-04,"i think it was an interesting reverse foreshadowing tyrion essentially hangs shae with the chain in tywins bed given the video evidence that talisa may be a lannister spy and tywin placing her in robbs bed twyin placing shae in tyrions bed to bring him information while tyrion was in kl makes a lot of sense both from the text and from the shows perspective"
"Logodnica",2013-04-04,"i hope youre right it truly would be butchery to spoiler remove the tysha storyline from tyron but the show is already cutting out a lot and the actor who plays tywin has said over and over again that the shows tywin is a very different character than the books tywin how different are we going here i think well know for sure at spoiler tyrons wedding episode if he tells sansa that during his first wedding they collapsed giggling into the bed then well know that the tysha stoyline is being included if that doesnt happen then theres no point in pretending any longer that the show will follow the books"

"gibbles545",2013-04-04,"i dont think they are going to do that otherwise i cant really see why they would have mentioned tysha in the first season and then have bronn say i would have killed the man that did that to me"
"Logodnica",2013-04-04,"good points about mentioning her in season 1 that makes me feel better"
"rodrik Cassel",2013-04-04,"yeah but they showed ser dontos too"
"rystine",2013-04-04,"tyrion and tyshas story was definitely part of season 1 in fact if i recall correctly when peter dinklage won the emmy that was the episode that was submitted for his nomination so its not too far fetched to think that he won for that scene in particular i know alot of people are worried that tyrion and shae are getting a little too involved spoiler to make her betrayal of him and his murder of her believable but heres some perspective on tyrion and shaes story in the show so far tyrion murdering shae and tywin will probably happen near the end of season 4 around the 40th overall episode of the series as of right now there have only been 21 episodes only 13 of which shae has been in this means that there are probably another 18 or 19 episodes to go before tyrion murders her plenty of time for their story to flesh out and get to the point where they can betray each other seriously there is no need to worry about that yet somewhat ot apologies if i ever come across as short tempered in this or other threads like this but one of my biggest pet peeves regarding the show is when people start complaining about changes being made from the books when we dont have any idea if they are going to make those changes in the first place for example last season when the reeds and reek werent part of the story in winterfell i remember there being a ton of people complaining that meera jojen and ramsay had been completely eliminated from the show and now this season lo and behold we have all of them"
"Set_Gecko",2013-04-04,"remember that tysha is introduced to us and we are made care for her mainly through jyrions dialogues in his head with himself if tyrion kills tywin for tysha  which the audience has almost no familiriaty with  everybody will be like what that tension with tyrion constantly reminiscing her in his head is building up in the book only  it is really hard to do it in the series so yeah i think that they will hang shae and thats why tyrion kills tywyin good observation"
"Set_Gecko",2013-04-04,"yeah yeah tysha was mentioned in season 1 but seriously who remembers it now tysha will get a passing mention to bring the little cute pay off on bronns line i would kill the man who did that to me but it will not be the main reason it just wont work for tv audince who do not have access to the thoughts of the characters just imagine yourself not having read the books and you see something so important and drastic as tyrion killing his own father who so happens to be another major character with respectable screen time imagine this be explained by some conversation in season 1 which you forgot as soon as you heard it because it didnt mean anything to you and which was never mentioned again that simply will not work"

"Ramsay Gimp",2013-04-04,"he used that line in the book as well"
"rystine",2013-04-04,"true it was mentioned already but i agree with setgecko tysha was made important to readers in a way that has not happened on the showbut tysha has been made important in the show as i said its the fault of the viewer if they are not able to pick that up and there is still the scene where jaime releases tyrion from the dungeons to refresh that story to people minutes before he confronts shae and tywin it will most likely be many things that lead tyrion to do the dirty deed tysha his fathers blatant refusal to give him casterly rock viewers will remember that scene why will viewers remember the scene where tywin refuses to give tyrion casterly rock but they wont remember the scene that tyrion tells the story of tysha in any case tyrion wont need any more motivation to kill his father theres already plenty and showing shae betray tyrion at his trial and finding her in tywins bed will be all the motivation he needs to kill her as well that was all the motivation he had in the books after all the show has definitely whitewashed tyrion but some things have to happen for his development to continue as it has in the books so i believe it will play out like this to make matters worse shae is being made into more of a loverfriend so her murder will be just the right motive and justification for tyrions actionsno doubt the show has whitewashed tyrion and the tyrion of right now wouldnt kill shae but as i said before there are still almost 2 full seasons of material to show tyrion and shaes relationship becoming more fleshed out do people not believe that the characters can develop beyond where they are right now"
"Conchobar",2013-04-04,"i hope not as well that would suck"
"DragonAge93",2013-04-04,"well also shae did say dont trust anybody life is safer that way i took that as a sign she doesnt trust tyrion and has some secret agenda of her own and we dont really know why shae was in tywins bed in the book maybe she was forced to betray him and to stay alive decided to sleep with tywin maybe in the book she was telling the truth before tyrion killed her i dont think theyd change tyrion killing shae its a big moment for his character as is his subsequent killing of tywin as well i think the next whore i find ill hang was a bit of irony in that tywin will be in bed with her himself which will come as a shock to viewers since tywin has constantly hated whores and yet is now in bed with one"
"Queen of Whores",2013-04-05,"if tyrion doesnt kill shae ill probably stop watching the show however grudgingly along with killing tywin and his failed marriage to tysha its probably one of his most important and lifechanging decisions"
"Woman of War",2013-04-05,"but the showmakers had altered the tysha story in one important aspect at that episode from s1 as far as i remember tyrion did not tell that he went last with tysha  or am i wrong this is an understandable change since they have aged up all characters and tyrion was as far as i remember sixteen in the series when he married tysha so he was not the child anymore that was sexually abused by his father who forced him into unwanted sexual activity of the most violent kind someone who has to bear his part of guilt but is a victim of sexual assault first of all tyrion at sixteen could have been expected to show more courage and standing against his father than thirteen year old little tyrion so making him go last with tysha would have painted tyrion far darker than in the books since a sixteen year old is no child anymore and would bear far more guilt for his part in the rape of tysha this also would not contrast his behaviour with tysha so clearly to not raping sansa at his fathers command as martin had intended in the books but if tysha as important motivation should disappear from tyrions storyline we can as well stop all speculation that tyrion will ever meet tysha be endangered by the presentation of a faketysha or anyone will find tysha in order to annull whatever marriage since i do not think that dd will alter the storys ending for the important protagonists that martin has given to them a character that disappears from the story cant have any implications on the final outcome edited by woman of war 05 april 2013  0715 am"
"Mr Smith",2013-04-05,"ill be severely disappointed if tywin were to kill shae rather than tyrion that whole sequence where he goes into his fathers bed chamber kills shae then moves on to his father is probably the single most important sequence for tyrions development as a character its also possibly my favourite moment from asos and it would be absolutely criminal to change it"

son tyrion has all the lannister traits except he is a dwarf but he is a blonde dwarf and has the ingelligent political mind of tywini cant help but feel a little depressed when i read crazy theories like this i mean come on the books are amazing and parts of that is because they have a few great mysteries and revealations in them but that doesnt mean that you have to go out of your way to create a mystery theory where there its not neededill name 3 reasons that debunks this tyrion is a targaryen theory completley and then lets never bring it up again shall we1 as we all know aerys ii was paranoid and after the defiance of duskendale he became a recluse that never ever left the red keep except for when he attended the tournament of harrenhall because he thought it was a meeting event for a group of houses that where planning to conspire against him the lannisters where not therejoanna lived in casterly rock raising jamie and cerscei when and how was this ja rape supposed to take place did the king who never ever left the red keep because of his paranoia suddenly take a host of his kingsguard with him and rode to casterly rock to rape joanna without anyoneone stopping him from just entering casterly rock and making his way to joannas bedroomlets pretend this actually happened and you have to be pretty delusional to actually belive that the part above did are you telling me that no one noticed or informed anyone about this none of the hundreds of guards in casterly rock or the hundreds of servants or joanna herself told anyone that the mad king had raped joanna and gotten her pregnant or just that he had been seen near lannisport and casterly rock if tyrion was aerys son tywin would have the proof he was talking about in this episode2 women in westeros can do abortions remember that time when baelish got lysa tully pregnant and her father gave her moon tea to abort the pregnancy joanna could have done that if she was raped by the mad king and got pregnant3 who is gonna reveal this to the readerstyrion the entire theory banks on the ridicolous concept that this somehow happened in secret and not even joanna told anyone about it and if someone knew about it we would already know this too since it would be such a major thing that most likely would have caused a rebellion sparked by the lannisters this is not one of those scenarios where that one guy who knew that it happened comes out of the closet 30 years later and approaches tyrion and tells him that by the way youre half targaryen since aerys raped your motherso lets summarize this if tyrion is indeed halftargaryen that would mean that the king who was famous for only leaving his keep at one occasion after the defiance of duskendale actually did leave it one more time people just forget to mention that for some mysterious reason right to go to casterly rock where he managed to sneak into joannas bedroom without being noticed by anyone whatsoever then proceeded to rape her and get her pregnant joanna would then neither tell tywin or anyone else that she was raped by the mad king and she would actually decide to keep the mad kings baby when she has the option of abortion again without telling anybody and instead pass it off as tywins child and die giving birth and somehow despite the fact that no one knows about all this the readers and tyrion are going to find out about it in the books from whoseriously guys thisdoesnotadduppnever said that there wasnt plenty of valid reasons to not consider the theory as potentially true or even sensical as you seem to find it not but i will suggest that youre filling in many of the gaps with a confirmation bias of youre own as far as i know the timeline on the possible impregnation of joanna and her whereabouts at the time is ambiguous clearly tywin was in kl serving as hand around the time joanna conceived tyrion so its not unreasonable to think she may have been in kl as well at that time for tywin to even knock her up in other words we dont have to assume that impregnating joanna for either tywin or aerys involved making a trip to casterly rock though of course you are right that its silly to think aerys would have made such a trip where as for tywin it would be normal we also though do not have to assume that aerys putting a baby into joanna involved violently raping her for all of the westerlands to hear there is no reason to assume that other than to try to make the theory sound more implausible than it really is the same goes for your point about the abortions moon tea has no guarantee of success mind you also whos to say she would have rushed to abort maybe she wanted to keep the baby and hide the truth from tywin why who can say maybe she though the baby was tywinsoverall im not overly interested in defending the merits or lack there of for a theory i myself am not sold on in the way i say am of rlj or other more strongly evidentially supported theories i actually mostly dont think its true just that it may be interesting if it was i just was interested in provoking a discussion about it i wont have it be said that there is something wrong with that clearly its working"

"Darryk",2013-04-04,"yeah as someone who feels book fanatics are way too harsh on the show sometimes even i was extremely disappointed with mances introduction im a big fan of ciarin hinds but im not sure why they decided to leave out all the bard stuff it has so much more impact when the guy playing a harp or whatever in the corner of the room stands up and introduces himself as mance rayder plus the meeting between them has so much more substance to it in the book whereas in the series it was about four lines of dialogue maybe theyre gonna spread all that stuff out over the season more but it seems like their meeting wasnt the event it could have been"

"Arrogant Bastard",2013-04-01,"really liked this premiere a bit slower but necessary in order to properly set the stage for season 3 and remind the audience of whats going on it was certainly miles better than the second two finale which i thought was for the most part dreadful in fact there wasnt a scene i disliked in the whole episode not even ros that most reviewers believe the season gets stronger with each episode is encouraging best scenes tywintyrion absolutely nailed this scene which might have had more impact than in the book just because of dinklages great reactions to tywins bile both of them were fantastic and david and dan kept all the best lines from this exchange in the bookonly mummers require applause is a favorite of mine cant wait to see more of their exchanges as the season progresses davossalladhor liked seeing salladhor again and while i vaguely remember the two meeting in asos i believe most of their interaction here was invented still great dialog and performances especially liam cunningham dany wow her scenes in this episode are so much better than that whole mess of a qarth story last season i didnt really mind the barristan reveal coming early as in the tv medium this would have been difficult especially since he wasnt used at all last season probably should have been but thats another story i miss strong belwas but with the cast of this show he was certainly an expendable character margeary in kl really like dormer as margaery even though shes a bit different than the book version i thought her exchanges with cersei at dinner were very well played and i look forward to the queen of thorns making an appearance everything else i thought was well handled if not as good as the above jon snow was one of my least favorite arcs last season but i enjoyed his meeting with mance even if i much prefer hte book version im not particularly impressed with kit harrington as snow hes just pretty bland and shows little emotion but i liked tormund i also love ciaran hinds even if this take on mance is different i still think hinds would have been the perfect roose bolton not sure where theyre going with stannis i dont believe he meets davos until somewhat the middle of asos so theyre taking a different direction here but it could work stannis is never charismatic in the books but hes one of my favorite characters and i hope the show manages to get across his pov more as the season develops i really started to like him when he made davos his hand in asos which the show has already revealed last season unfortunately looking forward to next week and arya bran jaime and possibly theoninterested to see what theyre doing with him this season"
"irishking44",2013-04-01,"also to copy and paste why is there two separate threads  ive never got that everyone discusses it in rate the episode anywaybetter than i expected considering the pessimism on here but then the reviews have been so positive810 which is what i wanted for an opening episode tywin  tyrion is one of my fave chapters in the book and they nailed it thats like two points in itself i digged the davos stuff as well that was more or less straight from the book tarly stuff was good jon snow joining wildlings worked quite nicely arstans joining dany was a bit rushed but okay some good foreshadowing with roose bolton and co that i liked as wellstuff that was added  margaerys stuff worked and they played her off against cersei nice and early which i was glad to see somewhat predictably the only part i really objected to was shae  ros hopefully they dont crop up too much again it seemed like they were building some sort of storyline there too  i guess well just have to accept that one for what it is id have preferred some dontos but whatevergood episode found it quite cinematic at points  dragon scene white walkers armies marching etc it was cool i can see how theyve improved visually  i found season two claustrophobic at points and theyve improved upon that in this episodeyes i just hope they keep the later convo between tyrion and tywini wont have my grandson be a robert the 2ndnot robert the 2nd aerys the 3rd"
"Montey14",2013-04-01,"i dont mind the idea of robb making it to harrenhal but i wonder how theyre going to explain that arya who was heading north and robbs huge army which was heading south were unable to cross paths unless in the show arya was heading somewhere else but i dont remember her doing so and i dont see why she wouldnt head north thats my only real complaint but since arya wasnt shown at all maybe well get an explanationalthough a bit slow i thought it was a good setup episode and i was wondering how they would fit ser barristan in since dany was buying her own ship instead of taking one sent by illyrio i thought it worked well i wish we couldve gotten more of the dialogue with kraznys that was in the book especially when he was talking about showing her around astapor for the night but i guess it wouldve gotten old i do wish theyd managed to mention that dany understood everything kraznys was sayingand i agree with the above poster about davoss makeup it was awesomeif i remember correctly when arya leaves harrenhalthey seem to get lost and go in circles being that they dont know how to read the map to rivverunbut they somehow have to get roose bolton to harrenhal so i guess rob marching there is the only way peter dinklage and charles dance just rocked that scenethat was fantastic"

"Arrogant Bastard",2013-04-01,"you know what i just realized was conspicuously missing from the episode the book prologue which establishes there is dissent within the ranks of the nights watch and a plot to overthrow lc mormont possible they are dropping that plot line entirelyhighly doubtful they are dropping this plot line i think its just something that doesnt really require its own scene things are clearly going bad for the nw and when the mutiny occurs i dont think new viewers will see it as coming out of nowherejust to add as soon as that maester was revealed to be alive at harrenhal i thought it would be qyburn so theyre at least keeping one of the brave companion members the same wonder if theyll also reintroduce rorge and biter i would think so or else what would be the point of casting those two last season as they didnt do weasel soup"

"Rockroi",2013-04-01,"so after waiting 42 weeks we get back some of our good olâ<U+0080><U+0099> got groove back overall solid smart fun and best of all fast this episode gave us a lot of good plot points without rushing and covered a lot of ground what i likedwhen we last left our hero jon snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>s introduction to the caesar king beyond the wall was great we got a lot out of a bunch of different characters with a ton of information all locked into a 710 minute scene great work we met mance we met giantsbane we see that ygritte is still great and we see that jon has a little bit of quick thinking to him i thought the decision to â<U+0080><U+009C>pick up right where we left offâ<U+0080><U+009D> was terrific we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need nor have the time for an entire episode dedicated to the regurgitating everything we just saw if we did we would just reread fest for crows astapor light years ahead of quarth i am a bit amazed with how bleeping fast danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story line jumps yes she is only in her second chapter but thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s saying something danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s second chapter happens over 25 of the way through sos so danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story is well on its way she is already at the unsullied she is already chatting with the slavers she is already hatching a plan and its her second scene then she runs into artisan whitebeardâ<U+0080> only the story doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have time nor the advantage that the books did so they just jump him right up â<U+0080><U+0093> its barristanb selmy while the book version was stunning and the reader got to actually enjoy being tricked the show does not have that luxury so it just has to happen thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a whole bookâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worth of time savings right there while the qarth scenes were not just laborious meandering and ultimately â<U+0080><U+009C>emptyâ<U+0080><U+009D> snark the astapor timetable is much more as if a drill seagent is yelling â<U+0080><U+009C>people listen up we got places to go move itâ<U+0080><U+009D> and they kept the nipple scene in still grosses me out nice touch i loved how the first scene with jon mirrored really well the last scene with dany ice and fire indeed how jon was getting pelted with dung by little kids but was never in any real danger while dany was playing gleefully with a pretty little â<U+0080> warlockâ<U+0080> and was in mortal danger â<U+0080><U+009C>i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t escape the ratings would hit the crapperâ<U+0080><U+009D> i watched the episode with a group of friends and we rewatched blackwater and the last episode of season 2 which includes the scene where shae makes tyrion the offer f running away together and we all made different version of the same joke â<U+0080><U+009C>i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t leave because iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m the most popular character on the showâ<U+0080><U+009D> and in this episode tyrion continued the hits with two great scenes with cersei and tywin the writing for tyrion is great not only when he is lobbing zingers at cresei but when he has to run away from his father thats a lot of range and depth there in both the character and the actor salador saan comic genius i just want to have a few people in every episode who i just like to hear talk tywin lannister dolorous ed and now salador saan who is hilarious i think the return to humor especially in the stannisdavos storyline which is so in need of some people who are not so dour â<U+0080><U+0093>is very welcomeerosion of a king small subtle but right there in the open roose bolton talking to rikard karstark about the progress of the war and about rob stark and just like that we hear the first whisper of treason what i am on the fence abouti have no idea what happened at harrenhal we see robb outside harrenhal looking to fight a seige only he waltzes right in and sees a slaughter so what happened not much explination my take is that the mountain executed a whole bunch of northerners who were probably taken prisoner after the battle of the green ford but it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make that much sense why were they all just dead where was the mountain did they just lined everyone up outside the courtyard to start killing people how come we didnt get his people before how come theres never been any discussion about prisoners at harrenhal now mind you i didnt dislike this scene i thought it provided good bedrock of reminding us where robb is at least trying to do it also provides us a good look into the minds of some of his subordinates but overall i just found a whole scene onfusing and really untethered to the overall storytywin lannister unimproved upon although its a line for line regurgitation from the books i have always found tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s excuse for not giving tyrion casterly rock to be incredibly shallow empty and really outside the norm of this character i was half hoping that the writers would improve upon this from the books but they stayed true to the books methodology therefore i do not dislike what they did i guess i just didnt like it anymore than i absolutely had tothe continued missed opportunities of sansa stark in sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the scene in the show we find her describing what she thinks certain ships are doing in the bay in the beginning i thought it was because sansa added information that she had picked up on that gave her special insight into each one of these ships and their captains and a better understanding of westeros commerce unfortunately however she is playing stupid game again i dont mind it very much but i would much rather had santa actually advancing in the game of thrones than having another relatively empty scenewhat i did not likeroz and shae oh thank god they just put the two worst characters in the series in the same place to get all my hatred out of the way in one scene in some ways i thought that was really good efficiency on the other hand why is this even here i think the writers were sending us a little message â<U+0080><U+009C>we know you hate these two characters and they are not going anywhereâ<U+0080><U+009D> good for them and good for me because i know where to hit the advanced button on my tivo now when i rewatch the episode though this does lead to kind of an interesting question that we bantered about while watching the show does show shae actually love tyrion is she that much of a departure from the book that she is actually fallen for this man and its actually not an act if thats the case i may have to reevaluate how i feel about this character and i do not dislike roz nearly as much as other people i just find her constant inclusion to be borderline hilarious the continued misunderstanding of the word unquestionably this one take some explanation during last season one of the producers made the comment that renly would â<U+0080><U+009C>unquestionablyâ<U+0080><U+009D> be a better king than stannis â<U+0080><U+009C> even after watching the show and obviously reading the books and seeing how weak unproven terrified and plyable renly is all i can think of is that eitherthe producers do not understand who renly isthe producers do not understand who stannis is orthe producers do not understand what the word â<U+0080><U+009C>unquestionablyâ<U+0080><U+009D> meansand this was delivered in the really stilted davosstannis reunion scene i found this stannisdavos scene to be painfully bad in the book stannis is almost giddy that davos is alive he even invites him to work on some strategy you actually get a hint of warmth from the king also davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> activities make a lot more sense in the book he gets thrown in jail and then he meets the king not the other way around which just seems longwinded here here there is absolutely no emotional resonance from stannis hes almost a cardboard cutout there is no sense of caring or intimacy from the king to his hand this by the way contradicts what they show to say nothing of the books says about their relationship namely the king really does care about davos why isnt showstannis at least modestly happy to see him and why is he so lifelessand all i could think of is that the producers continually misunderstand who this character is and what hes trying to do that instead of a flushed out and humane character they have interposed a robot virtually without feeling and without selfinspection and they add to this problem the idea that stannis is being either manipulated or outright control by mel in other words they want stannis to be the guy who doesnt understand or care about what hes doing a faustian caricature of what was in the books anyway a layered and nuanced characterthis is hard for me stannis is one of my favorite characters in both the books and on the show this show mishandling of this character has me cringing now dont get me wrong i could be completely off base on this its possible that i misinterpreted whats going on in that scene and i will need more episodes to get a good handle on this relationship and on stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> character however i keep coming back to the fear that the producers just want to make stannis a type of villain instead of quite possibly a very jaded and complex â<U+0080><U+009C>heroâ<U+0080><U+009D> but like i said i could be wrongoverall this is a solid 75 out of 10 and im really happy with the pace setting"

"-Ghost-",2013-04-01,"so after waiting 42 weeks we get back some of our good olâ<U+0092> got groove back overall solid smart fun and best of all fast this episode gave us a lot of good plot points without rushing and covered a lot of ground what i likedwhen we last left our hero jon snowâ<U+0092>s introduction to the caesar king beyond the wall was great we got a lot out of a bunch of different characters with a ton of information all locked into a 710 minute scene great work we met mance we met giantsbane we see that ygritte is still great and we see that jon has a little bit of quick thinking to him i thought the decision to â<U+0093>pick up right where we left offâ<U+0094> was terrific we donâ<U+0092>t need nor have the time for an entire episode dedicated to the regurgitating everything we just saw if we did we would just reread fest for crows i have no idea what happened at harrenhal we see robb outside harrenhal looking to fight a seige only he waltzes right in and sees a slaughter so what happened not much explination my take is that the mountain executed a whole bunch of northerners who were probably taken prisoner after the battle of the green ford but it didnâ<U+0092>t make that much sense why were they all just dead where was the mountain did they just lined everyone up outside the courtyard to start killing people how come we didnt get his people before how come theres never been any discussion about prisoners at harrenhal now mind you i didnt dislike this scene i thought it provided good bedrock of reminding us where robb is at least trying to do it also provides us a good look into the minds of some of his subordinates but overall i just found a whole scene onfusing and really untethered to the overall storyi found this stannisdavos scene to be painfully bad in the book stannis is almost giddy that davos is alive he even invites him to work on some strategy you actually get a hint of warmth from the king also davosâ<U+0092> activities make a lot more sense in the book he gets thrown in jail and then he meets the king not the other way around which just seems longwinded here here there is absolutely no emotional resonance from stannis hes almost a cardboard cutout there is no sense of caring or intimacy from the king to his hand this by the way contradicts what they show to say nothing of the books says about their relationship namely the king really does care about davos why isnt showstannis at least modestly happy to see him and why is he so lifelessand all i could think of is that the producers continually misunderstand who this character is and what hes trying to do that instead of a flushed out and humane character they have interposed a robot virtually without feeling and without selfinspection and they add to this problem the idea that stannis is being either manipulated or outright control by mel in other words they want stannis to be the guy who doesnt understand or care about what hes doing a faustian caricature of what was in the books anyway a layered and nuanced characterthis is hard for me stannis is one of my favorite characters in both the books and on the show this show mishandling of this character has me cringing now dont get me wrong i could be completely off base on this its possible that i misinterpreted whats going on in that scene and i will need more episodes to get a good handle on this relationship and on stannisâ<U+0092> character however i keep coming back to the fear that the producers just want to make stannis a type of villain instead of quite possibly a very jaded and complex â<U+0093>heroâ<U+0094> but like i said i could be wrongoverall this is a solid 75 out of 10 and im really happy with the pace settinggood post i agree with most of what you saidi was really excited coming into this season about jon meeting mance the way they changed the stories that jon and mance tell eachother kind of ruined this for me mances story allowed the reader to get to know him and understand where hes coming from this made me instantly like mance the change takes that away i feel jons book story is also better i thinksame thing with harrenhal with meyou nailed it with stannis and davos i was watching like wtf theyre making him a dick to davos and mel makes him look like a little bitch couldnt have said it better edited by ghost 01 april 2013  0206 pm"

"Lyana",2013-04-02,"finally the wait is over and winter has come ive counted the days and now  its on i have some minor remarks but was sooooo tremendously happy the show is finally on that i have to watch it again to pay attention to all the small details which make this show so awesome but generally here are some random thoughts in order of appearance  ww  wights  sam  ghost   sooo last time the show left us with a shaking and scared sam tarly and a bunch of vicious white walkers and marching whights and just as i thought for the moment they will pull off the whole slayer scene  whoops  there comes ghost so that was a wtph moment definitely awkward i thought i saw ghost last time with jon and qhorin halfhand deep into the wildlings territory but i assume that ghost has decided to take the black and go back to the nights watch some weak moment without the proper set up  but i could let it go i guess i am also a bit confused about the whole handling of the battle situation i know its all about the budget issues not showing the actual battle but it is a bit strange how sam has managed to escape this awful situation he was caught into at the end of season two  jon  ygritte  tormund  mance  so here it is  the show starts immediately with the story development without losing any precious time ygritte was cool as always and the giant was impressive the tormundjon exchange was handled very well and the moment when jon went down on his knees i burst out laughing i was a bit disappointed about not being true to the book exactly in this scene  but i guess mance coundnt have seen jon at the feast in winterfell cause he was outside whole the time it would have been a nice touch but still confusing to the tv audience tho it was the most d and d could have done out of this situation so  kudos nice scene overall  bronn  podrick  at first i thought  aughhh unnecessary  but then as i saw it the second time i think it was handled nicely  show some typical hbo and introduce to us bronn and podrick in case we have forgotten about them and the bronn  meryn trant dialogue after that was spot on  the tyrion  cersei scene was not the finest but it shows the changed dynamic in their relationship the roles have switched and tyrion has to adapt himself to the new situation the following scene with bronn was  well tyrion and bronn  nothing could go wrong when they two are on screen together miss varys tho  davos  salladhor  the scene was a smooth introduction to the current stannis situation giving the viewers a bit of information about the exiled king and reminding them who actually stannis is and what is he doing after the black water battle the dialogue between davos and salladhor is very well written and its a nice scene overall  robb no kitn so   roose  catelyn  the new wife forgot her name  well i have to say i am surprised no one shouted king in the north this time as we saw king robb foreshadowing much i was actually really confused after this scene and as i read on the thread i see im not the only one the story was somehow too fastpaced imho i had to recall what happened at the previous season and the book to try to explain to myself what were all these corpses doing there and suddenly  the king decides mommy must go to prison as he sees all the dead bodies a bit unconvincing but  i could still buy it and of course we see the new hot wife for a little bit in case we have forgotten she exists the roos  karstark dialogue was a nice touch tho and introducing qyburn was a pleasant surprise bur overall  a weak start for the young wolf  here comes the highlight of the episode  the tywin  tyrion scene we see somehow the resemblance and the big difference between the two they detest and admire each other at the same time peter is one whole with his character and we see the whole bitterness literally glare through his body we finally get to see tywin as the ase he is for a moment i thought they are going to make us actually like tywin at season two and make him a decent person so generally charles dance and peter dinklage has done an outstanding job and delivered us the best performance in this episode  sansa  shae  littlefinger  ross  not the best scene ever i would say but we are reminded about the littlefinger  sansa plot the shae  ross dialogue was a bit annoying but i didnt mind it after all im also wandering if petyr has recognized arya at harrenhal and is playin his little games now still waiting for sansa to become a player  aaaand here comes the queen bow down bits the scenes in astapor were surprisingly well handled after the season two quarth fiasco i liked all of it  dragons ser jorahs puppy look the whole bargaining dialogue we could tell she understood what they were talking about yeah and of course the early but i would say necessary revealing of ser barristan everything well written and straight to the point  kudos  stannis definitely not the mannis  mel davos  i try really really hard to convince my boyfriend a nonbook reader that stannis is a cool guy i have almost succeeded at the blackwater episode  but the tv script somehow manages to throw my whole attempts out of the window obviously the tv stannis although better looking somehow is some puppet in mels hands who didnt care about his close friend who has named the hand of the king i sincerely hope we have same better character development as the show goes on  joffrey  margaery did i read a kate middleton comparison somewhere  cersei  i loved it how joffrey is attempting to behave himself more mannish because of margaery one could tell he likes her but make no mistake  she is definitely not sansa and joff and cersei kow that very well the whole charity thing was very well handled politically it is obvious this one is aiming for the big game watch out cersei  new qeen in da house smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  overall it was a godt episode with nice set up and good writing but the visual part could have definitely been more impressive compared to the pilot episode from the previous season this one did not have many visual eyecandies but still very excited cant wait for the next one smilepng

"HouseLark",2013-04-02,"i thought that this was a better opening episode than we got for series two we spent a bit longer with each character but managed to cover quite a lot of ground with a series that has such a large cast and so many different locations these opening episodes that reestablish the narrative will always be imperfect but i thought this season they did as well as possible with it plus we got some exceptional scenes between tyrion and tywin and dany and kraznys its worth noting here that both of those scenes were almost taken verbatim from the book i also loved stannis scene dillane absolutely nailed that haunted look you could see the steel of the old stannis but hes just suffered a grievous loss in his bid for the throne and hes suffering from that he even looked older and greyera few things fell flat for methe first was starks men turning up at harrenhall this was a bit confusing since we had no idea that either northmen were being held there or that the mountains men had leftsecond with every episode i dislike sibil kekkilis performance more and more shes a good actress but in thrones she always sounds as thought shes reading from a cue cardthird and most important littlefingers behaviour is becoming inexplicable he would never have operated in the open as he did here i really dont understand why the writers didnt go down the road of a n other helping sansa escape kings landing with a big reveal later on that littlefinger was behind it all it did not need to be ser dontos it could even have been ros residual loyalty to her former lord pity for an abused young girl etc this littlefinger would have been caught out by varys ten times over by nowfourth i hated margaerys princess dianakate middleton routine i get that it established her as a friend of the commons but it would have been more effective to stick to the book and have tyrell menwomen handing out food to all rather than giving toys to orphans food would win over a starving people not wooden knights generally i like natalie dormers margaery but the orphanage scene just reeked of a contemporary tabloid news storyit was still a great episode and i loved the little touches such as drogon roasting a fish in midair and im generally happy that dany is finally doing something in a similar vein jon seems to be back on track thinking on his feet and proving himself to be smart rather than bumbling around like a moron ciaran hinds should also dismiss any doubts about his casting as mance he might be older than many would have liked but hinds is ridiculously talented and i cant wait to see more of his scenes and then we have diana rigg incoming as well i pray to sweet rhllor that she gets a scene with charles dance"
"Azor Ahoy!",2013-04-02,"its a bit of a mehtyrions parts were overly talky with cersei and bronn although i liked the tywin conversation jons faked motivation for joining the wildlings is also dubious doesnt the nights watch fight for the living i am the shield that guards the realms of men although he was in a tight spot so maybe that can be excuseddanys scenes were good though and i was relieved they skipped the arstan crap although i do miss strong belwasdavoss scenes were fair as wellwas relieved arya didnt appear at all i skipped all her chapters in the books until she joins the fm edited by thelastvalyrian 02 april 2013  0540 am"

"Loras",2013-04-02,"wasnt that the entire point of him going into detail on his disappointment in mormonts reaction to casters feeding his sons to walkers that the watch is not who theyre claiming to bethat was the impression i got from that scene too it was nice to see that one of the big departures from the books came back into the story it really gives me faith in dds adaptation"
"DrRobotnik",2013-04-02,"i have a bad feeling about the dany arc theyre moving way too fast if they end with yunkai thats a whole season dedicated to the siege of meereen or alternatively theyd be cutting into dwd material and jeopardize the future of the series dwd contains a lot of dany chapters but probably not enough to last three seasons and still keep the viewer base"

"Myrish Swamp Thing",2013-04-02,"surely youve discussed a lot already one little thing i liked was the chat between ros and shae it comes across that the northern loyalty to the starks extends to the smallfolk"
"The Mountain That Posts",2013-04-02,"was relieved arya didnt appear at all i skipped all her chapters in the books until she joins the fmwuti know this is off topic but why her chapters were amazing until she joined the fm and then her chapters got bad haha"
"Sansa in the North",2013-04-02,"wuti know this is off topic but why her chapters were amazing until she joined the fm and then her chapters got bad hahawordi truly enjoyed the episode apart from the cold open my favourite parts were the dinner scene and the tyriontywin scene the harrenhal scene was kind of confusing okay very confusing but i loved the little conversation between roose and karstark im sure youve discussed a lot already i havent got the time to go through all 21 pages of it so im just gonna leave it at that i dont want to drag up things that were discussed to death pages ago 810 overall much better than season 2 premier"
"ebevan91",2013-04-02,"did anyone else find the volume of some characters quite low in the beginning i had to turn the volume way up because i couldnt understand what the people in mances tent were saying as well as the stuff in kings landing then later on the scene right before danys dragons was kinda quiet as well and then the dragons were so damn loud it scared the daylights out of me edited by ebevan91 02 april 2013  0903 am"
"Janicia",2013-04-02,"im glad theyre dropping the ser dontos ploy he was annoying in the books and even though he seemed believably sincere he wasnt competent sansa should never have trusted him littlefinger and the tyrells both offering to spirit sansa away should work nicely this season there are plenty of things for littlefinger to be sneaky about and plenty of areas for him to spar with varys and varys permits some of littlefingers machinations as he did by failing to warn ned similarly the belwas  whitebeard thing was clownish and iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad they decided to skip it they must have kept loras from joining the kingsguard at the end of season 2 so that the tyrells could offer to marry sansa to him that changes the dynamic since sansa had a crush on him but had to talk herself into wanting the willas marriage hmm maybe tywin will offer loras a spot in the kingsguard specifically to prevent the sansa marriage i would like to see jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interactions with loras but i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think anything really hinges on loras joining the guard book davos wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> hand when he was thrown in jail he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t an important person on dragonstone show davos is already an important person in stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> retinue â<U+0080><U+0093> throwing him in jail preemptively would be absurd i liked jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s changed justification to mance it fits into the story arc better the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch has forgotten about the others has forgotten about the real reason for the wall the wildlings have not forgotten and are in a desperate fight for life the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch is a decaying cynical clueless institution now jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s speech brings these issues into focus"
"darrylzero",2013-04-02,"a few things fell flat for methe first was starks men turning up at harrenhall this was a bit confusing since we had no idea that either northmen were being held there or that the mountains men had leftsecond with every episode i dislike sibil kekkilis performance more and more shes a good actress but in thrones she always sounds as thought shes reading from a cue cardthird and most important littlefingers behaviour is becoming inexplicable he would never have operated in the open as he did here i really dont understand why the writers didnt go down the road of a n other helping sansa escape kings landing with a big reveal later on that littlefinger was behind it all it did not need to be ser dontos it could even have been ros residual loyalty to her former lord pity for an abused young girl etc this littlefinger would have been caught out by varys ten times over by nowfourth i hated margaerys princess dianakate middleton routine i get that it established her as a friend of the commons but it would have been more effective to stick to the book and have tyrell menwomen handing out food to all rather than giving toys to orphans food would win over a starving people not wooden knights generally i like natalie dormers margaery but the orphanage scene just reeked of a contemporary tabloid news story1 no real comment i thought it worked ok but i dont really disagree either2 funny with each episode i hate it less and less though i still think hers are reliably the worst performances on the show i think she was an unfortunate casting choice and her acting has made it harder for me to engage with what i cautiously think might be pretty interesting deviations from the source material but i dont think hes as bad as she was in s1 her early performances were particularly nailsonchalkboard for me3 yes i actually think this would have been a great role for ros on the show unless shes also working with varys which it seemed like she might be because that could really complicate things 4 i see where youre coming from but i think its ok if some of the tyrells pr efforts are a little cheesy outside of olenna theyre not geniuses and the show did discuss their relief efforts the food coming in from the reach so i think that she goes a little overthetop it helps us identify with cersei being driven nuts by it and in particular by joffreys attitude toward it"
"MALICUS",2013-04-02,"that was probably an important letter tywin was writing devilgif classbbcemoticon altdevil i am very much looking forward to this playing out on the show"
"ebcarlton",2013-04-02,"i liked the quick reveal of barristan the bold as well it makes me think that maybe the showrunners will eventually start including rhaegar flashbacks for dany since barristan knew him"
"Qwop22",2013-04-02,"i think it needs to be mentioned that at the end of season 2 we saw ros basically become employed by varys so does this mean she is now spying on littlefinger for varys and if so that scene with her watching littlefinger talking to sansa at the docks has a little more reasoning she is clearly going to inform varys that lf has been meeting with sansa to discuss something and varys will no doubt find out about lf plan to rescue sansa however i dont really think varys will care too much because he already had his own grand plans in motion"
"TRAVYS",2013-04-02,"really enjoyed the margaery and dany scenes not the best got episode but as reviewers have said its the weakest of the first fouri hope thats true because i was disappointed with the season opener i still dont understand what was going on in the robbcatelyn at harrenhal scene it made no sense maybe im just a book snob but it seems the farther they get away from the book the plot is confusing or weak see the tywintyrion scene versus the dinner scene w joffrey and cerseii am okay they ditched strong belwas and the arstan pretense  thats the kind of stuff i expect from an adaptation not this ros plot line ghost being with the nights watch makes sense from a tv production sense and they do separate later in the book but its not explained at all in the showall in all id say its an average episode but a weak season opener"
