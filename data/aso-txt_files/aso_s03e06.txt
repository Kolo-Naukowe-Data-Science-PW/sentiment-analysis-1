"Mark Antony",2013-05-05,"710 roose and ramsay were both great i enjoyed the lfvarys scene and tormunds half a har made me happy other than that the episode was just okay imo thought episodes 4 and 5 were both significantly better"
"Lord Godric",2013-05-05,"it wasokay nothing spectacular i gave it a 7 which is the same as the premiere and tied for the lowest ive given all season"
"Ser Creighton",2013-05-05,"67 nothing special some odd changes"
"Ran",2013-05-05,"this one is very mediocre on a writing and characterization level i felt and its probably my least favorite of this season obviously you need to retool to start gearing up but meh"

"Ser Creighton",2013-05-05,"this one is very mediocre on a writing and characterization level i felt and its probably my least favorite of this season obviously you need to retool to start gearing up but mehand your rating is what is a meh on the scale of 110"
"morky",2013-05-05,"the worst episode so far was episode 2 this is a close second that being said i am enjoying season 3 significantly more than any episode from season 2 except for blackwater there were some really good scenes in here the wall climbing sequence has awesome effects some weird stuff too"
"nothatso",2013-05-05,"really just dont understand why theyve handled the jon stuff they way they have looking like they cut out another major part of his storyline as they did with the qhorin stuff in season 2 dont know how they can raid castle black with 3 raiders"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-05-05,"ill go with 7 i guess like everyone said not a lot going on kind of weird writing at times between aryagendrymel and the littlefinger sequence that shows sansa crying why did we skip tyrion telling her and shaes reaction to it"
"MMOWarrior",2013-05-05,"the calm before the storm well got style good setup episode with a couple surprises solid 8 im just glad there will be no more ros whining"
"Fez",2013-05-05,"a few good scenes but no excellent ones although if jamiebriennebolton had gone on longer it mightve been and a lot of dullness or misfires thought the climbing scenes were cheesy as hell and contained some not very good cgi giving it 6 eta that said i still dont mind any of the story changes i just want the changes and the fidelity to the book to be better written which this episode wasnt edited by fez 05 may 2013  0906 pm"
"TheHedgeWizard",2013-05-05,"gave it a 7 i really enjoy paul kaye as thoros of myr rip ros"
"Zman1863",2013-05-05,"it definitely did not stand out naturally they need to set up for some of the things that come later and thats fine but since so much was book deviation it felt a bit unsettling and im nervous about how those things turn out especially the melisandregendry thing"
"Funkagenda",2013-05-05,"pretty good the scene with littlefinger varys and ros was epic brilliantly with that voicever olenna  tywin was great as well amazing dialogues the climb of the wall was also pretty cool great atmoshpere parts with jaimeroose and robb and edmure were also pretty good bran s part was a bit less but meera was still pretty good 8510  810"
"Arrow",2013-05-05,"i gave it an 8 edmure looked so funny while he was trying to figure out why everyone was looking at him i like that actor i havent gotten this far with reading the books yet so im not quite sure whats really going on loved the bickering between osha and meera jons having to knock their heads together tywin and olenna wonderful scene experienced crusty old powermongers going at each other for control of the realm wow no mo ros we knew littlefinger was a scary beast but that was over the top he and joffrey between them came up with pure evil shudder arya really is a bamf she may turn out to be a worthy opponent for the red woman im worried for gendry jaime just cant keep his mouth shut can he stupid git i thought he was learning some humility guess its too much to hope for theon is doomed edited by arrow 06 may 2013  0208 am"
"Ser Creighton",2013-05-05,"first time i didnt enjoy an episode dunno tywin and qot saved it 65 7 cause im mercifulfelt the same way i gave it a 67 because of high production values and good actors i also new an episode like this was coming so i was not surprised i should give it a 10 because they got rid of ros but off camera to rob me of my glee oh no oh no oh no"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-05-05,"well here this season starts going really downhill by the looks of it i am so over everyone in kings landing except sansa the shows annoying toughgirl ygritte sucks something fiercely i wont even mention the theon crap well i guess i just did but ugh such a stupid decisionbut hey at least we got rid of rosi think you need more than 1 bad episode after 2 great episodes to really feel like something will trend down edited by darkandfullofturnips 05 may 2013  0906 pm"
"Caryn Stark",2013-05-05,"710 hated that they told sansa i loved her surprise in the books the jonygritte was overdone jaime and brienne are always amazing what was up with mels prophecy i liked the qottywin exchange but not the outcome at least ros is gone really a 65 but i rounded up in mercy"
"dtones520",2013-05-05,"least favorite episode of the series for me still wasnt a horrible episode the theon and ramsay scene was really good i love their decision to show ramsay breaking theon qot and tywin was really entertaining as was cersei and tyrion the scene with orell cutting jon and ygritte lose was really stupid to me not that i liked the change but i thought the scene with melisandre thoros and beric was really entertaining"
"jarl the climber",2013-05-05,"well at least we wont be hearing anymore complaints about ros anymore the tyrion and cersei scene was ok the dinner scene with jaimie and bolton fell flat tywin and ollenna could have been a good scene the way he forced her to agree to the marriage seemed kind of lame aryas stuff was probaly the best stuff we got jons scenes were better than they have been gave it a 6"
"LyannaStargaryen",2013-05-05,"i gave it a 7 i did like the tywincerseityrion scene the tywinqueen of thorns scene and all of the scenes with the brotherhood ramsay was gruesomely fantastic the climb was solid but not as tense as i thought it would be the barristanjorah conversation seemed pointless to include this episode and was a bit odd in drawing out the differences from the books so will dany never learn of jorahs earlier betrayal littlefinger genuinely creeped me out this episode his interaction with varys and monologue about the climb to power were pretty riveting too much loras too little maragery melisandre making it to the brotherhoods camp from dragonstone seemed far fetched"
"Mr.Black",2013-05-05,"it was alright the only part i really didnt like was that they killed ros off like that would of liked to see it happen"
"franko99",2013-05-05,"610 worst of the season by farthe bwb giving one of their mens just like that wtf and mel recognising arya or so it seems and not giving a fuck about ittormund not saying anyting about orell cutting jon and yggritesand ros i never thought i will care so much about her death but really wtf if they want to kill her why not use her as dontos replacement joffrey killing her just because hes a psycho wasstupidboltonjaimebrienne was an excellent scene in the books but in this episode wasmehi gave it a solid 8tywin and olenna cersei and tyrion varys and lfwell donethe rest of the episode but specially those part were really well done and ramsaytheon of course flaying yeah ok that sounds wrong edited by franko99 05 may 2013  0911 pm"
"Flayed Starkman",2013-05-05,"theres no way this episode was worse than 301 and 302 there were some changes from the books sure but as a cntained entity it worked pretty well too much theon though"
"Er Rn",2013-05-05,"gave it a 5 felt it was pretty dull"
"Greyjoy67",2013-05-05,"an 8 i was expecting a slower more expositionreliant episode after the punches of 345 and thats what we got lots of 6s and 7s here and yes it probably was the weakest episode but i give it scores based on how id rate any tv and i was gripped enough feel i should have perhaps just given a 10 to ep 5 though just cause that was so good liking the way theyre pacing this season a lot more than season 2 for entertainment its the best season yet if not quite as polished as season 1      loved the ending on the wall found it beautiful actually lots of symbolism and worked well with the music  which reminds me i love love love how theyve built up ygritte and jons relationship theres gonna some be hard stuff to swallow later down the line always need a good romance on tv shows like this  roose bolton is amazing  freys and tullys scene was nicely done  scene was a bit long but iway rheon fucking with theon is delicious  sansa tyrion shae worked nicely  ros is dead people will still probably find issue in her death after complaining about her for so long but yay  littlefinger and varys always good  sorry linda but i love ygritte in the show shes way more attractive than 90 of the tough female characters theyve tried to build up in the show  i did like melisandre and aryas interaction but the whole ill see you again thing  eh  ramsay scene too long as good as it was  osha v meera who the fuck cares im sorry but if osha is going away later i really dont get the point in their conflict show brans attraction to meera or what and the dream thing was a bit sudden and out of nowhere  the way scenes cut about this week editing was a bit off tbh too tired to think of anything else"
"Broken Fox",2013-05-05,"ill give it a 6 a mediocre episode as far as got goes good scenes the wall climb varys and littlefinger tyrion and cersei tywin and the queen of thorns everything else fell flat edited by elementengine 05 may 2013  0913 pm"
"Hound Dog",2013-05-05,"but hey at least we got rid of rosha one of the madeup scenes i actually enjoyed and it wasnt even really a scene just a wonderful happenstance"
"Died a Hero",2013-05-05,"7 it was funny i loved the jaime or not im still fucked and the pinbroach conversation but nothing really happened outside of the wall climb and that wasdisappointing but for all you theons torture isnt in the books i dont like that theyre showing us this stuff youre lame its the perfect example of how the second medium of a story can show things that the 1st medium didnt one of the best parts of this season has been the bastards games he made theon yell please cut my finger off theyre being true to that story that wasnt even told what more do you want i cant wait to hear reek say not bastard never bastard you mustnt call him that edited by died a hero 05 may 2013  0921 pm"

"scurvy",2013-05-05,"the worst of the season1"
"scurvy",2013-05-05,"i only enjoyed the casting of the freys and the parlay between ser jaime and lord bolton otherwise it was just bs wasted time when they could have told the story of the knight of the laughing tree and moved other things forward based upon the source material i guess tyrion now has motive for the purple wedding but otherwise it was oneonone dialogs telling things that shouldnt be said reek reek it rhymes with weak episode edited by scurvy 05 may 2013  0923 pm"

"Serial Killer Arya",2013-05-05,"i gave it a blah 7 not impressed by aything in particular brans story is dull  boring sam the slayer is looking like sam the dummy theon torture scenes can get boring if overdone jon snow has yet to look like the badass he is if they kill gentry i will toss all my tvs out the window fire the writer for this episode so much more could have bee told or better done"
"Agamemnon",2013-05-05,"710 first off the thorosmel was an interesting departure i had no clue what the red woman was up to when she left stannis last episode and now it seems gendry is in for a nice burning jon is going to have quite an easy time with just 3 wildlings south of the wall to worry about nothing to spectacular happened though i love that they killed ros long overdue and the lord paramount of the trident is poised to become as serious a badass as he is in the books in the next season"
"Serial Killer Arya",2013-05-05,"oh and whats up with the brown eyes green eyes being shut forever rw prophecy"

"Blue eyes Crowlack",2013-05-05,"how was thewriting off to you  just curious i thought as far as a tv show it was great very subtle in places with just enough epicness qot and tywin classic also the brusing of the brotherhood was a nice touch to me aint no good good guys bad bad"
"Fredwin",2013-05-05,"how can you say sam is the same in the books hes a coward not a total moron hes training to be a meister i gave it a 7 it was a very imbalanced episode the dialogue and direction of the first two scenes was probably the worst of the series in my opinion having them play back to back was a huge mistake"
"A Bear covered in Fluff",2013-05-05,"the barristanjorah conversation seemed pointless to include this episode and was a bit odd in drawing out the differences from the books so will dany never learn of jorahs earlier betrayal  whut that didnt happen this episode that was last episode"
"DolorousKim",2013-05-05,"i actually rather liked this episode so it gets an 8 rating from me to me it was much stronger than episode 2 and a bit stronger than episode 1 sure it was a bit of a let down compared to the past two episode but still this is a vast improvement over pretty much every episode in season 2 with the exception of the blackwater episodewhat worked for melady olennalord tywin  for all the folks who were getting disgruntled with the qot owning everyone that she conversed with we a have scene where each player held hisher own great acting as usual from charles dance and diana riggtyrioncersei  a bit of a new dynamic shown in this normally totally antagonistic relationship i guess misery makes for some strange bedfellows i really liked this scene and both peter dinklage and lena headey acquitted themselves quite wellthorosanyoneeveryone  i am also really enjoying paul kaye take on thoros he totally dominates every scene that hes injonwildings  i thought that the climb sequences were pretty well executed and that tormund was a bit more in keeping with the tormund from the books i also think that these sequences helped to advance the jon snowygritte relationship a bit further into the realm of believability orell sucks pretty hard thoughlittlefingervarys  i always like to see these two characters interacting and littlefinger was especially chilling his character has not been done justice thus far this season and i say this as someone who doesnt even care for the character to any great extent but i thought that the final scene was a big step in the right directionjaimebrienneroose  not a showstopping scene but something about this one was both amusing and creepy to me all at the same time roose telling jaime that he overplayed hisposition i was yelling hand during the pause i also like the failing at dinner line from jaimewhat didnt work for mei guess that im in the minority here but i really didnt like the ramsaytheon scene i hate torture sequences to begin with and things just seemed to go on forever please please tell me that we are not going to have two full seasons for theon getting tortured by ramsayarya the master archer  just wtf since when is arya some super wunderkind with the bow and arrowjojen has a seizure  again wtf are they mixing his character up with robert aryn i mean robin arynmeeraosha antagonism  why why is this necessaryberic selling gendry to mel  totally not in keeping with berric and the bwb may have been the most disappointing sequence of the episode to meros  okay i was never a fan but man that was a pretty shitty way for her character to have gone out"
"Jabronius Maximus",2013-05-05,"well it was just a meh episode i gave it a 7 the show was firing on all cylinders the last couple weeks but this week was more of a pit stop hopefully it picks up moving forward and i really dont like the actor for lf imo dude is tearing apart the character"
"Fredwin",2013-05-05,"what didnt work for mearya the master archer  just wtf since when is arya some super wunderkind with the bow and arrowwell in episode one season one didnt she take the bow from bran and make an expert shot for tv continuity that is"
"lomiller",2013-05-05,"gave it a 7 due to a couple good scenes it was more of a 65 though worst episode of the season imo"

"go joff go",2013-05-05,"i gave it a seven i didnt dislike any scenes its just that it had too many low key scenes just the way it happens i was slightly disappointed that the bolton scene ended up being one of the shorter scenes in the episode"

"DolorousKim",2013-05-05,"well in episode one season one didnt she take the bow from bran and make an expert shot for tv continuity that isyep you are right that did happen in episode one but i took it to be more of lucky shot perhaps i misinterpreted and it was meant more to show her overall skill level my mind keeps going back to the way that book arya had trouble bending the bow properly when she was with bwb and thats where my cognitive dissonance is undoubtedly coming from"
"KRANG202",2013-05-05,"easily the worst of the season meh"
"DreamSongs",2013-05-05,"personally the only thing that really ruined the episode for me was loras scenes especially that horrible scene with sansa in the garden sophie turner deserves a better actor to play off of"
"Florina Laufeyson",2013-05-05,"9 it was pretty great because the wall stuff was awesomely done that shot of jon and ygritte on the top was beautiful sam singing the little children song was so great its my favorite sam moment 3 the big change with mel and gendry was pretty drastic but it works it really works im ok with itwell guys we dont have to worry about ros anymore scattered applausedropping lots of foreshadow bombs and the getting rid of ros plus roose action and some wall made for a good episode for me"

"Lothar",2013-05-05,"my first 10 of the season because finally its slower theyve allowed scenes and stories to breathe and it doesnt feel theyre rushing through the plot which is how the last episode felt to me i feel like this was the most understandable episode of the season for causal fans i think it was so much better written than the last episode i feel like its the first time theyve done jons story justice this season mostly because they actually spent time on him with theon theyve finally told the audience that no theyre not supposed to know whos torturing theon or whats going on and the torture is becoming just as brutal as it was in the books olennatywin and varyslittlefinger were two scenes with awesome awesome dialogue that i loved all the more because i wasnt expecting it the entire climb and the beautiful shot at the end were some of the most atmospheric scenes in the series oh and ros is dead how could anyone give it less than a 9"
"lostinwesteros",2013-05-05,"this season is beginning to unravel i fear getting tired of ygrittes bravado felt shortchanged by the brief sam and gilly scene and shortchanged by the brief bran scene the sansaloras scene was entirely unnecessary imo qot and tywin was pretty good especially when she broke his quill hated what happened to ros liked the scene with tyrion and cercei the theonramsay scene was well played but i still think its being included at the expense of other solid story lines bran and company samgilly  i cant wait for coldhands  and i really hope were not going to get cheated out of him roose scene was weak frey scene was ok  loved the appearance of the frey boys view down from the wall was terrifichated the whole melisandre bit hated that beric and thoros handed gendry over to her men im no longer a fan of the bwbtheyre not a brotherhood after all gave it a 7 edited by not only but also 05 may 2013  1041 pm"

"Moi Aussi",2013-05-06,"it was the worst of the seasonwhich is disappointing because the last few episodes have been great i know that from the very beginning the show has made little changes to the book materiala new scene here or there but mostly it seemed to simplify and quickly explain material in a concise manner or to add a bit of humor generally i have had no problem with these changes some i even liked with this episode for the first time it really seemed to me they were starting to diverge from the books in a more significant way if that is the case i think it is a bad development especially since this episode just was not as good as the others this season i really hope this is not the start of a trend"

"Loras",2013-05-06,"overall i rated this episode as an 8 i think that the biggest problem that i had with the episode was the scene ordering i dont think that i will ever understand why the episode started with a sam scene that really didnt go anywhere other than to show off the dragonglass followed by a bran scene that didnt achieve that much either by starting with those two incredibly slow scenes the episode lost an awful lot of momentum right from the get go the rest of the episode was good i loved the jon sequences and felt that his story has now had some much needed development i also loved the varyslittlefinger scene leading into the montage the only scene that i thought was dreadful was the sansaloras scene though the direction with their reflections in the pond made up for the atrocious dialogue"

"Mr Smith",2013-05-06,"i dunno why everyones so down on this one im quite happily giving it an 8 no really huge moments but a lot of good small moments between characters i loved the thoros monologue thought it finally shed a bit of light on a character who up till now has been a bit of an anomaly quite enjoyed the climb itself although some of the cgi could have been better ramsays game playing was excellent and im glad he hasnt revealed himself yet and tywin and olenna were outstanding every scene of theirs so far has been the best in each episode littlefingers speech was great probably his only good scene so far this season there wasnt much i really disliked about the episode but there were a few disappointments i really wish wed spent more time with jaime and roose that scene felt terribly underdone the bran stuff was also highly underwhelming though i suppose they have to stretch that storyline out to breaking point"
"Holdfast",2013-05-06,"710 would probably have scored it higher except that the last two episodes have been so good for the first time departures from the books have really bothered me especially dont like that sansa knows of her impending marriage so far ahead of time this episode has wasted bran story development time and has reinforced to me that this season has not handled his story well and there goes my theory that ros would be the dontos replacement in sansas story"

"The Killer Snark",2013-05-06,"im giving it a 9 last weeks was better but marginally i think people are getting put off here by two factors that the pace was very leisurely and the episode served mainly to set up future plot points and that a fair amount of liberties were made with the source material or new material added in part because of prior cuts or unneccesary alterations i admit yet aside from the somewhat crass giving over of gendry most of these scenes worked the pace was just a little too leisurely towards the end and the death of roz wont go down well with petyr baelish apologists and suggests the producers realise her character was superfluous in the first place since she isnt in the books ive reversed my opinion on the actor playing ramsay though i still wish theyd went with someone a bit bulkier and more physically weird i dont think the lack of real events are a big problem here considering how readers had to adapt to catelyn being sidelined at riverun for around 900 pages while her father refused to kick the bucket so im glad at lease theyve cut back on that here rose leslie as ygritte is proving an increasing treat and ill be sad when she leaves the series one point which is probably improved over the books is the fact that osha is still in it who i believe martin sent off to skagos because he couldnt think of how to use her im developing an attraction for the actress playing meera reed next weeks episode will no doubt be better but i think the panning many are giving this one wouldnt happen if they hadnt already read the books and were oblivious to the changes that have been made only the pointless fate of gendry had me silently groaning to myself however at the moment im struggling to take an interest in the direly scripted badly characterised and snailpaced last season of spartacus so i might be inclined to be slightly generous in this case edited by the killer snark 06 may 2013  1214 pm"

"Table8",2013-05-06,"gave it a 7 but in hindsight should have given it a six the episode was rather slow and plodding its understandable that not every episode can be as good as the last 2 but as the season moves on its becoming very noticeable that certain storylines just arent moving well at all so far brans scenes are just horrible slow uninteresting and tedious so far it feels like each scene has been put in just to remind the viewer that this kid bran is still around jon snows story is a bit uninteresting as well it seems the show runners are doing everything they can to force feed us a relationship between jon and ygrite reminds me of anakin and padme  you know they have to get together but the relationship is contrived and not organic at all my least favorite actress in the series has been ygrite her name is escaping me now also imdisappointed that they killed off all but 3 of the wildlings i expected the season to end with a decent battle at castle black but its hard to think how there can be any battle with so few antagonists ive come around on the whole theon situation at first i was excited at the prospect of experiencing his story as it happens as opposed to an afterthefact narrative ala the books but seriously what is the endgame here theres only so much torture im willing to digest theon became one of my favorite characters as the story unfolded and alfie is my favorite actor in the series but these torture scenes are not really doing much anymore except grossing me and my girlfriend out i really liked the scene between varys and lf elio and linda might have a problem with the frankness of lfs dialogue but honestly that scene had my hair standing up seeing a dead roz and a crying sansa with the creepy music in the background was very powerful my reviews so far this year episode 1 7 episode 2 7 episode 3 5 episode 4 9 episode 5 8 and this one got a restated 6"

"Zar Lannister",2013-05-06,"this one is very mediocre on a writing and characterization level i felt and its probably my least favorite of this season obviously you need to retool to start gearing up but mehreally i thought there were good moments like the boys characterization was very good i thought the change of pulling information from theons storyline from dance into this season was correct its also the sensible monetary decision giving alfie a 2 year vacation to have him recount his misadventures while away is not as attractive visually as it is reading about itthought tywin and lady olenna excelled even if their interactions werent cannon served to see how two players play their cards just like the varyslf scene"

"Lucifer Lightbringer",2013-05-06,"i am going to be pretty harsh and go with 410 this episode especially after the last two is barely recognizable as asoiaf or even the got show they have done so much great work adapting the story this season working with the time and resources they have available to show the broader strokes of characterization and making changes that are either necessary or that actually add something on their own merit however this episode is a total throwaway almost all of the adaptive changes theyve made appear totally unnecessary and superfluous this episode does not treat you like an intelligent person it smacks you in the head with a brick in order to resolve any questions or subtleties the shows writing may have left in question cliches abound and many characters are made more onedimensional through clumsy characterization this episode is one of the poorest examples of writing in the whole series in my opinion you see it coming from every angle loras is just a silly gay knight who wants to have a pretty wedding and have lots of gay sex with whomever tyrion is just a sardonic saint in a bad situation littlefinger is the joker in velvet ygritte and jon are bonny and clyde when you put the writing done by dd in contrast with some of the better writers on the show it really makes it seem like they just dont have the minds for this type of work they cant stand having grey characters or leaving questions over which one can ponder and debate they have done some work on this show that is just so hamfisted and clumsy that its almost laughable i understand that they have to lower the scope and detail of the source material in order to put asoiaf into one hour tv slots and do it without totally confusing people still they often make choices which seem so clumsy and convoluted when they could just be keeping it simple and they could leave some things a little more open without being confusing it must be said that i dont abhor all deviations from the books some things are handled very well and some even add a new dimension to the story however sometimes they change a characters fundamental traits or motivations so much or change plot points so that the only way to reconcile the alterations with the greater story becomes a complication in itself what i see in this episode is that they have basically had to take an entire hour to scramble at making any sense out of some of their greater deviations they will have to take such measures again in the future thanks to things like revealing pointblank why tyrion was almost killed in blackwater having melisandre make an inexplicable trip to kidnap gendry and giving littlefinger a some people just want to watch the world burn speech there were parts in this episode that were done well but none that stood out lord bolton ramsay and theon are progressing well and i think that their interactions provide some much needed mystery for non book readers again though i just cant understand why given their already stifling limitations they would spend so much time on other things that are so superfluous and irrelevant overall this was easily amongst the weakest episodes of the entire series edited by lucifer lightbringer 06 may 2013  0624 pm"

"Words of Winter",2013-05-07,"i am going to be pretty harsh and go with 410this episode especially after the last two is barely recognizable as asoiaf or even the got show they have done so much great work adapting the story this season working with the time and resources they have available to show the broader strokes of characterization and making changes that are either necessary or that actually add something on their own merit however this episode is a total throwawayalmost all of the adaptive changes theyve made appear totally unnecessary and superfluous this episode does not treat you like an intelligent person it smacks you in the head with a brick in order to resolve any questions or subtleties the shows writing may have left in question cliches abound and many characters are made more onedimensional through clumsy characterization this episode is one of the poorest examples of writing in the whole series in my opinionyou see it coming from every angle loras is just a silly gay knight who wants to have a pretty wedding and have lots of gay sex with whomever tyrion is just a sardonic saint in a bad situation littlefinger is the joker in velvet ygritte and jon are bonny and clyde when you put the writing done by dd in contrast with some of the better writers on the show it really makes it seem like they just dont have the minds for this type of work they cant stand having grey characters or leaving questions over which one can ponder and debate they have done some work on this show that is just so hamfisted and clumsy that its almost laughable i understand that they have to lower the scope and detail of the source material in order to put asoiaf into one hour tv slots and do it without totally confusing people still they often make choices which seem so clumsy and convoluted when they could just be keeping it simple and they could leave some things a little more open without being confusingit must be said that i dont abhor all deviations from the books some things are handled very well and some even add a new dimension to the story however sometimes they change a characters fundamental traits or motivations so much or change plot points so that the only way to reconcile the alterations with the greater story becomes a complication in itself what i see in this episode is that they have basically had to take an entire hour to scramble at making any sense out of some of their greater deviations they will have to take such measures again in the future thanks to things like revealing pointblank why tyrion was almost killed in blackwater having melisandre make an inexplicable trip to kidnap gendry and giving littlefinger a some people just want to watch the world burn speechthere were parts in this episode that were done well but none that stood out lord bolton ramsay and theon are progressing well and i think that their interactions provide some much needed mystery for non book readers again though i just cant understand why given their already stifling limitations they would spend so much time on other things that are so superfluous and irrelevantoverall this was easily amongst the weakest episodes of the entire series agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  i agree with everything you said i too gave it a four its not the changes to the story so much that bother me although they do a little it is the poorly written substitute if the quality was the same as the dialogue from the books then it wouldnt bother me so much the constant lorasrenly treatment is so cliche and it lowers the whole episode the cheesy ending was so badly done i expected little birds to flutter around them and have ygritte break out in song and to those who thought the snowwall looked realistic i have lived both in sub arctic climates and mountainous regions it looked like styrofoam looking a it i can tell they were on a set with a green screen background look at that snow versus the snow in the scenes taken in iceland one is natural the other is high school prop design"

"Hear me Meow",2013-05-07,"im over getting annoyed about changes and ive given up on some stories so im enjoying this season a lot so farthat said im only giving it a 510the best bits were the harrenhal scene with jaimebrienne and roose and robbs negotiation with the freys i really like their version of edmure i wish the blackfish would stop being such a bully though the sam scene was quite good and i didnt dislike the meeraosha thing like most people didsadly there was way too much wall in this one and thats always bad because kit sucks something fierce the arent you line had me creasing when i saw the promo and it was just as funny in the episode toothe other bad thing was the fact the writing was really very poor for the tywinolenna scene they were both being colossally stupid and it was very implausible in my opinion it looked like it was two experienced players going at each other but if you thought it through it just fell apartaiden gillen was awful as usual he had a very boring monologue sansa has been made very stupid with the will my family be invited line too the brotherhood wasnt bad though i didnt mind that change too muchoverall despite some good scenes not enough that was interesting and some quite poor writing edited by bran the deciduous 07 may 2013  0646 am"

"Hound Dog",2013-05-07,"aiden gillen was awful as usual he had a very boring monologue ahh yes didnt know who this actor by his name at first so i had to google image him first littlefinger i dont like him as littlefinger either but for me i think its more the depiction of him that bothers me more than the actor himself the scenes between lf and varys bother me quite a bit because every single one is the same flirty and hostile and a flowery song of nahnah i know more than you do what wouldve been wrong with having varys and lf interact with and manipulate characters directly to their faces the way they do in the books they would be so much more effective that way in my opinion though i read somewhere yesterday in one of these threads that someone said the general public is stupid and tv needs to be dumbed down for them and i couldnt agree more with that how unfortunate two characters whose mystery and intrigue dont really come off the screen for me nearly as much as they did in the booksyou also said kit sucks something fierce yuuuuuup"

"SpringIsComing",2013-05-07,"first timer here but i thought id weigh in on this i liked this episode because it effectively served its purpose in teeing up the final events of s3 exposition is a necessary evil and the developments weve seen here should flow nicely to the final few episodes im a bit of a book purist and dont like change for change sake ie yaraasha but i also have liked what theyre doing here on many fronts building the ygrittejon relationship and topping it with the top of the world shot readers know what will happen but viewers will be truly unsure of which way this will play out will jon honor his duty or his feelings for ygrittetorture everything that were seeing on screen happened in the book story the only difference is that we didnt get any pov on it and only saw a posttransition rheon by the time we get his povs in adwd hes already been flayed and amputated showing this happen should give viewers and readers an even better perspective on the character arc  tyrion theyre continuing to give him motive for killing joffrey sir meryn is one piece but tyrion has a soft spot for whores i wonder if well see him get angry about the way ros was dismissed sam i liked how hes being portrayed i find him lovably infuriating in the books and his tv scenes give me the same feeling i thought we see a slayer moment with the way they shot it and that added some nice suspense to me im sure well see more of that obsidian dagger in the next episode or two  bwb this seems perfectly consistent storytelling to me gendry has not been knighted yet and as such is not officially part of the bwb arya is being ransomed because shes worth something gendry wasnt worth a ransom until mel showed up add in the red god aspect and it makes 100 perfect sense that theyd cash in on gendry arya i really liked that arya had a sort of instinctive distrust of mel the lord of light seems to represent life and arya said her only god is death nice foreshadowing  dinner the subtle growth of the relationship between brienne and jaime was well executed brienne with the knife and then with the fork were both really nicely done roose bolton is sufficiently creepy and isnt tipping his hand on the lannister alliance in the conversation bran grrm has stated that bran is the hardest character for him to write and we dont see many chapters telling his story i like the creation of tension between meeraosha as a starting point for a parting of ways im guessing well see a split either based on a jojen green dream or after a night at queenscrown osha simply wont agree to going over the wall overall 810 for me every episode cant and shouldnt be an explosion of action need to climb the rollercoaster before you can hit the big twists and turns ps is this the first episode to be nudityfree if so there might be some 4thwall symbolism with ross method of death eg we only had her on to add an excuse for ta and now we dont need that gratuity any more"

"Greywolf2375",2013-05-08,"to me this has been the weakest episode of the season so far  which still puts it above most of what is on tv but compared to the other episodes fell short what i liked  jaime  brienne they just continue to build on a great dynamic between the two  tywin and olenna two strong characters and in this case they didnt have to dumb one down to interact with the other  the wallclimb thought it portrayed it well i do wish they had jon thinksay to himself the wall defends itself though it maybe it comes out next week  the bastard poor theon done well i just hope they dont go overboard on what they do feel the need to show from the standpoint of the torture what i didnt like  the picnic in the forest sam and gilly are literally on the run from the nw who just murdered mormont and craster as well as the undead army yet can have a sit down sing along what made it powerful in the book not that it has to be an exact reproduction was the sense of urgency and fear none of that was around when we do get sam the slayer considering the two of them just ran how is it going to really be plausible that his brothers can find them deus ex ghostmachina the hamfisted way the dagger was inserted made the scene even clumsier  gendrymelisandres gps while davos can still oppose the idea of using gendry to do her deeds gendry does not have innocence of edric and does not have the personal connection with stannis that edric did can it still work yeah  the goal being she needs kings blood does it work as well not in my opinion then the issue that the messages that are received in the flames are always for interpretation <U+0080><U+0093> the flames are right but both mel and thoros have said they are flawed in reading them yet somehow she is able to ride straight to where they are in what seems like  an hour  tyrell heir not having garlan or willas and having loras be the heir to me is a loss having another character be named and be offscreen is not an issue but having the tyrells be backed into a corner because of the removal of character names is if loras is named to the kg then the one generation away the heir to highgarden is a baratheonlannister given what qot said she basically is stating she knows the baratheon children are lannister if he is not named to the kg then a reason to not have he and cersei marry needs to be created varyslf while i love seeing these two spar against each other the feel of the series when they do these gets to be almost like saved by the bell when zack would call timeout and speak to the audience no overall opinion ros being killed i<U+0080><U+0099>m glad she is of f the show i think the addition of that character was unnecessary given the number of characters that preexisted and could have been used in the places she was do i care it happened no it does reinforce joffreys personality to this point he had not personally killed someone so <U+0080><U+0093> unless there is another player in the room we didn<U+0080><U+0099>t see <U+0080><U+0093> he now is individually a murderer"

"gwenyth",2013-05-12,"it was ok gave it a 5 i cant give any higher to episodes that seem to me to have utterly wasted and stupid scenes  like the sansaloras ludicrousness i think there was at least one other scene that struck me as a waste of time but either im conflating with another episode or it was so forgettable ive  forgotten it besides the atleastborderingon engaging in stereotyping characterization  which others here have noted  the sansaloras scene was just stupid sansa is not my favorite character  far from it  but she had developed some depth last season or at least reflected having learned something from her experiences in that scene she is again a starryeyed simpleton it doesnt help that i find the actor cast as loras totally unconvincing in the role also every time we have an extended scene with the qot i am reminded how much more perfect i think helen mirren would be for the role the actor playing lord tywin is always a pleasure to watch and the scene reintroducing the graceless dour and unattractive freys was good"

"Valar Morghulis Not Today",2013-05-14,"was good as always but not exactly my favourite of the series i think the boy is playing his role brilliantly but dont want to see as much of it qot with tywin is something that would almost always happen two of the best actors in the series which is awesomely cast 7"
"star shine7",2013-08-27,"i actually really enjoyed this episode and gave it a 9 i loved jon and ygrittes scene before they climbed the wall and then the wall scenes were amazing i really enjoyed olenna and tywins scene and the shock of the episode for me was what they did to ros"

"Rockroi",2013-05-05,"i have a few comments to share on what i thought was a very well done episodewhat i likedtywin i i thought this was a perfect episode where tywin<U+0080><U+0099>s power and hubris was brought in perfect contrast to olenna<U+0080><U+0099>s grace and wit tywin was as great as he has ever been i thought that both characters were equal to the other unlike the prior discussions between olenna and tyrionvarys etc wherein each of them turned into a stuttering fool  olenna may be working an angle but if so why wait if she wanted loras married to cersei all along why fight against it i think tywin scored a big win but i cannot imagine olenna going quietly on this regardless tywin at the meeting and then having tyrion and cersei struggling to simply cope with their new reality was tremendous in so many ways while chaos may be the rope the one holding the strings is still that guy the scale i felt the difficulty in this episode and in the huge monolith that was erected be it tywin be it giving up the god whether it be the wall itself i thought that using the <U+0080><U+009C>climb<U+0080><U+009D> up the wall as an allegory of the entire episode worked very well and the actual climb tied into the actual love story of ygritte and jon was very well done though definitely not subtle i thought that last shot was grand and huge and hamfisted i really thought that the episode showed us in all aspects just how hard everything really is nice touch i liked how yigritte made fun of jon snow by quoting <U+0080> jon snow i have said many many many times that jon snow can kill dead things go beyond the wall etc and he<U+0080><U+0099>s fine but show the kid one tit and he pees himself made no sense in the book so it was refreshing to hear ygritte share my own ridicule not so nice touch i think that in hindsight there is no way anyone could ever climb that wall like ever nicest touch tormon ginatsbane is rapidly becoming one of my favorite characters tough decent determined and strangely kind he is the most complete of the thirdlevel characters the little rope i will say that while i am relatively unimpressed with the <U+0080><U+009C>obvious<U+0080><U+009D> scenes wherein characters who are talking should not be actually talking i thought that the lfvarys backandforth was great varys strangely represents optimism hope and fulfillment lf represents a bleak dystopia wherein all there is are rope and ash and he is the one watching others climb that dichotomy was a very wellneeded bookmark for this episode and this series poor rozthe treaty i liked almost every aspect of the starkfrey peace process and i really liked how robb basically turned to edmure and said <U+0080><U+009C>you are paying for my monumental screwup<U+0080><U+009D> even the part where the blackfish makes his threat it<U+0080><U+0099>s the rational side of this family that supersedes the emotional for once heh i really enjoyed that scene what i am not sure onchasing gendry while the removal of the westerling brood morphed a major plot arc there has been no greater departure from books to show than having mel wander into the brotherhood camp so the entire lannisters cannot find them but this woman and 4 guys found them after what 3 days and immediately takes gendry the implication is vast but let me state a few things1 i am not a book purist2 exchanging gendry for edric storm was a wise move and greatly improved the economy of characters it greatly streamlines plot actors time and pace it<U+0080><U+0099>s a wise move3 i think the footprint of the <U+0080><U+009C>lord of light<U+0080><U+009D> was well done and kept inline with the show i especially enjoyed the interplay between mel the true believer and thoros the fraud who became a believer that worked<U+0080><U+0080>but<U+0080>it becomes hard to swallow the <U+0080><U+009C>brotherhood without banners<U+0080><U+009D> as a democracy of rogues and scalawags who are there <U+0080><U+009C>for the people<U+0080><U+009D> and then turn around and say <U+0080><U+009C>oh yeah cool take him no biggie<U+0080><U+009D> leave aside the reality that blacksmiths are valuable but everyone is cool with this thoros bedric etc everyone is fine right and they have no internal debate about this wtf i am not sure i buy this nor am i sure that i buy that these men would do that this turn in the story only makes sense<U+0080><U+0080> if you are writing the episode and know that stannis needs a baratheon child ugh<U+0080>the end of roz as i stated recently i ultimately think that i liked roz and i enjoyed that she was fun so<U+0080> how does she end to show us again how stupid and cruel joff is i thought we knew that already i think there was no reason to kill roz but maybe it worked because well the whole reason roz was there in the first place was because the writers wanted a catchall to follow the story well once she was no longer needed<U+0080>the bickering there is an element of the show that i enjoy and that is that merely because you and i are on the same side does not mean we get along we saw that with the karstarks and starks the lannisters and tyrells now we see it with the fragments of the starks first we see it with the reeds and osha and their squabbles then we see it with tyrion and shae as he has to tell her that he will marry sansa but here is my problem<U+0080>really<U+0080> who cares i don<U+0080><U+0099>t give a flying fuck if osha loves meera opr hates her i don<U+0080><U+0099>t care if shae is cool with the idea of tyrion marrying sansa or if she is heartbroken i don<U+0080><U+0099>t care i find that micormanagement of the show and the relationships to be boring i want more out of the story by delving into those things we care about and not expanding into the minutia of what we don<U+0080><U+0099>t care about note i also have a deep seated fear that the reason shae is the way she is is specifically so she can be <U+0080><U+009C>broken hearted<U+0080><U+009D> about tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s marriage and that is what compels her actions at the end of sos that would just suck out loud suck what i did not likethere was no scene that i really disliked with all that said this episode felt fine but it also had gaping empty parts that i did not enjoy as much but that<U+0080><U+0099>s fine while i wonder why i had to watch sam and gilly in the woods and why i had to watch the stuff i said above i get a lot of this and can appreciate the readjustment of the pace but i hope it returns to the quality of the last

"Meddler",2013-05-05,"had a thought for how we might potentially get aryas crossroads inn scene into the series after this episode thinking about the whole setup with mel hinting shell kill three people the three sets of different colored eyes in the books we know that that arya kills three people between this point and the end of adwd the tickler dareon who also go a name drop in this episode and the moneylender however the ticklers already dead and the other character who gets killed at the crossroads inn by the hound is polliver who is yet to appear in the show however we dont really have any role for the mountain during the red wedding for the show in fact has he even appeared yet this season i dont believe he has in the books hes feigning a pursuit of roose bolton and supposedly catches him by surprise as hes crossing the ruby ford this turns out to be a ploy to remove some stark loyalists from play prior to the rw and spare some bolton supporters from having to attend the massacre though when the mountain arrives at the ford the only men yet to cross are a small rear guard of manderly knights along with some lockes norreys and burleys who are starkloyal mountain clansmen roose then leaves behind ryswell cerwyn hornwood and barrowtown men to guard the far side of the ford supposedly to prevent the mountain from crossing but really because these are factions that would later support him when hes granted the north none of this is going to happen in the show that leaves the mountain free to potentially show up at the rw perhaps in a confrontation with sandor and arya maybe arya will see one of the mountains men kill someone or something grey wind anyone after some family drama between the cleganes the chaos will allow the hound to escape with arya but aryas got a new mountain man added to her hit list polliver perhaps someone they can then run into at the crossroads inn in season 4 edited by meddler 05 may 2013  1158 pm"

"lostinasia",2013-05-06,"a few different points the show is definitely playing up the religious fanaticism of the bwb rather than the robin hood element its a change from the book but one im interested in  remember when the bwb first appeared a few episodes ago some remarked that they appeared too much the merry men cliche at least the one true god element will take them away from that muchtrodden terrain so far as the bwb goes i like the change but i want the show to do a lot more to bring forward the suffering of the normal people of the riverlands and in that regard the change worries me im glad jon snow finally got to do something ok it was just swinging on the rope and saving his and ygrittes lives but thats one of the few times its seemed like hes not just stared dully at someone and then slowly realized oh i guess id better do this plus the arent you scared exchange was one of the first hints ive got that he may actually be a pleasant fellow to be around hey the man can show a trace of a smile poor orell am i the only one who thinks that his cutting the rope would have been the right thing to do sure cruel to those two but better than all four dying something thats been mentioned but not quite highlighted enough yes ross death emphasizes joffs sadism and we already knew that but much more importantly it shows how dangerous and baleful baelish sorry is hes been a mustachetwirling twit for far too long and now theres actually more menace backing him up however i wasnt a big fan of the final speech you sly dog you got me monologuing i dont at all understand how sansa or anyone else could possibly trust showlittlefinger hes too transparently a villain and has been for a long time  but now with ross death hes a villain thats dangerous rather than just full of himself i loved the scene between loras and sansa loras is trying hes really trying to do the right thing and be something of a gentleman but he just doesnt have a clue and sansa doesnt have a clue in her own way two fairly decent but not particularly bright people trying to find their way in a horrible world i liked the attempt to juxtapose littlefingers nihilism with the gorgeous sunset falling upon jon and ygritte the sweet young lovers or are they and have we ever seen direct sunlight on jon before  but the overall effect was just a bit too hamfisted i dont know why people care about the show spoiling elements in future book first of all prophecies are so vague they can be retconned to mean anything whether it be three kills or three disguises or a game of marbles that arya wins second accept it  the show is either going to end too early without an ending or it will pass grrm probably in three years and then the books will later come out and most people will talk about how much better they are than the tv show while the new breed of tv show purists will complain about how grrm ruined dds perfect story"

"Meddler",2013-05-06,"i think theres a key piece of the theon story thats being missed by almost everyone its not just an excuse to give alfie allen screen time and its also not just a replacement for the reek storyline its also a replacement for the hornwood inheritance problem this was the first we hear about ramsay at all and even if we dont directly meet the character it shows his extreme sadism and brutality this is an important aspect of the character and one we dont get with the reek story with reek we see the deviousness and cunning but we dont see the sheer brutality transmuting the reek and hornwood stories into the boy story shows both elements of the character and yes gives alfie allen something to do beyond that i think its also a setup to show nonbook readers some of the darkness that surrounds house bolton in the books we get a decent sense of this through roose but in ways that would be difficult to depict in the showthe way people feel when he speaks his interactions with the other lords details about the history of tensions between house bolton and stark etc for newbies it would be completely shocking not just that the rw happens but that when roose is actually the one to finish robb it would be downright confusing hes been robbs most trusted general for the last two seasons whereas in the books he has very little direct interaction with robb after they split up at the twins"

"rmholt",2013-05-07,"it was not live or onscreen in the books thoughwell to me if it didnt happen in the books it isnt in the books this happened in the books and the descriptions certainly match the tv depiction"
"rmholt",2013-05-07,"i really wish they would cut down on the torture scenes and make them less explicit if it is important to convey how evil ramsay is why cant it be done indirectly for example we were shown how joffrey killed ros and can infer things about his character without seeing the actual process of him putting all those arrows in herwe could be shown a theon with broken teethmissing body parts and infer from that the character of ramsay if they really need to show a torture scene why not just show one and stop at that from the episode 7 preview i am guessing they will be castrating theon in the next episode i really wish that was not in the episodeare they doing it for story development or to shock viewers is it healthy for people to watch this kind of thingi have seen more protests of the theon torture scenes than ros and other prostitute torture scenes including a baby killed in its mothers arms in fact i have seen more complaints about those than the ros death scene  many comments many saying wow what a surprise but not at the creep factor little closer to home boys"

"-Ghost-",2013-05-07,"not a change really is it theons pov describe what happened to him and it seems pretty much in line with the show actioni would say so instead of waiting 2 more seasons to have theon remember what happened we get it now the same stuff that theon remembers happening from the book is still going to i imagine but now we get to actually see it and see ramsay and theon interacting together"
"Meddler",2013-05-07,"i guess my problem with theon is that short of some nonbook storyline he doesnt really have much to do between now and season 5 except be tortured so what are they going to do have ramsay take a digit or a toe off every two episodesive been wondering if theyll do the sequence where he tries to escape with kyra it would feel a bit redundant to his initial escape attempt with ramsay but they do seem to be hinting that theyre going to keep the loveofthehunt aspect of ramsay intact so i have a feeling well see another escape attempt thwartedotherwise i do think its mostly going to be theon getting broken and transformed into reek not necessarily just tortured but broken to the point where hes viewing himself as ramsays creature i do imagine some of the adwd stuff will get moved up to season 4 possibly the moat cailin stuff but it may be more just some of the details like why reek starts rhyming is name with everything and earning a bit of ramsays trust and getting to sleep with the dogs and eat meat it doesnt actually cover that many pages in the books but theres really a lot that the show can cover between moat cailin which may not actually be moat cailin well see barrowtown and the winterfell weddingeven expanded on they could show roose conspiring with the karstarks some of the story with alys karstark and her escape maybe they could even have ramsay try to hunt her with or instead of cregan fail and go on a tirade all the murders at winterfell etc a lot of the specific details of the dynamic between ramsay and theon will likely be moved up into semiinvented stories since those are things we dont see in the books until much later and that would also clear room for more heavy plot lifting with this arc during seasons 5 and 6 i also wonder if theyre going to even include the maderlyglover subversion theres no wex so no one knows bran and rickon are alive besides theon and ramsay at this point maybe theyll blend wex in with the liddle at some point this season and have the liddle serve that purpose later for maderly and glover"
"Kaitscralt",2013-05-07,"larry williams a nonreader who reviews the episodes on otaku assemble had to say about theon this week that he doesnt understand why theon is in the season if nothing is happening to him except him being tortured its sort of funny that he picked up on that because theon isnt in the third book and these scenes technically dont need to be happening"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-05-07,"nice to see that rans review includes a reference though not by name to his magnificent grand unified conspiracy theory the guct that served as endless fodder for discussion in the very early days of this boards history rans right about the brotherhood without banners i had no problem with combining the edricgendry storylines but the bwb essentially selling gendry really mucks up their code and purpose for existing blech one of the major threads of criticism of the show is the loss of subtlety from the novels and i cant quite figure out if that is necessary evil or not there are so many small hints references etc in the books that are pieced together to form theories and i dont think it is possible to replicate them in the show so you get a rather hamhanded exposition of littlefinger though it is essentially limited to his interactions with varys its certainly annoying for those of us who already knew all this but i really wonder if viewers would be able to pick up on it given the much more limited textexposition inherent in the show as compared to the books is it better to be more obvious or for some viewers to miss out on the importance of the character because they missed the subtleties i think it is something of a tightrope for writers to walk and it seems like theyve decided to err on the side of obviousness rather than viewer confusion i personally can accept that but i also can see why some others cant regardless of the hamhandedness im thinking that the ros scene was perhaps the best in that episode because it manages to shock readers in a way many of us likely havent been shocked since reading the books i watched with a couple of readers and we all sort of simultaneously gasped that is rare in most adaptations when youre familiar to the books i also think it touched on some great themes and hammered them home in a great stylistic counterpoint to the witty banter of tywinqot roosejaime tyrioncersei etc we get that clever dialogue and then the visceral visual shock of pure brutality kind of rams home the iron vist inside the velvet glove of all those pretty words the scene clarified joffreys character so that people did not come to think that he was becoming a nice guy under margaerys influence it points out what a bastard lf really is that varys cares about the realm and people as a whole but not as individuals that the lives of the smallfolk dont matter in the game and overall as a reminder as to how brutal life in westeros can be in that sense it is a perfect setup for the rw and especially the pw and all in one short scene i suppose it also goes back to the point about subtlety the books had more sort of vignettes about joffreys cruelty with shooting peasants torturing animals etc but you just cant put all that stuff in the show for each character without episodes becoming more a recitation of facts rather than a story so they give you joffrey killing ros and the same point is made in a much shorter piece of narrative something is lost but ultimately im not sure they have much of a choice"

"Inevittable",2013-05-12,"im going round in circles on this one which to me indicates that its a problem with the writing more than the characteron the surface it seems daft of sansa to ask if her family is coming to the wedding but then i think about the other weddings of the big houses in westeros and what sansa must know about them yes she has a naively romantic outlook on them but she also knows that when people from two houses get married then it means alliance  her marriage to joffrey was supposed to bring stark and baratheon closer perhaps shes been led to believe or is leading herself to believe that her wedding to loras is the samebut then im fairly sure that she didnt tell herself that her family would be coming to her wedding with joffrey after her father was branded a traitor and the war started so whats so different about her getting married to a tyrell margaery has given her the impression that once shes queen shell let sansa leave kings landing then sansa marries loras in highgarden in this lovely idealised place thats removed from all the political things that go over sansas head shes away from kings landing theres no war in highgarden so maybe her family would be able to take time out from the war to attendas i said circles"

"Inevittable",2013-05-14,"on the character as a whole i think the thing is that she doesnt learn all that quickly but she does learn it doesnt take her long to realise that joffrey is a total toss bag but she also learns that theres very little she can do about it shes not big on strategy but that doesnt make her a total loss that being said the shows not doing a brilliant job of putting that across seeing her crying after she finds out about her impending marriage to tyrion does make her very sympathetic to the tv audience thoughi confess to constantly rolling my eyes at sansa the first time i read got but i eventually got to feel sorry for her and to admire her for her simply surviving all that she hasyes i still think that shes a trifle annoying but then you do have to wonder at the fact that she has survived if we hadnt seen so much from her point of view and saw her completely from others points of view she might seem very different"

"Castellan",2013-05-20,"sansa is disappointing partly because of the actress imo but although i think that actress is not as good as maisie williams i cant see why they dont give her better lines and coach her a bit it seems like theyve just decided she can walk through her scenes her scenes just seem designed to move the plot along and show the dastardly tyrells plotting which is another thing why is loras shown as amazed that a servant can pick up that hes gay when he himself has been with renly presumably since he was a squire now there is unbelievable stupidity on screen i felt that in the first series the sex scenes tended to show renly as someone whose weakness was being exploited by loras now suddenly loras weakness is being exploited by this spy sent to seduce him"
"just another one",2013-05-21,"its not dumbnessi dont get why people come down so hard on characters like sansa or as someone upthread mentioned andrea from the walking dead they are girls in horrific situations who maybe dont have the psychological capacity to deal with all the utter crap going on around them but as human beings we were designed to survive both psychically and mentally through every means necessary when you get a cut your body reacts so that a scab forms and you dont get an infection and die or bleed out how weird and random is that the mind works in the same way when your mind is hurt it will do anything possible to repair itself even if it has to remove you from the situation you are in to protect you from harm this is also how dissosiative identity disorder aka multiple personalities develops your mind will do anything to protect you from mental harm including denialheres an example i daydream all day its not a hobby and its not something i do on purpose but i have to deal with a lot of nasty stuff in my life abusive family depression poverty lack of a future and friends and daydreaming is my minds way of protecting me from all those nasty thingsjust like arya is dealing with her situation by being completely angry at everyone sansa is dealing with hers by disappearing into a world where she can find comfort in the idea or daydream that she can still have a pretty life where there are no monsters and theres no abuse and everything is perfect shes away from her family shes being abused by joffrey shes being manipulated by everyone shes a hostage she watched her father get beheaded and then she was forced to look at her fathers head on a pike she could die any day she has no idea if shell ever even see another sunset and she knows all these things but if she stops and sits down and starts to think about them shell completely collapse so its healthier for her if she just falls in love with the idea of highgarden better days a handsome husband like loras pretty dresses and flowers and yes the thought that maybe just maybe shell see her family again and theyll all be happythat is not stupidity sansa is not stupid nor was andrea people like them are real and theyre not stupid or weak they just have different defense and coping mechanismspersonally i find sansa rather fascinating if i was a therapist id rather have her as a patient than say jon snow most of the other characters are pretty straight forward or seem able to deal with their problems straight on sansa on the other hand i find utterly magnificent in the way she deals with trauma she doesnt become a killer she deals with her traumas by making herself believe that the world around her can still be a fairy tale andrea did the same thing on the walking dead its not stupid it shows a survivalist personality intelligence and extreme creativity its also both fascinating and really sadi love sansa i just wanna give her a big hug and people who call her stupid are maybe stupid themselves because they are completely missing the depth of her characterthisi also think shes might be playing the long game although she may not realise what options she has just yet shes a very young girl who grew up sheltered whose life suddenly got turned upside down in the most horrible way imaginableshe is aware that she comes across as a bit stupid but she also seems to realize that this is something she can use to her advantage at least in the books and it can be think about it if people think youre dumber than you really are they may not be so careful around you which gives you room to manouver and you may also learn things you otherwise wouldnt its like a cloak of invisibility because nobody thinks youre up to anything yet she is planning an escape behind their backs isnt she sansa is a surviver patient and observant in time maybe even morei like this character quite a bit i find her story deep and fascinating"

"Florina Laufeyson",2014-03-30,"the show has sansa blatantly acknowledging how foolish she has been out loud in front of margaery i think this accounts for something we have the character saying it outright in front of us this is showing that sansa understands her failings at least on the show i know a few unsullied including my mum who warmed to her a bit after she said that to marg"

"SeventySeven",2013-05-06,"im not sure which people youre talking about but no one in my group of unsullied is under any illusion that those two have a loving relationship anyone who reads the scene that way wasnt paying attention last weekthis meeting was a meeting of 2 people in similar predicaments trying to find a way out weighing their options cersie didnt admit defeat if anyone is ready to give up its tyrion he said it im fucked cersie to me at least looked like one who hasnt yet given upbib your group of unsullied is probably smarter than my own or has a better attention span winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  but i think ive read something similar in a review as well either way i do think that the cerseityrion relationship comes across differently on screen the sort of understanding they have on the show takes something away from whats at the core of their interaction and the unspoken humanity between them is part of the whitewashing of both in this sense i think the borgias if anyone is familiar with it it proves you can portray that sort of relationship on screen has set up a much better relationship between cesare and juan who have a similar dynamic to cerseityrion its conflicted filled with hatred and competition but defined by family ties and a sense of belonging or wanting to belong which is ultimately extremely tragic in the books we get all of this between cersei and tyrion in the show we get a more acceptable version of it to make them appear more sympathetic while they could be more daring with such good actors and charactersas for cersei not giving in well shes pretty much expecting to be saved at this point while shes all about taking control and she doesnt just fear being out of control she hates itcersei was basically a cartoon villain in the novels so im fine with this i suspect once joffrey dies cersei will slowly descend into madnessi very much disagree with this notion shes a much daring characters in the books in terms of character development and i speak as someone who loves to hate her her faults are what makes her the entertaining character that she is like i said i was fine with softening her too at the start as it was needed to build the character but then you move on cersei is as much a victim as she is an aggressor and with the exception of a few glimpses its not coming acrossshe is very subtly her changing started already in the episode with the battle of blackwater bay and her paranoia has continued to grow since tywins presence in kings landing is also affecting her hes a source of additional frustration and bitterness and his presence makes her even more determined to prove herself i think its safe to say shes headed straight downhill from here and that it will escalate heavily in season fourcersei hasnt had that much space to develop so far this season i think but what opportunities lena has been given she has made use ofi dont have a problem with lena and the acting its the writing that its off were midway through season 3 her conflicts and extreme personality should be more than subtle by now i hope youre right and we do get to this point eventually but so far i havent liked her this season and not in the way im supposed to  love to hate her im just unimpressed"

shes just less extreme about it than in the booksthey will theyve left them all out or nearly as far as i can telltotally get where op is coming from but at the same time call it my projection if you want i dont find lena headeys portrayal of cersei to be too different from my interpretation of her in the books rather i suppose i find myself sympathizing with tv cersei for many of the same reasons that i sympathize with book cersei who ive always seen as a character similar to arya in a lot of ways but forced unwillingly into the role of sansa by her fathers conservatism i always understood that cersei would have preferred the mans role this is spoken to in the books and in the show but unlike arya she was refused a sword an opinion or any sense of control over her future having always viewed cerseis central conflict as being this difficulty reconciling femininity with strength just as arya does i have not been overly concerned with the tv portrayal because i find that it has maintained the often contradictory nature of that internal struggle in fact i would say this season has been very good at showing this particularly the last two or three episodes where you have seen corresponding interactions with olenna and tywinyou see my problem is that i dont sympathise much with cersei and whenever i do it doesnt last for very long and im totally cool with that i dont need to sympathise with a character to enjoy it and cerseis faults are also what makes her a good reading often there are simply no excuses to how horrible she can be and this unapologetic nature to being bad is part of her charm if she wasnt as disturbing as she is she would be the cliche evil queen whos actually not too bad and im so over that sort of character which is what she appears to be in the show grrms writing is so compelling exactly because most his characters are not boringass cliches her conflict in the books is interesting because yes life has been unfair and she is a victim but shes just as much of an aggressor and what makes her so tragic is that theres no way out because she cant see it shes not misunderstood shes deranged and utterly blind i pity her but i dont sympathise in a traditional wayin this season shes too weak and i never saw cersei as weak and defeat not even in her worst moments shes resilient and does not back down ever show cersei does which makes very clichey unfortunatelyas for the lack of agency that as been mentioned i admit to having been bothered about joffrey being credited with the murder of roberts bastards though i have to say that it is more my issue with the character development of joffrey who i feel has been at times too evil season 2 had some choice scenes and then remarkably inconsistent this season regarding the perceived pawning off of the attempt to assassinate tyrion i was given the impression from the episode that it absolutely was cersei who ordered it and that tyrion knew it and cersei knew that he knew it i interpreted it as cersei saying that it was joffrey with tyrion recognizing cersei was lying and continuing in his usual way of berating his sister by saying oh well joffrey shouldnt have done that joffrey should have known that that was a stupid idea is that not a game of implication that they have played on previous occasionsstill would cersei ever let joffrey get any blameas for character interpretation the fact many view her differently isnt surprising and i think it happens with many characters especially when theyre complex still there are certain aspects of cersei that unless you romanticise her as ive seen some people doing should be quite blatant for everyone to see i completely reject the idea that in the books shes cartoonish as some have wrote in this threadi think that cersei and tyrion are more believable characters in the show it is easier for viewers to relate with these characters now and we will be able to sympathize with them more as they spiral out of control in the later seasonsagain why do we need to relate and sympahise with characters to enjoy them did you sympathise with dracula in the books do you sympathise with patrick bateman in american psycho hannibal lecter norman bates annie wilkes ben in lost heisenberg in breaking bad humanising characters to the point of making them weak is lazy writing and takes away much of what makes them interesting to begin withgo rewatch blackwater again and again and again and think about how wrong you arebut that was one of the few times cersei appeared to be the cersei we know not surprisingly iirc that episode was written by grrm headey is totally up for the job it seems that what doesnt allow her to go there is the writing"
"Gannicus",2013-05-07,"you mean they would portray him like his actual character that is part of the point of tyrion while he might be nobler then the rest of his family he is still a lannister and tywins son thus he has inner demons he must face here he doesnt do anything really unlikable and his only flaw seems that he wants to be loved by his fatherlook i know theyve changed him the show is going to be different than book but in truth it works better this way it especially translates better to television as we would not be privy to his inner dialogi dont know that tyrions character has a singular point he a character that the majority of readers rooted for certainly until the end of asos even though we rooted against his house i think dd are doing a great job of generating the same feeling for viewersif they want to make more likable characters why do they seem content to make robb a total douche blackfish a mean spirited bully and jon a total doofus seriously there is no shortage of characters that are likable in asoiaf nor is tyrion completely unlikable even with his dark acts thus there is no need to whitewash tryrion into being neds perfect soni dont really agree what youre saying about those characters either robb youre paying for my sins i wont forget this uncle doesnt seem like a douche but a naive teenager who fell in loveim sorry but there is a need to have viewers be invested in the characters especially with so many of the other favorites being killed thats my biggest problem with boardwalk empire right now is i dont really know who to root foreven in the show tyrion is nothing like ned or any of the other starks he has a good heart but thats about where the similarities stopwe have to accept that the show is not the book and enjoy it for what it is still a great television show"
"Sniraga",2013-05-07,"ive been disliking the whitewashing of tyrion for some time now but in a way it isnt as disturbing as the similarish treatment to cersei like so many others here i liked that the book cersei was constanty trying to do something trying to play the game even though she occasionally overestimated her own abilities andor failed the show cersei what has she done recently expect complain how joffrey is out of her control or moaned about the role and the prospects of the women in westeros dd are reducing her into a less active character just like they have done with catelyn"
"Gannicus",2013-05-07,"you see my problem is that i dont sympathise much with cersei and whenever i do it doesnt last for very long and im totally cool with that i dont need to sympathise with a character to enjoy it and cerseis faults are also what makes her a good reading often there are simply no excuses to how horrible she can be and this unapologetic nature to being bad is part of her charm if she wasnt as disturbing as she is she would be the cliche evil queen whos actually not too bad and im so over that sort of character which is what she appears to be in the show grrms writing is so compelling exactly because most his characters are not boringass cliches her conflict in the books is interesting because yes life has been unfair and she is a victim but shes just as much of an aggressor and what makes her so tragic is that theres no way out because she cant see it shes not misunderstood shes deranged and utterly blind i pity her but i dont sympathise in a traditional wayshe has plenty of time to grow into the evil paranoid queen we see in affc only this way her paranoia will make more sense shell lose it when her father and son are killedwe already saw the conniving woman in season 1 with ned and season 2 with tyrions whoreros shell start to spiral and become the cartoon you want but give it a season or twoin this season shes too weak and i never saw cersei as weak and defeat not even in her worst moments shes resilient and does not back down ever show cersei does which makes very clichey unfortunatelyhow do you mean weak because recognizes joffrey is a rotten seed she always bent to tywin and joffrey but never to tyrion robert or anyone else i think she holds serve in the show the only cliche would be an evil queen driven by a prophesy but she isnt close to inherently good she is still a selfish ambitious and meanagain why do we need to relate and sympahise with characters to enjoy them did you sympathise with dracula in the books do you sympathise with patrick bateman in american psycho hannibal lecter norman bates annie wilkes ben in lost heisenberg in breaking bad humanising characters to the point of making them weak is lazy writing and takes away much of what makes them interesting to begin withyou can enjoy them without sympathizing but i find her humanization more believable and in turn her character more compelling i dont find book cersei at all interesting except to watch the train wreck it would have been much lazy for the writers to create a character as obvious as cersei was a times in affcto be honest i didnt like some of those books shows or movies at all and i didnt like any of them as much as i like agot she hasnt been made weaker imo only more sane"
"Mulled Wino",2013-05-07,"i think far more people root for the show lannisters minus joff at thos point whats not to like theyre pretty much all great people tywins a bit strict but you need to be to rule the 7 kingdoms this ties in with why i dont like her portrayal i love the prophesy i love that book cersei is a haunted paranoid sociopath i dont want her cowed by joff and emotional i have no need for her to be a misunderstood womann acting how anyone would act"
"Mulled Wino",2013-05-07,"the aryacersei comparison makes me throw up in my mouth cersei was mean spirited and almost evil since birth just because they were uncomfortable with their expected roles as women doesnt mean theyre comparable really"
"eyeheartsansa",2013-05-07,"i dont think she is whitewashed at all we still get glimpses of crazy she is pretty horrible in the blackwater episode she was fully prepared to commit suicide and kill tommen as well in the episode that george wrote she mentions the time she had the servant girls hand cut off for stealing she never stole again the way she acted so smugly towards tyrion about marrying sansa and then the look on her face when tywin turned the tables on her that was a beautiful crystallization of the family dynamic and in my opinion very faithful to the books we will see her true colors when joff is killed and when tywin isnt around to constrain her and its going to be some fantastic tv"
"David of Kent",2013-05-07,"cerseis real decline will come when joff is murdered and jaime is back and then gone again as with some other things from the books its just impossible to show too much of her and have her slow descent heavily featured when they have so much to cram in"
"SeventySeven",2013-05-07,"how do you mean weak because recognizes joffrey is a rotten seed she always bent to tywin and joffrey but never to tyrion robert or anyone else i think she holds serve in the show the only cliche would be an evil queen driven by a prophesy but she isnt close to inherently good she is still a selfish ambitious and meani mean weak because theres a huge contrast to the cersei of previous seasons and season 3 cersei who apparently spends her time panicking like a deer caught in headlights wait for jaime to save her and bond with a brother she hates and said hatred is a major plot point for next season come on its like theyve shifted her direction completely theres nothing cliche or cartoonish in allowing a character to have a very black side among the gray in fact its quite daringi think far more people root for the show lannisters minus joff at thos pointwhats not to like theyre pretty much all great people tywins a bit strict but you need to be to rule the 7 kingdoms this its simplified and in cerseis case the softening worked fine when robert was still around it added a lot of very much needed backstory and it was heartbreaking in season 2 they still got it right despite a few hiccups cersei in season 3 is a woobie victim of everyone but no aggressor in this last episode she was even semiworrying about breaking the news to sansa i mean sansa the same sansa she was tormenting about being raped at the end of a battle the same sansa she drags to get married to tyrion in the bookscerseis real decline will come when joff is murdered and jaime is back and then gone again as with some other things from the books its just impossible to show too much of her and have her slow descent heavily featured when they have so much to cram inshes the one sending him away because he annoys her and doesnt do as hes told"

"House Lothston",2013-05-07,"cersei was pretty reasonable in book 1 actually and she actually had a rather good grasp on politics i think she was far from being a good person but she lectured jaime that he didnt have to throw bran out of the window she also knew what ned starks death would mean it was getting worse and worse in every book i think and after joffreys death she was a nutcase not able to comprehend even the most obvious things not to mention that she was simply doing plain evil things as well cant say that i liked this change too much but oh well however i liked the season 3 cersei so far though she had a few great scenes as well she was mocking joffrey at the dinner with the tyrells which was a delight and it was interesting to see her getting a bit intimitated by her own son as well i still think of her as a strong woman because lets face it in front of tywin even the strongest character of the books might look weak and intimitated and i never had the feeling that tyrion and cersei care for each other its just their own misery at the moment which is stoping them from mocking each other edited by house lothston 07 may 2013  1006 am"

"The Fourth Head",2013-05-07,"youre right and yes they could but it doesnt feel as organic she should be slowly sliding into the type of person she becomes by now it doesnt have the same impact if it happens suddenly after joffrey and tywin die shes had no character development at all this season all she seems to do is fret which is very uncerseiyou cant view cercei in a bubble the present circumstances do not allow her to be the ubervillain tywins return to kl has cramped her stylejust as tywin is the only one who can truly dominate tyrion so tywin is the boss of cercei she is no match for tywin lannister and she knows it and most of her season 3 plot so far involves tywin and the effects of his decisions it is easy to empathise with someone beaten and feeling sorry for themselves after being told to marry someone but its exactly how she would have reacted in the books too she felt she was in charge whilst tywin was off in the field when tywin returns to kl and takes up the reins his overbearing presence looms over her again and if daddy says marry someone she does it queen regent or not i thought the scene on the show where tywin puts cercei down for not being able to control joffrey was crucial in underlying the fact that tywin still has the psychological edge over her she needs to ask daddy to bring her child to heel ouch in the books she wasnt allowed to have a say in tyrions trial and it makes perfect sense that her hostility towards the tyrells is kept in check by her fathers desire to maintain the alliancehers is not a gradual descent into villainy that is too simplistic and ignores a crucial family dynamic whilst tywin is around she needs to stay chaste uphold the lannister name and stay off the sauce she can still threaten the likes of littlefinger bitch about sansa and margary or feel smug at tyrions misfortune but she is living under tywins shadow and with skeletons in the closet to boot the fact is we all act differently when we are around other people and an authoritarian overbearing father is a classic example of thisit also helps to explain cerceis arrogant backlash when he is not around as she attempts to fill his shoes all her inherent arrogance bottled up and bruised in tywins presence gets unleashed when he is no longer there she attempts to impose herself excessively recklessly in a hotheaded inexperienced fashion when the opportunity finally comes along its classic bullied turned bully and helps explain more layers to her personality she is a child let looseanother aspect currently is that she is now dealing with a much tougher and more subtle rival than sansa stark one with far more aces up her sleeves with qoft margary joffrey tyrion and tywin all in town she simply doesnt rule the roost whatever she does or says to other people could get back to tywin and as such she has to watch herself that doesnt make cercei any less of a villain nor does it mean that when joffqofttywintyrion clear out she cant revert back to her reckless ways unchecked without people putting it down to a personality shiftits a change in circumstance no more no less and underlined further by the fact that in acok joffrey and tyrion stand up to her whereas in affc there is only a gentle jamie and tommen is naturally more compliant allowing her free reign to do as she wishes due to differing social dynamics not due to her becoming a villain  we all feel sorry for victims for the repressed but that doesnt make them a nice person all of a sudden she demonstrated no remorse or sympathy when confronted by tyrion about the assassination attempt only embarrassment when he narrows down the suspects to her or her son and when she tried being nice to tyrion in the first scene of the series it was a desperately poor effort and only for the purposes of trying to find out if he intended to tell tales on her to fatherno imo cercei is exactly the same person as ever but operating under vastly different circumstances imo she was the same person in got as she is in affc trying to get rid of anyone who stands in her way with nobody cramping her style at all in affc she really gets to show her true colours edited by the fourth head 07 may 2013  0322 pm"

"SerMixalot",2013-05-07,"well this season we have seen her witnessing the tyrells power play and trying to get tywin and joffrey to react to her she is finding that she has no power now or her traditional power base ha been removed she cannot manipulate jofferey as she once did and tywin has always been beyond her power she is trying to exercise power and findng she cant thus her frustration which will lead to her craziness actually as i think of it it is beig done fairly well"

"Zorral",2013-05-09,"cersei in the books and on the screen has never done one clean generous thing for one single person and that includes her children not one good nice or kind thing  or spoken so of anyone she whines about herself endlessly though and because shes never committed one fine act in her whole life we dont care she may be fiercely devoted to her children  her family  but she treats them all badly too and twists and deforms them its too late for joffry but the sooner shes gone the better for her remaining children this is a woman who as she herself suspects should never have been a mother she should have been allowed the scope in the world that a man of her rank would have had  she might have been a better person but then theres that father of hers  and theirs down through the generations cruelty and selfishness rides creating ever more disturbing and twisted individuals"
"RottenAppleFossoway",2013-05-09,"give it time it seems theyre really playing the joffrey rebellion against cersei let future events take place and get cersei to drinking copiously and im sure her true nature will return"
"Golden Lion",2013-05-09,"i dont get why people are up in arms about attributing blame to events when even the books havent been 100 about them im hoping shes sidelined now so she can be a more central character in season 4 once joffrey it out of the way the kl really rests on her and season 5 if it ends where i assume will be overflowing with cersei i dont really see that many bad changes from the books shes such a simple cartoon character in the books im glad shes more 3d and the things getting blamed on joffrey dont make much difference to me because she could be lying which she could reveal later"
"Dove",2013-05-10,"cersei didnt confirm it was joffrey in that scene did she that seemed like tyrion just jumping to conclusions to me unless i missed something i wouldnt call it whitewashing so much as setting up potential motives for tyrion and the pw  first the attempted murder now ros even in the books it was never confirmed one way or another whether she sent the kingsguard after him having joff be responsible for the bastard killing just makes more sense to me its exactly the kind of evil dumb shortsighted thing he would do like mother like son right and since its one of his first official actions in s2 it helps a precident and establish him as not being entirely within his familys control the affc material is really cerseis time to shine like the crazy diamond she is so if theyre still portraying her in the exact same way then as they are now ill probably agree with you on whitewashing until then i think theyre doing a good job at giving us more subtle glimpses at her bitterness and cruelty from time to time whichll make it even more effective when she starts to unravel into fullblown anger and paranoia"
"Cas Stark",2013-05-10,"i actually think they are doing a good job setting up her future arc she has made reference just this season to be the only one of tywins children who paid attention to him and who cares about the lannister legacythis is spot on book cerseiwhat you are seeing this season is a cersei who is thwarted on all sidesby her father by the tyrellsso when she ultimately gets power we will see all of that pent up frustration exercisedthe same as in the book the one thing that may come off as a little unreaslitic because of how theyve shown tyrion and cersei really trucing it up is how totally she turns on him edited by cas stark 10 may 2013  0654 am"

"Janicia",2013-05-10,"cersei wanting tyrion dead during the battle of blackwater made some sense given that he had sort of kidnapped tommen and threatened tommen with beatings and rape in addition to getting her house guard captured as pows sending myrcella away and putting joffrey on the battlefield since tyrion wasnt as threatening on the show cersei had no good motive i think the show is right in giving joffrey more agency and making him more threatening because hes been aged up i like the softer versions of cersei and tyrion better  i dont know if it is better art or whatnot but i like it better i do appreciate the ops argument that softer cersei is weak and robbed of her vitality but all three lannister siblings have been squelched this season under tywins influence varys agreed with tyrions assessment that cersei ordered the execution but he didnt contribute any information i suspect hed have said exactly the same things if tyrion had thought joffrey or lf was behind the attempt edited by janicia 10 may 2013  1039 pm"

"amilas",2013-05-06,"well i still hold to my views though you all have pretty valid arguments i guess it just comes down to our opinions on whether intention in the face or something you cannot control is the same as action in the face of something you can which is really an argument humanity has been having since the dawn of time or maybe i am just interested in a group that begins small to protect people and is slowly influenced by the world around them there is an argument that gendry as a representative of the bwb is corrupted like the group is but as a character judged solely based on his development i just dont see it but ill let it drop because there isnt much more i can say about it frankly he is confined to just a few chapters and it is hard to judge him based on that i just hope that grrm will make him a povthis has been my dream for a few years now"
"Joey Beers",2013-05-06,"gendry standing in for edric and mel talking to arya are weird twists simply because at this point so many things have changed from the book that we dont know where the show is heading i mean we all probably feel that some things will change from the text but the story will basically remain the same yet certain things are starting to unfold in the show that could affect the eventual story by that i mean what hasnt been written yet so either the show knows things that we dont about future events or they are just gonna try to make entertaining television and see how things play out for example capturing gendry could prove to be insignificant if his story dwindles out as it has so far but there are many theories about him returning to prominence if something happens to him now in the show it would put an end to that possibility maybe they dont show him for a while but eventually he returns with mel unless they are stopped in the process in which case what was the point if he does stay with mel then a resolution to his character that is not in the books must happen bah all this is making me wish for a 12 part epic directed by ken burns that is true to the book"

"Ser Wun Wun",2013-05-06,"what mel said to arya could be foreshadowing or it could simply be setting up mel to look like a fool by making a wrong prediction which she does several times in the books like i imagine it could go down like this 1 we get a scene where the kindly man tells arya that if she does not want to continue the fm training that he will find another place for her maybe even book her passage on a ship to a place of her choosing something like this does happen in the books although i dont think the kindly man offers her passage on a ship 2 we are left on a cliffhanger as to whether or not arya has taken the kindly mans offer no more scenes from her for awhile to keep the suspense going 3 mel then tells jon about the girl in grey on a dying horse coming to wall and says that it is his sister because of what mel had said previously this leads the show audience who lets assume were paying attention and remembered to believe that arya accepted the kindly mans offer and is going to jon 4 the twist unfolds alys karstark is revealed the be the girl in grey not arya who has chosen to stay with the fm and continue her training the tv show plays with viewers expectations here the same way grrm does with us in the books if it plays out like the above then its still possible for mel to die in the fallout at the wall like many speculate including myself or im completely wrong and mel will both survive the fallout and 1 become a part of jons retinue and therefore be present when he meets arya again or 2 go someplace in essos after what happens at the wall and serendipitously run into arya im kind of hoping neither of the latter two options happen but i guess well have to wait and see edited by ser wun wun 06 may 2013  0415 am"

"Red Woman",2013-05-06,"i found this scene fascinating because i do think dd are dropping big hints about the ending of the series they know where this is all going and those were not just throwaway lines i know its been mentioned elsewhere in the thread buttthe line that really stuck out to me in mels scene with arya was the green eyes bit who do we know who has green eyes other than the lannisters and who does arya really want to kill i thought it could definitely be foreshadowing that arya will end up killing a lannister cerseis the one on aryas hit list but im not sure if arya will be the valonqar after all still very interesting to think about where they might be going with this i dont think its a red herring it sounded to me like a clue for book readersalso does anyone else think melisandres reaction to beric had more to do with the fact that hed been brought back six times and that she didnt know that was possible before meeting him she seems to know already that the lord of light has the power to resurrect i definitely subscribe to the theory that mel has received the kiss before and is herself undead in fact that very first scene where beric and mel meet and are just sort of looking at each other  to me that looked like two undead people sizing each other up edited by red woman 06 may 2013  1117 pm"

"I'm_Tim",2013-05-06,"i interpreted the scene to say that those are the people that arya will become not kill those are her disguises as a fm she will see through those eyes and then shut them when shes done theyll meet again because they represent the different beliefs fm bring the gift of death the followers of the red god cheat death through resurrection the darkness isnt necessarily a bad thing in this world the darkness is pure while the light is sorcery"
"Red Woman",2013-05-06,"actually having just watched the episode again what surprises melisandre is not that beric has been resurrected but that he has been resurrected six times the fact that she took to the concept of resurrection so casually is quite intriguingas for arya and melisandre if they ever meet again or for the first time if we are referring to the books i think braavos is more likely as the locationi think this lends credence to the theory that melisandre is undead and has herself been resurrected by the kiss of fire before she doesnt seem surprised that its possible because shes had it happen to her the reaction that were seeing is her amazement that someone has been able to do it six times a nondevout priest at that"
"I'm_Tim",2013-05-06,"also ive always thought arya and the faceless men are good and interpret death as a good thing they only give the gift to those that deserve it or ask for it meanwhile milisandre is a manipulator and preys on the weak stannis is weak and vulnerable hes blinded by his thirst for power thoros almost feels guilty for using the lord of lights power and drinks himself to death to deal with it those are just my interpretations from the material obviously we all see it differently"
"Gendels Children",2013-05-06,"its one of the rare scenes that i think tells us some of whats going to happen or not in books 67 clearly gendry wont be playing a role with the bwb having him travel all the to dragonstone and back again would be asinine and he wont trust them anymore but he has to have some role or else it wouldve been easier to introduce edric storm instead of shoehorning mel into the riverlandsthere also wouldve been no point to mels line to arya unless they do somehow meet again so either mel is headed to braavos arya to the wall thatd be my guess or they both meet somewhere elseand the added focus on the red god suggests to me that he or at least the religion will play a major role in the endyes1 very good this is what i was thinking when she said we will meet again very nice it got me all excited xd i think they would be most like to meet at the wall as mel is her strongest there i think she loves the power too much to want to leave until the whole war with the others is over unless some huge drama pushes her away from the wall possible the aftermath of something we have already seen triggered at the was in adwd i cant see her willingly heading some where else like bravos"

"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-05-06,"its really crazy for people to jump to the conclusions that the writers are foreshadowing stuff that hasnt happened in the books yet most viewers will forget that arya and melisandre meet four or five seasons from now like some are suggesting book 6 foreshadowing the show is simply not going to broadcast events that happen that far down the road not yet will they leave the door open sure they skipped every bit of prophecy in the house of undying gohh exactly for the reason that they dont want to george lucas themselves heres some eye colors for you show eddard stark  green eyes show catelyn  blue eyes show the hound brown eyes  did you guys notice samwell mentioning darion this episode leaving the door open for him to make an appearance down the road usually characters mentioned on the show are going to be seen later on"

"Landis",2013-05-07,"the general assumption of the theory was that the baby was not actually stillborn but cersei was not able to confirm whether he was alive or not because he was immediately taken from her i am completely aware of the lacking probability of the theory but as kissedbyfire indicated it was strange that they changed the infertility of robert and cerseis marriage it provided the opportunity to stress the seed is strong as well as establishing the mothertomother connection between cersei and catelyn and offering a more sympathetic initial view of cersei than we have in the books at this stage but it also means that there was a suspicious child that was quickly disposed of which truth be told is the stuff pretenders and long lost prince stories are made of thats a doubleedged sword they put in the fire and i would hardly be surprised if they whip it out to cut the other way eta grammar edited by landis 07 may 2013  0113 am"

"bobbybuilderton",2013-05-07,"if they do ill rush up there and break into the setwell i doubt theyll film in venice croatia is sometimes used as a standin for venice or at least it was in a doctor who episode it was convincing enough if youve never been to italy but they have a bigger budget than doctor who doesnt everyone lol"

"Druze",2013-05-07,"the thing i thought i gathered from the whole thing is that they are giving much more weight to the rhllor last season they put jaqen into the group too so they are building on ice vs fire much and here thoros says it is his love for a friend that brought him back he did not say that in the books so firelovegood and icewalkersbad maybe mellowpng classbbcemoticon altmellow i hope they arent lumping gods together i assumed last season that jaqen mentioned the red god because he was literally rescued from fire so since he believes in basically all gods in one form or another that particular debt needed to be paid to the red god the reason this lumping disturbs me is because there seems to be a conflict with red god folks in how they view the old gods of the north they burn septs in the south too but they use wood which is symbolic of the old gods and weirwood trees to burn and therefore worship the fire god im not sure where the weirwood gods would fit in a narrative lumping fire versus ice"
"The Mondrian Oak",2013-05-07,"well i doubt theyll film in venice croatia is sometimes used as a standin for venice or at least it was in a doctor who episode it was convincing enough if youve never been to italy but they have a bigger budget than doctor who doesnt everyone lolwell being italian i should definitely watch that episode"
"bobbybuilderton",2013-05-07,"well being italian i should definitely watch that episodeits vampires of venice and vincent and the doctor from the 11th doctors first season if you are curious"
"Dark_Sister",2013-05-07,"im not sure they would use venice as a location filming in italy is very expensive i think its the most expensive country in europe to film and getting permits to film in venice is really difficult of course its possible to use venice as the location for braavos it would be awesome but i dont want to get my hopes up on topic i dont know how i feel about this scene i adore arya and im happy just seeing her but at the same time i didnt like her meeting mel the whole we will meet again seems a future book spoiler for me unless they made them see each other before arya goes to braavos something unlikely i think she will go back to dragonstone now that she has gendry why would she stay in the riverlands it might be a reference to the whole aryaalys thing but mel doesnt know who arya is in the scene so i dont understand how they can be talking about that i think the eyes line meant arya is going to kill a lot of people nothing else edited by darksister 07 may 2013  0536 pm"
"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-05-07,"i didnt like her meeting mel the whole we will meet again seems a future book spoiler for me unless they made them see each other before arya goes to braavos something unlikelyfirst off why does melisandre have to be correct that theyll meet again does she control aryas destiny ned stark and benjen stark told jon that theyd talk to him the next time they see him and then one dies and the other is been missing a long timesecond i love how you think that the show is trolling you with information that you think will be future book spoilers ill try and just point out that theres absolutely no way that the show will hint at something that is going to happen five seasons from nowdo you think that benjen stark will return to the wall because he tells jon well speak more when i return"
"Dark_Sister",2013-05-07," i was just giving my opinion about that mel said to arya and im not the only one who thinks that why are you so agressive about it"
"Relic",2013-05-07,"lol this is probably the best analogy ive seen for this phenomenon and perfectly encapsulates what is going on here i will steal this from you in the future if you dont mind hahaits actually not a great analogy at all tons of people have been reading these books for years before the show was even a gleam in hbos palm a better seafood analogy would be thus for years and years you have loved shrimp to the point you knew everything there was to know about shrimp however the shrimp you want wont be in season for another four years to feed your shrimp addiction you start eating fake shrimp meat even tho it tastes like shit and gives you gas at some point you might stop eating fake shrimp meat maybe once your poor guts simply cant handle it anymore in four years you tell yourself ill dine on real shrimp once more you just hope your guts hold out till then edited by relic 07 may 2013  0559 pm"
"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-05-07," i was just giving my opinion about that mel said to arya and im not the only one who thinks that why are you so agressive about itso in your opinion it was a book spoiler i dont think i was being agressive about it maybe a little aggressive i guess im just confused about how everyone is jumping to a conclusion that makes no sense for the show just because obviously melisandre never told arya well meet again in the booksi think the people that are telling people that are worried about future book spoilers to quit watching the show are being aggressive im just trying to simply point out how illogical it is for the show to forshadow something that will happen in season 7 my guess is you should start worrying in a few years if the show is still on the air and winds of winter hasnt come out yet"
"Dark_Sister",2013-05-07,"so in your opinion it was a book spoiler i dont think i was being agressive about it maybe a little aggressive i guess im just confused about how everyone is jumping to a conclusion that makes no sense for the show just because obviously melisandre never told arya well meet again in the booksi think the people that are telling people that are worried about future book spoilers to quit watching the show are being aggressive im just trying to simply point out how illogical it is for the show to forshadow something that will happen in season 7 my guess is you should start worrying in a few years if the show is still on the air and winds of winter hasnt come out yetwell imo you were being agressive and it was not necessary if you dont agree there are other ways to say it i just think it might be a clue it probably isnt but that was the impression i got nothing elseand i didnt say anything about the people who worry about the show spoiling the books or what they should do so i dont see how that should affect my opinion about your answer and i didnt talk about the show getting ahead of the books either because honestly even if it happens i dont care"
"Tulicloure",2013-05-07,"first off why does melisandre have to be correct that theyll meet again does she control aryas destiny ned stark and benjen stark told jon that theyd talk to him the next time they see him and then one dies and the other is been missing a long timesecond i love how you think that the show is trolling you with information that you think will be future book spoilers ill try and just point out that theres absolutely no way that the show will hint at something that is going to happen five seasons from nowdo you think that benjen stark will return to the wall because he tells jon well speak more when i returni agree here that line could mean a lot of things including nothing yes maybe its a spoiler of arya meeting melisandre in future books but it could also be a reference to alys karstark a new tv showonly scene on any season a spoiler of fake arya meeting melisandre or melisandre is just wrong we have been shown countless times how flawed mels interpretations of her visions are and here shes not even looking into the flamesuntil we know for sure what that line means this is as much of a spoiler as saying all men must dieas for the interaction between thoros and mel it really doesnt spoil jons fate any more than the books do red priests do the kiss  say the old words as a funerary ritual so even if melisandre didnt believe it was possible to bring someone back to life with it shell probably do it to jon anyway even thoros did it to beric and mels much more devoted than thoros was back then also were not sure if thats whats really going to happen"

"Weeping Sore",2013-05-08,"i think you are probably crazy and that would be too far of a departure from the books as ramsey is presumably still alive at the end of dance long after his wedding still alive for the coming battle of winterfell against stannis and who would bother hring a fm to kill ramsey to begin with hes not that important his father is still aliveit may be that mel and arya will meet in the next two books and that was a spoiler or it may be that it was just show talk and means nothingi suspect that mel and arya will meet in the books because i think that arya and jon will reuniteit would be a big departure but it really depends on whats going to happen in twow if ramsay is already dead at the end of dance eg the letter is from mance also arya will not be a true fm as she will still act for her own purposes though the iron bank is backing stannis and the show could portray an alliance btn the fm and iron bank so why not kill their guys enemies if she were to find out the boltons role in the rw its conceivable she would let herself be captured to take them out im just looking at the showrunners penchant for reducing characters no edric storm willas tyrell or jeyne poole jon would have the same motivation to leave the wall to stop the wedding theonreek would have the same redemptive impulse to save arya though with her training she would hardly need it obviously ramsay would die before consummating ewwnow if twow has arya doing major stuff in essos right away then throw it out the window"

"bobbybuilderton",2013-05-07,"i just rewatched the dinner scene and looked closer at rooses eyes i didnt quite notice the mismatch between mcelhineys polite words to jaimie and brienne until the last line and his really unsettling eyes when i watched it for the first time in his last line roose threatens jamie fairly bluntly but if you look at his eyes you see that message was there all along  theres a part of roose bolton who would love to humiliate jamie in a very brutal way and his eyes give it away right from the first momentsjust like the captain in how i met your mother so eloquently demonstrated by marshall herehttp25mediatumb8f82jo1500jpg"

"The Fourth Head",2013-05-07,"i think hes always been good theyve never given him enough lines or screen time for him to put together the quiet menace aspect of his character until this episodekeeping a low profile is his mo to allow him the freedom to exploit the starks trust menace is the last thing roose wanted to demonstrate in season 2 particularly when all his scenes were with his liege lord when you have to follow orders you dont have much menace there have been clues throughout though cold long lingering looks at the dead men in harrenhal long looks at talisa and robb the subject of flaying and torture discussed casually but it just doesnt have the same power when he is trying to keep a low profilethe only trick i think they may have missed is to have a good closeup shot of robb with roose filling what little space is left in the background out of focus just staring at robb when the focus of robbs attention was elsewhere like on cat or someone when receiving bad news that could have been nicely creepy if shot just so eyes boring into the back of robbs head"

"Lord_Baelish",2013-05-09,"ok this was easily my favourite episode of the series so far there was just so many awesome scenes its hard to know where to start i thought they did a great job of the climb up the wall at last the wildlings are being given a bit of character and i am warming to ygritte a lot more than i did in the books doesnt hurt that shes a hot redhead i guess jon is getting more of the screentime his character so desperately needs the jaimebrienneroose dinner was brilliant from start to finish although i agree with most that it was way too short with the great chemistry those actors have they could have had a whole episode of it and no one would have complained i particularly liked the fail at dinner line and briennes helping him to cut up his meat without saying a word i am so looking forward to their scenes in the next episode it was good to see littlefinger show he isnt quite as inept at the game as previous episodes made him out to be my friend whos a nonreader was very dismissive of him as a threat until his scene this week i have always been a fan of him and varys every scene with the two of them in it is a scene worth watching i have to agree that the casting for this whole show has been absolutely spot on i love boy and theon jaime and brienne ygritte tywin jorah im a big fan of dance and glen id say the only one they have got really wrong is having ciaran hinds as mance most importantly is it just me or is sansa looking absolutely gorgeous this series"
"Gendels Children",2013-05-09,"this really was such a great episode i cant believe so many people didnt think so its review wasnt what i expected at all but guess you cant please everyone imo this episode was so good its hard to pick which scene was my favourite maybe when some of the ice of the wall fall apart that really was great also i know it sounds bad but i was also happy to see what the decided to do with ros it was sad for her but i kinda wanted her gone maybe not in such a brutal way but still was very well presented and gives another twist to the story for viewers who didnt know there really was no big future for her"

"gnrevolution",2013-06-16,"not sure if this hss been mentioned but does anyone think its possible that lf was not on the boat and is still in kl it gives him a perfect alibi for the pw and lets him still whisk away sansa when the time comes i mean you never actually see him leave and the dialogue with varys gives some foreshadowing to what is to come"
"The Bear",2013-05-06,"i pleasantly surprised that they included a conversation between littlefinger we learned some interesting things that we didnt know from the books perhaps most importantly that varys knows about cat lysa and lfs weakness ive been reading the littlefingervarys comparison threads on the site lately so this topic has been in the front of my mind even before the episode aired in contrast to many of the other episode scenes that strongly diving the show version of the characters from their novel counterparts cersei fretting and commiserating with tyrion qot openly admitting loras is gay loras sudden knowledge of fabric and dressmaking and weddings and so forth in this scene we get confirmation that the characters motives  at least on the surface  are similar or identical to the book  lf tells sansa in the novels to basically make moves that make no sense and cause chaos  varys again insists hes doing what he does for the good of the realm we also find out that the prostitute that was on lfs payroll was given to joff to kill is there anything else we learned from that scene that either confirms character motivation or teaches us something knew i wonder if the show writers tipped us off on littlefingers downfall by having varys openly admit he knows lfs weakness we certainly didnt learn of varys having one"
"Kernest",2013-05-07,"i think you should also consider the line from an earlier episode that varys said to qot that littlefinger would burn the realm if he could be the king of the ashes at the moment id say it seems that his plan seems to be coming into fruition if he receives the backing of the vale lords he wields the strongest army in all of westeros excluding the tyrells whose main force is provided by their vassals of questionable loyalties i for one like to think randyll tarly will turn his cloak just for a chance to crap on mace tyrell at some point but yeah i think the tv show is turning littlefinger into a more human character and we all know that to err is human he seems much more prone to base desires like taking revenge on starks who robbed cat from him edit of course im talking about the situation at the end of adwd with some of my own added speculation drawn from the scenes from the tv show edited by kernest 07 may 2013  0538 am"

"Dr. Pepper",2013-05-07,"perhaps most importantly that varys knows about cat lysa and lfs weaknessi dont think this was something new in the show in the books lf talks rather openly about his relationships with the tully sisters even if we readers know what he says is a lie varys was there when cat arrived in kl and met with baelish tyrion also later told cat that lf has told of having bedded her and lysa it would be rather surprising if varys didnt know about any of this i rather enjoyed that scene i dont think there was anything all that revealing from lf what was surprising and somewhat confusing is that its now the second time show varys has been thwarted by lf both times revelation of lf getting one over on varys occurred in the throne room im still unsure if we are meant to see varys as being not as powerful as he seems to be in the books or if it will later be revealed that varys was just playing with lf and knew he was being watched in the books its set up more to where varys watches all and no one watches varys still arya was able to spy on him quite easily even if unknowingly so maybe thats the book clue we need to show that varys isnt all that"
"The Bear",2013-05-07,"i missed one whole episode 3 and parts of a couple of others because my foxtel cable provider blowing up this season so i have missed some stuff if varys had previously demonstrated knowledge of the catlflysa situation i hadnt seen it or didnt rememberits true that he has been fairly open about cat certainly around sansa and cat herself i just didnt remember it ever having been explicitly stated that varys was aware of it even if its precisely the sort of thing varys would make it his business to knowdr pepper youre absolutely right about it being the second time varys has been thwarted by lf and i cant help but wonder if its quite significant and points to lfs position being stronger than it seems or like you said varys being more fallible than we realised i have always been of the opinion that varys was the stronger player more mystery we dont know his weaknesses or even his backstory no proof of what he ultimately wants other than his words which as they say are wind but the fact that he has been bested twice by lf is very intriguingi like the idea that varys isnt quite as secure as he seems and that he can actually be spied on without realising"
"Lord Varys",2013-05-07,"they obviously wanted to get a sort of closure on the rather weird varyslittlefinger rivalry they established in the show no such thing is actually happening in the books and it makes little sense to have varys put the sansa plot into olennas head in the first place and i dont see how this plan could have helped varys cause ie the aegondaenerys plan or how sansas wellbeing could have affected the good of the realm making the tyrell plot a sort of background for the littlefingervarys rivalry actually diminishes the characters of varys and olenna olenna looks now somewhat dumber since she did not come up with the sansa idea all by herself and varys appears much more clumsier since he could neither protect ros nor keep his involvement in the tyrell a secret from littlefinger i guess it makes sense that littlefinger leaves the capital as the apparent victor in his little sparring games with varys the show has still time to establish the depths of varys game and that game is much deeper than anything littlefinger could cook up in fact littlefinger did pretty much nothing to prevent varys own plans he has no clue about aegon after all the one remarkable thing is that littlefingers feeling of triumph is yet again not only uncharacteristic i dont see varys dropping his facade in front of varys even if he knows that varys knows what he is really up to  a man like littlefinger lives and believes the lie himself he does drop his guard and lets anyone see his true face or emotions but also quite dull in show terms since littlefinger was actually not the one to thwart varys plan but cersei who commanded him to investigate the intentions of the tyrells nothing in the show indicates that littlefinger would have uncovered the tyrell plot on his own"

"Im no Ser",2013-05-06,"i actually take all this to mean that gendrys role in the series isnt very important the show made the choice not to introduce the three children at dragonstone  edric storm shireen and devan  at the same time as they introduced stannis and his court presumably in an effort to keep the number of new castmembers down they now need a kings bastard that mellisandre threatens to burn because davos needs to free him and give stannis a speech about his royal obligations to get stannis up to the wall to defeat mance if gendry can replace edric for that purpose that suggests that whatever narrative purpose gendry was serving in the books as smith for the bwb isnt relevant to any major plot point"

"chimere",2013-05-06,"although i do think him in the books being with the bwb under uncat has some sort of plot point somewhere i cant see how this change means that the only option is gendry will be king in the end i dont see gendry wanting to be king and i definitely dont see stannis legitimizing gendry so that he is first in line for the iron throne i think that the people who think this are only seeing what they want to see"

"Envie",2013-05-06,"i said this in the other thread about the scene with melisandre  gendry  arya  thoros etc but it bears repeating here in the books were left wondering what happens to both edric and gendry both have seemingly disappeared off the radar of importance based on where theyre ending up but i dont think grrm would have included so much about both of them if he didnt intend one or both of them to be future key players in some way too much detail and information is written about them just to be red herring deadend characters in my opinion however in the show we are learning that edric doesnt exist at all based on no casting for him where he would have normally appeared in the story with shireen at dragonstone and that gendrys role is now taking a much more central place in the storyline again the writers of the show likely know endings we dont and therefore chose which of the baratheon bastards to make more prominent than the other or nonexistent im sad that edric doesnt seemingly play any future role based on the show but happy theyve replaced him with gendry which means gendry must somehow play a more important role and not just fabricated for entertainment on the show ill be pretty disappointed if they are in fact fabricating his role and this new story plot without there being any real correlation in the books for his future all that being said i think the hints were pretty strong that gendry is in fact going to be some sort of key player in the story later in parts of the book we havent yet gotten to read im happy about that"

"Envie",2013-05-06,"well heres another tidbit of food for thought because theyve aged all of the kids up quite a bit in the show it makes a lot more sense to have gendry be the key player rather than edric because edric was about the same age as shireen which would make him far too young to play out the part of a future political player at least in the current generations storyline gendry is probably one of roberts oldest children and on the show he looks even older mid twenties so he could in fact be a much more believable political key element than edric"

"Spring Snow",2013-05-04,"its easy for me to say ive liked it so far since ive read the books and thus already know whats going on and theon is a favorite character but i can imagine how confusing it would be for a casual viewer in the books the boltons were telegraphed in advance even before jaimes release as early as acok or even agot if you pay heed to robbs observations from roose in harrenhal to the behavior of ramsay in the north we knew something was wrong far in advance but the red wedding was still an incredibly visceral shock for most people part of what made it so shocking was that we saw the warning signs but ignored or overlooked them out of willful optimism that kind of foreshadowing is very powerful if done well considering we know this story is circular for now and ultimately doesnt really progress beyond theon becoming reek before probably mid to late season four or even season five theyre going to have to come up with something interesting if with they want to feature alfie allen and iwan rheon in six or more episodes a year kyra and the escape attempt lady hornwood something all new it will make the constant misery and torment more watchable if theres some kind of story arc in sight but its going to be a careful balancing act for the writers to keep this part of theons story compelling and not simply repetitive"

"YTDN",2013-05-04,"theon did ask where am i who are you in his first scene this season i think its meant to be a mystery whats going on with theon along with what exactly happened at winterfell part of this seems to be because of the exclusion of the ramsayreek storyline in season 2 in clash ramsay was established as a character with different aims from his father and an outlaw in the north so him burning down winterfell did not immediatly put suspicion on roose bolton here though roose vouches for his bastard and ramsay is given robbs blessing in taking back winterfell so if they revealed him burning winterfell it would make roose a suspect i think they could have executed the sack of winterfell better but i see why they did it if you listen carefully you can already see some suspicion on ramsay since in episode 2 roose reports that when ramsay got to winterfell the ironborn were gone and had burned the place down but we know from season 2 that ramsays forces laid siege to winterfell and it was burnt after the ironborn decided to betray theon and go home"
"Dove",2013-05-04,"all the confusion and disorientation is good for establishing ramsays knack for mind games if nothing else it makes it seem like theyre keeping the core of the character but taking him in a cleverer more psychological direction  he shows the occasional bit of cunning in the books mainly in his identity swap in the second book and his mind games but then its pretty much 100 all dumbass short sighted brute all the timeeven if rheon doesnt match the physical description of ramsay in the books i think the only person who could is a bulky waay uglied up michael pitt or something similar really hes pretty wellequipped to play a manipulative sadist with a short fuseif you listen carefully you can already see some suspicion on ramsay since in episode 2 roose reports that when ramsay got to winterfell the ironborn were gone and had burned the place down but we know from season 2 that ramsays forces laid siege to winterfell and it was burnt after the ironborn decided to betray theon and go homeconflicting with that information luwin namedropped secret tunnels that apparently lead out of winterfell when hes talking to theon about taking the black most of my friends just assumed that the ironborn burned the castle and then fled through there of course they dont seem to realize that theon possibly didnt get the chance to tell his men about the tunnels before he got knocked outi dont know because of all the clues that directly contradict one another i just dont see how someone could be expected to figure it out without book knowledge at this point in time the payoff should be pretty good though once everythings revealed"

"Dove",2013-05-04,"its true that iwan rheon doesnt match the physical description of ramsay hes way too small and too goodlooking but there are a fair number of actors on this show who dont match the physical descriptions in the books whove proven themselves utterly perfect for the roles in my opinion youve got fairishhaired short joe dempsie playing the tall blackhaired burly gendry alfie allen playing darkhaired conventionally handsome theon lean aristocratically handsome iain glen playing plain powerfully built jorah fairhaired gorgeous sean bean playing the darkhaired plain ned stark and of course peter dinklage playing tyrionid probably add michael mcelhatton roose to that list as well he doesnt map on to my image of book roose but im really enjoying him in the rolewhat cracks me up about rheons appearance in the show is that they went the extra mile to give him blackblack hair and didnt really do that for most of the baratheons hahaha either way acting chops are definitely 100 more important than perfectly matching the book description for sure especially if it means possibly getting a more interesting character as a resultrheons prettiness could go a long way in making ramsay a more subtle and insidious kind of villain and having it be even more disturbing when he goes all feral i love the hell out of his weirdass faces another cool thing is that he and mcelhatton actually bear a lot of resemblance to each other edited by chareth cutestory 04 may 2013  0932 am"
"Talbot",2013-05-04,"i like the storyline and hope they drag it for at least the rest of the season im patient with it because i know where its heading and this will establish ramsay as a psychotic bad guy to replace joffrey when he bites it"
"iheartseverus",2013-05-04,"haw basically the series in a nutshellhee save me barryim glad to see what the save me barry thing is all about finally kept seeing it on fanpics and had no clue what people were talking aboutand yes i agree with the following postroose and ramsay do resemble one another could easily be father and son in rel life excellent casting all around"
"go joff go",2013-05-04,"definitely think it would telegraph bolton treachery to reveal him at this point bc like someone metioned roose got a letter from him already and i think the tv viewer would have trouble believing his son deliberately misled him i think it would be better for it to go like the book abd roose after the fact tell us that he did not approve of ramsey action plus it gives roose that great scene in adwd where he sort of says that he almost had no choice but to betray robb bc of things that happened out of his control i loved that scene and think it would be a great scene on tv i think one of the things the show has done better then the book whether one likes the change or not is to set up a motivation for a character to do what they do not to rehash a lot of debates but i think people have latched on to what are some really flimsy book motivations and sort of romanticizing them instead of saying yeah this didnt make sense for me show actions make sense and the ones that done ie starks overall nietivity are pretty much the same bt the two mediums"
"Dove",2013-05-04,"im glad to see what the save me barry thing is all about finally kept seeing it on fanpics and had no clue what people were talking abouthaha yeah i dont browse fanart but the barry thing has to be a reference to iwan rheons character simon from misfits the loudmouth jackass of the group thought simons name was barry for the longest time  demands to be saved once or twice lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol "
"Mammothsbane",2013-05-04,"i think revealing boy as ramsay would give away rw i hope they leave it till episode 10more than likely theyll tie them together spoiler while roose is all jaime lannister sends his regards ramsay will reveal he is ramsay and detail the burning of winterfell for shits and giggles"
"go joff go",2013-05-04,"i think the reveal will be in episode 10 i dont know if its true but i read ramsey is supposed to be in 3 more episodes which makes me think one of them wont be episode nine i feel like they will ramsy will reveal to theon that his father killed robb and in revealing that reveal who he is"
"The Monkey",2013-05-04,"maybe have ramsay snow introduce himself as rooses bastard son but make it clear that his father doesnt agree to everything hes doing lest roose boltons betrayal at the rw loose its shock value maybe have him tell the story of his companion reek and how is father forced him get rid of the dude so he wants theon become the new reek"
"Arrogant Bastard",2013-05-04,"it could be revealed right before the red wedding occurs if they keep the scene of roose presenting catelyn with theons flayed skin very creepy but effective scene maybe it foreshadows his betrayal too much though in the books its known from acok on that roose and ramsay are nasty people and the rw still shocks the hell out of most people plus rooses loyalty to robb will already be in doubt to new viewers when he releases jaime this episode"
"Winter's Prince",2013-05-04,"its not that hard whether your a reader of the books or not to know that it was indeed ramsayboy who burned down winterfell 1 500 men had winterfell surrounded 2 theon had less than ten men 3 there is no way dagmer set the castle ablaze when he expected to walk out and take the deal 5 roose gave robb the news from winterfell in episode two of this season robb then told cat that after the bastard of bolton arrived the castle was already burned and ruin and rickon bran and theon were gone so all evidence points to the boy and im sure that when he does reveal himself hell tell theon that his ironborn friends are dead and one last thing im sure that when roose arrives at the twins to meet robb hell present him with the skin"
"I'll pay the iron price",2013-05-04,"i cant wait to see more of ramsay this next episode looks a cracker"
"Vegeta_Greyjoy",2013-05-04,"yeah i think the ramsay reveal will happen early in ep 9 and while people are wondering wtf i thought the boltons were robbs men you get slammed with the rw hate the casting crazy eyes or not the eyes arent supposed to be crazy theyre supposed to be dead hes supposed to look like the child of beauty  the beast and whats with the sort of breaking down the 4th wall with the happy ending speech who is he sam gamgee edited by vegetagreyjoy 04 may 2013  0355 pm"

"mystikherb",2013-05-04,"i think revealing boy as ramsay would give away rw i hope they leave it till episode 10not necessarily just because roose boltons son is a real bastard doesnt really mean he approves of what his son does in fact the opposite can be said i think they could reveal it now and play it off like his actions are completely his own and has nothing to do with with what roose bolton wants or is trying to achieve"
"go joff go",2013-05-04,"yeah but noone would believe that so i dont think it would work maybe if they didnt have the scene where he gets a letter from his son they could do it but that ship has sailed"
"Pinkie Baelish",2013-05-04,"i think they should reveal that he is the bastard of bolton asap to be honest its not that big of a reveal there has only been a couple of mentions to him and not nearly enough that it would make the audience collectively shit themselves the reveal of who burned winterfell should come towards the end of the season hopefully in the scene right before the red wedding"

"Dove",2013-05-04,"the thing about the bastard reveal is that its a much bigger deal in acok because ramsays deeds had been built up over the course of the entire book  the women lady hornwood creepy ol reek etc but even then a lot of people still forgot or didnt know what happened at the end haha he also seemed like he could be working independently of his father if you did take all that stuff in and remember it though it was a definite oh shit moment after all that buildup and it raised a lot of questions about motivations both his and his fathersin the show weve only had roose vaguely mention a bastard when he vouches for him and we know nothing about himwhat kind of person he is so it seems like thats whats making people think the treachery will be too obvious if hes revealed we only have rooses word and since ramsay hasnt had any other buildup i think a lot will instantly assume hes working with roose since hes a nonentity of a character at this pointmore than likely theyll tie them together spoiler while roose is all jaime lannister sends his regards ramsay will reveal he is ramsay and detail the burning of winterfell for shits and giggles you mean like the scenes occurring simultaneously thats an interesting idea but im not sure i like it at all the rw is such a huge deal i dont really like the idea of interrupting it for such an underwhelming revelatory scene like that i think if theres any cutaways once all hell breaks loose at the twins its really going to reduce the strength of itguess what im the person who its sorta obvious that ive been this whole time muaahahahaha god ramsay chill it w the attention hogging"
"iheartseverus",2013-05-04,"in the show weve only had roose vaguely mention a bastard when he vouches for him and we know nothing about himwhat kind of person he is so it seems like thats whats making people think the treachery will be too obvious if hes revealed we only have rooses word and since ramsay hasnt had any other buildup i think a lot will instantly assume hes working with roose since hes a nonentity of a character at this pointum yes weve all read the books a dozen times or so some of us we get it booksone thing showa different thing got it my point was though that for many nonbookies showonlys the shows prolonnnnnged teasing of  gasp who is torturing theon who could it be lost its lustre some while back the giftwrapped package looks exactly like a bicycle and guess what yep its a bicycle the showrunners have very cleverly and well done in some instances invented bits of dialogue andor bits of scenes to guide viewers toward this or that interpretation and they can do it here as well a few sentences from roose that hes not sure what the hell his bastards up to lately or whatever effectively distances him from ramsays goingson with theon there are any number of ways to reveal what everybody already knows anyway ramsay is torturing theon without foreshadowing rooses involvement with the rw im not trying to be argumentative trulyi dont do that but im seeing that even episode reviewers and the unsullied showonly at twop have reached the now im just annoyed level with the big secret of whos torturing theon time to move along show captain obvious is obvious"

"TomBadgerlock",2013-05-05,"i think they should reveal that he is the bastard of bolton asap to be honest its not that big of a reveal there has only been a couple of mentions to him and not nearly enough that it would make the audience collectively shit themselves the reveal of who burned winterfell should come towards the end of the season hopefully in the scene right before the red weddingdidnt theon admit to burning winterfell down in show canon"
"bobbybuilderton",2013-05-05,"didnt theon admit to burning winterfell down in show canonweeeelll yes and no he said and now ive burned everything down which could be a reference to the saying burned bridges rather than i burned winterfell plus when he was knocked out we saw the bag being put on his head which was removed in his first appearance this seasonso mostly no edited by bobbybuilderton 05 may 2013  1224 pm"

"Tooms",2013-05-05,"revealing him as ramsay isnt too much of a giveaway since robb ordered ramsay to go get theon and to make sure he was alive for robb to deal with himself what they need to keep quiet is the winterfell burningthis when nonreaders ask me who has theon i just point out that they already know from the events in season 2 im like well who was sent to get him its a no brainerbut i like the way the show has done it  grrm loves basically telling you things without openly telling you he wants you to pay attention to put it together yourself so when the reveal comes you partly feel like a fool for not knowing"

"A Bear covered in Fluff",2013-05-05,"its not obvious at all whats going on both my boyfriend and my roommate have no idea whos got theon and why they have him they have theories but its basically the trap boy set for the viewers that a his family has him captured b a rogue group is looking for information about the sack of winterfell or c a group is being paid by his family to get info about what really happened at winterfell neither of which is truth perhaps 2 but even so its far from obvious whats going on which is exactly how theon feels and i dont feel like pointing out what happened last season since we didnt quite get past season 1 before the premiere lol of course after watching all the episodes over again in order its pretty vague but somewhat understandable who has theon however because ramsay has not admitted he has theon makes it all the more intriguing edited by a bear covered in fluff 05 may 2013  0618 pm"

"Typhaon",2013-05-06,"theon did ask where am i who are you in his first scene this season i think its meant to be a mystery whats going on with theon along with what exactly happened at winterfellpart of this seems to be because of the exclusion of the ramsayreek storyline in season 2 in clash ramsay was established as a character with different aims from his father and an outlaw in the north so him burning down winterfell did not immediatly put suspicion on roose bolton here though roose vouches for his bastard and ramsay is given robbs blessing in taking back winterfell so if they revealed him burning winterfell it would make roose a suspect i think they could have executed the sack of winterfell better but i see why they did itif you listen carefully you can already see some suspicion on ramsay since in episode 2 roose reports that when ramsay got to winterfell the ironborn were gone and had burned the place down but we know from season 2 that ramsays forces laid siege to winterfell and it was burnt after the ironborn decided to betray theon and go homethe tv show has given viewers a lot of hints  some nicely hidden and others pretty blatant  that the boltons are up to no good but i think for a while tvonly people just saw roose as some random general of robbs that probably isnt saying or doing anything all that importantif you put 2 and 2 together i think it couldve been figured that the bolton bastard burned winterfell  before season 3 even started i definitely saw nonbook readers that didnt quite understand what happened or thought it didnt make sense but then the whole event was just kind of forgotten as more pressing plotlines developed"

"BreastplateWithNipples",2013-05-06,"i think theyll reveal that the boy is in fact boltons bastard to coincide with the greater significance of roose bolton since this will be the first big scene hes had however i think the reveal of who burned winterfell will be saved for a later episodewhen boy told theon that he was not torrhen karstarks brother the camera zoomed out from their faces and showed the cross on which theon is hanging very prominently that serves no story telling purpose other than to draw the viewers attention in a not very subtle way to the similarity between the torturing cross and the bolton sigils  flags that were already featured so prominently in several episodes of this seasonso i wouldnt expect the reveal to be much of a plot twist at all any more at this point"

"StarkTagaryen",2013-05-06,"im confused by how theyve handled this its the same thing with the burning of winterfell im still not sure if thats even supposed to be a mystery in the show or if were supposed to assume theons men did it or if were not supposed to care or what it wouldnt have been that hard to have bran ask who did this when they emerged from the crypts or for theon to ask who are you usually with the tv show i at least know what theyre trying to do even if i dont think they really pull it off qhorin setting up jon to infiltrate the wildling camp but with the bits around ramsay im not sure what theyre attemptinga kyra escape attempt would likely seem too much repetition but maybe theyll include that anywayi think theyre making an attempt at suspense and this will make the non reader audience more invested in whats going on instead of just revealing everything  im just guessing since ive read the books so nothing on the show is really a mystery plot and character wise so"
"callmedodge",2013-05-06,"awesome scene and absolutely necessary for theons and ramsays proper development onscreen as for those who are saying itll be 3 seasons of torture dont be daft rw is this season so well have moat cailin at some point next season possibly with some more made up scenes establishing the boltons some more and most likely all that winterfell nonsense in season 5 at the most we will have 15 seasons of torture well be getting to the theon at the start of adwd by lateseason 4 at the very latest alfie and iwan are also incredible so ive no problem with getting more screen time with them no matter how much that flaying scene made me squirm"

"Envie",2013-05-06,"i really thought this was the scene where they were going to cut ygritte instead of how she went in the books i have no idea why but i felt like they were trying to rush her out so jon could stop feeling so guilty about breaking his vows or something at any rate im looking forward to how jons going to pay back orell because the murderous look he gave him for cutting them loose was great and we know orell doesnt last anyways"

"Joey Beers",2013-05-06,"so the scene just before the climb when ygritte tells jon she knows he is still a crow was made for tv cheese at first i didnt get why they added that but then i realized that it adds depth and emotion to the relationship between those two that would be fine except it i think they may slack on jons story this season hoping to keep people interested in him because of the whole loveduty thing as a deviation for tv it isnt a terrible change in the story but it does seem a patchwork way to keep jon interesting"
"andrew_",2013-05-06,"yeh some people are nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking it was a great scene from a great show what more do fans of the books want seriously its just getting ridiculous the rope cutting was supposed to add tension the kiss was supposed to play on the emotions of the viewer and it worked i mean someone commented it was too indiana jonesish that is seriously laughable pack up your bags and leave because it is clear you know nothing about how to tell a story on screen"

"Young Nan",2013-05-08,"i agree with jay and tirelei i got the impression from kit that he takes his character seriously and actually enjoys the books he was talking in an interview about reviewing them multiple times before shooting each season which obviously is not mandatory but i think it reflects his commitment that said jon is a melancholy quiet person who sort of has a chip on his shoulder and i think kit nails it like jay said we arent in his head in the series as we are in the books so outwardly all we are seeing is a guy with a somber personality we dont get the insight into his intelligence and motivation as we do in the books"

"Darth Zyroth",2013-05-09,"i had no problems with the kiss yes it was cheesy yes it screamed hollywood but come on people this is television and the show was lacking a good romance after an almost death experience it would make perfect sense for the two lovebirds to share a kiss and the lanscape was beautiful the kiss was perfect televisionwise even i an anti romantic whose heart is made of stone according to my friends felt something with that kiss specially knowing whats coming ygrittes death besides so far in this season ygritte and jon have had what two romantic scenes the cave and the litlle glance of ygritte when she took him to mance thats it i think they needed to add that kiss and more romance to make it more tragic when she dies however i didnt like that jon is more afraid of climbing the wall than ygritte the beautiful thing about jon and ygrittes relationship is that it is pretty even and healthy they both learn from each other at the begining they both are afraid of each others world but then they start realizing that is not that bad wouldnt it have been better to see badass ygritte afraid of something just for once to see jon conforting and reassuring her to see that wildlings are just as afraid of the south of the wall as the people in the south are afraid of the north of the wall i mean shes never even seen the danm wall wildlings hate the wall i would have loved to see that contrast of perspectives that these two worlds have about the wall and i would have loved a mention of the horn of joramun sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  im glad that tormund is finally getting more colorful his little har well it was more a hah but close enough made me sooooo happy but i would like him to tell some stories my other problem is kit i wasnt convinced with him in season one and im still not convinced hes acting is very bad imo"

"Darth Zyroth",2013-05-06,"i dont disagree that this isnt the thread for me im a very upbeat laid back person and i typically focus on the cool stuff that is there than the small stuff that needed to be changed for tvs sake ive read the books twice and ive also listened to roy dotrice on the audio books this is probably my favorite book series of all time i just get that no adaptation can be made without changes and imo theyve done a great job not only keeping almost everything in tact but they also added some much needed drama to certain plot threads that needed them and they also try to throw in easter eggs for the book readers were they can as well also to be honest most of the time reading any thread in this forum is like reading the nitpick thread lol it seems most of the posters here have unrealistic expectationsits good that you only focus in the good i wish i could be a better person but alas im not i on the other hand focus on both bad and good i dont think complaints are that bad i see complaints as things that can be improved someone complained about something so he decided to find a way to make things easier and better someone heard people complaining about something so he decided to make an invention that would help our whole society has improved thanks to complaints if people just focused in the good were conformist and told each other to just deal with it then we would still live in cavesi think theyve done a very good job with the adaptation but we cant deny theyve had mistakes and that some changes werent good its not possible to make a 100 true adaptation but it is possible to make a closer adaptation that what theyve done yes many here have very high expectations but whats wrong with that my father always told me that if i was going to do something i should aspire to do my best otherwise then why botter whats wrong with expecting things to be great has our society sunk so low that we can only aspire to have something good ok or just not terribly bad well the thing is that in those other threads you can tell people that they are complaining too much tell them to stop whining about tiny things and argue that the canges where very good or even better than the book version this is not the place for that"

"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-05-06,"brans asos chapters are pretty weak and boring besides the kotlt story thats gold to a book reader pretty hard to pull off on tv but they still have plenty of time to do it remember that they have to somehow get 2 seasons worth of bran stuff from this book they need to invent some scenes that are actually interesting though being chased by ramsaytheon could provide that considering they both have nothing really to do for now but i doubt theyll do it how about just infodumping westerosi history through him it cant be any more boring than it is now and at least book readers would appreciate it"

"Khal Pono",2013-05-06,"i dont like how renly and loras are being depicted as extremely gay to the point that the thought of being with a woman makes them nervousqueasy the gay men i know think women are beautifuleven sexyand most of them have even had sex with a woman at least once and enjoyed it though its not what they would prefer ive never met a gay man who cringes at the idea of touching a woman i thought the renlymargaery scene was somewhat unrealisticespecially if he was drunk a real mangay or straightwould totally go for it likewise someone as smooth and socially competent as loras should at least be able to pretened he finds sansa desirable"
"Minsc",2013-05-06,"besides when aerys made jaime part of the kg there wasnt a war goin on and there wasnt much tywin could do in loras case the tyrells can just imply theyd join the starks if tywin pushes them on this and he cant do anythingthis really by this time it is the tyrells who are on the rise so i doubt tywin would be idiotic enough to threaten to harm his only major alliance especially when he and kings landing is surrounded by tyrell soldiers and the lannisters are depleted"

"Birdsong65",2013-05-06,"its been since season 2 that i fear i have been waiting for the rw to put catelyn out of my misery she could have should have been so much morethat horse is done good and dead despite the fact that i agree 100they should have at least one catelynedmure scene before the red wedding to show why hes going to be upset by her murder so far theyre acting as if they barely know each otheragreed edmure really has had a rough old time of it this season would be nice if they explored a different aspect of his character instead of perpetually painting him as a disappointment to his family and robb tobias menzies has been greatly underused a scene between edmure and catelyn would be much appreciated at this pointit would seem that the interpretation of tvedmure is that of a glory seeking doofus given the treatment displayed on screen what makes it egregious is that the cannon relationship iirc between edmure and catelyn is that he views her as a surrogate mother last night we see cats single line  fuck you very much you would have us all lose our freedom because you want to hand pick your pretty wife which would have been rather awesome if anyone had bothered to play up the matriarchal position cat holds with edmure not the least because this is now her second son who wants to choose based on love that love predicated on sexual attraction and beauty perhaps her level of anger was meant to suggest this but as all cat scenes governed by dd it was another epic fail seems a shame because with the benefit of reading i understand that cat truly loves edmure very much like a son and treats him much better all around than has been depicted as has bryden and robbat this point catelyn is so far beyond the reservation in depiction im pissed off that they wouldnt just give her the westerosi equivalent of what the fuck is wrong with all of you fucking limp dicks you cant figure out why were losing just everyone fuck off and leave me to my god damned grief assholes jesus my kingdom for a penis so i can win this god damned thing alreadyyou know i didnt read the books until after season one epic fail on my part and ill tell you why after i read them i was so excited to see what was written on the screen and then tptb adapted the books for television and all the nuances i wanted to see are no longer adaptable to time constraints so really they are entirely two different animals which ultimately leaves me with the feeling that had i not read the books hbogot really wouldnt be something i would watch as it is presented in adaptational form its rather geared towards a simpletons mentality i dont mean to offend but there is simply no other way to put it it could have been great but instead its flavor of the month television"

"Cas Stark",2013-05-08,"i agree at this point i have to wonder whether they are just not that bright at least in a literary sense or they think the audience is mainly composed of dunces obviously the fact alone that they have made this milestone in their careers and created a wildly successful tv show would seem to imply that they have some level of intelligence on the other hand they simply dont seem to understand or care about how many details both minor and important affect the internal logic of the narrative when i say narrative im not just talking about the plot of asoiaf but of their own showperhaps they dont even fundamentally understand the source material or they just dont care that much about preserving the logic of the story through the motivations of its characters and think that simply hitting on major events will suffice whether or not it really makes sense in the end if the latter is true they are severely limiting the potential of the show and making it kind of an intellectual insult to nonreadershaving a flippant attitude about characterization and narrative logic doesnt really lead to a higher quality of television and it is kind of antithetical to the spirit of both the books and the show the idea that it isnt the dragons or magical swords but the detailed and complex characters that makes asoiaf so much funthere is nothing wrong with condensing certain plot lines or consolidating characters however they have shown that they simply dont have faith in the audience to understand the story as it is presented and as such they often revert to sloppy broad strokes and trite cliches even where they are unnecessary and detrimental some of the changes they have made just cant be justified from a position of storytelling the only reason they seem to exist is because either bw are a bit dull or they sincerely believe that the audience isive been really disappointed this season im not sure why the quality has dropped if they changed writers or what i know that d  d get a lot of things because for the most part their casting has been fantastic i wasnt too sure about thoros but he is now one of my few favorite parts of this season i know that they can translate the book to the screen and do a good job whether they ad lib or not because i have seen them do it in season 1 and most of season 2so im left confused with a mance who is a grim general and as ive said and others have said really dumb departures that open plot holes and future problems that could easily have been dealt with just from dialogue like keeping willis tyrell off screenor finding a better solution to the kings blood than red dress tramping through the riverlands to steal away gendry it would have been better actually instead of creating a lot of logic flaws if they had just left that part out of the show or had her use magic of some other sort instead of kings bloodrather than taking a powder on stannis inexplicably knowing where and who gendry is and now meeting the real arya stark and not giving a shitshe would be a good hostage for stannis to at this point since robb is alive and fightingthat whole thing from a narrative point makes little sense to the overall ploti have no problem with making changes for tvi understood the theonramseyreek thing would be too complicated to introduce for tv and wasnt really necessary anyway to the main thrust of his arc i understand cutting charactersi dont understand stupid motivations like throwing away half your army for a random chick from volantis who doesnt seem herself to care about being married or not or cat committing treason when she thinks all of her children are alive or so much screen time to whores and yucking it up with bronn and pod instead of more face time for important plot points and characters or silly scenes with osha and meera spatting over skinning rabbits ughbut i dont really have an explanation maybe theyve become overwhelmed by the success of the show and arent paying attention anymorekind of like when jos wheadon stopped writing and directing buffy"

ideaexactlymost of us fell in love with the characters as they were written in the books not dumbed down or thugified or whitewashed as some of them are by the show writers i get the feeling that the directors and writers are having streaks of wouldnt it be cool to have this or that character chat with this character sort of tywinitis or olennavirus  the actors are so good and charismatic that half the cast must interact with them i did enjoy the initial meeting of tywin and arya and his making her his cupbearer but the charm of that relationship rapidly paled when tywin lannister who obsesses over his familys reputation and wants none of them regarded as weak or foolish reveals his heirs childhood reading disability to a servant girl  it made no sense to me and spoiled the scene and a littlefinger who discusses his anger over being wronged by the tullys and brandon stark and desire to fuck them all with the hired help a world of no he just wouldnt do it littlefinger attained power by subtlety not by trying to personally oneup varys in cryptic conversations i suppose we should be grateful that there has been no scene where olenna invites tyrion over to the tyrell bower for tea and enlists him in her tyrell world domination planyet i can thoroughly understand that if youre an hbo agot producer you may not be able to entice charles dance and diana rigg to commit to two or three seasons without promising them more than one scene per season but it would have made more sense for the queen of thorns to interact with margaery or sansa or loras than varys and tywin in the books olenna seemed to try to stay under the radar rather than show her hand openly her walking around on varys arm must have perked up the antennae of every spy in the keep especially those of littlefinger and id have paid good money for at least one scene with tywin putting the direct smackdown on joffrey with one line and a supercilious eyebrow i also worry that after enough little alterations to the actual asoiaf story the plot in the show will resemble the books a whole lot less instead of just a few minor differences the writers opted out of having jeyne poole be a character with more than one scene with no lines or references who is going to be ramseys fake arya the centerpiece of his public hold over winterfell and the goad of reektheons desperate attempt to escape talisa why would anyone care about a stark widow of unknown family at least the way they cared about neds supposed little girl since mance rayder apparently does not have a pregnant wife why will sam and gilly both be sent south of the wall  gilly wouldnt be needed if jon is only trying to save maester aemon im still trying to figure out why ros was needed in the show at all in terms of advancing the plot they got along just fine without her in the books and they totally scrapped the tyriontommenalayayacersei chain of events from acok they hardly needed to show joffrey making prostitutes beat each other to show what a despicable little psycho he isand i tried not to yowl in horror when tvsansa was babbling about inviting her family to her wedding booksansa was not a child prodigy but she was bright enough to keep up a pretty solid shield of courtesy and acquiesence while inwardly observing everything that was going on and looking for ways out of persecution and captivity she even fooled the very perceptive tyrion she wouldnt want her surviving family within 1000 miles of her wedding and potential capture by the crown unless they were coming with an army to kill the lannistersat least daenerys is not disappointing this season far from iti do enjoy the show but it is becoming increasingly episodic and some of those episodes make less and less sense talisa they could have made jeyne westerling older and less naive rather than have a foreign nurse run around unprotected on battlefields and then snag the king in the north the directors and writers are obviously having to creatively stretch and contort to accomodate grrms increasingly large cast of characters and its showing in the books all the different viewpoints cultures perspectives were fascinating because we could see inside their heads or from the heads of people near them but on the show its just vignette after vignette with clever lines and intrigue and minimal action which is why i so enjoyed daenerys going dracarys on the slavemasters with the unsullied and drogon and why im looking forward to some bear pit action on sunday quorin we hardly knew yebut the fellow in the books by that name was epic badass the blackfish might bemoan his nephews foolishness but hes not going to keep threatening to slap around his liegelord even if edmure is an annoying floppyfish hes

"Darth Zyroth",2013-05-08,"who<U+0080><U+0099>s been insulting and offending joffrey don<U+0080><U+0099>t worry my dear joff i<U+0080><U+0099>ve come in your defensejoffrey tried to have bran killed killed ned and you think he wouldnt kill a prostitutewho cares he is who is and thats all that matters some people are just born eviland its not like joffrey had it that rough growing up he was born into royalty ffs there are people that go through waaay worse and dont turn into sadistic monsterswell i dont think it was cerseis influence that made him cut those kittens out of that cat hes pretty much evil by nature as well as by nurturea lot of people had neglectful fathers that alone wont turn you into the evil that joffrey has becomeno joffrey is a born monstertommen had the same fatherdude the cat gutting is a perfect example of pure psycho behavior nothing could have been done to save joffreyactually no he cut the cat open when someone told him there were kittens inside and he wanted to see them when he found them he showed them to his father the emphasis in the story was not on his doing it for his father but because his mind thought it would be interestingthe bran incident is not too different he overhears his father say it would be a mercy for bran to die and again joffreys brain says yeah thats a good idea the implication is that joffrey is psychotic and doesnt need much to undertake gruesome actions spending more time with his father could only lead to trouble since robert is no angel to begin withi believe joffrey is not the <U+0080><U+009C>monster<U+0080><U+009D> everybody claims he is for no reason joff was probably born a little bit mentallyill because of the incest however not everybody that has a mental illness becomes a <U+0080><U+009C>monster<U+0080><U+009D> joffrey<U+0080><U+0099>s upbringing definitely had a big influence and played a big rolewe see that joffrey sees robert as a father figure as a king as an example to follow he says to tywin that his father was the hero of the war and that tywin was a coward the problem is that robert was a terrible king father and husband a bad influence and never paid attention to joff joffrey was constantly seeking robert<U+0080><U+0099>s attention and approval and learned many bad <U+0080><U+009C>habits<U+0080><U+009D> from robertwhen joff was a little kid he killed the cat he killed her because she was pregnant and joff wanted to see the little kittens kids don<U+0080><U+0099>t measure their strength and don<U+0080><U+0099>t understand death the little brother of a friend had a little chicken he gave it a bath and then wrung it you can imagine what happened joff didn<U+0080><U+0099>t know the cat was going to die he just wanted to take the little kittens out to see them then he takes the cat to robert he didn<U+0080><U+0099>t do it for bob but he wanted to show bob what he had done in joff<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes it was an achievement he got the kittens out instead of explaining things to joff what does robert do he beats joff bloody this is probably not the only time that robert ever hit joffcersei is also a terrible mother she on the other hand is always reassuring and spoiling joff she tells him everything he does is right she wants him to be fierce wild reckless and uncontrollable she thinks that is the way a king should be in affc we see that cersei doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t like that tommen is very easy to <U+0080><U+009C>cow<U+0080><U+009D>what happens here is that joff grows up believing everything he does is right and reacting with violence he thinks that if someone disagrees with him then he has to hurt them physically to make them understand an example would be the hitting of sansa and the peasants he shot with his crossbow the peasants where asking for bread and yelling iirc he wanted them to shut up so he reacted with violence to make it happen he shot themthe violence would be something he picked up from robert but is not the only thing many people forget that when the nymeria incident happened joff was drunk he was also heavily drinking in his wedding during sansa<U+0080><U+0099>s wedding with tyrion joffrey tells her that he can have sex with her if he wants joffrey sent the man with the dagger to kill bran after hearing bob saying that it would be a mercy to kill him joff wanted to impress robert joff consciously or unconsciously always seeking for approval had been trying to fulfill robert<U+0080><U+0099>s <U+0080><U+009C>standards<U+0080><U+009D> violence drinking whoring and branin fact if you really think about it joff doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t act without being provoked he always has a reason to do what he does he attacked mycah because he was <U+0080><U+009C>rescuing<U+0080><U+009D> arya sansa and the peasants for defying him he ridiculed tyrion because tyrion did the same to him before he orders ned<U+0080><U+0099>s execution because like he said he is not going let traitors live during his reign and was probably under the influence of petyr it<U+0080><U+0099>s not like if joff wakes up one day and says to himself <U+0080><U+009C>mmm i haven<U+0080><U+0099>t killed anybody with my new crossbow i need to kill someone i<U+0080><U+0099>ll summon the pimp and tell him to bring me one of his whores to try this beauty<U+0080><U+009D>if you<U+0080><U+0099>re wondering then why tommen and myrcella don<U+0080><U+0099>t act the same way well there<U+0080><U+0099>s a difference sinse joff is the crown prince he grew up knowing that some day he will become king he looks at robert to see how he is supposed to act cersei protects him more and molds him to act the way she thinks a king should be also joff grew up with the hound another violent and terrible figure and example to followso i don<U+0080><U+0099>t think joff is a <U+0080><U+009C>monster<U+0080><U+009D> or a <U+0080><U+009C>little piece of shit<U+0080><U+009D> he is just

"Cas Stark",2013-05-12,"my issues wthe show arent really about budget i get that battles and certain scenes have to be trimmed down i get why they didnt have 100 wildlings climbing the wall or have everyone on horseback for the kl riot my problem is more with random and pointless changes that seem like they will cause more problems in the futurelike the new melgendry storyline or loras now being the only tyrell heir or the bf being an illmannered thug i wasnt that bothered by the who stole ma dragons storyline but they could have used last season as long as theyre good with inventing things to give quarth some more screen time to begin to lay the groundwork for danys issues with slavery and the general cultural issues she sees in essos to introduce slavers bay earlierthey could have overall spent less screen time on her segments but still gotten the gist of the story as well as what i see as wasting screen time on silly stuff like pods sexcapades basically the same scene with lf and varys over and over again and ros yes she was a good actress and beautiful but inventing a character who mostly serves no real role except as eye candy while short changing other much more important story lines like the halfhand mance etc doesnt make sense to me"

"sansatyrell",2013-05-06,"honestly i dont care about tyrion being whitewashed except for the fact that there are a lot of morons out there who will think sansas an ungrateful fool or any array of nastier descriptors for being upset about the marriage just because tyrions a nice guy especiall compared to joffrey doesnt mean sansa should be thanking the gods she got paired with himand another thing about this whole plot change  it was littlefingers ship she watched sail away right so what the hell do they plan on doing with sansa down the line because obviously her going with petyr was huge in the books so unless he comes back for her"
"Sniraga",2013-05-06,"i wonder how sansa will behave at the wedding in the books she wasnt very graceful but she was only a child and very much shocked what just had happened she suddenly marrying tyrion instead of a tyrell so i couldnt blame her but having tyrion being considerate enough to actually warn her beforehand sansa cant refuse to kneel down etc without coming across as petulant and spiteful oh well maybe theyll have her acting up anyway so the viewers would feel sorry for their poor tyrion"
"YTDN",2013-05-06,"i think the reason they had him tell her is simply due to trying to drag a plot that lasted what two three chapters in the book over four episodes trying to milk it for all the drama its worth i do like how they framed sansas marriage to loras as her ticket out of kings landing it will help people sympathise with her marriage to tyrion since it traps her permanently in kings landing"

"Versiroth",2013-05-06,"in the book the wedding had to be a surprise because the tyrells couldnt know about it for the show they changed it to where tywin gives the qot a choice of either marrying loras to cersei or naming him into the kingsguard since the qot refuses the marriage loras is named as a kingsguard member and the tyrells plans to marry sansa to him are gone anyway since loras is only tyrell maleheir in the show there was no real need for a secret shotgun wedding once he was removed from the picture"

"KoishNoish",2013-05-06,"im kind of okay with this deviation although i can see the upset by many because assuming tyrion told her they were to married and of course he did then that eliminates the entire sansatyrion convo before and makes it less believable that she would not comply fully with the wedding i think this deviation is not such a problem although tyrion is a fan favorite by many peter dinklage plays it so well i think most people can see and understand why sansa would not fully comply and go through with the wedding i think they can still make this a very powerful affair"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-05-07,"lol yeah technically shes better off because shes not literally running for her life at the moment but she has been reduced to a pawn  like she might as well be an inanimate object with the way people treat herthat makes her still far better off than a great many other people in westeros right one of the recurring themes we see in the books is how the concerns of the nobility over power really pale in terms of human significance when compared to the smallfolk who are starving to deathdying why should we feel any particular compasion for hershes been physically abused nearly raped and has no freedom i hate playing the whos got it worse game because everyones got it pretty freaking awful in different waysthe whos got it worse game is relevant to how people are going to determine who is worthy of great sympathy sure some folks who identify with sansa for some particular reason may feel more for her but to a lot of other folks who will compare her situation to that of her other family members and 90 of westerosi she doesnt have it all that bad so to see her blubbering as lfs ship sales awayeh eyerolling territory for me"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-05-07,"but she doesnt look like a 1314 year old girl she looks around 17 and thats what matters it doesnt matter if hbo website claims shes younger if tyrion says shes just a little girl or even if they mention her age in dialogues she looks olderand she is having a comfy life this season even the guards watching over her are so in the background its not that noticeable that shes a prisoner add that she hasnt been beaten or threatened this season and that her home is burnt to the ground and her stay in kings landing doesnt seem that bad shes definitely in a more comfortable position than her siblings this seasonit would have been great if they have a short scene where shes told about bran and rickon supposed deaths so at least viewers can feel some pity for her or her wishing shed reunite with arya ok that would cause a lot of die hard book fans to complain as well but it would humanize her and put her relationship with her family in contexti believe one thing that really hurts how she is perceived is her relative lack of expressed concern for what is happening to the rest of her family they didnt do her any favors with the naivete of her do you think theyll let my family come question no sansa they wont because they are trying to kill your little batch of traitors but thanks for being more concerned about whether they can be at your wedding than whether theyre actually you know still alive"
"Minsc",2013-05-07,"that makes her still far better off than a great many other people in westeros right one of the recurring themes we see in the books is how the concerns of the nobility over power really pale in terms of human significance when compared to the smallfolk who are starving to deathdying why should we feel any particular compasion for herthe whos got it worse game is relevant to how people are going to determine who is worthy of great sympathy sure some folks who identify with sansa for some particular reason may feel more for her but to a lot of other folks who will compare her situation to that of her other family members and 90 of westerosi she doesnt have it all that bad so to see her blubbering as lfs ship sales awayeh eyerolling territory for meand yet people feel bad for emo jon who despite being raised better then 99 of westeros and is in safer conditions then all of his siblings when he continues to whine about how he didnt get to sit a big table or how catelyn didnt love him"
"lostinwesteros",2013-05-07,"yeah this scene bothered me a lot as had been mentioned by other posters it was bizarre  to me that they had tyrion tell her in the first placethat she was given advance warningthat he went on and told her with shae in the room please he could have insisted on being alone with sansa though i read another poster who said they thought this was a set up for shaes jealousy to be built up to the point where shed later testify against tyrionat any rate its much more appropriate to have cercei just waltz up and spring it on her en route to the altar so to speak more characteristic of cercei more pain and unfairness to sansa as the whole thing was bothnonetheless the whole marriage prospect ensures that sansa will indeed sail away with lf however its officially engineered"

"greensleeves",2013-05-07,"yeah i sense and have already seen a lot of nice guy syndrome coming regarding tyrion and sansas behavior towards him so tired of it agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  its super disgusting ive also seen a lot of derision towards sansa for being excited by the loras marriage but truthfully that was a relatively good option for her she had reason to hope for it instead people have just been calling her an idiot it seems like theyve forgotten about sansas position as a prisonerthey have completely cut out the fact she was beaten relentlessly and had to deal with cersei until the bbw and was spoken to by no one and treated like a pariah unable to mourn her father and surrounded by spies seriously they have mucked up her character and whole arcedit unless we have got it wrong and the scene was tyrion telling her about bran and rickons deaths something we didnt see in the books which would have been a good change for the showyes sansas trials are much less apparent in the show or even absent i like her friendship with shae but it does take away from her complete social isolationi think its pretty clear that tyrion was telling her about their engagement the looks with shae the conversation with cersei immediately beforehand and sansas longing look at littlefingers boat are all evidence of itthe whos got it worse game is relevant to how people are going to determine who is worthy of great sympathy sure some folks who identify with sansa for some particular reason may feel more for her but to a lot of other folks who will compare her situation to that of her other family members and 90 of westerosi she doesnt have it all that bad so to see her blubbering as lfs ship sales awayeh eyerolling territory for mei think that this is one reason why editing out that scene takes away from sansas arc in the books the scene between sansa and cersei emphasizes sansas continued ill will towards the lannisters thus also reinforcing her loyalty to her own family as well as her powerlessness it also clearly shows that sansa is being put in a position where she is expected to be repeatedly rapedwith the scene cut its easier to overlook"
"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-05-07,"and another thing about this whole plot change  it was littlefingers ship she watched sail away right so what the hell do they plan on doing with sansa down the line because obviously her going with petyr was huge in the books so unless he comes back for herwhich means if he comes back for her it will be exactly what he did in the booksexcept it looks like he will actually go to the vale before coming back absolutely not a problem for lf and his tardissince the qot refuses the marriage loras is named as a kingsguard member and the tyrells plans to marry sansa to him are gone anyway since loras is only tyrell maleheir in the show there was no real need for a secret shotgun wedding once he was removed from the picturethe qots didnt refuse the marriage she refused to let tywin name loras to the kingsguard and accepted the marriage proposali think youre getting really confused the show made loras the oldest male tyrell theyve left the door open for him to have younger brothers even with tywins comment tywin still considers jaime his oldest son and heir even though hes in the kingsguard and he just gave the queen of thorns that speech unreliable narrator possibly though he does seem to think that loras doesnt have any younger brothersthat is probably confusing because everyone knows from the books that loras does in fact join the kingsguard so im not sure how that part will play out since on the show hes supposedly the only heir to highgarden which i object to the changewe know he has a sister apparently tywin doesnt think he has any younger brothers so hes not the only heir to highgardeni agree that it is a little confusing right now as to why loras still isnt in the kg the only explanation i can think of at this point is that while the qot has accepted the match loras still hasnt theres not much he can do about it loras has to marry and have childrenit does seem interesting that in this same episode we get a line from edmure saying that no man can be forced to marry against his will or something along those lineshe brings up the laws of gods and men basically since edmure is lord of riverrun theres no one that can force him to marry anyone im not so sure that lords cant arrange marriages for their younger brothers and sisters sansajoffrey arranged by their fathers aryaemmond frey arranged by robbacting lord of winterfellned was still alive at this point and walder freyagain also not sure about the rules once a man comes of age they probably get the choice of marriage assuming they havent already been betrothed by their fatherlord etc perhaps when loras is presented with the offerthreat he chooses the kg rather than cersei that would imho anyway be in line with his character afterallagain kg is not the nights watch its not something he can just voluntarily join to get out of his marriage cersei is the mother of someone that can name a member to the kingsguard thoughi disagree reintroducing dontos to sansa as a potential way to help her escape and her subsequently trusting him could be passed off easily as an example of her increasing sense of desperation to escape kings landing and the lannisters she wants to escape she needs to escape and her trusting a drunk fool is an example of just how desperate she is to try to do thatwell just have to see how it plays out there was a theory that ros would help sansa escape and im pretty sure that theory died in this weeks episode i suppose it could be shae but how she got warned about lf and now ros is dead would probably not make her trust lfi think dantos might make a comebacki think talisa will take fake aryas parttalisa has no claim to winterfell unless shes bearing robbs childbut on an other topicall who say sansa could be seen as ungratefull whatsoever i think she was told in the show so we can get a scene with her where it is explained her thoughts out of the book they cant show otherwise can be shown so the viewers can understand her feeling and why the marriage is so horrible for her at the moment agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree maybe cersei convinces joffrey to draw up the order for loras to join the kg that would be a nice f you to both her father and the tyrells agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree agree totally about the whitewashing of both tyrion and cersei gone are the days when i could look upon cersei as a real villain now i just see a childish spoiled rich girl looking to her father to solve everything and not at all fit to control that monster she calls her soni dont think cersei doesnt become a true villian until after her fathers deathand the way they make tyrion out to be so noble and chivalrous i hope they at least show one scene with him where he admits that he thinks favourably on the prospect of ruling winterfell but i doubt theyll make him say anything that selfish because hey who cares if it shows hes an actual human being and not some perfect hero out of the stories who just happens to be a dwarf its like theyre taking all the grey out of two richly defined characterstyrion and his father have already both explained that sansa has an old name shes heir to winterfell etc i think tyrion will have to explain that hes going to go through with the marriage in order to escape kl and possibly rule winterfell the question is will shae be happy to go to winterfell with her lionwhy dont they realize that part of grrms genius is that he can write complex notcompletelyheroic characters that we love to read aboutdo you realize that theres nothing to read on this show except subtitles of darthaki and valyrianeven if people hate cersei that just shows that her character generates enough of a strong reaction to produce that amount of hate normal complete monster types of characters like joffrey or gregor clegane could never produce that amount of hate theyre just not interesting enough so why on earth are they adding to joffreys atrocities just to try and downplay cerseis craziness we already know hes a monster giving him more screentime is not necessary to point that outif i had to guess it might be so they can show how the loss of her family changes her to a much darker character we dont get a cersei pov until feast for crows"

"BurningCandle",2013-05-09,"yeah the distinction between an arranged marriage and a forced marriage that ive seen on several boards is so slight as to be meaningless regardless of what we call it all of these marriages come with pressure to accept that is essentially irresistible the difference between sansas situation and the ordinary one like that her mother faced is that sansa is being ordered to marry by people she despises who hold her prisoner while catelyn was ordered to marry by someone who she loved and trusted in reality catelyn could not say no either perhaps lord tully wouldnt have had her carried to the sept but the practical pressure was enormousexactly what im thinking thanksthis is not directed at you but your post is a decent enough entre for a rantit bugs the hell out of me when people decide to apply 21st century standards of morality to judge the morality of characters in asoiaf and then bring that perspective into general thread discussions it really amounts to the same argument being repeated endlessly yes we all know westeros doesnt treat women right or many men for that matter that there is horrible oppression by the wealthier classes etc etc etc we all get that and virtually every scene and character relationship can be analyzed or discussed on that basis but it again just amounts to the exact same argument if folks want a sexism in westeros discussion or class oppression in westeros discussion then those are certainly valid topics on their own but for some folks to drag that in to every thread as if the rest of us need to be educated and which inevitably results in virtually every character being deplorable becaused theyre all acting in accordance with that morality is pointless worse it leads to endlessly circular tangential discussions that derail actual discussions of the seriesbooks as presentednewsflash  tyrion is not a 21st century feminist nor is sansai agree with you i am very tired of it but at the same time it just seems to become the basis for so much discussion that it seems there is little to be done about itfirst of all there is no need for your spoiler tags theres spoiler in the thread title were clearly discussing the books and youve kept lots of things that would be spoilers for show watchers out of spoiler tags including the fact that they get married at all thats why ive been removing them they are annoying to click ontyrion lannister lord protector of winterfell the prospect gave him a queer chilli want her he realized i want winterfell yes but i want her as well child or woman or whatever she is i want to comfort her i want to hear her laugh i want her to come to me willingly to bring me her joys and her sorrows and her lustthese are just quotes i found with a quick looki was keeping lancel in spoiler tags because i thought there was still a chance it would be a major plot point and ive had people complain about it at me inside spoiler threads before but very well ill leave them out the fact sansa  tyrion get married is pretty well established to be a foregone conclusion thats why i didnt bother with thatas for this passage yes he considers it i am not debating that i am saying he doesnt seem to covet it the way you suggest he thinks of it he considers it and then he acts in blatant contradiction to those desires in fact this passage suggests that he hopes she will come to love him this passage shows he hopes at least in part for her happinesswhen you said that you dont think he minimizes the damage to her i think you are wrong he openly tells jofferey were to stuff his bedding ceremony and then when he is threatened makes a joke at his own expense to divert attention because he doesnt want her to suffer through this he climbs on the back of a fool to put his cloak on her instead of demanding she bow to him like a slavei am not saying his motives are 100 pure and angelic im saying hes trying to be a decent person to her and spare her griefcat and neds marriage was arranged but they also consented to it its not mutually exclusive presumably all sexual acts within their marriage were also consensualwe are not going to agree on this because i still see this as conjecture but my own opinion is also based on conjecture to me the fact that she was promised first to brandon and then married his brother proves that she was sold just like cersei whether or not she found the guy likable after the fact is imo besides the pointnote that she says no to the marriage only to be told that she will be beaten and forced to comply if she doesnt go through with it sansas obeying here not out of some cultural indoctrination but because she is being physically threatenedhe ends up not benefiting at all though he does attempt i think twice to use northern lands as bargaining chips now hes got a big target on his back by everyone who wants to use sansa for her claim this is why earlier in the thread i called marrying sansa one of tyrions greatest blundersshe said no to cersei yes cersei told her shed be dragged kicking and screaming yes that doesnt mean that she had to lie there meekly and take whatever he did she could have fought anyway my point is shes been taught her entire life to surrender shes a woman and in that society she might as well be just a maidenhead because that is all shes good for in their societysurely the fact that he felt as though hed been slapped implies that on some level he had expected or at the very least hoped to consumate the marriage at some pointyes it does but hoping that one day she would like him enough to allow him to do so instead of forcing himself on her is my whole point he hopes he does not takeno tywin and kevan suggested it first tyrion calls everything a farce hes a very sarcastic guy who likes making fun of just about everything part of why hes so well liked nevertheless he chose to go through with ittywin and kevan suggest it to tyrion they give tyrion a choice not sansa all tyrion had to do was say nothing to sansa the fact that he brought it up at all proves that he was trying to give her a little control spare her a little sorrowat any rate i think im getting off topic my whole original point was that i dont believe in this instance that they whitewashed the character for the show i think this is in line with his personality at this time in the books now in dance of dragons

girl had been an abused prisoner for over year subject to frequent beatings and then is offered she thinks the prospect of marrying the handsome knight shed had a crush in a marriage that she had good reason to believe would remove her from captivity and abuse frankly id have been jumping for joy too when sansa was told that the prospective bridegroom was not loras but his crippled brother she very quickly evaluated the situation in light of the change instead of bewailing the prospect of the loras match snatched away from her sansas decision to take the chance of escape via a kind and gentle though crippled bridegroom was rather mature instead of thinking how unlucky she was to only get a physically damaged husband she thought of making her future husband love hersam was not 12 years old when his father forced him to take the black there is a huge gulf in maturity between 13 and 15 or 16 i also recall jon snow being rather selfpitying his first weeks at the wall thinking how wronged he was to have been deceived by his uncle and father as to the reality of the nights watchthe only time that sansa curled up in a ball and cried was immediately after seeing her father decapitated she did wallow in selfpity then but she was also quite genuinely unhappy and with very good reason and after that when she very bravely defied joffrey she was beaten unlike arya or jon in their new situations sansa was alone with no one to help her or advise her except for the hound whose loyalty was sworn to sansas enemies not her another time she suffered a breakdown though much shorter in duration was during the nightmare and panic attack caused by her first menstruation given that sansa had observed the riot and been attacked during it and her knowing the personal consequences of menstruation getting to marry joffrey and have his children oh joy her horror was understandable especially since she had kept her emotions on such a tight leash for months i dont have asos handy and cant remember how much time sansa spent while anticipating the tyrell marriage thinking about dressmakers but considering that picking out the right clothes thinking of colors and tailoring and decoration is something a bride does and sansa was a willing bride at the time i dont see why she should be criticized for it sansa had always been into fashion and sewing it was part of her she would probably always notice such things at different parts of her life even when stressed and in kings landing her wardrobe what she wore and how she did her hair and makeup had become part of her armor i remember reading on one occasion after she had been beaten sansa very calmly orders her maids to get powdermakeup to hide the bruise and selects a gown that she knows joffrey likes thinking that the choice of the dress may mollify joffrey into treating her better for the moment sansa is not skilled with a sword or a martial artist nor can she at that time sexually seduce people she was picking her weapons among what she had and could use with the knowledge that she had as far as the criticism of sansa for being excited about the tyrell marriage when the tyrells were allied with the lannistersi dont think there was anyone in the palace who was not allied with the lannisters or serving them sansa knew that but as far as she knew the tyrells had chosen perhaps because they were powerful enough to reach out to her and take her away from lannister control and from what sansa had observed being under their control was preferable to being joffreys whipping girl and future unwilling mistress her options were not very good at the time  wait for robb to come save her wait a long time as she had been strike out alone into the streets of kings landing where she had nearly been rapedkilled and lollys stokeworth had been gangraped  that is if sansa could have escaped her guards wait on the usually drunk ser dontos to spring her which sansa was getting increasingly skeptical about or grasp the lifeline that the tyrells had offered by taking a chance on marriage to the tyrell heir actually id find the adventures of an immature and relatively selfcentered 13 year old and what she thinks about dresses interesting when its the adventures of an immature and relatively selfcentered 13yearold and what she thinks about dresses while taken hostage and abused by her familys enemies  more or at least just as interesting as would be the adventures of a brave mature selfsufficient warrior princess taken hostage by her familys enemies i find the idea of this extremely naive pampered and sheltered child suddenly becoming both persona non grata and a brutalized captive to be fascinating  i would want to know how she copes how she survives does she grow stronger and more aware of the realities of life that is a huge part of the appeal of sansas story for me sansa at age 12 is a lot more like i was than arya at 12 minus sansas interest in embroidery and fashion my interest and skill in those topics was never very strong in terms of sansas naivete and love of legendsromances and what i liked about sansas arc is that she does slowly toughen up she does recognize that stories are just stories and that most people want to use her rather than genuinely help her but she does keep some of her ideals and at least some compassion as well as hone her observational skills she is still a pawn but most characters and real people under the age of 14 are pawns if sansa still has no agency or has taken no steps without littlefingers guidance by the time she is 20 then i will be more disappointed by her arc but for now i find the bookcharacter fascinating and far more realistic than arya"

"HopeForSpring",2013-05-10,"im not sure that that top quote actually is mine so i cant address it except to actually agree with you i think it makes total sense that she doesnt trust tyrion he wasnt as horrible to her as others but he is a lannister and i agree that i dont see what people thought she would have gotten out of revealing herself to the lords declarent we know how shifty lf is and that he ruined her tyrell engagement but from her point of view he is the only person that has delivered on getting her out of kings landing i personally dont blame her for having a learning curve and i think in the tv series did such a terrible bait and switch on her that the tv viewers wont hate her for not being totally gaga over the marriage and for the second point that goes into that which one is the bigger victim path that i dont think all that interesting i think it is really easy to go titfortat with all the protagonists povers as to who westeros has wronged the most what i do think is by looking at the similarities in their story we can start to suss out what grrm worldview is and therefore try to make feeble prediction about where the heck this story is going i think the linking of these characters is pretty amazingly thought provoking and shouldnt be addressed with horror by superfans of either unless you want to talk about that in terms of fatherhood in westeros  what that means what makes a good father are you better off being the child of a noble both in blood and behavior father or not but i think that is a different thread"

"Ser Bonham of Eire",2013-05-08,"one line in particular struck me in this episode and it linked up with something i noticed a few episodes back and that was concerning boy knowing that the stark children are alive it was mentioned once before under the dreadfort before ramsays semi reveal and in this episode he said wouldnt that be a hunt to remember i think it is now very possible that those two storylines could come together with ramsay and theon heading of north to hunt down bran and co this would flesh out brans story for next season perhaps and give a reason for including theon this early brans story is very stale at the moment and needs something to change to give it life i think this could be it it might also lead to the splitting of rickon and osha and bran and the reeds what does anyone think i think if it was done it wouldnt be the worst move as it wouldnt change anything dramatic but might provide theon with a redemptive moment when he saves them or something thoughts"
"Pinkie Baelish",2013-05-10,"im glad someone agrees i posted in a few other threads about the idea that ramsay hunts for the stark boys given that the boltons need the stark heirs dead to solidify their claim to winterfell it also gives bran and rickon a reason to split up and adds a sense of dread and urgency to brans arc plus it makes ramsay even more sinister without having to add more torture scenes if they do this and then reveal his identity at the same time as the red wedding the reveal of his identity can potentially be rewarding rather than an afterthought"
"Nezzer",2013-05-11,"its a great idea but i dont think theres enough time for that bran is arriving at the nightfort in episode 10 already and ramsay and theon are said to be in only two more episodes probably 7 and 10 i hope thats not true so we could have the hunt in episode 8 or 9 as well as a ramsaytheon scene in episode 10 to wrap the season"
"Dove",2013-05-11,"i dont know if theyll do it but i wish they would it would be an easy way to build ramsay further as a bad dude without having more potentially repetitive theon scenes the sight of him and his girls off on a hunt would cement him as memorable pretty quicklyive seen a few people bring up distance as in it would strain credulity if ramsay catches up to them too quickly since theyve been traveling for a while  that shouldnt be too big of a factor they and grrm at times honestly play fastandloose with travel timesdistance all the time and bran and co are moving a lot slower than a mounted hunting party anywaythen again we know it would be an interprise doomed to failure since we already know where bran and rickons at by adwd so it might give ramsay kind of a darkstar effect if his first notable action besides torturing a guy is failing to capture a group of childrenone crippled one under the age of tena wildlinghodor"

"King Tommen",2013-04-30,"the sansatyrion wedding is not a surprise tyrion was told about it in e5 for crying out loud why would they try and fool anyone as to what episode it takes place in that makes absolutely no sense youre right in saying that they are going to try and downplay the rw but youre still going to see a line about in the e9 synopsis it will assuredly be something very nondescript like robb and catleyn arrive at the twins to meet the freys or robb and catelyn attend edmures wedding but theyre not going to outright lie about what happens in the synopsis the e8 synopsis says in black and white that kings landing hosts a wedding that means there will be a wedding in kings landing in that episode you can twist yourself in knots to try and find a way to say that this doesnt refer to tyrion and sansa but there is no other valid option really we already got confirmation as far back as last fall on wicnet who are always 100 with their reports that the tyrionsansa wedding would be taking place in e8 they certainly could have moved scenes back or forward an episode or two but the tyrionsansa wedding is not just one scene youd be cannibalizing a good part of an episode to move it out of there and any faint hope that it could still happen was put to rest when they released the synopsis that says it in no uncertain terms i appreciate you have a theory because of an episode title but its not based on anything other than that perhaps if part of your theory hinges on the fact that the producers may have filmed a bunch of fake scenes for an event thats theyre not trying to keep a secret is a good indication that the theory isnt really solid"
"LordStoneheart",2013-04-30,"always 100 that seems a bit unlikely but maybe i dont visit the site a lotand i still insist that a synopis does not have to be true to what might happen more than likely it will but is there a reason we should take it to be completely true with no question they have already been secretive with the boy character five episodes in and still no official confirmation even though fans figured it out long before they want to keep things secret why cant this include lying with a synopsis or fake scenes for leaksstuff like that isnt exactly unheard of in television dallas did it and the simpsons did it though i guess that doesnt count since they were parodying when dallas did itim just saying why not be skepitcal of the synopsis or why just assume theyre truei do really want all three weddings to be this season im starting to lean more towards pw in s4 but im open to all evidence ive read almost all of it and i dont think theres a good conclusive answer yet"
"King Tommen",2013-04-30,"putting aside everything else there has never in the history of the show over the course of 25 seasons been an episode that has not had every single line of the synopsis take place in the episode it has described so what you are suggesting would be something they would never have done before and it would be done so as to blatantly lie about which episode an event that everyone knows about will occur i have no idea why they would go to so much trouble in order to make people think an event which is not a surprise is going to happen in one episode if they were putting it in another episode i dont know what the ramsay plotline has to do with this debate of course theyre being secretive about it its a secret that they dont want revealed until closer to the rw thats why any description official or unofficial of iwan rheon is purposely vague tyrion marrying sansa is not a secret theyve already revealed its happening to the audience in the last episode so there is absolutely no need for subterfuge and if you want to believe that the pw is happening this season you can do so although i think youre going to be severely disappointed on that count as well whether sansa or tyrion get married in e7 or e8 doesnt really impact that speculation i would think the very real fact that the rw is in e9 is probably your biggest impediment to having this theory be borne out sansatyrions episode placement is fairly irrelevant in comparison are you suggesting theyre putting the rw in e8 because that would be outright insanity edited by king tommen 30 april 2013  1157 pm"

"King Tommen",2013-05-01,"well the wicnet report was back in august or september when s3 was being filmed so im fairly certain the episode name changes that took place a few weeks ago were not because of that what happens when they are in the final editing stages and putting together the completed episodes is that they may feel like they have to shuffle a scene here and there to a different episode for timing or flow or whatever what it appears happened for e7 which is the episode grrm wrote is that they altered the title three times before settling on the bear and the maiden fair grrm gave away the whole thing when he announced at that time on his blog that he lost a title but he gained a bear he used lots of exclamation points indicating his excitement level this was an indication that they had moved the bear pit scene to his episode and hence the title change i will say that even in the cases where a change like this has occurred the synopses have changed as well to be accurate for example they must have moved aryas first scenes with the bwb from the 1st episode to the 2nd the original synopses for the first five episodes came out a few weeks ahead of the start of the season and for e1 one of the parts stated arya meets the brotherhood without banners then a couple weeks before the season started after some changes had been made the synopses came out again with the same description moved to e2 which is when we first saw arya appear edited by king tommen 01 may 2013  1229 am"

"SpringIsTotallyOnTheWay",2013-05-06,"besides oberyn they also need to build tyrion and sansas relationship and the increase in hostilities between tyrion and joffrey so there simply isnt time for the pw to happen this season i think e9 will leave a cliffhanger with the end of the rw and e10 will be the aftermath and allowing the audience to grieve i think the end scene will be uncat because i think the show will show thoros and beric reviving her whereas that happened off the page in the book especially since they focused so much on reviving in this episode"
"The Mighty Conch",2013-05-06,"except the queen of thorns doesnt reject the offeri was close enoughthe important thing i got right was that tywin threatened to put loras in the kg so the question will be now will he ever enter the kg in the show"

"Dove",2013-05-07,"thats definitely it dudes been tortured slung up on a cross has had no sleep no water probably no food for days weeks hes not exactly gonna be on the ball i doubt anyone would be also i think theyre probably frontloading the scenes of torture and abuse so it really instills in viewers that this is theons life now constant pain and misery that way they can either go relatively dark on this storyline next season and give theon maybe 12 scenes tops before hes relevant again but hell still be in peoples minds because theyll remember these early glimpses into his fuckedup treatment or write new material like the failed kyra escape or what have you surely the writers realize that even the most horrific imagery loses its impact if it becomes repetitive"
"bobbybuilderton",2013-05-07,"you know i realized that we might be jumping to conclusions about theon figuring it out maybe hell figure it out next episode and holds on to some weird hope that he will be let go if he guesses right so he says he figured out who he is he says youre boltons bastard and he goes insane and decides hes going to castrate him kind of similar thinking to the reason jon couldnt have sex with ros but way more twisted he hates bastards or something and theon is well known for his debauchery so he decides to flay him there or something worse basically its possible that after having time to think about it theon realizes who is holding him you could even have him admit that his father sent him to take winterfell back from theon 1tv only viewers may not believe him because hes lied before 2it makes bolton even more ambiguous because hes giving away jaime but hes sending brienne back but his son has theon but hes not giving theon to robb does he know his son has theon etc etc where do his loyalties lie"

"Nebmai",2013-05-10,"they are doing a great job with this storyline so fareverything up to this episode was showing the boltons to be remorseless masters of subterfuge willing to do anything to achieve their goals before this episode the torture and then fake escape was setting up a situation where theon trusted a person he should not of trusted a ruthless but functional spy game of course unsullied viewers havent fully made this connection and i bet the full reveal of ramsey wont be until the rw itselfthis episode shows the darker side of ramsey and roose who knows these things about his son yet empowers him and names him his heir where he has taken all he needs from theon and then he proceeds to take more to amuse himself theon has outlived his usefulness and if the boltons were really dastardly efficient they would bury him in an unmarked grave an be done with it but ramsey is a sick sonofagun and he and house bolton are starting to become the villians for the upcoming seasons of the show just like they are in the booksif they continue to show lots of theon torture then maybe d  d are trying to make something for shock value but up to now they are showing the boltons ruthless spycraft and then also their sadism all following the books very close just not leaving theon a mystery for 3 or 4 seasons that then need a bunch of flashbacks or narratives to show what happened during the gap edited by nebmai 10 may 2013  0555 am"

"Montey14",2013-05-05,"i mean he could have poisoned me and no one would have been the wiser way to go tyrion just give them all the ideas they needcersei pretty much disqualified the notion of having him killed by saying nothing would happen as long as their father was in town"

"Darkstar of Dayne",2013-05-05,"the reason it had to be cersei is because jeoffrey is too arrogant and foolish to believe tyrion can be a threat to himthus he would never have him killedcercei had the whole whole turn your dreams to ashes scense with him and had her daughter shipped to dorneit was definately a conclusion that it was cersei who gave the orderjoffrey was not above trying to kill bran by an assassinthe point of this scene was to show that joffrey is willing to kill people that he doesnt like bran tyrion and he goes about it with stupidity  if he had simply poisoned bran its highly likely that nobody would know exactly who gave the orders despite catelyn having her suspicions about the lannisters also its ironic because the tyrells are extremely cunning and careful and use poison to kill joffrey which is the opposite of what he would do"

"No true knight",2013-05-05,"i thought that the show had already made this fairly explicit check out the blackwater episode again before running away joffrey tells mandon moore to represent the king on the battlefield moore nods and they both glance at tyrion at the time i thought that the showrunners were doing this in order to take advantage of an older joffrey than the book joffrey older joffrey gets to be a little more ruthless and cognizant of his power so just like they moved the order to kill roberts bastards from cersei to joffrey it looks like they also made joffrey the one to put a hit out on tyrion in fact joffrey only leaves the battle because he gets cold feet but he was looking forward to spilling blood it seems like joffreys original plan might have been to do in his uncle himself with moore providing backup support if things got hectic"

"All-for-Joffrey",2013-05-06,"in cerseis povs she never once recalls or thinks about trying to have tyrion killed during the blackwater despite her constant dwellings on him if she had tried to have him killed in the books martin would have resolved the mystery by making a reference to it during her povs i made a thread about this years ago before the show came out because its intriguing and i was afraid martin may have forgotten it as a plot hole and the consensus in that thread seemed to be that it was joffrey with some debate as to littlefinger suggested it or not im partial to the lf pulled the strings aspect of it but many people will point out that lf was gone in the reach for half the book so he would have had to arrange it very far in advance i think the show just confirmed a lot of what we already deduced in the book the only difference is that they made tyrion figure it out unlike in the books when he mistakenly believes it was cersei this does give him a motive for the purple wedding but the show viewers still have to see the mystery of who killed bran solved im assuming tyrion will figure it out before the wedding and tell joffrey same as in the books which also gives him a motive"

weapons robert baratheon was a man of careless generosity and would have given his son any dagger he wanted    but tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it robert had come to winterfell with a long tail of knights and retainers a huge wheelhouse and a baggage train no doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king<U+0080><U+0099>s weapons went with him in case he should desire any of themthe blade joff chose was nice and plain no goldwork no jewels in the hilt no silver inlay on the blade king robert never wore it had likely forgotten he owned it yet the valyrian steel was

"Blind Beth the Cat Lady",2013-05-06,"i am a book reader i love the books and i think that what the show did to ros was not only shocking and saddening but also kind of crossed a line for me i personally liked ros a lot but even if you didnt i hope you agree with the following in the books important characters are treated with a certain amount of respect usually not by other characters and certainly not by fate or circumstances but by the narrative random peasants have their own motivations and backstories raving misogynists have their own rationale for why they act the way they do the reason we so often say that there are no good guys and no bad guys is because of this narrative respect for characters which allows them to be 3dimensional in that same vein some characters who reach a certain critical mass of evil actions run into consequences down the road i see this as narrative respect for their victims and important characters with a certain degree of goodness may die but their deaths are handled in a respectful way that doesnt mean their deaths are clean or painless but the way their deaths are told to us does have an artistry and classiness to it ned dies in a horrible way but the way its written about and filmed gives due attention i think the same can be said for jory sansas septa the old bear and many other characters that have died in the show not so much for ros sure shes not in the book but she is in the show quite a lot shes fairly developed as a character and unless you just carry a lot of irrational rage against every character who isnt in the books i think shes pretty sympathetic but she dies 1 offscreen 2 after being tortured 3 at the hands of joff 4 after already being abused by lanisters previously 5 after varys said hed protect her 6 without him varys having a clue that it was happening i think the offscreen part is really the killer for me did i particularly want to see more torture after the theon bit not really but i didnt want someone as important as ros to be killed so horribly off screen i dont think thats respectful to her character it makes me really really angry this actually makes me angrier than talisas presence and thats saying a lot my interest level in the show just went down because if dd can make a misstep that huge im terrified of what theyll do in the future i understand that characters die violently unfairly in a lot of pain all the time on the show thats not my problem in fact i think lf finding out ros and disposing of her makes perfect narrative sense but i think it was handled atrociously as if ros was just some whore who didnt matter at all"

"JFleet",2013-05-06,"i realize there have been similar posts in the threads on theonboy scenes but i havent seen much commentary on the subject so i thought i would start a new thread i realize they are saving the official reveal of boy as ramsay snow till sometime close to the red wedding for dramatic effect but at this point isnt it all but obvious im obviously biased as a book reader but the evidence of bolton treachery seems to be jumping right out at the viewer id imagine any astute unsullied tv viewer would have come to the conclusion by now  the most obvious piece of evidence is the cross that theon is being tortured on it is literally the sigil of house bolton couple that with the increased prominence of the bolton sigil this season and it seems pretty clear where he is  we know from last season the episode where robb meets talisa that roose bolton condones flaying despite it being explicitly outlawed and there have been multiple references about his bastard going to winterfell that along with theon literally being flayed before our eyes is a big hint  this most recent episode showed that roose bolton is willing to let jaime go instead of turn him over to robb stark this is clear evidence that he is turning on robb and should not be trusted read dont believe his statements from earlier this season that his bastard got to winterfell but didnt find theon  last seasons ending to the winterfell arc was confusing to be sure but wasnt it clear that winterfell was under siege by northmen and less clear that dagmer knocked theon out to turn him over and save the rest of the ironborn given that the only person we know to have been sent to lay siege to winterfell is boltons bastard shouldnt we assume that theon was captured by bolton men  there was also the rather humorous but slightly less obvious hint of the horn in the most recent episode forgive me if this has already been discussed but im a first time poster let me know what your unsullied friends think about boltons actions and the identity of theons torturers edited by jfleet 13 may 2013  1200 am"

"Khal-a-bunga",2013-04-30,"it sure will be polliver and other guys arya and sandor will meet in the inn  polliver still has needle  i guess we will see arya and the hound make their way to the twins during episode 7 and 9 maybe cut her out of episode 8 then maybe maybe show her in episode 10 if they want to reassure the watchers that she is alivethen i would wager the inn scene to be around episode 3 or 4 of season 4her departure to braavos in episode 7 of season 4her arrival there in episode 9 of season 4this is very unlikely a lot of people seem to have the idea that the show will simply plow forward into the affc  adwd material next season and totally ignore all semblance of dramatic structure in a narrative id be willing to bet that nearly every established character besides bran and brienne will end next season approximately where they did in asos the endings provided in that book are nearly perfect for ending a season of television and wont be discarded if that means that certain characters have to have their arcs supplemented with original material or material transposed from either an earlier book or a later book so be it its not as if there isnt  by and large  enough story remaining in asos to mostly fill out a very satisfying season of television and in addition to that material there will also be the chronologically relevant material from affc in season four the kingsmoot in particular im still not sure to what extent the dornish characters will be introduced next season i believe theyll end up saving sunspear for the fifth season and will have arianna at least accompany oberyn to kings landing however and logistically it doesnt really make sense to push forward in such a way either take your example with arya would it really be worthwhile to spend the money to have someone design and partially build a set real andor digital for braavos when that location will only appear in one or two episodes of the season it would make more sense to end her story with her decision to leave westeros and at the most ending with a far shot of the city while arya is still on the boati think theyll take their time with the remaining events of asos for the most part theyve got to realize what a challenge adapting the two latest books into one maybe two seasons of quality television is going to be so why would they complicate their job further by abandoning predetermined beginnings and endings for their characters again roughly especially when those endings are so damned good"

"Farrellus",2013-05-01,"i dont think they will show roose letting jaime go just yet because i think they are trying to hide rooses eventual betrayal as a major surprise for episode 9 or at least keep it hidden for a couple more episodes thats also the reason theyve hidden the identify of ramsey as theons torturer because it might tip the viewers off that the boltons are doing shady things behind robbs back maybe roose will send jamie off with some of his men and qyburn and it will look like they are taking jaime to riverrun but instead are going to kings landing but since the bear pit fight seems intended for episode 7 jaime probably wont leave harrenhal till then since it would make sense to have his departure and return to save brienne occur in the same episode with arya i think she will just be travelling with the brotherhood as they head towards riverrun to ransom her off to robb probably see some of the devastation the war has wrought on the common folk"

"Dove",2013-05-04,"i dont think its hate necessarily  theres a lot of good stuff in books 4 and 5 theres just a lot more filler as wella lot of new characters and plots are introduced things dont progress quite as quickly and its also the point where a lot of storylines become even more separated and splintered ie brienne and jaime splitting into their own journeys tyrion departing kings landing sansa leaving for her own location etcwith people already complaining about bloat too many characters in different places and scenes skipping too quickly its pretty understandable to see the need for some editing and alteration in the future edited by chareth cutestory 04 may 2013  1247 am"
