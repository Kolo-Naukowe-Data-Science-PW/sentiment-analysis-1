1	Ran	2014-04-27	Non-spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who've not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion, taking each episode as it comes.
This topic should open automatically when the show begins airing.
2	AryaSansa	2014-04-28	Great episode!Â  I like the part with Margery's grandmother, and finding out she was part of the plot with Little Finger!
Â 
My guess is Little Finger kills who he's going to marry, then hits on Sansa.Â Â  Afterwards, Hound and Arya meet up with Sansa, then the Hound kills Little Finger for Sansa and marries Sansa.
Â 
Stannis will march on the wall, then punish Locke by cutting off his hand, like Locke did with Jaime.Â  Eventually Jaime and Locke will fight each other, both with one hand each.Â  Stannis is pretty evil, so maybe he'll imprison Jon Snow because he was Robb Stark's brother.Â  Maybe have Jon Snow burned to death (Jon will eventually come out alive, because he's too important of a character - no one else seems important up North)
Â 
Bran will escape somehow, too early for him to die.Â  If he dies, his whole storyline will be a waste.Â  Also, that little boy will shoot Ygritte and kill her for revenge.
Â 
Margery will marry Tommen, but Cersei will eventually find out and punish her.Â  Or perhaps Margery will get Tommen to execute Cersei first.Â  But Tywin is still in control... so there will be a power struggle between Margery and Tywin.Â  I expect Tywin to lose, and possibly die.
Â 
As for Danaerys, I don't really care too much about their plot, it's taking forever to reach Westeros!Â  I hope that Gray Worm and the translator hook up though, they seem to be such a cute couple 
Â 
Also, I expect Jaime to fight for Tyrion as his champion at his trial.Â  But Tywin and Cersei won't let him, so Tyrion will probably need to find a new champion - maybe the Dornish guy who likes to have sex a lot?Â  I hope the Dornish guy dies, all he does is have sex, he's getting annoying.Â  Hope Jaime dies for raping Cersei too, among other despicable deeds - like killling his nephew, trying to kill Bran, and injuring Ned Stark.Â  Maybe Cersei will have him executed.Â Â  Or maybe the horny dude, Oberyn, will be Cersei's champion, while Jaime will be Tyrion's, and Jaime will die to Oberyn.
Â 
The rape at Craster's Keep was a bit much, but the best part of Game of Thrones is it's realism.Â  Rape, incest and misogyny were very common in European culture throughout history, even today.
Â 
Can't wait for next episode!

Â 
I particularly enjoy its neo-realistic depiction of dragons & white walkers.

Â 
i dont believe that possible, Jaime is not left handed, he can't fight. I believe the only chance Tyrion has is to run awayÂ

Â 
Well, AryaSansa did say the BEST parts were the realistic ones.Â  Which, is an opinion I can appreciate.

Except that Gray Worm has no cock so I hope he's good at other things
8	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	Bit harsh on modern Europe...
9	The brown snake	2014-04-29	No dragons, no greyjoys, no Martells, but Pod was preety awesome. it was good to find out once for all who killed Joffery
10	AryaSansa	2014-04-29	Â

Â 
To me, realism in a fantasy show is less about science, but more about consistency in the rules of the universe, and the character motivations. 
Â 
Â 


Â 
i dont believe that possible, Jaime is not left handed, he can't fight. I believe the only chance Tyrion has is to run awayÂ 


Â 
True, but why else would they devote so much time to Jaime's sword-training, unless he is to fight someone later on?Â  Â Â  It seems odd that the Lannisters were so forgiving of Jaime's hand being cut off - I would have expected them to seek retribution.Â Â  Another possible plotline could be Locke's journey to redemption and make him into a good guy - slim chance, but it would be cool to see him change into a good person by being around Jon Snow.Â  Maybe Jon Snow saves his life?

i believe Jaime would fight, but not for Tyrion, Cersei would do anything to kill Tyrion and probably use a humungus knight or something like that, and Jaime can bearly fight Bronn, it would take him years to learn, Tyrion has like a month tops (besides in the trailer of the season there's a fight between the prince Oberyn and some enourmous guy, my guess is the mountain, maybe that's Tyrion's trial)
The training of Jaime is all about he's ashamed he can't do the only thing he was good at, fighting.
I don't believe there's any redemption from Locke, it's quite clear that guy is some manipulative sadistic asshole, he would do anything to bring the Stark boys to the Bolton's keep.

Â 
Oh that would be a good fight.Â  Finally somthing for Oberyn to do besides have sex.Â Â Â  I wonder why Tommen doesn't just pardon Tyrion?Â  Or at least talk to him... they should at least show Tommen being denied by Cersei.Â  Tyrion is a popular character, so I doubt he'll die - Sean Bean died, but the shock value of execution is gone now, so his chances of survival will be higher.
Â 
Maybe Locke becomes a spy for Bolton when he can't kill Bran.Â  Bran will definitely make it out alive or else his whole storyline will be a waste.
Â 
I still think Jaime will fight with his left again.Â  Seems like such a waste of a storyline... Jaime loses a fight, almost dies, but uses a dirty trick taught by Bronn to save himself and kill his opponent Â  I wish he didn't give his sword away though, what will he use now?Â Â  Maybe he can use Joffrey's sword?
Â 
Would have been nice to see Margary let Tommen touch her exposed breast, just to show that there's no social boundary she's won't cross to achieve her goal.Â  Margary feels too wholesome now, would be nice to give her a dark side.
13	Thrones123	2014-04-30	In King's Landing:
Â 
You can tell that Jaime and Cersei are not as close as they used to be, even more so after the rape. Â Weird to see Jaime do many things the opposite of what she wanted him to do:
Â 
she wanted him to kill tyrion : he goes and talks to him, believes he didn't kill joffery, seems like he wants to help him somehow and tells him he wont kill him
she wants Sansa to be killed: he sends of brienne(with his sword) and pod to go and protect sansa
Â 
seems like there is now way tyrion survives the whole ordeal but just got a feeling he prolly will,
Â 
at the wall
Â 
jon seems to be getting respect from the fellow nights watch, except for the higher ups who still dont seem to like them, they think they are sending him to his death but sure jon will be able to pull it out, i guess locke isn't a highborn/noble if no one is able to recognize him? pretty fancy coincidence that he was set by bolton to kill bran and rickon and bran just happens to be going the place where him and jon are heading? why would he volunteer for the mission north of the wall if he was sent to kill bran? he has no clue they are north of the wall, is he just going to try and kill jon? no news from the wildlings they have to be getting closer
Â 
Mereen
no big surprise dany is able to take over the city, feel like she is starting to bite off more than she can chew, only a matter of time before the slaves start acting up, is this the last city she takes over before she heads west?
Â 
no sign of theon or ramsey, guess they are still on mission to take over whatever castle it was that bolton said, also no sign of theon's sister this season, as she is still supposed to be on the way to save theon,
Â 
little finger still has something up his sleeve for sansa, no way he is doing it just to do it, unless the martells told him they wanted her safe which is possible
14	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-30	I liked the swirly Valerian steel in Oathkeeper, didnt notice it in Joffrey's sword.
Â 
I also liked Dany's new hair-do, those Meereenese know how to do a nice braid.

Â 
Didn't Locke overhear Jon talking to Sam about Bran? Even if he didn't hear anything, he's probably sticking close to Jon in order to find out if he's hiding his brothers somewhere.

Â 
yeah i think he at least showed up in the room when they were talking/ at the end of when they were talking so he might of overheard something, any chance you think locke turns good? maybe if he's north of the wall and they run into a white walker and realizes the potential danger the whole realm is in he sides with jon
17	MockingbirdSpider	2014-05-01	This is episode had some insanely good scenes, and unfortunately some rather cheesy ones. What I would particularly like to comment on is Dany's storyline. Whenever she's on screen I feel a bit bored, and that usually never is the case when GoT is on TV. To me, her scenes are definitely the weakest part of an otherwise outstanding season 04 that is shaping up to be the best of this show so far.
Â 
While Dany's storyline was easily one of the most fascinating ones back when the show started, it has become less and less interesting to me throughout season 3 and season 4 so far. I find it somewhat repetitive to see her free one slave city after another. While it was rather epic when she killed Kraznys, freed Astapor and acquired the army of Unsullied the rest of the slave cities were pretty stereotypical and the scenes in which she freed them somewhat anticlimactic. "Kill The Masters", written in a language that the slaves apparently don't even speak - I mean seriously... The problem with Dany's storyline is that, although I'm sure what she's doing now - getting armies, watching as her dragons grow stronger with every day - will have major implications in the future, it's so detached from what's going on in Westeros. All the other storylines seem interwoven at least to a certain extent, but Dany's is almost like an entirely separate story. I think it's time she heads to Westeros. I don't necessarily expect her to actually get there anytime soon, but I've had enough of slave cities, friendzoned Mr. Mormont and smooth-talking Dario. Her storyline needs a new twist, a new direction. She also needs to experience some major setback - a dragon could get ill, one of her counselors (Mormont maybe?) dies etc., something upsetting. So far it's been all smooth sailing for her ever since she left Qarth.Â

Â 
From the way I read that scene, is that she had every intention of doing that, if needed, but after talking to him for a couple of minutes realized she wouldn't have to in order to get Tommen on her side.

Â 
Dany needs Khal Drogo 
Â 
Khal Drogo is the #1 hottest guy on Game of Thrones! 
Â 
I agree with the Dany storyline though - pretty formulaic and boring.
20	Thrones123	2014-05-02	i think dany will start seeing some opposition over the next couple of episodes, think she is starting to outkick her coverage, she will/should have trouble controlling however many slaves it is, 2 cities worth 200,000?ish think she has too much power comparative to what she actually does, her armies and generals for lack of a better term do all the work
21	Eire	2014-06-24	SPOILERS
Hello my name is Eire, and I am new here. I have read GOT 1-4 and have started on book 5.
I wanted to post on this topic to write about the white walkers, and my opinion on seeing them in a kingdom after picking up the baby.
This is just me speculating, so bear with me, and not everyone has to agree:
Rather than have a white walker kingdom with a king and so on I always thought the white walkers were something more primitive. The white walkers are NOT human, anatomically they have humanoid features(except their exterior integumentay system) , but they are not humans. While the show may want to make them have a king, city, and palace is up to the show and G.R. martin,( and that is okay) but I think it is comparing them too much to the other houses of Westeros.
I always thought that the whitewalkers were more primitive in nature and acted similar in some ways to a tribe or a pack. Maybe they do not have an alpha , beta omega, gamma , or zeta like a wolf pack does, but psychology wise they lack fear , mercy, and bliss that makes a human. Instead for the others these emotions are replaced with insticts that weigh heavily on dominance , and submissiveness. An example of this episode was the first season of the first episode when they let that guy go because he submitted. The white walkers understand/or sense that humans are different in their way of thinking , and so they exploit it , by acting on their fear.
Tell me what you think please, I welcome all comments. I love the whitewalkersÂ  they are mysterious, and evil, - and I love it. I liked the entire episode and everything that we learned about the whitewalkers from it. Until I saw a kingdom , and a ruler- like they can have a god and a king, but I hope the show/books remembers they are not humans, and not to make them too general, and less mysterious, otherwise everything would feel very anticlamatic
Â
22	Ran	2014-04-06	Have at it!
23	averde	2014-04-27	This was my favorite episode so far this season, like come on Ser Pounce was in it! In all seriousness though pretty good episode with a lot of interesting material that I'm happy to have on the show that tied in nicely with the books. The whole Others thing at end was... Interesting I guess I'm not sure how I feel about it. Horse guy potentially coldhands?
24	Jabronius Maximus	2014-04-27	Hmm I'm really not liking where the Bran story I'd going. It seems as though they altered it to make him seem relevant, but that might come back to bite them. Either that or it ends up being a small detour as Ghost and Summer free them. Still, not a fan of it. 
Decent episode otherwise. And Craster's sons...become Others. I wasn't expecting to find that out from the show.
25	Widows_Blood	2014-04-27	I lost my shit at Ser Pouce. Seriously laughed like a schoolgirl. Everything north was amazing. Even if it did deviate from the books. Jon knowing about Bran. Those mutineers need to get got.Â
26	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-27	- Daenerys "evil" moment was rushed. Like a visit to the ass doctor. Something that it  so evident D&D dont want to do.... I belive it was shorter than all Stannis evil moments. Even the last one.
- Dont like the butterfly effect of Bran and Jon story. 
- Book spoiler area grows bigger and bigger....now we know were WW come from.
- Older Tommen cast switches a childish lovely character to one likely gay or dumb.
- Cartoonish evil guys in Crasters.
Its a 4.

28	Turncloak_	2014-04-27	Book readers were spoiled for the first time. Dammit George finish the books!
29	Prince_of_ice_and_fire	2014-04-27	Best episode of 4th season to me. Brienne and Pod seem to have a nice chemistry. Little finger being awesome telling Sansa about his plot to murder Joff using the Tyrell's motto Growing strong. They changed Bran's part and nothing to complain, that was pretty nice and I have the felling that they might still introduce coldhands. I didn't like Jon knowing about Bran's whereabouts tho, that was the only thing Sam didn't blurt out to everyone in the books. And now everybody knows what the WW do with Craster's baby, I never thought that they would have some kind of WW touch. Oo' People who haven't read the books are always complaining about spoilers and now book readers just got one.Â

30	tito5601	2014-04-27	man i hate that they made karl drink from mormonts skull, cant wait for jon snow or locke to murder him
31	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	That was great! B. Cogz steps up to the plate! The Heresy people are going to go apeshit over this episode! Solid ten for, though perhaps I'll lower that on rewatch.
32	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-27	Bryan Cogman is easily the best writer on the show, everything flowed well, nothing cringe worthy, and invented scenes were excellent and poignant on their own merit.Â
33	nothatso	2014-04-27	I thought it was rather uneventful save for Darth Maul showing up at the end, which was... weird. I figured that's what they were doing with the boys, but it felt a bit odd for them to show it.
Â 
I'm interested to see what they're going to do with Bran and co with Jon headed in their direction.
34	franko99	2014-04-27	10/10 love it, Bryan Cogman did it again.Â 
Â 
My only complain is that Jaime/Brienne was too short, but still amazing episode
Â 
Ser Pounce FTW
Jon knowing Bran is north, good change, I always though it was idiotic for Sam no to tell himÂ 
Â 
And the WW, we all suspect something like that is what happened to Craster's child, but why did the great other wear clothes?

35	Ser Blake	2014-04-27	That was incredible. Â I had chills at the end. BRYAN FUCKING COGMAN BABY!
36	TheHouseHB	2014-04-27	I loved it I even loved Daenerys' storyline this episode. Also, they need to keep on reminding viewers of the white walkers so show only viewers are not like who are they again when they appear later in the books/show. So I did not mind the ending one bit.
37	Zman1863	2014-04-27	Very good episode. The book deviations in the north are a bit contrived, but i think its working so far. They did a good job of building up the tension in that story line. I liked the KL stuff also. The Jaime stuff is presented as if nothing unusual happened last episode, which tells me they totally failed to convey what they thought in the rape scene. If you pretend the scene happens as it did in the books it all works.
38	of man and wolf	2014-04-27	How is this show uneventful? Things are happening that haven't even happened in the books, and we got glimpses into the future perhaps.
Â 
Dont mind the changes, it's the tv show, creative license and all.
Â 
Â 
The fact we have the direwolves back and looking big and mean is great. Not sure how they'd be captured so easily though. They are going to be big trouble for the mutineers soon.
39	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-27	Strong 8 bordering on 9. Â I like that they had Dany at the beginning to get her out of the way. Â I hate it when you look the clock and realize that it's 45 minutes past the hour and you just know they're going to close out with Emilia making some boring diatribe with that stupid smug look on her face...
Â 
The violent stuff at Craster's was pretty lame, IMO. Â I hate caricatures like Karl who are evil for no reason other than 'because they're evil'. Â GRRM knows how to build a true character, D&D still have no freaking clue.
Â 
Everything outside of Dany and Craster's was top-notch.
40	shiola	2014-04-27	WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. Â 9/10 because 10 is reserved for the Baelors and Blackwaters.
Â 
The ONLY gripes I have are...
- Why did the slaves write "KILL THE MASTERS" in the Common Tongue?? Â Unless Grey Worm wrote it?
- Where did Dany get that giant dragon banner?
Â 
Everything else was either good or PERFECT.

That might be just "English for the viewers benefit".Â  Not uncommon...like how they're speaking English in Valkrye, which takes place in Nazi Germany.
42	darndes	2014-04-27	I mostly love the book deviations, it makes it less predictable to us book readers....And SER POUNCE!!!! Â I was so stoked to see him included!Â
43	Trebla	2014-04-27	10/10 best episode of the season.
44	Ser Jake	2014-04-27	One thing kinda irritated me, it's really a small thing and I'm definitely nitpicking, but when Olenna says "back when marrying TargaryensÂ was all the rage", I don't like the "all the rage" line, not fitting for the show at all.
Â 
Great episode, though I don't like Bran being/getting captured at Craster's and I don't like them sending Jon to Craster's either. Other than that... that ending!
45	Ser Blake	2014-04-27	Also did anyone notice how good the direwolves looked in this episode? Â Glad to see they are getting some of that CGI budget too and not just the dragons

Â 
That's what I was thinking, but more attentive watchers would call bullshit on that. Â The slaves didn't speak English in their entire scene, and now they can write it? Â I'm telling myself Grey Worm wrote it because otherwise it'll bother me
47	Ser Creighton	2014-04-27	I give it a 10, the show embraced taking it's own direction and I actually find the two big northern plot twists interesting. Not a single complaint, great ending, and the entire episode was interesting all the way through. Was on the edge of my seat the last 3 minutes or so. It's not the books but that was a legitimate great episode for the show.
48	Ran	2014-04-27	Didn't care for this one, because of the giant-sized twists in logic that are compounded to try and make the story at Wall and beyond work. Mance Rayder is fooled by the ludicrous claim of 1,000 men of the Watch defending Castle Black, so they have to go after the mutineers... but hey, Bran's gonna look for a populated wildling village to hang out at and take shelter, so Jon really needs to go there... oh, and there's Locke overhearing that, so he'll want to tag along...
Â 
Meh.
Â 
Also, Margaery-Olenna.
Â 
Ser Pounce was great, though.
49	shiola	2014-04-27	Also did anyone notice how good the direwolves looked in this episode? Â Glad to see they are getting some of that CGI budget too and not just the dragons


Â 
Everyone's getting the CGI budget this year and it's incredible. Â I agree about the wolves! Â SO realistic. Â The way Ghost did the jump-back-and-snarl was perfection. Â They understand canine body language, and as a canine enthusiast and freelance researcher, that makes me happy.
50	Mark Antony	2014-04-27	Hmm I'm really not liking where the Bran story I'd going. It seems as though they altered it to make him seem relevant, but that might come back to bite them. Either that or it ends up being a small detour as Ghost and Summer free them. Still, not a fan of it.
Decent episode otherwise. And Craster's sons...become Others. I wasn't expecting to find that out from the show.


same thoughts. Solid episodeÂ
51	El Guapo	2014-04-27	Awesome episode, best of the season so far in my opinion. I gave it a ten.
Â 
Love the shot of Dany on the top of the pyramid with the Targaryen banner above her.
52	ToTheWolves	2014-04-27	I actually liked this episode a lot. I was glad littlefinger delivered the lines about keeping your enimies confused never let them know your true intensions(not exact words) lol I liked the ser pounce!...I felt a little weird about ghost being locked up but then I enjoyed that summer and ghost sort of meet back up. Oh the Jamie in this episode totally made me forget about the Jamie from the last episode. Lol that happen with anyone else?
53	High-born Plumber	2014-04-27	Just a thought after what we'd just seen:
I saw episode 202 today and noticed the baby Craster carried out cried the whole way, and stopped when the WW pickled him up.
The baby today seemed "happy" riding with the WW...
54	doghouse	2014-04-27	The Mereen slave revolt felt rushed but it is the least interesting storyline for me in the book so I am happy they took care of the revolt and moved on. Nice and quick.
Â 
I really like how the scenes blend in to one another...
Â 
Bronn and Jaime leads to Jaime & Tyrion which leads to Sansa and Littlefinger which leads to The Martells. Really nice flow and before you blink, a half hour has gone by.Â 
Â 
Put me in the camp who enjoys the deviations from the book North of the Wall.Â

Probably his brother to be honest
56	Widows_Blood	2014-04-27	Strong 8 bordering on 9. Â I like that they had Dany at the beginning to get her out of the way. Â I hate it when you look the clock and realize that it's 45 minutes past the hour and you just know they're going to close out with Emilia making some boring diatribe with that stupid smug look on her face...
Â 
The violent stuff at Craster's was pretty lame, IMO. Â I hate caricatures like Karl who are evil for no reason other than 'because they're evil'. Â GRRM knows how to build a true character, D&D still have no freaking clue.
Â 
Everything outside of Dany and Craster's was top-notch.


Really there aren't caricatures in the books? Ramsey, Joffrey, Mountain, Vargo Hoat and the Bloody mummers, the mutineers who killed Craster and were raping his daughters. I mean come on. There was some downright evil stuff committed in the books by absolutely evil people. Its perfectly reasonable that men who have been deprived of women and freedom for some time would gorge themselves at a place like Crasters on wine and women.Â
57	KalibakCruel	2014-04-27	Loved it. It's nice to not know exactly what's going to happen every now and then. Book deviations were good. Pacing was probably the best out of all the episodes this season so far. Like Locke tagging along the NW, adds a new element. Direwolves looked great. Also, Jon this season has been fun to watch. And the ending. Wasn't expecting to see it. Great stuff.
9/10 just because I want to hold onto the 10 for future episodes.
58	Sand11751	2014-04-27	A solid 9, while keeping in mind thatÂ the books are the books and the show is the show. That said, the non-frostbitten, happy baby bit at theÂ end? Weird, just plain weird and completely inexplicable. Anyway, so much played out tonight with Dany's conquest, Tyrion and Jaime, Sansa and Littlefucker. I even liked Bran and the NW mutineers! Finally got the answer of how much Joff's grieving widow knew. Still the baby - laws of physiology say he shouldn't have made it to wherever the hell theÂ WW took it before dying of frostbite. And the little tyke was so happy - WTF's up with that? Watching again, so good.
59	raj34	2014-04-27	Book readers were spoiled for the first time. Dammit George finish the books!


Â 
yup, and the howling commences... should be entertaining.
60	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-27	I thought it was rather uneventful save for Darth Maul showing up at the end, which was... weird. I figured that's what they were doing with the boys, but it felt a bit odd for them to show it.
Â 
I'm interested to see what they're going to do with Bran and co with Jon headed in their direction.

Same here, actually found most of the episode boring save for Littlefingers scene with Sansa. But Littlefinger is always gold IMO.
61	raj34	2014-04-27	Just a thought after what we'd just seen:
I saw episode 202 today and noticed the baby Craster carried out cried the whole way, and stopped when the WW pickled him up.

Â 
Yes, I took it to be some sort of supernatural influence. I don't understand why people can suspend their disbelief for dragons, frozen mummies, resurrected people etc., but freak out when they see a baby survive the cold.
62	growflet	2014-04-27	SER POUNCE!!

I liked the Jaime/Brienne scenes, Tyrion/Jaime, Littlefinger, scenes.
Â 
I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the whole bran arc. Â 
I understand they have to do something, because walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, would be boring on TV.
Â 
I like the confirmation about the white walkers that we only get implications from in the books.

Otherwise, pretty good. Â  Not jumping up and down screaming "YAY EPISODE", just "pretty good"
63	Fool of a Book	2014-04-27	Best episode yet, even though so much had changed. Â Was kind of nice to be surprised. Â I had to keep reminding myself that Bran and Company would be OK.
64	of man and wolf	2014-04-27	Also did anyone notice how good the direwolves looked in this episode? Â Glad to see they are getting some of that CGI budget too and not just the dragons


Yes. They looked great. This is how they should have always looked. Although I get in the first couple seasons they were still growing.
65	Ran	2014-04-27	Two points:
Â 
This isn't that big of a spoiler, IMO, the last scene. It just confirms stuff everyone pretty much believes, re: Craster's sons (and which is even more the case with the show, as we actually see an Other pick up the child there). Is the guy at the end the Great Other? I doubt it. There seemed to be another 12 (yeah, 13 in total) of him off to one side. Think this is more some sort of ... leadership group. Which is sort of spoilery and sort of not, because while GRRM says they don't have a "culture" per se, someone's got to make them their swords and armor and lead them, I guess.
Â 
Also, to be technically accurate, the wolves are not CGI. They are composited into the scene, and are 100% real wolves. I agree they did some great lighting matching, though.
Â 
ETA: More thoughts, plus links to the post-episode featurettes from HBO, at the Oathkeeper episode guide. Still working away on the recap (yeah, 5 AM here).

Physiological complaints when the books/show has the unburnt mother of dragons and a woman birthing a murderous shadow?  It is fantasy, ya know?

Oh really? Never realized that before, thanks for informing me! Your job is done here - Next!
69	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-27	Probably one of the worst episodes ever, in my opinion. I barely recognized any of it. The eponymous scene - "Oathkeeper" - seemed shorter than Grey Worm's completely superfluous language lesson. Divergences in Bran's storyline are pointless filler.
Â 
Oh, and for the cherry on top, a godawful CGI Targaryen flag and potential - who knows, at this point, what with all the liberties D&D love to take - book spoilers involving the Others. Thanks, HBO!
70	Wmarshal	2014-04-27	I gave it a ten, the blue armor won me.

Magic, dude. Â The White Walkers are powerful as fuck. Â I'm sure they have some sort of power to keep the baby alive long enough to change it into what they need it to be. Â

Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
It' even more boring in the books.
77	ToTheWolves	2014-04-27	I find it funny book readers somewhat pretty much liked this episode, but the unsullied seem to hate this episode...well the ones I know at least .
78	Ran	2014-04-27	I should add I don't really dislike giving Jon something to do. But the seams are showing in the story construction to get everything there at the same time in a very clumsy way.
Â 
Personally I'd have preferred having better logic for why Bran might be at Craster's Keep (seriously, looking for friendly wildlings?) and maybe to have Jon simply stick to the mutineer idea without having a thought to Bran possibly being there. Let Locke go with him just because he hopes it'll make Jon trust him more, so he can kill him more easily.
79	ohpooratlas	2014-04-27	It was so weird to be on the whole "I have no clue what the hell is going on right now for once!" as soon as we cut to Bran's storyline.
Â 
When the white walker turned up I kept thinking "please be Coldhands and go and kill those mutineers already!" even though I knew it wouldn't be him.
Â 
... and then low and behold ... confirmation on how the Others are made.
Â 
I gave the episode an 8.
Â 
There were so many good scenes that again kind of seemed overshadowed by the end so I'll definitely be rewatching.
80	tallTale	2014-04-27	Just a soso episode for me. Probably because I am most interested in the KL's stuff.
81	Jslay427	2014-04-27	Someone a while back called Locke joining the NW. I actually don't mind how they made it play out.
82	Wmarshal	2014-04-27	I gave it a ten, but I do admit I am little disappointed they created that rape scene with Jaime and Cersei, then made it as if it never happen.

87	DanyStark	2014-04-27	My my favorite deviation so far of course besides the Tywin/ Arya scenes. I agree with the fellow posters about how they were able to capture Ghost. The Hodor torment was particularly brutal didn't like that at all. As far as the book readers being spoiled about what the White Walkers are doing with Crasters sons I wonder if that's how GRRM intended it to be or if it will be revealed as different in the later novels.
88	greywindsrage	2014-04-27	9/10
89	Talbot	2014-04-27	Yeah haunt, did I use the word wrong or something?


I guess, I just don't see the point you're trying to make.
90	Wmarshal	2014-04-27	I guess, I just don't see the point you're trying to make.


Oh, I meant the confusing rappy looking scene Jaime and Cersei had is going to stick on Jaime for a while, after a bit of youtube arguments the official word will soon past.Â
91	Nictarion	2014-04-27	Gave it a 7. Ok episode overall, but probably my least favorite of the season. Would have gave it an 8 if not for the Bran at Craster's storyline, not liking that one bit.
92	Nictarion	2014-04-27	Double post
					
					
							Edited by Nictarion, 27 April 2014 - 10:59 PM.
93	Corvinus	2014-04-27	A solid 8, if not factoring in the book. A 1 if thinking of the book.
But not thinking of the book, I liked most of the episode minus the anti-climactic taking of Meereen.Â
94	Travy1991	2014-04-27	- Daenerys "evil" moment was rushed. Like a visit to the ass doctor. Something that it so evident D&D dont want to do.... I belive it was shorter than all Stannis evil moments. Even the last one.
- Dont like the butterfly effect of Bran and Jon story.
- Book spoiler area grows bigger and bigger....now we know were WW come from.
- Older Tommen cast switches a childish lovely character to one likely gay or dumb.
- Cartoonish evil guys in Crasters.
Its a 4.


Â 
Nice stereotyping there, sir. So if a teenage boy likes cats, he's most likely gay? You are as dumb as you think Tommen is. I think the show is going in the right direction with Tommen. He's a sweet, innocent older boy who is very naive and clearly infatuated with Margaery. This way the show is keeping Tommen close to his book counterpart while making the necessary changes to accommodate the actor's older age. The only point I agree with you about is the cartoonish evil guys at Craster's. Drinking from Mormont's skull was silly and OTT but I really want to punch the actor playing Karl in the face so he must be doing something right.
Â 
Anyway, that was a fantastic episode! Love the changes they have made with Bran's clunker of a storyline (for the most part) and that final shot with the White Walkers was absolutely stunning. Bryan Cogman is fantastic and the show feels very fresh with the changes they made this episode.
95	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-04-27	Previously I watched closely to see how the show stayed true to the book/books. I am now comfortable viewing the show as a show, on it's own, and the books for what they are and what they were. I am enjoying the show on it's own and where it goes no one knows.
96	sastelise	2014-04-27	This is my favorite episode so for this season - a 10. I like the departures from the book. Joffery's murder is more explicitly explained, and it's nice to get that out of the way. And what the hell is going beyond the wall? None of this was in the books, but I think that makes the show new and exciting again.
97	evita mgfs	2014-04-27	WOW!Â  These episodes are so quickly revealing answers to many discussions argued on the Forum, and tonight it is confirmed that Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sons are White Walkers.
98	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-27	This was one of my favorite episodes across all seasons. You can put me in the camp that dislikes having Bran's story tie in with Craster's, but it at least makes his story more entertaining and makes it less detached from the rest of the characters. I don't think anything major will become of that deviation.
Â 
The Night's King reveal was fucking huge. I'm not positive how I feel about his appearance, but the show doing what I'd hoped GRRM would do (Give us any insight to what appears to be the most important part of the story through five books) was great. Not being tied down to PoVs really helped here. I wont be able to stop thinking about this for a long time.
99	go joff go	2014-04-27	This one was one of my top5
100	Ser Creighton	2014-04-27	Two points:

This isn't that big of a spoiler, IMO, the last scene.

ETA: More thoughts, plus links to the post-episode featurettes from HBO, at the Oathkeeper episode guide. Still working away on the recap (yeah, 5 AM here).

Just wondering, I watched inside the episode because I was curious to see what D&D would say about the last scene, and they just refer to all of them as WW. Though that is clearly not a formerly dead human or mummified human raised from the dead and riding a horse. There are lines within the skin but the skin is not leathered and dried then frozen like on the sort of commander WW or whatever you would call them. These seem something closer to actual Others but D&D didn't mention it. Darth popsicle as some are calling him clearly had a some major differences, skin, teeth, horn sickles on his head. Plus I think he was dressed by the cenobites.
And no you don't need to answer me directly but just if you had any "Other" thoughts. I agree I highly doubt that's the great Other. But does seem a lot closer to the Others from the books than what we have seen so far. I believe D&D also said that is where the WW come from so, the Land of always winter, and it does have the lights, weather that's right or not, the way the y did it I don't know, but it did have lights. Odd that it was day time.
101	Ryuho Martell	2014-04-27	A 7 here. Not a fan of Bran in Craster's keep. But I could change my mind if they handle that part nicely later on.
102	Montey14	2014-04-27	Really not liking Brans TV arch with Lock in the middle of it .....I guess it makes for good television ....I'd thought we'd see bloodraven but instead we see the night king.....interesting as Martin hasn't even gotten to them in the books
103	Summah	2014-04-27	I think I'm over the show, after the rape last week and then this week which I could barely watch, it's not holding my attention at all anymore.
Also why did they have to have both Littlefinger and Olenna explicitly spell out poisoning Joffrey? it was made quite clear in the last two episodes and was pretty clear if implicit in the books.
104	Mr Smith	2014-04-27	Settling on a 9.
Â 
Didn't hate anything, but still disappointed with Aiden Gillen's portrayal of Littlefinger.
Â 
Everything at the Wall is being done really well, and I like the mutineers arc.
Â 
Also thought they nailed Dany's bit (pun not intended).
Â 
The final scene more intrigued me than anything else. Looking forward to see whether they take it any further.
105	Ran	2014-04-27	137 votes, 8.19 average, 9 median, 8.23 normalized average (derived by removing the top and bottom 5% of votes).
106	Robin Of House Hill	2014-04-27	So glad my vote Â of 1/10 got removed to normalize things.Â  
Â 
There were some good scenes, but everything from the wall, north was so horrendous, I just wanted to turn the TV off.
107	Nordeast	2014-04-27	One thing kinda irritated me, it's really a small thing and I'm definitely nitpicking, but when Olenna says "back when marrying TargaryensÂ was all the rage", I don't like the "all the rage" line, not fitting for the show at all.
Â 
Great episode, though I don't like Bran being/getting captured at Craster's and I don't like them sending Jon to Craster's either. Other than that... that ending!


Â 
I thought the exact same thing. Â That sounded like something a parody show making fun of a middle ages show would say.
Â 
Â 
Great episode gave it a 8.
Â 
Â Would have been a 9 if they didn't have Jon know about Bran, fucks too much up for the future. Â Also not a fan of Jojen being dumb enough to all them to get so close to Crasters that they could get captured that easily.
108	Seneti	2014-04-27	Perfect 10. This episode was undistilled awesome and I am so pumped for next week!
109	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-27	I can't stand reading some of these hateful and sarcastic comments that always wind up in this thread about how this show is garbage. Just going to give my rating and leave. 
9/10
110	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-27	Despite everything, I give it a 9.
Â 
The end was completely unexpected.

To be fair that line was used in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. When Ron's dad was talking to Harry about the disappearing cabinets he said they were all the rage back when you know who was in power.
112	Jay92	2014-04-28	Maybe it's because I started watching the show first and read the books later but I don't mind the deviations in this episode. Particularly with Bran whose story line isn't too interesting in the books and I am hoping Bran and Jon get to meet to each other.Â 
Â 
The last 5 minutes were totally WTF but I loved it. If the show wants to spoil me on WoW stuff, go ahead.Â 
Â 
Great episode. 9/10
113	Nordeast	2014-04-28	To be fair that line was used in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. When Ron's dad was talking to Harry about the disappearing cabinets he said they were all the rage back when you know who was in power.


Â 
I guess, but sometimes I just laugh at things that aren't meant to be laughed at. Â Like last episode with Danny talking only slightly loud, yet everyone in Mereen could hear what she was saying. Â She was far enough away where arrows couldn't make it to her, but close enough to be able to talk and have people behind walls hear her.
114	A Man Has Said	2014-04-28	I ended up giving it a three. The worst episode of the series so far, IMO.
Â 
I didn't mind the small deviations from the books that occurred in King's Landing.
I really liked the scene with Margaery in Tommen's bedroom. Ser Pounce was nice, but I'd have liked the scene without seeing him.
Â 
I even thought that the changes to the Mereen plot added quite a bit. Getting the slaves to assist in their own liberation was a tactically sound thing to do.
Â 
Up to the last 10 minutes or so I'd have given it an 8 or so.
Â 
I hated, hated, hated all the changes that they made at and north of the wall.
The show just crossed the Rubicon there and torched the bridge behind it.
SO MANY desperately negative negatives there, I don't even know where to begin.
I just think they made some very bad choices that they're going to regret sooner rather than later.Â 
It bodes ill for the rest of the season, and the rest of the TV series in total.
They're going to have to perform a miracle to pull this one out of the fire.
115	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-04-28	Straight 8 from me. 
I'm not too sure where the whole Bran/Jon/Locke/mutineers arc is gonna end up.
The scene between Margaery & QoT wasn't the best, I don't like how they're basically spelling everything out, not leaving any room for speculation.
Again, Natalie Dormer is too old for me, It just makes me uncomfortable to see her interact with Tommen. Was there really no other actress, one at least 8 years her junior.
116	lostinwesteros	2014-04-28	A solid 9 for me. SO much was unexpected/different from the books that by the end I was on the edge of my seat, dying to know what will happen next week.  Must be how the non-readers feel after each  episode.  I liked the divergence from the books, for the most part.  
     * good to see Sansa wiseing up and telling it like it  t-i-is. Littlefinger is so creepy.
     * nice to see Bronn advocating for Tyrion
     * loved the Jaime/Brienne scene . . . Is this no spoilers?  Just in case 
	Spoiler  I can NOT wait to find out what happens with them after Brienne is almost hung by unCat, then goes to get Jaime. 

     * glad we're seeing more Grey Worm - budding romance with Missandri?
     * Tommen is just too cute - eyes big as saucers and obviously loving every minute of Margaery.  
     * as someone else posted earlier, so glad we got Dany out of the way at the beginning.  I'm already sick of her and we've just entered Meereen.  The worst is yet to come.  But I really liked Barristan Selmy's reaction to her rejection of mercy.  
     * is there anyone better than Pod?
     * there's still hope for CH, but I also hope Jon and Bran get to see each other.  Those Poor Starks.
     * the Land of Always Winter?  
	Spoiler  isn't that where Bloodraven lives?  And aren't TCOTF thought to be around there somewhere? 
. 
     * lots happening! and happening so fast.  I'm loving it.
117	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-04-28	Yeah the scene between Bronn and Jaimie started out meh but ended up pulling on the heart strings.
118	Ser Creighton	2014-04-28	I should add I don't really dislike giving Jon something to do. But the seams are showing in the story construction to get everything there at the same time in a very clumsy way.
Â 
Personally I'd have preferred having better logic for why Bran might be at Craster's Keep (seriously, looking for friendly wildlings?) and maybe to have Jon simply stick to the mutineer idea without having a thought to Bran possibly being there. Let Locke go with him just because he hopes it'll make Jon trust him more, so he can kill him more easily.

I think they ran into problems trying to figure out why Sam wouldn't tell Jon about Bran. But Jon does know on the show, and it sort of felt like he was looking for an excuse to look for Bran plus I think it's more wishful thinking. Also I thought that was why Locke was going with him, and I did think it was primarily to kill the rouge watch.
It does sort of make sense for Bran to be there. Though Jon must of healed from those arrows really quickly, Bran must have been north of the wall for weeks now. Without Coldhands those I am not sure what is guiding Bran. But he did get close to Crasters in the books. I am actually curious to see where this goes, it''s hard to gauge the direction a bit but I don't mind surprises, which this episode had plenty of. I can't say if it is good or bad for the show yet, but I do find it interesting which is better than uninterested.
119	lightbringer333	2014-04-28	This ep was worst.
Why they showed the sack of meeren n stuff in such a fast pace?. I mean they could have split d whole fuckin meeren story n freeing thing in at least 2 episodes going in much depth on slavery n master n cruelty in meeren n then Danys entry in city in much stylish way. I would rather watch Spartacus for slave stuff. This is tasteless n insult to martins books.
It makes show tasteless when u don't give good timeline gap to the series of events.
How d fuck Locke reached to d wall so fast. Y did cersei didn't react to Jamie after she got raped as if nothing happened.
Jamie n tyrion scene could have been much deeper.
 Sansa asking Lf "' where r we goin ?" as if she doesnt know where Lf taking her?  I mean wtf happened to writer of this show ? Why they goin with such ordinary shtty writing? 
Why Jon is not angry on Sam after he learn that bran is beyond d wall. Y didn't he ask sam wat was dat silly reason for bran to go north n why did Sam let his little bro to go such dangerous place? Y didn't he ask about rickon n remembered him n for a sec ? No sadness n no worries on jons face. At least show writer should have made Sam to keep it secret n shuld have shown samwell dying to tell Jon about his little bro but he couldn't coz of his promise to bran.
Karl n rast r not leaving any good impression on this show that they r real assholes n evil bastards.
Scenes of dis ep are made just for sake n not of memorable kind the one u will not remember for long.
120	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-28	a 9. Solid 9.Â 
Deviations? Who cares when its so good! Others baby!
121	ground_control	2014-04-28	1 of 10: Reason -- no lower options
Â 
The first scene was a bit iffy, but I liked the KL scenes for the rest of the first half, but the last half (the North) was as bad (or worse) than Season 2.
Â 
Seriously, I can't see us getting less than 1 hour total of completely invented/rewritten scenes, which means at least 10% of this season's total running time, and that's *not* counting scenes outside of the North.
Â 
1) Sam told Jon about Bran -- OFF SCREEN, even
2) Craster's Keep no-names doing no-name stuff
3) Bran & crew getting captured
Â 
What a waste of screen time.
Â 
FYI, I'm ok with Locke at the Wall (minus overhearing Bran) and the Craster reveal, but most of it was just complete garbage that does not substitute for actual (or implied) book material.
Â 
On the plus side, at this rate, we'll be done in six seasons with no real spoilers about how the last two *books* end.
122	chicagostatecougars	2014-04-28	2/10. Very poor episode.
123	Lord_Dustin	2014-04-28	I gave the episode a 9/10.
The King's Landing scenes were excellent.  This week it was NCW's turn to shine and he really delivered.  I particularly enjoyed the scenes he had with Tyrion and Brienne.
As for the reveal about the White Walkers.  I think this was a necessary evil, to be honest this whole storyline doesn't excite me in either the show or the books.  A question was answered that has been hanging since Season 2.  The show runners really have milked that question and the answer is somewhat satisfying.
But why on earth did they not include a small scene featuring Gilly and little Sam in this episode?!  They would have fit here perfectly!  Sometimes the decisions on who to include in which episode perplex me!
I enjoyed that the emphasis on Dany's storyline was placed on Grey Worm.  That was a brilliant idea, it really showed how important Dany's liberation is to the Unsullied and the Freedmen.  That being said, they did shy away from underlining the fact that her motives for killing the Masters was questionable.
Bryan Cogman's writing is fantastic.  He really knows these characters inside out (it was nice to see drunk Cersei again).  However Michelle MacLaren showed once again that she cannot capture the same depth in the action sequences as she does in 1-1 scenes.  The taking of Meereen was incredibly flat, whereas the staging of the Tommen-Margaery scene and the Tyrion-Jaime scene was fantastic.

125	lightbringer333	2014-04-28	If Locke can reach to wall so fast then why its still getting late for more than 50k wildings to reach near d wall. Why mance is taking so long ?
Why d fuck Jon snow wants to risk his life to go again to craster keep? Just to kill those traitor to bury d secret who knows d total number of people manned on d wall ?
He knows d wildings can warg eagle as satellite surveyllance to collect d info ? By using eagle Wildings can easily find out how many castles r unmanned at d wall ? N why mance need castle black to invade. Tormund is already on south of wall. He can choose any other 16 castle which r unmanned n make way for wildings to invade.why d fuck some one waste their time for castle black ?
126	Queen of Whores	2014-04-28	6 out of 10. It's very obvious they're running incredibly thin for book material, so that's why nearly all of this episode was "original" stuff. I feel like Daenery's moment of cruelty was rushed and not properly done (what do you expect, they didn't want to ruin her complete transformation into Jesus Christ the Savior). The Grey Worm and Missandei bit was kind of pointless. I don't really like how anything in King's Landing is developing right now. It's moving at a snail's pace and becoming very redundant. The Oathkeeper scene was kind of anti-climactic and flat, and lacked the cathartic nature it had in the book. Tyrion continues to be The Greatest Man In Existenceâ<U+0084>c. The Jon stuff was probably the best of the bunch, but even then it felt very lifeless and dull. The Bran stuff is taking too far a deviation that may have a butterfly effect, and the stuff at Craster's feels a little pointless. We get it, they're villains. Karl was pretty entertaining so I'll give it that though. Also funny to see Ser Pounce was included, but I'm really not liking this new Tommen. I've given it a couple of episodes, and since I still don't like him nor think he fits the characterization properly, I'm gonna toss that one up to a mistake on the show's part getting rid of the old Tommen, who was perfect. And the stuff with the White Walkers.......... mmmk. Very, very weird and random. I don't exactly know how "in-canon" this is for the books. I'm hoping this isn't the beginning ofÂ WindsÂ material.
Â 
Bryan's dialogue was acceptable, I suppose, but this season is really running on fumes when it comes to the pacing and structure.Â

127	Eira Seren	2014-04-28	I did not like the changes to Bran.Â  Merging him with Craster's Keep seemed very contrived, far more so than necessary.Â 
Â 
Ghost caught in a cage and locked up?Â  Who did that, the Watch?Â  Before the mutiny at Crasters, or the mutineers after?Â  Nah, no reason to before (they don't direwolf-sit), and Karl may be a badass, but Ghost would've taken a chunk out of him.Â  We have a 150lb Giant Alaskan Malamute and she'd have destroyed that cage in seconds, so Ghost wouldn't still be in it.Â  I'm not buying it.
Â 


Â 
Everyone's getting the CGI budget this year and it's incredible. Â I agree about the wolves! Â SO realistic. Â The way Ghost did the jump-back-and-snarl was perfection. Â They understand canine body language, and as a canine enthusiast and freelance researcher, that makes me happy.


Â 
Yeah, they have the body language down, but apparently have missed some of the more obvious parts of canine behavior.Â  Wolves and malamutes both chew stuff to shreds, are quite powerful, are accomplished at digging and are far too intelligent to stay cooped up for long. Ours probably has her escape artist certificate buried somewhere out in her burrow.Â  Glad they got the CGI budget, am just wishing we could see them do more than hang out looking pretty.
Â 
Â 
Surely there were other, more interesting ways for Jon to find out Bran is still alive?Â  As it stands, Meera, Hodor, the direwolves and Bran's warging abilities made a very poor showing.
Â 
Also, it's too bad that GRRM hasn't felt the need to show us too many Others before now, and has somehow managed to maintain everyone's interest and the suspense.Â  Leave it to tv to lose all subtlety.

					
					
							Edited by Eira Seren, 28 April 2014 - 02:57 AM.
128	Alboin	2014-04-28	Fantastic episode, the best of the season for me so far.
Â 
The only clumsy thing I have a problem with is this casual revelation by Jon that he knows that Bran is alive and North of the wall. It looks like show runners have cut out Sam's oath last season not thinking about it really well and had trouble dealing with this mistake this season and then just took a lazy decision and made Jon tell viewers those lines... This is just not a very good job...
Â 
Everything else I enjoyed: all North sequences, Jon/Thorne opposition, mutineers, white walkers, Locke on the wall. Mereen scene left me with that pleasing feeling of non-rushed, thought-out story telling, I actually thought that they maybe need to make more of their scenes longer each episodes like this one. It will cover less characters, yes, but will give us more story about those that we see. Great scene with Marg and Tommen, poor frightened kid, got right into it. I enjoyed Jaime scenes as well, there was actual character development there. I strongly believe that Maclaren is a better director then Graves for GoT. She just has a style for GoT. It's not given that any good director has a style for any material. 2d and 3d episodes this season felt somehow out of the style for me and I'm glad things got back on track.Â
129	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-28	Loved it, Bran and the Reeds actually gets a few minutes of screentime for a change, Missandei and Grey Worm are cute, Ser Pounce and Tommen are even cuter, Brienne finally on the right track (no Loras scene though).
130	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-28	Solid 9. The only thing that bogged it down was the long and unfortunately tame sacking of Meereen.
Â 
And Dany's pomposity has reached new heights. I like Daenerys, but I wish the writers would stop the worship and get a little darker with that storyline and make things more interesting. Too much Dany-Christ-Savior bullshit going on.
131	Queen of Whores	2014-04-28	I'm kind of depressed that the two most (only) interesting characters in Dany's arc, Jorah and Barristan, have no lines and two lines respectively. I loved how Barristan delivered his line about mercy to Dany though. That's the Barristan I love.
132	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-28	A solid 7.Â 
Dany white washing brought it down from 8 to 7.
133	DrownedSnow	2014-04-28	WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. Â 9/10 because 10 is reserved for the Baelors and Blackwaters.
Â 
The ONLY gripes I have are...
- Why did the slaves write "KILL THE MASTERS" in the Common Tongue?? Â Unless Grey Worm wrote it?
- Where did Dany get that giant dragon banner?
Â 
Everything else was either good or PERFECT.


Â 
Â 
And how the heck did they get it up there?
134	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-28	It bored me a bit, that whole northern arc with NW, Bran, Locke, Crasters' Keep... I never found the Wall that interesting in the books, so maybe that's the reason I didn't like it. Only thing I liked about the whole thing was Mormonts' skull. The whole thing just felt very unreal. Still gave it a 7 because I liked the KL, Dany and Sansa scenes, second half was just disappointing. It's sad because I was pumped up after the Meereen, KL and Sansa scenes, but than everything went south when I had to watch 20 minutes of, well, northern lies.
Â 
That's what it was, those last 20 minutes were all made-up unnecessary bullshit. Ghost locked? Summer missing? Locke took a speedboat to the Wall? Ugh I'm not gonna list it all, just too much.
Â 
Now I don't agree with the whole Dany whitewashing idea, my unsullied friends are already telling me they think she'll be going mad and that's weird because at this point of the books, I still thought she was making perfect sense. I get a very strong feeling of entitlement. The scenes were she looks out over many people, or the one at the top of the pyramid... it is sending a message, but don't blame the show for not putting "MAD" on her forehead when she isn't. She's just entitled, and they show it.
135	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-28	You StanStan/"Dany r whytewash'd" people are fucking ridiculous. The showrunners include Dany crucifying the slavers (and even acknowledge that it was unnecessarily cruel with the Barristan bit), yet you nitpick and find the most trivial shit to complain about, BECAUSE HURR DURR THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA LET D&D BE RIGHT!!! Scene was rushed, it's a conspiracy! Give me a fucking break. Stannis is my favorite non-POV character and I'm no fan of Dany, yet some of you make me feel ashamed of calling myself a StanStan.
Â 
I'm just gonna leave the rate (9/10) and forget everything in this thread before I start using the ignore function.
136	Queen of Whores	2014-04-28	I'm just gonna leave the rate (9/10) and forget everything in this thread before I start using the ignore function.

Lol!Â  The Witch King of Angmar is only allowed if he agrees to bring along his bff Smaug, so that Dany's dragons can have a playdate.Â  They must also invite the Others and that Sith guy from Star Wars to tea after, so they can all compare horns.

Hodor getting injured/stabbed, I mean WTF is going on?
142	The Chequered Raven	2014-04-28	Am I the only one who did NOT like this episode at all?
Â 
Some really good scenes, I like NC-W's acting much more than as he still was the arrogant asshole. A man who has after all found to itself and struggels in finding his place because all his "world" does not at all accept his change...Â  The Brienne-scenes were very good, alos fitting how they changed the way Pod joined her.
Â 
Not good: The Tyrell-Littlefinger Plot was told to early. Surely the readers know, but for the unsullied it would be better to riddle if Thyrion did not...
Â 
Bran at Crasters? Why? To give him screen-time? The book-scenes of his journey are material enough, I think!
Â 
The final scene - a waste of screentime! The tiny Ice-Stonehenge was a joke, and the most interesting thing with the Walkers - nobody knows what they are, from where they are, and what they want - is spoiled
Â 
The first time I'm disappointed by the show!
143	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	Plus SideÂ 
Grey Worm infiltrating the slaves
Bronn/Jaime - I thought this was quite good. Said a lot about where both of them were at
Kingslayer Bros Inc - ditto for above
Marg/Olenna - a really well paced scene and loved how the framing pulls in closer and closer until the reveal is made. Only drawback was the Baelish voiceover at the start, but excellent otherwise.
Jon/Locke - Loved this scene on most fronts - especially Grenn stepping up, and Jon-Locke interaction. A tad put off by Slynt suddenly knowing more about the NW protocols than the Acting Lord Commander
Jaime/Brienne - fantastic sequence and loved the swaying of Pod as he struggled to stay in the saddle
Sam/Jon + Volunteers - Solid scenes but still have some doubts about how it will all be resolved. Revelation of Bran to Jon important loose end tied up IMO
Crasters - slightly on the plus side, but a few things just seem 'off' about it. I'll have to do a rewatch
Â 
Minus Side
'Kill the Masters' in English, after all the work they have done on creating languages, this just really stood out
Targaryen banner - would have had more impact if they had introduced it sometime in the last 3 years
WW - Wasn't overly impressed as it was depicted for some reason... Â needs a re-watch but I just see problems with overemphasising the WW menace now instead of as a 'vague, mysterious yet present' danger. Making them too menacing now risks people not rooting for the right side at the Battle of Castle Black. It might work out but I am not impressed at the moment.
Â 
Neutral
Missandei/Grey Worm - OK I guess, a pity they haven't spent this much time on Dany's character the last couple of seasons.
'Injustice' line - hopefully that and the final scene gets played out as the decent to megalomania, but I doubt it. I might have had in the plus side had they changed her outfit out of the Madonna Blue into Targ Red/Black.
Baelish/Sansa - I'd like to have this as a plus, giving Sansa some lines for once etc, but I am just cold about the Littlefinger portrayal. I loved his movements, but that voice....
Twincest - I'd love to put this as a plus. As a scene on its own it deserves it. As a scene following E01 and E02 it deserves it. It is glaringly obvious they just shouldn't have had 'that' scene last week at all.
Margommen - not bad, borderline in the plus column.
Â 
Id like to give an 8 but it doesn't quite make it, so 7 (almost a 7.5 but just short)
144	Steve Stark	2014-04-28	I really enjoyed it, although yes, it was different from the books. I get that. And I don't really mind it to be honest.
Â 

	Spoiler Actually had fun getting solid answers to theories we had the whole time, like LF's involvment in Joff's death, and the Tyrells. 

Â 
The scenes blended together almost perfectly. I'm not sure about the White Walkers, and never really have been with the show because they're not even CLOSE to how I imagined them. I realize it's a show, and they wouldn't be right on with what I created in my head, but they are so off from what I imagined that it's disorienting.
Â 
And whoever wrote "they were surprised when Darth Maul showed up at the end"....that gave me a good chuckle.
Â 
And the scene at Craster's, there are a lot of comments about how evil these people are, and that it's not GRRM's style. I honestly thought it was pretty well done, with a few minor quibbles. But if they had got rid of him drinking from Mormon'ts skull I would have been 99% okay with the whole thing. That part was a bit much.
Â 
Great show! I haven't been excited like this in a long time about a show.
Â 
EDIT: I gave it a 9.
Ep One: 8
Ep Two: 8
Three: 7
Four: 9
That's some pretty damn good television, in my opinion.

Â 
True, that was minorly irritating. But it kind of went with the previous Craster scenes where the girls were obviously brainwashed and would answer Craster's questions with memorized lines. So it didn't surprise me that they had some chant for when they sacrificed the babies...although I'll agee with you that I didn't particularly enjoy it.
Â 
I still find it hard to believe, in the book and show, that these women never teamed up and killed Craster. After all, giving up a child to the forest...it would only take one of them to lose it and stab him in the throat. Women become bloodthirsty when you mess with their children. Maybe that's where the brainwashing chants come in...it made them feel better about being forced into sacrifice? Craster's Keep...the whole situation is just creepy.
147	gmavridis	2014-04-28	Strong 8 bordering on 9. Â I like that they had Dany at the beginning to get her out of the way. Â I hate it when you look the clock and realize that it's 45 minutes past the hour and you just know they're going to close out with Emilia making some boring diatribe with that stupid smug look on her face...
Â 
The violent stuff at Craster's was pretty lame, IMO. Â I hate caricatures like Karl who are evil for no reason other than 'because they're evil'. Â GRRM knows how to build a true character, D&D still have no freaking clue.
Â 
Everything outside of Dany and Craster's was top-notch.


Â 
I agree. Strong 8, not 9 because of the caricatures like Karl and the deviation in Bran's story.
148	The Monkey	2014-04-28	Good episode. Not great, but it did its job. That last sequence with the White Walkers was exquisite, it's good to be reminded every now and again that this is a fantasy story.
Â 
I really didn't mind that they merge Jon and Bran's story. Hey, maybe they could even have a reunion scene, that would be so sweet. If Bran can convince Jon that it's his destiny to meet with the Three-Eyed Crow, Jon would keep the secret and the story could play out pretty much like in the books. Â

Â 
Excellent episode ! Deviations from book OK with me. Superb !
152	IlAovatar	2014-04-28	6/10 
Â 
The liberation of Meereen started off okay, but I hate how it suddenly cut forward to another Daenerys cheese moment. I'm now wondering why they even bothered with Grey Worm's first seen at all. They could have had an extra few minutes of Daenerys walking around like the Pope to cries of "mhysa".  Even the crucifixion scene felt rushed like they couldn't wait to show another shot of Daenerys being glorified.
Â 
Cersei and Jaime's scene was good. Surprise, surprise, she's not acting like a rape victim, confirming that last week's scene was consensual.
Â 
I think they went too far revealing how Joffrey was killed. I fully expected Littlefinger to brag to Sansa about his involvement and go into detail about the necklace, but Olenna blurting her own involvement out in a city full of spies seemed a bit much to me. I think most viewers already got the message the moment Littlefinger's scene cut forward to the Tyrells.
Â 
I was surprised to see Locke at the Wall so soon. His interactions with Jon weren't a bad deviation from the books though in my opinion. Alliser Thorne was great as usual.
Â 
Loved the scenes at Craster's Keep (especially the character Karl) up until they caught Bran and co. This seemed like a huge and unnecessary change to me that could result in things happening that I didn't want to happen (Stark kids reuniting).
Â 
The final White Walker scene was an underwhelming surprise. I wasn't at all impressed by their homeland, icehenge, or the leader who looks like some kind of frost vampire. And the confirmation that White Walkers are created using human babies sort of cheapens them as a fantasy race in my opinion.
153	Steve Stark	2014-04-28	Ha! "IceHenge".

Good point on the White Walker scene. It does cheapen their mystical race a bit. Some are even saying that we know too much, which takes away from the eeriness. I can understand that too.
154	Shinjinobrave	2014-04-28	Very hit and miss.
Â 
Everything north of the wall was terrible, Nikolai isn't getting anything to work with, Dany's cruelty was a dud and Emilia's acting isn't improving...
Â 
That being said I loved Sansa, Margaery and Olenna in this, great work.

156	TheEvilKing	2014-04-28	That was a really good episode.
Â 
First off, the Craster's Keep storyline. They're inserting an original subplot that's actually good? Well played. I certainly did not expect them to capture Bran and co. Dirk was ridiculously entertaining, Locke at the Wall is intriguing, Kit's acting has gone up a couple of notches this season. Right now the stuff at the Wall is more interesting than KL.
Â 
Speaking of KL, still some good stuff there. Jaime's storyline played out as expected and was solid quality. QOT admitting to her role in Joff's murder was badass. Margarery sneaking into Tommen's room... lucky kid is all I can say.
Â 
Dany's slave rebellion and crucifiction of the masters could have been a bit more brutal, it felt like they wanted to show how ruthless she can be but at the same time were too scared of turning people against her.
Â 
Littlefinger scene was alright. His accent continues to make me chuckle. Looking forward to comical antics at The Eyrie next episode.
Â 
That final scene. Holy shit. I-is that book canon? I kind of have to think so, otherwise why even include it if it doesn't turn out to be important?
Â 
ETA: Gave it a 9.

157	Perin Stone	2014-04-28	Am I the only one who did NOT like this episode at all?
Â 
Some really good scenes, I like NC-W's acting much more than as he still was the arrogant asshole. A man who has after all found to itself and struggels in finding his place because all his "world" does not at all accept his change...Â  The Brienne-scenes were very good, alos fitting how they changed the way Pod joined her.
Â 
Not good: The Tyrell-Littlefinger Plot was told to early. Surely the readers know, but for the unsullied it would be better to riddle if Thyrion did not...
Â 
Bran at Crasters? Why? To give him screen-time? The book-scenes of his journey are material enough, I think!
Â 
The final scene - a waste of screentime! The tiny Ice-Stonehenge was a joke, and the most interesting thing with the Walkers - nobody knows what they are, from where they are, and what they want - is spoiled
Â 
The first time I'm disappointed by the show!


Â 
You're not alone/Â  I hated everything that happened after they got to Castle Black.Â Â 
Â 

	Spoiler  Apparently fending off the wildling attack from the south, defending the wall from the huge army and becoming Lord Commander isn't enough for Jon to do this season so they had to invent more things for him to heroically do...
158	The Killer Snark	2014-04-28	I gave this a solid 8. It was a similar type of episode as last week's underrated flair-fest, but there was something a bit workmanlike about it, and the pace was a tad flat-footed throughout most of its second half. Sandwiched between the promise of the Dany opening and a thrilling scene with the Others (I really liked it) were a slew of scenes that were generally sensitive to the books without being as interesting as last week's, except for some possibly dubious alterations: I know we're being cheated of Vargo's unspeakable death by Gregor, but what exactly is Locke, his alter-ego, doing at The Wall? The Castle Black scenes were fairly credible, but simply went on a bit too long. It unnecessarily made us miss the presence of Oberyn, and Dany should have been featured more. Her appearances are getting bittier, and we need more of them to counteract how inactive she gets later on. On the plus side, Margaery getting her smexy groove on was good, and the scenes between Jaime, Bronn and Tyrion were nicely handled even though each of these listed deviates from strict adherence to the novels. I can't objectively give this one less than 8, but the steady pace worked fine the last time round, and now it's time they started to pick things up.
Â 
The tension of the outcome of Tyrion's trial, btw, is somewhat neutered by the show's continued sidelining, if not complete elision, of the character of Greg Clegane.

159	Scott Richman	2014-04-28	It was by far the worst episode ever. If the 1st few episodes were this bad I would have never kept watching.
160	The Killer Snark	2014-04-28	It's the weakest so far of the season, I will certainly give you that.
161	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-28	Not sure why they are moving so fast, I am learning way more from the show than I ever wanted.
Â 
They are trying to do too much in each episode, I give it a 5.

					
					
							Edited by AnotherCrannogman, 28 April 2014 - 06:47 AM.
162	The hairy bear	2014-04-28	I've rated it 6/10. The previous eps in the season have been rated 7, 8, and 5. *
Â 
It would have been a solid 8, but I'm taking away one point away for having the bad guys being too plainly and cartoonishly evil (Litlefinger's voice, Karl drinking from Mormont's skull, Throne sending recruits to suicide mission in order to manipulate the election,...) and another one for not taking profit af many opportunities that some scenes presented (IMO, Bienne's farewell or on's decision to go to Craster could have been handled better).
Â 
*It would be cool if everyone shared their past votes in the season and not only the current episode, to give persepective. It's very different a 10 from a a poster who has voted every season's episode a 9 or a 10, than a 10 from someone who was giving sixes or sevens.
163	ebevan91	2014-04-28	I'll give this one a 7. The lowest rating I've given so far for season 4. Part of the reason is because of the same reason Ran gave, with the whole wildling village thing or whatever (the Jon scene). Most of the scenes were well done, I just think the writer had a brain fart there. And it's not all of the changes that kinda upset me, it's more the fact that we're getting closer to the show overtaking the books, and I think the show is starting to showcase that.

					
					
							Edited by ebevan91, 28 April 2014 - 07:09 AM.
164	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-28	A solid 8. I felt like most of the changes and additions here worked really well, including the Night King's teaser and Land of Always Winter. Tommen and Marg developing a very suggestive, "first love" (on his end) kind of relationship, while still suitably creepy, works really well given their new ages, and it looks like it'll be amusing to watch.
Â 
Considerate of them to get Dany out of the way quickly too. Thanks Bryan.

165	BrettStark	2014-04-28	Its not fair to judge the show on how close it relates to the book. I have read all the books, and I personally want changes. If the show was 100% like the book it would be really boring for me to watch. The changes make it interesting to watch every week because I am not spoiled. People need to judge the show ON THE SHOW itself.Â 
Â 
I give this episode an 8, Jon Snow coming in contact with Bran will be very interesting. I kind of like how this is playing out compared to the books.Â
166	Waylin Stark	2014-04-28	I'd say 8.5.
Â 
I really liked Margaery meeting Tommen.
And Bran and Jon's stories were really good. I'm enjoying the filler a lot.
Â 
And finally the truth about the White Walkers!!!
167	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-28	Great except for Crasters and the story line deviating to poor Hodor being chained up, the Reeds and Bran imprisoned and what happened to Summer? Also why did Jon Snow not know about Ghost being imprisoned there. I did not like the bit at Crasters at all.
Â 
Loved the ending with the introduction of what lies further north....and loved all of the rest of the espisode. Ser Pounce!!! Love that cat!
Â 
I also really like the new Tommen and them setting the stage early for the Cersei Margaery rivalry. I think he will be a great Tommen.
Â 
Sorry to see the Queen of Thorns leaving...hope she is back again.
Â 
I gave it a 7 because I disliked the Bran/Reeds/Hodor/Direwolves at Crasters so much.
168	Steve Stark	2014-04-28	So it would seem people either really loved it, or despised it. 
Â 
I've been reading the books for years, and if I hadn't seperated the two platforms entirely I think I'd be stressing out about the changes in the show. Fortunately for me, I am able to enjoy the show without always comparing the original work. Of course I do it from time to time, we all do, but overall I prefer to look at it as if it were it's own beast. I enjoy it more that way. It's just good television. A fun show for me to watch and talk about the books with my close friends.
Â 
I still think I'll reserve my 9 rating, although I've thought about dropping it to an 8 due to a few things people have mentioned. But the truth is that I enjoyed the episode quite a bit.
169	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-28	I gave it a 10! Â This was just one of THE best episodes, every single moment was good and definitely left me with that feeling at the end of how in the world did an hour just pass? Â I was on the edge of my seat. Â 
Â 
Seriously, Ser Pounce!!!! And of course, the ending was amazing!! Â This is turning out to be an excellent season!
170	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	Â 
Â 
*It would be cool if everyone shared their past votes in the season and not only the current episode, to give persepective. It's very different a 10 from a a poster who has voted every season's episode a 9 or a 10, than a 10 from someone who was giving sixes or sevens. 


Â 
Yep. Mine are
Â 
Ep01 - 8+
Ep02 - 8-
Ep03 - 7
Ep04 - 7+
171	C0bR	2014-04-28	Gave it 7, would it give it 5 after thinking it over.
Â 
The show has completly lost any sense of timing. The pacing is all over the place. Some good scenes can't really outweigh that bullshit they are making up.
172	Hoo	2014-04-28	This episode was a 10, if for nothing else but the fact Jamie's character is just fine, not ruined.Â
173	Ser Graymax	2014-04-28	Sorry, another 7 for me.
Â 
The show seems to have lost the "spark" it once had.Â 
Â 
Just seems like a bunch of scenes tacked together with lackluster acting and dialogue for the most part.
Possibly why some scenes just seem to jump out at you and the others fade to gray quickly.
Â 
Then again, maybe its just me.Â
174	Ran	2014-04-28	302 votes in, 7.97 average, 9 median, 8.19 normalized average. Quite the swing.
175	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-28	Ran
Can you list other episode ratings so we do not have to look for them?
176	Ferrum Aeternum	2014-04-28	Very solid episode, 9/10.Â 
Â 
I didn't mind any of the deviations from the book, and in fact the sequence at the end with the WWs was one of the coolest things I've seen on the show (no pun intended ).Â  The only thing that fell flat for me were the scenes at Craster's, particularly mustache-twirling Karl.Â  Drinking from the skull of Mormont?Â  C'mon, that's pure cartoon villain shit andÂ was unnecessary.
Â 
Everything leading up to that was outstanding.Â  Dany taking Meereen was handled deftly without feeling rushed, Sansa/LF, Jaime/Tyrion and Jaime/Brienne wereÂ great, Marg/Tommen was well played with Ser Pounce stealing the show.
Â 
Regardless of how poorly I think the scenes at Craster's were handled this week, I'm now very interested to see how that plotline is resolved.Â  Will Jon meet with and speak to Bran?Â  It's certainly looking that way.
177	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	9/10Â my highest score for Season 4 so far!
Â 
The character interactions were great, the twists were gripping and I have little complaints.
Â 
The Bran/Jon plot alterations makes for good TV.
Â 
Why are people getting their feathers so ruffled? Jon not knowing Bran is alive only serves for character development (so far) and doesn't make drastic changes to the plot. JonÂ didn't want Winterfell anywayÂ and the absence of Robb's will looks like he won't be KitN....although, there are still ways to make these things happen without the knowledge of Bran and Rickon being dead.
Â 
The show can work around this and will put entertainment first, not character development that is hardly eventful. There are many non-book readers that will find this storyline exciting, making Bran and Jon more likable as characters as opposed to their book material which plays out emotional and admirable in the books (as we can hear their thoughts) but boring and uneventful on the screen.
Â 
I think the Crasters keep storyline is stealing the spotlight at the moment.

Episode 3: 6.95
Episode 4: 7.95
179	Bonifer Tasty	2014-04-28	One thing kinda irritated me, it's really a small thing and I'm definitely nitpicking, but when Olenna says "back when marrying TargaryensÂ was all the rage", I don't like the "all the rage" line, not fitting for the show at all.
Â 


Â 
You know, I agree! Â This was really out of character, to say nothing of how out of time/place it was for anyone to say. Â  To me, although I agree that this is a tiny detail to nitpick, it shows a kind of laziness that is creeping into the writing. Â 
Â 
More seriously for me, and the sole reason why I downrated this episode to 6, is that they had Samwell reveal his knowledge of Bran. Â  This really really changes so much. Â  The show is definitely on its own path now - either to nonsense, or to a different story arc. Â And Jon leaving for Crasters - is he not going to be at Castle Black when Ygritte's invading force gets there? Â  Are they going to postpone the Wildling hit on Castle Black until he's back, leaving the Wildlinds to wander around searching for Castle Black FAR TOO LONG. Â I mean really, they climbed the wall, how can they have trouble finding it again...did they go THAT FAR south? Â Why? Â Lots of messiness here.
Â 
I was shocked by the ending reveal, and am unhappy getting the spoiler, but I think i can deal with it. Â  I was also shocked by how bluntly they had Olenna admit to poisoning Joffrey! Â I mean, for book readers, there was still some small doubt about that... perhpas Littlefinger was lying to Sansa, or misrepresenting things. Â And now, Margaery is also bluntly exonerated, when part of the fun in the book was being uncertain if she knew the plot. Â But I can deal with those things too.
Â 
Liked Brienne/Pod/Jaime. Â Liked Meereen takeover, although it was rushed, and I'm a bit sad that the reasons to punish Selmy (and Mormont) were not there. Â  I suppose Mormont's exile will come a bit later, but since Selmy never hid who he was, Daenerys has not reason to doubt him.
Â 
Lots to process here. Â Unsettling, even as I am forced to go on watching the show with greed for more!
180	Hodor of House Hodor	2014-04-28	I'm sure this has been thrown out as a possibility, but I'm at work and don't have time to read ALL the replies.
Â 
Bran getting captured is PERFECT for the story, and here's why:
- Coldhands shows up and lays waste to the ex-Crows, frees Bran's gang and takes them away, thus being a perfect introduction of Coldhands to the show.
- Jon, Locke and the gang show up and the Keep is in ruins with huddling girls and Ghost protecting them/eating remains of ex-Crows. Jon reunited with Ghost, Jon knows something is off/this wasn't a Wildling raid (girls would be gone), reports back to Castle Black with his first batch of Wildling refugees, causing tension at Castle Black.
- Jon and Bran never meet. If they do, there's no way Jon would let Bran continue on his wild goose chase in the North.

Â 
Well then... so much for that... I guess that doesn't mean Coldhands can't release Bran and the gang first though... :-)
183	A Redeemed Hound	2014-04-28	Gave it a 4 only because the scenes at King's Landing were great.Â  Even if they dumbed down the mystery of who killed Joff.Â  Loved Season 3 and all of the episodes up until last night.Â  So everyone is cool with Jon totally forgetting he has a killer direwolf?Â  "Hey, that's right.Â  Where the frick is Ghost?"Â  That is some really sloppy writing right there.Â  I know they need to do something with Bran since they left out Coldhands (who apparently has no real meaning in the books then), but this is taking it too far.Â  Why did they make Sam tell Jon about Bran?Â  And why not show that kind of powerful scene?Â  So sloppy.Â  And we now have baby Others?Â  Will they gro into toddlers and who watches the kids while the grownups are wreaking havoc?Â  And was Meereen's takeover just as anticlimactic in the books?Â  I know they used the "cock" to ram the walls and stuff but I don't remember them showing any battles.Â  I guess the dragons are on holiday with Ghost and Summer too.Â
184	Hodor of House Hodor	2014-04-28	best episode of the season. even spoiled the book readers.
185	cybobbie	2014-04-28	I like the surprise in the end of episode for a change, I'm like many that like a bit of deviation from the books and enjoyed some spoilers for the first time. I gave 9 instead of 10 only because the only thing that I don't want to happen is Jon meeting with Bran, so I hope somethings happens and Bran manages to leave before Jon gets there to kick that bunch of cowards ass.
186	Shitmouth the Wise	2014-04-28	- Where did Dany get that giant dragon banner?

190	Arwyl	2014-04-28	I give this episode a strong 8. 
Anyone else thought "Fortress of Solitude" during that last scene with the crystal pillars?
191	Ser Reyno	2014-04-28	Worst episode! . A little deviation from the books is to be expected but the only scene in episode 4 which was in book 3 was Jaime and Breane. The scene with Pod wasn't even done right. Some creative license is one thing, episode 4 was a wholesale rewrite of the story.
192	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-28	9/10
Â 
Amazing episode. Better than anything from S3 and on par with episode 1 this season. The writing is horribly up and down this season but 2/4 good episodes ain't bad!Â 
Â 
Pros
- The Others
- Dany being portrayed properly and them not shying away from the brutal punishment
- Broon
- Pod going with Brienne
- Jon really coming into his role
- Locke
- Queen of Thorns
Â 
Cons
- The Others(Hurry up George RR martin!!!)
- Sack of Astapor was way to quick. A few little bits of dialogue would have done a lot.Â 
- Craster's Keep Mess. Not sure what they are planning here but good they slowing Bran's story down I guess
193	A Redeemed Hound	2014-04-28	Worst episode! . A little deviation from the books is to be expected but the only scene in episode 4 which was in book 3 was Jaime and Breane. The scene with Pod wasn't even done right. Some creative license is one thing, episode 4 was a wholesale rewrite of the story.


Exactly.Â  I totally understand the need to change things around a bit but last night was just totally reworked.Â  I was okay with the scene with Pod though.Â  To me that blended in well with the story.Â  Nothing else blended in well with the story so I can only assume that now is when things change completely and have nothing to do with the novels.Â  I would not even be surprised if Jon Snow does a Homer Simpson "Dhoh!" when he sees his direwolf caged up.Â  "I KNEW I was forgetting something!"
194	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-28	8 for me this week. Thought it was a really good 'move the story along' kind of episode, and found myself liking the book deviations.
Â 
Positives
- LF/Sansa: LF getting Sansa to talk through his moves was a great step in immediately showing that Sansa is about to start learning the game.
- Locke: what great use of him, this is just the kind of plan Roose would make and Locke made Castle Black so much more interesting.
- Olenna/Margaery/Tommen: from Olenna schooling Margaery in feminine manipulation to the bedroom visit so Margaery can lure Tommen away from Cersei's grasp, all very well executed. And Ser Pounce!
- Bran: i might be disagreeing with most here, but liking he has a bit of extra danger to deal with, his story was really flat-lining but business has picked up now.
- Thorne/Slynt: May be only a small part of it but Janos just reminding Thorne that Jon is pretty popular and an election needs to be held so they gotta do something about that, was good because that was pretty important info there, and it was nice to see these two actually strategising instead of being asses.
- Whitewalkers: It felt like the right time to show these guys again. I also love that they are pushing this ambiguity of good or evil. They are scary as hell but we haven't seen them do anything evil, and them being referred to as God-like beings by Craster's Wives really shows we can't see them as villains or monsters.
- Pod/Brienne: Pod's 30 seconds shows real promise to get some Hound/Arya style comedy moments in the future.
Â 
Negatives
- Tyrion/Jaime: I wasn't feeling that conversation. It felt too soap opera-like with the constant reminder of the son/brother/sister/uncle/father intertwined family stuff. We get it, you guys are in a screwed up family.
- Sam/Jon: So sick of Sam, glad he wasn't in it for long, his trip to Oldtown better be a lot more riveting.
- Meereen: I found the whole sequence weird. The Grey Worm opening was odd, they went straight from 1 master about to be killed to oh Dany won again, usual Dany speech.
- Craster's Keep: I've seen that actor before in a couple of other things, but he was way OTT in his delivery, i just found him weird instead of finding him intimidating,

195	chilammx	2014-04-28	10 by all means.
As a book reader this was the first time that I was over the edge of my seat shouting and flapping my arms all around.
It was cool to watch unsullied show watchers enjoying the plots of the show.
This time i offered them the side show with my annoyance and my WTF looks.
Â 
For me a memorable experience watching TV.
196	Lyanna's Winter Rose	2014-04-28	9/10 best episode so far. Loved the book deviations.
197	jarl the climber	2014-04-28	I gave it an eight, a very crisp epsiode that moved along very well even though the story and some of the deviations didn't always make a lot of sense but they made it work. I sort of agree with Ran about the Bran/Jon storyline but its a minor quibble, it works well enough if your not dissecting it. I thought the scene with Dany at the top of the pyramid and the banner flying in the wind was a good visual shot. They sort of rushed through the conquest of Mereen for budget reasons so I can't really argue with them abbreviating this.Â
198	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-28	So glad my vote Â of 1/10 got removed to normalize things.Â  
Â 
There were some good scenes, but everything from the wall, north was so horrendous, I just wanted to turn the TV off.


Â 
Glad to see Im not the only one who hates the North stuff so far. The plot with Bran is just pointless filler, imo.Â
199	gogorath	2014-04-28	You StanStan/"Dany r whytewash'd" people are fucking ridiculous. The showrunners include Dany crucifying the slavers (and even acknowledge that it was unnecessarily cruel with the Barristan bit), yet you nitpick and find the most trivial shit to complain about, BECAUSE HURR DURR THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA LET D&D BE RIGHT!!! Scene was rushed, it's a conspiracy! Give me a fucking break. Stannis is my favorite non-POV character and I'm no fan of Dany, yet some of you make me feel ashamed of calling myself a StanStan.
Â 
I'm just gonna leave the rate (9/10) and forget everything in this thread before I start using the ignore function.


Â 
I also don't see how she was whitewashed. She did still put the Masters up, right? Barristan asked her for Mercy and she rejected it in favor of "Justice" or "Revenge" depending on how you like to think of it.
Â 
What did you people want? Ominous music and a shadow of Darth Vader hovering over her? A celebratory dance number extolling the virtues of Stannis?
200	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-28	Am I the only one who did NOT like this episode at all?
Â 
Some really good scenes, I like NC-W's acting much more than as he still was the arrogant asshole. A man who has after all found to itself and struggels in finding his place because all his "world" does not at all accept his change...Â  The Brienne-scenes were very good, alos fitting how they changed the way Pod joined her.
Â 
Not good: The Tyrell-Littlefinger Plot was told to early. Surely the readers know, but for the unsullied it would be better to riddle if Thyrion did not...
Â 
Bran at Crasters? Why? To give him screen-time? The book-scenes of his journey are material enough, I think!
Â 
The final scene - a waste of screentime! The tiny Ice-Stonehenge was a joke, and the most interesting thing with the Walkers - nobody knows what they are, from where they are, and what they want - is spoiled
Â 
The first time I'm disappointed by the show!


Â 
I dont get why this show has to shoehorn characters in some episodes. Like if it fits to give the character scenes, give it to them. Dont force it. i absolutely hated the NW/Crasters Keep/Bran scenes. The whole thing was forced to give him a story...my question is, if his story is lacking, why do they need to have him in the episode. Give that time to another character instead.Â

What did you people want? Ominous music and a shadow of Darth Vader hovering over her? A celebratory dance number extolling the virtues of Stannis?


Â 
I don't know, I guess people wanted her to smiles, clap, and eat popcorn while listening to the screams of men crucified at her orders.Â 
Â 


Â 
I dont get why this show has to shoehorn characters in some episodes. Like if it fits to give the character scenes, give it to them. Dont force it. i absolutely hated the NW/Bran scenes. The whole thing was forced to give him a story...my question is, if his story is lacking, why do they need to have him in the episode. Give that time to another character instead.Â 


Â 
I understand your point but they can't have Bran do nothing the whole Season. It feels forced to you because it didn't happen in the book. I agree that the logic of Bran being there wasn't very good and that could've been handled much better, but for a character that's extremely important to the narrative as a whole, they need to invent some stuff to keep them involved and interesting. Unfortunately it was a bit awkward here, but they're going to need to fill some gaps from the books with invented stuff. I was just glad to see a bit of warging, some of the Reeds, a shot of Ghost, and some WWs.
202	TheHodorThatWasPromised	2014-04-28	- Daenerys "evil" moment was rushed. Like a visit to the ass doctor. Something that it so evident D&D dont want to do.... I belive it was shorter than all Stannis evil moments. Even the last one.
- Dont like the butterfly effect of Bran and Jon story.
- Book spoiler area grows bigger and bigger....now we know were WW come from.
- Older Tommen cast switches a childish lovely character to one likely gay or dumb.
- Cartoonish evil guys in Crasters.
Its a 4.


How do you get that Tommen is gay ?
He seems to be very happy,Â but a little surprised,Â at the prospect of sharing his bed with Margaery (andÂ who can blame him Â )
203	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-28	How do you get that Tommen is gay ?
He seems to be very happy,Â but a little surprised,Â at the prospect of sharing his bed with Margaery (andÂ who can blame him Â )


Â 
Yeah, I thought he reacted pretty naturally to having Natalie Dormer lips a hair's breadth away from his. He certainly went to sleep a lot happier...
Â 
Really, he's taking the whole thing in the way you'd expect a sexually naive fourteen/fifteen-year-old boy to. He's smitten and confused.
204	rmholt	2014-04-28	Awesome episode, best of the season so far in my opinion. I gave it a ten.
Â 
Love the shot of Dany on the top of the pyramid with the Targaryen banner above her.

Yes I liked how we got a brief glimpse of it - not enough to pick out what it is - just that it was portentous - then the close up.
205	Ser Reyno	2014-04-28	Amen brother. I'm a reader, GRRM is telling a fantastic story and HBO is butchering it. My fear is that Martin's writing of the last two books will be influenced by the show's script. So what are the Thenns doing now, hanging out in Moles town just chillin South O' the wall........
206	Ser Reyno	2014-04-28	Am I the only one who did NOT like this episode at all?
Â 
Some really good scenes, I like NC-W's acting much more than as he still was the arrogant asshole. A man who has after all found to itself and struggels in finding his place because all his "world" does not at all accept his change...Â  The Brienne-scenes were very good, alos fitting how they changed the way Pod joined her.
Â 
Not good: The Tyrell-Littlefinger Plot was told to early. Surely the readers know, but for the unsullied it would be better to riddle if Thyrion did not...
Â 
Bran at Crasters? Why? To give him screen-time? The book-scenes of his journey are material enough, I think!
Â 
The final scene - a waste of screentime! The tiny Ice-Stonehenge was a joke, and the most interesting thing with the Walkers - nobody knows what they are, from where they are, and what they want - is spoiled
Â 
The first time I'm disappointed by the show!
Amen brother. I'm a reader, GRRM is telling a fantastic story and HBO is butchering it. My fear is that Martin's writing of the last two books will be influenced by the show's script. So what are the Thenns doing now, hanging out in Moles town just chillin South O' the wall........
207	rocksniffer	2014-04-28	10/10...best episode since they chopped off Ned's Head....Â
208	Conchobar	2014-04-28	A 9, I loved it
209	King Tyrion I	2014-04-28	9/10 for me.
Â 
Ser Pounce for the win.
Â 
I liked this episode overall.
210	Rain of Castamere	2014-04-28	one of the worst episodes so far.
So many many cahnges..
ITs like they went "fuck it, now were going to do it how we want it to".
These changes have so so many implications for the plot that, right now, Im not sure how they will stay faithful to the books.
Â 
Ive always been a defender of the show and their changes, but what they did in this episode is beyond me..
Â 
I just dont know what to say right now.. Why?!
Im seriously worried about the show right now.

Â 
Nothing major will change. Relax. The only thing with major implications is that Jon and Bran may meet, but they probably won't. Bran will still go North to the 3EC and Jon will still defend the will, will still be presented with a chance to be Lord of Winterfell, and will still be Lord Commander. There is literally nothing different other than the journeys getting there, which they're making less detached and more suspenseful/active.Â
212	darksellsword	2014-04-28	This is the first time I've given an episode a 10 , just fantastic episode 4 has been the best at least these last seasons. This episode spun my head around like something from the exorcist it just blew my mind, at first I had a huge problem with the ghost being captured scene like other people I was sure it couldn't happen and was confused about why they would keep ghost alive, but after I thought about the changes they had already made with ghost not being with Jon when he went with the wildlings and instead fighting with Lord Commander Mormont at the fist even saving Sam from a white walker. My explanation for what we saw last night is. The self proclaimed fucking legend of gin alley saw what Ghost can do to a White and thought rather have it around than dead at the very least it might give us a signal if there are whites around. I think Sam put ghost in the cage before the mutiny happened.
It might also be possible that some of the mutineers like Jon ,he had his run in with Craster too .They could also be scared of him he has after all been smacking the shit out of them in training. anyway I think there are more reasons to keep ghost alive than to just stab him especially if he was in the cage before the mutiny. My only problems with this episode were Dany's scenes being rushed .I have always liked Emilia Clarkes portrayal of Dany however last nights "I will answer injustice with justice Â " was cringe worthy to say the least and the scene with greyworm learning the common tongue was irritating and pointless. Whoever posted about the Queen of thorns saying "it was all the rage" thanks because now it really bugs me too. It's been a while since I was able to sit on the edge of my seat with the other viewers like I did the first season before I read the books so thanks for that D&D. I did laugh to myself during the Jaime and Tyrion scene because they are supposed to be brothers but their accents are nothing alike. I think Peter dinklage is great as Tyrion but his accent does veer off into the Austin powers impersonation territory .I had noticed that Tywin and Jaime have very similar accents perhaps they should of sent Peter dinklage to the same dialect coach or just sat him down with a boxset of everything Charles Dance has ever been in although They should really do that with every actor on the show to be fair.I am going to say it the Margery visiting Tommen in his bedroom scene was hot. I can just imagine what it would of been like for me at his age to have a hot woman like Margery coming to my bed at night and telling me that I will own her soon.It was made even more sexually charged by the Margery scene that preceded it with the Queen of Thorns stories of her sexploits and then encouraging Margery to do the same with Tommen. The reveal of the nights king at the end Transforming one of craster's babies into a white walker will have us all theorizing for months at least until the next book comes out *cough (after the end of this season)

213	Allison of Tarth	2014-04-28	It's an 8 for me.  The Meereen revolt was really rushed; I feel like it should have spanned a couple of episodes.  Dany's detached, "blood of the dragon" delivery is really tedious.
Loved the Ser Pounce cameo.  Tommen's sexy/creepy Marg encounter worked, I think, and his smile afterward was just perfect.  I can see why they recast him now.
I'm digging Locke and his storyline and kinda wishing he was in the books.  It did bug me that Jon couldn't mark him as a northman based on his speech or other clues.  Though maybe Locke is not originally from the north.
Karl drinking out of Mormont's perfectly clean and whitened skull was a bit much.  Could definitely have done without the gratuitous rape.
I'm sad that the show got to the Land of Always Winter first, but it's still awesome to see it and learn some more about the Others.
214	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-04-28	My favorite part was being surprised. I'm NOT going to fuss about being book-spoiled. It's a great trade off to have a few surprises on the show. I really dig taking slightly different paths to what I assume with still be the same overall story arch.
215	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-04-28	In my opinion this and episode 2 were the strongest so far of this season. Episode 1 was good but 3 was a fail by GOT standards for me at least.
Â 
LOVED Locke at the Wall and his interactions with Jon. Looking forward to that.
LOVED Ser Pounce. I hope he makes another appearance. On that note, I like this Tommen and his scenes in general.Â 
LOVED WW scene it was mind blowing as a book reader I was in complete shock because this is clearly a huge spoiler from winds of winter. I'm not surprised they turn the babies into WW i suspected that from the beginning I knew they didn't kill them.Â 
Â 
HATED the look of the so called 'Nights King' White Walker it was so CGI cartoonish like sci-fi. I felt like he belongs in Battlestar Galactica or something. I wish they made him more human-like and intriguing I dunno that was so eek.Â 
Â 
Overall tho amazing episodeÂ
216	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-28	+ Locke at the Wall
+ Jaime-Tyrion scene done well
+ Pod
+ Barristan being awesome as always
Â 
- Can Jorah like, get any screen time this season or?
- Karl... I didn't think anyone could be more annoying than Joffrey and Slynt. I was very wrong... Why they decided to add yet another facepalm-worthy character is beyond me. I guess it's to give Jon something to do while the Wildlings prepare and what-not.
- No Coldhands, but Dath Maul's ugly cousin made an appearance
Â 
+/- The last scene. Still dunno if I love it or hate it. A bit of both, I suppose.
Â 
Taking all that into consideration, I'd say an 8/10 - good time no alcohol required.
217	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-28	Oh wow. Great episode. Lots of epic scenes.
Â 
Loved the opening with Dany taking the city thanks to the slaves revolting. Strong scene with Grey Worm and Missandei too: I wanted it to go on for longer. There was chemistry between the two and it reminded us of their motivation for killing the Masters. Great location for the city as well.
Â 
Nitpick: no dragons! A dragon swooping down and perching on the harpy would have been perfect. Nitpick2: no blood when the slaves killed the master in the street! I miss the days when every death was gory. It's not just that it makes it exciting, but that it makes it more real, and reminds us what the stakes are, what death is.
Â 
Loved the scenes with Jaime. I thought Jaime was going to hit Bronn with his golden hand for a second, but it turned out the other way around. Don't think Jaime was ever a 'clean' fighter though, to judge by the way he stuck his dagger in Jory's eye. Great dialogue between him and Tyrion, although his excuse for not letting Tyrion go seemed a bit thin: surely, he should have just said they should wait until after the trial? Jaime and Cersei's scene was good. Cersei was really on form and convincing in her hatred of Tyrion. There was zero reference to the rape, but, if the idea is to forget that ever happened, I'm happy to go along. Nice to see Brienne sent off on a mission too since hanging around KL didn't suit her. Nitpicks? I seem to have included them all already.
Â 
Great scene again between LF and Sansa and particularly good acting from Sophie Turner. So good to see her showing some intelligence and gumption! And you could tell by her acting she knew what LF wanted from her - no more naivety.
Â 
Olenna and Margaery were great as always. I thought Margaery was going to jump Tommen's bones, especially after that speech by Olenna, but she stopped short. Is Tommen supposed to be a boy or a teenager? He seemed more like the latter until they brought Ser Pounce in.
Â 
Nitpick: when Tommen asks her how she got past the Kingsguard, her reaction is just 'Pfft! Kingsguard!'. Really??!
Â 
Interesting changes from the book at the Wall. Love it. They finally addressed what Jon knows about Bran and how he feels about it. Sam now regrets sending Gilly to a whorehouse in Molestown, as well he might.
Â 
Nitpick: Locke got there unbelievably fast and what's he planning to do all by himself (is he by himself?)?
Â 
Craster's ex-Keep was perhaps not quite on a par with the rest AFAIC. I love Burn Gorman, he was electrifying in Season 3, and it was good to see him back...but they've turned him into more of a cardboard cut-out bad guy. The constant raping seemed gratuitous, pornographic even. I don't know...would they really be doing that day after day after day? Not sure about Craster's women turning into devout White Walker cultists, not after they were all for saving Gilly's baby last time. And Rast may be scum, but even scum ought to hesitate before *sacrificing a baby*! It's only human. Nevertheless, despite my criticisms, the scenario worked for me on the whole and there are all sorts of interesting possibilities with Bran & co. It was dumb the way they got captured - and how come they had a wolf trap? and how come they kept Ghost alive? But it moves the plot along.
Â 
Epic scenery in the last scene, and good to see White Walkers again. Nitpick: that looked like some temple in the heart of winter, so how did he get there so fast?
Â 
Overall, my favourite episode so far, and bodes well for the rest of the season. I gave it a 10.

218	WITCHKING	2014-04-28	Worst episode ever...
219	raj34	2014-04-28	Its not fair to judge the show on how close it relates to the book. I have read all the books, and I personally want changes. If the show was 100% like the book it would be really boring for me to watch. The changes make it interesting to watch every week because I am not spoiled. People need to judge the show ON THE SHOW itself.Â 
Â 
I give this episode an 8, Jon Snow coming in contact with Bran will be very interesting. I kind of like how this is playing out compared to the books.Â 


Â 
To paraphrase Tyrion: If you want nuanced, intelligent, unbiased criticism of the show, you've come to the wrong place.
220	Robbie Hood	2014-04-28	I like not knowing what happens next. A great episode, it seems the only arguments against this episode is the fact no one knew what was coming and how it deviated from the books.
As the show starts to separate, under supervision from the tome holder himself, maybe it's time we started separating the two as viewers.Â
221	A Redeemed Hound	2014-04-28	I'd watch a show with just the adventures of Bronn, Tyrion, Pod, and Brienne all hanging out and going on adventures.Â  Would be a riot.
222	gotgrrrl	2014-04-28	I gave it a 9/10.Â  The episode would have gotten a lower score but for Ser Pounce!
Â 
I loved the way they handled Marg/Tommen.Â  Because neither has a POV in the books, it was nice to see how Marg was able to work on Tommen.Â  I think it will make for an interesting triangle (Marg-Tommen-Cercei).Â  I also really like the actor playing Tommen.Â 
Â 
Wasn't keen on Dany's taking down the Masters in Mareen -- it felt very rushed.Â  We see one Master being attacked and then it's over, really?Â 
Â 
Not sure how I feel about Bran's arc -- being captured at Crasters just seemed strange and I really didn't like how they just mention that Jon knows that Bran is alive.Â  What?Â  Seems like that is kind of big news to have delivered off-screen.Â  I also thought that Locke just hanging around when Jon and Sam were discussing Bran's whereabouts was a bit lazy.Â 
Â 
The WW reveal was surprising.Â  Happy to see more about them and their relationship with Craster's sons.Â 
Â 
Sad to see Olenna go.Â  Hope she makes her way back to KL but I don't think she's in any rush to do so.Â  Probably a good idea to get out of town given that she's just killed the King.Â  Finally, why was Olenna messing with Marg's necklace during their scene?Â  What is it about that necklace?Â
223	Gronzag	2014-04-28	I hate how they spoiled the booksÂ  Â . I'm not watching this show anymoreÂ
224	Ran	2014-04-28	408 votes, 7.93 average, 9 median, 8.15 normalized average.
225	Sun	2014-04-28	A 7.
Â 
A competent episode, well executed.
Â 
Dany's segment is a bore, but that the norm rather than the exception for Dany. Her final shot on top of the pyramid with that Targaryan banner above her was ominous. It didn't feel like something to celebrate, it felt like the idea behind that shot was to put a sense of dread into the audience. The shot had an eerie "pre-warÂ rise of the Nazi party" feel to me, which I thought was quite well done.Â Ofcourse it could all be my own projection.
Â 
Jaime's scenes were good, his scenes with Brienne being particularly lovely.Â 
Â 
Not sure where they're going with Bran being at Craster's. I'll decide if I like the change after I see how it plays out with Bran and Jon.
Â 
Locke, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with him.
Â 
The Night's King, and his retinue of 12... well that was new. 
Â 
Everything else was fine, nothing much deserving of comment.

Â 
I agree, I think for the average fanboy or fangirl it was a victory of sorts, but it was presented in a way that should be concerning, especially with Ser Barristan's reticence to crucify the slavers.Â
227	Eira Seren	2014-04-28	As the show starts to separate, under supervision from the tome holder himself, maybe it's time we started separating the two as viewers.


Â 
To what purpose?
Â 
I'm an avid book reader, and I've been ok with some of the changes and liked them.Â  The Bran stuff I don't (just like I didn't like the 'Dany in front of the gates of Qarth Sumai' crap), because I didn't think it was well done.Â  Someone that year defined Sumai as 'the cutting of one's hand for the sake of plot progression'.Â 
Â 
This felt the same, 'needlessly going out from undercover and getting caputured' for the sake of plot progression.

228	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-28	I gave this episode an 8/10, which was the highest score I've given for an episode yet this season.
The only two things that prevented this episode was the Locke situation and the Bran situation.
- I'm not sure how they're going to just throw in something as big as Locke looking for Bran and being quite close to that, and resolve it and still be faithful to the books. I'm not happy with the fact that Jon apparently knows Bran's general whereabouts - this is a big deviation for me from canon. Jon's feelings about his family drive a lot of his decisions.
- I don't like the Bran deviation either. How tf are they going to get out of there and with Summer's life intact as well? I guess we will see next Sunday.. I'm ok with filler for the sake of it as long as it doesn't affect OTHER storylines or anything from the books as far as canon... but this is not ok for me either.
- Daenerys's storyline is so boring this season in the show. I loved how she took Meereen in the books, and all of the drama with Jorah and Daario is just so downplayed here. Give my girl some drama and reason to even exist in this show, PLEASE. I am becoming very disappointed with the new Daario actor, even though I had expressed high hopes for him because I had liked him in other shows. The directors could have stretched out the taking of Meereen over at least two episodes, thereby providing "filler" for the show and explaining to Unsullied how it went down a lot better than I feel like they did.
I did love so much about this episode though, that I still feel like it was the best in the season. I loved being spoiled in a way... for me, all new information is good! It's been a long time since my jaw has dropped over learning something new about this world. I don't think that the situaton with the Others is deviating from the books. My boyfriend is currently reading AFFC for the first time and this episode contained spoilers for him from ADWD... so I expect to be spoiled soon enough as it is. Next season will be very interesting if we don't get TWOW beforehand. I will probably not watch it, and discontinue use of the forums until I can read the material first.
229	Nimm	2014-04-28	3/10
Â 
An otherwise workmanlike episode badly marred by everything to do with the North.Â 
Â 
Starting with the "who's with me slow stand," which was just agonizing, the rest of the mutineers/Castle Black segment was just IMO a string of nearly pointless shock value moments.Â Â  The whole thing felt lazy and overtly manipulative - OMG! He's drinking out a skull!Â Â  OMG!Â  They have Ghost, and they're feeding him human flesh!!!!Â Â  OMG! Nonstop rape everywhere!Â  OMG! More babies to give away!Â  OMG! A Stark in danger!Â  OMG! Seizure!Â  etc etc etc
Â 
It could be that the whole scene would have felt tense if it didn't also feel like it was an arbitrary and ultimately pointless detour designed to inject some contrived tension into Bran's storyline, without the potential for actual consequences.Â  Hope I'm wrong and something significant comes of it.
Â 
Â 
Also:Â 
* No Stannis
* Gray Worm playing footsie with Missandei.Â  Transforming him from a merciless killing robot into Gray Worm the nonthreatening orphan buddy isn't necessary.Â  We already liked him.
230	RadoLukacs	2014-04-28	9/10.
Let's say Bryan Cogman did the source material justice and most of the changes were actually to the better and more fit to a screen story-telling. The scene with Brienne's departure was beautifully shot and masterfully acted and I like that they took their time to show all the emotions and motivations of Jaime and Brienne. The taking of Meereen was fabulous, the way that Targaryen banner was hanging over the harpy of Meereen was a really good way to go. There has been a lot of set-up as well, but I think Cogman's writing improved what could otherwise be boring or uninteresting - I particularly liked the changes they did with Locke joining the Night's Watch, the mutineers, Bran's little company and Ghost (those direwolves are great). It almost feels like they really want to efficiently end some story lines in this season so they can move on in following seasons without it being too packed. Littlefinger was amazing, that scene explained what happened at the wedding in an interesting way. What also pleased me were the little references from the books that had been thought to get cut. The one thing I was unsure about was the ending with the White Walkers (not that I would complain about the CGI or any aspect of cinematography, but we can already see little, however vague, spoilers from unpublished books creeping in).
Â 
This was a very well-written and well-directed episode which gave us many important moments and some great action, while setting up some plot lines that needed to be set up before the real action arrives.
Â 
Â 
Episodes 1, 2, 3 and 4:Â Â  7;10;8;9/10.
231	tricky92	2014-04-28	One thing kinda irritated me, it's really a small thing and I'm definitely nitpicking, but when Olenna says "back when marrying TargaryensÂ was all the rage", I don't like the "all the rage" line, not fitting for the show at all.
Â 


Â 
Â 
I usually am not very nitpicky, but that line really stood out to me as well. Then, I tried to think of another way to convey her thoughts and felt like something else could have felt too contrived.
Â
232	Mikeygigs	2014-04-28	Didn't like it. The show has devolved from adaptation to poorly written fan-fiction. 3/10.Â 
Â 
Highlights:Â 
Other scene was real lame. Like really really lame. Worst thing in the entire series so far.Â 
The Craster's Keep crew was hilariously one-dimensional.
Bran getting captured...yawn.
How/why did they capture Ghost, and why didn't they kill him?
Margery...ugh...I immediately tune out when she's on screen. Just boring.Â 
Jon Snow scene wasn't bad until the cliche slow stand.
Uh...the hell is Roose Bolton's toady doing there? Okay, to kill Jon Snow, but...why join the Night's Watch? Take like 2-300 men to the wall and demand his head! Lame as hell, and lazy writing.Â 
Jamie and Cersei acting like nothing happened after the rape (might not have been meant that way, but the scene was shot that way).Â 
Grey Worm and Missandei Romance -- English teaching bs. Lame. The guy is eunuch from early childhood, what exactly is the appeal of a woman?
Some things I liked:Â 
Jon Snow's scenes until the cliche standing crap.Â 
Direwolves are back on screen, though pretty damn useless as ever. Still, nice to see them.Â 
Danearys' scene was passable, but a little too quick, but we're going to see that she's a pretty awful ruler from now, I hope.
The Littlefinger scene was meh. I don't believe he had Jeoffrey killed and only said it to screw with Sansa. If true it only further makes his character into the one-dimensional "Dick Dastardly" mustache twirler the show-runners envision him as.Â
233	The Killer Snark	2014-04-28	I'm sorry to keep on bringing this up, but is there any possibility at some point D and D are going to at least mention major villain (not on the show, though) Greg Clegane?
234	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-28	10/10.
Â 
1. Daenerys bit was outstanding. Her scene with Selmy and the look in the old knight's eyes when she said she would answer justice with justice and he began to worry whether he has been witnessing another Aerys in the making, was beyond great. The last scene with the great pyramid overshadowed by Targaryen flag and ominous sky and her standing alone was, imho, homage to Leny Riefenstahl and "Trymph of the Will". Epic and ominous.
2. Olenna/Marg excellent
3. Marg/Tommen outstanding. Great acting on Dean-Charles Chapman's part. Subtle and emotional. He managed to introduce his character in one scene. That's way beyond his years. Great talent.
4. Cersei/Jaime rift widens. Two great actors. Everything is in the eyes.
5. Jaime/Brienne was almost my favourite part, but the Others trump all. Emotional, moving, deep, meaningful. Superb acting. Even Bronn and Pod as sidekicks could not reduce the electrical charge.
6. Locke is my favourite psychopath on the show right now. NW scenes immaculate.Â 
7. Crasters keep - Sodom and Gomorra. Brilliant.
8. The Others - that goes way beyond epic. Great spoiler. Answers some questions, opens thousands more. Visually, it was more than viewers could hope for.
Â 
Finally, my cap goes down to direction. Unlike episode 2 that had serious problems with continuity, this one is a directorial masterpiece. I bow to Michelle MacLaren.Â

235	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-28	I hate how they spoiled the booksÂ  Â . I'm not watching this show anymoreÂ  


Â 
At some point they're going to have to spoil the books, so I'd suggest you quit watching sooner rather than later if that's going to bother you.
Â 
Having said that, since there's no possible way you can logically articulate what they allegedly "spoiled" already I'd also suggest that the folks complaining are doing so simply for the sake of doing so.

237	of man and wolf	2014-04-28	I have to say seeing Ghost caged up baffles me. How the hell did those hacks, who couldnt fight themselves out of a wet paper bag, manage to capture that huge beast?
Â 
At least we know they're too stupid to actually try killing him, so we'll hopefully get to watch Ghost(and Summer) tear some of them to pieces.
Â 
As for the guy asking why Roose doesnt send hundreds of guys to the wall to get at Jon, rather then just Locke...quite simple. They wanna secretly figure out where Bran and Rickon may have went, and for that it requires a bit of stealth. Roose doesnt want more people from the North knowing there are more Starks still around, lest they flock to their side. And as for Jon, he's a member of the NW. They cant just take his head.
238	rmholt	2014-04-28	Am I the only one who did NOT like this episode at all?
Â 
...
Â 
The final scene - a waste of screentime! The tiny Ice-Stonehenge was a joke, and the most interesting thing with the Walkers - nobody knows what they are, from where they are, and what they want - is spoiled
Â 
The first time I'm disappointed by the show!

239	yushkevitch	2014-04-28	I think some of you have are so enamored with the show you've lost all sense of perspective and objectivity. Browsing through some of the responses of those that loved this episode I am left shaking my head. Are you the same people keeping that abomination of a show The Walking Dead on air?Â  
Â 
A few examples:
Â 
- Glowing about Chapman's acting as Tommen. People, all he did was sit in his bed and look shy. Really, that's not Emmy award winning stuff there.
Â 
- The scene at Caster's was brutal. Nimm's response (a few above mine) is bang on. It was way too much and the brutality was not necessary. Unless this plot arc has huge implications that we don't know of we didn't need to see all that.Â 
Â 
- The chemistry between Pod and Brienne. I must have missed something there, they were together all of about 15 seconds and the only interaction between them was Pod calling her "sir" (or "sire", or whatever). I'm sure they'll be great but let it happen first 
Â 
- Littlefinger, the man who is constantly scheming behind the scenes decides to tell Sansa - the person he's done his best to show he's a conniving weasel - that he murdered the king. People, Petr didn't get to were he is by flapping his gums and bragging. He works in the shadows, he keeps his true intentions hidden. He doesn't tell some 13-year-old (or she 14 now? 12?) his whole master plan. I'm glad they dealt with the mystery of Joff's murder in one respect but this scene didn't make any sense.
Â 
On the plus side the surprise ending with The Others was, well, a surprise. Though I would be much happier if we got an update on the army of them that's been strolling south since S2. They could probably use Google Maps.

242	Antoinetta	2014-04-28	I really liked this episode. I like how they are showing Jaime coming back to King's Landing and it's not the warmest of welcomes. He's put in a really difficult position between the woman he loves, the brother he loves and loyalty to his family. It's predictament for sure.

Â 
Littlefinger has almost the same exact conversation with Sansa in the books. It's like really almost verbatim so how's that for making sense?
Â 
Chapman did a fine job. He was a recast and people were concerned about his acting ability, but moreso that a 16 year old kid could seem so naive and innocent. He conveyed that very well without saying much, which isn't exactly easy. No one is saying he's the best actor in the world, just that they were pleased with his performance.
Â 
Pod is just happy to be a squire and people are happy that he called her Ser, my lady like he does in the books because it was funny. So far Pod hadn't shown to be completely at a loss for words so it was nice to see a little call on the books.
Â 
You have a legitimate gripe with Craster's scene.Â
244	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-04-28	I just don't like that Bran was revealed last episode by Theon and this time by himself. I was also hoping the warg tunnel vision effect was not going to be standard for those instances. It is cheesy! And....THEY STABBED HODOR who was chained up! Terrible! 
On the flip side....Marg was brilliant with Tommen. I loved the scene with Jaime and Tyrion. Agreed that Dany was rushed, but I thought it was effective. I wished we saw more of her and Sansa. I love show Littlefinger.
245	Tywin Smokin a Blunt	2014-04-28	Strong 8 bordering on 9. Â I like that they had Dany at the beginning to get her out of the way. Â I hate it when you look the clock and realize that it's 45 minutes past the hour and you just know they're going to close out with Emilia making some boring diatribe with that stupid smug look on her face...
Â 
The violent stuff at Craster's was pretty lame, IMO. Â I hate caricatures like Karl who are evil for no reason other than 'because they're evil'. Â GRRM knows how to build a true character, D&D still have no freaking clue.
Â 
Everything outside of Dany and Craster's was top-notch.how is he evil for no reason?  He's not necessarily evil at all, he's just reveling in the fact that for the first time in his life, he's the one giving orders rather than taking them.
246	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-28	how is he evil for no reason? He's not necessarily evil at all, he's just reveling in the fact that for the first time in his life, he's the one giving orders rather than taking them.


Â 
He's drinking from the skull of his former commander, ordering his men to rape women 'till they're dead, sacrificing babies to ice monsters, feeding a giant direwolf for no apparent reason, and braging about how he can kill anyone.
Â 
If that's not a cardboard villain I dunno what is.
247	sifth	2014-04-28	Most people seem to be complaining about the Bran plot above all else. Well what did you honestly expect? Bran has literally two more chapters from the book that have not been put on tv yet. I assume you all thought they would just air those final two chapters and never show Bran again, until George finishes the next book.............which is still likely years away if A Dance with Dragons is any implication. This is not how tv works.
Â 
If George wants to ignore Bran for most of his 5th book he has a right to, if he wants to ignore The Others/White Walkers for that book, he has that right too. On tv however you can't just ignore your main characters and plot points for an entire season or 2 and expect your audience to remember who they are. This is why we had Theon on tv last year, unlike in the books where he was written out of the story for two entire novels.

249	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-28	I'll give it a 7. Jaime and Tyrion's scene made the episode for me , the rest I found good except for the NightWatch mutineers which I found cliched. I also liked that we saw more of the Others ( it has been three seasons, so as far as lil'ol' me is concerned, it's about time).
Also, no Alex Graves as director. I do believe that he knew that that was a rape scene that he directed last ep but apparently, it was rape meant to be shrugged off.
Ass.

Yeah, but the Theon stuff was at least extrapolated from the books -- Bran's scenes were just low-grade fanfic. Â I'm not objecting to D&D adding stuff that fits with the story if they need to give the actors screen time, but what we got was (IMO, obviously) garbage. Â I'd have rather seen the scene with The Little, maybe some mention of The Knight of the Laughing Tree, but getting stupidly captured by the new crew at Craster's Playhouse was lame.

Â 
So you'd rather just have Bran, Hodor and the Reed's sit around a camp fire telling stories, who only book readers would understand the deeper meaning of. Remember tv and books are two very different beasts as most people seem to forget. I have a lot of friends who watch the show and don't read the books and they have a very hard time keeping track of every character. I doubt any of them would remember who Bran's aunt was; though as a book reader I suppose you'd be able to laugh at the tv for being able to understand the deeper meaning of the story, while the causal viewer would wondered what the point of the story was.
Â 
Many of my friends wondered the same thing when Robert, Jamie and Barristan were telling war stories to each other in season 1.
Â 
Also if you view any scene that D & D write that George did not as fan fic, well you must also view nearly half the show as fan fic at this point.

I'm not a book purist if that's what you mean. Â I've liked a lot of what's been added or modified to make the books fit, especially Theon's arc last season. Â I specifically don't like the "new" scenes in Ep04, and I think they are horrible because they suck, not just because they aren't in the books. Â I think the book scenes I mentioned were skipped for a good reason (they wouldn't make for good tv), just that *even so*, they would have been better than the schlock we got.
254	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-28	Said this before - 10/10. Â I gave last episode a 5/10. Â

Â 
Loved everything North.Â

That's because Joffrey has been around longer and was the first psycho in my GOT life. That said, Karl was highly-entertaining, though he is obviously not in any position to keep it going.

And which point was that? I wasn't responding to you, so I'm confused.

Best scene for me this time: Jaime and Brienne!
260	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-29	It was the best episode of the season so far. I gave it a strong 8/10.

And the last fifteen minutes or so were perfect in creating and sustaining a level ofÂ audience dread and discomfort. And then the payoff came completely out of left field with that awesome WW ending. They've sure livened up Bran's storyline and found a decent way to add material to Jon's.

Sure. These are the things that bugged me most:
- The guy who plays Littlefinger, his acting has become atrocious. His accent changes from episode to episode. He needs to chill the fuck out.
- I'm bored of Sansa making her doe eyes. Although there is a small hint that she is going to start picking up how to be a masterclass bitch soon.
- Jaime's character is all fucking wrong now. Because of last week's rape scene and this week's Bring me Sansa's head on a plate invented scene, it looks like he's sending Brienne off to do his dirty work for him. The significance of the Oathkeeper is lost.
- Emilia Clarke only has one facial expression.
- Bran meets the traitors? Why? Why? Why? Adding scenes to make things better is fine but I found it to be useless. Let's add some drama pointlessly sort of thing.
- The easy reveal that QoT was behind the murder. Pointless. Well, except for making Margaery Tyrell look completely clueless.
- The completely fake scene where Jon reveals he knows that Bran is beyond the wall because , I guess, Sam told him. Push your shit plot forward D&D. Push it. Till it hurts.
The one good scene here was the Margaery & Tommen bed scene. That's as far as I would go. And even that was dumb because she got past the Kingsguard way too easily.
270	boojam	2014-04-29	- Daenerys's storyline is so boring this season in the show. I loved how she took Meereen in the books, and all of the drama with Jorah and Daario is just so downplayed here. Give my girl some drama and reason to even exist in this show, PLEASE. I am becoming very disappointed with the new Daario actor, even though I had expressed high hopes for him because I had liked him in other shows. The directors could have stretched out the taking of Meereen over at least two episodes, thereby providing "filler" for the show and explaining to Unsullied how it went down a lot better than I feel like they did.No I like Michiel Huisman as Daario, only trouble is even tho he's in episode 1 and 3 , and 4 yeah have to look hard to see him I think he has only had lines in E3!
271	Daske	2014-04-29	9/10 from me. Other episodes reached greater heights, but this was one of the few episodes that kept me completely gripped from beginning to end.
272	Mr Fixit	2014-04-29	A great episode, no doubt about it. Bryan Cogman delivers his best, as usual.
Â 
I like how focused Season 4 has proven to be so far. D&D aren't afraid to leave characters off-screen for multiple episodes which results in a tighter narrative with more forward momentum. Dany's conquest of Meereen was brief but very effective. I like Grey Worm's increased prominence and the way the show made him our viewpoint into the slave revolt. King's Landing was great as well, but Jaime was the man of the hour here. He was served very well by Cogman's script: his scenes with Bronn, Tyrion, Cersei, and Brienne were of exceedingly high quality. I must say I really like the Wall storyline this year in a way I haven't since Season 1. Kit Harington's new&improved Jon Snow is a welcome sight and it's easy to see why so many black brothers would choose to follow this guy. Bran's story deviation has me quite interested; I like not being sure how it'll play out. Will Jon meet him next Sunday or will Bran's little band manage to slip away while the Night's Watch raiding party keeps the mutineers occupied? The last scene of the episode was such a great moment. It's easy to forget, even with all the dragons and direwolves, that this is a fantasy show. It's nice when the show reminds how truly alien and mysterious things are going to get down the road.
Â 
A very strong 9.

Mel's one POV suggests she sees them as good, vs Children/BR but her vision interpretations are questionable. It's the wights who do the bad things. Of course the WW create and command wights. Maybe they think they have good reasons. The books are full of unintended consequences from people acting on erroneous information or assumptions. So who knows?
277	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-29	Gave it a 5.
Â 
The first half of the episode was really good, the second half was a bit boring. I don't mind so much if the show makes little changes, but Jon knowing that Bran is still alive and Bran being captured by the mutineers is a bit too much (but that's just my personal opinion ofc).
Â 
Hooray for the appearance of Ser Pounce though!
278	sifth	2014-04-29	People seem to be calling the Night's Watch traitors cartoonishly evil, but forget that George himself has created plenty of characters who are as well. The Mountain, Vargo Hoat and the Murmmers, The Boltons, pretty much every enemy Dany has in Slavers Bay.
Â 
Â 
So if GRRM creates a one sided villain it's alright, but if D & D do it there's whining. Can anyone say double standard, lol

And again, it's 2 entirely different things to have vague references to a cardboard villain off doing misdeeds compared to a moron standing over a campfire beating his chest in a lame attempt to infuse dramatic tension. Â I'm not a D&D hater by any means, but that scene was incredibly lame and poorly conceived - anyone unwilling to admit that is simply being a D&D apologist.

We've seen the Mountain do plenty of horrible things on page, The Mummers and Boltons too. So this comment only really applies to villains over at Slavers Bay, IMO

The Mountain applies perfectly.
Â 
Season 1, we hear about his misdeeds in the Riverlands which prompts Eddard to act on his negative feeling toward the Lannisters ultimately leading to his downfall. Â Is Clegane's contribution somewhat contrived? Â Sure. Â Does it feel feel cheap? Â No. Â Why not? Â Because it's only an element of the puzzle and GRRM actually knows how to drive a story forward without relying on artificial tension.
Â 
In the case at hand, we have some douchebag who no one recognizes reciting lame dialogue about his misdeeds for the obvious purpose of making us hate him before he and his band of rebels meet up with Jon's band of Brothers. Â Does it feel cheap? Â Yes. Â Why? Â Because it's hack writing artificially inserting garbage to substitute as tension. Â It's the rough equivalent of playing a pop song at the end of a RomCom as a substitute for the emotional connection the script failed to make.

We also see that same character chop off the head of a horse and try to murder the son of the second most powerful man in the kingdom. What you stated above felt unbelievably cheap on the show. GRRM has said many times that one of the big flaws of season 1 was they couldn't show any real battles.

Whether or not it's shown on screen isn't even a little bit the point.
Â 
The point is: "Hi, I'm a bad guy, let me do a few ridiculous things to show you I'm a bad guy while I talk about all of the terrible things I've done to let you know I'm a bad guy so that you instantly hate me and can be happy when a good guy eventually shows up and kills me" is pretty much the most superficial, lame-ass writing imaginable. Â They've did it to introduce the Thenns, and now they've done it with Kirk (or whatever his name is).
Â 
No one is trying to kill The Mountain because he decapitated a horse. Â Oberyn wants to kill The Mountain (sort of) because of events which occurred before the books and which we've heard about through natural means, not Gregor standing over a fire and beating his chest bragging about murdering Elia and her children. Â Similarly, his criminal acts in the Riverlands were parenthetical as related to the actual story. Â That tension was created by Jaime acting to protect Tyrion which conflicted with Ned acting to protect Cat, who was acting to avenge her son. Â All The Mountain provided was some measure of moral justification for Ned to do what he wanted to do anyway, which was act out against the Lannisters. Â That tangential influence is night-and-day from what we're talking about at Craster's.
Â 
Good writing is believable characters committing understandable acts which naturally creates conflict with each other. Â That's why, in the best storytelling, both the good and bad guys justifiably believe they're on the side of the angels. Â That's also why ASOIAF has so many "grey" characters - because GRRM is brilliant with the establishment and interplay of many separate "worlds", and it rarely manifests itself as 'on the nose' as pretty much everything D&D have contributed so far this season.

Which is exactly what GRRM did with The Mountain, when he was first introduced.

285	The Bastard of Walton	2014-04-29	The whole Bran part ruined the episode for me. Until that point I thought it was good, but I really don't understand why they made such a massive change. Seemed pointless. I understand that some parts have to be slightly altered but this was completely pointless & senseless. These deserters would simply kill Bran,Jojen &Hodor, & Then brutally treat Meera. Pointless, worst change since the whole Dagmar acts as Reek moment.
Â 
As for the whole Darth Maul of the Others moment, that reveal has made the series & books very clichA© for me. The "Great" Other vs Dany on a Dragon has always made for dull reading & watching. Seems that's the way its going to happen now though. What a Shame.

And why is that? Only an idiot would kill the last freaking Stark of Winterfell in existence (Rickon being gone who knows where, might even be dead by now). You don't kill him, you use him as leverage if it comes to that. This boy could be the mutineer's ticket home, if they play it right.

People could really think things through before moaning about e.v.e.r.y s.i.n.g.l.e. change from the books.

Har de har har. 
Do you write your own material?
292	Juanis66	2014-04-29	The episode was developing betweenÂ 8 andÂ 9 to me but starting with the BranÂ meet crows rebel section and ending with the pathetic and terrible mix between a frozen Darth Maul at a frozen Stonehenge my rating collapsed to 5.
IÂ want to believeÂ it wasn't the original idea of GRRM about the truth of the WW (still veiled on the books) but the influence (bad) of HBO.
Very dissapointed and a little bit pessimistic for the rest of the seasson.
I was waiting for this kind of stuff to the moment when the episodes reach the last published book (ADwD), but no so early.
293	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-29	ALRIGHT EVERYBODY MY OPINION IS THE BEST BECAUSE I AM ME AND ALSO I'M THE BEST!
Â 
Caps lock off...
Â 
Jaime and Brienne- very touching scenes here and there, especially at their departure. I thought some of the dialogue was clunky and missed the mark. Also, I'm pretty sure Jaime names Oathkeeper, but it was sweet coming from Brienne.
Sansa and Littlefinger- Not much to say about this scene. It was all exposition. I assume they are revealing the culprits behind Joffrey's assassination so that the viewers can be sure that Tyrion is the good guy.
Marg and QoT- This was interesting and important character work. I will miss the Queen of Thorns.
Marg and Tommen- Very, very sexy from Marg. They have upped Tommen's age to make Marg's work on him clearly sensual. This is working very well so far and makes for great viewing. The Tommen actor did nice work.
Jaime and Tyrion- I can't really think of anything that happened here of import. Character development that hints at future actions from Jaime later. Let's not let there be any surprises for the viewers, now! Viewers are dumb, and must have things spelled out for them. We are smarter because we are from Hollywood and Hollywood is the best and that makes us the best!
Oh shit I forgot about Dany- They wanna complain that they need filler to fix their fucked up time gaps, but they rush so many events that I just assume they are dumb and think they can do better than source material. This part was entertaining, but overly simplified and rushed. Dany is starting to suck. Barristan had an epic moment. Where was Daario? Why doesn't Jorah get lines?
The hell is going on at the Wall?- So basically everything going on at the Wall is filler because they fucked up the timeline and positively CAN'T have the big epic battle for the Wall happen before episode 9 of the season. NOOOOOO WAY! Not all of it is boring, but it is dumb. Everyone's reason for doing anything is dumb. I don't even want to spell it out. None of it makes any sense and makes all of the NW characters seem like idiots.Â 
The clown-ass Other thing- Now, I don't like this scene, and not because it is a "spoiler" (but it isn't really, its just kinda another spelling things out to viewers because they think the audience is dumb and needs to be told this). The reason this is a bad scene is basically the reason that pretty every horror movie falls on its face. Horror comes from a lack of understanding and mystery. The White Walkers are scary in the books because we never see them. Deciding that you have to explain the mystery behind them before they even do anything in the show destroys the mystery behind them. Once we understand the WW, we no longer have any need to fear them. We now know what they do with the babies and it is nowhere near as horrible as what our imaginations predicted. You have now humanized the White Walkers. Good job. They are officially no longer a scary, otherworldly entity.Â 
Also, that Other's make-up looked like shit! Freakin' power rangers material there. Who decided that looked appropriate at all for Game of Thrones?
Â 
I'll rate this episode a 7/10 because everything but the Wall and North was enjoyable and made sense.
Â
294	rmholt	2014-04-29	On second view I give it a 9. There was a lot of stage-setting but they made it interesting at worst and mindblowing at best.  Margaery-Tommen was perfect. Everyone was in character.

Â 
You know what would've been better is if we never actually see any of them, books or show. Even at the end of the last book if we had never encountered one it would've been so mysterious and thrilling! Brilliant! You should write to GRRM and tell him make sure you don't give away any details at all about the Others and omit them entirely so that we can just use our imaginations instead.
296	Ser Shaft of Hightower	2014-04-29	I liked the Jaime/Brienne/Tyrion and Sansa/LF scenes. The ending with the Walker(s) was also cinematic and ...appropriately chilling.
Â 
But all in all, this was the weakest, most confused episode of the entire series.
Â 
Jon AND Bran going to Crasters... wtf. Talk about wonky plotting.
Where in the hell are the Thenns and other so-called wildling "threats"?
It sure is taking a long time for them to get there, since Jon has apparently completely healed since having to "hurry and warn everyone" about the "imminent wildling threat" bearing down on The Wall since... last season.
Â 
Margeary and Tommen. Er, there's nothing to see here, folks.
Â 
The Missande+Grey Worm no-mance. Never mind the Jorah and Barristan banishment by Dany subplot; we need to focus on these two and their foreplay to nowhere!
Â 
The sacking of Mereen was grossly oversimplified into an eye-for-an-eye, one and done affair

Â 
Exactly. They've done a very poor job with matching everyone's journeys to converge at appropriate moments. Now, there's all these convoluted plots being made up in order to give the characters something to do. That's what makes it filler. And filler is never good unless its in a twinkie.Â
298	error303	2014-04-29	6 from me. Lots of good setup, dialgoe, well acted and scripted, did all the essentials right, good adaptation and changes from book to show, and all that fun stuff.
Â 
Really annoyed at how they glossed over the tacking of Mereen. Lots of setup spent on Greyworm rallying the slaves, sowing dissent, and all that, and then you get to see one guy in an empty ally attacked by maybe two dozen slaves and then cut to "Danny wins again!" Show me three days of chaos and madness in the streets. I hope they do the Seige better (and I think they will).
Â 
Not to rehash the Jaime/Cersei "that scene", but if they wanted to make it rape, make it rape, as Jaime can totally be a character who does both really noble and really terrible things. If they don't want it to be rape, they really ought take a hard look at how it was directed, acted, and edited, because in no way does it come off as it's written in the book. But then if they do go with the Jaime is a really bad person and raped Cersei angle, it's so hard to have any other scene with those two characters together. Honestly, Cersei in both the book and the show would have her rapist dead in his sleep. That one scence just mucked up the character dynamics so bad for me.
Â 
The whole "let's go murder some deserters because they might share information with some one who may or may already know (Mance being part of the Night's Watch and seemingly already knowing their rough numbers any) and may or may not murder them on sight anyway (as at that point the Wildling's probbalyhave a plan of attack and don't want to drag around prisonsers or take time for any fun intelligence gathering). It just seems like a totally boneheaded decision for Jon to make, even if he has some secret motivation to maybe perhaps luck in to finding Bran somewhere North of the wall.
Â 
But, again, overly a solid episode, I like the off-book stuff and I think they did some good setup for coming episodes. Just three big pieces I didn't like and stuck in my head more than maybe they should be.
299	Mr Fixit	2014-04-29	I suggest people look up the meaning of "filler". It doesn't mean "not in the books". The sooner you get it, the better.
300	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-29	I suggest people look up the meaning of "filler". It doesn't mean "not in the books". The sooner you get it, the better.


Â 
As much as I appreciate arrogance and condescension, in this case it kind of does mean that.
Â 
D&D have professed a desire to stay true to the books. Â Ergo, anything they add will either [A] break that promise by leading a storyline to a different outcome, or [B]Â do nothing to advance any of the storylines and thus constitute filler.
Â 
The only real exception would be the revealing of upcoming book elements to which they've been privileged, but I'm guessing that's not the nature of the 'filler' complaints to which you refer.

301	GeorgeIAF	2014-04-29	Really enjoyed it, gave it a 9.
302	basilisk312	2014-04-29	sunday nite i wasn't thrilled with it... i watched again and the 2nd viewing made me change my mind... i give it a 7, tho i'm still confused as to how the bran/jon meeting, assuming there is one, plays out... and how locke's presence affects things
Â 
i also don't know yet how the crucifixions will be viewed down the line... all in all, it was better the 2nd time around
303	jarkody	2014-04-29	Hmm I'm really not liking where the Bran story I'd going. It seems as though they altered it to make him seem relevant, but that might come back to bite them. Either that or it ends up being a small detour as Ghost and Summer free them. Still, not a fan of it.
Decent episode otherwise. And Craster's sons...become Others. I wasn't expecting to find that out from the show.


I agree. I don't like to see them change the story lines so much that it affects the major events yet still to come. The show is mostly good but since I read all the books I get disappointed when they add extra stuff that doesn't make sense and take important things away. Like where is Strong Belwas and why are they even wasting time with Grey Worm and Missandei having some kind of date in the middle of battle?Â
304	Ran	2014-04-29	540 votes in, 7.82 average, 9 median, 8.03 normalized average.
305	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-04-29	I gave this one a 9, and count me in the camp that enjoyed the changes! Â I also found some of the artistic touches compelling in this episode. Â For instance, our very first image was fire , and the last one was ice when the baby's eyes cracked as the blue came into them. Â I enjoy little things like that as I'm a bit of a technical whore. Â If Thrones was judged purely on its production values it would be a 10 most weeks.
Â 
I also wonder whether anyone else caught the rather obvious Third Reich iconography of Dany standing on a very Albert Spier-type structure with the huge red and black banner draped over the Harpy's wings? Â To me that was perhaps the most subtle spoiler of all. Â I think Dany is going down at the end  Â But of course, I could be reading way too much into it - I have been known......
Â 
My own little crackpot from last night's frosty Darth Maul was that he is Coldhands - because he was KIND, dammit! Â He was kind. Â I loved him. Â I am still hoping we get Coldhands. Â 
Â 
Now I've got that out of the way....
Â 
Liked:
Meereen - surprisingly. Â Being a huge fan of Dany in the books, I had got fed up of her in the show, but I think last night was helped by Grey Worm and Missandei discussing how they were taken as slaves, thus humanising the scene somewhat. Â I see that others have said they felt the taking of Meereen was rushed, but I don't really agree with this. Â Obviously due to time constraints and budget we couldn't have a huge amount of time spent on it, and I think they conveyed the main points. Â The crucifixions were brutal, and especially following them up with that silent Nazi image spoke volumes to me about the negative side of Dany's conquering. Â I think it was efficient and ecomonically done, and I take my hat off to the director and producers for this.
Â 
Jaime/Brienne - Gwen Christie and Nikolaj were nothing short of magnificent in this scene. Â And after all the furore of the Rapegate last week, again we saw Jaime's honourable side AS LONG AS HE IS AWAY FROM CERSEI. Â I am convinced of this (both in the books and the show). Â He is a better person as soon as he is away from her. Â I think, ham-fisted though it was, this is what the showrunners tried to convey last week with the grotesque scene in the sept.
Â 
Jaime/Tyrion - again, a beautifully portrayed intimate scene between the Lannister lads. Â Again, I rather liked the shaft of light that symbolically shone through the cell window, which divided Tyrion and Jaime - yet another hint of what is to come.
Â 
Marg/Tommen - creepy as it was, this was well-played by both, and the set was perfectly lit for it. Â And we got Ser Pounce, so I had a little squee (it doesn't take much to please this book reader).
Â 
All the Wall this week - Kit is certainly coming into his own now, and so is Jon. Â I didn't mind the cliched Spartacus stand - big glossy TV shows are full of cliches, and this one at least had the twist of Locke standing up too, to put a spanner in the works. Â So it took the edge off a mawkish moment. Â Again, it wasn't too heavy-handed for me. Â And let me say here what an improvement Locke is over Vargo Hoat (who I loathed with a passion).
Â 
Didn't like as much:
Marg/Olenna - although we had a nice segue into this with LF's 'grow strong' line, and the scene itself was decently shot, I did get a feeling of things moving way too fast. Â The reveal of LF's and Olenna's collaboration in Joff's death could have been left for later, but that is a small nitpick, and I think I know why they did it: purely so the viewers will now worry whether Sansa is in even more danger. Â I know I worried about that in the books!
Â 
LF/Sansa - I enjoyed Sansa's questioning, but there again, things seem to have dawned on her very quickly indeed. Â Her character has spent so long holding her tongue and being terrified, now she becomes ungarded in front of Littlefinger. Â It just felt like quite a plot leap. Â I shall not comment on our Aiden.......
Â 
Karl the Twat - He overplayed this somewhat, and even I - who can take an awful lot of violence, swearing, blood gore and whatever you like to throw at me - got sickened to death by the rapes and Karl's potty mouth.
Â 
However, I was truly outraged when he hit Bran and when Meera was bashed! Â I don't quite know how Bran is going to get out of this predicament, but I sure as heck don;t want him to come face to face with Jon just yet! Â But let's see how it goes.
Â 
But it still gets a 9 overall, as I was vastly entertained throughout, and I am now firmly on Team Other

My first reads of Feast -and to a lesser extent Dance- were disappointing, in a "i need to know what happens next" sense.
Sure, it all feels of sightseeing after the thrills of aSoS, but then with 2 books to go yet, what wouldn't?
Â 
However, upon further readings, the plot development and in particular the writing throughout aFfC & aDwD are amongst the most savory of all. Apart from characters we already know, there's the The Red Priest+ a Melisandre POV, the brilliant Saltpans chapters, intro to more Tyrells, Martells and Gerold Dayne.
Danaerys' discontent in Mereen is hardly "filler"; it is key to where her character is headed. She's a teenage conquerer with all the difficulties this involves, after all, not just some fantasy princess waiting to ride in on her dragon to save the day.
Â 
Â 
We're not bitching, anyways. It's just noticing something that the writers apparently thought we wouldn't, and that's discouraging.

308	Jambottle Jeebus	2014-04-29	9/10. I like that they are adding more scenes of Jon and Bran...Â  This show is by far the best show ever. I hate when people pick it apart . Just enjoy it , people!
309	Carey Snow	2014-04-29	WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. Â 9/10 because 10 is reserved for the Baelors and Blackwaters.
Â 
The ONLY gripes I have are...
- Why did the slaves write "KILL THE MASTERS" in the Common Tongue?? Â Unless Grey Worm wrote it?
- Where did Dany get that giant dragon banner?
Â 
Everything else was either good or PERFECT.


Lol... I would assume that Dany has some weavers somewhere in her thousands of followers. They are all wearing clothes after all. I thought that banner looked awesome and dark especially right after the crucificixion of the good masters. Dany showing her dark side, love the Mother of Dragons!
Â 
I did not enjoy Caster's Keep and Ghost somehow being captured by those weaklings. Ghost would tear those fools apart. It would have been better just to have him howling in the background and making the mutineers afraid to go outside or something. And then attacking with Summer when Jon shows up with his boys to lay the hammer down.
Â 
Also Caster's keep seemed especially brutal and I am not sure that the show runners need to add more brutality than Martin already thought up. Martin is able to weave it into the story, the show runner's brutality tends to come across as just done for shock value. Reminded me of Jofferey killing Roz. Not needed.
Â 
What is going on with the others? That is not how I pictured them in the novels at all. Creating others with human babies? Maybe this is where Martin is going, or maybe this was made for TV and will be different than the books.
Â 
Otherwise good episode. I really like the Margaery/Tommen exchange even though not in the books. Sansa/Little finger is perfect and I am glad they are allowing Sophie to speak more and act more. Dany was great. Not sure how they are going to make Jon/Bran work. Will Bran convince Jon that the three eyed crow is more important than the heir of Winterfell? That is a tough sale may friends.
Â 
7 for me.

310	edgeroc	2014-04-29	I gave it a solid 7. I really dig episodes directed by Michelle Mcclaren. Last season second sons was my personal favorite episode. The scene with Stanis and Sir Davros talking in the dungeon was one of my favorite scenes in the entire run of the show. This one had decent similar dialogue scenes I enjoyed.
Â 
Jaime and Briann was a very good scene as was Jaime and Tyrion.Â 
Â 
Every scene with Jon was good in this one. Kit has really stepped his game up and it shows.
Â 
Sansa and LF had a decent scene as well I thought
Â 
I agree with many here that the Crastor's keep scenes were just over the top and seemed to drag for a long time. Karl is a crazy guy I get it, but just hearing him rant over and over again got old real quick.
Â 
Liking the Night's Watch dynamic. The look on the acting Lord Commander's face when the men started standing up was priceless. Amazing how actors in this show can convey such an array of emotion with one look.
Â 
Going to stick with the 7, would have been higher with some more Lord Tywin and Lord Bolton. Of all the characters in this show, both of these actors steal every single scene they are in.
Â 
Not a book reader so sorry if I butchered some names.

311	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-29	I've seen on a few podcasts, chats, forums on which the question of 'where did Dany get her giant banner from?' is asked and a popular response seems to be that it's from the sail on her ship. Which i guess would just beg the same question of how did she get a Targ sail made too?
Â 
Does anyone have any evidence to support or refute that?

Â 
Â 
She has thousands of people following her. It would only take one to plan the decoration of the flag, then find others to help create it. They just sacked a city, I am sure they have some cloth and thread.
Â 
But they prob should of had a Betsy Ross moment and showed a lady making the flag with the Targ anthem in the background.

314	Goldfinger	2014-04-29	interesting episode
9
315	DolorousKim	2014-04-29	I really enjoyed this episode; it delivered under both the character development and the plot development categories in a very satisfying manner.Â  The hour was over faster than I could believe, and the episode gave me both answers to some long-running questions as well as some new developments and possibilities to ponder.Â  I scored it as a nine.
Â 
What worked for me:
Â 
Grey Worm - Missandei scene - I'm not a huge fan of the whole Dany-the-teenaged conqueror of Slaver's Bay/Meereen plot arc in the books or, particularly, the show, so I appreciated the fact that we were introduced to events via the viewpoint of folks who actually knew what it was like to be slaves -- it brought a fresh perspective to plot points that are normally somewhat tedious to me.
Bronn - Jaime scene - This is a prime example of a non-book "add on" scene that I found to be really effective. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Jerome Flynn play off each other very well indeed, and we get to see more of Bronn as well as giving Jaime someone to actually have some snarky dialogue with; it's a win-win as far as I'm concerned.Â  Also given the dodgy nature of Shae's "leaving" of King's Landing, I was a bit worried that show Bronn was going to be portrayed as having sold out Tyrion in a very blatant manner -- it's good to see him chiding Jaime to take Tyrion's part.
Jaime - Brienne - Pod scene - an effectively underplayed scene that hit just the right emotional balance for me -- there was some humor, a bit of sadness,Â  as well as a tentative touch of hope that some of Jaime's tarnished honor could be reclaimed via Brienne's quest.Â 
Queen of Thorns - Margaery scene - I loved watching Diana Rigg schooling Natalie Dormer on the path to becoming queen.Â  Mrs. Peel has still got it, and my appreciation for Natalie Dormer's performance grows with every season.
Margaery - TommenÂ  scene - Aging up Tommen's character was a good decision in my books, this scene would have been very disturbing or even impossible had they not made this move, as things stand now, I found it to be deviously delightful.
Jon and the Night's Watch scene - I never had an issue with Kit Harington's portrayal of Jon Snow, but this season he is delivering well beyond my expectations.Â  The fact that he's finally getting some excellent dialogue certainly helps.Â  Jon Snow and Alliser Thorne set off fireworks whenever they share a scene.Â  Owen Teale excels at making Ser Alliser a complex and interesting character when in the hands of a lesser actor it could have gone the ham and cheese villain route.
What didn't work for me:
Â 
The NW deserters at Craster's scene - you've already got a bunch of irredeemable scum who murdered their own commander and sworn brothers -- did we really need to see the over the top "embellishments" of drinking from Mormont's skull and the gratuitous rape scenes?Â  I think that even the most distracted and casual of viewers realize that these are bad dudes; no need to bludgeon us over the head with further proof.
Â 
Head-scratching parts:
Â 
What happened to the fierce and lethal defenders of Stark kids?Â  Are direwolves suddenly no more dangerous than unicorns?Â  How did the bozos at Craster's manage to capture and cage Ghost?Â  Why wasn't Summer defending Bran?
316	Er Rn	2014-04-29	6/10
Liked:
The Jaime scenes with Bronn, Tyrion, and Brienne
Olenna and Marg
Marg and Tommen
A darker Dany
Jon at the Wall
The Others
Disliked:
LF and Sansa, his accent kills me
Ghost locked up and Summer easily captured
The over the top disgustingness at Craster's
The whole Bran story (and that wig they put on him is awful)
317	MikeR	2014-04-30	it was a good episodeÂ 
Â 
8/10
Â 
thought there would be more "action" with the conquest of that city.
318	Shebara	2014-04-30	I gave it a 10 because I think it was the very best episode so far
Â 
Whoever done the scripting for this episode...fantastic work!
Â 
1. before all as a bookreader I was afraid of long, long, long Mereen plots but I have to admire how the crucification scene focussed Danys - lets say crucial - problems: she overall enjoys to be the "Mother/Mhysa" thing and to bath in the crowd of her "children", on the other side she is fanatic Fire and Blood, no mercy (even if it would have been alll but clever then), in this situation she does not care about who is innocent or not, and she has (and I am afraid she will not learn) that Fire and Blood will always spread the blood of innocents and of her "children" too!....how to show this in this rather short scene - also masterfully symbolized by the building and the big flag - made me shiver!
2. Jaime/Brienne: one of my favorite relationships also masterfully put into scene there....ohh the goodbye scene
3. LF/Sansa: how he touches her when she asks him what he wants like: oh...and before all I want you baby if I could not have my one and only Cat!
4. I like the Bronn/Jaime interaction.. funny every time...this time the hand thing...lolol
I don t like much violence/blood/rape but I think it is absolutely ok where it belongs too....showing mediaval wars without those things would mean to show Westeros as a playmobile/lego world. Brutal mutineers murder and rape as a fact...and if you show them you have to show that too! The books and the TV series too they don t create violence, blood, raping for the fun of it...they just show a realistic mediaval Westeros/Essos world.
319	dbunting	2014-04-30	Was just able to watch the episode yesterday, and have not read all 15 pages of this so forgive me if some of what i say is repetitive.I liked the change of Sam telling Jon about Bran. I never believed that Sam would allow Jons crippled brother to head north alone and never tell him. Sam knows what is up there so I just couldn't see it happening that way.I somewhat like Locke being added to the watch, didn'tlike him conveiniently over hearing the Jon / Sam discussion, just a little too contrived.Liked the Ceasar reference from Jon when talking about the brothers betraying the LC and stabbing him in the back!
320	Panther2000	2014-04-30	I thought that this episode was great.Â Â Â Â  I also really liked the changes that they did with Jon/Bran/Hordor/ect.Â Â Â  I am a book reader & I find the fact that they change this great because, I then don't know what is going to happen.Â Â Â Â Â  Frankly, I think that they did a great job with Bran & co.Â  his story is a great read however, it will NOT translate to tv well at all, Walking in the wood would be like watching paint dry.Â Â  I think that we all know that Bran & jon probably will not meet up.Â  They all will get away during the fight.Â Â Â  I just wonder about Ghost & Summer, how will they get out ( they will probably both end up saving Jons life again.Â  Summer did it before).Â Â  I like this change from the books.Â Â  It gives me something while waiting on the next book.Â  I do have my order in for GRRMS & Elio Garcia's book coming out in October.Â Â  I also, like Margery & Tommen's storyline.Â  I thought that it was great.Â Â Â  I heard that Ser Pounce was a pain to work with.Â  I think come next year we will have a new Ser Pounce, or we will see boots instead. 
Â 
Â 
I gave it a 7, but it should have been more a 8 instead.Â Â  I love that this was a Character driven episode.Â Â  I do love the action/battles on this show.Â  However, I do love the planting foundations for the story itself.Â Â  & this show was about building for the up coming arcs in the story.Â Â Â 
Â 
Sorry, but I could really go without seeing dani at all.Â Â Â  I was such a fan in season 1 & half way through 2.Â Â Â Â  I see her slowly turning into her BSC Father & Brother with power.Â Â  Ser BS tried to warn her a few times but, she can't see past her own need for revenge & hate.Â

321	Hard Hugh	2014-04-30	The more I watched the episode the more I was fine with the changes. I kept remembering that the scenes with Bran trekking through the northlands were really boring. I can only imagine how much more so they would have been on TV. I think this adds some much needed flavor to keep that story going. At first I had no idea how they would get from here back to the books. It didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t feel like a detour anymore but a new direction. Then I thought of a way and liked it more.
Â 
I thought the Jamie/Brienne/Pod/Bron scene worked incredibly well. I think this will also really help build the chemistry of Pod/Brienne. 
Also the Jamie/Tyrion worked very well. I was kind of waiting for Jamies speech about with so many hats which duty should he honor speech. 
Â 
I also liked the further tug O War of Tommon between Margery, Tywin, Cersi. 
Â 
Loved Ser Pounceâ<U+0080>¦missed Lady Whiskers L
Â 
Â 
I thought the Dany stuff was very effective way to cut a bit of budget out of a big fight scene while shooting something that conveyed an effective message. 
Â 
Overall I gave it a 9. If you would have ask me after the first viewing I would have said 7
322	Crow's Eye Kraken	2014-04-30	This episode rubbed me the right way, I certainly feel it upstaged the other aired episodes of season 4 so far. 
Positives:
- Ser Pounce: All must pay their regards to the greatest of knights, champion of the Kingsguard. So glad they included him after all! 
- Sansa foreshadowing: Littlefinger's explanation of power and motives were an excellent inclination that Sansa may be joining the game in a powerful way, which I feel could be a much needed factor in regards to the events of Winds (Sansa choosing to support a potential claimant to the Iron Throne.)
- Bran and co: I actually think their new arc is an interesting and engaging addition to the story. All these plotlines converging at Craster's will certainly make a very unique fifth episode, and in regards to people complaining about "filler material," it does seem preferable to Bran not appearing/walking North for multiple episodes. 
- Something Other: Much like the scene at Craster's prior, this one really reinvigorated that old sense of surprise from reading the books. The look into the Land of Always Winter was fascinating; beautiful and mysterious, but laced with a certain atmosphere of foreboding. If anything, this scene just left me with more questions about the Others, so the payoff worked out.
- Margaery/Tommen: Their dynamic could certainly become interesting. It'll be fun seeing the two queens become solid rivals so early.
- Jaime/Brienne: Their relationship has changed completely in spectrum since season 2, and it's great seeing the influence they've both exerted on eachother.
Negatives:
- Meereen: Dany's takeover was too hurried; with all the action acenes this season, one would think they could allocate a little more budget to the actual slave revolt, and perhaps some shots of the damage caused. (That being said, the city of Meereen itself is gorgeous, and the great Targaryen flag shot offered a good precedent.)
All around, ignoring minor nitpicks, Oathkeeper earns a solid 9/10 from me.
323	Talking Hodor	2014-04-30	You all do realize that they're setting up Jon getting to meet Jojen and Meera, the children of the one person in Westeros who knows who Jon's mother really is and who could possibly reveal information more astounding for non-book readers (and many book readers) than the Red Wedding?Â  Heck Jojen may have learned that info from one of his epileptic green dreams already.
Â 
Let Bran's storyline diverge a little.Â  This could be a good thing!
324	FalseKnight	2014-04-30	au contrare, ser False.
My first reads of Feast -and to a lesser extent Dance- were disappointing, in a "i need to know what happens next" sense.

Â 
Â 
We're not bitching, anyways. It's just noticing something that the writers apparently thought we wouldn't, and that's discouraging.

I would agree if the plot actually advanced. Instead, we got a bunch really boring travelogue, repetitious catch phrases, and lame cliffhangers. The writing was great, but that only matters so much. Even if you aren't bitching, you're giving GRRM a pass.
325	Panther2000	2014-04-30	I to love the new arc with Bran & Jon, kind of a play on the Araya almost getting to her mother & brother from last season.Â Â Â  I think that also with Bran growing so fast they only have but so much more time with this actor.Â  Remember, hordor is suppose to be carrying bran around on his back in a basket.Â Â  This kid just shot up over the past 2 years.Â Â  they have about 3/4 ( maybe) seasons left to this series.Â  He will outgrow this part for sure.Â  Unless GRRM jumps ahead a few years.Â Â  I have a feeling with Araya they may do the samething ( though I don't see Massie outgrowing her part, she seems on the short side).Â  However, I can see them dumping a lot of her story line also.Â  They may hit on the boat ride here & there.Â  I think depending if WOW is out yet or not, they may just hit on a few key spots & then proceed to the bigger story of the book( meeting up with Sam, etc....)Â Â
326	Panther2000	2014-04-30	I love picking Books, Movies & TV shows apart ( that is just me) however, I don't have strokes when things are different from book to Movies/TV.Â Â Â  Just as long that the changes aren't too far off the mark.Â Â Â  I do like it when changes are make, because then it gives me another version other than the 1 I already know.Â  Something else to think about.Â Â  Thinking OUTSIDE of the Box is always good.Â Â Â Â Â  If people are upset about the few changes in the show ( laughs) just wait for the next few seasons.Â  I see a lot of stuff being omitted ( do to DRAG) from the book.Â Â Â  This series has way too much info for a 10 shows , 1 hour Â episodes series each year.Â Â Â Â  Frankly with all the ratings & such that this show brings,Â  I think that they should get a Much bigger budget & the show expanded Â to 1.5 or dare I say 2 hour show.Â Â  We do after all get cheated a few min at the start & end of the show.Â  I can't believe it we are almost at the half way point already.Â  DAMN.
327	angelik0	2014-04-30	I rated the episode 7/10, I think it was a good one, I particularly enjoyed the beginning with Daenerys and also the part with Jon but I was not that happy with many things. I know it can be good to change a few things from the books, it's always interesting to see but I don't like the changes they made to Margaery, I just don't think she's that interesting as a character in the show while I liked her a lot in the books.
Bonus points for Ser Pounce!
328	Nemesis21	2014-05-01	Too many plot deviations, dumbing down of characters, blatantly spelling things out to people and potential book spoilers for my liking.
329	yushkevitch	2014-05-01	Love this tidbit from a review of the episode at TotH, speaking of the final Night's King/Baby scene:
Â 
"After the initial, superficial thrill of horror wears off, this week's closing scene reveals itself as the laziest trick of all; a cheap, cynical shock ploy that says nothing and means nothing aside from expressing the writers' desperate desire for continued viewership."
Â 
Btw I completely agree with the entire review. He nails it. The author does a great job of getting past the hype and admonishing the writers for a lazy effort and some poor scripting, a growing trend this season. If you loved this episode see if you still agree after reading that (I assume you know where to find it )
330	Ran	2014-05-01	I suspect the walker bit is in there simply to act as a reminder of the existential threat beyond the Wall, a threat that endangers everyone, rather than as "a ploy".
331	Greywolf2375	2014-05-01	Going 7/10 because there were too many little to medium things that detracted from a great episode for me. Â They may come up with a gangbusters reasoning behind everyone being at Crasters but right now a lot of that is falling flat for me.
Â 
Jaime, Tyrion, Jon - all superb portayals.
Â 
LF...just pick a freaking voice and stick with it. Â 
Â 
The leading of Jon for LC, Crasters...just not done well.

333	Ran	2014-05-01	602 votes, 7.80 average, 9 median, 8.01 median.
334	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-01	I'm suprised so many people liked this episode. I honestly think it was the worst of all series. This is the only episode that felt short. When the screen went black my first thought was "is that it?" it felt only about 1/2 an episode. It didn't feel like a great deal happened. The Jaime plot seemed very strange after the previous encounter in the sept. My opinion on the infamous rape scene is that it was a directorial mistake and was not supposed to be rape and as it was in the books but the director or actors screwed it up. The knock on effect of that is that Jaime's redemption seems completely false now. Although it always did in a way.
Â 
Â 
Admittedly though I am an Arya fan. So any episode without Ary is going to fall a little flat.

Jaime/Bronn
Jaime/Tyrion
Jaime/Brienne
Littlefinger
Jon's speech (the actor seems ALLOT better!)
Â 
Â 
Other than the rather strange capture of Bran (how did they get surrounded so easily?, the camera might not be able to see them approaching but Bran and co should)
I thought Bran's/Craster Keeps scenes were good. It is not as if he had some great book storyline which has been sacrificed for this.
Â 
Merreen scenes were good, if more than a little rushed.Â  It is a shame HBO cant provide a bit more budget for a show which makes so much money for them.

Are you going to tell us the sun rises in the east and nothing is certain but death and taxes, too? 
Â 
The fact is that it's not exactly a universally praised episode by critics, whatever Metacritic says. Both critics at AV Club (reader and non-reader) have it as their least favorite episode of the season, and I know others have shared their gripes.

Â  Â  Â Over at Rotten Tomatoes (they ought to rename that site!) there are , if I count right, 36 positive review, with analysis, one negative review.Over all score 97.RT does not seem to collect all possible reviewers (I like Myles McNutt long reviews over at Cultural Learnings) but it's a pretty broad spectrum of TV reviews.(I keep noting that the New York Times Arts Beat Jeremy Egner reviews each episode this season, I don't know if NYT did this in former years or not, it's been positive... in contrast to Mike Hale's muddled season previews which turn out negative but are kind of mixed, but mostly worthless.)Over at IMDB S4E4 got a Arithmetic mean = 9.0. Median = 9 out of 3478 votes.The sample is fairly big and they have histograms of two kinds of stuff but no error bars.Never know what to think of IMDB.I don't know if trolls vote there, does not seem their kind of thing.Message boards on IMDB are overrun by adolescent and arrested adolescent trolls, signal to noise is very bad.

345	Ran	2014-05-03	RT just decides if a review is positive or not. Some reviews are more positive than others. I think a finer parsing of the reviews would show that critics weren't as happy with the episode as they were with previous episodes, for the most part, so there's no real surprise if this forum dislikes it more than the previous episodes (for the most part; as it happens, 3 is the least liked episode of the series, and that's definitely in large part because of the feeling that they seriously botched the sept scene.)

346	Moondancer	2014-05-03	Ran, 
If I don't want to be spoiled (not even a tidbit of the future plot), should I continue to watch the show? 
This is very important to me. I like the forum, but following the last week's episode, even the books part of the forum found a way to illustrate that something is happening ie every thread regarding the Others and The Night King was bumped.

Â 
Yeah, I think those who absolutely will not want even the chance of getting spoiled should start considering stopping their watching of the show.

Thanks for your reply!
349	Rashtibram	2014-05-03	Unfortunately, I didn't feel that this episode quite lived up to the standard we've come to expect from Bryan Cogman's material in seasons 2 and 3. This may be, in part, due to the material he was given to adapt, but the episode didn't seem to have the emotional grab, smooth character development and engrossing plot quality that characterized 'Kissed by Fire' and 'What is Dead May Never Die.'
Â 
When I say this is the worst episode of the season so far, that's not to say it was in any way bad. Moreover, it reflects the difference in general pacing between the first three seasons and this one. The reason 'Oathkeeper' felt so slow, so much so that it is worthy of comparison to 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair' and 'The Prince of Winterfell' in terms of a general sense of momentum, is that the Purple Wedding this season took on the role of the major plot catalyst we usually could expect to see in episode four (Catelyn taking Tyrion prisoner, Melisandre giving birth to the Shadow Assassin, and "Dracarys"). The decision to place such a momentous event in episode two (as well as the decision to compress the battles in the North into episode 4x09: I maintain that Ygritte's death would have made a perfectly satisfying "episode four moment") meant that the stretch of episodes between 4x03 and 4x08 have very little in terms of exciting book material to adapt. Whereas the previous seasons built to an epic mid-season sub-climax and then built again to an "episode nine moment," season 4 hit you right off the bat with a game-changing, climactic event, and is proceeding to wallow in procrastination while it waits patiently to arrive at the final shockers of ASOS in the closing three episodes. This seems, to me, to be an odd decision in retrospect (even though I admittedly fully endorsed it prior to season four's airing). So just because 'Oathkeeper' failed to live up to expectations doesn't suddenly mean the show sucks, or that Bryan Cogman's taken a jarring turn for the worse. I'm eagerly awaiting 'The Laws of Gods and Men,' as what with Tyrion's trial and Yara's attack on the Dreadfort he should be able to wrangle up something more like the emotional punch we all fondly remember from 'Kissed by Fire' and the closing scene of 2x03.

Well, about 40% of this episode was pure invention, not adaptation, so that could have a lot to do with it. Â I know that things get moved around after writing some times -- do we even know for sure what parts Cogman did and didn't write?
351	Count Balerion	2014-05-03	Episode 4: I keep going back and forth between 8 and 9.Â  The Meereen segment was quite good, although
at first I wondered what on earth was going on.Â  Grey Worm's speech was very impressive, and Ser B
finally gets to do something.Â  Although speaking of doing something, I'm feeling the force of the
complaint that Jorah doesn't get to do very much.Â  
	Spoiler Are they not going to do his exile?
 I also wonder if it
would've been better to place this segment at the end.
Anyway, I enjoyed almost all the segments, especially in the first two-thirds, but would single out all the
scenes with Jaime; the Queen of Thorns; and Ser Pounce turning up after all.Â  BIG SCREAMING
SPOILER: SP ends up ruling the Seven Kingdoms when the series is over.
And I liked the Night's Watch better than usual, although I got a bit lost north of the Wall again.Â  I used to
get confused because I hadn't read the books; now I get confused because I have.Â  Superb landscapes,
though.Â  I also hope that was Coldhands.Â  I'm not terribly sure about the CK plot, although Jon's speech
and interaction with SA were very good.

352	Mr Fixit	2014-05-04	Are you going to tell us the sun rises in the east and nothing is certain but death and taxes, too?  


Â 
Hey, that's your American/Swedish bias there! Where I come from, taxes are most definitely notÂ certain. Â 
Â 
As for the episode, look how many posters rated it 1-5. I'd say the main reason is that the show went off books, simple as that.

353	Ran	2014-05-04	Note how many vote it a 10 as well, when I don't know of any critics who felt the thing was perfect. If people want to vote 10 on their scale, that's fine, but then you have to accept someone else's scale could be a 1. That's why it gets averaged out, and why I try and provide a normalized average by reducing the outliers.

People will vote how they will. Some people gave it a 10 because it had a cat in it.
355	Ran	2014-05-04	Which we still had ratings. That'd be a +1.
356	ground_control	2014-05-04	I'm not sure how hard it would be, but it would be interesting to see ratings for each scene as well as the overall rating. Â I think the easiest way would be to add a separate thread/poll for each scene (after the epsiode airs, of course) to compliment the "overall" rating thread.
357	kissdbyfire	2014-05-12	It was a bad episode. One of the weakest overall, imho. Gave it a 4, and that's only because I kind of liked the scene with Jaime and Brienne.

600	Faint	2014-04-27	Game of FanFic


Â 
Bran has three chapters after A Storm of Swords.Â  Invented material is needed or he will need to disappear from the show six or seven episodes at a time, which is not a realistic option.
601	The Shrike	2014-04-27	I'm glad Joffrey didn't feed little bits of Ser Pounce to Tommen, that would have been most disturbing, and with George...you never know.
602	ViennaGirl	2014-04-27	"I hope I got your measurements right."
Â 
Shipping it so hard.


Â me too. I never, ever shipped them in the books, but I am sailing that ship tonight
603	FNF	2014-04-27	Craster's Keep stuff lowered my opinion of the episode. It was very good until that. The ending though did make up for it, definitely.
604	Fool of a Book	2014-04-27	With the exception of a LITTLE of the Sansa/LF scene, approximately zero percent of the scenes happened like that in the books. Â I'm still in shock at the ending.
605	Vaellyn Cerwyn	2014-04-27	The latest Game of Thrones episode (s04e04: Oathkeeper) gave us new information about the Others. Obviously this is something George R. R. Martin has told David and Dan, and it's part of the new information GRRM is about to give us in TWOW, when we will get to know the Lands of Always Winter.
Â 
In this night's episode, Kraster's lastborn son is left in the snow as a gift to the Gods, as we have previously seen in season 2 (and ACOK). This time however, after the Other/White Walker takes the baby, we follow them far north where a mountain and some northern lights are visible in the background. The baby is left in the center of some sort of "Ice Stonehenge" as another White Walker aproaches, takes the baby and with a finger touches his skin, turning the baby's eyes' color to blue, the blue eyes of the Others.
Â 
So we get that the Others have the power to turn living humans into their own kind. This raises questions like: Is this the only form of reproduction the Others have? If the answer is yes, do the Others need humans to survive or just strenghten their numbers? Are they imortal (we know they can be killed by dragonglass and as we imagine, dragonfire and valyrian steel, but are they subject to decay?)? Are they just another race with their own culture and religion, or are they demigods or something?
606	Turncloak_	2014-04-27	Was that The Great Other in the end?
607	Darth Pipes	2014-04-27	Jon knowing Bran is alive is a surprising but welcome change.Â  I would think they'll have to meet up now but who knows?Â  BTW, I'm really glad Meera's capture didn't turn into another rape scene.Â  Though the mutineers creeped me out and the whole Mormont's skull scene...
Â 
Cool to see so much of the White Walkers.
Â 
The Tyrion/Jaime scene was excellent tonight...that is the type of greatness I've been expecting from the two of them together.Â  All of Jaime's interactions were gold and I laughed at Bronn hitting him with his own hand.Â  While it didn't quite reach the greatness of the book scene, Jaime and Brienne's scene was well-acted by both.Â  Love that he's the one to give her Pod as a squire.
Â 
The Night's Watch stuff was pretty strong and Jon and Locke turned out to be a good pairing too.Â  I'm interested in seeing how that will play out next week.
Â 
I'm surprised too that Olenna is leaving so soon.Â  I mean, she doesn't really do much after we learn that she poisoned Joffrey but I will seriously miss her snarky comments to Cersei from AFFC.
Â 
Ser Pounce!Â  Enjoyed the Maegarey/Tommen scenes.Â  Yep, Marg's is going to have an easy time with this kid.
Â 
The capture of Meereen turns out differently but turned out fairly well.Â  I'm curious though as to when Mormont's betrayal will be learned.Â  When it comes to showing shades of gray, the show has never been as afraid with Dany as they are with Tyrion.Â  The Masters got what they deserved but that was still brutal to watch.Â  The show would never allow Tyrion to do something like that.Â  I laughed when Bronn said he wasn't capable of murder...in the book, Tyrion had Bronn murder a singer who tried to blackmail him and turn him into stew!
Â 
BTW, I'm really glad Meera's capture didn't turn into another rape scene.Â  Though the mutineers creeped me out and the whole Mormont's skull scene...
608	ultimo12	2014-04-27	Nice one.Karl the Gin Alley legend fuck yeah.Dormer, Chapman and a cat on screen at the same time=winningI'm also glad they kept the Locke character in, thought he was really charismatic back in the last Season.But please NO Grey Worm/Missandhei lovestory, please no.
609	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-27	That was an awesome episode. The North got the amount of screentime it deserved for once. The ending was fucking intense.
Â 
The usual Dany nonsense was boring. That flag shot was very cool, though.
610	Trebla	2014-04-27	Ser Pounce is trending on Twitter. I am content.
611	E-Ro	2014-04-27	WTF!
612	ThePosterThatWasPromised	2014-04-27	Seeing that their palace is made of ice in the Land of Always Winter, it leads me to believe that The Wall was built by The Others to keep men out of the North. Not to keep White Walkers from marching south. Men broke the pact with The Children, they probably broke a pact with the others.(plural) too. White walkers are like undead pawns. We saw a glimpse of the "other" others. The equivalent of their lords.
613	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-27	I just have no words for this. This is huge and im reeling.
Â 
I just.
Â 
Wow.
Â 
Much Other.
So revelation.
Very big.Â 
Â 
I actually was enjoying the Meereen stuff. Dany crucified those guys and the foreboding looming Targaryen flag....thats oooOooOoo.
Â 
But Ser Pounce and Others. Omg the Others! Im...
614	Ser Creighton	2014-04-27	Mind blown new about the babies already but finally the real Others, that's a different race looks like everything else was just undead. Guys on the undead horses are probably just mummified corpses that they raised or maybe something else but those guys guys at the end are clearly a different race, those are not humans and never were.
Interesting twist with Bran not sure why they are doing it other than they have time to kill with him. Will be interesting to see how long it takes Jon to go 60 miles, the Goat about an episode to go about 600.
I guess the Cersei Jaime thing from last week not much of a big deal between the two. Jaime and Brie was pretty good, and the Pod moment was excellent.
615	Fool of a Book	2014-04-27	The series has officially jumped the snarks and grumpkins.
Â 
Did anyone else notice if Dany was flying a three-headed dragon flag? Â Looked like it to me... waiting to watch again.
616	FNF	2014-04-27	Was that The Great Other in the end?


No doubt imo. There is a reason why it was the one who could transform the baby and had such a distinctive look.Â
617	Bryden88	2014-04-27	I loved it. I read the books, and my theory now is that they pretty much spoiled book 6 for us. Not just the WW thing either, but the whole Bolton-Stark-Snow thing.
Â 
They're bringing that plot forward a bit - probably to bide their time for Bran's plot, and because it just makes sense for the show. I dunno, we'll see!
Â 
I really want to hear Dracarys being shouted at a White Walker.
618	ViennaGirl	2014-04-27	I was thinking of book 5 for that entire episode - when Jon was rallying the Craster's group and saying "Mormont got stabbed in the back by his own brothers," ouch. And the White Walker stuff! Heart of Winter? Given the choice between being raised by the mutineers at Crasters and becoming a WW, I choose WW, but the crying baby was so hard to hear that I muted it.
619	Rhinoman	2014-04-27	That looks like the leader of the White Walkers. My guess is that Wights are dead humans while White Walkers (Only can die via dragon fire) Â All I can think of is that the last White Walker is the Nights King.Â

625	KingOfTheRock	2014-04-27	Awesome episode! I like that D&D are giving us just a little more than a reminder that Winter is Coming.
626	jons nissa	2014-04-27	well. that was intense! so that was the scene everyone was talking about. shocking indeed. but equally as shocking for book readers is the new twist in the north. too many people know bran is alive. and the great other. i wonder if this means we'll see the lord of light.
627	Wmarshal	2014-04-27	So wait, all new others are just sons of Craster?
628	ViennaGirl	2014-04-27	Is it just me or those producers or whatever seem to be kinda obsessed with rape?


Â 
Yeah. Way rapey again. And Cersei seemed to be cool with the Jaime rape. I'm v glad Meera didn't get it. Or Jojen or Bran. God, or Hodor. Ugh.
629	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-27	Is it just me or those producers or whatever seem to be kinda obsessed with rape?


wouldn't say there is any more than Â in the books really.Â
630	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-27	Bronn/Jaime interaction is turning out to be very fun to watch.
Â 
Marg and Olenna dialogue was great to see. Â Nice to see her Olenna transferring skills to Marg.
Â 
The Jon Snow/Locke/Dreadfort connection will be a great plot line to watch. Â Certainly a nice addition that was not in the books. Â Well done Dan and Dave.
Â 
Marg and Tommen was awesome, too. Â Let the games begin with Marg/Cersei.
Â 
I like what they did with Bran and co. Â His story can be a bit boring at times, and they spiced it up in a relevant way. Â I like what they did there. Â Should be cool to see Jon and Bran interact with each other. Â I don't think it's too far fetched, or will hinder the story at all. Â It's a harmless addition, and probably will help strictly show watchers have a reason to not fall asleep when Bran comes on screen.
Â 
Cool to see a white walker perspective and their lair. Â I like that addition as well.
Â 
Overall decent episode. Â Jorah should be getting the ax soon.
631	Lord Godric	2014-04-27	Craster's Keep stuff lowered my opinion of the episode. It was very good until that. The ending though did make up for it, definitely.


This was how I felt too. Â I love the first 40 minutes of this episode. Â I sat confused at all the Craster's Keep stuff, then I loved the Other ending. Â I didn't hate the Craster's Keep stuff but it was so strange. Â I don't understand why they needed to have Jon know about Bran but I'll reserve judgement to see what happens. Â
632	regie027	2014-04-27	Well Done Marge... Tommen Likey!


Should we rank episodes now with a Pedobear seal of approval? LF has serious competition now with Margaery. o_o
633	Fool of a Book	2014-04-27	Did anyone else catch Lady O saying "it was all the rage to marry a Targaryen."
Â 
Which one could she have been talking about? Â
634	rmholt	2014-04-27	Tommen = dreamboat. I admit to LOL at last week's forum when he called Ser Pounce. Pod's Ser ... My Lady ha ha.
635	Mickster4	2014-04-27	Wow what a big reveal they just dropped on everybody who reads the books! Just in complete confusion right now I can't believe they are already giving away what is in the 6th book in only the 4th season of the show! This kind of spoiler I wanted to read about more than watch on TV!
636	direwoofwoof	2014-04-27	I liked the ending too, we kinda all knew what was happening to the babies anyway.

I thought they were eating the babies. DOH!

I thought they were eating the babies. DOH!
638	Ser Creighton	2014-04-27	No doubt imo. There is a reason why it was the one who could transform the baby and had such a distinctive look.

Don't think so, those are the real Others, the Great Other is a god, like the Stranger, the Red God etc... Everything else appears to have been just undead. The dead guys on the horses look like raised dead, who had been mummified. But they look like dead mummified humans these guys look like a different race which the Others are and there is more than one of them, there was a whole line of them.

Did anyone else notice if Dany was flying a three-headed dragon flag? Â Looked like it to me... waiting to watch again.

Â 
Looked like the normal HBO Targ sigil to me
641	ViennaGirl	2014-04-27	The series has officially jumped the snarks and grumpkins.
Â 


Â 
My thought also while watching. I think they're going to lose viewers after this one.Â

Yes. So doge. My brain is soÂ doge right now i cant even.

Â 
Â I didn't hate the Craster's Keep stuff but it was so strange. I don't understand why they needed to have Jon know about Bran but I'll reserve judgement to see what happens.

Yeah it was all so different i was like "what are they even doing?" But i think theres a reason despite my rage at Ghost being chained up. I...just...Other...
Â 
My mind is Other.Â 
Â 
Craster's Keep stuff was among the darkest shit on this show so far. Something about that was just...dark. Moreso than even the Sept scene. It almost looks like the Others are doingÂ those babies a favor. Thats the creepiest thing about all of this. *chills*
644	nara	2014-04-27	This was an episode that had lots of changes from the books.Â  I am a book purist, but I felt that a lot of the changes worked.
I really liked the expanded role of Grey Worm in causing the slaves to rise.
I liked Barristanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s advice to Dany, which of course she ignored. Was it just me or does he seem to have some doubt about Dany as a ruler?
Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s getting quite good with the left-hand sword. And I have to say that NCW looked really handsome in this episode!
I love Bronn as Jaime's conscience and I like the reminder that Tyrion wanted Jaime has his champion during his first trial. One of the things I find interesting is that Jaime is never really there when his siblings are counting on him (I am especially bitter about Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s letter in AFFC)
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad that there was a convo between Jaime and Tyrion but it looks like â<U+0080><U+009C>sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been fucking Lancel, Kettleblack and Moonboyâ<U+0080><U+009D> will not happen.
I love this foreshadowing: â<U+0080><U+009C>Sansa is not a killerâ<U+0080><U+0094>not yet, anywayâ<U+0080><U+009D>
Petyr and Sansa â<U+0080><U+0093>I thought I was going to vomit when Petyr stroked Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arm while talking about what he wanted. I did like her faith in Tyrion and vice versa. Perhaps thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s foreshadowing a future rapprochement between Sansa and Tyrion.
How much do I love Olenna the Sex Goddess? However, I hate that she's leaving KL
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure if I like Olennaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s confession so soon. People were really enjoying their theories about who killed Joffrey.
As many people predicted, the little boy from Mole Town is a good archer. I think heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a Satin replacement. They got rid of Satin because they were concerned about Jon/Satin shippers, and no one will think about sex between Jon and this mentee!
Locke has made it to the NW! I really thought he would pretend to have fought for Robb. I think thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a missed opportunity to play on Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sympathies.
I literally clapped at the mention of Ser Pounce!
I actually liked Margâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seduction of Tommen. Now the aging up of Tommen makes sense. I may have a filthy mind, but I was really afraid she was going to perform a sex act on him. Really glad that did not happen. The actor looks 14!
Oathkeeper was awesome and there were definitely a few moments between Brienne and Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0094>clearly foreshadowing a future between the two. I am not a Jaime/Brienne shipper, but I hope people who are enjoyed the fodder.
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad they cut out the part about Pod following Brienneâ<U+0080><U+0094>this was much easier. Is this the first time weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen Pod smiling? I loved it, and the fact that he got Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s axe.
Jon knows about Bran! I really like this change, but I would have liked to see the celebration/conflict in Jon when he found out. I feel weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re really being robbed of some good opportunities for real emotion in the show. I really hope that Jon actually meets Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep. I am a book purist, but if theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re going to make changes in the show, this is one Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d love to see. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m afraid that Summer getting caught just when he found Ghost was a prediction that the brothersâ<U+0080><U+0099> reunion would be thwarted at the last minute.
I really loved the charismatic Jon during the call for volunteers!!! It really reminded me of â<U+0080><U+009C>I have my swords, and weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re coming for you, bastard!â<U+0080><U+009D>â<U+0080><U+0094>which is my favorite Jon moment. It was great foreshadowing of the future vote, but I kinda preferred when that vote was out of the blue.
When I realized that Gin Alley Guy was drinking from Jeor Mormontâ<U+0080><U+0099>s skull, I wanted to jump through my TV screen and murder him myself. I really want him to die horribly!
Was it just me, or was anyone else disgusted with them actually showing the raping on screen?
I actually felt sorry for Rast with that guy threatening to rape himâ<U+0080>¦until he threw away water when Ghost was thirsty. I want him to die horribly too! I also want them all to die for hurting Hodor.
I liked the baby boy and the reminder that Craster sacrifices his sons to white walkers. I was hoping that Summer would somehow rescue the baby. Not sure what Bran and Co, would do with himâ<U+0080>¦
Finally a Ghost sighting! Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad they had a real reason for not showing him.
I was confused at the end. I thought that guy on a horse was an Other, not a wight. If so, to whom was he sacrificing the baby? Are they making the Others victims to some darker force?
645	lostinwesteros	2014-04-27	So, now Bran's at Craster's Keep?  And Ghost is caged there?  And Summer is caught in a bear trap?  And Jon's on his way there.  And Locke is first at Castle Black, now headed to Craster's Keep to kill Bran?  WTF?
I did think the scene where the WW turned the baby boy's eyes blue was kind of cool.
646	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-27	Â 
Yeah. Way rapey again. And Cersei seemed to be cool with the Jaime rape. I'm v glad Meera didn't get it. Or Jojen or Bran. God, or Hodor. Ugh.


Don't watch if it bothers you. Â The show isn't on ABC Fam.
647	Lord Godric	2014-04-27	Should we rank episodes now with a Pedobear seal of approval? LF has serious competition now with Margaery. o_o


It's so different with Margaery though. I loved her scene with Tommen because it was framed by that arrow through the boar's eyes which was a nice reminder that Marg knew how to manipulate Joffrey and she can manipulate Tommen just as easily.Â
648	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-27	Â 
My thought also while watching. I think they're going to lose viewers after this one.Â 


No wai. People are going to more pumped than ever!Â 
Â

Â 
lol I don't think saying I'm glad Meera didn't get raped is anything controversial
651	monkeyboom	2014-04-27	Â 
Yeah. Way rapey again. And Cersei seemed to be cool with the Jaime rape. I'm v glad Meera didn't get it. Or Jojen or Bran. God, or Hodor. Ugh.

And oh so different from the books, good lord. Go read and comment on a Harry Potter forum.
652	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-27	And oh so different from the books, good lord. Go read and comment on a Harry Potter forum.

655	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-27	No wai. People are going to more pumped than ever!Â 
Â 

Yeah three stick in the muds will pout and run off. This was a huge episode for keeping people coming back.

Â 
Yeah, but Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll bet that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not!
657	Dain Storm	2014-04-27	Soooo...Night's King Stannis debunked?
Also, there's no way Tommen doesn't hit it.
658	FNF	2014-04-27	Don't think so, those are the real Others, the Great Other is a god, like the Stranger, the Red God etc... Everything else appears to have been just undead. The dead guys on the horses look like raised dead, who had been mummified. But they look like dead mummified humans these guys look like a different race which the Others are and there is more than one of them, there was a whole line of them.


But how do you know that? In the Red God mythos, the Great Other is a god, but we have never been told the story from a WW's perspective. To them, maybe this 'Great Other' is just their king and they don't have a 'God' per se.Â
659	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-27	The ending was shocking, for sure. Book six spoilers? I would not have imagined this at all, but I am not disappointed. I love new stuff... I didn't think I would, but I loved being shocked. The lack of hair, lack of major wrinkles, and thorns on the head make me think this might be the Night's King.
I absolutely loved the Sansa scene. She's a critical thinker, she's analyzing LF's actions and the mechanisms of the game.
Jaime's palpable longing for Brienne was touching. Great acting in that scene.
Margaery talking to Tommen - I hope they don't sexualize this situation, he's only 12 in the book. But the cat was cute, Tommen is adorable, and I love Marg.
Not enough emphasis on the taking of Meereen. I feel like they could have dragged that out for a few episodes to kill some time.
Poor Bran. Jojen is so sick. Will he die sooner rather than later?
I really hope the show doesn't lose viewers after this amazing episode. If anyone quits watching after this, I question their taste.
660	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-27	Yes. So doge. My brain is soÂ doge right now i cant even.
Yeah it was all so different i was like "what are they even doing?" But i think theres a reason despite my rage at Ghost being chained up. I...just...Other...

Craster's Keep stuff gave me the creeps. Â You had Karl drinking from Joers Skull, which is creepy. Then you had rape, which always disturbing,then you had Karl tossing the foot or whatever at Rast. plusthe stuff with Bran and the Baby.
661	TheNinjaDC	2014-04-27	No wai. People are going to more pumped than ever!Â 
Â 


This, the more the show starts to surpass the books, the ore watchers will be interested to tune in and catch the new, unspoiled developments.
662	ViennaGirl	2014-04-27	Â Lmao agreed, ser. Â And to Vienna, I'm not referring to the Meera part of your comment, just the former. Â 


Â 
eh, rape is a legit discussion topic in this world. it was pretty rapey at Craster's. peace.
663	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-27	Just am wondering how they are going to expand this in TWOW, and also wonder how they are going to show "The Others" in the future of the show now that they have given it away already!


They gave it away in the first scene of the pilot, man. What's the issue?
664	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-27	Marg is sooooooooooooo hot.


I'd let her seduce me
665	Faint	2014-04-27	I think too much is being made of the changes to Bran's story.Â  This is clearly a case of needing to keep the character busy for a couple of episodes since he does not have much material to work through.Â  Nothing consequential is going to come of Bran's capture, which is precisely why Meera was not raped, Hoder was not killed, and so forth.
Â 
As book readers, this amounts to empty calories, so it does not really work for us.Â  That said, the grand majority of television viewers are not book readers, so they really do have a stake in this storyline and do not know what will come of it.
666	Talbot	2014-04-27	Â

672	Colonel Green	2014-04-27	It makes no sense that the mutineers would keep Ghost alive when by their own admission they don't have enough food.
Â 
It's weird that, despite making TV!Margaery much more of an active schemer than Book!Margaery, she wasn't involved in the assassination, even though the book version really had to have been at least passively aware of it.
Â 
Ser Pounce!Â  Okay, I'll forgive the show a lot for that.

674	Calvin the Bold	2014-04-27	I wonder if that ending was a sign that the 6th book is coming out sooner rather than later (relatively speaking).
Plenty of book readers watch the show and if they stop watching because of the shows speed....
I can dream.
Anyway, I just hate the entire Craster's Keep storyline.
Just an  unbelievable waste of time imo.
675	Obebb	2014-04-27	Wow, that Craster stuff was so crazy
676	SwingDatSword	2014-04-27	Pardon me if this has already been discussed. Ive read most pages and did not see anything.
Â 
Pardons also if I sound like a newb, I admit I am not a GoT Master Scholar.
Â 
But, I know of rumors about Benjen being Coldhands. Was that cold hands in the last scene? The camera seemed to have lingered on his hands. I know one show of course was with the child, but the other seemed to have lingered on the opposite hand holding the chain. Then from the posterior view of him his hair seemed to be fashioned like they had Benjen's in season one.

Just wait until the direwolves get to chomp on their domes!  I root for it.
Â 
Im kinda seriously rooting for the Others now omg.
Â 
Â 


Just am wondering how they are going to expand this in TWOW, and also wonder how they are going to show "The Others" in the future of the show now that they have given it away already!


Flesh them out some? That would be pretty wiggy. The Others are a huge mystery and even this bomb still leaves them mysterious. We probably wont get another nugget of Other info for a while after this.Â

Better that they didn't from what I've seen, the show watchers are getting pissed off at her for not going to Westeros so the less screentime she has the better..out of sight out of mind:p


They even remember she wants to go back to Westeros? I thought the Unsullied even forgot she was a Targ, since she never really use that name anymore.
681	TheNinjaDC	2014-04-27	Who wants to bet Jon's going to be the one to shove longclaw down the "unbeatable" Kings Landing assassin's neck.
Â 
Also, Locke seems to be officially Marsh. Will likely be Jon's loyal(ish) follower until the letter in season 5's cliffhanger.

Also, there's no way Tommen doesn't hit it.

His aging will serve to one purpose: BEWBS!

Locke is just Locke, only connection to VG is that they both held Jaime and Brienne.
689	MR92	2014-04-27	I saw the look on Tommen's face when Margaery left, and immediately "I Just Can't Wait To Be King" from The Lion King popped into my head.

692	clawson24	2014-04-27	Was that The Great Other in the end?


I for one don't think so. George has said none of the "Gods" would appear in the series in physical form, and I'm assuming that goes for the show as well. I'm guessing that was some special or more powerful Other.
693	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-27	Wait, I'm confused. Is Locke suppose to be Vargo Hoat?

I liked Barristanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s advice to Dany, which of course she ignored. Was it just me or does he seem to have some doubt about Dany as a ruler?

Â 
It was a well-played scene.Â  Barristan will of course obey Dany but there's doubt and disappointment in his face.
695	jaimecersei	2014-04-27	lol of course this TRASH show completely ignored that jaime raped cersei last week.
696	Faint	2014-04-27	The Night's King, from what we know of him, was not the leader of the Others.Â  He was simply an ally.Â  The story told of him seems to indicate he was something like a rich man's Caster.
697	TheButcherCrow	2014-04-27	They are so far away from the books now that getting mad about it is literally ridiculous. This episode was the random mutation that created a new species. Â They are officially two utterly separate entities now. we have moved into Peter Jackson territory. Personally I loved it, I like not knowing exactly what is going to happen. It's almost like getting to enjoy something, the same thing, Â for the first time, twice. Ask any drug addict, that's the dream  Â  Â
698	DebL66	2014-04-27	I liked most of the episode but really dislike the whole Bran at Craster's Keep thing.  It just feels really wrong to me.  Also was not a fan of pedo-Marge.  That scene was creepy and gross.  Littlefinger's got nothing on Marge.  And please no Grey Worm/Missandei love connection.  Just no.
I did like the cleverness of Littlefinger saying his new friendship was growing strong.  Good one, writers.
Brienne looked amazing in her new armor and I love Pod.  His facial expressions are hilarious.
And wow...what a spoiler with the Others.  I actually didn't care for that.  I guess I don't like finding out something on the show that hasn't been revealed in the books.  I guess I better get used to that.  Also, I hate the appearance of the Others.  Not how I imagined them at all.  I thought they were supposed to be a bit more elegant and beautiful in their own fashion.  That guy seemed like a reject from a low budget horror movie.  Hard to imagine the Night's King falling in love with the female version of that.
This episode lost me from Craster's on.
699	Trebla	2014-04-27	I think if they had panned down to Tommen's blankets they would have seen him sporting a nice pup tent.
700	NightStark	2014-04-27	lol of course this TRASH show completely ignored that jaime raped cersei last week.


Don't just sit on the fence, tell us what you really think of the show:p
701	clawson24	2014-04-27	I was thinking of book 5 for that entire episode - when Jon was rallying the Craster's group and saying "Mormont got stabbed in the back by his own brothers," ouch. And the White Walker stuff! Heart of Winter? Given the choice between being raised by the mutineers at Crasters and becoming a WW, I choose WW, but the crying baby was so hard to hear that I muted it.


That baby lying alone crying in the snow was probably the hardest thing for me to watch in all four seasons of the show so far.
702	Stannis I	2014-04-27	Pardon me if this has already been discussed. Ive read most pages and did not see anything.
Â 
Pardons also if I sound like a newb, I admit I am not a GoT Master Scholar.
Â 
But, I know of rumors about Benjen being Coldhands. Was that cold hands in the last scene? The camera seemed to have lingered on his hands. I know one show of course was with the child, but the other seemed to have lingered on the opposite hand holding the chain. Then from the posterior view of him his hair seemed to be fashioned like they had Benjen's in season one.


Â 
Well, since there's nothing in the books about a Great Other or a king of White Walkers, it could be Coldhands... but most probably not.
703	E-Ro	2014-04-27	^nope, only stannis haters would deny this episode debunked the stannis is nk theory.Sweet vindication

Maybe he'll ride up there and tell that pale horned freak to bend the knee?Â
706	Bastard of Boston	2014-04-27	I felt so uncomfortable watching the end of this episode, heh. It felt like I was watching something I wasn't supposed to see...I felt like such a voyeur. Whoa.
707	Fat Mac	2014-04-27	That WW stuff was crazy. I loved it though.
Â 
It didn't really spoil anything, just kind of confirmed what was implied in the books. I thought it was wicked.
708	Vaellyn Cerwyn	2014-04-27	"Sansa's not a killer....Not yet, anyway."
Â 
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, WRITERS.


Â 
Wow, missed that part, but now that you've mentioned it... it's true. Sansa's training to be a new Cersei, so yes she'll become a killer later (TWOW, season 6 or 7)
709	go joff go	2014-04-27	lol I thought the same!
The they give stannis other devil horns. D&d obviously hate stannis other and are in the process of ruining him.

Locke was created for the show, and replaced Hoat in the series. So one in the same, Martin requested the name change as the were not going to use much of the character he created.
713	E-Ro	2014-04-27	Maybe he'll ride up there and tell that pale horned freak to bend the knee?lol, it looked like something out of the power rangers. my reaction was to laugh uncontrollably when i saw it

716	boojam	2014-04-27	Finally the Targaryen sigil, took four seasons.No dragons names yet.I thought Roose tasked Locke to take a troop of guys to Castle Black?Tho it kind of makes more sense this way.I wondered how they were going to get Locke mixed up with a Stark.Apparently Locke get killed during or after the Craster Keep dust up.The Other's stuff, hmm... is that D&D's invention ? Or they get it from George?Sooo... what the hell do you do with a baby wight?Very strange.
717	lostinwesteros	2014-04-27	Yeah, I was kind of wavering back and forth between 'they've totally screwed this up and nothing really happened this episode' and 'this is a whole new ball game, I like that were getting new adventures.'  I'm remembering in the past when I got upset about the changes, I finally realized this is TV, and they've only got 10 episodes per book, basically. I just don't want Bran and Company (especially Hodor) and the dogs hurt, but I like the possibility of Jon catching up with Bran. Not Locke, though.  It's time for somebody to fetch a block for him.
718	NightStark	2014-04-27	Theories on how Bran & Co are going to get away from Craster's?

It will actually make more sense Jon lets his guard down to a Brother that has been loyal to him since he arrived than one he's feuded with for several months.
Â 
MarshLocke's motivations also make allot of sense as well since he would be facing the Boltons after the letter, and have an understandable "well ****" moment.

For all that I defend the necessary changes the show has made to the books, you are right about the appearance of the Others.Â  They are written as elegant and beautiful, not as rejects from a low-budget horror movie, which is precisely what they look like on the show.

728	clawson24	2014-04-27	I think too much is being made of the changes to Bran's story.Â  This is clearly a case of needing to keep the character busy for a couple of episodes since he does not have much material to work through.Â  Nothing consequential is going to come of Bran's capture, which is precisely why Meera was not raped, Hoder was not killed, and so forth.
Â 
As book readers, this amounts to empty calories, so it does not really work for us.Â  That said, the grand majority of television viewers are not book readers, so they really do have a stake in this storyline and do not know what will come of it.


Agreed. With Coldhands cut, all Bran had on the agenda was walking through the woods for the entire season, which simply doesn't cut it. He's one of the most important characters in the entire series, and needs to remain onscreen and interesting/important to viewers. I want to see how they move forward with this Bran/Craster's/Jon plot first, but I'm fine with the change.

They had to do the Bran stuff because they can't have him getting to BR this early and they can't just keep having him not involved in anything. This will give him more interactions and screen time.
The last seen has been long suspected, but those also look like the real Others, watching it on On demand again to get a better look and see what the commentary says if anything. I suspect those are the real Others as they are not in rags, don't look undead and look like a different race.

To break up the second airing of Game of Thrones for another hack liberal comedian. How nauseating. I guess HBO's prioritizes it's political coverage above it's storytelling.

True.
Motivation is quite different... Marsh betrays Jon after, because he believes Jon is destroying the Night's Watch with the wildlings. Locke is a Bolton agent, so the betrayal happens before (Locke goes there with that purpose).

And tbh they could've had Jon go to Craster's without knowing Bran was there, just imagine the dramatic tension that would bring!
Â 
That Darth Maul looking dude was pretty surprising though. And there was something about 13 and the Night's King? I'm pretty sure there were that many shadows behind frozen Darth Maul.

Do the babies grow into....? Full grown Others? Babies are pretty useless when it comes to killing people so I am assuming they may be growing an army. That would take some time to do. This is interesting. Or perhaps this is how they procreate, and this kind of thing isn't very prevalent. Any ideas?

765	boojam	2014-04-27	Well, since there's nothing in the books about a Great Other or a king of White Walkers, it could be Coldhands... but most probably not.No Melisandre mentions The Great Other in Storm of Swords.Melisandr's thinks R'hllor represented by Stannis should go to the wall to defeat the Lord of Darkness.George made that all murky to me in the books, since by the end of Dance Stannis is off messing with Roose.The whole Great Other story , others and wights stuff is just thin in the books so far in the novels.
766	booknerd2	2014-04-27	At one point during the episode I was wondering if I had read the same books. Not that I hated the changes, but ehh they were pretty contrived. And tbh they could've had Jon go to Craster's without knowing Bran was there, just imagine the dramatic tension that would bring!
Â 
That Darth Maul looking dude was pretty surprising though. And there was something about 13 and the Night's King? I'm pretty sure there were that many shadows behind frozen Darth Maul.


Â 
Â 
Sorryâ<U+0080>¦the Darth Maul cracked me up.
Â 
Yeah, I knew it looked familiar. A cross between Darth Maul and the Dark Lord, because he looked like Voldemort too.
Â 
LOL!
767	TheReal_Rebel	2014-04-27	It's not ruinign the next book, it's long been suspected that the Others transform the babies, it's nearly canon at this stage. That ending spoils nothing from the next book.
I suspected but I don't believe anyone thinks of it as "cannon" as it does not appear in the Good Books of GRRM.
But it does fit into the overall theme of "no absolute evil".
Someone said that at this point The WWs are now in the running for Best Parents in Westeros!

768	clawson24	2014-04-27	I agree! How is this not going to ruin the next book? I don't mind deviating from the books, in fact some of the show's changes have been really good. But spoilers of something we haven't read (or that hasn't been written) is not cool. IMHO!


HBO and the show runners aren't concerned about the feelings of book readers, like it or not. They own the rights to the books and can go at any pace they choose. They will make whatever changes and present whatever information to viewers that they feel moves the story along in the way they want it to. If book readers are uncomfortable potentially learning information on screen before they do when WoW comes out, they pretty much need to watch at their own risk.

I'm sorry, I was talking about some sort of Great White Walker, no reference to the Other of Melisandre's beliefs (in the books they say the Others more often than White Walkers).
Melisandre mentions the Other, the One Whose Name Cannot Be Spoken, but that is a deity, in opposition to R'hollor.

It's not even realistic. Â Just to be utterly crass: Are we expecting that they would be constantly raping day/night so that when we 'randomly' check in there's about 3 rapes going on in the main living area at once? Â Do the mutineers have some kind of magical stamina powers? Â

She dismissed him as "Lord Commander." Â She was more concerned with him having visited Tyrion. Â Do you really expect Cersei to care about that right now when her son and king just died? Â Sansa escaped, and she's to marry Loras as well. Â I don't see why everyone expects her to react like, say Sansa would if she were to be raped. Â Jaime's had sex with her countless times.

Don't think it's "the Great Other". As far as we're aware at this point, "the Great Other" (if it does exist) is not a corporeal being but a god that's warred for all eternity with Rh'llor. I doubt it's some slightly different looking version of the other White Walkers we've already been exposed to. I'm guessing the thing that touched the baby was a more important, more powerful, or different variation of White Walker.

I actually liked it too. I was really worried it would go in an over-the-top sexual direction, but the way they did it was perfect and not distasteful. Re-casting Tommen as a pre-teen/teenager basically means you HAVE to do it this way. There's no way that kid WOULDN't be infatuated with Margaery.

They are being awful human beings, raping and drinking out of Mormont's skull. They have Ghost caged up and Rask was teasing him so I hope Ghost rips him up. They gave away a baby to the others,and the babies cries attracted Bran and crew. Summer got captured in a trap, then they captured Bran and crew (and Bran admited who he was).

- Jaime and Brienne scene. Loved it. Â (I am choosing to forget Jaime was even in last week's episode)
Â 
- Ser Pounce! Â You are a true knight Ser Pounce! Â  
- I liked the extra Grey Worm stuff.
Â 
Negatives:
Â 
- Bronn trying to school Jaime about being a 'low-class', 'rough and tumble' fighter. Â Hey writers? Â Remember that time Jaime killed his cousin with a rope? (iirc?) Â Jaime doesn't need your bad-boy lessons, Bronn.
Â 
- More <unnecessary> Rape.
Â 
Meh:
Â 
- I'm not sure about the Bran changes.

Must be some weird fantasy of hers.
836	SwingDatSword	2014-04-27	Doesn't this show have enough storylines going on without starting a new one with Missandei and Grey Worm?Â 


When things started heating up in that conversation, I found myself getting really bummed out thinking this could become a "thing"

Â 
It has yet to be revealed in the books what happens to Craster's sons, who the white-walkers are, how they come to be, and who the Great Other is.
Â 
The last segment seemed to suggest an answer to all of those things, which is really a bit obnoxious and horrifying for book readers who'd rather not have the original material spoiled by the adapted material.
841	7th-key	2014-04-27	Is it just me or those producers or whatever seem to be kinda obsessed with rape?


Â 
Â 


Have you ever read the books?


Â 
Not really an argument since the show isn't really following the books that much.
Â 
Besides is not a matter of how much rape, but in which way it's presented.

843	booknerd2	2014-04-27	Did you not see?
Â 
Bran Jojen Meera and Hodor got captured trying to free the captured Ghost, and Summer got trapped. Â The mutineers know Bran is a Stark. Â The mutineers were rapey with Craster's wives. Â The last of Craster's sons was born and left in the woods. Â A WW took the baby to a Stonehenge looking place and another WW with horns touched the baby and turned his eyes blue.

it wasn't obvious at first watch and some of us questioned it
847	Tyrion_is_Omar	2014-04-27	IMHO, the only major change is Jon knowing about Bran being alive and Â going to craster's, in part, to look for him.Â 
And can be easily fixed if for instance, karl says to Jon that they killed his little brother to provoke him when actually Bran escaped.Â 
So, Jon like on the books, Â still would Â believe that Bran is dead. The only change is that he would believe that was Karl and not Theon the one that did it.Â 
IMHO, the all situation Ghost being caged is similar to Greywind being caged and could work as a mirror and foreshadow:Â 
Greywind was caged and end up dead/ Robb suffered a murder attempt and end up dead
Ghost was caged and end up escaping/Jon suffered a murder attempt and escapes( hopefully).Â 
Â 
And also, Jon saying doing what is right and also avenge the lord commander that was like their father could work as foreshadow to Janos Slynth, doing what is right and by doing it also avenge his father.Â 
Â 
Also, I think that Locke will be the one that tries to kill Jon under Bolton 's orders because if both believe that Bran is dead, Jon becomes a danger like Ramsay said.

What did you expect? Meera saying "you can't do this because I have rights!!"? They would have laughed at her face.

The only one of those it answered is what happens to his sons and we pretty much knew that already. It has about as much acceptance on here as R+L=J.
850	ckal	2014-04-27	1) They killed one slave master in Meereen and the city is now hers. What?
Â 
2) The Others in the books are beautiful creatures and GRRM has stated this before. They bear no resemblance to the show's 'White Walkers' so there is no point to even theorize about what the Others truly are based on the show's depiction.
Â 
3) Inside the Episode:Â https://www.youtube....h?v=Zz5K_j4TRMs

"Killed" is even a stretch. When I first watched it, it looked like they were all running in to kill him, but when when they got there the shot held too long and they just looked like they were wanting to give him a group hug.
Â 
I gave the awkward scene a pass, when they were hanging them up like the children since they could just be detaining him, but it was still lame.Â 
Â 
For the show to be acting like they need to make stuff up to keep the non reader fans into it, it seems like they really rushed through that part of the story which could of had some relevant, true-to-story action

Pretty sure that guy isn't the Great Other; as other people have pointed out, the Great Other is a diety and doesn't have a physical body from all accounts. That guy is an important Other no doubt but not the Great Other.Â 
Â 
Tonight's ep was pretty meh for me as a whole. I'm not entirely a book purist but did think a lot of the changes were once again unnecessary/annoying. Any scene involving Tyrion, Jaime, Bronn, Brienne, Pod, LF or Sansa was well executed. Everything else was meh to bad except for the end, which was pretty cool to watch. It's nice for us to be spoiled for once, although it will undoubtedly be cooler to read that scene in TWoW.Â 
Â 
As for the Dany stuff, I'm really dissapointed with how that played out. The Jorah-Selmy Mereen takeout was her final act as a badass char before she essentially becomes zzzzzZZZZZZZZzzzzZZZZ.

Â 
OK, remember the good old days when we talked about the small changes, and we complained about them? Well, we crossed the Rubicon now and its official. GoT has officially gone from being based on ASOIAF to being inspired by it...Â 
Â 
There were some good moments of the tonight's episode:
Â 
1. "Sansa is not a killer... Not yet, anyway"
Â 
2. Ser Pounce... Glorious day indeed
Â 
3. But I do know - Olenna, great as always.
Â 
4. Jaime/Brienne...
Â 
There are some weird changes that I don't know how they will play it. I'd like to think that this conundrum between Jon and Bra will result in some satisfactory conclusion and that we might see those 2 stories back on track. As for Others, I am not certain this counts like a change, but more like logical continuation of the story told by POV we haven't met in the books. Dany's story has been rushed, too rushed and kinda felt bad... Also, the nudity this year hasn't been prominent as previous seasons, but it is rather disgusting to put it where it shouldn't be... I mean, it just shows lack of creative process and intelectual approach to the subject.

The requested episode could not be found. Have this fan-fictioned/unreleased-book-spoiling-contrivance instead.
878	Paeon	2014-04-27	As a book reader I thought the final scene was a big spoiler since it confirms that there is another power behind the white walkers controlling them which may imply some type of intelligence (rather than just some deadly force of nature as the white walkers have seemed so far). Sure we have heard of the "Great Other" but I always thought it was implied that it was a "god" like figure that was worshiped by the white walkers in comparison to Rhllor being worshiped by humans. The thing that touched the baby was obviously not a white walker, and there were many of them in the distance so we may have the creatures which worship the great other.
Â 
And they were not children of the forest either which pretty much kills theories that they controlled the WW's too.

Forget weapons. They just touch you and you transform? Like the "cheese touch" in the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series. Automatic cooties? Automatic freeze?
Â

I think what's best is just to try as hard as possible to remind yourself to keep the book and show separated, like any adaptation. No adaptation will ever beat the books like any good piece of writing should do, but still FWIW HBO's done an excellent job with the series. Is it frustrating sometimes to watch plot lines completely altered, characters deleted and new content added seemingly without reason? Absolutely. But I think what's best to do is just for all of us to be grateful for what we have and try to enjoy both.
Â 
Â It's funny to think that years ago when Winteriscoming.net was getting started I know a bunch of us were just hoping that HBO would get the show to TWO SEASONS after grinding out for weeks and weeks the initial cast members. Now it's one of the most popular shows period and I have a ton of unsullied friends who are either reading the books season to season or have promised to start reading them once the show is done. Whether or not you want to quit watching the show is of course your decision but I think if you can separate them and accept the changes both can still be incredibly enjoyable.

It didn't reveal where they come from or who they really are or who the Great Other is, that guyÂ  at the end wasn't even him.

Other than what happens to Craster's sons, where the Others come from, who they are, how they are made, and who and where the Great Other/Night King might be, no . . . you are right, it didn't spoil a thing


Â 
Â 
OR
Â 
it could be more random shit DnD have made up.
Â 
But I guess that never happens, right?
Â 
Â 
Â 


Apparently HBO has confirmed that the character at the end is the Nights King. This makes fell slightly better since the NK is not an Other. Still not happy with the look.
Anyway, let's discuss this little revelation and it's implications.


Â 
Check Ran's response to that below:
Â 


Bear in mind that that's not written by David and Dan, or indeed necessarily by anyone in the production. It could well change if someone who's read the books who's writing this stuff took a leap of their own. I'm not saying it's necessarily the case, but things like that have actually happened before with the show.
893	Jasta11	2014-04-27	I was totally on board the White Walker scene... until the guy was revealed to be frozen Darth Maul. Now that made me go ''wuh?''. The ''normal'' WWs look quite cool as undead old men, if not in line with book canon, but this guy with fangs and horns? Come on, he looks right out of a Power Rangers episode.
894	Zman1863	2014-04-27	All this Great Other stuff.... Why are people so quick to take Melisandre at her word?

You must read with your eyes closed if you're surprised by this.
896	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-27	-What the motherfucking fuck!? That last 20 minutes were half fan-fiction, half WoW spoiler
Â 
-Those Others look like Dragonball characters. I want Goku to kick ass and save that baby
Â 
-Ser Pounce is so going to watch Tommen and Margaery bang
Â 
Well, overall it was...different, I really don't know what to think


have your seen the DBZ live action flick?
Â 
Dude, looks like piccolo

898	Newstar	2014-04-27	The closeup shot of Pod smiling excitedly at the idea of going off with Brienne on her quest made me unexpectedly emotional, knowing how Pod ended up at the end of AFFC (although I think--hope?--that he's still alive).
899	Justin Danford	2014-04-27	We already know what happens to Craster's sons;
Â 
Â 
It didn't reveal where they come from or who they really are or who the Great Other is, that guyÂ  at the end wasn't even him.


Â 
The book excerpt doesn't reveal if crasters sons are turned into wights or others â<U+0080><U+0094> a significant distinction. It also doesn't tell the method by which this happens. The show did both.
900	Fool of a Book	2014-04-27	Now what does that mean for anyone that faces them?
Â 
Forget weapons. They just touch you and you transform? Like the "cheese touch" in the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series. Automatic cooties? Automatic freeze?
Â 
Ok, I admit it. I get a kick out those books. Funny as all hell!
Â 
Crap, Jon and Westeros is screwed down the road. Dany better just roast them. People better make nice with her.
Â 
Kidding, I know show writers can divert, but still...


Well yeah the show might be exaggerating the single touch and instant transformation thing... but I've long thought there was some sort of parallel between the Stone Men and the WW's. Â And the Stone Men infect by touch, though it takes much longer.
901	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-27	The closeup shot of Pod smiling excitedly at the idea of going off with Brienne on her quest made me unexpectedly emotional, knowing how Pod ended up at the end of AFFC (although I think--hope?--that he's still alive).


It made me laugh, but yeah, I think he's okay.

Why would they turn them into wights? They already have plenty of them and can turn any human corpse into one, makes no sense that they would make a pact with Craster just to gain an extra few.
Â 
The woman in the passage also mentions that it becomes cold when they come..only happens with the Others.
Â 
There obviously had to be some sort of spell or other magic behind the change..they can't exactly send them to White Walker school to become one.

903	Bear Claw	2014-04-27	A touch to turn the baby to a WW.Â  How did Uncat and Beric turn? Maybe these are similar.

Â 
Factors of size or age, perhaps? Or other factors?
Â 
Can't believe still that this is something I would even be pondering this evening. LOL!
905	Trebla	2014-04-27	A touch to turn the baby to a WW.Â  How did Uncat and Beric turn? Maybe these are similar.


They had fire breathed into their lungs.
906	Ran	2014-04-27	Would have been clever if the child was turned by having the Other's frosty breath poured into it, actually, now that you mention it. But then again, the show really didn't go all the way with the "kiss of fire" thing, did they? Thoros just prays over Beric, IIRC.
907	Audrey Arryn	2014-04-27	So HBO wrote on their website that the "boss" other we saw was the Night's King?
908	Justin Danford	2014-04-27	Why would they turn them into wights? They already have plenty of them and can turn any human corpse into one, makes no sense that they would make a pact with Craster just to gain an extra few.
Â

Â 
I don't think Wights go wondering on their own, Others come with them. Sure they are probably being turned into others, but that idea is a theory presented by a distressed wife of Craster. That doesn't mean that is what happens, and it doesnt explain how it happens. Some say the sky is blue because they live inside the eye of a blue eyed giant. Hearsay is one thing. Authoritative exhibition is another.
Â 
No one should be surprised that Jon Snow is the love child of R+L. That doesn't mean the show should tell us before George does and everyone be okay with it because it was implied.
909	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-27	There's no evidence to support that the Night's King was anything but a man who was killed in the Age of Heroes by The King in the North and Joramun, King Beyond the Wall. I don't think that was the Night's King anymore than that was/is a typo by someone who is ill-informed on the history. Most likely that guy is just some special Other.
910	Audrey Arryn	2014-04-27	There's no evidence to support that the Night's King was anything but a man who was killed in the Age of Heroes by The King in the North and Joramun, King Beyond the Wall. I don't think that was the Night's King anymore than that was/is a typo by someone who is ill-informed on the history. Most likely that guy is just some special Other.


Or maybe the NK was a man turned into an other by his Queen?
911	Justin Danford	2014-04-27	Let's just agree to call him Darth Other till we find out
912	Fool of a Book	2014-04-27	Â The Night's King was a human... how did he grow horns if that was supposed to be him? Â sigh.
913	Paeon	2014-04-27	I always assumed that the babies were made into Others. But I thought it was a spoiler since they revealed that the white walkers are taking commands from someone else. Something that is much more human than the white walkers.
Â 
Also I don't think at all that the baby was turned into a WW as those seem much more like magical constructs than a living breathing creature. Seems that humans can potentially be transformed into that devil looking creature instead which looks more human than a WW.
Â 
Most importantly this has big implications for the rest of the book as now the battle we will be seeing at the wall won't just consist of a bunch of mindless white walkers herding zombies to the wall, but there are actually intelligent beings on the other side to contend with.
914	kaanchanoone	2014-04-27	OMG. OMG. OMG. OMG.

OMG! This is killing me! I'm all the way in India and at work and won't get to see the episode for a while WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
(No wait...don't tell me...)
915	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-27	I thought the NK was a human who fell in love with a Other. Not one himself. But maybe since apparently they can turn you into one with just a touch, he got other'd later on.
916	Nymeria-of-Royne	2014-04-27	Was that the Heart of Winter? The Great Other? Have we as book readers been spoiled?


that's what I want to know!
917	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-27	Â The Night's King was a human... how did he grow horns if that was supposed to be him? Â sigh.


Â 
His wife cheated on him.
918	Lord Voldemort	2014-04-27	Am I the only one really dissapointed that Margaery didn't seduce and sex Tommen?
Â 
I realized afterwords, that's it HBO and USA and that he's (the actor) probably too young...
Â 
Â 
Â 


I'm sure if they thought there was a huge spoiler they would mention it... They understand how popular the books are, obviously, and wouldn't spoil anything significant. Â This babble tonight about spoilers is comical. Â If you hadn't realized these things about the walkers by now then you should join the silent sisters.


Â 
WhyÂ  wouldn't they spoil stuff? It's a show; it's meant to spoil stuff. Just as books are meant to "spoil" stuff. What does "spoil" mean anyway, to you? Is it when stuff take place?
919	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-04-27	Game of Thrones meets Tool.
Â 
Absolutely insane ending.
920	Opethian	2014-04-27	So what is everyone's thoughts on the scene where Margaery raped Tommen? He's about 12 years old for christ sake.Â 
Â 
Margaery better be punished next episode for seducing a child for power.Â
921	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-27	Or maybe the NK was a man turned into an other by his Queen?


For all those asking, the Night's King was a human who well in love with an Other, then after like 13 years the King in the North and the King Beyond the Wall united to take him out because he was ruling the Nightfort as a King essentially. After his "fall" it was found he was sacrificing to the Others.
Â 
But of course in true GRRM ambiguity I'm pretty sure his "fall" is the only word used, so is it possible his wife survived and turned him into an Other, or a wight or something? Sure, I guess. Fall doesn't necessarily mean death but IIRC that while GRRM uses "fall" I've always taken that as "was killed".Â
922	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-27	I thought the NK was a human who fell in love with a Other. Not one himself. But maybe since apparently they can turn you into one with just a touch, he got other'd later on.


Â 
Well, that's the story that's been passed down through the generations in Westeros.
Â 
We have no idea how historically accurate GRRM means that to actually be, though he's told us Old Nan is meant to be a reliable source.
Â 
Â 


Â The Night's King was a human... how did he grow horns if that was supposed to be him? Â sigh.


Â 


Â 
His wife cheated on him.


Â
923	doghouse	2014-04-27	Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad that there was a convo between Jaime and Tyrion but it looks like â<U+0080><U+009C>sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been fucking Lancel, Kettleblack and Moonboyâ<U+0080><U+009D> will not happen.
Â 

Â 
Â 
I think Lancel will suffice.Â 
Â 

Also, if they are going to have a Coldhands, this is the time to do it since it was Coldhands who killed the mutineers in the book. If there is no Coldhands, this is the perfect time to have Jon Snow demonstrate his leadership skills so he has a reason to be voted as Lord Commander.Â

924	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-04-27	Some thoughts:
Â 
- I wonder how George feels about the show going to the Land of Always Winter before the books.
Â 
- Rast telling Hodor that in his place he would be King of the World made me think Hodor is indeed King of something. Â Not sure what his mysterious origins may be but there's certainly something there.
Â 
- Sansa not a killer yet? Â Who knows, Littlefinger might indeed get what he deserves.
Â 
- Other than that, it was awesome to see Ser Pounce. Â My favorite moment in the entire episode.

Â 
Why is he still in Meereen?
Â 
How does this make the story better?
Â 
I doubt most casual viewers even remember who Jorah is or that hes meant to be important to Daenerys, and, no, having her remind the audience is beyond weak and shallow. Delaying his exile does nothing good. If he was actually an impotant character in the TV series then I could maybe understand pushing his exile back as a main event because how her ASOS arc ends. But he has nothing to do, or any personal interaction with Dany for 2 seasons and you cut all his book material out then its not the case.Â

so the lord of light and the others are like Yin and Yang?Â  Also, sure, I figured the babies weren't being killed exactly, but...I thought they might be food for the white walkers, who are not others (?) and not wights(?)...I can't seem to wrap my brain around this stuff in the books and now this fanfiction/TWOW spoiler.. I'm not sure what to think? it's difficult for me to say I like this new direction, I feel completely disoriented.Â  seriously, WTF was happening at Crasters?Â  I just kept saying What is Ghost doing int hat cage???

Â 


I'd agree that Lancel will be enough, as well as that they are absolutely setting it up for Jon to demonstrate his leadership skills at Craster's to validate his battle command at the Battle of the Wall in Ep. 9. Basically just Thorne and Slynt plotting against Jon>>>backfires>>>Jon's credibility goes up>>>>Jon is the one everyone listens to during the subsequent fighting at CB.Â

Was the wall built by the Others?
Â 
Did they wipe out the Children of the forest?
Â

I agree. we keep reading him saying he better "catch up". I wonder if he's feeling resentful to the writers but can't express anything but support.Â  the whole thing makes me uncomfortable quite frankly.Â  it's one thing to veer off the story but before the series has concluded?Â  idk
945	Vivianne	2014-04-27	WOW! I'm not sure I feel spoiled (maybe a bit soiled from crasters) but after reading this thread I'm relieved to know I wasn't the only one confused by the turn of events away from the books plot. I guess I'm a book purist but I will agree that Brans story line is Dull on page. I also think that Cold Hands is important to his arc (and I hope its Ben Stark )

Â 
A joke character nobody gives a shit about.Â 
Â 
How is learning he was a spy going to leave Dany in tears as it does in the novels?Â 
Â 
He has had every single last scene from ASOS involving him cut. He says "Rhaegar fought"... and thats it.Â 
Â 
Theres no scene where he kisses her.
Â 
There isn't the tension and hostility between him and Dany. Like when she slaps him in the face in the docks of Astapor.
Â 
There isn't him taking Dany to one side and telling her not to trust the other men around her.
Â 
Theres no him being a hypocrite who looks bad.
Â 
There aren't tender moments between him and her or when shes clearly cares for him. Like when he (not Daario BTW) returns from the Battle of Yunkai and she praises him or when she says that he has been like a brother to her but his jealousy will not do.
Â 
Â 
That is much more than some joke character that nobody gives a shit about. You really think people are going to give a shit about "ser friendzone" getting exiled or understand if Dany gives a shit?Â 
Â 
Now its one thing if you, Ellio and co on this site enjoy heaping praise on these changes that give Grey Worm to do. Well, I don't agree. Obviously you, like D&D, detested the book scenes between Dany and Jorah so you're perfectly glad they were cut. Fine, thats your opinion. Go roll with it.

WORST. EPISODE. EVER.


Â 
And no Mace 
Â 
And no Arya 
Â 
No Tywin, amazingly, and no Stannis The Mannis.Â  And I think Olenna was saying goodbye (she'll be joining the Living But Gone roster, alongside Hot Pie and The Great Salladhor Saan, which is at least fine company)
Â 
And no Team Bolton Â<U+0099>, either, which I was all ready for since it looked like the pattern was going to be Boltons In Even-Numbered Episodes.
Â 
Â 
However, I am all about that Uncharted Waters ending so I can overlook some of my favorite characters not appearing.
949	Nymeria-of-Royne	2014-04-27	I thought the NK was a human who fell in love with a Other. Not one himself. But maybe since apparently they can turn you into one with just a touch, he got other'd later on.


the night king fell in love with an Other?Â  So are they genderless or is it a gay love story?Â  that would be kind of random. I can not wrap my brain around the difference between the "other's", the "wights" & the "white walkers"
950	clawson24	2014-04-27	Â 
Other than what happens to Craster's sons, where the Others come from, who they are, how they are made, and who and where the Great Other/Night King might be, no . . . you are right, it didn't spoil a thing


Â 
We already knew that the Others come from the Land of Always Winter. We certainly don't know how ALL the Others are made. Are every single one of them converted from humans? Highly unlikely. What does it mean that we know "who they are"? We have no idea if that Other was the Great Other (I highly, highly doubt it as the Great other is a God and not an average sized corporeal being). Quit trollin'.

A joke character nobody gives a shit about.Â 
Â 
How is learning he was a spy going to leave Dany in tears as it does in the novels?Â 
Â 
He has had every single last scene from ASOS involving him cut. He says "Rhaegar fought"... and thats it.Â 
Â 
Theres no scene where he kisses her.
Â 
There isn't the tension and hostility between him and Dany. Like when she slaps him in the face in the docks of Astapor.
Â 
There isn't him taking Dany to one side and telling her not to trust the other men around her.
Â 
Theres no him being a hypocrite who looks bad.
Â 
There aren't tender moments between him and her or when shes clearly cares for him. Like when he (not Daario BTW) returns from the Battle of Yunkai and she praises him or when she says that he has been like a brother to her but his jealousy will not do.
Â 
Â 
That is much more than some joke character that nobody gives a shit about. You really think people are going to give a shit about "ser friendzone" getting exiled or understand if Dany gives a shit?Â 


Â 
I give a shit.

953	Tyrion1991	2014-04-28	Â 
I give a shit.


Â 
Why?
Â 
You said it yourself the "character" of Jorah in the show is a joke.
Â 
Joke characters don't get sympathy. I imagine they'll be making more memes and funny videos about it.

954	Justin Danford	2014-04-28	- I wonder how George feels about the show going to the Land of Always Winter before the books.
Â 


Â 

Â 
Myself, I think the writers who allow fan fiction are making a mistake. I am not saying here that the people who write fan fiction are evil or immoral or untrustworthy. The vast majority of them are honest and sincere and passionate about whatever work they chose to base their fictions on, and have only the best of intentions for the original author. But (1) there are always a few, in any group, who are perhaps less wonderful, and (2) this door, once opened, can be very difficult to close again.

Â - George RR Martin on Fan-Fiction
Â 
Â 
Sure,Â  the show isn't actually fan-fiction but . . .
955	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-28	From what I've seen, a lot of people like and sympathize with Ser Friendzone. Plenty of fucks will be given when Dany exiles him.
956	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-28	the night king fell in love with an Other?Â  So are they genderless or is it a gay love story?Â  that would be kind of random. I can not wrap my brain around the difference between the "other's", the "wights" & the "white walkers"


The NK fell in love with a woman who has the same description as the Others, her description is something like "skin as white as moonlight, cold as ice to the touch" IIRC. So in summation NK was a man who had an Other wife and a bunch of freaky and def. NSFW stuff went down with them at the Nightfort before the NK seemingly was taken out.

Â 
- I wonder how George feels about the show going to the Land of Always Winter before the books.
Â 


Well I dont think he can do anything now tbh the rights have already been sold and GRRM has little control on the storyline of the show.
958	Tyrion1991	2014-04-28	From what I've seen, a lot of people like and sympathize with Ser Friendzone. Plenty of fucks will be given when Dany exiles him.


Â 
Â 
An inferior version to the books in every way. You don't just have that scene in isolation. Its the culmination of every Dany/Jorah scene in the series. Most of which happens in ASOS. Most of which D&D cut and replaced with..nothing. Hes been basically mindlessly following Dany for 2 seasons as a glorified extra. You don't just leap into a big scene like that without ANY set up or build up.

961	Raksha 2014	2014-04-28	Not a favorite episode of mine. Â In fact, I don't think it was a particularly good episode.
Â 
No Arya, Hound, or Oberyn.
Â 
Deviating from the books in that Sansa is much more vocal and definite in her distrust of Littlefinger.
Â 
Why was Craster's last son still alive when the Other brought it to the Great Other Ice Hideout - a newborn, insufficiently wrapped up (chest and and hands exposed), survives for hours in freezing weather? Â Was the poor kid a super-baby? Â It should have been at the very least blue-lipped and unconscious by the time they Other'd it.
Â 
Why had the mutineers gone to the trouble of keeping Ghost alive and caged? Â Planning on running a zoo, perhaps? Â Or to lure Jon Snow and some friends to come for him - why? Â Made no sense to me. Â Or were they planning on eating poor Ghost?
Â 
Margaery is just so super-cute and charming that she waltzes into the bedroom of the child heir to the Iron Throne late at night unchallenged? Â 
Â 
The Queen of Thorns is going home; too bad; I wanted to see a conversation between her and the Red Viper - who's more deadly, at least in terms of conversation?
Â 
Â 
On the plus side, I loved the Grey Worm/Missandei conversation. Â And Brienne's new armor is gorgeous.Â
962	crackpot theorist	2014-04-28	This episode totally lines up with my crackpot theory. I will now enlighten you all:
Â 
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d like to throw a curveball into the discussion about who is Azor Ahai.
Â 
First I think the timeline is all wrong. Everyone is discussing fully developed characters that will defeat the Others in the near future. What I think everyone is forgetting is that this particular winter will last for a very long time. Azor Ahai has just been born. Not Dany or Jon, AA is an infant. And the Others will only be defeated at the end of a very long winter (15-20 years).
Â 
My crackpot theory is none other than â<U+0080><U+009C>the little monsterâ<U+0080><U+009D>, Gillyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s baby. Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe me? I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t blame you. But hear me out.
Â 
Similar to the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King story, a member of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, who is a Targaryen sired a son from a Wildling (or female Other a la the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King). There are only two potential candidates, Brynden Rivers or Aemon Targaryen.Â  The mother tries to return her baby to Castle Black but is chased off.Â  She eventually raises the baby, who grows up to be the bastard Craster.
Â 
Craster is allowed to live but has vowed to always sacrifice his male heirs to the Others. Why? Because the Others foresee Azor Ahai being born and try to prevent it. The bloodline is preserved because Craster is a monster whose coat of arms should read â<U+0080><U+009C>Breeding Inwardsâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Â 
But seriously Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s action mirror the biblical Herod ordering the death of male babies because of a prophecy.Â  There are also parallels of Kronos devouring his sons because he is destined to be overcome by his own sons. FYI from Wikipedia Robert GravesÂ proposed thatÂ cronosÂ meant "crow", related to the Ancient Greek wordÂ corA<U+008D>nÄ<U+0093>Â (ÎoÎ<U+00BF>II<U+008E>Î1Î·) "crow", noting that Cronus was depicted with a crow, as were the deities Apollo, Asclepius, Saturn andÂ Bran.While the birth of Gillyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t exactly be lined up with the waking of dragons, the Others seemed keen to put an end to him. Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t discount the little guy.
Â 
And I still think the timeline is off. At least a decade or more will pass before the novels come to a close. Lots of everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s favorite characters will die, in the south to war and disease, in the north to starvation and Others.Â
963	of man and wolf	2014-04-28	Â 
I don't think Wights go wondering on their own, Others come with them. Sure they are probably being turned into others, but that idea is a theory presented by a distressed wife of Craster. That doesn't mean that is what happens, and it doesnt explain how it happens. Some say the sky is blue because they live inside the eye of a blue eyed giant. Hearsay is one thing. Authoritative exhibition is another.
Â 
No one should be surprised that Jon Snow is the love child of R+L. That doesn't mean the show should tell us before George does and everyone be okay with it because it was implied.


Maybe George should hurry on up then and get moving. Of course the show is going to catch up.
964	clawson24	2014-04-28	Why do people keep calling the shows changes "fan fiction"? There are significant changes sure, some I like, some I don't, but they are being written with explicit knowledge of how the series ends with freaking GRRM himself as a consultant and a 1-ep per season writer. People are acting like the show doesn't even vaguely resemble the books in any way any more.
965	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-28	yes yes, thanks for reminding me of this...is this a story told by Old Nan?


It is. It's a story I think most of the children in the north grow up hearing.
Â 
Also super unrelated but someone posted R+L=Hodor in the AV Club Review Comments and it made my night.Â
966	madprofessah	2014-04-28	THIS EPISODE HAD NO OBERYN!!!
Â 
I just realised.
Â 
Â 
WORST. EPISODE. EVER.


Â 
It's even worse than you think. NO TYWIN!! (And No Arya!)
967	Dany's Silver	2014-04-28	Not a favorite episode of mine. Â In fact, I don't think it was a particularly good episode.
Â 
No Arya, Hound, or Oberyn.

Â 
On the plus side, I loved the Grey Worm/Missandei conversation. Â And Brienne's new armor is gorgeous.Â 


Â 
I think they kept Craster's son alive to show the baby's transformation.
Â 
Since TV!Ghost growls (where Book!Ghost is completely silent), perhaps the mutineer pices of shit are keeping him around to provide a warning signal of advancing wights/Others.Â  I predict that I will enjoy watching Ghost fuck Rast's shit up next Sunday.
968	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-28	Hmm... I dunno, man... I dunno...
Â 
This episode.
Â 
How the hell did they manage to cage Ghost up? And why did they even bother - is an even better question. I dunno how I feel about this whole Other thing. I feel like they revealed it way too early, but whatever. Still plenty to learn about 'em I suppose. Tho, I didn't like the fact that that horned weirdo is the Night's King. He didn't look nearly as mysterious and interesting. And I'll also echo what others have said; that baby would've died before Rast or w/e the hell his name is put it down. But they're probably going with 'the-Other's-magic-protected-the-baby.'
Â 
And I dunno why, but I'm really starting to like Locke. I can only imagine what he's up to, but it's gonna be big.

I'm sure there will be a little build up, but it is no question but the biggest misuse of a talented actor (Iian Glen) in the entire series. Two seasons of exposition guy, followed by two seasons as an extra. What a waste... If they are inventing story-lines and subplots, why not give one of your top end talents something to do?
970	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-28	Â

975	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-04-28	Summer will rescue Ghost, just as Jon arrives, Jon, his boys' and the Wolfes will rescue Bran and the Reeds.They will then butcher the mutineers. Hodor dies, Bran enters his body and carries himself north to find a three eyed crow. Jon goes back to the wall to wait to get stabbed in the back.
976	pleonasm	2014-04-28	On another note, Mance Rayder has apparently been cribbing from Danny's invasion playbook. His advance on the Wall could be measured in geological time.
Â 
I realize they are saving all the marbles for episode 9, but maybe they should have mixed it up a little and had the battle staged earlier in the season.
That said, I'm all on board with the show giving Bran a subplot that wasn't another season of hiking/sledding Northwards, however a visit to Rape Town might not have been my first choice. And while I like the actor playing Tanner(?), who would have made a great Ramsey Bolton IMHO, do we really need another raper in our midst? I just found the whole story-line more exhausting than anything else. A lot of GOT style mustache twirling.

982	intheswamp	2014-04-28	The show is going to finish well before the books; there is no point getting upset about what can't be helped.
Â 
I liked the episode.Â  The show runners aren't going to not show the Others for the entire series like George does.Â  TV watchers won't put up with that crap like book readers will.Â 
Â 
The only scene that I didn't like was Dirk's endless rant about what a badass fighter he is.Â  It reminded me of the Thenn's speech about cannibalism earlier in the season.Â  We get it.Â  They are evil, tough guys.Â  You don't have to lecture us about it for 5 minutes.Â  Watching them rape, murder, and eat people for a few seconds gets the point across.
Â 
Someone needs to get Greyworm into a workout program.Â  I'm not saying he has to be big, but the guy doesn't even have muscle tone.Â  The Unsullied slaves are specifically chosen due to their size, strength, and speed.Â  He's just a little, skinny dude.

Please tell me: if you found a direwolf (or a very large wolf, for that matter), chained, would your first idea be: "Now, how do I kill this thing?"?.

I think not.

Â 
I almost wouldn't mind if they had at least done the scene where he kissed Dany. I would have chalked a lot of the rest down to lack of time which has affected the rest of the characters. But not a thirty second scene. Why bother having him talk to Barristan to re-establish that he loves Daenerys rather than do the book scene where he actually tries (and most importantly fails) to do something about it. There is no logic to that decision at all.
Â 
That and his exile are the two most important Jorah scenes. By far. To cut one of them out for no other reason than laziness or dislike of the character is beyond me. Yes, dragging Tyrion to Meereen is important in terms of the plot but frankly anyone could have done that for any reason. Those are the two most important scenes. Like the hound asking to take Sansa away and him dying by the road with Arya.Â 
Â 
Every time Dany thinks about Jorah in ADWD or Jorahs actual actions throughout ADWD, are defined by these two scenes and will continue to be so into Winds of Winter.Â 
Â 
Â 
No, they won't build it up. Theres way too much going on in terms of the dragons, Danys relationship with Daario and the downward spiral of Danys fortunes. This is going to be a random reveal thats handled over one episode.Â

FYI from Wikipedia Robert GravesÂ proposed thatÂ cronosÂ meant "crow", related to the Ancient Greek wordÂ corA<U+008D>nÄ<U+0093>Â (ÎoÎ<U+00BF>II<U+008E>Î1Î·) "crow", noting that Cronus was depicted with a crow, as were the deities Apollo, Asclepius, Saturn andÂ Bran.While the birth of Gillyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t exactly be lined up with the waking of dragons, the Others seemed keen to put an end to him. Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t discount the little guy.
Â 
Â 
Â 
And I still think the timeline is off. At least a decade or more will pass before the novels come to a close. Lots of everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s favorite characters will die, in the south to war and disease, in the north to starvation and Others.Â 


Â 
I find this quite inspired and really like it. I never gave Gilly's child much afterthought, but when you stop and think about it, he is the only surviving son of Craster, and if a great majority of the others = crasters sons, Gilly's little bundle has a whole lot of brothers that he is naturally directly in contrast to

Why had the mutineers gone to the trouble of keeping Ghost alive and caged? Â Planning on running a zoo, perhaps?Â  
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Please tell me: if you found a direwolf (or a very large wolf, for that matter), chained, would your first idea be: "Now, how do I kill this thing?"?.
Â 
I think not.

The Freys solved the same problem with poor Greywind quite easily. Â Unless the mutineers have no arrows or spears.

992	clawson24	2014-04-28	The show is going to finish well before the books; there is no point getting upset about what can't be helped.
Â 
I liked the episode.Â  The show runners aren't going to not show the Others for the entire series like George does.Â  TV watchers won't put up with that crap like book readers will.Â 
Â 
The only scene that I didn't like was Dirk's endless rant about what a badass fighter he is.Â  It reminded me of the Thenn's speech about cannibalism earlier in the season.Â  We get it.Â  They are evil, tough guys.Â  You don't have to lecture us about it for 5 minutes.Â  Watching them rape, murder, and eat people for a few seconds gets the point across.
Â 
Someone needs to get Greyworm into a workout program.Â  I'm not saying he has to be big, but the guy doesn't even have muscle tone.Â  The Unsullied slaves are specifically chosen due to their size, strength, and speed.Â  He's just a little, skinny dude.


Unsullied were never and will never be particularly big or strong. They're freaking castrated. Incredibly fit and disciplined maybe, but smaller than a normal man.

997	Westacular	2014-04-28	So the Darth Other is the Night's King and he is a part of a group of 13, he was the 13th Lord Commander of the watch.... so... were they all the orignal 13 lord commanders?
Â 
Was the wall built by the Others?
Â 
Did they wipe out the Children of the forest?
Â 
Are the first Men/Starks decended from the Others?
Â 
Is being an other a disease that is passed on via touch?


Â 
That's an awful big leap to make based on there being twelve blurry background figures.
Â 
So: probably not, no, not quite yet, hell no, and apparently sort of.
Â 
Â 


the night king fell in love with an Other?Â  So are they genderless or is it a gay love story?Â  that would be kind of random. I can not wrap my brain around the difference between the "other's", the "wights" & the "white walkers"


Â 
The Others and the White Walkers are the same thing; the show just changed the name because Lost. They are magic ice people who freeze everything around them, and have the power to raise the dead as frozen zombies (aka wights).
Â 
At the end of the episode, the Extra Magical Dracula King of the White Walkers turned the baby into a baby white walker. I don't see why people are assuming he's a different species just because he looked a bit different from the other white walkers we've see so far.
Â 
They are presumably gendered but incapable of sexual reproduction, and rely on turning infants to slowly grow their numbers.

The Nights King was almost vampiric.Actually, making them look evil even as they were saving a little baby made me think they're going to be a lot more grey. GRRM and D&D have both talked about how much the "ugly/scary-looking = evil" thing in most fantasy annoys them, and what better way to subvert that than to film a scene where the White Walkers are doing something that looks menacing and hideous, but may actually be good when you think about it?Of course they're clearly not the heroes of the story. For one thing, there aren't any heroes. For another, they weren't just saving the baby; they were saving the baby by turning it into one of them. Whether the parallel is Turkish Janissaries or 20th-century vampires, this is clearly a gift that's self-serving to the giver and not without drawbacks to the recipient.

1014	Mr. Marijuana	2014-04-28	Way too many changes from the novels. They are creating an alternative universe.
1015	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-28	Locke was sent to the NW as a mole, because the Boltons assume Bran and Rickon would run to Jon for protection, as he is their closest living relative.Â  Which makes total sense, as Maester Luwin told them to do exactly that as he was dying.
Â 
Locke is obviously going out of his way to ingratiate himself to Jon (I expected him to be the first volunteer, to be honest) in the hopes that Jon will let slip info about where he's hiding Bran and Rickon, since he assumes that's what Jon's doing.Â  And after all, the NW is willing to shelter orphaned youth, as evidenced by Son Of Potato Farmer Man.Â  Not the case, of course, but Jon is about to unwittingly lead Locke right to Bran, so the plan is accidentally working and even sooner than expected.

Oh come on, you know its gonna get thwarted. Asses are going to get kicked and Bran will get away. Not sure just where they are going with Locke but im interested in it. I still think he might be in it for the long haul and be the Bowen.
1020	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-04-28	It really doesn't make any sense for Locke to be Bowen marsh.  Bowen was doing it for the Watch not for a lordship.  I would be really disappointed if Jon's killer was evil.

There are significant changes sure, some I like, some I don't, but they are being written with explicit knowledge of how the series ends with freaking GRRM himself as a consultant and a 1-ep per season writer. People are acting like the show doesn't even vaguely resemble the books in any way any more.

1026	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-28	I can honestly see Locke being pivotal in saving Bran from a hostage situation in order to ingratiate himself to Jon assuming that Jon will then trust him enough to tell him where Rickon is, not knowing that Jon Snow Knows Nothing [about Rickon's whereabouts].
Â 
I will crack up if it plays out similarly to the Robb/Bran/Theon hostage situation.
1027	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-28	Hmmm, Jon is in position to possibly meet/save Jojen and reconnect with Ghost next week.
Â 
I wonder if Jojen will be able to sense the warginess in Jon and tip him off to it [which Jon will of course initially reject], since Jon has not yet had that aspect of his character start up in the show.
1028	clawson24	2014-04-28	Anyone else even more excited now to see how they portray Bloodraven and the Children of the Forest? Their reveal and seeing what their physical appearance is like on the show has been one of my most anticipated moments for quite some time now. I know some people aren't in love with the appearance of the Night's King/Other that changed the baby, but all of this stuff has me even more excited for the end of this season. Not expecting it to be exactly what I imagined but the CoTF and BR's descriptions are so awesome that I think it'll be cool nonetheless.

Â 
No wonder this show is so popular. Truly painful to watch.
Â 
But hey! the show is epic, Hodor is epic, Martin got "truckload of money" delivered and we will probably see resolution in the much quicker way, who has time to read fat books when you have this "epic" show with such cool actors.

1031	tmug	2014-04-28	This episode totally lines up with my crackpot theory. I will now enlighten you all:
Â 
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d like to throw a curveball into the discussion about who is Azor Ahai.
Â 
Â 
Â 
First I think the timeline is all wrong. Everyone is discussing fully developed characters that will defeat the Others in the near future. What I think everyone is forgetting is that this particular winter will last for a very long time. Azor Ahai has just been born. Not Dany or Jon, AA is an infant. And the Others will only be defeated at the end of a very long winter (15-20 years).
Â 
Â 
Â 
My crackpot theory is none other than â<U+0080><U+009C>the little monsterâ<U+0080><U+009D>, Gillyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s baby. Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe me? I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t blame you. But hear me out.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Similar to the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King story, a member of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, who is a Targaryen sired a son from a Wildling (or female Other a la the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King). There are only two potential candidates, Brynden Rivers or Aemon Targaryen.Â  The mother tries to return her baby to Castle Black but is chased off.Â  She eventually raises the baby, who grows up to be the bastard Craster.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Craster is allowed to live but has vowed to always sacrifice his male heirs to the Others. Why? Because the Others foresee Azor Ahai being born and try to prevent it. The bloodline is preserved because Craster is a monster whose coat of arms should read â<U+0080><U+009C>Breeding Inwardsâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Â 
Â 
Â 
But seriously Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s action mirror the biblical Herod ordering the death of male babies because of a prophecy.Â  There are also parallels of Kronos devouring his sons because he is destined to be overcome by his own sons. FYI from Wikipedia Robert GravesÂ proposed thatÂ cronosÂ meant "crow", related to the Ancient Greek wordÂ corA<U+008D>nÄ<U+0093>Â (ÎoÎ<U+00BF>II<U+008E>Î1Î·) "crow", noting that Cronus was depicted with a crow, as were the deities Apollo, Asclepius, Saturn andÂ Bran.While the birth of Gillyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t exactly be lined up with the waking of dragons, the Others seemed keen to put an end to him. Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t discount the little guy.
Â 
Â 
Â 
And I still think the timeline is off. At least a decade or more will pass before the novels come to a close. Lots of everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s favorite characters will die, in the south to war and disease, in the north to starvation and Others.Â 


Â 
Â 
Sorry to break it to you but if this show stays somewhat true to the book, Gilly's baby gets switched with Mance Rayder's baby by Jon and Gilly's baby gets tossed into the fire by Melissandre. Sam and Gilly ride off to Oldtown with Mance's baby not even knowing.Â 
Â 
Great theory, well thought out, but if GRR wanted this to happen - the books do not follow.

Well i disagree that this is anyway near largely faithful adaptation, even if we talk about the first season.
I suggest you to watch Ellio and Linda arguments on their yt channel (even though our webmasters do say that the first season was largely faithful, where i disagree... look at the particular arguments that are in NO WAY nitpicking

You are more than entitled to your opinion. I just find it staggering that some people seem utterly shocked by the changes and perceived quality of the show. To call the show mediocre and fantastically dumbed down is again, an opinion you're perfectly entitled to, but one very few people seem to agree with. The show is a MASSIVE success both critically and in terms of viewership, with incredible production values for TV, some reputable actors giving terrific performances, and about as massive a scale as you're likely to see anywhere but in feature-film epics. The show is shooting concurrently in multiple countries around the world each season with the biggest cast of principal actors in TV history.
Â 
To even attempt to condense a story and a world as unfathomably large as ASoIaF into the space that they are forced to on the show is already an impressive feat. Changes are necessary to both trim the fat AND engage viewers who have no previous knowledge of the series and will never pick up one of the books or even come close to being able to remember most of the ancillary character's names and back stories. HBO owes book readers nothing. It's encouraging that D&D seem to legitimately be massive fans of the books and seem to be trying to bring GRRM's vision onto screen without utterly catastrophic changes, but that won't always be the case. They are trying to make as compelling a television show as possible, using an adaptation/variation of the ASoIaF stories as a basis.

I don't have a problem with changes, i don't wanna watch 100per cent the same thing i read, there is no use of that, i don't wanna another Sin City, who really needs that?
Â 
I have a problem that many characters and events just bear the same names from the books, I have a problem that this show treats their viewership like we're idiots so they need to stress out everything, NO subtlety from the books, I have a problem with boring, expected and stereotypical directing and adapting on screen.
Â 
Screenwriters can't be consistent even within their own character changes they made.
You know, Ned doesn't want for sansa's wrerewolf Lady to be killed by some butcher, so he slights her throat with a knife instead of using his longsword Ice.
Â 
Everything is so generic, expected, things i would expected from some stupid high budget flick, not from HBO.

1039	DrownedSnow	2014-04-28	This is the first episode of the season I didn't like. There was some really good stuff in there but overall not having the Ygritte battle right away this season has really screwed a bunch of things up. HBO clearly doesn't have the budget for certain things so they change them for the worse. It's such a shame because they've made so many wonderful changes as well. Oh well, it was a medicore episode but better than most of what's on TV.

1040	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-04-28	Just look at the sceneÂ  when Jon asks for volunteers , pay attention to the mediocre typical-hollywood background music, acting, directing, camera work... sums up the whole show which is incredibly hollywoodized version of phenomenal and original novels.
Â 
So hollywoodized, mediocre, fantasticaly dumbed down and adjusted for mass appeal.

Â 
No wonder this show is so popular. Truly painful to watch.
Â 
But hey! the show is epic, Hodor is epic, Martin got "truckload of money" delivered and we will probably see resolution in the much quicker way, who has time to read fat books when you have this "epic" show with such cool actors.
Â 
I just hope Illuminati conspiracy against fantasy fiction will be battled against so this show can get all the emmys, golden globes and whatnot.

Dude seriously relax.  We still have our books
1041	Andrey	2014-04-28	Dude seriously relax. We still have our books 


Â Well, are you sure about that, they're catching up...
I just want last two or three books totally , totally unaffected by this adaptation (and i hate that "[A] Game of thrones" (article "a" as the compromise)Â  title is replacing asoiaf everywhere).
Â 
Don't worry I'm relaxed cause i knew from the first few episodes of season two this will happen.
and i don't get excited when i'm consuming art () or typingÂ  whether i'm disappointed or otherwise.
The only time i got totally excited is when i read Bran's awakening chapter from AGOT and realized how much potential does book have then theÂ  adaptation.
Â 
It's more laughable to me to watch quasi-dramatic scenes even thoughÂ  show have many, if not the most great actors (kit harington is not one of them)
1042	Mel_Rose	2014-04-28	I haven't read the last 15 pages of the thread, so don't know if anyone's already suggested it, but I think one of the reasons we saw Craster's keep was specifically to link them to the Others - to see the women chanting "gift to the gods", be reminded about what happens to male craster babies and basically for all of that to lead us to the Others location and revelation about what happens to the babies.
Â 
In my eyes, the ending (which I thought was awesome) is not a spoiler. A spoiler spoils a plot development: Joff is poisoned, the Freys kill Robb etc. What is the spoiler? An unnamed son of Craster dies/is turned into an Other? I suspect (and of course I could be way wrong) that this information about them might not be in the future books (whose POV is going to show us that?) but it could be info in the World of Ice and Fire book. So it's more like background information available, rather than future plot events.
Â 
However, the implications of this revelation raises this question: since Craster's boys become Others, what does that imply about Gilly's baby who's currently at the Wall?
1043	Bayard	2014-04-28	Although the last scene was amazing I am very disappointed in Bryan Cogman. There are a lot of changes that will have important repercussions. They are trying to fix some stuff with the battle that will take place at Craster's next week but they are creating many others. You know, the butterfly effect. I still don't understand why they can't have some characters just stay in the background for a season. Why couldn't Bran show up in just 2-3 episode this season and the next? No, they added drama, and than they added a meeting with Jon (or at least something very close to that). They always think like that: why not take advantage of the proximity of some cool characters to see what they might chat about.
Â 
First we have Locke. I love the character and the actor, they are both great, but I have a feeling that he is going to replace Bowen Marsh. I'm not exactly against this, it might work, we just have to wait and see. Although it makes the Boltons a little too smart if Locke is the one with the knife at the end of season 5.
Â 
Than we have Jon knowing that Bran is alive. So, what will happen next season when Stannis offers him Winterfell?? If he knew his brothers were alive he wouldn't consider about it that long. At least that's the Jon i got from the books.
Â 
As for the white walkers, I didn't mind the spoiler. Do you really think this is the first time they've done this? They spoiled/confirmed/contradicted a lot of theories in the past. Remember the idea that Jeyne Westerling was pregnant? Destroyed. There are plenty more examples. I saw many posters commenting that the baby should be dead, or at least freezing after that journey. Do you forget that the white walkers make the weather colder around them? All that heat is going somewhere. I'm not saying they draw the heat to themselves , but if they can control the weather in one way, why no the other? is it that unbelievable that they could keep him in a warm bubble?

Brienne's storyline is literally in fast-forward ... she should be in a cell right now
Â 
If she ends up in the Â hands of the BWB by seasons end, where the hell do they go with her story next season? Â  its happening wayy too fast
1045	David Selig	2014-04-28	I liked this episode quite a bit. A lot of good stuff. Really well shot too, visually the most impressive episode in a while. NCW is an amazing Jaime.
Â 
The Northern plotline is quite stupid though. I don't care that they made changes from the books (this was a snoozefest in the books, plus I don't mind well done changes anyway), the problem is that many of these changes are just stupid.The White Walkers stuff was nice though.
1046	Greywolf2375	2014-04-28	I call bullshit. That baby would have had frostbite a long time ago. Everyone knows infants lose their heat through their heads.Â

Since start of season, I've tried to keep my monday night dinner menu in synch with the episode we watch that night. After Ep. 1's chickens and ep. 2 pigeon pie, I was sadly not at home last week and couldn't cook a rabbit stew...
So, tell me please, what's on the menu for ep. 4 ? (apart from iced baby apparently)
					
					
							Edited by FloredaA, 28 April 2014 - 05:10 AM.
1049	Ran	2014-04-28	The episode's menu is:
Â 
Roast pork with red wine (or, alternatively beer drunk from a skull).
1050	FloredaA	2014-04-28	Thanks! I may take the second option, if only I can find a drinking skull
1051	David Selig	2014-04-28	It should be wine from the skull, not beer, if you want to be really accurate.
1052	Nictarion	2014-04-28	So who the hell will rescue Bran from Craster's? Surely they won't have a scene with Bran and Jon together right? Jon knowing about him being alive is one thing, but an actual reunion, Idk how I'd feel about that change.
1053	ipsuel	2014-04-28	I expect a lot of weird things from the show, but Ice Maul was the last one on the list. Him having 12 friends is interesting though.

Â 
Well, based on the promo,

	Spoiler 
We see Jon & Co. fighting the Craster Crew. So the only thing I can think besides a reunion is during the commotion Bran escapes (probably wargs Ghost or Summer to help the fighting). However, Bran's likely to see Jon through a wolf, so I don't know why he wouldn't stick around. 

Â 
I'm putting 50-50 odds on a reunion
1055	T.C	2014-04-28	An improvement from last week but still boring, they focused too much on the north scenes. I understand why they changed Tommens actor now, just imagine the scene that occured on this episode with the original actor 
Â 
Lol @ Cersei acting fine with Jaime after what happened
1056	aussiegirl	2014-04-28	Very good episode.Â Not enoughÂ Arya of course:)
Â 
But I almost enjoyed every scene. Except for Littlefinger and Sansa. And Dany. I never enjoy Dany scenes anymore.
Â 
Littlefinger is still puffing out his lines and Sophie Turner has returned to saying her lines strangely.
I guess things are back to normal then. I gave her a fair go. Fast forwarding their scenes from now on. Especially once they add in Lysa to that craptacular threesome.
Â 
Jon talked about Bran! He only has 3 siblings left to remember now.Â  And GHOST.
Bran was very enjoyable, might be the first time I've liked the Reeds.
Â 
Tommen is a million kinds of awesome. Ser Pounce! Margaery, seriously girl close your legs. He's a child.
Â 
'Your grace' and 'Lord Commander' - ouch.
Â 
Brienne and Jaime were fantastic as always. So in the first episode, Arya was more than likely dead, now she's probably dead Jaime? Are you going for an each way bet.
Â 
Jaime and Tyrion were fantastic too. I know this may be a totally wrong thing to say but Peter Dinklage looked so cute when he was standing up.
Â 
Whitewalkers are creepy.
Locke at the wall - oh oh.
Â 
Pretty good ep all up considering no Arya or Tywin.
Â 
Next ep - Arya training yay - although I think the Hound is gonna annoy me again.
1057	boojam	2014-04-28	Looking back at episode 2, Roose didn't even order Locke to KB.Was there a line of dialog like that?Locke asked where he might look for the Stark boys, and Theon speculated.So Prest-O Change-O there is Locke at CB!I guess they wanted to get some more Noah Taylor , he has that same creepy 'Batman' whisper-voice, which is getting on my never.Maybe that Noah Taylor normal speaking voice?I checked, he does have a bit high pitched voice, and another of those mysterious UK accents, but he does sound 'wispy' on the videos I have seen.

I think we'll never know. Rewatching that episode shows that it was ridiculously difficult for Olenna to do it (even though we know it was her now) when the poison had to go in the cup (during the pie-cutting). I think the director said something like, you won't be able to actually see the poisoning take place, but based on framing and reactions, you should be able to figure it out.
1060	boojam	2014-04-28	Next ep - Arya training yay - although I think the Hound is gonna annoy me again.They already moved Arya 13 to episode 1, and RW stuff was last year.(Well part of Arya 13.)If she does not get to Saltpans until E10... then it was all travelogue and a village stay.I suppose they could run into the mountain clans, missing since S1.Almost halfway done, wonder how much shooting time Maisie had last year?

That is not right, because that was an intentional act so someone had to put it in there, and not knowing who was intentionally in on it with QoT is not right. Â I don't like it.

1066	Justin Danford	2014-04-28	It's strange how so many follow along with the idea that, "Well that storyline is boring/dumb in the books, so it's good the TV show changed it." Really?
Â 
Adaptions can not and should not ever try to be the visual copies of their literary counterparts, but there are still some things it should try and keep right. Namely not introducing plot that conflicts with canon.
Â 
Ommitting for the screen/time is one thing.
Adapting for the screen/time is one thing.
Â 
Adding to streamline or clear up something for the screen/time is another thing...but can be justified
Â 
But Rewriting is something else entirely.
Â 
There is too much rewriting going on in this series.
Â 
I have no problem with Arya servinig wine to Tywin, fleshes out both characters, gives an excuse for backstory, streamlines a rather intricate story plot. I get that. It's an addition that wasn't in the books, but it aids the show. Cool, it's very interesting. What they are doing in the North, however, is not just adapting, ommitting, or adding; it's taking material written in the book, setting it aside, and writing radically different and sometimes contradictory scenes. Why does Jon have to know about Bran? Why do the mutineers have ghost? Why does Bran get captured by the mutineers? These are conflicts contrived from thin air to rewrite perfeclty fine plot. They don't adapt book material, add context to a winding plot, simplify story-lines for the screen, or even embelish to spice things up.
Â 
They are just changes. They can be delightful to watch and look at (which I can respect) but at this point the writers aren't adapting anymore. They're writing fan-fiction.
Â 
"What if the mutineers were left at Crasters, and Bran stumbled upon them and was captured, but Jon was leading a raiding party to kill the mutineers anyway." That is an interesting "what if." It might make for some interesting implications. But it's Fanfiction.
Â 
There is no source material that justifies these changes. No precedent, no suggestion. They are just changes.
Â 
Â 
If that is the level of divergence the showrunners are going to take, I guess that is fine, but it is no longer an adaption. The "crime" then is that this TV'd version of the Ice and Fire universe masquerades as an adaption, freely excercises it's ability to re-write, all while toppling over yet unreleased information.
Â 
It's as if they're using the fact that AOIAF exists as a yet unfinished work to justify co-creating within that world. That is a dangerous thing for an adaption to do, try to do, or flirt with doing.
Â 
"I am not saying here that the people who write fan fiction are evil or immoral or untrustworthy. The vast majority of them are honest and sincere and passionate about whatever work they chose to base their fictions on, and have only the best of intentions for the original author. But (1) there are always a few, in any group, who are perhaps less wonderful, and (2) this door, once opened, can be very difficult to close again." - George R.R. Martin
Â 
I know many people here won't agree with me and say I'm being too dramatic and nitpicky. Maybe I am. But I'm legitmatley concerned the door's been flung wide open.
1067	johndance	2014-04-28	They are rape obsessed and the women just take it with no complaints.
I'm seriously side eyeing these writers.

I totally get people not being comfortable with the rape scenes. It's not something that needs to be shown in excess for sure.  In the scenes we 'be seen though, I just don't get why people are so angry about them and spout how unnecessary they are. 
So you have a group from the nights watch that has just mutinied(sp?). The NW is made up of a lot of criminals. Thieves, RAPISTS, murderers, etc. Pretty terrible humans. They take the black, don't see women again for a very, very long time. They revolt and kill their 'leaders' at Crasters. Now they have a house to themselves full of women. How would you expect this group of rapists, thieves, murderers to act????? 
Obviously, we know that they're going to do. Rape obsessed is a bit much. They are just thinking logically here. How would think group act in this spot? Well they would probably be doing exactly what we saw. It's pretty logical to include it here.
1068	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-28	Rapists raping? Seems too far fetched.
1069	CrypticWeirwood	2014-04-28	And please no Grey Worm/Missandei love connection. Just no.


Â 
Even the Unsullied are deserving of love! Â Er, puppies notwithstanding.
1070	Cersei the Great	2014-04-28	My thoughts on the episode...
Â 
I liked that they made it clear who was responsible for poisoning Joff although I didn't expect it quite so soon. Â My unsullied DH had previously thought Oberyn had something to do with it. Â After the show I replayed the scene with QoT playing with Sansa's necklace and showed him where the stone was missing. Â 
Â 
I did enjoy most of the episode. Â I was (as a lot of people) thrown for a loop there toward the end. Â I kept telling DH 'I don't know what is going on, this didn't happen in the book.' Â lol. Â It bothered me at first but I don't guess it really matters since Bran & Co. will be back on track eventually. Â 
Â 
The end was so creepy. Â I wasn't expecting that at all. Â Definitely a rewatch. Â 
Â 
Overall I thought it was a great episode and didn't mind being thrown for a loop. Â I didn't start reading the books until after the RW was shown so I was unsullied while watching that and the shock from that episode was tremendous. Â O.oÂ
1071	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-28	Rapists raping? Seems too far fetched.


Â 
I'm really annoyed with this constant response to the valid criticism that the show seems to use rape scenes for sensation. Â No one here has said " those NW men woldn't rape" Â They just are annoyed with having to see it on the screen. Â We saw a guy drinking from Mormont's school while a bruised and battered woman sat next to him. Â Was anyone at all confused by what these guys were doing? What that ten seconds of "rape them til they're dead" and boobs flapping necessary to the plot? Â Also, apparently men being raped is something that occurs in this world but for some reason we only see it threatened...wonder why?
Â 
People can legitimately be annoyed by the fact that with other things that are cut there always seems to be enough time for the rape scenes so maybe for once one of you guys can stop acting like these people are too stupid to understand the world and give a cognizant argument why that scene added something we didn't already know and understand about the show for once?
1072	Lany Cassandra	2014-04-28	So what is everyone's thoughts on the scene where Margaery raped Tommen? He's about 12 years old for christ sake.Â

What that ten seconds of "rape them til they're dead" and boobs flapping necessary to the plot? Â Also, apparently men being raped is something that occurs in this world but for some reason we only see it threatened...wonder why?
Â 
People can legitimately be annoyed by the fact that with other things that are cut there always seems to be enough time for the rape scenes so maybe for once one of you guys can stop acting like these people are too stupid to understand the world and give a cognizant argument why that scene added something we didn't already know and understand about the show for once?


Â 
it added nothing but the innevitable eye-roll of my girlfriend toward me when I have her watch the episode and the awkward explanation I'll have to give if someone else walks in on it out of context
Â 
I agree with you. It was clearly implied what was happening, there was no need to see it, and then, there was no reason to see it as clearly and as long as we saw it.
1074	CrypticWeirwood	2014-04-28	Was that the Great Other? I never envisioned him as a physical being, more a powerful entity like R'hllor...


Â 
You mean the gentleman with the horns? The horns were the giveaway. Â He was that poorly misunderstood grey character previously incarnated (well, in-warg-ated) in Coldhandsâ<U+0080><U+0099> hornA¨d horse. Â You know, the one in the books that Bran and Sumer and Hodor and the Reed children ate. Â They all probably got Great Cooties that way, but Bloodraven was taking no chances so gave Bran an extra helping later.
Â 
This glimpse into the Heart of Winter was done by HBO to show that unlike lesser shows, here there really is no polarized conflict of good and evil going on, just a misunderstood family man up at Ice Henge who wants nothing more than to adopt orphaned waifs so they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t freeze to death or grow up to have green or brown eyes.
Â 
This is more obvious in the books, where the True Starks have grey eyes, which tells you a lot about them. Â Because the actors had so much trouble with contact lenses, and also because TV is a much blunter communications medium, show watchers got to learn about this northern greyness more directly and sooner than book readers.
Â 
It also ties in nicely with the dragons having horns, because it shows that Ice and Fire are just two sides of the same coin after all.
1075	joaozinm	2014-04-28	Jon knowing about Bran, missandei and grey worm love. Imagine this... Jon will free bran talk to him and let his little brother walk north in the middle of whitewalkers. where the hell is coldhands? Â These were the scenes i didnt like
1076	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-28	Please tell me: if you found a direwolf (or a very large wolf, for that matter), chained, would your first idea be: "Now, how do I kill this thing?"?.
Â 
I think not.

Um, if I were out in the middle of the wilderness running out of food, I think my first thought would actually be how to kill it and eat it. I've never had wolf myself, but I figure meat is meat in that situation.Â 
Because finding a way to cage it safely, waste food feeding it, and hoping it doesn't break free and tear out all their throats makes more sense?

Seriously, it bothers me more than anything in the entire episode. It makes no fucking sense.
1077	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-04-28	I'm not sure if this has been discussed yet, I'm assuming so as it was so abhorrent... But I cant be bothered going through 36 threads to find out...
Â 
But I (also) have to express how disgusted I was at the latter half of this episode. Of all the things that have occurred during this show's run, the scene at Craster's Keep has been THE most disturbing... The sounds of the poor girls that had already been raped (by their own father nonetheless) enduring such continued torture... Their poor bloody faces... The absolutely horrifying Karl, drinking from Lord Mormont's skull... Holy sh*t.Â 
All I can say is, I would rather the Bastard of Bolton finding those traitors and flaying them, than I would the Bastard of Winterfell finding them and offering them quick deaths.
I fear for Meera... I'm surprised they didn't just take her then and there.
Â 
I'm still reeling in fear. Every week I watch a new episode, I re-watch it maybe three or four times in close scrutiny. This week... I can't bring myself to re-watch the Craster's scene... It's too disturbing...
Perhaps someone can remind me of a scene equally bad Â from previous seasons that I've forgotten in light of this one to help relieve the pain!

1078	pleonasm	2014-04-28	It's strange how so many follow along with the idea that, "Well that storyline is boring/dumb in the books, so it's good the TV show changed it." Really?
Â 
Adaptions can not and should not ever try to be the visual copies of their literary counterparts, but there are still some things it should try and keep right. Namely not introducing plot that conflicts with canon.
Â 
Ommitting for the screen/time is one thing.
Adapting for the screen/time is one thing.
Â 
Adding to streamline or clear up something for the screen/time is another thing...but can be justified
Â 
But Rewriting is something else entirely.
Â 
There is too much rewriting going on in this series.
Â 
I have no problem with Arya servinig wine to Tywin, fleshes out both characters, gives an excuse for backstory, streamlines a rather intricate story plot. I get that. It's an addition that wasn't in the books, but it aids the show. Cool, it's very interesting. What they are doing in the North, however, is not just adapting, ommitting, or adding; it's taking material written in the book, setting it aside, and writing radically different and sometimes contradictory scenes. Why does Jon have to know about Bran? Why do the mutineers have ghost? Why does Bran get captured by the mutineers? These are conflicts contrived from thin air to rewrite perfeclty fine plot. They don't adapt book material, add context to a winding plot, simplify story-lines for the screen, or even embelish to spice things up.
Â 
They are just changes. They can be delightful to watch and look at (which I can respect) but at this point the writers aren't adapting anymore. They're writing fan-fiction.
Â 
"What if the mutineers were left at Crasters, and Bran stumbled upon them and was captured, but Jon was leading a raiding party to kill the mutineers anyway." That is an interesting "what if." It might make for some interesting implications. But it's Fanfiction.
Â 
There is no source material that justifies these changes. No precedent, no suggestion. They are just changes.
Â 
Â 
If that is the level of divergence the showrunners are going to take, I guess that is fine, but it is no longer an adaption. The "crime" then is that this TV'd version of the Ice and Fire universe masquerades as an adaption, freely excercises it's ability to re-write, all while toppling over yet unreleased information.
Â 
It's as if they're using the fact that AOIAF exists as a yet unfinished work to justify co-creating within that world. That is a dangerous thing for an adaption to do, try to do, or flirt with doing.
Â 
"I am not saying here that the people who write fan fiction are evil or immoral or untrustworthy. The vast majority of them are honest and sincere and passionate about whatever work they chose to base their fictions on, and have only the best of intentions for the original author. But (1) there are always a few, in any group, who are perhaps less wonderful, and (2) this door, once opened, can be very difficult to close again." - George R.R. Martin
Â 
I know many people here won't agree with me and say I'm being too dramatic and nitpicky. Maybe I am. But I'm legitmatley concerned the door's been flung wide open. a


Â 
It's not fan fiction. Sigh... Bran's ventures North are the television series equivalent of a Mereeneese Knot. Two to three seasons of hiking and sledding is just not going to work in that medium. A rewrite was necessary.Â 
Â 
You can quibble with what they come up with it. I do. I think this subplot is fraught with problems (including a lack of originality (more rapers), the trapping of Ghost in a cage, a much too long delay in Mance's advance on the wall (he's cribbing from Danny's invasion of Westeros playbook), etc...), but I don't blame them for wanting to invent something dramatically compelling to occur with their leads. Â 
Â 
Personally, I think they should have just placed Bran and company at Castle Black and let the Battle of the Wall occur in episode 6 or something. But it's a choice. All adapters of fiction make them.
Â 
This choice is just a shitty one.

I find that argument weak. I get you don't want to show kids sledding through the forest. So don't show anything.
Â 
With all the material, all the things that need to get cut, all the backstory yet to be told, surely they can but the Bran plot on the backburner and show something more meaningful/extend and better develop some scenes.
Â 
You can check in on Bran and Co. every once in a while stumbling on an abandoned or ruined Wildling village/remains. Talk about KotLT, Old Nan's stories about the KW and others. There is more than enough action to go around in the other plot lines to allow Brans to spell it with back story and world building (and that is only if you must show him on screen this regularly).
Â 
Fans know he got North, and is going North. We don't see him frequently in the books. We don't need to see him frequently in the show.
Â 
There is plently material there. More than enough to avoid, as you say, the "shitty" choices.
1083	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-28	Â

1085	smithy	2014-04-28	Looking back at episode 2, Roose didn't even order Locke to KB.
Was there a line of dialog like that?
Locke asked where he might look for the Stark boys, and Theon speculated.
So Prest-O Change-O there is Locke at CB!
Â 
Â 


He kind of did , here's the main bit of dialogue
Â 
Theon - Jon Snow's at castle black
Locke - Who the fucks Jon Snow?
Roose - Their bastard brother , he could be sheltering them , he could know where they are.
Ramsay - Even if he doesn't know he's half Stark himself , could be a threat
Â 
So it wouldn't make much sense for Locke to go charging past CB into the North without checking at CB first?

I agree. People talk about how boring Bran's story is, how they need to spice it up, add stuff. Well, the show has already taken away some of my favorite parts of Bran's chapters. The KotLT story, the Reeds' oath, and the Liddle. Leaving out the oath made the Unsullied question the Reeds' motives, when including it (what, 5 minutes of screentime?) would have cleared that up asap. The Liddle shows what kind of person Bran is, and a bit of backstory about the mountain clans. Could have been a nice callback in the future when/if the mountain clans join in overthrowing the Boltons. I would have much rather seen that than more rape.
1099	sati	2014-04-28	Loved the ep. The ending was the most shocking thing I've seen on the show, I don't know how the hell book readers are able to watch it and not have a heart attack. Loved Locke and Jon, very cool scenes and the moment the brothers rose to aid Jon was such a terrific scene.
Â 
Also the shot of Dany overlooking Meereen was just stunning.
1100	RonH54	2014-04-28	I can not remember from the books.. How did Ghost and Jon get separated?  Did he send him off when he went with the Wildlings?
1101	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-28	Pretty sure Jon doesn't even remember he has a direwolf at this point.

Â 
assuming D/D even do it... if he ends up forgiven in the books, they may just forego his fall/redemption
1103	Dany's Silver	2014-04-28	I agree with everyone who has said that Bran's arc could have been used to provide more history of Westeros with some wonderful storytelling (KotLT).Â  I'm not thrilled that Jon knows about Bran being alive, but I will see how that plays out (hopefully, with Bran & Co. escaping and not reuniting with Jon - or else what was the point of Bran not going to CB with Sam and Gilly?!).Â  I think it's best if Karl says he killed the lot of them, and Jon is once again ignorant of Bran's continued existence...Â
1104	joaozinm	2014-04-28	I'm worried about a dialogue between bran and Jon...you know... "Hey bro, i can't even walk but im going on a quest to find a thing that i saw on my dreams with 2 children and a giant dumbass across the north, the snow, the deadman walking and the others" Jon: "Sounds like a really good idea, i won't tell anyone" . Â Jon risk anything in DwD to save Arya, his plan was to send her to a reliable house, he obvious wouldnt let Bran escape into the dark thats the reason why he shouldn't know in the books.
Â 
Sam didnt thought it sounded so crazy because Coldhands would be their guide, now that he isnt even in the story...
Â 
Stannis will ask Jon to be a Stark because they're all dead but he will know Bran is still alive. Someone will (probably) find Rickon so no one must know Bran is alive too... I think its a dead end.
1105	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-04-28	Pretty sure Jon doesn't even remember he has a direwolf at this point.

IMHO, the only major change is Jon knowing about Bran being alive and Â going to craster's, in part, to look for him.Â 
And can be easily fixed if for instance, karl says to Jon that they killed his little brother to provoke him when actually Bran escaped.Â 
So, Jon like on the books, Â still would Â believe that Bran is dead. The only change is that he would believe that was Karl and not Theon the one that did it.Â 


Â but then how do they escape?Â  Hodor has just been stabbed so he probably can't move as fast, I can't see them treating Meera...nicely.Â  They may be able to escape, but will need to come up with something freaky - like Bran taking over a couple people, etc
Â 


Enough with the rape, for god's sake. They're portraying a time when rape was the norm when a woman was found alone and helpless because mostly woman are property. What did you expect? Meera saying "you can't do this because I have rights!!"? They would have laughed at her face.Â 


Â and the point that has been made is that it needs to be portrayed correctly.Â  Or, horrors, we might even be able to ASSUME that the NW folk (some of whom are rapists) are continuing their practice, but doesn't need to be shown.
Â 


1) They killed one slave master in Meereen and the city is now hers. What?
Â 


Â where do you think the blood that said "Kill the Masters" came from?
Â 


As book readers, is it time to stop watching the show? What we saw tonight, are they spoilers of what's to come or are D&D just trying to progress slow book story lines? I'm of a mind that I have to stop watching. But I don't want to. Ugh.Â 


Â if you want to stop watching, go ahead.Â  but please don't contriute to this Unsullied v. Reader BS that has been going on for 4 years.Â  questioning changes is fine if they make no sense or question how things could happen, but the two media are separate.
Â 


Now what does that mean for anyone that faces them?
Â 
Forget weapons. They just touch you and you transform? Like the "cheese touch" in the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series. Automatic cooties? Automatic freeze?Â 


Â could be just because a new born just can't resist that sort of thing, like a cold they are more susceptible.
Â 


A touch to turn the baby to a WW.Â  How did Uncat and Beric turn? Maybe these are similar.


Â breathe of fire.Â  Like Ran said, would have been interesting for them to mimic it, but no.

Wow. So they gave Jorahs bit in the sewers to Grey Worm.
Â 
Why is he still in Meereen?


Â yeah, that is my question as well...where/how do they return or get back to Jorah's story line.
1110	The Crannogman	2014-04-28	I am very upset about the end of this episode. Readers have been praised for not spoiling unsullied viewers, and now the show (apparently/maybe) spoiled us. Not cool HBO. I don't think I'll be watching anymore, and that makes me sad. Â
1111	nara	2014-04-28	He's 8 in the books, so, no... just no! 

I wholeheartedly agree with you that the idea of Tommen and Marg actually being sexual is gross, but keep in mind that his parents were fooling around at that age (when their mother's maid caught them, but it's not clear what exactly they were doing) so it's not impossible.

1114	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-28	I am very upset about the end of this episode. Readers have been praised for not spoiling unsullied viewers, and now the show (apparently/maybe) spoiled us. Not cool HBO. I don't think I'll be watching anymore, and that makes me sad. Â 


Â 
This was bound to happen eventually, as we knew GRRM takes quite a lot of time to put out the books whereas D&D can't really delay the show for an arbitrary amount of years. I came to terms with that last season and now I just view the two mediums relatively independantly and have been able to enjoy watching much more.
Â 
Also readers are almost universally hated for spoiling information and coming off as arrogant for having read before watching, so I doubt any TV viewers really care.
1115	joaozinm	2014-04-28	I' started to think that Jorah will do something stupid because he is jealous of daario like trying to kill him... and this will be the reason to discuss his betrayal at earlier days...Â

1116	Fool of a Book	2014-04-28	I agree with everyone who has said that Bran's arc could have been used to provide more history of Westeros with some wonderful storytelling (KotLT).Â  I'm not thrilled that Jon knows about Bran being alive, but I will see how that plays out (hopefully, with Bran & Co. escaping and not reuniting with Jon - or else what was the point of Bran not going to CB with Sam and Gilly?!).Â  I think it's best if Karl says he killed the lot of them, and Jon is once again ignorant of Bran's continued existence...Â 


Â 
Ideally, Bran will warg Summer and CH will show up, something like that. Â Then the mutineers can say Bran and Company were dragged off by a White Walker, with the presumption being they're dead. Â Yeah, I think Jon needs to think Bran is dead for the future of the plot. Â Why has tv Jon not asked/wondered about Rickon? Â Leads to so many issues.
Â 
Kind of puts a kink in Sam's character. Â It must have been so hard not to tell Jon in the books, but it showed how well he could keep a secret. Â Now, it just looked like he gave in and said, screw it, Imma tell.

First, Tom riddle is way too bad ass for the walkers. They would be HIS death eaters.
Secondly, when white maul was walking toward crasters baby it looked like a blurred vision of visery.

Â 
And the NK, or whoever he was, had on decent clothes, black to be specific. Â The other Walkers we've seen have been half dressed in rags.
1121	Beric Zoolander	2014-04-28	I don't feel spoiled at all by the ending. We now know perhaps another canon fact about the Others, but we don't know any of the implications here. Maybe we just have even more questions. 
Â 
Do the babies grow into....? Full grown Others? Babies are pretty useless when it comes to killing people so I am assuming they may be growing an army. That would take some time to do. This is interesting. Or perhaps this is how they procreate, and this kind of thing isn't very prevalent. Any ideas?


Â 
It's also interesting to remember they only get Males, at least from Craster.Â  This may be their only way of growing in numbers.Â  Have they been stealing babies from the wildlings all this time?Â  Are there female Others?
Â 
Episode was interesting, they strayed a lot, I don't like that Jon knows about Bran.Â  I guess the whole Craster's Keep stuff is interesting.Â  But so now Jon goes out there, then comes back fights to defend the back of the wall, fights to defend the front of the wall?Â 
Â 
I have a theory that perhaps Coldhands comes before Jon and the rest of the Nights Watch and saves Bran and the others, destroying everyone in Crasters, sending them fleeing.Â  Leaving Jon and them to happen upon an empty destroyed Craster's Keep.
1122	boojam	2014-04-28	Who's he playing? I heard he was cast for a role.Yeah I can't remember either!Just think when Natalia Tena comes back next year won't know who she is either!
1123	BlackTalon	2014-04-28	My pet theory was that Margaery was drinking the moon tea to keep her relations with Tommen secret, but I could be wrong. Â 


Â 
Not much need for moon tea when guy is eight years old ... might start worrying when he is 12 or 13 ...
Â 
Â 
Btw where was it explained in the books that the WW are ruled by the "Great Other/Night's King"? I can't remember that. Everybody in the WIC comments section seems to regard it as an established fact ...?
1124	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-28	This was how I felt too. Â I love the first 40 minutes of this episode. Â I sat confused at all the Craster's Keep stuff, then I loved the Other ending. Â I didn't hate the Craster's Keep stuff but it was so strange. Â I don't understand why they needed to have Jon know about Bran but I'll reserve judgement to see what happens. Â I think they needed to do this to put him on screen.
1125	jobmartell	2014-04-28	And the NK, or whoever he was, had on decent clothes, black to be specific. Â The other Walkers we've seen have been half dressed in rags.
If that's supposed to be the nights king, how will D&D portray that to the unsullied?   Or just let it be. We're getting into some very dangerous waters here.

1128	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-28	Wondering if this Craster's/Bran storyline will lead to the show finally acknowledging that Jon is a warg? Will Jon have a wolf dream and see Summer, Bran, and/or Hodor? That would make this weird storyline semi-worth it.
1129	johndance	2014-04-28	Â 
I'm really annoyed with this constant response to the valid criticism that the show seems to use rape scenes for sensation. Â No one here has said " those NW men woldn't rape" Â They just are annoyed with having to see it on the screen. Â We saw a guy drinking from Mormont's school while a bruised and battered woman sat next to him. Â Was anyone at all confused by what these guys were doing? What that ten seconds of "rape them til they're dead" and boobs flapping necessary to the plot? Â Also, apparently men being raped is something that occurs in this world but for some reason we only see it threatened...wonder why?
Â 
People can legitimately be annoyed by the fact that with other things that are cut there always seems to be enough time for the rape scenes so maybe for once one of you guys can stop acting like these people are too stupid to understand the world and give a cognizant argument why that scene added something we didn't already know and understand about the show for once?


Â 
I get it. Rape is not something to be discussed about lightly. People who rape women are cowards, pathetic, terrible humans. That's clear. If you want to argue that Jaime and Cersei's scene last episode was not necessary I'm fine with that. This episode though, I disagree. I felt it was fine for them to show it for impact. These are the some of the worst humans in Westeros here. Again, people who have already committed murder, rape, etc. This is HBO here. Just because we see a woman sitting by Karl with a fat lip and a bruise we are to assume she was raped? We see Cersei walking around in season 1 with bruises on her cheek so we should probably assumed she was raped also? Now, because they showed it how they did, as an audience we know these guys are f****** scum, and we are rooting for them to be agonizingly killed. I don't think they are just including it to "meet their nude quota" as so many people like to say. I hope this is the last we see of anything that even implies that a rape might be happening in the series, but I don't think they are out of line here with this episode. They wanted it to be a jarring scene for the audience, and they achieved that, Much more so than if we just saw them sitting in a circle talking.
1130	Han Snow	2014-04-28	Tommen surely had an urgent meeting with the Hand of The King after Margery left his bedroom.
Â
1131	Rockroi	2014-04-28	Its hard to say that this was the weakest episode of the season, because last week they ruined the best character in the series in 35 seconds.Â 
Â 
Anywayâ<U+0080>¦.
Â 
What I Liked:
â<U+0080><U+009C>I Want to Fight for the Side ThatÂ Doesn'tÂ Allow Babies to Die in the Snow, or Worse -Feed Them to a Fucking Freezing Zombie Army.Â  Because That Shit is Fucked Up!Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a Harbinger of Chaos, Anarchy and Ruin.Â  And it Makes For SomeÂ Fucked Up Television Viewing When You Area in a Room with Two Pregnant Woman.Â  That Shit is Fucked.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  - Jon Snow (in my mind).Â  Â So, when I watched the dumpy guy take the last of Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sons out to die in the snow, it almost made me wretch.Â Â  Watching a helpless baby be left in the snow to die- listening to it cry, watching it struggle to stay warm- was a heart-wrenching, physically uncomfortable thing for me to watch.Â  And as I was watching it â<U+0080><U+0093> with friends, two of whom are pregnant women- I was almost shivering- not from the cold â<U+0080><U+0093>but from my nerves not wanting to listen to a little baby die in the cold, alone.Â 
Â 
And that was powerful.Â  Deeply, gut-wrenchingly powerful. Â Maybe a tad unnecessary, though, but I admire the guts it took to stay on that sound of the baby crying. Â I like the push-the-envelope way of making that scene. Â 
Â 
And it made me realize that whether or not the enemies on the other side of the Wall are the Walkers, depraved wildinglings or the barbarism that comes from living without any rules, the â<U+0080><U+009C>Realms of Menâ<U+0080><U+009D> has to stand for something.Â  And a society that allows its babies to die in the snow OR that allows its men to rape OR that allows any form of slavery OR that allows rules, rights, and property to be eradicated so cavalierly (where itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the Hound last week or Cersei with Tyrion this one) if we root for ANYONE in this show it HAS TO BE the people that will stand up against that kind of lawlessness, cruelty, depravity and ruin.Â  That person can be Dany, Stannis or maybe even Tommen.Â  But Westeroes needs that person, fast. I think the show made a strong case for this world's need for those kinds of people. Â 
Â 
The Redemption: In order to read this you almost have to ignore the butcher job the show did on Jaime last week.Â  You have to ignore the fact that Jaime raped Cersei last week and just do what I did- just pretend they left the part where Cersei said â<U+0080><U+009C>yesâ<U+0080><U+009D> on the cutting room floor because the director and show runners apparently donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know what rape is.Â  Soâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dilemmas are well thought-out; his decision-making process is exceptional.Â  His sister is trying to murder his brother who may have killed his son (who Jaime is pretending is his nephew) while his father tries to be the one man to rule them all. Â The actor and the writing for Jaime have been (with one open, obvious and troubling exception) exceptional.Â  He is becoming a different man not because itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a cheap way to get the actor some face-time (though, the man owns it when heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s on-screen); it is a detailed and hard look at a man who must â<U+0080><U+009C>reinventâ<U+0080><U+009D> himself in a world where that does not happen much at all.Â  He does the right things.Â  And for the right reasons and NONE OF IT is easy. Fuck, Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s easiest decision was probably whether or not to kill Aerys.Â 
Â 
The scene with him and Tyrion was as good as a scene between two witty and intelligent men can be; Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s line that shut Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mouth (the clear sign of the character's virtue) was exquisite.Â 
Â 
And the look he shared with Brienne at the end. JEsus, they both wanted to say one thing more â<U+0080>¦. The things we do for loveâ<U+0080>¦.
Â 
A Slave Revolt (without the 600 pages of double-speak): Others have made a good observations that maybe the slave revolt that broke Mereen came to Dany too easily.Â  I can see that.Â  But you know whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worse?Â  Having to stand around reading needless chapters about something that YOU KNOW IS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY!Â  Just â<U+0080>¦ where is the chase and how do I cut to it?Â  D&D cut to the chase and gave people a good duality between â<U+0080><U+009C>freedomâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>slavery.â<U+0080><U+009D> Â People want to be free even though they may have been conditioned to or even born into slavery.Â  They may be told- day after day â<U+0080><U+0093> that their lives belong to others AND (worse) that they should be grateful for their chains.Â  And that has been true for the United States circa 1858 to Sparta 444BC.Â  Slave-owners have made an art-form of declaring that THEIR slaves not only SHOULD be slaves, but WANT To be slaves (there are a host of bullshit stories from Sparta to South Carolina that describe this condition; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a load).Â  But given the choice?Â 
Â 
Better to live a DAY free than a lifetime in chains. Â Even if that one day was at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keepâ<U+0080>¦. A baby born who becomes a White Walker?Â  How much better is that than being a slave your whole life?Â 
Â 
And what of the woman who freed them?Â  The show kept the nailed-slave masters and showed how BRUTAL she can be and how she REFUSES to step-outside her own cycle of cruelty.Â  This is while Barristan looks on and wonders (to himself, wisely) â<U+0080><U+009C>Is she just or Mad?Â  Or both?â<U+0080><U+009D>Â Â Â  And all the while, Dany is putting more and more people on her back., leading them toâ<U+0080>¦ what?Â  Salvation?Â  Freedom? Westeroes? To me, those few scenes encapsulated the fight for Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s soul: she is bringing freedom to people and, in doing so, may be chaining herself to their misery. Dany is the only character we look at and must think â<U+0080><U+009C>Areâ<U+0080>¦ are we watching the birth of a villain?â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  And in this world, can we tell the difference anymore?
Â 
The Future Killer: Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s education is off to a perfect start and I like how the show unveiled not only her understanding but that the show didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t beat around the bush to reveal who killed Joff.Â  Regardless, Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one line about Sansa (â<U+0080><U+009C>Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not a killerâ<U+0080>¦ not yet anywayâ<U+0080>¦.â<U+0080><U+009D>) was the perfect blend of honesty and foreshadowing.Â 
Â 
The King and the Queen (Third Timeâ<U+0080><U+0099>sÂ  a Charm): Good scene, utterly unrealistic, but I can live with it.Â  Showed that Maergery can play the game a number of different ways.Â  Well done.Â  And I was SO GRATEFUL they did not have sex because that would have spawned a â<U+0080><U+009C>point/counter-pointâ<U+0080><U+009D> on this weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rape scene v. last weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rape scene.Â 
Â 
Jon Snow, Now With a Pulse: I liked that Jon in the show has more life and more complexity than the emmo-fuck in the books.Â  I think his speech to his brothers was legit AND it sets up his promotion nicely. And I really like that he knows about Bran. Â MUCH better than the alternative (which was in the book and makes no sense, not even a little). Â 
Â 
What I am on the Fence About:
Â 
The Atlanta of the World Beyond the Wall: The city of Atlanta, Georgia is a gigantic airline hub; almost every flight that crosses into that area stops in Atlanta.Â  There is a saying among people in the South, â<U+0080><U+009C>When you die you may be going to heaven or you may be going to Hell, but you will sure have to stop to change flights in Atlanta.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â 
Â 
Soâ<U+0080>¦ does EVERYONE is the great, vast Arctic hell that is the Land Beyond the Wall HAVE To stop at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep?Â  Letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seeâ<U+0080>¦ Jon Snow, Bran, the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, the White Walkers (who use it as the worst take-out joint in Westeroes), etc â<U+0080><U+0093> they all stop into this placeâ<U+0080>¦ in a world that has been described as so vast you cannot keep track of anything.Â  But now we have â<U+0080>¦ everyone â<U+0080>¦ hereâ<U+0080>¦ Jojen, Rast, Ghostâ<U+0080>¦ the gang is all hereâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
And why are the Black-Brother Mutineers keeping Ghost?Â  Who the fuck knows OTHER THAN as a convenient plot devise. Which has me concerned...Â 
Â 
Now, the question is will this be a useful plot point OR a shameless plot devise?Â  Martin has said- repeatedly â<U+0080><U+0093>that the hardest character for him to write was Bran and this is true in the books where Bran does very very little.Â  The shoe cannot keep paying these actors to walk around for 10 episodes and have all of 3 scenes.Â  They have to DO something.Â  And â<U+0080>¦ now they are.
Â 
And it looks so painfully contrived.Â  So utterly contrived to get the actors in the show to do something.Â  Its taken 4 episodes to doâ<U+0080>¦ that and it â<U+0080>¦. Looks terrible.Â  The only thing holding it together are Bran and the Reeds.Â  The actors are NAILING IT and thank God for that because the story looks terrible.Â 
Â 
I know that I will be accused of being a â<U+0080><U+009C>book puristâ<U+0080><U+009D> but if you are going to go off-scriptâ<U+0080>¦ fucking have a point; donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t do it just to do it.Â  Going off-book can pay HUGE dividends (Robert and Cersei; Tywin and Arya), but if done badly it can be ludicrously awkward (the Brotherhood Without Banners being a tight groupâ<U+0080>¦ unless a hot red woman wants to buy one of you; Shae), a waste of time (Dany in Qath) or prove to be the worst scene in the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s 3.5-year run (CerseiÂ  and Jaime in the sept)
Â 
This is feeling eerily like Roz.Â  I always felt Roz was there because you needed somebody to true together all the loose, disparate parts of the show.Â  And it always smacked of lazy writing.Â 
Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what I feel about this.Â  That Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s is just a lazy way to try to coagulate a pretty diffused story.Â  In the book, its not a problem.Â  In the show?Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a problem.Â  But this is not how to solve it.Â  They went off-book and did it in the most ham-fisted and clumsy way possible.Â  And its so obvious and so unnecessary.Â  I know D&D are â<U+0080><U+009C>geniusesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and they now, apparently, believe it.Â  They think they can do no wrong.
Â 
And that may be correct, but right now Bran at CRasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seems forced, sloppy, lazy and convoluted.Â 
Â 
Prove me wrong.Â 
Â 
Borg 2.0: So when Star Trek: tNG released their movie with the Borg (100 years ago) they used the Borg as the bad guys: a civilization based on the fact that every Borg was exactly the same as every other and there was no individuality.Â  And then in the movie they introduced â<U+0080><U+009C>The First Borgâ<U+0080><U+009D> and it looked contrived and silly and turned what made the Borg so interesting (their lack of individuality) backwards, thus destroying the villainy of them.Â 
Cut to last nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode with the introduction of the Night King and, I am getting the same feeling.Â  A lame â<U+0080><U+009C>headâ<U+0080><U+009D> of a seemingly headless enemy.Â  The King seems very human and seems to be there for one purpose: to eventually be destroyed so the White Walkers can be defeated.Â  This was probably something Martin had in mind, and I really donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have a problem with it either way.Â  But in the show And the book it always seemed a little â<U+0080>¦ pedestrian.Â  Like itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the part of the books that is a bad fantasy trope and we are all looking the other way.Â 
Â 
What I did Not Like:
Â 
Not Been Here, Not Done That: So, this episode was the most off-book to dtae and I will NOT repeat what I wrote above.Â  BUTâ<U+0080>¦ its also the weakest episode in a while and the Weakest Parts were â<U+0080>¦ the new ones (see above).Â  Where was Stannis? Tywin? Arya?Â  Are they not interesting enough for you so we â<U+0080>¦ have to learn about the shitty people who are raping and raping and fucking raping (we get it- no need to show us again in the background) these women?Â  We have to watch Bran?Â  See Ghost chained up (why again?).Â  Whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the point?Â  I mean, other than to get your moneyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worth from their contracts?Â 
Â 
Look, go off-book.Â  Its fine and at times has been done very well.Â  Even last night Meargery + Tommen was good.Â  But last night was a very uneven, all-over-the-place episode that seemed only tethered to something when it stayed on-book.Â  When it strayed it was like trying to corral kittens.Â  Even Mr. Pounce (he was great, though).Â 
Â 
I get why the show needs to go off-book. Â However, if you are going to make contrived plot decisions (Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s) and destroy the best character you had (last week with Jaime raping Cersei) â<U+0080>¦ YOUâ<U+0080><U+0099>RE DOING IT WRONG!Â 
Â 
IS this a chilling vision of things to come?Â  If soâ<U+0080>¦ we are Lost.
Â 
Get it? Â

Sam didn't "give in", because Bran going beyond the Wall was never meant to be a secret in the show, at least not from Jon.
1133	Tyrion4President	2014-04-28	Poor Hodor! Makes me sad to see such a gentle giant in pain. Those bastards!
1134	hedgeknight001	2014-04-28	So Cersei is cool with the whole rape thing?

Check your assumptions: maybe it wasn't rape after all, as some commenters were saying.
1135	The Taxman	2014-04-28	They pretty much fucked up Jon/Stannis storyline.
Â 
Stannis can never make the claim as KitN, likewise with Jon.
Â 
Where's the character development now? Jon knows Bran is alive. They should have introduced Coldhands last season... as a semi-human looking mofo.
1136	Colonel Green	2014-04-28	Check your assumptions: maybe it wasn't rape after all, as some commenters were saying.


No, it was rape.Â  The showrunners simply didn't realize that was what they were showing.
1137	hedgeknight001	2014-04-28	So wait, all new others are just sons of Craster?
+1, they're all just bastards born of incest.

Â 
Stannis never claims to be King in the North...He's just the King. He tries to offer Jon Winterfell and the Lordship, but Jon is hesistant because the seat isn't his to take and he would have to burn down the Godswood, not to mention he'd be abandoning his NW duties. In the show Stannnis will offer it, Jon will want it but ultimately not take it for the same reasons and then get voted to LC anyways. I'm not sure how this fucked up anything. It makes the decision possibly slightly easier for Jon, but he will still be tempted and ultimately decline for the right reasons.
1139	hedgeknight001	2014-04-28	lol of course this TRASH show completely ignored that jaime raped cersei last week.

+1 I see what you did there.
Perhaps the OMG-Jaime-raped-Cersei faction was completely wrong about that scene.

1140	Stannis I	2014-04-28	Â 
I think we'll never know. Rewatching that episode shows that it was ridiculously difficult for Olenna to do it (even though we know it was her now) when the poison had to go in the cup (during the pie-cutting). I think the director said something like, you won't be able to actually see the poisoning take place, but based on framing and reactions, you should be able to figure it out.


Â 
Actually, if you listen carefully when Olenna passes in front of Joffrey, right after getting the poison from Sansa, you can hear a 'clink', as if something is dropped into his chalice.
Another option is when Joffrey places his cup in front of Margaery's seatÂ when they're both standing during the pigeon pie scene. Olenna is right beside.
Or it could be in another hour, offscreen.. it really doesn't matter.
1141	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-28	No, it was rape.Â  The showrunners simply didn't realize that was what they were showing.


Â 
Maybe you didn't realize what you were watching.
Â 
Anyway the writers' word is law, and they said it wasn't rape. So it wasn't rape. Period.

Â 
The "clink" I thought was her dropping it off with Marg (that theory's out the window now), but I thought the Strangler is rather-fast action, so that's why I ruled out that moment.
Â 
You're right about the other option, but Olenna is standing at a different table, and would have had to walk a good 10 feet (in front of a guard, no less) to do it. Possible, but not particularly intelligent on her part.
Â 
I guess the show probably changed the timing for the poison to take effect, but the logistics of it irk me.
1143	The Taxman	2014-04-28	Â 
Stannis never claims to be King in the North...He's just the King. He tries to offer Jon Winterfell and the Lordship, but Jon is hesistant because the seat isn't his to take and he would have to burn down the Godswood, not to mention he'd be abandoning his NW duties. In the show Stannnis will offer it, Jon will want it but ultimately not take it for the same reasons and then get voted to LC anyways. I'm not sure how this fucked up anything. It makes the decision possibly slightly easier for Jon, but he will still be tempted and ultimately decline for the right reasons.


Â 
What do you think the battle of Ice is for? Stannis is trying to reunite the North under his rule... duh?
1144	Frey Pies	2014-04-28	Even if it was, indeed, rape, it was addressed quite well this episode, and will likely be bought up later on as well.Â 
Â 
The relationship between Jaime and Cersei was colder than it has ever been- I bet the events that occurred in the sept played a part in that.Â
1145	hedgeknight001	2014-04-28	How do you think Lady Margery got through to Tommen. Are the Kings Guard working for the Tyrells or is she using the secret passageways Varys knows about?

That's what I thought. When Tommen queried Margaery as she came in, she gave an eye-roll response, "The Kingsguard?" almost smirking as she said it. No way could she have charmed her way past, so it leads me to think she had access to one of the secret passages.
1146	Alia Atreides	2014-04-28	New here, usually I just lurk and read the other comments and after reading through everyone's interesting in some aspects opinions on last night's episode I would like to add my own as well .
Â 
At first when the hubby and I watched we were like WTF in the whole thing of Jon knowing Bran was alive already, I hold the books in a way scared and for me their changing that hurt Samwell's character at least within the books. But as is being shown for whatever reason's so far things are being changed in someway's small changes, we've not encountered Coldhand's yet nor did Sam vow not to tell Jon that Bran was alive which for me brought even more strength to Samwell in the books to hold back from Jon his brother took a real courage he could of ended his pain but took his vow to not tell more serious.Â 
Â 
I am enjoying that I now think of it in hindsight the capture of my Beloved Ghost another change I was not expecting but as I said last night we don't know what Ghost was up to when he was on the other side of the wall and Jon and him were separated, Jon could not feel him at all and he had no idea perhaps he had been captured and ripped apart the Black Brothers who betrayed them all. It would not of been something that could of in a way been told in the books or perhaps it is a foretelling of what is going to happen in WOW. That we will go back and then go forward once again in the timeframe.
Â 
I disagree to a point in this whole new Bran/Jon storyline, etc and the Boltons sending in someone to the Wall I am quite curious as to how this will now play out and where it will leave Stannis & the Lord of Light but we still have six more episodes to go to find out.
Â 
I loved Sir Pounce simply adorable to have him we need a bit of love in a series so froth with war, betrayal and death.
Â 
I think I despise Littleprick even more now as he makes my skin crawl everytime he is near Sansa as he does within the books. I am trying to take it in a way even thought I am a book purist in a lot of series to try and remember that within the books we only have POV of that particular character, and other perceive them Â and not what their true thoughts are... but I still think even if we ever get a POV of Littleprick it will still be slimy etc. Â 
Â 
I know a lot has been said of the whole raping etc, But I find the truth in this and not so much disturbing as it being the realities of war or simply being a savage animal at times.Â 
Â 
I am really curious to see if they will have any sort of a kissing scene with Margarey and Tommen even thought they aged him up he still is a baby . The actor playing him, etc.
Â 
I enjoyed the whole thing as well with the White Walkers and remember its magic so yea that is why the baby didn't die of any frostbite before he got to the altar. I think that is about it from me sorry it it is long winded.

Â 
Agreed. They have a dysfunctional, damaging relationship. None of their scenes have been out of character for either party.
Â 
Also. Pretty sure there's no one way for a rape victim to act afterwards. Especially knowing she has no recourse/it would never be acknowledged as rape by anyone around her (and apparently a fair amount of show-watchersÂ   ).
1148	rmholt	2014-04-28	If they are betrothed as she says KG would certainly let her in, wouldn't they? Although Blount gave up Tommen pretty fast when threatened in the book so that route is also in character.
Sorry, multiquote fail. This refers to Margaery getting into Tommen's room.

thats the Bolton spy, who cut Jaime's hand off
1150	KylmA¤tkA¤det	2014-04-28	Something just popped up after i re-watched the episode for the 4th time. there could be Coldhands appearance in the upcoming episode. i assumed there are 3 hints regarding Coldhands:
Locke dialogue with Jon at CBÂ about he chose the wall over losing hisÂ hand
Karl says he'll lose his rightÂ handÂ after bitchslapped Bran at Craster's
and the last scene when "Night's King" touched the baby with his right finger (chilling touch/cold hand  ) or maybe just some coincidence. what do u guys think?

Well, considering how the kingsguard let two kings,Â a hand, a high septon andÂ one of their own membersÂ die in their watch, aside the fact the Margaery just slipped right through into theÂ king's chambers, I wouldn't be surprised if Olenna just took the cup and slowly dropped the poison inside.... but, I agree with you.
1152	flyingwind66	2014-04-28	Check your assumptions: maybe it wasn't rape after all, as some commenters were saying.


Â 
That was rape, the showrunners thought it looked 'ambiguous' but intent does not always equal perception and they shot so far in the wrong direction on this one that it hit their own ballsacks.
Â 
I wonder if George intended for the Others' to be turning their kidnapped children into Others? At this point, I am starving for the next book way more than I want episode 5...Â 
Â 
I like that we finally get to see that Sansa is way more aware than she lets on
Â 
Margaery and Tommen... it's ok I guess? I don't hate it.
Â 
Why is Ghost at Crasters? When are the other Starks going to do some warging? Where is coldhands? Also, why the FUCK hasn't Stannis left for the Wall yet??

If Jon weren't in denial he'd realize he knows exactly where Bran is, in the books. So that didn't bug me too much
Stuff going on at Crasters must be a tool for the TV show to execute some book - to - TV problem. It seems horribly wrong so I'm interested to see how they work it back to the written story.

1157	briantw	2014-04-28	I have no problem with Arya servinig wine to Tywin, fleshes out both characters, gives an excuse for backstory, streamlines a rather intricate story plot. I get that. It's an addition that wasn't in the books, but it aids the show. Cool, it's very interesting. What they are doing in the North, however, is not just adapting, ommitting, or adding; it's taking material written in the book, setting it aside, and writing radically different and sometimes contradictory scenes. Why does Jon have to know about Bran? Why do the mutineers have ghost? Why does Bran get captured by the mutineers? These are conflicts contrived from thin air to rewrite perfeclty fine plot. They don't adapt book material, add context to a winding plot, simplify story-lines for the screen, or even embelish to spice things up.
They are just changes. They can be delightful to watch and look at (which I can respect) but at this point the writers aren't adapting anymore. They're writing fan-fiction.

So essentially your argument is that you're fine with changes so long as you like them, but god forbid they should change anything in a manner you disapprove of?
I really don't get why this Bran storyline is a big deal.  His story was boring as hell in the third and fifth books.  Yeah, there was some cool backstory relayed during his chapters, but other than that it's all travelogues, similar to Brienne through most of the fourth book.  All the writers are doing is putting him in a situation where he might actually be able to do something interesting for the first time since season two, and where his group is in some legitimate peril.
I also don't really get why the story with Bran in the North is any different than your comparison of Arya meeting Tywin.  Both are major departures from the source material designed to make the show more interesting to viewers.  
Further, HBO owns the television rights to Game of Thrones.  There is no such thing as fan fiction here.  This is an officially licensed adaptation.  As far as anyone is concerned, this is the official version of the television story.  It has its differences from the books, as every adaptation does, but ultimately it seems to still be pretty faithful.  Nothing they have changed appears like it will have any impact on the end game.  They're just fleshing out the middle to add some excitement in what would otherwise be a boring character arc (Bran travelling for another full season).
Further, Martin's quotes on fan fiction do not apply here, and I honestly don't see how anyone could think that they do.  He signed off on this adaptation!  He writes an episode a year, and consults with the creators and actors.  Just because you don't care for the changes (and believe me, there are changes that I don't like) doesn't mean the story on the show doesn't count.
1158	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-28	Â 
What do you think the battle of Ice is for? Stannis is trying to reunite the North under his rule... duh?


Stannis is the King (At least according to him), not the King in the North. Not sure what's so hard to understand about that. He's just rallying the north to fight for him. The Iron Throne is in the south, Kings in the North don't sit the Iron Throne.Â

Â 
The relationship between Jaime and Cersei was colder than it has ever been- I bet the events that occurred in the sept played a part in that.Â im still shocked that people are bringing this whole rape thing up still.  I think the way they showed it was how it happened.  Secondly, I think the book and the show has shown that both are cold to eachother even though up to this point they havent been in a ton of scenes together.  Cersei isnt exactly a calm kitten.  She is also pissed that he got captured and easnt around.  That is really the down fall to their relationship.  Also, it wasnt rape!
1162	Big Daddy	2014-04-28	I can live with this detour in Bran's story. God knows if they didn't do this then there wasn't much left to his story. Once he gets to that cave he's more or less done.
Â 
This could work out very nicely. Jon knows that Bran is alive, but I bet they will just narrowly miss each other and we won't get a reunion. Jon and the NW will kick ass and kill the mutineers, the direwolves will get free and kick ass, and Bran's entourage will escape in the mayhem. Bran will make it to the cave by the end of the season, so he'll be where he needs to be.

1165	Big Daddy	2014-04-28	I'm more worried about Locke taking Marsh's place. I can see the temptation in placing the Locke character at the Wall to build tension and the Jon/Ramsay rivalry. It does make sense in some ways. But it also completely changes the motivation of WHY Jon's assassination attempt happens. Could this be some of the whitewashing that we're seeing for Tyrion and Dany? That in the show Jon's actions will be less black and white so they need a more villainous person to take action against him? Not writing it off, but I'm not sold on it. Also, it means we may be looking at Locke all the way through season 5.

Can't see Locke getting out of Craster's alive, he's not going to let Bran just walk away if they actually do meet up. If Locke and the NW do miss them, I couldn't see him hanging around at the Wall on the off chance that Bran might pop up again.
1169	hedgeknight001	2014-04-28	Someone needs to get Greyworm into a workout program.Â  I'm not saying he has to be big, but the guy doesn't even have muscle tone.Â  The Unsullied slaves are specifically chosen due to their size, strength, and speed.Â  He's just a little, skinny dude.
My wife the nurse noted last year that it was silly to have "unsullied" be great warriors in the first place. Being fully castrated means no testosterone to regulate natural hormone production -- so a castrated man would lose muscle-tone and gain weight (and also develop small breasts, lose body hair, and have a higher-pitch voice). 
Basically you become a Varys, not a Grey Worm. Unless there is a steroid program (artificial testosterone) available nobody castrated is going to be lifting a sword and fighting.

I like your theory. It works better. They can have Alliser play the Marsh part. Could even have Alliser become an ally for part of next season as they seem to see eye to eye.

Why are you jumping to this conclusion in the first place? Bowen Marsh is cast on the show. Locke has no reason to want Jon dead, he just wants to find Bran. Sure, Locke could become involved if he's even around next season, but I really don't see how you jumped from Locke befriending Jon for Bran info to Locke orchestrating the assassination attempt on Jon.

1176	Laniki	2014-04-28	Book Bran meets with a Liddle on his way to the Wall. The man tells him the Bastard of Bolton is on the roads hunting â<U+0080><U+009C>wolf skins,â<U+0080><U+009D> and those that are presumed dead. Some posters to this forum presume that the Liddle's informed other clans of Bran's survival and this may be why the clans joined Stannis to recapture Winterfell and also used the Thenn/Karstark wedding to see if Bran may be at the Wall.Â Â Â 
Â 
Speculation from information gained from the books has produced the theory of a Northern Conspiracy. This theory is based on Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s squire Wex escaping the battle for Winterfell and while hiding saw the presumed dead Stark children escape. Wex later communicated this to Manderly who has systematically secretly informed other Northern Lords that the heirs of Winterfell still live.Â  This reveal may eliminate the search for Rickon and Manderlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s role as well as the clans joining Stannis.

Option 1: The Others have some way to not only suppress their own cold emanations, but to emit sufficient warmth to sustain a human infant for weeks while mosying upon a dead horse through the arctic circle.

So hollywoodized, mediocre, fantasticaly dumbed down and adjusted for mass appeal. Starting from dialogues...

I can only assume the the flagrant undertones from Slynt and Thorne that Jon was being played for a fool thoughout his hollywood speech was apparently lost on you then. I enjoyed the parallel drawn between Ned and Jeor, with Jon clearly projecting of his own emotional moral indignation for his father's treatment and projecting it onto Jeor, therefore, risking the lives of some of the precious 100 men who were desperately needed to man the walls, and whom Thorne would not have sanctioned to leave but for his own hatred at the idea of taking orders from Jon. It's not the most sensible of missions. If they run into Mance, or Mance and the Thenns reach castle back before Jon returns, they will have seriously messed up.
Â 
I loved the acting. I loved Jon's insecurity at the start, his humbleness to Thorne, his struggle to get their attention, his down to earth accent mingled with his intelligence, the sudden emotion coming through with the BITTERNESS when describing Jeor's treatment "stabbed in the back by COWARDS"- I take it you missed the lashings of dramatic irony and foreshadowing there? Because I though that was the best line of the episode. The Stark idealism was creeping in, whilst all the time, the equally persuasive Thorne and Slynt looked on sniggering into their chicken: but Â perhaps this multilayered nuance just "too Hollywood" for your tastes?
Â 
On another topic: Locke. I really hope he isn't Bowen Marsh. Now that would be dumbing things down unnecessarily. Jon's fate was hotly debated: had he betrayed the watch and broken his oath? Had he followed his heart and abandoning his duty: the culmination of a path that started the moment Quorin asked him to kill him? For great people, rules are just guidelines, but that doesn't mean breaking them is always right. If Locke is Marsh, then it will take all responsibility away from Jon and ruin his carefully crafted learning to lead arc.
Â 
I'm holding out, because I really hope we are due some new characters on the wall in season 5 after the Wall has been won. There wont be a choosing until season 5 surely? Not considering Stannis hasn't even decided to set off up north yet and we are 4 episodes in already, nor has the Craster keep plot been resolved, or the Thenn attack started. Â In the books, Marsh is not in Castle Black at this stage so there is scope for Pyke, Mallister and Marsh to be introduced with Marsh returning bitter from his fight on the bridge. They are important characters in the book and it would be crazy to cut any of them.
Â 
Another issue with Locke kicking around CB for the next 3 seasons is: what about Rickon? So he knows Bran is out of the picture north of the wall, and Jon SnowÂ is content on the wall fighting other battles. For all he knows, Rickon Stark could be with the Manderleys, or the Umbers, plotting an overthrow. Bolton charged him with finding "the boys" he will not thank Locke if he spends the next 3 seasons perched on a wall when he is supposed to be Bolton's best hunter. HBO loves "activating" their talented cast- that was what Crasters was all about. I would be upset not to see Locke go sniffing after Osha and Rickon, and see a bit of the Umbers.

1187	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-04-28	In my opinion... The Others, like Coldhands, are able to suppress their cold in order to sustain a living being.

Â 
Could someone explain to me how the hell did the little baby Craster survive? How come he didnÂ´t freeze to death? I mean, he was lying in snow, covered with one piece of cloth, and then he was riding, presumably for hours, with a creature that is the embodiment of ice.
Â 
 


Â

I think there are some references in the books about Craster possibly having some blood of the Others in him already. Don't have my Kindle ready to find the quotes though.

First off, I think Jon's Caesar moment will come at the end of next season, not three seasons from now, as there's no way the showrunners are going to spend that much time on books four and five, especially if seven seasons truly is the target.
Second, I question why Locke would linger around even two seasons in the first place.  We can already reasonably assume that he will be at the Wall for the battle in episode nine, as he could be seen in the background during Thorne's battle speech in the trailers for this season.  By that point, do we not think that he would be reasonably sure that Jon truly doesn't know where Bran and Rickon are?
And if Locke really wanted to take Jon out, couldn't he easily do it during the upcoming mission?  Or during the battle?  Why wait until he's in a position of power and has a ton of wildling allies?  I mean, obviously Locke doesn't know that's going to happen, but it seems like enough time will have passed by episode nine for him to correctly assume that Jon Snow does, in fact, know nothing and either ice him or head back to the Dreadfort.
Then again, I'm not writing the show, so who knows?
I kind of like the idea that maybe Locke decides to stay in the Watch.  It did seem like he and Jon were legitimately getting along when they interacted.  It would be kind of funny to see a character turn-around like that.

There was nothing amateur or poorly done in that scene. Just a case of people complaining for the sake of complaining.Â 
Â 
The choosing will certainly happen next season, they're too busy to squeeze it in here and we'll need Stannis to be there besides. I have a feeling Locke is not making it to next season. I don't think we'll really hear from Rickon again before meeting Manderly which will also happen next year when Stannis is trying to rally the North.

I still think the plot justifications for them to go to Craster's are weak, but this scene was pretty good, even Kit's acting was decent for a change. It was impressive visually too, the whole episode was really well shot IMO (except a few quite fake looking CGI shots of Meereen).

Â 
Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons. "And worse," the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth. "There's a cold smell to that one, there is."
Â 
Plus, in GoT, Old Nan tells Bran that there wereÂ wildlings that would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.

I agree, Bran and Jon being at Craster's could've been better if they really wanted it to happen. Kit has had a good season. Since Jon's one of my favorite characters I was beginning to worry about his ability when he gets meatier scenes but I'm pretty confident in him now.
1199	ultimo12	2014-04-28	The complete absence of consent.Â  The complaints have been documented quite exhaustively on these boards, and in many other publications.Ok, first i don't think consent is completely absent, i think it looked about a quarter-consentuai and even if it wasn't , what's the matter?
1200	raj34	2014-04-28	Â 
I'm really annoyed with this constant response to the valid criticism that the show seems to use rape scenes for sensation. Â No one here has said " those NW men woldn't rape" Â They just are annoyed with having to see it on the screen. Â We saw a guy drinking from Mormont's school while a bruised and battered woman sat next to him. Â Was anyone at all confused by what these guys were doing? What that ten seconds of "rape them til they're dead" and boobs flapping necessary to the plot? Â Also, apparently men being raped is something that occurs in this world but for some reason we only see it threatened...wonder why?
Â 
People can legitimately be annoyed by the fact that with other things that are cut there always seems to be enough time for the rape scenes so maybe for once one of you guys can stop acting like these people are too stupid to understand the world and give a cognizant argument why that scene added something we didn't already know and understand about the show for once?


Â 
Nobody is trying to stop you from being annoyed. Knock yourself out.
Â 
That said, the showrunners aren't going to invoke the doctrine of implied rape, or implied (fill in the blank) to whatever offends your tender sensibilities. Shows show stuff.
1201	briantw	2014-04-28	Would be cool, but what bothers me is that Thorne gave his nod of approval to Jon when he asked if he could take Locke with him. don' tthink he would've done that if he was not somehow in league with Locke

I saw it as more of Thorne not even remotely caring about the fate of some random recruit who has only been on the Wall for a day or two.  Thorne isn't training the men any more, so he probably didn't see that Locke was a skilled swordsman who would be valuable on the mission to avenge Mormont.
1202	gulogirl	2014-04-28	Not sure if anyone's brought this up yet - I found the appearance of the Other sort of laughable, but maybe the spikey head is meant to reference the dragons, since they are the opposing and counterbalancing forces in this series? That's a possible explanation for an otherwise poorly-chosen physiognymy.
Â 
Re: deviations between the books and the show, and the show spoiling the books, I enjoy the books and I think GRRM has created an amazing world, but I also think he's much less in control of the nuances of the story than his fans suppose. There's a lot of stuff in the books that meanders pointlessly for ages, and he's said that he has a tough time keeping track of the timelines and the details. In short, the books, especially 4 and 5, could have benefited from a strict editor to keep him focused on a tighter storyline. I feel like the show is serving that purpose, shaking out the chaff and getting to the major points that a lot of us have known are coming and have been waiting for. I don't mind that the show is doing this. It's interesting to watch how the narrative is reconstructed. And since GRRM is involved in that process, I don't feel betrayed or spoiled. But I was definitely, for the first time as a watcher of the show, sitting up and thinking, "What the heck is this?!" during the last 15 minutes. I found it an enjoyable experience to be surprised for a change.Â

That's fine, show stuff that has purpose, show something that tells us something new. I'm sorry but there are entire threads on this board complaining about characters being cut or characters aged up and at least those meet narrative purposes yet for some reason the vitrol aimed at the people who would prefer we not waste precious screen time on something that people already know happens pretty consistently in this world is pretty weird.Â

I still think the most likely reason Thorne was fine with it was because he just didn't care.  As far as he was concerned, all these guys volunteering were people who would vote against him in a choosing anyway.  Might as well let them all run off to die.

Are we forgetting in "Dragons" we have scenes in the books very similar with the Iron Men? its quite similar to what just happened last night., I honestly do not get the criticism of the topic of rape and it being shown on screen its war and its savage and it happens in the books. I'm a woman and I'm not getting any sort of sensitivity etc towards it Â in the slightest. It is in essence real life during times of war, it happened during WW I and WWII by the conquers and it happened like slavery through out history. I enjoy the realism of it to be honest and not some white wash to coddle people who can't take it.Â 
Â 
but yes people can be annoyed with it still does not change the facts of what happens in times of war.Â

1217	Dany's Silver	2014-04-28	I wholeheartedly agree with you that the idea of Tommen and Marg actually being sexual is gross, but keep in mind that his parents were fooling around at that age (when their mother's maid caught them, but it's not clear what exactly they were doing) so it's not impossible.


Â 
Ick. I'd forgotten how early Cersei and Jaime started things. Of course, they're also much closer in age than Margaery and Tommen.Â  I just want that poor kid to somehow manage to not be completely screwed up by everything around (surely someone can maintain some innocence in ASoIaF!) 
Â 
Â 
Ideally, Bran will warg Summer and CH will show up, something like that. Â Then the mutineers can say Bran and Company were dragged off by a White Walker, with the presumption being they're dead. Â Yeah, I think Jon needs to think Bran is dead for the future of the plot. Â Why has tv Jon not asked/wondered about Rickon? Â Leads to so many issues.
Â 
Kind of puts a kink in Sam's character. Â It must have been so hard not to tell Jon in the books, but it showed how well he could keep a secret. Â Now, it just looked like he gave in and said, screw it, Imma tell.


Â 
Well, in the show, we don't see Bran make Sam promise to not tell Jon.Â  I would have preferred that promise had been left in their arc, but we'll see where this goes.Â  Someone else mentioned that perhaps Jojen will key into Jon's warging abilities, and that sort of makes sense, since the first time Jojen was near Jon, Ghost was on the other side of the Wall.Â  Perhaps Jojen's green dreams intensify nearer to the Wall (the way Mel's powers do in ADWD)? Â Â 
Â 
Ser Pounce. The pussy that was promised.


 
Â 
Tommen surely had an urgent meeting with the Hand of The King after Margery left his bedroom.
Â 
 


Â 
 
thats the Bolton spy, who cut Jaime's hand off


Â 
I know.Â  I was commenting that he was showing up as a new recruit, because there was some speculation that he would simply show up at CB as an envoy of the new Warden of the North to have a look around for Bran and Rickon.

Â 
He's a wight who retained self-awareness and something close to free will, or at least a certain amount of it. He can speak! Â He can probably give information on the Others, how their magic works, what its limits and capabilities are. He might have some idea of how to enable the other wights to retain/regain self-awareness, rendering them much less dangerous to the living.Â

He's a wight who retained self-awareness and something close to free will, or at least a certain amount of it. He can speak! Â He can probably give information on the Others, how their magic works, what its limits and capabilities are. He might have some idea of how to enable the other wights to retain/regain self-awareness, rendering them much less dangerous to the living.Â 
Â 
What'sÂ not interesting about Coldhands??? Â 


Â 
This. Also, is he Benjen Startk?!Â  Enquiring minds would like an answer to that question!

~~No one should be surprised that Jon Snow is the love child of R+L. That doesn't mean the show should tell us before George does and everyone be okay with it because it was implied.


Â 
i don't agree with you that there were huge and multiple spoilers in ep 4, but i do agree with the logic behind the above
1225	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-28	Â 
That doesn't make him uninteresting. Frustrating, yes, but not dull. Â 


Â 
To clarify I find it uninteresting and unnecessary to introduce a character in a complicated story that only further complicates things. I think it was ok in the books and honestly I didn't even care about it until I found these forums, but on the show I think it's too much, especially if there are spoilers attached to it.

Â 
Â 
Saying you think that a character is better off skipped for narrative reasons is fine, but it's not the same thing as claiming that the character is uninteresting and you can't imagine why anyone else would disagree with you on that point and want to see him introduced. Â I think it's blindingly obvious why people -- including me -- wanted to see Coldhands on the show. Â His very existence opens wide the possibilities for what's really going on with the Others and the wights, particularly the question of "Are they a monstrous mindless destructive evil force like Tolkien's orc hordes, or are they simply very, very alien? Would it ever be possible to negotiate with them instead of limiting our engagement to all-out war?" Â 
Â 
He's a fascinating character, and his presence would have indicated that perhaps the showrunners were also interested in asking questions about the real nature of the Enemy in ASOIAF. Â I suspect they aren't interested in this -- the Others and wights are just BAD BAD BAD and need to be destroyed utterly, period. Â But I hope for more from GRRM in the actual books. Â Â
1228	BlueDragon	2014-04-28	Does anyone really think that the books will catch up to the show? Â I don't. Â We are going to see the ending long, long before Martin produces the next 2? books.
Â 
HBO is making a mint. Â No way they are going to pull back now. Â Those of you who are too upset by spoilers might have to reconsider watching the show.
Â 
As for me, I am glad that I have a chance to see the ending before Martin and/or I croak. Â 
Â 
One thing about dying: you don't get to see the finish to a lot of stories, fictional or real, you are invested in.
Â 
If the show deviates more and more, some of you might find solace in the idea that the books will clean everything up to your satisfaction.
Â 
As for myself, I just want to know if R+L=J, if Arya can be redeemed from assassin status and if the Starks and Dany are left standing. Â Who sits the Iron Throne is of no real concern to me. Â I doubt it will exist by the end of the story. Â 
Â 
Westeros will enter an entirely new era of some sort. Â I wouldn't venture to predict what it will look like.
Â 
And no one has commented on Jojen's obvious visions which we will find out about when he comes out of his fit. Â Something about the twist in the story has caused Jojen to open an important window into what they should do or what is coming next. Â 
Â 
Can anyone explain how Summer was trapped? Â And if he is hurt, how does he help Snow escape?

I can completely understand why someone would want it in the show, I just stated why, to me, it wasn't all that interesting. It was like taking a test without getting the results after...I find the test interesting and fun but only if there's closure in the end.
Â 
I think you're being unfair stating the showrunners don't want to ask questions about the WW's since they've already shown us more than GRRM himself has in 5 books. I suspect they'll make it quite clear that the story is basically centered about an ancient war threatening humanity and the "Good guys" are probably just humans fighting to survive. But wigths and necromancy has never been a favorable trait for a society, I don't think GRRM really makes me think "Maybe the Others are really the good guys" as long as they murder people willy nilly and resurrect dead corpses to fight against the living.
Â 
Although now that we're on the topic...One of the NW rangers turned wight clearly goes to get Jeor Mormont. I never really put too much thought into that, but there might be a lot more there than simply killing the leader of the NW for the sake of weakening the NW.

Ick. I'd forgotten how early Cersei and Jaime started things. Of course, they're also much closer in age than Margaery and Tommen.Â  I just want that poor kid to somehow manage to not be completely screwed up by everything around (surely someone can maintain some innocence in ASoIaF!) 
Â 
Â 
Well, in the show, we don't see Bran make Sam promise to not tell Jon.Â  I would have preferred that promise had been left in their arc, but we'll see where this goes.Â  Someone else mentioned that perhaps Jojen will key into Jon's warging abilities, and that sort of makes sense, since the first time Jojen was near Jon, Ghost was on the other side of the Wall.Â  Perhaps Jojen's green dreams intensify nearer to the Wall (the way Mel's powers do in ADWD)? Â Â 
Â 
 
Â 
Â 
 
Â 
I know.Â  I was commenting that he was showing up as a new recruit, because there was some speculation that he would simply show up at CB as an envoy of the new Warden of the North to have a look around for Bran and Rickon.


Â 
Â 
Is there any definite information on TV-Tommen's age? Â Not the actor's, but the character's age. Â It would be interesting to know. Â Did I miss a mention of it in the show?

Â I was looking for some good on Tarantino style revenge violence, not just one guy getting rushed in an Alley. Â You could have cut out a lot of the the Karl is the best fighter, fuck them til their dead, taunt the thirsty direwolf stuff and really start making Danys story bigger. Â I'm glad they kept the crucifiction piece and it wasn't too glossed over but I'm ready to return to a semblance of depth with Dany's story. Especially since, without being captivated by her POV, we can really explore what the siege was like and why it's going to be so hard for her to rule.
Â 
Love anything with Brienne. Enjoyed the Littlefinger-Sansa dynamic and the segue to QoT-Marg. Â Glad to see they are going to keep the war between Marg and Cersei over Tommen alive and I hope they throw a little more Tywin in to keep it interesting. Â Liked Locke being at the wall, adds a different air of animosity.

Â 
The question isn't whether or not they are "good guys", it's whether or not they have comprehensible motivations for their behavior. Â Sauron's orcs and the mindless hordes of evil in other fantasy series like "The Wheel of Time" and "The Fionavar Tapestry" are evilÂ just because. They have no understandable motivation or goals beyond "Destroy everything and be as nasty as possible to your enemies in the process! Always maximize suffering!" Â They're cartoons. Â 
Â 
The fantasy series that GRRM claims was in part an inspiration for ASOIAF, Tad Williams' "Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn", bored me to tears and I didn't finish it, but I do know that one thing Williams did that was cool was make his bad guys understandably motivated, while still not making themÂ good guys. Â I'm hoping that that's one of the things GRRM was thinking of when he said that reading Williams' series convinced him fantasy could be done for adults. Adults can -- or should be able to -- appreciate that when people do bad crap, it's not generally just for the love of being shitty to other people. Â It's for other reasons. Â Adults can understand that when a war breaks out, the other side has reasons for why they fight and why they kill that go beyond "Hey, it's something fun to do on a Saturday night." (Or, "They hate our freedoms!"...get real.) Â 
Â 
So the presence of Coldhands, to me, indicated that GRRM has something more complex in mind for the Others and the wights than Old Nan's version of "They just hate everything that's alive and warm," which is the kind of thing you tell kids like Bran but not the kind of thing that holds up under closer examination. Â 
Â 
My impression of the tack the show is taking, however, is that the Others and the wights are on the same level as the zombies in the Walking Dead: just mindless forces of destruction, nothing more complicated -- or interesting -- than that. Â Whether or not this is "unfair" I couldn't say, but D&D have shown a marked tendency toward reducing the level of gray in the source material ("Littlefinger BAAAAD! Tyrion GOOOOOD!") so it wouldn't surprise me at all to find out that on the show the Others and wights are never anything more complicated than "The Enemy That Must Be Destroyed Before They Destroy Us." Â
1234	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-28	Guyse guyse guyse!!! For the last time, the Other at the end of the episode was just an Other; the NK was just a man and that was not the NK! The viewer's guide changed it to "Walker" aka Other because, as Ran pointed out, the episode guide is not written by GRRM, D&D or possibly even anyone involved with the show.Â 


Can anyone explain how Summer was trapped? Â And if he is hurt, how does he help Snow escape?


I assume you meant "Bran" or "Ghost" where you have Snow? It looked like one of those standard pit traps where the entrance is covered by leafs or snow or something and has something along the lines of sharpened stakes at the bottom. I'm sure he's wounded but OK and when Jon and the rescue party come next episode he, along with Bran, Ghost and co. will be reunited.
Â 
The writers are obviously just making Jon and Ghost's reunion more dramatic since this is undoubtedly how they get back together. I would be surprised if the JonBran fight/reunion is any other scene next episode besides the first or last.

This was really the last time Dany does anything cool for seemingly forever and yet they accomplished it in the lamest way possible. There was no Jorah or BtB, no room now for Lord Friendzone to be fully fleshed out, not even any fighting shown period. I get that they have a limited budget but even a skirmish would have been better than the assumption that the slaves quickly take out a bunch of the great masters and the city, which apparently has absolutely no army at all, folds immediately. That was pathetic and the Mysha stuff followed by Dany at the Great Pyramid with the Targ flag was more of an epic eye roll for me than a, Wow, that was badass!

I think they will as the season moves forward we will see more of Dany trying to rule, etc. She is now at the end of her journey of conquering for now within the books themselves the rest still has to come.

According to GoT wiki, approx 12 in season 4:Â http://gameofthrones...ommen_Baratheon
Â 
They didn't say anything, but I think we're supposed to conclude he's pre-pubescent (Tywin mentioned something about "when you come of age") in 4x03.
Â 
Edit:Â 
That all being said, back in Season 1 Loras says that he's 8. And we know a couple of years have passed (LF to Sansa in 4x03). So I think the show-runners are hoping we won't notice a 2-year age jump for him.

Locke was at the Dreadfort with Ramsay and Roose in episode two, where Roose promised him lands if he is able to find and dispose of the two remaining Stark children.  Ramsay puts it out there that he might want to take care of Jon Snow as well just in case.

Huh? There's no references in the books about any human having "some blood of the Others," Craster or otherwise. Oy.

â<U+0080><U+009C>Best we be starting back, mâ<U+0080><U+0099>lord,â<U+0080><U+009D> he [Dywen] said to Bowen Marsh. â<U+0080><U+009C>Darkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s falling, and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something in the smell oâ<U+0080><U+0099> the night that I mislike.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Dywen catches the cold smell of the wights in the air.
Â 
Dywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow coming on, sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff.
Â 
Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons. â<U+0080><U+009C>And worse,â<U+0080><U+009D> the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth. â<U+0080><U+009C>Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a cold smell to that one, there is.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Craster was one of those people that I am not sure about him being 100% human. Dywen catches the cold smell in him. His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger. Old Nan told stories about wildling women laying with Others and birthing hybrid creatures. I am just saying.
Â 
Dywen was holding forth, spoon in hand. â<U+0080><U+009C>I know this wood as well as any man alive, and I tell you, I wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care to ride through it alone tonight. Canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you smell it?â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>What is it you smell, Dywen?â<U+0080><U+009D> asked Grenn.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Seems to me like it smellsâ<U+0080>¦ wellâ<U+0080>¦ cold.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Your headâ<U+0080><U+0099>s as wooden as your teeth,â<U+0080><U+009D> Hake told him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no smell to cold.â<U+0080><U+009D>
There is, thought Jon, remembering the night in the Lord Commanderâ<U+0080><U+0099>s chambers. It smells like death.
Â 
It seems Dywen was right all the time. More on Dywen here.

1251	hedgeknight001	2014-04-28	Actually, there are references about Craster, and how he brings "cold" with him wherever he goes. I'll have to wait until I get home from work to look up the exact quotes.
Â 
EDIT: I found one of the quotes in another thread on this board, from A Clash of Kings
Â Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons. "And worse," the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth. "There's a cold smell to that one, there is."
Â 
Plus, in GoT, Old Nan tells Bran that there wereÂ wildlings that would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.

Wow, that's a good catch. That makes The Others much more closely related to humankind, and not strictly "magical"/supernatural beings.

The Reeds kids are there!! Surely they must know something... c'mon D&D grow some balls and drop this bomb now please.

OMG I HOPE THEY DONT DO IT THIS SOON. I can not begin to imagine the crazy riots that would cause.
1254	Epyon	2014-04-28	Wow this thread has exploded since last night.... Not going to read through the 30 ish new pages, but something I caught on my rewatch:
Â 
Littlefinger tells Sansa that the Tyrells are his co-conspirators, but does it in a way where he seems to be testing her.
Â 
It's two statements he makes about them:
Â 
1. The obvious statement about how it greatly benefited them (the ambiguous them), and that they really wanted it done.
Â 
2. The very subtle remark at the very end of the scene where he comments that his relationship with them is.... wait for it.... "growing strong" (aka House Tyrell's words).
Â 
I thought that second line especially was an excellent touch.
1255	Lasicka	2014-04-28	Â 
Presumably the WW's have a way of preserving the baby's life. Fire consumes, ice preserves.Â 


Â 
Well I have a little problem with AemonÂ´s quote, because ice indeed preserves... after youÂ´re dead.
Â 


Â 
Option 1: The Others have some way to not only suppress their own cold emanations, but to emit sufficient warmth to sustain a human infant for weeks while mosying upon a dead horse through the arctic circle. Which, then, makes one wonder why they don't suppress their cold emanations when they're sneaking up on a MFer...
Â 
Option 2: That part was written by someone other than GRRM, and it should make us appreciate him more.


Â 
Indeed I doÂ  Â 


In my opinion... The Others, like Coldhands, are able to suppress their cold in order to sustain a living being. That's why the baby was in a seeming trance... It was looking into the others eyes... Then when it was laid down... It started crying. It was vulnerable.


Â 
I agree that the baby was in a trance while with the Other, but what about the time with Rast (he didnÂ´t exactly take it out and lay it behind the keep) and the time before the Other came - newborn in snow, practically naked. Â 
Â 


Â 
Magic. Â

OccamÂ´s razor?
1256	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	I really hope the first LS scene won't beÂ the Brienne/Pod scene.
Â 
Her firstÂ scene should be a BIG reminder of the RW and the vengeance that is to come.
Â 
You can appreciate that and root for her but if sheÂ tries to killÂ Brienne and Pod (who are both popular with the fans) then I can't see her going down well with the fans as opposed to getting some Stark revenge. Let us love her reappearance before we hate it!
Â 
They are definitely including her asÂ 'Catelyn Stark' has been mentioned allot...trying to keep her character remembered.

1258	Justin Danford	2014-04-28	So essentially your argument is that you're fine with changes so long as you like them, but god forbid they should change anything in a manner you disapprove of?
I really don't get why this Bran storyline is a big deal. His story was boring as hell in the third and fifth books. Yeah, there was some cool backstory relayed during his chapters, but other than that it's all travelogues, similar to Brienne through most of the fourth book. All the writers are doing is putting him in a situation where he might actually be able to do something interesting for the first time since season two, and where his group is in some legitimate peril.
I also don't really get why the story with Bran in the North is any different than your comparison of Arya meeting Tywin. Both are major departures from the source material designed to make the show more interesting to viewers.
Further, HBO owns the television rights to Game of Thrones. There is no such thing as fan fiction here. This is an officially licensed adaptation. As far as anyone is concerned, this is the official version of the television story. It has its differences from the books, as every adaptation does, but ultimately it seems to still be pretty faithful. Nothing they have changed appears like it will have any impact on the end game. They're just fleshing out the middle to add some excitement in what would otherwise be a boring character arc (Bran travelling for another full season).
Further, Martin's quotes on fan fiction do not apply here, and I honestly don't see how anyone could think that they do. He signed off on this adaptation! He writes an episode a year, and consults with the creators and actors. Just because you don't care for the changes (and believe me, there are changes that I don't like) doesn't mean the story on the show doesn't count.


Â 

No, I think you have confused the distinction I made between additions and rewrites. I'm reasonable, I rarely criticize Jackson with the Tolkein material, for instance, because I realize there is a lot there that needs to be bridged and clarified and tied together. However, aside from a few mistakesâ<U+0080><U+0094>which I likewise abhorâ<U+0080><U+0094>Jackson and Co. rarley rewrite the source material.
What they add usually surrounds the original plot as either shiny wrapping paper, or exposition (which can often be found in source material like appendices/ other works). Even if I don't always like it, I can see it's usefulness, purpose, or justification.This show is not follow that same mode of adaptation. They aren't just adding. Again, the Arya/Tywin is a good example of a satisfactory addition to advance/streamline/develop. Arya is where she needs to be according to the general plot of the book, Tywin is on his way to KL and happens to stop by. I get it, and the way they use the encounter to world build and transmit backstory while developing Tywins character is an excellent handling of the situation. The Arya POV plotline still exists, has been edited and added to do, but it exists along its intended path.Bran/Jon scenes in Episode 404 is not just adding to their plot. It is rewriting their plot. That is the distinction. Two characters with unique POV's of their own have had their plot lines changed because the show writers thought the change would develop interesting conflicts and scenes. That is fanfiction, whatever legal rights are held. It's just fanfiction. It is no longer the source material, an embelishment of the source material, an addition to the source material, or an omission of the source material. It is new material that even contradicts source material (jons knowledge of bran for instance). Fan fiction.
I'm not nitpicking here. Even if the changes don't break the story (and I'm not sayin they absolutley will) it is a dangerous precedent to set. It has never been this blatant in the show before. The Martin quote I posted way back on page 37 or around there is absolutely relevant. Once you open that door, it will be hard to close . . . how can it not be hard to close, you've spun the chain of events down different paths.
This is all unecessary when there is quite literally an overabundance of source material to work with. Much of which fans are clamoring to see.
1259	The Lizard King	2014-04-28	This was really the last time Dany does anything cool for seemingly forever and yet they accomplished it in the lamest way possible. There was no Jorah or BtB, no room now for Lord Friendzone to be fully fleshed out, not even any fighting shown period. I get that they have a limited budget but even a skirmish would have been better than the assumption that the slaves quickly take out a bunch of the great masters and the city, which apparently has absolutely no army at all, folds immediately. That was pathetic and the Mysha stuff followed by Dany at the Great Pyramid with the Targ flag was more of an epic eye roll for me than a, Wow, that was badass!

Â 
I disagree for now. We just don't know yet. We have to see what happens next episode. I think everyone is just jumping to conclusions on whats going to happen with jon/bran. Right now it's plot addition. It very well could become a 'plot rewrite' but it's to early to tell. To much over reaction at this point. Now, after episode 5 you could be spot on and the over reaction becomes valid, but let's not jump to these conclusions quite yet.
1265	Tyranno	2014-04-28	Can someone remind me if Thorne was so hatefull of Jon Snow in the books?Â 
Â 
In the show it seems like he hates Snow so much he'd rather do things that are not in the best interest of the Wall, just to get at Jon. He doesn't want him (arguably the best swordsman at the Wall, alongside himself and now Locke) to train recruits because he's a steward. And he'd rather see Jon get killed than keeping one of the best fighters alive. Even going to far as to trying to get Jon's raid at Crasters to fail, risking the lives of Snow and anyone who might join him (considering he'd hoped nobody, or only 1 or 2 or so would) and also risking the lives of everyone at the Wall and in the North.Â 

Hell, it seems like he would rather kill Snow than see him succeed, even if Jon's succes is for the best of the Wall. In 4x2 it seemed like genuine mistrust, now it's just blatant hate.
Â 
However, one thing that I did notice was that he did allow him to take Locke. He could have just said: "no, he's not ready to take his vows" to screw with Jon Snow.Â
1266	Epyon	2014-04-28	Â 
Basically;
Â 
Everybody thinks the 'Night's King' looks like Darth Maul's cousin.
Great Other wont be a character, since neither will R'hllor.
Â 
And by everybody I mean most people.


Warning, about to go off the rails to crackpot central station:
Â 
I'm starting to think that the "Great other" is really the "woman" White Walker that seduced the Night's King.
Â 
And along that line of thinking: She would have been the equal, but opposite companion/mate of the red religion's "Lord of Light", who represents fire and warmth.
Â 
Thus, "A Song of Ice and Fire" is -REALLY- about Her + Lord of Light, rather than necessarily about Dany + Jon (which is probably the popular theory thus far), and their respective forces war against one another. After all, two deities at each other's throats, particularly if they where former mates of some kind, is a much greater story than any small tale about mortals scurrying about for some Iron Chair.
Â 
Also, I found the castle + battlements pictured in the end of the show very interesting as well, in conjunction with this theory. If the "Queen of the -real- North" has indeed created fortifications in a land that perfectly represents her own nature, then it's possible the "Lord of Light" has also done the same in a similarly fire themed local... the prime possibility for this is, imo: Old Valaryia/The Doom of Valaryia, the only fire themed place on Planetos that people can't seem to go to. I'm now very curious if there are "Red Walkers" near it, or if the "Lord of Light" is also taking human "brides" as his "queens", much like the WW-Queen does with the Night's King.
Â 
Finally, I think there's a distinct possibility that the exclusion of Coldhands from the show, but -not- excluding Benjen early on, might be a hint that Benjen is NOT Coldhands, but possibly IS this New Night's King. The last one was allegedly a Stark too, afterall, and was killed... so him being alive there to Midas touch the baby seemed a bit... strange.
Â 
As I said, a whole lot of crackpot going on here, but interesting stuff to think about.

Actually, there are references about Craster, and how he brings "cold" with him wherever he goes. I'll have to wait until I get home from work to look up the exact quotes.
Â 
EDIT: I found one of the quotes in another thread on this board, from A Clash of Kings
Â 
Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons. "And worse," the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth. "There's a cold smell to that one, there is."
Â 
Plus, in GoT, Old Nan tells Bran that there wereÂ wildlings that would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.


Â 
I'm with that program: that Craster and probably Val have "other" blood from the Night's King.
Â 


Not sure if anyone's brought this up yet - I found the appearance of the Other sort of laughable, but maybe the spikey head is meant to reference the dragons, since they are the opposing and counterbalancing forces in this series? That's a possible explanation for an otherwise poorly-chosen physiognymy.
Â 
Re: deviations between the books and the show, and the show spoiling the books, I enjoy the books and I think GRRM has created an amazing world, but I also think he's much less in control of the nuances of the story than his fans suppose. There's a lot of stuff in the books that meanders pointlessly for ages, and he's said that he has a tough time keeping track of the timelines and the details. In short, the books, especially 4 and 5, could have benefited from a strict editor to keep him focused on a tighter storyline. I feel like the show is serving that purpose, shaking out the chaff and getting to the major points that a lot of us have known are coming and have been waiting for. I don't mind that the show is doing this. It's interesting to watch how the narrative is reconstructed. And since GRRM is involved in that process, I don't feel betrayed or spoiled. But I was definitely, for the first time as a watcher of the show, sitting up and thinking, "What the heck is this?!" during the last 15 minutes. I found it an enjoyable experience to be surprised for a change.Â 
Â 
Anyway, relatively new here, I've been reading for a while but haven't really posted anything yet. Thanks for the interesting discussions.


Â 
Welcome, and the appearance of the NK was weird. Â He's supposed to be half-human, so I don't get the horns. Â 
Â 


Â 
This. Time one-thousand.
Â 
Storm is one of the best books of the series, with nary a dull spot post red wedding. If anywhere the show doesn't need to add any fabricated story lines, its here. Cold hands would have made bran a million times more interesting. IMHO


Â 
The series needs CH, I agree... an essential character to bridge the worlds of human and Other.
Â 


Well, a golem. I think so too. His arc is over.
I suspect Benjen is in the lower levels of the crypt at Winterfell, or in a tunnel around the wall, or in an underground system that connects them.
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
There's no reason to make one character the same as another. GRRM can create characters faster than he kills them.
CH is not a wight IIRC - no blue eyes, rational, speaks, helps humans.


Â 
Golem is a great way to explain it! Â Â 
Â 
Also, I'm a huge believer in a hollow/swiss-cheesed Grrmth. Â If Benjen isn't back in the crypts, Rickon is.

I don't know if you have seen the Hobbit but that is basically all fan-fiction. LotR is really not comparable to ASOIAF as far as adaptations are concerned. The former is the size of ASoS and contains far less plot lines, characters, locations, world building that the show has to cram into an entire season. Not to mention certain characters have far less story to work with than others. Bran has what three chapters after the third book? And many of his chapters in the third book are there to provide exposition to past events. The type of stuff that doesn't work well on television. I see nothing wrong with trying to inject drama into Bran's storyline by having him interact with the Night Watch/Mutineer subplot. That is what good adaptations do. Time will tell whether they execute it well and how everything plays out going forward.Â
1269	jobmartell	2014-04-28	Frankly, I'm not going to trawl through 45 pages of discussion, so what do we think? The Night's King? The Great Other?

Nights maul and a possible excerpt from wow and/or ados.
1270	Ginevra	2014-04-28	In the show it seems like he hates Snow so much he'd rather do things that are not in the best interest of the Wall, just to get at Jon.Â 


Thorne's hatred of Snow is rather blatant in the books, and I do think he risks promotion or at least favor from Mormont in the way he mistreats Snow during training. Â Would he go so far as to kill him if given an opportunity to get away with it? Â I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be shocked by it.
Â 
From the book's wiki:

Â 
As master-at-arms responsible for training new recruits, Alliser givesÂ Jon SnowÂ the mocking nickname "Lord Snow". His disdain turns into hatred when Jon replies to one of his mockeries, provoking the hilarity of the whole common room ofÂ Castle Black.[1]Â Having absolutely no humor, Alliser takes the mockeries ofÂ Tyrion LannisterÂ poorly when Tyrion is invited to the table of the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,Â Jeor Mormont, during his visit at theÂ Wall. Alliser is, however, so delighted at Jon Snow's appointment to the stewards that Jon thinks he is behind it.
Alliser never misses an occasion to provoke the young bastard. The evening Jon learns of the imprisonment of LordÂ Eddard StarkÂ inÂ King's LandingÂ for treason, Alliser's jeers anger Jon, who tries to attack him with a knife, before being stopped and put under arrest. This mutual hostility, and the master-at-arms' old friends who are well-placed at court, lead the Lord Commander to send Alliser to the new king,Â Joffrey I, with the mission to acquire reinforcements for the Night's Watch.
1271	Stark4life	2014-04-28	It has been revealed in the books what happens to Craster's sons. It's the Sam chapter in ASOS where Mormont is killed. It's the last paragraph in the chapter. I just read it on my reread.

Â 
That's actually a pretty interesting take on the whole thing.
1273	acejack	2014-04-28	Thought I read the Night's King from thousands of years ago was killed when the KITN and the KBTW took back the Nightfort. If what was written in the (now redacted) synopsis was true, either he was resurrected as an Other or maybe this is supposed to be his offspring/descendant and now "Night's King" is a title rather than a name.
Â 
My first thought after I watched was that it was the Great Other, but I tend to agree with what some others have said that the GO is more of a non-corporeal entity like R'hllor and the Darth Maul looking guy was simply King Other or even the ice equivalent of a Red Priest.
1274	7th-key	2014-04-28	So Craster's incest babies have been a key to WW for how many years now?.
I think we were all wrong, it's not the Stark warg powered kids who will defeat tthe WW, but Tommen and Myrcella!
1275	King Walder	2014-04-28	Bit of supposition. Could it be that the Other we saw at the end was a female Other, and this is how the Others reproduce? Maybe its females that run the society and the males do all the fighting and bringing of babies.
I am interested with whats going to happen with Locke, he's a good character and i almost want to like him until I remember that he's a pretty evil guy. And I'm assuming the reason he agreed to go to the keep is because he overheard Sam and Jon talking about Bran possibly being there. I can either see him dying during this story arc or taking on a role similar to Marsh and being the betrayer later on.
I liked the scene with littlefinger as well as the following one, and it was a good way to reveal who killed Joffrey,  though I feel that bit of exposition should have maybe come a bit later, like around the time of Tyrions trial.
Last, could this thing of the Others be a way of D&D telling GRRM that they're already using material from TWOW, and that if he wants to stay ahead he'll need to hurry up?
1276	Lord Carson	2014-04-28	What are people's thoughts on that lingering shot of Pyp not standing, even when Edd did? Does anybody think this will be important later? I thought it was really interesting that he stayed down and they actually showed him looking conflicted about it.

Â Could it be that the Other we saw at the end was a female Other, and this is how the Others reproduce?Â 

Nah thats a bloke.Â 
And i dont think its reproduction as much as a specific ceremony of turning children into Other-type creatures. Im not sure. But i do know that was not a lady Other.

It could just be that he's a steward and not a ranger, so has other commitments, but the fact it lingered does make you think

I guess the big question is whether it's the  only Other who can do that or if more than one has that ability.
1280	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-28	Can someone remind me if Thorne was so hatefull of Jon Snow in the books?Â 
Â 
In the show it seems like he hates Snow so much he'd rather do things that are not in the best interest of the Wall, just to get at Jon. He doesn't want him (arguably the best swordsman at the Wall, alongside himself and now Locke) to train recruits because he's a steward. And he'd rather see Jon get killed than keeping one of the best fighters alive. Even going to far as to trying to get Jon's raid at Crasters to fail, risking the lives of Snow and anyone who might join him (considering he'd hoped nobody, or only 1 or 2 or so would) and also risking the lives of everyone at the Wall and in the North.Â 
Hell, it seems like he would rather kill Snow than see him succeed, even if Jon's succes is for the best of the Wall. In 4x2 it seemed like genuine mistrust, now it's just blatant hate.
Â 
However, one thing that I did notice was that he did allow him to take Locke. He could have just said: "no, he's not ready to take his vows" to screw with Jon Snow.Â 


Â 
Anyone who volunteers to go with Jon is, in Thorne's eyes, someone who will vote for Jon when this crisis is over and it's time to elect a proper Lord Commander.Â  (Thorne is, obviously, assuming they will survive Mance's attack and he might even think Jon is overselling how big it is.Â  He definitely didn't accept that the tribes were as unified as Jon claimed during his court-martial.)Â  The more of them that go on this mission and hopefully don't come back, the fewer votes Jon has come election time even if Jon himself survives.
Â 
Thorne lets Locke go because he is already listening to Janos Slynt's advice.
Â 
What's funny is that Slynt obviously recognizes Jon Snow as the likely winner of the future LC Election (hence the advice he gives Thorne, and the warning "do you want to end up taking orders from him for the rest of your life?").Â  Given the way Slynt is, why isn't he trying to suck up to Jon and get on what he seems to think is the winning side?
1281	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-28	I'm surprised - yet glad - that I'm not the only one who actually kind of likes Locke. I guess he's worked his psychopathic charms into unprepared viewers. Well done indeed.
1282	Snoggs	2014-04-28	I agree with everyone who has said that Bran's arc could have been used to provide more history of Westeros with some wonderful storytelling (KotLT).Â  I'm not thrilled that Jon knows about Bran being alive, but I will see how that plays out (hopefully, with Bran & Co. escaping and not reuniting with Jon - or else what was the point of Bran not going to CB with Sam and Gilly?!).Â  I think it's best if Karl says he killed the lot of them, and Jon is once again ignorant of Bran's continued existence...Â 


I am honestly not sure what would be worse, a great reunion or another ships that passed in the night scenario. The mind boggles.
1283	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-28	Regardless, I did thoroughly enjoy the first true glimpses of Janos Slynt:Â Â  Ambitious Shit-Stirrer, and look forward to more of him weaseling his way as high up as he can go.
1284	Snoggs	2014-04-28	Totally agree...
This is all unecessary when there is quite literally an overabundance of source material to work with. Much of which fans are clamoring to see.

Smart move by him really, he recognises that Thorne himself isn't liked so he convicnes Thorne that Jon might be giving him orders soon. He manipulates him into sending the popular candidate away on a dangerous mission with a group of guys loyal to him.
Â 
All he has to do is hope Jon and a few of his guys get killed and then he would be the compromise candidate because the rest hate Thorne.

What's weird to me is that by asking him to get volunteers they put him into a leadership position. If they had just ordered it, and sent some other people, the men looking to Jon as a leader wouldn't have happened. I actually thought it was a big mistake for their side.Â 
Yeah he could die but if he comes back triumphant and the men already follow him? Very bad.

Jon's stock is pretty high anyway, having lived with the wildings, climbed the Wall but still staying loyal to the Watch and returning vital info to them. He would probably be elected even as it stands so they've nothing to lose by sending him out but everything to gain.

He might just have enough foresight to realize his role in Eddard's death would forever be a wedge between the two of them.Â
1289	Robbie Hood	2014-04-28	Locke seems to me like an opportunistic and likeable fellow, I see him much like an educated Bronn. He's switched sides once already right? I'd like to see him become an ally to Jon, unfortunately this seems unlikely as there's no motive or gain.

I'm not convinced they had nothing to lose because Jon would automatically win. Most of the men in the hall didn't stand up to go with him, and of course book reader me knows there are a bunch of men in the Watch who know nothing of Jon Snow.
They've given him the chance to demonstrate his competency in a leadership position. Coming back to warn of the wildlings, isn't command, it was what a good scout would do. He might be well liked, but I think plenty of the men would still consider him far too young to replace Jeor Mormont.
I think the show is bungling the politics because they need to have their main characters do something.

I'm with that program: that Craster and probably Val have "other" blood from the Night's King.
Â 
Â 
Welcome, and the appearance of the NK was weird. Â He's supposed to be half-human, so I don't get the horns. Â 
Â 
Â 
The series needs CH, I agree... an essential character to bridge the worlds of human and Other.
Â 
Â 
Golem is a great way to explain it! Â Â 
Â 
Also, I'm a huge believer in a hollow/swiss-cheesed Grrmth. Â If Benjen isn't back in the crypts, Rickon is.


Â 
Always wondered if Planetos wasn't something like a dodecahedron, with the Wall acting as a demarkation line for one of the 'edges' of the planet. Each plane and edge of the planet having its own characteristics and whatnot(ie Valyria, Qarth), with underground tunnels that offer quicker routes from say, Winterfell to the Land of Always Winter.
1295	Colonel Green	2014-04-28	Well that will be sad. I love Sam actually having an active role and training the ravens.


Since the show has Sam back for the battle, there's plenty of room to give him other stuff to do.Â  He could also, for instance, make a speech proposing Jon for lord commander.
1296	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-28	Â 
He might just have enough foresight to realize his role in Eddard's death would forever be a wedge between the two of them.Â 


Â 
But does Jon know it yet?Â  And how would Jon find out about it unless Slynt admitted it?Â  Tyrion sent him up there for babykillin, not for contributing to Ned's demise.Â  And Sansa isn't getting any ravens off to Jon anytime soon.
Â 
Obviously, looking at it from a meta standpoint the Locke character already has the "Jon's Fake Friend (that we know the truth about)" angle covered.Â  But Slynt seems like the sort of dude who would at least try a fake-ass "sorry I was against you in that tribunal, no hard feelings eh? Yeah, maybe I can help you out, I'm a useful friend to have" after seeing Jon's potential political power.Â  Not that I'd see it working
Â 
Now of course in the books Jon DOES know, because he thinks about it before cutting Slynt's head off, but I can't remember how he finds out. I always assumed Slynt talked shit to Jon about it when he and Thorne are trying to find a way to get rid of Jon.Â  Or bragged about it to Thorne where Jon could hear once he figured out how much Thorne enjoyed that whole episode.
Â 
I guess that's it, then, Slynt recognizes he's picked one side and closed off the other.Â  I guess I just want to see Slynt try to slimeball his way into Jon's good graces and for Jon to tell him to GTFO.

Yeah, I have no doubt Slynt bragged about his role in capturing the "traitor" Ned Stark.Â  Just like he brags about his time as Commander of the Gold Cloaks and the fact he was Lord of Harrenhall, though he never stepped foot in it.Â 
Â 
Really, Janos Slynt is probably not that bright, which made him useful to Littlefinger.Â  Why does the corruption in King's Landing always seem to go back to Littlefinger?
1299	Killer B	2014-04-29	Â 
I'm really annoyed with this constant response to the valid criticism that the show seems to use rape scenes for sensation. Â No one here has said " those NW men woldn't rape" Â They just are annoyed with having to see it on the screen. Â We saw a guy drinking from Mormont's school while a bruised and battered woman sat next to him. Â Was anyone at all confused by what these guys were doing? What that ten seconds of "rape them til they're dead" and boobs flapping necessary to the plot? Â Also, apparently men being raped is something that occurs in this world but for some reason we only see it threatened...wonder why?
Â 
People can legitimately be annoyed by the fact that with other things that are cut there always seems to be enough time for the rape scenes so maybe for once one of you guys can stop acting like these people are too stupid to understand the world and give a cognizant argument why that scene added something we didn't already know and understand about the show for once?



I hate to bring this up again, but I couldn't agree more with your statement.
I know the show has addressed rape before in the context of war, Dothraki vs the Lhazareen for example. It didn't feel the need to declare they were going to rape them until they died and have naked and battered women actively being raped as part of the scenery.
Â 
This isn't rape for story purposes, character development, or even establishing the type of setting the characters exist in. It seems like a way to get the right number of boobs on the screen per episode. Additionally the stuff at Craster's came in the wake of an episode where the show decided to once again turn consensual sex into non in an incredibly offensive and stupid way. Now they claim, apparently, that they didn't realize it was a rape scene? I don't think people would be near so upset this week if last week's episode hadn't been so bad.
And if the writers are adding this nonsense in, and sacrificing actual story with Coldhands or Strong Belwas, it is not only distasteful but bad storytelling.

Â 
He is more hateful and far more cunning in the books. He is the mastermind behind Slynt and Bowen. Slynt was dumb as a stump and I don't like it how the TV show changed his character into an intelligent man, seemingly counselling Thorne.
1301	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-29	Yeah, I have no doubt Slynt bragged about his role in capturing the "traitor" Ned Stark.Â  Just like he brags about his time as Commander of the Gold Cloaks and the fact he was Lord of Harrenhall, though he never stepped foot in it.In Storm, when Jon is judged, he says that Ned died as a traitor. Before Jon attacks Thorne. I think Jon figured out.
1302	Mithras	2014-04-29	There is nothing interesting about Coldhands. He is just a meatsuit Bloodraven uses.


Â 


Well, a golem. I think so too. His arc is over.


Â 
And here is why I think CH is only a golem:
Â 



The problem with Coldhands is that he does not seem to have a unique sentence of his own. Read all his words as Bloodraven's words and things will not change a bit. In fact, it is much more sensible that way for me.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Who sent you? Who is this three-eyed crow?â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>A friend. Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will. The last green-seer.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
"Who are you?"
"A friend," said Maynard Plumm.
Â 
I think Coldhands is just a meat suit Bloodraven uses by sorcery, just like Maynard Plumm was a glamour he used back then.



Â 
ETA:
Â 
By the way, TV show Jon showed no sign of being a warg yet. Same goes for Arya. I think if Jon meets Bran, he might open his third eye like he did in the books.

1305	Big Daddy	2014-04-29	As distasteful as the mutineer's rape scene was, it does get them over as antagonists in a major way. I want to see Jon and his crew kill them all SO bad right now. I imagine every show fan on the planet suddenly has those guys at the top of their GOT hit list.
1306	The Singer	2014-04-29	So watching this last night, everything north of the wall was WTF!?
Â 
But then I thought what if they are just showing that to bring more magic/fantasy into the show, as atm it's pretty low fantasy and I'm guessing they're going to introduce Un-Cat soon.
Â 
In the current season it would be a pretty big contrast bringing an un-dead character without reminding people of the others.
Â 
I'm hoping that scene at the very end is based in the future and that it's just a glimpse/flash forward as it wouldn't make much sense that "Coldhands" could trek that far in a few hours and the baby at the end looked a few months older than the new born left in the snow.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
The rape scene didn't bother me, I would of thought it more odd if they were all just sat round having a chat.

1307	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-04-29	OK, just finished watching the episode. As a book reader, this was the first time I've ever scratched my head, thinking WTF?!
Â 
The Land of Always Winter... leaving aside that the Others look wrong (too skeletal, and not elf-like enough for my tastes), I wonder if there's sort of a magical cloning going on with the baby, followed by speed growth. A Wight Baby is no use to anyone, and an Other Baby is no use unless it reaches full size in a hurry. Or perhaps the Others are sacrificing the baby again to some Higher Entity of their own? The latter is less likely, since it'd be too convoluted (the Others become mere proxies), and I think the blue eyed ending indicates that the baby has become one of Them.
Â 
The Other fortress had battlements... so the Others do archery as well as sword-fighting.Â 
Â 
Also, Bran's balls have dropped.
1308	Greywolf2375	2014-04-29	What's weird to me is that by asking him to get volunteers they put him into a leadership position. If they had just ordered it, and sent some other people, the men looking to Jon as a leader wouldn't have happened. I actually thought it was a big mistake for their side.Â 
Yeah he could die but if he comes back triumphant and the men already follow him? Very bad.


Â it puts him in a leadership position, but for what Thorne thinks will either be a suicide mission or a miserable failure.Â  If it's the former, he wins all around, if it's the latter he wins from the leadership perspective.
Â 
I want to see how they play it out, but the fact that they are bringing up Jon as a potential for LC when there are other leaders far in front of him still feels hamfisted.
1309	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-04-29	Pushing Jon as LC at this point is a significant improvement on the book. Book!Jon sits in his cell and mopes (not even bothering to vote), while others engineer his rise to power. TV!Jon actually has motivations and goals.
Â 
However, what we have now at the Wall is:
Â 
- Raiders to the South, who are coming North.
- Mance's army proper, which is coming South.
- The mutineers at Crasters (with Bran, et al).
Â 
Jon needs to be the one to deal with the Southern threat. Thus he cannot go North to Crasters. On the other hand, if Thorne and Slynt are around to see the Southern attack, they can't very well run with the Jon's a Wilding stitch-up. I think we're looking at more divergences down the road...
1310	briantw	2014-04-29	I'm not nitpicking here. Even if the changes don't break the story (and I'm not sayin they absolutley will) it is a dangerous precedent to set. It has never been this blatant in the show before. The Martin quote I posted way back on page 37 or around there is absolutely relevant. Once you open that door, it will be hard to close . . . how can it not be hard to close, you've spun the chain of events down different paths.

The idea that this is a dangerous precedent is laughable.  HBO owns the rights to the television adaptation of A Song of Ice & Fire.  Therefore, they (and by extension, the showrunners) are free to make any changes that they deem necessary or acceptable.  There is no precedent to speak of.  There is simply the TV version of the story and the book version.  There is no legal reason they have to be the same.
And again, the Martin quote you posted is totally irrelevant because Martin himself opened this door by signing the contract for the adaptation in the first place.  He gave the showrunners permission to take his work and alter it.  In fact, he has had numerous interviews where he talks about the realities of adaptations, and how changes are necessary for various reasons.  He himself has worked in the television industry.  
This is not fan fiction.  This is a legally sanctioned adaptation, and more importantly, it's an adaptation with no obligations to be totally faithful to the source material.
And again, that's not me saying that I agree with all the changes.  It's me saying that calling changes that you don't like fan fiction is ignorant of the realities here.  HBO owns the television rights to this story.  Therefore, the story in the television show is whatever they say it is.  You may not always agree with their changes (as I don't), but that doesn't make them fan fiction, and it doesn't set any sort of precedent.
1311	sifth	2014-04-29	Most of my friends and co workers loved the episode and never even opened one of the books. They're quite exited at the possibility of Jon and Bran meeting.
Â 
Let's face it, if you post here odds are you read the books. So a lot of people have a double standard on anything that's changed.
Â 
Let's be frank, GRRM has done very little with Bran once he reaches the other side of The Wall. He only had 3 chapters in total. I think most people complaining about the changes are pretty much complaining that D & D didn't just ignore Bran and the way George did for most of A Dance with Dragons.
Â 
You can't just ignore your main characters on a tv series for an entire season or in Bran's case it would have to be two seasons.
1312	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-29	Regarding Bran's arc, people seem to be upset that they aren't taking an opportunity to showcase the histories and lore of Westeros this season. They actually have an entire season for Bran to catch up to everyone else in Season 5 where it would make much more sense for he and Bloodraven to do a little tree investigation. There is honestly zero material for Bran between what will happen to him by S4 end and S5 end, so that seems like a likely time.Â

1314	Arry Lannister	2014-04-29	Â R+L=J isn't a crackpot theory, it's the truth. It is known.

I still deny this theory, I just think the story would be ruined if this were true. I'm just keep on believing that Ned impregnated Ashara just to show that Ned has flaws too.Â  
I imagine every show fan on the planet suddenly has those guys at the top of their GOT hit list.
Â 

Not me, I want Karl-fucking Tanner of Jean Alley to live! Don't know why people are going on with the rape in the background, it showed the atmosphere in Craster's keep, the mutineers don't have any qualms about raping. That's why there weren't any focus on the rape, to show that this is their daily routine and they're not making a big deal out of it since they've probably been doing this for weeks?months?
Raper's raping? Seems too far-fetched.
Â 

Â 
That ending man.Â  
My reaction to the ending was, "Oh, the episode is going to end with the WW taking the baby, I guess it's a good way to remind the unsullied that the WW are still a looming threat. Wait what? There's still more? Hmmm ok, more WW travelling with the baby,,..... WAIT WTF? IS THAT THE LAND OF ALWAYS WINTER? DARTH MAUL? WHITE WALKERS COME FROM BABIES?"
1315	aussie_ironborn	2014-04-29	the books are harsh regarding rape etc, so is the show. this is westoros being brought alive, if u read the books surely u can stomach the show. its not harry potter
1316	aussie_ironborn	2014-04-29	BTW, i hope d&d don't let Jon and Bran meet. That way the unsullied will know how it feels!
1317	XSarellaX	2014-04-29	I haven't read the entire discussion yet, but I thought it would be a few days until I was able to catch up, so forgive me if someone has already mentioned it... But did Jaime quote Jon? With the "they say the best swords have names"? That's exactly what he says to Arya when he gives her needle, isn't it?
I was just thinking if the writers were intentionally drawing a parallel, and if they were, what could it mean....
1318	Phil Sand	2014-04-29	on one of the HBO sites the other who turns the baby is listed as the "nights king", you can still find this information on reddit as HBO took it down not long after putting it up.

Â 
I think you're missing the point. If they had been there a few months, is there really a need to scream, "Fuck 'em till they're dead"? Why are the women being raped outside in the snow? None of this makes sense. This is a long term hostage situation, not a new development. Surely if a guy wants to rape another of them, they will wait until they're inside and not preparing food etc for them.
The scene makes it seem like they just got there in their behavior because that way there can be more naked women on screen.Â 
And again, what purpose does it serve? We already know Westeros is brutal. We know these guys are villains. Why add more rape to the mix other than to show more breasts?Â 
I feel like the next step in the chain is what is missing for the people arguing this. Rape is offensive to see portrayed for many people. Just like murder. So when a show has it, it should serve a purpose. It shouldn't just be so viewers can gawk at breasts week after week. What if the show started every week with someone randomly killing a child? Wouldn't that start to grate on your nerves and make you wonder why the hell they kept doing it?Â aussie_ironborn, on 29 Apr 2014 - 09:32 AM, said:

I'd call that a swing and a miss for reading comprehension.Â 
Seriously, why is it ok for people to get into long involved discussions about the differences or what this means etc, but somehow people who think the amount of rape has become gratuitous and unnecessary just can't handle the "realism" of Westeros.

Â 
Because they don't show rape every week and every time they do it does serve a purpose, you just dislike the purpose or you insist on pretending to be outraged to hop aboard the circlejerk of whiners and complainers. If it wasn't rape this episode it would be character assassination or some other flavor of the week thing to complain about. By the way I rewatched that episode and there's like 4 seconds of actual rape on the screen.Â 
Â 
But on the flipside, did GRRM really need to tell us about Septa's being raped, their tits being chewed off, or half the things Shagwell says? We already knew Westeros was a brutal place, so he could've spared our sensitive sensibilities and cut that stuff out, surely? Not a great argument. Just because you want to find something to complain about, it doesn't mean it has no purpose. Everything is wonderful gospel and brilliance when GRRM does it, but when D&D do it it's redundant, gratuituous, distasteful, or whatever keyword you're all using these days to parrot each other's arguments.Â

WTH JUST HAPPENED?!?!? ARE THEY EVEN TRYING TO FOLLOW THE BOOKS?? DID WE JUST SEE THE GREAT OTHER!?!??
SOMEONE PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME 
I've always seen the Great Other as a god, not a physical being.  Similar to R'hllor in that he/she may not exist at all, and we'll likely never get a confirmation one way or the other (much like in real life).  So no, I do not think that was the Great Other.  It may have been the leader of the Others, and I don't think it's ridiculous to assume that they have a leader, or a group of leaders.  They're clearly an intelligent race of creatures that likely have some sort of greater motive behind their actions other than simply wiping out humanity.
And yes, they are still trying to follow the books.  They just decided to have Bran do something interesting, since he really doesn't do much of consequence for most of books three and five and only has a couple of chapters in five at all.  It's probably safe to assume that Bran is an important character, so giving him screen time is something that the showrunners would want to do, lest we forget about him.  And if they continued to show him just being dragged around, viewers would start to grow increasingly bored like they did last season.  This is a solution to that problem.
Not that this has anything to do with your quote above, but I also don't understand the people complaining about how this is a plot hole or a huge coincidence.  The books are literally filled with ridiculous coincidences and characters improbably meeting.  Cat and Tyrion.  Tyrion and Jorah.  Arya and Sam.  Etc.  It happens constantly in the books and people rarely complain.  It's also hard to call it a plot hole until we see how it plays out next week.

1323	rmholt	2014-04-29	Context is everything. The guys at Crasters were sentenced to the Wall for (in their minds) unfair reasons or for being rapers, killers, or other brands of psychopath. They disobeyed guest right and killed their own LC. Some had been plotting an escape earlier on the Fist with a plan that included killing Brothers.  I don't know why they kept Edd and the other guy or Ghost but they aren't exactly planners. They might have kept them as a zoo, maybe a torturing or tormenting zoo. The women were an exhibit of generations of learned helplessness. Also they were terrified of whatever Craster told them was out there and that's why they gave up the boy babies. 
Cersei's rape was different. Jaime in the book had been doing nothing but trying to get home to Cersei, same as book. She was repelled by his missing hand - it symbolized he wasn't the same guy who had left, same as book. She gave into him in the book. In the show he overpowered her. Not book. Saying she was OK the next day proves it wasn't rape reveals ignorance. First, sex with Jaime wasn't a new thing. The force was. It was like a date rape or rape by a husband. Also there wasn't anything she could do about it at the time and even if she was inclined she can't even imagine using physical force for all her talk about wishing she were male. (Brienne must have awakened some disturbing thoughts in her BTW. Her excuse of being female suddenly looked a little fake). She got him in the books by sending him away. Likely that's how she'll get him now. She is getting even with him in the books for changing and that would also fit the show. Women get raped all the time and stuff it. People who say it wasn't rape - well even if she secretly wanted it, she never said Yes - and Book Jaime wouldn't have kept on without her expressed consent so the way they showed it, consensual or not in her secret thoughts, was not in character. Even of she secretly consented she fought him the whole time. Book Jaime takes No for an answer.

I heard people saying the White Walker Maul scene was from TWOW...maybe the prologue? I can't find the source that though.
Â 
And yes, they're definitely following the books. They know how it ends. They know they have to get from point A to point B. The books may be taking the meandering, scenic route, and the show may be taking the highway, but I think where the story ends will be quite similar.

There's no source.  It's just speculation.  Personally, I think it's more likely that D&D just asked Martin what the Others do with the babies they take from Craster and decided to show it.
Of course, maybe the prologue in Winds will be Benjen.  I tend to think he'll appear again at some point since people keep mentioning him.  That would be as good a place as any.

Actually the reason it is OK when Martin does it is because he has gone out of his way to actually write believable and meaningful female characters along with this entire story and world. When Martin does it, I give him the benefit of the doubt that he wants to do something important with the story or demonstrate something about the world.Â 
The show writers? Not so much. Not since they've made two consensual sex acts rape.

I agree. I really think those were just Craster's sons. Interestingly HBO had the recap saying the Night King for a while and changed it to the other. I see two options
Â 
1) That was the NK and they messed up putting it in the recap. So they immediately took it down.
2) It wasn't the NK and they messed up putting it in the recap. So they immediately took it down.Â 
I lean towards two at the moment just because we saw that there were many other WW dressed the same way. Also I want CH to be the NK.
1328	Charlie Hustle	2014-04-29	I didn't like that the WW looked like the devil.
Agree. That leaves everyone to think that they are pure evil. And there is no reason for their survival outside of killing humans.

Thank you for posting this. Â I didn't understand the complaints people had about the scene, beyond rape and sexual abuse obviously being a tough thing to watch, but I hadn't thought about it from this perspective.
Â 
I guess my mind was too busy dwelling on Karl drinking wine from the Old Bear's skull. Â
1332	Gargarax	2014-04-29	I'm only halfway through the comments and already kind of disturbed that people who had a problem with the rape scene at Craster's are getting a lot of hate. One commenter on winteriscoming.com said something like "Oh, the feminists are not gonna like that rape scene". WTF? What on earth does one have to do with the other? Â People who feel the show is too insensitive on the subject are told to go read Harry Potter and stop watching. Again, WTF? Is that what came out of the crypt scene last week? Are there no limits just because "it happened in the books"? In the books, children are raped and mutilated - should we get that onscreen as well? Had Rorge done to Arya what he said he'd do, should we have seen this in close-up?
Â 
Nobody argues that the show should not show rape or sex - but it has to serve a purpose to show it, it should be narratologically necessary. If it's not, it's showing rape for the sake of rape, which is problematic. The scene at Craster's was stylising rape in a very uncomfortable way, showing it like this served no purpose. I like that the show doesn't shy away from nudity - but it's getting to a point where it's becoming ridiculous. I sometimes feel that HBO is a teenager testing its limits â<U+0080><U+0093> which at least for people used to European TV and cinema seems infantile and pathetic - a lame attempt at provocation.

Â 
I think the flippant way in which rape was tossed in served to vilify the mutineers more, and raise the stakes for next episode. But it was so absolutely not needed. They so overdid painting these guys as "bad." I mean, seriously, drinking from Old Bear's skull? Tormenting Ghost with water? We already hated these men...they're mutineers after all.
Â 
It was disgusting and voyeuristic. Maybe they thought they needed to make everything really explicitly terrible (and "realistic" to how the mutineers behaved), but this was so overboard. I defended the show heavily on this subject last week; I was very disappointed by this moment.
1335	Laniki	2014-04-29	The whitewashing of Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character from the first season of the series is now in jeopardy of nullifying any reason that the High Sparrow would have to bring Cersei to trial.Â  In the books, the HS has knowledge of Cersei being responsible for
Â 
Conniving with Lancel to distract Robert during the boar hunt
Having Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastard children killed
Having Osney Kettleblack kill the High Septon
Conniving with Osney Kettleblack to say he was Margaeryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lover 
Conniving with Osney that after his trial he temporarily goes to the Wall to kill Jon
Â 
The accusations that Cersei is on trial for: regicide, deicide and incest.Â  Regicide and deicide are two of which the HS has witnesses for. If the series eliminates killing the High Septon, there wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be the new High Sparrow, the Faith Militant, a reason for a â<U+0080><U+009C>Walk of Shame,â<U+0080><U+009D> or a trail for Cersei.

This ^^ is the purpose is serves. We can sit here and debate all day about the Jaime/Cersei scene. That's a legitimate argument.
The one at Craster's in pretty clear cut. The mutineers are rapists, murderers, thieves, etc. and the show runners want us to HATE them. These pathetic scum who are treating these women this way, as a viewer I want to now see them get obliterated. That's why they had to put it in there. If all we saw is these guys sitting around eating with the women just sitting their quietly, there is no WAY the audience is going to reach the level of hate for these guys as intended. When the questioning of rape in the show is happening we need to separate these instances.
Â 
I think just because we saw it very distastefully done last week with Jaime/Cersei people can't separate the context anymore. Now it's just, 'There's a rape scene, showrunners are perverts who just need to hit their nude quota, terribly done'. Clearly, that's not the case in this one particular instance.Â

Â 
That's the first time I've thought of CH as the NK. I've personally always leaned towards him being Benjen Stark, but your idea is intriguing.Â  Perhaps the CotF have found a way for the NK to redeem himself for his behaviour 8,000 years ago (see the bottom of the wiki page for the timeline of the NW's Lord Commanders)?Â 
Â 


Can someone remind me why Alliser Thorne isn't training the men?


I'm pretty sure that Mormont (in the show) didn't send Thorne to KL with Flowers' moving hand in a jar, in order to provide proof of the NW's dire need to have assistance from the Iron Throne.

Â 
Thanks, glad some people agree on this. In season one, so many scenes were pretty subtle but very powerful, and they established characters and atmosphere well with simple moments.

Â 
That's the problem of the discussion. Nobody says the mutineers should be knitting socks for Craster's wives. Nobodys says we shouldn't see them as rapers. Showing the woman close-up, sweating, breasts dangling in a warm fire light and thereby eroticising the act is something else. Why were they beaten - they didn't seem to resist? Do we only see them as bad guys if the rape is graphic? I liked how Ras was trying to be more tender with his one, trying to kiss her back, stroking her, reaching out for something else than "fucking them til they're dead". Yes, they're bad guys. But are they all? Don't some of them feel that their transgression has spelled doom for them? The books are so great because they avoid black and white characterisation. This scene is one of the most blunt and pointless instances of black and white characterisation. Only the second sons' commander last season was worse. Both cases were some clear cases of pretty bad screenwriting, imo.

Also, I still maintain we didn't need much help to reach the conclusion that these are men we should hate. They're mutineers. They chained up Ed and Grenn. This was poor writing.

Yup because The Mountain, The Brave Companions, Joffrey, the Boltons and pretty much every slaver Dany meets are all grey characters.
1351	Jonathan Aviv	2014-04-29	One thing I definitely do not like are these "filler" scenes and side-storylines they have created to move the story along through the middle episodes of the season. One thing I noticed is that, it is a big deal that all of the stark children are separated, including Jon. From Eddard's death in book one the entire family except catelyn and rob and bran and rickon were seperated. Now all of the children are actually huge numbers of leagues from each other and that type of isolation is what keeps us all interested, because them coming back together, for me at least, will bring resolution to some of the story. It was Ned who said that when winter is coming, the lone wolf dies, and the pack survives. I don't like that bran and jon are going to potentially meet next episode. They should have Bran escape before Jon gets to craster's.
P.S why reveal the white walkers and what they do with the babies so soon?
1352	Gargarax	2014-04-29	So in other words you admit to your double standards. GRRM is free to wright cartoonishly evil characters , but once D&D do it, well the series is ruined, lol


Â 
Two things:
1. Martin includes a lot of depth that the show omits. Percentage-wise, the show has more of those characters and has developed a tendency to favour them. Oberyn's introduction (which I didn't mind so much) is one example. More unnecessary brothel scenes that were not in the book. What was the purpose of those?
2. Martin leaves more to the imagination than the show. There are very few direct, first-hand descriptions of sexual violence. Much is in retrospect, the worst are rumours and hearsay. Sure, TV and film are supposed to "show, don't tell" - but then, you need to reduce the things you show to what furthers the storyline. Often tough, the show adds sex and sexual violence to a scene that didn't have any in the books. Some for good reason. Many for no good reason at all.
1353	Crow'sEye	2014-04-29	Brilliant episode. Loved it.

Â 
Any more, though? The Mountain is the only one that really comes to mind. Joffrey is greyer in the books, because there are more hints at his desire to win King Robert's approval and stuff. Also, the fact that he seems naturally evil makes him interesting and gives depth to Cercei's conflicting feelings for him. The slavers and the Boltons on the other hand are products of tradition to a certain extent, and are evil because we reject those traditions. The mutineers had motives for their revolt, some of them were pretty dark guys before, but many were victims of circumstances, so to speak. They weren't sadistic sociopaths before, so it seems bloody likely that the aftermath of the revolt left them with conflicting feelings. Anyway, I'm not sure what you are trying to say. That because Martin has characters that are inherently evil the show isn's suffering from it's increase in black and white characterisation?
1355	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-29	I am not saying the scene in Craster's Keep was an easy thing to watch. Not at all. I skipped it on my rewatch of the episode because it is simply too disturbing. But it felt completely in-style with George's writing. He tends to go over the top with the description of violence and it's hard to find a chapter, in which someone is not raped, threatened with rape or someone is not boasting about how they raped somebody. It's just that reading about it is slightly easier than watching it. It's been awhile since I read ASoS so I don't remember the details but Sam's description of what was happening at Craster's after the mutiny was a pretty disturbing read.Â 
Â 
The mutineers were mostly rapers and murderers who were forced to join the Watch. I think it portrayed "nicely" how they are basically dead men walking living in the moment: they have no structure, no organisation and no purpose. If they go back to Westeros they're dead, if they leave Craster's and head north they're dead. We see the stage between the "kids thrown into a candy shop" to the "Craster's larder is not infinite and this is the rest of our fucking lives".
Â 
I don't see a problem with them keeping Ghost. Direwolf is a rarity, a source of entertainment, and they (or especially Karl) might have though that they could tame him eventually (Jon did why can't they?). A trained direwolf could hunt for them, protect them, intimidate others etc. They probably just fed him scraps or some junk that nobody else would eat anyways.Â

I'm trying to say people have a double standard when it comes to these type of characters.  GRRM can have the Mountain, Lurch and the Murmmers be as evil as he likes. Rape, hurt, steal and kill people for fun. Once D&D do it though, well we have a right to bitch because it's not real and the characters aren't grey.

Â 
Good point, actually. However, the tragedy of that realisation could have exploited further, though. For a moment there, I thought they might make Ras a somewhat tragic character who realised he'd fucked up. Instead: skull, rape, a speech that used f- and c-words so often it started to bore me halfway through - mission accomplished, viewers now understand that these guys are bad. The Apocalypse Now atmosphere was there for a moment, but soon the scene had more a 1950s comic book description of communists that of the totally sublime horror of The Heart of Darkness.
1358	Rhaenys_Targaryen	2014-04-29	on one of the HBO sites the other who turns the baby is listed as the "nights king", you can still find this information on reddit as HBO took it down not long after putting it up.

So this is something confirmed? Or is it possible some fan put it online, as a fact, while it actually was his/her own interpretation?

Â 
Okay, but I still think you're pretty quick there with the word 'double standards'. I'm not saying make every bad guy somebody who's only bad because his daddy beat him. I love Ramsay. The castration intro was bad, the torture close-ups unnecessary, but the scenes itself served a clear purpose. Ramsay was translated well into screen and nobody is complaining that he isn't grey. But him being naturally evil serves the story in many ways. At Craster's, having the mutineers being worse than Ramsay does not serve the story, it simplifies it, makes it less interesting it, takes away complexity.

What complexity is gone by having some random NW deserters who were probably rapists or thieves be bad people? We know there's all sorts of NW men, good, bad, somewhere in between. These are the really bad ones, you know since they killed their previous commander and the guy that offered them shelter. Having them raping women off screen instead would've made them more complex? Or if he was just drinking out of a cup and not a skull, that makes him much more interesting? Ok, then.

Also, I wouldn't say they're remotely worse than Ramsay.

Often tough, the show adds sex and sexual violence to a scene that didn't have any in the books. Some for good reason. Many for no good reason at all.


Â 
People need to understand the difference between books and TV for this. Martin has the "luxury" of writing the scenes on paper. He has no time allotment, is able to use internal monologue to help include much of the "depth that the show omits", and does not have to physically produce a set with real people, animals, etc. Martin could have taken 25 pages with a 'Karl' or 'Rast' viewpoint to flesh out all of the details on that scene to make the readers completely despise these mutineers. He could include many other ways of making it known that Craster's wives were being beaten and raped without a first hand description of what was happening.Â 
Â 
It's impossible for the runners to do anything close to this. They have to show it on the screen, and it has to be done within an allotted period of actual screen time. There is just no way anyone can compare the two and say that GRRM does it much more 'tastefully', etc. It comes down to whether or not fans want the show to try to be as impactful as the books are. If they do, then these types of scenes need to be shown, there's really no way around it. There's no right or wrong answer either. I'd be fine with it if someone said something like 'the rape scenes were to disturbing, I'd prefer it if the show wasn't as dramatic as the books in this area and they toned this down". Nothing wrong with this at all. When comparing these two mediums though I think people lose sight of #1 how different they really are and #2 How immensely challenging it is to take a television show and try to match the level of impact a book does.Â

Or if he was just drinking out of a cup and not a skull, that makes him much more interesting? Ok, then.


Â 
It doesn't make them more interesting, I think that's the wrong word, but it does make them out to be much more than just bad guys. They are downright, terrible scumbags. We've been told they were rapists, thieves, etc, but that was back in the first season. Other than this scene, and the scene where Craster and Mormont are killed, what have we seen to substantiate that these guys are so bad? And even when Craster and Mormont were killed, I took that more of this was a group of starving, freezing, tired men who have been outside in the sub-freezing temps for a really long time, and were more at the point of lunacy then just being down right terrible people. Craster gives them shelter, probably because he knows he has to. If he says no, what's stopping Mormont from saying, well tough we are staying anyway, there are x amount of us and 1 of you. Craster knows this. Then he mocks them by giving them small portions of practically gruel to eat.Â 
Â 
So making them rape women on screen and drink blood out of skulls certainly does serve a HUGE purpose. It doesn't make them more interesting, but it takes them from 'bad men' to 'scum of the earth, horrible people, the lowest of the low.' I think this is what the show runners were going for, and this was what the needed to to do accomplish it.Â
1366	King Theon	2014-04-29	I'm firmly in the camp of thinking that there was nothing wrong with having rape scenes at Craster's Keep. Well, obviously it's horrifically wrong, but from the perspective of the TV show I think it was necessary. The implication of rape has nowhere near the same effect (in my opinion, at least) as gruesomely showing the horror of it when in the following scene involves characters you love being captured by the bad guys.
Â 
They made it tasteless, they made it terrifying and they made us hate the characters. That's exactly what that scene needed, I thought.
Â 
So what if we're not given a backstory about why these people are evil? When a minor character goes around doing selfless things, do we demand an explanation on why they haven't descended into anarchy? Karl Tanner will almost certainly be dead soon, what's the point in fleshing out why he's horrendous?
Â 
The best example of why I thought it worked was Meera's reaction to realising that the Night's Watch people at Craster's are rapists. She's the one who cowered in fear upon realising what these people are capable of, while Bran - who is seemingly too young to understand what evil men can do in the world of Westeros - is oblivious. I immediately empathised with Meera's fears, knowing how awful the people inside that shelter were having seen moments ago, and wanted them to get away. When they get caught seconds later, it makes the feeling of dread intensify too.

Â 
Totally agree that this effect was achieved. I only wonder why it is necessary for them to be scumbags. We have enough of them, and they are all of them more interesting and balanced than the mutineers. We can totally agree to disagree whether they should be portrayed this or that way. All I'm saying is: It's easy to portray them as scumbags. That's easy screenwriting. We see scumbags a lot. Recent series, especially on HBO, have shown us that TV can go other ways. Making it less easy and thereby often more interesting. Fox could do scenes like the one at Craster's. HBO could do more. I resent them for not doing so.
1368	Cas Stark	2014-04-29	Sorry, this to me is an example of people bending over backwards to excuse the show for injecting pointless sexual violence. Â We don't need to "see" them raping anyone to know they are bad, we already know they are bad because they killed Mormont.

GRRM takes every chance he can get to be brutally graphic. The point is he does it for a reason. I don't think we needed to see rape or anything, but there's plenty of violence and terror in both mediums so let's at least try to be consistent in our scrutiny.Â
1371	rmholt	2014-04-29	One difference I think I see in this season is more direct guidance to the watchers.
1372	Ghost wind	2014-04-29	In a general opinion a good transition episode, probably next episodes will have more action or something, but this was a very good set up in all places treated.Â 
Â 
More detailed:Â 
Â 
Daenerys: I'm liking Grey Worm more each day. Already liked him a lot in the books (his speech about keeping his name because Dany freed him is one of my favorite parts in the books) and making him more sentimental allows the audience to sympathize with him. When the slaves attacked the master I just thought of the Sons of the Harpy with the blood on the walls and everything. And woow Meeren is huuuge! And the flag, every guy who climbed up there to put the flag should be given a lordship or something...
Bronn/Jaime: Average Bronn awesomeness..Â 
Jaime/Tyrion: very good scene pictures really well Tyrion's situation.
Littlefinger/Sansa: good dialogue, especially liked the fading out to Qot and Marge in the gardens.
QoT/Margaery: as we say in Spain "de tal palo tal astilla" (Like father, like son). We do know now where Marge gets form all her seducing knowledge....Â 
1st scene on the Wall: very positive things such as Locke kicking the other guy's ass at fighting or the "Guess I was wrong.." Anyway I was a little annoyed at Slynt suggesting Jon as a Lord Commander. This is supposed to be a surprise nobody expects which Sam only achieves to prevent Slynt from being LC.
Margaery/Tommen: poooor kid he was completely shocked! I loved that scene. The look on his face, the way he could barely talk like he was enchanted or something... "When we marry I become yours, forever" and he is like and what does that mean?? hahahaha. Also at the end when he is kind of expecting a kiss and he gets one on the forehead.. I laughed so much with this scene...
Brienne leaves: Pod is so much better than in the book.. The way his smile fades completely when Brienne rejects him was so funny... hahaha.Â 
Jon's speech: loved it! Especially how nobody was getting up and I was almost shouting: "Please Grenn please!!" And the when Locke got up I was like ooooh yeah! Anyway I like how we are seeing Jon being someone loved in the NW and everything!
Craster's keep: there's a big change but too soon to say if it is good or bad, anyway interesting to see what happens from now on...Â 
WW: man that was creepy! And anyway a great shock because we don't know almost anything about the Others so a nice clue for us to work on!

Â 
Well, speaking about this one scene in particular, I think yes, we did need to see them raping and drinking out of Mormont's skull. This was not pointless sexual violence. Again, this was taking bad guys to 'terrible, horrible, scumbag, etc, etc. Had a purpose, served it's purpose. I hate these guys. I want them to get mutilated. This whole thing is just about this scene/this episode, and it's why we're talking about it on this particular thread. Has nothing to do with the other stuff. I kind of agree with you about the other things referenced especially Jaime/Cersei, but this scene got the point across and reached the height of impact they were going for and it would not have if it was 'toned down'.

So what about the story of the Mountain raping the innkeepters daughter? What about Ramsay violating corpses of dead women? Or forcing Theon to provide cunnilingus to fArya? There is plenty of sexual violence and pointless gratuity in both mediums, yet for whatever reason, the show gets the brunt of the criticism.Â

Think about people's strong reactions to sexual violence though. As a society, not many people are more hated than rapists and people guilty of sexual assault. Showing it - and showing how horrible it is - is a valid way of making the viewer loathe the mutineers.
Â 
I think saying that they portray sexual violence all the time is a reason not to do it as an argument against this scene is not fair - we're surely discussing an isolated scene in an isolated storyline here. When in Jon or Bran's storylines have we seen rape yet (implied with Craster's in the past, I think, I might be wrong though)? Yes, they killed Mormont, but this is another level of evil (at least in most readers' eyes). So I think it adds to the foreboding and horror for when Bran's captured and the assumed elation when Jon arrives to give them what they deserve.

Â 
What is the narrative purpose of taking bad guys who Jon is going to kill and making them terrible, horrible scumbags who Jon is going to kill? Â It isn't like they've introduced a new set of players who are going to be around a while. Â
1377	Widows_Blood	2014-04-29	I also don't understand what people expected was supposed to be happening at Crasters. In the books it is made clear they are being raped. These are men that have profaned their vows, who are at the watch because they were murderers and rapists to begin with, who now have a degree of autonomy from their former lives and are surrounded by young women who they have complete control over. Did you expect them to be sitting around drinking tea and singing songs?
1378	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-29	So what about the story of the Mountain raping the innkeepters daughter? What about Ramsay violating corpses of dead women? Or forcing Theon to provide cunnilingus to fArya? There is plenty of sexual violence and pointless gratuity in both mediums, yet for whatever reason, the show gets the brunt of the criticism.Â

The thing that people are forgetting is that watching something happen, even in the background of a TV scene is much different than reading about it. You can choose to visualize it or not when you read, and you don't hear cries of pain or torment. You can kind of block it out and deal with it yourself. Honestly the books are like 100x worse than the show, imagine they showed someone raping a septa and literally chewing her tits off? Or starving a woman and having her chew off her own fingers? It would be ludicrous.Â

Right, natural and intrinsic are synonymous. I'm saying there's plenty of intrinsic evil in Planetos. The story isn't evil vs. good, but this idea of grey and nuanced characters applies to the main characters. Plenty of minor characters are just horrible fucks naturally. I mean he even wrote in a character whose blood smelled evil...wtf?!

They can be, Inherent can be used instead.
There is no Sauron/Orc. There might be true psychopaths. The Mountain might be a good candidate. But the barbarity of the time Martin has studied was greater than it is now. There are heinous acts, and characters committing atrocities, but there isn't any inherent 'evil'. That's a simplistic viewpoint that is a hangover from High Fantasy.

I'm not going to debate semantics so I'll agree that GRRM is plainly creating a world where it's not good vs. evil, but I'm not really even sure what your initial comment is aimed toward, then? I don't think the show is just going to make the WW's evil beiings fighting against the "Good" dragons or whatever, if that's what you were getting at.

 Â  I am personally glad that they are toning down thing for the show: not sure if I could handle watching Ramsay's victim being torn apart by the hounds. I just don't understand why apparently any rape/violence described by GRRM serves plot or character development purpose while if depicted on the show it is gratuitous and only serves to fulfil HBO boob quota.

My point exactly. Honestly, which scenes from seasons 2 and 3 that showed explicit nudity, sex or rape made you think "wow, showing that totally gave depth and credibility to the story". I'm completely okay with scenes that show nudity and sex, sometimes even if it's pointless, just to set the tone and create the roughness of the world the story is set in. However, if those scenes have people roll their eyes or place bets on how many boobs you see per episode, that's bad storytelling, plain and f*cking simple. And it seems that this is where we are going. Think of the 'walk of shame' for a moment. Will that scene still have an impact? Or will viewers, by that point, just say: "Yes, finally we see her tits as well!". My guess is, the second reaction is become the more likely one. And how awful that would be for this unforgetting scene ...

No because a person telling a story about how someone was rapped and murdered isn't as powerful as showing it. You're getting books mixed up with tv. In books you can either have a character hear about how someone was harmed or have the character experience the harm and still keep the same effect. On a tv show or movie everything has to be shown visually. That's just how tv works.

1390	Alia Atreides	2014-04-29	I am not saying the scene in Craster's Keep was an easy thing to watch. Not at all. I skipped it on my rewatch of the episode because it is simply too disturbing. But it felt completely in-style with George's writing. He tends to go over the top with the description of violence and it's hard to find a chapter, in which someone is not raped, threatened with rape or someone is not boasting about how they raped somebody. It's just that reading about it is slightly easier than watching it. It's been awhile since I read ASoS so I don't remember the details but Sam's description of what was happening at Craster's after the mutiny was a pretty disturbing read.Â 
Â 
The mutineers were mostly rapers and murderers who were forced to join the Watch. I think it portrayed "nicely" how they are basically dead men walking living in the moment: they have no structure, no organisation and no purpose. If they go back to Westeros they're dead, if they leave Craster's and head north they're dead. We see the stage between the "kids thrown into a candy shop" to the "Craster's larder is not infinite and this is the rest of our fucking lives".
Â 
I don't see a problem with them keeping Ghost. Direwolf is a rarity, a source of entertainment, and they (or especially Karl) might have though that they could tame him eventually (Jon did why can't they?). A trained direwolf could hunt for them, protect them, intimidate others etc. They probably just fed him scraps or some junk that nobody else would eat anyways.Â 


Â 
 
Â 
This is an excellent point just because they took the Black did not mean they stopped being the Men that forced them to take the Black in the first place. You did not see this happen with Grenn and others because they were not murderers and rapists at heart. I've been saying this since yesterday that while some seem to be on an offense of rape being shown for rape's sake these are the types of men that they are, there is a Heart of Darkness in them they are vile inside they are not good men because it is not a part of who they are it is not in their make up.Â 
Â 
As Ned said in the first novel the Â most dangerous of men are those who have nothing left to lose. These men have nothing left they can be as vile as they wish because yes they are dead men anyway. As for people saying why Craster's Daughter's did not really fight back an allow it to happen first no one allows themselves to be raped but you can be quite conditioned to sexual and physical abuse especially if this is all you have ever known. I think they are in essence (the writeres) are trying to handle the psychological make up that comes with not only people who have sociopath natures, but also people who are battered, conditioned into submission whether it is from their own Father or other men.
Â 
Oh and while I was so upset to see sweet Ghost trapped I was really happy he made an appearance I screamed Ghost when I saw him and then was mad at the same time

Some viewers will think the latter, but the show can't help that. There's always going to be some viewers who care more about nudity than plot, and it's more of a loss to them. I'm sure it'll try its hardest to show how humiliating and degrading the experience is for Cersei (if it doesn't, then that's a whole other kettle of fish). But this Craster's scene is *nothing* in tone like Cersei's walk of shame. It serves to show how evil the mutineers are without the degradation of a main character who the viewers have grown to care about. The degradation on show is definitely impactful though, it's just that the point of the scene isn't the same.
Â 
This feels like a circular debate at this point, to be honest. Some people aren't going to feel like the rape scenes work, some people are. I just think that it's upped the hatred of the mutineers and created an excellent sense of dread in the final 15 minutes. To each their own.
1392	Dany's Silver	2014-04-29	I'm firmly in the camp of thinking that there was nothing wrong with having rape scenes at Craster's Keep. Well, obviously it's horrifically wrong, but from the perspective of the TV show I think it was necessary. The implication of rape has nowhere near the same effect (in my opinion, at least) as gruesomely showing the horror of it when in the following scene involves characters you love being captured by the bad guys.
Â 
They made it tasteless, they made it terrifying and they made us hate the characters. That's exactly what that scene needed, I thought.
Â 
So what if we're not given a backstory about why these people are evil? When a minor character goes around doing selfless things, do we demand an explanation on why they haven't descended into anarchy? Karl Tanner will almost certainly be dead soon, what's the point in fleshing out why he's horrendous?
Â 
The best example of why I thought it worked was Meera's reaction to realising that the Night's Watch people at Craster's are rapists. She's the one who cowered in fear upon realising what these people are capable of, while Bran - who is seemingly too young to understand what evil men can do in the world of Westeros - is oblivious. I immediately empathised with Meera's fears, knowing how awful the people inside that shelter were having seen moments ago, and wanted them to get away. When they get caught seconds later, it makes the feeling of dread intensify too.


I don't think that Bran is ignorant of the evil men can do in the world of Westeros; he lived through the Ironborn taking Winterfell!
Â 


Apologies if this has been mentioned elsewhere on this thread (did not have a chance to go through all 50 pages) but did people spot that little reference of Tyrion's regarding Sansa: "she is not a killer... not yet"
Â 
Things not looking too rosy for Sweet Robin it seems ...


I believe that while Book!Sansa knows that Littlefinger is having Maester Colemon dose Robin more regularly with sweet sleep than he should, I don't think she'll have a hand in Robin's death. If anything, she's going to get some sweet motherfucking revenge on Littlefinger's ass both in the book and the show, and I predict that I will thoroughly enjoy both depictions!

Â 
"From the books, I remember sexual violence as a power device in relation with the characters of Cersei and Sansa, and of course Dany before her emancipation. But if it is simply spread out evenly as a narrative device indicating evil-ness and power/powerlessness, it completely ceases to be narratively convincing. It ceases to be critical but becomes a trope re-establishing sexual violence as a simple gender-power struggle. That is not what GRRM does."

Except for the whole part of the story where women are being raped in the Riverlands, mutilated by the mountain, hunted down by Ramsay, violated as corpses and even forced to perform bestiality. Other than all those parts, I agree that GRRM does not participate in using rape as a narrative device to indicate evil-ness and powerlessness.Â

Â 
There are definitely parts of the story where that's true. But he/she seem to conveniently forget all the other times it's brutal and unnecessary. People just don't seem to mind as much when they're reading apparently. To use that example again, there hasn't been a single thing close to as disturbing as someone raping a Silent Sister and literally chewing off her tits. No old lady tells Arya she's going to shove a stick up her vagina so the splinters hurt her. None of that was necessary, he could've just said this Silent Sister was raped and abused, did he have to mention fucking chewed up tits too? I'm a very visual person, when you write that down I imagine it immediately and it's fucking horrifying. He couldn't have just had the old lady say she would whack Arya with the stick? So let's just admit you prefer to read about gross brutaility rather than see it and get off this "GRRM uses violence so poignantly and never overdoes it"

1407	ViennaGirl	2014-04-29	People's reactions to the concept of rape in the books and the show are interesting. It seems like there are (1) people who dislike the non-book rape scenes that HBO has added to the show, (2) people who argue that any rape in the show is consistent with the books because the books are violent, and (3) people who don't want to call what happens in the show rape.
Â 
Why aren't we having this argument about non-rape violence, I wonder? No one is arguing about the 163 crucified kids. Maybe because that was exactly from the book? Or the people burned at the stake? Also in the book. Joffrey being poisoned? book. Jaime's hand? Book. Theon's torture? Book, but off-page. The rape scenes at issue aren't book rape scenes - they're the Cersei/Jaime sept scene (consensual in the book), and the Craster's scene (not in anyone's POV from the book).
Â 
It's not an issue of "oh, my delicate eyes can't take this horror," it's just people noting that HBO has added extra sexual violence scenes that weren't in the books. The reason they're doing it is because sex sells. Sexual violence sells. It's all right to point it out.

Â 
People are much more sensitive about rape than they are about, for example, stabbing. There's also this recent fad of acting as if rape is the most offensive thing to you imaginable...Just look at the forum warning. There's a whole warning about talking about rape because it's such a sensitive topic. Look at the reaction to Jaime/Cersei.
Â 
I don't really think your assertion that rape sells is really true. Sex sells. Violence sells. I don't think rape sells.Â

Well, we can either have the current state of affairs or invented material (i.e., Bran) but we cannot have both.
Â 
To give some perspective, the first half of Arya's last chapter in A Storm of Swords took place in the first episode of the season.Â 


Â 
We also see the Titan Â in some of the previews, so her story line is being accelerated. People often forget that in the books Arya's first chapter after the Red Wedding ends were her taking an ax to the head (potentially leaving her dead) and then she doesn't have another chapter for a couple hundred pages.
Â 
Same is true with Bran in the sense that there are long periods of time between his chapters in the latter books. You either get fake filler or lose track of the character because they might be absent for several consecutive episodes. Idk if I love the changes, but they have got me dying for next week's episode, so to that effect, they were excellent.Â

think thats davos and stannis seeing the titan...theres a character on IMDB for episode 10 and hes titled as the "bravosi sailor" so shell likely leave out of saltpans in the last ep.Â

Â 
Yeah but in the books Arya is the first Character to reach Bravos. Seems like a fitting last 15 minutes of episode 10 to have (SPOILERS) a lion kill a lion, a low born bird kill a bird-by-marriage and Arya underneath the Titan.
1414	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-04-29	Hey folks,
Â 
I know there has been a lot of bashing how the WW looked at the end and comparisons of what it looked like. Maybe I'm on a limb here, but to me it looked like the yellow guy from Sin City with Darth Maul's thorns. I know the look isn't dead on, but the facial expressions sure were.
1415	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-04-29	Â 
Â 
I think Lancel will suffice.Â 
Â 
Also, if they are going to have a Coldhands, this is the time to do it since it was Coldhands who killed the mutineers in the book. If there is no Coldhands, this is the perfect time to have Jon Snow demonstrate his leadership skills so he has a reason to be voted as Lord Commander.Â 
Â 


Â 
Go back to the episode (1 or 2) where she says he took too long. She is clearly rubbing up on a different KG. But yes, I'm sad the Kettleblacks are cut. I loved the chapter where you find out they are all LF men.
1416	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-04-29	Â

1417	QueenSansa2	2014-04-29	Hey all. Just got registered for this forum... I've been waiting to be confirmed and have a lot pent up, so this is a bit long.Â I went through this whole topic and am surprised I didn't find what I was looking for to be discussed. So new points... and be easy on me, I've only read the books once, so I may have missed a few things.
1) Brienne and Jaime interaction. The last thing we know in the books is that Brienne was being hung for not returning the daughters to Catelyn. One of the biggest debates among fans, is whether Brienne is alive or not. Her last word was "Jaime". People think she lived because she would promise to Catelyn that she would avenge her, and kill Jaime. So the debate is - would Brienne kill Jaime? or would she not kill him and would she just be a sad woman who died with many unfulfilled oaths? I was really interested in the interaction between them on the show and watched closely. When Brienne took the sword and named it oathkeeper, did anyone else notice the eye contact language when that happened (there were several awkward seconds of it)? They both seem kind of sad and afraid of what that meant to call her sword oathkeeper. To me, that meant an understanding, that if it came to it, she would keep the oath she first kept with Catelyn. Meaning, Jaimie understood that meant that he could die by her oath. And that Brienne was sadly letting him know that. I mean that several awkward seconds of eye contact language could mean nothing, or it could mean exactly that! I was just disappointed that the show would hint to the answer of that mystery that Martin hasn't told yet.
2) Margaery and Tommen. Along the same lines. Tommen was described as a nice little boy who liked to play with his kittens, and that he got along well with Margary. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think she got him those kittens? She was using tactics in the book to appeal to a child... When Cersei wants to know who margaery is f***ing she does all that she can to find out who Marg gets alone with, and she is told that Marg is NEVER alone and always with her friends and girl friends. She wouldn't even believe that it would be Tommen that she was sleeping with. It was never implied that Marg would be sneaking around and having sexual relations with Tommen. SO that could mean, that Marg actually lost her virginity to Tommen and not anyone else, meaning she would win the trial and Cersei had it all wrong (duh). I thought the show pointing into this relationship that is secret even in the book, destroyed that mystery. Cersei will never know "their little secret" until the coming books but we do now. So that mystery untold by Martin is now destroyed. Not surprising again, and I'm not crying over it, but still disappointing that we have to find out from the show before we can read it. I was kind of intrigued at the idea that Marg had lied about being a virgin.
3) Margaery, Varys, and the children. People have been asking how did Marg get into Tommen's room. I am almost definitely certain Marg, Varys, and the orphan children are all working together. Marg appeared from the shadows and I think she came through a secret path that Varys showed her. The last sentence of the last book really had me asking questions. I had forgotten that the children were his birds. Varys is an orphan, those children are orphans. And when I was rewatching some episodes from previous GOT seasons, and watching Marg stop her cart in the streets to go talk to the children (I forgot the episode) made orphans by the war. She makes them like her and then says that if they need anything to go straight to her. Her connection with orphan children really has me suspecting she's working with Varys. When Varys in the last books says "for the children" it makes me think that he killed Kevan because he was about to start another war, making more orphans.
4) I mean we all know now who poisoned Joffrey. This was debated before this episode.
5) "sansa's not a killer, yet". ok thanks for that obvious foreshadowing.
6) you all have already talked about the Others in depth.
Is anyone else peeved about all this? Changes with the show I can grudgingly accept because they are two separate entities and they can take creative license to condense a complex story. BUT telling us what Martin hasn't told us yet? The things I listed are considerably minor, but it's only just begun. HBO is just getting started with telling us what happens in the next books.
1418	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-29	People's reactions to the concept of rape in the books and the show are interesting. It seems like there are (1) people who dislike the non-book rape scenes that HBO has added to the show, (2) people who argue that any rape in the show is consistent with the books because the books are violent, and (3) people who don't want to call what happens in the show rape.
Â 
Why aren't we having this argument about non-rape violence, I wonder? No one is arguing about the 163 crucified kids. Maybe because that was exactly from the book? Or the people burned at the stake? Also in the book. Joffrey being poisoned? book. Jaime's hand? Book. Theon's torture? Book, but off-page. The rape scenes at issue aren't book rape scenes - they're the Cersei/Jaime sept scene (consensual in the book), and the Craster's scene (not in anyone's POV from the book).
Â 
It's not an issue of "oh, my delicate eyes can't take this horror," it's just people noting that HBO has added extra sexual violence scenes that weren't in the books. The reason they're doing it is because sex sells. Sexual violence sells. It's all right to point it out.


Â 
There were many people, myself included, who felt that Theon's torture scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary.
Â 
I don't really understand the point you're trying to make. Â Death and violence are a reality of life and, therefore, have become a part of the vocabulary of most genres of entertainment. Â Rape and torture are not and, as such, well be held to higher levels of scrutiny.
Â 
Long story short, objectionable content presented in a reasonable context will generally be accepted, and when it has no point and/or goes to far then people tend to get upset. Â GRRM is far superior to D&D in terms of knowing which buttons and how hard to press. Â It is known.
Â 
EDT - GRRM also has the benefit of a more forgiving medium with respect to the depiction of these objectionable acts. Â Which is to say, GRRM both has an easier path to follow and is better at navigating it - that's why people who weren't troubled by the books get upset with the show.

1419	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-29	dont know if anybody posted this yet but did anybody notice the kid in the nightswatch saying hes a very good archer, hes gonna kill ygritte forsure


Â 
Good catch. I think you are right. He definitely had a good long look at Ygritte when he was hiding under the table (or what was it) during the wildlings attack.Â
1420	Gustavo	2014-04-29	And yes, they are still trying to follow the books. They just decided to have Bran do something interesting, since he really doesn't do much of consequence for most of books three and five and only has a couple of chapters in five at all. It's probably safe to assume that Bran is an important character, so giving him screen time is something that the showrunners would want to do, lest we forget about him. And if they continued to show him just being dragged around, viewers would start to grow increasingly bored like they did last season. This is a solution to that problem.
Â 


Â 
 
Â 


Â 
I heard people saying the White Walker Maul scene was from TWOW...maybe the prologue? I can't find the source that though.
Â 
And yes, they're definitely following the books. They know how it ends. They know they have to get from point A to point B. The books may be taking the meandering, scenic route, and the show may be taking the highway, but I think where the story ends will be quite similar.


Â 
I see.. How about Jon knowing that Bran is alive and is going Â north north north~
Â 


Â 
Â 
You'll fit in perfectly on this board.....


Â 
Uhmm.. should I thank you for this?Â
1421	King Theon	2014-04-29	Hi QueenSansa2! I'm a long-time lurker, only started properly rambling today, but I'll have a waffle at your points.
Â 
Re 1) I think you're reading into it a little into it. The pause, imo, was just dramatic/emotional tension. It would've been rubbish if they'd rushed the scene. I also disagree a little (a lot less convincingly, because this is just my theory!) about the Jaime-Brienne fate, as I think it'll be Jaime that kills Brienne in trial by combat, well, her telling him beforehand what she knows about Gendry etc, then letting him win.
Â 
Re 2) Again, I have to respectively disagree. I think the Tommen-Marge scene was brilliant. They only aged the actor up one year (he's still 16) in the show, but every kid is aged up a bit in the show. I don't *think* they'll ever have sex either in the show, just Marge c*ck-teasing. She defo has still been screwing around still, I think, with Loras is what I think the show will go with to avoid casting randomers. She didn't buy him Ser Pounce in the show as it would immediately giveaway this secret friendship they're building behind Cersei's back, which *should* result in an epic showdown between Marge and Cersei when she finds out! They have to do Cersei's storyline a little differently as a lot of her rage is just in her head in the books. Just my opinion, anyway.
Â 
Re 3) Another point, another respectful disagreement! My money's on her just sweet-talking the Kingsguard chap, she's the hottest woman in King's Landing after all. Then again, I think this is a plot hole for the show not to point out how she did it, especially following the Jaime-Cersei scene, so god knows. I also don't think Varys is starting a war as they've been in a permanent state of war since the end of book one, I'm in the 'he's a Blackfyre' camp so I think him killing Kevan is just to help put Cersei back in control to screw everything up and make it easier for Aegon to conquer.
Â 
Re 5) Foreshadowing or red herring? People get their knickers in far too much of a twist about this sort of stuff, I think it was a fun throwaway line that hints at a potential future but not necessarily definite foreshadowing. I'll hold my hands up and say I don't an effing clue though!
Â 
I figured I'd end my ramble by defending the show, which you seem peeved at. I say don't blame the show, blame GRRM. He knows how slow his writing of the series has become, it's his fault if the show overtakes the books. I realise it sucks that we're going to find out the ending in the show before the books (not everyone seems to have come to terms with this yet), so I don't think it's fair now the show's starting to overlap. Unless GRRM pulls the most shocking, brilliant bunny out of a hat and realises two massive books in the next two years, it's going to happen.

1422	rmholt	2014-04-29	I have $0.25 says her last word was not Jaime. If it were a person wouldn't it be Sansa or Cat first? 
Her mind wasn't on Jaime personally - only as a symbol of her oath to Cat
Anyway I have another $0.25 it wasn't a person's name.
When I long for book characters and events I go to the books. I don't miss all those damn cousins anyway.
People do go on about sth happening or not happening one week and sometimes the VERY NEXT WEEK it's resolved. For characters, if you don't need 'em, don't hire 'em. The books were specifically written without regard for budget and time - GRRM had been doing TV writing - so reverse-engineering the story into a TV show is going to require changes. 
To address your question, no I don't get mad. I didn't get mad watching the mess ppl made of The Lathe of Heaven or Dune either. I just don't watch those movies, and believe me, TLOH is one of the best things I've read on my entire life.  These guys are doing great work - ratings are past those for The Sopranos - IMHO and I appreciate what they've done. 
Read about the making of Ice Henge. Nothing like it has ever been done.  Many great things in the show have never been done before. And they are doing it well. It's epic.

GRRM has already confirmed that it was 'sword'. The BwB offered her the noose or the sword.

1426	QueenSansa2	2014-04-29	I guess I misread on a forum somewhere that Brienne said Jaime. My point is the same though. When I was reading through this I noticed people didn't really express a lot of anger over stuff...Â 

I guess having just finished reading the books, the passion is so fresh. And I'm not angry really, just want to know if they are getting away with telling me the answers to my questions! I had a million questions after reading the books and spent a week reading through the forums.

And for me reading to much into things, I think it's a give or take. Television and movies are known for predictability! I just saw these things as blatantly planting a seed for some future they already know about.Â

Getting angry over a TV show is a waste of time, really. Look at how angry people got over Jaime-Cersei, it wouldn't erase the scene and the controversy only actually served to bump the viewership for the following episode! I much prefer the books but I'm sympathetic to changes and overlapping as it's simply the nature of the books being unfinished and them being literally impossible to adapt exactly without being stupidly expensive and stupidly confusing.
Â 
There were definitely things I didn't like in the episode (Ghost caged, Marge sneaking into Tommen's room unexplained, Locke happening to waltz in as Sam bumbles out a contrived plot point that's coincidentally right), but I thought the vast majority was pretty brilliant.
1428	Killer B	2014-04-29	Long story short, objectionable content presented in a reasonable context will generally be accepted, and when it has no point and/or goes to far then people tend to get upset. Â GRRM is far superior to D&D in terms of knowing which buttons and how hard to press. Â It is known.


It is known.
I think this gets to the heart of the matter. If this were a one time thing, we would go, "Yuck, but man those guys were messed up." Instead its within the context of watching the abuse and death of two prostitutes, two consensual scenes being turned into rape, and it is in addition to all the rape that will be talked about or even shown as a matter of course since it was in the books (like stories about The Mountain etc).
It is too much. It is losing its power as a storytelling device and really does seem about making sure there naked women on the screen every episode.Â 
Also I question the people to think sexual violence happens constantly in the books. There are plenty of chapters that do not have any. That advance the plot with dialogue including politicking, storytelling, etc. Â There are also scenes with action, violence, and yes sexual violence, but they aren't used every chapter because it destroys their effect to do so.
1429	Oaf keeper	2014-04-29	Sorry, long time lurker, not much of a poster, but I think the Caster storyline could be pretty decent. Â I mean, having Ghost locked up is pretty lame, but whatever. Â I thought the Great Other or Night's King, whom ever, it's, looked lame as well. Â Too Sloth for me and surprised he didn't say, "Hey you guys!" Â Also, I think Bran will get out of Caster's by warging into Hodor and going all Mountain on those deserters (or so my fandom cries out for). Â Could be really great if that happens. Â

I'm with you on the Hodor warging front. Keeping all of my fingers and toes crossed for that. Then for Karl to tell Jon they killed Bran and Co. (because he's a mega-douche) so that Jon goes back to thinking he has no family and thus the Stannis offer situation goes back to normal.
1431	Gran de Lys	2014-04-29	Having read and re-read the books, scoured the forums, watched and re-watched all episodes, I still feel as if there are things they're throwing at us that I needed to have paid attention to but didn't. Like I gotta know who Karl is (soon to be was) now? It's like being Unsullied after countless hours of reading and watching. Sigh.Â 
Â 
Thoughts on the episode: I liked the Night King. I miss Shireen. Sansa's not as dumb as she looks. And welcome, Ser Pounce!

Hi King Theon, I totally agree that getting angry over a TV show is a waste of time. Which is why I mentioned that I'm not really that angry. But I should not be chastised for having an emotional reaction to something I'm passionate about. That being said, my emotions were not even the point of my original posting. In fact, I regret mentioning it. I'm more interested if my observations/theories have any potential merit according to other people in this forum. I did see all your disagreements about my post. Respectfully point taken.
I would appreciate if others took on the topics I brought up.
thanks!

Â
1433	Lady Stonestark	2014-04-29	I was wondering if LF and Sansa are not going to the Fingers, if they are going to do away with the Marillion/Sansa plot.  He starts to make advances to her at the Fingers, or are they going to have that scene at the Eyrie.
1434	Itchyscratch	2014-04-29	After the speculation last week about Bronn maybe deceiving Tyrion I was pleased to see him taking Jaime to task about not going to visit his brother. Bronn isn't squeaky clean but I do think he likes Tyrion enough to want himÂ to survive and for that reason he'll be batting for him even if he's taking someone else's money at some point in the story.
Â 
The Jaime / Brienne scenes were great. I don't think it will end up being the big romance others do. Not in the physical sense anyway. But it's nice to see them having meaningful scenes. Wish the Hound had been there commentating when they were discussing what to name the sword.
Â 
Will be really pissed if Ghost dies during the upcoming fight at Crasters. Surely one of the direwolves has to live to bite off the face of someone evil and important!
Â 
Olenna's remark about throwing herself off the cliff if she makes that walk one more time makes me wonder if it was a throwaway comment or if we'll see her splattered at the bottom of the Kings LandingÂ rockface at some point.

Â 
Final comment on the subject, because it has exhausted itself and most important points were made on this page and the one before: All the things on your list are not described in the book. They are stories about things that happened off-page. GRRM hardly ever describes such scenes first-hand to establish a character or a setting. If he did, the books would be unbearable. As was mentioned before: on TV, you hear screams of pain and anguish, you see things as they happen. Apples and oranges. Showing that stuff all the time on screen cannot be excused or explained by saying "Yo, that was in the books, man!". Yes, it was in the books. But used to a very different narrative effect - as a reader, you shudder and hope you will never be in such a scene as witness. The show sadistically puts you there on purpose. Period. Puts it in there to get viewers by showing lots of boobs. Period. 2 out of 3 scenes with sex and nudity don't serve the story, but the reputation of the show as "Game of Tits". Period. It's still a good show, but sometimes boobs are in the way of other scenes that are not adapted. Which bloody annoys me (and hey, I like boobs).

That's what I thought. I'm starting to doubt whether he didn't actually put Shae on the ship like he said. Anyway, I've got no clue how they're gonna do trial/Shae/Tywin's chambers/Tysha-Cercei-reveal. Looking forward to this very much, but afraid they could mess this up pretty badly.

I confess to firing GRRM a testy enote thinking he had made an unBrienne and lecturing him on doing it properly.
1448	rmholt	2014-04-30	I mean, having Ghost locked up is pretty lame, but whatever. . Â 

The only thing that pissed me off was Ghost vocalizing. Come on!
1449	The Wrong Tree	2014-04-30	The only thing that pissed me off was Ghost vocalizing. Come on!


I completely forgot about that! But I think that it would have taken too much time to show that Ghost was always silent and since it isn't a major plot point I can understand why they changed it.
Â 
So normally, when they change something in the show I can see why they did it and how it will lead to the same place that the books went. But I am so thoroughly confused about what they are doing with Bran and Jon! Also, since Jon knows that Bran is alive and with Locke at the wall are they going to have the Boltons become aware of Bran being alive? In the books we know that Davos ends up finding out about the younger Stark boys being alive but is this foreshadowing that eventually someone will try ot find Bran in the north? I saw in an interview with D&D that GRRM told them how the series ends so that they can complete the tv show even if the books aren't finished. Which means that things in the tv totally reveal stuff to the book readers.
Like how there is no longer a debate if Robb's heir will be his son or Jon Snow. Since the baby died in the tv show we now know that GRRM will make Jon Snow be Robbs heir in the books.

I just hope they will do the right thing and get Jon back to the Wall for that.Â  Now that he's going to Crasters, I had a horrible thought that they may skip his role in the defence of the wall and have him captured by ManceÂ or otherwise ending up straight in Mance's tent so as to be positioned there for the Stannis arrival.Â  In which case there'd be no last "you know nothing Jon Snow".Â  Surely they won't do that to us?!!?
1451	hedgeknight001	2014-04-30	They can be, Inherent can be used instead.
There is no Sauron/Orc. There might be true psychopaths. The Mountain might be a good candidate. But the barbarity of the time Martin has studied was greater than it is now. There are heinous acts, and characters committing atrocities, but there isn't any inherent 'evil'. That's a simplistic viewpoint that is a hangover from High Fantasy.
Horrible is not 'evil.'
You're defining evil out of existence then, but without cause to do so. 
Inherent or natural evil, as I believe we all would understand it, is that which cannot be redeemed because it is intrinsic to what the being is, i.e., orcs. The being is born that way, will live that way, and will die that way, no matter the amount of nurturing it receives. Nature defeats nurture, in this case.
But the show & book demonstrate plenty of minor characters (Biter, Rorge, Karl) and definitely not minor characters (Joffrey, The Mountain) who are inherently/naturally evil. They are, effectively, GRRM's version of orcs.
But, no matter -- Westeros is, no matter how much GRRM might protest, still a fantasy world and not comparable at all to reality, so I'm fine with that.

She's not dead, and that isn't even her last chapter.  She shows up in Jaime's chapter in Dance and leads him off to save Sansa, who she says the Hound is threatening to kill if Jaime doesn't come with her and alone.
1457	Ginevra	2014-04-30	2) Margaery and Tommen. Along the same lines. Tommen was described as a nice little boy who liked to play with his kittens, and that he got along well with Margary. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think she got him those kittens? She was using tactics in the book to appeal to a child... When Cersei wants to know who margaery is f***ing she does all that she can to find out who Marg gets alone with, and she is told that Marg is NEVER alone and always with her friends and girl friends. She wouldn't even believe that it would be Tommen that she was sleeping with. It was never implied that Marg would be sneaking around and having sexual relations with Tommen. SO that could mean, that Marg actually lost her virginity to Tommen and not anyone else, meaning she would win the trial and Cersei had it all wrong (duh). I thought the show pointing into this relationship that is secret even in the book, destroyed that mystery. Cersei will never know "their little secret" until the coming books but we do now. So that mystery untold by Martin is now destroyed. Not surprising again, and I'm not crying over it, but still disappointing that we have to find out from the show before we can read it. I was kind of intrigued at the idea that Marg had lied about being a virgin.


I thought exactly the same things about the books. Â I really believe that Margaery's secret affair was with Tommen. Â Yes, he's a baby, especially in the books, but nothing is sacred in this series. Â And GRRM loves to surprise us.
1458	Ginevra	2014-04-30	I'm more interested if my observations/theories have any potential merit according to other people in this forum. I did see all your disagreements about my post. Respectfully point taken.
I would appreciate if others took on the topics I brought up.
thanks!


I loved all of your theories, and not just because I'd shared one of them. Â I can understand that some people don't like to speculate without loads of proof, but I do love making giant leaps from little hints, especially when these baby clues all point the same way. Â Not all theories will pan out, or even most, but that is the joy we can find in between the books - guessing but not knowing what may be.
1459	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-30	Also, since Jon knows that Bran is alive and with Locke at the wall are they going to have the Boltons become aware of Bran being alive?Â

...that's why Locke is at the wall. Bolton knows because Reek told Ramsay, then telling Roose. Roose then told Locke to go find them offering a holdfast as reward.

I could see that happening. He's a very different personality than Satin, but he could play the same part. And I could see why it would piss people off if Jon names him his steward.Â 
Â 
It would be cool to see him kill Ygritte though, and maybe some other wildlings who killed his family.Â
1462	Widows_Blood	2014-04-30	The show is really starting to get into possible future book events. I`m intrigued whether the whole Jon learning about Bran being alive is something that happens in a future book and the show decided to get it out of the way rather then doing it in season 6 or 7. The whole Sansa not being a killer yet, Whitewalker stuff, has me thinking the show is laying down the tracks for future seasons as well.Â
1463	Alia Atreides	2014-04-30	Hey all. Just got registered for this forum... I've been waiting to be confirmed and have a lot pent up, so this is a bit long.Â I went through this whole topic and am surprised I didn't find what I was looking for to be discussed. So new points... and be easy on me, I've only read the books once, so I may have missed a few things.
2) Margaery and Tommen. Along the same lines. Tommen was described as a nice little boy who liked to play with his kittens, and that he got along well with Margary.

I was kind of intrigued at the idea that Marg had lied about being a virgin.
Is anyone else peeved about all this? Changes with the show I can grudgingly accept because they are two separate entities and they can take creative license to condense a complex story. BUT telling us what Martin hasn't told us yet? The things I listed are considerably minor, but it's only just begun. HBO is just getting started with telling us what happens in the next books.

Hi Sansa:Â 
Â 
Was a long time lurker here too just started really posting yesterday. Now regarding the theory of Margery trying to win over Tommen with kittens yes, she did give him thee little black kittens. As for the other one I seem to recall that it was Maester Pycelle whoÂ hesitantlyÂ told Cersei of the Little Queen ordering Moon Tea. Even if she was having relations with her husband he is 8 years old he'd be unable to give her babies unless he is already producing sperm at such a tender age which I doubt. I don't see where any mystery here is being foretold to us. I've read GRMM back and forth several times and don't ever seem to come across anything that would even suggest thisÂ occurring. I honestly find that really distasteful and I believe Margery would still be in a bit of trouble in having sex with a child even if said child is her husband. I will admit I am quite curious to know who she is playing around with and what the story is behind that one 
Â 
Also its been told in several interviews that George has told them the end of what is to come, yes they do have to in times take creative license make somethings up as are taking POV and having to create the characters not only from the POV characters point but who they are as well. From anything I've read on the two writers is they love George and his works I do not think they are setting out toÂ destroyÂ it etc. Â
1464	Honey Badger	2014-04-30	I like the shots fired across the bow with the Night King reveal.Â  Looks like people planning to stop watching the show when it catches up with the books should consider starting early.Â  This was a pretty big reveal considering the books haven't really explained The Others yet.Â  My guess is Winds of Winter will lay out their back story, and even offer a POV.
Â 
I'm a book reader who remembers the Unsullied television watchers worrying about spoilers.Â  For the first time, the tables have flipped.Â  At this point I'm starting to switch over and now like the show more than the books.Â  At least, my favorite is the first trilogy, then the show, then Feast and Dance.Â  We'll see about Winds when it comes out.

Pycelle is such a tool and Margaery so sly I bet she hasn't been fooling around with anyone. Re her examination even Cersei knows that isn't reliable.  Pycelle if he thought a Lannister would like to hear something he would make something up.

Lol, maybe Marg asked Pycelle for the Moon Tea (without really needing it) so that he would tell Cersei, and she would think she had something on Marg. Â I agree, Pycelle is a tool, so Marg may as well use him.

1471	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-04-30	God damn. That's some serious close observation there. Well done!
1472	Dany's Silver	2014-04-30	After the speculation last week about Bronn maybe deceiving Tyrion I was pleased to see him taking Jaime to task about not going to visit his brother. Bronn isn't squeaky clean but I do think he likes Tyrion enough to want himÂ to survive and for that reason he'll be batting for him even if he's taking someone else's money at some point in the story.
Â 
The Jaime / Brienne scenes were great. I don't think it will end up being the big romance others do. Not in the physical sense anyway. But it's nice to see them having meaningful scenes. Wish the Hound had been there commentating when they were discussing what to name the sword.
Â 
Will be really pissed if Ghost dies during the upcoming fight at Crasters. Surely one of the direwolves has to live to bite off the face of someone evil and important!
Â 
Olenna's remark about throwing herself off the cliff if she makes that walk one more time makes me wonder if it was a throwaway comment or if we'll see her splattered at the bottom of the Kings LandingÂ rockface at some point.


I certainly hope that Bronn isn't deceiving Tyrion, and that somehow Shae will have been smuggled off the boat by one of Cersei's agents.Â  I also want Varys to be genuinely surprised when Shae shows up at the trial.Â  She simply has to be there in the Tower of the Hand after the trial ends badly for Tyrion!Â  As for Olenna, I assume she'll be seen again in TWOW (I can't see her missing Margaery's trial, unless the Ironborn raiding the Reach somehow makes travel unsafe for her), but I doubt she'll end up being thrown from a cliff (she's much smarter than her foolish husband, who rode off a cliff while hunting/hawking!).

He needn't necessarily replace Satin (although that's possible), but I suspect he'll be one of those young orphans who comes to CB and will be given the chance to take his vows when he's old enough to do so.

1474	Laniki	2014-04-30	Locke is a creation of HBO and takes the place of Vargo and the Bloody Mummers. Sending Locke to the Wall to kill Bran and Jon is only in the HBO script. I think the reason is that HBO wants to develop an enemy relationship between Jon and Ramsey early so that Jon's dealings with the Bolton's have more significance to the TV audience. As basically all of ADwD was dedicated to the Winterfell story, it may be one of the most important plots in the whole series.Â

In the show, Ramsey wasn't at Winterfell to aid in the murder and cover-up of the Stark boy's "deaths." This would imply that Locke cannot know about Bran or Rickon being alive. So maybe he was sent there by Bolton to make up for Jamie's hand and kill Jon. What I love most about this change is that none of us know for sure, so it's like reading the books :-)
Â 
However, all that being said, we're getting robbed of the whole death by ear bite sequence.Â

GRRM has told each actor something true about their characters, which is not already made explicit in the books.Â  I suspect he told Sean Bean that Lyanna is Jon's mother, which is why he seems a bit choked up when promises Jon that the next time they see each other they'll talk about Jon's mother. I suspect that Kit is also aware of Jon's true parentage.

It's apparent that Locke takes Hoat's place, which is why I find it a stretch that the same character will take another book character's place.Â  I'd much rather see Ghost snap at Locke, because he's a great judge of character.Â
1488	Ghost wind	2014-04-30	Â I hope Summer and Ghost make it happen. Â If not, Bran's gonna warg.


Â 
Imagine Bran warging on Jon or something like that! Would be mind-blowing
1489	Dany's Silver	2014-04-30	Imagine Bran warging on Jon or something like that! Would be mind-blowing


I just cannot see Bran doing that to Jon. He could cause Jon to misstep while fighting the mutineers.Â  It's just oo much of a risk, and not to mention that warging another human being is a violation of that person's personhood (and I think he violates Hodor as well, which is why he doesn't make it apparent to either Meera or Jojen that he's warging Hodor in the CotF's cave in ADWD).
1490	Grail King	2014-04-30	Pretty sure GRRM leaked that Other info to D&D. Probably was all "hey...btw Craster's kids are a thing. Just saiyan."Â 
Â 
Omg.Â How on earth is that a bad thing!Â It shows she isnt a complete moron. Sansa calling LF out on his bullshit was amazing.
Â 
hue!! Love it!
Â 
It kinda did. I saw it as ol' OtherPants over there taking that baby as doing the kid a favor. Bringing the kid to Head Cheese Other and getting Other'd was like "welp, at least he aint gonna get butchered by Rast and co."


Almost fist pump material, but she totally shows what she thinks in the book; lies and arbor gold.
1491	VladimirDulud	2014-04-30	Â 
Seriously, the look of that ice demon Other at the end is a damn shame. I actually laughed out loud. This is as big a fail as screwing up the dragons or dire wolves would have been.
Â 
SMH


Â 
I must needs agree. I also cringed, in shock and disbelief. It looked CGI manufactured, rather than being an organic, make-up fx job with an actor. There is something to be said for not having seen much of the fantasy element in the series, in my mind.

I love R+L=J disbelievers. The two actors who have been given more detailed insight into how the show will play out are Kit and Emilia...and then they started posting fake wedding pics for Jon and Dany....The truth is in the ToJ. Always was, always will be.


Â 
How do Jon and Danaerys "wedding" pictures relate to R+L=J?
Â 
The theory if true means they are biologically aunt and nephew.Â  Incest might be a "Targaryen" thing, but Jon was raised as a Stark and would never consent.

1495	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-30	I like the shots fired across the bow with the Night King reveal.Â  Looks like people planning to stop watching the show when it catches up with the books should consider starting early.Â  This was a pretty big reveal considering the books haven't really explained The Others yet.Â  My guess is Winds of Winter will lay out their back story, and even offer a POV.
Â 
I'm a book reader who remembers the Unsullied television watchers worrying about spoilers.Â  For the first time, the tables have flipped.Â  At this point I'm starting to switch over and now like the show more than the books.Â  At least, my favorite is the first trilogy, then the show, then Feast and Dance.Â  We'll see about Winds when it comes out.


Hooray another optimist! Â 
Â 


They might have their suspicions since i know Emilia (not sure if kit has) read the books...


Kit's read them. I have an interview where he read up to ADWD. But that was from before season 3 aired, so im positive hes caught up by now. If Kit doesnt know or suspect who his character's parents are, id be really shocked.Â

1498	VladimirDulud	2014-04-30	Locke seems to me like an opportunistic and likeable fellow, I see him much like an educated Bronn. He's switched sides once already right? I'd like to see him become an ally to Jon, unfortunately this seems unlikely as there's no motive or gain.


Â 
I'm not quite ensorcelled by Locke, and have a knee-jerk reaction against him - but perhaps this will change in future. If he's written as being as educated as you say, and given some material motivation, then, just maybe, I'll turn.
1499	VladimirDulud	2014-04-30	Â 
Â Olenna is standing at a different table, and would have had to walk a good 10 feet (in front of a guard, no less) to do it. Possible, but not particularly intelligent on her part.
Â 
I guess the show probably changed the timing for the poison to take effect, but the logistics of it irk me.


Â 
And me as well. It would have been splendid to see it happening, however slyly - for those who looked. They were subtle, and not a little.
1500	VladimirDulud	2014-04-30	What if the Others have more benign designs on Westeros?
Â 
That thought crossed my head, though it was briefly scrubbed by the memory of the ravages they have done thus far.

1502	SwiftSwyft	2014-04-30	Did anyone else catch Lady O saying "it was all the rage to marry a Targaryen."
Â 
Which one could she have been talking about? Â
1503	SwiftSwyft	2014-04-30	Could have been Aerys. Would definitely be a reason to avoid marriage.
1504	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-04-30	I amÂ  into the changes being made in character arc from book to show. That being said now that Bran and Jon are on course to connect once they do how could you separate them other than in death. And we must have Stannis arrive at the Wall, and when he does he would find an heir to Winterfell in Bran. It's becoming Helter skelter.Â  Will the Hound and Ayra hook up with LF and Sansa? There will beÂ  omitted story lines in order to bring this to a close in 3-4 years. In depth of story a tv show can not compete with a book. But we are certainly being entertained. I do hope some of the book is omitted, only to give more development into what has already been presented to us. Thinking about the monumental task that is before them in the tv production ,Â  Now Dany, IF if she is one day to land in Westeros I for one would be okay in not seeing her until that day, Maybe the Doom of Valyria Â  could hit her part of the world, again, and cut off communication for the now.
Anyways we shall all enjoy til then.

1505	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-30	Could have been Aerys. Would definitely be a reason to avoid marriage.


Â 
I doubt it was Aerys; he and Rhaelle were married off young to each other (unhappily) due to that "woods witch" prophesy, so there doesn't seem to be much chance of Olenna being betrothed to Aerys.Â 
Â 
But the Targ royal tree is kind of short of other candidates of the right age. Â Jaehaerys was likely too much older than Olenna and already married to a woman of his choosing; plus it would be odd of her to duck out on a marriage to the ruling King just on the grounds that he was Frey-faced. Â The most likely option was Egg's unknown third son, who would be about the right age, except supposedly Egg let all his sons marry for love, and this sounds like it was an arranged marriage.Â 
Â 
So maybe one of the kids of Egg's unknown son was Olenna's disliked Targaryen match, but if so it makes me wonder what happened to that Targ branch. Did they all die off? Or is this just more random lore-creation by the showrunners, like "Orys I"?Â

1510	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-01	I want Hodor to start cracking heads.
1511	briantw	2014-05-01	Hey folks,
The main reason I came here was to get some more feedback/understanding about Locke being at the wall. I think Locke is a redeveloped Hoat, not a Marsh transplant. However, it just occurred to me though, one of the biggest changes from the books to the T.V. series is how Theon and Ramsey meet. In the show, Ramsey wasn't at Winterfell to aid in the murder and cover-up of the Stark boy's "deaths." This would imply that Locke cannot know about Bran or Rickon being alive. So maybe he was sent there by Bolton to make up for Jamie's hand and kill Jon. What I love most about this change is that none of us know for sure, so it's like reading the books :-)
However, all that being said, we're getting robbed of the whole death by ear bite sequence.

Have you been watching the show?  Theon told Ramsay last year that the Stark boys were alive, and there was a scene this season where Theon told Roose at Ramsay's behest.  
Locke was in that same scene, and Roose told him there was land and a holdfast for him if he found the boys and took care of them.  Ramsay also mentioned that taking out Jon as well might be beneficial.
So Locke not only knows that Bran and Rickon are alive, but his exact mission is to make sure that they're not for much longer.
1512	Bear Claw	2014-05-01	I am curious about what will happen to Craster's wives/daughters after the mutineers are taken out?Â  Will they bring them back to Castle Black and then Mole's Town to join Gilly? I can't remember what happened to them in the book.Â  I think Cold Hands cleared out the mutineers, but what happened to the wives?
1513	darksellsword	2014-05-01	I've watched this episode more than ten times now and what was the most pointless and boring scene to me at first viewing is now the most intriguing .
i am talking about the Missandei and greyworm scene at the beginning .It clearly shows us the level of animosity greyworm has for the masters and the blossoming romance between the two. I wonder if in the book and on the show greyworm will become increasingly unhappy with how Danny progresses with her emancipation of the slaves of slavers bay to the point were he comes to see Daenerys as a master and plots to kill her using missandei .it could also tie in with the prophecy that Dany will be betrayed for love.

I really hope not, but then I really wish they hadn't put in the part you liked (not because you like it or it was bad, but because I think it goes against the books). Â Also, it wasted time that could have been used to show more of the actual conquest of Mereen.

So far this season, Jon looks to be using what he learned growing up as the son of the Lord of Winterfell. That is, having the wisdom to read between the muddled lines and see the bigger picture in order to make a good decision. In this episode, Tywin brings Tomman to value wisdom in the first lesson he gave him. Tywin also uses Robert as an example to show the difference between winning and ruling. Jon received the same education as Robb, and Robb gave Tywin all that he could handle until he broke his word to Walder Frey, so Jon's decision making ability may be similar or perhaps better than Robb's. Also, he would have been around when Ned tried to ferret out the truth from those he was Lord over. So Jon has the ability to detect inconsistencies in a story. Â Locke appears to be educated and reveals that he fights like a well trained soldier but tells Jon that he was a gamekeeper. Jon may be suspicious why Locke having these abilities would be used as a gamekeeper when those abilities were valued significantly higher by a Lord.Â

If I were a brother of the nights watch Id be suspicious of every person that joined . They are mostly rapists and murdering thieves . i don't know why people would expect Jon to be suspicious of Lockes story in particular . He would never suspect that Locke had any ulterior motives .I would imagine its not uncommon for recruits to make up bullshit stories of why they ended up at the wall. If Jon suspected lockes story was bs he would just take it that Locke was a deserter from the war.

I believe that the writers have spent 3 1/2 seasons telling Jon's story and we haven't seen too much of what makes Jon a focal part of this whole saga. Really, other than he can fight better than most recruits, had a direwolf and got to know about wildlings, what has he done to make the viewer believe that he has any leadership ability. The writers look to be inventing a storyline that can reveal to the audience that Jon has the ability to be a leader. One way to so it is for him to ferret out Locke's motive for being (1) at the Wall and (2) joining up to go to Craster's. Â
1518	Dany's Silver	2014-05-01	I think Jon and Ghost reuniting will be key in Jon sussing out Locke's untrustworthy character.Â  None of the direwolves has ever shied away from indicating that someone is a threat, and Ghost is going to see right through Locke's bullshit story.
1519	Laniki	2014-05-01	Book Jon holds off the wildling attack of Castle Black prior to Thorne and Slynt's arrival. This is a significant key as to why Jon was elevated in status with many of his brothers, as he took command of a skeleton force of mostly untrained men against overwhelming odds and was victorious. In the series, Thorne and Slynt are at Castle Black prior to the wildling invasion, removing from the viewer Jon's ability to strategically command. Throughout HBO's writing of Jon's character, they seem to erode Jon's abilities and have made him not much more of a character than Dolorous Edd. Sam Tarly could be thought to have a better understanding of leadership than series Jon.Â 
Â 
Early in the episode Tywin is beginning to train Tomman for leadership. Later in the episode Littlefinger is training Sansa to think in strategic terms. In season 2, Luwin was training Bran about Houses, their words, sigils and alliances. The viewers need to see that Jon can think strategically, and has leadership abilities on a larger scale than skirmishes or when what comes later in the books, viewers will wonder what/who is this Jon Snow.

Well, Jon was given the command by Donal Noye (when he went to defend the gate against Mag the Mighty), so he didn't just take command. His brothers saw that their current acting commander had faith in him.

Â Book Jon's arc, from the beginning Arya chapter in AGoT where she looks at his face after the confrontation in the courtyard between Joff and Robb, Jon reveals the inner strength that is shared between all the living Stark kids.

Oh yea and he might have his brother Summer to help out as well.
1523	chris_warrior	2014-05-01	I'm only halfway through the comments and already kind of disturbed that people who had a problem with the rape scene at Craster's are getting a lot of hate. One commenter on winteriscoming.com said something like "Oh, the feminists are not gonna like that rape scene". WTF? What on earth does one have to do with the other? Â People who feel the show is too insensitive on the subject are told to go read Harry Potter and stop watching. Again, WTF? Is that what came out of the crypt scene last week? Are there no limits just because "it happened in the books"? In the books, children are raped and mutilated - should we get that onscreen as well? Had Rorge done to Arya what he said he'd do, should we have seen this in close-up?
Â 
Nobody argues that the show should not show rape or sex - but it has to serve a purpose to show it, it should be narratologically necessary. If it's not, it's showing rape for the sake of rape, which is problematic. The scene at Craster's was stylising rape in a very uncomfortable way, showing it like this served no purpose. I like that the show doesn't shy away from nudity - but it's getting to a point where it's becoming ridiculous. I sometimes feel that HBO is a teenager testing its limits â<U+0080><U+0093> which at least for people used to European TV and cinema seems infantile and pathetic - a lame attempt at provocation.

I kind of agree, butÂ In the books he have the benefit of his inner monolgues.
Â 
Strength? In the Show were shown from the first episode that he very much cares for his family which is a strong part of him. he defends his fellow recruits like Sam from Alliser thus gaining some to his side(like the books) Jon also attempts to ditch the NW to fight in his family's war. He also infiltrates the Wildlings for the NW, falls in love, then abandons her.
Â 
What do you mean about his ability to lead men? He's made squire to the LC in the 1st season so he can be Â groomed to lead someday. If thatÂ isn'tÂ foreshadowing for the viewers IÂ don'tÂ know what is...
1525	chris_warrior	2014-05-01	as far as what's likely to happen, if Jon and Bran don't conveniently miss each other at Craster's, i'm not sure how Bran getting north plays out with anything like the tenor of the books. and it may be that it won't, but it would be disappointing. i suspect something may happen to make Jon think Bran and Rickon are dead after all. Ghost should make it, since he's alive in the books, and they can't be that hard up to trim their CGI budget. i hope Bran wargs _someone_ to get them out of this; i half-hoped he'd warg Rast or the one drinking out of Mormont's skull; in that moment, i wanted *someone* to get stabbed.

as far as things i liked about the ep, Brienne and Jaime and Pod are at the top of that list. only section i rewatched.

The theory if true means they are biologically aunt and nephew.Â  Incest might be a "Targaryen" thing, but Jon was raised as a Stark and would never consent.

It's not like I'm saying the show makes Jon out to be totally lackluster. Yes ,he has made friends and defended them from Thorne's taunts, was made Mormont's steward and defended him against the weights, and infiltrated the wildlings. These are acknowledgments. What I'm questioning is now that HBO has Thorne and Slynt at Castle Black, how is it that Jon will be in charge during the Wildling attack? So far, unlike the books, Jon's sisters don't think back and adopt his traits that helped him cope at Winterfell. Arya remembers Jon's kindness, Sansa thinks of how Jon was when she plays Alayne. We are now at the point in the books where Jon separates himself with his knowledge, courage and general ability from others at the Wall. It's sad to see that the script writers have written in Thorne and Slynt's arrival there before the battle that distinguishes Jon.

Â 
Well, they've set up several things for that:
Â 
1. He'll be leading an attack on Craster's Keep.
Â 
2. We've seen that Thorne and Slint don't trust him and aren't listening to his advice (unless they have their own motives behind it). Â I have a feeling that will come up when the Wildlings attack.
Â 
3. He's well-liked. Â The rules of the choosing don't require that someone have experience...they just require one person win a popularity contest. Â Probably not the best way to do it, but that's how it is. Â Snow just has to be more popular than the others in the running, and we know that he is.

HBO hasn't made Jon impotent...they've just changed his story around a little bit. Â But it's no less believable.
1529	darksellsword	2014-05-01	It's not like I'm saying the show makes Jon out to be totally lackluster. Yes ,he has made friends and defended them from Thorne's taunts, was made Mormont's steward and defended him against the weights, and infiltrated the wildlings. These are acknowledgments. What I'm questioning is now that HBO has Thorne and Slynt at Castle Black, how is it that Jon will be in charge during the Wildling attack? So far, unlike the books, Jon's sisters don't think back and adopt his traits that helped him cope at Winterfell. Arya remembers Jon's kindness, Sansa thinks of how Jon was when she plays Alayne. We are now at the point in the books where Jon separates himself with his knowledge, courage and general ability from others at the Wall. It's sad to see that the script writers have written in Thorne and Slynt's arrival there before the battle that distinguishes Jon.


That's a really interesting point. I felt that because they showed so much of Robb's campaign and how adept he was as a war commander that the writers might have decided that showing Jon in a similar fashion might be too much for the viewers to accept that there were these two boys raised together as brothers that both discover themselves as military commanders that's not to say that they will never do so but they could be delaying this development. Jon has proven himself with the infiltration of the wildlings and his scout report. He was the only one that thought strategically about how the mutineers might reveal to Mance that the wall is only manned by a small force. I have heard people rubbishing this idea that Mance would believe Jon's claim that there were a 1000 men at castle black alone, but from Mance Rayder's point of view he doesn't know how indifferent most of westeros are to the Wytes and to the threat of the wildling invasion for all he knows Â the troops could be pouring in to guard the wall at the very least it would be cause for concern and extra preparation.

ah, i see...
Â 
I agree about alliser and Thorne. I'm pretty sure they'll make Jon out to be the hero somehow and will be made LC some time after that.
Â 
They could've handled the Arya/Jon relationship better, oh well. I don't think anyone has forgotten it. Sansa hardly every thinks about him and maybe when she becomes Alayne they'll connect the two. They better Jon plays a big part to the Alayne identity
1531	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-01	I think Jon and Ghost reuniting will be key in Jon sussing out Locke's untrustworthy character.Â  None of the direwolves has ever shied away from indicating that someone is a threat, and Ghost is going to see right through Locke's bullshit story. 


Yeah that would be pretty neato! And it would add some impact on Ghost's reaction to Mel when she shows up.
Â 
Nobody argues that the show should not show rape or sex - but it has to serve a purpose to show it, it should be narratologically necessary. If it's not, it's showing rape for the sake of rape, which is problematic. The scene at Craster's was stylising rape in a very uncomfortable way, showing it like this served no purpose. I like that the show doesn't shy away from nudity - but it's getting to a point where it's becoming ridiculous. I sometimes feel that HBO is a teenager testing its limits â<U+0080><U+0093> which at least for people used to European TV and cinema seems infantile and pathetic - a lame attempt at provocation.

The thing is, i strongly disagree that the grisly scenes in the background (including the rape) serves no purpose. I have a hard time seeing how anyone could feel any sense of titillation by seeing that. Im pretty sure theres no real "male gaze" going on here considering the image its trying to paint for the viewer. Its there to showcase and underscore the sheer depravity of whats going on at Craster's Keep right now. That, put with Karl being absolutely filthy, and the reddish hellish lighting, and those pigs making noise....thats putting us right into how horrific that whole situation is. Showing us how things areÂ worseÂ with Craster gone rather than better.Â 
Â 
It also serves as a part of the contrast of what we see following the Craster's sequences. I think ive explained this a dozen times in the last couple of days. Michelle McLaren was trying to illustrate something the books are constantly reminding us: Things arent always what they seem. There's often two sides to every story. By showing us the absolute depravity of the Keep and then following it with the cold, orderly quiet of the Others, it makes us ponder the Others and ponder how far man can fall. That a baby being taken by an unknowable monster may be preferable to remaining in Craster's Keep. Its there to have us second guess.Â 
Â 
I give Michelle McLaren a hats-off for grossing me out to the point where i made this observation. Because if this wasnt her intent, ill eat my bloody hat!Â

I think it's very likely that Jon will manage to show his abilities off during the upcoming attack on Castle Black.  Alliser and Janos's presence can actually be used to accentuate them.  Due to how the battle's been changed, there will be simultaneous fighting on multiple fronts -- both defending Castle Black from the raiders and holding the Wall against  Mance's army -- and I think it's very likely that Jon will end up as the sort of defacto leader in one of these engagements.  He can distinguish himself there and, because of the sort of people that Alliser and Janos are, it'll have a profound impact on how his brothers view him.
1533	rmholt	2014-05-01	One thing that bothers me is the long trek Bran made to the Nightfort - one reason given was it was deserted - but book Jojen clearly picked it. It was clearer in the books why they and Sam with Coldhands went all the way there. Why they did so in the show is much less clear. I definitely got the impression they went a lot further north and definitely stayed East of the Milkwater and other main drags. In the show they dragged both Sam - on his own - all the way to the Nightfort without  clear reason that I recall.  Did the show establish that all the abandoned forts have closed gates? The Nightfort was special in the books. Aside from the tale of the Rat King - nicely placed after the RW - I don't see how the show supports choosing the Nightfort. It seems to take everyone out of the way for no reason. CH took Sam there and Jojen took Bran there and no one told Jon. This made the Jon-Ghost-Summer-weirwood- Bran telegram so intriguing. Now I can't figure how the Bran crew gets all the way south to Crasters, right in the North version of Grand Central Station, so close to The Wall instead of untracked territory, when they could have gotten there a lot quicker via a more Western gate. In the book the went to the Nightfort for a reason. The show doesn't really have those reasons. They could have put the Black Gate anywhere. Unless BR is in a cave below Crasters I don't get it. They might actually need a guide now otherwise, because Jojen doesn't seem to be doing the job and Summer can't even foresee a wolftrap. So they might bring Coldhands on after all.

In the show Sam says they are going to the NIghtfort because there is a gate they can get through, and he knows this cause he read it in a book. It's where Gilly calls him a wizard.

Sorry to ramble. In the books Nightfort is clearly important. In the show it seems the could have put the Black Gate anywhere.
1536	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-01	Have you been watching the show? Theon told Ramsay last year that the Stark boys were alive, and there was a scene this season where Theon told Roose at Ramsay's behest.
Locke was in that same scene, and Roose told him there was land and a holdfast for him if he found the boys and took care of them. Ramsay also mentioned that taking out Jon as well might be beneficial.
So Locke not only knows that Bran and Rickon are alive, but his exact mission is to make sure that they're not for much longer.


Â 
Yeah I finally got around to re-watching the episode and without anyone else watching and I caught that pretty quickly. Locke/Hoat is going for the double assassination.Â

Â 
The three-headed dragon is probably a single Targaryen with three heads (Jon-Ghost-a dragon) similar to Varamyr Sixskins (Varamyr-3 wolves-shadowcat-snowbear).
Â 
The clues point that Dany will die at the Wall/North from childbirth and Tyrion is already infected with greyscale, which will drive him to choose the time of his death, which might be a heroic sacrifice.
1542	darksellsword	2014-05-02	There were 163 people crucified in the first 10 mins and there wasn't any sign of outrage from the viewers about it.

I prefer to put my fingers in my ears and close my eyes and say, "Lalalalala, I can't hear you!" re: Tyrion.  Of course, I know that GRRM isn't setting us for a happy ending (but I think your theory of Jon as the dragon!), but I prefer to think that Tyrion will be cured ("ice preserves" as Maester Aemon says), and perhaps he won't be the Hand, he'll be the LC if the NW, after Jon's "death" releases him from his vows.

Have you read the twitter recap done by WiC.net? People was like "fuck yeah! Khaleesi justice!". I lol'ed.
1546	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-02	Geez guys,
Â 
Rape is bad and all, but you're acting like a bunch of tweensies who've never even had sex before.Â 
Â 
You are comfortable with gore, but any sign of rape makes you so sexually uncomfortable. Its actually sad how much of a fuss you make about it. If your kids were watching GoT and you were uncomfortable with them seeing it, that would be understandable.
Â 
But at least a good portion of you are grown men and women. There will be rape in this show. A lot of it. You knew this coming into it. You are blowing it so far out of the water. Rape is bad. We know. We're glad you think so too.Â 
Â 
Jaime did not "rape" Cersei. No, it wasn't Bella and Edward sparkles flying everywhere sex, but she was consenting.Â 
Â 
The Craster's scene was dumb, and most of the Wall stuff is pretty dumb right now. Maybe it would be better if the show just ignored the plight of women in general and kept everything on a man basis. No, not man raping man. Man fighting man. Because you can deal with that.
Â 


Â 
I partially agree with you about that. And I commented to my friend about that. The show portrays how medieval times were meant to be for women and the reality is that many of them were easy preys of raping every day, specially to bandits and men like those who are sent to the wall. Also, they were property and had few rights (or none). The show portraying it is not different from showing violence, gore and all the political backstabbing that those times were thought to be and it's portrayed in a completely negative light. The show isn't promoting violence, nor raping. Cases of rape haven't increased due to Game of Thrones or anything like it. If anything, serves to put in perspective how women have advanced through times.
1547	darksellsword	2014-05-02	It happened in the book and fit with the story/character. Anyway it was 326.


In the show it was 163, as far as fitting with the story/character its all subjective, who is to say the horrific scenes Grrm

one complained about a gratuitous amount of crucifixions.

How many slave children did the Meereenese crucify? Add to the 163 Dany crucified. Both were shown. Math is hard. Reading is fun.

OK...
Â 
1) Jon's a Night's Watch member. He will not be absolved of his duties should he be Lyanna and Rhaegar's son. edit : do we know for sure Lyanna was pregnant with Rhaegar ? There are several theories on Jon's mother...
Â 
2) Even If so, unless Lyanna and Rhaegar were married, he's a illegitimate son and heir to... nothing in particular.
Â 
3) Robb contemplated making Jon his heir. I still think Jon's fate is tied to Winterfell/North, not the Iron Throne.
Â 
4) His last chapter in ADWD , he was getting stabbed repeatedly...it remains to be seen how and if he gets out of that one. Warging into Ghost isn't much good if you don't have a body to get back to.
Â 
5) Remember Ned's prayer in ADWD about the "two growing up as brothers and his lady wife forgiving him". That, along with the fact his wolf is also related to the other direwolfs, makes me think Ned is the father.Â

Ned's regret could mean anything.

Â 


3) Robb contemplated making Jon his heir. I still think Jon's fate is tied to Winterfell/North, not the Iron Throne.


Â 
Robb thought that all his siblings except Sansa were dead. Besides, Jon is not a Snow. He cannot legitimize Jon. Jon has a lot of foreshadowing to be the king.
Â 


4) His last chapter in ADWD , he was getting stabbed repeatedly...it remains to be seen how and if he gets out of that one. Warging into Ghost isn't much good if you don't have a body to get back to.


Â 
GRRM said Jon is not dead. That means he is wounded and alive, most likely in a coma similar to Bran in AGoT.
Â

Â 
I don't think this necessarily implies Ned is the father. Bran also saw Lyanna after this vision, which hints that Lyanna is the mother of Jon. Ghost is different than the other wolves in many ways. He is an outsider.
Â 


6) Only in the last published book, ADWD, we got Aemon introduced. You really think anyone else with as much as a speck of Targ blood is coming forward in the final books ?


Â 
I thing that is Aegon you are referring to. Jon is already with us right from the beginning. He is a trueborn prince and king as foreshadowed in AGoT.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Why arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you down in the yard?â<U+0080><U+009D> Arya asked him.
He gave her a half smile. â<U+0080><U+009C>Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said. â<U+0080><U+009C>Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Since we know that Joffrey is the bastard here, this makes Jon the young prince.
Â 

â<U+0080><U+009C>Kings are a rare sight in the north.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Robert snorted. â<U+0080><U+009C>More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!â<U+0080><U+009D> The king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended.
Â 
King Jon is hiding under the Snow (identity). Also note that the king puts one hand to the wall. This symbolizes Jon going to the Wall.

Â 
I can't seem to use multiqote right so I will respond in bold letters and underline for better visibility from your text... Viserys was taken to Dragonstone and later on to the East. 3 KG are protecting Lyanna. Sending the future king away makes more sense than locking him up in Â a tower with mere 3 guards. Â Another heir candidate was saved by Varys. (if Aegon is real)
Â 
Robb thought that all his siblings except Sansa were dead. Besides, Jon is not a Snow. He cannot legitimize Jon. Jon has a lot of foreshadowing to be the king.
Â 
Robb, as the King of the North, could have legitimized Jon with his will. Maybe he did ? And even if he didn't, that still leaves Jon's Winterfell heirloom on the table. Jon said no to Stannis but I don't think he'd throw away Robb's final wishes so lightly.
Â 
GRRM said Jon is not dead. That means he is wounded and alive, most likely in a coma similar to Bran in AGoT.
Â 
Spoilers suck, to say the least.
Â 
I don't think this necessarily implies Ned is the father. Bran also saw Lyanna after this vision, which hints that Lyanna is the mother of Jon. Ghost is different than the other wolves in many ways. He is an outsider.
Â 
That's the way I read it. We have yet to find out exactly what the promise was. Was the final witness alive, Howlad Reed, told ?
Ghost is the outsider, yet related to the other wolves. If Jon is from the same "pack" yet different analogically, it can only be done if Ned is his father since Catelyn is not the mother.
Â 
I thing that is Aegon you are referring to. Jon is already with us right from the beginning. He is a trueborn prince and king as foreshadowed in AGoT.
Â 
True...my mystake, I meant Aegon. Jon is with us but not one line in the books so far said he is a Targ. If memory serves, prominent illegitimate sons in the story tend to look like spitting images of their fathers ; ie Gendry, Edric Storm...not only is Jon nothing like Rhaegar, he doesn't even look like a Targ unlike the ones we met in the books so far.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Why arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you down in the yard?â<U+0080><U+009D> Arya asked him.

Â 
Since we know that Joffrey is the bastard here, this makes Jon the young prince.
Â 

â<U+0080><U+009C>Kings are a rare sight in the north.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Robert snorted. â<U+0080><U+009C>More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!â<U+0080><U+009D> The king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended.
Â 
King Jon is hiding under the Snow (identity). Also note that the king puts one hand to the wall. This symbolizes Jon going to the Wall.

Â 
I don't follow... the scene with Robb and Joffrey wooden swords ? Why would Jon be allowed to duel with Joffrey ? He is clearly referring to himself in answering Arya (I doubt he's taking a jab at Joffrey, let alone that he knows).
Yes...a drinking, obese King steadies his descent on the Wall. I don't think it's a symbol of anything.

1561	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2014-05-03	That was a great episode, one of the best so far.Â  The ending was incredibly well done, so suspenseful and thought-provoking.Â  The Margaery-Tommen scene was legendary.Â  I think there's no male on here that can't relate to poor Tommen!
Â 
The Littlefinger-Sansa scene was great.Â  Littlefinger gave Sansa 2 reasons for killing Joffrey - to be unpredicable to confuse his opponents; and to get rid of a crazy unreliable ally.
Â 
But I am sure there was a 3rd and very important reason that he didn't tell - to kill Tyrion and make Sansa single again.Â  He knew Tyrion would get blamed (especially with Sansa missing).Â  Even though Littlefinger says he wants everything, what he really wants is Sansa-Cat.Â  That is his prime motivation and his fatal flaw.Â  I wonder if Sansa can figure that out.
Â 
Remember Littlefinger was ready to die for love when he challenged Brandon Stark.Â  That type of passion does not fade.
Â 
Great effing show!!!Â  Love it!!!Â
1562	Dany's Silver	2014-05-03	If Jon was illegitimate, then 3 KG would not protect him at ToJ instead of the rightful king Viserys III in Dragonstone.
Â 
Robb thought that all his siblings except Sansa were dead. Besides, Jon is not a Snow. He cannot legitimize Jon. Jon has a lot of foreshadowing to be the king.
Â 
GRRM said Jon is not dead. That means he is wounded and alive, most likely in a coma similar to Bran in AGoT.
Â 
I don't think this necessarily implies Ned is the father. Bran also saw Lyanna after this vision, which hints that Lyanna is the mother of Jon. Ghost is different than the other wolves in many ways. He is an outsider.
Â 
I thing that is Aegon you are referring to. Jon is already with us right from the beginning. He is a trueborn prince and king as foreshadowed in AGoT.

Â 
Bingo!Â 
I do, however, think that while Jon doesn't remain dead, he will die in order to be released from his vows to the NW (making it possible for him to take on the role of The Prince Who Was Promised).
That's some awesome foreshadowing you pointed out. 
Â 

We're basing events in WoW and book 7 based on a prequel story ?

Â 
I provided that bit because you seemed to have a problem with the wedding photos of Jon & Dany.Â  I also wanted to point out that GRRM has recently confirmed that Targaryens not only wed brother to sister, but other relations married one another as well.Â  These prequels are not standalone stories.Â  They do serve a purpose in the larger ASOIAF.Â  The Mystery Knight allowed readers to meet Bloodraven (not simply have him referred to having a thousand and eyes and one by Dunk), prior to us meeting him in ADWD.Â  The timing of these prequels is significant.Â  I suspect that GRRM's upcoming novella in Rogues will provide further backstory that is also possibly related to TWOW.

Â 
This is an argument disproved with one name: Barristan.
Â 
The fact that the famous for his honor and nobility Barristan Selmy didn't go running off to serve Viserys means the KG are human and fallible.Â  Their presence at the Tower isn't them doing their duty, it was them failing their duty. Probably under orders from Rhaeghar, but the king, the crown prince, the king's grandson, and grand daughter all died when the guarded the prince's mistress.Â  Considering the weakness of communications, they probably thought it likely Viserys was dead or captured as well.Â  When Eddard showed up with a small force, they almost asked to be killed in combat, an "honorable death."

Â 
Barristan was severely wounded after the Battle of Trident. I think the ToJ was regularly and secretly getting help from Starfall. Surely they were getting the news as well. They stayed quite a long time in ToJ.Â 3 KG, a dying woman and a baby alone do not give us a meaningful picture. The must have squires, serving people, a wetnurse (Wylla) for provisions and so on.Â

If he's in a coma and wakes up, he's still a Night's Watch guy. He will be until the Others invade the Wall. Â 
Â 
Jon being APTWP is flying in the face of Aemon saying interpreters were wrong and Daenerys is the one, proved by the dragons. AndÂ the woods witchÂ who prophesied that the PTWPÂ would be born from the line of Aerys and RhaellaÂ (ie Rhaegar, Viserys or Daenerys). 
Jon being heir to the Throne (if R+L = J and if they were married) is second to Aegon, who just showed up in ADWD. It also undermines the whole saga of Daenerys learning to rule across the books so far.Â 
Â 
I don't think actors posting photos matter much. I don't really care what prequels say. WoW and the seventh book will reveal all.
Â 
I think Ned's debate with Kingsguard with TOJ is interesting. KG members aren't at the Trident with the Prince, three others are. They're not in KL with their King. And they're not with the heir, Viserys. I'm thinking Viserys and Daenerys were sent overseas but Aegon was at TOJ, as he was taken out of KL.(remember "Aegon" at KL is mutilated and they can't see his face) Take the King's children to safety, and take out the Prince's child and help Targaryens dinasty to survive. Well played by Varys.

You have to take into account that a lot of people on this site believe Aegon is not a legitimate Targ, in which case he would obviously not have priority over Jon. Once the evidence is given to you, as with R+L=J, it becomes pretty hard to dispute. Aegon being fake also makes R+L=J more meaningful in the sense that Jon would actually be the heir, not Aegon.Â 
Â 
On another note I think your being a little short sighted by saying you don't care what the prequels say. As others have pointed out, they are in the same universe and often give us new information that could impact the series.Â

1582	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-05-03	For me I am taking the show as something separate from the books at this point. Remember the books were initially a trilogy, to have an Aegon appear in the fifth book and to weave a plot around "him" strikes me as grasping for plot. At this point with all the new characters that could befall the tv show there is no way to bring all the supposed story lines together. The Tower of Joy, sorry but it could easily be omitted from the tv show. I hope the tv show does not go the way of the later books. I prefer to see plot development with story to climax.

But the middle book of the original planned trilogy was going to be "A Dance With Dragons" anyway, which implies that Aegon was always planned to be in the story, but he was going to show up in the second book, not the fifth. I suppose there are other meanings you could put on "A Dance with Dragons", but the original Dance (in the series history) was a dispute between two Targaryens, so it makes sense that the new one would be the same.Â 
Â 
You have to admit, people would think differently of Aegon if he'd showed up in the middle book of a trilogy.Â

Yea I definitely agree with you. I'm always surprised at how many people consider Aegon to be unimportant simply because he arrived late in the story. There's a very real possibility he ends up sitting the IT, so I don't really see how he could be considered unimportant.Â

Thats kind of my point , the author is not tying up the story. And we have all heard about many other Dragons. Dany , Jon, even Tyrion, that could of and would of danced

Â 
I think that in order for it to count as a "Dance of Dragons", you need two people who actually claim to be Dragons, which would be Daenerys and Aegon. Â Jon is almost certainly a Dragon but not known to be, even by himself, and Tyrion is almost certainly not a Dragon, nor does anyone in the books think he is.Â 
Â 
If Jon and Dany "Danced" it would be "Wolf and Dragon Tango", and if Tyrion and Dany "Danced" it would be "Lion and Dragon Samba". Â 
Â 
It's only a Dance of Dragons if it's Dany and Aegon.
1590	rmholt	2014-05-04	Apparently it can just be dragons without riders. And to point out the obvious, Jon is likely half dragon, whether he knows it or not,

Â 
I've been to my share of wedding.Â  I've never drunk out of somebody else's glass.
Â 
In the book, Mace Tyrell gifts the wedding couple a huge and ornate goblet.Â  Hence, the married couple took turns drinking out of it.Â  For the show, they each had their own cups and there was no reason to believe they would be sharing.Â  I'm sure Olenna was keeping a close eye on the goblet to make sure no "accidents" occurred once she slipped in the poison.Â
1594	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Just rewatched the Tommen/Margaery scene in a rebroadcast of last week's episode.Â  Noticed that, when Marge asks him "you know what happens" w.r.t. marriage, Tommen's immediate -- and eager -- response is "we say our vows in front of the high septon, and..."
Â 
His first guess as to what makes a good king in Ep 3 was "holiness."
Â 
Book Tommen was naive due to his age.Â  Show Tommen is older, too old to have that simple naivete of youth.Â  I wonder if they're going to compensate for that by playing up the pious angle to explain why he's a little naive:Â  sheltered, buried in religious texts, unworldly due to being so focused on the divine (and genuinely interested in being a godly king).
Â 
REALLY interesting angle if they keep up with that later on, when the new High Septon/the Faith Militant becomes a factor.Â  Maybe it'll be [partly] Tommen's own idea, rooted in sincere religious leanings.
Â 
EDIT:Â  kinda hoping he makes a religious statement during his coronation in tonight's episode, some sort of shout-out to Baelor The Blessed as a role model, setting the tone for his (intended) pious reign.

It is a possibility that Tommen is some sort of Baelor the Blessed reborn or something but I doubt it, because in the scene with Tywin you can see clearly how he is very influenced by him and I cannot imagine Tywin letting the future king be another pious idiot like Lancel becomes in the books.Â 
Â 
Though it makes sense because second sons were usually prepared to do career in religion I don't think Tywin would let him go the pious way

In the books the Starks have been separated so long and it doesn't make much sense to me, thematically at least, to have them get together. Would Jon really let him continue on, which we know that he'd have to? That aside, terrific episode.
1600	Q the Cat	2014-04-27	Early in the episode, Sam said something to Jon about Bran. Â I yelled, "WTF?! Â Sam made a promise in the book not to tell anyone that Bran was still alive." Â  Now I'm worried about how this will change everything in the North. Â All of the battles, etc - including Roose's claim to the North is that all of the Starks are dead.
1601	iheartseverus	2014-04-27	I loved it--totally loved it.Â  Bran at Craster's, Ghost locked up, Summer in a trap, and that mind-blowing reveal at the end.Â  The White Walker Boss Guy.Â  WTF??Â  Loved it, every minute of it.

1602	Darth Pipes	2014-04-27	Yeah, I'm usually have problems when they go "into business for themselves" but I thought a lot of the changes worked out great tonight.
1603	Talbot	2014-04-27	It was a really good episode.
Â 
What I will always fail to understand is why certain people believe deviations from the novel lessen the quality of the show.
Â 
A. The books aren't perfect
B. They are separate entities
C. Some of this stuff is really, really cool
1604	Justin Danford	2014-04-27	I'm not pleased with the fact that it seems the TV show just spoiled the unreleased book. With Martins comments about going deeper into the North than we ever have before in TWOW, I imagine we find out where Crasters sons go, or what happens to them...welp, now I already know.Â 
Â 
The show is good. The books are better. If that is a spoler I may have to stop watching the show. I love the show but I can't have an altered adapation ruin a story that's been in the making for twenty years.

1605	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-27	Really? I get more frustrated each episode. Everything is wrong. Some things get us to the same point & have to be changed to film & I get that but...Gilly in Mole's Town? The Wildlings are insane. Jon knows Bran is alive & is going to Crasters? Bran is at Crasters? The whole thing is a mess. 
One of my favorite things about the books is that things are not always fair. Good people die & it isn't fair. The characters are not purely good or evil (save a few) & for me the show is ruining that. 
The whole reason Jon Snow thinks its possible to make good with the wildlings is BECAUSE he realizes they are just people. Some are good, some are bad. The show has painted them all as some savage lunatics I suppose in an attempt for us to root for their deaths? 
NO WAY those chumps at Crasters could've captured ghost. 
I'm just afraid they are going to change the whole story line. Are the show & the books going to end up in the same place? If not it will be very disappointing for me. I'm glad you all enjoyed the episode but for me its just moving too far away from the books.
1606	HouseHarrison	2014-04-27	Bran at Crasters is a good arc that I don't mind but goddamnit that Others spoiler.
1607	Ser Redjed	2014-04-27	I also love these books but find these changes, in light of this medium, quite well errmm... titillating.
Â Â 
Cheers to Cogman on job well done indeed!

Â 
I quoted this because it needs to be seen. I love the books and would hate the show to overpass the books but sometimes purists get carried away with there neediness.
Â 
Inb4 insuing butthurt
1609	ohpooratlas	2014-04-27	There are good and bad wildlings in the show as well. That hasn't really changed. Now we've just been introduced to the "really bad" wildlings.
Â 
But anyway. It was weird to be sitting on the edge of the couch having no idea what was going to go down (even though you know, deep down, that Bran and co. will be fine.)
Â 
And I definitely think we might have just had a glimpse of the Land of Always Winter. Was that the Heart of Winter too? I have no idea.
1610	Bimmerella	2014-04-27	Sooooo.......who, what the hell was that thing, and what did he do to the baby??  Obviously he is a maker of white walkers, but WHO is he? What is he? Did you notice how he was dressed?? 
Wow.....this episode was awesome!! They arent going by the book for sure on many arcs, but I gotta say, I dont mind! Its damned fine storytelling, visually beautiful, and fun not knowing exactly what is gonna happen.  
I've also heard a ton of hype on some alleged very disturbing scene that was possibly on tonight? Maybe the rape fest and drinking from Mormont's skull going on at Crasters? 
I personally would like to see Bran and Jon meet.  Would definitely help expose us and the charachters to more of the magical elements, and maybe help Jon make better decisions at the wall.  At some point the arcs are going to have to start acknowledging the magical elements that are showing up. Guess I have to wait til next week to see about the Jon - Bran meeting.  :-(
Loved this episode though!!!
1611	iheartseverus	2014-04-27	Bran at Crasters is a good arc that I don't mind but goddamnit that Others spoiler.


I think we've all known for some time now that the show is going to pass the books, its just a fact.Â  Its sort of mind-tangling that now we old time bookwalkers will be getting 'spoiled' watching the show, as opposed to all the previous years of show-only viewers getting spoiled by bookwalkers.Â  Personally, I'm thrilled to my very core.Â  Love being unspoiled, on the edge of my chair, no clue what's going to happen next.Â  It's exciting!!Â  And it won't interfere one whit with me getting the next book(s) the very second they come out.Â  Two different things.Â  Love them both.Â  Tonight was... exciting!!
1612	Hutch	2014-04-27	I didn't dislike the episode, but after every week I start to feel more and more like a book snob. I don't like that feeling since almost everyone I know are show only, so I just hope the payoff works out well enough with the story. Here's to hoping.
1613	of man and wolf	2014-04-27	Really? I get more frustrated each episode. Everything is wrong.

Yup, the only thing I kinda have an issue with is how those chumps managed to capture a beast like Ghost. He'd either rip them all apart or easily outrun them. I dont even think that cage could hold him.
1614	Fragile Bird	2014-04-27	It's a good thing that HBO runs the episode twice.Â  The first time I watch it, I get shocked by the changes they make and I have to remind myself "the books are not the television series, the television series is not the books".Â  By the second viewing I've calmed down and can decide what I like and don't like.
Â 
I don't like Sam breaking his promise to Bran and telling Jon about running into him.Â  That changes so very much - D&D are fond of saying that the path of the tv show may wander away from the path of the books but they end up in the same place.Â  Hard to imagine that can happen now.
Â 
And Bran getting captured.Â  And the direwolves.Â  Ok, they didn't want to have Cold Hands, they didn't want to show how long the journey was, it was too tedious to show in the series.
Â 
<<<<the books =/=the series>>>
1615	Frey family reunion	2014-04-27	I think we've all known for some time now that the show is going to pass the books, its just a fact.Â  Its sort of mind-tangling that now we old time bookwalkers will be getting 'spoiled' watching the show, as opposed to all the previous years of show-only viewers getting spoiled by bookwalkers.Â  Personally, I'm thrilled to my very core.Â  Love being unspoiled, on the edge of my chair, no clue what's going to happen next.Â  It's exciting!!Â  And it won't interfere one whit with me getting the next book(s) the very second they come out.Â  Two different things.Â  Love them both.Â  Tonight was... exciting!!I think it's more likely that we're going to find that the HBO show and the books are starting to tell two different stories using the same characters and settings. (It's my understanding from my wife that this happened with the show True Blood, the show and the books became substantially different as the series went along.GRRM knows the series will probably end before the books, I doubt that he is going to have the series ruin surprises he has in store for us in the books.
1616	of man and wolf	2014-04-27	Maybe if Jon does meet up with Bran and co, they'll even teach Jon how to use his powers of warging that so far he hasn't even touched. Just a thought.
1617	shiola	2014-04-27	It was a really good episode.
Â 
What I will always fail to understand is why certain people believe deviations from the novel lessen the quality of the show.

Â 


Â 
Pray tell, how do you know, before the arc is even done, that everything is a mess? Â What insight do you have to D&D's plans that we don't have? Â They might not go in the direction of the book with future plotlines, shocking as that may seem. Â They have their own agenda.
1619	SerJorahMormont	2014-04-27	it was a pretty good episode, especially after last week's shitstorm.Â  i'm just teetering on the edge of my seat waiting for coldhands though!
1620	Lord Damian	2014-04-27	It is what it is. I am excited to see it. It will probably be the only others spoiler/scene we will see this season but it was really cool. Pun intended.
Also, drinking from Mormont's skull made me sad and angry.
1621	Kasrith	2014-04-27	I'm just afraid they are going to change the whole story line. Are the show & the books going to end up in the same place? If not it will be very disappointing for me. I'm glad you all enjoyed the episode but for me its just moving too far away from the books.


Â 
Nothing to be afraid of since they are two separate story lines and you can enjoy them both.
1622	Bolton's Bastard	2014-04-27	What does Unlist mean?
1623	Big Daddy	2014-04-27	Wow! Goddamn that was good!
Â 
I'm all for the books first, and they are far better than the show, but sometimes the changes just work. I loved the peak at the end of the Others. Is it spoiling us? Maybe, but we've had 5 books to give us something and because of the POV format, we can't see it. I don't know, it just felt right to me.
Â 
I'm not sold yet on Jon knowing that Bran is still alive (and by default, Rickon too). To be honest, in the books it feels like it's stretching the limits of believability that Sam never told Jon, and this felt like something I was craving to see happen. I just don't know if it SHOULD be happening because the implications for the books could be so different.
Â 
We saw Ser Pounce! I think the older Tommen is going to work just fine. also, great bit with Pod, Brienne, Jaime and Bronn. I especially enjoyed the moments with just Jaime and Brienne.Â 
Â 
All in all, what a great episode!
1624	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-27	That ending was complere bullcrap...
Â 
AHHH!!!!
Â 
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPEN NEXT!!!!
1625	Verily No One	2014-04-27	After watching Bran's detour I am actually feeling relieved. After the Red Wedding, his arc is among the shortest but most important.
1626	Verily No One	2014-04-27	Wow! Goddamn that was good!

1627	Son of An Other	2014-04-27	I'm definitely a "book purist" I guess you would say, and not just in regards to this series but every other adaptation of a book into a movie/tv series I've seen. That being said, I've had some serious... questions, I'll say... about how the tv series has changed things from the book. I am definitely NOT a fan of Sam telling Jon about Bran, that just seems to me like it wouldn't have been hard at all NOT to say, and the implications of it in the future could be profound. The thing with Bran and Co. getting captured at Craster's isn't the worst imo... they have to keep viewers interested and besides Coldhands, Bran's journey until he gets to his destination isn't all that gripping. So I'm okay with it. Do I think it's a little cheesy? Sure, but I can live with it. The ending scene though... I'm going to be ROYALLY pissed if that's something we were going to encounter in TWOW... like beyond words. Anyone else can think what they want, but to me to books are paramount and shouldn't be messed with, and if stuff like that is gonna keep happening, I'm not gonna be able to watch it anymore until I've read the books JMHO.
1628	Big Daddy	2014-04-27	apparently "Verily No One" is our posts getting stuck in the traffic jam of our excitement.
1629	Verily No One	2014-04-27	I do like when the show fills in what a POV can't give us, as long as it's plausible. Not unnecessary twincest rape, nor an unnecessary trip to Mole's Town to show (What? How filthy it really is? I'm still trying to puzzle that one out.)
I am also not sold on Jon knowing but it will make for more fight scenes.
First Balerion, now Ser Pounce! 
I feel bad for whoever has to wash His Grace's sheet in the morning. Pubescent Tommen works better IMHO.

Finally, Bran and company are featured, my favorites [along with Arya].Â  
Â 
Jojenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s epileptic seizure further evidences my theory that Jojen parallels the Christ-figure Simon inspired by William Goldingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s LotF â<U+0080><U+0093> but I write about the Martin + Golding connection in detail in the homage thread, so I will not elaborate.
Â 
Ghost SUDDENLY appears, locked up.Â  This is disappointing. [I had thought Ghost was so much smarter than getting himself locked up, and I would like to know who and what army imprisoned Ghost?!Â  Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a direwolf!Â  ]Â  BTW, how difficult would it be for Jon to at least once â<U+0080><U+009C>wonderâ<U+0080><U+009D> about Ghost?!Â  
Â 
Â 
Â 
This whole Craster agenda is horrific and so far off the novel.Â  However, I can see that â<U+0080><U+009C>the producersâ<U+0080><U+009D> are building toward â<U+0080><U+009C>somethingâ<U+0080><U+009D>!Â  The viewers need to DESPISE these men of the NW not just for their murders, their violations of the laws of hospitality, and their rape of Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s wives and daughters, and of their winter stores, Â but also now for hurting Bran the greenseer and his friends, all children â<U+0080><U+0093> or child-like, totally defenseless â<U+0080><U+0093> one a cripple, one a half-wit, one a maiden, and one at deathâ<U+0080><U+0099>s door â<U+0080><U+0093> these NW traitors and kinslayers will PAY! Â Bran will remember â<U+0080><U+0093> and it is â<U+0080><U+009C>thisâ<U+0080><U+009D> I think the books and the series are preparing us for, and not just regarding Bran â<U+0080><U+0093> Arya has a long memory as well.
Â 
I Â wish that the show was truer to the books.Â  Contrived scenes bother me, and I am displeased when material is added to evocate emotional responses from the viewers.Â  If shock and surprise are the responses the producers desired, they successfully manipulated me with the capture of Bran and his friends, the violent and abusive behavior of the traitors, and the injuries Bran, Meera, and Hodor suffer.Â  
Â 
What was COOL to me were the WW.Â  The way â<U+0080><U+009C>heâ<U+0080><U+009D> held the baby so lovingly â<U+0080><U+0093> cradling the bundle in his arms â<U+0080><U+0093> and even the magic used to alter the eyes and probably the physical characteristics of the baby was not hurtful.
Â 
This episode shows who it is with the hearts of darkness, and the WW look rather tame when compared to men/women.

1633	Nordeast	2014-04-27	I am on both sides of the isle. I loved this episode, but I don't know if I love where the changes are going. Â Not a big fan of Jon knowing about Bran, and how dumb were they to be making all that nosie 5 feet from Crasters.

1637	Jalapenohitchhiker	2014-04-27	Well that was interesting to say the least. I get the feeling that they don't want the show-only fans to get bored with Bran's story, which may be a reason for the capture at Craster's. Of course this means it is very likely that Jon is going to meet up with Bran. Then what? At this point in the books Jon believes that Bran is dead, but Sam has already told him that he is alive (Side note: I found that deviation to be far out of Sam's character. Yes, the show and the books are different, but Sam is not usually one to break an oath, unless Gilly is involved of course). Then there is the matter of Locke being at the Wall. Now we know that Roose Bolton is aware of Bran's survival thanks to Theon. And Locke is now going with Jon to Craster's Keep. That will be an interesting situation...
Â 
One more thing: I have mixed feelings about seeing the Land of Always Winter. On one hand it's awesome to finally have some idea of what is there, but then again I prefer to read it and visualize it myself first. And just some speculation here, but was the Other at the very end supposed to be the Night's King?
1638	WhiteWalker11	2014-04-27	A Sith with blue eyes? I have officially seen.......... some things.


Â 
Fantastic first post.
1639	Lord Devannious	2014-04-27	I loved the episode. Â I liked the different direction of the show. Ultimately GRRM said that the books/tv are "2 different versions of the same story." Â I think it makes it more interesting. Â But I still think the books will be better then the show.
1640	Facelesss Fan	2014-04-27	friends and book lovers everywhere, I am usually silent on the conversations about the differences between the books and the show....but I have to say this episode was killer, and frankly better than how the books dealt with these issues...what happened at Craster's Keep after the mutiny...I didn't know until tonight...
Â 
Bran's bit was very interesting compared to a relatively quite journey north...though I wish I had met Cold Hands tonight...having Ghost locked up...interesting...I must say this was one of the first episodes that made me more interested in what is coming next than what I already know happens...
Â 
Â 
...sorry for the spoilers and feel free to disagree...after all this is just one asshole's opinion.... Â 
Â 
Â 
....have at you... Â  


I agree, but it is hard to believe that Summer got caught. The WW transformation made the show.
1641	Little Lord F***pants	2014-04-28	Â 
Fantastic first post.

It was better than my first... you know. It was awful... I just layed there.
1642	Seneti	2014-04-28	I like a lot that they have Bran & co doing something although I am fearful of Jon meeting up with Bran. In the books the Starks have been separated so long and it doesn't make much sense to me, thematically at least, to have them get together. Would Jon really let him continue on, which we know that he'd have to? That aside, terrific episode.


Â 
I don't think he's going to have much of a choice. I think either:
Â 
1) Bran and Co. will escape in the middle of the fight between Jon+5 and the mutineers and Jon won't be able to stop him
Â 
2) Locke will reveal himself to be a traitor by trying to kill Bran and Jon will realize that here is no safe place for his brother. That + duty will make him let Bran go.
Â 


Sooooo.......who, what the hell was that thing, and what did he do to the baby?? Obviously he is a maker of white walkers, but WHO is he? What is he? Did you notice how he was dressed??
Wow.....this episode was awesome!! They arent going by the book for sure on many arcs, but I gotta say, I dont mind! Its damned fine storytelling, visually beautiful, and fun not knowing exactly what is gonna happen.
I've also heard a ton of hype on some alleged very disturbing scene that was possibly on tonight? Maybe the rape fest and drinking from Mormont's skull going on at Crasters?
I personally would like to see Bran and Jon meet. Would definitely help expose us and the charachters to more of the magical elements, and maybe help Jon make better decisions at the wall. At some point the arcs are going to have to start acknowledging the magical elements that are showing up. Guess I have to wait til next week to see about the Jon - Bran meeting. :-(
Loved this episode though!!!


Â 
Apparently, HBO credited the horned WW as the Night King and has a "graphic violence" warning for next weeks episode. I shudder to think what that means.
Â 


I think it's more likely that we're going to find that the HBO show and the books are starting to tell two different stories using the same characters and settings. (It's my understanding from my wife that this happened with the show True Blood, the show and the books became substantially different as the series went along.
GRRM knows the series will probably end before the books, I doubt that he is going to have the series ruin surprises he has in store for us in the books.


Â 
Actually, GRRM has already told D&D all the ends to all the major plot lines (who - if anyone - will set the IT, what will the Starks, Targs and Lannisters end up being and doing, what's going to happen with the WW). So we can assume that the ending is going to be roughly the same, but lots of details along the road will be different.
1643	JonTargaryen'	2014-04-28	I loved it--totally loved it.Â  Bran at Craster's, Ghost locked up, Summer in a trap, and that mind-blowing reveal at the end.Â  The White Walker Boss Guy.Â  WTF??Â  Loved it, every minute of it.
Â http://imgur.com/0Orkkbs. 
The boss guy was "nights king".
1644	metr0man	2014-04-28	I frikken loved it. The whole second half the episode was one holy shift moment after another as a book reader. I'm very happy the show is letting paths intersect more. Since this is probably only a seven season show they need to get on with the endgame.
Oh wow what if Jon meets Meera and Jojen??? They are Reeds!!! They might know what Howland knows.... Omg what if we find out R+L=J THIS SEASON??????

Â 
Ha, I seriously doubt that. I think it's a given that the reveal of Jon's parentage will be a big scene in the books, and I don't think it would be something D&D would rush into. Anyway, I'm assuming Bran and co. escape from Craster's when the fighting starts, thus being another moment of "so close, yet so far" for the Stark children.
1646	Niboosmik	2014-04-28	I'm not pleased with the fact that it seems the TV show just spoiled the unreleased book. With Martins comments about going deeper into the North than we ever have before in TWOW, I imagine we find out where Crasters sons go, or what happens to them...welp, now I already know.Â 
Â 
The show is good. The books are better. If that is a spoler I may have to stop watching the show. I love the show but I can't have an altered adapation ruin a story that's been in the making for twenty years.


My thoughts exactly, as much as I drool over those cgi direwolves...
1647	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	I don't like Sam breaking his promise to Bran and telling Jon about running into him.Â  That changes so very much - D&D are fond of saying that the path of the tv show may wander away from the path of the books but they end up in the same place.Â  Hard to imagine that can happen now.


Â 
Sam never made a promise to Bran in the show.
1648	Lasicka	2014-04-28	It's a good thing that HBO runs the episode twice.Â  The first time I watch it, I get shocked by the changes they make and I have to remind myself "the books are not the television series, the television series is not the books".Â  By the second viewing I've calmed down and can decide what I like and don't like.
Â 
I don't like Sam breaking his promise to Bran and telling Jon about running into him.Â  That changes so very much - D&D are fond of saying that the path of the tv show may wander away from the path of the books but they end up in the same place.Â  Hard to imagine that can happen now.
Â 
And Bran getting captured.Â  And the direwolves.Â  Ok, they didn't want to have Cold Hands, they didn't want to show how long the journey was, it was too tedious to show in the series.
Â 
<<<<the books =/=the series>>>


Â 
ThatÂ´s true, they have been doing this since season 2, mostly with JonÂ´s arc. He is at the right places at the right time, but... well in my opinion itÂ´s always the path that is the important one, not the end. ItÂ´s the path that makes the character the person he/she is at the end of it. And in a story driven by characters... just saying, DD...
Â 


Maybe if Jon does meet up with Bran and co, they'll even teach Jon how to use his powers of warging that so far he hasn't even touched. Just a thought.


Â 
That is actually a really good point! I just assumed they would cut it, because in the show the Jon/Ghost relationship is sort of "oh, there goes my pet, nevermind...." Â
1649	ground_control	2014-04-28	Wow. Â I've hated some of D&D's changes before, but this is the first time I feel like I wasted 30 minutes of my life by watching this show. Â The North scenes have me think back with fondness on Robb and Talisa.
1650	Mel_Rose	2014-04-28	I loved the episode and, like someone said before, I was at the edge of my seat for a lot of the time, esp. at the end. Straying from the books worked really well this time,imo. It also reminded me how exciting it is to watch a series and not know what's coming. I've missed that.
1651	Lady of the Falls	2014-04-28	Early in the episode, Sam said something to Jon about Bran. Â I yelled, "WTF?! Â Sam made a promise in the book not to tell anyone that Bran was still alive." Â  Now I'm worried about how this will change everything in the North. Â All of the battles, etc - including Roose's claim to the North is that all of the Starks are dead.


in books Roose knows the Stark boys are alive Theon told him. Â He also knows that Arya is a fake one. He doesn't care.
1652	allie4645	2014-04-28	Guys. Guys, ok. Ok. Does anyone else think that the bad dudes at Craster's were beyond ridiculous? Like, ok, I'm sorry, a skull? Really? Just.... why?
1653	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-28	Guys. Guys, ok. Ok. Does anyone else think that the bad dudes at Craster's were beyond ridiculous? Like, ok, I'm sorry, a skull? Really? Just.... why?


Â 
These 'bad dudes' were sent to the Wall for a reason.
1654	allie4645	2014-04-28	Â 
These 'bad dudes' were sent to the Wall for a reason.


Â 
Yeah, bad guys 'n stuff, always up for a rape and a child beating, whatever. But the freaking skull. Was that supposed to make them look more evil? I'm nitpicking, I know, but drinking out of a skull just to be a dick is beyond cartoonish. I don't know why this is the detail my brain refuses to let go.Â

Â 
It's pretty macabre. I liked it. Seems like something a sentimental man like "Gin-Alley" Karl would do, to flaunt his victory.
1656	The Anti-Targ	2014-04-28	Most of the additions are just make work to keep Bran from getting too far ahead while everyone else's plots are still trying to get to the end of ASoS. All that is fine, and necessary, but Jon knowing about Bran is bad bad bad, not a good adaptational change at all.
Â 
And how the fork did Ghost get captured? And why would the traitors keep him locked up instead of killing him? Stupid! And why hasn't Jon been fretting about Ghost? You'd think he would be expecting to see Ghost back at the Wall by the time he returned and wondering where he is, but no not even a mention about how odd it is that Ghost isn't there. This is just silly and lazy writing, but not a criminal departure from the books. So in the end the only maddening aspect of tonight's episode is Jon knowing about Bran. Well also disappointed about how Mereen went down. When is Ser Jorah's treachery going to be revealed?
1657	clawson24	2014-04-28	I thought Burn Gorman was terrific in this episode. I'm not sure we necessarily needed all that Karl monolouging (except to make it all the more satisfying when he meets his end next episode), but he really came across as equal parts wasted, deluded, deranged, and scary. Pulled it of well IMHO.
1658	The Anti-Targ	2014-04-28	Â

Â 
Not to mention the fact that it's fuggin' hard to prep a drinking skull that pristine within such a short space of time when there's a whole lot of eating, raping, child beating and wolf taunting to be doing. You've basically got to put the skinned skull into a barrel of mealworms for them to eat all the flesh in all the nooks and crannies of the skull, then to make it nice and pearly white you have to soak in just the right concentration of hydrogen peroxide. I thought it was pretty ridiculous but I just let it go.
1659	allie4645	2014-04-28	Did they already cover tKotLT, btw? Or will it be in this season? Or will they cut it? :'(Â
1660	Bear Island	2014-04-28	I loved seeing the Nights King and The Land of Always Winter. That was amazing and even if it was meant to be a reveal in TWoW I don't mind seeing it at all, since I don't really think it's a major spoiler. People have been theorising that the WW take the baby and transform them magically into WWs for ages now and it just confirmed what people had guessed long ago.
I like when they give reveals like that. In the books we are never explicitly told if Margaery is a virgin and the show told us she wasn't. In the books we were never told if Margaery was in on the plot to kill Joff, now we know she wasn't. Those small reveals are very satisfying to me, and even if they are spoilers, they're fairly minor ones. If D&D are showing us how walkers reproduce this early on I can only assume it's not a major plot point/spoiler for the unpublished books.
1661	north of the wall	2014-04-28	This pretty much sums up how I feel. This weeks episode was better than last weeks but I'm not thrilled about Bran or Jon changes but it didnt majorly annoy me either. I was a little disappointed no fArya but meh we will see if that makes much change to the story (probably not much). 
I didn't dislike the episode, but after every week I start to feel more and more like a book snob. I don't like that feeling since almost everyone I know are show only, so I just hope the payoff works out well enough with the story. Here's to hoping.
1662	Roose Seal	2014-04-28	I loved seeing the Nights King and The Land of Always Winter.

The show canon is not the book canon.
Book!Margaery could vey well have been in on the plot, having it confirmed in the show that she wasn't doesn't change that.
Overall this episode was much better than last week's abomination but it still had a whole lot of stupid scenes.

1663	Aderyn	2014-04-28	I just watched the ep so I'll need some more time to let it sink in... But yeah I agree that "Oathkeeper" turned out interestingly. I was shocked about everything related to Bran in this ep but not outraged, and right now I'm dying to find out what this seed they've planted will grow to be like.
Â 
I just love the element of surprise they gave in this episode. As a book reader I miss that a lot, so for me deviating from the books is certainly a positive thing. I've quit whining about what they're doing to the show since it became clear it's going to outrun the books. I'd choose surprise over spoiler anytime, so I'm not that worried about what D&D are planning to do next.
1664	MoseStark*	2014-04-28	I freaked out during this episode, not because I hated it, because I loved it.
I think the changes they made in Bran and Jon's arc work fine and are for the best. I'm dying to know how they are going to pull of a meeting between the two of them, because the Starks have been apart from eachother for such a long time right now.
Â 
The WW's were brilliant, I loved to have something to make me go to the edge of my seat, becayse I didn't already read it. I don't care about being spoiled, the books are still better than the story, so even if I'm going to read this in TWOW, it will be different than the series, and I still will absolutely love it.
Â 
Amazing episode, I can't wait for next week.

Â 
It's a little weird, isn't it? We're so used to knowing what will happen, or how deviations can string back together in the future, but a scene like the end of this episode is a reminder of how fun it must be to watch this show as an Unsullied. Mind you, I still enjoy the show immensely; but that sense of uncertainty, suspense and mystery is lost a lot of the time because of our knowledge of the source material.
Â 
Didn't think it was possible, but I'm even more excited for TWoW now!
1666	Duckfield	2014-04-28	Dany's opening scene was ridiculous. It was short, lame, cheap and didn't make any sense. I HATED it.
Â 
The rest of the episode was mediocre. The ending was interesting but something didn't feel right to me... are they telling us that all you need to "make" more Others is by having one of them touch a human baby? there wasn't any "ritual" to it, even though they tried to make it look like there is...
Â 
Overall I didn't like this episode.
Â 
Sorry for bad english
1667	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-28	I would say that this episode was the best episode of this season so far.Â
1668	Arkash	2014-04-28	I think we've all known for some time now that the show is going to pass the books, its just a fact.Â  Its sort of mind-tangling that now we old time bookwalkers will be getting 'spoiled' watching the show, as opposed to all the previous years of show-only viewers getting spoiled by bookwalkers.Â  Personally, I'm thrilled to my very core.Â  Love being unspoiled, on the edge of my chair, no clue what's going to happen next.Â  It's exciting!!Â  And it won't interfere one whit with me getting the next book(s) the very second they come out.Â  Two different things.Â  Love them both.Â  Tonight was... exciting!!


Â 
This !Â 
Â 
I loved the episode ! Blew my mind ! I was on the edge of my seat at the end ! It felt so good not to know !Â 
Â 
And I actually wonder if Bran and Jon will meet and Jon will let Bran go. If done properly, it could work !
1669	Perin Stone	2014-04-28	Really? I get more frustrated each episode. Everything is wrong. Some things get us to the same point & have to be changed to film & I get that but...Gilly in Mole's Town? The Wildlings are insane. Jon knows Bran is alive & is going to Crasters? Bran is at Crasters? The whole thing is a mess.
One of my favorite things about the books is that things are not always fair. Good people die & it isn't fair. The characters are not purely good or evil (save a few) & for me the show is ruining that.
The whole reason Jon Snow thinks its possible to make good with the wildlings is BECAUSE he realizes they are just people. Some are good, some are bad. The show has painted them all as some savage lunatics I suppose in an attempt for us to root for their deaths?
NO WAY those chumps at Crasters could've captured ghost.
I'm just afraid they are going to change the whole story line. Are the show & the books going to end up in the same place? If not it will be very disappointing for me. I'm glad you all enjoyed the episode but for me its just moving too far away from the books.


Â 
Â 
All of this...Â
1670	Not a kneeler	2014-04-28	I used to be a book purist, but now I love that the show and the books diverge. Can we draw certain conclusions from the differences sometimes? Yes, I think so.Â  I don't think at this point D&D and GRRM have different end games in sight so the differences are shortcuts, or there for dramatic effect.
Â 
It'sÂ like having something fresh during the long wait for the next book.Â  I love it.
1671	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	I loved it.
1672	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-28	I think Jaime releasing Trion make sense but the rest of the changes less so. Bran getting caught? Jon knows about Bran? Jaime is a rapist? Craster baby added nothing only done for shock value.
1673	Little Lord F***pants	2014-04-28	If the show followed the book to the to the T... it would be more drawn out than it already is. Books are fine when the writer has free reign over character development. The show is restricted to 10, 1 hour episodes a season. Considering such a large ensemble with no real lead, that's not an easy feat. Not only that... they have to put together stories that translate well on television. Add that too the fact that Martin didn't have to worry about his 10-13 year old characters looking like college students. 
So far... this season is lining up to be the best since the first. So enjoy it while it lasts, 'cuz next season will probably be a letdown.
1674	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-28	I'm not sure why book fans like this episode so much.
Â 
We already knew what was happening at Craster's Keep after the mutiny. Ghost hunted down and killed some of the perpetrators. Getting Bran mired in everything there is nothing more than pointless filler, plain and simple. Gods help us if he and Jon are reunited. The titular scene - "Oathkeeper" - seemed shorter than Grey Worm's completely superfluous language lesson from Missandei. The overthrow of Meereen was anticlimactic, and Dany's mass-crucifixion of people she thought might have crucified the slave girls (coming soon to a Westeros near you!) was glossed over. That cheap CGI Targaryen flag was atrocious, too.
Â 
Thankfully, at least Saint Tyrion of House Whitewashing didn't give Jaime the idea to send Brienne after Sansa with Oathkeeper and Pod.
Â 
A week after the outrage over gratuitously and grotesquely mutilating a major character arc by having him rape one of the only persons in the world whom he loves and is loyal (if it wasn't supposed to be rape, then why did the writers and directors describe it as "rape" and "forcing himself on her," hm?), we have loads of gruesome rape at Craster's Keep. Totally necessary, I'm sure. It's not like there's more story to tell.

Have a feeling Crasters raid is going to end up being some Keystone Copper / Kurt Sutter / SoA type hijynx where they just miss each other. NW attacks and the Reeds tell Bran it's his only chance to run. We'll see.

What about the hours of gratuitous sex this show throws in our face? The split second rape scene at Craster's least has a point in by showing us how utterly despicable those traitorous pieces of excrement are. What's the point of all the sex & nudity this show is known for? 99% of the time it does nothing to advance the story or develop the characters.

Picture an exec breathing down the director's neck, whispering in his ear "I represent the pervert side of the audience"
Because that's literally what's happening.
1678	The Fourth Head	2014-04-28	I really liked the changes. The show runners have proved a number of times now that actually, they know what they are doing, and whilst it's impossible to please everyone, an awful lot made sense.
Â 
1) I now understand why Tommen was recast, and it linked in with Olenna's husband-swapping story perfectly. Margary "straddled" that fine line between innocent childhood friend and sexual flirt pitch perfectly- the final kiss was a brilliant tease.
A*
Â 
2) I now appreciate a lot better the role Ros played last season. We see Littlefinger's smile, we see Sansa's fear, and we have that image of Ros, his last "female "confidant" engraved in our heads. It adds so much more tension: out of the frying pan, into the fire. My only fear is that they are showing LF's hand too soon, making future revelations less of a surprise, though I hope the next few episodes will see fans build an uneasy trust with him and put their fears aside, same as Sansa, as he goes about setting her up as his daughter, which will diffuse tension, and as Sansa's friend in contrast to Lysa who will be so deplorable. It's not like we haven't been played before, same as Ned after being told explicitly not to trust him, only to go about winning him over.
Â 
3) I loved the changes to Bran's story too. He is my favourite character in the books, but several seasons being totally cut off with little to do but tell stories is hard TV. He was becoming a bossy feral boy in the show, so to see him in a perilous position reconnected me with him sympathetically, and it was a clever way of showing us Bran's developing feelings for Meera in a subtle way.
Â 
4) I loved that nod to Rickon's comment in season 3 about the wildlings: "they make you drink blood from a cup made by your own skull!" It seems Rickon got the wildlings and kneelers the wrong way around: a necessary confusion. It also makes Jon the unambigious hero for now if he marches in and kills the mutineers- which is basically what he is planning on doing: marching off to kill some guys so they wont talk. this sweetens the deal a bit.
Â 
5) Jon's speech was BRILLIANT. "if we are brothers, then Jeor was our father, stabbed in the back- he needs justice!" (I paraphrase)
Just phenomenal writing. Jeor becoming a substitute for Ned, an early way for Jon to confuse leadership with his own personal agendas, and truly perfect foreshadowing. Magnificent.
Â 
Craster's Baby was no great reveal. I loved the icy mountain setting: brilliant, but TBH, I had guessed that was what happened anyway. This just spelled it out, and eliminated any ambiguity.
Â 
Still, going forward, I hope they DONT allow Jon and Bran to meet. Although it would provide a great opportunity for another tearful farewell, and for Bran to re-justify his mission to Jon, I much prefer the idea of Bran stealing away in the melee, providing us with another Arya'esque, or Queenscrown-esque near miss, wrongfooting viewers anticipating a happy greeting, and ramping up the tension that the Starks have not been together for a long time. I like that tension, and I think it's relevant going forwards.
Â 
For the poster criticising the wildlings for all being bad, I disagree. Tormund's disdain for the Thenn's humanised him more than his gruff banter the season before. His looking out for Ygritte humanises him too. I'd pick Tormund over Karl, Slynt, Thorne, and Rast any day.

1679	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-28	I absolutely loved it. Â I love the books, but I am enjoying some of the changes. It makes watching it so exciting b/c you don't know what will happen. Â I also don't mind a little spoilery b/c we have to wait so long for the books anyway. Â I'm glad Bran is getting more story b/c walking in the snow, walking in the snow, walking in the snow would be really bad TV. Â The 3 cities Dany has conquered has already gotten a little stale, but thankfully that's now changing.
Â 
The reveal of the walkers was so cool and very exciting. Â Why did the show have to end at that point? I can't wait for next week.
1680	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	Hopefully Jon is made to think Bran dies at Craster's?
1681	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-28	I think Jaime releasing Trion make sense but the rest of the changes less so. Bran getting caught? Jon knows about Bran? Jaime is a rapist? Craster baby added nothing only done for shock value.

Not sure what you are saying. Jaime hasn't released Tyrion in the show yet but he did in the book so that won't be a change...
1682	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-28	Most of it I thought was pretty good. Showing the lands of always winter and nights king, whom I thought would've been dead but I guess if he and his other wife somehow had a child, that could've been him, wasn't really that big of a spoil, and was nice to see, espeacially with the long wait for twow. Jaimie and Brienne was done well, even Jon's speech was great. The only problem I truly had with the episode was Ghost being locked up looking like Greywind at the RW. That and how Jon doesn't seem to care about him. Also i don't really think Jon knowing about bran is too big a deal, even in the book Jon sort of considers the possibility since he did see Summer at Queenscrown. Them meeting wouldn't be that bad as Bran going off to become a tree is essentially like him being dead and won't have too big an impact on Jon's decisions later on, and if we get a farya it also adds to Jon's belief that if one sibling survived why couldn't another.
1683	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-28	Not sure what you are saying. Jaime hasn't released Tyrion in the show yet but he did in the book so that won't be a change...

Yes and no. 
	Spoiler  Jamie does get Varys to release Tyrion and then they have a discussion about things including Tasha but Vary is the one who let's Tyrion get to Tywin for the kill. I am saying Jamie may be more involved in the latter in the show. Just a theory
1684	Reinzer	2014-04-28	For everyone complaining about the series catching up on the books with that others scene. Go complain to GRRM and his turtle writing pace
1685	Starksmustwin	2014-04-28	Really? I get more frustrated each episode. Everything is wrong.

Â 
Â 
The Show is NOT the books. Â If you want the books, plot point for plot point, then just reread them and call it a day (or week, month.... how am I supposed to know how fast you read?).
Â 
Â 
They call these "adaptations" for a reason. Â It's a TV show "based" off the book series. Â
1686	cybobbie	2014-04-28	I'm perfect fine with the differences since for me it's so clear that they are to completely different medias. I really enjoyed last night's episode and the spoilers. I only didn't like some details things in it, like Sam telling Jon about Bran and Ghost being held in that cage that I can't get how they managed to put him in and how the cage can hold him, because it doesn't seem enough to hold a direwolf. Finally I also hope that Bran and Jon don't meet somehow, because I don't see it as a good change.
1687	JesterX	2014-04-28	I've said I disapprove of the Missandei/Grey Worm storyline because the show's already following so many to add a new one that's not even in the book.Â  That's my major nitpick.
Â 
Going after the Craster mutineers is a departure from the books but it seems like a natural one.Â  The same as the scene with Stannis sentencing Davos to death after he freed Gendry.Â  It seems these were logical things to happen even if the book didn't cover them.
Â 
But at this point, you have to say the show's gone off on a lot of tangents from the book that's going to lead to different endings.Â  At least for some of the characters.

The Show is NOT the books. Â If you want the books, plot point for plot point, then just reread them and call it a day (or week, month.... how am I supposed to know how fast you read?).
Â 
Â 
They call these "adaptations" for a reason. Â It's a TV show "based" off the book series. Â 


On one hand that's a fair comment, but on the other hand the whole reason D&D were allowed to make the series was because they proved to George that they loved the books, they got the books, they understood George. Â So when we all were given this explanation, while we understand and expect that there will be variations, some have been mind blowing, some have been just plain annoying, and some have made people bloody angry. Â Or, at the least, unhappy.
Â 
When Robb's marriage arc was totally changed, for example, you immediately knew it was because the rest of Jeyne's story would be a cipher. Â I would have rather read that in the next book.

Of course I understand the show is not the books. There have been tons of books turned into movies/series they change things to make it better for the screen. It doesn't have to be point for point but I think that a show based on a book should stay as close as possible. Of course this is just my opinion. I am allowed to have it though...

This is pure Martin dude. One of those thing Martin told D&D and we don't know yet. Sorry, but this is a spoiler, and a huge one. No one expected it, but we now know it.
1691	WildBlood	2014-04-28	I wasn't a fan of this episode. All the BS with BRan and then Ghost, and then Locke in the NW.... Ugh. The only part I liked was with the baby and the WW. Since the book never really gave us a view into what happened to Craster's baby boys when they were given, I thought that was interesting. But all the rest I thought was fabricated poorly and didn't even feel like I was watching Game of Thrones at all.
1692	Myrddin	2014-04-28	I would have rather read that in the next book.


There's the rub. The show will end in 2017 or 2018. The book series will not.
1693	chilammx	2014-04-28	Locke in the NW!!!
Lord Bolton ask him to get Bran or Rickon. And he decide to take the best way to achieve that is to get the black.
A sadistic pal of Ramsey Bolton. A nice fighter, but most of all a non-book character.
Â 
I am betting he will be pivotal in the new plot of the NW-Others-Bran-Jon Snow.
Â 
Maybe he is also a good slasher....
1694	jarl the climber	2014-04-28	I've said I disapprove of the Missandei/Grey Worm storyline because the show's already following so many to add a new one that's not even in the book.Â  That's my major nitpick.
Â 
Going after the Craster mutineers is a departure from the books but it seems like a natural one.Â  The same as the scene with Stannis sentencing Davos to death after he freed Gendry.Â  It seems these were logical things to happen even if the book didn't cover them.

I actually liked the Grey Worm/Missandei scene. It added a dimension to the characters that we have not gotten in the books. I like how their attitude changed when Dany walked into the tent, they sort of put their masks back on, they do not completely trust Dany and are following her for now for their own reasons.
Â 
The whole thing with Crasters is interesting, I sort of thought it was possible that Thorne and the other five Rangers that Jon sent out might have gone after the mutineers at Crasters on their own iniative and now they sort of flipped things with Thorne sending Jon.Â
1695	Roose Seal	2014-04-28	On one hand that's a fair comment, but on the other hand the whole reason D&D were allowed to make the series was because they proved to George that they loved the books, they got the books, they understood George.

You know, the longer the show goes on, the more I wonder if D&D aren't just two random writers HBO found (not to mention Benioff's connections) and the whole "nerds with no TV experience had a sit-down with GRRM and "Who is Jon Snow's mom?"" thing is not some apocryphal story the execs cooked up to add to the "mythology" of the genesis of show itself and to possibly instill confidence in a fanbase that was, at the time, only comprised of book readers. Like, "We know what we're doing, these two nerds have gained GRRM's trust".
Because at times it looks like D&D either have absolutely no respect for the source material or no idea what they're doing.
1696	Starksmustwin	2014-04-28	I'm not sure why book fans like this episode so much.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Because some of us realize that this is an adaptation? Â Because we know it's more difficult to show a persons nature and intent on TV/in movies than it is when you can read their every thought in a book? Â  Some of the characters are different? Â Well, of course they are. Â All of the characters complexities have to be degraded for a media that only has minutes per episode to explain what these characters are doing and going through. Â  They add in new scenes not in the book? Â Of course they do. Â No one wants to see Bran walking through snow for several episodes. Â 
Â 
Seriously man, just go reread the books and be happy. Â It's very apparent that people like you only watch the show so you can complain about how it's ruining the books. Â  Well, the books still exist in their entirety. Â  Â Have at them.

1697	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-28	Really? I get more frustrated each episode. Everything is wrong. Some things get us to the same point & have to be changed to film & I get that but...Gilly in Mole's Town? The Wildlings are insane. Jon knows Bran is alive & is going to Crasters? Bran is at Crasters? The whole thing is a mess. 
One of my favorite things about the books is that things are not always fair. Good people die & it isn't fair. The characters are not purely good or evil (save a few) & for me the show is ruining that. 
The whole reason Jon Snow thinks its possible to make good with the wildlings is BECAUSE he realizes they are just people. Some are good, some are bad. The show has painted them all as some savage lunatics I suppose in an attempt for us to root for their deaths? 
NO WAY those chumps at Crasters could've captured ghost. 
I'm just afraid they are going to change the whole story line. Are the show & the books going to end up in the same place? If not it will be very disappointing for me. I'm glad you all enjoyed the episode but for me its just moving too far away from the books.ah, I think you are going a little overboard.  Really, in the books until Jon allows them to come through we see them as bunch of savages. Even Jon has his own motives to as why he allows them through.  One of them being that he doesnt want them to turn into WW.  The other is he grew fond of them while he was with them. I think it will all come together.
1698	rocksniffer	2014-04-28	Maybe if Jon does meet up with Bran and co, they'll even teach Jon how to use his powers of warging that so far he hasn't even touched. Just a thought.


Â 
i am curious about this too, after all that talent might prove invaluable in the future...wouldn't the rest of the Sullied, herein, agree?
Â 
Â 


I just watched the ep so I'll need some more time to let it sink in... But yeah I agree that "Oathkeeper" turned out interestingly. I was shocked about everything related to Bran in this ep but not outraged, and right now I'm dying to find out what this seed they've planted will grow to be like.
Â 
I just love the element of surprise they gave in this episode. As a book reader I miss that a lot, so for me deviating from the books is certainly a positive thing. I've quit whining about what they're doing to the show since it became clear it's going to outrun the books. I'd choose surprise over spoiler anytime, so I'm not that worried about what D&D are planning to do next.


Â 
my thoughts exactly...most of the changes from the beginning have really just tightened up the story and made it both a great book series and a great tv series...
Â 


Â 
It's a little weird, isn't it? We're so used to knowing what will happen, or how deviations can string back together in the future, but a scene like the end of this episode is a reminder of how fun it must be to watch this show as an Unsullied. Mind you, I still enjoy the show immensely; but that sense of uncertainty, suspense and mystery is lost a lot of the time because of our knowledge of the source material.
Â 
Didn't think it was possible, but I'm even more excited for TWoW now!


Â 
...and perhaps having a different take on things we thought we knew will make the reveals coming in TWoW more exciting rather than ruining the story, a some believe...
Â 


I'm not sure why book fans like this episode so much.
Â 
We already knew what was happening at Craster's Keep after the mutiny. Ghost hunted down and killed some of the perpetrators. Getting Bran mired in everything there is nothing more than pointless filler, plain and simple. Gods help us if he and Jon are reunited. The titular scene - "Oathkeeper" - seemed shorter than Grey Worm's completely superfluous language lesson from Missandei. The overthrow of Meereen was anticlimactic, and Dany's mass-crucifixion of people she thought might have crucified the slave girls (coming soon to a Westeros near you!) was glossed over. That cheap CGI Targaryen flag was atrocious, too.
Â 
Thankfully, at least Saint Tyrion of House Whitewashing didn't give Jaime the idea to send Brienne after Sansa with Oathkeeper and Pod.
Â 
A week after the outrage over gratuitously and grotesquely mutilating a major character arc by having him rape one of the only persons in the world whom he loves and is loyal (if it wasn't supposed to be rape, then why did the writers and directors describe it as "rape" and "forcing himself on her," hm?), we have loads of gruesome rape at Craster's Keep. Totally necessary, I'm sure. It's not like there's more story to tell.


Â 
I get that many were disturbed by the last epi and the sex on the alter scene, and even though i respect everyone's right to an opinion, mine is that rape, child abuse and murder are part of this story, in the books as well as the show...so why did it shock anyone...in addition although Ghost avenging the mutiny was ok for the books, really getting to see what was going on and how the women were chanting, for example, made that whole part of the story a fuller representation of things i had only imagined...
Â 


What about the hours of gratuitous sex this show throws in our face? The split second rape scene at Craster's least has a point in by showing us how utterly despicable those traitorous pieces of excrement are. What's the point of all the sex & nudity this show is known for? 99% of the time it does nothing to advance the story or develop the characters.


Â 
as a fan of gratuitous sex on HBO for more than 30 years (anyone else remember that HBO used to only show R-rated films after 9 pm), what shocks me is that people are outraged by seeing things that the books never shrink from...GRRM describes sex in vivid detail throughout the books, so what's wrong with seeing it...
Â 
Â 


On one hand that's a fair comment, but on the other hand the whole reason D&D were allowed to make the series was because they proved to George that they loved the books, they got the books, they understood George. Â So when we all were given this explanation, while we understand and expect that there will be variations, some have been mind blowing, some have been just plain annoying, and some have made people bloody angry. Â Or, at the least, unhappy.
Â 
When Robb's marriage arc was totally changed, for example, you immediately knew it was because the rest of Jeyne's story would be a cipher. Â I would have rather read that in the next book.


Â 
My dearest Fragile Bird, i find myself disagreeing with the premise that making changes somehow lessens D&D's respect and understanding of the story...sure people always get annoyed...myself included...when a filmmaker changes important parts of a story ( i am reminded of Cujo and the fate of the boy)...but i do not think the books are inviolate. In fact i am of the opinion that several of the changes have enhanced my appreciation for the story and its rich texture.Â 
Â 
...as for Robb and Jeyne, i didn't get that change but in the grand scheme i guess it hasn't impacted me that much. And like you, i also believe the journey is at least as important as the end result, if not more so, Â that being said i am not sure that my desire to read the final books has been lessened by what the show has changed or revealed about the paths taken by the main characters...
Â 
...just more mutterings from your favorite salty old asshole.... Â
1699	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-28	I find them doing too much each episode. If it were not for having the read the books I am not sure I would know what was going on.

Goodness why so angry? It is not a personal offense to you for some of us book readers to disagree with the way the show is portraying the books. Some episodes I love, some I don't. This one I didn't. I'm happy that you did. Its OK for us to think differently.
1701	Har!!!	2014-04-28	I have to agree with many on how it is nice to expand Bran's journey north of the Wall. Walking through snow would have gotten old pretty fast. I still don't really want to see Jon and Bran meet up though. That nagging speculation in Jon's head seems like a better plot device than them seeing each other.
Â 
Night's King/Lands of Always Winter was pretty great, I thought. That bit really made me sit up.
Â 
Is that Locke guy the stand-in for Vargo Hoat from a couple of seasons ago? There was some ominous tones to the score when he stood up to volunteer for the Craster mission. I'm excited to see what he tries to pull.
Â 
Although I've come around on the Meereen storyline from the books (thanks to this series of essays), I didn't really think much of the scenes of it in this episode. It'll be interesting to see how they introduce all of the characters with Zs in their names.
Â 
Lastly, I really wish Pod caught up to Brienne like in the books. It would have made for some good tension on the part of Brienne while she's on the road.

Â 
I agree...to each his own...if we all thought the same this forum would be pretty boring...Â
1703	Han Snow	2014-04-28	Â Some people think it is easy adapting a saga as rich and vast as ASOIAF.
Â 
Â No it's not.
Â 
Â  D&D are actuallyÂ  doing a decent job of it all. There is no one out there who wouldn't make similar mistakes as them. Maybe in 20-30 years when Star Trek holodeck technology becomes a reality, a perfect adaptation could be re made, but not now. They are restricted by time, money, location etc...
Â 
Â And the truth is that the fat needs to be cut, the plot streamlined, certain characters changed so this story can work on screen. The thing is, in that process, mishaps and grave mistakes are bound to happen. Like the rape scene from last week. That was a putrid filled mistake that should have never ever taken place. I couldn't take Jaime's acts of kindness seriously in this episode because of it. Or silly stuff like people fighting without helmets, or that ridiculous statement from Jon in this episode that wildlings fight dual wielding two weapons and that it makes them more deadly. Nonsense, no one in their right mind would try to fight with two weapons, its completely unpractical and makes you an easy target. Besides they are supposed to be poor and without proper weapons made of steel or iron. But it makes for a more interesting tv.
Â 
All in all I loved this episode. The WW at the end kept me on the tips of my toes and it was a great way to show us little bit more of them by answering what happens with Craster's sons. I was also strangely fond of the Jon/Bran plot change. Adds a bit of life in the North/Wall storyline.

1704	zombree	2014-04-28	I'm not pleased with the fact that it seems the TV show just spoiled the unreleased book. With Martins comments about going deeper into the North than we ever have before in TWOW, I imagine we find out where Crasters sons go, or what happens to them...welp, now I already know.Â 
Â 
The show is good. The books are better. If that is a spoler I may have to stop watching the show. I love the show but I can't have an altered adapation ruin a story that's been in the making for twenty years.


I would no count on it being a book spoiler. I both read and watched Trueblood and the show and the book series it was based off because two completely different things. I seriously hope HBO wont do that with GOT but I wouldn't put it past them.
Â 
Â 
I was actually really excited watching it last night, it was the first time I had no idea what was going to happen next and it was kind of refreshing.Â
1705	Starksmustwin	2014-04-28	Goodness why so angry? It is not a personal offense to you for some of us book readers to disagree with the way the show is portraying the books. Some episodes I love, some I don't. This one I didn't. I'm happy that you did. Its OK for us to think differently.


Â 
I'll stop being so angry if you stop blowing things out of proportions. Â  I mean, they added a little more meat to Bran's boring story and your reaction is... "Now I'm afraid they'll change the whole story! [/emo_face]"? Â  Yeah, that's not an over reaction at all. Â  They're two different mediums. Â One limitless and one very limited. Â  One can literally get you inside the mind of the characters and one has to be more visual and a lot more straight forward.Â 
Â 
Honestly, you're only hurting yourself regardless. Â  Instead of fully enjoying this story told in two different ways, you instead use one of the ways to make your self disappointed with the other. Â  If some of you would realize that the show in no way changes or defiles the books, you'd likely come away each Sunday night with nothing but a smile on your face. Â Regardless of the changes that need to be made (or the ones that don't), this show is easily one of the best on TV.
Â 
Oh, and I've read the book series twice and listened to the Roy Dotrice audio book version as well. Â  Â With that said, I don't care what they have to change in order to make the tv series more interesting. Â If I want a word for word Song of Ice and Fire, Â I'll just reread the books a third time.
1706	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-28	curious that the mutiners had Ghost caged and weird how Bran an company got captured by the men at Crasters. also Locke with Jon... what is that? and im assuming there wont be a Coldhands
1707	Rockroi	2014-04-28	I think this was the first time I really thought I was watching a television show instead of enjoying Game of Thrones/ASoIaF. Â I really thought it was pedestrian if not outright sloppy writing; contrived, formulaic and lazy. Â It was an average TV program, not the phenomenon we have all come to know and love (and respect). Â 
Â 
I said my thoughts in the main thread for Oathkeeper, but here are my high points:
Â 
-Apparently, EVERYONE eventually ends up at Craster's Keep, even though the "Land Beyond the Wall" is a vast, uncharted place. Â Letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seeâ<U+0080>¦ Jon Snow, Bran, the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, the White Walkers (who use it as the worst take-out joint in Westeroes), etc â<U+0080><U+0093> they all stop into this placeâ<U+0080>¦ in a world that has been described as so vast you cannot keep track of anything.Â  But now we have â<U+0080>¦ everyone â<U+0080>¦ hereâ<U+0080>¦ Jojen, Rast, Ghostâ<U+0080>¦ the gang is all hereâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
-While it seems weird, the inclusion of Ghost is really, REALLY troubling. Â Why is he there? Â Why did they keep him? Â How did these morons catch him and cage him? Â Why is he caged? Â The answer could be that "Ghost is caged because he has to be there so somebody can find him." Â Which is the clinical definition of "convenient plot devise." Which has me concerned...Â 
Â 
-Bran is one of the more lack-luster POVs in the book and Martin has said repeatedly that Bran is the hardest character for him to write; Bran does very very little.Â  The show cannot keep paying these actors to walk around for 10 episodes and have all of 3 scenes.Â  They have to DO something.Â  And â<U+0080>¦ now they are. Â Now, I get that but make them do something worthwhile. Â I don't mind- at all- the desire to give Bran's story some meat; I DO MIND a great deal the silliness and the contrived nature of what they are doing now. Â Bran, the cripple, runs into yet another group of people he cannot fight off- first it was the wildings, then it was the Ironborn, now its the Craster Mutineers. Â Same verse, little bit louder, a little bit worse. Â If you want to do something with Bran, why not just cut to the case and bring in Brandyn Rivers/Bloodraven? Â Lets do it. Â 
Â 
-THIS looks so painfully contrived.Â  So utterly contrived to get the actors in the show to do something.Â  Its taken 4 episodes to doâ<U+0080>¦ that and it â<U+0080>¦. Looks terrible.Â  The only thing holding it together are Bran and the Reeds.Â  The actors are NAILING IT and thank God for that because the story looks terrible.Â 
Â 
-Going off-book can pay HUGE dividends (Robert and Cersei; Tywin and Arya), but if done badly it can be ludicrously awkward (the Brotherhood Without Banners being a tight groupâ<U+0080>¦ unless a hot red woman wants to buy one of you; Shae), a waste of time (Dany in Qath) or prove to be the worst scene in the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s 3.5-year run (CerseiÂ  and Jaime in the sept). If you are going to go off book, for the live of Christ, do it well, don't give us shallow convenience. Â 
Â 
-This is feelingÂ eerilyÂ like Roz.Â  I always felt Roz was there because you needed somebody to tie together all the loose, disparate parts of the show.Â  And it always smacked of lazy writing. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what I feel about this.Â  That Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s is just a lazy way to try to coagulate a pretty diffused story.Â  In the book, its not a problem.Â  In the show?Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a problem.Â  But this is not how to solve it.Â  They went off-book and did it in the most ham-fisted and clumsy way possible.Â  And its so obvious and so unnecessary.Â  I know D&D are â<U+0080><U+009C>geniusesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and they now, apparently, believe it.Â  They think they can do no wrong.
Â 
And that may be correct, but right now Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seems forced, sloppy, lazy and convoluted.Â 
Â 
Prove me wrong.Â

Â 
And that may be correct, but right now Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seems forced, sloppy, lazy and convoluted.Â 
Â 
Prove me wrong.Â 


Â 
Of course it is. Â Meera the huntress all of a sudden becomes so stupid that she's within EAR SHOT of Craster's Keep and they don't know it? Â Did she stop doing any recon or what? Â And yes, Ghost is captured by the mutineers and kept alive for the reason that he needs to be found...
Â 
I don't object per se to them ending up at Craster's...but the fact that they're right there by it in the woods and have no clue there is a huge encampment nearby until they hear a baby crying is just lazy writing.
1709	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	I think this was the first time I really thought I was watching a television show instead of enjoying Game of Thrones/ASoIaF. Â I really thought it was pedestrian if not outright sloppy writing; contrived, formulaic and lazy. Â It was an average TV program, not the phenomenon we have all come to know and love (and respect). Â 
Â 
I said my thoughts in the main thread for Oathkeeper, but here are my high points:
Â 
-Apparently, EVERYONE eventually ends up at Craster's Keep, even though the "Land Beyond the Wall" is a vast, uncharted place. Â Letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seeâ<U+0080>¦ Jon Snow, Bran, the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, the White Walkers (who use it as the worst take-out joint in Westeroes), etc â<U+0080><U+0093> they all stop into this placeâ<U+0080>¦ in a world that has been described as so vast you cannot keep track of anything.Â  But now we have â<U+0080>¦ everyone â<U+0080>¦ hereâ<U+0080>¦ Jojen, Rast, Ghostâ<U+0080>¦ the gang is all hereâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
-While it seems weird, the inclusion of Ghost is really, REALLY troubling. Â Why is he there? Â Why did they keep him? Â How did these morons catch him and cage him? Â Why is he caged? Â The answer could be that "Ghost is caged because he has to be there so somebody can find him." Â Which is the clinical definition of "convenient plot devise." Which has me concerned...Â 
Â 
-Bran is one of the more lack-luster POVs in the book and Martin has said repeatedly that Bran is the hardest character for him to write; Bran does very very little.Â  The show cannot keep paying these actors to walk around for 10 episodes and have all of 3 scenes.Â  They have to DO something.Â  And â<U+0080>¦ now they are. Â Now, I get that but make them do something worthwhile. Â I don't mind- at all- the desire to give Bran's story some meat; I DO MIND a great deal the silliness and the contrived nature of what they are doing now. Â Bran, the cripple, runs into yet another group of people he cannot fight off- first it was the wildings, then it was the Ironborn, now its the Craster Mutineers. Â Same verse, little bit louder, a little bit worse. Â If you want to do something with Bran, why not just cut to the case and bring in Brandyn Rivers/Bloodraven? Â Lets do it. Â 
Â 
-THIS looks so painfully contrived.Â  So utterly contrived to get the actors in the show to do something.Â  Its taken 4 episodes to doâ<U+0080>¦ that and it â<U+0080>¦. Looks terrible.Â  The only thing holding it together are Bran and the Reeds.Â  The actors are NAILING IT and thank God for that because the story looks terrible.Â 
Â 
-Going off-book can pay HUGE dividends (Robert and Cersei; Tywin and Arya), but if done badly it can be ludicrously awkward (the Brotherhood Without Banners being a tight groupâ<U+0080>¦ unless a hot red woman wants to buy one of you; Shae), a waste of time (Dany in Qath) or prove to be the worst scene in the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s 3.5-year run (CerseiÂ  and Jaime in the sept).

Â 
IMO, it was one of the best episodes ever.
1710	briantw	2014-04-28	I don't like Sam breaking his promise to Bran and telling Jon about running into him. That changes so very much - D&D are fond of saying that the path of the tv show may wander away from the path of the books but they end up in the same place. Hard to imagine that can happen now.

If I recall correctly, he never made any such promise on the show.  That was book only.
1711	WITCHKING	2014-04-28	Worst episode ever...
1712	Rockroi	2014-04-28	Â

Â 
But... back it up. Â Give me some evidence that what I said is somehow wrong. Â That the evidence I have presented is factually off; that there is a rational explanation for my concerns OTHER THAN "The writers just wanted to get everyone together." Â
1713	acacia	2014-04-28	I loved the episode, mainly because of all the northern stuff including the wolves and the magic/supernatural? beyond the wall. Thats one of the main reasons i enjoyed the first season, i read the books after in between seasons 1 and 2 and still prefer the northern storylines. This season has seemed a bit cut together for my liking, this is the only episode that seemed to have a bit of glue between scenes and flowed well between locations. Other episodes have almost seemed like the director has called out "and now we have dany......and now we have stannis" as it cut to each section.
1714	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-28	I am glad Bran is doing something but have to agree Craters may not be the place.  I certainly hope we get a close call but no meeting between Bran and Jon.

I'll give you that, Ghost being there is stupid. They should have killed the wolf long time ago. About the Craster's keep...IIRC, Bran, in his way to Bloodraven's cave, came that way. Didn't Coldhands kill the deserters? About Bran being to active...you can't make him meet BR yet. That's ADWD stuff and we are not even at half of season 4. He'll meet him this season, but (as happens with Jon Snow), he needs something to do.
For the off-books scenes...well, as you said, there are some great scenes (Robert-Cersei and Tywin-Arya), some terrible ones (Jaime and Cersei in the Sept), and, Dany in Qarth was a waste of time in the books too.

Â 
Wrong? Â Not sure if wrong is the right way to describe it. Â The show was always going to need some plot devices to keep the story going forward. Â 
Â 
But to respond to a few of your points.
Â 
I find nothing wrong with people constantly bumping into Craster's Keep. Â While the land beyond the wall is vast, most of it beyond the reach of humans. Â  Further south it not nearly as expansive. Â Given that the Keep is one of the few areas where there are actual people, it shouldn't be that shocking that people wind up there.
Â 
There aren't many ways you can depict a crippled child and the books did the show little favor. Â Watching Bran endlessly carried through the snow isn't going to make for compelling TV.
Â 
IMO, I think we get to meet Cold Hands this week. Â  And he does what he does in the books, then meets Bran & Co. and they venture off before Jon gets to Craster's.
1717	UK Mord	2014-04-28	The books are the books and the tv series is an adaptation of the books made for a tv audience which in fairness is a wider audience.
They are what they are and personally I can't get upset about things changing from one to the other.
Being in the UK I have not yet seen the episode and sadly away on business so won't get to see till tomorrow now . 
Do I understand correctly though? bran is already at Craster's and John is on his way? If this is the case, do you think it is just another frustratingly close encounter when as the reader / viewer, you want the family that has been split be reunited but it doesn't happen? I remember reading the books, for me it was one of the most emotional bits where Bran was in the tower and Jon just outside with the wildlings.
1718	Rockroi	2014-04-28	IIRC, Bran, in his way to Bloodraven's cave, came that way. Didn't Coldhands kill the deserters?
Â 

Â 
No.Â  IN the books, Coldhands only kills wrights to rescue Sam and then when they are attackd just as they get to Bloodravenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cave.Â  There is not â<U+0080><U+009C>Showdown at Crasters.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  Not that that would have made it better; had the scene been in the books Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d have also thought it contrived.Â 
Â 
Wrong?Â  Not sure if wrong is the right way to describe it.Â  The show was always going to need some plot devices to keep the story going forward.
Â 

Â 
Plot devises is one thing; plot contrivances is another.Â 
Â 
I find nothing wrong with people constantly bumping into Craster's Keep.Â  While the land beyond the wall is vast, most of it beyond the reach of humans.Â Â  Further south it not nearly as expansive.Â  Given that the Keep is one of the few areas where there are actual people, it shouldn't be that shocking that people wind up there.
Â 

Â 
There is not aÂ  single character that has gone South to North who has not ended up there.Â  That seems almost mystical to me.Â  And silly.Â 
Â 
There aren't many ways you can depict a crippled child and the books did the show little favor.Â  Watching Bran endlessly carried through the snow isn't going to make for compelling TV.
Â 

Â 
I agree.Â  So, why then did they do it again with Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s?Â  Season 1- captured by wildings (before Robb + Theon rescue); Season 2 captured by THeon; season 3 ALMOST captured by Wildings; Season 4, now, captured by the Deserters.Â  Its still the same, its still boring. Â They ARE doing the same thing. Â I agree, in the books its boring. Â But why compound the problem by making it boring AND contrived? Â
1719	zombree	2014-04-28	I think this was the first time I really thought I was watching a television show instead of enjoying Game of Thrones/ASoIaF.

Â 
Â 


Â 
Ultimately I feel like we all need to realize we are watching a TV show, all the book lovers are going to miss out on some element that they loved and due to the enormity of the books the show runners are going to have to mix things up. When I was reading the books I found the Bran chapters to be really boring. And when he pops up on screen I groan a little inside because I know that at this point in time he literally has nothing to do but wander around though the means by which he wound up in the situation he did was a bit contrived it was nice to be caught off guard.
1720	William Campbell	2014-04-28	These aren't spoilers, this is just fan fiction from HBO, a sort of "what if," like 'what if Rob's wife went to the red wedding,' 'what if Bran went to craster's keep and was captured by mutineers.'Â  People put too much faith in the relationship between Martin and the producers of the show.Â  The TV show will conitinue to diverge from the books as the show goes on.Â  The ending will be different definitely.
1721	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-28	Â 
I'll stop being so angry if you stop blowing things out of proportions. Â  I mean, they added a little more meat to Bran's boring story and your reaction is... "Now I'm afraid they'll change the whole story! [/emo_face]"? Â  Yeah, that's not an over reaction at all. Â  They're two different mediums. Â One limitless and one very limited. Â  One can literally get you inside the mind of the characters and one has to be more visual and a lot more straight forward.Â 
Â 
Honestly, you're only hurting yourself regardless. Â  Instead of fully enjoying this story told in two different ways, you instead use one of the ways to make your self disappointed with the other. Â  If some of you would realize that the show in no way changes or defiles the books, you'd likely come away each Sunday night with nothing but a smile on your face. Â Regardless of the changes that need to be made (or the ones that don't), this show is easily one of the best on TV.
Â 
Oh, and I've read the book series twice and listened to the Roy Dotrice audio book version as well. Â  Â With that said, I don't care what they have to change in order to make the tv series more interesting. Â If I want a word for word Song of Ice and Fire, Â I'll just reread the books a third time.

OK you keep right on being angry then! With so righteous a cause who wouldn't be?! How dare other people not enjoy the show the way you did or worse yet have their own opinion on things! 
LOL. Seriously it isn't that deep. I understand completely that the books are not changed because the show is (as anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together would) I just want to see the BOOK on the SHOW. Not that it's not still capable of showing that but I'm worried they are going to end up some place completely different and for me that would be disappointing. 
They didn't just add "a little more to Bran's story" Since you have read the books twice I'm sure you realize that and were just using that line for dramatic reaction. 
It's all going to be ok I promise. If some people don't enjoy things you do, that's alright. HBO isn't going to stop airing because I said I didn't like an episode.
1722	flyerhawk	2014-04-28	Â 
No.Â  IN the books, Coldhands only kills wrights to rescue Sam and then when they are attackd just as they get to Bloodravenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cave.Â  There is not â<U+0080><U+009C>Showdown at Crasters.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  Not that that would have made it better; had the scene been in the books Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d have also thought it contrived.Â 
Â 
Â

Pretty sure that Cold Hands kills the remaining mutineers. Â It's revealed to Bran via warg experience.
Â 
I agree.Â  So, why then did they do it again with Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s?Â  Season 1- captured by wildings (before Robb + Theon rescue); Season 2 captured by THeon; season 3 ALMOST captured by Wildings; Season 4, now, captured by the Deserters.Â  Its still the same, its still boring. Â They ARE doing the same thing. Â I agree, in the books its boring. Â But why compound the problem by making it boring AND contrived? Â 
Â 

Â 
That just seems like being pretty nit picky. Â That particular group of people is more or less helpless with only Meera being able to do much of anything. Â  If my guess that Cold Hands shows up this week is right, then I think things will turn around in that regard.

1723	Miodrag	2014-04-28	What I will always fail to understand is why certain people believe deviations from the novel lessen the quality of the show.

Â 
It probably has to do with the fact that the vast majority of changes was for the worse. For example, Dany/Drogo wedding night in the show was criticized, only, not because it happened before Jaime pushing Bran (which would've been nothing but pointless nitpicking), but because the scene was significantly altered, and the change made the scene more cliched and predictable and a layer in their story was lost. We're only criticizing the deviations there are actually damaging to the story. It is not our responsibility that every single change - save a few - made the story much weaker than it could've been had D&D stayed close to the novels.
Â 


A. The books aren't perfect


Â 
Book-admirers actually know that. Therefore, when books are discussed, criticizers usually don't get attacked and ridiculed and "educated" on the nature of the medium in question. Complaints get challenged, of course, just like they should, instead of simply being dismissed as "trolling". But, it's not books' imperfections that are problematic, because, even with imperfections, ASOIAF novels are great literature. TV show's imperfections are the actual trouble, because some apparently think TV show is perfect, or, at the very least, not to be criticized.
Â 


B. They are separate entities


Â 
Has anyone denied that?
Â 


C. Some of this stuff is really, really cool


Â 
For you, perhaps. For me, not so much. But anyway, "cool" is not the attribute I respect that much. I'd rather for characters and twists and developments and plot-lines to be meaningful and deep and skillful, than cool.
1724	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-28	These aren't spoilers, this is just fan fiction from HBO, a sort of "what if," like 'what if Rob's wife went to the red wedding,' 'what if Bran went to craster's keep and was captured by mutineers.'Â  People put too much faith in the relationship between Martin and the producers of the show.Â  The TV show will conitinue to diverge from the books as the show goes on.Â  The ending will be different definitely.


Â 
I agree that the show will diverge more and more in the upcoming seasons, but I don't see how the ending would be different ? Didn't the showrunners say that they sat down with Martin and went through every character's fate?. Unless Martin was bullshitting them the ending will probably stay roughly the same, the path will be different.
Â
1725	Toft	2014-04-28	Should we worry too much about the fact that Jon knows about Bran? They might not meet. Jon might be led to believe Bran is dead in some other way, restoring things to roughly how they are. Or, in the books, Jon and Bran might meet in future. As they say, the roads may be different but the destination is the same.

1726	Ser_Not_Appearing_In_This_Book	2014-04-28	Maybe Bran will warg into Hodor, who will set Ghost free & they escape in the ensuing mayhem, never to see Jon et al whatsoever..Â 
Â 
Was totally tripping last nite tho during the ep ..Â
1727	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-28	The forums have not been working for me all night last night or all day today, so sorry for jumping into the conversation late.
I would normally agree with you here Toft, but for me as a book reader, the journey is so much more fulfilling than the destination. I'm really worried about Samwell telling Jon about Bran. What is this going to change in the story? AS LC Jon bases a lot of his decisions, personal or business, on the feelings he has for his family.
Personally, I don't think Bran and Jon will be meeting in the show, or at least not this season. That way the canon storyline is preserved, and the writers have created their needless drama to fill up minutes of the show and use actors they've paid for the season. Bran is one of the few characters who they haven't butchered onscreen so I am quite disappointed but maybe it will go away quickly. I like your idea that perhaps Jon will think Bran has died there and so, preserving the canon storyline. Very nice.
1728	Darryk	2014-04-28	It was a brilliant episode, and I'm really interested to see where they take these new developments. Bran at Craster's Keep, Locke joing the Night's Watch etc, as a book reader it's nice to be in suspense for once.
1729	gash	2014-04-28	i'm enjoying this season much more than previous ones as i have finally managed to seperate out the books and the show in my head. i couldn't fully enjoy yhe tv show last few seasons as i was constantly thinking about what was different in the books as well as getting less enjoyment from knowing exactly how things turn out. but now it seems to be diverging quite a bit i am actually open to surprises every episode.
1730	Toft	2014-04-28	Maybe Bran will warg into Hodor, who will set Ghost free & they escape in the ensuing mayhem, never to see Jon et al whatsoever..Â 
Â 
Was totally tripping last nite tho during the ep ..Â 


Â 
I am definitely expecting a Bran->Hodor warg pretty soon, now that the theme of warging is being more actively addressed. Note that Hodor was mysteriously absent while Bran et al were being abused.
Â 
I was stunned, especially by the last scene, at the degree to which things are catching up with and now overtaking the books. But all the while up until now, I've been watching the show knowing largely what will happen. I found tonight's twists - twists we as readers were warned to expect to be on the increase - really livened up the show for me.
Â 
Now if they can play it well and restore the main essence of the plot, while not destroying the characters' motivations, I shall be very happy. Otherwise if you insist on utter faithfulness then the show is a mere replica or celebration of the books: why not allow it to be something of its own after all?
Â 
Yet when it comes to finding out before reading it where this is all leading... I was intending to make that decision after this series or the next. To have it thrust upon me means I haven't had time to reflect.
Â 
Increasingly, whether or not I watch the show, the spoilers will get through. Just the other day I read an article by the former Prime Minister of Australia about the show. Audiences just keep on growing. Knowing a lot of what will happen, though, doesn't take away from the prose, which is hauntingly magical at times, and I'd rather have the show spoil things than random internet sites. Looks like that is the direction I will choose, at least for this series.

1732	Jon-Michael Pearson	2014-04-28	Not sure if this on here but I dont think Jon runs into Bran for some reason I think Bran takes over for Hodor and kills most if not all the muntines and they leave before Jon and the Rangers get there.
1733	Little Lord F***pants	2014-04-28	As a fan of gratuitous sex on HBO for more than 30 years (anyone else remember that HBO used to only show R-rated films after 9 pm), what shocks me is that people are outraged by seeing things that the books never shrink from...GRRM describes sex in vivid detail throughout the books, so what's wrong with seeing it...
It's because there's no point to it. That's why it's called "gratuitous". And the fact that I'm a grown ass man who has seen a p**** or 2 in his life, I'm looking for something more with my dramas like... moving the story forward, as well as developing 1 of the 100 characters this show has brought into the fold rather than staring at boobies & wieners every episode. If I wanted that... I'd pop in a porno, which has more of a point than GoT sex scenes.... G'dammit!

1734	Osric	2014-04-28	This episode was awesome, I personally don't mind the "spoilers" because those are things that we almost knew for a fact. Right at the moment that Rast took the baby out I was almost praying for a white walker ritual, then it happened at the end... I was so excited.Â 
Â 
As for the show taking a separated way from the books, it is not true, the main story lines are the same and all the changes are starting to make sense, and book readers need to not know what's happening in order to keep them (us) interested. So if some arch of the books is changed by the end of the show, imho, it would be good, I wouldn't mind an "alternative ending" for the show, and a "real ending" for the books - which I think it's what is going to happen as GRRM is not getting those books finished - Â as long as they both are good. Although even if both endings are the same, I'll still buy the dvd's and the books

1736	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	I've got two points to make in regardes to the common criticisms I'm seeing in this thread.
Sam broke his promise to Bran and told Jon he is alive!
	Sam never made a promise to Bran in the show, in the books he made his promise to Coldhands and Coldhands isn't in the show. Not yet at least. Nobody ever asked Sam to keep it a secret so there is no reason to expect him to not tell Jon that his younger brother, whom is believed dead, is in fact alive.
	This doesn't mean Roose is going to find out. You guys are saying that because Jon knows Bran is alive Roose's claim to the North is lessened and Stannis' Jon Stark plan is pointless? Why would either Jon or Sam tell Roose that Bran is alive? And Stannis' plan was turned down anyways. I doubt Jon will be sending ravens across Westeros to let everyone know that "my crippled little brother is on the other side of the wall, so please don't try to steal Winterfell." That's ludacris and nobody would believe it. Besides, the Watch takes no part.
	There is nothing important in the books regarding Jon not knowing about Bran.
	They made the Wildlings evil!
	I'm going to preface my point by saying that the cannibalism thing is quite cheesy and I don't like it. However, you're still incorrect. The Wildlings weren't made to be bad guys at all, the Thenn's were never good guys anyways. They aren't free folk, the Thenns are organized and ruthless. Tormen wasn't made evil, he clearly doesn't like the nasty shit Thenns do and neither does Ygritte. Rattleshirt is an ass in the show, but he is one in the books. And Mance wasn't made very evil either. This complaint just confuses me.
	Â 
I think a lot of the criticism towards this episode stems from book readers not being able to cope with change. Somebody earlier said that Jon going to Craster's and Bran being at Craster's was a mess. It's not a mess, it's called a story. It's not convoluted at all and everything makes sense. The mutineers at Craster's were completely forgotten about in the books, Jon wanting to deal with them makes sense. Bran hearing a baby in the woods and wanting to investigate makes sense. The mutineers being total douchebags makes sense, they're criminals sent to the wall that betrayed their Lord Commander. This adds more danger and excitement to Bran's story, since he doesn't do much for a good long while and even by the end of A Dance With Dragons he hasn't done much.Â Jon doesn't do much either, right now he's basically just waiting for Stannis. Granted Ygritte and company's attack on Castle Black has yet to happen, but you know it's coming.
Â 
As for the White Walker at the end, we all knew the show was going to go past the books. The show is slated for 7 seasons, that's three and a half more after next week to cover the rest of A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, A Dance With Dragons, The Winds of Winter, and the final book. Things are going to get condensed, fat is going to get trimmed, and winter is likely going to come a little quicker. You can't honestly expect the show to put itself on hold to wait for GRRM to take another 10 years to finish the series.
1737	gash	2014-04-28	people should realise too that the tv show chronology is approaching a feast for crows now which we all know would not suit tv due to it's meandering pace. large changes are not just a good idea, they are a necessity.

You FOOLS! You don't see it?
Â 
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
Â 
HE'S TRYING TO GET TO WINTERFELL, AND THAT STUPID WALL KEEPS BLOCKING THEM! TEAR IT DOWN!
Â 
Seriously, what lurks in the depths of Winterfell? The last piece of the puzzle, is what's down there.
Â 
n00bs.
Â 
Â 
The female Other, is down there. Locked, or buried. The Night's King is trying to get there 
Â 
Watch me be right, just watch. Seriously, watch that actually fucking happen. The Night's King's female Other is locked in the crypts of Winterfell, by some form of magick. He's been trying to get there forever.
Â 
Why are the walls in winterfell always so warm? Well, it could be a hotsprings theory, or whatever.
Â 
Or...
Â 
It's that female Other, absorbing all the cold, trying to empower herself to break the fuck out of those crypts and reunite with The Night's King.

You nailed it my friendÂ
1740	Blazfemur	2014-04-28	Honestly though, i truly feel i enjoyed the majority of the changes theyve done, and for the most part ive been able to spot and catch them as they happen. the only change im not satisfied with, is the exclusion of Coldhands, and we dont even know if that is definite (i can still see him rescuing Bran/co. from ex-nights watch rebels and continuing journey to bloodraven).
1741	Little Lord F***pants	2014-04-28	Â 
so there's no point in the sex scenes in the tv show? what about the books? would you do away with all them as well?
It's not about doing away with them. It's about moving the story forward. If the story calls for it, like Theon getting his little Theon chopped off; finding out siblings are banging; Dany being the dominant one in bed with Drogo; Jon losing his virginity, etc. That all adds to the story. They ad to the characters. It's the 95% other crap that doesn't.
Martin has free reign when it comes to writing his books. He can spend as much time as he likes with his perverted fantasies. Whereas the showrunners have less than 10 hrs a season to tell a story that's already crammed with enough characters as it is & they add as many, if not more than they kill off.
1742	ToTheWolves	2014-04-28	Â 
I quoted this because it needs to be seen. I love the books and would hate the show to overpass the books but sometimes purists get carried away with there neediness.
Â 
Inb4 insuing butthurt

Agreed.

Â 
Now that's a theory I could dig! 
Â 
About the episode:
Â 
For once I really loved the changes. I always found that frustrating that Sam didn't tell Jon about Bran or that Bran and Jon were so close but didn't meet.
Now I am scared what these changes might do to the rest of the story, but as standalone scenes they were pretty great.
Â 
We all know book Bran's journey in the north is quite boring until he meets CotF. It's just got more interesting.
Â 
I still think Bran and co. will never be found by Jon and co., because that would spread some serious mess over the upcoming Stannis storyline, though.
Â 
Absolutely loved that we got to get a glimpse at things absent in the books. I loved it how deep north the show has taken us. I effin loved that White Walker turning the baby into a baby White Walker.
Â 
I love the books and I usually cringe at the changes, but that episode was a winner. Excellent.
1744	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-04-28	Whenever the episode focused on Jaime, I was enjoying it. I didn't need that tWoW/aDoS-spoiler.
Â 


Early in the episode, Sam said something to Jon about Bran. Â I yelled, "WTF?! Â Sam made a promise in the book not to tell anyone that Bran was still alive." Â  Now I'm worried about how this will change everything in the North. Â All of the battles, etc - including Roose's claim to the North is that all of the Starks are dead.


Â 
Roose's claim stems from Tywin making him Warden of the North and demotion of the House Stark by the Lannisters after the death of King Robb. Technically, Bran is King in the North, but he isn't actively taking part in the liberation movement so the movement is still squashed.

And as others say: the Watch takes no part, until the Bastard Letter..
Â 


I'm not pleased with the fact that it seems the TV show just spoiled the unreleased book. With Martins comments about going deeper into the North than we ever have before in TWOW, I imagine we find out where Crasters sons go, or what happens to them...welp, now I already know.Â 
Â 
The show is good. The books are better. If that is a spoler I may have to stop watching the show. I love the show but I can't have an altered adapation ruin a story that's been in the making for twenty years.


Â 
I agree. I've never downloaded a GoT-episode. I honestly didn't know about it when the show came on, saw the first episode in a college course. Liked it, bought the first season dvd-box and when I finished that, the second season came out on dvd. I started reading the books, waited a year and bought the season 3 dvd-box. Now there's a HBO-discount special for 4 months half price, so I'm on with that. You can't retake the offer if you've had it less then a year ago and I'm not willing to pay full price. Meaning that I'll have to wait two years until the season 5 dvd box comes out. By that time, my patience will have grown thin, but tWoW will have come out.
Â 


Bran at Crasters is a good arc that I don't mind but goddamnit that Others spoiler.


Â 
Completely agree. The Bran plot doesn't really change anything, aside from Coldhands taking care of the rogue mutineers, if Bran and Jon don't meet up. And it explains why Ghost took so long to get to Castle Black. Who knows, the mutineers may scatter after Bran wargs into Hodor and breaks free. Then they may meet with CH's and they have that moment in which Bran realizes that CH's has picked off the remaining mutineers (seeing their corpses through summer).
Â 
The last scene was an unnessary addition.Â  I really loathe it.
Â 


I didn't dislike the episode, but after every week I start to feel more and more like a book snob. I don't like that feeling since almost everyone I know are show only, so I just hope the payoff works out well enough with the story. Here's to hoping.


Â 
I feel the same, I really loved the simple changes they made to Jaime's/Brienne's/Pod's storyline this week. Everything Jaime this week was spot on, even if it didn't correlate with the books.
Â 


Â 
No.Â  IN the books, Coldhands only kills wrights to rescue Sam and then when they are attackd just as they get to Bloodravenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cave.Â  There is not â<U+0080><U+009C>Showdown at Crasters.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  Not that that would have made it better; had the scene been in the books Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d have also thought it contrived.


Â 
No. IN the books, Coldhands deals with "foes" he refuses to name and goes looking for food while the Reeds, Bran and Hodor are shivering in a hut somewhere near a lake. Bran wargs into Summer and finds dead Night's Watch bodies, eats that, and that's when Coldhand's returns with 'meat' of dubious origin himself..
Â 


It's because there's no point to it. That's why it's called "gratuitous". And the fact that I'm a grown ass man who has seen a p**** or 2 in his life, I'm looking for something more with my dramas like... moving the story forward, as well as developing 1 of the 100 characters this show has brought into the fold rather than staring at boobies & wieners every episode. If I wanted that... I'd pop in a porno, which has more of a point than GoT sex scenes.... G'dammit!


Â 
You didn't answer the question.. It's "gratuitous" in the books as well. So apparently, despite your claim of being a grown ass man, you have an issue with visual sex, but not written sex, while both are gratuitous. You don't want gratuitous sex, just say so. Go read 50Shades of Grey or whatever..

Â 
I'm sorry, but with the rate their going through aSoSp2, it is clear that they are fully able to condense whatever storylines of Feast/Dance in season 5. Leaving whatever comes in Winds and Dream for S6/7. There was no need at all to bring in the Night's King of all things at this point in time.. They're covering the stuff from book 3 and parts of 4/5. There's no need to jump from a scene that happened in Book 3, to a scene that has direct relevance to Book 6. The gap they're jumping is far, far too wide and it will only make the storylines more disjointed then they already are..

Â 
No.
Â 
Plenty of changes from the book have been worthwhile; its when the changes are dead or convoluted that draws ire. Â Yeah, sure, some people are just the Ultra-purists and you can't satisfy them; they want a 50 hour season with a virtually unlimited budget. Â 
Â 
My complaint is when the story is overrun by contrivance. Â Here its having Bran end up at this place that ... just so happens to be where Jon wanted the NW to attack? Â Quelle Suprise!Â And it just so happens that Bran was... right there....Â 
Â 
And that Ghost is there. Â Why? Â How'd they catch him? For what purpose? Â Any idea? Â Anyone? Anyone? Â Bueler? Â 
Â 
It makes no sense. Â It only makes sense if the GOAL was to get everyone there because... well.. you are paying these people anyway and you need to put SOMETHING on that screen. Â So ... you sort of contrive to put all these pieces together. Â And for me, that's pedestrian, low-level story-telling that I would expect out of, say, the last two seasons of BS:G or Lost. Â 
Â 
Now I agree and I am with you on the deserters being a bunch of horrible people who do horrible things. Â I think that showing the depravity that can be let-loose when the rules no longer apply; when laws, even customs, are tossed aside in favor of the pure anarchy of "Strongest Man Makes the Rules" can create a type of barbarism and chaos. Â That I thought was fine. Â IN fact, I think it set the right tone: the realms of man needs to defend itself not only from Others and WW but from the type of anarchy. Â 
Â 
But why involve Bran, OTHER THAN because ... well... you gotta do something with him....Â 
Â 
Its forced. Â Contrived, ham-fisted story-telling. Â Its lazy and lacks depth, prospective and creativity. Â It turned a complex story into a story that relies on "Well... who's in the general area..." Its something I would expect from a network show. Â 
Â 
But other than that, it was fine...Â
1746	Bimmerella	2014-04-28	I think we need to keep in mind, that there are things that develop in the tv series, that are organic and require adjustments.  By that I mean some of the brilliant performances by the actors, that bring depth and interest to these characters that just didn't happen in the book.  Brans arc, at least for the show, definitely needed to be altered a bit in order to make it more interesting for the tv screen.  I'm looking for some of the same for Arya and Jon.  Then there are other unexpected performances that have become fan "pets".  Bronn, Davos, GREY WORM, Pod, the Hound Little Finger, Varys.  
As for the last scene of this episode, I'm not feeling all butt hurt, like some are, I guess because as far as the Others and the land of always winter, we HAVE had information about this, through different stories so, that,  we have had a clue about, and this scene at the end, is just a visual and it still leaves a TON of questions. The TV only people dont have nearly as much of a clue about that last scene as we readers do. All my friends that know I've read the books blew up my phone wanting clues......
1747	Jennelyn	2014-04-28	I agree, this was a really good episode. I was gaping at the ending, but honestly I like it when the show keeps me guessing when I think I know what's going to happen. The WW scene was NOT a spoiler in my opinion. This is nothing that has not been hinted at in the books. The show just has a way of hitting us upside the head with it is all.
Â 
I also am fine with Jon snow going after the mutineers at Craster's. And I don't see Sam telling Jon about Bran as being all that altering either. I don't think he swore anything to Bran on the show, just the books. I also don't think they will meet. It seems more likely that they will just miss each other. Perhaps Coldhands will finally make an entrance? Whatever happens, we'll anticipate a meeting and be afraid of Locke getting his grubby hands on Bran, but it won't quite happen.
Â 
As for Ghost, I have no idea how they caught him and it did come out of nowhere, but I'm interested to see who's throat he tears out when he gets free.
1748	awesome possum	2014-04-28	As someone who first picked up A Game of Thrones in 1999 and has been anxiously looking forward to seeing A Song of Ice and Fire brought to television since the first rumors of HBO and George RR Martin talking, I didn't hate it.Â  I completely understand why they made the changes with Bran as he needs something to do and I like having Jon go after the mutineers (thought those arrow wounds must have been pretty superficial).Â  I don't know how I feel about Jon and Bran meeting though I know it will be bittersweet.Â  I did not like Sam telling Jon about Bran.Â 
Â 
I think I have an inkling as to what they're doing with Locke.Â  I can see him volunteering to accompany Bran after they part ways and Jon heads back to the Wall and then somehow getting information about Rickon before deciding to let Bran go.Â  He'll figure why kill the kid when he seems set on getting himself killed.Â  I only say that because I'd like to see Rickon and Osha back sooner than... whenever.Â 
Â 
And of the course the end... I still don't know what to make of that.Â  Except it brought a feeling out full force, an old familiar feeling, like you're standing on the edge of a gulf and don't know what's below.Â  This is uncharted territory and that is amazing if you understand the books and television series as two nearly identical but still separate tellings of the same story.Â
1749	Bohemund	2014-04-28	I'll be honest, I enjoyed the changes from the books, and as long as they make sense, I don't mind seeing other small changes. I find it refreshing to see another take on ASOIAF, and to see some aspects that we never saw in the books, like that great scene in Crasters keep.
1750	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	Plenty of changes from the book have been worthwhile; its when the changes are dead or convoluted that draws ire. Â Yeah, sure, some people are just the Ultra-purists and you can't satisfy them; they want a 50 hour season with a virtually unlimited budget.

You bring up a lot of points so I'm going to try and address all of them. I want to comment on this with a bit of preface. I like a lot of the changes the show makes, but not all. The way they handled the sack of Winterfell, Theon's capture, and adding repetitive torture scenes was unforgivable. They fucked that up so bad. But say, replacing Roose at Harrenhall with Tywin made for a much more interesting dynamic between Arya and her captor.
Â 
Â 

My complaint is when the story is overrun by contrivance. Â Here its having Bran end up at this place that ... just so happens to be where Jon wanted the NW to attack? Â Quelle Suprise!Â And it just so happens that Bran was... right there....

It's not that far fetched when you think about it. The gate Bran and company went through likely wasn't far THAT from Castle Black (if anyone can show it on a map I'd appreciate it), and there is only one direction they can go. North. That's the same way Craster is/was. It's not like they showed up right at Craster's place, they heard a baby wailing. Sound travels and based on how nobody saw their fire, the sound travelled quite far. They also leave the baby out away from Craster's actual place. It's a coincidence, yes. But no more contrived than Jon and his free folk just happening to cross paths with Bran at that tower, which DOES happen in the books.
Â 
Characters happening to cross paths, realizing it or not, is very common in the books. It's one of GRRM's favourite tricks.
Â 
Â 

And that Ghost is there. Â Why? Â How'd they catch him? For what purpose? Â Any idea? Â Anyone? Anyone? Â Bueler?Â 

No refuting here, that's a plothole through and through. But the problem with plotholes is that the more you try to explain them and pick at them the wider they get. How does a medeival society surivive years of winter? Real life medeival society could barely survive months? Any idea? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? I'm not saying a plothole is immune to criticism, merely saying that yes they do exist and no we shouldn't think to hard on them.
Â 
Â 

It makes no sense. Â It only makes sense if the GOAL was to get everyone there because... well.. you are paying these people anyway and you need to put SOMETHING on that screen. Â So ... you sort of contrive to put all these pieces together. Â And for me, that's pedestrian, low-level story-telling that I would expect out of, say, the last two seasons of BS:G or Lost. Â 

All I'll say to this is, do you really want to bring up something lacking a sense of direction in A Song of Ice and Fire? Do you reeeeeeally want to do that?
Â 
Â 

But why involve Bran, OTHER THAN because ... well... you gotta do something with him....Â 
Â 
Its forced. Â Contrived, ham-fisted story-telling. Â Its lazy and lacks depth, prospective and creativity. Â It turned a complex story into a story that relies on "Well... who's in the general area..." Its something I would expect from a network show.


I think you're overreacting, I don't see how replacing the chapters of Bran being cold, hungry, and day dreaming about Meera's bum with him being captured by the mutineers (which, in the books, were practically forgotten) turns a "complex story" into a simple one.
Â 

But other than that, it was fine...Â 

Oh well, nevermind then.
Â

The gap they're jumping is far, far too wide and it will only make the storylines more disjointed then they already are..

All I want to say to you is that the Others were never handled well. Always stupid, and would have been better if they never even made it into the books. It's such a detached and uninteresting storyline, once every book they show up and we're reminded that "Oooh, zombies are coming!" and then it's back to incest and intrigue. Pulling Others and White Walker stuff back to earlier portions of the story is not a bad idea in fact it's probably how GRRM should have done it from the get-go.
Â 
It's too early to really criticize that scene, as we don't know how much more of it we'll be seeing in future episodes. If that turns into the White Walker's token appearance I'll eat my words, but if they're trying to set them up to seem more relevant I won't complain.
1751	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-28	This was a brilliant episode. Â I friggin' loved it! Â Everything! Â Even Dany's stuff was great. Â Much better. Â This show just keeps getting better.
Â 
Loved the Craster's Keep madness. Â (Yes, Karl was pushing the envelope, but I bought it. Â They're hungry, desperate rapists who know they're not going to live much longer.) Â Loved the Castle Black plotting, and Locke weaving himself into the mix.
Â 
I loved the White Walker at the end. Â So beautifully shot. Â All quiet and creepy. Â No music. Â No words. Â Let the moment speak for itself.
Â 
I don't miss Coldhands. Â I know many book fans do. Â I don't need more chapters with Bran talking about talking to trees or green dreaming. Â I just love what the producers are doing with all the changes.
Â 
After I was very let down by Dany's preachy scene at the end of Episode 3, this episode was amazing. Â From top to bottom. Â The Dany takeover of Mereen was great - the Targaryen flag and the armed mobs killing ppl.
Â 
No Ramsay giggling, no Eric Bana Daario mumbling. Â Even without Oberyn and Arya, this was an amazing episode.
Â 
As for the White Walker/baby spoiler - huh? Â The White Walkers have to use babies for one of two things - either they eat babies, or turn them into more White Walkers. Â So I didn't feel spoiled at all.
Â 
King's Landing - Diana Rigg - god damn, she's amazing. Â  I could watch The Queen of Thorns write "Thank you" cards. Â The Queen of Thorns actually ADMITTED she killed Joffrey! Â Great. Â We don't ALWAYS need GRRM's customary cute "everything is grey" language - just a steely stare with "Oh, IÂ knowÂ Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey." Â Loved Margaery's gentle seduction of Tommen. Â Ser Pounce sighting! Loved the shot of sweet lil Tommen in crazy Joffrey's giant bedroom with the arrow-filled animal trophies. Â The Jaime/Brienne/Bronn/Tyrion dynamic was brilliant.
Â 
Does anyone really wish mute Ilyn Payne was training with Jaime vs. smart-mouthed Bronn?Â 
Â 
Just an amazing episode.
Â 
This is the best show ever seen by human eyeballs. Â Yes, including Breaking Bad. Â That's right - I said it.
Â 
Now I have to re-watch it. Â Hush now...
Â 
The End.

1752	Little Lord F***pants	2014-04-28	You didn't answer the question.. It's "gratuitous" in the books as well. So apparently, despite your claim of being a grown ass man, you have an issue with visual sex, but not written sex, while both are gratuitous. You don't want gratuitous sex, just say so. Go read 50Shades of Grey or whatever.. 

Oh my god... I replied to this like 10 posts before this. And what makes you think I've read the books? And also... I've heard people complain about far more interesting things the show has cut or deviated from the books, so why must they show gratuitous sex just because it's that way in the books? And it's not that they show it. Every premium cable show has gratuitous sex every now & then. It's that they show it ALL... THE... TIME!
1753	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-28	Side note: Do you think True Blood fans say, "I really miss those classic scenes from the books! Â But the books are so big and rich I understand they had to make cuts."

They show gratuitous sex for two reasons.
It's part of the story, it's part of the books, it belongs in the show.
	It's HBO and tits make people watch.
You're admitting to having not read the books so (for starters if you haven't been entirely spoiled already please leave) real discussion here is pointless. You would be amazed how much the sex has been toned down in the show compared to the books. Some tits and dicks have been added to certain scenes where they haven't before (looking at you Oberyn, you horny devil) but it hardly mattered (in Oberyn's case it actually made sense) and if you really can't stand this kind of stuff you really shouldn't be watching Game of Thrones.

It's not that far fetched when you think about it. The gate Bran and company went through likely wasn't far THAT from Castle Black (if anyone can show it on a map I'd appreciate it), and there is only one direction they can go. North. That's the same way Craster is/was. It's not like they showed up right at Craster's place, they heard a baby wailing. Sound travels and based on how nobody saw their fire, the sound travelled quite far. They also leave the baby out away from Craster's actual place. It's a coincidence, yes. But no more contrived than Jon and his free folk just happening to cross paths with Bran at that tower, which DOES happen in the books.
Â 


Â 
It is because of how close Nightfort is to Castle Black. Essentially the distance is roughly equivalent if not shorter to the distance from Castle Black to Crasters. In fact, Crasters is closer to Nightfort than it is to Castle Black. NIghtfort is number 8 http://img1.wikia.no...he_Wall_Map.PNG
Â 
If you just think about the fact that Bran left Sam likely a day or two before Jon arrives at Castle Black wounded. If I remember correctly, Sam is at Castle Black when Jon arrives. Jon is now healthy, what sort of time has passed? 1 month? 2, maybe more? You are telling me that Jon can travel the same distance Bran can travel in a one month or more in just a few days? That just doesn't add up. Especially since Crasters isn't too far in the show either 40 or 60 miles. I don't quite remember which it was.
Â 
Essentially they should never end up at a place that close to both exit points on the wall within a similar time frame. It just doesn't make sense for that to happen. Could Bran have had an escapade at Crasters without Jon being involved? Sure, that could make sense.

I guess you don't read the True Blood threads.
1757	rocksniffer	2014-04-28	It's because there's no point to it. That's why it's called "gratuitous". And the fact that I'm a grown ass man who has seen a p**** or 2 in his life, I'm looking for something more with my dramas like... moving the story forward, as well as developing 1 of the 100 characters this show has brought into the fold rather than staring at boobies & wieners every episode. If I wanted that... I'd pop in a porno, which has more of a point than GoT sex scenes.... G'dammit!


Â 
was going to say thing smart-assed here about pussies, boobies and wieners... but instead i chose these two quotes because they sum it up so eloquently i could not hope to top them....
Â 


Â 
so there's no point in the sex scenes in the tv show? what about the books? would you do away with all them as well?

Jon isn't there yet, he might be next episode but lets slow down. Bran and company may escape before Jon arrives. Realistically they'd be moving much slower too. Bran and company are being careful, they're not trying to make it somewhere in great haste, simply trying to make it somewhere. Meera is the only one physically fit to travel large stretches. Bran is a cripple, Jojen has his fits, and Hodor is a simpleton.
Â 
Jon will be riding to Craster's with great haste, and he'll be doing it on horseback. He likely won't be stopping for much rest or to eat.
Â 
It's not a perfect story arc, but I don't think two seasons full of Bran running around and licking his own junk as Summer will make for very good television. Bran does shit all north of the wall, even when he finds the Three-eyed Crow. Giving him some more interesting plot is not a bad thing, it's a good thing.
Â 
Everyone is so quick to criticize A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons but the moment the show starts to change the story to avoid the same issues you guys attack it like the source material was the greatest story ever written.
1759	Fragile Bird	2014-04-28	Â 
Sam never made a promise to Bran in the show.


Â 
Uh, yes, I know that. Â The whole point of the comment was he didn't tell Jon in the books.


Â 
My dearest Fragile Bird, i find myself disagreeing with the premise that making changes somehow lessens D&D's respect and understanding of the story...sure people always get annoyed...myself included...when a filmmaker changes important parts of a story ( i am reminded of Cujo and the fate of the boy)...but i do not think the books are inviolate. In fact i am of the opinion that several of the changes have enhanced my appreciation for the story and its rich texture.Â 
Â 
...as for Robb and Jeyne, i didn't get that change but in the grand scheme i guess it hasn't impacted me that much. And like you, i also believe the journey is at least as important as the end result, if not more so, Â that being said i am not sure that my desire to read the final books has been lessened by what the show has changed or revealed about the paths taken by the main characters...
Â 
...just more mutterings from your favorite salty old asshole.... Â  


Â 
Don't get me wrong, I can see the reason why many changes were made, as Rockroi said, many make sense. Â People hated Ros with a passion, because frankly they used her for a few of those gratuitous sex scenes everyone is mentioning, which just got tiresome. Â But in the end we saw, through Ros, how utterly ruthless Littlefinger is and how sick Joff was. Â And D&D got their quotient of T&A in.
Â 
And oh my goodness, 471 posts, 'sniffer! Â At this rate you may be able to hit 700 by the end of the year - I told you to open some threads! 


If I recall correctly, he never made any such promise on the show. That was book only.


Â 
Yup.


Should we worry too much about the fact that Jon knows about Bran? They might not meet. Jon might be led to believe Bran is dead in some other way, restoring things to roughly how they are. Or, in the books, Jon and Bran might meet in future. As they say, the roads may be different but the destination is the same.


Toft, my problem with this is the fact that we have a certain kind of character in Samwell. Â He's trustworthy and honourable and when he makes a promise...well, unless Gilly is all over him or he's told he'll be thrown overboard and will have to swim to shore...he can be relied on. Â Bran is on a mission, and as much as he wants to see family members, he did not want anyone to know he was alive.
Â 


I've got two points to make in regardes to the common criticisms I'm seeing in this thread.
Sam broke his promise to Bran and told Jon he is alive!
	Sam never made a promise to Bran in the show, in the books he made his promise to Coldhands and Coldhands isn't in the show. Not yet at least. Nobody ever asked Sam to keep it a secret so there is no reason to expect him to not tell Jon that his younger brother, whom is believed dead, is in fact alive.
	This doesn't mean Roose is going to find out. You guys are saying that because Jon knows Bran is alive Roose's claim to the North is lessened and Stannis' Jon Stark plan is pointless? Why would either Jon or Sam tell Roose that Bran is alive? And Stannis' plan was turned down anyways. I doubt Jon will be sending ravens across Westeros to let everyone know that "my crippled little brother is on the other side of the wall, so please don't try to steal Winterfell." That's ludacris and nobody would believe it. Besides, the Watch takes no part.
	There is nothing important in the books regarding Jon not knowing about Bran.


Yes, I know Sam did not promise in the show. 
Â 
But you should re-read Jon's chapters if you think there's nothing important in the books regarding Jon not knowing about Bran.
Â 


Â 
No.
Â 
Plenty of changes from the book have been worthwhile; its when the changes are dead or convoluted that draws ire. Â Yeah, sure, some people are just the Ultra-purists and you can't satisfy them; they want a 50 hour season with a virtually unlimited budget. Â 
Â 
My complaint is when the story is overrun by contrivance. Â Here its having Bran end up at this place that ... just so happens to be where Jon wanted the NW to attack? Â Quelle Suprise!Â And it just so happens that Bran was... right there....Â 
Â
1760	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-28	I am OUTRAGED and/or THRILLED by the changes from the books! Â The books shall NEVER be changed! Â Unless they are filler like A Feast for Crows, in which case CHANGE EVERYTHING!Â Â
1761	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	But you should re-read Jon's chapters if you think there's nothing important in the books regarding Jon not knowing about Bran.


Oh yeah, he's really torn up about it and him not knowing was always a very heartbreaking thing for me. But all those inner monologues weren't going to make the show anyways. Will it actually have relevance to the plot is what I'm saying. Will Jon do something in the books that he would not have done in any other way if he had known about Bran? So far, no. Jon probably won't tell anyone, he'll turn down Stannis same as he did in the books. But this time his reasoning will secretly be because he knows he isn't the last son of Eddard.
Â 
Sam's promise was related to Coldhands more than it was related to Bran. Things will change as a result of Jon knowing, but well... do I really even need to say that?

Â 
It isn't interesting, it is poor writing. Anyway it doesn't really matter. Bran won't be doing nothing for 2 seasons. His story arch from the books is caught up by the end of this season, you can tell by the episode titles. There is no reason for Bran and Jon to have another near meeting, which will likely mirror their past one (Jon's attack on Crasters aids Brans escape mimics Brans presence that lends Summers aid to Jon so he can escape the wildlings). At least that is what I expect to happen.
Â 
The whole idea that Bran can move at the pace of a mile a day or less is silly. That is the pace he would have to go for Jon to be even remotely close in this timeline. Walk the length of a mall twice and you have that distance. Whatever disadvantages the party needs to overcome that isn't asking much for a days work. I just don't see how that can just be dismissed. And it doesn't even matter if Jon shows up a week later from Bran's escape, the timeline is just so poorly thought out. Jon was near death. The problem is that he had to be healed from a near death experience and following that he putzes around for awhile at Castle Black.After that, all of a sudden he is able to Â catch up to Bran in a few days or just misses him. Logistically it shouldn't happen or even be close. That is an oversight that shouldn't happen. Make Bran be captured episodes earlier, at least it could make sense within the timeline. It isn't a matter of changing things to avoid problems from the books. Bran isn't a major player in books 4 and 5, he has like 3 chapters total. If the show would follow his arch he would have 3 scenes of him walking/warging and end up with bloodraven.Â 
Â 
I don't personally like this story arch of Bran, Ghost and Jon all to end up in the same place. I don't really want to argue that, because it is a matter of taste and will change person to person. But based on the timeline this meeting or near meeting should never take place. That can, I believe, be argued based upon the distances from the map and what time has transpired from Sam and Bran's parting.Â

Craster-whoever he is, or who's blood he has, was either sacrificing to retain his position or was part of a pact that has been going on for generations.
Everything else doesn't matter.

as to changes and especially Roz, i not only found her to be funny at times but also she was a consolidation of all the working girls that were in the books...never understood why people hated but i never do...and i completely agree that she was very useful in revelations about several of the main characters, including Tryion, Varys and Theon early on...

while i don't necessarily agree that nothing else mattered, i do agree that the WW reveal was very important, How IS Craster and his blood line involved and who knew...i get the feeling now that Morrmont knew the true nature of what was happening

I don't disagree with you that Bran's location is not realistic. I tried to offer some explanation but as I've said regarding another matter in this thread, picking at a plothole looking for explanations only makes it bigger. That's all that is, it's a plothole. A quite minor one at that.
Â 
You say it's poorly written, but I counter that by saying A Song of Ice and Fire is also poorly written. Yes, I said it. A Song of Ice and Fire is a convoluted mess. It has way too many plot lines, many of which don't seem to be leading anywhere and a few seem to be leading to the icy zombie apocalypse which sounds quite boring compared to intrigue and political scheming. But A Song of Ice and Fire is also very entertaining, as most of it's meaningless storylines entertain me. Because that is what this is, entertainment.
Â 
Bran's chapters would be impossible to faithfully represent in the show, and any attempt would bore the audience more than Bran's chapters bored me. They're shaking it up with more danger, more action, more immediate pay-off. A system that works well for TV. A plot hole might crop up, and the show has never paid much heed to the geography. But the books aren't completely innocent of doing this either, teleporting ships anyone?
Â 
To restate my point as simply as possible, I don't think criticism is unwarranted and I don't think these changes were perfect. But I do think that you have to be honest and fair. The precious source material is not as good as purists will make us believe, and most of the changes to the show are not as bad as people act like they are. You have to take into consideration the medium, audience, and time frame when looking at what the show does and why.
1767	Ser Blake	2014-04-29	I don't understand how people are saying the stuff at Crasters is pointless. Â By showing the Karl drinking out of Mormonts skull you are reminding the viewer of what a monster this guy is. Â Same thing with the rape in Crasters. Â The point is to make the viewers hate all these terrible mutineers that way they when Jon and the Nights Watch finally arrive and kill them, the audience will be cheering for the heroes like they should be. Â Its no different than how the book handled the Mountain. Â When you hear the "gratuitous" story about him raping the inn keepers daughter the desired affect is that you will hate him even more and cheer heavily for Oberyn in the big trial by combat. Â 
Â 
I just don't understand some of y'alls logic. Â According to some of you when characters randomly/luckily happen to be in the same location at the same time in the books its considered great writing but when it happens just in the show everyone says its contrived and lazy bad writing. Â For example:
Â 
Tyrion and Catelyn Stark at the Inn at the crossroads
Jon and Bran at Queenscrown
Arya arriving at the Twins JUST as the Red Wedding starts
Â 
Apparently fine and great writing but the potential of Jon and Bran meeting at Crasters is just too much to handle. Â I feel like people are confusing new and different with bad and lazy. Â The majority of the people complaining are book purists, and while there is nothing wrong with that you still need to try and remain open minded. Â I just think that too many people on here are treating the books and untouchable while ignoring the fact that they have faults as well.
Â 
If you want to complain then complain about the mutineers having captured Ghost. Because that is kind of fucking stupid. Â I'm assuming they used the same sort of trap they used on summer but he doesn't appear to be in a hole so idk. Â Honestly though I'm no really a fan of how they've handled Ghost as a whole. Â I know the direwolves cost a lot of money but still. Â In season 2 he just randomly ditched Jon and went back to hang out with the other Nights Watch people. Â I just feel like the show could have really benefited from a Jon/Ghost goodbye scene.
1768	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	AFFC is the best book but the worst book to adapt into the format of this show
1769	ground_control	2014-04-29	I just don't understand some of y'alls logic.

The problem is that the book scenes you mentioned could be random, but Bran & Co at Crasters should NOT have happened...Sam met Bran and Co while fleeing from Crasters, knowing what had happened there...so when Sam helps Bran and Co get through The Wall, that's the one place they should already know not to go. Â And, when they do go there, they shouldn't be surprised at what they find.
Â 
Unless we're supposed to believe that when Sam led them through The Wall, he "forgot" to tell them about Craster.
1770	protar	2014-04-29	What I don't understand, is if they wanted some early-mid season action at the Wall, why not just have the Battle at Castle Black that actually happens? Having Ygritte's death here instead of the fun, but ultimately meaningless stuff at Craster's would have worked a lot better.
1771	Miodrag	2014-04-29	They show gratuitous sex for two reasons.
It's part of the story, it's part of the books, it belongs in the show.


Â 
No, gratuitous sex scenes aren't part of the books. As far as I can recall, each and every sex scene in the novels had some meaning and purpose, like depicting sides of characters involved. Were all of those scenes necessary? Well, hardly anything is necessary in storytelling, and one can argue that GRRM could've picture, say, Cersei's "I weep for my son but I didn't actually care too much about him" feeling in some other way; but, he chose her lust, which is totally legitimate, and also dramatically purposeful because of Jaime's return and his struggle to change. With so many stuff happening in the books, could be I'm forgetting something, but at the moment I can't think of any sex scene in the novels that was gratuitous.
Â 

You would be amazed how much the sex has been toned down in the show compared to the books.

Â 
Again, no. Just no. Percentage wise, sex scenes are much, much smaller than in the show. They rarely stretch for more than a passage or two. Truth be told, I think the writing in some of those scenes is GRRM's worst, but even with that, it's not a suffer to read through them. And there are fewer sex scenes to begin with. And it's all happening in big books, that contain infinitely more material (of all kinds) than a 10 hour TV season. And, once again, none of GRRM's sex scenes was without a purpose.
Â 

Some tits and dicks have been added to certain scenes where they haven't before (looking at you Oberyn, you horny devil) but it hardly mattered (in Oberyn's case it actually made sense) and if you really can't stand this kind of stuff you really shouldn't be watching Game of Thrones.

Â 
There, you said it. The show is practically defined by its sex scenes. There are sex scenes in "The Sopranos", "True Detective", "The Wire", but those shows aren't defined by those scenes. "Game of Thrones" pretty much is. And that is not a clever storytelling, let alone a brave storytelling. It's catering basic/primal/lower human needs in order to reach the widest possible audience. A good drama it isn't.

This is simply not true. All the millions of people watching around the world are watching for manyÂ varied reasons.

It simply would not be surviving if the resulting small audience was there just for that reason and that reason alone. Take a look on Tumblr, Twitter or other blogs and you will see (or more likely ignore) what other things fans and viewers generally are enjoying about the show.

From what I've seen, the general public's view on Game of Thrones is that it's filled with gratuitous nudity. I can barely have a conversation about it with my friends or family without some joke about the amount of boobs coming up. Obviously the show is watched for reasons other than the nudity, but the sex scenes have become quite memetic and that's not a good thing imo.

Yes, I have found this too, but almost exclusively by people who are not actively watching it -Â they have just heard that the sex & nudity is what it's about,Â or have tried a couple and it's just not their thing anyway. I get the response 'I don't want to watch anything with dragons' about the same amount, and they won't listen eitherÂ when I say there's much more too it than that. Not everything is for everyone.

I agree, although my friends and family do watch the show and the jokes are still there. And it begs the question - if most viewers aren't watching the show for the nudity, why do D+D insist on scenes whose primary purpose is titillation rather than the more plot meaningful sex scenes in the books? In the show any plot relevant sex scenes are usually:
a.) from the books or
b.) provide some form of plot progression that is irrelevant to the sex, e.g the infamous sexposition.

Some scenes are there at least in part for titillation I grant you, and it probably would 'help' if they toned it down a bit,Â but it's not fair to lump any scenes with nudity together. Craster's for example clearly wasn't meant for titillation -Â that was setting a scene of horror.

Â 
I didn't say the show's defined only by sex scenes. But, one of the things it's defined by, is sex scenes. And that is why I listed those other shows that also contain sex scenes, but the difference is, those shows aren't looked at and analyzed through the lens of sex scenes, because they 'depend' on sex scenes infinitely less than GoT does. Those shows weren't defined by their sex scenes, even though they had more than their fair share of those. Just compare Omar's scenes from "The Wire", with Loras' scenes from GoT. And let me tell you, as a heterosexual, I'm really not comfortable with either, but Omar's scenes were written and filmed and acted in a very different way than Loras' scenes. Omar's scenes were about his emotional life, just like McNulty's were about his and Stringer's were about his and Kima's were about hers. And, even more important, their emotional lives mattered for the story. And that is not the case with GoT, where we get scenes like Oberyn's - unless they deviate from the books, his emotional life won't matter at all for his arc and for the role he plays in the story.
Â 
Also, I'm not saying all of the sex in GoT is solely for the purpose of catering the primal needs of the audience. For example, "Play with her arse" was probably meant to depict how twisted that universe is. But actually, it just showed how insecure D&D are with the material they're adapting: if you need sexual perversions to 'prove' how mature the universe you're depicting is, you're only proving how immature your writing is. And they did the same with Joff's scene with two whores - it's not gratuitous, it's stupid. But then, many scenes are purely gratuitous, like the infamous whore in Bronn's lap in "Blackwater", or TV Ramsay's assistants playing with Theon.
Â 
So, before assuming what I am or would be ignoring, please be sure you didn't ignore some context of my post you're replying to.

Â 
I agree about the stuff at Craster's. It set the tone of horror and it wasn't overextended. And interestingly there's indications that it was originally going to be a lot more graphic, but it was toned down. So I'm glad to see that they're taking that approach.Â
1780	Miodrag	2014-04-29	Not to mention how stupid some nude scenes look in hindsight. For example, Margaery's attempt to have sex with Renly: besides some outrageous suggestions (to invite Loras in to help!), she was teaching Renly about the ways of the court and of The Game. But this season, she's shocked by the revelation that Joff was murdered! And by the fact her grandma was involved! (And then, she, Margaery, the woman who said to Littlefinger that she wants to be The Queen, has to be schooled into what to do with Tommen.) In all honesty, TV Margaery is one of the most ridiculous characters ever (looks like she overtook that position from the storytelling abomination called Talisa), and her nude scenes were, as we can see now, without any narrative purpose or meaning.

Yes, GoT will never be The Wire, but also The Wire will never be GoT. Many of us enjoy both and they don't need to treat all aspects of their artÂ in the same way to both be enjoyed. A sculpture can be held as good as a painting. Or vice versa. But not all appeal to everyone.

I don't want an ASOIAF adaptation to be The Wire. I want ASOIAF adaptation to be, I don't know, a good adaptation. Because, a more faithful ASOIAF adaptation would dwarf all the other TV shows, The Wire included. As someone (I think Patrick Stormborn) wrote last year, the fact ASOIAF is not in accordance with standard rules of television is actually a great thing. Why adapt a story like ASOIAF in the first place, if you're going to subdue it to standard TV rules and cliches?
Â 
So it's not that GoT is different from The Wire, The Sopranos, True Detective etc. It's that GoT is written by fellows who are so incompetent, they're uncomfortable with the very source material they chose to adapt. And they're trying to write their show the way some other shows were written, but it looks like they aren't any better at understanding those shows than they are at understanding ASOIAF potentials. As someone noticed three weeks ago, they're even trying to shoehorn lines from The Wire ("A man must have a code"), only to contradict even that two episodes later, when it turns out Sandor actually doesn't have a code.

It's not about how easily a story can be written without this or that development. That's some strange logic, because literally any story can be written some other way. Great stories usually get ruined when someone tries to rewrite them, but theoretically, any story can be rewritten. But here we're talking about things that actually are there, in the books or in the show respectively. And it has nothing to do with TV realities you imply. In fact, it seems like show-apologists aren't familiar with TV realities, as evidenced how often they invoke them in these discussions.

What is the most gratuitous thing here is your tone. It is you who are gravely mistaken if you think you know on what is the budget of any show spent on, and especially if you think you know how the budget of GoT is used. It is you who disregard all the other shows that not only survived on air, but had an audience as big as GoT, without being dumbed down - The Sopranos and True Detective being the prime examples. It is you who deal with some abstract Joes in a discussion of artistic merits of a TV product. It is you who bitch like a little girl about other posters' complaints. So just calm down.
Â 
As for your advice about what would be more beneficial for myself, thanks, but no thanks. An adaptation of this scale is a phenomenon in itself. Even if it's a terrible adaptation, like GoT happens to be. But don't worry, once it overpasses the books, I'm out. Not because I don't want to get spoiled, because nothing D&D do would make me thing they're respecting the canon. I'll stop watching the show because, as evidenced by the show-invented stuff so far, it's going to be unwatchable. Even better shows lost me after a sub-par season, because they weren't adaptations of books I'm obsessed with.

1799	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	Well for one thing Oberyn sex shows us how different Dornish culture is to Westerosi culture and this is consistent with the books and other Dornish characters we will meet. It also cements the passionate nature of Oberyn and most of his kin, their approach to multi-partner relationships that could even be an important plot point should certain theories be true and this is just off the cuff. I'd say it has at least as much right to exist as a useful scene as Cersei and Taena or in fact most of the written sex scenes in the show that aren't Bran catching the twins in the act
1800	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-29	I think the changes at the Wall are risky because there is a worry that by taking a lot of it off course, they'll stray too far away from the source material, but a lot of the changes are good. Bran's deviation at the Wall gives him screentime before reaching the cave, and for viewers it adds the tension of a possible Jon/Bran meeting. Plus, Locke is a very good character I think and a good addition to the storyline at the Wall since his alternative motives and lone ranger status adds extra interest.

Ros: Her character was meant to cut down the cost of having to hire whores who know how to act. LF's brothels are a part of the books as much as the show.


Â 
And Oberyn's bisexuality is important... for what exactly? What possible role will his sexuality play in the story, if they don't change it from the books? As for his cocky-fucker nature, wasn't it depicted - and much better, if I may suggest - in the books as well, only without brothel scenes? GRRM hinted at his bisexuality, but didn't make a big deal out of it, because it isn't too important. GRRM depicted how brazen and cocky he is, but he did it through a great dialogue with Tyrion, and not through some boring brothel scenes. Not to mention that, yes, filming a dialogue is less money and time consuming than filming a brothel orgy that is turned into a armed confrontation.
Â 
LF's brothel is important in the books, but not as a vehicle for depicting orgies.

I think it's another example of they just can't win. Some people were vocally critical of theÂ show because Xaro Xhaoan Daxos was never even mentioned as bisexualÂ in the show. We now have a couple of scenes where they highlight it with Oberyn, who is mean to be this great larger than lifeÂ lover, and that gets flack from another quarter!
1803	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	Not often does one find arguments from the viewpoint of austerity forwarded with what seems like passion. We cannot afford this! It is not important! To view the world with bookkeeper's eyes...

Â 
The first scene was perfectly valid in establishing Oberyn's character. We really don't need two rather lengthy scenes of Oberyn and Ellaria having sex or about to be having sex with different gendered prostitutes. We get it, Oberyn's bi. And that's great, but they've expanded a single line about Oberyn in the books to half of his entire characterisation in the show (the other half being his hatred of the Lannisters).
Â 
There is absolutely no subtlety or nuance to the portrayal of LGBT characters on the show. The three LGBT male characters are defined almost or entirely by their LGBTness, and the LGBT women...well up until S4 there were none which is pretty interesting given the amount of lesbian sex prior to Ellaria's introduction.

1805	Miodrag	2014-04-29	Well for one thing Oberyn sex shows us how different Dornish culture is to Westerosi culture and this is consistent with the books and other Dornish characters we will meet. It also cements the passionate nature of Oberyn and most of his kin, their approach to multi-partner relationships that could even be an important plot point should certain theories be true and this is just off the cuff. I'd say it has at least as much right to exist as a useful scene as Cersei and Taena or in fact most of the written sex scenes in the show that aren't Bran catching the twins in the act


Â 
But, all of that could be depicted through his dialogues with Tyrion. Dornish culture? Emphasized by Oberyn's suggestion that Myrcella can be crowned. Passionate nature of Oberyn? I think it was very obvious from the books, even though he didn't have a single sex scene there - every word of his was passionate, regardless of was he talking about his murdered sister or about whores with big tits. And, by the way, the show didn't portray him as a passionate so much as a pervert. Also, how many brothel scenes the show needs to portray Oberyn's relationship to his paramour?
Â 
Again, it's not about anyone's rights to write or like whatever one wants. But, the fact is that Cersei's power-obsessed lust is instrumental for both her character and the story in general, that is undoubtedly influenced by her character (actually, her frustration at not being a man is possibly the one thing that started everything). While, on the other hand, Oberyn's lust plays no part whatsoever. He's described as lustful in the books, and it does help with picturing him in reader's head, but it's not instrumental for the depiction of his character.
Â 
Now, I don't mean to say that only those aspects that are instrumental, should be depicted in the show. In the contrary, the show is often devoid of that kind of "little things" that make the universe richer and more relatable. But, in hindsight, it looks like the show allows only two kinds of those "little things": 1) how dangerous and wicked these people are, and 2) how lustful they are. And it does get boring. In some other adaptation of ASOIAF, perhaps Oberyn's brothel adventures wouldn't be a problem at all. But, after three seasons of sex and gore tuned up to 11, it is quite another story.

Â 
And, what do complaints about Xaro have to do with complaints about Oberyn? How are those two related?
1807	Starksmustwin	2014-04-29	Oh my god... I replied to this like 10 posts before this. And what makes you think I've read the books? And also... I've heard people complain about far more interesting things the show has cut or deviated from the books, so why must they show gratuitous sex just because it's that way in the books? And it's not that they show it. Every premium cable show has gratuitous sex every now & then. It's that they show it ALL... THE... TIME!


Â 
Â 
This is a gritty medieval world. Â  Splashes of gore, sex, nudity, etc only add to that feel. Â  Besides that, there is normally 5 minutes or less of nudity in each episode. Â  This is simply another case of this board blowing something way out of proportion. Â  Â  And if your issue with the sex is due to who you watch it with (buddies, parents, etc), then either watch it alone or with people you feel comfortable with. Â They chose HBO for a reason. Â  This show wouldn't be half as good on a network station.
1808	Cas Stark	2014-04-29	The problem with Oberyn is they're reducing him to a caracature...BISEXUAL HEDONIST. Â Good grief, don't he and Ellairia ever have 1/1 sex, are they always in an orgy situation? Â
1809	Han Snow	2014-04-29	Â 
What is the most gratuitous thing here is your tone.


Â 
Yes, you are right. I do apologize for my tone and attitude, they were completely unnecessary. On the rest, we disagree and that is it. Though I do have one more question: Why wait to stop watching if you hate the show so fiercely and view it as some kind of abomination? Chances of it surpassing the books are rather high, so why wait? What do you get fromÂ  watching something that you clearly hate?
Â
1810	Starksmustwin	2014-04-29	Yes, I know Sam did not promise in the show. 
Â 
But you should re-read Jon's chapters if you think there's nothing important in the books regarding Jon not knowing about Bran.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Jon has dreams about Bran and he sees Summer when he's escaping the Wildlings. Â  Â Do you honestly believe he doesn't know Bran is alive?
Â 
Plus... Book =/= show. Â  They could go a completely different route in the show and make Tommen marry Arya and it wouldn't affect the books at all. Â Heck, at this point, since the show is going to surpass the books within the next year or so, the show writers are probably going to make up their own fine details anyway. Â  So, when you read the last two books, the likelihood of them being extremely close to the show is slim. Â
1811	Starksmustwin	2014-04-29	The problem is that the book scenes you mentioned could be random, but Bran & Co at Crasters should NOT have happened...Sam met Bran and Co while fleeing from Crasters, knowing what had happened there...so when Sam helps Bran and Co get through The Wall, that's the one place they should already know not to go. Â And, when they do go there, they shouldn't be surprised at what they find.
Â 
Unless we're supposed to believe that when Sam led them through The Wall, he "forgot" to tell them about Craster.


Â 
Â 
They didn't go to Crasters on purpose..... Â bran heard a baby crying, he warged and stumbles into a trap. Â He went to Crasters to save Summer and Ghost. Â It's not like he went looking for Crasters.
1812	Daske	2014-04-29	Â

BecauseÂ in the case of the formerÂ the show got flack from someÂ forÂ not mentioning his sexuality at all, although it wasn't important to the story. And in the case of the latter it is being criticised by someÂ for mentioning it too much. In fact I recall some saying they were convinced that Oberyn's sexuality would be 'glossed over'. My point is someone will damn the writers whatever they do.

But I don't hate the show. It's very bad in my opinion, but why would I hate it? D&D didn't offend me. They harmed me in no way. I have no reason to hate them.

I have nothing against them personally, nor against their show, nor against the people that like their show. (To be clear, it doesn't influence my opinion on the people that happen to love it. Who knows what kind of stuff I like that you, for example, would think pure rubbish.) I just happen to strongly dislike the show, is all. And, truth be told, I dislike a lot of TV or movies, because of the same reasons I dislike GoT for, but the source material is what sets GoT apart. Like, there is no other adaptation of this scale and nature, that I can follow so closely. That's some rewarding stuff for all kinds of analyzing. And this posting and these debates do help a lot in analyzing the process of adaptation, even if many posters disagree with my views (in fact, it only helps, cause I like my views to be challenged). Since I'm in the creative business myself, all this can't help but be helpful. But, once there is no source material to compare the TV show against, it will loose all the benefit for me, most probably.

But it's apples and oranges. If Xaro's sexuality was exploited the way Oberyn's is, I'd criticize the same thing. If Oberyn's sexuality was completely ignored, or completely altered as Xaro's was, it'd be as bad. So, if inconsistency in criticizing the show is what you're referring to, perhaps you got it wrong.

Obviously whatever D+D do they will be damned and praised by different people. But it isn't fair to paint all purists with the same brush. Even those who complained about the lack of Xaro's sexuality have every right to be disgruntled at Oberyn's portrayal. Things aren't black and white here - wanting a character's sexuality to be mentioned does not mean you want another character to be made into a caricature by their sexuality.
1816	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	Frankly I'd love for as much long detailed conversations between characters like Tyrion and Oberyn as possible, keeping true to or even increasing on the books, but too much talking wouldn't work as well in a visual medium IMO!

1818	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	I expect Oberyn will be adding to his character in a non-sexual way with some key dialogues in the next 2 episodes though, and Jon Con will also add a lot on that front, assuming they don't give him a sex scene. THAT would be putting a LGTB caharcater's sexuality ahead of their characteristics.

Well, that's an interesting outlook on things. One which I can not share.
Â 
About TV Oberyn:
Â 
I look at it this way. The first time when he was about to have an orgy he was interrupted by Lannisters so he couldn't commit himself to such primal enjoyments. So they showed him the second time after the primal enjoyments were already finished or closing, so he enjoyed himself then again Lannisters show up, this time with an enticing offer.
1820	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	I really really hope the Tyrion- Oberyn cell scene has Myrcella being crowned, the Elia-Oberyn/Jaime-Cersei arranged marriage, and is basically as close to verbatim as possible.

Â 
Yes, but surely wait until we have had more than three or fourÂ scenes with the character before panning the character as a caricature. They went for a big bang (oh!) introduction, now they will expand on his part to play in the story in the coming episodes. If he does spend the rest of them in bed then I will admit that's a bit rubbish.

Â 
If they tone things down a bit from now on it will go some way to repairing the damage, but it won't erase what's already happened. I hope we're done with Oberyn sex scenes, simply because I feel that there is no further purpose to them but I remain somewhat doubtful.

The scene would have been better if one of them had said, "These must be the deserters Sam warned us to avoid." Â That wouldn't stop them from trying to rescue the dire wolves or getting caught, but it would at least make it look like Sam had a three-digit IQ.

1830	basilisk312	2014-04-29	i just sorta dread the future changes i can foresee, tho i hope i'm wrong... for example, i'm worried about the wolves (and even the dragons) due to the already-reported high cost of cgi and how d&d (and hbo) aren't crazy about that cost... i also worry that sam's and arya's arcs will be quite different in the show, unless they simply want to make time for other arcs (you know, have time for other arcs while sam is off becoming a maester and arya an assassin)
Â 
i think dany's troubles in slaver's bay will be shortened, maybe even to the point that jorah's "treachery" is never mentioned... i do look forward to her actually riding the black dragon, that seems too important to cut just for financial reasons
Â 
i'm also worried that stannis' journey to the wall then to winterfell won't receive the detail it deserves... i'm not crazy about locke being where he is, unless next week takes care of him... maybe they'll feed him to ghost

Sorry, but this isn't logical at all. It's not my fault that the show is this bad, you know. Just like it isn't my fault that you can't stand a criticism of the show you love.

1835	Michael Herman	2014-04-29	Really enjoyed this episode, 1,2 and 3 were a bit meh to be honest, but with the Tyrion/Jaime, Jaime/Brienne, Sansa/Petyr wall scenes this was really enjoyable and had some great dialogue.

Also wondering, is the last scene with the other/white walker and craster's child canon for the books, or did George have something else in mind for what was being done to the children.

It's not my fault that the show is this bad, you know.
You post a line like this an expect anyone to take your posts seriously?

Â 
Maybe take a look at the bigger picture and entertain the idea that the writing style is just not for you. There are millions of people of all shapes and sizes that love the show - we aren't all idiots (well some are!). When you say things like the writers are 'incompetent' when they have crafted one of the most critcally-acclaimed, downloaded, reviewed,Â talked about, blogged, finger-on-the-pulse shows of the last couple of years, you know you may not be taking in all the evidence if you are trying to stay objective? And trying to stay objective is surely the difference between constructive criticism and just moaning.

1838	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-29	It's not whining, it's criticizing. Hardly the same thing. And look, you're criticizing my criticism. Even worse, you're just mocking it. But you're not whining. Just like my criticism of the show isn't whining. The way you're saying, it looks like any criticism you don't agree with is whining. But it isn't.


I don't think you understand how to properly criticize. You've stated over and over that the show is bad, bad bad bad. So you don't like it, fair enough. Then you go on to pick at every single thing you dislike. But you've already established that you don't like the show, so at this point all you're doing is whining about all the things you didn't like.
Â 
Criticism comes from people who want to enjoy the show, you clearly go into every episode thinking you're going to hate it and looking for shit to pick apart. You say we don't understand what criticism is, but the truth of the matter is you don't understand what whining is. Criticism that isn't constructive is just whining. What you're doing isn't constructive, you're just moaning over and over that the show is bad.

Let's not forgot though that D+D have an incredibly strong template to work with. If this was their own IP I doubt it'd get past the second season. D+D deserve a lot of credit for putting together a production of this scale and of this qualit, but I don't think they deserve much credit for writing a good story. That prize goes to Martin.Â 
Â 
Fortunately the end result is still very good, even great television. But I feel people give D+D a bit too much credit for the writing. Just going off of Unsullied reactions (which I know is anecdotal) the majority of complaints spring from D+D's inventions, and the majority of favourite scenes are straight from the books.

I'd agree with everything except for what the show is doing with Dany's arc.Â  I think they are providing a more compelling story with Dany than GRRM has up to this point.Â  There seems to be more forward momentum with Dany in the show than thee was in the books.Â  Of course that could change now that she is in Mereen.
Â 
ETA: even though I am still pissed that they got rid of the Strong Belwas character.

I don't think there's really been too much change with Dany's story. Aside from the Dragonknapping Dany's story has remained reasonably faithful to the books and most of the changes have been the more understandable cutting and condensing of characters and events. Though I think Meereen will be handled differently with more of the killings on the street shown in detail, in an attempt to be more compelling.
Â 
Unfortunately I think no matter what D+D do - whether they stick to the books or make wild inventions - the viewers generally won't care about Dany's arc until she hauls ass to Westeros.Â

Which I'd say is a how many book readers feel about her arc as well.Â 
Â 
As for cutting and condensing characters, I'm wondering if we'll be getting a Quentyn. I think her turning down a viable option in Westeros is important to include.

Â 
I'm almost certain Quentyn will be in. He frees the dragons, his death may play a role in turning Dorne away from Dany and towards Aegon and I think it's important to emphasise any connection to Westeros they can.

They're really setting Dany up as a glorious ruler, fans love her, everyone is expecting her to win. But Dany is speeding towards a cliff and nobody knows it yet. It's the same development as in the books, but they've played it up. The crucifixion was made very pro-Dany, they didn't fully show how awful the slave revolt was, the show is playing her up more. They're getting ready for a really hard fall, and it's going to come fast.
Â 
A lot of stuff the show does is good, not all of it (boy did they both Theon's capture and the sack of Winterfell) but a lot of it. Replacing Edric Storm with Gendry was a good idea, likely it was done for budget reasons but it made it easier to care for him. Replacing Roose Bolton at Harrenhall with Tywin was always a stroke of genius, it was a much more interesting dynamic and felt much more dangerous since she was among enemies and not among men who fight for the North. The Red Wedding was more shocking since Robb's wife was replaced with an actual character. The Purple Wedding was also better because it lacked the limited perspective so we could see other guests, also having Jaime interact with Tyrion more is great. Replacing Ser Illyn with Bron for Jaime's sword practice is way more interesting, the list goes on.
Â 
My point is the credit for the writing can't go entirely to GRRM, they show is making a lot of changes and a lot of them are an improvement.

1845	Rockroi	2014-04-29	Don't mind me, I'm just responding to another's comments. Â I just want people to know one thing: merely because one criticizes the show DOES NOT mean that those criticizing the show desire 100% strict adherence to the books. Â many many changes have been worthwhile. Â We criticize bad changes. Â 
Â 
Also- I have NO problem with the "show" spoiling parts of the "book." Â Martin has had more than enough time to get this info to his readers; he has made different choices. Â If the show wants to use other parts of the yet-completed ASoIaF, I have no problem with that and I find that criticism to be void of substance. Â 
Â 
Â 
I like a lot of the changes the show makes, but not all. The way they handled the sack of Winterfell, Theon's capture, and adding repetitive torture scenes was unforgivable. They fucked that up so bad. But say, replacing Roose at Harrenhall with Tywin made for a much more interesting dynamic between Arya and her captor.
Â 

Â 
I agree with these points.Â  I also think that having Tywin interface with Arya was genius.Â  Why? Because it was done well and it fused together two compelling characters in a relatively creative way. Â 
Â 
That cannot be confused with Bran and Jon. Â 
Â 
But no more contrived than Jon and his free folk just happening to cross paths with Bran at that tower, which DOES happen in the books.
Â 

Â 
But in the book (and to a degree in the show) itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a complete freak of nature that the two groups get so close. Â Also, the two sides never actually cross, and are unaware of each other until very late in the game. Â And to me- it sort of makes the SECOND contrived crossing (or near-crossing) even worse; just how many times are these people â<U+0080><U+009C>almostâ<U+0080><U+009D> going to meet up because, well, they are sort of close? Â I find that specific device to be really .... lame (no pun intended). Â 
Â 
And they are reallyâ<U+0080>¦ not that close.Â  Jon himself says its 60 miles from Castle Black to Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s.Â  I mean, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the distance from Berlin to Dresden; to say that somebody in Berlin has a reasonable chance to run into somebody in Dresden is pushing it (and this is modern Earth with transportation advances etc). As far as where Bran ended up- he was at the Nightfort. The Wall has, like, 20 towers, all but three abandoned.Â  In a line from West to East, Nightfort would be 8 and Castle Black would be 11 (in the middle).Â  So, they are â<U+0080>¦ close-ish, but hardly that.Â  By clues given its been months since Bran was at the Wall. Â Bran has a huge head start on Jon. Â Even if you factor in how hard it is for Hodor to traverse the area carrying him, that's a huge head start. Â If Bran can do even a pedestrian 5 miles a day... for two months ... that's 300 miles. Â Is Jon's horse a jet? Â 
Â 
Characters happening to cross paths, realizing it or not, is very common in the books. It's one of GRRM's favourite tricks.
Â 

Â 
Yeah, and if it annoyed me in the books, I usually said so.Â  Frankly, I grow tired of the contrivance even in the books.Â  See, I am not a strict â<U+0080><U+009C>Book Puristâ<U+0080><U+009D> insofar as just because something was in the books, does not mean I like it.Â  Sometimes it worked- Brienne running into that fucked-up Jester and killing him in AFfC; the Hound running into the Tickler.Â  Sometimes, its bad- such as Arya running into Sam, but then not saying anything or Mormont running into Tyrion (in DwD); and other times its fucking baffling- Arya running into one of her fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men in SoSâ<U+0080>¦ who then decides â<U+0080><U+009C>No, wait, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a â<U+0080>Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Manâ<U+0080><U+0099> nowâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D> whatever the fuck that means. Â Not everything in the books met my approval (for whatever that's worth), so if I didn't like something in the books, chances are if the show improved on it, I have said so. Â 
Â 
All I'll say to this is, do you really want to bring up something lacking a sense of direction in A Song of Ice and Fire? Do you reeeeeeally want to do that?
Â 

Â 
I think I do!Â  Â  Because it annoys me both in the books AND in the show.Â  The booksâ<U+0080>¦ holy fuckballsâ<U+0080>¦ DwD lacks direction.Â  AFfCâ<U+0080>¦ lacks direction (to put it mildly).Â  And I have said so.Â  Lack of direction has been killing this story forâ<U+0080>¦ fuckâ<U+0080>¦ 14 years nowâ<U+0080>¦Â 
Â 
I think you're overreacting, I don't see how replacing the chapters of Bran being cold, hungry, and day dreaming about Meera's bum with him being captured by the mutineers (which, in the books, were practically forgotten) turns a "complex story" into a simple one.
Â 

Â 
I could be overreacting (would not be the first timeÂ  Â  ), but I respect Martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dilemma, one he has stated publicly many timesâ<U+0080><U+0093> he wrote Bran too young and has no place to write him.Â  So, he did the responsible thing: he squirreled Bran away (IIRC he has, like, 3 chapters in DwD) so we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to pay attention to his â<U+0080><U+009C>educationâ<U+0080><U+009D> because it may be, well, like most educational experiences: fucking boring.Â  Soâ<U+0080>¦ donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t show it.Â 
Â 
I know its extreme butâ<U+0080>¦ maybe the show had to bite the bullet and stuff Bran into a corner for 2 seasons and not really focus on him, then come season 6 or 7 get a new actor to play Bran (HBO has done it in the past, most notably with Rome and Game of Thrones itself is on its 2nd Tommen and 3rd Mountain- the show can handle that) and have a reintroduction.Â  I think that may have worked.Â 
Â 
But to insert these small, contrived, forced stories are not helping.Â

Agreed, though to me the crucifixions were overly graphic, and I'm not sure they were meant to be very pro-Dany. Of course having foreknowledge of her plot may have skewed my viewing.

1849	Miodrag	2014-04-29	Maybe take a look at the bigger picture and entertain the idea that the writing style is just not for you. There are millions of people of all shapes and sizes that love the show - we aren't all idiots (well some are!). When you say things like the writers are 'incompetent' when they have crafted one of the most critcally-acclaimed, downloaded, reviewed,Â talked about, blogged, finger-on-the-pulse shows of the last couple of years, you know you may not be taking in all the evidence if you are trying to stay objective? And trying to stay objective is surely the difference between constructive criticism and just moaning.


Â 
So, in order to be objective, one must agree in general with the most common opinion? If that's what you're saying, then you're talking about conformism, not objectivity.
Â 
Objectively speaking, prevailing opinions are known to be wrong, especially in matters of art, and especially with movies and TV shows. I'm sure you'd agree that some movies and TV shows were/are overrated. Which means that, just like popular opinions aren't to be disregarded, they also aren't to be taken as an ultimate measurement of quality. And yes, GoT is very popular at the moment, among viewers and TV critics and whatnot. But, so was Lost. In fact, it was even more popular and praised. So was 24. So was Homeland. Each of them got an Emmy. And, you know what, they're all very bad shows. They may be enjoyable for some/many people (in fact, I did enjoy Lost enough to watch all the episodes), but they're ridiculous. Characters are flat, dialogues are bad, plots and twists are often nonsensical and cliched... They were big in their time, but now, only few years later, they hardly look monumental. On the other hand, The Wire had neither their numbers nor their buzz, and yet, long-terms, the legacy of The Wire is going to be lot stronger and more remarkable than the legacies of those shows combined. And what about The Sopranos, the show that actually brought high-drama to TV screens? How can we compare that legacy to the legacies of instant but short-living phenomenons like Lost, 24 and Homeland? True Detective, as of now, still doesn't have nearly the same impact on massive culture as those more popular shows had, and yet, in terms of writing and directing and acting it's head and shoulders above them.
Â 
All in all, my disagreement with the most popular opinion in no way makes me less objective than any of you who agree with the most popular opinion. Nor it means, of course, that my opinion is more valuable simply because it's more unique. If I'm right, that's because I make good points. If I'm wrong, that's because my points are bad. Simple as that.
Â 
And, by the way, I really don't think anyone's an idiot just because he/she likes this or that show. Liking is a matter of personal taste. One may like the setting, or the actors, or the music, or whatever. I try not to judge people for their personal taste. And I do know some very intelligent people that, when it comes to books or movies or music, have a very poor taste.

Ominous for us, the true intention of the imagery is clear. But first timers are seeing it was glory to Dany.
It's a trick. You look back at nazis and people who loved Hitler, they were caught up in the charisma and the propaganda. Made to believe something they wouldn't normally and do horrible things they would never dream of. The Jews are bad! They're lesser humans that need to be purged! Rats! People bought into it.

And, by the way, I really don't think anyone's an idiot just because he/she likes this is that show. Liking is a matter of personal taste. One may like the setting, or the actors, or the music, or whatever. I try not to judge people for their personal taste. And I do know some very intelligent people that, when it comes to books or movies or music, have a very poor taste.


Â 
No, what I'm saying is that it should give you pause. Unless you think you are always right on everything, ask yourself why do all these people like it and I don't? What piece of this puzzle am I missing? If you are making absolute statements like the writers are incompetent, which is an extreme criticism, maybe question how can they be incompetent if all these people like it? They are giving many of us what we want - that sounds very competent to me! What I'm suggesting is be a bit more open-minded.
1853	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-29	I know its extreme butâ<U+0080>¦ maybe the show had to bite the bullet and stuff Bran into a corner for 2 seasons and not really focus on him, then come season 6 or 7 get a new actor to play Bran

The problem with this is that people will forget why they cared about Bran. His "return" after two years with a whole new actor is the same as him not returning at all. TV especially has to keep relevant things relevant, that's why characters like Ser Dontas are cut right up until the point where they actually do something. You can't throw a character off the wagon for two years on TV.
Â 


If you are making absolute statements like the writers are incompetent, which is an extreme criticism


It's not criticism, it's merely making insults. Insults get nobody anywhere and just come off as whining since obviously none of the writers are hear to receive his insults. You can't go into a museum, call every art piece "absolute shit, the artist is incompetent" and call it criticism.

1854	Miodrag	2014-04-29	I don't think you understand how to properly criticize. You've stated over and over that the show is bad, bad bad bad. So you don't like it, fair enough. Then you go on to pick at every single thing you dislike. But you've already established that you don't like the show, so at this point all you're doing is whining about all the things you didn't like.
Â 
Criticism comes from people who want to enjoy the show, you clearly go into every episode thinking you're going to hate it and looking for shit to pick apart. You say we don't understand what criticism is, but the truth of the matter is you don't understand what whining is. Criticism that isn't constructive is just whining. What you're doing isn't constructive, you're just moaning over and over that the show is bad.


Â 
Thanks for making this reply a lot easier. You see, when you state something like this:

Â 
you prove that you aren't interested in reading my posts and replying to them. What interests you is to theorize about what is "constructive" in criticism and what isn't, instead of just proving my complaints are unfounded. Basically, you aren't interested in debating against people that disagree with you. Which is fine, I guess. I just don't know why do you address me then, because it is your posts that look like nothing but whining. But, truth be told, stranger things happened on internet.
1855	Greywolf2375	2014-04-29	...having Ghost locked up...


Â why is it interesting?Â  The NW brothers know that is Jon's wolf.Â  They know he is not one of them.Â  They know that they have limited food...why are they feeding Ghost?Â  Why didn't they just kill him?
Â 


It was a really good episode.
Â 
What I will always fail to understand is why certain people believe deviations from the novel lessen the quality of the show.
Â 
A. The books aren't perfect
B. They are separate entities
C. Some of this stuff is really, really cool


Â No one is stating A & B aren't true.Â  And while C has been true in some of the changes, they also have butchered other pieces.
Â 


Â 
I quoted this because it needs to be seen. I love the books and would hate the show to overpass the books but sometimes purists get carried away with there neediness.
Â 
Inb4 insuing butthurt


Â it has nothing to do with purists, it has to do with good screenwriting, changes that make sense, making sure characters get portrayed appropriately....
Â 


Â 
Â 
Actually, GRRM has already told D&D all the ends to all the major plot lines (who - if anyone - will set the IT, what will the Starks, Targs and Lannisters end up being and doing, what's going to happen with the WW). So we can assume that the ending is going to be roughly the same, but lots of details along the road will be different.


Â So the only thing that is important is the destination?Â  sorry, can't get on board with that.Â  especially with the way the story is written, it is the journey (sometimes literally - Brienne, Arya) that makes the story so powerful.
Â 


If the show followed the book to the to the T... it would be more drawn out than it already is. Books are fine when the writer has free reign over character development.


Â and that is where many of the changes do get questioned - since there is such a rich background/story in place why the need to create new story lines, new characters, etc.Â  absolutely there have been beneficial changes, but there have also been some that appear to have caused some key pieces to be cut.
Â 


Â 
Â 
The Show is NOT the books. Â If you want the books, plot point for plot point, then just reread them and call it a day (or week, month.... how am I supposed to know how fast you read?).
Â 
Â 
They call these "adaptations" for a reason. Â It's a TV show "based" off the book series. Â 


and the point is?Â  In the four years the series has been on I have seen literally no one state that they want a verbatimÂ picture of the books on screen.Â 
Â 


I get that many were disturbed by the last epi and the sex on the alter scene, and even though i respect everyone's right to an opinion, mine is that rape, child abuse and murder are part of this story, in the books as well as the show...so why did it shock anyone...in addition although Ghost avenging the mutiny was ok for the books, really getting to see what was going on and how the women were chanting, for example, made that whole part of the story a fuller representation of things i had only imagined...
Â 
Â 
as a fan of gratuitous sex on HBO for more than 30 years (anyone else remember that HBO used to only show R-rated films after 9 pm), what shocks me is that people are outraged by seeing things that the books never shrink from...GRRM describes sex in vivid detail throughout the books, so what's wrong with seeing it...


Â you even say it, there is a lot of sex in the books.Â  So, why isn't that portrayed on the screen the same way? (sept)Â Â Why do we have to have additional scenes added in if there is plenty in the book?Â  This isn't a oneÂ scene feedback - this is the build up over 3 1/2 seasons now with time being spent on scenes that seem to add little but focus on the nudity/sex.Â  Why, for example with Crasters, can't they "show" us that this is happening (for example, as we pan into the building one of the NW is dragging someone off screen) rather than being "told" (boobs swaying in the firelight while bent over a table).Â  The same discussions come up with some of the displays of violence....when Hugh of the Vale was lanced through the throat I thought they spent much more time than they needed on the blood pumping out of his throat.Â  I'd have much rather had the initial impact, be shown the tip of the lance and then to the crowd and the description Sansa is given.

Yeah, it is true I may be missing something the rest of you aren't. But, funny enough, none of you is explaining to me what am I missing. You're just repeating it's theoretically possible I'm wrong. Thanks, but I know that. However, is there anything in the show that suggests my criticism isn't valid? Not the numbers, not the buzz, but something from the show. Am I missing something about TV Margaery, that would show she isn't a terribly written character that changes personalities from season to season? Am I missing something about TV Tywin when I say he's only saved by Charles Dance's charisma? Am I missing something when I say sex scenes in the show are usually over the top and not helping the story or the characters in any meaningful way?
1857	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-29	Basically, you aren't interested in debating against people that disagree with you.


I'm not interested because you aren't having a debate. You're constantly restating, "It's shit. It's shit. It's shit.It's shit" You clearly show no intention of ever letting anyone sway your opinion and you're so far stuck up your own ass with superiority, so what's the point? Any debate with you is not only pointless, but it's frankly off-topic.

Â 
Â 
Then you really don't read this board much. Â  One guy was even calling the series "Game of Fanfic" because this new Bran/Jon Story line wasn't in the books. Â There's at least one person on this board that gets upset over every minute change. Â So, you're either literally lying about not seeing anyone like that or you literally don't read the comments on this board..
1860	basilisk312	2014-04-29	That sounds like one of those good problems.


lol... you could be right, i do recall <almost> getting bored thru some of that
1861	Blazfemur	2014-04-29	Book lovers beware this thread was better than we expected.
1862	roxWolfox	2014-04-29	After reading all these posts, I'm reminded of what Ken Taylor (instrumental in rescuing hostages in 1979) said after Argo won the Best Picture Oscar.Â  Poetic licence.Â  That's what 'based on' or 'adapted from' mean when a story from one medium is crafted into another medium.Â  Also, considering that George RR Martin himself is writing episodes for the HBO adaptation, I can't get my head around the 'fanfic' accusations.
On one hand you have an author spending little money when crafting a story/characters/world, on the other hand you have two ASoIaF book nerds having to budget for dozens of main characters (some being acclaimed actors who would command quite a paycheck), hundreds to thousands of extras, hotels/motels/food/shelter of some sort, special effects crews, directors, writers, and all that while having to figure out what filming in several countries entails.Â  They have to cut scenes from the books, or the project would be more expensive than the rewards.
Both my husband and I have read the books (I have reread them three times), and while the books are stories that warrant re-reading, tv viewers don't necessarily rewatch unless doing a marathon of sorts.Â  So the producers/writers have to keep that in mind.Â  They didn't show the Liddle and the conversation that led us readers to believe that the northerners know Bran (because of Summer and Hodor) is alive, so they had to go another route.Â  Hence Sam spilling the beans to Jon.Â  It's believable simply because Sam is so in awe of Jon, and would want to ease the sorrow that Jon felt when losing his little brothers.Â  It did fall flat in that we don't really get to feel Jon's pain.Â  Nor do they relate the sense of loss of Ghost to Jon.Â  Again, odd that they wouldn't show this to the tv watchers, but they probably have their reasons.
There were moments that I absolutely adored in this episode.Â  When Dolorous Edd stood up to answer Jon's request, I literally did a fistpump and yelled out a 'yeah! Dolorous Edd to the rescue' which my husband thought was way too funny in itself.Â 
Jaime and Brienne's entire interaction had me on the verge of tears.Â  And yes, I was fully prepared to still have a hate-on for Jaime's violating his sister from the last episode.Â 
And then there was Barriston's reaction to Dany 'meeting injustice with justice'.Â  He definitely had a flashback to Aerys (or even Joffrey for all of the 5 seconds that he was in Joffrey's KG)
While I admit I have a difficult time with sex scenes in any show (The Tudors, Spartacus, The Soprano's) when they don't really serve any purpose other than to shock/titillate and I more or less just find something to do (like dishes or sweeping) until the scene is over,Â  Craster's Keep scene had me fixated.Â  Perhaps it was the level of horror I felt, or just the over the top acting/speech given by Burn Gorman.Â  Either way, I couldn't look away ... and throwing Bran and company into the mix just raised my horror a whole new level.Â Â  The scene with the WW touching the baby was strangely caring/gentle in comparison.
So yes, the books and show have taken different paths in the story telling, but from someone who enjoys great acting and great scenery, I find the show just as compelling as the books.Â  I used to be one of those that raged about tv/movie adaptations being so far removed from the source that the shows lose substance (almost every Stephen King adaptation, Micheal Crichton as just two examples), but many, many others consider what I originally found to be substandard storytelling to be 'classic films' ... and over the years I've learned to appreciate them for what they are.

1863	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-29	But no one believes in the books that Bran is alive. That's half Theon's character is that he is a kinslayer, turncloak, etc. And in the books only Sam knows the truth
Jon knowing Theon didn't kill Bran could have some major plot upsets.

This. I know a lot of book readers didn't feel comfortable with it, but I already knew they would make some changes in the mid-season (considering there wasn't enough material for a full season in ASOS and they have to end around ASOS anyway because of the big climaxes at the end)- and I just loved it. This episode was really well made- well written, well acted, well shot, the sets were fantastic, the CGI as good as ever... Even if you hate that they've shown us that last scene, you have to admit it was epic and awesome. I really can't complement this episode enough. It just worked.

See here's the thing, who's going to save them? Ye si know it's implied Jon with Locke, however, wouldnt ittake awhile to get to craster's keep? Why would Karl keep them alive that long, he's kinda....unruly.
Â 
If I were writing the episodes... this is a PERFECT time for Coldhands to appear, slay the rebel NW, and escort them to Bloodraven.
1873	Blazfemur	2014-04-29	If it ends up being Jon that finds them, obviously thats when Locke turns because he's hunting Bran. Then what?
Â 
"Hey bran long time no see, how are you?" said Jon.
"Thanks for saving me bro, time to go up north."
"Wait, youre leaving?"
"Yeah."
"uh, ok, guess ill headback now after saving your ass."
Â 
it just doesnt work well in theory
1874	Blazfemur	2014-04-29	Locke should leave for Skagos, or wherever Osha took Rickon after finding out from Bran. Locke should be the enemy in his storyline that eventually gets confronted inadvertantly by Davos/Osha.

The stuff with Bran is a pretty wild deviation from the source material. It's hardly out of the question to be upset about it. Even if I look at adaptations like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings that take a fair degree of liberty with the source material, there's nothing like this. This would be like half an hour of the Chamber of Secrets film being spent on Neville's toad getting petrified just so Neville has something to do. Maybe it would be entertaining but so was the source material with less Neville, so why change stuff up?
Â 
Game of Thrones is like the uncanny valley of adaptations. It's not faithful enough to be satisfy my desire to see the books on screen and it's not distant enough from the source material to be a simple "inspired by" which I can enjoy on it's own merits. It's like D+D couldn't decide whether they wanted to do their own IP or adapt someone else's and the end result is a show which tosses book readers about and varies wildly in quality.

...because Neville isn't a main character and Jon and Bran are? Â I suppose that would be the biggest reason to change it is that "Jon stays and fights on the Wall for days on end until Stannis comes in and saves the day" and "Bran lets a dead guy show him where to go" isn't nearly as suspenseful as what they've done here.

In this I cannot help but disagree.Â  As it's been pointed out to me by my husband and many of his show watcher/book reader friends, the book started off with the Black Brothers finding evidence of White Walker activity.Â  That is what they've been waiting for: more White Walker activity.Â  My interest in the story was piqued by the introduction of the direwolf pups (one for each 'Stark' child).Â  I've been disappointed in the lack of direwolf interaction in the HBO show, but the injection of White Walkers has been very satisfying.

But seeing that scene, instills they have a hierarchy of sorts amongst their kind, it instills they're intelligible, theyre not mindless zombies (liek their wights are), it puts into perspective their powers, and the slipup on hbo go just makes the night's king's history that much more apparent delivers a sense of purpose.

Not to mention the fact that it's fuggin' hard to prep a drinking skull that pristine within such a short space of time when there's a whole lot of eating, raping, child beating and wolf taunting to be doing. You've basically got to put the skinned skull into a barrel of mealworms for them to eat all the flesh in all the nooks and crannies of the skull, then to make it nice and pearly white you have to soak in just the right concentration of hydrogen peroxide. I thought it was pretty ridiculous but I just let it go.

I'm a bit worried that you know so much about this topic. Also, it's fantasy, so you can't expect 1:1 equivalency in terms of prepping a drinking skull. I doubt Karl considered the risks associated with his actions.
1886	dmo862000	2014-04-29	If I wanted a verbatim adaptation of the books I wouldn't bother watching. I have a spectacular imagination. I think book deviations are spectacularly interesting and are why I watch. Locke, the Others, a possible Bran and Jon Snow meetup etc etc are what make watching it FUN. I hate spoilers. If they completely adhered to the books it would completely be spoiling. Why bother watching if you want them to go word for word from the books? Whats the freaking point. If you want that then quit watching the dang show and quit complaining about deviations. Book purists make no sense to me. 'This is what I pictured and they deviated from it. Please do exactly what I personally envisioned. If you do otherwise I hate what you chose to do. But I'll keep watching.'
1887	sj4iy	2014-04-29	I'm not sure Bran is a main character right now, not until he meets up with good ol' three eyes and starts doing stuff.

Well, Jon wasn't that important either in the first couple of books. Â It's all about where they are in their journeys.
1888	Carey Snow	2014-04-29	Maybe if Jon does meet up with Bran and co, they'll even teach Jon how to use his powers of warging that so far he hasn't even touched. Just a thought.

I completely agree. Â And it's fun seeing why they make the changes they do. Â For example, I did wonder why Ygritte shot Jon with three arrows instead of just the one to the leg. Â It seemed like a pointless change.
Â 
...until we found out that Sam told Jon about Bran. Â If Jon had only been shot in the leg (as he was in the book), then an injured leg probably wouldn't have stopped him from deserting. Â But being too weak and injured to move at all? Â That would keep him from going. Â It was neat how it all clicks when you give it time to play out. Â I think most people just aren't giving the show the time to see where it leads.

Thank you. I love GRRM but I don't look at him as a God like some on here do. He actually CAN be improved. Sure not every deviation is great but neither is every GRRM right turn. AFFC and ADWD are surely imperfect and I find it hard to believe anyone thinks otherwise. The stories can be improved. Apparently thinking so is a freaking sin. Are people excited to see a D&D Meerenese knot? I know I'm not. Or a dragged out Bran storyline? No thank you.
1891	Mr Fixit	2014-04-29	...because Neville isn't a main character and Jon and Bran are? Â I suppose that would be the biggest reason to change it is that "Jon stays and fights on the Wall for days on end until Stannis comes in and saves the day" and "Bran lets a dead guy show him where to go" isn't nearly as suspenseful as what they've done here.


Â 
Exactly. One side effect of ASOS encompassing two seasons is that some characters simply don't have enough material. What should Jon do until Ep.9? Just stand around and sulk some more? And Bran? After having spent the entirety of S3 travelling, what, should he travel some more? Spend 20 episodes on a road trip with Hodor without anything happening?
Â 
The reaction of various groups of show-only watchers is very encouraging on this front: all of them pretty much agree that the Wall and Beyond the Wall storyline is getting very interesting this season.

I agree that it's quite interesting to watch just from the perspective of the show, however ultimately it will still end up as rather pointless filler. Just like Ros or the Dragonknapping, once this little invention of D+D's comes to an end it will never be bought up again or have any impact on the rest of the plot. Why not have Bran attacked by Wights and rescued by Coldhands? Why not have the smaller battle at Castle Black with Ygritte's death in E4 or 5 rather than condensing it into E9, which is the whole reasons Jon has nothing to do.There's plenty that they could have done that would have been both interesting and true to the novels. If the option to please both parties is there, then why not take it?

Even if both routes are ultimately pointless (though I refuse to believe Martin inserted Coldhands for no reason, and think D+D just want to condense his role) then why not take the pointless route the also follows the books? Watching a potentially good zombie rescuing Bran would be fun to watch even if it's left as a mystery. Watching Bran captured at Craster's is also fun even if nothing ever really comes of it. Both routes work well enough when looking at the show as a standalone piece, but one keeps two groups happy. It should really be a no-brainer.
1896	King Optimus Prime	2014-04-30	To all the book fans that are pissing and moaning about the White Walker reveal understand this: The books can't rule the show, period, we are now in the fourth season of this show and this is the first time we've seen what is presumably the overall antagonist, the show waited long enough, if GRRM wants to take his sweet ass time with WoW and DoS and barely give us anything when it comes to again what is presumably going to be the main villains that's fine, but don't expect the show to do that, by the fourth season or the fifth book, we should at least have some idea of what the main villain LOOKS like, and a brief teaser of what he can do that shows us why we should take him seriously.
1897	The Wrong Tree	2014-04-30	I'm a bit worried that you know so much about this topic. Also, it's fantasy, so you can't expect 1:1 equivalency in terms of prepping a drinking skull. I doubt Karl considered the risks associated with his actions.

Â 
Actually, all they would have to do is boil the skull and then pull the flesh off. I don't know how to quote multiple people so I just used actual quotations haha. Who is Karl? Is he the guy who is drinking out of the skull?

Not to mention...are they going to show Coldhands riding a giant reindeer? Â And if CH is truly important (and he may be), D&D know this from GRRM, and will find a similar character (ala. Locke) or inject CH in later.
Â 
I didn't miss Vargo Hoat, or "Yar!!" pirate Tormund, or never-smiling robotic gold-eyed Tywin. (Any more than I missed Tom "hi derry do!" Bombadil from LoTR.) Â I think most of the changes are great.

Â 
The mutineers are going to be killed and Bran and co. are going to head North. Â Jon will get Ghost back. Â We will either have a cheesy Jon/Bran reunion or a cheesy Jon/Bran 'near miss' number two.


Locke is the interesting part. He was sent to hunt Bran and Rickon and now... He'll find Bran! I think what will happen is that Locke would assume that Bran is "as good as dead" since he decides to continue beyond the Wall, and then he runs back to the Boltons. Now the more interesting part is this: WILL BRAN TELL JON ABOUT RICKON AND OSHA?! Because if he does, Locke's hunt is far from over

Â 
I suppose one could see it like that. Thing is I don't like this all-encompassing usage of the word "filler". Even in the books, did Arya need 21 chapters of roaming around the Riverlands prior to the RW across ACoK and ASoS? Let's not even get into AFfC and ADwD. You could always say this or that could've been left out or trimmed or rearranged... and in a manner of speaking you'd be right.Â 
Â 
This particular change I have no problems with. It gives Jon and Bran something interesting to do. It puts these two storylines temporarily on a collision course which is always nice in a show with so many disparate plots. One story directly feeds into another when these things happen so we are left with a stronger sense of narrative importance (whether or not it's true in the end) and more pronounced forward momentum. In my eyes this is a good thing.Â 
Â 
This turn of events also gives Jon a chance to flex his leader muscles / chops / skills which will obviously have a role to play later in the season.Â As for Bran and the Wights, isn't there some speculation of such an encounter in Ep.10? We'll see.

1901	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-30	But no one believes in the books that Bran is alive. That's half Theon's character is that he is a kinslayer, turncloak, etc. And in the books only Sam knows the truth
Jon knowing Theon didn't kill Bran could have some major plot upsets.

Well, not openly, no. But then there's lots of variations of the GNC
1902	Jambottle Jeebus	2014-04-30	People, Honestly... Sam NOT telling Jon that Bran is alive is a bigger betrayal IMO.
This episode was sweet, and it's refreshing not knowing what happens next... All u book prima-donnas get over it...

Other people know Bran is (potentially) alive in the books.  Ramsay knows, for one, and presumably the people he sends after Bran and Rickon (remember the guy Bran meets in the cave saying people have been about seeking wolf pelts?) also know what they are looking for.  We can probably safely assume that Roose knows too, although I can't recall if he ever confirms such.
So it's not as if there is no one at all who knows aside from Theon.
As far as this upsetting the plot, well, D&D know more than we do regarding that, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt right now.  Plus, we haven't seen how next week plays out.  Maybe the episode ends with Jon thinking Bran has died.
1904	Syrio.Forel	2014-04-30	Really? I get more frustrated each episode. Everything is wrong. Some things get us to the same point & have to be changed to film & I get that but...Gilly in Mole's Town? The Wildlings are insane. Jon knows Bran is alive & is going to Crasters? Bran is at Crasters? The whole thing is a mess.
One of my favorite things about the books is that things are not always fair. Good people die & it isn't fair. The characters are not purely good or evil (save a few) & for me the show is ruining that.
The whole reason Jon Snow thinks its possible to make good with the wildlings is BECAUSE he realizes they are just people. Some are good, some are bad. The show has painted them all as some savage lunatics I suppose in an attempt for us to root for their deaths?
NO WAY those chumps at Crasters could've captured ghost.
I'm just afraid they are going to change the whole story line. Are the show & the books going to end up in the same place? If not it will be very disappointing for me. I'm glad you all enjoyed the episode but for me its just moving too far away from the books.


Â 
This is EXACTLY how I feel. Everyone else seems fine with all the changes, which is cool, to each their own. I just had to cheer that someone felt the same as me on more than one issue.

You mean characters like Rast and Karl? Ultimately the stuff at Craster's is some juicy drama with irrelevant characters.

Because one route allows you to merge two sets of characters who are in reasonably close proximity to each other anyway with the limited screen time you have available where the other doesn't?

True enough, although imo it is a small benefit in exchange for drastically changing the source material. And though it does provide some interconnectivity between plot lines, it's ultimately going to be little more than a tease of a Stark reunion which may leave some viewers feeling cheated. Especially as we got one last season between Jon and Bran already. Plus in this episode at leas, the two separate plots could have been covered in the same amount of screen time as the one combined plot.

I mean, I generally agree with you, but I think you're just splitting hairs at this point.
Another benefit is that it allows the showrunners to have one action scene in one place for the two sets of characters, which saves money and time.  This is opposed to your idea of filming the first battle at Castle Black in addition to a scene of Bran and company against some wights, which would obviously require significantly more expense and time for obvious reasons.
Plus, a battle at Castle Black would be significantly more expensive and would require more screen time than a few sword fights at Craster's, which is presumably why they rolled that battle in with the battle at the Wall to just take over an entire episode.
When I first heard about the fight at Craster's, I thought it made perfect sense.  It allowed them to add a relatively cheap action scene in the middle of the season to keep the pace going.  I didn't expect them to roll Bran's storyline into it, but I don't really have an issue with it either.  It puts Bran's group in some peril and adds some drama that was otherwise absent from his storyline in the books.

Agree with what I bolded, which is why I'm thinking they might actually have a reunion. Not sure how I'll feel about that but we'll see.
Â 
But I'm not sure why people are complaining about changing the source material with these two plots. They're incredibly boring in the books at these specific points; I'm not saying I dislike Jon's arc or Bran's arc overall, but all we'd be getting otherwise is Jon brooding in an ice cell, and Bran eating smashed acorns. I can't say whether I'm going to really like this change until after we know how it plays out, but I am a bit mystified at how much hate it's gotten, especially when looking at the alternative.
1911	Jess Bishop	2014-04-30	It was really hard seeing Ghost locked up.  Not only because of his emotional/mythical ties to Jon, but because it would have been impossible.  Maybe they are just doing it as a way to bring Bran and Jon together again, which I wouldn't be opposed to, but it will definitely cause a new storyline to emerge.

I don't mind the changes, but they haven't been executed very well.
Â 
People think Bran's storyline is boring, but they cut the Liddle scene, where we could have gotten perspective on the North's devastation by the war and the Stark's ruin...as well as "The Wolves Will Come Again"...which I don't think they've said.
Â 
If they want to have Bran captured by the mutineers fine, but why does it have to be so stupid, which them sitting in the woods SO CLOSE to the encampment with no idea it's there...why not have them stumble on it and then get caught...that would be more realistic.
Â 
As far as Jon knowing Bran is alive, that is inexcusible. Â Ditto with both direwolves being captured so easily.

We really don't know how close they were.  They only found it after hearing the baby cry, and presumably Rast didn't just drop the kid off right outside the gates given who was coming to pick the baby up.  He probably went a ways out in the woods, and the noise of a baby crying in a silent forest could probably carry a reasonable distance.  Even after that, Bran only found the encampment because of Ghost whining nearby.
And then they did basically stumble on it after that.

Not necessarily, but usually that is the case. Virtually all the complaints I've seen levied at the show from the Unsullied Threads across the web are the result of changes made by D+D. They've struck gold a time or two, but most of their deviations have been pitifully incompetent. Fortunately this change seems at least fairly exciting and despite a few logical discrepancies, the plot at least holds together for the most part (unlike Talisa, or the Dragonknapping). However I'd still put it on the same level as what happened in the books, rather than an improvement and as such I'd have preferred things to default to the book. That's how things should be if there's no real reason for the change.

But in any case, aside from the usual "when's Dany going to get to Westeros" complaints, there have been a lot of complaints about D+D's inventions, including Stannis' arc, Theon torture scenes, the gratuitous nudity, the already infamous Jaime/Cersei sept scene, and the convoluted-ness of Joffrey's assassination which made less sense on the show due to a few omissions (like Sansa and Dontos only just having "teamed up").

1918	SMF269	2014-04-30	I'm not sure why book fans like this episode so much.
Â 
We already knew what was happening at Craster's Keep after the mutiny. Ghost hunted down and killed some of the perpetrators. Getting Bran mired in everything there is nothing more than pointless filler, plain and simple. Gods help us if he and Jon are reunited. The titular scene - "Oathkeeper" - seemed shorter than Grey Worm's completely superfluous language lesson from Missandei. The overthrow of Meereen was anticlimactic, and Dany's mass-crucifixion of people she thought might have crucified the slave girls (coming soon to a Westeros near you!) was glossed over. That cheap CGI Targaryen flag was atrocious, too.
Â 
Thankfully, at least Saint Tyrion of House Whitewashing didn't give Jaime the idea to send Brienne after Sansa with Oathkeeper and Pod.
Â 
A week after the outrage over gratuitously and grotesquely mutilating a major character arc by having him rape one of the only persons in the world whom he loves and is loyal (if it wasn't supposed to be rape, then why did the writers and directors describe it as "rape" and "forcing himself on her," hm?), we have loads of gruesome rape at Craster's Keep. Totally necessary, I'm sure. It's not like there's more story to tell.


Â 
Â 
1) Non-book readers do not "know" what has been happening at Craster's Keep.Â  IMHO the scene was a very accurate portrait of what would happen if murderers and rapists were left to their own devices with a house full of women who are powerless to stop them.Â  It also shows that the devil you know is better than the devil you don't.Â  Craster was a horrible human being for sure, but they were way better off with him than this lot.Â  If the scene was disturbing to you to watch, that was exactly the point.Â  Horrible attrocities such as this have and continue to go on inÂ our world (not just in Westeros).Â 
Â 
2) Bran's story line is probably the most boring out of all of them.Â  I am glad to see that they gave him and the Reeds anything else to do besides aimlessly roaming beyond the wall.Â  True, they could have come up with some other story line, but I for one am glad they are adding a little more tension for the non-book readers.Â  I love the books, but GRRM most definately could have tightened them up.Â  I actually skipped most of Bran's POVÂ  chapters and went back and read them after I finished the rest of the book.
Â 
3) The Grey Worm/Missandei scene was definately a good add.Â  It was not about a language lesson at all.Â  It brought you into the mind of a slave and how hard it is for them to remember what came before they were stripped of their freedom.Â  You cannot have minor charactersÂ embedded Â into the story line with no indication of how they see the world or of what motivates them.Â  It also shows that no matter how long the human spirit is made to smolder, it has the ability to reignite itself and make the journey back to what came before.
Â 
4)Â  I get why you think the over throw was anti-climatic, but as we all know, budget constraints make it necessary to adjust the story into a more streamlined narrative.Â  Showing Grey Worm arming the slaves, giving them the speech and weapons and then seeing how the slaves take action is enough for the viewer to get it.Â  Again, Dany's story line is a bit boring in the books and it is just more of the same from Yunkai an Astapor so spending a lot of time on it from a production stand point does not make a lot of sense.Â  As for the slavers, it does not matter if they crucified the children themselves or not, they are all culpable and therefore all guilty.Â Â The point of the scene was to show how Dany can be cruel and the way Barristan is a little worried that she may be as mad as the other Targs especially since we did not get the benefit of him telling her that upon his reveal (from the books).Â  So it was not glossed over but rather to make you think about what kind of ruler she might become.Â  Even book readers still do not know.
Â 
5) A flag is a flag.Â  Not sure how epic they could have made that.
Â 
6)Â  For the nine hundreth time, Jamie did not rape Cersei.Â  If people want to be stuck in the "rape" vortex, that is fine, it only killsÂ your narrative of Jamie, but as the scene between them this week proved,Â Cersei does not see it that way.Â  I really do not understand why people want to twist it to justify what they perceive as a major deviation from Jamie's arc.Â  He will always be saddled with duality.Â  I am sorry, but Michael Vick can do his time, appologize and give thousands to animal rights charities, but he will ALWAYS be an animal abuser and although he may do good from here on out, it does not wash away his cruelty. (Side note:Â  Huge Jets fan and I am utterly disappointed in their decision to have this f-nut represent the team.)
1919	Miodrag	2014-04-30	If I wanted a verbatim adaptation of the books I wouldn't bother watching. I have a spectacular imagination. I think book deviations are spectacularly interesting and are why I watch. Locke, the Others, a possible Bran and Jon Snow meetup etc etc are what make watching it FUN. I hate spoilers. If they completely adhered to the books it would completely be spoiling. Why bother watching if you want them to go word for word from the books? Whats the freaking point. If you want that then quit watching the dang show and quit complaining about deviations. Book purists make no sense to me. 'This is what I pictured and they deviated from it. Please do exactly what I personally envisioned. If you do otherwise I hate what you chose to do. But I'll keep watching.'


Â 
Sorry, but this attitude makes no sense to me. If I want to be surprised by a story - I consume a new story. Simple as that. Why would I want to be surprised by the story I consumed already?! There are countless other stories out there, so if the surprise is what you're after, any of those stories you still didn't consume is going to surprise you. As for adaptations, isn't the most logical reason to watch them, to see how other people took the source material you're familiar with? It's hardly the only possible reason, but the most logical one it probably is.
Â 


Thank you. I love GRRM but I don't look at him as a God like some on here do. He actually CAN be improved. Sure not every deviation is great but neither is every GRRM right turn. AFFC and ADWD are surely imperfect and I find it hard to believe anyone thinks otherwise. The stories can be improved. Apparently thinking so is a freaking sin. Are people excited to see a D&D Meerenese knot? I know I'm not. Or a dragged out Bran storyline? No thank you.


Â 
So, you actually don't watch it to be surprised, but to see the story that is possibly improved? Well, that makes more sense, at least. And it's more sincere. However, is there anything that can't be improved? Probably not. But, people usually don't go around improving other people's works. Especially not if they highly respect those works. Because, what I'd "improve" in, say, The Great Gatsby or The Godfather, might ruin those for you. So, I'd leave them as they are, since I do regard them as master-pieces, their small "imperfections" notwithstanding.
Â 
And, the most important thing, do you really think the show is an improvement of the books? Not this or that detail, but the show as a whole. Is the show as it is, better than it would've been had D&D restrained themselves from "improving" the story and stayed as close to the books as the budget and schedule allowed?

Not necessarily, but usually that is the case. Virtually all the complaints I've seen levied at the show from the Unsullied Threads across the web are the result of changes made by D+D. They've struck gold a time or two, but most of their deviations have been pitifully incompetent. Fortunately this change seems at least fairly exciting and despite a few logical discrepancies, the plot at least holds together for the most part (unlike Talisa, or the Dragonknapping). However I'd still put it on the same level as what happened in the books, rather than an improvement and as such I'd have preferred things to default to the book. That's how things should be if there's no real reason for the change.


Â 
The internet is an echo-chamber where the loudest people can be heard...but it's very rarely the case that those people constitute a 'majority' of the opinion. Â Ratings, piracy numbers and just the sheer amount of money that HBO is making on the show are all indicators that not only are people happy with what they are getting, they like it so much that they keep coming back and more people are tuning in. Â If I went by what 'people on the internet' said, I would think that everyone hated the all of the LotR movies, every Stark Trek show since the original and every Doctor Who episode since the 70's. Â Of course that's absurd, but it's what the internet is for.

Â 
Yes they do - they try all the time! Not sure if you are referring to the original books or films, but either way surely Coppola's GodfatherÂ improved upon the book (since I & II are considered by many among the best films ever made). Directors can sometimes do succeed in expanding or improvingÂ book-to-screen. I'd add Blade Runner, Planet of the Apes and Kick Ass asÂ other quick examples of adaptations closer to the GoT genre that many will feel improved over the original materal. Obviously many do fail as quality work, but that is true across the board. There are plenty of examples where it has been an improvement. And pretty sure those directors often cite their love of the source material!
Â 
I'd agree most film-to film remakes are not as good as the original if that is what you are referring to specificallyÂ (Planet of the Apes again!), but book-to-screen is a much closer fit to what we have with theÂ ASoIaF to GoT adaptation anyway.

I think that shows/films are very rarely improvements over their source material.  That's the nature of an adaptation, and I don't think Game of Thrones is any exception.
The show was also never really in a possession to be an improvement on the books.  They're too vast.  There are too many characters, too much action, and too many ridiculously vast locations.  It would be virtually impossible to improve on them in a visual medium without unlimited time and money and an ageless cast, none of which can be provided.
As to your second question, I honestly don't know.  I think most book people would agree that some changes have been for the better and some for the worse, which is true of basically every adaptation.  Overall, I do wish they would stick a little closer to the source material sometimes, but I also won't get bitter about them wanting to put a bit of their own stamp into their adaptation.  
I think they've done a pretty impressive job with this show so far, and it only appears to be getting prettier and better with age.  This season has been visually phenomenal thus far, and we feel miles beyond the cramped spaces and general lack of set-piece moments and beautiful vistas from the first season.  It's not a perfect show by any means, but it is a generally good one.
1923	Blazfemur	2014-04-30	Â

Â 
Regarding the Cersei/Jaime sept scene, and how "controversial" it's become. And this isnt directed toward you, but toward the sheer hilarity of it's "controversy."
Â 
Look, it's fucking Game of Thrones. When the series didn't blow up in it's popularity, you never would've heard a word about that scene because trueborn fans expected to see as much. Because Game Of Thrones has exploded in it's fanbase, in that explosion, you get the mainstream "sensitive" people who get offended over every. fucking. thing.
Â 
"No, no, that's not right at all. I dont agree with that at all."
Â 
Guarenteed, if GoT was still around for fans who just read the book, and not the explosion of mainstream media (and all the people that beg for apologies that get offended frequently) that come with it.
Â 
Trueborn fans know Gregor Clegane raped the fuck out of that innkeeper's daughter. They know Lollys was manhandled several times. Do I bat an eye? No i fucking don't, because GRRM has painted a picture of accuracy with the time period he writes in. Ramsay Snow even being alive, was Roose Bolton's rapey law.
Â 
Get over it.Â It's an HBO series, premium channel, at night time. If youre offended by it, maybe you should get your parents' permission before watching.

Â 
Hollywood people do try all the time, indeed, but, fortunately, even with all its power and influence, Hollywood is just a small part of the worldâ<U+0080><U+0099>s creative community. And, honestly, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure Hollywood respects anything.
Â 
The Godfather was better than the book for me, though I do know some people that still prefer the book over the film. Same thing with Blade Runner â<U+0080><U+0093> the movie is much better than the book in my eyes (to tell the truth, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m surprised Do Androids... was even picked for an adaptation, because itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of the weakest Dickâ<U+0080><U+0099>s books I read, but, as we all know, it did result in a movie classic). All of which suggests that these authors perhaps didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t respect the source material too much, regardless of what they were saying in interviews. (And, as far as I can remember, Scott didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even read Do Androids...) They obviously had to like some parts or aspects, but it was far from the respect one feels toward the source material when adapting Hamlet or Anna Karenina.
Â 
Nothing is written in stone, as far as adaptations go, so there are various examples. I happen to think ASOIAF deserves the utmost respect and devotion. Perhaps some/many readers donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t, even if they do enjoy the novels very much, but I do, and for a number of reasons. Not only because itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s as interesting and addictive a story as any, but also because it goes deep into examining both human souls and human societies, and also because GRRMâ<U+0080><U+0099>s obviously influenced by Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Goethe, and works like already mentioned The Godfather (Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d also add Dostoevsky, cause I see such a resemblance between their respective characters, at least in terms of how passionate they are, but I have no solid proof for that theory, hell, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even know if Martin ever read Dostoevsky). We can debate how successful he is in following their footsteps, but they are his obvious influences in creating ASOIAF. Which means, Martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ambition is not only to tell an extraordinary story; I mean, it is also that, and I love how unapologetic he is about the almost childish joy he feels in telling stories; but it goes beyond and above that. Looking through those lens, pure numbers and ratings wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t satisfy me, if I was to adapt ASOIAF. D&D can be satisfied with whatever they chose, their goals are their goals, but, if given the chance to adapt ASOIAF, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d try really hard to stay as close to the source material as possible. Truth be told, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d do that with any adaptation, cause I probably wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even attempt to adapt something I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t respect. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d possibly take the premise I like from a story I dislike and develop it into a rather different story (a la Battlestar Galactica), but would never adapt the source material I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t respect. And, if I respect it, than it would command me to be faithful. If for nothing else, then for those who are going to consume the adaptation before, or even instead, the source material.
Â 
There also another way â<U+0080><U+0093> what Coppola did with Heart of Darkness. He adapted it into Apocalypse Now, the movie that is not unlike the source material, but, at the same time, is a completely separate entity. That way, even if you watch the movie first, as I did, it wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t ruin the reading of the book in any way, just like it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t for me. Hence, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not exactly an adaptation, but rather a whole new work that is heavily inspired by the book.

in those millions that like the show now, my point is, included in those millions are the people that claim theyre offended just for attention, and are hellbent on apologies for being offended. Meanwhile, they neglect to read the warnings at the beginning of each episode detailing "sexual situations, nudity, adult language," etc.
Â 
Don't get me wrong, I got into this series because of seasons 1 & 2. And then i took the responsibility, to reading the whole series over the course of 5 months, and then rereading for an additional 5 months.
Â 
It was a mere rant, it didn't even have a place on this topic, and for that i do apologize. It's discrimination on my part, and not toward show-only watchers, but forÂ sensitive people who are only sensitive for attention and a sense of entitlement for that sensitivity. If youre offended by this show, you clearly haven't been paying attention.

It's not a perfect show by any means, but it is a generally good one.


Â 
Honestly, I'm glad you aren't defensive about the show, like many show-lovers tend to be (which, in turn, makes them aggressive and rude). Even if you and I mostly disagree, I have nothing but respect for you attitude. Unfortunately, many show-lover react angrily on the criticism of the show, so I usually don't have the opportunity to say this, but I do respect people who like the show, for whatever reasons. It should go without saying, but I respect their opinion enough to debate it, to challenge it. Just like I expect from them to challenge mine. Alas, some of them just don't want to, and instead they turn into personal attacks. It's as if the criticism endangers their love for the show. And if that's really the case, then their love is not so strong, most probably, no matter how loudly they proclaim it.
Â 
That being said, I respectfully disagree that the show is generally a good one. I'd put it into the same category with Lost, The X-Files, 24, Homeland, Dexter... Meaning: certainly watchable, but far from masterpiece. Such products are always dependent on a personal taste. If they satisfy the personal taste of a large number of viewers, they are successful. If not, they aren't. But, in my eyes, that's not good enough. Especially if you're adapting the source material that already transcended the genre boundaries. ASOIAF is read and adored by numerous readers that aren't big on fantasy. I'm one of those. It offers so much more than crazy action and various settings. Just like The Sopranos caught the attention of many viewers that aren't interested in mafia sagas, and just like True Detective attracted viewers that doesn't care about serial killers (the author himself said he isn't interested in the genre at all), and just like The Wire is adored even by those viewers that don't particularly like cop dramas, that's what I think an adaptation of ASOIAF should be. And even better, because, honestly, no story of this strength and quality ever hit the screens. Not by a large margin. If your ambition is to create the best TV show ever, then ASOIAF is the source material from your dreams. And the best part is, the audience would love it. No need for those "some things don't look so good on screen" excuses I hear all the time. The budget can be limiting, of course, but, some often cited "adaptation rules" aren't. Even if you take all the not-screen-friendly stuff out of ASOIAF, you're still left with more than enough for a TV show that would end TV shows. And I'm pretty sure a lot of stuff that people like to peg as "inappropriate for screens", is actually very screen-friendly, and definitely more screen-friendly than many of the changes we saw. As I said in some other thread, Arya's Harrenhal days are very cinematic, much more so than what we got in the show. Her conversation with Roose is certainly not a bit less cinematic than her TV conversations with Tywin, and it's much more important for the narrative and themes.
Â 
So, I can't put GoT into the same category with The Sopranos, The Wire and True Detective. In fact, we're having this conversation only because of the books. Without them, I don't think I'd watch the show after the second season. Can't be sure, of course, but, based on my experience with other shows, I'd quit after so much sub-par writing in that season. That's about the quality. As for the faithfulness, I'm honestly surprised when people say the show is faithful to the books. It simply isn't. Ever since the first season, you have like 3-4 scenes taken from the books per episode. The rest is either heavily changed, or completely invented. Not to mention how many iconic lines they cut, even in the first season. All in all, probably more than the half of show time is authentic TV material. Whatever this adaptation is, it isn't faithful. And the reason for that is not money, nor time, nor "what works on screen" rules, but what you rightfully recognize: D&D's desire to put a bit of their own stamp. But, there we also disagree, because I strongly dislike the way they're putting their stamp here. There are other ways to do the same. Cogman managed to do it in his episode in Season 2, with "Theon's burning the letter" scene, and with Tyrion's trick on Pycelle, Varys and Littlefinger - he adapted the stuff from the book into something more suited for TV, but he preserved the tone and the spirit of the book. That's what smart adapting looks like, and it also left his stamp, as evidenced by almost universal praise for his work in that episode.

ASOIAF is read and adored by numerous readers that aren't big on fantasy. I'm one of those. It offers so much more than crazy action and various settings. Just like The Sopranos caught the attention of many viewers that aren't interested in mafia sagas, and just like True Detective attracted viewers that doesn't care about serial killers (the author himself said he isn't interested in the genre at all), and just like The Wire is adored even by those viewers that don't particularly like cop dramas, that's what I think an adaptation of ASOIAF should be.
...


Â 
YouÂ miss the bigger picture here. The book series was popular before the showÂ and yes it did break new ground, but most of its fans were still those that generally read fantasy.Â Many more people not experienced with fantasy literature or televesionÂ started watching the show because of word of mouth about the show andÂ started reading the books after being influenced by the show. Yes, the books transcended boundaries and grabbed some non-genre fans, but nowhere near as many as the show has.
Â 
As with most of your points you do the show a disservice because you are obsessed by how good you think the books are (and most of us do like the books very much). But no adapatation is going to make you happy, so your position seems to be that because it can't ever be a perfect adaptation then theÂ show should never have been made. Forget the books for a second - there may not be a better fantasy series on TV for another twenty years! Get some perspective and you may find you can enjoy the show a little better.
Â 
As a great man-fish once said 'if you're as close as you can get to a bottle of Baileys without getting your eye wet then you're just painting a creamy piece of paper'. Or something like that, I'm sure there was a moral in there somewhere.

1931	Miodrag	2014-05-01	^You make quite a lot of assumptions about me. Not that I mind really, but have to tell you, you're very wrong. Especially if you think I'm the one who lacks some perspectives.
Â 
For one, I don't consume stories with an agenda in mind. I'm not trying to like or dislike them. It would defeat the purpose, wouldn't it? Why would I force myself to like or dislike anything? I'd only loose perspectives that way. The "job" of a viewer is to like or dislike the material, not to try to like or dislike it. I didn't read the books with some desire to love them. It just happened, because they're great. Also, I didn't start watching the show with some desire to like or dislike it. I had certain expectations, but all based on previous experiences with great HBO's dramas - nothing extraordinary. No agenda whatsoever. And my expectations influence my impression on the show much less than show-lovers' expectations influence theirs, it seems. Season 1 was below my expectations too, but I didn't dislike it. I wasn't fascinated with it like many were, but it wasn't bad. It didn't make me unhappy. I do manage my expectations just fine, thanks.
Â 
As for a perfect adaptation that will never happen - what kind of an excuse is that?! It's not perfection I'm looking for. If it was, nothing would ever please me. It's just a straw-man argument show-lovers use all the time. No, perfection is not the golden standard I hold the show against. The show isn't bad because it doesn't compare well against some perfect image I created in my head. It's bad because of the writing, dialogue, plots, characterization, often sub-par directing... With the resources they have, and with the source material they're adapting, they could've done an infinitely better job. Whether they should have or not, is on them and their supervisors from HBO, not on me. But it is on me and you and the rest of the audience, to analyze could they realistically make a better show, or not.
Â 
You enjoy the show? Fine! I have nothing against it. Why would I? Good for you, honestly. But, for someone who argues the show is good, you rely on the numbers too much and too often. GoT is hardly the first popular show ever. But popularity doesn't equal quality. If you're saying GoT is as good as those other insanely popular shows, that's something I can agree with. And it satisfies you? Once again: good for you. But it doesn't have to satisfy me. And it has nothing to do with my expectations from the source material. I disliked any number of insanely popular shows, even though they weren't based on some books I read. As I said numerous times, I'd probably quit the show long ago, if it wasn't for the books, so if anything, the books help the show, in my case at least.
Â 
And what's wrong with me respecting the books more than you do? I mean, if you think the show as it is represents ASOIAF faithfully, it probably suggests you don't respect the novels as much as I do. Which is fine, really. You don't have to. I'm not saying you're lacking some perspective, or that you aren't open-minded enough to enjoy the books. Like great many other ASOIAF admirers, I present my case when books are discussed, but that's it. I don't go around claiming people who don't like the books as much as I am are lacking a perspective or two. It would've been, I don't know, arrogant? And, truth be told, there are perspectives to be overlooked when books are concerned. I didn't figure out R+L=J on my own. I'm certainly glad someone else showed me that perspective, that angle, that layer of the story. But the difference is, that's the perspective from the story. It has nothing to do with fantasy books, nor genres, nor literature, nor whatever. So, if you want to tell me about perspectives from the show I'm possibly missing, I'm all ears. But, perspectives that deal with TV industry or its future are of no importance in this discussion, because: 1) I'm very well aware of those, 2) I don't see why would I give a damn about them, and 3) they influence the quality of the show we're analyzing in no way.

OK, I'll bite - I'd say you were missing 'heart'. When you are analysing every every second of every scene and comparing it to every word on every page, you are missing the point of it - it's not meant to treatedÂ as a historicalÂ documentory, it's not meantÂ to be treated as a literature studies course -Â it's meant to beÂ entertaining. No more, no less.
1933	ToTheWolves	2014-05-01	If I wanted a verbatim adaptation of the books I wouldn't bother watching. I have a spectacular imagination. I think book deviations are spectacularly interesting and are why I watch. Locke, the Others, a possible Bran and Jon Snow meetup etc etc are what make watching it FUN. I hate spoilers. If they completely adhered to the books it would completely be spoiling. Why bother watching if you want them to go word for word from the books? Whats the freaking point. If you want that then quit watching the dang show and quit complaining about deviations. Book purists make no sense to me. 'This is what I pictured and they deviated from it. Please do exactly what I personally envisioned. If you do otherwise I hate what you chose to do. But I'll keep watching.'

Lol! Best post I've ever read.

Oh I get it..you're saying you could do a far way better job if you had the resources.
1935	Miodrag	2014-05-01	OK, I'll bite - I'd say you were missing 'heart'.

Â 
But, if it's meant to be entertaining - no more, no less - then I'm hardly missing some heart. Stories with 'hearts' are usually more ambitious than to be entertaining. By the way, I'm not analyzing "every second of every scene and comparing it to every word on every page". Never did that. Don't know where did you get that idea. Nor do I want the show to be treated as historical documentary, or as a literature course.
Â 
And please stop speculating about what I want. You're doing a very poor job with that. Perhaps it would be more productive to explain what is this heart I'm possibly missing. I'm curios, honestly. It wouldn't be the first time someone opens my eyes about something. Just leave aside your speculations about what I want, and try to explain what I'm missing from the show.

Â 
You are asking an honest question, and I will try. GoT deserves serious critical reviews. Yes, indeed.
Â 
But GoT is also about getting a little tingle when you hear the intro music, it's about buying a GoT mug to match 'your' House, it's about posting silly gifs on Tumblr, it's about naming your cat Arya because she looks a bit like Maisie, it's about picking out GoT as your calander this year then drawing a moustache on May's Stephen Dillane, it's about discussing the latest episodes with your boss at work when you should be in an important meeting, it's about laughing at Red Wedding vids on YouTube, it's about persuading your mum to watch it then later finding out she's hooked,Â it's about buying your neice 'I'm not a Princess, I'm a Khaleesi' T-shirt, andÂ it's about desperately waiting for the Blue-Ray boxset to come out so you can inviting your friends over for a binge GoT evening.
Â 
All these things are part of what makes GoT (or any other 'fan heavy' show) good, or great, or fun. I think without this you are missing an important ingredient to judge the competence of the the showrunners and the quality, importance andÂ impact of the show.
Â 
And yes, if you really don't like it, you will probably never appreciate these 'meta' aspects of the show, but you are still missing part of the evidence. And that's life - we all miss out on something everyone else seems to get a kick out of. This is what I mean.
Â

I bought all the mugs!
1939	dbunting	2014-05-01	Couple rants that have coem to me while reading this thread.Stannis doesn't care if Bran and Rickon are alive, they have no bearing on his claim. His claim is to Westeros as a whole and didn't acknowledge Robb except as a usurper. So to him they mean nothing.Ghost - Summer captures...big deal. They are just direwolves. Wild animals and even people can be captured, stop acting like that are above the world because they are not.And BTW, Ghost was still North of the wall at this point, he and Jon were still separated. He reconnected with Ghost when he went past the wall to kill Mance, so this is not a change.As for all of the hate toward D&D and whoever else runs the show....it is a fan favorite and is getting all kinds of ratings, so apparently they are doing something right. Stop being a book snob and accept that Strong Belwas, Cold hands and other assorted characters are gone. Not everyone can make it when adapting, just can't happen.Ok, I feel better now.
1940	briantw	2014-05-01	Stannis doesn't care if Bran and Rickon are alive, they have no bearing on his claim. His claim is to Westeros as a whole and didn't acknowledge Robb except as a usurper. So to him they mean nothing.

He may not care personally about them, but politcally they could be very useful to him.  The North would rally around a Stark child in a way they never would around Stannis.  If he can find either Bran or Rickon, he can rally the Northern lords by simply telling them he means to reclaim Winterfell for the Starks.

Oh, it's definitely not about the orgasm i get when i hear the opening "weiner, weiner-weiner," it's the pre-erection i get when the HBO announcer exclaims in his noble, lordly voice, "...AND NOW, the HBO original series, GAME OF THRONES."
Â 
.....i used to get that feeling when True Blood came on, but that died at Season 4.

1947	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	To continue on my point, i would much rather LOVE to see a spoiled alternate universe, than wait 10 more years for a dream of spring. i take into consideration a lot may not happen as it will in that book, but knowing wat i know up until book 5 and d&e 1+2, i would LOVE to be spoiled until the real thing comes out.

well, what parts specifically, and why? legitimately.
1950	ground_control	2014-05-01	Â 
well, what parts specifically, and why? legitimately.


I've posted specifics in several places, but off the top of my head:
Â 
1) Grey Worm / Missendei -- doesn't add value, "sacking" of Mereen to quick and sterile, the time spent on "developing" the GW/M relationship could have been used to better effect making the sacking look better
Â 
2) Locke teleported to Wall, poor choice of his false origin
Â 
3) Sam just mentioning that he told Jon about Bran (could have been done better in an earlier episode, felt contrived here)
Â 
4) Jon and Sam just now looking at map and realizing that Bran may be near Craster's, even though Sam met him while fleeing from there
Â 
5) Sam apparently didn't warn Bran about a bunch of mutinous deserters (this could have been handled by a single line referencing Sam warning him about them, Bran & co still would have tried to free Ghost and Summer and get caught)
Â 
6) Karl from Gin Alley was a bit over the top -- too much time spent on the mutineers
Â 
7) Locke just happening to overhear talk about Bran
Â 
Basically, I don't dislike the content conceptually, it just feels like it was forced in all at once into this episode. Â If some of the scenes had been eased into a bit more smoothly, or foreshadowed a bit in earlier episodes, I think it would have flowed better. Â For example, Locke could have been shown in episode three when they are showing new recruits (so he declares he'll go in episode 2, we see him arrive in episode 3, and then he starts up in episode 4). Â Sam could have told Jon about Bran instead of the all-new Mole Town trip with Gilly in episode 2 (not cut everything with Sam/Gillym, they are good together; I just don't think the Mole's Town part added anything to Sam/Gilly).
Â 
It's possible that having a bunch of North scenes back to back for the last 20 minutes instead of broken up throughout the show that made it seem more crammed together as well, which definitely didn't help.

Â 
1. I suppose this is an attempt to humanize the soldiers and to see how they think...I would say that's useful since that's how they convince the slaves to revolt.
Â 
2. You can't say that he 'teleports' to the Wall when he leaves back in episode 2. Â We don't have to see his journey or even see him each episode to know that he actually made a journey there. Â It's not as if they stop accepting new recruits.
Â 
3. Don't see how it felt contrived...we haven't seen much of the Night's Watch up until this episode in this season. Â It was pretty clear that Sam told Jon about it while he was convalescing- and actually, it explained another change they made in the process. Â In the books, Jon is shot by one arrow in the thigh...in the show, he's shot three times and is more seriously wounded. Â It makes sense that they did that now in order to keep Jon from going after Bran, because an injured leg wouldn't have stopped him. Â It also gives an ulterior motive for Jon wanting to go to Craster's Keep. Â And actually, it was Jon that mentioned Sam telling him, not the other way around.
Â 
4. Sam may have fled from Craster's Keep with Gilly, but he didn't meet Bran there. Â He was already South of the Wall when he met with Bran. Â Anyway, I think the scene is more about illustrating Jon's state of mind and not Sam's.
Â 
5. Why would Sam have done that? Â He didn't know where Bran was going, except "North of the Wall". Â He doesn't even mention it to Bran in the books.
Â 
6. Give you that one, but eh, a little bad acting never hurt anything. Â Especially when it's effectively one of the last scenes they'll ever have. Â Admittedly, it just makes me want to see a sword through his face that much more, so I guess it did its job.
Â 
7. It's not an original idea, but it's obvious the guy is doing everything he can to shadow Jon, so it fits.
Â 
I don't know what kind of 'foreshadowing' they can really do when the Night's Watch had only had about 6 minutes of screen time before this episode. Â It's not as if Jon is going to go around talking all the time about his brother Bran, especially before or during his trial, especially since he figures that they are going to execute him. Â The show was (rightly) focusing on the Royal Wedding and the aftermath of that...the battle with the Wildlings and everything else could easily wait.
1953	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-02	I agree with the OP. 
The show is an adaptation. They couldn't and shouldn't go with the show 100%. Sometimes they are doing very well with the changes. Sometimes not so well, sometimes it's lame. But all in all they are bringing an enjoyable show to us. It may be different from the books but that doesn't mean it's wrong. Also, the tv show must sell itself, and to that certain changes must be made. It's business. We either accept and understand that or go on about how they ruin the story, but it won't change.  I still like the show even though there were many things I didn't like. They are doing something right.
1954	rocksniffer	2014-05-02	Â 
in those millions that like the show now, my point is, included in those millions are the people that claim theyre offended just for attention, and are hellbent on apologies for being offended. Meanwhile, they neglect to read the warnings at the beginning of each episode detailing "sexual situations, nudity, adult language," etc.
Â 
Don't get me wrong, I got into this series because of seasons 1 & 2. And then i took the responsibility, to reading the whole series over the course of 5 months, and then rereading for an additional 5 months.
Â 
It was a mere rant, it didn't even have a place on this topic, and for that i do apologize. It's discrimination on my part, and not toward show-only watchers, but forÂ sensitive people who are only sensitive for attention and a sense of entitlement for that sensitivity. If youre offended by this show, you clearly haven't been paying attention.


Â 
as i said above, this is a great thing in my opinion. People that never read GRRM's work or any fantasy for that matter have watched the show, become intrigued by the story, the characters, etc., and now have read the books to get...as Paul Harvey was fond of saying..."the rest of the story"...
Â 
there will always be some who refuse to take the show at face value, that's ok its their loss in the long run. I am glad that there are differences, even if i wish it had been cold hands that took the kid, i am not convinced he is gone just not appearing as readers expected...
Â 
...for example, someone(s) said earlier, and i am too lazy to go back through and find it...that they thought it was too contrived that everyone ends up at Craster's keep...according to this map and others i notice that the keep is due north from the Night Fort where Sam and gilly crossed wall and where Bran and co. were camping for the night...so it seems normal that they might have run up on it without knowing it was there...these kinds of twists and changes are what makes the show be able to stand alone. something that is important to people that aren't interested in the books...
Â 
....of course that is just this old asshole's opinion.... Â
1955	rocksniffer	2014-05-02	i am interested in the thoughts of the new fl00b class about this last epi...i know the thought s of the book lovers and the old fl00bs...but really you new guys might have some insights we old fucks have ignored...

1956	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-03	I think the changes are OUTRAGEOUS! Why doesn't Melissandre have red eyes? Â Or Tywin Lannister have gold flecks in his? Â This show is a disaster.

If Mereen doesn't have the blue grace and the green grace and the gold grace and the red grace and the aqua grace, I shall picket HBO!!

1959	skittles72	2014-12-13	Did anybody find it really sad when he sent her off????
1960	T.C	2014-12-17	Yes

1963	Beric175	2015-02-18	yes, they worked so well together and I think the music helps enormously here in the scene where Brienne looks back at Jaime whilst riding away.
1964	Le Cygne	2014-04-27	What did we all think?

					
					
							Edited by Le Cygne, 28 April 2014 - 11:50 PM.
1965	Charles Phipps	2014-04-28	I think it's a very effective scene, albeit one marred by everyone's remembrance of the Sept scene. I think Jaimie's redemption is in Brienne, though.
1966	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	jaime's look on his face when she says "oathkeeper" was perfect.
1967	Le Cygne	2014-04-28	That's true, I had to pretend he was book Jaime.Â 
Â 
So we didn't get this:Â  "Blue is a good color on you, my lady.Â  It goes well with your eyes."Â  Would have been nice, but it's not the first time this has happened, they cut most of their best lines.
Â 
And she named Oathkeeper, going back and forth on this one.Â  He's put a lot into making this happen, so it obviously means a lot to him. And it's nice that he asks her, it's more of a gift that way. I sort of like the change.
1968	Gertrude	2014-04-28	I think they laid it on too thick.
1969	Le Cygne	2014-04-28	Well, they will be apart for a while, until next season, anyway.
1970	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	And their reunion may become unpleasant, so I'm glad there's some tenderness here to hold us over.
Â 
I liked how in "the Bear and the Maiden Fair" Jaime couldn't bring himself to say "goodbye Brienne" and this time she can't say "goodbye" to him. There were lines that I had thought would beÂ indispensable to the scene, but when I saw it without, it didn't seem to need them. They acted them, I guess.
Â 
I think there will be an extended cut of it on the DVD though (I hope) because there were shots in promotional material that were clearly meant for this scene, that didn't appear in the episode.

1971	rocksniffer	2014-04-29	i think that his feelings for her were something of a shock to his system....he has repeatedly said he had never had any woman but cersei, so discovering a woman loves him, even though in his mind he is an honorless cripple is difficult to accept. remember he has just had a woman that has professed to love him for his entire life reject him because he was maimed and has not been at her beck and call as she selfishly put it you came too late.
1972	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-29	I liked how she named Oathkeeper because of his reaction shot. Like, he'd love love love for it to be named that but he can't say it out of thinking she'd snort and be "wtf, u rly?" He's got his pride. Getting Pod out of the city and giving him to Brienne as a squire was awesome too--showed his love for Tyrion and Brienne, as Pod did prove his skill at Blackwater

1974	Natasi	2014-04-29	Squeeeeeeeeeeeeee
That's about all the words I can muster right now. So happy.
1975	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-29	I liked it all. I loved how pod went from looking like the happiest guy on earth to frowning when Brienne said she didn't need a squire. plus the Ser/Milady stuff. Her lookingback hit me right in thefeels.

And that look she gave Jaime.

Pod's goofy little grin killed me! I luff him! And Jaiming walking after them.Â
1979	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-29	Thought both scenes were done well. Loved that transitioning shot to Pod's big smile.
Â 
I liked hearing Brienne read from Jaime's pages, and I especially liked her naming the sword. I think the key to both these scenes were what's implied, and not what was said. So much admiration and suppressed emotion between the two. Their farewell was really touching.

1981	Le Cygne	2014-04-29	Oh, I forgot, the measurements line was pretty awesome, a little subtley there. He was checking her out a wee bit, no? I always thought in the books, he told them to make her the dress in blue. Here he told them to make the armor in blue. That's even better.These two are just totally channeling the book characters, they could say gibberish and it would still come out as Jaime and Brienne.

1983	Shebara	2014-04-29	Just wonderful! Wonderful scenes of 2 of my beloved characters together, wonderful scripted, wpmderfiA¶ acted!
1984	Envie	2014-04-29	Every scene between Jaime and Brienne each season has been perfect and spot on. They really have the chemistry and subtlety down so well. Now that I've been watching the show for so long, I can't imagine Brienne looking the way George described her in the books at all. Gwendoline Christie has become Brienne in my mind. I know she's actually a beautiful woman (she knocked me out on the red carpet photos) and probably not what everyone imagined Brienne before the show, but I'm so so glad they chose her now. And of course Nicolai seems to have been born to play Jaime. *swoon* <3
1985	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-29	Both actors are great in their roles and their chemistry is very good. Plus, Pod was really adoreable in his scenes.
1986	Dofs	2014-04-29	One thing did bother me about the scenes with Brienne and Jaime, and Jaime portrayal overall. I guess with his hand, Jaime has completely lost his sense of humor, his sharp tongue and his overall Jaime-like attitude from earlier seasons. And that's a pity. In the books Jaime never looses his dignity and has so many great lines but in the show he is now just looking sad and humbled all the time.Â
1987	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	I love those two, fuck the sept scene because I cant just forget about it but I loved the jaime/brienne scenes this episode.
1988	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-29	Yeah, that was another good reason for her to name it. I'm sold. And how cute was Pod, he was so happy to be her squire, I just love that about him. Didn't matter that she was a woman at all. And he did the Ser... My lady... perfectly. And that look she gave Jaime.


I'm just sad they are using Bronn instead of Ilyn Payne for Jaime's sparing partner. It would be a nice parallel between two loyal Paynes - Pod and Ilyn. Bronn is great, but the parallel is lost as is the emphasis on Paynes' loyalty to Lannisters, which will be imho very important when Brienne&Jaime reach crazed, undead LS. Other than that, Brienne/Jaime two scenes in the latest episode were romantic, deep, meaningful and heartbreaking. Superb acting.
1989	Daske	2014-04-29	I thought this was near perfect. And that new armour was staggering. Looks like he got her measuremets spot-on!

  How can people still be affected by the 'rape' scene.Â
1992	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-29	How can people still be affected by the 'rape' scene.Â  


There was no rape. Cersei acts like Tywin. As long as you are perfectly beautiful, you are acceptable, but if you become a cripple, a dwarf or a broken thing, then go away from the perfect blond lion herd. And she suddenly remembered incest is wrong. Big BS. I love Jaime and it's good she helps him to stop loving her. And she called Brienne a big cow. Is that an ugly green monster emerging in drunken Cersei?
1993	Clariana	2014-04-29	it's an elegant way to say "I've see you naked and I haven't forgotten". 


Â 
Its also a nice way of saying "you haven't got a conventional figure, but I respect that", it must be pretty expensive to have a suit of armour tailor made and for a female...Â  
Â 
Jaime just spent a heap of money ensuring she looked the biz!

Not so. He was pretty witty in his scene with Tyrion sizing up his brother's new accommodation. Great dialogue scene, but around Brienne lately he's always pretty tongue-tied and that tells us a lot, actually.

And he was witty when introducing Pod to Brienne.
1996	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-29	I loved the fact that Brienne read JaimeÂ´s passage in the book. The way the scene played it was evident for me that Jaime asked her to do it. I think it is lovely. It really shows that he feels comfortable with her. That they have such a bond and intimacy. He doesnÂ´t mind sharing with her his discontent that he hasnÂ´t achieved that much up to now, his discontent for being called the Kingslayer. 
Â 
I also liked the fact that Brienne seemed to be embarrassed when she read the part with the â<U+0080><U+009C>kingslayerâ<U+0080><U+009D>; she didnÂ´t seem to feel comfortable. Which was nice. It shows how much she has changed towards Jaime. I also liked the fact that Jaime wanted to tell Brienne that he has decided to make a stand, to decide his destiny and to do good things. He could have just told Brienne that Cercei is looking for Sansa and hence Brienne must go and protect her. But the way the scene played, Jaime actually said: â<U+0080><U+009C>I have decided to be the knight I have always wanted to be. I will write my own history and I will fill these pages with good things to be remembered by. And I want you to know it. You, on the other hand, go and protect Sansa and fulfill your vowâ<U+0080><U+009D>. I like the fact that Jaime doesnÂ´t say it is his vow, too (like he doesnÂ´t want to acknowledge the fact that he is actually keeping his word), but Brienne is not fooled by his words, and she does acknowledge that Jaime is actually keeping his word and that keeping his word is important to him. Hence her words that she will find Sansa also for Jaime. 
Â 
I loved the way he presented the sword to her, like a knight to his lady J. I loved the fact that he mentioned it was NedÂ´s sword. Good for you, showJaime, putting 2 and 2 together and figuring it out. I was actually afraid that they wonÂ´t mention that it is NedÂ´s Stark, and I was very glad to see the line was there. I loved the way she was not able to look him in the eye when she saw the armor. She was so overwhelmed. And the way her voice faltered when she said that she will find Sansa also for him. And especially the way he was really touched when she said this. It was the same reaction as in the goodbye scene in season 3. She acknowledged his honor. And he acknowledged her appreciation and her trust in him. Lovely.
Â 
As regards the goodbye scene,Â the more I see it, the more emotional it makes me. Loved his intent to light up the mood at the beginning. Joking about Pod being a good lad and all. I loved the way he sort of manipulated her sentimentally: when she said that she didnÂ´t need a squire, he told her Pod was in danger and it would be knightly and honorable of Brienne to help him out. So there was nothing else for Brienne to do than accept Pod. Good for you again, Jaime. Being smart and all. But then, when he had to actually said goodbye, his mood changed, and you could actually feel it. Loved the fact that he said her name and she couldnÂ´t say anything back. That her chin trembled and she was so obviously on the verge of tears, that you could see her getting away because she was starting crying, that when she turned to look back at Jaime she was almost crying if not crying already, and the effort it took her to keep going. That you could see Jaime emotional as well. His eyes were teary. And the way he walked a little towards her as she was moving away, the image of the trees, and of her getting further and further away. And the music, it was perfect. It created a sort of tension. You could feel it was not an ordinary moment. It was special; it was important.

The strength is gone from her."Â  And you knew all along that's why he'd been doing it.Â I love those two, fuck the sept scene because I cant just forget about it but I loved the jaime/brienne scenes this episode.True, they well and truly fucked up there.

Â 
I think with those he trusts, he lets his guard down, losing his sword hand is a terrible blow to someone like Jaime. His whole identity was tied to it, now he has to find himself again. He will get no judgement from Tyrion and Brienne, and I think the only other time he tried to appear as though he was still the same man, formidable and commanding was in episode 2, the conversation with Loras but that blew up in his face because anything related to Cersei is now proving to be his undoing. Once he decides to do things for Jaime, that's when we'll see the confident Jaime that's been missing since returning to KL.

Lovely post. We have seen the acknowledgement of deep and meaningful love between a man and a woman who are knights first and foremost, but who wished they were just a man and a woman. It was moving.
2002	rmholt	2014-04-29	I'm glad he wasn't as rude as in the book, though she has such low self esteem it doesn't touch her.
They like and respect each other and shipping that to romantic love would not fit at this point. For one thing, neither one is interested at all in shipping with anyone. On the evidence there's nothing pointing that direction in the books. Her facial expression at the PW was apparently supposed to mean she realized she had romantic love for Jaime - fine - and things can change in the books, but isn't their relationship now something awesome? She knows a man she almost trusts and whom she respects and doesn't fear. She had a similar relationship with Catlyn - so two friends for a woman with few friends. It's great as it is - B & J is a healthy relationship as it is, contrast his relationship with Cersei - when he was a dissolute man, nothing but a fighter with one fit of honor when he killed Aerys and gave up the throne. The relationship with Cersei wasn't letting him grow.

Can we talk about how fabulousÂ she looked in that armor? I wasn't even a Brienne and Jaime shipper before (or a shipper in general), but these scenes sealed it for me.
2005	Berry	2014-04-29	I have not been pleased with certain casting choices made by HBO but I have to admit these two were spot on. Gwendoline Christie and NCW are terrific actors that fit their roles perfectly. Every single one of their scenes have been spot on but their "Oathkeeper" scene really was something special.
Â 
Â 
My inner fangirl was jumping up and down
2006	goddessoftitsandwine	2014-04-29	I think they laid it on too thick.


Â 
Yeah, it lacked subtlety. Â  Â Â Â Â  Â 
Â 
Â 

One thing did bother me about the scenes with Brienne and Jaime, and Jaime portrayal overall. I guess with his hand, Jaime has completely lost his sense of humor, his sharp tongue and his overall Jaime-like attitude from earlier seasons. And that's a pity. In the books Jaime never looses his dignity and has so many great lines but in the show he is now just looking sad and humbled all the time.Â 

Â 
That's how I feel as well. Â He had some snark with Tyrion, but otherwise he's becoming rather bland and whitewashed when he's not raping people. Â In the book, he was his usual snarky, unnecessarily-insulting self when he said goodbye to Brienne. The show version was overly sentimental, with Jaime acting kind and generous, and looking like a lost puppy as she walked away. Â He did the same sad puppy look with Cersei, too.Â 
Â 
"Chase after Steelshanks, search for Sansa, or ride home to your isle of sapphires, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s naught to me"--sure Jaime actually wants her to use it to find and protect Sansa, that's why he called it Oathkeeper; but Jaime doesn't seem comfortable coming across as noble, or caring about people who aren't Lannisters. Â He does his best to be a bit of an asshole, even when his actions speak differently. Â Like throwing in that comment about her looking like an ugly horse, when he was giving her a nice gift (and the horse wasn't even ugly), or getting angry and thinking of her as "bleating like a bloody sheep" when she touched a nerve about his honour. Â In the show, he said her name all lovingly, when in the book he harshly called her Wench again.
Â 
I can see why shippers loved their scenes and prefer that he wasn't at all rude like in the book, but I personally love Asshole Jaime. Â Though this scene did make me look forward to Brienne and Pod. Â Her chapters were a chore to read in AFFC, hopefully the show will make her journey more entertaining.Â
2007	RandomSmallfolk	2014-04-29	Like many other things in the show, Jaime's emotional transition is being "sped up" a bit.... and maybe a tad exageratted for the unsullied..
Â 
No biggie.. the story is still a ton of fun and the actors are just kiling it.
2008	Ruin	2014-04-29	The "Oathkeeper" line was great.Â  Jaime and Brienne have great chemistry in the show, and I'm positive that the Brienne and Pod scenes will also be great.
2009	Dofs	2014-04-29	Â 
I think with those he trusts, he lets his guard down, losing his sword hand is a terrible blow to someone like Jaime. His whole identity was tied to it, now he has to find himself again. He will get no judgement from Tyrion and Brienne, and I think the only other time he tried to appear as though he was still the same man, formidable and commanding was in episode 2, the conversation with Loras but that blew up in his face because anything related to Cersei is now proving to be his undoing. Once he decides to do things for Jaime, that's when we'll see the confident Jaime that's been missing since returning to KL.


Â 
I hope so, but I have a hard time believing it. Jaime was always sarcastic, snarky and witty in the books. Even when he lost his hand and wanted to die he still made japes on couldn't help but laugh at certain things. But in the show , the lines like 'i wanted to hear him saying 'thaphireth'', ' I only rescue maidens" and many others were cut, his line to Roose that he didn't lose his hand, its around his neck was given to Locke, now in King's Landing he is getting beaten verbally by almost everybody he talks with. Joffrey made fun out of him, you have mentioned about Loras, Cersei is being a bitch to him and he just listens to her (until he rapes her, lol!), Tywin, Tyrion are all telling him what he should do with his life, now we have even Bronn giving him advices in how should he fight. In the scenes with Brienne I've thought he was going to cry.
Â 
I do hope that we are going to get back the confident Jaime but I feel that the way he now behaves is a path that the show-runners have taken and we are going to be left with this bland Jaime for the end of the show. If they are gong to make him confident and sarcastic in the future, why make not make him like that now? The usual sarcastic Jaime we all know from the books has died in the show when his hand was cut off, I am afraid.

2012	Le Cygne	2014-04-29	They like and respect each other and shipping that to romantic love would not fit at this point. For one thing, neither one is interested at all in shipping with anyone. On the evidence there's nothing pointing that direction in the books. Her facial expression at the PW was apparently supposed to mean she realized she had romantic love for Jaime - fine - and things can change in the books, but isn't their relationship now something awesome?I'll plant these quotes here, but I'm seeing the framework of a love story on the written pages, and the author said he's writing a Beauty and the Beast story, which is a love story. Love is pretty awesome, too.http://asoiaf.wester...13#entry3372068
2013	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	jaime's look on his face when she says "oathkeeper" was perfect.


Â 
I agree.Â  That look made it very worthwhile that the naming of the sword was given to Brienne.Â  That was a nice touch and does show that, sometimes, D&D do have good ideas.Â  The perfection of the look between them made the change worthwhile.Â
2014	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	Â 
Pod's goofy little grin killed me! I luff him! And Jaiming walking after them.Â 


Â 
Absolutely, and the Ser, My Lady has me hopeful that Brienne and Pod will get me through the lack of Brienne and Jaime.Â  They truly are one of the brightest gifts the tv show has given us, Jaime and Brienne, I mean.Â  I love the hell out book and tv Pod, so I'm looking forward to them, too.Â  It just seems to have more promise than I'd even hoped it would.Â  That, and the added touch of Jaime setting it up, for both Tyrion and Brienne was a nice touch.Â  Pod's goofy grin, it was almost very bookish, Podwise.Â
2015	fangirl000	2014-04-29	That's a good point, I liked that they called back to that.
I also liked when he started walking after her, and she looked back.
They are both wonderful in the roles, I can't say enough good things.
Â 
Yeah, I think her feelings for him were throwing her for a loop, too.
They both looked like they were saying goodbye to the one person they didn't want to say goodbye to.


Â 
Brienne is saying goodbye to one of the few people, perhaps the ONLY person, in the kingdom who actually respects her fighting abilities and doesn't make fun of her appearance (any more). Â Her treatment by the other noble women at King's Landing was supposed to remind us that Brienne is largely a fish out of water in Westros.
Â 
Jamie is saying goodbye to someone who accepts that he lost a hand and hasn't treated him like a leper for it. Â And she pushes him to be the honorable knight that he WANTS to be, but too often isn't, because of his family obligations. Â She respects him, where he doesn't even respect himself.
Â 
They had each other's backs through some pretty dangerous encounters. Â Their friendship is solid, and while I don't think they are in love quite yet, I think they sort of sense the potential is there. Â For example, I really don't think Brienne considered the question of whether or not she loved Jamie until Cersei flat out asked about it. Â

2016	Ankou	2014-04-29	Yes, but is Pod the only man in the Seven Kingdoms with the skill to satisfy Brienne?Â
2017	rmholt	2014-04-29	I'll plant these quotes here, but I'm seeing the framework of a love story on the written pages, and the author said he's writing a Beauty and the Beast story, which is a love story. Love is pretty awesome, too.http://asoiaf.wester...13#entry3372068

Right, he finds himself reacting to her as well and they are both resisting those thoughts.
Not saying there isn't love, just right now it isn't romantic love. I think it's something higher-level. Romantic lovers can break up. Good friends are friends forever. There is some attraction but most boy-girl friendships get a little of that, wanted or not.
After looking through variants of Beauty and the Beast especially summaries of the TV show I have no idea what this reference means without context. All the characters have both qualities and in some relationships like B + J the relationship is positive for each which might be the context here. 
But that's JMHO. Is there a group of people that thinks they are going to marry, have a love affair, or moon about one another? If so I'm not in that group - and I hope they don't. It's a fairy tale and GRRM has said he doesn't write that kind of fantasy if I read his statements right.
2018	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	Every scene between Jaime and Brienne each season has been perfect and spot on. They really have the chemistry and subtlety down so well. Now that I've been watching the show for so long, I can't imagine Brienne looking the way George described her in the books at all. Gwendoline Christie has become Brienne in my mind. I know she's actually a beautiful woman (she knocked me out on the red carpet photos) and probably not what everyone imagined Brienne before the show, but I'm so so glad they chose her now. And of course Nicolai seems to have been born to play Jaime. *swoon* <3


Â 
This is where I have to point out that I do think GRRM's extremes are a bit too much.Â  Everyone is either unnaturally beautiful or absolutely hideous, and that isn't how it works, IMO.Â  Most people are somewhere inbetween, and the more you know them, the more their beauty and attractiveness can be found.Â  I'm not so sure why he, GRRM, has to go to such extremes with the looks, but it is one of the things that really, really bug me.Â
2019	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	And he was witty when introducing Pod to Brienne.


Â 
I loved how Jaime threw in the idea of chivalry, since Brienne seemed to be denying the need of a squire.Â  That was a sweet touch, and shows how much Jaime knows of what makes Brienne the Beauty tick.Â

2020	Angielina	2014-04-29	Loved this episode! And as far as Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline is concerned, the rape scene melted away in the superior acting of Nikolaj and Gwen. There was some really beautiful emotional work here by the two of them. I was in tears all throughout the goodbye, and what a nice touch that Jaime initiates the goodbye this time, and not Brienne. Highly symbolic, now that Cersai is out of the picture, which is part of the function the rape accomplished (see my previous comment under Nikolajâ<U+0080><U+0099>s article, #130 for my thoughts on the rape). The rape scene in the show between Jaime and Cersai is Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s darkest moment by far.
Â 
But out of darkness, comes light, there we have the contrast again (fire/ice), and we have the giving of Oathkeeper, and the charge to Brienne. Might Oathkeeper become Lightbringer? I have wondered about that given the flaming sword on Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s armor.
Â 
It might be nice for the fans if they did show a love scene with Jaime and Brienne, to not only show Jaime does have a full capacity to love as well as to soothe the â<U+0080><U+009C>traumaâ<U+0080><U+009D> the rape scene caused for some fans of Jaime. It is quite clear now they love each other. Great episode.

Â 
"Not the time for it"... except it literally was the time for it, in canon. Â Jaime is not a good guy or a bad guy, he's very ambiguous. Â But the show goes to both extremes, so yes, viewers are going to complain about both. Frankly, the show lacks subtlety when portraying Jaime. Â They exaggerate his evils by making him kill his cousin in cold blood, and then exaggerate his goodness by making him seem adorably sweet in other scenes, like this last one. Â That's just not Jaime. Â It's not nit-picky to expect them to a better job at translating him to the screen; the dialogue is all there, and Nikolaj is talented enough to portray underlaying emotions.
Â 
This last episode's portrayal of Jaime had all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.Â

Â 
Those lines were pretty pathetic, if you ask me, considering that he still was made fun of by Joffrey and got told off by Tywin. Why current Jaime portrayal bothers me is because now Jaime acts nothing like in the books. That's just not Jaime. Sure, his portrayal in the show makes sense, I guess, but it still makes book Jaime and show Jaime as different as two versions of Shae or Littlefinger are. It's just a pity that due to completely exaggerated efforts to make him likable in the show, a lot of his great lines and scenes got cut. Â

2026	Buzzard16	2014-04-30	I thought Jamie/ Brienne scene showed so much of their complex relationship without either actually saying anything. I so want to see these two side by side in combat.Â  Please.

					
					
							Edited by Buzzard16, 30 April 2014 - 01:26 AM.
2027	Sun	2014-04-30	I think they did lay it on a little thick but with good reason. The audience won't be seeing those two together for a long time, and when they do see each other again one of the two will have changed, due to what she will have gone through, quite significantly. They wanted the scene to show unambiguously the relationship those two have so that next year's events will have the looked for impact.
Â 
Actually, the very fact that the scene was so dramatically heavy - sincere remarks, yearning looks and near tears - tells me that one of them will defo die as a result of the LS (or if she's cut, a show manufactured equivalent) encounter, and likely at the other's hand, or for the other's sake. Â Â I really hope I'm wrong about this, and it turns out to be nothing more than the show writers eschewing subtlety.

2030	Follmann	2014-04-30	It was my favorite scene this season so far. So well written and directed, and above well so perfectly acted.

And, lastly: Pod.

I hope/think you're right. Either that, or they have a sort of bargaining/truce (Red Wedding 2.0 maybe ?). Simply dying at the hands of LS would be a little anti-climatic imo, considering how it's been set up.

She's stuck between a rock and hard place. On one hand you have Pod and Hyle Hunt, who, if you don't bring Jaime, may very well die, and on the other, you're bringing a guy to his death for a crime he did not commit. Either way you're screwed.

2043	teemo	2014-05-01	It was a little cheesy in the end but I guess they wanted to get the point across that Brienne means a lot to Jaime now. Â Although I think that shows by him giving her Oathkeeper and telling her to find the Stark girls.

This!
You said what I always thought and did realize clearly. Actually this is a trap fiction tends to fall into, characterizing people not by making their looks individual and special but by positioning them somewhene on the attractiveness scale, a judgemental quantity statement instead of quality. And Martin tries to avoid that trap by having one ugly heroine while so many just have to be exceptionally beautiful. How would the fate of Dany or Sansa have been different if they looked like you and me, nice, moderately pretty but not remarkable at all? Wouldn't they be worth a story?
Actually the average person in RL is of average attractiveness  - and yet we all are of so very different looks.
2045	TheKitttenGuard	2014-05-01	Â 
When has Jaime given you the impression that he cared for Joff?Â 

Screaming out Joffrey while shoving people aside to get to him while he was choking to death.
2046	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-01	Could be that the looks of the characters are interpreted by bias: Is Dany as beautiful as everyone says or is that flattery and the power adding to her beauty? Is it a relative thing, where the mostly noble characters with fairly attractive genes can afford and have the nutrition to be more attractive? Just like rich areas liek Chelsea are full of generally very attractive people because they can afford to go to teh gym more often and get stylists etc in?
2047	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-01	Screaming out Joffrey while shoving people aside to get to him while he was choking to death.


Well, he was also the king Jaime was meant to be guarding!
2048	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-01	Well, he was also the king Jaime was meant to be guarding!


Â 
Exactly. Silly argument.Â
2049	Frey Pies	2014-05-01	Is it just me, or is "Bryan Cogman + NCW" the best combination in all of Game of Thrones.
Â 
Oathkeeper & bath scene... too much awesomeness
2050	TheKitttenGuard	2014-05-01	Well, he was also the king Jaime was meant to be guarding!
What about yelling out "Your Grace"?  With no personal connection.
Also, what about his conversation with Tyrion in the cell? It not one that gave Jamie has the disconnect as he did in the book.

2051	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-01	Is it just me, or is "Bryan Cogman + NCW" the best combination in all of Game of Thrones.
Â 
Oathkeeper & bath scene... too much awesomeness 


Cogman is definitely a big fan of Jaime, and the Jaime/Brienne pairing ; which is awesome as he's also one of the best writers, soÂ fans of these characters are bound to have great quality scenes.Â
2052	MsLibby	2014-05-01	It will be interesting to see how fast they speed up their story line from the books. If things continue this fast we may learn their fate before the next book comes out.
Â 
I'm ok with that, but how do you all feel?
2053	Le Cygne	2014-05-01	It will be interesting to see how fast they speed up their story line from the books. If things continue this fast we may learn their fate before the next book comes out.Â I'm ok with that, but how do you all feel?But will we learn their fate, that's the question. So many changes. Would we still read the last book a couple years later, if the ending falls flat? Not looking forward to that.
2054	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	Brienne and Pod are featured in the recap for the next episode btw. So we'll get a bit of their travels on Sunday, you all.
2055	acosta	2014-05-01	I can't help but wonder if the people saying the farewell was cheesy have ever actually said goodbye to someone they loved knowing they might never see them again. Even for hardened war veterans, it tends to be a pretty cheesy moment in real life.
2056	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-02	Brienne and Pod are featured in the recap for the next episode btw. So we'll get a bit of their travels on Sunday, you all.


Yay ! I'm really worried about what they're going to do with Brienne, but I'm looking forward to her scenes anyway.

While I don't want to get my hopes up, part of me is pretty optimistic about the J/B outcome : there's a huge build-up, both in the books and the show, and it wouldn't make sense for them to put such emphasis on them if it led to nowhere/ fell flat.
2057	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	As sad as it is I think one of them will kill the other one. I haven't figured out the specifics yet though.

Â 
I don't remember if when Jaime said this it was to her, but Brienne is going to realise that Jaime's right about how many vows eventually end up contradicting to each other or in due time, end up being ridiculous. She swore to serve Cat Tully but Jaime has changed now and he's definitely a better man than the guy Cat knew. She would serve little purpose killing him, specially because he had nothing to do with the RW.
2060	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	^Sadly LSH is beyond reason. When the fuck is TWOW going to come out! I have to know what happens! That and the Battle of Ice keep me worried day and goddamn night!
2061	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-02	^Sadly LSH is beyond reason. When the fuck is TWOW going to come out! I have to know what happens! That and the Battle of Ice keep me worried day and goddamn night!


Ugh, I know. Have mercy, George !Â (see what I did there)
Â 
A likely outcome (if we consider there's no way LS would negotiate) is Brienne killing LS, thus Learning some vows need to be broken, and all that jazz.
2062	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-02	Yay ! I'm really worried about what they're going to do with Brienne, but I'm looking forward to her scenes anyway.

If George kills them before they at least make a baby, my heart will be broken. I don't think LS will force them to kill each other. She will certainly try, but I think someone will interfere. I'm looking forward to that scene immensely.Â
2063	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	That and the Red Wedding 2.0 are the cleanest possible outcomes, HairGrowsBackÂ  but I'm worried that the two will have to fight one another and that Oathkeeper will be used by one of them to kill the other one. Jaime's dream on the weirwood stump gives important hints about how this situation will end, and IMOÂ it doesn't seem to imply anything positive will come of all of it.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 02 May 2014 - 04:36 AM.
2064	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-02	^ Red Wedding 2.0 would be amazing, although hell would porbably be unleashed for everyone eventually : if it ever happens, it won't beÂ the neat, hopeful vengeance some people consider.
There's also Thoros "wildcard" of Myr, who seems really non-plussed with what the Brotherhood has become.
I do not deny, however, that your scenario is very likely, but at this point I just want to know what happens, even if it breaks my heart into a million of tiny pieces.
2065	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	If LSH is to die I'd like her to fry LF somehow. So many plot threads would have to come together to make that work and I don't know if there'd even be time for it to happen in TWOW alone, but just imagine a scenario where he goes to a wedding and thinks that he's going to get one up on the Freys and steal the Riverlands for himself from them...and then they all burn. It'd be even better if Sansa tricked him into that somehow. But that sounds too clean. Whatever happens won't be clean.

2066	SeventySeven	2014-05-02	I was underwhelmed at the start, because it was different in my mind; I read asos 10+ years ago so I had a clear image of that scene which was obviously never going to match up. But then I realised that they adapted it really wonderfully, it was actually quite surprising. When Brienne got teary so did I, and it was emotional and heartbreaking, and really quite romantic. It was perfect, basically.
Â 
Now it's all downhill though, so yeahÂ  
Â 
Â 


Right, he finds himself reacting to her as well and they are both resisting those thoughts.Not saying there isn't love, just right now it isn't romantic love. I think it's something higher-level. Romantic lovers can break up. Good friends are friends forever. There is some attraction but most boy-girl friendships get a little of that, wanted or not.
After looking through variants of Beauty and the Beast especially summaries of the TV show I have no idea what this reference means without context. All the characters have both qualities and in some relationships like B + J the relationship is positive for each which might be the context here.
But that's JMHO. Is there a group of people that thinks they are going to marry, have a love affair, or moon about one another? If so I'm not in that group - and I hope they don't. It's a fairy tale and GRRM has said he doesn't write that kind of fantasy if I read his statements right.


Â 
BIB: Why is love not high level, and why can't two people be both? I'd say the best romantic relationships are based on friendship, too.
Â 
As for the beauty & the beast, this is something grrm said. With j/b he's writing a reversed, gender swapped beauty & the beast. That doesn't mean they're going to end up married with a bunch of tall badass children, love can be tragic and however it goes it will be.
Â 


I think they did lay it on a little thick but with good reason. The audience won't be seeing those two together for a long time, and when they do see each other again one of the two will have changed, due to what she will have gone through, quite significantly. They wanted the scene to show unambiguously the relationship those two have so that next year's events will have the looked for impact.
Â 
Actually, the very fact that the scene was so dramatically heavy - sincere remarks, yearning looks and near tears - tells me that one of them will defo die as a result of the LS (or if she's cut, a show manufactured equivalent) encounter, and likely at the other's hand, or for the other's sake. Â Â I really hope I'm wrong about this, and it turns out to be nothing more than the show writers eschewing subtlety.


Â 
Noooooo, no. It's been so long since I read affc the first time, and I've now convinced myself that for them to die during the Uncat encounter would make little sense. I hope it was done to let us know what they mean to each other. Tv audiences would tend to forget about their connection, when they're apart (nad they'll be apart for a while).
2067	Le Cygne	2014-05-02	When Brienne got teary so did I, and it was emotional and heartbreaking, and really quite romantic.

Yes, same here. It was quite romantic.
Â 

Why is love not high level, and why can't two people be both? I'd say the best romantic relationships are based on friendship, too.

I know. Beauty and the Beast is a classic romance. And love stories have very simple beginnings, there's a seed that's planted, and it grows, there's no official, here's the flower, we can call it love now moment.
Also as if we thought anything in ASOIAF would end happily...
2068	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-02	Since this is a thread for Jaime and Brienne, I thought this would be a good place to post and ask:Â  Did anyone read the interview Ran posted on the Westeros GOT section?Â  It is a TERRIFIC interview, and he even notes that it is probably one of his favorite interviews ever.Â  I can believe it, I had a ball reading it and wish I could actually hear them all talking and laughing.Â  Having just found it myself, I thought I would mention that it is up on the site and ask what others thought of it.Â

They really are wonderful.Â  I wish we could hear or see that interview, reading it was great, I'm sure seeing and hearing would only improve it.Â  They really ARE Jaime and Brienne.Â
2071	Newstar	2014-05-03	I have to say, I got a crack out of this. The Tumblr fandom is on point.
Â 
Was I the only one reminded by Jaime walking towards Brienne as she rides away as if helplessly drawn by an inexorable force of that scene in the BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South when Margaret is in the carriage leaving and John Thornton can't look away as the carriage pulls away and says quietly "Look back. Look back at me" and there's a long closeup of his tormented, heartbroken expression? Just me, then? Right. Ahem.
Â 
As for whether the writers/actors laid it on a little thick in the farewell scene...maybe so, but I get it. They won't meet again for at least a season or so, so they have to telegraph the feelings and the strength of the characters' connection while they can as strongly as possible to carry that bond through so that the characters' reunion will mean something to the typical TV viewer with a typical TV viewer attention span.
Â 
I dunno how the show will handle Brienne and the BWB. In the book, they were an actual crew, but in the show, it's three named characters--one of whom (Beric) should already be dead going off the books--and a bunch of henchmen.
Â 
Â 
Â 
 I hope it was done to let us know what they mean to each other. Tv audiences would tend to forget about their connection, when they're apart (nad they'll be apart for a while).
Â 
That's my take as well, although I still think one or the other could die as a result of the upcoming UnCat confrontation.

LOL, but damn... Gwendoline looks GORGEOUS there while NCW looks like "yeah, I'm just recovering. I was hot once, you know?". I wonder if that's intentional. If it was, my respects.
2073	Wethers	2014-05-03	Did the Jaime/Brienne farewell remind anyone of the Ned/Catelyn farewell in Season 1?
Both characters in Kings Landing, recently arrived, he sends her off on her horse with Rodrik, I mean Podrick.  Glancing back, deep emotion.  He is staying.  Duty.  She will meet trouble on the road.
Of course in Ned and Catelyn's case, they never see each other again.  This time around, Brienne is carrying part of Ned's sword to help her keep her oath to Cat.
2074	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	Someone on tumblrÂ put Star WarsÂ over it with Brienne saying "I love you" and Jaime saying "I know."

I agree, the scene was perfect, just the right amount of romance, longing, respect and sadness.
And when you realize a lot of people still don't see how deep their bound is, you may think they could've gone much further; but then I suspect those people still wouldn't see it if J&B made passionate love under a rainbow so ....
2077	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	^And the smidgeon of Pod and Bronn humour to make it all palatable. Michelle MacLaren is such a good director of Jaime/Brienne material and Cogman writes it so well. Loved it.
2078	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-03	^Agree, the humor was such a nice touch,Â  balanced nicely the emotional weight of the scene.

You do? Oh no, why? I used to as well, but then after over-thinking it for years, I've decided it would be anti-climatic for several reasons. I'm always scared when I see people thinking one of them will die though, it makes me unsure of my predictionsÂ  
Â 
RE Pod/Brienne: I love that she didn't want him because "he slows her down" and they left the ser/mylady bit in. They have such a nice relationship in the books and she really takes him under her wing, I'm glad so far it seems to work in the show as well, despite Pod being so different.

While I do think that Jaime or Brienne will die, eventually, (most likely Jaime), I do think they will both make it past LS in TWOW.Â  I suspect they both have more story, together and separately.........and I'm thinking both will make it to ADOS.Â  If anything, I suspect that LS may be the first one to go, again, LOL.Â

I'm just a pessimist, I guess. Bad things tend to happen when POVs converge on the same location or meet, unless they separate quickly again--Arya/Cat, Barristan/Quentyn, etc.--and now Jaime and Brienne, now both POVs, are traveling together.

Except that Pod said "m'lady" instead of "my lady," which wouldn't annoy me half as much if the show hadn't made a big deal out of clarifying the distinction. Damn, that bothered me! #nitpicker

Jaime/Cersei and Jon/Sam reunited, and yes they separated again fairly quickly and in j/c's case their relationship feel apart, but neither died while together. I'm sure there are more, but can't think of any now. But yes I agree in a sense, I don't expect them to travel together for very long. I'm usually a pessimist as well, but I've convinced myself there's more to come... aaand watch me get my heart broken when the show kills one of them off during the UnCat confrontation (because at this point I'm sure the show will go there first)Â

Â 
It's a BBC series based on Elizabeth Gaskell's 19th-century novel North and South, not to be confused with John Jakes' trilogy of novels about the Civil War. The BBC adaptation is boss: great acting, beautiful score, breathtaking cinematography, compelling writing. I lent the DVDs to my mother three years ago and have yet to get them back, since she was as taken with the series as I was. Highly recommend it.
Â 
Er, topic: I kind of liked Brienne naming Oathkeeper, as rather than it being a statement of Jaime's intention of adhering to his vow, it was a reflection of Brienne's respect for his decision. It was a sort of callback to Brienne calling Jaime "Ser Jaime" instead of "Kingslayer" after he told her in 3x07 that he would return the Stark girls to their mother: a way of conveying her esteem for his honour without actually saying as much. By contrast, "For Lady Catelyn. And for you" was a much less guarded and a much more personal form of expression; it was less about a friendship based on respect and more about a heartfelt expression of far more straightforwardly romantic feelings.
Â 
...In the show, there was also the clear parallel with TV Jon and Arya: Jon/Jaime giving Arya/Brienne a sword, Jon/Jaime telling Arya/Brienne all the best swords have names, Arya/Brienne naming their swords, Jon/Jaime and Arya/Brienne saying goodbye. Seems like an intentional parallel, although I don't think there's anything particularly significant about it; I'd love it if Arya and Brienne met at some point, of course. Hmm...maybe Pod and Brienne will run into the Hound and Arya? It would be a big deviation, but Brienne and Pod's quest has already kicked off as of 4x04, and the Hound and Arya have virtually run out of ASOS story with four episodes left (I'm not counting 4x09 since that's Wall-only). Of course, as I type that, it occurs to me that it mucks up a lot down the line, so maybe not. It could be that Pod/Brienne and the Hound/Arya just miss each other or similar.
Â 
I'm a bit on the fence about "For Lady Catelyn. And for you," since while I don't doubt that Brienne had those sentiments in the books--I had to laugh a bit at everyone getting all outraged at TV Brienne being implied to be in love with Jaime in 4x02, since it was really obvious to me in the books--I doubt she ever would have expressed them in that manner. It almost seems to be beneath Book Brienne's dignity, in a way. Naming the sword "Oathkeeper" seemed much more in keeping with Book Brienne: respect for Jaime keeping his promise.

Thanks for the information on the book vs books.Â  I did enjoy that bicentennial series in my preteens, it was a fun little read.Â Â  For some reason I was never interested in reading his North and South series, I suspected it was very similar to other series, just different characters.Â  I'll have to keep the novel and dvd you mentioned in mind, sounds like mom recommends it, too.
Â 
As far as the show and the topic, I thought Brienne naming the sword was a nice touch.Â  I may actually like it better this way.Â  I'm not a total couple shipper in any form for any couple, but I am starting to wonder what D&D know just because of the way they have things playing out.Â  I've always loved the characters, but have been unsure about where exactly GRRM is going with them.Â  I do think Brienne is in love with Jaime, as far as Jaime, though, I wonder if Cersei might cause him to swear off sex eternally, LOLÂ  I've always been back and forth on what I think the endgame may be, together and individually for the two of them......but I'm starting to think it might be safe to hope for something for them, no matter how brief it may be.Â  Or, how short a time one of them may have in the grand scheme of things.Â

Hildy? Innocence?? Turnips??? Methinks I need a reread.
About Brienne and Jaime, I'm not really a shipper. I'm more hoping Jaime will fullfill his hope of somehow protecting Tommen all the way through.
Also, I wanna know if that vision Bran had of him , Sansa, and some giant made of blood or something (sorry, been awhile since I picked up the books) is still in the works.

i know there's been lots of mention of the gender role reversal between these two but that scene really brings it to light! very curious to know what grrm has in store for them. curious and, of course, nervous, 'cause it's like, grrm, you know.
2095	Elba the Intoner	2014-05-07	Just catching up a bit on the show forums and saw this thread so I have to jump in to say that I too really liked these scenes.Â  At first when I saw Jaime I was still so bothered by his scene with Cersei in the Sept the previous episode that I just didn't want to care about him anymore, but then the scenes between Jaime and Brienne started playing out and I got hooked all over again and by the end I was just spellbound.Â  You could see them trying to hold it together.Â  That look at the end as Jaime starts walking towards Brienne as she is riding away just said it all without speaking a word.Â  It was the same with Brienne when she looks back.Â  So moving.Â  I love scenes like this where everything is done with body language and facial expressions and you don't need words to tell you exactly what they are feeling.Â  Superbly done - and the fact that they kept in Pod's Ser - Milady was icing on the cake!Â
2096	Le Cygne	2014-05-07	Those are the best scenes! I'm always amazed when people say you can't show thoughts on film, it's called acting.
2097	Elba the Intoner	2014-05-07	Those are the best scenes! I'm always amazed when people say you can't show thoughts on film, it's called acting.


LOL!Â  Yes, exactly!Â  That's why the actors get paid the big bucks :-)Â  NCW and GC are doing a fantastic job and are so great together.Â  I am a bit bummed that now they won't be having scenes together for quite a while though I am looking forward to Pod and Brienne.Â  I wonder how it will play out on the show because Pod is much older than in the books.Â  In the books they developed a very touching mother-son type of relationship, or perhaps big sister little brother dynamic.Â  I guess they could still develop a sibling dynamic like in the books though.Â  It's important that they come to care about each other because that is what places Brienne in such a difficult position later when she essentially has to choose between Pod and Jaime.
2098	Le Cygne	2014-05-08	It's important that they come to care about each other because that is what places Brienne in such a difficult position later when she essentially has to choose between Pod and Jaime.So true. He was an innocent. He's so sweet on the show, even though he's older. He seemed so happy again when she let him take off her armor! I love his expressions.
2099	meteor691998	2014-06-15	What did we all think?


I think it was one of the scenes where I didn't mind that D&D departed from the books. Both actors were great in conveying their complex emotions without saying a word.Â 
I also loved the parallelism between the Jaime and Brienne goodbye scene here and the goodbye scene between Ned and Cat in S1.
2100	skittles72	2014-12-13	One of the best
2101	Nathan Lyons	2014-04-28	In the books, I feel we got very minimal Tyrion and Jaime interactions. So, I am absolutely delighted with the screen time that these two have this season. The chemistry between those two characters and actors is great! 
So, am I alone in believing that the show has bestowed us with a truly amazing gift?
2102	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	yea they're both awesome actors and seem to really work well with each other. hopefully they get more screen time together.
2103	Mad Monkey	2014-04-28	Maybe they could add a subplot where Tyrion and Jaime are a pair of elite detectives solving Joffrey's murder. They could call it Kingsguard Criminal Investigative Service/(KCIS) or CSI: King's Landing or Law and Order: Regicidal Intent.Seriously though, I think it was definitely a great choice to have Jaime and Tyrion hang out more.

2107	TheBadboy	2014-04-28	Bran and Jon at same place!!!!! 
I desperately want to see a Stark Reunion!  
And some people are complaining that why will Jon let Bran go if he meets him 
Possible reasons
1. Locked is there. He tries to kill Bran and Co. Jon realises that Bran isn't safe at the Wall or even In the south. 
2. Bran saves the day by some of his magical prowess and warging abilities. 
Ensuring Jon that he can take care himself. 
3. Possibly Bran faces a Wight and manages to overcome it and makes Jon believe that his ultimate goal that is to defeat the others requires him to go north. 
4, Jon is bound by duty to wall and with the upcoming wildlings war, he can't possibly abandon it. 
5. Bran promises to find out the truth about others and what happened to the Craster's babies. 
6. Tells him Rickon is alive and is going to the Umbers,  and asks Jon to go protect him instead. 
And tells Jon that even if something happens to him a Stark will still be alive 
So why can't Jon meet Bran already!!!!
2108	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	it would be a nice moment since the starks have been through so much but i can't see why jon would let bran travel north in harm's way of white walkers and mance's army. i agree with you it would def be cool but in the books jon thinks bran is dead so i think that bran and co. might escape during the chaos at crasters so jon will probably never know he's even there. but you never know D&D could switch it up and give the audience something good to feel about we'll just have to wait and see.Â
2109	Night'sQueen	2014-04-28	I'm guessing D&D are going to provide show watchers with a heartbreaking near miss and not an actual meetup. But who knows? The show has been full of surprises lately.
2110	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-29	I desperately want one too, especially seeing as the 'damage' has already been done with Jon knowing Bran is alive so what harm can catching a glimpse of each other do?
Â 
This might be the closest thing Bran gets to Stark reunion... 
Â 
Â Who says their interaction has to end with Jon letting Bran go North?
Â 
It might just be Jon seeing Bran amongst the chaos and telling him to get the hell out of there, creating a distraction for him to escape. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to get the chance to sit down and chat with Bran when surrounded by fighting.
Â 
Also, Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s line in this episode about finding it difficult not to go after Bran has undertones of duty vs love and acceptance in it.
Â 
Either way, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be very disappointed if the whole point in Bran being captured was just to tease the audience with another near miss.
2111	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-29	I don't want them to meet at Craster's, and I doubt they will. The separation of the Starks is a massive pillar. Things need to stay that way until the time is right.
2112	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	They're just teasing.
Â 
Teasing is nice.
Â 
Many a good tease becomes a platitude if not done right
2113	Chebyshov	2014-04-29	I'm more worried about Jon meeting the Reeds. Too early forÂ that reveal, IMO.
Â 
I'm also assuming this will be another Stark-meetup miss. Which is what they're setting up for Sansa and Arya, too.
2114	Sand11751	2014-04-29	I want it to happen too, but it's impractical. Jon isn't traveling alone. Even if he lets Bran continue with his quest, are any of the NW who survive Craster's with him going to swear to secrecy that one legitimate Stark is very much alive? I've always questioned GRRM's plotting that lets Sam know Bran's alive with no mention to Jon, but it's more practical than to have them meet and then Jon lets Bran slip away. I'm also going to completely ignore how the show's meanderings nullify the possibility of Jon being legitimized as a Stark the way Robb or Stannis intended. Â  Â
2115	sj4iy	2014-04-29	It probably won't happen, but I could see how it would work. Â Jon hasn't had any prophetic dreams or is able to warg into Ghost yet, where in the story, Bran helped him in his dreams. Â Maybe they could use this as a way to remedy that in the show? Â Who knows, but I'm excited to see it.

Â 
Hmmmmmm, that is a good point, the Reeds and will they or won't they run into Jon and have some information for him?Â  I hadn't even thought of that, probably because I'm too busy half the time wondering what is the point of some of these changes.Â  I'm thinking there might not be a meeting for Jon and Bran, maybe this is about course correction.Â  I'm starting to suspect that the show didn't want Sam to have to keep such a secret and now we have the setup for Jon to just come to the conclusion, perhaps, by things done at Craster's Keep, that Bran dies before or during this mess?
Â

A lot of this is course correction...without CH, someone has to kill the mutineers. This also sets up Jon being a commander better than him moping in an ice cell, so I don't mind it that much.

Â 
Truthfully everything about this plot is stressing me out; this is why I read the books! I'm really worried about Meera being surrounded by Rapey McRapers, Locke's function is confusing me, and then there's the whole Ghost is in a cage and Summer is in a pit. The Reeds likely carrying the R+L=J bomb is just another element that's concerning me. Not that I don't want to know, but for Jon to knowÂ before becoming LC? Huge huge change.

I do agree with you, but here's a weird thought I had perusing the board just now.Â  The next episode is called:Â  The First of His Name.Â  While I suspect it is about Tommen, you know how it goes......many times the show title has more than one meaning.Â  Jon Snow Stark Targaryen, The First of His Name??Â  I doubt it, but just seeing the title of that episode on the board just now has me wondering and worrying, LOL
Â 
I do think this is a way to absolve Sam of such secret keeping (as stupid as that is, rme).Â  I suspect Jon will know of Summer's existance, and just like in the books, think perhaps the wolf is the only one left?Â  Maybe?Â
2120	ovis alba	2014-04-29	Jon Snow Stark Targaryen, The First of His Name??Â

Â 
Eh. Â Let's admit it: Â it was a bad choice. Â Jon knowing Bran is alive is wrong on many levels of character development...unless they have him think that Bran dies a second time, which is like Dallas level melodrama...it's a bad choice that undercuts much of what Jon does in the future. Â Book Jon wouldn't let his brother go North like that, at a minimum he would send some rangers or go himself...which he can do now, since he's not LC, Thorne would be happy to get rid of him in such a way, nor would he do nothing to find Rickon if he thought he was alive also. It's asinine.
Â 
I don't think it has anything to do with Sam, TV audience doesn't pay attention to that level of stuff...it's just about cranking up the drama.
2122	rmholt	2014-04-29	Not me.
2123	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-29	I'm guessing D&D are going to provide show watchers with a heartbreaking near miss and not an actual meetup. But who knows? The show has been full of surprises lately.


Â 
I agree but I also think that seems kind of pointless considering Queenscrow was less than 10 episodes ago..the whole converging of plotlines with Locke thrown in (that part I like at least the general idea of it) baffled me..
Â 
-Mutineers at Craster's Keep is fine - Even Karl painted up for someone you want to hate on TV is fine for a short-term plot
Â 
But jumping from one episode of 'We have to capture or kill them for strategic reasons' to 'Where could Bran have gone?' 'Wildling villages are empty maybe he went to Crasters' and 'Let's take this new guy with us'... I'm not saying it may not work out in the end as good television but it's not clever or good writing in the slightest (this isn't the episode writer it's probably more a function of bringing Jon back too early because they felt like they had to and now needing 4-5 episodes to keep that plot building towards the condensed battle.
2124	MrsManderly	2014-04-29	I was REALLY disappointed that
Â 
(1) Sam told Jon about Bran - in the books, Sam knowing that Jon's brother, any other Stark at this point,Â is living, but being oath-bound not to tell him, is one of the most poignant moments inÂ the entireÂ series
(2)Â  even worse, the fact that Jon was told about it was just mentioned in an off hand way - if D&D were going to reveal it, at least they should have made it a significant scene!
Â 
From that starting point, I honestly fear what comes next and that we'll have some underwhelming reunion between Jon and Bran...
Â 
This, it seems to me, is a second major botch up by D&D on in relation to Bran - the first being how they handledÂ Bran & Rickon's supposed murder in Season2/3:Â  (1)Â Cat and Rob were informed at the beginning ofÂ Season 3 not that Bran and Rickon are dead, killed by Theon, but that they are merely missing andÂ  (2)Â worse yet, Cat had already released Jaime at the end of Season 2, i.e. before she got this information.Â  To me, this both detracted from Cat's characterÂ  (in the books she only released Jaime thinking her two younger sons dead and thus desperately focusing on saving her girls) and somewhat dulled the horror of theÂ Red Weddins - in the books, the dying Cat thinks it is her last, her only remaining, son that is being killed at the Twins.
Â 
So all in all not impressed with that one....

Not sure if this got lost in all the other happenings this episode, but in Jon's conversation with Locke concerning his high-born-ness, they seemed to make a point in mentioning his mother. "My father was highborn. My mother was... not."
Just another R+L=J drop this season. What's that make, four now? They're gearing up for it.

Jep, I actually was sitting in front of the TV saying "Yeah, that's what YOU think" out loud when he said it. They are clearly setting up Jon's heritage to a bigger extent again this season, but Jon finding out before certain other things happen (like him meeting Stannis who is all about his claim) would feel very weird to me.
Â 
I somehow asumed more that we maybe get a "Bran finding out" moment earliest in the last episode of the season (might also fit to the "Children" title) that is IF it is already gonna be a early reveal this season on the show, which would be much earlier than the books already for the reader/viewer, but Jon finding out to me is still a step way beyond that.

Yeah, even though I'm tense watching these scenes, I prefer it to Bran eating acorn paste for the rest of the season. And no CH means Bran's in a bit more control of their direction/decisions.
2132	ovis alba	2014-04-29	But that's one of the reasons why I'm reluctant for wanting the Starks to meet too early: They all have aquired some very important but also very distinct knowledge:
Bran has the warging and the dreams
Sansa has the whole LF connection and playing the GoT part
Arya has the assassin/Faceless Men (FM is starting to become a confusing abbreviation  ) thing going on
Jon is aware of the White Walker danger more and more
and ok, Rickon is pretty much out of the reader's picture atm, but who knows what's going on with him
What the "Starks" in combination are still lacking is knowledge about the dragons, otherwise they have the big plots pretty much covered when they are combined.
Â 
That's why I think combining that knowledge could be eventually extremly (!) powerful and therefore combining it to early might be a huge game changer.

Why? Â How does it affect what Jon does in the future? Â It's not as if Jon can just leave Castle Black and get Bran.

I feel that the implications of him knowing Bran's fate hinder the potential of Jon's 'difficult' decisions regarding Stannis and Winterfell. Imo it will detract from the tragic, conflicted character we see in aDwD.
2136	darksellsword	2014-04-29	The real question is if Jon finds out about his parentage from Bran or the Reeds will any of you stop watching the show? I don't think it will effect the stannis Jon interactions at all , He seemed pretty determined to turn down any title Stannis offered him it would make more sense actually if he knew about his own heritage.
2137	sj4iy	2014-04-29	I feel that the implications of him knowing Bran's fate hinder the potential of Jon's 'difficult' decisions regarding Stannis and Winterfell. Imo it will detract from the tragic, conflicted character we see in aDwD.


Â 
There's nothing saying that he won't think Bran dies between now and then...but he wouldn't be more conflicted about it now then he was in the books. Â If he were legitimized, he would trump Bran, just as he would trump Sansa (which is who he says is the 'true heir' in the books). Â He would still struggle with his desire to restore Winterfell and to be a 'true son' of his father. Â That wouldn't change, no matter if he knows Bran's alive or not.
2138	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-29	Â 
Why? Â How does it affect what Jon does in the future? Â It's not as if Jon can just leave Castle Black and get Bran. Â I always thought it was implausible that Sam never told Jon, his best friend in the world, that his brother was alive...especially after all of the bad sh** that has happened to Jon.


Â Because of the post I quoted below. Also, it affects Jon's character development greatly... in my opinion, anyway. Sam knows that if Jon is tempted by his siblings' lives on the line, he might choose to desert again, or do something that puts his own life in danger, anyway. It would be impulsive to tell Jon about meeting Bran. Sam probably guesses that Jon would try to go on a "ranging" to find his brother. Also, this could have affected his dealings with Stannis, Alys, the mountain tribes, etc. I'm not saying it would have, but there is a chance, and Sam was wise to not take the chance.
Â 


But that's one of the reasons why I'm reluctant for wanting the Starks to meet too early: They all have aquired some very important but also very distinct knowledge:
Bran has the warging and the dreams
Sansa has the whole LF connection and playing the GoT part
Arya has the assassin/Faceless Men (FM is starting to become a confusing abbreviation  ) thing going on
Jon is aware of the White Walker danger more and more
and ok, Rickon is pretty much out of the reader's picture atm, but who knows what's going on with him
What the "Starks" in combination are still lacking is knowledge about the dragons, otherwise they have the big plots pretty much covered when they are combined.
Â 
That's why I think combining that knowledge could be eventually extremly (!) powerful and therefore combining it to early might be a huge game changer.


Â 
I agree. I really hope it will be a "near miss." And I think it will be.
Â 
I'm not sold that Meera and Jojen know Jon's parentage, but I absolutely hope they do not reveal it in the show before we find out in the books. If we can keep only one thing sacred, I hope it is that. I do see that they're building up to it but hope they will wait until next season ( we may have TWOW before then).

I doubt they'll give away Jon's parentage so soon, especially with the next book due sometime in the next year or so. Â But I could see how Bran and Jon could finally 'connect' so that Jon finally gains his ability to warg into Ghost, which has already happened at this point in the books.

Yes, I think this needs to happen in the show as well. But I don't have a clue how they would do this. So far, Jon hasn't had any dreams(or visions as they appear to be on the show) on tv.
Â 
Does Bran send Jon the vision before or after he arrives at his destination? I don't remember.. it's been a while since I read ADWD.
Â 
Jon's been separated from Ghost for a while. Maybe when he discovers Ghost at Craster's, he will get a vision or feeling from Bran, who is nearby. They don't have to meet to communicate - at least not Bran.
Â 
A popular theory for book six is

	Spoiler  Jon will warg into Ghost because he is dead or injured badly. Since we're already seeing book six spoilers in the show, 
 Jon needs to get to a certain point with Ghost as soon as possible if this theory should become true.

Â 
Very good points. Which Jon vision are you talking about though?
2143	SoManyVows	2014-04-29	I would like to see Bran and Jon reunite, even if it's only for a brief moment. At the absolute least, I would like them to catch a glimpse of one another before Bran escapes into the woods. The possibility certainly exists for the show to repeat the Queenscrown scenario once again, but I except that Jon openly wondering if Bran might make his way to Craster's Keep was foreshadowing their eventual encounter. Some people here are upset that Sam told Jon that Bran is alive and traveling beyond the Wall, even though Bran never made Sam promise not to tell Jon. I'm happy with it, because I believe that the writers made this change for a reason.
Â 
Obviously Bran being captured by the mutineers serves primarily as a way to inject some drama and a sense of danger into his storyline - otherwise he wouldn't have anything to do until the finale! But say all that's happens is that Jon's attack inadvertently provides the distraction that Bran and the Reeds need to escape, and the two of them never cross paths. Then, from a storytelling perspective, it actually works better if Jon doesn't know that Bran is beyond the Wall, because it plays into the tragedy of the unknown; once again, these characters were so close, and yet so far from one another.Â  Jon knowing about Bran AND unknowingly heading to the very place where his brother is being held captive creates a set of expectations that viewers, justly or not, will be expecting the show to meet. The near-miss at Queenscrown can be explained away as a coincidence, as it was in the book. This convergence is being constructed by the writers specifically for the show, and I expect that it will pay off.
Â 
I also think that the show has to be careful here, lest this particular trope becomes a running joke (which it already kind of is - the Starks haven't really been dealt a good hand by this world). Benioff and Weiss have already employed the so-close-but-yet-so-far device twice when it comes to potential Stark family reunions (the aforementioned Queenscrown, and Arya at the Red Wedding). They're also setting up yet another potential convergence with Sansa and Arya at the Vale, and we know for certain that one isn't going to come to fruition. But all of those near-misses are lifted directly from the book. This is new material, and they've set up several clues that lead me to believe that this particular encounter is going to play out differently.
Â 
Locke is the key to this, I think. He's an original character for the show, and he's currently been tasked by Roose Bolton to find the Stark boys and kill them. Well, this is his chance! He knows that Bran is beyond the Wall because he overheard Jon's conversation with Sam - it's the reason that he volunteered to go with Jon in the first place. Even if Jon doesn't encounter Bran, Locke has to, because otherwise what was the purpose of sending him to the Wall? Rickon isn't there, and Jon is a secondary priority for the Boltons because he isn't considered legitimate. IsÂ  the show just going to discard the entire sense of menace that they've cultivated around Locke, have him forget his original mission and decide to join the Night's Watch for real? That seems highly unlikely.
Â 
If Locke discovers that Bran is a captive at Craster's Keep during the attack, as seems likely, then he will have to make his move right then and there, because he might never get another chance to kill the boy. Then he'll have to be dealt with, and who is going to kill him? Meera? Summer? Bran, by warging into Hodor? Why not Jon? He'll be initially preoccupied with leading the attack, but if and when he realizes Locke's true purpose, then I have to assume that he'll drop everything else to save his brother. So during the chaos of the battle, Locke finds Bran. He's about to kill him when Jon intervenes. The two duel, and Jon kills Locke. He then shares a moment with his brother.
Â 
I think that this could actually turn out to be a very sweet and effective scene. Jon talks to Bran after saving him, and begs him to return with him to the relative safety of the Wall so that Jon can protect him. He wasn't able to help Ned or Robb, but he can help Bran, and that's important. Bran can explain the necessity of his journey, and in doing so remind Jon of the duty that he has to uphold - the new set of brothers that he has to protect. Eventually, Jon reluctantly allows Bran to go on, and the two of them reaffirm their brotherly love for one another and their hopes that the Stark family will be whole again one day. Things are pretty much pitch black right now, but this would offer up just a glimmer of hope, a candle in the darkness.
Â 
Such a scene would provide a nice sense of closure as the characters return to their own separate storylines. I hope that we get to see it.

2144	Ingelheim	2014-04-29	No. It's just a change too big.
2145	Ruin	2014-04-29	No...it would be better if they didn't meet.Â  Still hoping Coldhands will show in some capacity.
2146	Fuse Prime	2014-04-29	I agree with a previous poster that said Bran and Co. will escape during the chaos of the NW's attack. Â If Bran and Jon meet, I think it'll cheapen the reunion the Starks will have in ADoS. Â
2147	Night'sQueen	2014-04-29	I agree but I also think that seems kind of pointless considering Queenscrow was less than 10 episodes ago..the whole converging of plotlines with Locke thrown in (that part I like at least the general idea of it) baffled me..
Â 
-Mutineers at Craster's Keep is fine - Even Karl painted up for someone you want to hate on TV is fine for a short-term plot
Â 
But jumping from one episode of 'We have to capture or kill them for strategic reasons' to 'Where could Bran have gone?' 'Wildling villages are empty maybe he went to Crasters' and 'Let's take this new guy with us'... I'm not saying it may not work out in the end as good television but it's not clever or good writing in the slightest (this isn't the episode writer it's probably more a function of bringing Jon back too early because they felt like they had to and now needing 4-5 episodes to keep that plot building towards the condensed battle.

I agree. The whole thing seems overly contrived and yet lazy. And sensationalized since apparently Bran's journey was too boring for TV. (Full disclosure: Bran is my favorite character in the books and his story is the one I find most fascinating so I catch myself grinding my teeth Stannis style when the show messes with him.) So it seems like they decided to have Bran & Co get kidnapped by the cartoonish mutineers and throw a bit of rape in as a backdrop to make his journey more suspenseful and exciting.  Many of my issues with that part of the episode are detailed in the nitpicking thread -- direwolves captured and caged as easily as common dogs, Locke happening to overhear Jon and Sam seemed especially stagey.
Changes for the sake of adapting this to screen are necessary, but when they are poorly written, don't advance the plot, rush the plot too much or lack continuity with previous episodes it's jarring and the whole suspension of disbelief collapses.

Â 
I'm not sure how this would happen anymore, though. While Jon & Brothers fight the Craster Crew, would CH run in and free Bran's lot? Seems like the entire point of Jon being the one to take care of the mutineers is to tie up that loose end without CH.
2149	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-29	Â 
Very good points. Which Jon vision are you talking about though?


I don't have my books ATM, so I cannot give you a chapter off the top of my head... it is talked about in this thread, however.
Â 
Gotta go to work for now!
2150	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-29	My bet is that it is going to be a near miss. Bran and co will escape before they can meet with Jon (or Jojen will prevent it) but Jon will be lead to believe that they were murdered by the mutineers, who will be subsequently killed by the NW men. Jon will be reunited with Ghost and so we will be back on track with the book story.Â 
Â 
In a way it is better than in the books. I always found the fact that Sam didn't tell Jon about Bran going beyond the Wall stupid and frustrating.Â 
Â 
Heartwarming reunion would be fantastic but since I know that it did not really happen, I wouldn't be able to enjoy it.Â
2151	Ironclaw	2014-04-29	IMO and I repeat IMO I do not want there to be a BJ rendezvous (lol) in the near future. there is good chance chance but little need for Bran's company to  meet with Jon for as many have stated for plot reasons. The show has obviously deviated from the books giving away unconfirmed theories about the novels (LF and QoT involvement in the death of KJ) and glimpses towards things we have yet to see in the novels (The reveal of the Other's stronghold of you wanna call it that and a reveal of what is really done with Craster's boys). Then there's the deviations from the novels with character story lines. There's so many examples I don't even want to start on those examples. However all these minor plot changes have not so far changed the fabric of the story SO FAR. However the Sandor/Arya plot change irked me for reasons involving their character relationship however that's not what we are here to discuss. My reason for not wanting and not believing that Bran company and Jon will meet is simple. It will significantly shape how the plot of the story goes. There is a reason that none of the Starks have met. It drives the plot of other characters significantly throughout the rest of the novel and will change the course of how essential plots unfold. The biggest book betrayal the show has done so far IMO is of Sam telling Jon of his Bran encounter. Jon knows the dangers beyond the wall and has love for Bran. Book Jon would have rode north all day to rescue Bran because A. He can ride beyond north of the wall and would not let Bran go by himself, thus forever changing Jon's destiny as LC. But if you look at Jon and Bran Company meeting it will utterly destroy the book plot and kill a major burning question for all the readers. What is Jon's true parentage? I think this setup is an obvious ploy to get asoiaf readers to be put on the edge of their seats. It's the question most readers have and to keep us interested you need to have us fearful/begging of the possibility of that reveal and how it will shape the show. Obviously DB and DW know Jon's true parentage. Most of us believe the R + L= J. For good reason. But Jon running into the Reeds and Bran will change how Jon transforms and betray who his character is if he lets them ride north without him and the knowledge they may or may not have about his parentage would be given away by a run in. That would ruin something GRRM would wanna reveal himself and not be casually dropped into a midseason episode too early on in the progression of the story. It really should be nothing more than a tease. If it leads to more than that it will severely ruin the integrity of the story the novels tell as a whole. They may switch things up in the show but I don't believe they will diverge onto a different road completely.

...not sure how that statement applies to this particular scenario at all. Â It's neither rushing nor stopping the plot, and it has a lot of continuity and actually makes sense that it could happen. Â In fact, it's probably the most exciting thing to happen, especially for the book readers who don't know what's coming next. Â Jon's my favorite character in the books, and I like that they've been changing his story because now I get to see something completely unexpected and badass.

I have to agree w/the previous poster that it is super contrived and lazy that Meera, who is supposed to be a fantastic huntress and Summer are both completely oblivious to the fact that they are within ear shot of Craster's Keep...no idea...until they hear a baby crying...
2154	MrsManderly	2014-04-29	Thinking about it further, theÂ point made by a poster above (sorry, forget who it was!) may turn out to be the redeeming virtue of this storyline - namely warging.
Â 
If Jon is indeed to warg Ghost post-stabbing, it may make sense for him and Bran to have an encounter at Crasters where Jon sees Bran warg Summer and perhaps for the first time wargs Ghost himself... If I am not mistaken, so far the show hasn't shown us any warging tendencies in Jon, of the kind we get from his (and, say, Arya's) dreams in the book.Â  If that's correct, then maybe Bran and Jon crossing paths at Crasters makes some sense.Â  (Although, arguably, the same plot development could have been achieved through their near-meeting at Queenscrown.)
2155	Little and Less	2014-04-29	Actually I got the feeling that D & D want to have Bran be theÂ Hero....Â Capturing Bran was a way to show his true warging abilities to the audience...which will be kick ass and revive Bran's stagnating story line.Â 
Â 
Karl and the traitors will push Bran too far...probably by threatening to kill theÂ Reeds...and he will either warg Hodor and Hodor will escape and let out Summer and GhostÂ (who I think will be our only reuniting of the Starks via their direwolves)...I see the direwolves laying waste to Crasters Keep (oh Rast, you should have made nice with Ghost when you had the chance)Â and by the time Jon and Co. reach the Keep all the traitors will be dead (not sure about Crasters wives)....and Bran and the Reeds will have fled....
Â 
I think a Locke assisination attempt will be thwarted because of the carnage....and maybe the sight of Ghost/Bran missingÂ will have Locke rethinking his plan.Â  I welcome the addition of Locke and whether Jon will see through him at some point.
Â 
This of course is how I would write it, oh dare to dream...

Â 
No more contrived than a dead good guy coming to lead them to the Children of the Forest and killing the mutineers along the way...and then nothing else. Â To me it's just as contrived to find ways to keep the siblings separated each time they come close to finding one another.

Because Rickon and Osha had left by the time Samwell and Gilly found them.
2160	Trillian	2014-04-29	I do think it will be a "near miss" too (and in a way I hope so).
I don't mind the change of the story though. Bran's journey it's fairly "static" in the book, meaning that's more about an inner journey that a physical one, and since the depth of it couldn't be matched on tv for obvious reasons, the choice was probably between cutting the character or making him "do something". Obviously I prefer his book journey, but I do understand the HBO logic. As other people said, the only disappointment for me was the capture of the direwolves, which makes them look no more special than, like, a common German Sheperd or something. Besides that, I am open to the show developments and I think it's too early for judging the changes properly.
2161	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-29	Â 
Because Rickon and Osha had left by the time Samwell and Gilly found them.


Â 
I know, but wouldn't Jon have thought it odd that Rickon and Bran had been seperated? Because if he knows that Bran is still alive, then surely he must realise that Rickon should be alive as well. and seeing as Sam probably didn't mention Rickon, that should have made him wonder about Rickon's whereabouts ... Then again, the series has a tendency to forget about Rickon's existence, so I'll try not be bothered by it.
2162	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-29	Â 
Either way, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be very disappointed if the whole point in Bran being captured was just to tease the audience with another near miss.


Â 
This is the only strong feeling I have one way or the other. Â I don't need their characters to meet, but to have things again line up perfectly to prevent the occurrence to which things seem to be heading naturally would be contrivance run amok.
Â 
D&D's version of ASOIAF is starting to feel like what I imagine happens when you read a Dickens novel backwards...

2166	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	What does "watching the show" have to do with it at all?
I think it would change a whole lot of Jon's motivation and the way especially he himself sees him as a character if he finds out who he really is before he "dies" and this would have a huge impact on the story as a whole to me. But do I have to stop watching the show, when it becomes diffrent from the books? I would probably be even more interested watching if i knew the show had no clue how the books ended to see how different two endings of the same initial story can be 


Â 
How about we actually wait and find out how Jon comes through the assassination attempt before we descibe it as dying.Â  For all we know, Jon may just use the presence of Ghost to help him heal, as Bran seemed to do after the fall.Â

2167	King Theon	2014-04-29	I hope they don't meet. I read a post on one of these threads the other day which hypothesised that Bran would warg Hodor and escape that way. Going further than that, though, I think Karl will be cruel (because that's just classic Karl) and tell Jon they killed his brother and burnt their bodies or something, which will make Jon execute him. Locke being in earshot would prevent him chasing them and set him up for the Bowen Marsh role next season.
Â 
I'm prepared for all of this to be wrong, but throwing it out there regardless! If they do meet, it will suck. Sam telling Jon makes more sense than how the book did it (even if them not putting in that scene in the show was stupid), but then him thinking Bran's dead returns to the status quo and means it doesn't mess with Stannis' offer and stuff.

I do like that scenario.Â  All of it.Â 


Â 
Can he just warg into Karl and have him plunge a knife in his own belly?
2170	Danger Zone	2014-04-29	^^ Seriously this. With no Coldhands they should just make Bran powerful enough to get himself to Bloodraven. Plus it would be a great and terrifying scene. Instead I fear they will have Jon save the day and have Bran be useless which makes no Coldhands even more stupid than it already is.
2171	CandleWisps	2014-04-29	If it doesn't end up being a near miss I will be suprised as hell. And in all honesty, I don't want Bran and Jon to meet up. The Starks are practically there to be separated from each other and miserable, so even having some form of quick meeting would ruin that pillar in a sense. Even if they did meet, they would have to separate of their own free will and that would take up more time and be a morally harder chioce to come to grips with. During Sam and Jon's library scene, Jon sounded as if he was already sort of coming to terms that there was nothing he could do, other than trust Bran that he knew what he was doing.
Â 
And I agree with the poster (sorry, can't remember who  ) who mentioned Rickon. Jon surely would have been thinking about what happened to his youngest sibling, but as you said the show pretty much ignores his existence :/
Â 
As for the Reeds, I don't think their secret-knowledge-bomb will be a problem since I don't think theyll meet up anyways. But it is still interesting and I didn't even think of that till it was mentioned. And it does make me curious how they are going to slowly ween that into the show, given that readers know R+L=J based mostly on visions, dreams, and Ned's accounts of the Rebellion.

2172	Danger Zone	2014-04-29	So hope they don't meet. Even better if the mutineers tell Jon they killed Bran.

2174	ovis alba	2014-04-30	Â 
How about we actually wait and find out how Jon comes through the assassination attempt before we descibe it as dying.Â  For all we know, Jon may just use the presence of Ghost to help him heal, as Bran seemed to do after the fall.Â 
Why do you think I wrote "dies" and not just dies?
2175	Waylin Stark	2014-04-30	I don't want them to reunite so soon.
And I don't think they will either.
Â 
It'll most probably be a very near miss.
Like Bran will do some warging and save they'll save themselves just as the Watch are attacking. The mutineers will be distracted and Bran and Co. will get away.
Heck, I don't even think Karl will get a chance to tell Jon what happened.
And midst all this chaos, Locke will try to assassinate Jon but it'll fail. So he'll stick around a while longer.
Â 
And I doubt we'll see Coldhands.Â

Â 
Nope. Karl's death certificate will likely be signed by Jon. I can't wait!
2178	rmholt	2014-04-30	Why do people think that Jon will learn something life altering from the Reeds?

Because Howland Reed knows what happened at the Tower of Joy and unlike Ned he talks to his kids. In fact he sent them to Bran.
2179	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-30	Because Howland Reed knows what happened at the Tower of Joy and unlike Ned he talks to his kids. In fact he sent them to Bran.


Show!Jojen tells Bran that his father has never talked about Robert's Rebellion. I think the likelihood that Jojen will spill the beans about R+L=J or that he will even talk to Jon in the upcoming episode are extremely low.
2180	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-30	Show!Jojen tells Bran that his father has never talked about Robert's Rebellion. I think the likelihood that Jojen will spill the beans about R+L=J or that he will even talk to Jon in the upcoming episode are extremely low.

LOL, that's what I was about to point out.Â  Jojen does say that his dreams have shown him Robert's Rebellion, among other things.Â
2181	Uldra I	2014-04-30	D&D have so much material to cover in the remaining seasons.Â  Until now they've combined secondary characters and subplots in order to skip time consumingÂ or in some cases more expensive scenes.Â  So far, these changes have been relatively minor IMO and have been cleverly done so as not to disrupt the storyline in the books too much.Â  In E04 there were a couple of reveals that will end some endless debate on the forums as well.Â  LF and Lady Olenna working together to poison Joffrey, and what happened to Craster's sons after the WW's took them.Â  Yay for those reveals!
Â 
In E04 they departed from the stories in the books altogether by having Sam tell Jon about Bran, and by having Bran & co captured at Craster's Keep, and by sending Jon out to Craster's.Â  I'm not upset by this, but more disturbed and curious. It still doesn't make sense to me.Â  Obviously, it is some type of device for moving the plot along, tying up loose ends, etc... butÂ why do something that is so completely divorced from the books?Â  Guess we'll have to wait an episode or two to find out.Â  It really makes me uncomfortable about whether the remaining seasons will stay true to GRRM's story.Â  If they create a completely different path, even if the arrive at the same conclusion, then it is not the same story.
Â 
A couple thoughts about what D&D may use this scene to accomplish that haven't been mentioned yet:
-Locke could be eliminated in battle at the Keep.Â  Vargo Hoat died long ago in the books.
-The water Rast poured on the ground in front of Ghost's cage froze way too quickly which scared Rast enough that he ran off.Â  This must mean WW's are nearby.
Â 
One wild speculation on how Bran & Co could escape that I haven't heard yet... One of Karl's rapers decides he wants Meera, since they seem to think it is ok to just rape everyone.Â  That could cause all kinds of ruckuss.Â  Karl may say " NO" causing fightingÂ amongst the mutineers.Â  Meera could pull a ninja on the raper and create a huge scene. Either of these scenarios might be sufficient for Bran or Jojen to free Hodor and the direwolves.Â  Another possibility, Bran & co. would become terribly upset by Meera being threatened that it rouses them to taking some kind ofÂ action.Â 
Â 
Surely,Â D&D can't be planning a reunion between Bran & Jon.Â  If they did, they'd really have to get creative to explain how Jon let Bran continue his journey.Â  Also, the idea that Jojen tells Jon his parentage seems way too early in the show story.Â  If you assume GRRM has held off from giving us that info for aÂ reason, then D&D probably won't hurry that reveal this early in the story.
Â 
The whole thing baffles me, but I do trust D&D so far.Â Â  They have to have some good reasons other than filler.Â  They have way too much story to tell to waste precious airÂ time on "filler".

I think it will be a near miss. Bran will Warg Hodor to free the wolves or The mutineers will somehow free the wolves in an effort to use them for amusement (maybe try feeding Meera to them) The kids will get loose just as the mutineers are then descended on by Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s crew. I think the kids and Hodor keep fleeing Northâ<U+0080>¦.but I think Locke breaks off and tracks themâ<U+0080>¦this will lend a little danger to the trip North and make it more interesting. I even had a crackpot theory that Locke dies in the process or is killed by others and then becomes the Wrightâ<U+0080>¦Coldhands. He is dressed as a Nightswatch brother. It would help explain his purpose and help condense a few minor characters.
2183	SMF269	2014-04-30	I just want Bran to do something, anything really.
2184	Justin Danford	2014-04-30	Wait wait hold the fuck up! No CH? I seriously was hoping to see him. If they are omitting him then I see why they are writing Jon to kill them all. But also CH, is the one who helps Bran to his destination, right? Damn,
Clearly Jon murders the mutineers, but is stabbed in the back by Locke who tries to end the Stark line. Locke goes to kill Bran, but Jon - having warged Ghost just before he died - wargs back into his corpse and takes out Locke before he can hurt Bran. Jon then learns of Bran's quest and decides to escort him to find the 3ER. Bran is scared at first, seeing his dead brother, undead...but unJon extends his hand and Bran takes it (it's very cold).
Of course, this is nonesense, but seeing as D&D are just making stuff up now, why not!

I don't think they can have Jon and Bran meet. Hey, by the way, I can warg into my wolf, you should try it too, and I have prophetic dreams and I'm heading to the far North to fulfill my destiny that I see when I touch the weirwood trees....that is WAY too much information for Jon to have going forward.


I wonder if Jon will warg into Ghost without meaning to when he is suddenly in the presence of Ghost after such a long separation, and through Ghost's eyes he'll see Summer.Â  I thought that Bran should have been able to restablish a connection with Summer after the intial shock of Summer falling through the trap severed their connection, but that's just me.
Â 
I hope they don't meet. I read a post on one of these threads the other day which hypothesised that Bran would warg Hodor and escape that way. Going further than that, though, I think Karl will be cruel (because that's just classic Karl) and tell Jon they killed his brother and burnt their bodies or something, which will make Jon execute him. Locke being in earshot would prevent him chasing them and set him up for the Bowen Marsh role next season.
Â 
I'm prepared for all of this to be wrong, but throwing it out there regardless! If they do meet, it will suck. Sam telling Jon makes more sense than how the book did it (even if them not putting in that scene in the show was stupid), but then him thinking Bran's dead returns to the status quo and means it doesn't mess with Stannis' offer and stuff.


I suspect that Ghost will not interact well with Locke (either at CK or CB), and his suspicious/wary treatment of Locke will key Jon into realizing that something is off about this newest recruit.

Or perhaps the WW were nearby only long enough to take Craster's son off to the Land of Always Winter.
2186	dbunting	2014-04-30	As to the post above from Doloros, IMO the ice froze because that wight came and took the baby.I am about done with near miss meetings so I don't want another. Brans journey at this point in the books is boring as hell so this just keeps him relevent. Him and Jon meeting can be done well and everything has worked so far, so why lose faith now? I never understood why Sam wouldn't have told Jon about Bran anyway.As for "the show never mentioning Rickon"....the books didn't either! You really didn't see anything from him once they split until Davos was at White Harbor. There was nothing at all, same as the tv series.
2187	Panther2000	2014-04-30	I don't see them meeting up at all.Â Â Â  I think that they will have a Hit & Miss once again.Â Â  With all the mess going on I think that Hordor will break loose grab Bran & High tail it out of there. I do think that Both Summer & Ghost will have a Reunion or sorts & help TKW take out the traitors.Â  Then of course summer will follow Bran ( unless this is where summer gets injured) he did after all fall in that Dead Fall.Â  I don't see bran & jon meeting up.Â  Jon will never allow Bran to go on north & Jon will not leave TKW.Â Â  I do love that fact that once again so close, so far.
2188	Panther2000	2014-04-30	Now, I do think they still will meet CH & I also think that they will still meet the man in the Cave( I am still trying to figure that 1 out.Â  Who the Hell was that Masked man ).Â Â Â  They can't take out bran & Co. getting attacked by TO.Â  That was a great action part, just like Dawn of The Dead, rising out of the ground.Â Â Â Â  They left out CH with Sam & Gilly, I think for the better part of being with & Saving Bran
2189	rmholt	2014-04-30	Show!Jojen tells Bran that his father has never talked about Robert's Rebellion. I think the likelihood that Jojen will spill the beans about R+L=J or that he will even talk to Jon in the upcoming episode are extremely low.

Ok I forgot that. To be honest I haven't even noticed people thinking Jojen will have any effect on Jon's life in the show.
I can't figure out the fixation with Coldhands.

Â 
I agree the likelihood is extremely low. Even if ShowJojen knows the truth, which I think he does simply through his own visions, I doubt he would tell Jon. R+L=J seems to be something Jojen would keep heavily under wraps until it was the right time or a need arose
2191	Big Daddy	2014-04-30	I wonder if they had Sam tell Jon about Bran being alive (and by default, Rickon too) for more than one reason?
Â 
Chiefly, I think it was just awkward and unbelievable that Sam didn't tell Jon in the book. It irritates me to no end every time I read that and it pulls me out of the book.Â 
Â 
Secondly, I wonder if they have Same leaving the Wall with Aemon later than the book, if at all? If D&D are privy to information that Sam's journey isn't all that vital, they may cut it altogether. Giving Sam his own mission is an entirely new location, sets and cast that would need to be put together. I can see the incentive to do away with it and keep Sam around for Jon to interact with.
Â 
And it might explain why Sam out of the blue put Gilly in Moletown.
Â 
Finally, I'm going with "near miss" too. It's such a common theme in the book series.

I'm gonna hold my breath that they dont go this route. It makes sense that they would to save time and budget, and since it seems they've also also completely foregone Mance's baby storyline reducing the need to get the hell out of dodge. But then what are we gonna do with Maester Aemon? It's been pretty well established by Melissandre the power King's blood has, so they can't just ignore his presence. If they plan to kill him for Stannis' benefit I'll riot
Â 
Also, what about the potential storyline Sam serves by arriving in Oldtown? Alleras/Sarella and the Old Maesters plot involving Dany the dragons, etc.
Â 
It makes sense that they would cut all this out, and I guess they could merge someone elses storyline to fit into Oldtown, I'm just gonna hold my breath for now and pray that Maeser Aemon gets to pass away peacefully in his sleep
2193	Impish	2014-04-30	I'm also going to completely ignore how the show's meanderings nullify the possibility of Jon being legitimized as a Stark the way Robb or Stannis intended. Â  Â

If Rhaegar and Lyanna eloped, Jon is already a legitimate son of both houses... we just need a key witness (paging Mr. Reed?) to come forward.
2194	direwoofwoof	2014-04-30	As much as I want Jon and Bran to reconnect in person on the show, it did not happen in the book that way and I don't see it happening on HBO.  I like the theory about them meeting while warging. 
Jojen looked so sick in the last episode.  I think he is worried about Bran's journey and nothing else, certainly not Jon's heritage.

Well, IIRC Robb's will was sent to Howland Reed, and he could have some major surprises in store for the people who delivered the will: "Jon's not just the King in the North; that boy is heir to ALL of Westeros!" Can I get my copy of The Winds of Winter now please?!

2202	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-01	i dont bran would run away during the battle. at least he would stay near by to see the aftermath. wouldnt he think that jon might be comming to save him (not to save him, but to kill the others).
i would be totally fine with them meeting each other if there is a good enough reason for bran continuing north. i was skeptical about jon going on him mission, but he had a dood reason, so i was cool with it. i hope they can repeat that because i would like to see a reunion
2203	Tytus	2014-05-01	Bran can speak through Hodor's mouth when he's warging him right? He should be able to if he can control the rest of his body. I want to see Jon and Bran to meet up except Bran is in Hodor
2204	One was naked.	2014-05-01	I'm also thinking Bran's warging ability gets them out of Craster's before Jon arrives and will be used to show that Bran's power is growing. Â How far fetched would it be for Bran to warg somebody a bit more sentient, say, like Rast?
Â 
We have both of his established warging targets out of commission, with Summer in a pit and Hodor chained and injured. Â Ghost's in a cage too, so not an option. Â We have Karl (as tedious as his speech was, it probably wasn't pointless) declaring himself "a legend" who could take any knight in a fight and Rast, when challenged by Karl admitting that he "wouldn't stand a chance." Â Rast is being bullied- prime set up for him to stand up to Karl, even though he lacks the confidence (says to Hodor, "if I had your size, I'd be king of the fooking world.")Â We have Rast demonstrating his marginal intelligence (susceptible to being warged, like Hodor) by falling over and failing to feed Ghost, despite Ghost being in a cage. Â 
Â 
My money is on Bran warging Rast and killing Karl in a swordfight. Â In the Chaos, Craster's wives have their own backstabbing mutiny (more satisfying revenge) against the raper mutineers, and Bran et al. escape in the commotion, freeing Hodor, Summer, and Ghost on their way out. Â All but Ghost head north. Ghost reunites with Jon who then arrives at the now free house of Craster, whose wives want little to do with more Night's Watch, other than to tell them their brothers are already dead as a warning.

2205	Ä<U+0080>bra	2014-05-01	I hope that they will not meet. There may be some clues for one or the other, but actual meeting. It is an adaptation so there may be changes, it doesn't bother me, but not a change of this type.


There may be a rebellion of women of Craster, but I think that it will happen at the time or Jon and his brothers arrive. In the trailer we see Jon fighting with one of the men of Karl. After they can develop a little Bran because once the season 4 complete, I feel that writers should fill a minimum history to wait the spectators. Unless the volume 6 was released before the season 5 (or during) and it expands the story of Bran. I wonder how they will present us the passage at Craster.

I can't see Bran ever warging Ghost, let alone warging Ghost before Show!Jon does. I also can't see Bran warging a human being other than Hodor, not just because warging another human being is wrong, but because I suspect that the effects of warging go both ways; ie. the warg and the wargee (if you will) may both experience changes.Â  I don't think a sweet soul like Bran would want to warg into a nasty piece of work like Rast (or Karl!) anyway.Â  He might contract the equivalent of a warging STD!

2209	One was naked.	2014-05-01	I can't see Bran ever warging Ghost, let alone warging Ghost before Show!Jon does. I also can't see Bran warging a human being other than Hodor, not just because warging another human being is wrong, but because I suspect that the effects of warging go both ways; ie. the warg and the wargee (if you will) may both experience changes.Â  I don't think a sweet soul like Bran would want to warg into a nasty piece of work like Rast (or Karl!) anyway.Â  He might contract the equivalent of a warging STD! 

Hey, desperate times call for desperate measures. And besides, how is Bran supposed to warg a dragon if he doesn't move on from Hodor and weirwoods?
2210	Dany's Silver	2014-05-01	Hey, desperate times call for desperate measures. And besides, how is Bran supposed to warg a dragon if he doesn't move on from Hodor and weirwoods?


I suspect that Bloodraven will provide Bran with plenty of training before (or if) that happens.Â  That being said, while I adore Bran, but I am not certain whether he'll be a part of the three-headed dragon (I'm leaning towards Jon-Dany-Tyrion, myself).Â  I think Melisandre will mistake Bran for an antagonist (as she already has in her visions) and that those two will have more to do with each other during TWOW, rather than Bran warging a dragon. That's just the way I see things playing out, but I would love to be proven wrong, so c'mon GRRM - we'd all like our copies of TWOW ASAP.
2211	Martini Sigil	2014-05-01	I like this change... mainly because Bran's story is just warging and walking... its important, but it would be filming the same scene over and over again...Â
2212	CandleWisps	2014-05-01	Â 
My money is on Bran warging Rast and killing Karl in a swordfight. Â In the Chaos, Craster's wives have their own backstabbing mutiny (more satisfying revenge) against the raper mutineers, and Bran et al. escape in the commotion, freeing Hodor, Summer, and Ghost on their way out. Â All but Ghost head north. Ghost reunites with Jon who then arrives at the now free house of Craster, whose wives want little to do with more Night's Watch, other than to tell them their brothers are already dead as a warning. Â Mance's army is then sighted, causing them to make tracks back to the wall.


Â 
The only problem I see with this is that we see Jon and Co. fighting against the mutineers in the "First of His Name" promo. Would love for some Craster's wives revenge though

Maybe, unsullied Mom would enjoy it all more if she could read the books?
2215	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-01	I wouldn't like it (not in Craster's keep at this point in the show, at any rate) and I don't think it's gonna happen.
Â 
I think what will happen is exactly as in TLotR, when Aragorn and co. were coming to Merry and Pippin's rescue in the 2 Towers.

Bran and co. will take advantage of the commotion created by Jon's arrival and will slip away from Craster's Keep while the battle's raging on (after freeing Hodor and being reunited with Summer, of course).

2217	Talking Hodor	2014-05-02	I predict Jon WILL meet up with Bran - he already knows about him heading North, which is a huge deviation from the book.Â  Otherwise, Bran's only other way to get out of this mess is to warg into Hodor and go to town Conan-the-Barbarian-style on the Night's Rapists.Â  Since Hodor was getting skewered when last we saw him, even if Bran were to warg him, he's probably in no condition to fight.
Â 
I could see Jon replacing Coldhands by saving his brother and getting him to the three-eyed raven safe and sound, and I predict that Jojen will tell Jon who his parents are. Or perhaps Coldhands will actually make an appearance, save Bran, and destroy the rapists, at which point Jon won't meet them and never find out that Khal Drogo is his nuncle by marriage.
Â 
No matter what happens, if the show kills off Hodor, I'm going to lose my shit, along with about 99 million other fans.
2218	Talking Hodor	2014-05-02	With that being said, it would still be utterly badass if Bran convinces the rapists to leave Hodor alone and let him take care of their horses, then wargs into him at night and goes all Rambo on the rapists by freeing the direwolves.Â  Then he'll declare his Bran's love for Meera, and the poor actor playing Hodor will actually have to memorize some lines.
Â 
Hodor the Barbarian, raper of rapists and breaker of direwolf chains.
2219	Treekid	2014-05-02	I think the meet up between Bran and Jon will never happen.
Â 
I imagine Bran will warg into Hodor or his wolf and manage a timely escape. Or Coldhand will show up and save the day just before Jon arrives only to find almost everyone's dead or dying. I'd like to see Hodor wield a sword ans take out Rast for example.
Â 
I don't see Jon and Bran meeting up because Jon wouldn't let Bran loose north of the wall for the same reason He came to bring back the mutineers: Manse must not know of the NW actual strength. And to let Bran go would mean he accepts losing him to the enemy.
Â 
I find myself thinking as I do when I watch a show I know nothing about what's next. I like that. Everything's possible.
2220	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-05-02	I really don't know why people keep advancing the possibility that Jon will get there and find all the mutineers dead when we see him fighting people in the trailers. Do you really think they sent Jon up there with a sword just not to use it? Come on now!
2221	daedalus ennui	2014-05-02	Please let it be Coldhands. Coldhands is one of my favourite parts of Bran's story; I would be sad if they skip him altogether.
As for Jon even knowing about Bran's existence, I was rather upset to find that Sam told him.
Isn't it a big deal in the novels that Sam keeps his promise to Bran and doesn't even tell Jon of his whereabouts or existence?

Â 
Sam never made that promise to Bran in the show. Â In the books, the only thing that really makes him keep his promise is Coldhands' threat to him if he breaks it. Â Since there isn't any Coldhands nor any promise to anyone, it only makes sense that Sam tells Jon.

Â 
Whoops sorry- hadn't watched the trailer, just saw it. Â Looks like Jon and Rast are locking swords, Jojen's tied up with rope, and Hodor is in chains, but getting pumped to do something. Â Okay, revised prediction:
Â 
Jon and company provide the distraction for Bran to warg Hodor to do something more than just shut up and go to sleep like he did in the tower at Queenscrown. Â This time, he has Hodor break his chains (more plausible/fun than breaking rope) and untie them, maybe carry Bran out of Crasters/stomp some minor mutineer on the way to an exit. Â The shot of Bran crawling in the promo is probably him looking back and seeing Jon fighting as they go.
Â 
Jon and Co. will win the fight; Locke will learn that it was Bran of Winterfell who escaped the mutineers, deserting the NW to go in pursuit while Jon and the rest head back to the wall- with Ghost.

I haven't seen the trailer and even if I would think it odd that Jon had not much fighting to do I could understand it.

My point was just that by the time he gets there, bran will be gone. In fact I believe there will be some sword fights but they will not be to save Bran. But then again this is only what I think.

I think you're right there. Bran will be gone by the time Jon arrives.
2226	SeventySeven	2014-05-02	Mmmh, I don't know. I can't really think about it, because I'm fairly sure they'll tease the audience with it, but it ultimately won't happen. It would be too big a change, and both characters still need to do their book arcs, so I don't see it.
Â 
Would I want it? Probably not, because I think it would change the story too much.
2227	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-02	If Bran can escape before Jon and his band of merry Night's Watch show up then he MUST have outside help. Hodor has just had a spear through his calf. He shouldn't be walking anywhere. Either Bran must be rescued by someone else or he's going to meet Jon.
Â 
Unless they strap him to a dire wolf or something even then they'll be proceeding without Hodor. It will be highly unbelievable that Hodor will be fit for hiking through the snow carrying a teenage boy.

Â 
Just a thought but its not out of the realm of possibility that they steal a horse during their escape. Even if they do though, they'll still be moving fairly slow with Hodors injury, which is possibly where Jon and Co. come in, to distract the mutineers from going after Bran and Co.
Â 
My concern with this whole deal isn't Jon and Bran meeting, which I think won't happen, but what Locke is going to do. I think somehow the Nights Watch find out that Bran was there, and in the confusion/aftermath of battle, Locke sneaks away to track Bran and finish him off. That might provide something more substantial than Bran and Co. wandering for awhile before they reach Bloodraven and the CotF
2229	ViennaGirl	2014-05-02	I'd love to see them get together too, although it's so non-book. But I'd love it. I can see if happening this way - things are so bad in the Craster's battle that when Jon sees Bran, he tells him to RUN as fast as he can - just a 2 second conversation of "omg it's you, you have to get out of here now!" and they separate. It would have to be dire for Jon to do that - Jon would have to think that all of the good guys were going to be killed. But I can see it.

Hmm . . . could Locke's fate be wandering the woods beyond the Wall as a Wight, as soon as he crosses paths with the Others?

Because there's no way he's avoiding them if he does come after Bran, given where that particular storyline's headed.

Me too. Can you imagine if they went back to the Prologue's opening sequence as seen in the books, with Locke in Ser Waymar's shoes? Challenged to hand-to-hand combat by an Other, utterly and viciously defeated whilst surrounded by Others, only to rise again as a Wight?

I was thinking that something similar, but not identical, might actually happen. Cuz if Locke does end up tracking Bran and Co., I'm not sure how they would fight him off. From the scene at Castle Black, and dealing with Locke and general, he is definitely intelligent and a skilled swordsmen who is quick on his feet. If Bran were to warg Hodor to fight him off, I'm not sure he would win, given that Locke superiority and experience in combat. Meera could try and take him, but again I think Locke would come out on top. Summer could take him, but in the show Summer might be injured as Bran says that "he's hurt" after getting caught in the trap.
Â 
So my train of thought was that Locke doesn't catch up till later, possibly the finale. Bran and Co. could be close to BR's cave when Locke catches up and makes his move. Bran wargs Hodor, Meera joins him to take Locke on, but ultimately Locke overcomes them. Then their asses get saved by the arrival of wights/maybe some Others in the show, which distracts Locke and makes him prioritize which enemy is more dangerous. Locke turns to fight the ice people, unwittingly buying time for Bran and Co. to make a run for it. The wights/Others surround him and overcome Locke, he dies, then is possibly wightified

2243	Bran's Legs	2014-05-02	Â 
A lot of this is course correction...without CH, someone has to kill the mutineers. This also sets up Jon being a commander better than him moping in an ice cell, so I don't mind it that much. Interesting about Bran maybe faking his own death (or Jon assuming he dies). That could help sew these plot holes closed.Â 
Â 
Truthfully everything about this plot is stressing me out; this is why I read the books! I'm really worried about Meera being surrounded by Rapey McRapers, Locke's function is confusing me, and then there's the whole Ghost is in a cage and Summer is in a pit. The Reeds likely carrying the R+L=J bomb is just another element that's concerning me. Not that I don't want to know, but for Jon to knowÂ before becoming LC? Huge huge change.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Good points. Though I am hoping Jon wargs in the next episode to help with the attacks.


He won't warg, but I bet he frees the wolves before the attack.
2244	Bran's Legs	2014-05-02	The real question is if Jon finds out about his parentage from Bran or the Reeds will any of you stop watching the show? I don't think it will effect the stannis Jon interactions at all , He seemed pretty determined to turn down any title Stannis offered him it would make more sense actually if he knew about his own heritage.


Â 
If Stannis knew Jon was Rhaegar's son, wouldn't that make things â<U+0080>¦ problematic? I suppose not since Jon is on the Knight's Watch and has given up all rights. Of course, that hasn't stopped the Boltons from sending Locke to the Wall and thinking Jon is a threat.

Stannis was also willing to legitamize Jon as the heir to Winterfell. It would indeed create nothing but problems for Team Dragonstone and the rest of the Seven Kingdoms if they knew Jon's true parentage, Night's Watch or not

2259	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	"Kill the Masters" written in plain English on the wall in Meereen was pretty silly IMO.



This.
Â 
Also, keeping Ghost alive makes no sense. But, overall, extremly good episode.
2260	Mark Antony	2014-04-28	Was waiting for this thread 
"Kill the Masters" written in plain English on the wall in Meereen was pretty silly IMO.
Yup very corny 
-Margaery waltzing into Tommens chamber in the middle of the night
-Whatever the fuck they have been doing with Ghost these last seasons 
-The Direwolves being captured and caged by the NW rapists
-Bran and Company getting captured 
-Appearance of the White Walker at the end, I mean he looked ridiculous 
Probably more, I normally would of complained about Aiden Gillen but I thought he was bearable last night.
2261	Brother Walfrid	2014-04-28	Hated the way the direwolves are apparently really stupid and can be easily captured. Bigger character change than Jaime's from last week.
Â 
Apart from that, loved the episode.
2262	StarkContrast	2014-04-28	The little guy from the village that the wildlings raided, didn't his mother call him Guymon? Now the NW men called him Ollie?!
2263	Sigrunn	2014-04-28	That kid crying. 
Â 
I also dislike the idea of Bran being captured. It's a a futile delay, just as useless as Dany's dragons being stolen.Â

2264	Tadco26	2014-04-28	Capturing the direwolves is a stretch, but I could buy it if it added something to the story. The problem is that it makes things even less believeable that they would capture Hordor and start beating him and stab him for no reason, but would capture, cage and feed Ghost... They can't have infinite supplies, so what's the point? Someone in another thread suggested guard dog, but you can't have a guard dog in a cage and expect him to guard anything, and you can't have a guard dog that is more dangerous to you than just about anything it could guard you from.And though Bran will escape/the mutineers are going to die before it matters, I am curious how a bunch of Night's Watch deserters were planning on collecting a random for a noble hostage? Even getting the message to someone who cared enough to pay a ransom would be incredibly difficult and dangerous, much less collecting on it.Likewise I don't see what Sam telling Jon about Bran being alive added to the story to justify changing it, and not only did he tell Jon, but Locke appears to have overheard them too, which is exactly the sort of situation that promising not to tell anyone is meant to protect against. And to top it off they decided to have the Sam tells Jon that Bran is alive moment off camera...
2265	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-28	"Kill the Masters" written in plain English on the wall in Meereen was pretty silly IMO.


Â 
It looked like modern day graffiti. That part was so corny.
Â
2266	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-28	Littlefinger's accent as usual. Not nearly as bad as last week but still kept me distracted from an otherwise excellent scene.Â
2267	Roose Seal	2014-04-28	Meereen:
Even if that's how it's written in the books, the whole thing felt so easyÂ when seen on screen.These cities have been around for thousands of years and it'sÂ that easy to invade them?
"Kill the masters" looked super dumb. All I could think of was "Life of Brian"
Dany on top of the pyramid looked really cheap.Â 
King's Landing:
I find AG atrocious usually but he was alright last night. Almost S1-level (but then again, that's not saying much)
QoT: good riddance, her lines are about as subtle as Littlefinger's voice.
Jaime/Cersei: well we expected that from the whole "it was consensual" nonsense but Jaime being back to being a super nice guy felt especially jarring.
Tyrion bores me.
Wall/North
The guys at Craster's Keep are just painful to watch. How one-dimensionally evil can they be? Drinking out of Mormont's skull? Oh and let's throw in another rape scene for good measure, can never have enough of those eh?
Direwolves getting captured. Dumb.
Jon Snow's face.
The long horse ride leading up to the final scene looked absolutely fantastic but the Night King's [sic] looked like Picolo in Dragonball Evolution.
Also, WHERE IS VARYS?
Â
2268	StarkContrast	2014-04-28	It's a heck of a long way from Craster's to the Land of Always Winter. The WW that fetched the child rode so slowly it ought to have taken him years to get there :-)
2269	Ghosteline	2014-04-28	How on earth did they catch Ghost and hold him down while building him a cage - which he cannot break? Direwolves are supposed to be beasts.
2270	Ghosteline	2014-04-28	Oh and the Night King looked pretty plastic and cartoonish :S
2271	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-28	The fact that Craster's Keep is only 60 miles from Castle Black. That's only 2 days ride/3-4 days march!!! The Night Watch is really a bunch of wussies. Weren't they all completely exhausted and needed a few days rest once they reached the Keep at the beginning of ACoK.Â 
Â 
Also Bran's wigÂ Â
2272	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-28	This thread is basically why I think this season will be my last. It's just so hard to go back to thinking the show is good after having read the books. And now they're starting to have spoilers for those too...Inferior dialogue, dumbed down plots/characters, and spoilers for the superior series? No thanks
2273	Roose Seal	2014-04-28	The fact that Craster's Keep is only 60 miles from Castle Black. That's only 2 days ride/3-4 days march!!! The Night Watch is really a bunch of wussies.

Â 
Also Bran's wigÂ Â  


Hah, i wasn't sure if it was a wig but that shot when he's backed up against the wall in Craster's Keep I thought "wtf is up with his hair"
2274	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-28	So, first, in 4:01 the cast of 300 accidentally walks onto the wrong set and are now portraying the Thenns.
Â 
In 4:04, the cast of Thor walks onto the wrong set and now they are basically still frost giants.
Â 
Honestly, these characters look so campy it degrades the show. Game of Thrones is supposed to be above this silliness. This is like almost Resident Evil silliness.
Â 
Â 
2. How the heck is Bran anywhere near Craster's Keep? Its 60 miles from Castle Black. Bran left from the Nightfort. He also left around a month ago. They can't have only gone 60 miles or less in that time.Â
2275	Heir to Winterfell	2014-04-28	It would take longer to prep a skull, especially with supplies that would be available at Craster's.Â  However, it was pretty easy for me to suspend disbelief because it made it easier to hate Karl.
2276	NightStark	2014-04-28	It would take longer to prep a skull, especially with supplies that would be available at Craster's.Â  However, it was pretty easy for me to suspend disbelief because it made it easier to hate Karl.


All you have to do is boil it similar to how you clean up a deer skull to mount it.
2277	Dain Storm	2014-04-28	The Bran captured plot line seems as bad as the still to come Asha assaults the Dreadfort plot.
2278	greensleeves	2014-04-28	I actually really liked this episode up until it went north of the Wall. Â My few complaints:
Â 
- Rapes for boob quotaÂ  Â  Â  
Â 
- The Margaery / Tommen scene wasn't very big in the sense-making department, but Ser Pounce made up for it.
2279	Chebyshov	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce wasn't black
2280	Night's_King	2014-04-28	Everything. Worst episode until now.
2281	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	Everything. Worst episode until now.


Â 
LOL.
2282	Roose Seal	2014-04-28	- Rapes for boob quotaÂ  Â  Â  


"Apparently, last week was too rapey or not rapey enough. Let's have the girls naked this time. Oh and they should be screaming. Oh and have the guys drink out of skulls too. Who's complex and ambiguous now HUH?!"
2283	Cas Stark	2014-04-28	"Apparently, last week was too rapey or not rapey enough. Let's have the girls naked this time. Oh and they should be screaming. Oh and have the guys drink out of skulls too. Who's complex and ambiguous now HUH?!"


Â 
LOL, but narry a drop of blood or dead person, let alone a rape in the sack of Meereen to be found. Targaryen Jesus Rules.
2284	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	I hate how insensitized the show seems to be regarding rape (kind of like murder in "The Following"). Not that the books are better in this regard, mind you...
Â 
I don't like the whole resolution of the LF-Olenna plot. It makes it sound as if they're in cahoots, but both of them (LF especially) are too clever for that
Â 
Margaery and Tommen was weird. I don't think I'll ever get over this older version of Tommen
Â 
Sam only know considering the possibility of Gilly being in danger. Wut? You dropped her in a freaking whorehouse, you fool!
Â 
Of the North of the Wall parts, I'm of two minds:
Â 
On the Bran thing, yeah, it reeks of fan-fiction, but to be fair, he has like one chapter before reaching the cave. At least this gives him something to do other than talk beneath trees as he did all past season
Â 
The White Walker leader or whatever looked cheap. Camp, camp everywhere! But I can't fault the show for showing more of these guys. It's been five books and almost 20 years and book readers still know shit about the Others, so this is a spoiler I can live with
2285	goddessoftitsandwine	2014-04-28	Cersei not mentioning Jaime's rape and him not giving two shits about it and went ahead to be "good Jaime" again. Ruined the character. Thanks HBO


Â 
I don't think D&D even know what they're trying to do with Jaime at this point. Â That goodbye scene with Brienne was hilariously out of character and especially cringe-worthy after he raped his sister last week.Â 
Â 
And then more gratuitous, overly-sexualized rape this episode. Â Shocker.
2286	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-28	Â 
Cersei not mentioning Jaime's rape and him not giving two shits about it and went ahead to be "good Jaime" again. Ruined the character. Thanks HBO
Kit Harrington needs a haircut. His huge fluffy hair is bothering me.


Ahahahahahah~
Kit's hair is awesome.
This thread is hilarious this week.Â 

On Mormont's skull, Karl totally boiled it. Its a process. Its not like it rotted off that quickly. *snicker*
About Craster's Keep stuff...*chortle* Well its obvious its to show just how freaking depraved these guys have gone. Remember what they were before they joined the Night's Watch? *muffled laughter* I mean, they were rapers, killers, and just plain nasty. Without the order of the Watch and unchecked, these guys got disgusting. So to see this and the Others take the baby into something that looks an awful lot like order is a really awesome direction choice. The contrast here...i was really hoping this wasnt lost on you lot, but....*outright guffaw* Seems i was disappointed. :v
Â 
Did i have nitpicks? Yeah i got a couple. The "Kill The Masters" should have been in High Valyrian or Ghiscari. Yeah i agree with that. Having it in English is a little...lulzy, but oh well.Â 
Ghost being caged bothered me a lot. Ive come to terms with it though. If domes get chomped on next week, it'll be worth it.Â 
Â 
Jon knowing about Bran made me facepalm but closer inspection leads me to think that this could go somewhere cool. Still a bit shifty about it though.Â 
Â

The rape sequence was disgusting.
Yes, I understand they're getting raped, but after episode 3, couldn't they just imply the girls were being violated? Did we really need to see like 3 rapes going on at the same time? What the fuck is wrong with these writers?
2291	Lady Arwen	2014-04-28	I don't understand why we're seeing so much of the White Walkers. It takes all the mystique out of them. Part of what makes the WW and the "Others" so scary is their obscurity. Also, Craster's sons get turned into White Walkers by getting tapped with a finger? That's all it takes?Â
2292	Queen of Whores	2014-04-28	Jaime saying "what the hell" and Bronn telling Jaime that it isn't Tyrion's style to have people killed. More whitewashing. *sigh*
2293	Wsaharan	2014-04-28	The WW HQ was a little bit too "morghulish" for my taste.
Loved the shot with Dany and the Targaryen banner behind her on The Kremlin..... I mean The Great Pyramid.
2294	Jon-Michael Pearson	2014-04-28	I hate the Bran adn Caster sceene
Â 
Â but I never once thought Jaime raped Cersi last week, maybe it is becuase that is not what happened in the book and that blares my judgement,Â  but I took it as not here,Â Â  not I dont want to.
2295	Rapsie	2014-04-28	The scene at Crasters was ridiculous and the rapes seem to be there to serve D&D's sex for the episode quota. Also Rast was so over the top comic villain it was just yawn. I'd much rather have had some other character than this made up filler for half an episode. 
Also from the look of the where the others live, Westeros backs onto Skyrim.

Â 
I think its to the benefit of the show only fans.
Â 
So far the story North of the Wall is seen as extremely boring and a waste of time. The show people need to get the viewers to invest into that story line. Without something for them to go ohhh wow about they wont commit to it, its not as exciting as dragons.
Â 
I dont see it as a huge spoiler for book fans, because we always KNEW there was a Nights King (it does squash some fan theories though) it just kinda puts them into focus before the books have had a chance to really get into them.
Â 
I thought it was a good episode that but a bad book adapation.
2299	CarCrashFiance	2014-04-28	This show has no one paying attention to continuity.
Â 
Grey Worm and Missandei are learning the common tongue. The show makes it a point that Dany is in a foreign land. Then, literally seconds later, the slaves and slave masters are writing and reading in 'English'.
Â 
The mutineers are concerned with having to feed an infant. Supplies are limited. Yet they have no problem giving food to a direwolf? Uh.....what?
Â 
And talk about hack writing. They have Bran, Jojen, Hodor, and Meera. Why not just kill them? Or kill Jojen and Hodor, rape Meera like Craster's daughters, and just throw Bran into the corner. Why are they keeping them alive? It's like those horrible Hollywood movies where the bad guys have the good guys right in their sights but instead pause for a second so the good guy's reinforcements show up at the last second.
Â 
The Night's King spoiler was ridiculous. I just laugh at GRRM's laziness now. He'll probably be dead before book seven is done. This is probably D&D and HBO's way of saying "hurry up or we'll spoil book seven on the show before you're even done with book six". If this isn't a wake up call to GRRM then nothing is.

2300	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-28	Common Tongue graffiti in Meereen
Ghost being held captive - it's an angry direwolf, kill it FFS
Meera Reed standing up no more than 20m away from rapists and walking off while talking over her shoulder. I was actually glad she got punched in the face.
2301	Fat Trell	2014-04-28	How did Grey Worm survive his Unsullied training? Seems pretty emotional and thoughtful for a borderline walking vegetable.
Â 
The slave scene seemed a little cheesy.
Â 
Would it have been that hard to have the graffiti written in Latin?
Â 
No sack of Meereen, don't see what Dany will spend the next one and a half seasons doing in her court. Is the Shavepate confirmed?
Â 
Jaime is now in the fast lane of his redemption arc. Rape to wholesome benefactor in a week? He must go to Arya's grief counselor.
Â 
Brienne remembers Sansa? Stoneheart would be justified in executing Brienne at this point.
Â 
I just don't agree with the show runners interpretation of Jon. He isn't an arrogant kid anymore. I don't think they really grasp that he moved past that stage halfway through the first book. Having such a huge gap between his arriving at the Wall and the Thenns' attack means he has to do something though.
Â 
Since when did Jon become a champion of the common man? He's more a lordling than half the heirs in the realm.
Â 
For one of the alleged smartest characters in the series, Sam isn't very bright.
Â 
We need more rape. Rape is what makes this show gritty. Without rape its LotR without all the cool elves and hobbits.
Â 
Was Gilly the only non-indoctrinated daughter-wife of Craster? They all seem pretty excited to sacrifice that kid.
Â 
My dog barks uncontrollably whenever he hears a baby cry so that was a big negative to me.
Â 
The Night's King/Great Other thing was an awesome scene. Little too cartoony though.
2302	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-28	Oh god I forgot about that idiotic a gift for the gods chant. Talk about cringe. They're so hamfisted in everything they do...

I have so many nits to pick, it's easier to think of what I liked. Jaime and Brienne (these actors are so good in the roles, they can make anything work, but I had to pretend he was book Jaime) and Pod (I love Pod, and that he was so happy to be Brienne's squire). And Tommen and Ser Pounce. I love the actors, they are the ones who make the show, and visually, it's beautiful. I just wanted to see a more faithful version. The book stories are better, and they could have been shown with some good adaptation changes. The changes I don't like are mostly changes in characterization, but also I miss the great stories and the great lines.The scene at Crasters was ridiculous and the rapes seem to be there to serve D&D's sex for the episode quota. Also Rast was so over the top comic villain it was just yawn. I'd much rather have had some other character than this made up filler for half an episode.This, too.

The guards bounced as soon as they saw the slaves coming. They go back through the alley they came. Right by the second mob of armed, bloodthirsty slaves.
2306	Allison of Tarth	2014-04-28	It bugged me that Locke claimed to be from the south and Jon didn't bat an eye. I feel like Jon would be able to spot a fellow northerner from his accent or other cues.  Granted this is a pretty subtle thing to depict on-screen, but the accents on the show have always bugged me so I'ma nitpick it.
Also, didn't Olena scold Marg just a couple of episodes ago for speaking too openly in KL?  And now she loudly and clearly claims responsibility for Joff's death with Varys' birds undoubtedly listening.
2307	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-28	^Olenna's leaving. She dont care anymore and shes right. Cersei is too distracted.Â

*squint* I think you need to look a little harder at why its so grim in Craster's and what the direction was telling us as a viewer. The contrast between that horribleness and what follows it is pretty freaking brilliant if you think about it. Humans = really disgusting, destroying things and causing chaos. An Other comes up as bold as you please, takes the baby and where does he go? To a quiet, orderly place where Others are standing in ceremony, waiting. The baby is taken from the disgusting environment of the Keep to this quiet, cold place where order seems to reign. It was intentional and not exactly for pure shock value.Â

Â 
Because they're high born so they can ransom them or use them to get wealth or power.
Â 
Especially after finding out Bran is a Stark...very valuable!
Â 
Also, 3 High born kids North of the Wall looks really dodgy so I suspect they want to figure out what's going on.
2309	Simon Steele	2014-04-28	Shit this is the worst episode I've seen, though the Red Wedding is right there with it (the jump into frame, slash a throat, and then leap off camera attacks were hilarious). But as boring as everything was, Craster's sealed the horridness. I mean drinking out of Mormont's skull, monologues that aspire to be wanna be Shakespeare as in the background a woman is just being raped. It wasn't sickening like they wanted it to be, it's like some moron high school kid who has no idea what it is that makes people sick was allowed to write this scene. Might as well have that ex Night Watch raper guy just walk around with a baby skin draped over his head while he rapes women (until they die).
Â 
Soooooooooo bad.
Â 
I tried so hard to just let go this time and enjoy it. But it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad.

Â 
I do like your thoughts on this, though I have to admit, I am getting tired of the rape scenes.Â  But, I do like your thoughts on the scene, and the chance that the WW, show or book, MIGHT not be the evullest evuls that evah evulled.Â  For nitpicking purposes, I do have to say that the Demon Looking King didn't help for looking at it in that aspect, but who knows, WW/Others might also have to deal with the chances of good, bad, and/or evil and incompetant leadership, too.
Â 
On the other idea of the WWs being brothers, since they've been around for so long, I would suspect we have some in the ranks that are Craster's sons, but surely, over the thousands of years, and lots of wildings to take from, there must be more than one source over time.Â  Perhaps Craster was the only sure source during his time, though.
Â 
Still, I do have to nitpick the appearance of Evul WW King of The Night.Â  Obviously, I've missed lots of movies and or games, as I haven't a clue who half the characters are from other outlets that The HBO NightKing is said to resemble.Â
2311	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-28	Oh, I have a couple backwards nits to pick.Â  I'm going to miss seeing Jaime and Brienne scenes, now, I realized that immediately.Â  They've been one of the few consistant treats even with rewrites.Â  I'm hopeful for Brienne and Pod, though.Â  I'm wondering if the QoT is really going or will she stay for a new wedding and was only prepping the audience and Marg for her departure.Â  Either way, I have to admit, I'll miss her, so it's a nitpick for looking forward.Â
2312	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-28	Olenna saying Cersei isn't stupid.
2313	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-28	Â 
I do like your thoughts on this, though I have to admit, I am getting tired of the rape scenes.Â  But, I do like your thoughts on the scene, and the chance that the WW, show or book, MIGHT not be the evullest evuls that evah evulled.Â  For nitpicking purposes, I do have to say that the Demon Looking King didn't help for looking at it in that aspect, but who knows, WW/Others might also have to deal with the chances of good, bad, and/or evil and incompetant leadership, too.
Â 
On the other idea of the WWs being brothers, since they've been around for so long, I would suspect we have some in the ranks that are Craster's sons, but surely, over the thousands of years, and lots of wildings to take from, there must be more than one source over time.Â  Perhaps Craster was the only sure source during his time, though.

HBO likes to be literal and i actually thought the ruckus from the pigs in the Keep were clue enough. But i really cant find it in me to throw a temper tantrum about it.Â 
I dont mind the Other's appearance. He totally looks like my avatar, but oh well. He actually looks creepier than a Marvel frost giant.Â 

Â 
Olenna saying Cersei isn't stupid.

LOL! You! You won the thread. Hands down. I nearly forgot about that and yeah i got all "dude no." in Olenna's general direction.

Â 
I'm not tempertantruming, just eye rolling.Â  My main problem was the appearance of the dude seems to take away the idea that they might not be evil.Â  Who knows, we may never see him again with that exact look, they may doctor it up again.Â
2315	Le Cygne	2014-04-28	Again, we are talking the way rape is presented.Â  Also that it's the "go to" thing to add.Â Just when you thought â<U+0080><U+009C>Game of Thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D> couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get rapier â<U+0080>¦ it goes and gets more rapey. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s really unfortunate how shortsighted Team Throne Games was about the avalanche of outrage that would meet the amazingly poorly executed rape of Cersei (Lena Headey) last week (sorry, nope, Alex Graves, you canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t just switch from nonconsensual to consensual sex in the middle of the act, and if thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what you were going for, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not what you pulled off). This weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode featured a gruesome scene in Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep with a ridiculously gratuitous portrayal of the rape and abuse of women. To make matters worse, my book-reading 'GOT' watch party pals informed me that this entire section wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even in the book at all (much like the notable difference between the icky, but consensual sex scene between Jaime and Cersei in the books and what we saw on screen last week). Therefore the only ones we have to thank for this are HBO, the showrunners, and unfortunately, director Michelle McLaren. And yeah, bad guys, characterization, whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s coming to them, and all that, but it seemed as though that could have been attained without all that fleshy thrusting in the background. I want to like this show (and I do) and they make it very hard sometimes.As I mentioned, my book-reading pals mentioned that much of this episode diverted from the text, most notably, whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s happening in the North. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know what it is in the book, but this ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t it. Of course, it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to be entirely faithful to the book, as per the vision of Benioff and Weiss, but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interesting to note when and where it does divert and why that might be. I just take the slightest bit of umbrage with that being even more onscreen rape, but you know HBOâ<U+0080><U+0099>s got a boob quota and they sure as hell arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t filling it with â<U+0080><U+009C>Silicon Valley.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â http://blogs.indiewi...arning-20140428

2316	Aldi_AA	2014-04-28	The logistics of that giant ass banner made no sense it annoyed me it was was too big for someone to hang up there also where did it come from.
2317	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-28	I pretty much hated the entire episode outside of the LF/Sansa scene. I absolutely HATED the Crasters/Bran and company scene. Contrived filler just to give Bran screentime. If they wasted less time on pointless filler, then we could get more screentime with other characters that do stuff that actually matters. I actually tuned out a few times and played with my phone. The only other episode I did that with was Season 3 episode 7(The Bear and the Maiden Fair).Â

2318	acejack	2014-04-28	It bugged me that Locke claimed to be from the south and Jon didn't bat an eye. I feel like Jon would be able to spot a fellow northerner from his accent or other cues. Granted this is a pretty subtle thing to depict on-screen, but the accents on the show have always bugged me so I'ma nitpick it.


Â 
Thought the same thing. Even though Jon hasn't spent any of his adult life in the south, you would think working alongside NW from all around the Seven Kingdoms he would be able to spot an accent.
Â 
Locke is like someone with a Wisconsin accent claiming to be from Georgia.
2319	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-04-28	Biggest nitpick wasn't so much the wording on the wall in the "Kill the Masters" scene, but that the converging crowds in the little alleyway and the way it was filmed instantly made me think of Pac Man.Â  Waka waka waka...
Â 
Minor:Â  I had a little giggle when Lady Olenna says to Margaery that she is even hotter than Olenna was in her day, because I just so happen to know exactly what Olenna looked like in her day, and as pretty as Margaery's eyes are, I'd have to disagree. 
Â 
And I thought it was probably the most yawn-worthy ep yet...
2320	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-28	Nitpicking (small ones really, it was a great episode):
Â 
- "kill the masters", really? also, how annoying is it when all Dany has to do is to tell some people to kill some other people and then of course they listen to her instantly and then she can rule 'em all cause she's so awesome... gah
Â 
- Painting Margaery more innocent than they should
Â 
- Margaery/Tommen scene made me cringe. That new Tommen boy is sweet, but way to old for such a scene not to have a sexual subtext
2321	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-28	It bugged me that Locke claimed to be from the south and Jon didn't bat an eye.

Granted this is a pretty subtle thing to depict on-screen, but the accents on the show have always bugged me so I'ma nitpick it.
Also, didn't Olena scold Marg just a couple of episodes ago for speaking too openly in KL? And now she loudly and clearly claims responsibility for Joff's death with Varys' birds undoubtedly listening.


Â 
Yeah, there was definately something off about the idea of Locke presenting himself as being from the Stormlands.Â  He could have named himself Game Warden from anywhere in the North, or even the Neck, it didn't have to be a super prominent family.Â  There is something about Locke that does come off as Northern, maybe it's the clothes, the inconsistant accents, LOL, I'm not sure what.Â  I think it was a total bad call on the show's part to put in that dumb ass line and that dumb ass location.Â  Since Jon is seeming to be much more in character this season, it did piss me off.Â  And, that reminds me, where is his friend Pyp???Â  The Mummer's Monkey who could pick out any accent, and ya know, the guy who is a friend, and does more than just look on??Â  That's a big nit.Â  I'm not sure if I noticed whether he stood up to volunteer?Â  Anyone know for sure?

Â 
LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLing at the Pac Man reference.
Â 
And, yes, I had the same thoughts about Diana Rigg, my ex boyfriend was IN LOVING LUST with her.Â  Not an old rerun of The Avengers was ever missed in our house.Â  I just had to admit, I had the same thoughts, Ms. Dormer has nothin on the young Lady Diana.Â  I loved The Avengers, by the way.Â  Even before I met my ex.Â  It was a fav show of one of my childhood friends.Â  The reruns, that was all we had back in my extreme youth, uhf reruns, not cable tv.Â

2324	darksellsword	2014-04-28	The accents are not very consistent i hate to throw cold water on a lot of your perceptions of accents on this show but just about every Irish actor in the cast I can hear their distinct Irish accents at times . I heard Ran on his video stating that he thought Richard madden and Sean Beans accents sounded very alike but to me it was as clear as night and day that Sean Beans accent was Northern English working class and Richard Madden has a middle class Scottish accent. Aiden Gillen sounds very Irish at times in his phrasing ,its a shame he didn't just go with it from the start. If Locke was a game keeper for some Storm lord what would be the problem with him being Northern? I'm sure people travel around looking to earn a living. I had a problem with the ghost being caged up at crasters until I thought about how Sam had the trust of ghost and may have caged him before the mutiny. I think Karl may have enjoyed ghosts savagery at the fist remember the show ghost has been with them since Jon left to go search for the half hand, maybe Karl wants to use ghost to keep the others in line, nothing like the threat of being fed to Â a huge "beast" to keep discipline. Its in a cage throw it some meat and give it some water. They could also believe Ghost sees the WW before they do .If I remember correctly ghost was aware there was a wight in Lord commander Mormonts quarters in the first season. I also don't assume that the trap was set for summer. I heard people complaining about Bran and his group headed towards Crasters, Well as far as I was aware Bran was leading them perhaps his warging of summer is influencing the course he was taking.In the books the starks direwolves had some kind of bond or psychic connection to each other . i don't think summer would of been ok with Ghost being caged like that and it would of affected Bran as well.
2325	Batavian	2014-04-28	I had more of a problem with Ghost being allowed to live as a captive. What's the use of a live direwolf? More likely Ghost would end up like Grey Wind...killed in his cage.
2326	Raksha 2014	2014-04-28	The rape sequence was disgusting.
Yes, I understand they're getting raped, but after episode 3, couldn't they just imply the girls were being violated? Did we really need to see like 3 rapes going on at the same time? What the fuck is wrong with these writers?


Â 
Â 
I guess the writers just figured we wouldn't think the Mormont-murdering mutineers were evil enough with just one rape; they had to turn it into a rape-o-rama (which sounds incredibly offensive, well, the scene sorta was, even though thankfully fiction). Â And of course, Jaime's a rapist but nobody's supposed to care.
Â 
I did like the Grey Worm/Missandei scene. Â Poor guy will probably be killed off just because he and Missandei have a sweet little friendship going. Â
2327	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-28	I had more of a problem with Ghost being allowed to live as a captive. What's the use of a live direwolf? More likely Ghost would end up like Grey Wind...killed in his cage.


Â 
While I think they should have explained it, I'm just giving the bozos the benefit of the doubt and speccing that Karl (I think that's his name, LOL) thinks Ghost might be worth a ransom, like Bran?Â  Too bad he's too busy raping and drinking and raging his way through Craster's Keep instead of doing anything about it.Â  But, that was the BS excuse I've told myself, since we have lack of information, again, from the show.Â 
Â 
A bigger nit I have to pick is the fact we finally get two direwolves and they're both incapacitated in some fashion.Â  Hopefully, that situation will be remedied.Â  Ghost looked HUGE, though.Â  He looked really good.Â  He might be the wolf that is best done with the special effects.Â  I've noticed that more than once.Â

That's a good a reason as any!
I thought it strange that the trap sprung on Summer was right in front of Ghost's cage, almost as if Ghost was there as "bait" to lure someone to him. Very odd.

I agree, and actually mentioned the inconsistency of the accents in my comment.  They're all over the place.   It's a small nit but it's something that I wish could be done better both on the show and in the books.
2330	house martell 2	2014-04-28	Seems like the Lands of Always Winter, the headquarters of the ancient and mysterious long not seen White Walkers is quick jaunt from Crasters Keep, because a new born baby wrapped in a towel being held by the living embodiment of cold, trotting along a dead horse at a leisurely pace, presumably without any baby food (unless male WW lactate?) survives the trip no problem.
2331	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	re: "Kill The Masters" grafitti - likely they didn't want to have to invent written Valyrian?Â 


Â 
They have shown written Valyrian in the past. More likely they just forgot. The set design team weren't talking to the prop team or something similar.... but it is an issue for me given how much effort they put into creating these other languages, at a highly obvious point they just don't use them.
2332	kephv	2014-04-28	Everything involving the Wall and north of it. Also, the White Walker designs are terrible. They apparently only range from old men to Darth Maul.

Â 
They try to have people from the Capital sound more refined (The Queen's English) than in the North. I think they end up overlooking a lot in casting actors because at the end of the day, HBO is an American network and most Americans can't tell the difference between Southern/NorthernEnglish/Irish/Scottish/Welsh. But in Westeros people from different regions do have different accents and being in a very cosmopolitan place like Castle Black you would notice. Yes, he could be from somewhere and end up somewhere else, but if someone with a New England accent said they were from Texas, it would arouse suspicion. He could have said White Harbor just as easily. I'm not canceling my subscription to HBO about it, but this was the thread for nitpicking.
Â 


Accents don't prove anything.

Littlefinger sounds like he's from the South, North, Essos, and everywhere in between when he feels like it.

2334	acejack	2014-04-28	And yes, "KILL THE MASTERS" should have been written in Valyrian characters and just subtitle the slave master as he reads it aloud.
2335	Eve	2014-04-28	I loved the mention of HBO's "boob quota".Â  HBO needs to remember that just because they CAN show all the bouncingÂ boobs they want, does not necessarily mean that they SHOULD.
2336	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	This is worth a read, particularly in light of that awful scene at Craster's:
Â 
http://www.esquire.c...of-thrones-rape
2337	Mad Monkey	2014-04-28	I think Margaery derived an overly-literal interpretation from Olenna's anecdote. The whole, "Oh HAI, I know your brother was just assassinated and all, but let me demonstrate how easy it is to get past your elite guards and do whatever I'd like for as long as I'd like without anyone noticing," is probably going to be more terrifying than enchanting for the poor kid. It does make Cersei's revulsion at the Margaery/Tommen match much more understandable though.
2338	Night'sQueen	2014-04-28	"Kill the Masters" written in plain English on the wall in Meereen was pretty silly IMO.

That really took me out of the moment.
2339	Mad Monkey	2014-04-28	That really took me out of the moment.Yeah, it would be almost as jarring if Littlefinger pulled out a cell phone or Cersei took a long drag from a cigarette. I think the fact that they used constructed languages for the most part (including for most of that scene!) is what made it jarring. There are a lot of shows where English is used as a stand-in for the fictional language that the characters are "really" speaking and we accept that for the most part, but because this show spends a lot of time and energy building workable languages for scenes (especially in Essos) it's surprising that they don't bother using that. It would be like if they spent $100,000 animating Dany's dragons but then at the last minute just had a gecko with wings taped on lowered onto the set on a wire.
2340	Tankbuster	2014-04-29	(unless male WW lactate?)Â 


Â 
Thank you, now to add more fuel to my nightmarefire blaze.
Â 
Locke as a gamewarden in the SL is really weird, I mean, he could easily say that he was from whiteharbor or some place north of the neck, it was pretty jarring.
2341	Night'sQueen	2014-04-29	Where has this thread been all my life?!?! I have so many nits to pick, many already stated by others, but here goes...
- Lame English graffiti.  Bad enough it was in English but it looked too modern as well.  Note to show people, take a look at how the graffiti was done in HBO's Rome.
- Big ass black flag out of nowhere. 
- Easily trapped and caged direwolves. Not plausible to me. I can forgive many changes, but let's keep the mystique of the direwolves, kay?
-Rape, rape and more rape. It's enough already! Shock and disgust me another way for a change.
- Locke overhearing the Sam/Jon discussion about about Bran seemed so stagey and contrived. It was like a scene from Three's Company.
- I don't understand how the baby didn't freeze and or starve to death. I've seen comments on other threads mocking anyone who questions that, but it was another thing, like the graffiti, that took me out of the moment. 
- The bear-baiting of Hodor made me angrier than many other objectively more heinous things on the show.  Not a nit, per say, I'm just still pissed. Hodor?  
- Everyone keeps talking about Littlefinger's accent -- what about Tyrion's dreadful phony accent?!  It gets me every week! And Dinklage is such a good actor. 
- But the worst, for me, was the outright explanation of Joff's murder. It was Olenna. In the conservatory. With the necklace. It was cheesy and lame the way it was spelled out. Stop underestimating your audience!!!
2342	Epyon	2014-04-29	I think Margaery derived an overly-literal interpretation from Olenna's anecdote.

Â 
A boy entering puberty, gets woken up in the middle of the night, by a girl who looks like Natalie Dormer.... a boy, who mind you, really hasn't gotten to talk to a girl outside of his mom his entire life.... and the first thing she does is climb on top of him in bed, and tell him how she'll soon be his forever.... The only terrifying thing that will result from this situation, is the plight of the poor girls responsible for changing/washing his sheets.... 
Â 
Â 
EDIT:
And for whatever it's worth... I had a much harder time watching Hodor getting tortured/stabbed than any of Craster's flipper-baby/wives getting raped, or the last of the flipper babies get left out in the cold.... The only other scenes to really make me cringe/recoil like the Hodor scene where: Talisa getting stabbed eleventybillion times in the baby, and a few of the Theon/Ramsey scenes.

2343	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-29	Olenna did not need to say how better Margaery is than her.  She is seducing a twelve year old not rendering a man unable to walk.

Yep, it's been laughably bad from the pilot till now.  The only thing I miss from the audiobooks is Roy Dotrice's Tyrion.  I think the quips work better in a leprechauny voice.
2345	Lady Lurksalot	2014-04-29	Yeah, it would be almost as jarring if Littlefinger pulled out a cell phone or Cersei took a long drag from a cigarette.

This is a big nitpick of mine, too. Your description of how wrong it was had me laughing so hard I nearly pissed myself. Whenever I do see the dragons now, there's no way I'm not going to visualize said gecko with taped-on wings.
2346	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-29	How did Margaery get into Tommen's chamber when Cersei just ordered to have 4 guards at the door? How is she going to pull that off multiple times in the future, does she seduce the guards too? Is she Cersei?
Â 
The northern storyline... ugh there is just not anything that is even remotely true to the books. Not that is has to be, if it's interesting and logical story-wise, all for the better. But it was not. Ghost trapped and they keep him alive? Meera and co get captured that easily, how stupid are they? Why didn't they go free Summer first? Why does Bran blurt out his true name? And why do they care anyway? Why didn't Meera get immediatly raped at Camp Rape? How come all Craster's wives want to give a gift to the gods, was Gilly really the only sane one? Where did Locke get his speedboat to the Wall? Why say he's from the Stormlands? And he so happens to overhear Sam and Jon talking about Bran, sure...
Â 
That baby should have been freezed to death long before it got anywhere near White Walker Home. They could at least have tucked him in a little better, in stead of transporting him half-naked through the Lands of Winter.
Â 
How easy is it to get into Meereen with a giant group? That is some seriously bad defence. And they get to the slaves even more easily, on their own, without any guidance... Well I guess this was the least unrealistic of the things I listed, but still.
Â 
To end it: how stupid is Sam??? He is supposed to be smart, but leaving Gilly in a whorehouse with wildlings being send over the Wall. He couldn't have figured it out sooner? And I already hated him in the books...
Â 
I have to say the first half of the episode was still entertaining, the second half of everthing in the north was just boring and unrealistic, I was constantly checking how long the episode still was and hoping on something southern to come, something that has never happened before. A disappointment and I can't wait to never ever see Craster's Keep and these stupid wives again. And a bit less rape wouldn't hurt either. I also agree with the one stating Jon is in desperate need of a haircut.
2347	teemo	2014-04-29	My nitpick....this show sucks. Â Worst parts - Littlefinger not giving his speech on how fucking stupid Cersei is, and then the very next scene Olenna talking about how smart she is. Â The boob quota is made by a rape scene. Â Really? Â And thanks D&D for spoiling the books for me with your bad show.

-Whatever the fuck they have been doing with Ghost these last seasons 
-The Direwolves being captured and caged by the NW rapists
-Bran and Company getting captured 
-Appearance of the White Walker at the end, I mean he looked ridiculous 
Probably more, I normally would of complained about Aiden Gillen but I thought he was bearable last night.

Pretty much this.
2349	protar	2014-04-29	Not really a nitpick but I really feel as though there isn't any substantial material here until Tyrion's final trial (with Shae as a witness) as evidenced by the fact that the only exciting stuff happening was the invented stuff at and beyond The Wall. I'll admit that for show only watchers those scenes would be exciting, but it was hard for me to get overly invested in them knowing nothing would come of them. And ultimately no matter how gripping those scenes are for show watchers they will at the end of the day just be filler with no actual consequences on the plot.Â
2350	Roose Seal	2014-04-29	How did Margaery get into Tommen's chamber when Cersei just ordered to have 4 guards at the door? How is she going to pull that off multiple times in the future, does she seduce the guards too? Is she Cersei?


I'm not defending this episode because it was all around stupid, but when Marg enters the room, she readjusts her dress: I just assumed she went all HBO on the guard and he let her in.
2351	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-29	I'm not defending this episode because it was all around stupid, but when Marg enters the room, she readjusts her dress: I just assumed she went all HBO on the guard and he let her in.


But shouldn't it be four guards at the time? And Marg flashes some boob and so gets entrance, but isn't that still a huge risk should the guard report anything back to Jaime or Cersei? And just some friendly words and some touches are enough for the guard? Or did she go full Cersei-whore on the guard? I think it cheapens her character a lot should she let a guard touch her just to open a door. And if he didn't get to touch her, what an incredible bad guard.
2352	boojam	2014-04-29	I was going to post: Where is Daario?Watched E4 again last night, he's there.Michiel Huisman is standing under the awning where Dany gives her 'Justice' line.No lines.Can't make him out in the throne room E5, but I guess he's somewhere.
2353	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-29	Not enough rape.
Â 
Seriously, though... I thought the "who killed Joffrey?" reveal was too heavy-handed.
2354	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	Jaime saying "what the hell" and Bronn telling Jaime that it isn't Tyrion's style to have people killed. More whitewashing. *sigh*annoyed me too.
hated the explicit rape scenes that served no purpose but to show you how one dimensionnally evil these nw cunts are that we couldnt already tell by them drinking out of their murdered leaders skull with horrible raspy evil voices. Fuck that cartoon.
Not impressed with cersei and jaime rape not being mentioned
loved the meereen scene tbh but the english on the wall almost ruined the whole thing
ghost being captured and jon not making a fuss about that AT ALL and jon knowing about bran and fuxking bran being at crasters keep when they should be in a completely different area ugh
2355	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	Oh I didnt like the QoT/LF reveal either and making Marg a pawn who didnt know anything pissed me off big time because I was so hoping she was in on it
2356	Adhara	2014-04-29	To be fair, Marg might have strolled out of Tommens room just as the added guards arrived.
It may haveÂ appeared as if she were returning from the loo.
Â 
Nit pick: Crasters..
Â It's hard to concentrate on the conversation at hand,Â 
when backed by a chorus of ow! from around the room.
Keep it down! we have company.Â 
Â 
Spearing Hodor in the leg....
Â Taking a helpless thing and putting it in peril.
.gee..
how ordinary...
and the masses wept.
2357	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-29	On second thought, wouldn't the Graffiti on the wall be sort of a waste? Unless i'm wrong,I don't think the Slaves can read, and surely can't translate. Sothe Message would be mute.
Â 
The Jaime thing QOW mentioned threw me off a bit, pretty minor nitpick though imo.

I don't think that's Margaery's style, lowering herself to sexual intimacy with Boros Blount or whoever; but the show then went on to have her fondle a 12-year-old boy; so who knows. Â I did think Tommen's facial reactions were appropriate - a cross between I can't believe I'm going to be this lucky and deer-in-the-headlights-needing-to-get-some-advanced-sex-ed-quickly.

Book!Marg, sure. But I don't know, I'm done giving this show the benefit of the doubt concerning female characters and them possesssing any sort of agency other than their sexuality.
2360	SlowLoras	2014-04-29	gettin' real tired of all the rape. We get it. It's a crapsack world full of bad people. It's particularly shit if you own a vagina. But, you know, there are other ways to show how shitty a world is without constantly showing women getting raped, and worse, filming it in loving detail, with bouncing boobs clearly meant to titillate even as you sip your coffee and loudly annouce 'gosh, aren't those people just awful'?
Â 
*sigh*
Â 
Otherwise:
Â 
- Bran's wig/hair/whatever it is. It looks like it's about to leap off his head and attack someone. (Jon's hair is also developing its own personality, but at least it looks like it belongs on his head.)
Â 
- I didn't have a problem with Jon not knowing about Ghost's capture (his warging ability hasn't been touched upon yet) but you'd think he'd have wondered about Ghost at least once. Mind you, they seem to be keen on showing important Jon moments off-screen (see: Sam telling him about Bran.)
Â 
- Speaking of rape, are we not going to discuss this, showrunners? Not at all? Is Cersei not going to call Jaime out on what he did? No? We're going to show Jaime as being secretly honourable, sweet to Brienne, sending her off on a mission to save Sansa because he's secretly the nice guy Lannister, even though he raped his sister next to his dead son last week?
Â 
(I don't have a problem with Secret Nice Guy Jaime - it works fine in the books. But he didn't rape anyone in the books.)
Â 
- Jorah standing idly on the sidelines as the Unsullied stormed the sewers. I love show!Jorah and I love Iain Glen but please give the poor guy something to do other than just rasp 'Khaleeesiiiii' every other episode.
Â 
- Obviously, 'Kill Your Masters'. What a stupid oversight.
2361	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	The marg bit that annoyed me the most is that she wasnt in on joffreys death.
2362	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-29	Dany's glory shot atop Kremlin.Â 
Â 
Literally nothing bad happen in the sack of Meereen. No brutal murders and other stuff?Â 
If writers want to have rape in every episode it should have been in the sack of Meereen.Â 
For once show that Dany's army is just as pathetic as other armies present in Westeros and Essos.
More Dany whitewashing. *Sigh*
2363	jabulaniman	2014-04-29	Littlefinger's accent as usual. Not nearly as bad as last week but still kept me distracted from an otherwise excellent scene.

What do you mean? The hint of irish in it? Maybe they speak like that in the fingers, I mean other characters have a bit of an english accent.
I thought Aiden Gillen was perfect. Fits Littlefinger so damn well. Dat grin.
2364	Miodrag	2014-04-29	Olenna: "I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do."
Â 
Perhaps it's just my poor English, but isn't her first sentence ("some Targaryen or other") in contrast with the third one, in which she speaks about a very specific, albeit unnamed Targaryen ("I saw my intended")? Is it me not understanding some finesse of English language, or one more blatant example of terrible writing?
2365	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-29	Olenna: "I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do."

Is it me not understanding some finesse of English language, or one more blatant example of terrible writing?


Â 
"Some Targaryen or other" is a 'figure of speech' in English. It is an off-handed way of saying 'I can't recall their name, because I don't really care' or 'I don't think it is important enough to try to remember'.
2366	Miodrag	2014-04-29	The marg bit that annoyed me the most is that she wasnt in on joffreys death.


Â 
And it looks only stupider if we remember she was schooling Renly about The Game in Season 2. Back then, she was an experienced, all-knowing schemer, but this season she's constantly shocked by the power plays of her own family. Look like TV Margaery has the same condition as Benjamin Button, only on mental lever: she's more and more infantile with each season.

Â 
Thanks for clarification, but, truth be told, it didn't improve my impression of the line. Like, if the guy's look (or whatever it was that turned her off) was so important to Olenna, it's petty to mock him by refusing to recall his name, which she probably remembers clearly. We shouldn't be constantly reminded of how unsubmissive to men Olenna is. It's tiring.
2368	ovis alba	2014-04-29	Three things that were already mentioned I would nitpick about:
- The slave rebellion going too smooth
- Margaery being too naive when talking to Olenna (it's "should I go and get my brother" Margaery, so come on, she knows how it's done and in this case having the contrast of Sansa, who gets something for once makes it even worse)
- and personally: Jaime is getting way too nice again too fast. (I didn't mind the sept scene much, but now him distancing himself from Cersei just happens too fast for me, I would have liked a little bit more "emotional struggle" in deciding what to do with Sansa as it also means chosing between Cersei and Brienne)
2369	Talleyrand	2014-04-29	Bran not just warging one of the mutineers
2370	RedShirt47	2014-04-29	My only problem with this episode was how easily Meereen was captured. Give out a few swords and hey presto you have a city.
Also the Direwolves being taken so effortlessly.
Â 
I don't care about the other changes, they help the tv show flow better.
2371	digiFemme	2014-04-29	I think that Margaery's trying to get Tommen on her side was a good idea but I feel uncomfortable with her sneaking into his bedchamber in the middle of the night. I get that it's probably the only way she can get time with him alone but it's a little creepy- I mean, if Tommen were a girl and Marge a guy people would be pretty angry about it the way they are with Littlefinger and Sansa. Also, it emphasizes how poor the security of King's Landing is...I mean, this is the heir to the throne, how was she able to get past the guards? Just like in The Lion and the Rose were Tywin looked like a fool asking for the surrounding area to be guarded...only there was no one in the street to see Dontos and Sansa escape.
Â 
Why does Sansa say that Littlefinger killed Joffrey? He was part of the plot but it was the Queen of Thorns who put the poison in the cup. Wouldn't most of the culpability lie in the hands of the person who was actually there? I know people are glad she figured it was him but really- who wouldn't? He's so obviously sinister. Murder ship wrapped in fog, slaying Dontos in front of her, crushing the necklace and admitting he had it made weeks ago. You don't have to be a genius to figure that out. I would've been more impressed had she figured out that Olenna was the actual poisoner.
Â 
Not sure what to think of that White Walker and the baby.
2372	Greywolf2375	2014-04-29	While I did enjoy the episiode, I think there is a lot that can be nit picked with it.
Â 
- LF voice (again)
- Ghost being kept alive, the NW KNOW he is Snow's and what he can do
- Ghost being able to growl, I really miss that he isn't the silent brother
- Bran at Crasters
- Jon needing to go to Crasters
- Sam telling Jon about Bran
-apparently, that whole scenario bugs me
- the mutineers at Crasters not all having pencil moustaches to twirl - that's kind of how ridiculous they were portrayed
- drinking out of Mormonts skull...
- wanting to see more of the taking of Mereen
Â 
Â 


2. How the heck is Bran anywhere near Craster's Keep? Its 60 miles from Castle Black. Bran left from the Nightfort. He also left around a month ago. They can't have only gone 60 miles or less in that time.Â 


Â that's not something that bugs me...maybe the direction they took, but even for Hodor I would guess that dragging a sledge each day will get taxing and since it's not great weather they may have lost some time travelling.

2. After not showing Ghost for two seasons, he is shown in a cage? The direwolves are not supposed to be that silly nor that weak, how could they trap him?
3. The show spoiling the future books with the Great Other.
4. The Others looking really bad.
Â 


Â 
Â And, that reminds me, where is his friend Pyp???Â  The Mummer's Monkey who could pick out any accent, and ya know, the guy who is a friend, and does more than just look on??Â  That's a big nit.Â  I'm not sure if I noticed whether he stood up to volunteer?Â  Anyone know for sure?


I was looking for him too. He was sitting in the dining hall during Jon's speech, but he did not stand up. He will probably not go north with them - not sure why, maybe because he is a steward, not a ranger? But then Edd is a steward too, and he volunteered (which is also kinda out of character for Edd) ...

2377	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-29	"Kill the Masters" written in plain English on the wall in Meereen was pretty silly IMO.


^ This. Â I loved this episode, so it was only little small silly things that I noticed that bothered me. Â Like the Kill the Masters in English. Umm, what?
Â 
I was also really, really bothered by Bran's hair. Â I don't know what's going on there. Are they using a wig and a really bad one and if that's Isaac's hair, why are they styling it like that? Â Also, my goodness that dude has grown a lot! Â He was so tiny in the first season. Â 
Â 
It also kind of bothered me that Karl had such perfect teeth. Â I mean, I don't think there are any dentists in Westeros and his teeth were not only perfect, but shiny clean too. Â

2378	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-29	The easy way in which Daenerys takes the city annoys me. It's been subjected to slavery for what seems like forever and revolts never succeed, so how can slipping in a few men to encourage them with a few weapons suddenly overturn a whole city? For a TV viewer, everything just looks so simple and easy for Daenerys.

I do not think he was in a cage for two seasons, because the NW mutineers were only there since late in season 3, and they caught him some time later. Still bothers me though.
2380	Bowen	2014-04-29	It's just pure fan fiction wich gos along way to explaining why a lot don't like it,rapey scenes are over the top as is the language in my opinion,oh and drinking from Mormonts skull was embarrassing.
The dire wolves was bad also,both being trapped c'mon,oh and Sam has now become an oath breaker,man these D&D are unbelievable aren't they,season one was mega and stayed true to everything now they just purely making things up as they go along,I so much want to like this show but some of the stuff they done is just unbelievable!
2381	Cas Stark	2014-04-29	They are getting so lazy on the plotting. Â Marg sneaks into Tommen's room right after the previous king was killed at his wedding...are the KG that bad? Â Why couldn't they have her waylay him as he's somewhere outside having breakfast or doing something, so it would be a bit more realistic? Â Oh right. Because, it's more kinky to have Natalie Dormer in his bedroom on his bed. Â Ugh.
Â 
And the mutineers need to conserve their food...but they're feeding a giant direwolf for the heck of it...and the wolves apparently are really just like big dogs...easy to catch, nothing special about them. Â Double ugh.
2382	solidviper	2014-04-29	Yep, it's been laughably bad from the pilot till now. The only thing I miss from the audiobooks is Roy Dotrice's Tyrion. I think the quips work better in a leprechauny voice. 


Â 
Wow.
Â 
I think Peter's accent is bad, but the Tyrion in the audiobooks was dreadful and a bit insulting imo.
2383	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	Yeah, it would be almost as jarring if Littlefinger pulled out a cell phone or Cersei took a long drag from a cigarette. I think the fact that they used constructed languages for the most part (including for most of that scene!) is what made it jarring. There are a lot of shows where English is used as a stand-in for the fictional language that the characters are "really" speaking and we accept that for the most part, but because this show spends a lot of time and energy building workable languages for scenes (especially in Essos) it's surprising that they don't bother using that. It would be like if they spent $100,000 animating Dany's dragons but then at the last minute just had a gecko with wings taped on lowered onto the set on a wire.


Â 
Â 
Okay, I'm going to have a hard time getting the image of a gecko with wings out of my head.Â  Â
2384	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	This is a big nitpick of mine, too. Your description of how wrong it was had me laughing so hard I nearly pissed myself. Whenever I do see the dragons now, there's no way I'm not going to visualize said gecko with taped-on wings.


Â 
Â 
Exactly, that is a priceless gem I'm not soon to forget.Â  Maybe this species needs a name?Â  Winged Fire Gecko?Â
2385	Chebyshov	2014-04-29	Was it just me, or was that CGI of Mereen with the flag really terrible? Elsa's Ice Palace (or Icecrown Citadel, which was my first thought) barely passed muster, but that flag was a new level of weird looking.
2386	Talleyrand	2014-04-29	Locke claiming to be from the stormlands - surely in-story there'd be some accent issues and it gives to extra advantage than just telling the truth, or at least part of it - surely it would win some friend and sympathy points from Jon if he just said he had served in Robb's army.
2387	Fool of a Book	2014-04-29	Bran and Co were near enough Craster's to hear the baby crying, but Summer only noticed Ghost nearby after Bran warged? Â I think not. Â Summer had a pretty short run before she was trapped. Â The same goes for their proximity to the Keep. Â Surely the sprawl, noise, smell of fire etc. would have been more noticeable. Â And Summer is smarter than that.
Â 
The show is truly killing the direwolf connection.
Â 
Ghost growling. Â No, just no. Â And we've already had a captive taunted with spilled water (Theon). Â Is that supposed to be meaningful?
Â 
Sam turning into a moron. Â Why did the show need Gilly in Moles Town? Â What purpose does that possibly serve? Â I guess we'll find out. Â If this turns into another rape or near-rape scene for Gilly........ grrr.
Â 
Sam turning into an oathbreaker and telling Jon about Bran. Â And Jon not even mentioning Rickon.
Â 
Thorne getting revelations from Slynt about Jon, as if Slynt is supposed to know more about the NW and Jon than Thorne. Â Come on now.
Â 
Grey Worm and Missandei digging each other. Â Missandei is TEN in the books. Â The Common Tongue/English lesson might have made more sense if Grey Worm switched to the Common Tongue when talking to the slaves (he didn't), but the graffiti was ridiculous. Â Unless this is all a set up for Dany not shrieking her wooden Valyrian throughout her coming time in Meereen. Â Badly handled.
Â 
Hundreds of slaves hanging out in an easily found chamber, with not a single guard watching over them, after Dany spelled out her plan to the entire city.
Â 
The choreographed mindless waves of the ex slaves, perfectly spaced along the paths in the hill.

I could go on, but those were the things that bothered me the most.

Â 
Yeah, I know Pyp was there, my question is...........why the hell is he not being portrayed as seemingly very close with Jon, Grenn, Sam, Edd, anyone?Â  All he does is sit around and make annoyed-looking faces?Â  It's finally dawned on me that it seems as if Pyp is being seriously overhauled.Â  I am rewatching soon and am going to try and pay attention to whether or not Pyp volunteers, but I don't think he did.Â  I'm not sure it's about Pyp being a steward, it seems moreso about........changing the character of Pyp, IMO.Â
2393	'96Buck	2014-04-29	Cersei not mentioning Jaime's rape and him not giving two shits about it and went ahead to be "good Jaime" again. Ruined the character. Thanks HBO
Â 


I think the interpretation, rather than the (as you note) very strange "Cersei has no reaction to being raped, nor Jamie to raping her," should be "it appears neither of them considered what happened to be a rape, despite what it may have looked like to an observer."

Can somebody elaborate on those major changes for me? I seriously think a Stark family reunion is the only positive thing that can come out of this northern plot fiasco, the siblings have not seen each other for such a long time now, they need a warm scene together.
Â 

And the mutineers need to conserve their food...but they're feeding a giant direwolf for the heck of it...and the wolves apparently are really just like big dogs...easy to catch, nothing special about them. Â Double ugh.

I am pretty sure they were not feeding him, that is the problem - same as with water, Rast probably brought that big piece of meat just to tease Ghost, not to actually give it to him. I hate the Ghost-in-the-cage plot point, but starving an animal for the hell of it seems consistent with well, everything else in Craster's keep.
Â 


Â 
Yeah, I know Pyp was there, my question is...........why the hell is he not being portrayed as seemingly very close with Jon, Grenn, Sam, Edd, anyone?Â  All he does is sit around and make annoyed-looking faces?Â  It's finally dawned on me that it seems as if Pyp is being seriously overhauled.Â  I am rewatching soon and am going to try and pay attention to whether or not Pyp volunteers, but I don't think he did.Â  I'm not sure it's about Pyp being a steward, it seems moreso about........changing the character of Pyp, IMO.Â  


They are just playing him down, I guess that is necessary with that many characters ... it is a shame though. Maybe the other actors have such contracts that they need to appear on screen more?
2397	Allison of Tarth	2014-04-29	I find the audiobooks impossible to listen to. Roy Dotrice's voice is like a rock scraping on a cheese-grater and his accents are ridiculous.

I agree, in general.  I got to the point of not minding Tyrion's voice though, and would prefer his audiobook accent to Dinklage's.

That's faint praise...Dinklage is pretty inconsistent. Though I love him in the role, so I'm able to overlook it.Â 
Â 
Aidan Gillen's accent is a caricature. I was trying to imitate it for someone, and ended up sounding like Barbosa from Pirates of the Caribbean, which is a crossover that works surprisingly well:
"Welcome aboard the Black Pearl...Sophie Turner."

2400	boojam	2014-04-29	Re: "Jon's knowing Brandon is alive will cause major change" - this puzzles me. I cannot see it causing any change, they will go their separate ways (Jon will probably try to stop Brandon, but Brandon will still go) and that will be it. Can somebody elaborate on those major changes for me? I seriously think a Stark family reunion is the only positive thing that can come out of this northern plot fiasco, the siblings have not seen each other for such a long time now, they need a warm scene together.If Bran and Jon meet , and even if Jon finds out about Rickon, I don't see how it will change anything anyway.Jon can't do anything about either of them.Bran knows he is going into dangerous territory but that's not going to stop him.Jon has to stay at CB besides his obligations there, if they stop the Wilding invasion that makes things slightly better for Rickon.We won't see Osha and Rickon this year anyway, we still don't know what GRRM has in store for them.

2401	Charlie Hustle	2014-04-29	"Kill the Masters" written in plain English on the wall in Meereen was pretty silly IMO.
Because the viewer are English speaking viewers. If it were in another language we wouldn't have understood what was written. Without subs.
2402	Ingelheim	2014-04-29	Because the viewer are English speaking viewers. If it were in another language we wouldn't have understood what was written. Without subs.


Â 
...then put those subs. That's like "Hey they shouldn't be talking in High Valyrian, we don't understand them without the subs!"
2403	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-29	Â 
Thought the same thing. Even though Jon hasn't spent any of his adult life in the south, you would think working alongside NW from all around the Seven Kingdoms he would be able to spot an accent.
Â 
Locke is like someone with a Wisconsin accent claiming to be from Georgia.


Â 
The same thing bothered me (very mildly) too. I expected that Jon recognised Locke as a fellow Northerner and that Locke would present himself as such, even potentially as a former Bolton's vassal. Â 
Â 
The accents on the show are all over the place (Sam has a northern accent despite coming from Reach) and Locke spent some time in the South so I didn't get too bothered by it.Â
2404	Nami	2014-04-29	But shouldn't it be four guards at the time? And Marg flashes some boob and so gets entrance, but isn't that still a huge risk should the guard report anything back to Jaime or Cersei? And just some friendly words and some touches are enough for the guard? Or did she go full Cersei-whore on the guard? I think it cheapens her character a lot should she let a guard touch her just to open a door. And if he didn't get to touch her, what an incredible bad guard.


Â 

This is HBO

2405	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-29	What do you mean? The hint of irish in it? Maybe they speak like that in the fingers, I mean other characters have a bit of an english accent.
I thought Aiden Gillen was perfect. Fits Littlefinger so damn well. Dat grin.


Â 
I don't mind if Aiden kept an Irish (or any other accent) from the start and stayed wit it. It's the fact that his accent and the raspiness of his voice changes with every scene.Â

2417	Bowen	2014-04-29	You kind wonder how worse it can get?what about when Tywin is killed off,looking back to season one wich was flawless I reckon the acting seemed a lot better,mark Addy was my fav of the show,shaun Bean was mega as was some of the characters that are still about,it's like they've rested on their laurels or something.
One thing that bothers me is stupid none sensical plot changes like having Mel see Arya instead of Ghost of High heart,Jamie in KL isn't working out I'm afraid and the blatant D&D sledge hammer tactics of ramming things home is really bugging me,did anyone need to hear QoT and Littlefinger point out what happened at the PW?
Just how many of these has there been,if they do this with Jons mother before time I'll go ape shit,why can't they go back to how they did things in season one?
Has there been any professional critiques and what were they like?

Â 
But, D&D are sloppy when it comes to logic and continuity, they prefer out of the blue SHOCK to consistent characterization, they create and then ignore logic and plot holes...sometimes in the same scene. Â Their wholesale invented plots are not that good.

Which in turn better than the horrid season 2. (imo)
That said, if I'd known the show was gonna go down the privy so fast, I would've been much less critical of season 1, because in retrospect, it's a fucking masterpiece.
With Tywin â<U+0080><U+0094>who is (arguably) the most charismatic character/actorâ<U+0080><U+0094> and The Hound â<U+0080><U+0094>who is probably in the top 3 fan favoritesâ<U+0080><U+0094> gone, next season is going to be really tough.

2425	YoungGriff89	2014-04-29	On Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep/ The Mutineers:
Â 
Sam somewhat had Ghostâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trust (as had been pointed out earlier in the thread) so he may have been caged by Sam and hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been out since before the mutiny.Â  A stretch I know, but it is an explanation.Â  Karl sees value in keeping Ghost around since a giant direwolf would be a good weapon against the others.Â  The trap that Summer fell into wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily for another direwolf. Â Plus Bran was in Summerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mind when Summer hit the trap so that is technically Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s carelessness.Â 
Â 
What made me say â<U+0080><U+009C>wtfâ<U+0080><U+009D> was when Karl hinted towards a ransom?Â  To who?Â 
Â 
On the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King:
Â 
Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no indication the White Walker went as far as the Land of Always Winter with the baby.Â  North of the Wall encompasses a huge area (as George RR Martin says â<U+0080><U+009C>Probably the size of Canada).Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s possible he went somewhere much closer, the Frost Fangs for example (still a good ways from Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s but not nearly as far as the Land of Always Winter), and the White Walkers could have several hangouts.Â  Plus, as others have pointed out the White Walkers were really gentle and careful with the baby.Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s possible the white walker fed it and kept it alive for a four or five day journey.Â  They could have ridden non stop too, cutting the journey to two or three days. Â 
Â 
On top of that, the Fist of the First Men in the books is actually in the middle the Haunted Forest.Â  There would be trees close to it, in the show it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t portrayed as such so the geography beyond the wall could be quite different.Â  More barren and covered in snow, so Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keep could be closer to the edge of the Haunted Forest rather than in the middle of it.Â  Again, not an excellent explanation but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something. Â 
Â 
On Margaery:
Â 
Margaery is the same game player we saw in season two, but she just may not be as crafty as we originally thought.Â  What do I mean by that?Â  Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a difference between being crafty enough to know Renly and Loras were doing it (as if it was a secret anyway) and knowing that your grandmother was plotting to kill Joffrey.Â  Margaery as manipulative as she is she still in her third season doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t seem overly evil or genius. Â 
Â 
She wants power.Â  Opportunity in the Storm Lands pointed towards marrying her brotherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lover who happened to be a king.Â  When Littlefinger was there and it became possible to be betrothed to the bachelor King in the capital, she jumped on that opportunity.Â  She will do whatever it takes, if it means putting up with a husband who likes men or trying to appeal to a psycho and make the best of it.Â  Renly wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a real king and she wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really in any position to rule as queen anyway, when Joffrey died and the marriage wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t consummated she didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have any reason to assume she would just be marrying his younger brother. Â 
Â 
Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m rambling a little, I guess Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m saying I disagree with the idea that Margaery has been portrayed as dumbing down from season to season.Â  I think everything sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s done has been consistent with her season 2 and 3 portrayal.Â  As far as getting into Tommenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s room her family is allied with the guy who knows every secret passageway in Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing (Varys).Â  She didn't necessarily have to get past the guards. Â 
Â 
On Latin text in Mereen:
Â 
I imagine the Masters spoke the common tongue and it seems plausible the text was written in the common tongue to further taunt them before they were killed.Â  They know Dany was waiting outside their gates, but showing that the idea of rebellion had crept inside their walls?Â  Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an â<U+0080><U+009C>oh shitâ<U+0080><U+009D> moment.Â  The slaves didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily have to read it, it was meant to be seen by the Masters I think. Â 
Â 
Locke/ Stormlands/ overhearing Sam and Jon:
Â 
He said he was a game warden IN the Storm Lands, not that he was from there.Â  Being raised in Winterfell and being a bastard too I doubt Jon had too much interaction with Northerners who werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t his own family/ people of Winterfell.Â  Even if he did they were probably highborn, something Locke is not.Â  Maybe he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know the accents definitively enough to differentiate a northern lowborn from any other low born.Â  The wallâ<U+0080><U+0099>s full of low borns from all over Westeros, I imagine itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a challenge to keep accents straight anyway.Â 
Â 
All Locke would have found out from overhearing Jon and Sam is that Bran and Rickon were not at the wall (which he probably had figured out already).Â  He knew from Ramsay that Bran and Rickon were alive.
Â 
On Sam breaking his oath:
Â 
By this season Jon has learned: Â Ghost is (potentially) dead, his brother (Robb) is dead, The Old Bear is dead, his sisters are probably dead, Edmure spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and Alliser Thorne is acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Â I imagine Sam would have probably told Jon about Bran and Rickon being alive just so he could have some optimism. Â

Â 
Ghost HOWLING, why the fuck would you change that.
Â 
The rape of the Sacking of Mereen.
Â 
Of course they spoiled the books, its been said since the 1st rumours.
Â 
They will likely spoil book 6 7 and probably 8. Probably beofre Martin even gets book 6 out.
Â 
Martin has told the Duo how the book ends becuase he can't be fucked to hurry.
Â 
It will be a fuckin miracle if the series is done in 10 years.
2432	7th-key	2014-04-29	Hound says he doesn't steal; two episodes later he steals.
It is said that Tommen's room is heavily guarded; two minutes later Margaery sneaks in.
Are they doing that just to annoy us? Just shut up.
Â 
Â 


You all are talking like the mutineers at Crasters weren't rapists and killers in the books...


Â 
We know what would happen to Craster's wives. I don't remember how much it was described in the book. There is a difference between mentioning something (or letting the audience put 2 and 2 together), or dwelling upon with extended descriptions.
Â 

- Ghost being able to growl, I really miss that he isn't the silent brother


Â 
I think it was in the DVD commentaries, already in season one,Â  they made Ghost vocal because it works better on TV. The CGI wolf wouldn't look as menacing without sound.. or something like that. A shame for Ghost, but true because a lot of the effects depend on sound.Â 
Â 

Â 
It also kind of bothered me that Karl had such perfect teeth. Â I mean, I don't think there are any dentists in Westeros and his teeth were not only perfect, but shiny clean too. Â 


Â 
Meh, usually in TV fantasy they go with the clichA¨ bad guys = bad teeth.
2433	teemo	2014-04-29	It bothers me how old Tommen is. Â I know he was the younger, chubbier kid at one point when it didn't matter, but now he is too old to be so gosh darn cute.Â
2434	ladyinblack	2014-04-29	I don't understand why we're seeing so much of the White Walkers. It takes all the mystique out of them. Part of what makes the WW and the "Others" so scary is their obscurity. Also, Craster's sons get turned into White Walkers by getting tapped with a finger? That's all it takes?Â 


Maybe the nail art is key
2435	Ser Jaime the Humbled	2014-04-29	Meereen:
Even if that's how it's written in the books, the whole thing felt so easyÂ when seen on screen.These cities have been around for thousands of years and it'sÂ that easy to invade them?
"Kill the masters" looked super dumb. All I could think of was "Life of Brian"
Dany on top of the pyramid looked really cheap.Â 
King's Landing:
I find AG atrocious usually but he was alright last night. Almost S1-level (but then again, that's not saying much)
QoT: good riddance, her lines are about as subtle as Littlefinger's voice.
Jaime/Cersei: well we expected that from the whole "it was consensual" nonsense but Jaime being back to being a super nice guy felt especially jarring.
Tyrion bores me.
Wall/North
The guys at Craster's Keep are just painful to watch. How one-dimensionally evil can they be? Drinking out of Mormont's skull? Oh and let's throw in another rape scene for good measure, can never have enough of those eh?
Direwolves getting captured. Dumb.
Jon Snow's face.
The long horse ride leading up to the final scene looked absolutely fantastic but the Night King's [sic] looked like Picolo in Dragonball Evolution.
Also, WHERE IS VARYS?
Â

So you basically don't like the show.

Ahaaha. Im actually getting tired of seeing Dany in the same outfit to be honest. Hopefully next week (if shes featured), she gets a change of clothes. Arya's clothes make sense though. She seriously didnt change them until like...she gets to Braavos or something.Â Ok i think she changes them when at Acorn Hall but i think she changes back into the old clothes after that.Â 
As for Bran, maybe Meera had some packed away? /shrug
2439	acejack	2014-04-30	Bran not just warging one of the mutineers


Â 
No way he could accomplish that at this point. Bran was only able to take over Hodor because what's going on in his brain is like the game Pong.
Â 
Varamyr couldn't get control of Thistle and he was a lot more experienced at warging.
2440	Roose Seal	2014-04-30	So you basically don't like the show.


Nope, which is why i come in this nitpick withÂ impunityÂ thread.

2444	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-30	Nitpick with impunity guy


Â 
LOL, my thoughts, exactly.Â  The impunity segment of this thread seems to be in question a bit this week.Â
2445	Bori	2014-04-30	Ghost isnt silent in the show. That was established in season 1.


I think it was in the DVD commentaries, already in season one,Â  they made Ghost vocal because it works better on TV. The CGI wolf wouldn't look as menacing without sound.. or something like that. A shame for Ghost, but true because a lot of the effects depend on sound.

I can understand if they have to make Ghost growl from time to time, to look, well, scarry (however, I think a silent/quite threat is sometimes more frightening, see Roose Bolton). It's also OK, if Ghost howls in Jon's dream BECAUSE he is warged by Jon at that time. I think the only reason Ghost is normally silent in the books is to indicate for the readers/characters when Jon is warging him (probably after his "death").
But in this scene there was no definite reason for Ghost to howl. Not a single one.
2446	solidviper	2014-04-30	The worst part of this ep was the "Kill the Masters" thing. I also wish the white walkers were a bit scarier or something.Â
2447	Breaker of Ice	2014-04-30	The fact that Craster's Keep is only 60 miles from Castle Black. That's only 2 days ride/3-4 days march!!! The Night Watch is really a bunch of wussies. Weren't they all completely exhausted and needed a few days rest once they reached the Keep at the beginning of ACoK.Â 
Â 
Also Bran's wigÂ Â  


Exactly, Jon has been back for weeks, long enough for him to heal from his wounds.Â  In that time Bran and his crew have only gone 60 miles!Â
2448	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-30	Exactly, Jon has been back for weeks, long enough for him to heal from his wounds.Â  In that time Bran and his crew have only gone 60 miles!Â 


Â 
Well, to be fair: Bran has to be carried, Jojen is sick, we don't know how far is Craster's Keep from wherever Bran and co crossed the Wal, and it is not as if they have a GPS and follow a direct line. And they may had some weather days when they just stayed in camp.
Â 
Anyway, I still find it odd that Craster's would be that close to Castle Black.
2449	JesterX	2014-04-30	Not sure if someone pointed this out already but anyone notice in the Meereen scene, the Great Master had two guards with him and then when he saw the slaves coming after him all of a sudden the guards disappeared?
2450	JesterX	2014-04-30	The worst part of this ep was the "Kill the Masters" thing. I also wish the white walkers were a bit scarier or something.Â 


Â 
I actually prefer GRRM's rendition of the whitewalkers, where he describes them as being beautiful.Â  I think, giving what we know about them,Â THAT would make them even more creepier.Â  The show turned them into ugly things.
2451	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-30	Not sure if someone pointed this out already but anyone notice in the Meereen scene, the Great Master had two guards with him and then when he saw the slaves coming after him all of a sudden the guards disappeared?


Â 
I haven't noticed but my guess would be that the gurads are slaves themselves so they joined the mutineers.
2452	Hound's She-wolf	2014-04-30	Not sure if someone pointed this out already but anyone notice in the Meereen scene, the Great Master had two guards with him and then when he saw the slaves coming after him all of a sudden the guards disappeared?


Â 
They ran away. You could see them press themselves against the wall and slip away just as the slaves swarmed the master.
2453	Hound's She-wolf	2014-04-30	I couldn't stand how between a direwolf, a greenseer, a warg and a skilled huntress, not one of them could figure out how close they were to Craster's, Ghost and a White Walker. I mean, really, how did Summer not know that Ghost was right there?
Â 
And the Kill the masters. I know it's been mentioned a hundred times before, but how are illiterate slaves who barely speak the common tongue going to write that? Even Grey Worm needed reading lessons.
Â 
And the baby. So would have frozen to death before the White Walker ever so leisurely strolled into Ice Henge.

Don't like what they've done with Jamie,one minute he's in rape mode and the next he's like Bamby,in the books there's an obvious change in Jamie but at no point would one call him nice as such,I hope they don't skip the Edmure scene though nothing would surprise be now.
2455	Lee-Sensei	2014-04-30	Apparently, murders not Tyrion's style. The whitewashing continues.
2456	Ice_Specter	2014-04-30	The rape sequence was disgusting.
Yes, I understand they're getting raped, but after episode 3, couldn't they just imply the girls were being violated? Did we really need to see like 3 rapes going on at the same time? What the fuck is wrong with these writers?


Â 

  This made me laugh. But I feel the same way
2457	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-30	Apparently, murders not Tyrion's style. The whitewashing continues.


Ugh, yes, and that makes him such a bore compared to his book counterpart.
Â 
- "Kill the masters", as it's been pointed out, is ludicrous.
Â 
- Stuff North of the Wall is a mixed_bag for me: more gratuitous rape to fill the boob quota, 10 minutes of stupid douches insulting each other.. It wasn't as bad as it might have been, but still.
Â 
- Bran's hair.
Â 
- The Night's King, or whatever that was, looked a bit corny.

And, yes, I had the same thoughts about Diana Rigg, my ex boyfriend was IN LOVING LUST with her.Â  Not an old rerun of The Avengers was ever missed in our house.Â  I just had to admit, I had the same thoughts, Ms. Dormer has nothin on the young Lady Diana.Â  I loved The Avengers, by the way.Â  Even before I met my ex.Â  It was a fav show of one of my childhood friends.Â  The reruns, that was all we had back in my extreme youth, uhf reruns, not cable tv.Â  


Â 
Yeah, I just looked up pictures of young Diana Rigg. She was gorgeous. Also, she had Margaery's dimples, which is just plain awesome.
2459	ramla	2014-04-30	Everybody pretty much covered my Valid nit-picks. lol The thing that stuck out most was capturing Ghost and then them shoing Greywolf getting caught in the same trap. I guess to explain how Ghost could get caught... None of it makes sense however. It shouldn't be easy to catch a direwolf... Let alone 2. Keeping Ghost alive was also moronic. There's nothing they can do with him, save get thier throat ripped out if he gets loose... Which should be imeditatly. His jaws would crush those metaless bars IMO.
Â 
The part where Magaery sneaks into tommen's room. During Cersie and Jamies interaction, she tells him to place 4 guards on the "Soon to be Kings" bedroom. Jamie stationed 1... They inserted this in to explain it as if Her ability to sneak in was because there was 1 guard. However, why would the soon to be keing have one guard... AFTER his brother was assassinated!?

Â 
Obviously, Margaery is Jaq'uen Haqar in drag/disguise. Â 
Â 
Ghost is being kept alive because (1) the mutineers are pretty stupid, but cunning enough to keep some wolf meat alive for future starvation; though too stupid to feed and water their future snack so he won't die before they need him, (2)so that one of the Reeds, or Jon will free Ghost and he'll rip out the throats of the mutineers and maybe Locke too, (3) both.
Â 
What really jolted me out of my suspension of belief was the baby not freezing to death being left out in the woods, chest and hands and face exposed in below-freezing weather. Â The poor little guy should have been dead by the time the White Walker came for him.

You're right about Tyrion as well,in the books he has Symon Silvertongue killed because of a song about him,they've missed a trick here as it showed that he was very much cut out of the same mould as his father Tywin Lannister,to have him as a the storys "good guy"makes him quite boring and gos against GRRMs good people do bad things vice versa thing,seems there was a reveal of sorts when Tyrion says to Jamie that Sansa isn't a killer yet!

No one of importance, no. I remember Tyrion bashing some guy's head in with a pointed shield in Season 1, and some guys during Blackwater. But no named characters. Pretty sure they're saving that for later~

Â 
But in this scene there was no definite reason for Ghost to howl. Not a single one.

Right....

2467	eumaies	2014-05-01	Thanks god for this forum.Â  Reading the glowing reviews elsewhere on the internet for such drivel as Qarl-I-drink-from-a-freshly-scrubbed-skull was causing me to doubt my faith in humanity.Â  Glad it's not just me who recognizes how horrible the last 15 minutes of that episode was.Â  Man those bandits were IREDEEMABLY EVIL.Â  That's the kind of simplistic morality tale I'd expect from a show inspired by GRRM! oy vey.
Â 
D&D are pathetic when it comes to actual show-writing.Â  To be honest, I'm enjoying season 4 quite a bit, but it's basically because they're milking GRRM's best work and they can't completely screw it up.
Â 
The rest of the books, while fun to read, contain way too much random content which means D&D will have to improvise which means season 5+ are just going to be horrible.Â 
Â 
As has been said before, Season 1 was actually really good.Â  I can enjoy parts of the rest and I'm sure Season 4 will be fun.Â  But the ad hoc plotlines and writing are just embarassing.
Â 
It's a tangent, but people just can't seem to get that brilliant classic movies like Star Wars weren't just about some headline features or special effects.Â  They were about the little details that painted a picture of a believable alternate world.Â  They were the british imperial officers that told a tale of an empire in space bureacratic and clumsy and REAL.Â 
Â 
Craster's keep bandits and lots of other detail scenes and characters in GOT were an opportunity to paint the details of GRRM's world and portray real human characters in the morally grey universe GRRM portrayed.Â  Instead we get porno sex and skull-drinking wolf-torturers (because wolves can't drink friggin snow????)
Â 
So much to complain about, but it's all been said.Â  Thanks for existing, this corner of the internet.

2468	Raksha 2014	2014-05-01	I do worry that the quality of the TV series, such as it is (and there are many moments and scenes I've greatly enjoyed) might go downhill after this season, since AFFC and ADWD are not, in my opinion, as good as ASOS, and drag much more. Â There will have to be more D&D improvisation, as Eumales mentions, and that doesn't always come out so well. Â I just hope we don't eventually have Young Griff and Tyrion & JonCon traveling down the river with a boatload of topless prostitutes to fill up the 'boobage' quota.

I enjoyed the boat trip. Â Of course, there may not even be a Young Griff in the TV series.
2471	Bear Island	2014-05-01	- Ghost being captured.
I didn't even realise he was missing. He is far to smart to be captured, I don't buy it at all. And why on earth didn't they kill him?
- Jon knowing Bran is alive. A small change with the potention for endless repercussions. While I think and hope that Bran's party will escape before or while Jon's group attacks and there won't be any interaction, Sam telling Jon makes everything different. Also, shouldn't Bran be WAY beyond the keep by now?
- Speaking of distances, the WW getting to what is presumably the Heart of Winter so fast/
The books make it seem like it would be a HUGE journey from Crastor's Keep to the Heart of Winter, but it barely took any time at all, evidenced by the baby being alive. Even with the furs, the baby would be getting no warmth from the WW or his mount or the surroundings so the baby should have frozen to death long before the WW reached there. Those furs would never have kept a starving newborn human alive.
Â 
- Nothing about the Jaime rape. They should have inserted a scene between Cersei and Jaime to show that showed it either being okay between them to im[ply that ultimately Cersei considered it consensual, or had a scene between them where she was scared and upset and mentions it. You can't just throw rape into Jaime's redemption arc and act like it never happened.

No, but he's a murderer in the books. It's certainly something he was capable of before the Purple Wedding.
2473	Cas Stark	2014-05-01	Okay, I have to ask, what is wrong w/Bran's hair? Â People mentioned it last week, so I was trying to pay attention in the last episode, and I don't see the problem.
Â 
I also wasn't bothered by the baby scene....I had already figured the WW were doing something similar to Craster's sons, and since the WW are semi magical...I don't find it odd that the baby wouldn't freeze.
2474	solidviper	2014-05-01	Apparently, murders not Tyrion's style. The whitewashing continues.


Â 
Stay tuned. I think they're going to do a complete roller coaster ride with Tyrion. We're just about to hit the drop point.Â
2475	darksellsword	2014-05-01	I've re watched the scene with Margery and the Queen of Thorns . I understand how people are annoyed at Margaerys apparent innocenceÂ 
in regards to Joffrey's death while coming across as very scheming and savvy at other times in the story. I was thinking about it and cameÂ 
to the conclusion that even the most emotionally detached schemer or social climber might be taken aback by the fact their grandmother
had killed a king on their wedding day, especially if she had just assumed along with most people in kings landing that it was Tyrion.Â 
The kill the masters Â graffiti being in the common tongue was meant to have been the obvious work of an increasingly angry and disillusioned
greyworm.
2476	ground_control	2014-05-01	- Nothing about the Jaime rape.

You can't just throw rape into Jaime's redemption arc and act like it never happened.


You are right. Â Fortunately, there was no Jaime / Cersei rape scene, so acting like it never happened is appropriate. Â Seriously, the people making the show said it wasn't intended to be rape, so it's not unreasonable that the later episodes don't deal with it as such.
Â 
If you are looking for some sort evidence to show that Cersei was ok with what Jaime did, you could consider the fact that they don't mention it to be in line with it not meaning anything. Â Alternately, based on her behavior this episode (ignoring Jaime when he knocks, sounding bitchier than normal, brushing him away when he tries to get close to her), she's clearly upset about something. Â Whether it's with Jaime for what happened in the sept, with Jaime because he won't agree to kill Tyrion (and seems to be taking his side), or somebody else and he's just the "lucky" guy who gets to deal with her sh*t, or some combination isn't stated explicitly, but I'd feel safe going with all three.
Â 
To be honest, I do think that Cersei was worried about being caught, and I think she didn't want to have sex with Jaime because she was trying to use their relationship (as a whole, not just sex) as leverage to get him to kill Tyrion. Â I think that this episode continues to show that.
Â 
My personal belief is that Cersei wasn't upset by the physical act itself, but what it represented -- a loss of control over Jaime when she feels like she needs him the most.
2477	Bori	2014-05-01	Right....

Maybe you are right. He started howling BEFORE his brother got captured. Actually it makes some sense since one of the reasons wolf elicit a howl is to rally the pack together. But then it would seem he actually helped to lure his borther into a trap...
2478	WTFSalami	2014-05-01	While I agree completely with the idea of them keeping Ghost alive making no logical sense and is completely stupid, why does everybody think that the mutineers are the ones who held him down and built a cage for him?

I think you're totally wrong on this.Â  In the show (for some good reasons) they didn't do Shae like book-Shae and they're not going to end her in the same way either.Â  The baddest thing Tyrion is gonna do is get mad and do one rebellious little killing. It's fine, in the show he's a good guy.Â  And D&D have this show pretty neatly divided between the good guys and the reprobates.

That is actually a reasonable point.Â  They don't make it look that way, and the feeding makes it hard to intuit that conclusion.Â  I think they should've just had a starved wolf in a cage - if they had to cage them at all for their little pointless made for TV story arc.Â

Again, I agree. Ghost being here is such a stupid fucking plot point, but I also never got the impression that these idiot mutineers ever "captured" him. I just assumed that he was put in there for safety reasons, much like Grey Wind was caged up during the Red Wedding.
The part that I don't understand is why he wasn't treated the same way as Grey Wind was. Wasting food on an extra mouth makes no sense to me, because none of these guys can control him and they have no practical use for him. 
I would love to be in the writers room with D&D just so I could point out how fucking stupid and nonsensical their fan fiction is. 
We should have had a scene in episode 1 with Jon standing on top of the Wall and seeing Ghost running out from the woods towards the Wall and have the reunion then, and then Ghost could have accompanied him on this murder mission.
But that would have made too much sense for D&D.

2484	Cazzy	2014-05-01	I got the impression that karl was keeping ghost alive because he was arrogant enough to think that he could somehow train ghost and use him as a weapon.

... No. Thats a laaaarge stretch. Even at castle Black Ghost basically roamed free. Now all of a sudden they put him in a cage!? And i don't think Ghost would even be at Crasters. Snow wasn't there anymore. He would either be with jon, or out hunting in the wood.Â

2488	RoamingRonin	2014-05-01	I don't see any logical reason for Ghost to be alive (yet). Plot-wise, I'm speculating it's so that Jon can start warging. Bran will activate it or it will happen "naturally". Seems like the perfect time to showcase Jon's ability since his storyline is crossing with Bran's.Â 
Â 
It's overdue for the other Starks to warg unless the writers have decided Bran is the only one that can do it so as to keep his storyline special or something.
Â
2489	Slade7	2014-05-02	Who cares if jon wargs ghost??? It's kinda a lame superpower and I could do with less warging altogether . I could run through the woods behind my house holding a camera , record myself growling , put them together and upload it as "leaked nymeriA scene" and errrebody be like awwwhh shiz you see that new fuhtage? Season 5 daawg
2490	Ladywhiskers	2014-05-02	I think Jon might have put him in a cage for the night so he wouldn't be tempted to eat all Craster's pigs in the night. I'm worried about Ghost because I didn't actually see any sign of them giving him any food or water. How long has it been since Jon or Sam were there?
Â 
They are probably keeping Ghost as a kind of watchdog. He'll make noise if someone's out there he doesn't know, which is helpful for them for now. And then he'll starve and they won't have to worry about him. They're creeps and I hope he eats them all.
2491	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-02	Well "kill the masters" in English was absolutely ignorant
Bran ending up at Crasters... I'm not sure about that. I was surprised, but I can absolutely understand why they would do it. I'm just not sure they can pull it off. So far it was a little stupid. 
Ghost... While it's somewhat odd to keep the direwolf in a cage, admittedly the show must explain why Ghost didn't return to the Wall. 
Bran and the Reeds were kinda boring as always. 
Apart from the english text in Meereen, my other serious problem was the White Walker scene... so the White walkers actually have a civilized society with high ranked White walkers in fancy black dresses and the own Stonehenge and Mordor that met Queen Elsa. And how did the naked baby even survive the ride? The whole scene was completely ridiculous. 
And I missed Varys and Roose Bolton and Oberyn

IMO the Other protected him from the cold. They seem like they can control it.
2493	Bowen	2014-05-02	IMO the Other protected him from the cold. They seem like they can control it.Yep as scathing as I've been about the episode to have a scene with wights and go on about the baby dying of cold seems odd,maybe craster would have had the babes wrapped up more but it is fantasy after all.
2494	Addam of Hull	2014-05-02	I think Jon might have put him in a cage for the night so he wouldn't be tempted to eat all Craster's pigs in the night. I'm worried about Ghost because I didn't actually see any sign of them giving him any food or water. How long has it been since Jon or Sam were there?

It can't have been Jon.  Ghost went with him when he went ranging with Qhorin.  He ran off in the middle of their expedition which caused Qhorin to start with that weird speech about Wild Things and the like.
2495	ramla	2014-05-02	I think Jon might have put him in a cage for the night so he wouldn't be tempted to eat all Craster's pigs in the night. I'm worried about Ghost because I didn't actually see any sign of them giving him any food or water. How long has it been since Jon or Sam were there?

So you think they are using a Often Mute direwolf the size of a lion as an alarm? Also, they feed him. As they did in the last episode.
Also, when would Jon have caged him up? Ghost stayed by his side I believe up until he travels with Qhorin on the show... Ghost trots off on his own. In the books Jon sends Ghost away with instructions to go to Castle Black... Not Crasters. There is no scene with him saying go back to crasters.
Â 
This instance and the whole, Bran being close to Crasters make no sense. Also, If I have to speculate or guess aspects of a story that are not meant to be mysteries or intreguing... Then the story has problems.Â
2496	ramla	2014-05-02	Â 
IMO the Other protected him from the cold. They seem like they can control it.


There is no evidence of them adding heat, which is what they would need. The child was naked. When fat man, left him on that stone the cover came loose and his chest was bare. He would have froze coming from the Keep to that rock. It only seemed like the Night Kind had the power to change the baby. I can't see any of that being plausible.
2497	eumaies	2014-05-02	Again, I agree. Ghost being here is such a stupid fucking plot point, but I also never got the impression that these idiot mutineers ever "captured" him. I just assumed that he was put in there for safety reasons, much like Grey Wind was caged up during the Red Wedding.
The part that I don't understand is why he wasn't treated the same way as Grey Wind was. Wasting food on an extra mouth makes no sense to me, because none of these guys can control him and they have no practical use for him.
I would love to be in the writers room with D&D just so I could point out how fucking stupid and nonsensical their fan fiction is.
We should have had a scene in episode 1 with Jon standing on top of the Wall and seeing Ghost running out from the woods towards the Wall and have the reunion then, and then Ghost could have accompanied him on this murder mission.
But that would have made too much sense for D&D.


Yup.Â 
Â 
Another option would be to just ignore Ghost completely until after this season when he returns as part of Jon's decision regarding whether to take Stannis' offer.
Â 
Another sensible option would have been to have Ghost be free but haunting around Crasters and have the desserters be scared of him (some scene with Rast spotting him out of the corner of his eye or similar).Â  That would also justify them digging absurb pit-traps for Summer AND would give Bran a reason to have been attracted to Crasters in the first place. And ultimately it would allow Jon to find his wolf and/or Bran to warg his wolf as part of an escape in a later episode (they're going to have Bran warg hodor, by the way).Â  Of course, it's all to serve the silly side-plot, but it would at least be less embarassing to watch.
2498	gotgrrrl	2014-05-02	There is no evidence of them adding heat, which is what they would need. The child was naked.

Or maybe Craster's boys are immune to cold as Dany is to heat/fire.Â  Not sure I even believe this but it's a thought...
2499	Jehane	2014-10-02	The whole Meereen sequence really bothered me. I remember being very impressed with Dany's (and her advisers') plan to conquer Meereen, how much time it took to prepare etc. In the show it seemed ridiculously easy. The only thing I really liked about the Meereen sequence was that shot of Dany with the Targaryen banner behind her. Everything else was just... boring. And stupid. Why would any slave write "Kill all masters" in English when both the slaves and the masters clearly don't speak English? Argh. What also bothers me about the Meereen sequence is the knowledge that Dany won't go anywhere soon from there and that her storyline will deteriorate if the show sticks to the books. Also, where are her dragons? Are they hiding?
Â 
Also very annoying: Bran near Craster's resp. inside Craster's and revealing his identity. What the heck?
Â 
Annoying and boring as usual: Jon SnowÂ and his merry men. Never cared much for that storyline (neither when reading the books nor when watching the show), never will.
2500	shiola	2014-04-27	What did you love about this episode? Â From the smallest background detail to an obvious character moment, everything is fair game!

2502	Newstar	2014-04-27	I liked that the show through the White Walkers (well, Others) reveal spoiled the books in a big way, way bigger than with Jeyne/Talisa. Go big or go home, I say, and the show just threw the book fandom a huge bone. About time.
Â 
Speaking of potential spoilage, Tyrion's "Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway" followed by a Littlefinger/Sansa scene? YES, PLEASE.
Â 
The Jaime/Tyrion scene was great. Also, the callback to Tyrion wanting to name Jaime as his champion back at the Eyrie was a nice way of tying everything together.
Â 
Loved TV Sansa putting the pieces together so quickly. A vast improvement on the books, in my opinion.

Â 
The White Walker stuff at the end was beautiful and haunting and I can't wait to see it on a bigger screen on my re-watch.
Â 
I liked Jon telling Sam he knows what it feels like to leave someone you love. Â It's easy to forget Ygritte is his first girlfriend and the first person he's ever loved.
Â 
I LOVE the stuff with Bran!! Â Keeps me surprised and on the edge of my seat. Â
2504	shiola	2014-04-27	I liked Barristan talking some sense to Daenerys
2505	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-27	k. I have a lot to gush about.
Cuz really, i dont care how far out there from the books the episode was, it was gr9.
Â 
Meereen. All of it. Dany crucifying those guys finally happened and im like "YISS!"Â 
Barristan's face when Dany answered him with "I will answer justice with justice." He's heard that before and he all but says it. <3 Love it.
Targ flag. Hue.
Grey Worm being awesome. Im ok with Missandei/Grey Worm cuz its...not motivated by lust and desire. I dont know why people are against that cuz it shows that love can exist without sex. Grey Worm Love is the most honest love there is, dammit!
Â 
Tyrion and Jaime was ok cuz NCW is gr9.Â 
Cersei's losing her mind and im munchin' on popcorn.Â 
Jaime and Brienne's scene was yes. Pod!Â 
Bronn smacking Jaime with his gold hand was omg lol.
Â 
Sansa being really "Hey look, pal, i am not amused with your shit." was so wonderful! I loved that!Â 
Â 
Im not sure how i feel about the Bran stuff cuz its such a radical change. But i do love how Jojen is getting visibly weaker. Even my mum was like "whats wrong with him?"Â 
Jon being a complete badass was just yes. I mean ive been so Jon starved, i neeeeeeded his scenes! The Satin replacement is just an adorable little boy (whos likely a crackshot!) and im more than ok with it.Â 
Locke being the Bowen is ok with me too. Its a radical change but its one that can work.Â 
Â 
Craster's. Ok, what i actually liked about this is that it illustrates just how depraved those fuckers are. And that the Others are doing those babies a favor. Yeah i fucking said it. COME AT ME!Â 
Â 
Speaking of the Others, how about that Plot Bomb, guys!
2506	averde	2014-04-27	I've had problems with this season up until tonight. I loved this episode for so many reasons. It was really well done for both book readers and the show watchers.
It was as a standalone episode easily among my favorites ever. I can't point out a single scene that I as a book reader disagreed with and every scene had great aspects to it, not a boring moment. 
And Ser Pounce of course.

Grey Worm learning English was a cute scene.
The scene with Margaery and Tommen was one of the most stressful things to watch, in a good way. Like oh god I kept expecting her to just jump on the poor boy. Speaking of Tommen, very good actor for him! And Ser Pounce, who wouldn't be happy about that?
I really like all that stuff with Craster's Keep. And I like that they're adding to Bran's storyline, as it seriously needed some sort of filler to avoid completely catching up.
And everything Meera. So glad she's finally getting more lines.

2517	Nami	2014-04-27	I like all the episode minus the whole Bran getting to Craster's and getting captured.

Also didn't like how they ruined Jaime's character in the last episode. So now I couldn't really feel anything nice for him when he did a good deed by sending Brienne after Sansa.

Jaime worked well in all his scenes this week. Chemistry with Brienne felt as close to books as it ever has for me this episode.

2526	Seneti	2014-04-28	Alright, I actually took notes throughout the episode because there was so much stuff that I liked. Here's the list:
Â 
- Missandei + Grey Worm: they are just adorable together
- Barristan's look at Daenerys' "justice" line - he knows what's going to happen next and you can see his confidence shattering
- Bronn beating Jaime with his gold hand made me laugh so hard
- nice callback to Tyrion's time at the Eyrie
- Tyrion + Jaime in the cell - all of it, particularly "Sansa is not a killer. Not yet at least." Oh yeah!
- At the Wall: Slynt talking about LC elections. Foreshadowing anyone?
- Cersei and her wine XD
- the boar's head that Joffrey shot hanging on Tommen's wall - that must be the most creepy accessory of all times
- Ser Pounce is in 
- Jaime explaining where the swords came from
- Brienne "for lady Catelyn... and for you"
- Pod being adorkable
- Jaime's face when Brienne said "Oathkeeper" - NCW, you rock!
- Sam has told Jon about Bran - weird, non-canon, but totally in character (at least from my POV)
- epic Jon speech and I love Grenn, Edd and those three unnamed, red shirt brothers that stood up for him
- everything that happened at Craster's was properly...disturbing, particularly that poor girl being raped in the background all throughout the scene
- also, speaking of Craster's, the boar's head in Tommen's bedroom is now officially the second-creepiest prop
- "gift for the gods" sent shivers down my spine
- Bran and Co at Craster's... oh god, I hope nothing bad happens to Meera (see three lines above)
- and now we all know what is the White Walker edition of the birds and the bees *shudder*
2527	Newstar	2014-04-28	- Brienne "for lady Catelyn... and for you"
Â 
LOVED this, and loved Gwendoline Christie's acting: that quick, furtive glance at Jaime and moment of hesitation and struggle before she adds "And for you."
Â 
The clearly writers ship Jaime/Brienne pretty hard.

2528	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	- The huge Targ flag basically covering the Harpy. Awesome
Â 
- Olenna's line: "If I had to take another leisure stroll through these gardens I'd throw myself from a cliff" Can I say meta? And a neat little reference to poor dead Luthor

Â 
- Mormont's skull, as grim as it was. Made me really hate Karl and I can't wait for Snow to put a sword through his head.
Â 
- The Targaryen flag. As bad as that whole intro was, that shot was just awesome.
Â 
- The landscape of the White Walker territory. Very otherworldly.
2533	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	Everything. No, seriously. This could be my favourite GoT episode thus far.
Â 
Jaime's "I have one last gift", cut to Pod's big smile. "Ser... I mean M'lady."
The ominous Targaryen banner flying over Meereen. "White-washed"? Har!
Ser Pounce!
Locke befriending Jon, and his little joke about "protecting the realm".
The Other scene. I don't know how long I was holding my breath during that scene, but holy shit that was a treat! I know some book readers are going to complain that it's dabbling into new territory, but I appreciate the courage to head into waters that George has been delaying for too long.
I'll stop there for now, lest I ramble on about everything in the episode. Great job Bryan and Michelle!
2534	allie4645	2014-04-28	Grey Worm and Missandei are so friggin cute!
Â 
Is Marg's hair lighter? And can we all take a minute to cry about Olenna leaving?
Â 
And Jaime and Brienne broke my heart... but Pod being perfectly awkward made it better.Â 
Â 
And Darth Maul made a cameo. All good things. (Except for Olenna.Â   )
2535	Roose Seal	2014-04-28	The shot of the White Walker on the horse walking towards the great mountain thing was amazing. Most beautiful shot this show's done so far.
2536	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-28	A Valryan steel sword finally showing Damascus steel ripples.

I could be mistaken, but I believe Ice and Longclaw have them as well. Not sure about Widow's Wail, but the first two...
2537	Ghosteline	2014-04-28	*** Loved to see Ghost and his red eyes! He looks like a proper beast! I wonder how he ever got captured though.Â 
Â 
*** Lord Snow being all badass
Â 
*** Closeup of the Valyrian steel blade - great to see the details of the staff they are carrying around
Â 
*** Jamie and Brienne scenes were so intense. Great work by actors saying so much by not saying much at all.
Â 
*** Justice line by Dany - and if I picture her dressed up in red and black and being all fierce Targ... yehaa!
Â 
*** The end scene with silent background and nothing else but baby cry and horse steps. Creepy.
2538	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-28	Pacing and writing were the best yet this season. Sharp, to the point, no cringe worthy things like "Shae de faunny whure!" All the dialogue had something important and pushing the plot forward. The NW misfits are proving that Wildling, NW, Lannister, Stark whatever, some people are just bad people waiting for a chance for their own gains and power. Ending was kickass too.Â
2539	lostinasia	2014-04-28	Loved the idea of Summer waking up from Bran's control and thinking "Oh f*ck, what's the kid done to me now?!"
Â 
Liked Locke's cunning - last season he used the anti-highborn rhetoric against Jaime, and now he used it to try to gain Jon's trust. Really interesting how people's predictions here that he and Jon would get along are sort of comingÂ true.
Â 
Jaros Slynt (spelling?) proving to be somewhat intelligent and cunning, which is nice. Not just a cartoon villain.
Â 
Jon's continued improvement - whether it be acting changes, or the move from Iceland to Ireland, or a planned move from a more emo to a more charismatic Jon, whatever the cause, it's good to see.
Â 
Characters at the Wall being fleshed out more.
Â 
Queen of Thorns breaking the fourth wall and complaining about walking in the gardens all the time.
Â 
Loved loved loved that the show decided to bring the Others back in a bit more. I'm glad they're not going to disappear for multiple seasons.
Â 
Fairly clever exposition dumps/reminders: Cersei talking about Jaime's promise to Catelyn, for example.
Â 
Ser Pounce!
Â 
Margaery deciding, no, actually, I'll just kiss him on the forehead.
Â 
More darkness appearing in Dany's story: Grey Worm caring only about killing the masters, Dany crucifying 163 masters in a bit of gruesome detail.
Â 
So far I think this season's been fantastic.
2540	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-28	The look Barristan gave to Dany. He knows what will happen and he has witnessed it before.
Ser Pounce.
2541	kill alot26	2014-04-28	I was watching the episode then decided to look down and see how much was left and it was at the 46minute mark, this is the first episode where I was like whoa and got real into it. Then the ending of the episode was very interesting, overall though great stuff
2542	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	The look Barristan gave to Dany. He knows what will happen and he has witnessed it before.
Ser Pounce.


Â 
And Natalie Dormer. Never forget her.
Â 
Also, Dany's dark side in the show is kind of a surprise. I liked Jon's scenes too, and Locke being there.
Â 
Oh, and, IMO, Littlefinger and Sansa scene was pretty well done. The music was awesome.
2543	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	Direwolves! About time!
Â 
I've always loved the inseparableÂ bond between the Stark kids and their direwolves (especially Jon and Ghost) so Ghost seeminglyÂ not giving a flying toss about Jon in season 2/3 and being portrayed asÂ the NW guard dog always irritated me slightly. However, I'm really hoping we'll have more Jon/Ghost from now on. The wolvesÂ really do look great with the CGI and IÂ enjoyed Ghost growling and getting all snarky with his captor.
Â 
Give me Ghost over Drogon any day!
Â 
Props/symbolism
Â 
The Targaryen flag was a great touch. Dany is a Conqueror- Aegon with teats! I really got that impression in this scene with her looking over Mereen and the screams in the background...it was dark but mesmerizing.
Â 
Mormonts Skull...and I thought Robb got the medal for most disrespected corpse...Karl must die! But yeah that was pretty dark stuff but again, it leaves an impact on you.
Â 
The arrow through the boar head- Very nice touch! Reminding the audience of the scene where we realise Margaery can manipulate Joffrey....and now Tommen.
Â 
Crasters keep jon/Bran/Locke storyline
Â 
Â I guess I'm not a book purist because I'm loving this alteration. It's making the NW/North plot much more interesting and fleshing out the characters.
Â 
Jon is more admirable and whenÂ a certain something happensÂ it will be earned...and not mainlyÂ resulting from trickery. Kit is really nailing it with Jon this season!
Â 
Bran, Meera and Jojen are like the GoT version of the 'Golden Trio' from Harry Potter...their plot is more attention grabbing, making them more likable and noticeableÂ as characters.
Â 
I don't know what's going to happen which is a pleasant surprise. Will Locke spot Bran and try to kill him? Will Jon and Bran interact? I actually hope they do despite the book knowledge in me saying 'No!' I've always wanted a Stark reunion, even just very briefly. Especially with all the 'almost but not to be' ones and I don't think I can take another...I think that would piss allot of people off actually.
Â 
White Walkers 
Â 
This scene has given me much more faith in the involvement of the Others in the last two books. They aren't just one big anti-climax and I like how the show isn't letting them be forgotten.
Â 
Really loved this episode and so far Season 4 has been amazing!

2544	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	That Marg/Olenna scene was perfectly constructed and shot.Â 
Â 
The scene starts with full body shots of them walking. As we approach the main revelation the shot moves in closer and closer.... and closer until it is tightly cropped on their faces.
Â 
Finally see the Targ banner. I feel it has been sorely missed in the past, but it may been their way of signifying the Meereen Assylum is here... if that is their intent then OKish.
Â 
I liked the NW volunteer scene. Jon, Grenn, Ed, Locke and a couple of Red Shirts.
Â 
Also loved the Oathkeeper, Jaime/Bronn and Team Kingslayer Inc scenes.
2545	lostinasia	2014-04-28	That Marg/Olenna scene was perfectly constructed and shot.Â 
Â 
The scene starts with full body shots of them walking. As we approach the main revelation the shot moves in closer and closer.... and closer until it is tightly cropped on their faces.


Man I wish I were better at noticing moments like that - thanks. I think the only "filming" moment I picked up on was the vast distance between Jaime and Cersei when they're set on opposite sides of the room.
2546	The hairy bear	2014-04-28	I liked the way Pod was introduced into Brienne's storyline.
Â 
I liked Margaery's scenes with Olenna and with Tommen.
Â 
I liked the direction, in general. Lots of interesting shots and transations.
2547	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-28	Marg and Tommen. I find her teasing and suggestive advances towards this sexually naive teenager to be more amusing than playing tug-of-war with a nine-year-old's mother. That she's going to try and win him around by making him fall for her sounds a lot more interesting to me.
Â 
They didn't redeem that bullshit they pulled with Jaime last week, but at the very least he's back on the right track. Loved his scenes this time.
Â 
Lord Voldemort's brother at the end was pretty cool too.

2548	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-28	Favorite episode of the season so far! Â So good, so so good!
Â 
Everything Grey Worm and Missandi, but especially Grey Worm. Â The Dragon flag on top of the Harpy and Barristan's look when Dany said that line.Â 
Â 
King's Landing is never boring and it was great again. Highlights were Brienne and the subtle looks that GC gives her that convey so much. "Ser. ... My Lady" lol
Â 
QOT's training Margaery sort of a bookend to Tywin's taking Tommen under his wing. Â 
Â 
Ser Pounce! Â Loving the new Tommen as well.
Â 
Finally, the story at the Wall is really developing and it is being done really well. Â I like the added tension to that story that is there by having Locke there following Jon around. Â I'm also glad they are giving Bran a story and the tension that creates, especially with Summer and Ghost locked up.
Â 
The BIG reveal of what happens to Craster's sons. Â That last scene was absolutely amazing. Â I can't wait to get home from work and re-watch this episode tonight.
2549	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	Jaime and Brienne's scenes were perfect, especially the farewell. That cut from "I have one last gift" to Pod's big smile was brilliant.Â 
Â 
Brienne naming the sword Oathkeeper looked like it was the sweetest thing anyone had ever said to Jaime.
Â 
"Goodbye Brienne" - far out NCW, you're breaking my heart too!
2550	King Zee	2014-04-28	Â 
The scene with Margaery and Tommen was one of the most stressful things to watch, in a good way. Like oh god I kept expecting her to just jump on the poor boy. Speaking of Tommen, very good actor for him! And Ser Pounce, who wouldn't be happy about that?
Â 


Â 
Â 
his eyes were so damn big I was wondering if Natalie Dormer had flashed him in a bit of method acting.
2551	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	Bronn introducing us to the Jaime Golden Slap was great. I'm ok with him not being as shit at fighting as in te book, as the whole impact of that was ruined by the way they treated his talent pre-dehanding anyway. Can't wait to see Red Ronnet and any Frey get the next JGS Â<U+0099>
2552	Belisarius09	2014-04-28	I loved the look of disgust on Baristan's face when Dany tried to assert that revenge = justice.
Â 
I loved the cameo by set pounce. Â
2553	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	Margaery and Tommen scene was extremly good.
2554	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce
Ghost and Summer
Littlefinger's line about confusing enemies and Sansa's calling him on his bullshit
More info about the White Walkers
Shoutout to Jeor Mormont twice in one episode
Barristan getting flashbacks of Aerys II
Everything Jaime was in, loved how he was seated casually in Tyrion's cell
Brienne trying not to get emotional, Pod calling her Ser.
Â 
The whole episode, really.
2555	Roose Seal	2014-04-28	Gwendoline Christie did prove once again that, given good material (unlike in the PW episode), she was born to play this role. The subtleties in her facial expressions and speech idiosyncrasies are great to watch.
2556	Maria Underfoot	2014-04-28	Most of the actors have really stepped up their game.... NCW. What a handsome man..  and both he and GC spoke with their eyes. It was amazing.
Kit was also great.Â Good to see he kept up the good work.
Â 
I liked the one-liners a lot. Lannister bros and Bronn are very entertaining.
Â 
Dany white-washing was decreased this episode. Many unsullied were probably impressed with that obnoxious line of hers, but if you think about it, there's nothing just about becomingÂ theÂ people who you're punishing, andÂ murdering people indiscriminately, without trials or anything. Strategically it may have been a good action, as a demonstration of power, but it isn't just. Soo I'm starting to see the craze in there.
2557	Chebyshov	2014-04-28	The Brienne/Jaime scenes were so beautifully acted, and the jump cut to Pod was hilarious. Kit's acting has really stepped up this season (maybe because he actually has material that he can work with), so that was a delight to see. Loved the Grey Worm/Missande scene (we better get eunuch cuddles!). And of course, Olenna bitching about taking walks through the gardens of KL. I'll miss her snark.
2558	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	Gwendoline Christie did prove once again that, given good material (unlike in the PW episode), she was born to play this role. The subtleties in her facial expressions and speech idiosyncrasies are great to watch.


Â 
I thought GC did a great job in the PW scenes. The problem for me was those scenes themselves were just so out of place.
2559	Newstar	2014-04-28	Direction was excellent in this episode. Michelle MacLaren really knocked it out of the park.
2560	rocksniffer	2014-04-28	what did i love....everything...Â
2561	Milcov	2014-04-28	Jaime and Brienne were the pick of the bunch this week. One of the best episodes I can think of, not a single scene was bad or out of place, Sansa and Littlefinger nailing their lines too.
2562	Lasicka	2014-04-28	Jaime and BrienneÂ  
Â 
The puss that was promised
Â 
PodrickÂ´s face!!!!Â  Â PricelessÂ  Â
2563	northernmonkey	2014-04-28	I loved the way the episode was structured, and how it was split into 3 distinct parts.
Â 
Part 1: Meereen. It's always best to get Dany out of the way first. I generally like her storyline but I find when they end an episode with it it's a bit of a letdown.
Â 
Part 2: King's Landing (plus Sansa). Obviously brilliant as ever.
Â 
Part 3: The Wall. It was brilliant to get a prolonged section bringing all the 3 Wall storylines together.
Â 
This is definitely the best way to structure an episode. I don't like it when they try and flit between too many storylines and we end up with loads of brief unrelated scenes.Â
2564	Jacob Feybrad	2014-04-28	Darth Maul.
2565	StarkContrast	2014-04-28	I just loved that Janos Slynt who was well versed in politics from his days around the royal court was the one who saw through appearances and recognized Jon as a true talent and real threat.
2566	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-28	I just loved that Janos Slynt who was well versed in politics from his days around the royal court was the one who saw through appearances and recognized Jon as a true talent and real threat.


Â 
Well you don't get to be Commander of the Gold Cloaks without at least some ability!
2567	Dragonstoned	2014-04-28	Thought this episode was excellent tbf. Â Best bit was the implications for the books e.g. Jon knowing about Bran, and the Others obviously.
2568	NightStark	2014-04-28	I bet Tommen's actor was like 'Yes..kissing scene with Natalie  ...oh it's on the forehead  '
2569	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	I bet Tommen's actor was like 'Yes..kissing scene with Natalie  ...oh it's on the forehead  '


Â 
YouTube comments on that scene are funny as hell haha

					
					
							Edited by Ingelheim, 28 April 2014 - 02:14 PM.
2570	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-28	Sansa!!!! questioning Littlefinger. I loved seeing her savvy side come out. Finally, she is turning "from pawn to player!" I think that was my favorite part of this entire episode. Way to go D&D on her character development.
Â 
I loved the foreshadowing from Janos about Jon, as well. That was a nice touch, and proof that the show does contain foreshadowing to future events, for me.
Â 
The acting and directing in this episode was just superb. A job very well done.
2571	NymTargaryen	2014-04-28	Dany's hair - flawless. And that Aerys II look in her eyes (we already could catch a glimpse of in 1x06 when she says that "fire cannot kill a dragon") while speaking with Ser Barristan.Â 
Â 
Grey Worm speaking in Ghiscari! In general, the linguists working for this show did an amazing job bringing to life all the foreign languages!Â 
Â 
Am I the only one who gets a bad feeling seeing Locke? There's a certain menacing tone in the music when they show his face. I don't trust him a bit and I'm curious as how his character and the whole Jon arch will play out.
Â 
The editing was so good, I loved how they answered Tyrion's "Sansa's not a killer. Not yet anyway" with a shot of Sansa and LF. And after that LF's speech about "new friends" as a voice-over over the QoT and Margaery scene.
2572	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-28	I effin loved the Others. Overshadowed everything else for me.
Â 
But I loved the Castle Black scenes too.
Â 
Sansa starting toÂ become a player even before LF starts training her.
Â 
Jaime/ Brienne scenes (although I was a bit disappointed it wasn't Jaime who named Oathkeeper). Offering Podrick as a "gift" to BrienneÂ was priceless.
Â 
Tyrion's certainty Sansa didn't kill Joffrey and Sansa's certainty Tyrion didn't do it. Sweet marital loyalty.
Â 
Everything beyond the Wall, really.
Â 
It was an excellent episode, the best of the season by far.
2573	CrypticWeirwood	2014-04-28	Everything was marvellous â<U+0080><U+0094> really, really good. Â For all the naysaying I heard before I saw it, I was continually pleased, and in every single scene (well, Crastorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep was grisly, but we knew that).
Â 
What really impressed me was the moments of veiled joy that peeked out in the sweetness and caring between Grey Worm and Missy, Jaime and Tyrion, Jaime and Brienne; connubial Tyrion and Sansa sticking up for each other; the beneficent and sound advice of Ser Grandfather, alas unheeded though it proved.
Â 
And though I was a bit nervous Â how it might play out, Marge and Tommy actually looked competely wholesome, natural and cute. Â I love the new kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s smile, his late brotherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s antithesis.Â  The lad was afraid at first, but she warmed him and broke through his fear; sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s really good at that. Â Very fine acting there.
Â 
And Ser Pounce, how could anyone not just go awww? Â But I suspect Tommy is in for a surprise someday: Ser Pounce was a tortoiseshell kitty (with both black and orange/red fur intermingled), which means â<U+0080><U+009C>heâ<U+0080><U+009D> had to have two X chromosomes floating around. Â Unless â<U+0080><U+009C>heâ<U+0080><U+009D> had a Y chromosome to go with the two Xâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and make â<U+0080><U+009C>himâ<U+0080><U+009D> an actual he, there may well be new kittens someday exactly where Tommy least expects it. Â 
Â 
I hope for the best for little Tommen; perhaps he and Marge can have the Rock. Â Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lost so much already; I want him to make it.
Â 
I liked how Petyr subtly gave away his class (well, or at least his nonâ<U+0080><U+0093>Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing origin) with his pronunciation of aunt as /A¦nt/ rather than RP /É<U+0092>nt/ or ultra-posh /É<U+0094>Ënt/. Â No way would Tywin or Dany have said it how Little Peâ<U+0080><U+0094>er, Finger did.
Â 
Sansa wising up to him was impressive. You can see real growth in her.
Â 
The three Lannister siblings knowing just whose son perished, and not pretending anymore when it is just between a pair of them.
Â 
The music was just right: subtle yet meaningful. Â Watch it again, and notice the different themes that are played when.
Â 
Ghost and Summer, loyal and fierce. Â Can you ever see Summer growling at Bran the way Drogo hissy-cowed at Danny? Â Of course not! Â The difference between the respective bonds is the difference between an alien reptile and a furry cuddly companion. Â One I trust, the other I fear.
Â 
Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a strange swap, one of those flip-flop interlocking mirrors that George likes so much. The dragon which Â fire made flesh is ultimately cold in that reptilian way, whereas Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s northern direwolf is the very opposite of frozen ice, as warm as a summer day is long: truly Summer incarnate.
Â 
Ghost, Ghost, Ghost. Â So excellent to see him again, his haunting eyes all aglow. What a great reunion that will be for Jon!

2574	Angmar	2014-04-29	Great episode, much better than last ep.
Â 
Stuff with Brienne was awesome.
Â 
Jaime being pimp-slapped by his own hand.
Â 
Ser Pounce! Tommen's scenes are really turning out good.
Â 
Dany's crufixition thing. Call It morbid, but i was looking forward to it appearing on the show.
Â 
Ghost and Summer! Direwolves > Dragons any day of the week.
Â 
Jon in general.
Â 
Bran. I was so nervous at first, hoping none would get hurt...I really wanna see how it ends.
Â 
The Troll King and his reverse-Loki adoption thing at the end.
Â 
Seems like next ep is full of Stark goodness for everyone of the kids. Can't wait for it!

Â 
The puss that was promised
Â 
PodrickÂ´s face!!!!Â  Â PricelessÂ  Â 


Podricks face Â going from ear to ear grin to from in a second was awesome.
2577	SlowLoras	2014-04-29	- Jon's glorious curls, surely due to be upgraded to 'also starring' in the opening credits.
Â 
- Ser Pounce!!!!
Â 
- Actually that entire scene, though deeply uncomfortable, was brilliant. Shows howÂ similar Marge and Cersei are in terms of how they manipulate - they're all about the honey. (Tommen's actor played the wide-eyed 'omg a girl' thing beautifully)
Â 
- Brienne. Everything about Brienne, but especially "Ser...M'Lady"
Â 
- I actually don't dislike the changes to Jon & Bran's story - it gives Bran something to do other than wander 'n' warg, and gives Jon a chance to prove himself as being a capable leader of men.
Â 
- Darth Maul
Â 
- Did I mention Ser Pounce?
2578	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-29	Also the best directed episode of the season by a mile..


It is known.
2579	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-29	It is known.


Yes. The direction of this episode is among the best ive seen all series. The end scenes with Craster's and the Others really left an impact on me. So gooooood.

Â 
- Jon's glorious curls, surely due to be upgraded to 'also starring' in the opening credits.

Hnngh!  Kinda sad that Jon has had a shave too. I was really digging on that really scruffy beard he was rocking for a while there.
2580	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-29	Glad this topic exists.... there is a ton of hate within those other topics. Â I look at those others for the deeper insight and book connections I might have missed, but lately (this week in particular) it's just constant hate rants.
Â 
Loved the episode as a whole, but here are some things that stand out.
Â 
Grey Worm's confidence in motivating the slaves.
Grey Worm reaching out so subtly to touch Messandee
The Eyrie trial by combat call backÂ 
The dynamic and love between brothers
The Kingslayer Brothers
The Mockingbird and the Wolf
The Littlefinger scene closing with the Tyrell words
The Queen of Thorns farewell
Locke
Ser Pounce: the Cockblocker of the Red Keep
The entire Brienne/Jaime/Pod scene. Â The best scene of the entire episode. Â It was perfect.
More Locke
The Wolf POV. Â 
When Summer gets distracted from looking for the baby when he hears his brother howl. Â He runs toward his brother only to get trapped. Â Stunning and heartbreaking.
One stepping out of a line of 13.

This is why fandom cant have nice things. I think the end of this episode was a very Nice ThingÂ<U+0099>. Im a little tired of being angry at the fandoms im a part of.Â
2582	sj4iy	2014-04-29	Loved everything above the Wall, even better than the books (so far).
Â 
I liked Jaime and Brienne's scenes...the chemistry was perfect and so much was said with just looks.

This happens every season. Â Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s distressing, and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s childish, and it all seems to feed on itself growing hotter and hotter. Â Just say no.

2585	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-29	Â 
It happens in every fandom, it seems. Â I just don't get it myself.


Nearly every fandom, yeah. Its so ridiculous though. Some people enjoy peeing in other people's cheerios but come on, its getting old now. Some of the posts here about the show are just inane and horrible, spiteful nastiness. It makes me wonder why these people want to keep watching the show if they hate it so much.Â Still fun to laugh at their expense though.
2586	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-30	There's a thread over at IMDb, not too dissimilar to the "Unsullied" thread in the General forum, where they are laughing their asses off at the absurdity of the hate and the ridiculousness of many of the complaints bandied about at this forum (specifically the nitpick thread). And all I could think about when I saw it was: 'The posters atÂ IMDb, of all places, are laughing about these posts.'
Â 
Craziness. Besides, so much of the hate seems to be due to this kind of cognitive dissonance, where people just can't seem to separate the show from the book series, which leads to complaints being leveled against the show that simply don't make sense in the context of the show itself. It's understandable, I guess, but it's becoming pointless to even hang around this forum if you're looking to have good, interesting conversations about the show (in general, and even as an adaptation). Some of the complaints are just soÂ stupid. My main reason for posting anymore is simply to read and speculate on what's going to happen with the show going forward.Â 
Â 
Whatever...
Â 
On-topic: Loved the directing during the scene between Tommen and Margaery. The lighting gave it a very fire-and-ice visual palette.
Â 
Among a number of other things about the episode.Â
2587	SlowLoras	2014-04-30	Hnngh!  Kinda sad that Jon has had a shave too. I was really digging on that really scruffy beard he was rocking for a while there.


Â 
Have to agree with you. To paraphrase Lena Headley: 'men look good dirty'. And damn, does Jon look good with a bit of scruff.
Â 
One other thing I forgot to mention: I loved Brienne's armour. She looked classy as hell.
Â 
I don't think there's anything wrong with pointing out the things in the episode that didn't work for you, personally - and there are legitimate complains (like "why so much rape?")Â But sometimes the nitpick thread turns into a quagmire of "this show's gone to the dogs, they changed X from the books and now it's RUINED FOREVER" and just....can't we enjoy the show for what it is? It's 100x better than most of the crap on the tellybox.
2588	Frey Pies	2014-04-30	Honestly, this is the best show I've ever watched, and it's only gotten better this season. I don't get why people complain so much.
2589	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-01	This was one surprisingly good episode, in my humble opinion. I think they did awesome job on many of the characters and most of the scenes were as perfectly made as season 1 scenes.Â 
Â 
The highlights for me:Â 
- Camera shows Daenerys on top of Meereen with the Targaryen banner flung onto the harpy with the screams of the masters as background. So ruthless, so cold, so cruel, so awesome.Â 
- Jaime and Cersei scene
- Jaime and Brienne scene
- How they are building Sansa up
- How they are building Jon Snow up
- Brothers standing to join Jon Snow
Â 
I also liked:
- Tyrion and Jaime
- Bronn and Jaime
- Missandei and GreywormÂ 
- the slave revolt discussion scene
- introducing what's going on at Craster'sÂ
2590	Jehane	2014-10-02	Just watched the episode yesterday and loved:
- basically every scene with Jaime in it - Bronn & Jaime was very funny, Cersei & Jaime indicates a change in their relationship whereas Tyrion & Jaime resp. Brienne & Jaime were very touching scenes
- Marge with Tommen. She's just awesome 
- Queen of Thornes. Hate to see her leave
- Targaryen banner *yay*
- White Walkers. Very powerful scene.

2591	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-27	Stannis - Jon plot line offering him to be Jon Stark likely ruined....Or heavy changed.He would now know he cant accept cause it is his brothers lordship. And if Bran is alive, Rickon is likely to be.I dont see how Jon is having a conflict at all. Either Stannis offer wont happen, or wont be so hard for Jon.Also, Jon is now in the "Theon didnt do it" camp. If book Jon buddie with Stannis had this info he would likely share it with Stann.By the way I predict no farya, and a Battle of Ice for Rickon. What do you think of it?

2592	averde	2014-04-27	I don't know it depends how this whole Craster scenario plays out, maybe it'll end with Jon thinking Bran is dead or something. I can't see Jon letting Bran go deeper north willingly so their going to have to handle it all somehow. D&D hate Stannis anyway so I always assume any cool part of his story will get cut out anyway. 
I think the whole farya thing will play out because of the fact that D&D seem to be really into the whole Theon story and it wouldn't be really all that hard to introduce some girl as farya later on. They could even wait till Ramsays wedding for that matter.

Now he knows Theon didnt kill the boys. Fact.
2594	nothatso	2014-04-27	Maybe they'll have Locke come after Bran, and then have Bran use that to persuade Jon not to tell anyone he's alive. Stannis could then still offer Jon Winterfell even if his reasons for turning it down are different. Or what Averde said with Jon potentially thinking he's dead for some reason.
2595	nekrohsis	2014-04-27	I always thought it was contrived that Sam didn't tell Bran. The offer of Winterfell will still tempt him, especially if the Boltons are occupying it. Even if Jon knows Bran and Rickon live, he'll still be tempted to involve himself in the affairs of the North.Â

Meh, I could see a lot of the average show watchers not putting that together and the show not really mentioning Rickon again for a long, long, long time if ever. You bring up a great point and everything and I 100% agree with you, it's just I think it's somethiing that D&D might just gloss over.

2601	Pib_Juju	2014-04-27	I dunno-- I think they'll get out of Craster's well before the NW gets there, and Jon will still be left to assume that Bran is most likely dead-- just north of the wall and dead, instead of in Winterfell and dead.
2602	Lord Damian	2014-04-27	Bran and company will escape during the battle and free ghost. I bet Summer and Ghost join the fight against the deserters and that is as close as Jon and Bran will get. Me thinks anyway.
2603	Gannicus	2014-04-27	I think there is still a chance their paths don't cross. I just don't see a reunion between the two next week. Then even if he knows Theon didn't do it, it would be a lot for Jon to assume Bran would survive winter beyond the wall.
2604	Ty K	2014-04-27	He already thought to himself that it wasn't fair because Sansa was still alive, I don't think this changes anything.
2605	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-27	I guess they will change the reasons for Jon not accepting but he won't tell Stannis why. Maybe Bran here asks Jon not to tell, and that he must leave and go North because he knows how to defeat the Others. Then, Jon realises that Bran might never return or that it will take him so long. So, it's like for now, they're dead and can't return to reclaim Winterfel. And they don't know where Rickon is.
Â 
I don't mind the changes so far but it's like they're trying to distance themselves for certain details while they will have the same end. It's the details what explains the end, and that's why many things feel fucked up.
2606	Slurktan	2014-04-27	One interesting possible thread here is Locke. Â It's kind of weird in ADWD that Ramsey has a particular hard on for Jon with that letter. Â Could the show be setting up a reason for that hate with a potential Jon killing Locke and sending his head to the dreadfort as LC?
2607	ohpooratlas	2014-04-27	I think it's highly possible that even if Jon and Bran do meet (and let's be honest, that would be quite an emotional and cathartic moment for show and book readers) ... Bran and Jojen would still tell Jon that Bran can't go back with him. There's the bigger picture to think about.
Â 
But who knows? It really depends on how it all plays out.
Â 
I'm okay with this change for the time being.

2612	metr0man	2014-04-28	I hope Jon actually meets and talks with Bran. I got tired of GRRMs snail pace long ago. I want interactions between characters I like!
Also remember this is a seven season show most likely. So whatever happens in S6 needs buildup. I can imagine Jon wanting to go after Bran eventually and having a big battle with the Others.
2613	TheBadboy	2014-04-28	This show left logic and plausibility behind long ago. I doubt him knowing about Bran will change anything.

I think they are handling the north plot better than the books till now. 
Seriously a best friend promise to a dead Wight not to tell Jon that his crippled brother was alive seemed like a really easy way GRRM took out just to make sure the Starks are isolated. 
Plus Bran has always been the most illogical one. Not remembering who pushed him out of the window was again an easy way out that Martin took.

Jon's always been kind of bad at looking at the big picture though...


???Â  One of the reasons Jon stays in the Night's Watch is because he believes in the big picture.Â  He understood the use of the wildlings in defending the realm and also understood the need to secure funds from the Iron Bank to feed the Watch.Â  Jon is probably the only man of the Night's Watch left at the Wall at the end of Dance that sees the big picture.

Â 
He does there but he loses sight of it quite a few times. Â For one helping Stannis only prolongs the war which probably isn't too good for the big picture. Â Sending a bunch of people to hardhome wasn't too bright since they'll be of much more use on the wall (and then trying to lead an even bigger expedition there once he's learned that everything is far worse than he expected is sheer stupidity). Â
2618	ambi76	2014-04-28	Well, now Jon will have even more of a reason to say no, when Stannis offers him Winterfell. (Unsullied would have flipped out and called Jon a dumbass or something.)
2619	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-28	Bran convincing Jon to let him go and keep his survival a secret, I can see that. Bran not telling him where Rickon is and that information not being offered up when Stannis is communicating with the Northern Lords and wanting to make Jon Snow, still quite stupid.
2620	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-28	Everything happening at or near the Wall in this episode has me reeling. What in the ice blue hell has happened to the story now ?
Â 
Jon knowing Bran is something other than dead is HUGE. And they just casually toss it off in a conversation between Jon and Sam , that Jon was already told ! What was that conversation like:Â  "Hey pass the salt, oh by the way, Bran Stark [heir to Robb's crown and your only non-Sansa kin left] is alive and headed north of the Wall."Â 
Â 
I mean, I can see Roose wringing this info out of Ramsay who squeezed it out of Theon, but they only knew the boys were alive, not where.Â 
Â 
And now Locke shows up at the Wall ? First of all, holy crap - Locke at the Wall is bad enough news. (I had hoped he'd be headed for some eventual conflict with Brienne, replacing Shagwell.)
Â 
On top of that, Sam and Jon happen to be discussing that very Bran issue when guess who shows up at the edge of the room.
Â 
And oh, Bran and friends also got captured by the deserters, and both their direwolves somehow too. And Bran tells them who he is, even though this makes it the second time he's been held hostage by NW deserters now.
Jojen - no greensight about this, bro?
2621	The Anti-Targ	2014-04-28	Butterfly effect? We're in full on tornado territory here. Dumb move I reckon. Why not have the episode set up with Jon going to Crasters not knowing that Bran is still alive, and just before Jon gets to Crasters Bran Wargs into Hodor they make good their escape (killing most of the deserters in the process) and Jon arrives just after Bran and co disappear from sight. Better dramatic tension in general than Having Jon know about Bran.
Â 
Of course they needed to give Locke something to do other than hang out as Castle Black with nothing to do and eventually wind up empty handed. That's far more important for the overall progress of the story than fundamentally changing the dynamics of Jon's character Arc. Maybe Locke is really the 2nd head of the Dragon, not Jon.
Â 
Well they also needed to give Bran something to do. They've caught up to aDWD with Bran's story line, while mostly everyone else's is still hanging around in ASoS. Perhaps by the end of this season Bran will encounter cold hands and next season most plot lines will have caught up with Bran.

					
					
							Edited by The Anti-Targ, 28 April 2014 - 03:07 AM.
2622	Bear Island	2014-04-28	At first I thought that it was likely they would just miss crossing paths, like they did earlier in the story. However, with Summer trapped and Hodor shackled that kind of eliminates the possibility of Bran warging them to kill off the mutineers so they can leave before Jon arrives.
I have a kind of crackpot theory that Coldhands will show up and free them and they'll leave together with all of the mutineers dead just before Jon and his party arrive.That way Coldhands could be introduced and Jon wouldn't have to know Bran was still alive, which preserves the Stannis plot.
I can't help but think that if D&D are happy to change the timeline significantly, it means they have an endgame in mind and they know what sideplots will and will not figure into the bigger picture. That said, they do seem to like neglecting Stannis so it wouldn't shock me if they massively change this so Davos can head off on the quest to find Rickon sooner and they can cut out the Jon Stark bargaining chip.
I suppose it's not such a huge plot point, since Jon rejects the offer.

Â 
It was obvious he was never going to truly betray the watch and stay with Ygritte, but I still liked the story line (books not TV). There are so few characters who do something for the common good that I will take whatever I can get. It was cool to see Jon decline the power and status of a Stark to remain and fight the white walkers.Â

They could even wait till Ramsays wedding for that matter.Anyone else think Ramsay's girlfriend will play "fArya"?
As for the OP there are certainly some big changes going on. But I actually like that because it means that even though I have read the books, more than once, and discussed them here a lot as well, I still have no clue what will happen on TV. I like being surprised.
So Jon knows about Bran, and clearly at Craster's is when he will be reunited with Ghost. He also had Locke with him, whose actual mission is to kill Jon on behalf of Bolton.
So my guess is they are compressing Jon's heroism defending the wall and his building popularity there with hints of the later mutiny against him. The fight at Craster's will lead directly to him being made Lord Commander, and ther will be no first wildling attack where Ygritte gets killed as in the books.
Instead, there will only be one wildling attack, and it will also be the one where Stannis makes his surprise attack from behind. His selection as Lord Commander will most likely happen then before Stannis arrives.
I am also pretty excited that this TV scenario means we will se Jon meet Meera and Jojen. That hasn't happened in the books.

Will Jonn do some sort of hostage rescue mission when he finds out Bran is captured? Or will Bran escape and then Jon comes too late. Bran takes Summer and Ghost with him north?

Shiiieeeet, this is a lot different from the books, but I'm not saying it's negative. I like the show-twist. Yep!
2627	JesterX	2014-04-28	Speaking of Locke, wasn't he established as a LORD when he was first introduced?Â  I got the feeling he was one of Roose's bannermen.Â  This season, they have him as a sellsword type.
Â 
And also, forget what Roose promised him.Â  Once he takes the oath, he's completely screwed.Â  Even if he succeeds in retrieving Bran, he can't ever leave the NW.

2628	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-28	I don't remember him ever being referred to as a Lord in any way. I'm sure the 'Warden of the North' can easily pardon one NW deserter.

2630	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	I think Jon and Bran will briefly interact...just spot each other, really.
Â 
Jon will probably give Bran the chance to escape, telling him to get away from the 'danger zone' and then Bran will be on his way North again....and Jon will be upset because he could have stopped him but was too distracted.
Â 
Although, Karl and the mutineers know Bran is Jon's brother so could they use him against Jon? Also, Locke will be there!?
Â 
I dismissed the chances ofÂ Jon becoming lord of WinterfellÂ or King in the North when Robb's Will scene was ruled out so I'm not too bothered by the legitimacy problems this poses.
2631	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	Speaking of Locke, wasn't he established as a LORD when he was first introduced?Â  I got the feeling he was one of Roose's bannermen.Â  This season, they have him as a sellsword type.

2632	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-28	You may be right on the My Lord...but since everybody and their brother is referred to as M'Lord or My Lord by any underlings/lower births I probably ignored it. he obviously isn't that important since Roose is offering him a holdfast for his work. Implying he doesn't already have one.
Â 
As far as precedent? Seriously? How about precedents for murdering people at weddings under the protection of guest right...or for bastard kings born of twincest...or the precedent for relieving a kingsguard of his duty?

Â 
Come to think of it, Locke was flying Roose's banner when they captured Jaime and Brienne, so you might be right.Â  It seems he would've had his own banner if he was a true lord.

2641	Belisarius09	2014-04-28	Normally I like the new stuff the show adds. Â Those extra Robert Baratheon scenes, or Tywin and Arya in Harrenhall, I thought they were great. Â And whats more, they didn't have a huge butterfly effect.
Â 
I don't like when the show changes things for no reason, like Stannis and the "Infidel" line. Â I'm not sure how I feel about these changes for Bran. Â Obviously his story line is running out of material. Â So they needed to add something to keep him in the story much like they added the Theon torture scenes. Â The difference is the Theon torture scenes ACTUALLY HAPPENED, and Robert's conversations likely could have happened. Â 
Â 
Bran getting captured... could have a huge butterfly effect. Â But they could spin it so it doesn't so much. Â If Bran can escape before Jon arrives they can mitigate the effect...
2642	The Taxman	2014-04-28	Am I the only one that think they are doing this because they want to introduce the R+L= J bomb by bringing in the Reed/Howland shit?Â
2643	Terere	2014-04-28	If they meet, Jon's parentage will be revealed.
Â 
I do not think they will meet. Coldhands will probably get to Crastor's before Jon.
2644	benalapin	2014-04-28	I think it's best of Jon and Bran narrowly miss each other, but it might be too similar to what happened last season and might appear tedious. I'm not sure if they've cast Coldhands, but if they have, he could swoop in and rescue Bran and the deserters could say Bran was taken by the White Walkers. This could add a nice twist to the "narrowly missing each other scenario", and gives Jon the chance to properly mourn the loss of a brother, because we didn't see him mourning on screen for Robb.
2645	Hath4	2014-04-28	the Bolton's have a pretty low opinion of the nights watch, in the pink letter ramsay pretty much threaten to flay them all if they did not meet his demands. they could care less about vows, Locke will be fine if he gets back to them, but I do not think that will happen.
2646	TheBadboy	2014-04-28	Why can't we have a Bran - Jon reunion... 
I mean Jon might be forced / coerced to let Bran go. 
Possible things 
1. Locke is there. Tries to kill Bran. Makes Jon realise that Bran isn't safe even at the Wall. 
2. Bran convinces him to let him,  saying that is his destiny and stuff and tells him about his visions and warging and magical abilities. 
( The Bran visions also included the white walker ritual from last episode) 
3. Makes Jon realise that he is imperial against the fight with others. 
4. Wilding attack on the wall is nearing,  so Bran tells Jon to concentrate on that. 
5. Tells him about Rickon and asks him to go save/find him instead of Bran. And then tells that another Stark is alive if anything happens to him. 
Please Jon - Bran reunion '!!!!!
And it won't change things either. 
I can't believe how anyone can be against a Stark Reunion. Why!

2647	History of Westeros	2014-04-28	Â 
TheyÂ DEFINITELY referred to him as "My Lord".Â  I have all the episodes.
Â 
There's NEVER been a precedent for a NW deserter being pardoned and I'm pretty sure only a Lord Commander has that power, notÂ any warden of the north or even the king.


Â 
Robb claimed he had the power to release someone from NW vows (Jon, when he allegedly named him his heir).
Â 
"my lord" is just a manner of speaking. Â People who are not proper lords are referred in that manner quite frequently. Â Tyrion and Varys for example. Â Sandor is constantly mistaken for a knight and called "ser". Â This shouldn't be taken to have deeper meaning.
2648	jarl the climber	2014-04-28	Speaking of Locke, wasn't he established as a LORD when he was first introduced?Â  I got the feeling he was one of Roose's bannermen.Â  This season, they have him as a sellsword type.
Â 
And also, forget what Roose promised him.Â  Once he takes the oath, he's completely screwed.Â  Even if he succeeds in retrieving Bran, he can't ever leave the NW.
Â 
I really think this storyline is completely screwed up.


I'm not sure what Lockes background is supposed to be. You figure Jon could tell that he was northerner. I'm not sure what happens with him, maybe he sees a White Walker and shits his pants. It would sort of be interesting if Jon won him over to an extent, if Locke saw him as someone who Roose needed to command the Wall and that knocking him off could really rock the boat and have dire consequences. Probably it won't pan out that way,Â
2649	RoamingRonin	2014-04-28	Bran has to have something to do. Jon has to have something to do. Combine their needs and boom - plot, conflict. Nothing changes the story. Jon's not deserting just to save Bran. Chances are he'll reach Craster's just as Bran is leaving, they'll glimpse each other and do some cheesy half-smile and go their separate ways.
Â 
I just don't like how Ghost is caged? How long has it been in show time? Has someone been feeding him, walking him?

I guess, but then I assume we won't have Jon being tempted to become the lord of winterfell by stannis, since he knows his brother(s) are alive...


Â 
Yes, probably. It changes Jon's characterisation a bit, but since he refuses anyway it doesn't change the storyline. That's what they seem to be doing in general anyway, tweak the characters but put them in the same major events as the books.
2651	The Taxman	2014-04-28	Bran has to have something to do. Jon has to have something to do. Combine their needs and boom - plot, conflict. Nothing changes the story.

Â 
The fact that Jon knows Bran is alive has already fucked up the Stannis/Jon scenes. D&D are retarded if they managed to screw that up somehow...Â
2652	cybobbie	2014-04-28	I still hope that they miss each other somehow, before the fight or during it, because I simply don't like the idea of them meeting at all. Jon already knows that he is alive what is a big change, so to consider that they meet and that Bran will have to escape Locke and also convince Jon that he had to keep going north is too much for me.
2653	The Taxman	2014-04-28	Â 
Yes, probably. It changes Jon's characterisation a bit, but since he refuses anyway it doesn't change the storyline. That's what they seem to be doing in general anyway, tweak the characters but put them in the same major events as the books.


Â 
That's a major major major tweak. It's a lot more powerful that Jon denies all lordship and remains a bastard at the NW believing that he is the last Stark than denying knowing Bran is still alive... like no shit. Nobody would accept your bastard ass if you tried to claim the North.
2654	Hippocras	2014-04-28	I could see Bran warging Hodor again maybe, to free Ghost.

Â 
It's not a huge thing, but it was kind of a defining moment for him...he is offered what he has secretly wanted all of his life...yet he rejects it in the end.
Â

It changes the scene as you know it. The scene hasn't even happened yet and you're already devastated.Â
2657	Hippocras	2014-04-28	yeah, I think people get a tad overdramatic about any changes.
Â 
I am very glad the show is different from the books, otherwise I would not need to watch it.

He still refuses the offer inspite of all the glory that comes with it. Because just like Stannis he may be a tad bit honorable and refuses because he can't betray his brother like that. Just like Robert - Stannis. Duty!  
In fact it enhances Jon - Stannis dynamics making him Respect Jon more seeing how he refuses glory for duty. 
But then again Stannis fans just cry out about everything and anything that is happening.  So can't argue with them

No you're not alone that bothered me too. Why they would keep Ghost alive and how they managed to capture it and also, that cage, at least IMO, was not good enough to hold a direwolf.
2660	Tadco26	2014-04-28	It's hard to say how much it will change things going forward, you just have to wonder what the benefit of the change was?Â  It is also pretty lame to not have Sam and Jon's initial conversation about Bran being aliveÂ on screen, when you are now inventing new scenes to give Jon something to do.Â  Â Of courseÂ Jon knowing about Bran, not ultimately changingÂ much,Â wouldn't be the first time the show changed something and then preceeded as if the change didn't matter or didn't even happen.Â  I find it more ridiculous that the mutineers were able to capture Ghost, and then after capturing him decided to keep him alive... for what purpose?

They set snares. The show even showed it. Summer was captured too.

Give it some time. 
Remember when Sam didn't make the promise and yet we thought how can Sam not tell Jon about Bran. 
Turns out he had already told. 
They will definitely show why Karl has kept Ghost alive. 
Maybe as a Gaurd dog or something. 
You just can't expect them to tell you everything in one episode.

Because there would never be any "decision" in the first place, Jon would never be tempted to usurp his brother's birthright, he would never struggle with the decision of whether or not he should steal winterfell from Bran. Â

Bran is still alive. He would respect Jon more if Jon declined with the precedent that Bran and Rickon are dead.Â

2667	Gogossos	2014-04-28	Even in the books, Jon's escape from the wildlings was aided by Summer and in ADWD, in Jon's wolf dream Ghost senses that Summer is north of the Wall. Jon has always known that Bran is alive and kept that secret secret, for good reason.Â

That would be a good thing IMO. The whole thing as described in the books wasn't a real tempation at all. Even Jon the doofus should've known nobody in the north would back his claim if he had gotten out of the NW by claiming that the Old Gods didn't exist and then burning the Winterfell weirwood.

Because Stannis did his duty in his older brother's rule. And took what he gave because it was his duty!
Jon has a chance to glory but being honorable as he knows the true born Starks are alive and bound by his duty he refuses.
Simple and powerful.

2671	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	TheÂ 'almost Stark reunions' are basically the writers dangling a string and going "here kitty, kitty!" only to pull the string away at theÂ last minute. The kitty (watchers) enjoys being toyed with at first but soon it becomes too much and theyÂ get pissed. Â 
Â 
Over doing the 'almost Stark reunions' will have the same effect. We all long for a Stark reunion, book readers can sacrifice this for the development of the story but show only watchers (unsullied)Â will see this as pointless and get frustrated.
Â 
Lets look at the history of 'almost Stark reunions' so far-
Â 
Robb/Jon (season 1)- I hadn't read the books at this point and was pretty excited when I though Jon was going to meet up with Robb and was curious toÂ how this would play out especially with dodging the whole 'cutting off your brothers head for deserting' thing. Part of me was really annoyed when Jon retuned to the NW...however, after reading the books and seeing how his story developed I can appreciate this now. Although, there is still a part of me that wonders how Jon being with Robb would have worked out.
	Arya/Robb/Catelyn- This added to the tragedy and drama of the RW so this was good. Also, itÂ was better for Arya not to reunite with them.
	Jon/Bran (season 3)- This was frustrating as they were sooo close and then they go their separate ways....again.
Season 4 also has the lingering idea that Arya/Sansa/Hound will reunite at the Errie. My unsullied friend alreadyÂ thinks the Hound willÂ become Arya and Sansa's protectorÂ as they take back the North.....we all know how this one ends. Â Â 
Â 
Basically, I don't think aÂ brief Stark reunion is a bad idea. Having a near miss again is though. Especially repeating the Jon/Bran one.
Â 
HowÂ a Jon/Bran interaction at Crasters could work-
Â 
Jon helps Bran escape, not having anytime to talk amongst the chaos, he just wants his little brother and friends out of the 'danger zone.' However, Bran and companions do get away but continue North much to Jon's dismay (who was too distracted to do anything other than make sure they got away from the mutineers). At this point Jon registers Bran as 'missing' and most likely dead, blaming himself for not stopping him when he had the chance.

It changes the scene as you know it. The scene hasn't even happened yet and you're already devastated.Â 

This, precicely.  I think the Jon Stark subplot can still work.  If Stannis legitimizes Jon, then he is ahead of Bran and Rickon in the line of succession in any case.  The temptation will still be there.
2673	TheBadboy	2014-04-28	Stannis and Jaime.
Please kill them next book Martin because those are the ones that are creating the most noise. 
Ohh Stannis won't do this. 
Damn they ruined Jaime. 
Shit what was scene with Jaime for? 
Ohh I hate Tv Stannis!  
Damn stop being such tight ass purists 
And I always thought Dany had irritating most irritating fantasy,  but I guess I was wrong
And I really like Stannis and Jaime. I hate to see them butchered by fans rather than creators of show

2674	Tankbuster	2014-04-28	Oh yes, it is the character's fault that the showrunners have made them into such drab mockeries of themselves, better kill them quick.
2675	Natalia Borgia	2014-04-28	I don't have HBO so I rely on the HBO behind the scenes and the recaps here. So Sam told Jon Bran is alive and skipping along the yellow brick road beyond the wall...Â 
Â 
AS soon as I saw show Stannis I was convinced D and D must hate him. He won't be nice to bastard Snow.
2676	RoamingRonin	2014-04-28	This reminds me of how they changed Jon's motives for "joining" the wildlings in season two. The show handled it better than the books so I have faith in this change as well.Â
2677	SeventySeven	2014-04-28	Â 
It's not a huge thing, but it was kind of a defining moment for him...he is offered what he has secretly wanted all of his life...yet he rejects it in the end.
Â 
I must be the only person who thought Ghost being captured was RIDICULOUS!!!!!! Â LOL, and the depraved Craster's rapist mutineers are going to keep the direwolf alive? Â WTF.


Â 
Yes I know, and in terms of characterisation it's a defining moment for Jon, but what I meant is that they're not really following book!canon characterisation anyway. After they turned Jaime into a rapist I've finally given up on expecting the show to stick to the way the characters are in the books... Obviously that's not going to stop me from complaining about it, but in terms of storyline it remains unchanged if Jon is never offered Winterfell.
Â 
Btw, IIRC in the books doesn't he also refuse because of Sansa? I'm unsure about this, but I vaguely remember something about it...
Â 
I also thought Ghost being captured was laughable, I was thinking wtf while watching.
2678	Corvinus	2014-04-28	Don't know if anybody has mentioned this before, but part of the butterfly effect comes from the fact that the show only has Bran as the warg and not the others, yet. In ADWD, Jon knows through Ghost that both Summer and Shaggydog are still alive, so he would have at least a good reason to suspect that Bran and Rickon are alive as well. We don't really see Jon thinking much about this while considering Stannis's proposal, though. It would have been nice if the show would have shown Jon's warging abilities, too, and have him discover Bran through Ghost.
2679	piles	2014-04-28	I think it's much more interesting to think of Jon meeting the Reeds than Jon meeting Bran. The implications or hints that this might hold for R+L are full of intrigue.
Â 
I didn't dislike the change too much, it creates some mild peril for Bran which this season needs - lengthy descriptions about how cold and hungry he is wouldn't have translated well to screen. I am unsure if the NW will make Craster's before they leave; it seems like a bit of a re-tread of the watchtower where Bran wargs Hodor if they don't meet and just miss each other again. I imagine they must be planning some sort of meeting, otherwise it's just a bit redundant.
2680	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-28	Stannis asks Jon because he wants to give WF to a Stark (and he needs one).
Why wouldnt Jon now not tell Stannis Rickon might still be alive?

Â 
I would think we will get fake Arya, otherwise all the stuff that happens with Theon at Winterfell won't happen and then there is nothing for Theon to do....also the Winterfell stuff begins to set up the Bolton's fall.
2684	'96Buck	2014-04-28	I suspect the Bran/Jon thing will be pretty much a relocation of Queenscrown...Summer saves Jon, but Jon never sees Bran.Â  If it's not this, then their conversation awakens Jon's warg powers, and then Bran goes on to do what he must.Â 
Â 
If they need Bran to abdicate title to Winterfell, he certainly can.Â  Some are seeing this as an obstacle.Â  Of course, if we hold King Robb's presumed declaration of legitimacy to have legal force, then it's unnecessary.
Â 
While it certainly "feels" like pieces are in the wrong place right now, it's not hard to see them getting back where they belong.Â  Perhaps Jon's victory at Craster's gives him the bona fides that bookJon gets from Holding the Wall.Â  I'm not sure rooting out some turncoats has quite the same cachet, though.
2685	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-28	Stannis asks Jon because he wants to give WF to a Stark (and he needs one).Why wouldnt Jon now not tell Stannis Rickon might still be alive?

Â 
Because Bran asks him to not tell anyone?
2686	'96Buck	2014-04-28	Why wouldnt Jon now not tell Stannis Rickon might still be alive?
Â 


King's blood.Â  Rickon is of no use to Stannis as Lord of Winterfell, he's a child.
2687	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	This episode didÂ lay the foundations for a possibleÂ Bran/Jon interaction-
Â 
Karl (mutineer leader) being aware Bran is Jon SnowsÂ little brother.
The line drop from Jon about Bran being alive and North of the Wall. Surely, that holds some relevance?
It looksÂ like things are being set up for the mutineers to use Bran against Jon. 
Â 
AddÂ assassin wannabe Locke into the mix and 2 gigantic caged wolves and we have some chaos in store. I haven't anticipated seeing a GoTÂ scene this much in awhile...well, since the Purple wedding...But this sounds really good and for once the North storyline is taking the spotlight. I don't get what all the fuss is about?

2691	'96Buck	2014-04-28	It seems like a really long ride from Craster's to wherever one would expect the HQ of the White Walkers to be.Â  Presumably its in the Lands of Always Winter, hundreds of miles from Craster's, across a forbidding mountain range.Â  Even if we stipulate the WW have magic "don't get frostbite" powers with their affinity to cold, a baby would die of dehydration and starvation before reaching it.Â  Unless WWs can also nurse newborns...

I agree. There were snares. It is really not as unlikely or "laughable" as people are saying that Ghost could be trapped. He is a very big wolf, but still a wolf.

Â 
Â Considering Jon knows Robb is dead and without an heir, I think he'd want Bran or Rickon safe though?
Â 
This does pose some problemsÂ about Jon knowingÂ there must be a new Lord Stark. Unless he doesn't willingly let Bran go and has someone try to find Rickon...Davos? Nope, surely they won't do that! I need Manderly Frey Pie!Â

That's a fair point as well.Â  He can always abdicate to Rickon when he's of age (if the world survives that long).Â

Wait for the next episode. I am pretty sure they will tell the reason. 
Seriously need to bash each and every thing? 
Sam didn't make Bran promise,  then why isn't he telling Jon about it... Ahhh have patience!  
They can't spill out everything in one episode.

Nah. Next complaint. - Stannis won't get so many awesome lines to say 
You can never satisfy purists. 
I wonder they rather not want to see their fav books getting adapted into a series in the best possible ways. Seriously I can't think of any other network doing this better
2703	David Selig	2014-04-28	Wait for the next episode. I am pretty sure they will tell the reason.
Seriously need to bash each and every thing?
Sam didn't make Bran promise, then why isn't he telling Jon about it... Ahhh have patience!
They can't spill out everything in one episode.
Next episode we will most probably know why Karl insists on keeping Ghost alive. Maybe like a guard dog or something.


It was a joke.
2704	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	Â 
He probably will tell him, cuts out the whole Wex Pyke thing, Stannis can just send Davos to pick him up.
Â 
Saves time introducing the Manderlys..Davos being 'killed' etc.. they can be brought in some other way.


Â 
I think the Manderleys will still be in, in some form or another. There were numerous mentions of Whiteharbour in S03, and the Manderleys were the only other House at the Red Wedding besides the Boltons and Freys.

Dustins and Mormonts were there
2706	northernmonkey	2014-04-28	I can see the logic in this change because it's inconceivable that show-Sam wouldn't tell Jon about Bran (to be honest, that made no sense in the books either).
2707	FalseKnight	2014-04-28	Dont underestimate the butterfly effect.
Even George admitted Jaime sooner arrival to KL kind of messed the Cersei now rape scene...
And this is far bigger...

This argument makes no sense. That was a rape scene because they chose to have Jaime force himself on Cersei. They could have made that sex consensual in any number of ways. There is no butterfly effect, and GRRM should be ashamed of himself for suggesting that Jaime's early return had a causal relationship with the rapeyness.
2708	A Man Has Said	2014-04-28	Stannis - Jon plot line offering him to be Jon Stark likely ruined....
Or heavy changed.

He would now know he cant accept cause it is his brothers lordship. And if Bran is alive, Rickon is likely to be.


Excellent point. It goes to show how the showrunners have 'crossed the Rubicon' in terms of every getting the plot to follow that of the books.
And they've burned any bridges behind them in doing so.
Â 
It more or less sends a message to readers of the books, "We (D & D) don't give a Rat's Cook's Ass what you think."
Â 
The real tragedy is that there is no-one on their staff that is 1/10th as good a writer as GRRM.
Somebody there must have one hell of an ego to think that they are.
2709	Tadco26	2014-04-28	This argument makes no sense. That was a rape scene because they chose to have Jaime force himself on Cersei. They could have made that sex consensual in any number of ways. There is no butterfly effect, and GRRM should be ashamed of himself for suggesting that Jaime's early return had a causal relationship with the rapeyness.I don't think that is what he suggested. He suggested that perhaps D&D felt that the scene had to be changed because this wasn't the first time they had seen each other since Jaime returned to Kings Landing. The show just did a terrible job portraying a scene that they intended to be something that became consensual.Certainly the writers could come up with some reason why the mutineers captured and kept Ghost alive next episode, but I'm struggling to think of a good one. He can't really be a guard dog of any value if he is locked up in a cage. They don't have infinite supplies, and Ghost would no doubt be hostile to them, and Karl has already shown his propensity for cruelty. They start beating on Hodor and stab him in the leg just for the hell of it, but Ghost they keep in a cage and feed? It's hard to imagine how they are going to justify it, but like many changes they make, there is a good chance they won't try. Change as much as they want, then pretend it didn't happen or didn't matter later.Since the noble captive exchange is never going to happen it ultimately won't matter, but I am curious how a bunch of Night's Watch deserters were planning on collecting on a noble ransom, when to even let someone who might pay the ransom know about it would require going south of the wall.
2710	Uldra I	2014-04-28	They intend to train Ghost to dance to entertain people?


Â 
Karl reminds me of some of the more "redneck" types I've met down here in the South.Â  I think a person like Karl might just get a huge ego boost knowing he now has a big ferocious direwolf to call his own.
2711	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-28	Now Jon Snow knows something, that's D&D-level character assassination.
2712	Corvinus	2014-04-28	Now Jon Snow knows something, that's D&D-level character assassination.
2713	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	Everything happening at or near the Wall in this episode has me reeling. What in the ice blue hell has happened to the story now ?
Â 
Jon knowing Bran is something other than dead is HUGE. And they just casually toss it off in a conversation between Jon and Sam , that Jon was already told ! What was that conversation like:Â  "Hey pass the salt, oh by the way, Bran Stark [heir to Robb's crown and your only non-Sansa kin left] is alive and headed north of the Wall."Â 
Â 
I mean, I can see Roose wringing this info out of Ramsay who squeezed it out of Theon, but they only knew the boys were alive, not where.Â 
Â 
And now Locke shows up at the Wall ? First of all, holy crap - Locke at the Wall is bad enough news. (I had hoped he'd be headed for some eventual conflict with Brienne, replacing Shagwell.)
Â 
On top of that, Sam and Jon happen to be discussing that very Bran issue when guess who shows up at the edge of the room.
Â 
And oh, Bran and friends also got captured by the deserters, and both their direwolves somehow too. And Bran tells them who he is, even though this makes it the second time he's been held hostage by NW deserters now.
Jojen - no greensight about this, bro?


Yea it's like if you are going to make a major change like this, don't we at least deserve to see an emotional scene where Jon finds out his brother wasn't murdered by his foster brother?
2714	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	Anyone else think Ramsay's girlfriend will play "fArya"?
As for the OP there are certainly some big changes going on. But I actually like that because it means that even though I have read the books, more than once, and discussed them here a lot as well, I still have no clue what will happen on TV. I like being surprised.
So Jon knows about Bran, and clearly at Craster's is when he will be reunited with Ghost. He also had Locke with him, whose actual mission is to kill Jon on behalf of Bolton.
So my guess is they are compressing Jon's heroism defending the wall and his building popularity there with hints of the later mutiny against him. The fight at Craster's will lead directly to him being made Lord Commander, and ther will be no first wildling attack where Ygritte gets killed as in the books.
Instead, there will only be one wildling attack, and it will also be the one where Stannis makes his surprise attack from behind. His selection as Lord Commander will most likely happen then before Stannis arrives.
I am also pretty excited that this TV scenario means we will se Jon meet Meera and Jojen. That hasn't happened in the books.


If that is the case D&D will be eliminating yet another great Stannis line. "Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?" "Any of you, I would think. Even the cook." But who am I kidding, showStannis has zero sense of humor and D&D go out of their way to make him as unlikeable as humanly possible.Â

Nah they'll keep that in I'd say, they've already reminded us of where Slynt came from and established that Thorne isn't liked by the men which sets Slynt up to be the compromise candidate to oppose Jon which leads into that quote.

Â 
It would go along with the 'raid the pantry' line, which was perfectly in line with the sardonic humour of Stannis.Â
2717	sifth	2014-04-28	Sam not telling Jon was something that always angered me in the books. The guys Sam's best friend and in all likelihood saved his life. Besides all that he's Jon's brother, he has a right to know.
Â 
The fact that Sam is willing to so blindly trust Cold Hands in the novel never made sense to me, it seemed to be something simply done for plot convenience.
2718	Arkash	2014-04-28	Now Jon Snow knows something, that's D&D-level character assassination.
Â 
Â 

Â 
You, ser, deserve a cookie !
2719	Darryk	2014-04-28	It does create complications, and may make one of my favourite parts of the story (Jon refusing Stannis' offer to be made Jon Stark) untenable, or at least a lot less powerful.
Â 
But on the other hand, Sam not telling Jon that Bran is alive because "he promised not to" was always rather difficult to swallow.
2720	Heir to Winterfell	2014-04-28	Except GRRM writes 10% of the episodes...
2721	Bowen	2014-04-28	I guess they will change the reasons for Jon not accepting but he won't tell Stannis why. Maybe Bran here asks Jon not to tell, and that he must leave and go North because he knows how to defeat the Others. Then, Jon realises that Bran might never return or that it will take him so long. So, it's like for now, they're dead and can't return to reclaim Winterfel. And they don't know where Rickon is.
Â 
I don't mind the changes so far but it's like they're trying to distance themselves for certain details while they will have the same end. It's the details what explains the end, and that's why many things feel fucked up.Yep I'd agree with this and for the life of me I can't understand some of the changes,i reckon so many of the changes come about because they probably feel the show watchers aren't as likely to piece things together,they don't do subtlety do they?its like they have to sledgehammer each point home instead of trusting viewers to work it out or not!
Re Sam telling Jon about Bran it may seem a small thing to some but having the Starks not know about each other in the books is something that made me cringe( can't find the right word)in the books,plus it makes Sam into an oath breaker effectively.
Didn't like Crasters either,holding Ghost and catching Summer bugged me as well,as if both would be stupid enough to get trapped,I believe it's another overkill,something D&D do quite well,all that said I enjoyed the episode very much.
2722	Daenor	2014-04-28	Ok my turn to complain!
First of all i need to say that i'm not a book purist nerd.I understand that book adaptations on screen need some changes or else they would have been rather boring in most cases.
Now in order to take things from the beginning:When Theon told about the Starks being alive i thought this would have lead to a Rickon-Osha chase.We never learned how Rick ended in the cannibals' isle and it could have been a fine addition.
No people having the Starks reunite is not cool!The series is not some fairy tale ,where in the end everyone lives happily ever after.I don't think i wanna see a cliche reunion where some typical emotion will kick in.Also as someone else mentioned the alternative of having repeatedly "almost there" reunion scenes will also lead to opposite results for the viewers.
As for the Stanis' offer thing i don't think the knowledge of Bran being alive changes that much.But it does change in terms of who Jon Snow has become.The belief that all his family are dead has played a significant role to the shaping of his character.And when he learns about "Arya" he goes from one mistake to the next since he's desperate to secure his only sister.A Jon Snow who knows that at least 3 of his brothers-sisters are alive is a completely different person and his story becomes far less dramatic.
As for L+R=J that some people mentioned i don't think that Martin would have let the show writers spoil his upcoming book like that.Most probably only the final season will be a huge spoiler for the readers since it's impossible that Martin will have finished the seventh book by than.
Finally i must say that the final scene with the Others was nice since we got some insight about them never mentioned before.
2723	Masha	2014-04-28	I really hope that Jon does not meet with Bran and Co. Because if someone who is considered to be a good guy like Jon would meet with his little brother and will allow himself to be talked into letting Bran go further north beyond the Wall, I (and most other viewers) will loose any respect for Jon. After all, Bran is still a kid, a helpless crippled kid with a dimwit, young girl and a sickly kid for a company. Bran's judgement is suspect (as seen in this episodes when over objections of more experienced Meera he led his wolf into trap and then got captured after Meera told him its time to go), Hodor is also been shown as helpless in a fight, Meera might be a good hunter but helpess against other humans (or Others), and Jojen is just as helpless as Bran if not worse at this point. Regardless of reasons, and to Jon, Bran's crow story should be a dream factor, Jon should not be allowed to let them go if he does meet them, otherwise its Character Assassination and another misstep this season after Jaime/Cersei rape scene.
Â 
So here is to hoping that Bran will get out before actually meeting with Jon (where are you, Coldhands) or more realistically warg into Hodor and free them (and wolves) in the chaos that will happen when Jon will attack Craster's keep?
Â 
Also, my hope for this season that Locke gets killed not by Jon but by direwolf. Jon will have his fill of Â killing and fighting scenes at the end of season. Time for the Wolves!!!! (I started to hope about thisÂ from the moment Roose sent Locke after Stark boys. I was hoping he'll go after Osha and Rickon and Shaggydog will get them, but I will take Summer and/or Ghost action anytime now!)
2724	Needs More Salt	2014-04-28	Butterfly effect? Is this like the grandfather paradox? where if you go back in time to kill your grandfather so you never existed?
Â 
Or are we talking 'Back to the Future' where Marty McFly hooks up with his own mother? Would that make Jon Snow his own father?Â 
Â 
I'm so confused!
2725	titanx5	2014-04-28	I know this is a CRAZY CRAZY theory of mine, but perhaps they may have Bran tell Jon that Rickon is still alive, and Jon lets Stannis know this, and sends Davos after him. D&D may want to avoid Davos going all the way to White Harbor, of course this means them leaving out Manderley. But I would prefer to see White Harbor, but like I said its just a theoryand I am probably wrong
2726	howardh51	2014-04-28	D&D def dropped the ball on this one...
Â 
Agree watchers of the show deserved a more emotional scene when/where Jon learns that Bran is still alive...
Â 
Also - no way Jon and Bran meet again at Crasters. One of two things happen: Either the Others/WW or Wildlings get there first and slaughter everyone - and somehow, someway Bran and Co. slip away...
Â 
OR - CRACKPOT - The WW arrive first and kill all of the NW and THIS is how Bran learns of his true destiny...

Â 
The preview for the next episode shows Jon and gang battling the mutineers, and Meera or Jojen telling Bran that he has to escape quickly. I'm betting Bran slips away while Jon goes woowoowoo on the mutineers thereby just missing each other and the obligatory slow motion scene where they're wearing speedos and running towards each other on a sandy beach will have to wait.
2728	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	I know this is a CRAZY CRAZY theory of mine, but perhaps they may have Bran tell Jon that Rickon is still alive, and Jon lets Stannis know this, and sends Davos after him.

But I would prefer to see White Harbor, but like I said its just a theoryand I am probably wrong


Â  Â I think this might happen too
Â 
However, I think Davos will still go to White Harbor in his search for RickonÂ but Manderly will give him leads towards Skagos as opposed to giving him the task. The fact that Davos is trying to find the Stark heir will obviously be agreeable with Manderly and we'llÂ still get the infamousÂ 'The North remembers' speech and Frey Pies....if they cut Frey Pies then I will riot!
2729	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-04-28	The formost complaint I have with these changes is that Sam shouldn't have told Jon, it felt like we missed a very, very important scene.. and then the Others. What the.. tWoW-spoilers? Not to mention completely unnecessary?
Â 


Sam not telling Jon was something that always angered me in the books. The guys Sam's best friend and in all likelihood saved his life. Besides all that he's Jon's brother, he has a right to know.
Â 
The fact that Sam is willing to so blindly trust Cold Hands in the novel never made sense to me, it seemed to be something simply done for plot convenience.


Â 
Uhm.. Because Coldhands saved Sam's life when he and Gilly were surrounded by Wights in Whitetree, led them safely to a secret passageway under the Wall known to men of the Night's Watch only?
Â 
It's pretty darn hard to not trust a guy after he magically appeared out of nothing on an Elk and saved your (+chick&baby) life and led you back to safety, through a gate that only your sworn brothers know about - indicating that he at least once was a sworn brother.
Â 


Except GRRM writes 10% of the episodes...


Â 
So basically 1 episode of a 10 episode season.. Which was the second episode this season.

Â 
Osha is a wildling and Skagos is probably more akin to wildling culture then anything else in the North.
Â 
But GRRM keeps pulling on those almost there-meetings.. Arya wants to go to her family, too bad, your family just died. Jaime returns to KL, too bad, your kid just died. Brienne is looking for Sansa, too bad, a hedge k'niggit you met up with on your travels that was also looking for Sansa, but whom you snuck away from because he was a bit shady got to her first and doesn't even realize who she is! Jaime is in the Riverlands and Brienne tells him that she has found Sansa in the Hound's captivity but needs him for something, too bad, that's a BWB-ambush!
Â 
At this point, it's completely fabricated that all of Arya's hitlistees suddenly appear right in front of her the whole damn time because whenever somebody is actively looking for somebody else, they find them either dead or they die themselves.. -.-
Â 
As for L+R=J.. I think the Reeds are either dead and should only come back into play later when Bran gets the heck out of that cave somehow..
Â 
But who cares, dropping the "Bran/Rickon is alive"-bomb so casually is just about as bad in my eyes, very vastly changes who Jon Snow is. I mean, his conversation with Mel changes completely: "I don't have a sister".. Very much inspired by living with the guilt of knowing of all the losses in his family. The following "rescue mission" is a direct consequence of that. But we're now getting it with Bran instead. So are we going to get it with both Bran AND fArya? As Thorne acknowledges, this mission is clearly with the NW's survival in mind, so Jon gets away with it (on d very bad terms though..). But the fArya-mission isn't.. Which leads to.. well you know..
Â 
There's this weird thought in my mind thinking though that they're condensing this plot with a future plot-line in which Jon does find Bran. Jon is revived somehow and leads the ranging towards Hardhome. For some reason, I expect that Bran at that point has left the cave, or that the underwater river ends up in Hardhome, leading to Jon and Bran meeting up at Hardhome. With Bran having one final message from Jojen: Jon, you're not my brother.. You're my cousin..
Â 


So here is to hoping that Bran will get out before actually meeting with Jon (where are you, Coldhands) or more realistically warg into Hodor and free them (and wolves) in the chaos that will happen when Jon will attack Craster's keep?
Â 
Also, my hope for this season that Locke gets killed not by Jon but by direwolf. Jon will have his fill of Â killing and fighting scenes at the end of season. Time for the Wolves!!!! (I started to hope about thisÂ from the moment Roose sent Locke after Stark boys. I was hoping he'll go after Osha and Rickon and Shaggydog will get them, but I will take Summer and/or Ghost action anytime now!)


Â 
Pretty much agree with the first part I snipped, so I got nothing to add to that.
Â 
The only thing that I liked from these scenes in the episode is that it could've explained why Ghost took so long to get back.. Warging into Hodor seems like the most obvious choice for D&D at this point and I think they alluded to it with Hodor being picketed in the scene in which they were caught: He looked even more helpless then normal and what better way to break out then to use that surprise factor?
Â 
I want to see Hodor take a blade and smack it through Locke's skull while both Summer and Ghost are tearing at his arms. The only problem is, why should the wolf get revenge for the lion? Symbolical sorry for Catelyn holding Tyrion accused for the assassination attempt?
Â 
Also, I still don't enjoy Locke. Why couldn't we have Vargo Hoat? But I guess this will work.. I like the goatee though.. xD

So what, he still comes out of nowhere. You don't trust someone completely on the spot; it makes for poor story telling.
Â 
Cold Hands is undead for crying out loud. I'm sure Sam thought Bran would be fine with the friendly zombie, lol
2731	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	What isÂ the point in having Jon know Bran is alive?
Â 
Because it was stupid of Sam not to tell Jon and itÂ makes no sense? If that was the case then they would've justÂ had Bran tell Sam not to tell Jon in Season 3.
Â 
I don't think they would have changed this just for the sake of it. They've made it clear that Jon knows Bran is aliveÂ one episode before the attack on Crasters and empathised that Bran and Jon are brothers throughout the episode-Â 
Â 
"They have my brother's wolf! They have Ghost!"
Â 
"Jon Snow's brother"Â Â  "And I though this day would be boring." (or something like that) They have leverage against Jon when he attacks...perhaps? Bran might escape but I'm sure they'll probablyÂ inform Jon about Bran.
Â 
I think they're setting things up for a brief interaction with Jon and Bran. Having a near miss again is just repetitive and frustrating. There are ways they can work around Bran getting away from Jon without his consent to go North. The damage has already been done with Jon knowing Bran is alive so what harm will a brief interaction do?

2732	Mr. Sven	2014-04-28	This episode didÂ lay the foundations for a possibleÂ Bran/Jon interaction-
Â 
Karl (mutineer leader) being aware Bran is Jon SnowsÂ little brother.
The line drop from Jon about Bran being alive and North of the Wall. Surely, that holds some relevance?
It looksÂ like things are being set up for the mutineers to use Bran against Jon. 
Â 
AddÂ assassin wannabe Locke into the mix and 2 gigantic caged wolves and we have some chaos in store. I haven't anticipated seeing a GoTÂ scene this much in awhile...well, since the Purple wedding...But this sounds really good and for once the North storyline is taking the spotlight. I don't get what all the fuss is about?


Â 
I really doubt they'll meet. Â I think that we'll probably see coldhands save them, and then one of the mutineers alive when Jon gets their tells him that some undead guy killed everyone and took his brother. Â That way Jon thinks Bran is dead.Â 
If they do I really can't see how the conversation will go. Â Hey Jon I can't go back with you because my friend here dreams the future and says I need to go north?

Â 
Even if Jon refuses letting Bran go North they will probably manage to sneak away amongst all the chaos, when Jon is distracted fighting the Mutineers.
Â 
Remember, it's going to be a war zone so Jon will probably want Bran out of there as soon as possible but won't be able to do it himself. He might just shout "Get out of here!" and free Hodor, telling him to take Bran back to Castle Black...but Bran won't do that (he might justÂ pretend to)Â and there is nothing Jon can do because he is too busy fighting the traitors.
Â 
I though a writer confirmed that Coldhands won't be in the show?

2734	Ser Theodan the True	2014-04-28	I'm still convinced that Mark Gatiss, who was cast as the Braavosi banker, is actually Coldhands. First, he has a creepy kind of look thats perfect for the part. Second, it's been well established on the show that people from Braavos have thick accents and a distinct ethnicity (See Sirio Florel and the Titan's Bastard) that is very different from a pasty british guy. Third, it's unlikely that HBO would reveal such a spoilerific cast title such as Coldhands (implying he's dead) that is much more plot revealing than perhaps someone like Oberyn, which is just another character from another house. That being said I also remember someone on the inside of production saying that Coldhands had been written out of the show for budget reasons (he's just a dude folks, lose the elkif you must!).

You know its funny, casual fans, who I know, who do not read the books are excited that Bran and Jon might hook back up. One even think its possible that these White Walkers lured him North of the Wall somehow and that there is no 3 eyed raven. This guy figures since Jojen and Bran came so close to dying that these creatures were able to send them visions and manipulate them, the idea came to him when Jojen had his seizure, that Osha was right and Bran should have listened to her since she was born beyond the Wall and knew more about this stuff. She did seem spot on about the comet.Â

Â 
Do we even know what the damage really is? I mean, why is it so important for book Jon not to know about Bran? I know it was probably explained somewhere, just can't recall right now and reading the book it was kinda frustrating when you had Sam think about Bran and want to tell Jon about Bran, but for some reason he couldn't.
Â 
I actually don't mind it, even if there's an interaction. It might turn out toÂ have aÂ butterfly effect, sure, but I remeber when I read the book I was constantly like "gaaah" at the thought these two were so close to each other, but never met.

Did they? Â Thats kind of disappointing.Â
2738	Ser Theodan the True	2014-04-28	Jon would have no knowledge about what happened at Winterfell because he was north of the wall in season 2. Therefore in the show he must have found out about the sacking and about Bran being alive in the same story and thus making it less impactful. Really dissappointed we didn't see any of these revelations, the other notable one being the Red Wedding, being told to Jon. These types of emotional moments sell the entire story for me so I'm pretty pissed it got bumped for some more Thorny-Slynt bonding.
Â 
Final note: I think Locke is going to be a sleepercell that won't be activated until they get to the NW mutiny. It makes more sense for the show to go this route because they havent introduced Bowen Marsh and it would be more resonating to the audience to have Jon caught in a web of deceit similar to Robb rather than a straight up mutiny.

Â 
I think people are just worried about the legitimacy issues it creates for Jon- he knows Bran and Rickon are alive so he can't take Winterfell from them. However,Â in the books heÂ says No to Stannis offering him Winterfell anywayÂ and Robb's Will never happened on the show so I don't get what the big fuss is about? Nothing will change drastically.
Â 
I actually think this could work out better-
Â 
Stannis offersÂ Jon Winterfell andÂ Jon says no, tellingÂ him about Rickon being alive.Â Stannis then sends Davos after Rickon as opposed to Manderly giving him the task.Â Davos then searches for Rickon at White Harbor (we still get 'The North Remembers' speech) and Manderly points him towards Skagos. Simple.
Â 
Jon and Stannis look pretty decent in the whole thing. Actually, Stannis is looking like a saint!

2740	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	Nah they'll keep that in I'd say, they've already reminded us of where Slynt came from and established that Thorne isn't liked by the men which sets Slynt up to be the compromise candidate to oppose Jon which leads into that quote.


Yea I still tend to believe they'll wait to elect Jon LC, but IF they did it beforehand, there's no way Stannis could say that line.
Â 


Â 
It would go along with the 'raid the pantry' line, which was perfectly in line with the sardonic humour of Stannis.Â 


Yea I must admit the 'raid the pantry' line was one of the few times show!Stannis has displayed his humor.
2741	FNF	2014-04-28	Â 
I think the Manderleys will still be in, in some form or another. There were numerous mentions of Whiteharbour in S03, and the Manderleys were the only other House at the Red Wedding besides the Boltons and Freys.


My pet theory is that Ser Too-Fat-To-Sit-a-Horse (GRRM) will show up at Winterfell with the Frey Pies but we won't get any prior introduction. Maybe a Frey at the Wedding will mention the three missing Freys supposed to arrive with Wyman as well.
2742	King Zee	2014-04-28	I think there must an interaction between Bran and Jon. The tv audience is getting restive. reaffirming the stark family bond will be a good thing.

Also, fuck the narrowly missing each other scenario, AGAIN.Â

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â Then again, i dont really care. Keep the Fanfic coming(If its indeed fanfic) Last night was my first time not knowing what i watching. I loved itÂ
2744	sifth	2014-04-28	Well I've read all of the books nearly 4 times, and I'm actually excited at the possibility of the brothers meeting. I'm said on the last page how I always felt Sam not telling Jon was one of the worst things George wrote into his story and seems to be he did simply for plot convenience. You know to have Jon sad that he's possibly the only member of his family still alive.
Â 
I don't really see how this ruins anything. I mean it was annoying how close to each other they were in the book. Though GRRM likes to pull this move quite often in his novels I've noticed.
2745	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-04-28	Jojen - no greensight about this, bro?

I seriously cracked up at this! 
You are absolutely right though. Jon knowing Bran is dead is MASSIVE. I'm concerned about where this will lead and if it will end up in the same place as the book. I hope so.

http://gameofthrones...iki/Bowen_Marsh
2749	hedgeknight001	2014-04-28	I'm not sure what Lockes background is supposed to be. You figure Jon could tell that he was northerner. I'm not sure what happens with him, maybe he sees a White Walker and shits his pants. It would sort of be interesting if Jon won him over to an extent, if Locke saw him as someone who Roose needed to command the Wall and that knocking him off could really rock the boat and have dire consequences. Probably it won't pan out that way,
Here's the weird thing: when talking with Jon at CB after the sword practice, Locke claimed he was a "game warden" from the Stormlands, caught for poaching a pheasant for his starving family. But, surely, Locke does look/dress like a Northerner and has a Northerner accent.
Also, why is Locke there by himself? Couldn't Bolton have simply matched right to The Wall and demanded that any Stark refugees be turned over to him, since he is now Warden of the North? Why the subterfuge?
Having Jon now know about Bran isn't necessarily ruinous to the plot -- even if the plot was to go so far as to have the two actually meet, Bran can insist, as he has been doing, that he needs to go to the far north and that Jon must treat Bran as dead/lost so as to dissuade other bounty hunters.
Regardless, Bran effectively isn't a Stark any longer as he has accepted a higher calling than regaining his family's interests.

2750	Seneti	2014-04-28	Stannis - Jon plot line offering him to be Jon Stark likely ruined....
Or heavy changed.
He would now know he cant accept cause it is his brothers lordship. And if Bran is alive, Rickon is likely to be.
I dont see how Jon is having a conflict at all. Either Stannis offer wont happen, or wont be so hard for Jon.
Also, Jon is now in the "Theon didnt do it" camp. If book Jon buddie with Stannis had this info he would likely share it with Stann.
By the way I predict no farya, and a Battle of Ice for Rickon. What do you think of it?


Â 
I think Stannis' offer will still happen and Jon's reasons haven't changed, except that now it's not Sansa he'd be stealing the title from, but Bran and Rickon.
Â 
As for fArya and Battle of Ice for Rickon, it's too early to tell.
Â 


man so much whining. Â "Its ruined!"
Â 
Â 
No it isnt. and unlike you D&D know the ending.Â 


Â 
This.
Â 


Bran has to have something to do. Jon has to have something to do. Combine their needs and boom - plot, conflict. Nothing changes the story. Jon's not deserting just to save Bran. Chances are he'll reach Craster's just as Bran is leaving, they'll glimpse each other and do some cheesy half-smile and go their separate ways.
Â 
I just don't like how Ghost is caged? How long has it been in show time? Has someone been feeding him, walking him? 


Â 
Agreed on Bran's story. As for Ghost: he probably got caught in a similar trap as the one that caught Summer and I think Karl actually threw a piece of meat at Rast and told him to "feed the beast".
Â 


Â 
It changes the scene as you know it. The scene hasn't even happened yet and you're already devastated.Â 


Â 
So much of this.
Â 


Even in the books, Jon's escape from the wildlings was aided by Summer and in ADWD, in Jon's wolf dream Ghost senses that Summer is north of the Wall. Jon has always known that Bran is alive and kept that secret secret, for good reason.Â 


Â 
And this.
Â 


It seems like a really long ride from Craster's to wherever one would expect the HQ of the White Walkers to be.Â  Presumably its in the Lands of Always Winter, hundreds of miles from Craster's, across a forbidding mountain range.Â  Even if we stipulate the WW have magic "don't get frostbite" powers with their affinity to cold, a baby would die of dehydration and starvation before reaching it.Â  Unless WWs can also nurse newborns...


Â

Ewww... thank you, nightmare fuel station attendant. I think I'll need a 1-hour loop of Ser Pounce to get over that *shudder*

  that never even crossed my mind. My sympathies to your Friend.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Jon and Bran reunion?
I dont see why its so implausible for Jon to understand the motives for Bran venturing farther north. The two of them, the Reeds and of course Hodor can just sit down for a nice cup of coffee with a little explaining for shits and giggles and, Walla! problem solved.Â 
Â 
All for the greater good and whatnot
Â 
If WWs, wargs and huge direwolves pets arent too much to drive them crazy surely Bran's "save the world" plan is pure geniusÂ
2752	Sun	2014-04-29	My only real question about the changes with Jon is Locke: Will the show kill him off this season, or will they have him survive long enough to make him the instigator of the mutiny and see him put a knife in Jon's stomach instead of Bowen Marsh next season? Perhaps even have him be the writer or architect of the Pink Letter?
Â 
I guess we'll see.Â
2753	Dany's Silver	2014-04-29	Karl reminds me of some of the more "redneck" types I've met down here in the South.Â  I think a person like Karl might just get a huge ego boost knowing he now has a big ferocious direwolf to call his own.


I'm sure it's an ego boost, but I also think he's got a complex similar to guys with big trucks!
Â 


I'm still convinced that Mark Gatiss, who was cast as the Braavosi banker, is actually Coldhands. First, he has a creepy kind of look thats perfect for the part. Second, it's been well established on the show that people from Braavos have thick accents and a distinct ethnicity (See Sirio Florel and the Titan's Bastard) that is very different from a pasty british guy.

Lol, Miltos Yerolemou who plays Syrio Forel is quite British (see him speaking here - past the cheesy intro music).Â  It is quite possible for an actor to change accents for a performance.Â  Â  I'm still disappointed that Coldhands won't be included...
2754	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-29	My only real question about the changes with Jon is Locke: Will the show kill him off this season, or will they have him survive long enough to make him the instigator of the mutiny and see him put a knife in Jon's stomach instead of Bowen Marsh next season? Perhaps even have him be the writer or architect of the Pink Letter?
Â 
I guess we'll see.Â 


Â 
I don't really see why. Locke is tricking Jon to get Bran so he can get land and a lordship. He has no real reason to hate Jon or wish him dead...If anything he can empathize for being a bastard and taking shit from "Highborns" his whole life.Â
2755	Orys Lothston	2014-04-29	Lots of mentions of Skagos but in the TV universe Rickon and Osha went to the Last Hearth with the Umbers, which is directly between the Dreadfort and Castle Black...
Locke probably stopped there on his way up!
2756	acacia	2014-04-29	I've just had a thought but didn't Jon find out that Bran was alive late last season? When he's fighting the Wildlings and Summer and Shaggydog help him fight them off doesn't he say later on that they are still alive as he saw their Direwolves or have I completely made this up? I'm certain he mentions seeing them to someone.

Â 
He does, That even happens in the books, but for some reason Jon fails to make the connection that Bran's direwolf being alive means Bran is probably alive too. Honestly the whole thing with Jon not knowing Bran was alive and Sam not telling him was kind of stupid in the books and I'm sort of glad, albeit a bit nervous, that the show is just working around it.
2758	MrsManderly	2014-04-29	Could not agree more!
Â 

As I posted on another thread, this change really annoyed me because:
Â 
(1)Â  in the books, Sam knowing that Jon's brother, any other Stark at this point,Â is living, but being oath-bound not to tell him, is one of the most poignant moments inÂ the entireÂ series
(2)Â  even worse, the fact that Jon was told about it was just mentioned in an off hand way - if D&D were going to reveal it, at least they should have made it a significant scene!
Â 
I did not even think of the butterfly / hurricane impact on the Jon/Stannis relationship...
Â 
This, it seems to me, is a secondÂ botch up by D&D on in relation to Bran - the first being how they handledÂ Bran & Rickon's supposed murder in Season2/3:Â  (1)Â Cat and Rob were informed at the beginning ofÂ Season 3 not that Bran and Rickon are dead, killed by Theon, but that they are merely missing andÂ  (2)Â worse yet, Cat had already released Jaime at the end of Season 2, i.e. before she got this information.Â  To me, this both detracted from Cat's characterÂ  (in the books she only released Jaime thinking her two younger sons dead and thus desperately focusing on saving her girls) and somewhat dulled the horror of theÂ Red Weddins - in the books, the dying Cat thinks it is her last, her only remaining, son that is being killed at the Twins.

2760	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-04-29	I do not see why this is such a concern to people. it did not make complete sense in the books that cowardly, blabber-mouth Sam would be able to keep such a secret of Bran's existence from his best friend and lord commander...
Â 
show makes more sense that he actually told Jon. this is not going to be a problem because it's simple...Jon will arrive at Craster's during the fighting or after, someone or somehow Jon will come under the impression that Karl or Rast killed Bran...he will be back to being in the same position as after news of Theon killing them
Â 
and even if he has some suspicions that a "crippled boy and a simpleton" somehow managed to escape from crasters, he will seriously doubt that Bran would actually survive long with WW and wights...if u rmr in the books, he already had some suspicions of Bran surviving when Summer helped him fight off the wildlings at the mill, in books its easy to write about the fact that he was thinking about it, but in show how r they supposed to show his thoughts...in show he did see summer, but they didnt show anything beyond that...with this story line, they could show him wondering about this while considering Stannis' offer...
Â 
unless D&D decide to reunite Jon and Bran at crasters...then it would actually change everything...but that would be extremely out of character for the show as well...we'll find out next ep, so have some faith till then people!Â

There was a reason Bran didn't want Sam to tell Jon. Maybe Bran told him the reason Idk but I think that if Sam promised he would keep his word. He didn't promise in the show so it doesn't matter. 
If they don't meet at Craster's he may believe Bran dead BUT he won't think that Theon killed him. (He knows now that Theon didn't kill them via Sam in the show) That changes a lot of things for me: Everyone will know Theon is not a kinslayer, I for one was very looking forward to a possible Theon/Jon interaction at the wall. Possibly Stannis would bring him. Also Stannis is holding Theon saying basically he has to kill him because the Northman would flip if he didn't. How will all that play out if they all know Theon didn't kill them? 
Also I think it's a little redundant to keep having close encounters of the Jon/Bran kind.
Lastly, there is no reason for Jon to assume that Bran is alive just because his wolf is. He may think that part of Bran is in the wolf or something along those lines but there is absolutely no reason Bran couldn't be dead with Summer alive.
Not to mention it isn't near as hard for Jon to refuse Winterfell when he knows there are trueborn heirs living. It said something for his character that he continued to refuse what he has always wanted. That's taken away if he knows Bran is alive.

Â 
Jon/Theon scene was unlikely since he got stabbed up by NW, most likely he will have to flee the Wall, barely alive...
Â 
As for Stannis finding out, even if Jon continues to think that Bran is alive, no reason for him to tell Stannis about it...2 reasons he has perfectly good reason to keep that to himself,
1) he's worried that stannis will try to force the boys to give stannis their support and he doesnt want that pressure on the kids, better they are off beyond the wall than under Stannis and pyscho melisandr...
2) remember he's worried about melisandre's obsession with blood of a king? thats the reason he sent off Mance's son. makes complete sense that he'd be worried about melisandre wanting to burn Bran (ancient line of kings of the north, brother of Rob, King of the north).Â 
Â 
so stannis can still do as he likes with Theon.
Â 
I agree with the redundant part, who knows y D&D deciding to do that...i never got y they decided to change Yaara to Asha...maybe there was a reason, or maybe just for the heck of it...
Â 
i agree that if Jon is not convinced or at least reasonably certain of Bran's death at Crasters, then it might end up extremely weird...but if that is the case that Jon knows Bran is alive, or it is more than just a mild hope/suspicion, then perhaps D&D will decide to change his decision process as well...they might just show that before he comes to a full decision to pass on Stannis' offer, the NW already chose him as LC, taking decision out of his hands...i agree that wont be good either, but it all hinges on what happens next ep....i'm still hoping that something happens that reassures him of Bran's death
2763	jarl the climber	2014-04-29	Here's the weird thing: when talking with Jon at CB after the sword practice, Locke claimed he was a "game warden" from the Stormlands, caught for poaching a pheasant for his starving family. But, surely, Locke does look/dress like a Northerner and has a Northerner accent.
Also, why is Locke there by himself? Couldn't Bolton have simply matched right to The Wall and demanded that any Stark refugees be turned over to him, since he is now Warden of the North? Why the subterfuge?
Having Jon now know about Bran isn't necessarily ruinous to the plot -- even if the plot was to go so far as to have the two actually meet, Bran can insist, as he has been doing, that he needs to go to the far north and that Jon must treat Bran as dead/lost so as to dissuade other bounty hunters.
Regardless, Bran effectively isn't a Stark any longer as he has accepted a higher calling than regaining his family's interests.


I think that Roose does not want to be seen as violating the neutrality of the Nights Watch. He has no real reason beyond a hunch that the two kids might there. It also not clear if he really has 200 or 300 men to spare right now, most of his men are trapped South of Moat Cailin. I think he just wants to quietly bump off the Stark kids and Jon Snow as well, even with him being Warden/Lord Paramount he has no real reason to go after the two kids, they are to young to be traitors. Just throwing some ideas out there, hopefully the writers/showrunners clear this up a little bit.

Some good points & I don't disagree that the show is not, as of yet, beyond redemption. I enjoy the show I'm just worried about how everything will play out now that they've decided to change this particular thing. 
Also don't you think its possible that the stabbers will flee from the NW after realizing Jon will live? Or better yet that they are caught & forced to face the consequences? I don't think Jon will leave the NW but it is possible.

Nothing is really going to change. Jon will return to the wall to fight the wildlings and Mance. Bran and co. will somehow escape and head to Bloodraven. I feel like people have delusions that one day the show is just going to say fuck it and have Jaime become King, Tywin rebel and join forces with Stannis who has now converted to the Old Gods and decides to marry Lysa Arryn or something. They make small changes but everything eventually ends up the same.
Â 
I don't really think there will be much of a Night's Watch by the time Jon returns to consciousness, really. Plus someone is bringing the wall down, if not Jon.

Haha! This is exactly what I'm afraid of! All in all as much as I would love for the show to follow the book exactly I understand that is just not possible. 
There are plenty of small changes that I enjoyed. I do get a little frustrated when they make changes for no apparent reason. I do understand the necessity to liven Bran up a bit for the screen and they couldn't hardly have Bran captured at Craster's along with Ghost by ex members of the NW without SOMEONE disposing of them. I just think they made a poor choice when deciding how to liven Bran up. 
When it's all said and done as long as what you said doesn't happen I'll be satisfied enough. Until then I will use my time in between shows picking apart the things I don't like and gushing over the things I do

Â 
im worried that just the number of people that disagree with jon will make his stabbing acceptable to the NW and lead to him being exiled from NW...however, i didnt consider the wildlings....they would definitely revolt at the idea of being sent back north of the wall and sheer number of them would overwhelm the new mutineers....will be interesting to see how that plays out...
Â 
i too dont agree with them changing things for no apparent reason, but i dont agree with the haters who were yelling about daario's beard not being blue or syrio not being bald...inconsequential details are ok...
Â 
as for bran...truthfully, i read the series 3 times so far and everytime iv been bored to death of brans POV till he get to BloodRaven...i was extremely peeved when they skipped all his visions when he was in the coma in s01e02...i guess they figured if they showed all that back then, they would have very little to show rest of the seasons till he gets to BR...so i'm slightly okay with it...
2770	ebevan91	2014-04-29	There was a reason Bran didn't want Sam to tell Jon. Maybe Bran told him the reason Idk but I think that if Sam promised he would keep his word. He didn't promise in the show so it doesn't matter.
If they don't meet at Craster's he may believe Bran dead BUT he won't think that Theon killed him. (He knows now that Theon didn't kill them via Sam in the show) That changes a lot of things for me: Everyone will know Theon is not a kinslayer, I for one was very looking forward to a possible Theon/Jon interaction at the wall. Possibly Stannis would bring him. Also Stannis is holding Theon saying basically he has to kill him because the Northman would flip if he didn't. How will all that play out if they all know Theon didn't kill them?
Also I think it's a little redundant to keep having close encounters of the Jon/Bran kind.
Lastly, there is no reason for Jon to assume that Bran is alive just because his wolf is. He may think that part of Bran is in the wolf or something along those lines but there is absolutely no reason Bran couldn't be dead with Summer alive.
Not to mention it isn't near as hard for Jon to refuse Winterfell when he knows there are trueborn heirs living. It said something for his character that he continued to refuse what he has always wanted. That's taken away if he knows Bran is alive.


Â 
Well, Theon DID still take Winterfell, killed Ser Rodrik, and killed 2 innocent miller's children. He swore a vow to Robb and broke it.Â
2771	sj4iy	2014-04-29	Did they? Â Thats kind of disappointing.Â 


Â 
I think it would be kind of confusing myself. Â We've spent 4 years seeing White Walkers and dead people trying to kill the living. Â Suddenly a dead guy comes out of nowhere who wants to help? Â We don't know who he is or how he's alive, or why he's even bothering. Â It doesn't make sense, even in the books, so I can see why they would want to cut it out of the show if there aren't any future ramifications from it.
2772	sj4iy	2014-04-29	Could not agree more!
Â 

As I posted on another thread, this change really annoyed me because:
Â 
(1)Â  in the books, Sam knowing that Jon's brother, any other Stark at this point,Â is living, but being oath-bound not to tell him, is one of the most poignant moments inÂ the entireÂ series
(2)Â  even worse, the fact that Jon was told about it was just mentioned in an off hand way - if D&D were going to reveal it, at least they should have made it a significant scene!
Â 
I did not even think of the butterfly / hurricane impact on the Jon/Stannis relationship...
Â 
This, it seems to me, is a secondÂ botch up by D&D on in relation to Bran - the first being how they handledÂ Bran & Rickon's supposed murder in Season2/3:Â  (1)Â Cat and Rob were informed at the beginning ofÂ Season 3 not that Bran and Rickon are dead, killed by Theon, but that they are merely missing andÂ  (2)Â worse yet, Cat had already released Jaime at the end of Season 2, i.e. before she got this information.Â  To me, this both detracted from Cat's characterÂ  (in the books she only released Jaime thinking her two younger sons dead and thus desperately focusing on saving her girls) and somewhat dulled the horror of theÂ Red Weddins - in the books, the dying Cat thinks it is her last, her only remaining, son that is being killed at the Twins.

Â 


Â 
How can they botch up a story that GRRM himself is producing and helping to write? Â Surely he would have been like "Oh, wait, that would screw it all up if you did that". Â They aren't 'botching' the story, they are making the changes necessary to bring it to screen.

They botch up book made movies all the time. I read somewhere (not sure if its true) the GRRM writes about 10% of an episode. It's not as if they have to OK every change with GRRM. Also whether or not something is 'botched' is kind of in the eye of the beholder isn't it? What might have ruined it for you may be a welcome change for me and vice versa

Â 
Well, if the show is written in a way similar to most other shows, the writers meet with each other to nail down what they want to do in the season and to assign the stories to each writer before they are ever written. Â Since he's a producer and a writer on the show, I doubt that he doesn't have some say in some of the bigger changes that are made. Â "Eye of the beholder" or not, you can't say something is 'botched' when the author of the original story is help writing the material. Â You can 'I don't like the changes', but just because you don't like the changes doesn't mean that they've irrevocably screwed up the story.
2775	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-29	My only real question about the changes with Jon is Locke: Will the show kill him off this season, or will they have him survive long enough to make him the instigator of the mutiny and see him put a knife in Jon's stomach instead of Bowen Marsh next season? Perhaps even have him be the writer or architect of the Pink Letter?
Â 
I guess we'll see.Â D&D are making Stannis backstaab Jon Snow with a fork. It is known.
2776	MoA«t	2014-04-29	It won't matter if Jon knows because:
1. Bran & co will escape Craster's before Jon & co arrive, and they won't meet up.
2. Jon could keep an eye on Bran for awhile if he could control his warging abilities....... *sigh*

Ok, "botch up" may be too strong a term -Â the show isÂ obviously aÂ massiveÂ challenge to produce and it's easy to be a "couch director" and say one could have done it better...
Â 
But it is I think reasonably well established that D&D are calling the shots on the series and, while GRRM is consulted, he does not have editorial veto on the show.Â  Moreover,Â GRRM has on several occasions pointed out that their departures from the books (many of which are of course warranted by change from book to screen) do lead to ever increasing divregence from the books and has, it seemed to me, sought to slightly distance his vision in the books from D&D's in the show.Â  The most striking example of this wasÂ GRRM's quoted reaction to the Jaime/Cersei "Rapegate" last week, where he took pains to point out that this scene plays outÂ very differently in the books and, without saying explicitly that the show makers (or more likely the episode director)Â got the scene wrong, heÂ seemedÂ  to indicate his disapproval of how it was handled.Â  Â
2778	Konradsmith	2014-04-30	I don't know if anyone's suggested this yet on this thread, but I think it's possible that if Bran escapes CK before Jon and co. arrive, that Karl could justÂ lie to Jon and say he killed Bran just to be a spiteful prick. This would put everything back to how it is in the books and would actually make Jon feel even shittier about his brother's supposed death.

"Rapegate" was about the most overblown overreaction that I've seen to a tv show in a long, long time. Â But I won't get off-topic...D&D have no choice but to change things because the timing in the books wouldn't work in the show. Â You can't just skip a character for most of the season before coming back to him or her. Â Martin will always prefer the books because they are HIS vision...the show is someone else's vision of his words. Â But I would bet that there are things about the show he liked better than what he did in the books, as well. Â That's just how it is.
2783	Lord Damian	2014-04-30	I am not that disapointed in the show regarding certain scenes and timelines. What i am dissapointed in, is the whitewashing of characters to make them seem less evil or dark, still not making them lilly white mind you but brushing them up like Tyrion, Cersei and Dany. I do love the expanded roles for Tywin and Bronn.
2784	Widows_Blood	2014-04-30	I posted this in another thread but,Â 
Â 
The show is really starting to get into possible future book events. I`m intrigued whether the whole Jon learning about Bran being alive is something that happens in a future book and the show decided to get it out of the way rather then doing it in season 6 or 7. The whole Sansa not being a killer yet, Whitewalker stuff, has me thinking the show is laying down the tracks for future seasons as well.Â
2785	Biobiwan	2014-04-30	It seems like a really long ride from Craster's to wherever one would expect the HQ of the White Walkers to be.Â  Presumably its in the Lands of Always Winter, hundreds of miles from Craster's, across a forbidding mountain range.Â  Even if we stipulate the WW have magic "don't get frostbite" powers with their affinity to cold, a baby would die of dehydration and starvation before reaching it.Â  Unless WWs can also nurse newborns...


Â 
Â 


I agree. There were snares. It is really not as unlikely or "laughable" as people are saying that Ghost could be trapped. He is a very big wolf, but still a wolf.


Â

2786	Biobiwan	2014-04-30	Jon Snow & Company = Coldhands
2787	dbunting	2014-04-30	Ok, can't read all 20 pages before airing my thoughts.I have no problem with this change. If they followed the books then Bran would have no scenes for a season or two, and if he is a central person then you can't have him just disappear.My crackpot thoughts. Bran skinchanges into Hodor and frees the wolves, they make their escape or help the battle when Jon and company arrive. The "good guys" win the battle and Jon and Bran talk. Bran shows Jon his warging ability and a scene possibly with a weirwood tree? Bran did try to talk to Jon through Ghost so maybe this replaces that? Jojen potentially gives Jon clue or hint to his parentage. Bran convinces Jon that he has to find 3EC or the wights will win. Jon gets an emo face and lets Bran keep going North.

and then there's the Locke factor
2789	Dorne Sand	2014-04-30	Â 
How can they botch up a story that GRRM himself is producing and helping to write? Â Surely he would have been like "Oh, wait, that would screw it all up if you did that". Â They aren't 'botching' the story, they are making the changes necessary to bring it to screen.


GRRM is no god. I liked the "wall arc" and what goes beyond just as it was in the book i fully agree with "botched" comment. That changes has to be done ok, but i just don't like the changes they/he made. And i think even for a tv show they are badly made.
It begun in the previous episode with sam sending gilly to moles town when he knows that they are wildlings on the wrong side of the wall to say the next episode "oh shit ! they are wildlings on the wrong side of the wall attacking villages and gilly is now in danger!"
the casual "oh by the way one of you brother is alive", the training in the yard stopped by allister without any mention of how that could be usefull against armed wildlings
Oh by the way i don't see any kind of preparation of a fight coming on castle blackÂ  and the excuse of allister to send john away is very lame while the danger is very much present and that they mention the obvious lack of men to defend it
Oh and look what a coincidence! just when john will attack the mutiners in crasters the same that kept his wolf alive for what the hell reason, his wolf that apparently in all previous episodes he don't give a fig about, just then, bran is captured by the same mutiners who has set up a trap for some strange reason, trap in which haha! summer falls in and now look they are captured
Â 
As if they didn't have a guy that had green dreams travelling with them...
Â 
Up until now i didn't mind any of the changes, some even i found great
Â 
Not this. Is it about ressources? No, the changes they made imply more action than needed? About time? no, the sam gilly part is absurd as the crasters scene could have saved some precious time. On the contrary they needed to show the characters and needed some action to do so? Well personally I think it is wrong. I loved low paced show with a lot of dialogues in just like True detective or the wire for instance. What the hell, you are bringing to screen a 10000 thousand pages book surely you can't need to add plots that are not there! And i don't speak about scenes, but full plots Â 
Â 
Could we have some beautifully written dialogues involving sam, john, aemon? some dialogues where we could have felt the missed wolf, and sam telling john about bran (if you need him to know for any reason at all)? couldn't we have built up the tension on the wall with john and allister arguing about the defenses of castle black for exemple or made the watch pardon to john going wildling longuer ? Any other plot with more sense and logic? a plot where just as they made with jaime showed us some character insigths and changes?
Â 
I don't know where they are going, but since the former episode i didn't understand and really i understand less and less. I always looked at the Bran arc north of the wall as some kind of homage to frodon trip, a lonely trip, yes boring but poetic on his own with the always present and creepy feeling of someone travelling to his own doom. The john's arc was one of my favorite with his guilt about being a "double turncloack" his rise in the watch etc etc
Â 
And worst of all i don't see any kind of benefit for the changes they made even on a TV show adaptation necessity side. they added complexity where the book is straigth forward, they added incoherent plots and moves that even without reading the book seem stupid and some non reader i know just found this episode plainly boring Â
2790	Hippocras	2014-04-30	Ok, can't read all 20 pages before airing my thoughts.I have no problem with this change.

Also the actor is growing up so fast that if they left him out for a season, no one would recognize him. 
Think about it. Without a few changes, all we will see is him going ever north, being cold, making fires.....and we already saw that with Sam and Gilly.

It has been mentioned, but I think that's the best possible outcome.Â  I really, really don't want Bran and Jon to meet at this point.Â  If anything, I would find it satisfying if Jojen sensed (or had a vision of) Jon's warging abilities.Â  As I've said before, given that Jon and Ghost were separated by the Wall at Queenscrown, and Jon's link with his direwolf was severed (at least in the books), Jojen's ability to sense another warg in the Stark family was probably hampered.Â  Alternatively, the Greenseer/3EC wasn't concerned with pointing out Bran's family's abilities to Jojen, but I like the idea of Jojen sussing this information out.
2792	Seneti	2014-04-30	Not to mention it isn't near as hard for Jon to refuse Winterfell when he knows there are trueborn heirs living. It said something for his character that he continued to refuse what he has always wanted. That's taken away if he knows Bran is alive.


Â 
Actually, if I remember correctly, he refused in the books because Sansa was still alive and by the laws of Westeros even a daughter would come before a bastard. So in terms of Jon's choice, the show change doesn't change that much.

2793	Impish	2014-04-30	And also, forget what Roose promised [Locke].Â  Once he takes the oath, he's completely screwed.Â  Even if he succeeds in retrieving Bran, he can't ever leave the NW.


Â 
Â 
If the writers want Locke to be able to leave the wall, they will write a way for him to do so. Period.
Â 
(Going "missing" north of the wall, faking his own death, taking on a disguise and/or different name, having the Boltons protect him, etc etc etc. Â It's hardly some sort of insurmountable plot obstacle.)
Â 
However, I suspect Locke dies before this becomes an issue... we "know" he can't kill Bran or Jon, so his quest is doomed to failure.

I'm pretty sure Locke is being positioned there more long-term - to take Bowen Marsh's role eventually...
2795	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-30	I don't think Locke will be killed off just yet.
Â 
He adds some character to the NW plot and Noah Taylor is anÂ excellent actor so the writers will probablyÂ want to take advantage of that.
Â 
However, I Â wonder what him beingÂ at the WallÂ could add to the Stannis/Bolton conflict?

I just mentionedt his in another thread: Locke is already replacing Vargo Hoat; I can't see why they would then have him replace yet another book character.Â  We're also overlooking the fact that Jon will soon have his direwolf back, and Ghost is a damn good judge of character.Â  He'll let Jon know (one way or another - and I hope by biting Locke's hand!) that Locke is not to be trusted.

Not 100% sure but I think Sansa is not brought into play in this decision because she is originally under Lannister control & then married to a Lannister & then is MIA. If I feel ambitious in a little bit I'll try to look it up & see where exactly Sansa was at the time but I have thought this whole time she was out of commission for one reason or another.

Noah Taylor should just take on the roles of each remaining character yet to be cast. Â It just makes sense.

I would have no problem with that if the make-up department can turn him into the Pomegranate and he no longer looks like Locke. Â  Locke, on the other hand, must do what all men do: Valar Morghulis.
2800	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-30	I don't know it depends how this whole Craster scenario plays out, maybe it'll end with Jon thinking Bran is dead or something. I can't see Jon letting Bran go deeper north willingly so their going to have to handle it all somehow. D&D hate Stannis anyway so I always assume any cool part of his story will get cut out anyway. 
I think the whole farya thing will play out because of the fact that D&D seem to be really into the whole Theon story and it wouldn't be really all that hard to introduce some girl as farya later on. They could even wait till Ramsays wedding for that matter.

I'm thinking Bran and company will escape when Jon and company attack, and Bran and Jon won't even cross paths, maybe Jon sees something to make him believe Bran is now dead.

2802	We Swore A Vow	2014-04-30	It has been said a few times already but how in the seven hells did they manage to capture Ghost and put him in a cage. He doesn't seem docile in the least even when they are feeding him he is pissed off. Dire wolves are big and maybe Ghost is under fed possibly weak but even then that can't really change his strength too much. That scene and change really bothered me. I'm sure that Ghost only listens to Jon. How the mutineers got close is beyond me. Maybe its too much strain on the budget to show the wolves actually killing things. 
By the way where has Nymeria (aryas wolf) been in the series. She better be out and about with a hundred plus pack. Mayhaps the hound and arya run into their rampage across the hills. All we get to see are two wolves because the others are dead or have been off screen most the time.

Â 
Concerning your first question I see two possible answers:
Â 
1) He was caught in a trap similar to the one that caught summer.
Â 
2) Sam locked him up before the mutiny, because Craster didn't want the wolf strolling about his own territory.
Â 
As for your second question: Nymeria probably is in the Riverlands tearing up the landscape with her pack, we just don't see her. If the writers want to throw us a bone (no pun intended), then we'll get a line or two from some random character about a vicious wolf pack in the Riverlands. If not, she'll only reappear once she become relevant for the overall story (which, for all that we know, might never happen).
2804	metr0man	2014-05-01	Lol Stannis offering Jon Winterfell isn't a plot line. It's a single scene that amounts to little. 
I hope Jon and Bran do meet. GRRM's slow drawn out pacing of events has soured me on the books. I'd rather move up the Stark interactions.

Time will tell... I think it may play better to the Unsullied to have a character that they know festering there for a while and then culminating in the stabbing.Â 
Â 
Otherwise, what's the point of having Locke up at the wall?Â  Vargo never went there so him being a Vargo replacement doesn't quite answer the question for me.Â  I guess he could just be there as a short term threat to Bran's life - in wich case he bites the dust in the next episode or two.Â  But that seems like a bit of a waste of a fair bit of character set up...
Â 
Also, one of the big theories regarding Bowen Marsh & Co's motivation is that they were acting on behalf of the Lannisters (this prompted by an earlier intiative by Cersei (or was it Tywin?) to get rid of Ned's bastard at the wall).Â  If that theory is panning out to be true - given D&D's knowledge of what comes ahead - having Locke be the instigator would fit in nicely.
Â 
As regars Ghost, Ghost's animus towards Locke can be incorporated to great effect for the viewers, while having Jon ignore it - as indeed he ignores many warnings of what is to come.Â  And of course Ghost is tied up for the "main event" in ADWD.
Â 
I may be proven wrong on Sunday/Monday when Locke bites the dust at Craster's, but for now, I'm placing my bets on this one....

Its not a single scene. He offers it to him several times, gets angry with him for refusing. But Jon keeps refusing for several reasons which go to build his character.

Â 
It is character building, but not exactly hard to accomplish on the show. The offer can still be made and rejected for the same reasons. Basically all we need to know, and all that it amounts too, is that Jon has always dreamed of being Lord of Winterfell but ultimately accepts that it's not his destiny and that his life is for the NW.Â

I think that would be brilliant for Locke to live till end of s5, and be the one to stab Jon. Of course in he does live that long people/viewers will wonder why the hell hasn't he made his move yet? Would have prefered if they delayed his coming to the wall till s5, were he suddenly becomes the massive threat to Jon at CB. But really am loving Locke in the show, and don't want him to go just yet, plus would love for him to brutally kill some wildlings at the wall

I like Locke too, but having him be the one to stab Jon would completely change everything about the storyline. Â It wouldn't be that the NW wasn't able to see the wisdom in Jon's embracing of the wildlings....it would just be that Roose Bolton's spy did what he was sent there to do.

Exactly!Â 
Â 
it seems to me you could have:
Â 
- Locke fails to kill Bran in next episode
- maybe even Jon and Locke thinks Bran is dead anyway (e.g. if Bran gets away before Jon arrives and Karl Tanner lies to Jon that he killed Bran)
-Â so Locke now has no immediate mission but either he gets stuck up there since he took the NW oath or (more likely) Bolton has him hang out there just in case
- he advances through the NW ranks
- Jon thinks they are pals and appoints him head steward or whatever
- Jon lets the wildlings in, NW grumbles generally
-Â Locke subtly manipulates the brothers to get them angrier and angriear at Jon + there's the whole Stannis/Mel/Selyse dynamic as per books
- and hey presto Jon gets stabbed by a NW mutiny!
Â 
And to thicken the plot further, having a Bolton man up at the Wall there lends itself to all sort of possibilities in relation to the Pink Letter....
Â 
Of course, this all only works IF the big picture is that Boltons/Lannisters had at least some involvement in Jon's stabbing.Â

Unless Locke escapes and then somehow goes after Rickon, I can't see him lasting very long.Â 
Â 
IIRC, Jon believes that Ghost is behaving aggressively in ADWD because Borroq the skinchanger arrives with his boar.Â  Jon doesn't want Ghost to kill the boar and cause further animosity between the Night's Watch and the wildlings who have come south with Tormund.Â  Although Jon has cause to doubt Melisandre's warningss, it doesn't mean he is ignoring Ghost's warnings; he just misinterprets them as a reaction to the skinchanger.Â 
Â 


Book Ghost is a damn good judge of character, show Ghost not so much. He let himself get caged by a bunch of bad guys. And he abandoned Jon when Jon was still with Qhorin, because according to Qhorin he is just a wild beast.Â 


I think he fell into a trap (like Summer just did), which is a lot different than having the mutineers manage to cage him.Â  Yes, but even Show!Ghost knew that the Mormont need assistance.Â  Admittedly they didn't handle Jon and Snow parting beyond the Wall very well, but that doesn't mean that Show!Ghost is bad judge of character.

Â 
Haven't read any threads yet, so don't really know what others are thinking about the stabbing of Jon, but my interpretation from reading the books was that Bowen Marsh's hatred of Jon goes back to before the Choosing.Â  Seems like he was just a tool in the "hate Snow" posse at the wall.Â Â  That group just wanted to get rid of him like Bolton does in the show.Â Â Bowen saw an opportunity and jumped on it.Â  Can't see too much difference in what or whyÂ Jon got stabbed, whether by BowenÂ or Locke.Â  But it seems too early in the story for that to happen now.Â  
	Spoiler It seems to me that Jon has more to do at the wall first with the wildling situation, and he hasn't had the pink letter yet which is what causes him to want to go to Winterfell.

2817	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-01	If Jon nearly finds Bran and just misses him, I wonder if he will allow him to keep going and won't pursue him because he knows the Wildlings are near and knows his duty is to the NW. It would be in character since it's been a central theme for Jon's arc, since we saw it when Robb went to war and when he turned on the Wildlings. It'd fit in well and continue that dilemma for him, without making it look as if Jon's just let Bran go because it doesn't fit into the books.

As I recall now I could be wrong but IN THE BOOKS, isn't ghost missing for a while. Jon often wonders about him but for some reason he's still missing. So around the time stannis offers jon to be a stark and offer him winterfell... Isn't one of the things that sway jon to say no is how ghost reappears out if nowhere and reminds him of Ned's gods? 
I enjoyed this moment in the books and was let down when I seen it may be changed, BUT however what the show has done is interesting too I like what they've done. 
& just like how GRRM has said. If you don't like the story he has created THEN GO WRITE YOUR OWN THAT WOULD BETTER SUIT YOU. Same can be said for the show.

Â 
I don't think he "let" himself get caged. I think he either fell into a trap similar to the one that Summer fell into or he was caged up by Sam when the survivors of the ranging returned to CK (just like Robb caged up Greywind before the RW - everythime a direwolf ends up in a cage, it bodes ill...)
2820	Tixu Oty	2014-05-03	It seems like a really long ride from Craster's to wherever one would expect the HQ of the White Walkers to be.Â  Presumably its in the Lands of Always Winter, hundreds of miles from Craster's, across a forbidding mountain range.Â  Even if we stipulate the WW have magic "don't get frostbite" powers with their affinity to cold, a baby would die of dehydration and starvation before reaching it.Â  Unless WWs can also nurse newborns...


Â 
I'm glad someone brought that up, I was thinking the exact same thing!
Â 


It looksÂ like things are being set up for the mutineers to use Bran against Jon. 


Â 
I can live with that! I'm also eager to see where this goes.
Â 


He probably will tell him, cuts out the whole Wex Pyke thing, Stannis can just send Davos to pick him up.
Saves time introducing the Manderlys..Davos being 'killed' etc.. they can be brought in some other way.


Â 


Stannis offers Jon Winterfell but Jon refuses saying Rickon is still aliveÂ so Stannis sends Davos after Rickon?
Davos looks for him at White Harbor seeing as House Manderly is loyal to the Starks...and Wyman gives him the leads towards finding him on Skagos. He also talks about some Northern vengeance!


Â 
Yes I suppose they could do that. If so, I sure hope they find ways to make it super interesting because the whole Davos and Manderly thing was one of my favorite moments in AFFC/ADWD.
It works if Jon has no idea where Rickon is. He could advise that Stannis try to hook up with Manderly who is loyal and has boats, two birds with one stone, with Rickon being a side mission. But there's no way Manderly would send Davos to Skagos in the show, since TV Rickon is headed for Last Hearth, and if Manderly plays his part in a convincing way, the Umbers would not trust him with that information I think.
Â 


Karl reminds me of some of the more "redneck" types I've met down here in the South.Â  I think a person like Karl might just get a huge ego boost knowing he now has a big ferocious direwolf to call his own.


Â 
You're right, I think no further explanation is needed really.
Â 


Now Jon Snow knows something, that's D&D-level character assassination.


Â 
Aha 
Â 


Yea it's like if you are going to make a major change like this, don't we at least deserve to see an emotional scene where Jon finds out his brother wasn't murdered by his foster brother?


Â 
Except Jon didn't get that memo to start with, and neither did Robb and Cat in the show.
Â 


If that is the case D&D will be eliminating yet another great Stannis line. "Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?" "Any of you, I would think. Even the cook." But who am I kidding, showStannis has zero sense of humor and D&D go out of their way to make him as unlikeable as humanly possible.Â 




Nah they'll keep that in I'd say, they've already reminded us of where Slynt came from and established that Thorne isn't liked by the men which sets Slynt up to be the compromise candidate to oppose Jon which leads into that quote.




Â 
It would go along with the 'raid the pantry' line, which was perfectly in line with the sardonic humour of Stannis.Â 


Â 
I agree, no reason to assume that will be changed just yet.
Â 


Now in order to take things from the beginning:When Theon told about the Starks being alive i thought this would have lead to a Rickon-Osha chase.We never learned how Rick ended in the cannibals' isle and it could have been a fine addition.
Â 
No people having the Starks reunite is not cool!The series is not some fairy tale ,where in the end everyone lives happily ever after.I don't think i wanna see a cliche reunion where some typical emotion will kick in.Also as someone else mentioned the alternative of having repeatedly "almost there" reunion scenes will also lead to opposite results for the viewers.
As for the Stanis' offer thing i don't think the knowledge of Bran being alive changes that much.But it does change in terms of who Jon Snow has become.The belief that all his family are dead has played a significant role to the shaping of his character.And when he learns about "Arya" he goes from one mistake to the next since he's desperate to secure his only sister.A Jon Snow who knows that at least 3 of his brothers-sisters are alive is a completely different person and his story becomes far less dramatic.


Â 
I have two things to say about that. First, I'm like you I liked the tragic aspect of Jon not knowing all his siblings but Robb were really alive. I even liked that he could have figured it out with his wolf dreams but he had other problems on his plate, and just like the other Stark kids, we never really get much of his thoughts about the loss of his family.
However, I think it's ok to cut back on this for the show only people. Some of these could definitely deal with just a little bit more of hope and good things for the good people in this show. I believe it's also part of what keeps people watching. Sure it aint becoming a fairytale, but no need to go all out gloom either.
Â 
The second thing I want to see, and it occured to me while reading this thread, is that Theon has been whitewashed in a way in the show. We really don't know to what extent the false information that he killed the Stark boys has been spread. Robb and Cat never heard that story, and if Jon hasn't heard it, maybe not so many people believe that? Correct me if I'm wrong, my memory might be failing me there, but have we ever heard someone say that Theon killed the Stark boys??? I really can't remember. If not, then maybe the reason for that is the show wants to make a future redemption easier for Theon? Maybe Theon ends up meeting Jon Snow and the show needs Jon not to be super mad at Theon at this time? I really don't know.
Â 


I don't know if anyone's suggested this yet on this thread, but I think it's possible that if Bran escapes CK before Jon and co. arrive, that Karl could justÂ lie to Jon and say he killed Bran just to be a spiteful prick. This would put everything back to how it is in the books and would actually make Jon feel even shittier about his brother's supposed death.


Â 
Hey that could definitely work for me. It would be a bit repetitive to have another near-miss if you ask me, but then again, it could serve to put the blame for Bran's supposed death on somebody else than Theon???
Â 


It has been mentioned, but I think that's the best possible outcome.Â  I really, really don't want Bran and Jon to meet at this point.Â  If anything, I would find it satisfying if Jojen sensed (or had a vision of) Jon's warging abilities.Â  As I've said before, given that Jon and Ghost were separated by the Wall at Queenscrown, and Jon's link with his direwolf was severed (at least in the books), Jojen's ability to sense another warg in the Stark family was probably hampered.Â  Alternatively, the Greenseer/3EC wasn't concerned with pointing out Bran's family's abilities to Jojen, but I like the idea of Jojen sussing this information out.


Â 
Yes and you know, come to think of it, Jojen doesn't even have to say anything to Jon. He could simply tell Bran at a later point once they have parted ways. Like Bran, you realize your bro is a warg too, right? This way Jon still wouldn't know but the viewers would really start seeing him differently. It could be nice.
2821	Uldra I	2014-05-03	...
Â 
The second thing I want to see, and it occured to me while reading this thread, is that Theon has been whitewashed in a way in the show. We really don't know to what extent the false information that he killed the Stark boys has been spread. Robb and Cat never heard that story, and if Jon hasn't heard it, maybe not so many people believe that? Correct me if I'm wrong, my memory might be failing me there, but have we ever heard someone say that Theon killed the Stark boys??? I really can't remember. If not, then maybe the reason for that is the show wants to make a future redemption easier for Theon? Maybe Theon ends up meeting Jon Snow and the show needs Jon not to be super mad at Theon at this time? I really don't know.Â  ...
Â 
Â 


Â 
IIRC During the Red Wedding, Catelyn begs Walder Frey to release Robb, her only surviving son, and take her instead.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  Oops... I was wrong... she referred to Robb as her first born son.Â  Sorry.

It works if Jon has no idea where Rickon is. He could advise that Stannis try to hook up with Manderly who is loyal and has boats, two birds with one stone, with Rickon being a side mission. But there's no way Manderly would send Davos to Skagos in the show, since TV Rickon is headed for Last Hearth, and if Manderly plays his part in a convincing way, the Umbers would not trust him with that information I think.


Â 
Actually, I firmly believe that Rickon is not headed for the Last Hearth. Osha SAID that they would go there, but that doesn't mean she'll do it. It'd actually make more sense if she didn't, because that way no one knows where Rickon really is and she's setting false trails, making detection even more unlikely.
2823	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-04	I knew they wouldn't meet...they handled it better than expected, jon still has no clue if bran actually survived...
Hodor!
2824	MrsManderly	2014-05-06	Oh well - so much for my Locke is Bowen Marsh theory! 
Â 
Did people find the way the show worked it out satisfactory? I'm honestly not sure what I think about it
2825	Tixu Oty	2014-05-06	Yes it's fine I suppose. This added adventure at Craster's kills several birds in one stone
- give Bran something to do
- replace Jon's wondering about his siblings wolves in his wolf dreams with knowing for a fact Bran went North of the Wall at some point
- gives Jon some xp points
- replace Jon's disbelief at Theon killing his brothers with apparently never hearing that story in the first place
- Jon and Ghost reunion (right now I can't seem to remember at which point they reunited in the books)
Am I forgetting something?
Â 
I was surprised at the clearly more magical turn this episode took. What which Jojen and Bran awake visions? That was nice but unneeded story-wise and very unusual for the show. It looks like set up for more magic to come.
2826	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	Its not a single scene. He offers it to him several times, gets angry with him for refusing. But Jon keeps refusing for several reasons which go to build his character.


He's waiting for him to throw in Boardwalk and Reading Railroad as well.
2827	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-01	Part OneÂ  is a bit long. So how about a fresh one?
Â 
A huge reveal hit us in this episode that really made us stagger. How to make sense of the mystery surrounding the Others/White Walkers?Â 
Â
2828	Crow'sEye	2014-05-01	To refer to the other thread.
The WWs take male babies because that is what they are offered. Craster doesn't wish to shag his sons, only his daughters.
I would bet that when Craster ran off with his wilding wives and set up his fiefdom he started hurling out the male babies which brought the attention of the WWs, and it became a 'thing'.
The WWs saved the lives of 100 kids!
2829	WTFSalami	2014-05-01	Given the info we have on Craster, and the info we have on the WW, I've got to believe that the baby is now in much better hands.
2830	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-01	Given the info we have on Craster, and the info we have on the WW, I've got to believe that the baby is now in much better hands.


 Yes. Especially given the info we have about the mutineers. Why do i feel like that baby got rescued?

Â 
Now wait just a minute. Craster may have been a dick, bt it is in fact apparent, that those "rules" were set into place.
Â 
"Dont touch my daughters or ill kill you" was a common theme. Well, why?
Â 
If one of his daughters got pregnant, and it was a boy, but didn't have craster's full seed and was tainted by 50% of someone else's seed, then would that botch The Others' ceremony? Because it's not full Craster blood? (i say 50% because his daughters are inbred over and over, so id think by now theyre mostly craster blood to begin with, plus his 50%)
Â 
It seems to me, a bigger conspiracy, might be to maintain the blood of Craster, in male form. What is Craster's lineage, that makes his blood so special?
Â 
There may have been a purpose, beyond "Im a horny old guy that just fucks his daughters to get laid" idea. By fucking his daughters through the generations, it limits the blood of the original more, making his blood more potent, and each baby boy born, has the highest of his blood. Not only can his production be more frequent with the birth of each new daughter, but his blood would be more potent with each baby from that said daughter.
Â 
Yeah, i dont think it's "my daughters are special to me", but rather, "my boys are SUPER special to me, because they serve a purpose"
Â 
Â 
Â 
....do you think, Craster's ancestry, could be descended from, The Night's King and Night's Queen? And that his blood just needs a sort of, "ignition," to tap into that magic.
2832	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	He talks about, "making amends with the old gods."
Â 
That seems to be a hint of sorts, id like to think.
Â 
His job, is basically supplying The Others with Others. But why him? Why not just any other living being. Why his baby boys, specifically?
Â 
There's something here, an underlying mystery. Id think Craster was put up to doing that, to save his own hide, granted, but for something more.
Â 
With each generation, that blood becomes more potent. Stronger, in his sway, and lesser of the original mother.

The Others won't be running a DNA test. As much, they might need the blood of the First Men and the daughters are also wildlings and have Craster's blood, being his daughters.

It would be strange not? I mean it would really be a special character over into the world of Westeros, it would do a lot for me. For me Craster is just a wild, after it is true that the final scene is strange, but I do not think that White Walkers come with sacrifices of Craster, there is something else, what? I do not know yet, but there is something more. The Night's King wants children to turn them, okay, but I do not think that his army should comprise only the children of Craster (and other wildlings.) This isn't a machine so I do not think that there may be 2,000 children and so many Others. We have not yet enough information I believe to understand what it does. 


The Others are creatures that have no human origins, i don't think.
It's too common.
Â 





The scene gives me chills in any case and intriguing detail, with the exception of the ceremony, it is the presence of 12 other White Walkers behind the King. They can be 12 first Lord commanders, because we know that the Night's King is the 13th Commander. There can be transformed the corpses of others to his generals. I do a lot of supposition,Â  sorry.

Â 
while I agree that it's most likely First Men blood that he has, and that it's First Men blood that give The Others their icy power (correlated with Targaryens with dragonblood and fire), theoretically, we only saw 13 Others in that episode. They could very well all be Craster's (not likely, but the possibility is there).
Â 
You have an army of wights, i dont recall seeing any more than 13 Others at a single time, and that was last episode.
Â 
Regardless to their numbers, yeah your probably right it's not just Craster. The point is, there's something in the blood. If it's First Men blood, or otherwise, we dont know.
Â 
Now, the name of the final episode this season, is called "The Children."

Dont apologize, this is the perfect place for supposition, and i believe supposition is the majority of my posts.
Â 
If we take into consideration the fact The Night's King and The Others have pretty much upheld every single aspect of THe Night's Oath (WITH the one exception OF the female Other),
Â 
it may be a good assumption, to think, there's 13 Others. Ok. Him, and 12 others. Well, he was 13th lord commander. Could they be the first 12? Maybe... Maybe the 14th lord commander, was the "corrupt" one, that took over, exiled TNK, named him a traitor, and changed the night's watch to what it is today.
Â 
Maybe the night watch was different, on the 13th and previous lord commanders, and thats why he chose them, specifically.
Â 
But there is one loophole.
Â 
If these are the original 12, and him, i have to believe, not all 12 were alive when he turned them. THey'd be wights, theoretically, not Others. From what we know, corpses turn to wights, livign beings, into Others.

No no no, maybe not, the childen of the forest, perhaps not those children.
Â 
I mean, Craster's children, as "The Children." Except now theyre all grown up
2839	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	I'd also like to throw in some food for thought:
Â 
While it's not realized who The Night's King is, old nan suggests her theory of him being a Stark. We still don't know his name.
Â 
Now, onto the Great Other. Melisandre's top arch nemesis. She frequently states her hatred for The Great Other, whose name shall not be spoken. Well, why? What's so secret about it... Who is it.. I see a big reveal sometime in the future.
Â 
There's forced anonymity here. I don't think The Great Other IS The Night's King, though whose to suggest he isnt? R'hllorian faith is relatively new, i would assume. Certainly younger than when The Night's King was around..
Â 
Add to that, the fact that Sam tells Jon that their library only goes so far back. Why? They detail and write down everything, right down to their storage for the winter. It's like they blatantly excluded, or got rid of, all record of detail from when The Night's King was lord commander (with his previous 12).
Â 
The Night's King was known to have been exiled from the nights watch for falling in love with an Other. Did he? Or did he show up, already turned, and they reacted by throwing him out and claiming he loved her and thats how he turned. They are pretty quick to judge..
Â 
The 14th Lord Commander. I want to know his story. His ambitions, his way of thinking. Why he exiled 13, was he corrupt, what rules he set in motion, and what the differences were in the night's watch, when he was around, and when 13 was around.
Â 
For all we know, the 14th lord commander added in "no wives" after TNK debacle.

Many questions indeed. This is what I love with the saga, we know things, and yet even with some information, we know nothing.
You may be right in any case. I'll re-read the encyclopedia, perhaps there is an element, even the slightest which could help us to learn a little more.
Â 


I shiver thinking of this scene. She is short, but excellent.
Â 


In any case if one refers to the legends concerning the Night's King, talking about his semen, I extrapolate, but given that the scene shows us in the presence of children. White Walkers seeking perhaps something in the blood of men, including the First Men, saw that the Night's King was perhaps a Stark, and they are even descendants of the First Men... There are too many tracks.

Â 
The number 13 there might be only a coincidence or a small reference to that guy being the 13th LC, the NK: something for us readers to know who he is, while Unsullied simply saw him as "White Walker boss". Because I'm sure that Craster has given the others more than 13 sons. I'm a bit lazy to do the maths now, but he had 19 wives. at some point, he might have had at least 10 of them in fertile state in one year. That means that in a year, he could have gotten 10 babies. If half of them were male, then in a year, he probably got 5 sons. And for how long has he being doing this? Gilly is around 15, isn't she? So, ten years of banging 10 women would give more than 13 sons.
Â 
I'm sure either way that Craster's son is a special case. Those Others are "brothers" (half brothers but that doesn't matter). They have their blood "pure" in the same way the Targaryens had. I mean, their mother's had their father's blood. That could mean not something important for the "Ice" part of the equation but for the sons themselves, like, they have a strong bond or connection to each other, in the same way all the Stark kids (even Jon who might not be Ned's son) can warg and probably, will learn to communicate to each other in that way. They were able to locate Gilly's baby, it seems. Maybe they're able to see and feel each other due to their blood, something not all the Others can.
2842	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	According to the wiki, the Night's King sacrificed, similar to Craster.
Â 
For fuck's sake there's a theme here that we're missing.
Â 
And why the hell is the weirwood door underneath his Nightfort. It prevents his magic! Only sworn brothers of the Nights Watch can pass through.
Â 
Well he's one. Craster's father was as well.
Â 
Sworn vows wouldn't carry on to future generations, in fact future generations are prohibited (previous records destroyed, perhaps a previous version of the night's oath that was modified with the 14th lord commander?)
Â 
Craster's openly a dick... how is he a "friend" to the night's watch. Jeor Mormont knew what Craster did, yet, he let it happen. 'the fuck why?
Â 
Craster appears to have been living a sentence that Jeor Mormont knew about. Rules set in place, that he had to follow. "Dont go near my daughters, theyre mine!" and then giving his sons away to turn into Others by presumably, the Night's King.
Â 
WHAT THE HELL AM I MISSING HERE?
2843	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	The wiki also quotes that The Night's King turned when he gave the female Other his seed. Is Craster a descendent of that seed...

Â 
Well, the Watch is meant to be neutral. They can't disrupt Craster's way of living, even though they know what they do is wrong. Also, they aren't in the position to chastise others when they probably need all the help they can get.
Â 
I have my own crackpot theory as well: I think the Starks also did a sacrifice. Not like Craster's but something similar that was meant to be done by the Stark in charge (hence the "there must always be a Stark in winterfell"). Rickard Stark died and also Brandon. Ned never got the memo about what he must do. When the Others didn't get the Stark's sacrifice, whatever balance or pact was broken and they decided to go South.

Â 
"Winter Is Coming," could be the result of an unknown Stark breaking the pact and the impending arrival of winter's henchmen, unless youre suggesting Ned began that breaking?
Â 
Â 
Ok, side note, Craster's parents.
Â 
Father, was from the Night's Watch.
Â 
Mother, was from Whitetree, home to a hugeass muhfuggin weirwood. Jon made journey there, and found burned skulls underneath it, to which jeor exclaims he never knew why they burned their dead (easy one here, to prevent them from rising)
Â 
When they arrive, Jeor/Jon to Whitetree, there is nothing of importance there. THe crow even says, nothing here, i think iirc. However, they passed 4 other villages, or rather this one was the fourth. Why was Craster's mother's hometown the town George decided to include from their Great Ranging int he novels.
Â 
There's soemthing here, in this town. Craster's mother's hometown. There has to be something..
Â 
I have to find it. There's a piece to the puzzle in this chapter. Something we're missing.

"Winter Is Coming," could be the result of an unknown Stark breaking the pact and the impending arrival of winter's henchmen, unless youre suggesting Ned began that breaking?


Â 
I think he did, but not because he wanted to. He didn't know. He wasn't meant to be his father's heir. His father and his heir died before he could have known. Maybe that's the reason the direwolves were sent to his children. To bring back the "balance" and mend what was broken.
2847	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-01	I just noticed Old Nan was full of shit:
Â 

Â 
Â 
They hunted the maids through the frozen forests, and fed theirÂ dead servantsÂ on the flesh of human children.
Â 
Well, no, they fucking turned them into Others!
Â 
I have a small theory. I think what we know about the Northern myths is inversed; that is, the Night's King was not a bad guy and the Last Hero was the true villain
Â 
We know that the Others never attacked Craster. Why? Because he gave them the babies as sacrifice (Didn't Doran Martell said something like princes are the coin they must pay, talking about giving Quentyn to pacify the Yronwoods? That could be a theme), and the show pretty much confirms this:
Â 
Edd: "All the other wildlings have gone. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right"
Â 
Well, what if the Night's King had to made whatever sacrifices and offerings he made at the Nightfort to keep the Others away from the Wall, like an obviously distasteful but necessary pact (Davos: "And I know a king protects his people or he is no king at all")?
Â 
And the Last Hero? Well, Nan says he went North with 12 companions to look for the Children, and then she's interrupted. Well, what if he found them? I still can't shake the feeling that the Children are the true evil. What if they somehow unleashed the Others on the realm and the Last Hero went to them, not the ask their help against the Others but to ask them to basically command the Others to stop or something?
Â 
And then there's something else: Aemon says "that ice preserves" and we kind of think it's a good thing because it gave him longevity, but there's another side to that coin. I think the Last Hero and his 12 companions became kind of corrupted by the Children, maybe asked for immortality of some kind and voila! Those were the 13 dudes in the episode
Â 
Also, about the Starks and all that: I think their superstition to place a sword in the tombs started as a custom related to the Others, since Valyrian Steel is effective against them the Starks of the Age of Heroes probably placed the swords to keep not the evil spirits at bay as the superstition goes, but the actual walking dead inside.
Â 
Re: Whitetree. There are burned bodies in the tree's mouth. We know that the Northerners used to offer bloody sacrifices to the trees as well. Craster's offerings are different: he gives the babies alive. I think that means that the Others are definetely not the Old Gods that the rest of the North seems to follow
2848	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	There are bones in the weirwood tree....
Â 
not sheep's bones, it appears.
Â 
Did they place sacrifice in the weirwood tree?
Â 
That could be a link between the Children Of The First Men, and The Others. This would link the usage of weirwood to The Others.. eventually uniting Bloodraven down the line, who also appears to be undead, but aware. There's no blue to him though, no ice. Can targaryen blood counteract first men blood? Can targaryen blood...cure? First Men blood?
2849	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-01	I don't think it matters that the boys are Craster's or not. I doubt Craster is the only one providing the WW with boys, willingly or not. The Others won't be running a DNA test. As much, they might need the blood of the First Men and the daughters are also wildlings and have Craster's blood, being his daughters.


Maybe not, but come on, the Others are totally keeping tabs on that place. They knew that girl was pregnant and there was one last Craster boy.Â An Other (Baby Buggy) was totally chillin' (hue) there the whole time scoping out and waiting for that kid to come. Craster himself likely made the pact but the Others expected the girls to uphold the vow as long as Craster's seed was happening. Cuz our pal Baby Buggy pretty much vacates the premises after he takes the baby. Its likely that the Others will not care too much about the highly unfortunate situation going on at the Keep cuz Craster's seed, therefore the oath, has depleted.Â 
Â 
So even if there are babies as a result of the rapings, they arent a part of the oath, therefore not going to be come for. Unless, Baby Buggy lets Night's King know whats going on. I think a new oath would have to be crafted for the girls remaining at the Keep to stay safe.Â 
Â 
Which bring us to...

Â 
The title of that episode is chilling.

I really didnt think about it until you pointed it out. BUT HOLY SHIT YER RIGHT!
2850	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	I just noticed Old Nan was full of shit:
Â 
Â 
Well, no, they fucking turned them into Others!
Â 
I have a small theory. I think what we know about the Northern myths is inversed; that is, the Night's King was not a bad guy and the Last Hero was the true villain
Â 
We know that the Others never attacked Craster. Why? Because he gave them the babies as sacrifice (Didn't Doran Martell said something like princes are the coin they must pay, talking about giving Quentyn to pacify the Yronwoods? That could be a theme), and the show pretty much confirms this:
Â 
Edd: "All the other wildlings have gone. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right"
Â 
Well, what if the Night's King had to made whatever sacrifices and offerings he made at the Nightfort to keep the Others away from the Wall, like an obviously distasteful but necessary pact (Davos: "And I know a king protects his people or he is no king at all")?
Â 
And the Last Hero? Well, Nan says he went North with 12 companions to look for the Children, and then she's interrupted. Well, what if he found them? I still can't shake the feeling that the Children are the true evil. What if they somehow unleashed the Others on the realm and the Last Hero went to them, not the ask their help against the Others but to ask them to basically command the Others to stop or something?
Â 
And then there's something else: Aemon says "that ice preserves" and we kind of think it's a good thing because it gave him longevity, but there's another side to that coin. I think the Last Hero and his 12 companions became kind of corrupted by the Children, maybe asked for immortality of some kind and voila! Those were the 13 dudes in the episode
Â 
Also, about the Starks and all that: I think their superstition to place a sword in the tombs started as a custom related to the Others, since Valyrian Steel is effective against them the Starks of the Age of Heroes probably placed the swords to keep not the evil spirits at bay as the superstition goes, but the actual walking dead inside.

Craster's offerings are different: he gives the babies alive. I think that means that the Others are definetely not the Old Gods that the rest of the North seems to follow


Â 
per: http://gameofthrones.../wiki/First_Men
Â 
First Men, & The Children of The Forest, united to fight The Others. Ok, i get that.
Â 
Bran the Builder, a First Man,Â builds the wall.. Then Winterfell, claims himself King In The North. The FIrst Men found The Night's Watch when Bran moves into Winterfell.
Â 
It then immediately states that the Children of the Forest's numbers dwindle.. Now wait a minute. Stop right there. We may be on to something. Why?
Â 
Did they seclude them beyond the wall? Blocked out by the wall? Force them out, drive them out, and then seal it with a weirwood door? Hmm... Now, I know weirwood supposedly amplifies their powers, however, you cant walk through a closed door (that only opens supposedly for people who take the oath) Last I checked no Children Of The Forest have takenÂ the Night's Watch Oath. You may be able to possess it, see through it, as well as other weirwood in existence, but a door is a door. A blockage.

Maybe those Others feel their own blood. The mothers are the same blood either.
Â 
This is so confusing... look, a kitten: https://www.facebook...152435501079095
2855	Slade7	2014-05-01	I'm sure it's already been discussed here but what do you guys think about bran the builder being the nights king?
2856	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-02	Yes. Especially given the info we have about the mutineers. Why do i feel like that baby got rescued?


Â 
Karl Tanner THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099> 's Mission Statement (on his business card and everything!) is apparently "Fook 'em till they're dead!"
Â 
I imagine that has SOMETHING to do with it. 
Â 
He also initially assumed -- and was willing to follow suit -- that Craster simply killed off the boys before they could grow up and become competition, like Cronus Only On A Diet.
Â 
But even without these things White Walker On A Horse (White Rider?) is already the de facto Westeros Father Of The Year due to the dearth of worthy candidates, so yeah Baby Blue Eyes is unquestionably in better (not to mention colder) hands.
2857	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	I'm sure it's already been discussed here but what do you guys think about bran the builder being the nights king?

Meh. Bran built the wall. TNK is 13th... we don't know how long each LC reigned.. I'd assume he'd be long dead at that point
2858	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-02	OT, but anybody else read the title as "The Other Revelation Part II: Ice Cream edition"?
2859	Sun	2014-05-02	Given the info we have on Craster, and the info we have on the WW, I've got to believe that the baby is now in much better hands.


Â 
LOL. I laugh because it's true.
Â 
Best post I'v read in a while.Â
2860	Duckface	2014-05-02	This is from George's blog, how he responded:
Â 

How do you define "spoiler?"
If something happens on the show before it happens in the book, I suppose one could call that a spoiler.
If something happens on the show, but happens very differently in the books, is that still a spoiler?
If something happens on the show, but never happens in books, what precisely was spoiled?

2862	Talking Hodor	2014-05-02	So the Others are running an orphanage for abandoned wildling babies.Â  How thoughtful of them!
Â 
I find it highly unrealistic, though, that a baby half-wrapped in a very thing blanket would have survived a long trek north cradled in the arms of an ice-being that turns everything around it into a blizzard.Â  It must have been 80 Â°F on the set, otherwise, they should have bundled the kid up better.
2863	acco da buhn	2014-05-02	I don't know if this already has been brought up:
Â 
I was in the camp that could see, that what matters is that boys are sacrificied. They're given freely away, a ritual we don't here being practised anywhere else. Someone made the comparison to vampires, who can not enter a house unless you invite them. So I thought that maybe whatever the Others do with the babes only works this way.Â 
Â 
But I think this theory got debunked (at least for the show) by the scene where the mighty Sam stabbed the Other when it tried to take the baby from Gilly. If the Other had gotten the boy, it would not have been given away freely and why would they do that if it won't work?
Â 
This suggest that there really seems to be something important about Craster's blood, the place or maybe the whole incest thing. Yikes.Â
2864	Crow'sEye	2014-05-02	Not necessarily. If the pact had been long standing, or made by Craster, or still not up for amendments. The WW would still take the baby, even if an interloper NW fella wished to intervene.
It was the baby that drew the WW, we still don't know why.
2865	acco da buhn	2014-05-02	Â 
It was the baby that drew the WW, we still don't know why.


Â 
Â Exactly, it was the baby. Not a ritual performed by Craster in the woods.

It's odd to me that that when people are watching a scene like that, the fact the baby isn't cold is what they find unrealistic. The whole scene relies on a lot of suspension of disbelief.
Â 
Â 
I don't think it's unreasonable to assume the WW had a way of keeping the baby from getting cold.
2867	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	Ok here's where im confused and would appreciate everyone's input....
Â 
WW attacks 8000 yrs ago...they are defeated and sent back, Wall's erected.Â 
Â 
First...if WW can turn humans or even babies in to other WW, then why didnt Azor Ahai or whoever else force every human to be south of the wall? I guess argument could be made that in last 8000 yrs, people who didnt want to be kneelers went back north to be free...
Â 
second...if theory of Craster's blood being the special/unqiue one to produce WW's is true, and all the new WW are just his sons, think about it...crasters been doing this what...at the most 50 yrs? more likely 30....and no matter how fertile you think he is, he cant have sired more than a hundred sons...does it seem likely that entire WW army would consist of only a 100 of them plus whatever few thousand wights?Â 
Â 
this does make me think that WW's have similar arrangements with other wildlings, but only a few despicable creatures like craster would agree to keep up a steady supply of sacrificing sons/babies. Keep in mind, WW's have been planing this for a few millenniums!Â 
Â 
As for his "dont touch my wives", it doesnt have to be anything related to blood purity...he's a selfish, greedy, horny bastard (literally), he wasnt even willing to share his food or drinks if you remember...do you think its unreasonable a man like that would be unwilling to share his wives who also happen to be his daughters (double reasons for protectiveness)
Â 

	Spoiler third...to whomever thinks Benjen Stark is Night's King...WW's were already attacking aggressively prior to start of book 1, that is what started Mance getting all of them together and those were the reports the NW got before Benjen went on the ranging to find out further information. How could he rise to the leadership of the WW in under 2 years?Â 
Â 
fourth...does anyone remember if ColdHands explained his motives for helping Bran (almost seemed like he was sent to get Bran from the Wall to BloodRaven, indicating BR somehow communicated with CH and gave him orders or a reason to do it...if that is the case, then the WW's want Bran on their side..unless CH went rouge and decided to help Bran since he might be able to beat the WW's....

Â 
Â 
I guess some of us feel it was spoiler material and others don't. If it's the same material we already knew from the books (as translated by the women of Craster's Keep about their sons) then it's not really spoiler material other than the visuals we were given which is all up to perspective and a whole lot of interpretation.Â 
Â 
I'm still really not sure how I feel about it all. I absolutely loved the visuals but at the same time it just seems to open a whole can of worms and "what if" speculation that of course I'm sure D&D were anticipating and George is just chuckling about because he's a sadistic writer like that anyways. We already know he gets a big kick out of working us all into a frenzy!
Â 
Edit: The only part we didn't know from Craster's wives was what happens to the sons physically after the White Walkers take them. We know they still 'live' somehow because the "brothers" come back for the babies - the wives / Mothers already know this part. The white walker taking the baby to the head honcho and him touching it's cheek and turning it into a White Walker too - that's the only part visually we didnt' know about... is that just a "Different interpretation" as hinted by George? Not really what happens or is never explained in the book?Â 
Â 
Did D&D just make that shit up??

2871	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	^^ im with you on this...from the interview with D&D it seemed like their interpretation on something GRRM said to them...I think (and hope) that it will be different in the books...
Before the episode people were speculating that Bran was seeing through the babies POV on the scene...D&D said they shot the scene from the babies POV on purpose to give it a more creepy vibe....so its possible at some point in the books Bran might actually see it through the babies POV see that scene without knowing its Crasters baby...I wouldn't call it a spoiler because while its similar the book could have its own way of showing it which is very different from the show

Â 
I'm quoting myself in a reply because my own remark just made a small revelation for me: Craster's wives knew their sons weren't being killed as sacrifices - hence their chanting "Gift to the Gods" ... the boys were a GIFT, not a sacrifice to be killed! In their eyes, this was definitely a better outcome for their sons than Craster killing them himself!Â 
Â 
I always wondered how all those women could live there all that time, so cowed by one fat old asshole like Craster and willingly hand over their babies. I mean, I guess the fighter in me would be the one to say "There's 12 of us to one of him, lets smack him over the head while he's passed out drunk and be done with him!" .... but the logic behind that is flawed....they'd be at the mercy of the White Walkers the same as every other wildling. These poor women willingly gave up their sons as 'gifts' so they, and their daughters could survive and live on.....Â 
Â 
Mind.Blown.
2873	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	^^ plus they were probably brainwashed from childhood to belive it is their duty towards they father/husband....takes abuse to a whole other level
2874	Envie	2014-05-02	^^ plus they were probably brainwashed from childhood to belive it is their duty towards they father/husband....takes abuse to a whole other level


Â 
Abuse by their Father/husband is nothing compared to the threat of the White Walkers should they stop providing a steady stream of sons ...Â
2875	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	Â 
Abuse by their Father/husband is nothing compared to the threat of the White Walkers should they stop providing a steady stream of sons ...Â 


Â 
without the abuse/brainwashing, they might have still decided to stage a coup or at least run away to join the other wildlings with Mance...the fear of WW might have made them ok to give up the sons, but the abuse is why they all stayed there under Craster, they must have felt it was their duty...
Â 
also explains why they not fighting back against the "fuck em till they dead!", all of them seemed to be more docile than expected from just a few days/weeks of the mutineers presence
Â 
i'm also remembering a scene when LC Mormont offered Craster shelter south of the Wall, crasters makes Gilly talk and she sort of parrots a spiel about being free is better than kneeling and other such crap that she clearly was programmed to say/believe
2876	Dirk blitzen	2014-05-02	Is anyone else completely terrified by the fact that the nights king is thousands of years old?  Wtf has he been doing for the past thousand years?!  I'd imagine if he plans on attacking the kingdoms... Then he's been planning it for thousands of years... And if that's true then the first men are screwed...

Â 
exactly my point! how in the world can 10-17 yrs old kids (arya, bran, jon, dany) possibly battle and succeed against a WW king who is a few thousand yrs old!Â 
Â 

	Spoiler think about it, if NK is actually the 13th LC...and jon is going to be the 998th, there were 985 LC's in between...lets assume that on avg each LC was there for 5yrs (probably much longer) thats still almost 5000yrs! 

Â 
if humanity is going to survive, they need some seriously badass warriors and off-the-chart brilliant war strategists! and that's on top of Drogon, Raeghal and Viseron at their best
2878	Littlefinger of the Hand	2014-05-02	As ygritte said to jon it is the wildlings that woke the whitewalkers during their search for the horn that could blow away the Wall. If this is true then the NK is asleep or imprisoned for thousands of years unable to threaten the south.

Â«Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m crying because we never found the Horn of Winter. We opened half a hundred graves and let all those shades loose in the world, and never found the Horn of Joramun to bring this cold thing down!Â»

Â 
good point! i forgot about that part...
Â 
but didn't she also say Mance found the Horn while we found out later that he never did? makes me doubt how accurate her info really is...
Â 
still that would explain where the WW's have been for 8000 yrs!
2881	Littlefinger of the Hand	2014-05-02	Excactly. Ygritte is just a soldier(even if she feels she is equal to all) and knows only what she is allowed to know.
2882	Nucky Thompson	2014-05-02	What if the Oathkeeper from the episode title doesn't refer to the sword, but to Craster's oath that is being kept (even by the mutineers who had annexed his 'keep')?

2883	Littlefinger of the Hand	2014-05-02	That whould apply on the book version where the WW attacked the Keep as soon as it was annexed. In the preview of s4e5 we get a glimpse of Jon attacking the Keep himshelf
2884	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-02	This scene was honestly the most embarrassing in the series so far. More embarrassing than Shae's fake crying.
Â 
How incredibly hokey did that WW look. I could not believe they chose that to be on the set of such a respected TV show.
Â 
If this were Thor or some other shlock, that design would have been fine. It was cartoonish. The WW already really weren't the best with their gandalf-ish looks and wrinkled skin.
Â 
I am OK with the show getting past the books since I figure Martin really doesn't give a crap about getting the rest of the books out. He's got his money.
Â 
I am not OK with them making characters look like they belong on a kids show.Â 
Â 
I mean, can you imagine this guy walking up to Stannis, and Stannis' face? It would be laughable.
Â 
They toned down basically everything else in the show as far as fantasy, and then this guy pops up on screen and is like "I will make you a snowman!!!"
Â 
Who designed this guy? He was horrible.

Â 
Haha your critique made me laugh, well said! I will admit I never liked the way they chose to make the white walkers look, visually. I realize they can't afford to do a lot more fancy CGI stuff since they're already doing that with the dragons and direwolves, but the makeup and effects they did choose are not at all like they were described in the book. The head honcho guy does look a bit like an "Ice Maul" character straight out of a sci fi or horror flick or even an old 80s fantasy film (Labyrinth anyone?).
Â 
White Walkers were supposed to look really bizarre and 'otherworldly' - scary but not in a horror / creepy way but rather, in a strange alien way.

I mean, can you imagine this guy walking up to Stannis, and Stannis' face? It would be laughable.
Â 
They toned down basically everything else in the show as far as fantasy, and then this guy pops up on screen and is like "I will make you a snowman!!!"
Â 
Who designed this guy? He was horrible.


Â 
most people were disappointed with the way D&D chose to make the WW look from the first glimpse in s2...i agree with you that they look like a cartoon or kids version of how they were described in the book. but its been almost 2 yrs, i have made my peace with them looking the way they do on the show...not happy, but content...

I'm quoting myself in a reply because my own remark just made a small revelation for me: Craster's wives knew their sons weren't being killed as sacrifices - hence their chanting "Gift to the Gods" ... the boys were a GIFT, not a sacrifice to be killed! In their eyes, this was definitely a better outcome for their sons than Craster killing them himself!Â 


A 'gift' to the Gods can still be a sacrifice costing a life.

2888	Tyranno	2014-05-02	People speculate that the White Walkers from the episode are the Nights King (confirmed more or less) and either the LC's of the NW or the Last Hero and the guys who went with him.Â 
They also speculate that the baby got turned into a WW, just like the other babies.Â 
Â 
That does raise the question, where did the original WW come from? They were there before the Nights Watch and before the Last Hero. And if the WW's we saw aren't them, where are they?

Aye, but in books, the women know the "brothers" come for the baby. They know they are the babies' brothers.
2890	Envie	2014-05-02	A 'gift' to the Gods can still be a sacrifice costing a life.


Â 
Yes that's true but not in this case. The wives were quoted (from the books) saying "The brothers will be comin' for him!" about Gilly's baby. Â So they clearly already knew the babies were not being killed.
2891	Crow'sEye	2014-05-02	Â 
Haha your critique made me laugh, well said! I will admit I never liked the way they chose to make the white walkers look, visually. I realize they can't afford to do a lot more fancy CGI stuff since they're already doing that with the dragons and direwolves, but the makeup and effects they did choose are not at all like they were described in the book. The head honcho guy does look a bit like an "Ice Maul" character straight out of a sci fi or horror flick or even an old 80s fantasy film (Labyrinth anyone?).
Â 
White Walkers were supposed to look really bizarre and 'otherworldly' - scary but not in a horror / creepy way but rather, in a strange alien way.


I think the Urskeks would have been a good place to start. Or other Froud work.

2892	Tytus	2014-05-02	This scene was honestly the most embarrassing in the series so far. More embarrassing than Shae's fake crying.
Â 
How incredibly hokey did that WW look. I could not believe they chose that to be on the set of such a respected TV show.
Â 
If this were Thor or some other shlock, that design would have been fine. It was cartoonish. The WW already really weren't the best with their gandalf-ish looks and wrinkled skin.
Â 
I am OK with the show getting past the books since I figure Martin really doesn't give a crap about getting the rest of the books out. He's got his money.
Â

I thought he more represented Martin's description than the other WWs we've seen so far, aside from the horns which did look silly.
Then again this is a show with dragons in it. Is it more ridiculous than their appearance? I don't know.
What I do know is a bottom-up view is not the most flattering angle for anyone. Maybe he'll look better next time.

It might be interpreted that the wives thought the WWs coming were brothers of the babes, or not. It's not definitive.
2895	salmonsnake	2014-05-02	Or that the Others under the rule of Night's King, along with the 'turned' babies, are brothers in the same sense the humans under the rule of Night's Watch are brothers.

How can you say this passage, from the book, is not definitive?
Â 
"If you don't take him,Â theyÂ will.""They?" said Sam, and the raven cocked its black head and echoed, "They. They. They."Â "The boy's brothers," said the old woman on the left.

That does raise the question, where did the original WW come from? They were there before the Nights Watch and before the Last Hero. And if the WW's we saw aren't them, where are they?


Â 
theres toooooo much unknown about the WW...i mean even believing old nan's tales that 13th LC banged a WW and became NK, like you said, doesnt explain where the WW came from in the first place...
Â 
"Leaf" the "child of the forest" down with Bran and BR might know...they were there first inhabitants of westeros, before men....they should know...or maybe Bran will find the answer in the trees...
Â 
btw, i think this was a perfect description of what people expected to see in the show -Â 
Â 
Others - a mysterious and apparently malevolent race of creatures found beyond the Wall. They have only been seen at night, and seem to bring unnatural cold with them. They appear as tall, gaunt humanoids with eyes of blue so deep it burns like fire. They wear armor that shifts in color with every step, and wield thin crystal swords that are so cold they can shatter iron. Others move silently, but their voices sound like cracking ice. Creatures they kill reanimate as wights, undead zombies with glowing blue eyes. The Others exhibit a weakness to weapons made of dragonglass, which will pierce their armour easily. In death, they seem to melt into a pool of extremely cold liquid.

Apparently they'd already met their CGI budget for the previous season with dragons and direwolves so we got wrinkly old corpse dudes instead.
2900	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	Ok, in regards to the way The Others look and are portrayed. I'm not disappointed, but im not ecstatic. I think the pale rider, looked better, than the night's king. However, this is the way they portray them. Come to terms with it, amicably. They are, a different race. They look different. Definitely alien, in a way. I accept difference for what it is, he's not meant to be horrifying, this isnt the walking dead, he's a different race. It's a fantasy series. I get that.
Â 
Aging is apparent, when we talk about The Turning. They clearly, arent immortal. Or, they are, but experience deterioration. That's why they look so decrepid. Perhaps the less aged they are, the more "beautiful" they appear. It's also possible, that they experience rapid aging, due to the fact that their very being is magical and would take a lot of effort to keep up (take note Martin's opinions of magic and what it takes to shape them, and the sacrifices it takes to maintain glamours and such).
Â 
As magical beings, perhaps the fleshly body decays, but the spirit grows.
Â 
This baby, may be like, 6 years old at the end of next episode. Or, maybe not. We don't know.
Â 
I'm beginning to believe though, this may not have been Craster's original doing. It may have been he was forced to live in the manner he did due to his blood. Blackmail, in a sort of way. Thats why i think he went all defensive with his daughterwives. It would corrupt the cycle. It would disrupt the blood if it were contaminated with the seed of someone else, and for that The Others may have retaliated and known. It's possible not all babies would survive The Turning, if they werent full blooded Craster (due to an ingredient in the blood composition, kings blood, or first men blood, or both).
Â 
Think of a drug deal gone bad. "You gave us bad shit." "Oh, uh, that batch was oregano, my bad."
Â 
In regards to the baby surviving travel in the cold. It is frequently rumored that Others and Wights affect the immediate atmosphere around them. I'm not confirming this, but it identifies to me for the time being) that it's possible that an Other, or a Wight, may be able to absorb the immediate temperature around them, thus making the surrounding air warmer while they get colder (ghost theories, "cold spots"), also, (Winterfell, warm walls, etc [what IS down there in winterfell's crypts??]). Now if this ability can be controlled, then i place the logic that absorbing the cold around them would be the effect of "powering up" if we could use that terminology, and thus be able to exert that coldness when needed (like when the immediate atmosphere gets colder)
Â 
Whether or not that statement is at all accurate or not doesnt concern me at this point. I too, will be on board the "let's pick apart the logistics of a baby travelling in icy winter" at some point, but because i dont know much about The Others as of yet, im refuse to be bothered by it for the sheer possibilities that can be.

Â 
See my post earlier on. The title of the 10th episode is, "The Children." I for one, dont believe they mean the Children Of The Forest regarding Bran/Bloodraven. I think, this'll be a big episode involving The Others whose father they call Craster, The Children.

i dont mind the wrinkles so much...but the way they move, i always pictured much more fluid and graceful, like almost smoke...do you remember the first fight scene in book 1 prologue? the way they materialize out of nowhere, the way they fight...these guys just look like bad puppets with rough, jerking movements like they aren't used to moving or have stiff joints or something...

2903	Areo Speedwagon	2014-05-02	A lot of interesting discussions here.Â  Been lurking through almost every page of this and the older thread.
Â 
It just struck me that there might be a connection between what we've seen from Craster, the Others and the part of the Night's Watch vow about "fathering no children."
Â 
What if the two are related?Â  As in, maybe it wasn't always in the vows, but kids kept getting taken or offered so they added it.Â  Or maybe the founders of the Watch knew about the transformation process and put that condition in the vow.
Â 
Thought as I was typing - what if it that condition was added after the NK was purged from The Wall since that's the guy (maybe) we saw do the transforming?

That's all you need to do. It's the show, it's not the books. They aren't horror icons, they're fantasy villains. it's the design of their racial features as stated by D&D, not George.

The Night's Watch we have today... is that the 14th lord commander's vision of the nights watch? 13th and prior nights watch might have had completely different values, and this is further bolstered by the fact that their libraries information doesnt reach that far back, that it was confirmed that all the information regarding the nights king and earlier -- was destroyed. why?

They're disrupting the bloodline. If any of those girls get pregnant (which some of them most likely will), their blood will be impure.

It's hard for me to see the Others (the true demonic things of primal cold) as something other than completely unnatural, even ethereal - their "swords" can shatter common steel. Their "voice" sounds like cracking ice.
Â 
The wights (frozen dead men) are pretty common stock, but the thing Sam (was supposed to have) killed was so far beyond them that it makes him amazing just for having slain one. I suppose there are limits to what the show can do in terms of the look of them.
Â 
My main hope is that the show can (increasingly) clearly show the difference between these two sorts of beings, making the Others seem like the existential menace to all life that they really are.

Are they though? They have a social hierarchy based on this episode, and they have a purpose. Is it really mindless spawning of an army to conquer westeros? Or is it something more...
Â 
While it certainly is possible, that The Night's King is the be-all-end-all supervillain with just a desire to conquer for his own means, come on now, the clues are there. His name cant be spoken. Who is he? His histories were erased from libraries, so all we have to go on, is the word of the Night's Watch, 14th Lord Commander and latter. Why?
Â 
There's more to it than that id think, man. Something's not right here, and the lines between "good" and "evil" are constantly blurred, and even just one bit of information, one little secret, can make him justified and his purpose noble.

Regardless, I think you're right on.Â  A major correction in the "mission statement" of the NW may have taken place after the 13th.Â  And the scrubbing of more than just the 13th LCs name is very suspect...
Â 
But what if it's more drastic than that?Â  I've read it theorized on these boards that maybe that Lightbringer is a metaphor for the NW.Â  It was also theorized somewhere in the first thread that maybe the Others, in fact, built the Wall.Â  if that's the case, maybe the NW was an eff-ed up organization made up of Others, hybrids, and wights and all the stories of the Last Hero was actually the 14th LC and the last 12 members that hadn't been turned?Â  I guess this would make the story of the NK a metaphor for the Watch as a whole under those first 13 commanders. Â 
Â 
I'll stop now as I'm just typing as I think.Â  Would like your (and anyone's) input.Â  But, to me, this is maybe a little "cleaner" (for lack of a better word) explanation of the presence of the 12 blurry figures behind the horned guy from the last episode.Â  Again, earlier it was theorized that those were the Last Hero's companions and the LH himself may have brokered a peace with the Others as opposed to defeating them.Â  That's a great idea, well thought out and certainly fits with the mythology, but no means am i saying what i wrote is right and that's wrong.Â  Just an "other" idea.Â  Maybe I just want a little too much to see Jon Snow happy for once and am in denial about his fate...Â

Â 
i dont buy the importance of Crasters bloodline...
Â 
first, crasters being siring sons for how long would you say, 30yrs, 40 at the most? WW have been around for thousands...assuming they were imprisoned or hibernating for a few millenniums, are you saying they have been back for 30-40 yrs and growing their army as slowly as waiting for craster to knock up his daughters? that seems quite weak of the WW to put all the hopes and future of their race on a drunken bastard like Craster...so following that logic, if any of the NW happened to find this out, all they would need to do is kill craster few decades ago (which even mormont could have done since he knew craster was giving up the sons) and boom, end of WW army! its honestly ridiculous to think Craster's bloodline is important enought to be the only single source of increasing WW numbers!
Â 
second, unless craster had his first son and daughter with his sister (to which there is no reference off, since at least one of the daughters would have referred to the mother as "mother/aunt") the bloodline cannot be that pure to begin with...cuz think about it...he's not fuking his great-granddaugthers...at the max its granddaugthers...so wife, daughter, granddaugter.... basic biology, 2 generations are not enough to "purify" a bloodline and make some genes/traits wipe out others...
Â 
its much simpler than all of that...WW's go around to different wildlings and kidnap their sons and leave the rest of the family unharmed...some wildlings figure that if they keep sacrificing their sons, they will be left unharmed...but remember, most wildlings are not as savage or evil as the southerners think...most refuse, only truly despicable creatures like craster would save his own ass by giving up dozens of sons/children...

Â 
I wouldn't, we're getting good shit done here. Let's keep this up.
Â 
The Wall, other than the keeps and forts, is essentially made of ice.
Â 
Well, how is that possible? Only one race can control/exert/bring ice/possibly control it's formation (like a cryomancer theory).
Â 
Bran The Builder = an Other? Not The Night's King, but a separate Other?
Â 
Inversely, perhaps the Wall was erected by an Other, however Bran The Builder took credit for building it when he constructed keeps and forts all over it. It may have been just a wall of ice, and he saw this wall and thought, "hmm, let's build stuff on that big wall."

Also, what if it's some cosmic pre-condition of the magic itself?Â  Such as "only death can pay for life," or magic requiring sacrifice of some kind.Â  What if the WWs can only transform those that have been willfully given?Â  That would certainly cap the rate at which they can reproduce.
Â 
Further, what if it's the inverse of the above?Â  Since the Others utilize necromancy, "only life can pay for (living) death."

2917	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	That dismissal could be very very compelling if we could assume he didn't simply continue something that someone else began. His father and mother remain unknown, the former assumed to have been a NW ranger at some point, but this isn't a certainty either.


Â 
Thats why further back I went into Whitetree readings, where his mother was supposedly from. They literally found nothing there, like the rest of the wildling villages, when they went on the Great Ranging. However, and this is soemthign to note, George included Craster's mom's village in text, and didnt include the other three before this village. Why? What's there? What so important, wed include it in text, and not any other village?
Â 
The only other thing worth mentioning? The weirwood tree with jagged teeth, and inside it, were burned bones of wildlings, placed there. Sacrifice? maybe. Who knows. But they were burned. Burned, yet still offered, at least to the weirwood tree (Children Of The Forest?)
Â 
This sacrificing, or giving away of children... Is it a form of payment? Payment for something? The Others might have performed a task, in exchange for a certain form of currency, thus being a sacrifice of sorts. And if they dont receive payment, they get pissed.
2918	Crow'sEye	2014-05-02	I think the magic in GRR's world works like the magic in the Discworld. It cannot truly create, but it can shift energy around, so we need the death of the witch, the kid and the husband to get the three dragons, and we need the babies to get the new WWs.
Â 
Mance has no lineage to speak of that we know of, but his blood is King's blood by the power of his actions.
2919	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	Â 
Â 
i dont buy the importance of Crasters bloodline...
Â 
first, crasters being siring sons for how long would you say, 30yrs, 40 at the most? WW have been around for thousands...assuming they were imprisoned or hibernating for a few millenniums, are you saying they have been back for 30-40 yrs and growing their army as slowly as waiting for craster to knock up his daughters? that seems quite weak of the WW to put all the hopes and future of their race on a drunken bastard like Craster...so following that logic, if any of the NW happened to find this out, all they would need to do is kill craster few decades ago (which even mormont could have done since he knew craster was giving up the sons) and boom, end of WW army! its honestly ridiculous to think Craster's bloodline is important enought to be the only single source of increasing WW numbers!
Â 
second, unless craster had his first son and daughter with his sister (to which there is no reference off, since at least one of the daughters would have referred to the mother as "mother/aunt") the bloodline cannot be that pure to begin with...cuz think about it...he's not fuking his great-granddaugthers...at the max its granddaugthers...so wife, daughter, granddaugter.... basic biology, 2 generations are not enough to "purify" a bloodline and make some genes/traits wipe out others...
Â 
its much simpler than all of that...WW's go around to different wildlings and kidnap their sons and leave the rest of the family unharmed...some wildlings figure that if they keep sacrificing their sons, they will be left unharmed...but remember, most wildlings are not as savage or evil as the southerners think...most refuse, only truly despicable creatures like craster would save his own ass by giving up dozens of sons/children...


Â 
It's not Craster's blood, persay. It's what's IN Craster's blood. If we're going to open up the door to other wildlings (see Whitetree), then I'd like to assume not all wildlings are or royal lineage. I have to believe perhaps the ingredient is First Men Blood. That would be a gateway to all sorts of wildlings paying tribute. This would also satisfy your theory as well as mine, since They clearly go to others other than Craster.
Â 
The Others are connected with First Men some way.
Â 
"We'll build this wall, made of ice. For both of our kinds, fine. I never want to see the people of the south ever again, either. We'll make this wall of ice, but in return, we want one child per (timeframe) as payment. This agreement continues for as long as the Wall is up."
Â 
Just thinking outside the box for a moment haha
2920	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-02	Â 
Are they though? They have a social hierarchy based on this episode, and they have a purpose. Is it really mindless spawning of an army to conquer westeros? Or is it something more...
Â 


Â 
Â 
Â 
Who's to say that is indicative of a social hierarchy?Â  People assume that what they saw was literally the Night King. (perhaps the crown-like horns?)
Â 
That may have been simply a revealing of The Others in their bodily form - more demonic, less of a rotting corpse in look.
Â 
In any case, the Night King (in the books) was not one of the Others, but some NW commander who was seduced by some icy demoness (almost certainly one of the Others), sold her his soul, and then begat all kinds of unholy atrocities, until the King of Winter and King Beyond the Wall destroyed him.
2921	Areo Speedwagon	2014-05-02	Â 
I wouldn't, we're getting good shit done here. Let's keep this up.
Â 
The Wall, other than the keeps and forts, is essentially made of ice.
Â 
Well, how is that possible? Only one race can control/exert/bring ice/possibly control it's formation (like a cryomancer theory).
Â 
Bran The Builder = an Other? Not The Night's King, but a separate Other?
Â 
Inversely, perhaps the Wall was erected by an Other, however Bran The Builder took credit for building it when he constructed keeps and forts all over it. It may have been just a wall of ice, and he saw this wall and thought, "hmm, let's build stuff on that big wall."


Ha!
Â 
And yeah, White men taking credit for the work of others is certainly nothing new.Â  I kid, but not really.Â  But what would this say of Storms End?Â  Unrelated but worth keeping on the back burner.Â  My previous thoughts on building the Wall was that if it truly was thousands of years old, then little by little, it would be very possible.Â  But knowing there is magic inhered into the Wall itself?Â  Maybe something else is going on.Â 
Â 
And the "watchers on the walls" also refers to people having been buried in the wall itself.Â  Right?Â  Or was that a theory i read on the boards that i've turned into something from the books?Â

Â 
Now wait a minute, wait a second here.
Â 
We're going by the word of HBO app, which may or may not have even been accurate to BEGIN with (i think it was, it seemed shady enought o be accurate).
Â 
That being said.
Â 
There were 13. The leader (hereby assumed, The Night's King)Â turned a living being. That living being became an Other.
Â 
Based on logic, living beings become Others, dead beings become Wights.
Â 
There are thousands of Wights. There were 13 Others (that appeared).
Â 
My point is this, in regards to your statement:
Â 
It's stated in the wiki, that The Night's King fell in love with an Other, and when he gave her his seed, he turned. I'm assuming, that's the moment, she turned him (the wiki states thats when he sold his soul, through that unholy union, so I'm basing this off of that). He was an Other, when the Night's Watch exiled him. That's what drove them to exile him. The fact he turned. He actually ruled The Night's Watch as king through the Nightfort for 13 (there's that number, YET again, it seems) years before being exiled with that female Other as his Queen.
Â 
There's a lot of 13 here.. 13th lord commander (12 before him), reigning as king for 13 years, last hero was one and 12 others (13), and there were 13 of those Others at the end of the last episode. It all appears to be connected, 13 is a sacred number.
Â 
If we're going to assume there are more than 13 Others, which as of this point is not confirmed (again, we never saw them in full force, this is the most we've seen so far) than the follow this social hierarchy: The Night's King, his 12 higher companions present at The Turning (i call it that, it's my term, i should trademark it), however many Others there are outside that circle, then Wights. Id say thats a social pyramid.
Â 
If we're going to throw the assumption those 13 are The Night's King (as the Last Hero), and his 12 companions, which may or may not be the first 12 Lord Commanders before him, and there are only 13 of them, there'd still be social hierarchical difference between the King, his Circle, and the Wights.
2923	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-02	Â 
The number 13 there might be only a coincidence or a small reference to that guy being the 13th LC, the NK: something for us readers to know who he is, while Unsullied simply saw him as "White Walker boss". Because I'm sure that Craster has given the others more than 13 sons. I'm a bit lazy to do the maths now, but he had 19 wives. at some point, he might have had at least 10 of them in fertile state in one year. That means that in a year, he could have gotten 10 babies. If half of them were male, then in a year, he probably got 5 sons. And for how long has he being doing this? Gilly is around 15, isn't she? So, ten years of banging 10 women would give more than 13 sons.
Â 
I'm sure either way that Craster's son is a special case. Those Others are "brothers" (half brothers but that doesn't matter). They have their blood "pure" in the same way the Targaryens had. I mean, their mother's had their father's blood. That could mean not something important for the "Ice" part of the equation but for the sons themselves, like, they have a strong bond or connection to each other, in the same way all the Stark kids (even Jon who might not be Ned's son) can warg and probably, will learn to communicate to each other in that way. They were able to locate Gilly's baby, it seems. Maybe they're able to see and feel each other due to their blood, something not all the Others can.


Maybe Craster had to produce 13 sons per year?
2924	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-02	Maybe Craster had to produce 13 sons per year?


Â 
Doubt it. He probably started with less women. It was impossible for him to produce 13 sons. Even if he had 13 children, one of them could have been a daughter.
2925	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	Not for nothing, you know how in the books Gilly took Mance's kid? To Old Town? And her baby was left at the Wall?
Â 
The Wall currently owns the tribute that was supposedto have been given to The Others...
Â 
If, in Jon's blasphemy, Melisandre should sacrifice that baby to R'hllor, thinking it having King's Blood (Mance's, because as of yet she doesn't know they were switched), then she'd be sacrificing something that belongs to The Others, to R'hllor. Taking something from, The Great Other, and giving it, to R'hllor.

If D&D are determined to troll us with unpublished implications, a single wretched 'stallion' left alive at the Keep, (when we are not simply relying on Coldhands) might serve as a hint whether the women are of sole importance, not Craster (or his father.)

I'd believe, the Others have nothing to do with the impending massacre about to occur at Craster's Keep.
Â 
Whether or not that's Coldhands comign to the rescue, saving Bran/Jojen/Meera, and escorting them to Bloodraven..
Â 
..or it's Jon and The Night's Watch saving them.

I dont htink it'll be The Others.

2929	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-02	^^ im with you on this...from the interview with D&D it seemed like their interpretation on something GRRM said to them...I think (and hope) that it will be different in the books...
Before the episode people were speculating that Bran was seeing through the babies POV on the scene...D&D said they shot the scene from the babies POV on purpose to give it a more creepy vibe....so its possible at some point in the books Bran might actually see it through the babies POV see that scene without knowing its Crasters baby...I wouldn't call it a spoiler because while its similar the book could have its own way of showing it which is very different from the show


This is a multibillion dollar enterprise GRRM and D&D created. No one is making any mistakes.
2930	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	Forming crackpot theory:
Â 
Melisandre botches a R'hllorian resurrection of Jon Snow, using a false baby (Craster's First Men-blooded baby, and not king's blood from Mance) as sacrifice to bring him back. The baby belonged to The Others, not R'hllor. Because this is an agreement, there is interference.
Â 
Laid out Jon Snow, with his blade resting in his arms as often funeral ceremonies show,Â gets resurrected, as an Other, inadvertantly, and kills Melisandre with his sword, Longclaw. Because Melisandre is also a magical being, when Other Jon impales Melisandre, his coldened blade hits her warm, radiant flesh, it sends a spark through the blade and the blade itself takes flame.
Â 
Irony at it's finest, Melisandre gets killed, by Azor Ahai reborn, an Other.

See my post earlier on. The title of the 10th episode is, "The Children." I for one, dont believe they mean the Children Of The Forest regarding Bran/Bloodraven. I think, this'll be a big episode involving The Others whose father they call Craster, The Children.


I think "The Children" has a multiple meaning - CotF, maybe Craster's sons, but also children of someone who may not be with us at the time.

If you really believe they do anything without George's blessing, you are naive. Especially a spoiler. There are contracts there that are worth a lot. GRRM said many times that when he writes, what's important for him is to get from A to B. He doesn't know in advance which road he will take in his creative process. But, what he knows are the main stopping points on the journey. What we saw was a stopping point. That must be coordinated. Stories like introduction of Talisa or Bran being at Craster's don't alter the main arc of the story. The scene far north with the Others is not such a scene. It has to be accurate.

Â 
im just hoping GRRM will take a different and better path while depicting something about the Land of Always Winter in the books...since they cannot show crasters baby POV or ColdHands POV or any other character following them and seeing without being seen...if there is something about NK or that scene in the book, the most logical choice is Bran seeing through the babies POV...in that case, its a safe bet that GRRM's depiction of that scene might quite different and hopefully better just like every other WW scene in books have been superior to shows (except maybe sam's...that might have been on par)Â

That was me who said Labyrinth and I think you misunderstood what I meant. I was concurring that the way they made the Night's King (or whatever he was) look reminded me of something you'd see in a fantasy film from that early 80s time era (Legend, Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, etc) and NOT a more modern fantasy with dark undertones. I mean 'modern' to say it's been written recently not took place recently.  Â In fact his appearance wasn't that far off from Darth Maul (hence the Ice Maul reference) from recent Star Wars episodes. I wasn't really trying to be overly critical... I actually love ALL those films and the creatures / beings in them. I was simply saying the way they've done the White Walkers wasn't as I had hoped or imagined they would look in response to someone else before me who I quoted and was critical of their looks.

I agree this naming thing is important. Name is a taboo for the Great Other, Night's King and all babies north of the Wall at least for the first 2 years. Does that mean that if you name them, you know their location immediately?

Maybe that's the missing ingredient! Not First Men blood, but Bastard blood.

GRRM has already mentioned no new POV's in remaining 2 books. I based it on that. Also, I believe if they were going to do a WW POV, they would have during the prologue of first book, or during sam's scene...i highly doubt they will suddenly start POV of a new character who happens to be of possibly a different species! then why not introduce POV of a dragon?Â 
Â 
i have never thought D&D did such a scene without GRRM's approval and neither have i mentioned anything of that kind. since you are convinced to think me naive, i will cease to argue with you about this and allow you to think and judge as you will.
Â 
despite your claim that you understood me perfectly well, you clearly have not. my point was simply that i am hoping GRRM's description of the scene (if it is there at all) will be different and possibly better than in the show. For the record, I was very happy and impressed with the scene in the show. I was just disagreeing with those who seem convinced that this is a big spoiler from the next book.Â

Wait, what?
Â 
Craster wasn't a noble, and his wives / daughters were just wildlings. How does that make his sons bastards?


Â 
theyr enot legit, are they? i mean, if youre not married in the eyes of gods and men, which, for all we know, is one single person. right? legally you cant have more than one wife unless that one dies. no?
Â 
...and, maybe he does have noble blood. we dont know who his father and mother were

hmmm... this is an interesting point, and i never got the correlation until just now. Why cant they name there babies before 2?
Â 
"Dont you dare name that baby, Jon Snow!" before she leaves


Â 
i thought they dont name the babies before 2 because they are "free folk" who believe baby has right name to itself? i remember Gilly saying that to Jon, but doesnt Ygritte mention something along those lines about the freedom to name itself?Â
2949	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	Think of it, they're called, The Others.
Â 
inadvertantly, it kind of makes sense, the "other" child. we'll just give him away

In westeros, the term 'bastard' really only applies to the nobles not commoners. Being born 'out of wedlock' doesn't make you a bastard. Besides, as far as we know, Craster did marry all of his wives with whatever wildling Â or other (see what I did there) ceremony he felt like using. "Bastards" are the children of kings and lords with title. Nobody seems to really care if common folk have kids out of wedlock enough to label them or give them special names.

But dude, if he has royal/noble blood, wouldnt that authenticate the children as bastards?

You're reaching back into crackpot theory territory there. I can't really add 'bastard' theory of Jon Snow onto an already fabricated theory we have no real proof of yet. One one crackpot theory allowed at a time please!Â

And it won't be the last time either, I'm sure!  My point was (perhaps made too sarcastically) was that you had said something along the lines of maybe Jon was somehow connected to the others because he was a bastard and then how Craster's kids were all bastards too... which is getting confusing because we don't have any proof that Craster has noble or king's blood (though I did find the theory interesting and less 'crackpot'' than some others I've seen).Â 
Â 
Aaaanyways, it's all gotten very confusing now by the second thread already in it's 7th page and still no real proof of anything. For all we know, D&D pulled that whole scene right out of their butts as to laying a magical clawed finger on the baby's cheek and all that. George may have never mentioned anything at all about it. They read the passage I quoted from the book and decided to create 'what happens to the babies' straight out of their imaginations. All we know for certain is that they don't die or get eaten... this was confirmed by the wives/daughters of Craster. We assume they become White Walkers / Others. D&D assumed the same thing and created that whole ending scene based off their assumptions. MAYBE. We may never know if George rubber stamped that scene or not. He's not saying.

Â 
Yeah, youve got a point. Still, youre still reading this. Every word that im typing. Every. Single. One. And that's what makes this thread interesting.
Â 
There's some merit behind it though. It would give definition and origin to the very name, "Others." The other child, the one nobody wants. We'll give it away, to the gods.
Â 
My only ideas behind Jon's connecting with them, is that, yes, he has bastard's blood regardless of his parentage, but id think if this theory has ANY merit, he'd be a beacon to them. He has bastard's blood, noble blood, and first men blood. He's what they want, if you think about it.
Â 
Now i could be, and very well will be, very wrong about all this. It adds up though. Somehow, in my head, it's making sense. And after 1132 posts im TIRED.
Â 
and if there's some way, to make the story happen where every child Craster creates is a bastard, it would further support it. Give away the boys, keep the female bastards, to create more.
Â 
Â 
Regardless of a half-assed crackpot theory that just was created before your very eyes 40 minutes ago, i think we all could agree:
Â 
it COULD be bastard's blood (dont care, find me evidence that specifically proves it ISNT)
or
it could be first men blood
Â 
it's something. something makes these kids important.

Yes I'm still reading. I never said the debate should end, just that it was getting confusing with all the wild theories flying! 
Â 
As for Jon being the 'perfect thing' they are looking for ... touching into still more theories - wouldn't Jon's possible royal blood (if R+L=J is true) be more of a factor than being a bastard? He would technically be both. But I'm still not sure why being a bastard is important in your theory anyways. LOL.Â

Â 
well, bastard's blood is tainted blood. it symbolizes corruption. cheating. they say it's traitorous, lustful, sinful. right?
Â 
my idea only hit because the "other" children becoming "Others" seemed to fit. Add in craster's children may all be bastards, the "other" children, it hit hard.
Â 
i too dont like the direction this went
2962	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	still, i gotta admit. a shirt with Craster's face that says, "I went to Craster's Keep and all I got was one of Craster's Bastards" is an INGENIUS marketing plan!

I'm going to go away and be angsty that we'll probably never know the truth about the Others, R'hLOL or whatever he's called and who is important or not until George finishes the damn books.

break out the marilyn manson cd!
Â 
shying away from bastard blood theory.
Â 
it's something in the children. something in the blood. something that craster, and the wildlings at whitetree know about, and other wildlings to take part in the ritual. something Jeor Mormont knew about. the daughters know about.
Â 
"I gotta make right with the Old Gods" he said. well, what did he do wrong in the first place? ...unless..... Craster's a BASTARD HIMSELF 
Â 
no but seriously.
Â 
we know The Night's King did this ritual too, per the wiki. and if it's been going on for THAT long, this is a measure that sustains their life.

i truly believe GRRM eitherÂ 
1) wants to die before book 7, thereby immortalizing himself and his legacy
2) has very little idea of how to finish the books...

there is a third option...that is pulling a bill gates and already has book 7 completed but just milking the series for all its worth (like Vista) before releasing the last book (win 7)Â

Not in accordance to the ways of the Wildlings. After all, the Free Folk's version of a wedding is stealing a woman! The laws of the "kneelers" hold absolutely no meaning to the "Free Folk" beyond the Wall.

As far as I know, Craster's always been seen as a Wildling, yep. Then again, I've only read the books twice so far, so don't take my word for it.

I don't disagree. Not too sure if any regular human babe wouldn't do for the WWs, though...
2972	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-02	Not for nothing, you know how in the books Gilly took Mance's kid? To Old Town? And her baby was left at the Wall?
Â 
The Wall currently owns the tribute that was supposedto have been given to The Others...
Â 
If, in Jon's blasphemy, Melisandre should sacrifice that baby to R'hllor, thinking it having King's Blood (Mance's, because as of yet she doesn't know they were switched), then she'd be sacrificing something that belongs to The Others, to R'hllor. Taking something from, The Great Other, and giving it, to R'hllor.


Â 
Dun dun dun.
Â 
I don't necessarily know if you're on the right track, or even if I think you're on the right track.
Â 
But I want you to be on the right track, because I love the implications of this.
Â 
Â 


Forming crackpot theory:
Â 
Melisandre botches a R'hllorian resurrection of Jon Snow, using a false baby (Craster's First Men-blooded baby, and not king's blood from Mance) as sacrifice to bring him back. The baby belonged to The Others, not R'hllor. Because this is an agreement, there is interference.
Â 
Laid out Jon Snow, with his blade resting in his arms as often funeral ceremonies show,Â gets resurrected, as an Other, inadvertantly, and kills Melisandre with his sword, Longclaw. Because Melisandre is also a magical being, when Other Jon impales Melisandre, his coldened blade hits her warm, radiant flesh, it sends a spark through the blade and the blade itself takes flame.
Â 
Irony at it's finest, Melisandre gets killed, by Azor Ahai reborn, an Other.

If bloodlines do come into play, there's more chances of men mixing with CotF, giving them greenseers and wargs...their magic counteracts the magic of WW's...evidence is the wall and BR's cave...I say again, Crasters blood cannot be relevant

Â 
I've always gotten the impression that the in-universe maxim of "there's power in King's Blood" to be only half true.
Â 
After all, what makes it King's blood?Â  Cuz there's a lot of folks calling themselves kings now, who weren't "born" kings, who have kids of their own.Â  When does.Â  Does Theon have King's Blood retroactively because Balon crowned himself?Â  Did the Starks stop having kings blood when Torrhen knelt?Â  Did it get re-promoted when Robb crowned himself?
Â 
There's magic in blood, period.Â  Only death can pay for life.
Â 
Or maybe it's the Valyrian / First Men connection that gives the blood its magic properties, and thus the Starks and Targaryens have mojo whether they were ever crowned or not (in fact, the mojo probably gave them the advantage in conflicts that led to them being crowned, and "power in King's Blood" actually has the chicken and egg in the wrong order  )

Very good points...iv never believed in "power in king's blood"...I definitely agree "only death can pay for life"....Targs have power in their blood from the magic of old valyria...Starks have it from the First men which likely came from the Children of the Forest
Melisandre burning the leeches worked (at times I like to believe it was one of her R'hollors true powers) because of the Targ blood Baratheons are said to have...Starks warging and greenseers are clear indication of CotF magic...Jojen has it probably like other northerners because they too mixed with CotF like the Starks...i have a theory that its stronger and more noticeable in the starks because the direwolves somehow brought the connection to their magic out...
Dany's magic combination of Valyrian blood plus "only death can pay for life" brought 3 dragons to life...im sure over the yrs plenty of others tried to hatch dragon eggs like Euron, at least one or more must have tried human sacrifices (judging by melisandres obsession with burning roberts bastard to awake the dragon at Dragonstone and what we know about some of the mad Targ kings)...but something about Danys valyrian blood magic must have been what made it work...she had no reason to walk in to that pyre other than to prove to a bunch of rag tag dothraki that fire cannot hurt her...must have been some deep buried instinct that made her walk in to the flame giving the dragons life....

2977	Dirk blitzen	2014-05-02	As ygritte said to jon it is the wildlings that woke the whitewalkers during their search for the horn that could blow away the Wall. If this is true then the NK is asleep or imprisoned for thousands of years unable to threaten the south.


Â 
So if the night's king hasn't been planning an attack for thousands of years and instead was just... sleeping....
Then my question is wtf put him to sleep for thousands of years?Â  Could that tie into the tale of the night's king, how he was defeated?
2978	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	I like it , what about the house of black and white?


Â 
them...i wouldn't classify what they can do as magic, more skill and science...like the potions arya was made to drink...however, House of Undying...that was clearly magic...Qauithe, must be magic...the maegi who caused khal drogos infection, must be magic (perhaps her magical blood also contributed to dragons birth?)
Â 
so its probably safe to say that across the narrow sea, Essos and the rest, there's genuine magic there that does not have anything to do with Targ or Stark blood...might be from old Valyria, might be something else?Â 
Â 
just remembered the maegi's description of dany's unborn child, almost dragon in appearance. and now that dany's no longer barron makes me wonder what possible implications that could have on her future children....

Â 
2 things i wonder here
either him plotting for 8000 years or some magic done by the kings of the north + king beyond the wall + CotF putting a spell to keep him in hibernation, both lead to amazing possibilities.....but the second option, makes me wonder why they wouldnt just liquefy him with valyrian/dragon steel? maybe it doesn't work on him? maybe they didn't actually have access to them back then? something designed/created in the millenniums since specifically to battle WW when they return?Â

I agree, I think it isn't Craster's blood that is important but Starks.
If the Night's King was in fact a Stark, brother of the King of Winter it would explain why the records were destroyed and his name shall not be spoken.
Maybe he was cursed and thrown beyond the Wall (maybe put to sleep in ice by the CoTF), also built by Stark Blood and his WW wife was locked in the tombs of Winterfell.
Maybe he just wants to get to his wife but because of the curse Starks are immune to WW ice power as Targaryen's are to Dragons/fire.
Maybe that is why there always needs to be a Stark in Winterfell, to act as a guardian to the tombs.
Now that Winterfell is essentially open for anyone the Night's King is making his move.
Just a thought.
2981	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-05-03	Â 
Now wait just a minute. Craster may have been a dick, bt it is in fact apparent, that those "rules" were set into place.
Â 
"Dont touch my daughters or ill kill you" was a common theme. Well, why?
Â 
If one of his daughters got pregnant, and it was a boy, but didn't have craster's full seed and was tainted by 50% of someone else's seed, then would that botch The Others' ceremony? Because it's not full Craster blood? (i say 50% because his daughters are inbred over and over, so id think by now theyre mostly craster blood to begin with, plus his 50%)
Â 
It seems to me, a bigger conspiracy, might be to maintain the blood of Craster, in male form. What is Craster's lineage, that makes his blood so special?
Â 
There may have been a purpose, beyond "Im a horny old guy that just fucks his daughters to get laid" idea. By fucking his daughters through the generations, it limits the blood of the original more, making his blood more potent, and each baby boy born, has the highest of his blood. Not only can his production be more frequent with the birth of each new daughter, but his blood would be more potent with each baby from that said daughter.
Â 
Yeah, i dont think it's "my daughters are special to me", but rather, "my boys are SUPER special to me, because they serve a purpose"
Â 
Â 
Â 
....do you think, Craster's ancestry, could be descended from, The Night's King and Night's Queen? And that his blood just needs a sort of, "ignition," to tap into that magic.


Â 
Â 
Hard to deny that's what's taking place here. As of 300AL the babes would have been more Craster and much less the original 'crone' wife.
Â 
I think people are being myopic in dismissing this, thinking that the Others are trying to build an army of ice babies. They already have an army. Perhaps what they need is a magician, or a White Priest.
2982	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-03	Why am I getting visions along the lines of,
Â 
"oh, dont bother naming that baby.. it's just an other baby, we'll give it to the gods.."
Â 
Their name, The Others.. were they the "Other" children? like, the second-born, or, bastardborn? All of Craster's children would technically be, bastards.
Â 
 
Â 
JONS AN OTHER CHILD
Â 
Â 
Â 
Maybe that's the missing ingredient! Not First Men blood, but Bastard blood.
Â 
That would make all Others bastards. Maybe that's the key, though. The payment, is all your bastard boys.


I think that bastardy does not come into play north of the Wall at all, because there is no marriage. One just steals a woman. But, the Others have no name either. They are just the Others. We are men and women, there are CotF, giants. These creature's names are taboo as well.
2983	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-03	I agree, I think it isn't Craster's blood that is important but Starks.
If the Night's King was in fact a Stark, brother of the King of Winter it would explain why the records were destroyed and his name shall not be spoken.
Maybe he was cursed and thrown beyond the Wall (maybe put to sleep in ice by the CoTF), also built by Stark Blood and his WW wife was locked in the tombs of Winterfell.
Maybe he just wants to get to his wife but because of the curse Starks are immune to WW ice power as Targaryen's are to Dragons/fire.
Maybe that is why there always needs to be a Stark in Winterfell, to act as a guardian to the tombs.
Now that Winterfell is essentially open for anyone the Night's King is making his move.
Just a thought.


Not a bad one. We should look more into the stories about previous king's beyond the wall and underground tunnels they made. I remember from the show (I would have to look up if that is the case in the books) maester Luwin said to Theon there was a secret passage out of Winterfell leading to the Wall.
2984	Crow'sEye	2014-05-03	The laws of men change beyond the wall, so no bastards as those Southrons term it as such.
Â 
The Others might have things like names, but unlikely that humans would know them, since verbal communication seems negligible (just sort of screams and such  ) at this point.
2985	Littlefinger of the Hand	2014-05-03	D&D and George showed us the moon. And we are staring at their fingers!   There was no spoiler in the baby at all. We all knew their fate from the beginning...  The real spoiler or better the... "glimpse" is of the altar and of someone being especially important amongst the WW. His horns give us a hint that he is a something like a king. So the real question is what is he.... A question that will be answered by george in the next books. Ignore craster's babies. They are random recruits of the WW that are used as means to advance the plot of both the series and books.Â 
So if the night's king hasn't been planning an attack for thousands of years and instead was just... sleeping....
Then my question is wtf put him to sleep for thousands of years?Â  Could that tie into the tale of the night's king, how he was defeated?

The great other was in a "sleep mode" for 8000 years. We don't know who put him to "sleep" but after his defeat he was put to sleep. Perhaps someone cut his ring- finger  We have no clue at all. If he was awake and plotting for 8 millenniums he is just a harmless moron who got his plans ruined about 800 times because the status quo of westeros was changing drastically all the time and he had to restart all his  schemes over and over again... Even Ned Stark was a better plotter than this ......
2986	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-03	My vote for what woke the Night's King from his slumber is the Doom of Valeria.
Â 
I figure Craster has provided around a hundred sons at least to the Others. There at the end, he had nineteen wives. If he kept them pregnant, that's a birth rate of 2 a month, roughly, and at a 50/50 gender ratio, that's a son and a daughter every month. Sons went straight to the sacrifice and became something that could easily survive the harsh climate beyond the Wall, but daughters had to grow up. They then had to survive childbirth. A survival rate of 18% to 20% for the daughters sounds plausible to me.
Â 
As for Mel and Jon, I think Mel's definitely going to try to burn Gilly's son once she finds out about Jon's duplicity and the nature of Craster's sacrifices. Jon may have ironically given her a better candidate for her own sacrifices - the brother to a large host of the Others. And she would present it to Jon in exactly those terms. You can cut a huge chunk out of the Others and save all of humanity, Jon Snow. You just have to burn this baby named after your best friend. What are you going to do?
2987	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-03	You can cut a huge chunk out of the Others and save all of humanity, Jon Snow.


Â 
Hmmâ<U+0080>¦humans in Planetos are cruel even to their own children. The Others, it would seem now, not only value human babes, but could even be said to be gentle to them. Humans in Planetos are capable of comitting the worst kind of attrocities to each other, just to sate their lust for power. But I've yet to see an Other stab one of his own in the back.
Â 
So who's to say that humanity is not the real villain in this world, and that it needs to be saved?

Â 


Â 
Â 
I highly doubt all 19 (if that's truly how many he had) of Craster's wives were having babies back to back. You have to take into account many of them were too old now to bear children and the younger ones would be breastfeeding (which statistically lowers pregnancy rate due to hormones) and not every sexual encounter would result in a pregancy every time. Craster couldn't have had sex with more than one or two of them at a time (per day?) - he was getting on in years. So with all that and infant mortality in childbirth (very common in those conditions) it's not highly likely he actually had "99 sons" as he proclaimed (supposedly Gilly's was his 100th?) - I think he was boasting / exaggerating a bit. Had he actually counted every son he'd laid out in the snow from the beginning?Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
But then again, we're operating in a fantasy story which can suspend disbelief in many ways so if he actually had that many sons then the Others have a fairly good number of 'brothers' supplied by Craster's breeding factory.
Â 
Â 
As for Mel and Jon, I think Mel's definitely going to try to burn Gilly's son once she finds out about Jon's duplicity and the nature of Craster's sacrifices.

You can cut a huge chunk out of the Others and save all of humanity, Jon Snow. You just have to burn this baby named after your best friend. What are you going to do?

Â 
I like this theory as well as the other one someone made that possibly killing the wrong baby (Mel's assumption it's Mance's baby) could provoke the Others because that was actually Craster's baby and thus their 'rightful brother' taken from them. Either one could have a really amazing outcome to the story!

So there are 14 chief white walkers and he walked up, 7th in line to the, "Heart of Winter?" Â He then turns a baby boy into a WW.
Â 
Okay, now D and D spent time with GRRM learning the fate and path of every character in the show.
Â 
Because none of the gods in ASOIAF are real in the story, I am thinking based on that scene and how supernatural power has worked in the series.
Â 
The Night's King = The Great Other = Chief White Walker
Â 
and Dany = Azor Ahai Reborn and The DRagons = Lightbringer
Â 
We shall see because the reality is D and D will get there first even though they won't get there better.

That's because you're looking at it from a human perspective. How do you think that all of those animals mankind has wiped out from the face of the earth felt about being hunted for centuries to no end, not for food or clothing, but for mere fun, by man?
Â 
ETA: The Others are not clearly not human. Like the Agents in the Matrix, they may very well be looking at the human race as some kind of virus or plague. Why should they concern themselves with what must clearly feel like a lesser race of beings to them, who are destroying their world, anymore than we care about vermin?

They would all say: " yea! men are gone, the throne is empty let's all play "a game of thrones:species edition"":D
Anyway I got your point and think it possible. 
I just think the WW and the Dragons are there to emphasize the vanity of the game of thrones and of the pursuit of power. Anything great schemers have accomplished, stepping over dead bodies, is about to melt and burn in a few moments from a small unstable factor which will be proved to be the real threat and should have been their main concern and worry. 
Translating in real world terms it could be environmental disasters or even the finite of life itself. DEATH, inevitable death.

Did I ever say that? How did you come to that conclusion? I just pointed out that the NW oath can be twisted around to fit the Others. Or parts of it. Does that look like a fully developed theory to you that you should immediately jump onto and tear to pieces? I was inviting a civilised conversation on it. And why are WALLS mentioned in the oath?

Thanks for that.Â   Â When I mentioned the oath, I was referring to an earlier discussion on this thread about Night's King. If the guy who turned the baby and was briefly identified as such by the HBO website, is NK, he was/is also the 13th LC of the NW. So, it would make sense to discuss the oath in the light of that revelation. Many people on this thread assume other 12 WW are also LC of the NW. So, I do think the discussion of the oath has a merit. Hence, I was floored by your attack.Â 
Â 
EDIT 2: Sorry everyone. I have reedit my post because Littlefinger of the Hand reedited his post twice and his message is altered. Â 
Littlefinger of the Hand: I really don't know what you are talking about re strk-Instr-trgrn. He claimed D&D created their own version of the scene we were discussing. I said that it was naive to think that anyone in a multibillion TV/publishing enterprise would be free riding in such an important scene. I made a distinction between the baby turning scene and scenes like Bran being captured at Craster's because the former can alter the overall plot and the latter cannot. Calling someone's view on how a big marketing machinery operates naive is not a personal insult, nor it was ever meant to be an insult of any kind. What you are implying by your post is that you just retaliated for something you perceived as an insult of a third party, by attacking my post that had a content, which was totally unrelated to a discussion with that third person. I cannot understand that kind of behaviour. Posts should be discussed on their content, not just because you have a certain perception of a poster. This is a book forum. We are discussing books (in this case a book spoiler in a show). Why does it have to escalate into something personal is beyond me? Also, it's a waste of thread imho.

But I have one nit to pick with the first post I quoted.Â  You said the Others "value human babies."Â  I'm going to argue that isn't true.Â  That would kind of be like saying a "healthy relationship" is one in which one member is constantly trying to change the other to suit their own preferences.Â  In fact it's worse, because at least in a relationship, the one trying to be changed has volition, can say "no," can leave the relationship.Â  If the Others truly valued human babies, they would allow them to exist for their own sake and not change them into versions of themselves.Â  That's what abusers do.Â  Instead, the Others (and abusers) use them as a resource, a means to achieve an end.Â 
Â 
Curious what you (and anyone really) think, but I figured I would post as I completely agree with everything else you've written here.

I like your post. It is interesting how the Others turn babies into them while Faceless Men offer "a gift" of death. So, maybe that's what the Others are doing to humans as well. "Gifting" them with death. However, FM do make a good historical point. Slaves wish for death. Hence, Dany's liberation of slaves changes their wish for death into a wish for life. It's a strong force opposing those who wish to be "gifted" by death. If I'm rambling, ignore me. :-)

Â 
Like I said, I have trouble conveying my ideas every now & then, and obviously this seems to be one of those times. Let me see if I can explain myself better...
Â 
I obviously agree that the Others are abusers, who are taking full advantage of innocent creatures much too young to decide for themselves. They are the perfect example of the abuser mentality and they are only using the children to further their race, of course.
Â 
That said, I still believe that the children are much better off, because in such a brutal world, what options did they have?
Â 
I think Karl's assumption that Craster would've killed the babe in that "gift to the gods" scene is 100% on the mark, even if it's not in the books. Because that's exactly what I imagine Craster was thinking that would happen to his sons after he gave them to the Others.
Â 
In the end, he was sacrificing them to his gods, one way or the other. So the poor babes were left with no choice but with what very well may end up being the lesser of two evils. And to add more salt to the wound, the choice was always gonna be made for them by someone else.
Â 
Stiil, based on what we saw in last week's episode (which wasn't much, I admit), I got the impression that the Others respect and value their own kind, and they wish to preserve their own species in ways that one could only wish that the humans of Planetos did.
Â 
One could always argue that death may be better than life as an Other. But since we don't have enough info as to how life as an Other truly is (and I seriously doubt it would be as nightmarish an existence as that of a Wight), I think that's depends on whether the Others are damned creatures (as Melissandre clearly seems to believe) or simply, a foreign kind of life-form that humans simply can't understand.
Â 
Â

That wasn't me who said that, but that was pretty much my own reaction to it, yeah lol.

3014	salmonsnake	2014-05-04	To me it makes way more sense for Valar Morghulis to be related to Rh'llor. The Kindly Old Man speaks of the many-faced God, but Jaqen calls him the Red God, which is one of the names of Rh'llor. Lord of Light demands people to be burned alive, while the icy Great Other seems to be associated with biological immortality. I also tend to think the Undying warlocks are related to the Great Other. It also doesn't make sense to me for the secret name of the Great Other to be in Valyrian, instead of True Tongue. (I'm still incredibly fond of the idea that the name is Hodor [and that Old Nan is immortal])

Â 
Â 
This is the summary / conclusion I came to a few pages back myself. In the end, it boiled down to the lesser of two evils for those babies. The daughters who 'survived' weren't really the luckier ones by far IMO - they lived a miserable existence, isolated from society under the thumb of their Father who also raped them. Had the Others not taken the baby boys, it's highly likely Craster would have killed them himself as stated anyways.
Â 
Sure, one could argue that dying would maybe have been more merciful for any of those babies born - boy or girl.
Â 
It's really helped me come to terms with why the wives / daughters of Craster seemed so accepting of the sacrifices. They knew the consequences to their own lives if they didn't - the Others would kill them all. They also knew, because the 'brothers' / 'sons of Craster' always came for the boys that somehow these babies were living on in some form or another as either servants or soldiers (we don't know what their true role is yet) to the Others. I guess under those circumstances, the wives and daughters had little choice but comforted themselves knowing at least Craster hadn't brutally murdered their sons.

Â 
Exactly.
Â 
Plus also, I think a mother's instinct is so strong, that any woman would prefer to see her son live any kind of existence, rather than being murdered at birth, by their own father, no less.
3017	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-04	I can't get past this 'Night's King' and all that entails..
Damn HBO just had to throw that synopsis out thereÂ  
I cannot help but wonder about his involvement with the WW..
I'm lead to assume that he's their physical 'leader'..
Which makes total sense. Could be working as a catspaw for The Great Other? Similar to the Saruman/Sauron scenario.
I also wonder if these WW babies age at the same rate as a human would? I would imagine so.. (Obviously having a longer life-span).. I just can't quite wrap my head around a pre-pubescent WW..
And I haven't read it anywhere.. This could be irrelevant But if it were possible to 'turn' grown humans into walkers.. Why do they kill them first? Wouldn't you prefer a WW soldier over a wight? I mean.. The Night's King himself apparently underwent quite the transformation after depositing his seed into his white queen..
IDKÂ 
Does one NEED to be a baby to be turned into a WW?Â 
Babies are pure.. They would have no memory or anything like that to mess up their WW duties..
Maybe TNK is a special case.. Like 'a chosen one' of sorts.. So he got special treatment from the gods??Â 
Then I wonder.. (now this is certainly irrelevant) Coldhands.. Was he a failed attempt at turning an adult human?
And did he start to revert to his human/crow like ways whenever the blue didn't take?
Leaving him in a perpetual half human crow/WW state?
8000 years is a long time.. I'm sure they've done their share of experimentation..
The level of mystery is just soo high right now.. I know I'll probably be satisfied by the outcome (seeing as I've already more than gotten my money's worth out of this series) .. I just hope people aren't disappointed.. So many put so much stock in the 'end game'..
3018	jon crow	2014-05-04	My thoughts:
Other carrying the baby definitely isn't coldhands. Get real.
"Night's king" could just be a title, not necessarily referring to the 13th LC specifically.
Getting more theoretical, the last hero of legend rode out with twelve companions. Thirteen champions of humanity/life against thirteen leaders of the others? It definitely looked like all of the figures were wearing black though which is extremely interesting. Full-fledged others wearing black not just wights, unless those other twelve silhouettes were just reflections in the ice.
3019	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-04	"Night's king" could just be a title, not necessarily referring to the 13th LC specifically.
Â 


Yeah, that had crossed my mind.. Which I could buy that.. It just makes sense that TNK would be involved in the WW happenings. It could just be a 'title' though as you said.. I'd just reeeeally like to believe that it all connects.
3020	Areo Speedwagon	2014-05-04	snip...


Â 
yeah, we're on the same page.Â  That one point just stuck out because of everything else.
Â 
I agree that horrible as it is to say, maybe the boys are better off than the girls who have to grow and live with Craster.
Â 
And yeah, that scene definitely made me think there's a social organization of some sort.Â  It appears to be hierarchical, but may not be.Â  Although for some reason I got the idea that maybe it's a sort of a mirror of Westerosi (or Westerosi society a reflection of it) feudal social structures - Wights as serfs, White Walkers as ... knights (maybe?) and so on.Â 
Â 
Also, your posts made me think the Others may also be a patriarchal society, again the reflection or vice versa with Westeros.Â  There's nothing in the books or that scene to even hint at this, I know.Â  Would certainly be interesting, moving forward, if we were to find out the CotF are matriarchal.Â  Is there anything on that in Dance?Â 
Â 
Lastly, your point about Melisandre and "damned creatures" got me thinking.Â  Valar Morghulis, all men must die.Â  And so far, we've seen two confirmed, and one most likely case of what can come after.Â  Kiss of Fire, Touch of Ice, the last being Qyburn and the most likely re-animated-through-necromancy Robert Strong. Â  Of those three, brutal as it may seem at times, R'hlorr is the only god that seems to offer either rebirth or a finite end.Â  Fire consumes and Ice preserves.Â  This can also be taken as an allegory for what happens after you die.Â  With the Others they gave give you life after death, but not really, only as thrall, a slave.Â  Further, Ice preserves.Â  Maybe this arrangement of living-death slavery is endless.Â  Maybe White Walkers are like the weirwoods, they're functionally immortal, but still can be killed.Â  And the wights, as we saw with the hand Thorne took with him to KL, are obedient slave until they rot to the bone.Â  Death by fire is the purest death.Â  Maybe that's true, and in this world, that's very important.Â  Beric seemed far more sentient, volitional than any other walking around post mortem.Â 
Â 
Continuing that thought, it's very interesting that one of the main characters and themes of the entire series is the eradication of slavery, and the voice of that theme has fire breathing dragons.Â  It would seems that maybe by the time this series is done, slavery will be eradicated both in this world and the afterlife. Â
3021	jon crow	2014-05-04	Also re: the whole "great other" debate.
Pretty sure grrm has said that no "gods" as such would appear in the series but their existence would be left open to interpretation though magic etc. therefore I think it highly unlikely that what we saw was any direct agency of some "great other" but definitely some kind of ritual magic we are yet unfamiliar with.

He doesn't have to 'appear' himself to have been pushing things along quietly.Â 
It is definitely some kind of ritual magic we are yet unfamiliar with.
I too, highly doubt he will appear. But his presence will be known.But "The Great Other" whatever that may be.. DOES exist. Maybe you're reading into the Sauron comparison a bit much.. Didn't mean it that literally. Just meant to get my point across.
TNK could be working from 'visions' not unlike priests/priestesses of R'hllor who see visions in the flames.Â 
I highly doubt they've done all this on a whim.Â 
And as of right now, it is up for interpretation, and this what what I'm doing.. Interpreting..Â 
Not just hanging on every word GRRM said in some interview.. Good lord..Â

Simply, they need THAT blood. The blood that Craster and his wife from whitetree hah.
I tried to make the case a few days ago in tue older thread.
If anybaby would do, the ww would have easily raided all wildling villages for baby boys so they'd quickly all become baby factories.
They didnt because they simply need
1- the right baby
2- the sacred circle of icicles
3- possibly spikey ww to do the job as some kind of king\priest of blue eyes
Otherwise they'd have turned the poor baby right after the picking.
Plus i would not get all worked out on the number of ww at the ceremony of blueyesation, there's a good chance we're only seeing a bit of a wider scene.

Nice catch - there's been a lot of theorizing about the numbers involved with the Others but I've never thought about any significance to the number of stones around the 'altar' or the weirwoods. What significance would 9 be?

Â 
Well, 9 is 3 times 3. And 3 has always been one of the most important, sacred numbers in numerology (just like 7, actually). IDK how this relates to "Ice Stonehenge" as seen in the show, but it could be of relevance, just like the ring of 13 Walkers that were standing in front of the altar, as 13 is also an important number in occult numerologoy.
3030	Snowisnobastard	2014-05-04	I'm honestly not sure what the significance of 9 is yet, other than outside of asoiaf it was jimi hendrix's favorite number
3031	BlkProphet79	2014-05-05	I've seen a number of posts wondering if the Others can turn humans into...well Others. Â It's obvious they can. Â For all of the myth and legend surrounding the Night's King, he was in fact, a human, possibly even a Stark. Â Whether it was by ritual or some other means, Brandon Stark, the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch somehow become the Night's King we just watched turn a human baby. Â From what we know from Old Nan's stories, the Night's King did all sorts of inhuman (as well as inhumane) acts to court the favor of his pale-skinned beauty. Â Perhaps, therein lies the critical element for adult humans to be turned...a willingness to conscientiously follow/swear fealty to the Great Other.
Â 
I believe that Others would rather turn newborn babies as their conscience minds are not yet fully developed so they are not able to (at a primal level) reject the otherworldy and plain wrongness of the Others. Â It appears to me that this revelation opens up new possibilities regarding the nature of the Others.
Â 
We know the Children of the Forest have been fighting them since before the Wall went up. Â Is it possible the first "White Walkers" were First Men who willingly followed the Great Other? Â Could they simply be CotF who decided to follow the Great Other as well? Â The idea of an evil entity figure subverting the agents of the "good": benevolent deity is pretty evident in a number of real-world religions, so what I posit may not be too far of a stretch. .
3032	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-05	I'm honestly not sure what the significance of 9 is yet, other than outside of asoiaf it was jimi hendrix's favorite number 


There are 10 ice stones in that icehenge. I counted several times. Just saying.
3033	Dunric	2014-05-05	In both the books and the show, Craster is very adamant that he is a "godly man". It has also been said by Osha that the Old Gods are the only gods beyond the wall. Two of the major tenants of the Old God religion are the laws of hospitality (which Craster observes many times by harboring the rangers) and viewing kinslaying as an act of ultimate sacrilege.
Â 
Given that Craster never kills his own sons and rather gives them to the others, is it not possible that the simplest reason for him doing so is just to ensure his survival? I'm assuming that the others also adhere to this principle against kinslaying and since many of them would be considered akin to Craster, they would be forbidden to kill him.
Â 
This would also clarify why many wildling villages are being wiped out, because they did not make similar sacrifices and as such, are not protected by the sanctity of kinship.

Quite simply they should have left one adult male per village, to ensure a steady supply of babies, and taken all the rest. That is, if any baby would do. If they took any wildling baby it was occasional and never mentA¬oned. Instead, they took the pain of travelling to Craster for every baby boy left in the woods. 
It seems to me very illogical if you want to bolster your numbers not to grab all boys available. Even more if you're some kind of invincible warrior. Instead they let the wildling prosper in the thousands and tens of thousands.
A strange behaviour indeed

The more wildlings that prosper, the more sacrifice they can get. I don't think it's particularly Craster's children, persay, but Craster definitely made more of a "production" and "business" out of it. He may have been appointed to do so, as some of the things he says is questionable on a look-back.
Â 
I think it's First Men blood. I think thats the key ingredient. Craster's are probably more potent, since all his daughters are incestual, their product would be more potent in First Men blood, than let's say, if Craster had a separate wife. Maybe, his original wife died, and she had First Men blood as well.
Â 
It seems like a program of a sort, and the reason he's so defensive over his daughters, could be to keep the bloodline pure (to give to the Others, with that secret ingredient).

Well, in all fairness, we don't know for a fact that the Others didn't take babies from other wildling settlements. They could've killed/turned to Wights all of the village's people and so there would be no witnesses left to tell the tale.

Well, some of the Wildlings must've joined Mance's forces, of course, but not all, I would think. And moreover, the NW didn't run into any Wights till the attack on the Fist of the First Men.
Â 
Now, I'm not saying that the blood of the FM doesn't have something to do with the magic of the Others. But then again, I don't think Craster was the only Wildling who had it, and so I don't think it was only his sons that the Others took. Perhaps those were about the only boys that were given to them freely, which opens another can of worms altogether, right?

Mehh not exactly. Wildlings are those that typically believe in the old gods, but I think what makes them Wildlings persay, is the fact they refuse to kneel before the King of the seven kingdoms. Hypocritical, i know, since they bow before a King-Beyond-The-Wall. Not all, but some.
Â 
I think it's their refusal to show fealty to the King, that makes them wildling. I could be wrong. Some of them just so happento have First Men blood through ancestry.

Might have happened had there not been numerous statements in the books by the brothers of the NW that wildling villages were deserted because folks joined MR, while there has not been a single reference to what you are saying. So, I'd leave it in the realm of "might be" until we have a hint in other direction. Btw, all wildlings are descendants of the First Men. It is known. :-) And the Others are definitely not raiding all the villages taking male babies or coming to some kind of a deal with villagers to offer sacrifice as they did with Craster. Yet, old nan had a saying "May the Others take you", which indicated sacrifices or abductions of babies had happened in the past, because they are a part of lore beyond-the-wall, which incidentally MR was studying. So, we may conclude Craster's keep is rare, but not a completely isolated incident. What we also can conclude from the show is that there were 13 Others dressed in black who performed and/or witnessed the turning ceremony on the altar in the middle of an icehenge i.e. a holy ground. The character whom HBO briefly identified as Night's King used his icy finger to turn the baby. What we saw in the prologue of the first episode of the GoT is that Ned Stark beheaded a NW deserter with a sword called Ice within a circle of a ruined stonehenge.Â

The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. Â Bran, AGOT

Â 
We also know that Starks are charged with dealing with justice in the north, including dealing with deserters of the NW. Since NK was a Stark or so we suspect, it may be speculated that he was a head Stark on the other side of the Wall who had the same task when it came to the NW and he performed it in a holy place equivalent with the one we saw near Winterfell. The former was made of ice, the latter of stone. If we follow this premise, we may speculate (in this stage that's all we can do) that the leadership of the Others performs a task of punishing brothers of the NW who broke their vows. So, desertion = death sentence in which case Jon and Mance should have been attacked by the Others or will be in the future. Craster was a son of a brother of the NW. What's the punishment for fathering a child? We don't know what happened to his father. What we do know is that the Others have been taking all the males from the Craster's bloodline and turning them. My guess (at this point) is that they may be doing so in order not to let blood of the traitor of the NW spread beyond-the-wall and infiltrate the wildlings. That would be consistent with keeping the part of the vows that says that a brother should not take a wife, nor father any children. The weak point here is how come Craster was not taken? Was he protected by his mother who was a Whitetree witch and made her own sacrifices? We can only wonder and make conjunctures.Â 
Â 
Also, note that the NW vows say "we are the watchers on the walls", "we guard the realms of men". The latter point Sam argues in front of measter Aemon after bringing Gilly to the Wall. Also, note that the NW lost its purpose and turned into a punitive colony with few exceptions. So, was that what woke the Others? The fact that the NW had ceased to guard the Wall properly and other watchers are necessary? Watchers of the walls, other walls, not just the Wall? I think the NK legend should be explored in depth, along with all the stories on the kings-beyond-the-wall if we are to come to any more comprehensive conclusion.Â
3047	Starry	2014-05-06	Quote from thisÂ interview:
Â 
Although we got one big answer, the final scene presented a lot of questions as well. MacLaren says that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss were very particular about how little they wanted to show, leaving the line-up blurred out on purpose.
Â 
What could have been seen if it wasn't blurred out I wonder. How the Others look we already know. So there would be no reason to blur it out. Any ideas?

Not just the nights king, what had led to him taking his queen, how he was dismissed, and the possibility of in depth plot to overthrow and take his rule over. seriously, who was the 14th and what is his story???

the rules of the nights watch may have been different before then. in the defense of the nights king lead other, for the most part he's followed the oath to a tee.

In some cultures people born under an unauspicious sign (born from incest, born during a bad luck day, born in a cursed place...etc.) risk becoming evil/becoming witches/becoming monsters.That would explain why Craster was respected, why all the other wildlings have such a strong rejection to inbreeding, why the Westerosi kill children born from incest, and why the Valyrians avoided Westeros (they were afraid of being turned).

I think Westerosi aversion to incest comes from so many Targs being mad (or at least perceived to be mad). But other than that, this is a very interesting theory. I like it

Can't wait to find out...if we do.
Possibly it's a Melkor/Orc thing, the Great Other doing the first change. Possibly the change is full so that the Others that get changed (assuming there are Others who were never human) are truly something else, not just humans who like a bit of cold.
3058	Unkindessofravens	2014-05-31	First post -- but to get down to business, I remember some of the Heresy threads speculating that Craster has Stark blood. I've wondered for a while whether the secret ingredient to producing an Other instead of a wight is being of the Stark lineage. Many Lord Commanders have been Starks; hell, maybe in the old days the Stark in Winterfell _was_ the Lord Commander and these posts only split after a northern civil war between Stark brothers. Or maybe, to get really weird, the end of the war involved an agreement whereby the King in the North would remain human but the Lord Commander would be Other-ized as a sort of bridge between the factions. None of this sounds quite right to me, but I don't know.
Â 
It's quite possible that Starks in turn have Other blood from ancient times, as discussed here and other places: http://asoiaf.wester...ings-of-winter/
Â 
Just a vague speculation -- Dany's vision of the 'usurper's' (Robert's) army clad all in ice and arrayed against her -- is it possible that this will end up being a force led by Jon? Then usurper would have a double meaning, as Robert certainly fit that bill earlier, but to Dany's eyes Jon might well be one as well, despite having a stronger claim.
3059	Darkbringer	2014-04-28	Really I think these two steal the scenes they are in. Locke was absolutely brilliant from the outset. A much better option than Vargo and Zollo in my opinion, Vargo was just too flamboyant and out-there for TV. Both he and Karl had a great episode. Karl drinking from Mormonts skull was a bit much, but I loved the way he went on his little bragging sesh. Karl was brilliant when he took down Craster too. I assume both of these guys are going down soon, mores the pity, cuz they are a delight to watch. I don't think there's any way out for either of them, is there? Do you think Jon will cotton on to Locke before the shit goes down? Would be a good development of Jon's judgement if he did.
3060	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-29	yea i really like locke and karl a lot. i'm hoping they could both stick around but karl's days are numbered. locke could be around for awhile and maybe gain the trust of jon especially if he's saying the vows of the night's watch.
3061	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-29	Karl's scene was very macabre. I liked it a lot. I think the sentimentality that drives his character is what makes him so interesting; from reminding himself of his rise from Gin Alley, threatening Rast to prove what a warrior he is (or was), to keeping Mormont's skull and a caged direwolf as trophies of his "success".
Â 
Also; "You look like a fucking ball sack."
Â 
Glad we're getting more of Locke, too. Vargo works in the books, as he's a weirdly twisted character; but I think Locke fits the tone of the show better. He's twisted in his own way, and I like that he's working for Roose which helps tie in The Wall with The North story a bit earlier. Noah has been killing it, and I weirdly enjoyed his interaction with Jon despite wanting to scream No don't trust him!.
3062	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-29	I wanted Locke to drag Jon behind a barracks and make out, but that's just me. "hmm, not a threat. Just your bros."
Â 
I like how reprehensibley realistic Karl is. Kinda cheered him on at "you're a daughterfucking wildling bastard" but after that it was a nosedive into douchebaggery. He's all king of the dilapidated incest compound and mighty proud, even if he's stuck out in the sticks and probably running low on food. Was curious why he was pretty quick to leave the baby out for the White Walkers instead of killing it right there.

3065	IlAovatar	2014-04-29	As much as the idea that any character could be "too flamboyant and out-there for TV" makes me ashamed of humanity, the actor playing Locke has really made me love Vargo Hoat's replacement.
Â 
I actually think he'll be around for a while - at least another whole season after this one - assuming they have him playing a ringleader role in the murder of Jon at the end of ADWD.
Â 
Karl is fantastic too. The moment he said "You are a bastard" to Craster in that harsh voice, I thought "why haven't they cast this guy in a more important role so we can see more of him?". He'll be killed off pretty soon I imagine, but we'll hopefully get a couple more good scenes from him first.

I took flamboyant to mean too cartoonish and silly rather than flaming. I mean, you can have giggling and vicious (Floki), but add a wild hairdo, a zorse, and a lisp and you start getting hokey onscreen.Â
3067	DemiNymph	2014-04-29	I like Locke. Not that much into Karl. He seems to be too much of an exaggerated villian, the script writers are laying it on too thick. The actor is quite good thou. I assume he's gonna get killed off soon, so I shan't bother about him too much or invest too much attention on him.Â
3068	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-29	I like the characterization of both.
Â 
Locke is not Vargo Hoat, but I thought he would have made a decent Shagwell replacement if they had kept him down south to clash with Brienne again.
Â 
As for Karl, he does a good job of showing why some men are sent to the Watch. The guy was some sort of King's Landing hitman; makes him dangerous enough to be a challenge even to the highborn who are trained at arms. His background also shows why he gave no fucks at all about breaking guest right. I wonder if this was something the producers decided to add after seeing the actor's performance just before Craster gets murdered.

3069	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-29	I'm a massive fan of dark humour and tend not to get offended by really anything so I loved the whole Craster subplot. Karl stealing the show, showing exactly what a cutthroat from the gutters who was forced to live a life of celibate shame on a frozen wall would do the second they get freedom and power (even if it's rather limited).Â 
Â 
As for Locke, the actor just looks...right? I don't know, his facial expressions and attitude are awesome, has a mix of amusement and sheer danger that seems to be a staple in the Bolton entourage. Hope he sticks around for the Ides of March as he seems to be worming his way into Jon's confidence quickly.
3070	Envie	2014-04-29	The actor they cast to play Karl is SO creepy - spot on! I was so disgusted by him. I think this is the only time I would have actually cheered on Rast if he'd have been provoked and finally tried to shut Karl up. Ugh!~
Â 
As for Locke - I had my reservations about him when he was first announced / cast because I couldn't imagine such a complete change from Vargo Hoat. But Locke's grown on me and that's mostly because of the fantastic actor. He's really really good. For a brief moment there in the scene with Jon in the yard at Castle Black, I -almost- felt like Locke could be a totally cool companion and supporter to Jon's cause. But then I remembered his motives and reasons for being there and got the chills because his acting was so good he's almost easy to like and trust. That's exactly what they're going for so Jon falls for it. Well played.
3071	Cubarey	2014-04-29	"His background also shows why he gave no fucks at all about breaking guest right. "
Â 
You are aware that "guest right" requires that the host not harm his guests not the other way around? The host is deemed to be able to harm the guests. Only a fool would invite in "guests" that could harm him. Thus Karl and the boys (and the hound in episode three did not tehnically violate the rules of "guest rights").

No actually it goes both ways 
"The guest right is a sacred law of hospitality. When a guest, be he common born or noble, eats the food and drinks the drink off a host's table beneath the host's roof, the guest right is invoked. Bread and salt are the traditional provisions.
When invoked, neither the guest can harm his host nor the host harm his guest for the length of the guest's stay.[1] For either to do so would be to break a sacred covenant that is believed to invoke the wrath of the Gods both old and new. Both the teachings of the old gods and the Faith of the Seven hold to this. Even robber lords and wreckers are bound by the ancient laws of hospitality. [2]" - ASOIAF

I like the Jon and Locke dynamic. I can see Locke developing a certain respect for Jon, but he'll go through with the job all the same.
3076	Heir to Winterfell	2014-04-29	I thought Locke's job was to find Bran and Rickon, not to kill Jon.  I can see him "disappearing" during the upcoming raid on Craster's and then continue the hunt solo.

Â 
EIther/or as far as what Ramsay said about Jon being a threat - but yeah first and foremost is to find the boys..
Â 
I liked the Karl scene and as Elio and some others have said it's very "Apocalypse Now" which I enjoyed in that regard..
Â 
Honestly have no clue how they'll handle it the Locke/Jon/Bran angle - Coldhands would've been the easiest way as iirc he did kill the mutineers but it was before he met up with Bran and only mentioned .. but adding the NW in (on top of what we already know) makes me wonder how they'll make this smoothly transition back into the pre-exististing story lines.

3079	Ruin	2014-04-29	I really enjoyed Locke's performance, and I'm glad he's been kept on and included with this new story arc.Â  I could care less about Karl.Â  His performance was lackluster at best, and I hope he gets cut down in the next episode.
3080	Seneti	2014-04-29	Oh gods, yes, both of them are awesome, Karl more so than Locke, though (at least in my opinion). What really sends shivers down my spine is that Karl is evidently a complete sociopath - he shows no feelings of remorse, empathy, not even disgust. It's all about him. Everybody else is collateral. I think the thing that rattles me the most about the entire scene at Craster's was how there was this one guy raping a sobbing girl right behind him throughout the entire scene and he didn't even flinch. Screw Ramsay. We know to whom Joffrey passed on the asshole torch...
3081	Rigormortis	2014-04-29	I like both Karl and Locke, great scenes.
Locke, for some reason, just reminds me of the six fingered man from The Princess Bride
3082	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-04-29	I liked the rather "Heart of Darkness" allusion in the scenes at Craster's Keep with Karl having some kind of Colonel-Kurtz-feeling about him. He, sitting there with all the atrocities going on around him and drinking from the skull of "Jeor f*cking Mormont" was so over the top, it was just great.

3087	SerFelixCulpa	2014-04-29	Locke works as a character except (as some other people pointed out) he simply could not have gotten away with cutting off Jaime Lannister's hand like that. Â Tywin alone would have demanded he die (at the minimum) for doing that to a Lannister, and Roose Bolton would have had no compunction to offer him as a sweetener. Â Vargo Hoat was a dead man the minute he did that to Jaime, or he was the minute his ruse to try and put daylight between Roose and Tywin failed. Â Locke would have to suffer the same fate. Â I have trouble forgetting this as we see the Locke character progress...
Â 
...there's also the issue of his taking the Night's Watch vow to go with Jon. It seems to me this would never be forgotten in the North, that it's not something you could just shake off like breaking a lesser vow. Â Maybe if Locke was to end up leaving the North...thoughts?

3091	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-29	The guy who plays Karl is one of the best actors on the show. His scene last year insulting and killing Craster is my favourite one so far. His facial expressions and tone of voice are excellent. I wish he had a bigger part now.

I think Stannis was offering to do that as King, but I see your point. Â Still, it would be one thing to 'relieve' a brother of his vows because he is (at least by blood) a Stark and the North wants a Stark in Winterfell. Â Some guy who just infiltrated the NW to get info? Even if sanctioned by the Warden of the North, I think the North might remember that, especially if the word gets out the guy had something to do with killing Starks.

Â 
I didn't like it either, that Locke offered, to say his vows. It's real stupid of him. So he never will get his holdfast and 100 acres, but has to be beheaded as an oathbreaker should he ever make it back to the Dreadfort (what I don't ecpect to happen).

Yeah, I think Locke may have gone a step too far there. At this rate he's going to end up knowing a lot of stuff that Roose would presumably rather keep in the family. I think his chances of survival going back to the Dreadfort were always pretty low even if he didn't take the NW vows.
3095	Teren_Kanan	2014-04-29	Love both actors, and characters. Skull drinking was awesome.
Â 
But Karl's actor as Ramsay? No. A more important villain than Karl perhaps, but Karl doesn't have any of the Psychotic playfulness that the current Ramsay so epically portrays.

Â 
I agree... I think the particular brand of psychopath Ramsay is requires a more subtle and refined character. Karl's actor portrays his blunt, crude villain style perfectly but his looks and accent are perfect for it whereas I don't think he would have made as convincing a Ramsay. Ramsay needs to look a little more 'pretty' while having those crazy eyes, which Iwan Rheon has perfected to a T.
3097	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-29	Karl Tanner wouldÂ fit right in at theÂ Dreadfort
3098	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-29	Is Noah Taylor a known actor? I remember him from Almost Famous, Vanilla Ice and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I've seen others asking who he was or saying "he looks familiar!". I thought he was.
Â 


Is it me or does Burn Gorman remind anyone of a young(ish) Willem Dafoe?


Â 
LOL, I've seen the same comment in other sites xD
Â 


Both Karl and Locke are awesome. Also, Karl's actor would have made an extraordinary Ramsay.


Â 
I agree.
Â 


I thought Locke's job was to find Bran and Rickon, not to kill Jon. I can see him "disappearing" during the upcoming raid on Craster's and then continue the hunt solo.


Â 
It's both. Maybe he thinks that Jon knows where they are and he thinks that if he fakes friendship, he'll tell him.
3099	jarl the climber	2014-04-29	I think Locke reallly deserves a really big handÂ  
Â 


I really enjoyed Locke's performance, and I'm glad he's been kept on and included with this new story arc.Â  I could care less about Karl.Â  His performance was lackluster at best, and I hope he gets cut down in the next episode.


Yeah Karl is just a run of the mill scumbag and shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Locke.
3100	Prince of the North	2014-04-29	I like both Locke and Karl - still can't wait to see them both go down, though 
Â 
I had a strange experience flipping through the channelsÂ the other night concerning Burn Gorman.Â  First, I saw that he was in Pacific Rim.Â  Then later he was in AGoT.Â  Then, after that, I happened to see him on AMC in Turn playing a Red Coat.Â  I actually thought to myself "Man, this guy'sÂ everywhere!"
3101	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-29	They are both fantastic actors.
Â 
I hope they have good death scenes, Karl certainly doesn't have long.
Â 
In the promo for episode 5 it looked like Jon initiates the attack by running (with war yell Â ) towards Karl and all the brothers fight it out. I'm betting they really hyped up Karl being a 'legendary' killer so JonÂ will lookÂ impressive when he kills him.
Â 
Rast will be killed by Ghost because they have history- Ghost tormenting him in Season 1 and Rast tormenting Ghost in the cage.
Â 
However, Locke is a wildcard....I have no idea what will happen with him. I really love not knowing for a change!
3102	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-29	I think the Karl scene is superlong and doesn't add much except the "gift to the gods" chant by Craster's wives. Â It is a full five minutes from the Karl scene to when Rast hears the raven.
Â 
That said... I love Locke the Spy. Â He was slightly over-the-top last season, but he's killing it this year. Â I've enjoyed Noah Taylor in everything, especially "Shine."
3103	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-29	Karl's being absolutelyÂ filthyÂ gave us an excellent image of just how disgusting human beings can be. That whole scene made a lot of sense to me once i saw what was happening with that baby and the Others. Everything made sense and i cant bitch about "boob quota" cuz really, the illustration and contrast between Karl and Craster's Keep and the Others/Land of Always Winter is a huge slap in the face. Its brilliant. Gorman's macabre portrayal of this character and Rast in reaction is just incredible. Contrast the quiet, orderly Others..
Wow. Just wow.
Â 
As for Locke, im really interested in where he goes. I like how the actor can be a really horrible person and then turn around and pretend to be a nice guy. Hes pretty great and will provide an excellent adversary for Jon to bounce off of. Those two look like they got enough chemistry to work it. Â

Agreed. Â Hope he lasts through the Keep battle. Â I think he could be a strong voice for Jon in the choosing.
3105	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-30	I absolutely love Locke. Last season I didn't pay much attention to him but he is really standing out this season, the actor playing him really knows what he is doing. I hope he stays around a while. I know this would never happen but I secretly hope he turns good (lol ya right). Or more realistically if he stays into next season he could be the one whoÂ 
	Spoiler get the events in motion that lead up to Jon being stabbed by his brothers



Â 
Locke is played by Noah Taylor. I highly suggest checking out some of his other work... even movies where he plays lesser roles (Red Dog, The Proposition). He is not nearly as well recognised as he deserves to be.
3106	Arry Lannister	2014-04-30	Is there any chance for Karl to get spared by Jon? He did say to capture/kill them. I like to imagine him sparing Karl since they need men for the battle against Mance, then Karl will die taking some bastard wildlings with him. (probably wont happenÂ   ). Karl is fucking too awesome to die and based on some footage that I saw before he uses a fucking KNIFE against Jon (using longclaw). Can't get more awesome than that!
3107	Bearson	2014-04-30	I wonder if Locke in the next episode or the episode following that, is going to replace Sam's role as..."lobbyist" for a certain someone in a certain something. Locke's anti-nobility sentiments could come in handy there.Â  
Â 
Oh, and as for performance, really like Locke. Actually like him better than Vargo Hoat, who was pretty one-dimensional in the books (mostly because GRRM can't give everyone chapters fleshing out their character's and making them feel more real). Karl otoh... well, I honestly thought he was a new character up untill then, and him boasting with Mormont's skull about his past in one scene isn't enough for me to find him interesting as a character. The actor did well, though. He honestly looked drunk...on power.

3108	Fog Machine	2014-04-30	Great to see Taylor (Locke) and Gorman (Karl) getting the attention/praise they deserve here... when I read the books originally I had Taylor in mind for Hoat and I really believe he could have played that role and made him both darkly comic and creepily malevolent- first saw him in a fantastic Australian coming of age movie 'The Year My Voice Broke' (also featuring Ben Mendelsohn and Bruce Spence, the gyrocopter pilot from Mad Max 2), in which he was brilliant (and in it's sequel 'Flirting' with Thandie Newton, Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts- both are worth seeking out although a world away from GoT).Â  He turned up in an episode of Inspector Morse, Shine (as the young David Helfgott), Lana Croft Tomb Raider, The Life Aquatic and much more (already referred to in this thread).
Â 
He also played Hitler in the film 'Max'.Â  He's definitely an actor who should be more widely known (and appreciated).
Â 
Burn Gorman, like Taylor, is a great character actor, if he turns up in anything it's usually worth a look, even if it's just for the scenes he's in.Â  He got his debut in the British soap, Coronation Street, but I think it was the BBC adaptation of 'Bleak House' when I first started taking notice, the series was full of scene stealing actors (particularly Charles Dance) and Gorman as the hapless rather weaselly Guppy seemed to steal every scene he was in against some stiff competition.Â  He then went on to appear in 'Torchwood' where, I presume, many sci-fi/fantasy fans will know him from previously.
Â 
Both Gorman and Taylor are adept at taking some pretty stark (small 's') roles and humanising them, giving the characters depth.Â 
Â 
I suspect Karl will be offed first, unless he returns to the wall? Is that possible? The NW isn't in a position to be choosy... it seems unlikely, but...
Â 
As for Locke, because I'm such a fan of Taylor's I hope he sticks around.Â  As for Locke saying his vows, he had to, to keep close to Jon, his thinking is that Jon is his ticket to finding Bran, the repercussions of that don't occur to him.Â  If Bran and co do escape Locke can push Jon to go after them (with 'new Brother' Locke by his side, of course).
3109	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-30	Aside from bigger things he is in I specifically remember Burn Gorman (Karl) playing sort of a sophisticated, funny but serious type scientist on an episode of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"..
3110	Cat of the First Men	2014-04-30	Is Noah Taylor a known actor? I remember him from Almost Famous, Vanilla Ice and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I've seen others asking who he was or saying "he looks familiar!". I thought he was.



Noah Taylor's well known to anyone who's seen Australian films. Â His first film was Dogs in Space in 1986. Â A vastly underrated film, if you ask me, because audiences didn't realize that Michael Hutchence (RIP) was playing a severely short sighted man who had lost his glasses at the beginning of the film. Â Anyway, I'm biased ... it was mainly filmed at a friend's house so I loved the scene & the (true) story of heroin addicts living there in the 1970s. Â Since then he's been in about 40 films, so his face will be familiar to many... Â http://en.wikipedia....iki/Noah_Taylor. Â Bangkok Hilton (1989), for example, starred a very young Nicole Kidman. Â In Shine (1996), the film which took Geoffrey Rush from stage to immediate fame on screen, Noah played the younger version of Geoffrey Rush's character. Â In recent years he's continued to play supporting actors, but in Hollywood as well as Australia.
This brings me to a point people have been making about Locke's accent. Â Most of the northerners in the show have northern English /Irish or Scottish accents. Â Locke doesn't even attempt a northern accent & his natural Australian accent is closer to the accent in Essex (near London) than the north of England. Â From that point of view it would be odd if Jon recognized Locke as a northerner from his accent, because he clearly has the wrong one. Â Whether or not the character as written actually originally comes from the north is a different question. Â Roose Bolton could have taken on a southerner in his service... Â unless a "real" origin on Bolton land was mentioned somewhere. Â

Â 
Yuck! No! Jon can't spare this nasty meatbag any mercy - he killed Commander Mormont ffs! Jon's made it clear in his speech to gain volunteers for his forray that this is not only to stop the wildlings from getting ahold of the mutineers but for justice against Mormont's betrayal / murder. There is no way they're going to spare Karl, no matter how awesome and evil he's portrayed and the actor who is playing him!
3112	Fog Machine	2014-04-30	Um, being from Essex, I'm confused by your comment that:
Â 


Locke doesn't even attempt a northern accent & his natural Australian accent is closer to the accent in Essex (near London) than the north of England.


Â 
Has this ever been true? That Australian and Essex accents are somehow alike? Or are you saying that because Taylor is Australian, him attempting an English accent ends up with someone who sounds (to your ear) like they come from Essex?Â 
Â 
As for the geography of Westeros and all it's attendant dialects and accents matching that of England that precisely then why has Karl who grew up in Gin Alley in King's Landing in the South got a Mancunian accent (NW England)?
Â 
To me the accents matter much less than the acting performances and characterisations.Â  Here in England just because you come from the North doesn't mean you have a Northern accent, it's where you're from in the North, which city or region and then whereabouts in that city or region, what your social class may be, or how you'd want your social class to appear, also your age, so many factors are involved... there are so many variables and subtleties.Â  It must be the same in every country?Â  But to transfer all those variables and subtleties to a fictional world and have the whole cast accurately meet all those requirements every time they deliver a line... well, I don't recall anyone trying to pin accents down to specific places in any other TV or film production... but I'm sure somewhere on the net there are examples.
Â 
I think if we attempted to identify specific locations in GoT with specific regional/local accents in the real world we'd find it's not just Locke or Karl or any of the Lannisters whose accents match where we make believe they should come from.Â  To me it would be a foolhardy thing for anyone to attempt (this is where somebody directs me to a thread).
3113	SMF269	2014-04-30	Love Karl and Locke, but hell I love Stannis, Little Finger, Joffrey, Ramsey.....basically all of the douches on the show.Â Â  I just find their characters and their motivations so much more interesting.
3114	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-04-30	Karl is going to get quite a bit of appreciation soon...courtesy of Jon and Longclaw. Can't wait!
3115	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-04-30	I can't look at Locke without thinking of Christopher Guest in Princess Bride, but I can appreciate him.

They might spare him to make an example of him back at the Wall. But he'll probably be killed off right of the bat by either Jon, Locke, Ghost or a combination.

lol, ya.Â  Inigo should be the one teaching Jamie how to fight lefty.
3120	Jonsblock	2014-04-30	Really I think these two steal the scenes they are in. Locke was absolutely brilliant from the outset. A much better option than Vargo and Zollo in my opinion, Vargo was just too flamboyant and out-there for TV. Both he and Karl had a great episode. Karl drinking from Mormonts skull was a bit much, but I loved the way he went on his little bragging sesh. Karl was brilliant when he took down Craster too. I assume both of these guys are going down soon, mores the pity, cuz they are a delight to watch. I don't think there's any way out for either of them, is there? Do you think Jon will cotton on to Locke before the shit goes down? Would be a good development of Jon's judgement if he did.


I love Karl's character!! Something about his voice. I often find myself saying "but you are bastard. A daughter fucking, wildling, bastard."
3121	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-30	Â

Yeah, Oberyn is kind of the Inigo Montoya of this series now that I think about it. I think things work out a little better for Inigo all in all though. lol

I have to admit I missed Karl's Mancunian accent (must be why I found his speech a little odd at first...). Â  Karl's accents & your other points agree with what I was trying to say: that its virtually impossible for a Show! character to believably recognize another character's origin by their accent because the various actors' accents are all over the place. Â  Â 
As for the Essex / Australian accent link, it was a surprise to me when I first heard it, too. Â It is known that the General Australian accent is an amalgam of regional accents of immigrants to Sydney in the late 18th century. Â Out of the mixture, the dominant influence ended up being from the South East of England. Â Some say that the dominant influence was Cockney. Â  Others say that some elements of the Australian accent appear only in Essex, rather than Cockney.
To me the Essex accent sounds nothing like an Australian one, but that's probably because I'm Australian. Â The first I heard of the Essex - Australian accent similarity was while working in London in the 90s. Â I was working with someone from Essex who was glad to have some real Australians around because it stopped him from being mistaken for one! Â

There are regional accents in Australia too. They are just very subtle. It didn't all derive from Sydney.
3124	Mikaele	2014-05-03	I was legitimately upset when Karl was drinking out of Mormont's skull. Poor Jeor
Â 
BUT I really like Karl as a character, too bad he'll be dead in the next episode or two. Every line he has is gold, and he delivers it incredibly.
Â 
One thing I hope the show doesn't do is have Locke replace Bowen Marsh. It's much more tragic when it's Bowen rather than someone we know is there for the sole purpose to kill Jon.
3125	Obsidious	2014-05-03	I've only just finished the first book again for my re-read project, but I'm kinda cloudy on this whole "going to Craster's Keep" event in the show... did it ever happen in the books? I don't recall Jon ever giving the idea of them, only of the wildings coming up from the south and Mance's army in the north. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh, that the show is different in many ways than the book series, and just want some confirmation that this is one of them.
Â 
And if Bran and Jon somehow hook up and their stories intertwine, I'm gunna be pissed!! Jon's not even supposed to know that Bran's north of the Wall, let alone alive. >.<
3126	Obsidious	2014-05-03	One thing I hope the show doesn't do is have Locke replace Bowen Marsh. It's much more tragic when it's Bowen rather than someone we know is there for the sole purpose to kill Jon.

With you 100% on that. I hope we get to see Bowen Marsh more often in the show to give it that good ol' build up for the emotionally visual beat-down.Â
3127	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-04	I must admit cheering at "...But you are a bastard. A daughter fucking wildling bastard"

3128	Roxane De	2014-05-04	That awkward moment when a random useless character becomes more frightening than Ramsay Snow... I thought they removed the hunt/rape from Ramsay because it was too gross to watch on the TV, but this episode proved me wrong. So show watchers will end up hating Karl more than they will hate Ramsay.
3129	Hath4	2014-05-04	The hunting of tansy was pretty brutal I mean she was eaten alive by dogs for fun. That's really sick. Karl is terrible but not as sick as ramsay. feeding girls to dogs is a whole new low.

Â 
Yeah I have to agree Ramsay is way way more twisted than Karl by far. Karl's ACTOR is really the only thing that's made Karl the character come alive moreso than in the books to be honest. Everyone loved his performance in that scene so much they're trying to morph him into a Ramsay replacement and while I'm sure the actor could have pulled it off, there's no way in seven hells Karl the character was more sadistic than Ramsay. Viewers just spent all last season watching Ramsay torture Theon into the mess he's become (Reek) and now we've seen the other nasty things Ramsay likes to do for sport as well - so I doubt anyone's going to forget just how evil Ramsay is in favor of Karl's particular brand of villainy. Karl's a low-life thug and vicious backstabber that's for sure but he's not sadistic in the same way Ramsay is by far. Ramsay's a born psychopath.
3131	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-04	Karl's scene was very macabre. I liked it a lot. I think the sentimentality that drives his character is what makes him so interesting; from reminding himself of his rise from Gin Alley, threatening Rast to prove what a warrior he is (or was), to keeping Mormont's skull and a caged direwolf as trophies of his "success".
Â 
Also; "You look like a fucking ball sack."
Â 
Glad we're getting more of Locke, too. Vargo works in the books, as he's a weirdly twisted character; but I think Locke fits the tone of the show better. He's twisted in his own way, and I like that he's working for Roose which helps tie in The Wall with The North story a bit earlier. Noah has been killing it, and I weirdly enjoyed his interaction with Jon despite wanting to scream No don't trust him!.


 Â  with everything you said here.. They've managed to make these virtually one-dimensional characters quite interesting..
And the ball sack line.. Classssic!
I think Locke could be going down as early as tonight though! And Karl (focking) Tanner is obviously working on borrowed time..
But once Locke spots Bran, all heck will break loose!
In the end I see Jon and company piling up the Mutineers(and possibly Locke's) bodies in Craster's Keep and putting it to the flame..
I just knew to enjoy these guys while they lasted... And boyyy did I!
As I pointed out in another thread.. I think everyone I know has gotten a taste of my Karl Tanner impression this week.
3132	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-05-04	I sure hope Karl (FOCKING) Tanner is enjoying his last remaining hours. But I'm sure he has. After all, I've heard that he was a LEGEND.

It became to our attention that tonight's episode titled "Oathkeeper" has had a prominent appearance of one of the essential figures of ASOIAF book series. We are referring of course, to Ser Pounce, theÂ legendaryÂ member of the Kittenguard, and one and only Pussy that was promised. Due to your rather knownÂ practice of minimizing the importance of such crucial characters, shown in season III when on horror of the book readers, another important figure Puddles was changed with his brother Shruds in a scene that changed entire show. Now, let me assure you that we will not tolerate any sort of minimization of the role Ser Pounce has to play. We are fine with you changing the details of the unimportant storylines like Jon's, Dany's, Tyrion's, for their role is so linear and uninspiring. But please, have in mind that Ser Pounce deserves a royal treatment and that you should behave accordingly. I know you may not read this, but let me point you that according to the latest polls 57,64% of your show's viewership are Ser Pounce's fans, and that they will demand the best for Ser Pounce. Thank you so much for reading our letter and addressing our concerns.

3142	James of House Stark	2014-04-27	ser Pounce is the best...
3143	Baltan	2014-04-27	When Tommen said Ser Pounce? I squealed like a fool. My unsullied family all asking me What?! Who's Ser Pounce? Where?!
Â 
When they saw it was a cat they looked at me in disappointment. Even though show viewers won't fully appreciate Ser Pounce, it was one of the best scenes Marg-Ser Pounce-Tommen.

Â 
Love it!
3145	SerJorahMormont	2014-04-27	Ser Pounce > Dany
3146	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-27	everyone i was watching it with got really confused and than angry at me because i was literally rotflol when i heard "ser pounce?" i couldnt stop laughing for like three minutes. i was soooo happy
3147	Bolton's Bastard	2014-04-27	My excitement for Ser Pounce, however great, was quickly overshadowed by the presence of Margaery. Gods, that woman is breathtakingly gorgeous.
3148	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-27	Oh, Ser Pounce, you cockblock, you!
Â 
Glad he made the cut, though. Now all I need is Lady Whiskers and the cat shipping will begin *laughs like a maniac*
3149	Cyril	2014-04-27	I was a bit worried that they'd remove him, but I almost squeed when I saw him.
Â 
Much love for Ser Pounce.
3150	TaenaOfMyr	2014-04-27	My excitement for Ser Pounce, however great, was quickly overshadowed by the presence of Margaery. Gods, that woman is breathtakingly gorgeous.


Â 
My thought during that scene was just how lucky Tommen was. Yeah, your brother died, which must suck, but now you get to be king and marry her?
3151	Trebla	2014-04-27	Bryan Cogman tweeted out that the cat was a nightmare to work with. Whatever. He's Ser Pounce, a better knight than YOU! 
Â 
ETA: Ser Pounce was actually trending for awhile after the episode. I was most amused!

This was great... bravo!
3153	Darkbringer	2014-04-28	Yay for Ser Pounce! Nice of them to include this little detail when they have cut so many others for no reason. Tommen is absolutely spot on as well (if necesarilly a little old)
3154	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-28	I love Ser Pounce... now they only have to include Balerion the black cat in the show to make me forget rapist-Jaime.

3159	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce must be the Lord Commander of Hot Pie's Kingsguard.
Â 
Â 
It is known.
3160	Mel_Rose	2014-04-28	Tommen: Ser Pounce?
Â 
Me: Yeah!!! *punching the air*
3161	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-28	Tommen is the king that Westeros needs, at least he is a responsible pet owner.
3162	Lasicka	2014-04-28	Am I weird if I consider ser PounceÂ´s appearance the second best thing in this episode?  (first being Jaime/Brienne, I just love them Â Â )
Â 
Do you think ser Pounce will attend the coronation next episode?Â  Â
3163	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	You know your fanbase is crazy when everyone is fanatical about a cat.
Â 
Seriously though, I laughed when Tommen said "Ser Pounce?". Such a silly thing to like, really, but I appreciated it all the same (and just another reason of why I love Tommen!).
Â 
Props to B.Cogman - the man cops some (unfair) flack on Twitter by book fans, but damn it if he doesn't know how to write a great episode and include those special details for readers!Â
3164	intheswamp	2014-04-28	YES!Â  They kept Ser Pounce.Â  My crackpot theory lives on:
Ser Pounce sat on the Iron Throne licking himself.Â  Nearby, Queen Whiskers and his hand, Boots, ordered the guards to dispose of Tommen's body.Â  King Pounce, first of his name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms will rule over Westeros with an iron paw.Â
3165	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-04-28	Do we have any pictures of that cute cat?
3166	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-28	YES!Â  They kept Ser Pounce.Â  My crackpot theory lives on:
Ser Pounce sat on the Iron Throne licking himself.Â  Nearby, Queen Whiskers and his hand, Boots, ordered the guards to dispose of Tommen's body.Â  King Pounce, first of his name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms will rule over Westeros with an iron paw.Â 

is Ser Pounce a secret Targarian? I think so.
3167	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-28	I see everything is set in motion for Tommens' untimely dead by basilisk blood, at the hands of none other than Ser Pounce.  Yeah Tommen and Ser Pounce are so cute, get attached, that's exactly what they want.
3168	Bear Island	2014-04-28	I was -so- excited to see Ser Pounce, and I hope to see the rest of the Kittenguard. I also have three kitties < 3
3169	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce > Dany


Â 
 
Â 
Also happy with how Tommen was shown with it. It was well done.
Â 
I am confident they are going to play it in a reasonable and effective way, even though cats are my mortal enemies.
3170	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	You know your fanbase is crazy when everyone is fanatical about a cat.


Â 
Welcome to the internet.
Â 
I expect there is already an explosion of karma on reddit.
3171	-Ghost-	2014-04-28	I fucking loved that they kept Ser Pounce. When Tommen said his name, I freaked out for a second.
3172	Not a kneeler	2014-04-28	Thank God they kept the cat. D&D can cut, change, fiddle with, and do other strange things, but if they had cut Ser Pounce, it would have all over.
Â 
Some details make the difference between the ordinary and greatness.
3173	The Fourth Head	2014-04-28	Delighted with Ser Pounce's inclusion. That character was excellently cast, and his opening moment an entirely appropriate "pounce" onto the bed just as we were all anticipating Margery to "pounce" on the poor underaged Tommen. Â A true knight, to defend your king's honour!
Â 
A brilliant scene: the Joffrey evil, Tommen: adorable direction is a brilliant twist. Though I can't help feeling Bloodraven does not approve of Margary's behaviour!
3174	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-28	Who the hell needs Ser Boros the Belly Blount guarding your door plus 3 other Kings Guard in the room when you have motherfucking Ser Pounce on the case? Cersei is so paranoid, our ferocious feline would make quick work of any trespasser he deemed dangerous.Â
3175	Silverin	2014-04-28	is Ser Pounce a secret Targarian? I think so.


No, he is too glorious to have that tainted bloddline in him, not to mention he ain't no clishA© secret prince.
Ser Pounce is a true knight who has risen above all based on his own achivements, hard work and noble attitude. A truer knight has never been seen before.
Only incompetent fools need boodline to back up their greatness. Those who truly are great are so, even if their mother is just an ordinary stray cat, since their greatness shines trough them.
3176	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	We can confirm now: Ser Pounce IS NOT the Night's King.
3177	JonSnew	2014-04-28	Here is a Google Trends graph, showing the sudden skyrocket in searches for "Ser Pounce" in April of this year.

3179	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-28	When Tommen said Ser Pounce? I squealed like a fool. My unsullied family all asking me What?! Who's Ser Pounce? Where?!
Â 
When they saw it was a cat they looked at me in disappointment. Even though show viewers won't fully appreciate Ser Pounce, it was one of the best scenes Marg-Ser Pounce-Tommen.


Â 
^This! Â My hubby was like "Why are you happy about a cat?" Â One of those you just had to be there kind of moments, with there being the books and this community.
3180	Ser PeaCH	2014-04-28	While it is great and glorious to have this Ser Pounce scene I am gravely nervous that owing to Tommen's advancing years we are going to be denied his greatest moment (so far) from the books.Â  I'm speaking of course of his solemn promise to outlaw beets.
3181	Belisarius09	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce > Dany
3182	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	Sorry, but Ghost was sooo much more impressive than the dumb cat. 
Â 
Why is no one caring about the Direwolves?
3183	Reinzer	2014-04-28	God dammit I was expecting Tommen to get it on with Margeary. But yay for Ser Pounce!
3184	voodooqueen126	2014-04-28	Tommen is the king that Westeros needs, at least he is a responsible pet owner.


but has he had him spayed and vaccinated?
3185	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-28	Sorry, but Ghost was sooo much more impressive than the dumb cat. 
Â 
Why is no one caring about the Direwolves?

I am a direwolf fan, but ever since they became grown their cuteness factor has diminished. And while I can probably say I'd like Lady best of all, the likes of Ghost or Summer cannot compete with Ser Pounce. 
Now, if Ser Pounce were to encounter Meribald's dog it would be a battle for the ages...
3186	Ser Eric	2014-04-28	Sorry, but Ghost was sooo much more impressive than the dumb cat. 
Â

Â 
Blasphemy!
Â 
Ser Pounce would have Ghost for breakfast.
3187	AZAXD	2014-04-28	I think that's one of the few things I liked this time around. When he said Ser Pounce, I was happy for a moment.
(And I don't even like cats, that's the thing... It's just, that was Tommen.)


I also don't like cats! Mostly because of tumblry type people making such a huge deal of them. But I loved Ser Pounce being there
3188	Woman of War	2014-04-28	My cat would scratch out every direwolf's eyes in no time. But he'd know better: he 'd make those giant puppies jump at his sight, just like like he does with the neighbours' golden retriever who weighs more than I do. 
No, no evil murderer can get past Ser Pounce.

3196	The Monkey	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce is probably the one that killed Joffrey, for threatening to cook him all those years ago. He bribed/threatened Olenna and Littlefinger to take the blame for it, because that's just how he rolls. He's a cool cat.Â
3197	The Fourth Head	2014-04-28	Who would have predicted that Littlefinger was working for Ser Pounce?!

So Olenna and Littlefinger are merely catspaws?
3199	The Amethyst Empress	2014-04-28	I believe Ser Pounce is a gallant knight whose dream was to join the Kingsguard.
Unfortunately he was cursed by a witch and turned into a cat!Now he hangs around the King to protect him.

Â One does not â<U+0080><U+009C>trainâ<U+0080><U+009D> cats. Â If one is very lucky, you and the cat may come to a sort of mutual understanding with occasional coA¶peration. For a spell.
Â 
But Ser Pounce has a secret, too, probably as great a secret as Varysâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and maybe more so.Â 
Â 
The lighting was low and warm from the candle so it was hard to tell for absolute cerrtain, but if you stop the video you can see that Ser Pounce has a mix of black-and-orange markings instead of pure black.Â  Ser Pounce is a tortoiseshell cat so must carry two X chromosomes! Â You simply canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get those markings without one X Â chromosome that says â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a black kittyâ<U+0080><U+009D> and another X chromosome that says â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m an orange kittyâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Â 
That means one of two things must be true. Either Ser Pounce is really a perfectly normal XX she-kitty, or else is an extremely rare male tortoiseshell, either an XXY or more complex mosaAc. Â If he is a boy after all, then he is extremely special indeed. Â But he probably isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a boy at all.
Â 
In which case it might well be that King Tommy will be getting brand spanking new kittens just where he least expects it: from Ser Pounce herself!
3218	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	So Ser Pounce is going to win the game of thrones right? You guys noticed that really menacing pan downwards to under Tommen's bed after Margery left right?
Ser Pounce is just biding his time.

Love this :-)
3220	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-29	Doesn't sound like we will get much more Ser Pounce. Natalie Dormer hated working with the Cat, since i geussthey are hard to train.

Â 
Source?
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
...although it's funny that like Tommen, Ser Pounce was also aged up.
Â 
I always imagined Ser Pounce to be a shorthair, for some reason.


Â 
Â 
I feel the same.

3221	Seneti	2014-04-29	Sorry, but Ghost was sooo much more impressive than the dumb cat. 
Â 
Why is no one caring about the Direwolves?


Â 
I care about and love them both equally  Does that count?
3222	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-29	I love Ser Pounce and was so glad to see him included. I did not see him as a tortoiseshell, he looked like a long hair gray to me. In the book I think he is black with a torn ear IIRC. Ser Pounce offered an interlude of innocence and warm fuzzy feelings for book readers. Tommen is not Tommen without his cat(s). And how can anyone on the show think they can direct a cat? They obviously know nothing about cats!!!! I also imagined him as a shorthair.
Â 
I have to say that the situation the Direwolves are in makes me very upset, I cannot stand to see them killed or suffer. Lady and Greywind were enough. I sure hope Summer and Ghost get out of their cages/traps next week and help defeat the mutineers.
Â 
And where were the dragons? I expected to see them flying around but maybe that was not in the budget.
Â 
Meow....

3224	briantw	2014-04-29	I'm torn, I want Ser Pounce to have a royal connection but I want stannis to be king.

Ser Pounce is basically a lock to end up like Rhaenys' cat, roaming the castle long after his owner is dead.
3225	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-29	I legit thought Ser Pounce would be cut. I'm very happy to have been proven wrong.
Â 
...although it's funny that like Tommen, Ser Pounce was also aged up.
Â 
I always imagined Ser Pounce to be a shorthair, for some reason.
Its all because of child labour laws and contracts etc. Ser Pounce requires an extraordinary number of hours screentime, and as such they had to age him up. Furthermore, given the heinous and cruel scenes he is exposed to (the Beets! the Beets! oflh the horror!) it makes we as viewers feel more comfortable to hqve him older. to Ser Pounce
3226	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-29	This scene restored my faith, but if they mess up Ser Pounce's character, I swear I am done with this show.

3227	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	Â One does not â<U+0080><U+009C>trainâ<U+0080><U+009D> cats. Â If one is very lucky, you and the cat may come to a sort of mutual understanding with occasional coA¶peration. For a spell.
Â 
But Ser Pounce has a secret, too, probably as great a secret as Varysâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and maybe more so.Â 
Â 
The lighting was low and warm from the candle so it was hard to tell for absolute cerrtain, but if you stop the video you can see that Ser Pounce has a mix of black-and-orange markings instead of pure black.Â  Ser Pounce is a tortoiseshell cat so must carry two X chromosomes! Â You simply canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get those markings without one X Â chromosome that says â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a black kittyâ<U+0080><U+009D> and another X chromosome that says â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m an orange kittyâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Â

Awwwwwwwww, I had a male tortoiseshell once.Â  Now, I have to pay better attention to Ser Pounce on the rewatch.Â  In the dark, the coloring was hard to distinguish, but I thought he seemed to be more of a long haired tabby, dark colored.Â  He didn't seem full grown either, but not a baby kitten.Â  I hope this nonsense about ND not liking the cat isn't true and doesn't cost us more Ser Pounce scenes.Â

I know a guy who trained a cat to 1) walk on a leash 2) come when called 3) use the toilet. He actually trained both his cats this way. I don't see why it'd be so hard, just hire my acquaintance. Furthermore, I don't see why they'd need to have him on cue to have him in a scene. Surely he can just sleep on camera on a cushion. He doesn't need to jump out of nowhere protecting Tommen's honor every time.Â

I reiterate my point he can just be doing cat stuff in the background without needed to do something on cue, so I feel they're being deliberately obtuse. Second, Dormer looks like a cat how can she be against them!?!? NOOO!

I also want to point out SER Pounce is the only one of the King's Guard who did his duty and defended Tommen against the advances of the Tyrell woman.

And im loving how that cat is a Maine Coon. At least it looks like it. As an owner of one very fluffy Maine Coon, this pleases me.

Cats are notoriously hard to shoot scenes with, because they never seem to do what you want them to do, even if it is something simple as jumping on the bed and having somebody run their hands through their fur. There's a hilarious outtake for Criminal Minds where one of the characters was supposed to pick up her cat on the way out of her apartment, give him a quick kiss and then put him down again. Sounds easy, right? Well they needed dozens of takes because the cat just didn't want to stand still long enough to be picked up...

3282	Kaspiro	2014-04-28	Not particularly about this episode, but seeing this picture a few days ago on Winter is Coming brought Lady Stoneheart back to the front of my mind. Have there been any updates on whether she's been cast or not? Is this confirmation?
3283	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	they would def wanna keep that secret but after seeing brienne and pod leave to find sansa after this episode i have a good feeling we might see her in the finale. all they would need is michelle fairley for a quick scene.
3284	Lord Stokeworth	2014-04-28	They made at least two mentions of Catelyn Stark the last episode. One in particular where Jaime points out that she's dead.
That seems like a future set up
3285	King Tommen	2014-04-28	And Sansa mentioned in the premiere that they slit her throat and tossed her in the river. Not sure why you would include that piece of information unless you were setting something up for later.
3286	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	In some tabloid "Game of Thrones Spoilers" video on Youtube they interviewed the actors asking for hints on what's to come. They were asked questions about the series and while the actors tried to make it sound like they were just guessing (except for Tywin, he straight up spoiled his death and laughed) it's pretty obvious as a book reader that they're just telling the future.
Â 
Notably, when asked "If you could bring any character back to life, who would it be?" With a smile, every single one of them said "Catelyn." Haha, as if. They clearly know.
3287	Runaway Bunny	2014-04-29	Yeah filming her scene would be on the downest of lows and probably would only need her for the reveal of her face as they could use a body double with a hood up for the rest. She'll most definitely be one of the last scenes in the finale if not the last scene.
3288	FNF	2014-04-29	Well apparently Brienne bites someone's ear off so it would be fair to suggest that she will hook up with LS by the end of the season.
3289	ontherunagain	2014-04-29	Until recently, I've been very unsure about Stoneheart's appearance on the show. In the early days, I assumed she wouldn't be used because of the large of amount of unused book material at the time. However, the show is clearly running full speed ahead at this point, and I have no idea what the producers plan on doing with Jaime and Brienne moving forward. It seems as if their only two options are either a big deviation from the books, or have Brienne meet Stoneheart quite soon. I feel like the show has some potential to make those interactions a bit more epic than they were in the books too. (i'm referring to the fact that we barely ever see Stoneheart in the books in the first place). My only worry is that we have yet to see nor hear anything regarding The Brotherhood without Banners this season. If we ever get a pov scene from Beric and Thoros in the show, that confirms Stoneheart in my eyes.Â
3290	Mother of Mountains	2014-04-29	We know Richard Dorner is in this series, I can't see any reason to keep Beric Dondarion around unless it's for the Lady Stoneheart reveal.
3291	Chebyshov	2014-04-29	They made at least two mentions of Catelyn Stark the last episode. One in particular where Jaime points out that she's dead.
That seems like a future set up


Â 
This. Think about how many mentions of the Iron Bank we got before Davos's light bulb moment to write to them last episode. They're purposely peppering in these mentions, just like they're subtly laying the groundwork for other reveals.
3292	'96Buck	2014-04-29	I figured she's a reveal in E10, Children...Children of the Forest, yeah, obvious, but I suspect each Stark will be "settled" in the Episode, and then show Catelyn, as well, to emphasize the uniting element.
3293	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-29	If Brienne doesn't find Stoneheart, what is she supposed to do until season 6? wander the realm asking for a fair maid with auburn hair?
3294	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	Well apparently Brienne bites someone's ear off so it would be fair to suggest that she will hook up with LS by the end of the season.


Â 
I'm more hopeful that the LS reveal is the hanging of a Merrett Frey.Â  I'm not so sure they're giving up Brienne to a noose, yet.Â  Or putting her that close to a noose?Â
3295	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-29	Also, I am LMAO at Charles Dance just up and spoiling the death of Tywin.Â  I'd like to see a clip of that.....guess I'm off to google, LOLÂ

3297	ontherunagain	2014-04-29	We know Richard Dorner is in this series, I can't see any reason to keep Beric Dondarion around unless it's for the Lady Stoneheart reveal.


Â 
Well if he's confirmed to be in season 4, that just about confirms it. Unless of course D&D decide to go super off canon lol

Personally, I think it would have had more of an impact if we got some mentions (from Tywin maybe) of certain Freys being hanged in the Riverlands and then in the final episode have Brienne come face-to-face with her.
3299	Tyrion Lannister	2014-04-29	And Sansa mentioned in the premiere that they slit her throat and tossed her in the river. Not sure why you would include that piece of information unless you were setting something up for later.


Yep. Â The moment this happened, Stoneheart's eventual appearance was confirmed in my eyes.
Â

That could work. Â One way or another, I hope they don't just jump straight to her scene with Brienne without first establishing how she and the BwB are hunting down RW conspirators.
3300	Ser Jaime the Humbled	2014-04-29	I've always thought Stoneheart would be the last scene of Season 4 as the final WTF moment following a string of them (Moon door, RV vs Mountain, Tywin on the privy). It would blow people's minds if her face was simply the final shot of the season...it would also be the highlight of the series for the casual "twist-driven" fan, a group that will surely lose some interest following this insane season.

I tracked down the video I was talking about Tywin spoils it again. Though I find the video the other guy sent pretty funny because the interviewer clearly wasn't asking for spoilers and she probably just got it spoiled for herself.

Â 
Thank you, thank you, thank you, I'm off to watch it now.Â  I just love watching Charles Dance talk anyway, LOLÂ  I've seen many clips of him on youtube hopping trips, but I hadn't seen that previous one posted.Â  Off to watch.Â
3304	CandleWisps	2014-04-29	I too was worried that they wouldnt include her, but now that I'm 100% they are, it makes me worried for another reason. If she does appear in the very last episode, that means LS's story, tied with Briennes, in season 5 will go by all the quicker. Normally not a bad thing, but it just crunches down the time for GRRM to finish the WoW before the Sullied become the Unsullied
3305	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-29	I hope they go through with the Brienne hanging scene if she will be involved in the LS reveal. Â I hope it isn't a one-shot shocker reveal. Â I'd rather they push LS's new brutality/rage front and center to close it out.
3306	fangirl000	2014-04-29	I imagine the big reveal is going to be the last scene of the season. Â The Brotherhood will fish a mysterious body of out of the river, Beric will pray over her, he will collapse, and the camera will pan to Cat's face. Â Her eyes will open - cut to black, roll credits.Â
3307	NightStark	2014-04-29	I imagine the big reveal is going to be the last scene of the season.

She'd have been in the river a lot longer than three days at this stage, I don't think anyone would believe her body would stand up to months in a river.
Â 
I'd say they'll have her in a hooded robe and she'll meet someone..probably Brienne and pull it down.

The only problem with that is............she'd be a skeleton by that point, LOLÂ  I'm thinking we are going to have to meet her already in action, the ressurection having already happened.Â  Maybe, we'll just get some of the story of how it all happened.Â  I really don't see them being able to hold off on the actual reanimation until the season finale.Â  That in itself wouldn't be believable, IMO.Â

3310	FNF	2014-04-29	I have a feeling the BHWB might have a big role in the books ahead so they might keep Beric Dondarrion alive but have LS as well. If it goes how I suggested earlier this thread, we will have Brienne run into her after biting someone's ear off setting up for next season nicely.

3315	teemo	2014-04-29	I thought she was maybe cut since having her in last season's finale made the most sense chronologically, but Jaime and Brienne got to KL way before they did in the books, so I guess it doesn't really matter. Â I think she'll still definitely appear. Â She better anyway -.-

3317	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-29	I am really torn on what the best way to reveal her would be. On the one hand I think the final scene of the season should be BwB with a mysterious hooded person hanging Freys, and the very final shot being LS dropping the hood for the massive reveal. Tywin dying is huge and that story can take a large part of either ep9 or 10, but the Stoneheart reveal is the bigger lasting impact for a viewer I think. Brienne's final scene of this season should be narrowly escaping Biter and Rorge, then early next season the noose with LS.
Â 
However, for that to be the final shot, the viewer would be left in limbo on how it is that LS came to be for like 9 months. There would need to be mention of or a scene involving Beric using his last revival up on 'someone' beforehand, but then that would lesser the impact of the reveal considerably because i'm sure it would get figured out by the viewers.

Beric: How many times have you brought me back now?
Thoros: Too many...

Catelyn: *gets throat cut at Red Wedding*

Jaime: This sword was forged from Ned's valyrian steel blade
Brienne: I'll find Sansa, Jaime

Brienne: Riding away in black armor, accompanied with Podrick
3319	Blazfemur	2014-04-29	The actual scene, will be after Brienne gets knocked out, the LS reveal, will be in the cave, after brienne awakens, the final cut, will be her casting her first gaze on The Lady That Remembers.
3320	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-29	Beric will definitely have to be involved and alluded to in the previously on. Thoris of Myr as well. Â I think they should be standing on each side of LS for the reveal. Â It would provide a direct connection as to the "HOW" of it all. Â I REALLY hope they don't spoil it by showing the red wedding in the previously on.
Â 
If they show it on the previously on, it will be a dead giveaway to book readers. Â I'd rather be surprised.Â
3321	CandleWisps	2014-04-29	I'm down 100% for the reveal to happen over hanging Frey's. It would unrealistic to start all the way when she first gets reanimated, and I think there would be more of a shock factor to pan away from some dead Frey's to a mysterious cloaked figure.
Â 
We can't really get LS realistically without it being the last episode, as Unsullied will want answers if she appears sooner. However, the season finale will be one hell of a cramped episode (not that I'm complaining), with her, Bran and Company with the Children of the Forest, aftermath of the Battle of the Wall, and what I presume will be Tywin's last episode.
Â 
I'm getting chills just from thinking about it

Â 
It's been a while since I've read the books, but I forget if LS is able to speak. I know she can't do so normally, but isn't she able to pull the gash in her throat closed and whisper? If she can it would be an awesome bit for a final scene with Brienne waking to see LS hooded and cloaked, and then just reaching a hand within the shadows of her hood and this ragged, hoarse whisper rasping out:
Â 
"Where are my daughters?"
3326	Misnthropia	2014-04-29	Well apparently Brienne bites someone's ear off so it would be fair to suggest that she will hook up with LS by the end of the season.


Â 
She bites off Vargo Hoat's ear, he was replaced with Locke, who is now at the wall so that wont happen.
Â 
Its to soon for Brienne to run into her. I suspect, the reveal will be the last scene of S4 after Stannis rides in.
Â 
We cut to a row of bodies hanging from a tree with Frey or Bolton signias on their chests. Brotherhood Without Banners standing around chanting/yelling something about the north and then as the camera pans out we see Cat Stark from behind. She turns around, screams and Lady Stoneheart.
Â 
This lays the foundation for next season where the North remembers.

3328	Misnthropia	2014-04-29	She covers her throat to "speak" but even then its not very good and is very hard to understand.
3329	The Old Tongue	2014-04-29	If we start hearing about Freys getting hanged then that should confirm it. There should also be some Merrett Fret scenes.

her flesh is loose and milky white, she pinches together the slit so it closes, when she speaks it's almost indecipherably raspy, but it's there

Â 
This is possible, but I won't be convinced of anything until the episodes actually air. This is because we get the Battle at the Wall in the 9th episode, and it might be too much of an overload for offing Tywin in the same episode. Then again, if we wait for the last ep it would be an overload regardless because of the Children of the Forest, possibly LS, aftermath at the Wall, etc. HBO released the running times for all the remaining eps though, and the finale is supposed to be 10 minutes longer than the others, leaving more time for whatever deluge they may throw at us

3342	Biobiwan	2014-04-30	Â Maybe the last scene of one of the upcoming episodes: A POV of a direwolf coming up to a river and seeing Cat beneath the shallows, then turns around startled seeingÂ  a group of men (The Brotherhood) and runs away.Â  Then cut to Arya opening her eyes.
Â 
Last episode, last scene, epilogue of ASoS or close.
3343	AzorAhai42	2014-04-30	I am really torn on what the best way to reveal her would be. On the one hand I think the final scene of the season should be BwB with a mysterious hooded person hanging Freys, and the very final shot being LS dropping the hood for the massive reveal. Tywin dying is huge and that story can take a large part of either ep9 or 10, but the Stoneheart reveal is the bigger lasting impact for a viewer I think. Brienne's final scene of this season should be narrowly escaping Biter and Rorge, then early next season the noose with LS.
Â 
However, for that to be the final shot, the viewer would be left in limbo on how it is that LS came to be for like 9 months. There would need to be mention of or a scene involving Beric using his last revival up on 'someone' beforehand, but then that would lesser the impact of the reveal considerably because i'm sure it would get figured out by the viewers.


As long as they spend about 8 - 10 minutes on the scene, they can include a small dialogue (spoken by Anguy, or Thoros of Myr, or anyone really) of how she came to be. It would be powerful, and it would be true to the book.

Having thought of this a while, I don't think they'll end the season with the Brotherhood hanging Brienne.  Rather, I think they'll end it with Brienne seeing Stoneheart for the first time, then cutting to black, which allows them to do the hanging scene next season, along with the accompanying exposition.
And I don't think they need to bother with explaining it this year.  It's a significant WTF moment that should be enough to keep people speculating all through the summer.  They can do the expository scene to open next season where they explain how she was brought back, although I expect most viewers would be smart enough to do the math given their familiarity with Thoros.

Â 
Wasn't it confirmed that Richard Dormer (Beric Dondarrion) is going to be in this season? So I feel like they're going to show us how she comes to be.

I don't think they'll show us, they'll probably just have Thoros explain in few lines, hopefully with 'she remembers' thrown in there.

Â 
Think you're right...turns out it I was wrong about Richard Dormer, but Philip McGinley (Anguy) deleted a tweet about filming S4, so I think he and Thoros were the ones confirmed.
3348	Mother of Mountains	2014-04-30	There's an interview with Richard Dormer on Youtube in which he certainly gives the impression he is in S4 and understands some of the upcoming plot.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=7VJ_8EDjrDkLondon Film and Comic Con was in the first week of July last year, so certainly after much of S4 casting.

She bites off Vargo Hoat's ear, he was replaced with Locke, who is now at the wall so that wont happen.
Â 
Its to soon for Brienne to run into her. I suspect, the reveal will be the last scene of S4 after Stannis rides in.
Â 
We cut to a row of bodies hanging from a tree with Frey or Bolton signias on their chests. Brotherhood Without Banners standing around chanting/yelling something about the north and then as the camera pans out we see Cat Stark from behind. She turns around, screams and Lady Stoneheart.
Â 
This lays the foundation for next season where the North remembers.


Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) has stated that she bites off someone's ear this season. It's also worth saying that the same interview (which I presume was on set), was filmed where they film the Riverlands scenes so she definitely gets some scenes in the Riverlands this season which leads to the ear biting scene which ultimately results in her hooking up with LS. Who's ear does she bite off? Maybe just a random soldier, maybe not.

Â 
I have a feeling that Tywin dies in 9th episode. Mountain vs. Viper duel is in 8th episode according to the episode name, so i don't think they delay the father-son talk to the last episode because it happens before next morning.


Â 
i could see that as the ending for episode 9 then. if MtVsV is 8, how much longer would they wait before you see varys do his thing.
Â 
but 10... 10 is for The Lady.
3351	AzorAhai42	2014-04-30	I think episode 10 will just be jammed pack full of stuff, because my theory is that episode 9 is going to pretty much only be the Wall.Â
3352	Blazfemur	2014-04-30	I wonder how theyre going to make her up. Im so fuckign excited for this. Id assume she wont have the clawmarks running down her cheeks, as she didnt go batshit crazy before getting her throat cut like in the books.

Biter, he straddles her before a sword impales him throught he back fo the head. She may get a bite in, before he overtakes her.
3355	CandleWisps	2014-04-30	I know its doubtful and not plausible at all, but i think it would be comical as all hell to have her try and bite off Thoros's ear Â  the dialogue such a scene would bring would be pure gold
3356	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-30	It would surely be Biter she has a quick snack on right? Poetic justice and all that, as well as we know in the books she has a bit of a roll around in the mud with him.
3357	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-30	If she does show up, I can't remember if it's at the very end of aSoS or the beginning of aFFC, but didn't she catch a Frey and string him up? That's what I'm imagining, I think it's been too long to show Nymeria dragging her out of the water. Or Beric giving her life.

Episode 9 will only be at The Wall, just like Blackwater focused on KL.

Â 
Doubt it :/ Episode 9 should deal solely with the Wall,Â  and if it doesn't only minor-ish things should be included. Cuz if they offed Tywin in the beginning of the episode, audiences would be too caught up in that to focus on the stuff going down at the Wall, and if they ended with offing Tywin, it would draw too much attention away from what just happened with Stannis' rescue etc etc

Â 
This was in the 15 minute foreshadowing video they posted a month before the season started.Â  They also asked her what she misses from season 3 and she said Richard Madden, Oona Chaplin, and Lady Catelyn.Â  I found it odd that she said the two actors and then a character, as if the actress was still around.

I agree they comparedÂ ep. 9Â to the Blackwater episode several times in the preview interviews.Â  They even specifically hired the same director because they loved how the Blackwater looked so well.

Â 
All said, I would not be surprised if Lady Stoneheart does appear at the end of episode 9 after all.Â  They could do a strong 3-5 minute scene at the very end of the episode without doing the hangingÂ and not touch it again in episode 10. Wouldn't cut out too much time from theÂ battle.Â  Leave it as a cliffhanger.Â  Just have her wake up get dragged out to face her accuser and when the veil falls and you can see who it is, leave it just long enough for recognitionÂ andÂ cut to black.
Â 
Ep 10, is going to have Bran and BloodRaven, the aftermath at the wall, Tyrion's escape, Tywin's death, Cersei's reaction,Â Arya getting on the boat with the coin, Something with Ramsey/Reek, the Dornish leaving KL after the trial, and most importantly every season, EVERY season, ends with Dany.Â  That is really packed in there.

3362	Hippocras	2014-05-01	Not particularly about this episode, but seeing this picture a few days ago on Winter is Coming brought Lady Stoneheart back to the front of my mind. Have there been any updates on whether she's been cast or not? Is this confirmation?

Cast? That's an odd question. She is Catelyn. They will use the same actress, plus some effects and makeup.
3363	briantw	2014-05-01	If they did indeed bring Cat back, it's unlikely that they would reveal that she was on set for filming.  It's similar to how they didn't reveal Jason Mamoa was back for the House of the Undying scene in season two.
3364	Tixu Oty	2014-05-01	I am really torn on what the best way to reveal her would be.

Â 
I'd say we need to hear about the Brotherhood hanging Freys sometimes this season. Brienne or Arya can even possibly hear that the Brotherhood got themselves a new leader, and who knows maybe a Lady Stoneheart namedrop.
Then last scene of the season: Frey about to be hanged, sees LS but we only sees her back, his eyes widen in horror/surprise and Thoros or Anguy casually explain, oh yeah, we found her in the river, Beric gave her the kiss of life, she can't speak, but she remembers, Frey hanged, LS drops the hood, big shock.
I can totally see that.
And I think it would be a mistake to have Brienne meet LS this season. Save that for the beginning of next season instead. I do believe we need to have faith in LS's vengeance and really root for her and expect great things before we realize she's wayyyy too vengeful and getting in the way of our other beloved characters.

Â 
I agree with you, and I like your description of how the reveal Â could go down, but I'm starting to think more and more that it will be the Brienne hanging scene. We already know Brienne meets Biter and Rorge this season, and I think the rest of Brienne's journey is going to feel rather flat on television. So unless they want to include the QI stuff and hope that the audience finds it titillating (they won't), I don't see where else Brienne could end up.Â 
Â 
Unless Biter/Rorge is her episode 10 moment (or 8, depending on if we see everyone in the finale), and she meets LS early next season. I guess that could work? Â 
Â 
Either way, you can almost guarantee Brienne and/or Arya will her whisperings about LS.
3368	Tixu Oty	2014-05-01	I agree that Brienne's story will fall flat without the hanging scene, but I think it's alright considering there should be more than enough awesomeness around for this season. Save Brienne's big moments (hanging + going for Jaime) for next season. I say it works.
I don't think the Quiet Isle will be in this season either because: 1/ the casting doesn't suggest it and 2/ I don't expect the Hound and Arya to part before ep 8 and then the timeline just wouldn't fit very well.

I'm just assuming the QI will be cut all-together. I hope you're right about Brienne meeting LS next season though...I think it would work much better.
3370	Tixu Oty	2014-05-01	Hmm I don't really have an opinion on the Quiet Isle for next season yet...
I guess it is kind of flat in itself. Brienne's story doesn't really need it, but if it's cut, I believe it would be needed for her to learn about Arya and the Hound one way or another before she meets Lady Stoneheart. Makes for more drama.
However, it's possible that the Hound's story will need the Quiet Isle. We just don't know that yet. It may be simplified a lot, but I suppose we might get something roughly equivalent.
3371	rmholt	2014-05-01	Â 
Oh thats interesting then, havent seen that interview. Wonder who she needs to maim this season then.

Like hands, ears stick out there and tend to get lost more than other body parts
3372	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	Like hands, ears stick out there and tend to get lost more than other body parts


Â 
You made me think of something, though. The Hound has to die, because his armor (and more importantly, his helmet) has to wash up on quiet isle for elder brother to bury the suit/lay the helmet out for them to take it and Hound 2.0 can be born.
Â 
Storywise, the Hound must lose, at least his armor and DEFINITELY his helmet, for that scene to happen. It's important that the Hound's name gets dragged through the mud, to furthermore bolster his redemptive repentant character arc.
3373	FalseKnight	2014-05-01	I'm really hoping they cut UnCat entirely. I hated the resurrection in the book, and it would be worse on screen. Any surviving northman who hooked up with the Bw/oB would want to kill Freys. They don't need an undead leader for that. Uncat marked the Series' transformation from the rejection of tropes to the proliferation of chiches.
Â 
UnCat's reveal led to the idea that death was a suggestion. After that moment we get UnGregor, UnSandor, and Brienne surviving a hanging. Ironicly enough that hanging was a cliffhanger. Without UnCat, the show can reject that unnecessary cliffhanger.

i feel like GRRM put in LHS just to mess with people....i already have unsullied friends who are hoping for Ned or Rob stark resurrection based on Berric Dondarion and Arya's discussion...showing aÂ resurrection as the cliffhanger of last ep would be enough to drive all of them crazy wondering how she's back and who else could possibly return...

Â

WE are still guessing resurrections and faked deaths ourselves.
I think the reason GRRM resurrected Catelyn will eventually become clearer. It is like there is a "mission" that Thoros's group started, related to prophesies and also driven by them it is clear it has a life of its own and Thoros is not driving it. We will see life passed on in a chain, until it gets to the right person, who fulfills the required mission for that branch of the prophesy. 
My hunch is that it is about the sword, at least in part. In particular, about making sure the sword passes through the required steps to become Lightbringer.
That is why Thoros was famous for his flaming sword, befriended Dondarion who had a stronger flaming sword. Now Oathkeeper is with them and Stoneheart leads the group, and Stoneheart requested the return of the Stark sword.
3377	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-01	I'm not understanding how so many people are suggesting her first scene would be with Brienne. So basically season 5 they will go right into TWOW material for her? The last released Brienne chapter we have is of her meeting LS, so why would the show speed the timeline up so much for this character when most other storylines will be at the end of ASOS?
3378	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-01	^^ very cool! i didn't think about that...though Thoros' flaming sword was just light coat of wildfire  i remember the first time i read berric/hound fight i was convinced that Berric was Azor Ahai...then second reading i noticed the wildfire part...
Â 
still would be fascinating if Ice > Oathkeeper > Lightbringer! only question then is how to get it to Dany/JonÂ  
Â 
btw, is it just me, or does anyone else think that Robert Strong might not be UnGregor, but possible some frankenstein put together by Qyburn?Â

Â 
you are right her last POV was with LSH, but it was in AFfC...given the fact that they will not get to Dorne this season, this is only remaining part to show of hers...unless they buy more time by showing Ser Hugh and Randall Tarly and all of that travelling...then it is possible that they will push LSH to next season...but didnt they confirm that M Fairley shot one scene this season? It wouldnt make sense to show her with just BwB and no Brienne....
3380	acosta	2014-05-01	They'll almost certainly have the Brienne hanging to leave us with a cliffhanger. It's a pretty standard television thing to do. They let the audience think Davos and Sam died at the end of Season 2. They'll let the audience think Brienne dies at the end of Season 4. And they'll probably end Season 5 letting you believe Stannis and Jon are dead.Â
3381	siknes	2014-05-01	Lady Stoneheart isn't revealed until the end of book 3, so at the end of this season D & D will probably have Dondarion give her the gift, and his light.Â 
Â 
Brie doesn't find/run into LS and her men until after she and PodÂ wander the Eastern lands.Â  I foresee only two more scenes of Brie/Pod this season. The trial lasts forever in the book, and the whole time I was saying to myself 'Why not ask the Viper to beÂ Tyrion's champion,' but GRRM wanted to make Tyrion more hateful with everyone testifying against him. "Where do whores go?"
Â 
Since the WW's got their scene already, and D&D like to end seasons with them, it will be a LSÂ reveal of Cat's deformed face and gashed throat.Â
3382	Kaspiro	2014-05-01	Cast? That's an odd question. She is Catelyn. They will use the same actress, plus some effects and makeup.


Â 
Yes, I shouldn't have used the word 'cast'. What I basically meant to say was 'has it been confirmed that Michelle Fairley will be returning this season?'.
3383	ToTheWolves	2014-05-01	Could they possibly do a flashback to a couple days after the red wedding and then show the ressurection? That's another way it could work I think. But iknow they don't really do flashbacks.
3384	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-01	Â 
you are right her last POV was with LSH, but it was in AFfC...given the fact that they will not get to Dorne this season, this is only remaining part to show of hers...unless they buy more time by showing Ser Hugh and Randall Tarly and all of that travelling...then it is possible that they will push LSH to next season...but didnt they confirm that M Fairley shot one scene this season? It wouldnt make sense to show her with just BwB and no Brienne....


Why couldn't her one scene be the exact scene from the book? Shes with the BwB in that scene and she kills a frey which gives the viewers an idea of what her mission is. Leave the Brienne scene for next season where other AFFC material will be.Â
3385	Tixu Oty	2014-05-01	I don't know if Cat was resurrected for a specific reason, and it would be cool if it were the case, but even if it isn't I loved the Lady Stoneheart reveal, not just because it's a resurrection (which otherwise would suck, in a way) but because I see her as THE vengeful mother. You hurt my babies, I'll become your worse nightmare, I'll hunt you down, you, your family, and anyone closely or loosely associated to you. Love the concept. Tiger mommy gone real bad.
3386	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-01	I guess I wasn't aware that Brienne definitely meets up with Rorge and Biter this season. Â Now it makes a little more sense to me why everyone is predicting her to meet with LS this early. However, I still would prefer that the Rorge and Biter scene occur later this season and then she doesn't meet with LS until early next season. I just really like the idea of ending the season just like the book with the big LS reveal and her hanging of a Frey.Â 
Â 
On another note is there anyway Gendry gets recycled into the mix still, despite his deviation from the books? I really liked him saving Brienne by killing Biter.Â

Â Now it makes a little more sense to me why everyone is predicting her to meet with LS this early. However, I still would prefer that the Rorge and Biter scene occur later this season and then she doesn't meet with LS until early next season. I just really like the idea of ending the season just like the book with the big LS reveal and her hanging of a Frey.Â 
Â 
On another note is there anyway Gendry gets recycled into the mix still, despite his deviation from the books? I really liked him saving Brienne by killing Biter.Â 


Â 
We don't definitely know Brienne meets up with Rorge and Biter, do we? It's been confirmed they're in this season, but I think it would make more sense for them to encounter Arya and The Hound, seeing as how there's actually some sort of connection there (Rorge and Biter being at Harrenhal with Arya). It could be how The Hound gets his "fatal" wound. But then that also the begs the question of whose ear Brienne bites off.

I'm not sure what we know. There were just several people on this thread talking about her meeting up with Rorge and Biter so I wasn't sure if they knew something I didn't. Is it confirmed then that she definitely bites someone's ear off?

Gwendoline Christie said she bites off someone's ear and spits it back in their face this season.

Â 
If in this season, it was the last chapter of Brienne in the fourth volume, that will make the writers for the next season? GRRM said he wanted to include chapters for Brienne in the sixth novel, but it is not yet available. This becomes complicated.
I hope that we will see Lady Stoneheart, but with Gendry for example, but before his meeting with Brienne and his companions.

Â 
Thanks for this information Chebyshov
3391	CandleWisps	2014-05-01	At this point, I understand if they wanted to save more substantial Brienne material for next season and have her meet LS in the beginning of Season 5, as long as we still have LS hanging Freys by the finale
3392	Hippocras	2014-05-02	^^ very cool! i didn't think about that...though Thoros' flaming sword was just light coat of wildfire  i remember the first time i read berric/hound fight i was convinced that Berric was Azor Ahai...then second reading i noticed the wildfire part...
Â 
still would be fascinating if Ice > Oathkeeper > Lightbringer! only question then is how to get it to Dany/JonÂ  
Well my theory is not that Oathkeeper, at least alone and in its current form is the new Lightbringer, but that the division of Ice was part of the process of forging it. But that is for a different thread.
For this thread I was responding more to people saying resurrecting Catelyn served no purpose in the books and they hope it gets cut. I think it does serve a purpose. She is part of a necessary chain of events related to the forging of the new Lightbringer. 
There are divergent theories on how and which swords are involved of course. However the fact remains that Thoros was the first character of the books introduced with a flaming sword, and seems to have a bit of a fixation on flaming swords. It is pretty much his mission for R'hllor - to guide the process of creating the sword. Sure, his swords early in the books were a gimmick. He did use wildfire. But when he resurrected Beric, he passed on the flaming sword prophetic mission it seems, and Beric's sword really did burn more authentically. So that was the next step in the process.
 Brienne's arrival with Oathkeeper is another step in some way, and without Catelyn's resurrection, Brienne would not have been captured by the Brotherhood. Oathkeeper itself may now be plunged into the heart of a Lion (Jamie) if you want to interpret it that way. But I think it is more likely that Jamie will live (or be resurrected) and will be tasked by Lady Stoneheart with retrieving Widow's Wail.

3393	Tixu Oty	2014-05-02	I don't understand what's all the fuss with Brienne biting someone's ear off. In the show this happens in Harrenhal, right? That ship has sailed, so they've clearly transposed that to a new situation. I can see why you would think of Biter, since he does bite HER cheek off in the show, but it's really just random guesswork, right? unless I missed something?
Â 
As far as Gendry is concerned, the way I see it, he could pop back up just about anywhere I guess. But if he's to join the brotherhood again to catch up with his book counterpart, I don't think he'd do it willingly (they sold him to Melisandre). It would have to be the consequence of a random encounter, so since I don't see D&D showing us the adventures of Gendry all on his own, he'd have to meet Brienne first. If that doesn't happen, it might be that D&D are going to do something completely invented for him, since I don't see them dropping off this character entirely after the way he was saved.

One very likely theory going around is that Edric Storm is how Aegon manages to take Storm's End "by guile". So Gendy might encounter Varys in KL who will whisk him off to somewhere, to use again later in the Edric Storm plot line for the conquest of the Stormlands for Aegon.

3395	Tixu Oty	2014-05-02	That's interesting, though for now I can't imagine why Varys would want to send a Baratheon bastard to his Targaryen/Blackfyre protA©gA©.
But I don't want to pollute this thread. Do you think you could point me to a thread that discusses this?

To win the loyalty of the Stormlands of course! For Varys, bastards are much safer than legitimate children. And ones that look exactly like their dad are perfect for the job of bringing people onside.
Remember, Edric was almost burned. So Gendry as Edric in the show was also in danger of burning. He has no Stannis loyalty and the Stormlands will know Myrcella and Tommen are not Baratheons.

I'd say we need to hear about the Brotherhood hanging Freys sometimes this season. Brienne or Arya can even possibly hear that the Brotherhood got themselves a new leader, and who knows maybe a Lady Stoneheart namedrop.
Then last scene of the season: Frey about to be hanged, sees LS but we only sees her back, his eyes widen in horror/surprise and Thoros or Anguy casually explain, oh yeah, we found her in the river, Beric gave her the kiss of life, she can't speak, but she remembers, Frey hanged, LS drops the hood, big shock.
I can totally see that.
And I think it would be a mistake to have Brienne meet LS this season. Save that for the beginning of next season instead. I do believe we need to have faith in LS's vengeance and really root for her and expect great things before we realize she's wayyyy too vengeful and getting in the way of our other beloved characters.



This is really the only scenario I could imagine. That epilogue was the strongest chapter in my opinion and it'd be a shame to deviate too far from it.
The Red Wedding is still fresh in viewers' minds, as it was while reading A Storm of Swords and, if we want that GoT shock for the audience, I believe that's where we're gonna' get it.
All these suggestions of Brienne's hanging this season bewilders me.Â That would suggest we're skipping A Feast of Crows content in the series.
I understand abbreviating her story by introducing Pod to her from the start, but she has a journey to undertake before they're hanged.

What is indicating to me they'll have Brienne meet her is the amount of times she mentioned Catelyn and we were reminded of her oath to her. Also D&D were never fond of Cat so it makes sense to me they take away 'Holy shit she's back!' moment and turn it into 'oh no what will happen to poor Brienne?!' moment for the audience.

Â 
i was initially thinking along the same times, since last ep name is Children, clearly its going to be about Tyrion/Tywin, then most likely Dany locking up the dragons, or at least finding out drogon is killing children...and finally LSH and Brienne hanging with her screaming "arya!"...perfect cliffhanger, like the books
Â 
however, iv been going over the books again...Brienne has quite a bit of story line prior to meeting UnCat, but after, she only appears for one scene much further down the road while Jaime is bringing peace to the riverlands, where she whisks him away ...so showing her with UnCat now, would force D&D to cut out lot of her story, and then have very little to almost nothing next season...while i wud definitely love to see that cliffhanger this season i think it might end up differently...
Â 
rest of this season is going to be about Brienne's journey...
bonding with Pod,
training him,
finding Gendry,
Ser Hugh,
Randall Tarly,
more depth of her character and the reveal about the bet and all (or did that sort of happen when she was transporting Jaime?)Â 
finally end with her fight with Biter where she bites off his ear and spits it back on his face. during that fight she gets pretty injured, almost like Tyrion at Blackwater, we'll be left wondering whether she will survive or not...
Â 
since M.Fairely confirmed to have shot a scene, it might actually be Bw/oB finding her body and berric giving her his gift, final moment could be - Â her eyes snap open which looks almost gray/blue like the wights and everyone is left "Holy shit! berric turned her into a wight south of the wall!" and go in to a frenzy over the possible implications of that...
Â 
or she gets up and has a Dany moment "WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN!!"Â
3401	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-02	What's up with everyone bein all "Where's Lady Stoneheart? Is she even gonna be in the series?"
Â 
Its not time yet! She makes one appearance in the books, and they are obviously not there yet. What makes you think she would appear before she is written?
Â 
They will, though, probably show Beric offering his life to deadCat. Since Beric is cast in this season, I am assuming they will spoil the surprise with Beric doing that. I don't know though. I haven't seen the episode yet.
3402	Hippocras	2014-05-02	Don't forget Brienne and Pod's battle at Crackclaw Point.
We get to see more of Pod's awesomeness there. It can't be cut.
3403	sati	2014-05-02	Where is all the info of Beric being in this season coming from? Wasn't it already rejected as rumors?
Â 
I would have LOVED to see resurrection but I think if they wanted to do that, they'd do so last finale. The show doesn't got back in time and it's too late for that scene. The only scene they can show now is epilogue scene.

They do seem to have skipped Nymeria fishing her from the river. Which is sad.
But that should have happened three days after the red Wedding, and clearly we are long past that by now.

Â 
my friend, i swear you blow my mind! i will admit i have given very little thought to Bw/oB, UnCat and Berric and their stories in the big picture..but the idea of Oathkeeper being plunged in to Jaimes heart as a step further to creating Lightbringer is amazing! so by that thought, oathkeeper should somehow be destroyed or lost symbolically atleast and Widows's Wail might be the last step at becoming Lightbringer...there might be some who will say this theory is ludicrous, and it might very well not happen...buts its damn interesting to think about!Â

Â 
they have not shown Nymeria's exsistence since s01...98% of my unsullied friends think only Ghost and Summer are alive, and possibly Shaggydog....but they think "all the rest of the wolves are dead anyway"...because of the fact they havent shown Jon's or Arya's warging/dreams at all, most are under the impression that Bran is the only one with "super powers" which is what makes them sure that he will warg in to one of the dragons and control one of them...barely any of them have given any thought to how come only Bran has warging abilities...
Â 
of all the things cut from the show, Dany's prophecies at the House of the Undying and Jon and Arya's warging i feel are the most critical...im hopeful that D&D have discussed this with GRRM and come up with a plan on how to introduce this later in to the show...if not, im not sure how that would fit in with Arya's future story line at all...but i digress, probably for a different thread

Thank-you. I am glad you like it. We'll see if it's true in the end as with all theories.
3407	Blazfemur	2014-05-02	Oathkeeper has it's own story though. I'd actually hate to see Oathkeeper become Lightbringer, believe it or not. Oathkeeper has it's own history, transformation, and future. I wouldn't soil it with religious fanaticism.
Â 
Let Oathkeeper be Oathkeeper.
Â 
Lion's Tooth, should become Lightbringer, when it's found by Elder Brother after washing down the river, and given to Sandor, as the gravedigger.

Â 
As Ned Stark's blade, it's the deciding factor for Brienne and Pod to survive, not even Pod so much but Brienne. That's if Brienne lets The Lady know what Oathkeeper really is (i HAVE to believe it appears as a normal valyrian steel blade, and that The Lady wouldn't recognize it's new form unless Brienne told her, which she probably did).
Â 
Knowing The Lady, if i were her I'd want to place that blade with Eddard's remains. While she's so vengeful, part of me believes either she, or one of her men would travel to winterfell's crypts and leave the blade with Eddard's statue, but only, once Sansa has been saved.
Â 
Brienne has a lot of talking to do, and not a lot fo time to do it, it seems.
Â 
If you're insinuating Oathkeeper become Lightbringer to save Sansa, and then my theory of honoring Eddard's grave to come afterward with said blade, then by all means it suits both of our purposes. But Oathkeeper means so much more, than becoming just Azor Ahai reborn's sword. Lightbringer has it's own history, id hate to see Oathkeeper's get forgotten.
Â 
Think of the logistics -- Oathkeeper is made from Ice. Now while I acknowledge it becoming Lightbringer would make a flaming sword with Ice, and would typically make it the balance of Ice & fire, should it? When tales are told of the fabled Lightbringer, you don't think of Eddard's tragedy, the melting of his sword, and given a noble purpose, do you?
3410	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	^^ im beginning to agree with you on all counts except one....oathkeeper cannot go to the crypts, if that was the case, it would have been with Rickard Stark or some other Stark ancestor...they only put bronze/steel swords down in the crypts with the dead starks...
Â 
following your logic, Oathkeeper should go to Rickon (as long as he survives) and given the kids history, he'll probably rename it to something silly...
Â 
do we know what happened to Widow's Wail? I doubt Tywin would allow a precious Lannister Valyrian steel sword to be buried...does it go to Tommen? Do you think Jaime's going to take it as the last Lannister male?Â

Â 
Youre actually right, be it iron, but your right. His ancestral blade would be passed, I'd think, not buried with him. He should be buried with iron.
Â 
I guess we're going to have to live with the lifelong tragic history behind the great valyrian ancestral Stark blade, StabbyStabStick
3412	salmonsnake	2014-05-02	Isn't Valyrian steel so damn precious, though, that it'd almost certainly inspire grave-robbing if it was known to be buried somewhere unguarded

this is likely the reason Tywin decided to melt it down and reforge it so it doesn't keep reminding everyone of ned stark...
Â 
also hopefully the reason why GRRM chose to name it Oathkeeper, something positive...i see the potential for it saving some Stark's life, thereby redeeming some of its honor/glory and continuing to be passed down the Starks

Also, the blade has a name already. Rickon may not rename the blade, if it has a name, already. If he received it from Tywin, we'd be looking at StabbyStabStick or SharpyOwchSword.
Â 
It's a hopeful name, it's a promise Brienne made to Jaime, with Catelyn in mind. The irony is that shes being held captive for the Oath she's attempting to keep. The oath says nothing about keeping Jaime alive.. Just rescuing Sansa. Not even Arya at this point, the oath was made to rescue Sansa with Arya presumed dead.

i always thought the oath brienne referred to while naming it was the one they swore Cat when she Jaime go...i think she mentioned Sansa is a must and Arya if possible...at that time I believe there was no news of Arya at all and Cat still hoped she was in KL just locked away by Cersei..
Â 
now to throw a wrench in to the works...is it mentioned anywhere that Lightbringer must be valyrian steel? or is that the assumption made since only dragonsteel affects them? If it doesn't have to be valyrian steel, then possibilities are limitlessÂ

true, it's not specified in the wiki. it theoretically could be anything, id assume itd be valyrian steel, but your right, it's not specified otherwise.
3417	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	With the next few Brienne scenes will have a better idea of whether LSH will actually make an appearance with Brienne this season...though more and more I think about it while they might reveal her this season, her scene with Brienne comes at the very end of book 4...makes sense they will focus the rest of the season on meereen, KL, Eyrie and ofcourse the Wall...
It will be very interesting to see how they advance the Dorne story line without leaving the other characters behind

Im curious too, the hound is still alive and well, are they going to just skip quiet isle altogether? they could.. but that would totally negate the gravedigger controversy

3420	snowy	2014-05-02	Brienne will meet LS, but she will not be hanged. It will just be a mix of the Frey hanging scene and Brienne meeting her. Freys will probably already be hanged as Brienne approaches LS. Thoros introduces her (cut her throat but she remembers) then LS turns around, pulls down her hood, whammo. Look of shock on Brienne's face, look of stone cold fury on unCat's. Cut to black. Credits.

I feel like we are gonna get more than we expected this season, they practically promoed the crap out of Joffrey dying with those roast videos and tags. They've got something up their sleeves. [spoiler?] The Nights King thing caught me by surprise.
Lol thanks. Game of Desks is too hilarious. Medieval funtime land is way more funny though.

Medieval Funtime Land straight up makes me lose my shit, I get abs in under a minute from that gem. And the Nights King threw me for the biggest loop, its been days and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. I'm excited and reallyyyy hesitant for getting more than we expected this season though. It was exciting with the White Walker/Nights King ending we got, knowing that indeed book readers would be getting tidbits that turn us into Unsullied. Its exhilirating, for once, to not know what is coming around the corner

I can't take Jamie serious anymore because it really sounds like he's whispering! 
The whole reason I began the book was to not be surprised anymore and know the ending. And look at where that's got me now... I didn't want anymore surprises after Jamie's hand and someone had already spoiled the RW for me.
I was expecting LSH to be in 401, and I kind of wished she were because I don't want her to overshadow or get overshadowed by the rest of season events.

Â 
I can't look at Viserys without remembering that he kissed Johnny SchatzmanÂ  
Â 
All the surprises leave me hesitant, because I don't know what the show is including thats book canon and what is simply a consequence of the 'butterfly effect' from show!canon. It's going to be confusing down the road trying to figure that out until George blesses us with the gift of the WoW. And I was expecting to see LS in the season 3 finale, given that it was called Mhysa and could have fit well with the timing for Nymeria to drag her from the river. But D&D wanted a lasting suprise factor/impact which I understand. But I agree, I really don't her to get overshadowed, but at this point I don't think theres any avoiding it. The pacing and progression of Briennes plot says to me that its more likely she won't cross the BwB until near the finale, saving her "hanging" by UnCat till Season 5. But there will already be so much jam-packed into the finale that I don't know whether to hyperventilate with joy at the prospect or cry because the individual storylines won't each get the attention they deserve
3427	Hippocras	2014-05-03	Oathkeeper has it's own story though. I'd actually hate to see Oathkeeper become Lightbringer, believe it or not. Oathkeeper has it's own history, transformation, and future. I wouldn't soil it with religious fanaticism.
Â 
Let Oathkeeper be Oathkeeper.
Â 
Lion's Tooth, should become Lightbringer, when it's found by Elder Brother after washing down the river, and given to Sandor, as the gravedigger.I actually agree. I avoided posting my entire theory on this thread because it is off topic, but in my preferred version Oathkeeper stays as it is, and stays on its current mission to find and serve Sansa.
What I want to see happen is Jamie sent to get Widow's Wail and find Arya. But before he can get Widow's Wail, a lot of shit will go down in KL. Widow's Wail will be used to murder Tommen or Myrcella. Then it will be merged with Blackfyre to hide that Aegon is fake and make a new sword for him when he becomes King. 
When Aegon is defeated, that combined sword will make its way to Jon, being the merged Targ-Stark sword.
But, Thoros's group and the resurrection of Cat still serves the purpose of the sword forging, because she is the one obsessed with the vow to return her daughters and the sword Ice. So she will pass on that mission to Jamie.

But thats assuming Blackfyre is found by the WoW. It is assumed that the Golden Company has it (therefore giving "Aegon" opportunity to get his hands on it), but it is not specifically stated yet that Blackfyre remained with them after Bittersteels death. It's hard to imagine it would be lost, after all Valyrian steel is so precious and rare that you think one would keep an eye on it, but personally I'm still waiting for it to surface with proof

A lot of people think Blackfyre was what Illyrio wanted to give to Aegon when Tyrion left him. Remember he had some sort of package but Haldon insisted they didn't have time for Illyrio to give it to Aegon? That package was probably a sword.

I think that we'll see the other Stark siblings warg, but only once it becomes truly relevant, i. e. for Arya, while she is in Bravos, for Jon shortly before the mutiny. It's an important plot point for both of them and D&D may drop character points but not important plot points. Just look at how many people thought that they'd cut Ramsay, yet we were introduced to him. As soon as he became truly important for the plot.

3449	Mladen	2014-04-27	As usual, welcome to the Discussing Sansa thread. With the usual notification of spoiler alert, plea for kindness and manners, I present you the discussion of Sansa scenes in Episode 4.04 called "Oathbreaker"
Â 
First, I will start with the obvious nod to the readers."Sansa is not an assassin... Not yet, anyway" is something that can be interpreted in many ways. With powerful pieces of foreshadowing pointing that Sansa might end LF's reign by killing him. Whether this was intentional, it is debatable, but it certainly tantalized many of us...
Â 
Second, the scene on the boat truly showed us the progress in Sansa's mindset. The scene contained many elements of the book in it, from the mistrust to LF and looming understanding what he wants to slowly comprehending how Game is played. This was tutorial 1.01 in playing Game, and Sansa passed with well, if not flying colors, then certainly very well. Sansa in the series has truly became interesting sort of creature. I have to say that the redemption for ghastly boring 3rd season is finally coming...
Â 
All and all, interesting episode, both in narrative sense and introductory to the new relationship between Sansa and LF. I am truly excited to see Sansa in the upcoming episodes...

					
					
							Edited by Mladen, 30 April 2014 - 06:37 PM.
3450	Mladen	2014-04-29	Here is Inside the episode video where producers analyzed couple of scenes, including the one with LF/Sansa
Â 
I like where they think this is going. LF telling the truths to Sansa out of belief she is powerless (well, she is at the moment) is something that was done subtly in the text. But the key word here is "at the moment" since Sansa is slowly gaining the knowledge not only how Game is played, but the insight into someone's mind who truly did some rather horrendous things. It is rather interesting dynamics, not just because of what Sansa might become under LF's tutelage, but also because of resolving the Gordian knot of what has happened in the dawn of Wo5K.Â

Â

Â 
Can't emphasize this enough. I loved how Sansa immediately jumped on Littlefinger's explanation of his motives and was like "there's no way you'd risk all of this to confuse your enemies" (paraphrasing, obviously). Sansa is sharp, and there's much she's going to be keeping from LF; his underestimation will be his downfall.
Â 
Definitely saw that "not yet anyway" as foreshadowing to Sansa the Giantslayer.
3452	Sand11751	2014-04-29	I was wondering when this thread would pop up.
Â 
The "not yet" definitely had me perked up as well, because I'm a strong believer that for Sansa to survive all this, she's going to have use some of the weapons people have employed against her and family. I actually have liked the way theÂ books played out by having her with Littlefucker; he has a lot more to teach her than those slimy kisses. There's something very gratifying about learning the "tricks of the trade" and turning them against those who've hurt you most. I also enjoyed LF's boastfulness on the show, because it suggests that he is susceptible to letting his own tongue get the best of him, while she stands there taking it all in and making sense of it in her head. He liked that little game with her, revealing a bit about the necklace's role in Joff's death coupled with that clever little hint about his new allies and how their relations "grow strong" but in the end, I think he's going to find himself at the mercy of a young woman who has learned a lot from him.
Â 
I've enjoyed Sansa's character overall, and ignore most complaints about her lacking agency; GRRM painted the character that way to contrast with her sister. I think these two will survive to series' end; one learning by cunning and martial weapons, the other setting her own path by analysis. Sansa's artlessness has been the armor she needed to shield her from some of the horrid things she had to survive in KL. It might seem she's in greater danger by being with LF, but I think being in the Eyrie with LF is going to teach that little bird how to fly. And not out theÂ moon door either. Â  Â  Â  Â
3453	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-29	In another thread, I referenced that this episode showed Sansa literally going from pawn to player. My Unsullied mother caught that line and fully believes Sansa will be the one to take LF down, and I agree.
Â 
Sansa is often compared to Catelyn, by other characters, and most of all by LF, and it's certain that his obsession with her stems from his obsession with Cat. Petyr relied on the Tully family throughout his youth, and trusted Catelyn. When his life was in danger (from a Stark, no less) Catelyn was the one who called to the foe to spare his life. Interestingly, although Sansa is Catelyn's doppleganger in appearance, I think she is the child most like her father. LF trusts Sansa because she seems meek, and because of the fact that since he equates Sansa with Cat in his mind, he believes he can trust her to be "on his side." Ultimately this will result in his biggest failure.. Sansa will take his life instead of sparing it.
Â 
I like that in a way, Sansa is doing what her parents failed to do (Catelyn spared LF, Ned trusted him). For me, I see her being the child who rights the wrongs of these ill decisions. Sansa does have the agency to avenge LF for the wrongs he has done the Starks and the Tullys. She just knows patience is a friend.
3454	Newstar	2014-04-29	"Not yet, anyway" was one of the most blatant bits of show-only foreshadowing that the show has provided to date. The fact that the line transitioned to a scene with Sansa and LF could mean either 1) Sansa kills LF or 2) Sansa, corrupted by LF's influence, kills someone.
Interesting that TV Sansa immediately denies that Tyrion murdered Joffrey and says "I just do" when asked how she knows that, even though she readily comes up with logical explanations for her other conclusions. Book Sansa certainly believed Tyrion could have done it (and vice versa, although Book Tyrion never thought Sansa could have pulled it off by herself, as I recall, whereas TV Tyrion just states that Sansa's not a killer...yet). Curious change from the books.

Eh, Book!Sansa thought he was innocent too, though the speed at which she defends him in the show is definitely a change:
Â 
Â 
Sometimes she dreamed of Tyrion as well. â<U+0080><U+009C>He did nothing,â<U+0080><U+009D> she told Littlefinger once, when he paid a visit to her cabin to see if she were feeling any better.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>He did not kill Joffrey, true, but the dwarfâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hands are far from clean. He had a wife before you, did you know that?â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
Yes, I think that people usually underestimate Sansa's intelligence. In this episode, she saw right through his facade and called that a BS.
Â 
As for foreshadowing in terms of "not yet", it was rather interesting line... Â Well, I do believe she will end LF's reign, not sure about killing, but alas, this was interesting push in that direction. Also, a piece of TV foreshadowing that I always find great when it comes to Sansa is Tyrion's: "Lady Stark, you may survive us yet" from the second season.

3458	Newstar	2014-04-29	True, Chebyshov, but "He did nothing" came only well after LF explained that Tyrion in fact did nothing. It was hardly something that she "just knew."
I wouldn't think that much of it were it not for this quote from a Spanish language magazine interview with Sophie Turner (the April issue, I think), where Sophie Turner says the following when asked about the influence of Tyrion and Sansa's relationship on Sansa (translated from Spanish):
"[Cutting out some stuff about Joffrey] Tyrion is her only and true friend, he's the only one who's been honest with her. Well, she has Shae but Shae's not completely sincere with Sansa. She could trust Tyrion completely, if she wished to. It's one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones, especially for my character."
I didn't think that much of it at the time (blah blah blah whitewashing), but after 4x04 and Alex Graves' recent revelation that he is spoiled for post-ADWD books and spoils the actors so that they know how to act in certain scenes, I'm starting to wonder about the possibilities for Sansa and Tyrion becoming (platonic, to be clear) allies in the future, post-ADWD. The HBO viewers' guide talking all about Tyrion treating Sansa with the utmost respect could be whitewashing, or it could be setting something up down the line for a reasonably amicable alliance.

3459	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	Good that they are making her pick up on things faster now, but it is also very good that she was the way she was in the earlier seasons. When you show one, the viewers can imagine that there are a dozen Sansa-types fluttering around every court, always seeming either naAve or utterly terrified or both. When pretty much the entire palette of forces and everyone's concurrent machinations are shown to the viewers, they might get frustrated by her subdued survival, but that frustration is not a smart way to see her angle.
3460	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-29	There are a few ways to interpret "Killer" other than literally, and I think this is an especially cool line when you compare Sansa with Arya. You get the feeling that if he were speaking of Arya instead, that line would seem to make more sense literally. But when spoken about Sansa...There are more ways to become a "Killer" than learning how to fight with a sword, so I'm actually sort of excited for Sansa's future now.Â

Really, really interesting perspective from her. I'm hoping you're right about foreshadowing an alliance between them later (probably with an annulment thrown in), because it is a notable change from the books.

That sounds about right to me. I'm really interested in everything we're seeing in Season 4 from a foreshadowing/clues perspective, since Season 4 was the first season written after the writers had been spoiled in detail as to future plots (as opposed to just knowing the ending in broad strokes). The little details will matter a lot more, which is why Tyrion's "Not yet, anyway" and Sansa's "I just do" caught my attention.
The other thing about that quote is that Sophie Turner describes the Sansa/Tyrion relationship as one of the most important in GOT. That's a pretty tall order, considering how many relationships there are in GOT, and it also seems at odds with what we've seen of the books to date, where Sansa and Tyrion's relationship is not particularly important to them, let alone the narrative. Very curious where that's going.

Book Sansa certainly believed Tyrion could have done it (and vice versa, although Book Tyrion never thought Sansa could have pulled it off by herself, as I recall, whereas TV Tyrion just states that Sansa's not a killer...yet). Curious change from the books.


I don't think that's indicative of anything on its own.Â  It's part of of the show's adaptational trends, namely, the minimization of conflicts between "hero" characters whenever possible.Â  Hence, pretty much everything about how Sansa/Tyrion was handled, the fact that Dany never talks about wanting revenge on the Starks et al., Catelyn apologizing for not loving Jon Snow, Margaery being Sansa's genuine pal instead of the Tyrells dropping her like a hot potato, etc.
Â 


The other thing about that quote is that Sophie Turner describes the Sansa/Tyrion relationship as one of the most important in GOT. That's a pretty tall order, considering how many relationships there are in GOT, and it also seems at odds with what we've seen of the books to date, where Sansa and Tyrion's relationship is not particularly important to them, let alone the narrative. Very curious where that's going.


She also gave several interviews where she said the exact opposite of that.

3464	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-29	True, Chebyshov, but "He did nothing" came only well after LF explained that Tyrion in fact did nothing. It was hardly something that she "just knew."
I wouldn't think that much of it were it not for this quote from a Spanish language magazine interview with Sophie Turner (the April issue, I think), where Sophie Turner says the following when asked about the influence of Tyrion and Sansa's relationship on Sansa (translated from Spanish):
"[Cutting out some stuff about Joffrey] Tyrion is her only and true friend, he's the only one who's been honest with her. Well, she has Shae but Shae's not completely sincere with Sansa. She could trust Tyrion completely, if she wished to. It's one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones, especially for my character."
I didn't think that much of it at the time (blah blah blah whitewashing), but after 4x04 and Alex Graves' recent revelation that he is spoiled for post-ADWD books and spoils the actors so that they know how to act in certain scenes, I'm starting to wonder about the possibilities for Sansa and Tyrion becoming (platonic, to be clear) allies in the future, post-ADWD. The HBO viewers' guide talking all about Tyrion treating Sansa with the utmost respect could be whitewashing, or it could be setting something up down the line for a reasonably amicable alliance.


Â 
Even more interesting is the fact that she's still wearing her wedding ring (you can see it in the preview for "First of his Name"). Was initially thinking it was an oversight, but then I thought, how do you forget you have a wedding ring on? Quite frankly, I'm surprised she still has it on, especially at the Eyrie. She's supposed to be 'incognito'. Take the massive Lannister-colored wedding ring off woman! You're in 'hiding'.

Very curious where that's going.Â Exactly. In the books Tyrion represents everything that Sansa has come to hate (the Lannisters), and doesn't place much significance on the marriage. In post, she dreams of him often, but replaces him with The Hound in almost every situation, so it's hard to argue that Tyrion himself had any lasting impact. She does think of him as "kind" at times, but given the men she's generally around, I think this may have been faint praise.Â Â â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes.â<U+0080><U+009D> Sansa knew the truth of her flowering could not be long hidden in the Eyrie.Â â<U+0080><U+009C>Tyrion didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t . . . he never . . . â<U+0080><U+009D> She could feel the blush creeping up her cheeks. â<U+0080><U+009C>I amstill a maid.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â â<U+0080><U+009C>Was the dwarf incapable?â<U+0080><U+009D>Â â<U+0080><U+009C>No. He was only . . . he was . . . â<U+0080><U+009D> Kind?

I'm Â very curious to see if and how she talks about Tyrion to Lysa. We might get something a bit deeper than her "I never wanted to marry him" that we get in the books.

Seems odd that Sansa wouldn't have ditched the ring at the first available opportunity. I sort of envisioned a scene where Sansa chucked the ring into the sea with relish. If Alayne Stone is going to be a thing, I assume the ring will be dealt with in 4x05. The shot from the 4x05 preview with Lysa holding Sansa's hands seemed to feature the ring fairly prominently.
I hope we get some explanation as to why Sansa is wearing her Blackwater dress and not her PW dress in 4x05, since she escaped from KL with only the clothes on her back.

I think exactly like you do. I would have thought she'd of thrown it overboard by now. That she still has it on kind of makes me feel like they'll use it at a visual representation of her changing identities (i.e. going from Lady Lannister to Alayne Stone) once she takes it off. I don't know. I just think its interesting--in a general sense--that she's still wearing it. Kind of indicative that their relationship in the show is indeed, very different from the books. I kind of feel like Book Sansa would have throw that overboard the first chance she got. Show Sansa....eh...she'll wear it a little while longer.

...Still kind of disappointed she didn't throw it into the sea. That would have been suitably dramatic, if a little cornball. I had that scene pictured so clearly in my mind that I was really surprised when I saw the preview and she was still wearing it.
Speaking of physical transformations, I'm kind of peeved that Sansa in the Eyrie snow scene from the Season 4 trailers, by which point she's presumably masquerading as Alayne, is wearing her Blackwater dress. Come on.
On another note, it seems to be assumed that "Only Cat" will be in 4x10 along with all the other big climactic scenes. The promo for 4x05 seems to be zipping right through Sansa's storyline, though. Could "Only Cat" be as early as Mockingbird, the 4x07 episode?

3470	Woman of War	2014-04-29	It is interesting to note that Sansa is not afraid at all of Baelish since she rather bluntly threw accusations marked as questions into his face. There is no facial, body language or verbal restrainment towards him, compared to being at court before.
Only Tyrion got HBO Sansa's, contrary to book Sansa, honest emotions of sadness and fury. So much more dignified than the mousy silence in the books. But then Sophie Turner's Sansa is much more mature than book Sansa. And, see quotes above, Tyrion is the one she trusts so far not to betray her.
Does she trust Baelish not to harm her? Does Baelish please his own sense of grandeur by sharing his awesomeness with Sansa, seeing her as powerless? And yet she feels safe enough to be sharp towards him.
Maybe showmakers don't want to make it easy for Baelish to draw her on his side, don't want to present her as naive any longer when she asked the right questions, a true task for Baelish, not an easy prey. They may keep it open for a while if Sansa will side with LF. Nothing is spoiled so far since it is very much open in the books as well.
But this Sansa won't stumble naively into Baelish's traps, she may make conscious decisions to side with him or not. So she may follow Baelish's plans in whatever way  and become a killer. Or HBO Sansa may truly become an active Sherlock, find out some things and be the end of Baelish, revenge served cold.
3471	Woman of War	2014-04-29	I predict that at some point Sansa will take out the hidden ring again to demonstrate her refusal to go along with Baelish's marriage plot for her since she is married.
3472	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	I think that the wedding will be in 407, Newstar and that "Only Cat" will still be in the finale as many suspected. I hope I'm right, but we'll see. I think they should build up Lysa some more and make her seem like more of a big deal before they give her flying lessons.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 29 April 2014 - 01:56 PM.
3473	Newstar	2014-04-29	Woman of War, I noticed Sansa being blunt and pointed with LF as well, although she was still somewhat guarded: she didn't shrug off LF when he ran his hand down her arm, although she was clearly uncomfortable.
LF is also much more openly creepy and handsy with Sansa than he was at this point in the books. I didn't think they would do the LF/Sansa kiss, but after the most recent episodes I think a kiss would hardly be shocking.
One thing I'd forgotten is that Sophie Turner usually misses two or three episodes a season. 4x09 is out, but it's probably a safe bet that she's appearing in 4x10 and 4x07. If she sits out 4x06, then 4x07 seems a very unlikely candidate for "Only Cat," I agree.
The only thing about putting "Only Cat" in the finale is that I think that the snow scene has to be in the same episode as the confrontation with Lysa, and that seems like a lot for an episode that's going to be crammed to the gills with other things. On the other hand, if not 4x10, where would it go?

I really doubt that.Â  The main reason some people seem to be suggesting that is because there won't be enough room in episode 10 or whatever, but if you assume "Only Cat" is in episode 7, then that means episode 10 is going to cover the aftermath of that and introduce the Lords Declarant story, and I can't see how that could possibly take much less time.Â  It would also blow through at least a full third of Sansa's AFFC material in a single episode (the substance of her first chapter and the first meeting with the lords in the second, albeit presumably without the climax).

Â 
Good point about the other married female characters not wearing wedding rings. Hadn't thought about it before, but now that you mention it, I've got a lot of hand-watching to do. 
Â 
So. Damn. True. about her wearing the Blackwater dress. Besides being repetitive, there's also the logistical consideration of how she smuggled the dress out of there to being with considering her escape wasn't planned nor did Dontos make a little carry-on bag for her.
Â 
I've always predicated "Only Cat" would be episode 7, and as of right now, I see no reason to change that theory.  Although....that promo topic in the "First of His Name" thread gave me a new idea about what they're going to do with Sansa in episode 10 (if, indeed, "Only Cat" is episode 7). But let me flesh it out in my head before I go suggesting wild and crazy theories out loud.
3476	Chebyshov	2014-04-29	I really doubt that.Â  The main reason some people seem to be suggesting that is because there won't be enough room in episode 10 or whatever, but if you assume "Only Cat" is in episode 7, then that means episode 10 is going to cover the aftermath of that and introduce the Lords Declarant story, and I can't see how that could possibly take much less time.Â  It would also blow through at least a full third of Sansa's AFFC material in a single episode (the substance of her first chapter and the first meeting with the lords in the second, albeit presumably without the climax).


Â 
Agreed. Sansa has what? 3 chapters in AFFC? Ayra's in a similar predicament, which is why they're dragging out her story. "Only Cat" needs to be her episode 10 conclusion. As it is, we're likely to see TWOW material for Sansa's arc next year.
3477	El Guapo	2014-04-29	There is no way that "Only Cat " is not the last scene from the Eyrie this season and therefore should be in episode 10.Â  There really is no point whatsover to have any other scene from the Eyrie after that as it is the prefect way to end her story arc.
Â 
As far as the snow castle scene, which I have my doubts we will actually have an actual castle, that possibly could be in episode 8.

Separating those two scenes into different episodes would be a terrible, terrible pacing decision.Â  I can't say they wouldn't consider it, given how (for instance) they left Dany's "Mhysa" scene in the season 3 finale dangling without any context, but I desperately hope they don't.

My thoughts. But because of the battle in 4x09, it means the snow castle scene may be likely separated by 2 episodes, so that's another thing to keep in mind.
3481	JonBranRickon	2014-04-29	Getting back to the player or pawn theme.Â 
Â 
Sansa has been and always will be a player.Â Â  I think you when you look back, Sansa always has a champion, someone to fight for her and protect her.Â  Only Joffey tried to harm her and that was after he initially tried to impress her.Â 
Â 
The Hound protected her the best way he could, Tyrion protected her the best way he could and now Petyr.Â  She has faced down the most sadistic (joffrey), most feared (the hound), most cunning (Petyr) as well as the richest in Tyrion and not one of them has gotten what the wanted.Â  I think in the end we will find out that Sansa's gift as a warg is to manipulate people, especially men.Â 
Â 
you remember the scene at the Batlle of Blackwater when the Hound came to her room.Â  She said you won't hurt me and he repeated it back to her like some people do whenthey are in a trance.

My thoughts. But because of the battle in 4x09, it means the snow castle scene may be likely separated by 2 episodes, so that's another thing to keep in mind.


Noooo. That would completely destroy all momentum leading up to the Moon Door moment. I think that will all be in episode 7, and then, in episode 10, you'll have Yohn Royce and the Lords Declarant (who have already been cast for this season) investigating Lysa's murder. Sansa will testify that Marillion pushed her (which I imagine is where we'll also get the line in the preview where Petyr says, "I want to know who's side you're on?"), which means all of S5 will be the Harry storyline and TWOW.

3483	Mladen	2014-04-29	As we have heard from production diaries, Eyrie has been dismantled after the shooting for this season., so that means that Sansa's storyline in Season 4 is most likely concluding with the "Only Cat" or even with them abandoning Eyrie after Lysa's death. That of course leaves so little of material for season 5, and just like in Arya's case, we will face a serious issue of lacking the material.
Â 
OK... As for how we might see it:
Â 
4.05 --- Introduction to Lysa
4.07 --- "Mockingbird" probably Lysa/Petyr wedding and possible attempt of rape on Sansa... There was an article about her shooting rape scene this year
4.08/09/10 --- this is where it gets confusing... One episode could be "Only Cat", and then in the finale, we see the trial and abandoning Eyrie, or we might see the "Only Cat" moment in finale. I imagine snow castle scene would be in the same episode as "Only Cat"
3484	Newstar	2014-04-29	Is the Eyrie set everything, or just the hall with the Moon Door where Tyrion's trial was held? Because the latter isn't needed in the books after "Only Cat"--although my memory's a bit foggy on that--but if the former means all Eyrie sets, then that might have implications for AFFC material (the descent from the Eyrie being a big part of same). I think it must just mean the big hall set; I have trouble believing they'd just gloss over the descent.
Mladen, I think that quote about shooting a rape scene arose from an interview where she was discussing the Season 2 riot scene. It's confusing, because the quote appeared recently on the web, but it was from a Tatler interview where in context it refers to the riot scene.
Now that you mention it, though, I wonder how the show will deal with Marillion. They could just cast another character who could do everything Marillion did but who would have another name, I guess. They need someone, maybe not to attempt to rape Sansa, but to play the part of Lysa's accomplice and LF's patsy.
I agree with everyone who said that splitting the snow scene and the Moon Door sequence would be a terrible decision. 
					
					
							Edited by Newstar, 29 April 2014 - 03:49 PM.
3485	Ashkhen	2014-04-29	The descent down from the Eyrie could be extremely difficult to film, especially if they have animals, so I'm thinking they'll skip it or adapt it in some way. The way Sansa manipulates Robert into leaving is really key, so I hope they keep that in. 
Do y'all really think they'll keep the snow castle scene (or something like it)? I'm afraid they'll just skip the longing/strength from Winterfell part and just have the kiss.
Also, back to the episode at hand... 
The "what is it that you do want?" / "I want everything." exchange stuck in my mind. LF puts his hand on Sansa's shoulder/arm right before or after that, and it was so unsettling. It would have been better if Catlyn and Sansa actors looked alike, but I thought the point got across. 
"Everything" felt like a throwaway sneaky answer. D&D have to keep us in the dark about LF's true intentions, and LF wants to keep Sansa somewhat in the dark.

3486	Chebyshov	2014-04-29	Yeah I thought they might have held off on killing Dontos for him to be the patsy, but really anyone can fill that role. The show just seems to be fond of stretching characters. 
Was Sweetrobin recast?
3487	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	They should absolutely keep the snow castle scene. It has the potential to transform everyone's idea of Sansa, (along with her own) if done right.

No, the same actor is returning, although will obviously look much older since he's that age.

I think they'll keep it, but I'm guessing episode 8 for that and Only Cat in 10. In season promos I think we see her in the snow. 
Glad to hear about Sweetrobin being the same actor. I like consistency where feasible.

Â 
Something none of you may have considered yet - perhaps they will do away with the "Alayne" story altogether? This would explain why she's wearing noble clothes and continues to wear her wedding ring. I suspect this because there's a shot in the preview showing her being held / hugged by Lysa and also because Littlefinger should have told her she was going incognito during the two ship scenes - they can't drag that scene out any longer so when is she going to be told she's going disguised and why?
Â 
Why this could work:
Â 
Speeds up the plot line at the Eyrie so they can get straight to the killing of Lysa faster
Reduces the number of scenes neededÂ 
Adds drama because once again Sansa thinks she's 'safe' or has a 'future' (like when she thought she was marrying Loras) only to have it ripped away again.
The story arc isn't that crucial for the overall story line between Sansa, Littlefinger and Lysa.
Â 
Just a theory as to why she's not disguised as "Alayne" in any of the snippets we've seen so far.
3491	Newstar	2014-04-29	Yeah, Sansa still in highborn-appropriate clothes and with red hair by the time the snow castle scene rolls around makes me wonder. On the other hand, it makes no sense not to come up with a fake identity for Sansa. How would that even work?

Â 
The Vale / Eyrie is certainly far enough removed from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms - would it really matter if anyone in the castle knows she's Sansa Stark? We already know it doesn't matter in regards to Lysa with her own fate coming soon. Maybe instead of the whole "Alayne" farce, Littlefinger will simply forbid anyone from leaving the castle (which during certain times of year isn't possible anyways) so her presence there is unknown. That way she can interact with Lysa as the only 'known' survivor of Winterfell at this point - it will pull on heartstrings a lot more.
Â 
Edit: Also - everyone knows Lysa fled King's Landing and has rejected the Baratheons / Lannisters as rulers after her husband's death so it's not that much of a stretch to think she'd also harbor her 'traitor' niece.Â

No, that wouldn't make any sense.Â  We know that outsiders are coming to the castle this season (the lords), and those characters will presumably be back later to interact further.Â  Sansa's location would get out, and the Lannisters would try to retrieve her; even if it didn't, the lords knowing who Sansa was would completely alter how they interact with her and, for that matter, with Littlefinger.
Â 


I suspect this because there's a shot in the preview showing her being held / hugged by Lysa


Why would that indicate anything?Â  Lysa is aware of who Sansa is, and they talk privately in the book.
Â 

Â 
and also because Littlefinger should have told her she was going incognito during the two ship scenes - they can't drag that scene out any longer so when is she going to be told she's going disguised and why?

They could introduce the identity just by having Littlefinger introduce her to Lysa in that guise when they get to the Eyrie, for instance; or just have another scene in the next episode where the idea is broached, perhaps on their way there, since we can see they have a scene outdoors.

The Vale / Eyrie is certainly far enough removed from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms - would it really matter if anyone in the castle knows she's Sansa Stark? We already know it doesn't matter in regards to Lysa with her own fate coming soon. Maybe instead of the whole "Alayne" farce, Littlefinger will simply forbid anyone from leaving the castle (which during certain times of year isn't possible anyways) so her presence there is unknown. That way she can interact with Lysa as the only 'known' survivor of Winterfell at this point - it will pull on heartstrings a lot more.
Â 
Edit: Also - everyone knows Lysa fled King's Landing and has rejected the Baratheons / Lannisters as rulers after her husband's death so it's not that much of a stretch to think she'd also harbor her 'traitor' niece.Â 


Â 
TBH, this doesn't make much sense to me. We are talking about Lysa who refused to help her family, frightened and manipulated Lysa. There is no way Sansa's identity would be open to everyone. It would be too risky and dangerous. And given that Sandor firstly named Lysa, Vale is the first location anyone would look for Sansa. So it would be nonsensical to flaunt Sansa around when she is looked for murder of the King.

Â 
I just don't think the show viewers are going to buy the disguise because by this point (rapid fast forward of time) word is getting out that Sansa fled King's Landing and what she looks like. She's very obviously Catelyn's daughter - hair, looks, everything. They make no attempts to change that in the show's previews for upcoming episodes.Â 
Â 
That's why I think they will drop the Alayne disguise in favor of another plot line.

Ok, I can agree with your logic there - it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense NOT to disguise her... but there's absolutely no indication they're going that route and plenty of footage shown where she still looks very much like Sansa stark... hair, clothing, even her wedding ring on.
Â 
Just a theory of mine at this point. They're going to want to condense as much of the Eyrie story as possible to save on time / scenes and speed it up.

No, I am not saying that you make no sense, but if the producers reject the entire facade of Alayne Stone, then we have a serious problem of what that means. I doubt if one castle knows who she is, that the people in Vale wouldn't know that too. Also, it makes on sense to drop her mask given that everyone were looking to Vale until Lysa was killed. Also, I do think you are right... Her clothing, hair, even the ring, it's all there. I expected to see Sophie not dying her hair anymore, but from all we know, that didn't happen... It's confusing...Â

Sansa is not in the Alayne guise when she meets Lysa, as she's still wearing her wedding ring. I don't think that means that she won't be incognito as Alayne at all, though, although it grinds my gears that in what looks like the snow scene she's wearing her Blackwater dress and not something bastard-appropriate.
Sansa's KL dresses were nothing to write home about and in Season 3 were all in drab and muddy colours, so I really hope that her bastard dresses are suitably shabby to demonstrate the contrast. If she spends Season 5 swanning around in dresses just as nice as her KL ones, I'm going to be pretty pressed.
The decision not to darken Sansa's hair mystifies me. Fair enough if Sophie Turner doesn't want to dye her hair, but can't they spring for a wig or colour her hair in post production or something?

I don't know if it would be a serious plot problem or not. They seem to be creating larger plot issues elsewhere so dropping the disguise might be mild by comparison to some changes (like Jon knowing about Bran) that to me at least seem much more significant.
Â 
Also, how many people do they really need to show at the Eyrie? Sure, there were plenty of people in the throne room during Tyrion's 'trial' - but do they all need to be there when Littlefinger arrives? If they are there (for the marriage) then perhaps they'll just keep Sansa closeted away somewhere as a 'secret' - and even though yes Lysa's paranoid and probably wouldn't hesitate to either kill or reject Sansa in normal circumstances - we have to remember she's getting the "love of her life" as a husband and likely conspires with him to keep Sansa's identity secret to please him. Not too far off from the books even if the disguise is dropped.

Well, when they weren't with "company" Alayne was typically wearing Lysa's old clothes, so she was still dressing reasonably well (though she also later thinks about being sick of dressingly drably when she leaves the Eyrie, which doesn't square with that).

No one says the Lannisters have to find out she's there. I know, unbelievable maybe but it's entirely possible they're going to rely on the Eyrie being 'remote' and the fact that they all believe Littlefinger to have been long gone weeks ago - remember? How could Sansa magically appear with him when he should have been in the Eyrie so long before the poisoning happened in the first place? He DOES say: "A man with no motives is not likely to be looked at as suspect" to reconfirm he's arranged the whole thing for a major CYA on his own behalf which is very Littlefinger-like in the scheme of things.Â 
Â 
Disguising Sansa was also a CYA move but less important now that they've revealed the whole plot of his conspiracy with the Tyrells already in the show. Viewers won't care if Sansa's disguised or not - they've already been given Littlefinger's whole Alibi!
3503	Newstar	2014-04-29	Sansa is careful when masquerading as Alayne not to dress above her station, though.
From what I remember of Season 1, the Eyrie ladies wore those weird dresses with the draping puffy "sleeves." I really hope Sansa doesn't wear a similar style, as those dresses struck me as really ugly.
In Envie's defence, we don't know how Alayne Stone will be dealt with in the show, and as even 4x04 proved with Bran, the writers are not afraid of huge deviations in the interest of spicing things up. I personally don't see how they could pull off Sansa in the Vale interacting with others without a fake identity, but I'm not writing the show, so who knows what they'll do?

See, I never understood the fuss around that, because that's not really that huge a deviation.Â  It's an obstacle on the way to the same destination.Â  Getting rid of the "Alayne" disguise would render basically Sansa's entire story unworkable.

Littlefinger's alibi would be meaningless if he actually had a girl named Sansa Stark hanging around with him.
Â 
Moreover, if the writers were sufficiently confident in the "remoteness" of the Vale, why would the Alayne disguise be implausible just because Sansa (supposedly, though not actually) looks like Catelyn?

Â 
Well I appreciate your support but my theory may end up just that, theory. I don't know anymore than anyone else what stories they choose to change and which ones they decide are important enough to keep in. The very first time I was completely floored by what I thought was a massive plot change (I think that was with "Talisa" (Robb, pregnancy, death etc) - I had to really accept the fact they were going to take some of the story and change it dramatically from the books. Some of the changes I've agreed with and others I'm still left wondering why or how believable it was for show viewers vs. book readers.
Â 
I guess we'll find out soon enough whether or not those fancy dresses mean she's not going to be in disguise or not!Â
3506	sastelise	2014-04-29	I agree that the treatment of Sansa's character is improved this season. Maybe they're going to unfold her slowly, as they said they would do with the hound. The scene with her LF was well-balanced, Sansabeing sufficiently suspicious and LF being sufficiently creepy.

Something I've always wondered though -Â whyÂ doesn't anyone even suspect that she may be at the Eyrie?That would seem like the most logical place for her to go, with or without LF's help.

Littlefinger was ordered, by Tywin, to dispatch immediately for the Vale and to wed Lysa Arryn and bring the Vale "into the fold" months before Joffrey's death and Sansa's disappearance. Littlefinger did a good job of creating a fairly infallible alibi and keeping Sansa right under their noses (the last place they'll look because it's so obvious) is very daring but very perfectly Littlefinger.

Brienne initially heads to the Eyrie because of that possibility, but after hearing that Lysa is dead she abandons the idea (somewhat illogically, since that doesn't account for the idea that Sansa might have already been there).
Â 
More generally, Littlefinger is at the Eyrie, and to the rest of the world Littlefinger is a loyal Lannister agent, so obviously Sansa wouldn't be there.

That wouldn't work either.Â  Changing her hair after she's already moved to the Eyrie would be far more suspicious than being a redhead.
3511	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-30	It is interesting to note that Sansa is not afraid at all of Baelish since she rather bluntly threw accusations marked as questions into his face. There is no facial, body language or verbal restrainment towards him, compared to being at court before.
Only Tyrion got HBO Sansa's, contrary to book Sansa, honest emotions of sadness and fury. So much more dignified than the mousy silence in the books. But then Sophie Turner's Sansa is much more mature than book Sansa. And, see quotes above, Tyrion is the one she trusts so far not to betray her.
Does she trust Baelish not to harm her? Does Baelish please his own sense of grandeur by sharing his awesomeness with Sansa, seeing her as powerless? And yet she feels safe enough to be sharp towards him.
Maybe showmakers don't want to make it easy for Baelish to draw her on his side, don't want to present her as naive any longer when she asked the right questions, a true task for Baelish, not an easy prey. They may keep it open for a while if Sansa will side with LF. Nothing is spoiled so far since it is very much open in the books as well.
But this Sansa won't stumble naively into Baelish's traps, she may make conscious decisions to side with him or not. So she may follow Baelish's plans in whatever way and become a killer. Or HBO Sansa may truly become an active Sherlock, find out some things and be the end of Baelish, revenge served cold.


Â 
I'm glad that you pointed out her immediate distrust and lack of fear/restraint towards Baelish. I noticed it right off the bat as well, especially with the tone of her opening comment to Baelish on the boat: "Where are you taking me?!?" Show Sansa indeed seems to be a lot quicker and more defiant than Book Sansa. I think the only time Book Sansa got 'snippy' with Baelish was when she was building the snow castle ("She wondered where this courage had come from, to speak to him so frankly. From Winterfell, she thought. I am stronger within the walls of Winterfell.") In the Show, she's snippy right off the bat. A VERY WELCOME change and one I personally appreciated, especially after having to endure a week of, "Sansa's so stupid, why does she trust Littlefinger?" comments from the Unsullied after she escaped KL.
Â 
In general, I find ALL of these little 'changes' intriguing. Everything from her immediate confrontational interactions with LF, to her quick defense of Tyrion....hell, to the fact that she's still wearing her wedding ring, fascinates the hell out of me. Since we already know that D&D knows how her story ends, I no longer view her character's development in terms of Book Sansa, but rather, in terms of Endgame Sansa (which is probably why they threw in the line about her not being a killer...yet). I truly believe they're writing her character as Endgame Sansa NOW...so we should see her doing/saying/behaving in ways that go beyond ASOS and even AFFC Sansa.
Â 


Now that you mention it, though, I wonder how the show will deal with Marillion. They could just cast another character who could do everything Marillion did but who would have another name, I guess. They need someone, maybe not to attempt to rape Sansa, but to play the part of Lysa's accomplice and LF's patsy.
I agree with everyone who said that splitting the snow scene and the Moon Door sequence would be a terrible decision.


Â 
I've been wondering about the Marillion situation for a while now. I think that if they include him, he'll be played by another actor (seeing as how the original Marillion got his tongue cut out in season 1). And if they DON'T include him....I'm at a loss as to who they intend to blame Lysa's murder on.
3512	Widows_Blood	2014-04-30	Ironically, they would be better off keeping her a redhead because changing her hair color to brown will make her look more like show Catelyn.Â

Â 
Isn't that what happens in the books though? She has red hair when she first meets Lysa. They could just dye her hair next season in preparation of Petyr meeting the Vale lords.
3515	solidviper	2014-04-30	In another thread, I referenced that this episode showed Sansa literally going from pawn to player. My Unsullied mother caught that line and fully believes Sansa will be the one to take LF down, and I agree.
Â 
Sansa is often compared to Catelyn, by other characters, and most of all by LF, and it's certain that his obsession with her stems from his obsession with Cat. Petyr relied on the Tully family throughout his youth, and trusted Catelyn. When his life was in danger (from a Stark, no less) Catelyn was the one who called to the foe to spare his life. Interestingly, although Sansa is Catelyn's doppleganger in appearance, I think she is the child most like her father. LF trusts Sansa because she seems meek, and because of the fact that since he equates Sansa with Cat in his mind, he believes he can trust her to be "on his side." Ultimately this will result in his biggest failure.. Sansa will take his life instead of sparing it.
Â 
I like that in a way, Sansa is doing what her parents failed to do (Catelyn spared LF, Ned trusted him). For me, I see her being the child who rights the wrongs of these ill decisions. Sansa does have the agency to avenge LF for the wrongs he has done the Starks and the Tullys. She just knows patience is a friend.


Â 
I love this entire post and agree 100% I also think Sansa is a lot like Ned

The Lannisters are in no position to invade anything right now. They have Tyrion's trial; Tywin's impending death; Jaime and Cersei hate each other; and the Crown is broke. Also, the Eyrie is impregnable. The Vale is the only region that could make war on anyone. They should still disguise Sansa, but it wouldn't be impossible. Also, it would eliminate the Lords Declarant plot.

Yeah, I am well aware of all of that. But logic behind the reasoning of not hiding Sansa is simply flawed. Here we have someone who has hid all his moves in the Game and suddenly he is opening his cards prematurely. It simply makes little sense in terms of LF and Sansa. As for Lords Declarant, it also will affect in unknown way... As have been said repeatedly, Alayne Stone makes sense. Not disguising Sansa takes a whole bunch of narrative... And we are talking about significant, long-term consequences of abandoning Alayne.
3519	Colonel Green	2014-04-30	Isn't that what happens in the books though? She has red hair when she first meets Lysa.


At the Fingers, not at the Eyrie.Â  There'd be no way she could change her hair after coming to the Eyrie, where there's tons of people, and we already know the Vale lords are appearing this season.
Â 


The Lannisters are in no position to invade anything right now.


They're the undisputed sovereigns at the moment, with the Tyrells behind them.Â  If Sansa's location came out, they would have to demand her return, and if refused (which they would be) they would invade.Â  You think Cersei would hold off on that?
Â 


In general, I find ALL of these little 'changes' intriguing. Everything from her immediate confrontational interactions with LF, to her quick defense of Tyrion....hell, to the fact that she's still wearing her wedding ring, fascinates the hell out of me. Since we already know that D&D knows how her story ends, I no longer view her character's development in terms of Book Sansa, but rather, in terms of Endgame Sansa (which is probably why they threw in the line about her not being a killer...yet). I truly believe they're writing her character as Endgame Sansa NOW...so we should see her doing/saying/behaving in ways that go beyond ASOS and even AFFC Sansa.


The writers have known the characters' final plot resolutions from the beginning (even if they only recently got more details), so I really don't see why you would suddenly see this as them writing "Endgame Sansa" (or "Endgame Anybody").Â  As for her being more distant from Baelish, given that the TV Baelish never acts like a creepy sociopath nonstop (whereas the book version is meant to be charming, if also a bit unsettling to her), the difference in attitudes is kind of necessary.
Â 
I'd actually say this is more of a problem, since the plot requires Sansa to be taken in by this guy to a considerable extent going forward.

Not really, when the lords interrogate Littlefinger, he'd introduce her as Sansa and ask them to pledge their swords to retake Winterfell. Which ever way GRRM intends to go with the wedding plot, the lords do that. It's not a significant alteration. They prune the plot a bit. I'd rather they do it other way.

Â 


Â 
I actually forgot about this sequence of events from the book - thanks for the reminder. So in theory, the scenes we see of Sansa hugging Lysa (still in noble garb and red hair) could be played out at the Fingers when Lysa is there to meet them... if in fact they've filmed that scene prior to going to the Eyrie. The problem with that idea is we've only seen upcoming snippets from the Eyrie and she's definitely still in red hair and her King's Landing clothing there - that's how this whole debate started. The clues seem to indicate she's not going to be disguised as Alayne at all unless it's in a later episode and that just doesn't make any sense either.
Â 
I still say they may drop the disguise in favor of just keeping her carefully hidden and out of public view during the wedding. Once things progress forward after the wedding (and the future events upcoming for the Lannisters / KL) it won't really matter anymore if she's disguised or not. No one's going to invade the Vale, we already know this.

The first shot of Lysa in the promo is her looking down from her throne (you can see from the angle), so she's not meeting them at the Fingers.

She can be "Alayne" without dyeing her hair.

No, that wouldn't work in the slightest.Â  Cersei would invade the Vale in a second if Sansa was there.Â  And Sansa being undisguised would render her entire plot going forward unworkable, seeing as it revolves around her being disguised.Â  None of the story with the Lords Declarant would work, nor would the scenario that is apparently being set up at the Gates of the Moon for The Winds of Winter.

Â 
While I agree with you it's going to significantly change the storyline for Sansa if they drop the Alayne disguise, I disagree that it would render the plot completely unworkable. D&D have already proven in seasons past they are willing to change a character's story entirely different from the books and still make it come out essentially the same.Â 
Â 
You're operating on the assumption of what "could" happen if Sansa's identity were discovered by the Lannisters. But we already know Cersei's about to lose almost all of her power soon (and in a BIG way) so speculating about a future invasion of the Vale is pointless to those of us who already know the books. Cersei's the only one crazy enough to demand an attack on the Eyrie (which is supposedly impregnable to siege anyways) and she's not going to have that power to demand soon. The only other person in power who could demand it will soon be dead.
Â 
SO ... with that future knowledge (and D&D likely had this already figured out) they could justify dropping Sansa's disguise and fast forwarding her plot to the point it won't matter anymore if anyone knows she's there or not.Â 
Â 
The lords of the Vale may not like or trust Littlefinger (with good reason) but they certainly aren't going to rise up against him because of Sansa once the Lannisters are no longer in power anyways.

Yeah, and there's no conceivable version of this story that comes out "essentially the same" with Sansa not disguised.Â  None of the Lords Declarant stuff from Book 4 would happen, nor attempt to arrange a betrothal with Harry the Heir under that guise, or the various factions that are poised around her at the end of AFFC trying to uncover her identity.Â  Abandoning the disguise would also make Littlefinger look like a moron (and Brienne, and Jaime, and Lady Stoneheart and the Brotherhood).Â  The knowledge that Sansa is alive and in the Vale would also have a major impact on the Northern plot.

No, Cersei will be in power for most of the season 5, and (depending on the situation based on some lines in the "Mercy" chapter) may gain power again afterward.

Good points. Leaning towards her being Alayne in the Eyrie, but without hair dye. Odd change, but because the show hasn't really spent too much time covering the coloring of the major houses, probably one that won't impact the show too much. Pretty sure none of the Show!Tullys are gingers.

Â 
All reasonable arguments. IF in fact they are going to leave the Vale's politics with the Lords in the show at all. They've shown nothing at all of the Dorne noble house storyline other than the bare necessity to introduce Oberyn. That story arch was actually quite large and good (especially once Myrcella was sent down there) but look where that went in the show - absolutely nowhere.
Â 
Why do you feel it's very important for them to keep the Vale's political story in the show for the future?Â 
Â 
The problem is, we're starting to move into the gray area going forward. We the readers aren't sure what's important for the future outcome of the overall story. We assume D&D are in the know on this and have chosen the stories they want to include and those they're dropping (out of necessity for the length of the episodes / seasons). Perhaps, like Dorne, the Vale does not end up playing a huge role in the final story line of the books and most of it can be skipped?

Sansa staying a red head isn't much of a diguise (not a very believable one anyways). I never really understood it in the books how everyone just fell for it that Littlefinger shows up with this "bastard daughter" who just happens to be the same age, coloring, height as Sansa Stark and looks strikingly like a Tully (even with dyed hair). Whatever George.

I thought the producers recently sat down with GRRM and went into depth about what happens with each character(?) Regardless, the reason I think they would be wring Endgame Sansa now, as opposed to before, is because they had a lot more material to work with before. They still had 3 books--and 3 chapters of AFFC--to go through. They don't have that anymore. They're vastly approaching the end of her chapters in the books, so if they're going to take her somewhere, they'd best start setting her up for it now (which, I think, is exactly what they're doing).

Because, even in the books, they are more crucial to the certain plot, then the other lords. How does Dorne lords impact on Doran's plotting and Arianne's conspiracy? Very little. Westerland lords on Tywin and his family? None. Riverlords? Except of Freys, none is very crucial. We have been introduced to Northern lords who impact the plots - Reed children, Boltons, Karstark, Umber. The Vale lords impact a lot the storyline in the Vale, hence the casting of them. Between their dislike of LF, possible conspiracy and Sansa's hidden identity, they are more prominent than Dorne, Westerlands' or Stormlands' lords, for example.

Â
3542	Annara Snow	2014-04-30	I don't understand how "Sansa isn't dying her hair" has lead to the conclusion "Sansa will not be hiding her identity". The latter makes no sense at all and would torpedo every storyline she has from now on for at least a season and a half if not more.
Â 
The former really isn't a big deal that some book fans make it out to be. In the book, it wasn't some incredible disguise;Â  I just thought that the reasoning was "Petyr Baelish's dark haired bastard daughter appears at the same time that Sansa goes missing" would be a tiny bit less suspicious than "Petyr Baelish's auburn haired bastard daughter appears at the same time Sansa goes missing." However, the Unsullied won't be wondering why she isn't dying her hair - I don't think it's been established how good, if any, hair dye exists in-universe, and there can be other reasons not to do it in-universe; dark hair may not look convincingly natural on her* (blonde makes little sense since it would make her look even less like her "father"), she may run out of hair dye or someone may notice the roots showing - and a bastard daughter with dyed hair would look more suspicious than ginger bastard daughter. (And if it's supposed to be a Tully trait, would anyone be surprised that LF went for a woman with similar hair colour to Cat?)
Tyrion never tried to dye his hair or otherwise change his appearance to pass as Yollo/Hugor, and he should be far more recognizable than Sansa, especially in the books. I'm sure that there are many more "maids of three and ten (or around that age), auburn hair, blue eyes, beautiful" than there are "incredibly ugly dwarfs with eyes of different hair colors and half a nose missing".
Â 
Â 
* Which may be one of the reasons they're dropping it in the show; Sophie is a natural blonde, so dark hair may not look convincing on her (which may also be why her hair is lighter than Michelle's/Catelyn's in the first place). In addition to that, the show is not known for overestimating its audience and their ability to keep track of characters (Osha/Asha/Yara, Robert/Robin), and maybe they're right, if it's actually true that there are quite a few casual viewers who know Sansa as "ginger Stark". 
Â 


True, Chebyshov, but "He did nothing" came only well after LF explained that Tyrion in fact did nothing. It was hardly something that she "just knew."
I wouldn't think that much of it were it not for this quote from a Spanish language magazine interview with Sophie Turner (the April issue, I think), where Sophie Turner says the following when asked about the influence of Tyrion and Sansa's relationship on Sansa (translated from Spanish):
"[Cutting out some stuff about Joffrey] Tyrion is her only and true friend, he's the only one who's been honest with her. Well, she has Shae but Shae's not completely sincere with Sansa. She could trust Tyrion completely, if she wished to. It's one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones, especially for my character."
I didn't think that much of it at the time (blah blah blah whitewashing), but after 4x04 and Alex Graves' recent revelation that he is spoiled for post-ADWD books and spoils the actors so that they know how to act in certain scenes, I'm starting to wonder about the possibilities for Sansa and Tyrion becoming (platonic, to be clear) allies in the future, post-ADWD. The HBO viewers' guide talking all about Tyrion treating Sansa with the utmost respect could be whitewashing, or it could be setting something up down the line for a reasonably amicable alliance.


Â 
There are three possibilities for that quote:
Â 
1) It's been wrongly translated,
2) Sophie was misquoted in the article,
3) Sophie didn't express herself well.
Â 
I can see her saying that it's one of the most important relationships for Sansa, but "one of the most important relationships in GoT" as a whole? That makes no sense from anything seen in the books or in the show - especially considering the fact that it also goes against everything she's said in every other interview; just going by her interviews, she's singled out Margaery, not Tyrion, as her biggest influence in KL in becoming a 'player' (Tyrion got mentioned, but only as one of the people in KL she observed and 'soaked' things from, together with Cersei and Margaery), and she's also categorically ruled out the possibility of Sansa developing any genuine romantic interest in Tyrion in every interview (and made a face to express how she or Sansa feels about the marriage in general), so how exactly would Tyrion become the most important relationship in her story, trumping her parents, her siblings, anyone she has or will have romantic interest in, Littlefinger, Joffrey, Cersei, Sweetrobin, anyone else she will get to interact while she's in Vale in near future... or how is Sansa going to become the most important, or one of the most important relationships in Tyrion's story, trumping Tywin, Cersei, Jaime, Tysha, Shae, anyone he does or will interact in Essos...? Especially since they aren't even likely to meet again until late in Winds of Winter.Â  Even in the unlikely outcome that they end up ruling Westeros together, that still wouldn't be the case.
Â 
Regarding the differences between Sansa's behavior to LF/Tyrion, I think it's most likely the result of the following:
Â 
1) the show being generally less subtle than the books and making everything more obvious (unless they're completely ignoring it) because of the lack of internal monologue - so, instead of hinting that Sansa does not trust LF and does not hate Tyrion, they do their best to hammer it home,
2) LF being a lot more obviously creepy and villainous in the show (see point 1),
3) Tyrion being portrayed as a much nicer guy and having treated Sansa better than he did in the book,
4) the show's attempts to minimize every conflict between the "good guys" (as Colonel Green pointed out) - therefore, in order to make sure the audience likes Sansa (the logic goes) it has to be spelled out that she trusts the show's Good Guy and distrusts the show's Bad Guy.
Â 
There is nothing in the books that prevents Sansa and Tyrion from forming an amicable alliance down the line, whenever they see each other again without the context of Sansa being in Lannister hands and forced into marriage with him - they don't hate each other and even their negative thoughts about each other are very mild. Therefore, changes really aren't necessary to make that work (especially if we're assuming that the show is being faithful to George's synopsis he gave D&D; if George thinks that the characters could conceivably form amicable relations the way they've been so far, I don't see why they would have to be changed for the show to make the exact same thing possible).

Ok, granted, both Catelyn and Lysa seemed to have darker auburn red hair but it's still definitely there and for that matter wasn't Robb's hair a bit auburn too? They're clearly not the dark brunette / black hair of the Starks - maybe the colorings were too vague in the show for many viewers but I noticed!Â 
Â 
Still... it's not very believable to have this *not* disguised but somehow disguised Sansa we see in the previews. Color me confused (har har)Â  
Â 
Edit: Also, in response to your comment that you're not convinced the Vale Lords didn't fall for the disguise in the books, what made you think that? I honestly didn't really give it much thought when I read it and don't remember any clues or hints so I probably missed that whole thing if there was some suspicion of Sansa's true identity. I would love to know what I missed!Â

"Bronze Yohn had slate-grey eyes, half-hidden beneath the bushiest eyebrows she had ever seen. They crinkled when he looked down at her. "Do I know you, girl?"

"There is no need. It is plain that he has won." Bronze Yohn's grey eyes considered Petyr Baelish. "I like it not, but it would seem you have your year. Best use it well, my lord. Not all of us are fooled." He opened the door so forcefully that he all but wrenched it off its hinges.

"Is that what passes for courtesy at Heart's Home?" Anya Waynwood's hair was greying and she had crow's-feet around her eyes and loose skin beneath her chin, but there was no mistaking the air of nobility about her. "The girl is young and gently bred, and has suffered enough horrors. Mind your tongue, ser."


Â 
The way Myranda mentioned the new LC of the NW in front of Sansa was suspicious, as was her question about the size of LF's "finger". The latter would be an odd thing to ask someone's daughter. I got to the impression that she was trying to see her reactions and check if she really is LF's daughter as she claims to be.
3544	CandleWisps	2014-04-30	Â 
Agreed. Sansa has what? 3 chapters in AFFC? Ayra's in a similar predicament, which is why they're dragging out her story. "Only Cat" needs to be her episode 10 conclusion. As it is, we're likely to see TWOW material for Sansa's arc next year.


Â 
 Â  This is what seems to be happening with a lot of other characters arcs as well, like Brienne/LS, Bran and Bloodraven, etc. At this point my hope that at least the WoW will be released before us book readers become Unsullied is fairly nonexistent

While the other stuff is certainly evidence, I think people read way too much into this.Â  Firstly, if Waynwood knew who she was, she wouldn't be making a statement like that that supposedly gives it away.Â  The "horrors" refer to the murder of Lysa.
3546	Mladen	2014-04-30	I don't understand how "Sansa isn't dying her hair" has lead to the conclusion "Sansa will not be hiding her identity". The latter makes no sense at all and would torpedo every storyline she has from now on for at least a season and a half if not more.


Â 
Hmmm, IDK, perhaps you are right. I usually believed that when we come to this moment, Turner would stop dying her hair and Alayne would be blonde. But the problem is, as some mentioned, with the ring. Of course, it is premature to conclude anything, but I think it is safe to say that Sansa is not changing her hair color, due to that scene in the courtyard when it's snowing.

True... We are seeing fast decimating of book material. Producers are relentless and apparently they don't want to destroy the show by slowing it too much like Martin slowed the plot in the books with AFFC and ADWD. I imagine we might see Season 5 being in some portion, unknown to us, and for season 6 it is certain, that if Martin doesn't publish TWOW by then, we will be Unsullied too. I don't see how much expansions can be made with half of the stories...

I'm not sure what the problem with the ring is? Taking it off should be pretty easy.  I don't know why they thought Sansa should be wearing it while talking to Lysa, but she's definitely going to be taking it off soon - it's not like she's going to go around meeting people in the Vale with a ring and pretending to be, what, a 15-year old widow LF picked up somewhere? Sansa not managing to take it off yet is dumb, but the latter would just be completely absurd.

Which is basically my point. It would be absurd not to go through with transformation to Alayne. It is just that it's a but messed up. I thought we might see the birth of Alayne this episode, but we might see it in the next, before arrival to Eyrie. Or sometime in Eyrie.

As far as we know, actors know nothing about the end game of their characters. And TBH, do you believe that Sansa/Tyrion relationship is one of the most important in the series? I mean, I could think like dozen or two relationships that are more pressing and more important than Sansa/Tyrion. For her character, yes, but overall, I don't think so. Although I could be wrong.

The reason is given, and I admit it was my mistake for using the phrase that is intellectual property of someone else without asking. As Florina said, on book subforum, there is a series of threads "From Pawn to Player" dedicated to Sansa. This thread, for clarification, isn't in any way connected with the above-mentioned thread, as this thread is a place for discussion TV/book parallels and deviations in Sansa's storylines.

Both Jon and bran have had positive interactions with tyrion too. If this is heading to tyrion arriving in westeros with dany and her dragons then these relationships are very important. Even more so if that wall comes down
3560	Raksha 2014	2014-05-01	Or, Sansa could eventually escape into the Vale and encounter the barbarian tribes (Shagga Likes Axes!), and her status as Tyrion's wife might prove helpful in getting their help/protection. Â

Uh, I already explained why. You may want to look at the rest of my post. And when you're at it, please explain how exactly it makes sense for Tyrion to become more important to Sansa than  every other person in her life  over the course of the next two books. Sophie has called Margaery her main influence in KL on becoming a player, and she has made it clear in every interview that Sansa doesn't love Tyrion and cannot develop any genuine romantic interest in him, which I am sure you've accepted since Sophie has said it. So, how exactly is he the single most important person in her life, even trumping her family?
Or you may just accept the much more likely explanation that she meant that it is one of the most important relationships for her character, rather than one of the most important relationships in the show overall (and therefore the one overwhelmingly most important relationship for Sansa).
Â 
Also, instead of insinuating that I'm implying that Sophie is "clueless", which I definitely didn't do, how about replying to what I actually postulated, i.e. that it's likely to be a bad translation, misquote or a case of not expressing oneself 100% perfectly in an oral interview, which everyone does, including actors? How about acknowledging the fact that the quote isn't even actually a quite but a translation from Spanish? And, unless Sophie speaks Spanish, the original Spanish quote is also a translation of what she actually said? So, we have an interviewer transcribing words of an actress who's speaking - as opposed to preparing a written statement - and translating them to Spanish and then someone else translating them to English. There are so many opportunities for misquotes and things being lost in translation.
Â 
I'm willing to bet that she actually said or meant to say "It's one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones for my character", not "it's one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones... especially for my character".
Â 
But why pay attention to logic if you can try to use it as evidence that Sansa/Tyrion is somehow in top 5 (or whatever) most important relationships in the show overall, despite the evidence to the contrary, i.e. the show itself and books themselves?

And that would make Sansa and Tyrion one of the most important relationships in GoT overall? How exactly?
It could make it one of the most important relationships for Sansa, but not one of the most important overall (which would imply it's the single most important relationship in her life and the most or one of the couple of most important in Tyrion's).
I don't doubt that there will be interaction between them, but how would that make it one of the most important relationships in the series, unless they are two heads of the dragon or Azor Again reborn and Nissa Nissa or something equally unlikely?
Â

3563	Grail King	2014-05-01	"Not yet, anyway" was one of the most blatant bits of show-only foreshadowing that the show has provided to date. The fact that the line transitioned to a scene with Sansa and LF could mean either 1) Sansa kills LF or 2) Sansa, corrupted by LF's influence, kills someone.Interesting that TV Sansa immediately denies that Tyrion murdered Joffrey and says "I just do" when asked how she knows that, even though she readily comes up with logical explanations for her other conclusions. Book Sansa certainly believed Tyrion could have done it (and vice versa, although Book Tyrion never thought Sansa could have pulled it off by herself, as I recall, whereas TV Tyrion just states that Sansa's not a killer...yet). Curious change from the books.


I tied that in with the scene where Jamie and Brienne Â were talking about her overlooking the Godswood and as they left Dontos floats by and Sansa sensed 'something' and looked around but saw nothing.
Â 
Maybe the producers are giving hints of her 6th sense?

Well Book!Sansa seems to have/develop a decent sense of intuition (I'm currently rereading, and even in AGoT she's creeped out by LF). They might be playing that up. It's sad...she likely would have been a warg if Lady hadn't been killed. I don't mind the idea of her developing something of a 6th sense, or at least the show-runners giving Sansa a bit more credit than being the "stupid little girl" some others might see.
3565	Grail King	2014-05-01	Woman of War, I noticed Sansa being blunt and pointed with LF as well, although she was still somewhat guarded: she didn't shrug off LF when he ran his hand down her arm, although she was clearly uncomfortable.
LF is also much more openly creepy and handsy with Sansa than he was at this point in the books. I didn't think they would do the LF/Sansa kiss, but after the most recent episodes I think a kiss would hardly be shocking.
One thing I'd forgotten is that Sophie Turner usually misses two or three episodes a season. 4x09 is out, but it's probably a safe bet that she's appearing in 4x10 and 4x07. If she sits out 4x06, then 4x07 seems a very unlikely candidate for "Only Cat," I agree.
The only thing about putting "Only Cat" in the finale is that I think that the snow scene has to be in the same episode as the confrontation with Lysa, and that seems like a lot for an episode that's going to be crammed to the gills with other things. On the other hand, if not 4x10, where would it go?


The look on her face was she's creeped, but also ahhhh now I know one thing he wants, I think at that point she remembered Shaes words to her about LF.

Why does everyone assume that because some of the children in the current Stark generation can warg that all of them can? There's been absolutely no hints Sansa can or will warg. Her Direwolf is dead as well, her connection to the Starks is very faint by this time. I don't think all of the Stark children are wargs. I think it's an inherited trait that can skip some members otherwise you'd have entire households of them. That's just not the case.

Â 
Yeah I think it's a pretty big stretch of imagination to believe Sansa's going to start warging. Just because she's 'force sensitive' so to speak doesn't mean she's got ESP in regards to Littlefinger or anyone else. The transformation we're seeing her go through is from 'street smarts' she's learned by being betrayed and seeing her family destroyed. She's a survivor and learning to play the game to survive, and that's far more useful than magic in Sansa's world right now.
Â 
I think they're playing it well in the show. She went from being the starry-eyed innocent in the first season who wants to marry a prince and have blonde babies, to a young woman who by now has seen horrific things happen and learned how other females in her world (Cersei, Olenna, Margaery, Shae) handle men and keep on their toes to stay ahead of the curve. She's learning. It's not magic, it's common sense and learned cleverness.
3571	Chebyshov	2014-05-01	But didn't he also say that the death of Lady has left Sansa, in a way, fundamentally astray. Which of course doesn't mean it'll never happen for Sansa as well, simply thwarts the development of the trait.


Â 
Exactly. Though it's been theorized that if she does gain the ability to warg, it will be through birds.

Â 
The warg, as we have found in Varamyr's chapter, is born, not created. If all 6 Stark children are wargs, they got it the moment they were born. The direwolves were not sole "activation button", plus we have seen that Sansa's control over Lady has been unnaturally strong.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Yeah I think it's a pretty big stretch of imagination to believe Sansa's going to start warging.


Â 
I would disagree... Martin would never include something like that in the plot, unless he plans to use it at some point. It's like giving Daenerys fossilized eggs which never hatch. Sansa is a warg, Martin said so and naturally, people assume that at some point of her life, just like any of her siblings, she would start warging. She is a warg, thus a skinchanger, which means she can warg into any animal.
Â 
She'sÂ learning. It's not magic, it's common sense and learned cleverness.

Â 
Does one exclude the other? Absolutely not. We have rather great example of Bloodraven who used his gift to get advantage in the Game. Arya is on the path of becoming Faceless man, and her warging dreams are there. She is learning and does it mean they are meaningless? Absolutely not. The same goes for all the Stark kids. Politics and magic are not mutually exclusive as they coexist in the world.

Wait, where does he ever state in the books that Sansa's experiencing warging premonitions or abilities? It's quite a bit different for him to mention in an interview that all of the kids have the ability to some degree or another (and then says Sansa's lost her direwolf so she wouldn't be showing any traits) and him actually writing about it in the book. That's not confirmation Sansa's going to warg. It's still a stretch. Wishful thinking maybe. It's not the same as giving Daenarys fossilized eggs, not even close. GRRM is very good at giving lots and lots of false leads and red herrings too. He loves to work everyone up with all these theories.Â 
Â 
I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying at this point it's improbable Sansa's future holds warging in it. There's no proof whatsoever in the book or the show thus far.
Â 
Personally I prefer her growing up to be a very savvy political player based on experience (since she started out the most naive of all the children) rather than more magical stuff.
3575	ground_control	2014-05-01	The reason is given, and I admit it was my mistake for using the phrase that is intellectual property of someone else without asking. As Florina said, on book subforum, there is a series of threads "From Pawn to Player" dedicated to Sansa. This thread, for clarification, isn't in any way connected with the above-mentioned thread, as this thread is a place for discussion TV/book parallels and deviations in Sansa's storylines.


Ah. Â I don't recall if I have read those posts specifically, but this wasn't the first time I've heard that phrase (from pawn to player), so I've probably at least seen them.
Â 
Anyway, I suppose I should at least say *something* on topic 
Â 
I'm surprised nobody has mentioned this yet (or maybe I missed it), but in the books, doesn't Sansa notice the missing stone before leaving with Ser Dontos? Â I was a bit disappointed that in the show Littlefinger had to point it out to her.

Sending her a direwolf, unnatural tameness of Lady, old dog at Fingers... All of these are actually pointing that Sansa is indeed a warg. Once again, warg is being born not taught.
Â

Actually it is. It is plot tool aka Chekhov's gun 1.01. The author would never create something unless is a meaningful for the plot. That is how we distinguish good from bad authors. Just as he gave fossilized eggs to Dany so she would hatch them and get dragons, he gave Sansa warging ability that we think will have influence on the plot in some way. It is not wishful thinking, it's understanding how narrative works.
Â

Martin never said such thing. He said only that Sansa's powers are hindered due to Lady's death.

I'll bow out now as I don't really hold with the opinion of her warging as any importance in her story arc. I'll be pleasantly surprised down the road if George decides to take her that route.

Here is the link about all kids being wargs
Â 


I will now tell the story of what GRRM said when asked about the Stark children and their ability as wargs. He was asked if the trait of being a warg ran in the Stark family.
"I don't know if I want to get into genetics - this is fantasy, not scifi" He replied. "I don't think this is necessarily a 'Stark' ability, though all the children have it to one extent or another. They also realize it to one extent or another. Arya doesn't realize she has it, she keeps thinking she has these weird dreams, and of course Bran is much further along". Thats all I have in of an exact quote in my notes. I believe he went on to say something about how Bran was seeking the crow and then took the next question.

I have to search for that "hinder part" more extensively.

"Interpretation" of the text is still simply your own personal opinion based on clues you choose to single out. They may or may not result in actual in-text or in-show warging for Sansa. No one can predict that as fact. It's not fact she's a confirmed warg, still just speculation.

I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. Like I said, Jon is the best example of someone maturing as a character into a true political player, while also developing his warg abilities.

Â 
I feel like it's downplaying a more important part of Sansa's transformation (that was displayed so well on screen last episode with Littlefinger) to suggest she's got some '6th sense' happening. Why not just stick to the facts we're presented in the scene?

Â 
First, it is not interpretation as it is plainly said in the books. Since you argue that she is not a warg, you could also argue she is not a female, or any other biological trait she was born with. Simply, she is born that way. the question we all should be asking isn't "is she a warg?" since we know the answer on that, but "will she be warging anything to the end of the books?" And that is something neither of us knows the answer.Â 
Â 
As for my opinion, and the fact that people are driven away from discussion, I honestly don't see much of it happening. I post my opinion and people may argue with me by providing me the textual reference that makes me wrong. I haven't shoot down anyone's respond, as I am not being particularly active on these threads. Some debates naturally come to an end, and that's all.Â

Â

Â 
This. Just as Arya's road of becoming FM isn't downplayed by her warging ability, just as Jon's learning to lead arc hasn't been compromised by his warging abilities, I don't see a reason why Sansa would be different.Â
3587	salmonsnake	2014-05-01	The two of you are not in disagreement, only confused about a very, very small thing. 'Warging' as the act of warging, an instance where it takes place; differentiated from 'being a warg', the innate trait, the potentiality of the act. In the sense that I have the potentiality to learn a new language, and can realize that potential to different degrees by, say, being taught a word or two, or by more intensive study, immersing myself in the language. Put in this way, Envie might as well be saying "has Sansa learnt any new languages in the texts? If I recall correctly, she hasn't, and I'd venture to speculate that she might not ever learn a new language in the course of the last two books." That is not the same as saying "Sansa is incapable of learning new languages."
3588	Wouter	2014-05-01	Â 
As far as we know, actors know nothing about the end game of their characters.Â 


Director Alex Graves mentioned in a recent interview ( see http://www.hitfix.co...freys-wedding/2 ) that he told a number of actors what would happen to their character in later seasons (he in turn picked this up from David and/or Dan), because he felt it would affect how certain scenes should be acted and/or directed. So, allthough we don't know if Sophie Turner is one of those who was told certain info about later developments, it's a possibility to keep in mind.Â 
Â 
One possible reason why this could turn into a very important relationship - and why D&D have made sure Tyrion was quite a bit nicer than he was in the books - is that they remain married, maybe for political reasons as I could see Tyrion being in a position to be Dany's and/or Jon's heir in the end. Since Martin also wrote the marriage between the Durrandon heir and Orys Baratheon, which came to be in even worse circumstances for the unwilling bride, it wouldn't be impossible for him to intend that.Â 
Â 
Intrigued by the "not a killer - YET" line. Foremost candidate to be killed by Sansa is LF himself, but admittedly her storyline could take a dark turn in the Vale too, under the dark influence of LF. I hope it is the first that is being foreshadowed, rather than the latter.
Â 
As for the warg thing, GRRM explicitly said all the Stark kids are wargs. I think this will come into play at some point in Sansa's storyline, though not with the emphasis it has in Bran's or Arya's story, to be sure.
Â 
That LF dumped the poison necklace in the episode before surprised me; maybe this will be a change from what ends up happening in the books, or the hairnet will not be important anymore after all?

Â 
Maybe they thought it would be too weird for LF not to dispose of it (it would have been), or Sansa ends up offing LF in another way (I'm inclined to agree that she's being foreshadowed as his killer). A notable change, but it doesn't rule out Sansa's ability to poison him; mayhaps she'll do it with Sweetsleep.
Â 
I'm going to be curious if they leave Lysa describing [in detail] the ingredients to make moon tea in front of Sansa. Can't help but feel like that's going to matter later.

Since Martin also wrote the marriage between the Durrandon heir and Orys Baratheon, which came to be in even worse circumstances for the unwilling bride, it wouldn't be impossible for him to intend that.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
How?
Â 
The only thing that Tyrion can be the heir to is Casterly Rock.
Â 
As for Sansa and Tyrion remaining married for political reasons, I can only see them remaining "married", i.e. officially but not really* - and only for a while; because it's convenient for Sansa to be unable to marry anyone else, as long as she doesn't have to live with and have sex with Tyrion. But in the long run, if she wants to be a political force, a marriage to Tyrion Lannister has no advantages for Sansa and only has disadvantages: the North and the Riverlands are never going to accept her if she is married to a Lannister.
Â 
* As for the idea that they could actually be married and live as husband and wife for political reasons? That's completely out of the question, IMO. It goes against everything in Sansa's arc and everything in Tyrion's arc. Sansa's arc has shown her being disillusioned with arranged marriages and people wanting her for her claim, slowly starting to develop an acceptance of non-conventional behavior (bastards, women who have sexual relationships outside of marriage like Ellaria or Mya) and generally changing her views on social conventions, as well as developing her sexuality (which, in the books, where we are in her head, has been focusing on a completely socially inappropriate object of desire, who would not be a suitable husband for a highborn lady in any way), and the theme of sexual agency - and being denied it by others - are very prominent in her arc. Deciding to be a good wife in a political marriage would not fit with her character development; deciding to be a good wife in a political marriage that she was forced into by her captors? Not gonna happen.
Â 
Yes, GRRM wrote a story where a girl ended up falling in love with a man she was forced to marry - but 1) that was the start of Dany's story and the beginning of her journey from powerlessness to power, and ended up with Dany being widowed, hatching dragons and becoming a powerful queen - in book 1; rather than the ending of Dany's story; 2) the fact that there's one story of one of the main female characters ending up falling in love with a man she was forced to marry is an additional reason why it won't happen with another female character (aside from GRRM making sure to show that this female character, Sansa, has no romantic interest and sexual attraction to that guy at all, despite having some rather positive views about his otherwise). I also don't think that any of the main female characters will get an ending where they're happily married and live ever after with the guy they were forced to marry. Because, really - do you think GRRM is writing these books to say "hey, forced marriages are awesome, you young girls just have to learn to like it"?
Â 
It also goes completely against everything in Tyrion's arc. While Sansa wants someone who will love her for herself (which is definitely not Tyrion), Tyrion wants, most of all, someone who will really want him (which is definitely not Sansa). There was never anything satisfying in that marriage for either of them, and neither of them even wanted it. Unless you think that GRRM was really always planning for a sudden twist in which Sansa implausibly 100% changes her feelings and falls in love/finds herself incredibly attracted with Tyrion, without any setup at all... which would serve the narrative purpose of, what, Tyrion's wish-fulfillment in the most unlikely way possible, where, instead of genuinely exploring Tyrion's personal issues with women and having Tyrion grow as a person, Sansa becomes Tyrion's prize - a beautiful, highborn virginal young trophy wife with a great claim, who has come to "see the light" and fall for him for being such an awesome dude (even though his character arc since they last met has been about him getting darker and darker)?
Â 
Not gonna happen.
Â 

Â 
One possible reason why this could turn into a very important relationship - and why D&D have made sure Tyrion was quite a bit nicer than he was in the books -

Â 
The reason why they made sure Tyrion was quite a bit nicer with Sansa than he was in the books is the same reason why they made sure Tyrion was quite a bit nicer with Shae, why he doesn't have a singer killed and made into a stew, and why they made sure he was quite a bit nicer in every other situation: because they want to make sure that the viewers like Tyrion. Whether it's because of how much they like Tyrion or because they think that the TV audiences need an unambiguously likable main character to invest in after Ned Stark's death, or both.
Â 

Â 
Since Martin also wrote the marriage between the Durrandon heir and Orys Baratheon, which came to be in even worse circumstances for the unwilling bride, it wouldn't be impossible for him to intend that.Â 
Â 

Â 
That's a part of the historical background (from 300 years before), and neither Orys nor his wife are anywhere close to being major characters in the series - they're barely characters.
Â 
That's like saying that Dany will end up becoming a slaver because her ancestors were slavers in Valyria.

Really well put. It would absolutely undermine both Sansa and Tyrion as characters. And this is also why I'm hoping the whole Harry the Heir thing is a big bust for Sansa...her ending up playing the good wife in a political marriage would be a huge regression. Maybe she could end up being friendly with Tyrion, but definitely not his wife.

Dany and her forces are the likely victors in the fight for the Iron Throne - such as it will be by the endgame (I don't think the 7K will split, allthough admittedly this remains to be seen). Possibly she will reach some kind of alliance with the Starks in general or with Jon Snow (and others who are aware of the threat of the ... Others) in particular. Maybe she will end up falling in love with Jon, as may be indicated by some of the visions in the House of Undying.
Â 
Regardless of whether we end up with Dany alone in a position of power, Dany and Jon together or Jon alone (of course there are other possibilities like Stannis or Shireen or (f)Aegon Â or even Tommen, but I'm going with the ones that seem more likely to me), there's the question of survival and heirs. Jon and Dany are main characters, both have aspects of a messiah (hell, there are entire subsections of the "fans" on the forum devoted to push one or the other as "Azor Ahai" candidate) and it would seem that one or both will play a decisive role in the conflict with the Others. Messianic figures often end up paying a price for their heroic acts and may die or "retreat" (think Frodo in LOTR or Rand Al'thor in WOT, or even Ben Sisko in DS9).Â 
Â 
In the case of ASOIAF, Jon already needs a resurrection and may turn into a version of Beric Dondarrion (who felt he lost something each time, and was consumed by his mission at the time of death) or Victarion (with his fiery, unnatural hand) or Melisandre (who doesn't really need to eat or to sleep). He also swore a vow to not take lands and father no children, and while he could break that in the interests of the defence against the Others it could come back into play once the threat is defeated (for now). Bottom line, I doubt Jon will end up being the father of a long line of heirs for the Iron Throne; he may die in the war, he may refuse to sit the throne, he may decide to rule while needed but withdraw as soon as possible. Depending on how the resurrection works, he may not even be strictly human anymore.
Â 
For Dany, on the other hand, we have the problem of heirs. Ever since the stillbirth of Rhaego, there is doubt about her fertility. She has no immediate family, and she will likely end up proving Aegon is not Rhaegar's son and may well end up getting him killed. Marriages to Hizdahr or to a Greyjoy (the latter suggested in the house of the undying) are unlikely to yield a heir, or to survive for long. If she is attracted to Jon, he may not return the feeling or circumstances may be against them. Should Dany not be able to give birth (whatever the reason), she has the problem of naming a heir. The Martells and Baratheons are her closest kin I suppose, but both Stannis and Arianne have likely been opposing her (if not she could name Stannis/Shireen or Arianne as heir). Another option would be to look at her own followers, and here is where Tyrion could come into play. Especially if by this time, he has proven his worth to her (seems possible) and has become a dragonrider (Viserion may be reserved for him).Â And should it turn out he is Aerys' bastard (or that Dany believes him to be), then he would even get a (weak) blood claim which may be enough in the absence of other Targaryens.
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â As for the idea that they could actually be married and live as husband and wife for political reasons? That's completely out of the question, IMO. It goes against everything in Sansa's arc and everything in Tyrion's arc. Sansa's arc has shown her being disillusioned with arranged marriages and people wanting her for her claim, slowly starting to develop an acceptance of non-conventional behavior (bastards, women who have sexual relationships outside of marriage like Ellaria or Mya) and generally changing her views on social conventions, as well as developing her sexuality (which, in the books, where we are in her head, has been focusing on a completely socially inappropriate object of desire, who would not be a suitable husband for a highborn lady in any way), and the theme of sexual agency - and being denied it by others - are very prominent in her arc. Deciding to be a good wife in a political marriage would not fit with her character development; deciding to be a good wife in a political marriageÂ that she was forced into by her captors? Not gonna happen.
The marriage that she was forced into by her captors is finished, except as a vehicle for Sansa's defense against other unwanted marriages. I agree on that front. However, that doesn't mean that resuming the marriage cannot be (re-)negotiated between the Starks and those who would want the marriage (Tyrion and/or Dany?) in order to keep the north glued to the south. Essentially, Sansa would be sold - or would sell herself - for political gain, not unlike what happened with the Hizdahr/Dany marriage. The marriage would then resemble Lysa Tully/Jon Arryn rather than "Arya Stark"/Ramsay Bolton.
Â 
I see where you are coming from wrt Sansa's arc, but that Sansa has become disillusioned with arranged marriages doesn't have to mean that she will definitely end up avoiding those alltogether. We don't know the mind of the author, and as reader we have certain ideas about the overarching plot for each character but GRRM may have other plans. Sansa's mother entered a political marriage, and I got the impression Catelyn wasn't under any illusions about what was happening.
Â 
Agency is all well and good, but this is a story about a culture/time/place where it isn't the norm - especially for highborn women - to get much of a say in who they have to marry. Arya is more likely to just be able to chose her husband (or to not enter any marriage at all), because she is living outside the norms of her society. Sansa still seems to conform to the general social norms of Westeros, as of AFFC.
Â 

Â 
Â 
I also don't think that any of the main female characters will get an ending where they're happily married and live ever after with the guy they were forced to marry. Because, really - do you think GRRM is writing these books to say "hey, forced marriages are awesome, you young girls just have to learn to like it"?
Â  GRRM has said that he hates allegories; he is telling a story, it's not a political pamphlet and not necessarily meant as a source for life lessons. I doubt he is saying "hey assassins are awesone, young girls just have to learn how to become that", yet he is doing the Arya arc the way he is.Â 
Â 
This is also why I mentioned the Durrandon girl; while we don't know if she ever got to like Orys even a little bit, certain is that this 100% forced marriage (in circumstances that were even more humilating for the girl than Sansa/Tyrion) ended up kickstarting the Baratheon line. I can hardly imagine that was a pleasant marriage, but from a political POV apparently it was "succesful". Aegon Targaryen got away with it, unlike Tywin Lannister.
Â 

It also goes completely against everything in Tyrion's arc. While Sansa wants someone who will love her for herself (which is definitely not Tyrion), Tyrion wants, most of all, someone who will really want him (which is definitely not Sansa). There was never anything satisfying in that marriage for either of them, and neither of them even wanted it.Â 

Sansa never wanted it, but Tyrion - in books and show - really wanted it to work and tried to make it work. In ADWD, there are signs that Tyrion is irritated that Sansa "wasn't loyal" to him. I'm far from certain that Tyrion would prefer Penny, who probably really wants him, over Sansa. There is an intriguing line in his last ADWD chapter where he mentions that he misses his wife, and the context is deliberately kept vague enough to make it unclear whether he means Sansa or Tysha.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The reason why they made sure Tyrion was quite a bit nicer with Sansa than he was in the books is the same reason why they made sure Tyrion was quite a bit nicer with Shae, why he doesn't have a singer killed and made into a stew, and why they made sure he was quite a bit nicer in every other situation: because they want to make sure that the viewers like Tyrion. Whether it's because of how much they like Tyrion or because they think that the TV audiences need an unambiguously likable main character to invest to after Ned Stark's death, or both.
And by the same reasoning, they would want to prepare the ground for acceptance of an eventual Sansa/Tyrion marriage (and not just a mockery, this time) if they know this as end-game. The show is already under fire for alleged sexism, imagine the uproar in that case if they don't play their cards very carefully.
Â 
I guess they will tone down Tyrion's behaviour in Essos, by the same token. Allthough he is probably going to kill Shae this season. Â

3594	Epyon	2014-05-01	I really enjoyed the scene with Sansa/LF this week, well acted on both sides... A couple things I noticed:
Â 
-LF feels like a cat playing with its food, as he talks to Sansa... He's prodding/testing her with every statement.
Â 
-When Sansa asks him what he wants, his eyes (and right hand) slide down her side towards her left hand. Could be over analyzing, since Westerosi don't use wedding rings, but it would be an implication.
Â 
-LF ends his speech to Sansa by saying of his "new friends" (the Tyrells), "..nothing like a thoughtful gift, to make a new friendship ***grow strong***." (A pretty direct play on house Tyrell's words). It's subtle, and not known if show Sansa caught his little pun, but he did effectively just tell her that house Tyrell where his co-conspirators.... something that I don't remember happening in the books.
3595	Wouter	2014-05-01	LF did tell Sansa, in the books, that Olenna took the poison. He also explained the motive.
Â 
I think S4 Sansa is sharp enough to pick up the "grow strong" reference.

The marriage would then resemble Lysa Tully/Jon Arryn rather than "Arya Stark"/Ramsay Bolton.


Â 
And those marriages turned out so well, didn't they?
Â 
Suffice to say, we seem to have completely different ideas about what this series is about. I don't see it as a story about the three main "heroes" defeating the bad guys (Others), dividing the land between them and installing a new dynasty, with everyone else accepting their lot in life and the traditional roles that the society has imposed on them in order for the heroes to make this thing work.
Â 
In any case, your above scenario shows that you need a really complicated and convoluted scenario to justify why Tyrion of all people would be named Dany's or Jon's heir to the Iron Throne. in particular, your scenario comes off as some really unlikely wish fulfillment stuff for Tyrion. (Including the "Tyrion is a Targ" theory.) If you're going to use the "well, GRRM is describing the society the way it is and every character must accept their fate" argument - then let's also accept the fact that that society is extremely prejudiced against disabled people, especially those with congenital disabilities (something that Tyrion's storyline has been all about) and that Tyrion would be the last person they would turn to as a biological father of future heirs to the throne. Your scenario is basically "ways in which Tyrion can get all sorts of awesome stuff and Sansa doesn't get anything she wants". (Well, Tyrion wouldn't get a wife who wants him, but as a man in power, he could still have mistresses.)
Â 

Â 
I see where you are coming from wrt Sansa's arc, but that Sansa has become disillusioned with arranged marriages doesn't have to mean that she will definitely end up avoiding those alltogether. We don't know the mind of the author, and as reader we have certain ideas about the overarching plot for each character but GRRM may have other plans. Sansa's mother entered a political marriage, and I got the impression Catelyn wasn't under any illusions about what was happening.

Â 
Sansa is not Catelyn. The different main characters are actually different people with different motivations, developments and arcs - and that goes for women as well as men. If Sansa is going to end up as a political pawn and an obedient wife in an arranged political marriage, something people have been trying to make her be since book 1, then her entire arc and character development has been a colossal waste of time.
Â 

Â 
Â 
Agency is all well and good, but this is a story about a culture/time/place where it isn't the norm - especially for highborn women - to get much of a say in who they have to marry. Arya is more likely to just be able to chose her husband (or to not enter any marriage at all), because she is living outside the norms of her society.

I can hardly imagine that was a pleasant marriage, but from a political POV apparently it was "succesful". Aegon Targaryen got away with it, unlike Tywin Lannister.

Â 
Again, that's historical background from 300 years ago, not the fate of his main characters. By that logic, Dany should be in favor of slavery, like her forefathers were; in any case, she should not be acting like a revolutionary and freeing slaves. Jon shouldn't have been trying to makeÂ  wildlings a part of the realm. They're going against the norm of culture/time/place. And Tyrion should not hope for any highborn marriage let alone to be chosen as a father of future heirs; he should have been content with taking care of those drains and pipes. If everyone is going to stick to the norm of their culture/time/place, what are we reading the story for? Martin is writing fantasy, not historical fiction. And heck, even in historical fiction, people have proven that they can go against the norm, including women - whether it was choosing to make an inappropriate marriage out of love and ending tragically (Mary Queen of Scots) or choosing to never marry and ending up ruling successfully for years (Elizabeth I).
Â 
Sansa never wanted it, but Tyrion - in books and show - really wanted it to work and tried to make it work. In ADWD, there are signs that Tyrion is irritated that Sansa "wasn't loyal" to him. I'm far from certain that Tyrion would prefer Penny, who probably really wants him, over Sansa. There is an intriguing line in his last ADWD chapter where he mentions that he misses his wife, and the context is deliberately kept vague enough to make it unclear whether he means Sansa or Tysha.
Â 

Â 
Tyrion never wanted it before his father cowed him into accepting it. Before that, he had never considered Sansa that way. When he thought that Sansa was going to be his wife for the rest of his life, that's when he started wanting to 'make it work'. Ironically, contrary to what people like to claim, Sansa was far more rebellious as she never thought she should 'make it work' or 'do her duty' (Tyrion was the one who said: "Come on, Sansa, let's do our duty" on their wedding night, Sansa was only thinking about obeying because she had no choice). He never had any genuine interest in Sansa as a person and was never really able to understand her; she was reading him much better than he was able to read her. He was just physically attracted to her, liked the idea of being the lord of Winterfell, and started fantasizing about her coming willingly to his bed - like Tysha 3.0 - since her lack of desire for him hurt him because of his deep insecurities. And yes, you're right that he probably wouldn't want Penny - just like he didn't want Lollys (who didn't want him like Penny does, but never made clear that she definitely didn't want him, as Sansa did) - because Tyrion is allowed to not marry people he doesn't find sexually attractive (while Sansa did not have that luxury).Â  He didn't want Sansa for herself; he wanted his young, beautiful, virginal trophy wife with a claim to Winterfell to want him. It was pure wish-fulfillment focused on making Tyrion feel better about himself.
Â 
Which is - as far as Tyrion's arc goes - exactly why he didn't get it and is unlikely to ever get it.
Â 
Â 

And by the same reasoning, they would want to prepare the ground for acceptance of an eventual Sansa/Tyrion marriage (and not just a mockery, this time) if they know this as end-game. The show is already under fire for alleged sexism, imagine the uproar in that case if they don't play their cards very carefully.
Â 
I guess they will tone down Tyrion's behaviour in Essos, by the same token. Allthough he is probably going to kill Shae this season.
Â 

Â 
I'd really love to know how you made the logical leap from: "They made Tyrion nicer overall so the audience could have a completely likable main character to invest in" to "And this is why they made Tyrion more likable - so the audience would accept the Sansa/Tyrion marriage; which is evidence that Sansa will end up married to Tyrion"? 
Â 
So, now you're saying that D&D knew from the beginning of the show that there is a Sansa/Tyrion endgame, and that all the changes to Tyrion - whitewashing, as many call it - from day one, was in order to prepare the audience for his all-important Sansa/Tyrion endgame? As evidenced by the fact that... Tyrion is generally nicer? Who would think that the whole purpose of Tyrion's portrayal on the show has been to make him a better match for Sansa! And people were complaining that they were making Sansa a prop in Tyrion's story! 
Â 
The show is already under fire for alleged sexism, imagine the uproar in that case if they don't play their cards very carefully.
Â 

Â 
Oh, I have news for you: if the show ends with that "Sansa/Tyrion endgame", it will be accused of sexism in any case, and rightfully so. If there is this Sansa/Tyrion endgame that the entire show has been preparing for, you know which change they should have made? Not have Sansa forcibly married to Tyrion. If you're changing everything about the characters and their dynamics, then instead of making Shae a genuine love story, make Sansa fall for Tyrion and choose Tyrion on her own. Problem solved.

In any case, your above scenario shows that you need a really complicated and convoluted scenario to justify why Tyrion of all people would be named Dany's or Jon's heir to the Iron Throne.Â 


It's not like the books haven't used complicated and convoluted scenarios before...
Â 
Im curious, who do you think will end up on the throne?
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â If Sansa is going to end up as a political pawn and an obedient wife in an arranged political marriage, something people have been trying to make her be since book 1, then her entire arc and character development has been a colossal waste of time.
In your opinion, and based on your reading of what Sansa's arc is about. You speak about wish fulfillment, but everybody is affected by that. Might it not be present in your wish to see Sansa's arc end the way you imagine and/or want it? Might it not be present in the way many refuse to even consider the Tyrion-as-bastard theory, even though there is about as much textual support for as against that one?Â 
Â 
In any case, Sansa in the last book (assuming she survives -which I think is likely) will be very far from the girl in AGOT.
Â 

Â 
Â 
Which is - as far as Tyrion's arc goes - exactly why he didn't get it and is unlikely to ever get it.
Depends on how important he becomes. It's entirely possible he will end up being one of Dany's three betrayals (for Jaime's sake? defecting to Aegon?) or that he will die before the end. Maybe he will end up with Casterly Rock and nothing more. But in a scenario where he does make it to be king, or at least designated heir, he will need offspring and it's not going to be with a random tavern maid.Â 
Â 
I agree that this is only feasible if Tyrion is supposed to win it all in the end. I don't know the endgame, I don't think you do either. Could well be Tyrion is heading for a deep fall or that he will be more of a support act for Dany and/or Jon. But you asked how it could be possible, and while my scenario may be convoluted it is not impossible. There have been small but tantalising hints that Tyrion may end up as king. And he is Martin's favorite, allthough he also writes him as a villain at times.
Â 

Â 
Â 
I'd really love to know how you made the logical leap from: "They made Tyrion nicer overall so the audience could have a completely likable main character to invest in" to "And this is why they made Tyrion more likable - so the audience would accept the Sansa/Tyrion marriage; which is evidence that Sansa will end up married to Tyrion"?
Â 
There is no logical leap; you misrepresent my argument. I wrote that, IF the showrunners have heard from Martin that the marriage will stand in the end, that they then would have reason to soften the blow for a modern audience by making Tyrion act nicer to Sansa. I agree he was a prick in the books; he threatened her in public (as a show for the sake of Robb Stark, during the negotations) and he made no attempt to warn her beforehand, unlike in the show.Â 
Â 
I never asserted that this is definitely the reason that they made Tyrion act nicer; my statement was conditional on Martin having told them. If not, it's just part of the general theme of making characters nicer than their book counterparts, for example for the reasons you stated.
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â If there is this Sansa/Tyrion endgame that the entire show has been preparing for, you know which change they should have made? Not have Sansa forcibly married to Tyrion. If you're changing everything about the characters and their dynamics, then instead of making Shae a genuine love story, make Sansa fall for Tyrion and choose Tyrion on her own. Problem solved.
D&D are following Martin's outline. If there is a Tyrion/Sansa endgame, it would be because GRRM is planning to write it that way. And since the adaptation is actually quite faithful to the source material (especially considering the difficulties in filming such a massive, epic book series and the real life limitations they have to take into account), they don't make those types of drastic character changes.
Â 
Sure, Tyrion is nicer in the show, but the core character is there and his dark moment at the end of ASOS will likely be there. Similarly, Sansa is not 100% the same but the character of the books is recognisable. There are changes and changes; a complete reversal of a major situation in the books is not going to happen.Â 
Â 
I want to stress that I consider this as a possibility, not something that is definitely going to happen or even something that is likely to happen. I'm just not ruling it out, unlike most. I've considered Tyrion as an outsider for winning the game of throne for quite some time, but this thought does not seem very popular on the forum, to make an understatement.
3598	Annara Snow	2014-05-01	It's not like the books haven't used complicated and convoluted scenarios before...
Â 
Im curious, who do you think will end up on the throne?


Â 
In my opinion? Nobody. I think that the Iron Throne will not exist anymore at the end of the story. Westeros will look very different after the events of the civil war and the invasion of the Others, and I don't know in what shape the Seven Kingdoms will be, but I don't think that they will be the same as before.
Â 
You may say it's what I want to happen, but I can't think of any other satisfying ending. I will be very disappointed if Martin ends the story with Westeros being basically the same as at the beginning of the story, with all the same institutions, and only different players.
Â 
In your opinion, and based on your reading of what Sansa's arc is about. You speak about wish fulfillment, but everybody is affected by that. Might it not be present in your wish to see Sansa's arc end the way you imagine and/or want it?
Â 
No, that's not the same thing at all. The Tyrion scenario you presented would be the equivalent of Loras Tyrell falling for Sansa circa early ASOS, marrying her and taking her to Highgarden where she lives happily, until he and Sansa become king and queen of Westeros through a complicated series of events where every other noble dies and Sansa's distant Targaryen ancestry isÂ  brought up as a reason for her to ascend the throne, and she lives happily ever after, giving birth to future kings, surrounded by adoring people and knights who are begging for her favor. In other words - a most unlikely fulfillment of the most childish and immatureÂ  fantasies that the character has had.
Â 
Your Sansa scenario is the equivalent of Tyrion never getting out of the shadow of his father and doing whatever Tywin tells him for the rest of Tywin's long, successful life.
Â 

Â 
Might it not be present in the way many refuse to even consider the Tyrion-as-bastard theory, even though there is about as much textual support for as against that one?
Â 

Â 
There's very little textual support for the Tyrion-as-bastard theory. There's just evidence that Aerys had a thing for Joanna, and that's it. There's actually more possible evidence for Jaime-and-Cerse-as-Mad-King's-bastards theory (not that I believe that one either, that would make for too many secret Targaryens, but it makes a lot more narrative sense and has much more support than the Tyrion theory).
Â 

Â 
In any case, Sansa in the last book (assuming she survives -which I think is likely) will be very far from the girl in AGOT.

Â 
She already is.
Â 

Â 
I agree that this is only feasible if Tyrion is supposed to win it all in the end. I don't know the endgame, I don't think you do either. Could well be Tyrion is heading for a deep fall or that he will be more of a support act for Dany and/or Jon. But you asked how it could be possible, and while my scenario may be convoluted it is not impossible. There have been small but tantalising hints that Tyrion may end up as king. And he is Martin's favorite, allthough he also writes him as a villain at times.
Â 

Â 
Tyrion being Martin's favorite only makes it more likely that he will get to suffer more, go through a lot of poignant soul-searching, do something really huge and important for the story (that's the only part where I agree with you) and possibly go out in a huge heroic moment, than that he's doing to get some 'happy ending' where he is the king of Westeros and rules happily ever after and fathers lots of little heirs with his trophy wife. (I doubt that GRRM will give that kind of ending to anyone, let alone his favorite character.) "He had everything, the power and the girl" is what Tyrion explicitly thought in ACOK when he was Hand of the King, and we know how that turned out.

Â If there is this Sansa/Tyrion endgame that the entire show has been preparing for, you know which change they should have made? Not have Sansa forcibly married to Tyrion.Â 


Â 
some would say they have. just check out any unsullied thread. the marriage has a much softer and ambiguous start on the show than the books, of that there is no doubt. it may very well be setting up a reconciliation or just be part of the whitewashing of tyrion. however, the fact that the couple was joking around after the marriage right up to the news of the slaughter of her family does support the theory of a future for the two.
3600	Wouter	2014-05-01	Â 
In my opinion? Nobody. I think that the Iron Throne will not exist anymore at the end of the story. Westeros will look very different after the events of the civil war and the invasion of the Others, and I don't know in what shape the Seven Kingdoms will be, but I don't think that they will be the same as before.
Â 
You may say it's what I want to happen, but I can't think of any other satisfying ending. I will be very disappointed if Martin ends the story with Westeros being basically the same as at the beginning of the story, with all the same institutions, and only different players.
Â 
Â 
Â 


Not that I deny there is a possibility there will be no Iron Throne, but if someone does end up gaining it and keeping it till (and beyond) the end, that doesn't necessarily mean that Westeros is basically the same. I can imagine Daenerys doing quite some reforms for example, if she ends up in that position.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
There's very little textual support for the Tyrion-as-bastard theory. There's just evidence that Aerys had a thing for Joanna, and that's it. There's actually more possible evidence for Jaime-and-Cerse-as-Mad-King's-bastards theory (not that I believe that one either, that would make for too many secret Targaryens, but it makes a lot more narrative sense and has much more support than the Tyrion theory).
That's exactly what I mean with the wish-fulfilment; the evidence for both the twins-as-bastards and the Tyrion-as-bastards theories has been collected by dedicated forumers in a few threads over the years, and the number of items in support and against is roughly the same for both...
The principal objection to both theories - opportunity for Aerys to reach Joanna and the apparent lack of action from Tywin to stop it or to Â kill the offspring - are the same, too.Â 
Â 
It makes a lot more narrative sense? That's one viewpoint, but not an objective truth. Tyrion as a Targ bastard makes perfect narrative sense to me and the clues are there right from Tyrion's first chapters in the entire series. Maybe because of the incest and Cersei's fireloving tendencies, many seem to like Jaime and/or Cersei as Targ bastards though, which means that similar clues as Tyrion gets are somehow meaningful for them but never for him.Â 
Â 
Discussion like this are one reason why I am grateful the show is going full steam ahead. The way the plot is moving, we might find out for sure who is right at the end of S5, if TWOW hasn't been published yet by then. It's past time we start getting answers.

than that he's doing to get some 'happy ending' where he is the king of Westeros and rules happily ever after and fathers lots of little heirs with his trophy wife. (I doubt that GRRM will give that kind of ending to anyone, let alone his favorite character.
Some of the surviving characters are going to get a relatively happy ending, unless "bittersweet" is Martinspeak for 90% bitter and 10% sweet. There will be a person in charge of the 7K (or persons in control of parts of it if they split up).Â 
Â 
Besides, in the more likely event that Jon and/or Dany end up on the throne and stay there (with the means to beget a heir), they would have a relatively happy ending, too.Â

Yes, because the belief that a captive who's being forced to marry a member of the family who's been keeping her prisoner and abusing for 1.5 years and who has to be obedient at all time and tell them what they want to hear so they wouldn't kill, beat and abuse her more, is actually willingly going into the marriage because she's not screaming throughout the ceremony, even though she is obviously completely miserable, is a totally legitimate, intelligent and potentially correct opinion.
Â 
And because it was so, so difficult to figure out that it was a forced marriage from what was shown on screen. It's not like it was blatantly obvious even in the whitewashed TV version... except it really,Â  really was.
Â 
And I love how you assume that those people that you've seen say that are representative of all the Unsullied in general. Sorry, I guess I just have a much higher opinion of the TV audiences than you do. I'm pretty sure that those people you talk about are a tiny minority. I even know Unsullied who have figured out that Ned is not really Jon's father, let alone understanding the blatantly obvious plot elements.

Uuum, it's not about what might or might not happen. It's about what's already happened. I was talking with CERTAINTY about something that's already happened and that EVERYONE knows has happened.

Â 
I'm sorry, no, not all opinions are equally valid. If someone told me that the character played by Lupita N'yongo in 12 Years a Slave was not being raped because she didn't scream or struggle, I'm going to say that they're not very intelligent... as a nice way to saying they're incredibly stupid.

Yes, I prefer the "unintelligent" phrasing as opposed to the "stupid" phrasing myself. It's a much gentler way of saying, 'You're a farking idiot.' So, I feel you on that one.Â 
Â 
My original point, however,Â  is that people's speculations about FUTURE events/relationships does not make them "stupid". How do we know her relationship with Tyrion DOESN'T develop into something more significant in the future? How do we know Brienne doesn't find her in Season 5 and ship her off to Essos to "protect" her (thus creating the opportunity for that relationship to develop)? Hell, how do we know ANYTHING about what happens? Pretty soon, all we're going to have are speculations about Sansa because the show is a couple of episodes away from hitting the end of the line with her. ANYTHING could happen at this point, and it's because of that fact that I reject the notion that certain things couldn't happen, or that people are 'unintelligent' for even thinking them.
Â 
As an aside, I thought Sophie Turner's quote was interesting. Granted, it was also confusing as hell considering the fact that it does not coincide with the realities of either the show or the books (as they stand RIGHT NOW). But well, honestly, I chalked it up to her knowing something we don't know yet. OR...perhaps we're reading too much into the quote. I mean, as it stands right now, Sansa thinks her whole family is dead. So...why WOULDN'T Tyrion be the "most important" relationship to her? Hell, technically, its the only one she HAS right now.
Â 
In the end, I think ANYTHING is possible. Truly, anything. And I think its dangerous for any of us to strongly subscribe to this or that theory and then have our hearts broken when and if it doesn't happen. At this point--or at least, very soon--we're ALL going to be speculators to Sansa's storyline, which puts ALL of our theories on equal ground. Â

I know what DID happen in the show and in books, which is what the argument was about, that the marriage supposed wasn't forced in the show because some Unsullied supposed thought it wasn't. *facepalm*
Sophie "quote" is actually a poster quoting a translation of an interview in Spanish, which was a translation in itself unless she actually talked in Spanish, so instead of provoking crackpottery, it should be taken with a huge grain of salt. Especially since it contradicts everything she has ever said in every other interview. It's much more likely that she meant "one of the most important relationships for my character" rather than "one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones - especially for my character" (why even add that, if their relationship is so super important for everything, surely it goes without saying that it would  be important for one of the people involved? Or does she have several relationships that are also among the most important in the show overall? She never said Tyrion was the most important relationship/person for her, that's just what I postulated would have to be the case if their relationship is really one of the most important ones in the entire show...It's not like they are the only characters in the show. Or how many most important relationships are there, anyway? Five? Ten? Twenty? Fifty?)
Or, if you take that quote as correct and take it literally, then you would have to believe that Sansa/Tyrion has as much or more narrative significance for the story as Jaime/Cersei or Tyrion/Tywin, for instance. You decide which one is more likely.

Oh and BTW,  weren't you the one who argued in another thread that the casting of a 40-something actor as Sandor is a proof that nothing romantic will ever happen between him and Sansa?

Â 
Now, I have to say Sansa in the role of "the good wife" (and now my parallel is CBS's Alicia Florrick) is an interesting concept. I am not thinking about being trapped in loveless marriage, but empowerment through the independence she earned by fighting for it. One of the most brilliant moments on TV I have seen in quite some time is when "the good wife" says to her husband that they are not all they have. Current dynamics between married couple in "the good wife" isn't something I would wish for Sansa, but we might see some bits of it. I don't believe it is an endgame for the two of them, but perhaps one of the steps to the resolution of their marriage. For I do agree that, as the endgame, this marriage isn't quite happy solution in narrative sense. Simply, it goes against Sansa's story, well if not in general, but certainly in AFFC, and Tyrion's in ADWD.

Â because Tyrion is allowed to not marry people he doesn't find sexually attractive (while Sansa did not have that luxury).

So you think that, if Sansa was ugly, Tywin Lannister wouldn't have ordered Tyrion to marry her? Tywin had serious reasons to marry Tyrion and Sansa - giving Tyrion a new sex toy was not one of the reasons.

Â 
No, but Tyrion had the option of refusing to marry Sansa or refusing to marry Lollys or refusing to marry either (Tywin wouldn't have liked it, but Tyrion was not being threatened with beatings, rape or death). Guess which one he categorically refused and which one he eventually accepted?
Â 
I'm also referring to the fandom's reactions. I don't see people going on about how "shallow" Tyrion was for saying he'd rather have his dick cut off than marry Lollys. Nobody seems to think that he is obliged to return Penny's affections in order to be deemed a non-hateful, non-shallow, non-stupid character. On the other hand, there's a "why was Sansa not nicer to Tyrion/why didn't Sansa spread her legs to Tyrion/when will Sansa learn to appreciate Tyrion's inner beauty and spread her legs for him?" thread every month.

How about we all just keep an open mind about the future, where ever it leads. 


Â 
Spanish isn't hard to translate to English and vice versa, not are the majority of other languages, but people still translate things badly all the time. And when there's a translation of the translation, things are particularly likely to get lost in translation. Add to this the fact that, unless it's a video of Sophie talking in Spanish (there's no link provided so I don't even know what it is, though I'm guessing it's probably an article), it's actually an interviewer transcribing her words and translating them into Spanish (before someone else read it and translated it in English). Furthermore, it hasn't even been clarified if a person did the translation of the Spanish text, and if so, who did it; or if it was a Google translation (and oh gods, when you use computer translations, funny things can happen...).
Â 
So, how about we at least see the original interview (well, not really original, since it must have been translated from English in the first place)? Or how about we don't use "the quote as stated" since it's not the actual quote, but a poster quoting a translation of a translation (probably of a transcription)?
Â 
The reasons I think there's something "wrong" with the "quote" is:
1) it's not actually a quote (see above)
2) it makes no sense, especially considering the way it's worded. (Why add "especially for my character" if you've already stated that it's one of the most important relationships in a show with some 30 main characters?)
Â 
"Because you don't like the implications"? What would those implications be? Please explain, I asked and I didn't get the answer. If you actually believe that Sophie was implying that Sansa/Tyrion is one of the most important relationships in the show (one of how many? Five? Ten? Two? Three?), tell me how would that be. Are they going to be Azor Ahai reborn and Nissa Nissa? Is the final battle going to be between Sansa and Tyrion leading the opposing forces? Please tell me what you think this "implication" is.
Â 
Or are you're trying to tell me that this means that Sansa and Tyrion would end up living their whole life in a political marriage, as Wouter suggests? Sorry, but that still wouldn't make it "one of the most important relationships in the show". Unless an entire season is devoted to them living together and having babies.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Once again, NO theory is "crackpot".

Â 
The majority of the forum disagrees with you, since everyone is using the word "crackpot". Maybe you should petition for the word to be abolished?
Â 

Â 
Your "absolutist" way of arguing things (and your consequent belittling of those who disagree) is what I'M arguing against. How about we all just keep an open mind about the future, where ever it leads. 

Â 
You mean, like your absolutist way of arguing that a poster's English language quote of an interview in Spanish that we haven't even gotten to read and that was probably originally transcribed and translated from a recording of an actress speaking in English is absolutely correct and should be taken as gospel truth? Even though its own wording contradicts itself?
Â 
ETA: And what on Earth makes you think that "third world languages" should be harder to translate from?
Â 
ETA2: Oh and BTW, I used Google translations to translate your post into Spanish and into English again, just for fun. Her is what I got:
Â 

Â 
I'm not sure why you think that is difficult to translate Spanish to English or vice versa. Spanish is not a third world obscure language that is "hard" to translate in a way that captures the exact intent of the original appointment. <_ <So, what if we made the appointment as its declared and stop thinking of something "wrong" with him because you do not like the implications.
Â Again, the theory "nutty". Nobody knows what will happen, so nothing should be taken off the table. His "absolutist" way to discuss things (and consequent contempt for those who disagree) is what I'm arguing against. What if we all just keep an open mind about the future, which takes forever.

3616	Newstar	2014-05-02	I can see her saying that it's one of the most important relationships for Sansa, but "one of the most important relationships in GoT" as a whole? That makes no sense from anything seen in the books or in the show - especially considering the fact that it also goes against everything she's said in every other interview; just going by her interviews, she's singled out Margaery, not Tyrion, as her biggest influence in KL in becoming a 'player' (Tyrion got mentioned, but only as one of the people in KL she observed and 'soaked' things from, together with Cersei and Margaery), and she's also categorically ruled out the possibility of Sansa developing any genuine romantic interest in Tyrion in every interview (and made a face to express how she or Sansa feels about the marriage in general), so how exactly would Tyrion become the most important relationship in her story, trumping her parents, her siblings, anyone she has or will have romantic interest in, Littlefinger, Joffrey, Cersei, Sweetrobin, anyone else she will get to interact while she's in Vale in near future... or how is Sansa going to become the most important, or one of the most important relationships in Tyron's story, trumping Tywin, Cersei, Jaime, Tysha, Shae, anyone he does or will interact in Essos...? Especially since they aren't even likely to meet again until late in Winds of Winter.Â  Even in the unlikely outcome that they end up ruling Westeros together, that still wouldn't be the case.Hey, I agree with you; it seems like a weird quote, especially given Sophie Turner's other interviews. That's precisely why it jumped out at me (well, that, and Alex Graves' revelation that he's been spoiling the actors on post-ADWD material). Whether the interviewer misquoted her is something I can't speak to, but I can say that the Spanish magazine quote is pretty easily translated:
"Este es su unico y verdadero amigo, es el unico que ha sido honesto con ella. Bueno, tiene a Shae pero no es del todo sincera con ella. En Tyrion podria confiar completamente, si ella quisiera. Esta es una de las relaciones mas importantes dentro de "Juego de tronos," especialmente para mi personaje."
You don't even need to speak Spanish to translate that last bit, but I will;
"It's one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones, especially for my character."
If you take out the comma and the "especialmente" (particularly), THEN the meaning becomes "It's one of the most important relationships in GOT for my character." Just as it would in English, the "especialmente" (particularly or especially) changes the meaning to Sansa and Tyrion's relationship being one of the most important in GOT and particularly so for Sansa.
The magazine is called Vanidad, and the interview appeared in the April issue. Scans are at kopacharmer.blogspot.com (March 28th, 2014 entry).

So how come you're not arguing that the casting of 40-something Peter Dinklage as Tyrion is a proof he won't have any "future" with Sansa? You're very inconsistent!


Â 
actually i said that there are several unsullied who had positive things to say about the on screen interactions of the two. it helps to keep the sources straight when discussing consistency. in any case, you have your views on both these characters and their future and others have theirs. that's what i've said in this thread. but thanks for keeping my comments from other threads in mind. that's quite nice of you.Â

No, but Tyrion had the option of refusing to marry Sansa or refusing to marry Lollys or refusing to marry either (Tywin wouldn't have liked it, but Tyrion was not being threatened with beatings, rape or death).Â 


Are you sure? Tywin disowned his favourite son, Jaime, for disobeying him. Maybe he would not directly kill Tyrion, but if he sent him away, how long would Tyrion have survived with no money and no protection? Being a dwarf is quite a dangeros condition in Westeros, especially when you are Tyrion Lannister an did your best to collect a good number of enemies

3619	Woman of War	2014-05-03	No, but Tyrion had the option of refusing to marry Sansa or refusing to marry Lollys or refusing to marry either (Tywin wouldn't have liked it, but Tyrion was not being threatened with beatings, rape or death).Obviously the author wanted to link the story of Tyrion and Sansa, that's why he constructed a situation where these two got married. The plot had to be constructed the way that this event became possible while the characters concerned had to present themselves within the frame of that plot development. Plot first, characters second but fortunately Martin delivered a masterpiece of writing here in using the plot event - marriage - for a brilliant character desription of both protagonists.
If Tyrion should have followed your moral suggestions and refused to marry Sansa - how should Martin have brought T and S into one marriage vow? He could have kept Tyrion's moral integrity upright by having him beaten to bloody pulp by Tywin's men and thrown the unconscious Tyrion before the altar, for everyone to see the shame of House Lannister.
Martin wanted Tyrion and Sansa to get married but the scenario above is an unthinkable one given the dynamics of Tywin and his children. So the author had to write it that way that Tyrion, especially in the series, saw no way out even without direct physical force. So it is a bit difficult to hold something against a character if there was virtually no other turn possible within the desired story logic. Martin could not give Tyrion a way out, the character of Tyrion was doomed to marry Sansa, just as Sansa was doomed to marry Tyrion. The author wanted this to happen and he made it possible.

Â 
Yes we are sure that he hasn't been threatened. Jaime hasn't been disowned by Tywin, Jaime disowned himself when he chose KG. Tyrion was not ordered to marry Sansa. He had choices, options, ability to say no. As we have seen, there were other Lannisters in game. Arguing that Tyrion would have been dead if he refused to marry Sansa, is IMO, a bit too over-reaching.
Â 
Â 


I'm also referring to the fandom's reactions. I don't see people going on about how "shallow" Tyrion was for saying he'd rather have his dick cut off than marry Lollys. Nobody seems to think that he is obliged to return Penny's affections in order to be deemed a non-hateful, non-shallow, non-stupid character. On the other hand, there's a "why was Sansa not nicer to Tyrion/why didn't Sansa spread her legs to Tyrion/when will Sansa learn to appreciate Tyrion's inner beauty and spread her legs for him?" thread every month.


Â 
I agree with this...

Annara, I am sorry, but I also don't see what has been lost in translation here. Sophie could be wrong, and also she can be completely right, we don't know that. I can argue based on what I know from books, not based on some idea that someone might have told someone what happens next. My conclusion that she is wrong is based on what we have in the books thus far, and I believe that according to everything we know and everything is foreshadowed and can be logically concluded, Sophie is wrong, but as others pointed out she might have some information we don't. Therefore, I wouldn't crack my head about this, since there are too many ways this could be interpreted.
3621	joachim	2014-05-03	The look on her face was she's creeped, but also ahhhh now I know one thing he wants, I think at that point she remembered Shaes words to her about LF.


Same here. She was thinking, "Oh shift, Shae was right."
3622	juanml82	2014-05-03	Hey, I agree with you; it seems like a weird quote, especially given Sophie Turner's other interviews. That's precisely why it jumped out at me (well, that, and Alex Graves' revelation that he's been spoiling the actors on post-ADWD material). Whether the interviewer misquoted her is something I can't speak to, but I can say that the Spanish magazine quote is pretty easily translated:
"Este es su unico y verdadero amigo, es el unico que ha sido honesto con ella. Bueno, tiene a Shae pero no es del todo sincera con ella. En Tyrion podria confiar completamente, si ella quisiera. Esta es una de las relaciones mas importantes dentro de "Juego de tronos," especialmente para mi personaje."
You don't even need to speak Spanish to translate that last bit, but I will;
"It's one of the most important relationships in Game of Thrones, especially for my character."
If you take out the comma and the "especialmente" (particularly), THEN the meaning becomes "It's one of the most important relationships in GOT for my character." Just as it would in English, the "especialmente" (particularly or especially) changes the meaning to Sansa and Tyrion's relationship being one of the most important in GOT and particularly so for Sansa.
The magazine is called Vanidad, and the interview appeared in the April issue. Scans are at kopacharmer.blogspot.com (March 28th, 2014 entry).


Well, the thing is, Show!Sansa can fully trust Tyrion because she doesn't have any secrets (well, she wanted Robb to win and kill Joffrey, but Tyrion knew that already). Book!Sansa is secretly planning her escape, so even if she was willing to trust him (she isn't, and as far she knows, for good reasons) there are things in which she can't possibly trust him
3623	Newstar	2014-05-04	Same here. She was thinking, "Oh shift, Shae was right."


Â 
Never gets old, LOL.
3624	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-05-04	I'm really happy show Sansa is stepping up and i hope they do the rest of her arc some justice. But that line is quite illuminating if you will or it could just bethast Tyrion thinks Sansa has been through so much why not become a killer eventually it could've been very innocent but at the same time w/ all the deviations that took place in this episode who knows
3625	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-04	Â

I disagree with this. Jaime choosing the KG gave up his claim on Casterly Rock, but â<U+0080><U+009C>You are not my sonâ<U+0080><U+009D> goes far beyond that, Tywin formally disowned him and rejected him as a son/member of the family. And he was the favourite son, so we can safely assume he would not think twice to disown Tyrion (whom he always despised) or send him wherever the whores go.

Â 
You mean after Jaime chose KG after the second time. Not to mention that GRRM himself told that Jaime was never meant to inherit Casterly Rock and that it was Tyrion's all along, and that Tywin was a bit delusional about inheritance laws. Tywin was genuinely hurt by Jaime's rejection, but he didn't disown him, because there was nothing to disown him of, Jaime already made his choice. As for formality, let we not assume that every word uttered from the mouth of the character is formality. All along it was Jaime's choice and as Cersei told him, if he went to Tywin, he would have changed his decision.

Therefore, I wouldn't crack my head about this, since there are too many ways this could be interpreted.

Â 
Or, you know, she may have simply been trying to say that it's one of the most important relationships for her character in the show (which makes sense, as he's been one of the people she was interacting the most in KL), rather than that it's one of the most important relationships in the show overall (which makes considerably less sense)? Especially with the added "...especially for my character". No one has yet managed to explain why she would state that it's one of the most important relationships in the show and then add that. There are some 30 major characters in the show, surely if a relationship is supposedly so important that it trumps most of the relationships that other people have, then it has to be important to one of the two people involved? Why the need to emphasize that?
Â 
And frankly. I'm surprised that no one so far has brought up the logical assumption that, if she actually had some super important secret information about major upcoming plot points that would somehow make Tyrion and Sansa the super couple of the show who end up as one of the show's most important duos or whatever, she wouldn't be trying to reveal that in an interview. She was being super cagey in all her interviews before the start of season 4 about the fact that she wouldn't stay in KL for long, but now we think that she's spoiling future seasons in the same breath?
Â 
Considering the fact that she most probably was not speaking in Spanish so her words were transcribed and translated in the first place, a lot could have been lost in translation, even if we assume that she expressed herself perfectly in conversation with the interviewer (as if we all do that 100% of the time...).

Being a dwarf is quite a dangeros condition in Westeros, especially when you are Tyrion Lannister an did your best to collect a good number of enemies


Â 
And what happened to Jaime when Tywin told him "You are not my son"? Did he lose his position at court as Lord Commander of KG? Did he need to go away?
Â 
And Tywin was offering Tyrion the option of marrying daughters of minor nobility, too.
Â 
There's no doubt that Tywin had a lot of psychological power over his children, especially Cersei and Tyrion (less so over Jaime), but I don't think that they were in physical danger. When it comes to their social position, it's debatable. They all know they owe a lot of the power of their house, and therefore their own, to Tywin's authority and reputation, but would he really go that far to send any of them away, when it would hurt the family's interests and reputation? Cersei especially should have no reason to give in so easily, Tywin can't just decide to punish the queen regent for disobeying him - but she still gives in.
Â 
Â

Â 
I'm not quite following you there. We can't say "well, the character A did this and this because the author needed it for the plot.". Sure, that's why characters do the things they do, but in that case, there would be no point in discussing characters at all. We would just say: "You can't judge Jaime for pushing Bran/Lysa for poisoning Jon and framing the Lannisters/Walder Frey for organizing the Red Wedding/you can't praise Jaime for sending Brienne to find Sansa/Stannis for coming to the rescue of the NW/Tyrion for saving Jorah, because it was needed for the plot". It would mean that characters are all nothing but plot devices and that their characterization doesn't matter at all and is something that the author can change any time he wants. Sure, that can happen, but it makes for very bad writing.

3629	CaptainTheo	2014-05-04	About the wedding ring - I noticed Sansa actually does take it off at least once, as she isn't wearing it when she gets out of bed the morning after she marries Tyrion. This might be a pointless observation admittedly, simply that she takes it off when sleeping. I really hope that they don't drop the bit about Sansa pretending to be Alayne. It would be a real shame to omit this, as I find this alter-ego fascinating, like just about everything else in Sansa's storyline.

Seems like a weird image. It seems like Sophie Turner's in character as Sansa--her hands demurely folded just so--which would point to a deleted moment, and she's definitely dressed as she is in 4x05, but sitting on the lip to the Moon Door?

3638	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-02	Compare this episode to the same number last series 03.04 and there is no comparison Dany's first liberation with all the unsullied joining her army, Arya and the brothers without banners and the hound. Theon torture scenes. Varys tells the story of losing his balls. And Mutiny at crasters keep. Man that episode was awesome. 04.04 well.... nothing much happened and it was basically just setting up some new story lines. A disappointing episode. When we all have our complete box sets and we want to watch one stand alone episode I highly doubt that the one we pick will be oathkeeper.
Â 
More people watching only means that the series as a whole is picking up more viewers. I don't think it says much to the quality of the individual episode.
3639	daCGIdragonsareAERODYNAMIC	2014-05-02	My guess when ratings are high for an episode is that the previous episode was a killer... and it was, especially the last scene, lots of viewers found that epic. Doesn't speak to the quality of the actual episode, though, so we might see the ratings go down for next ep. Who knows?
3640	Newstar	2014-05-02	I thought it was the firestorm of controversy that happened after the rape scene in 4x03 that might have resulted in the viewership bump. A lot of free publicity for the show right there.
Â 
I am a little surprised that the highest-rated episode was not the episode after 4x02 (the PW) but rather 4x03. The ratings bump after 4x03 (460,000) was significantly higher than the ratings bump after 4x02 (280,000), impressive in of itself.
Â 
It will be interesting to see if the show sustains or even tops these ratings later in the season. The numbers in past season have typically climbed on average throughout the season as it airs (although GOT maxed out in Season 3 with 3x06 and took a big ratings hit afterwards, to climb up to the similar levels by the finale). I bet 4x10's going to have some pretty gangbusters numbers.

It was not disappointing- it was a very solid episode of the show, with many incredible scenes like the last one and all the Jaime scenes. Yes, it was slightly worse (still top 10 worthy so far, though), but that's because every episode in Season 4 has been amazing, whereas the Season 3 had 3 average episodes (DWDW is probably the 2nd worst Thrones episode after the Night Lands) that built up to And Now His Watch Is Ended. Even then, The Lion and the Rose was equal to the 03.04.Â 
Â 
So no, while it has nothing to do with the quality of individual episodes, it does have something to do with the quality of the overall season so far- people are obviously enjoying it immensely.

Â 
You're right about the ratings climbing as the season progresses. I think a lot of viewers (Unsullied type) may not even watch the first couple of episodes with a 'wait and see' attitude especially with how the last season ended for many. There were a lot of rage-quit posts, reviews, etc that I saw so it's entirely possible the fans are creeping back in slowly because this season is turning out to be pretty amazing. Every single episode has had some jaw dropping moments and revelations for viewers. Once they watched Joffrey die - enthusiasm rebounded full force and the fallout from the red wedding has recovered / re-stabilized. People now have something to cheer about which they desperately wanted. The story is getting super good for Arya, Dany, Jon, all the fan favorites. This season will probably have the highest ratings overall for sure.

I agree 4x10 could have huge numbers. The last 3 episodes are setting up to be the best stretch in the series to date. After viewers see oberyn vs the mountain, the battle at the wall with Stannis saving the day, possibly only cat, amongst other crazy plot changing moments I'm sure they will be dying to tune in for the finale. Then the finale will possibly be even bigger than the previous episodes and I think it will have viewers interest really peaking for season 5. Jeez just talking about it gets me so excited for those last 3 episodes.Â

Welp it is of course entirely subjective opinion. A lot of it is going to be with which characters you like and stuff like that. For example If someone was a Tyrion fan they might be disappointed that he only had one minor scene. If like me you're an Arya fan you'll be disappointed that she had 0 scenes. However, I couldn't disagree more about this series so far I think this has been the worst series. But that's ok still a lot more to go, I'm not worried yet next episode will probably be killer.
Â 
This was posted in another thread which articulates most of my views better than I can. http://towerofthehan...eper/index.html
Â 
This series as a whole has been slow. But then again it kind of has to be. Story arcs have to peak and then dip. After the Red wedding and then the purple wedding which itself could have been a season finale. There has to be time for new plots to be built. and gain momentum unfortunately they have done this better in previous seasons where different story lines peaked at different times.so you might have a 'filler' episode which built other major story lines but you would have a minor plot line peaking in the meantime. Unfortunately this episode was entirely comprised of 'filler'.
Â 
I think this says it all
Â 
From the link I posted
Â 
[spolier]Okay, That Scene: The idea that Craster's sons, left out in the cold as offerings to the Others, have become white walkers themselves is not exactly a new one; in A Storm of Swords, Sam is told as much by Craster's wives before fleeing the keep with Gilly. As a result, I don't consider the final scene a spoiler for the next book, regardless of how significant the credited name of "Night's King" turns out to be. That's a discussion in which I have little interest in participating, at least until it's actually relevant.
I am interested in wondering what business that scene had in taking up precious screen time. Was it thrown in because the writers felt they needed a strong ending? I'll admit that it was creepy and visually compelling, and when that baby's eyes went blue I felt a definite chill go down my spine. That's great; it only lasted for a few seconds before I asked where that scene could be going in the near future, and answered myself, "Nowhere, really." Does anyone think Season 4 is going to start spending significant amounts of time with the white walkers in their ice fortress, watching the evil baby learn to walk? After the initial, superficial thrill of horror wears off, this week's closing scene reveals itself as the laziest trick of all; a cheap, cynical shock ploy that says nothing and means nothing aside from expressing the writers' desperate desire for continued viewership. In terms of endings followed by silent credits, it wasn't exactly the Red Wedding.[/spoiler]
3649	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-03	My guess when ratings are high for an episode is that the previous episode was a killer... and it was, especially the last scene, lots of viewers found that epic. Doesn't speak to the quality of the actual episode, though, so we might see the ratings go down for next ep. Who knows? 


Â 
Doubt it. A lot of non-readers are pretty hyped about the White Walkers finally getting some screentime again. Plus the Tyrion, Jon Snow/Bran storylines are getting pretty juicy.
3650	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-03	Highest rated as in 'most viewers', not as in 'most highly reviewed'.
Â 
There's a difference between "good" and "memorable" - especially when it comes to GoT. Â I thought many Season 3 episodes sucked out loud until they came to the final scenes, which were often extremely memorable. Â Does 45 minutes of absolute garbage followed by 5 minutes of complete awesomeness make a 'good' episode? Â I dunno...
Â 
3.09 was both amazing and memorable. Â 4.04 was good but pretty forgettable. Â
3651	Newstar	2014-05-03	I'll be curious about the ratings for the all-Wall episode in 4x09. It will be a good measure of how popular that particular storyline is with the TV viewership.

Â 
This side of the story has garnered a lot of interest this season. The Jon/Ygritte stuff, the Wildlings, Craster's, and now the White Walkers. It's the main spotlight along with the trial in KL, which makes me happy because it's my favorite part of the books and it's gotten fucked over since S2.

3653	Frey Pies	2014-05-03	Welp it is of course entirely subjective opinion. A lot of it is going to be with which characters you like and stuff like that. For example If someone was a Tyrion fan they might be disappointed that he only had one minor scene. If like me you're an Arya fan you'll be disappointed that she had 0 scenes. However, I couldn't disagree more about this series so far I think this has been the worst series. But that's ok still a lot more to go, I'm not worried yet next episode will probably be killer.
Â 
This was posted in another thread which articulates most of my views better than I can. http://towerofthehan...eper/index.html
Â 
This series as a whole has been slow. But then again it kind of has to be. Story arcs have to peak and then dip. After the Red wedding and then the purple wedding which itself could have been a season finale. There has to be time for new plots to be built. and gain momentum unfortunately they have done this better in previous seasons where different story lines peaked at different times.so you might have a 'filler' episode which built other major story lines but you would have a minor plot line peaking in the meantime. Unfortunately this episode was entirely comprised of 'filler'.


Â 
I understand and respect that you might not like it, but, from what I've seen on the message boards and in real life, the overwhelming response has been extremely positive. I've heard people comment that this season has been faster paced than any other season. You may be bored by Dany conquering the slave cities, many people aren't, and the two scenes of her in Breaker of Chains and Oathkeeper were extremely well done. After a long time, Bran is having interesting scenes and is involved in the action, making him relevant for the first time since 2. Also, the storyline in the north has been better than ever, and, of course, we have witnessed the glorious purple wedding, white walker scene, and the fight in the pubs.
Â 
No story arc should peak at the very beginning of the season (it happened to Dany last season, and the entire arc ended on whimper). However, there have been many minor peaks, and I think they've handled those incredibly well this season. First, we had a King's Landing climax in Episode 2, then a Danaerys one in Episode 3/4, and it looks like we're getting a Bran/Jon one in Episode 5. In my opinion, they are very well spaced out.

3654	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-04	Wow. I wonder if the show will sustain this amount of watchers.Â
3655	Adhara	2014-05-10	It would seen there are contingency plans in the feeding ofÂ newborn magic babies.
That's a load off my mind.
Â 
Oh, I hope we get to see filler of giant white walker breastesses,Â moms feeding the little tyke their ice-milk.
Can't have plot holes left unfilled for unsullied to fall in to.
3656	Envie	2014-05-10	I imagine if care and feeding of baby White Walkers was an issue, they'd just wait for the little guys to be weaned before taking them. I don't think they need to eat anymore...Â
3657	unrecorded	2014-04-28	Don't know if anyone pointed this out yet but I am thinking that Locke will be the person to stab Jon when the time comes. What you think?
3658	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	i was thinking the same thing. i don't think we've seen bowen marsh since the 1st season so I could see it happening
3659	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-28	i was thinking the same thing. i don't think we've seen bowen marsh since the 1st season so I could see it happening


Â 
Marsh is there.
3660	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	I thought the same, but it would be so lame. The cool thing about it being Marsh is that he kinda/sorta has a point, while Locke would be doing it because he's evil and he follows Roose's orders
3661	Mad Monkey	2014-04-28	I think Jon and Locke will have many future scenes where they discuss government with the consent of the governed, natural law, and the social contract.
3662	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	I think Jon and Locke will have many future scenes where they discuss government with the consent of the governed, natural law, and the social contract.

Or they'll shout, "Don't tell me I can't do!"
3663	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	Â 
Marsh is there.


has he been there this season? if he has i haven't noticed.
3664	Gertrude	2014-04-28	I don't think so. Like Jon above me said, it loses something if it's from an enemy rather than a brother. Also, to keep Locke around for so long doing nothing about taking care of Jon Snow makes him look ineffectual. It would get really boring having him hang out and do Â ... nothing until the time comes seasons (a season?) from now.
Â 
I think he will try to get to Jon during the battle at the Wall and won't succeed. My fervent hope is that Ygritte's arrow takes him as he gets close to Jon.
3665	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-28	has he been there this season? if he has i haven't noticed.


Â 
I didn't notice either but he's there. He was -I think- in the scene when Jon is judged.
3666	King Tommen	2014-04-28	Marsh has not been there and this has been corrected by Bryan Cogman. In the first season the actor Brian Fortune was at the Wall and played a featured extra role that was never officially named anything more than "Night Watchman" but he had a couple lines and did a few things that you could easily construe as being Bowen Marsh so the Game of Thrones wiki site took it upon themselves to name him Marsh even though HBO never officially listed Fortune that way.

To add to the confusion, Fortune started appearing again this season in the background (he's the guy helping Maester Aemon down the steps at Jon's "trial"). So again, the wiki guys said that Bowen Marsh was back. Cogman replied at Wic.net by saying that it had been determined that Fortune was officially playing Othell Yarwyck (a builder, not a steward). Yarwyck in the books is one of the guys not happy with Jon's leadership and eventually turns on him but he's definitely not the main antagonist the way Bowen Marsh is. Fortune is not really that accomplished of an actor and was probably just meant to be there as a featured extra with a line here and there.Â  The Bowen Marsh role is important and will either be cast in S5 or his actions will be taken up by someone already in the cast.
3667	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	Â 
I didn't notice either but he's there. He was -I think- in the scene when Jon is judged.


o ok i think your right it's that dude who helps aemon walk.
3668	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-29	I'm wondering if they might become slightly fire-forged friends--emphasis on the slightly, mostly because of the Wildling attack (and Locke standing in the background during the "tonight we fight!" trailer clip). Locke can be all "d'awww he's like a fluffy sweet puppy version of my lord's bastard." I'm so curious about what will happen at Crasters re: Bran and Jon. That will determine a lot.Â 

					
					
							Edited by PhoenixFlame, 29 April 2014 - 12:19 AM.
3669	King Tommen	2014-04-29	I could definitely see Locke developing conflicting notions about what he's supposed to do for Roose the longer he spends time at the Wall with Jon. He seems affable enough and has a connection with Jon almost immediately (although he's putting on a front for now to get in his good graces).
Â 
My money is on him becoming Jon's right hand at the Wall after he becomes LC and taking on many of the Bowen Marsh actions in the following seasons. Obviously, the dynamic would be different because he wouldn't be the old-guard established NW man that Marsh is but you would be able to keep the audience on their toes about just exactly where his loyalties lie which could be interesting. And when his buddy Ramsay sends the goading letter to Jon, that's where you'll see what his true colors are.
Â 
Really, anything that keeps Noah Taylor around is fine with me. That guy is awesome.
3670	Ser Theodan the True	2014-04-29	Locke will stab Jon
3671	Tankbuster	2014-04-29	And while doing that he will shoutÂ 
Â 
"For the watch lolz."
3672	Gertrude	2014-04-29	I don't see Locke turning around. He's the bastard that cut off Jaime's hand for being smug and arrogant. He's the one who was buddying up to Ramsey and sharing torture stories. Sorry, I don't see him softening towards Jon.
3673	Lonnie Smith Jr	2014-04-29	Jon Snow didnt go to Crasters in the book right? How do you think the show will play this out Bran in suppose to be Underground somewhere with the Children of the Forest.

I really hope nothing like that happens. Contrived moments like that are just awful.
Â 
If the right moment doesn't arise before Jon is made LC, I think it makes sense for Locke to fade into the background a bit and bide his time before playing a role in the stabbing. The show can still emphasise the fact that Jon's brothers have decided to turn against him.
3676	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	It's very possible that he'll abandon the ranging and go looking for Bran. Bran is more of a priority to him than Jon.
Â 
And the person behind Thorne when he says "tonight we fight" isn't Locke, it's just an extra with a goatee. He doesn't have the same scars or face or anything.
3677	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-29	I think Jon and Locke will have many future scenes where they discuss government with the consent of the governed, natural law, and the social contract.


Â 
Nice.
3678	LROSyke	2014-04-29	I forgot that we had seen Locke in an earlier episode this season. 
Strange things are afoot.
3679	Envie	2014-04-29	I think it's entirely possible that if Locke's real motivations aren't discovered at Craster's (they don't find Bran and crew) then he could go back to become the antagonist in Jon's stabbing. I can't really see a motivation for Locke though other than wanting to prevent another Stark taking reign.
3680	averde	2014-04-29	No, Bowen Marsh kills Jon for totally different reasons then Locke would, it would change so many things about the story at the wall. 
Besides that point it looks fairly likely that Locke is going to die in whatever happens at Crasters since he's sent by Bolton to "find those two boys" and we know Brans there and stuff. Locke has no reason to stay around for the time it would take to get to Jons assassination. I thought it was made pretty clear in the show, I don't understand where people made this Marsh- Locke connection at all.
3681	SteveVenezia	2014-04-29	I can see Locke running off with Bran during the confusion of the attack, only to be run down by Coldhands on his elk. That way Bran and Jon would never meet despite being so close, and it would be a more dramatic entrance for Coldhands who could then have some sort of interaction with the Night's King & Friends.Â
3682	Solanna	2014-04-29	I think the sound of shrieking crows at Craster's keep was foreboding of Coldhand's entrance there. Think he comes to get Bran from there.
3683	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-29	i was thinking the same thing. i don't think we've seen bowen marsh since the 1st season so I could see it happening


Marsh was beside Slynt and Thorne in the trial scene i think.
3684	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	I think the sound of shrieking crows at Craster's keep was foreboding of Coldhand's entrance there. Think he comes to get Bran from there.that's what I thought, yes.I can see Locke running off with Bran during the confusion of the attack, only to be run down by Coldhands on his elk. That way Bran and Jon would never meet despite being so close, and it would be a more dramatic entrance for Coldhands who could then have some sort of interaction with the Night's King & Friends.I like this as an introduction for CH
3685	protar	2014-04-29	This is my fear and it would be really lame. It could have worked if Locke was genuinely sent to the NW and he actually got into it, but as he's a double agent it sort of takes away from the assassination to kill Jon because he's evil, rather than because he thinks he's helping the greater good.
3686	boojam	2014-04-29	I'm wondering if they might become slightly fire-forged friends--emphasis on the slightly, mostly because of the Wildling attack (and Locke standing in the background during the "tonight we fight!" trailer clip).

That will determine a lot.Ok, I have looked at that "Tonight we fight" clip several times now, where is Locke?There are two guys in the background who have beards , sort of, similar to Locke, but I can't make him out.If he's not there then I would say he getting killed next episode, or could last until 6.Locke , it seems, feels he needs to tail Jon because of his association with Bran and Rickon.I don't think he gives a hoot about Jon.Here is my guess, Jon's crew will wipe out the Crow Rapscallions. Locke will discover Bran and try to kill only to be attacked by Summer or Ghost or both and killed.Could be Jon does meet Bran, but cannot talk him to coming back to the Wall.One wonders if Bran will tell Jon about Rickon?Or Jon never sees Bran.I think Locke is toast.
3687	Dalfiatach	2014-04-29	It's pretty obvious who is being set up on the show to play the "Bowen Marsh" role of the faithful brother to stab Jon.

Â 
this would be my guess, too. him and sam were the only of jon's closest friends at the watch who didn't volunteer to join his mutineers raiding party. i would like the change though since pyp has been a rather likeable character which would make jon's "death" scene even more heartbreaking.

3694	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-29	I really hope not.
Â 
Jon being assassinated by his 'brothers' shows the conflict and corruption going on within the NW, not the drama revolving around the Northern (Stark/Bolton)Â Game of Thrones, so to speak.
Â 
Wasn't thereÂ a sayingÂ like 'as long as the NW remain true they will stay strong' and the theory that the NW and Wall will fall because of their treachery?
Â 
I think it's important to keep the stabbing a NW affair, not aÂ Bolton set up.
3695	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-29	I thought we had come to the consensus that Locke is going to take Satin's role in the story.

Â 
I can't see Locke being thrilled or willing to clean out chamber pots for someone considering his 'fuck the high born cunts who look down on us blah blah...' attitude.
3696	Chebyshov	2014-04-29	This is my fear and it would be really lame.

Â 
Agreed. The whole point is that Jon is stabbed by brothers devoted to the NW, and Jon is poor at explaining his motives to them. Having a hidden Bolton agent to the deed would undermine everything about Jon's reign as LC.

Â 
I can see Locke gaining some respect/admiration for Jon, but still ultimately going through with the job despite not getting any satisfaction out of it like he did with Jaime. That would add a similar level of reluctance that was in the books.
Â 
Or he's just an evil bastard that doesn't give a shit.

Sadly Jatin will only live in the minds of the Book!Brothers. I'm just relieved they're not turning Olyver into Satin, personally.
3700	JesterX	2014-04-29	What would Roose Bolton want with the Stark boys, anyway?Â  They completely knock out his position as Warden of the North and eventual Lord of Winterfell.Â  Bolton only told Locke to find the Stark boys, he didn't say bring them back.Â  I think Locke's job is to kill them.Â  Which means if Bran lives, Locke dies.
3701	Jazzman	2014-04-29	has he been there this season? if he has i haven't noticed.


Yes the actor is there, but he had cut his hair very short, and I read somewhere that the directors changed his character, so he is now credited as Othell Yarwyck i think?

Seriously though, I would prefer if D&D actually had the Night's Watch stab him instead of it being some Bolton conspiracy. It's worth saying that at the end of the day, stabbing Jon isn't going to get Bran and Rickon back so it's still possible he won't be the one who stabs him.

3714	Fuse Prime	2014-04-29	I don't think so. Like Jon above me said, it loses something if it's from an enemy rather than a brother. Also, to keep Locke around for so long doing nothing about taking care of Jon Snow makes him look ineffectual. It would get really boring having him hang out and do Â ... nothing until the time comes seasons (a season?) from now.
Â 
I think he will try to get to Jon during the battle at the Wall and won't succeed. My fervent hope is that Ygritte's arrow takes him as he gets close to Jon.


Â 
I absolutely see this as being the most plausible outcome for Locke. Â That's why it won't happen. Â

3717	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-29	Unless he takes on a Marsh role, it seems like his involvement is ultimately pointless. Is he just going to be another guy for Jon, the greatest swordsman alive, to defeat?
Â 
If he is just offed in the whole convoluted Bran/Craster's filler plot, I would rather not have that character be there. He just becomes a filler character.
Â 
I think the show writers are smarter than this, and he will serve some actual meaningful purpose.
Â 
And he is a badass. I want a Locke action figure.

Some people think that's Locke - which would suggest that he survives Craster's Keep and returns to the Wall in time for the battle. Others think that the man is just an extra who happens to look a little bit like Noah Taylor. I'm inclined to take the latter point of view, primarily because of everything that the show has set up so far regarding Locke - namely, his mission and his characterization. Locke is not a good dude - he's pretty much an outright sadist. We've seen nothing to suggest that he has an altruistic streak, one that would compel him to forgo Roose Bolton's offer to give him "a thousand acres and a holdfast" in exchange for hunting down the Stark boys. He's going to turn that offer down in order to swear vows of chastity and poverty and join an undermanned order comprised largely of criminals that's about to fall under assault from a massive wildling army? That doesn't strike me as a decision that a ruthless and practical man like Locke would make. If Locke gets a chance to kill Bran, he's going to take it, and he will get that chance in the next episode - his first and last chance, as it happens.
Â 
Obviously he isn't going to succeed, but what stops him? Would the writers really spend several episodes building Locke up as this major threat to Bran, have him infiltrate the Night's Watch under false pretenses, and join a mission that will take him directly to where Bran's being held ... only to have him never encounter the kid? Even worse, after thoroughly establishing Locke as a vicious killer who buddies up with Ramsay and doesn't appear to have a single good bone in his body, would he suddenly have a completely random change of heart and let Bran go? I've got more faith in the writers than that. Locke is going to try and kill Bran, and once he makes his move, I think that someone will kill him. Most likely it will be Jon, but it could also be Meera, or Summer, or Bran by warging into Hodor.
Â 
Regardless of who does him in, I don't see Locke surviving to have a change of heart, join the Night's Watch in earnest, and take on the Bowen Marsh role somewhere down the line. If that was the route that the writers were planning to go with his character, it would have been much more effective to simply have Roose send him to the Wall in order to escape Tywin Lannister's wrath. Under those circumstances, Locke probably would have been simmering with resentment that he got so thoroughly screwed over, and he might have had a genuine reason to bond with Jon. There would be no need for this elaborate charade and, possibly, a radical change in his personality.
Â 
Noah Taylor is awesome, and he's given a great performance as Locke. In my opinion, he's been far superior to Vargo Hoat in every way. But I think that his days are numbered.

3719	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-29	I agree that Locke is a much better character than Vargo Hoat.
Â 
Locke somehow getting Bran out of Crasters Keep without Jon seeing and then running off into the woods only to run into Cold Hands seems a plausible scene!
3720	angelodebo	2014-04-29	Maybe I am venturing into "crackpot" territory..but I interpret Locke as an agent for Roose Bolton, who is an agent for the White Walkers. I believe Locke will get attempt to kill Bran but will fail. He will then stay on for the fight at Castle Black and become close with John. Next season, he will take part in the assignation of John Snow which will have been orchestrated by Roose Bolton.
Â 
Â 
Roose has men at the wall. The "wrong way rangers" anyone? He knows killing John will cause havoc on the wall and allow the White Walkers their opportunity to come south.
Â 
Â 
Think about it...the leaches, burning the book at Harrenhall, his comment "Forever young" in the HBO series..etc etc

3721	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-29	Locke will try to kill Jon at Crasters and Ghost will kill Locke before he succeeds.
Â 
Why all the Locke love? The guy is a creepy sadist who cut off Jamie's hand and threw Brienne into the pit with the bear.
Â 
Remember, he has to kill the Starks before he gets his holdfast and land from Bolton.
3722	WhiteWalker11	2014-04-29	Locke will stab Jon


Â 
Almost 100%.
Â 
He will probably end up protecting him during the battle w the wildings or something of the sort so that the viewer's think he has a redeeming quality behind his skill with a sword.Â  After all, he was only charged to find Bran & Rickon. The show will give him some ups & downs to leave his true motive/ambition some vagueness, then when the time is right he'll def. be the one to do it.
Â 
But if so, how long can they really string that relationship out? Will we see Jon stabbed at the end of next season?!
Â 
I wish they'd expound on Janos Slynt a little bit so the showfolk can understand who he is, why he's there, and how much of a d-bag his really is.Â  Many don't even recall him turning on Ned.
Â 
Also can't wait for the little redheaded kid to get revenge on Ygritte.

Ick, I hope not. This undermines the Jon Snow mutiny so much!
3724	DaveyJoe	2014-04-29	We lost Joffrey, we're about to lose Karl, I hope Locke gets to stick around a while longer.
3725	Lord Jennings	2014-04-29	really like the Locke vs Coldhands idea. Will be pretty pissed if its Locke doing the Jon stabbing. But I am starting to get the feeling that the show is turning in to a completely different animal than the books. Same premise - 2 different stories.
3726	Teren_Kanan	2014-04-29	While I'm sure Locke will remain an evil character, and ultimately a villain for Jon, I think it would be some mighty amazing storytelling to have such a bad character actually end up befriending Jon, and becoming a companion of his. Definitely fits the Grey world of ASOIAF. Everything the character needs for such a storyline is already there.
3727	JonBranRickon	2014-04-29	I think Locke lasts as long as the Craster Keep story lasts.Â Â

I too could see this sort of thing happening with Locke even though it never would have happened with Vargo Hoat in the books. Locke's more of a loner than Vargo was and they don't have any of the Bloody Mummers etc, at all so Locke could definitely be morphed into something else. I don't think they will do that however as it doesn't really serve any purpose in Jon's future story as it plays out in the books unless there's a character we don't know about yet.
3729	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-29	Where did this Locke dude come from again? Have we seen him in the show before? If yes, I totally missed it.
3730	briantw	2014-04-29	Where did this Locke dude come from again? Have we seen him in the show before? If yes, I totally missed it.

He cut Jaime's hand off and delivered him and Brienne to Roose at Harrenhal.  He was also at the Dreadfort in episode two.  Roose told him he'd give him land in exchange for hunting down the two Stark children.
3731	Envie	2014-04-29	Where did this Locke dude come from again? Have we seen him in the show before? If yes, I totally missed it.

He's the replacement for Vargo Hoat (and the Bloody Mummers) in the book - he cut off Jaime's hand - how could anyone forget?

3734	jarl the climber	2014-04-29	Don't know if anyone pointed this out yet but I am thinking that Locke will be the person to stab Jon when the time comes. What you think?


I think Locke will turn on Jon and Bran and try to kill both of them and that will prove to Jon that its to dangerous for Bran to go back. I really think it would be more interesting if they ran into some White Walkers and maybe Locke saw the size of the Wildling host with Mance and sort of had a change of heart and went back to Roose and said, "Hey, its not that simple." and "you need Snow if your going to hold the Wall" and he lies about Bran perhaps out of a sense of Northern patriotism. All the back stabby stuff can be interesting but sometimes it can strain reason.

If that's the case the question is how will Craster's Keep play out?
Will Bran and Company have already escaped?Â  Will Locke really help Jon?Â  What if Jon meets with Bran again, will Locke eavesdrop on this, maybe he'll be the one to convince him to let Bran go North for his reasons?Â Â  He may be a Bolton follower but it doesn't mean he's going to be willing to kill a cripple that's not Jaime Lannister, nevermind the fact that he may see him as dead already.
Â 
I'm leaning towards this as one it could distract the audience come the big event that happens in book 5, and will this mean that Locke actually becomes Jon's Steward?
Â 
I don't think it will help the writers if they just kill him off for that's another name that the audience will have to be introduced to later and there are plenty as of now, and this can keep the book readers guessing with a good idea as to what will happen.
Â 
I see it very believable that Locke becomes Jon's second hand man as he rises in ranks, since he's trying to imply a somewhat similar back story to Jon's.

Agreed, now will they actually have Locke possibly gain some respect for Jon and the Watch, or even see Jon as a friend, seeing as the description of the scene in the books and seeing as him being the possible replacement of Bowen Marsh
3738	darksellsword	2014-04-29	It would be so funny if Locke is cold hands it would blow everyones mind , he tries to go after Bran to kill him dies himself comes back
as cold hands.
3739	Pomaxxx	2014-04-30	to me the appearance of Locke at the Wall was a real let down because that just mixes the story arcs up too much.
Jon going for Crasters makes some sense in a way, him missing Bran closely...whatever.
but getting Boltons interests of eliminating the Stark boys in here at that point i dislike.
Â 
IF Locke will be the one to stab Jon (which i doubt, cuz Locke should die at Crasters or shortly thereafter), thats so killing the meaning of the stabbing and i will be a sad panda.
3740	dbunting	2014-04-30	I think they still need to keep it as a brother who does the stabbing. And now that Pyp has been mentioned, he seems a likely candidate. If he or even Grenn did it while saying, for the watch, then it would actually be an emotional scene way more than if Locke did it.

hahaaha . That was the first time I've mentioned coldhands but yeah I know what you mean. I just think it would be a good twist, well one that I would prefer more than Locke being involved in stabbing Jon. I don't see them changing the story just to have Locke killed at crasters or during the Wildling attack it would be pointless.

Â 
Ok, so the frustration is not at you specifically but rather the overall obsession about Coldhands and all the crackpot theories as to his connection with established characters and the Others and where he's going to appear in the show (which doesn't look like he will at all). I guess you could say I'm a little tired of it haha!
Â 
Also, they seem to have made Locke into a much more important character (since obviously he's not Vargo Hoat who cut Jaime's hand off in the book) so it does stand to reason he has a bigger part to play in the television version of the story. What that is, I have no idea.
Â 
Perhaps as some have suggested, he'll fight with Jon until a certain point (after it's obvious he can't get his hands on Bran or Rickon) and then desert and head back to let the Boltons know about the Others and Wildlings. Both of those things are going to be really important for the northerners on both sides of the political fence to know about not just at the wall or with Stannis.Â 
Â 
I suspect Locke's main purpose (since his character is entirely changed) is to be an informant and communications tool to tie together some of the various plot lines ...bringing each of them a step closer to the main threat happening north of the wall.Â 
Â 
I doubt he's going to be the one to stab Jon later. As others have already stated... the fact Jon was betrayed by his own men (much like Mormont was) is important to the story and his character. Having Locke do it would diminish the seriousness.Â

This is my thought too. He follows the Kids as they escape North...somehow ends up dead...maybe in the battle with the Mutineers then ends up a Wright who is Coldhands

This makes no sense! Wights are raised from the dead and basically zombies whose only thought process is to kill. They do what the White Walkers bid them to do, they don't think for themselves or interact with people! Â And even further, why on earth would Locke, who has been sent north to seek out the missing Bran and Rickon then turn around to become Coldhands (who btw already told them in the books he's been around for a very very long time)?? Coldhands helps Bran and crew get to Bloodraven, he doesn't want them dead!
Â 
Baffled

Edit: Good grief, between this thread, the Others revelation thread and the Bran and Crew thread, there's so many bizarre crackpot theories about Coldhands we might as well consider Cersei next in line to be morphed into Coldhands! Â

Yeah, I agree with that.  I don't think he's going to be in the show at all, and it doesn't really bother me all that much.  I just feel that, if they were going to put him in, they should have done it to start the season, or midway through last season.  Throwing him in midway through this one when he may cease to be of any consequence by the end of the season just seems pointless.  
And if he is in the show, I think it's still safe to assume he's not terribly important in the books, because they haven't cast anyone significant to play him that we've heard about, and he's not really the type of casting that needs to be kept secret.

Well for as much grief as I'm giving other posters with their crackpot theories on who Coldhands is, I will admit I'm slightly disappointed to find out he may not be a major player in the final story / outcome. I really thought he was some sort of link between the Others, Bloodraven and the magic of the north that would be revealed to us towards the end. Unless they are intending to save Coldhands for much later or as a cameo appearance only right before Bran gets to Bloodraven, I don't really see why they'd put him in at this point either.Â 
Â 
My original hope had been that he was Benjen Stark (since we never did find out what happened to him) and that he was there to help the Stark children however he could.
Â 
I've gone and derailed the topic however, sorry!Â 
Â 
No way in hell is Locke going to 'become' Coldhands or anyone else for that matter. Now who or what Locke does become (reformed ally or hidden spy) remains to be seen. I personally think he's a communication tool for the Boltons. He won't get Bran or Rickon obviously so they'll have him desert and run back to Roose as soon as he sees just how many wildlings there really are out there - or if he sees an Other.Â

I also think that Jon making a true ally of him could make for a really interesting story. Maybe he even gets his character blended together a bit with Satin and The Archer to help Jon converting the Wildlings.
Â 
I do talk to Unsullied show watchers that do have a realyl tough time keeping up with so many smaller characters. Maybe blending several small stories and parts into 1 character isnt so bad.

He's not going to act as a spy for the boltons mainly because noone gives a shit about what the Boltons know is he going to stay there and report back to Lord Bolton like Mork to orson every week updating him. They deliberately put him with Jon Â and in reach of Bran for a reason to make a big impact on the story , from the books we know there wouldn't be much point at all in his info being passed to the Boltons its fairly likely that one out of these three senarios comes to pass, He gets randomly killed at some point either at crasters or Â when the wildlings attack(pointless imo) He becomes one of the conspirators in the stabbing of Jon or the third option he continues his mission to kill Bran and becomes coldhands.

3757	D_Richard	2014-04-30	I like the enthusiasm everyone, but Locke was sent to the Wall specifically to see if the remaining Stark boys are there with Jon, and to capture/eliminate them. His "betrayal" or "desertion" once he catches wind of Bran & Co.is a function of his mission.
Â 
If he fails and then morphs into a Bowen Marsh character, it remains to be seen.
Â 
My guess is he'll come into contact with Bran, it'll be a cat & mouse game or something, and his death will be a payoff during a climactic scene this season or next. Regardless, his time with Jon is limited in my opinion.
3758	hedgeknight001	2014-04-30	I don't see Locke turning around. He's the bastard that cut off Jaime's hand for being smug and arrogant. He's the one who was buddying up to Ramsey and sharing torture stories. Sorry, I don't see him softening towards Jon.

Locke has already fulfilled the Vargo Hoat role, next I think he will hunt for Bra (under some night's watch ranger pretext), then return to the wall and happen to receive instructions to kill Jon Snow from Cersei via Roose Bolton. 
What we know of Locke so far is that he a mercenary and a violent one. This would fit.
3760	Veltigar	2014-04-30	I think they still need to keep it as a brother who does the stabbing. And now that Pyp has been mentioned, he seems a likely candidate. If he or even Grenn did it while saying, for the watch, then it would actually be an emotional scene way more than if Locke did it.


I like the Pyp suggestion, although I think it's more likely that he'll take on Daeron's role and get killed by Arya. Grenn, well I can't see him or Edd betray Jon. They are totally on board with his plan, I think it would be jarring to have them oppose him.
3761	dbunting	2014-04-30	Correct...jarring equals emotional. Not saying I want this but it would hit you like a ton of bricks
3762	Dany's Silver	2014-04-30	No, Bowen Marsh kills Jon for totally different reasons then Locke would, it would change so many things about the story at the wall.
Besides that point it looks fairly likely that Locke is going to die in whatever happens at Crasters since he's sent by Bolton to "find those two boys" and we know Brans there and stuff. Locke has no reason to stay around for the time it would take to get to Jons assassination. I thought it was made pretty clear in the show, I don't understand where people made this Marsh- Locke connection at all.


I really hope it remains Bowen Marsh who leads the mutineers against Jon.
Â 


It's pretty obvious who is being set up on the show to play the "Bowen Marsh" role of the faithful brother to stab Jon.
Â 
Pyp.


This just rips my heart out. It would certainly be poignant, but I would hate to see that.  I would really like them to not change the nature of Jon's relationship/friendship with his brothers.Â  Pyp risked being caught and charged as a deserter to bring Jon back to the wall in AGoT, and I can't see him turning on Jon.Â  It could be that it's a good thing that Pyp is around at the Wall while Jon is gone, because he can keep an eye on things. Perhaps he'll overhear Thorne and Asshat Slynt hoping Jon doesn't come back from Craster's Keep?Â  I would prefer something that, which would hopefully make Pyp a staunch supporter.Â  We do need to remember that Pyp isn't a ranger, and even though Dolorous Edd isn't either, both he and Grenn will be helpful since they just escaped.Â  As I said elsewhere, perhaps off screen they've made Jon aware that Ghost is at CK, and they can help him free Ghost (and possibly Summer).
Â 


Yes the actor is there, but he had cut his hair very short, and I read somewhere that the directors changed his character, so he is now credited as Othell Yarwyck i think?


B. Cogman clarified that after the GoT wiki confused the matter. 
Â 


I don't think Locke will be alive by Episode 9.


Word.Â 
Â 


I think they still need to keep it as a brother who does the stabbing. And now that Pyp has been mentioned, he seems a likely candidate. If he or even Grenn did it while saying, for the watch, then it would actually be an emotional scene way more than if Locke did it.


I'll say it again: 
Â 

<snip>
No way in hell is Locke going to 'become' Coldhands or anyone else for that matter. Now who or what Locke does become (reformed ally or hidden spy) remains to be seen. I personally think he's a communication tool for the Boltons. He won't get Bran or Rickon obviously so they'll have him desert and run back to Roose as soon as he sees just how many wildlings there really are out there - or if he sees an Other.Â 


I have been thinking that Locke will be direwolf food, but I also just realized that Locke cutting off Jaime's hand (semi-crippling him) is kind of a karmic kick at Jaime's ass since he full-on crippled Bran (not that I like Locke after everything he wanted to do to Brienne).Â
3763	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-30	Locke is going to be the one that stabs Jon.  I mean come on y'all, we all know that this series has already taken a different route.  The unsullied who watch this show don't care about Bowen Marsh and the oath of the nights watch, and what they stand for.  But Locke stabbing Jon is good television.

No. Just no. It would deprive me of the pleasure of watching the direwolves make short work of Locke.
3765	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-30	No. Just no. It would deprive me of the pleasure of watching the direwolves make short work of Locke. 

That would be nice for us book readers but we aren't the target audience.  I would love that as well, hell even Bran warging into Summer and eating Locke would be sweet.
3766	sj4iy	2014-04-30	No. Just no. It would deprive me of the pleasure of watching the direwolves make short work of Locke. I would settle for Rast, myself.
3767	lostinasia	2014-04-30	Think of the story arcs. Presumably next episode Karl's going to die - and I doubt they're going to have two main villains, Karl and Locke, both die in the same episode and indeed pretty much the same scene. (The show only does that to heroes I think.) Purely because of that I don't think Locke's going to die at Craster's.
Â 
My guess is that somehow he's going to be chasing after Bran, although I have little idea how that'll play out - after all, it's not exactly going to be a dramatic race. I'll be quite surprised if Locke returns to Castle Black, given that his main task is to find the Stark boys.
Â 
I had assumed long ago that Coldhands was cut, as Sam's actor apparently confirmed, but now I'm starting to wonder. I still don't think he's going to appear, but his intervention makes untying the "Casterese Knot" easier: he can get Bran out so Jon doesn't meet him (although I'm not averse at all to the two meeting), and he can provide an adversary that ensures Locke follows Bran over a couple of episodes. If Coldhands isn't there, then a Locke/Bran confrontation would happen almost immediately - it's not as if Hodor's going to drag Bran faster than Locke can walk. But if Coldhands is there, Locke will skulk along behind, uncertain about what he's going to do.
3768	Dany's Silver	2014-04-30	I would settle for Rast, myself.


Both of them then.
3769	Envie	2014-04-30	Yep -- Bolton promised him minor nobility. No way would a commoner cutthroat turn *that* down.


Â 
This is why I thought it was really odd Locke would ask to take his NW vows as a recruit so he could join Jon Snow's forray to Craster's. If he's been promised a knighthood - he can't very well take that as a 'deserter' of the Night's Watch - in fact deserters are supposed to be killed for it. Is Roose Bolton just going to ignore him taking the vows?

Â 
Well, the North is pretty lawless right now thanks to Bolton and his bastard, so probably.
3771	Bear Island	2014-05-01	I could definitely see Locke developing conflicting notions about what he's supposed to do for Roose the longer he spends time at the Wall with Jon. He seems affable enough and has a connection with Jon almost immediately (although he's putting on a front for now to get in his good graces).
Â 
My money is on him becoming Jon's right hand at the Wall after he becomes LC and taking on many of the Bowen Marsh actions in the following seasons. Obviously, the dynamic would be different because he wouldn't be the old-guard established NW man that Marsh is but you would be able to keep the audience on their toes about just exactly where his loyalties lie which could be interesting. And when his buddy Ramsay sends the goading letter to Jon, that's where you'll see what his true colors are.
Â 
Really, anything that keeps Noah Taylor around is fine with me. That guy is awesome.


Â 
I've been lucky enough to work with Noah and he is an amazing guy. Really kind and an amazing actor. I was thrilled to see him on GOT.
I totally agree with you, I tend to think Locke might come to like Jon and struggle with where his loyalties lie. It would be boring if he were nothing more than an evil guy who will turn on Jon the first chance he gets.

3772	Cazzy	2014-05-01	So out of what I can imagine possibly happening:
Â 
1.Locke stabs jon- I don't really see the purpose of why locke would do this, unless roose thought jon had some sort of claim to the north. Â I can't really make a connection for locke's purpose in doing this without it being far fetched. Â It also has absolutely no shock of betrayal like books had.
Â 
2.Jon kills locke at crasters keep to protect bran-This would be so stupid to even reintroduce locke this season for something as pointless as this. They have already given bran's story drama with the guys at craster's keep, what purpose could lock possibly serve?Â  Â I don't give the show writers much credit but I do give them more credit than this.Â 
Â 
3.Locke follows bran- Â If he replaces the fight of the white walkers in front of the cave and is killed by bran's group(possibly cold hands), it does kind of add suspense to non book readers by showing that bran is being followed and is in constant danger. Â Problem being is why he would follow them instead of just killing them. Â He could possibly be used as an introduction to coldhands as someone said before, but I dunno I just don't see this happening.
Â 
4.Locke changes and becomes an ally to jon-This would be really interesting to see as locke is a really good character and this would make the character even better. Again I don't really see this happening for some reason.
Â 
5.How I would do it-Melisandre sees who locke really is and forces him to help mance get into winterfell and get close to jeyne. Â He can then either betray mance or get discovered with him.
Â 
Â 
So basically I have absolutely no idea wtf they are doing with locke, but I really hope it is not # 1 or 2.
3773	bent branch	2014-05-01	I have been reading with interest the posts on how Locke may be in place to be the one who stabs Jon. There was always an element of "Southron" influence in the assasination attempt on Jon. First there was the letter from Tywin and then we saw that Thorne, Marsh and Yarwick were plotting together. If Locke is used to assasinate Jon, the show is simply showing the "Southron" impetus behind the attack more clearly. Same basic result, just a clearer picture of what was behind the stabbing.
3774	SeventySeven	2014-05-01	I think it's entirely possible Locke will be the Bowen Marsh of the situation, as they tend to do these sort of things and they have a good actor/character with Locke and a recognisable face for the audience. I know plot wise it wouldn't make as much sense, but then again neither does this Jon/Bran/Craster's plot (I'm still enjoying it though, because Jon and the NW are finally getting screen time).
3775	briantw	2014-05-01	This is why I thought it was really odd Locke would ask to take his NW vows as a recruit so he could join Jon Snow's forray to Craster's.

Is Roose Bolton just going to ignore him taking the vows?

I would imagine having the Warden of the North as a friend would alleviate those concerns.  Roose can simply request that the King pardon Locke and I'd imagine the crown would comply.  They'd have no reason not to, as Roose is their key to a subdued North.

Â 
It does "make sense" it's just a bit contrived. The main thing everyone seems to be missing about Jon's assassination attempt is that it was done by his long-time brothers, loyal men of the Night's Watch who did what they did because they thought it was better for the watch overall, and that Jon was essentially becoming a traitor. He wasn't shanked because people just hate him or they're treacherous bastards deep down. This isn't Carlito's Way. Obviously it was still messed up, but I think two important things that would be completely negated by this switch is that 1) Jon's leadership isn't perfect even though his intent is good and 2) Jon needs to be truly betrayed by his own, loyal men to setup the future events.Â

Â 
Dunno, but perhaps Locke would be curious enough to try to follow Bran to his destination - to find out what is it that is so important to Bran that he would abandon Jon? What is this special treasure that lies further to the north?
Â 
Having Locke as a Lieutenant Gerard character hounding the group might help give Bran's story a greater sense of urgency than was delivered in the books.
3778	DaveyJoe	2014-05-01	Well Locke is one of Jon's men now, he's officially a brother of the Night's Watch is he not? Â Jon may never know of Locke's relationship with Bolton, so from his perspective he's still being betrayed by his brothers. Â If Locke sticks around he has time to gain some loyalty to Jon and respect for the Night's Watch. Â Maybe he sees something north of the wall that convinces him that the war up north is the most important thing going on.

But his perspective means nothing. The thing is, a REAL member of the NW, Bowen, betrayed his LC and tired to murder him. If Locke does this, it would mean that the NW didn't betray Jon. Which is, of course, wrong.

Why would curiosity lead him to follow Bran when Roose sent him north to find the Stark boys? It's why he's there.
Â 
What I find most interesting, however, is what Locke does if/when he sees what's really at stake? Lord Bolton's commands won't seem so important once Locke gets a good look at a White Walker.
Â 
And with such an interesting actor like Taylor, I'd love to see D&D write some more dimension into his character.

Jon was stabbed my multiple people, if Locke is one of the people it won't change the fact that he's been betrayed by a number of his NW brothers.

That's a pretty big gamble for Locke to voluntarily take - especially considering he's made it clear several times now he can't stand nobles or their laws. I highly doubt Locke actually trusts Roose Bolton and certainly doesn't trust the crown to pardon him. I'm just not buying it that he'd willingly take the vows to the night's watch thinking he'll still get a knight-hood when he returns home. There's a plot twist in there somewhere we have no idea about since Locke wasn't in the books.

I think the 'reason' you and most of us don't see this happening is because we've already been shown Locke's despicable side. Not only did he chop off Jaime's hand (which could have been seen as treasonous by the crown) but he also put Brienne in a pit with a grizzly bear for sport. Seems quite a few people in this thread are forgetting this side of the character they're suddenly all praising as the next hero to the Night's Watch. haha! I think Locke's got more than Jon Snow fooled with good acting right now.Â
3783	Hath4	2014-05-01	The man is friends with ramsay, he is a huge threat and a terrible guy. He has one goal at the wall and that is to kill the remaining Starks.

I don't think it's that big of a gamble.  He's working directly under the orders of the new Warden in the North.  If he does his job, he can probably safely assume that he will be protected and rewarded by Roose.  He's likely only taking his vows because that's the only way he'd be allowed to go beyond the Wall with Jon.I think the 'reason' you and most of us don't see this happening is because we've already been shown Locke's despicable side.

To be fair, Jaime was an enemy captive when he chopped his hand off, so it's not as if there was any treason there.  The Boltons were still allied with the Starks at this point as far as everyone knew, and Locke had no reason to believe otherwise.  As for Brienne, well, it doesn't really seem abnormal for wartime soldiers in this series to do terrible things to women, and surely not all of those soldiers are simply cruel like the Mountain.  We hear descriptions of those acts all the time in the books.
I'm not excusing Locke or saying he's a good guy, but none of his actions thus far have been anywhere near what we've seen Ramsay do.
3785	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-01	I think the Wildlings attack craster's keep before the watch gets there. Bran and the gang go meet Mance Rayder. Who sends them on their way because they are trying to fight the Others. Locke sees no oppertunity to Kill Jon so goes back to the wall with him or goes off in search of Bran. I don't think he's going to die in the next episode. One of the trends of the story is to have unlikely temporary alliances/friendships Arya/Hound for example. I think Jon and Locke is another example of this. But I don't see it lasting too long.

Why are you trying to make Locke into a redeemable character? yuck! The guy's a complete creep and deserves to die for what he did to both Jaime and Brienne. I'm not sure why there's this sudden obsession from a lot of show viewers into making Locke some sort of Night's Watch hero. He's there on very nefarious business - he's not going to become Jon's future ally.

I'm pretty sure Locke is a northerner.Â  If the showrunners want to use Noah Taylor to play another character (and have the makeup department turn him into the Old Pomegranate aka Bowen Marsh, that's cool), but Locke is already a replacement for Vargo Hoat.Â  I don't think it works for the show to make the character Locke a replacement for Bowen Marsh because as DarkAndFullOfTurnips and Ingelheim both say:

LOL agreed. He's fooled everyone apparently, even myself. I guess this shows he's a good actor. It's so easy to forget to hate a character in the GOT world. But if he was one of the brothers who stabbed Jon I wouldn't mind as long as he's not one of the main ones.Â
3794	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-01	Jaime cant really complain about "treason to the crown"
He killed a king (albeit he was mad as a hatter)
He also had sex with another Kings wife (Cersei)
3795	Ingelheim	2014-05-01	1. Try to kill Jon in Craster's Keep and get killed by him
2. Try to kill Bran when everyone is fighting around.
3. Turn his cloak and become a brother of the NW in good heart.
4. Follow Bran if he, somehow, escapes Craster's Keep.
5. Get killed by Karl, Rast, etc.
6. Fail his quest and return to Dreadfort.
7. Fail to kill Bran and be killed in Ep.9
8. Survive both Craster's Keep and Battle of Castle Black and remain there.
Â

3796	hedgeknight001	2014-05-01	This is why I thought it was really odd Locke would ask to take his NW vows as a recruit so he could join Jon Snow's forray to Craster's. If he's been promised a knighthood - he can't very well take that as a 'deserter' of the Night's Watch - in fact deserters are supposed to be killed for it. Is Roose Bolton just going to ignore him taking the vows?
That's a fair point -- but I have the sense that oaths don't mean much anymore, if they ever meant anything to Bolton.
Also, apparently he wasn't going to be allowed to go unless he took the vow. After overhearing Jon & Sam estimate that Bran was at Craster's, Locke probably calculated "so what" about the oath, if it meant finding Bran and getting knighthood. And, in the present political climate, he'd probably get away with it.
3797	bent branch	2014-05-01	I'm pretty sure Locke is a northerner.Â  If the showrunners want to use Noah Taylor to play another character (and have the makeup department turn him into the Old Pomegranate aka Bowen Marsh, that's cool), but Locke is already a replacement for Vargo Hoat.Â  I don't think it works for the show to make the character Locke a replacement for Bowen Marsh because as DarkAndFullOfTurnips and Ingelheim both say:
Â 
Â 


Â 
I am also certain that Locke is a northerner in the series, but these events are at least partially responsible for the assassination of Jon. First is this conversation between Tyrion and Tywin (Chapter 32-ASOS):
Â 

Tyrion's anger flashed. "Lord Janos is a hollow suit of armor who will sell himself to the highest bidder."
Â 
"I count that a point in his favor. Who is like to bid higher than us?" He turned to Pycelle. "Send a raven. Write that King Jeffrey was deeply saddened to hear of Lord Commander Mormont's death, but regrets that he can spare no men just now, whilst so many rebels and usurpers remain in the field. Suggest that matters might be quite different once the throne is secure...provided the king has full confidence in the leadership of the Watch. In closing, ask Marsh to pass along His Grace's fondest regards to his faithful friend and servant, Lord Janos Slynt."
Â 

Â 
That this letter found its audience in evident in this scene from Chapter 79-ASOS (Jon is in the baths of Castle Black):

Â 

The sound of voices echoing off the vaulted ceiling brought him back to Castle Black. "I don't know," a man was saying, in a voice thick with doubts. "Maybe if I knew the man better...Lord Stannis didn't have much good to say of him, I'll tell you that."
Â 
"When has Stannis Baratheon ever had much good to say of anyone?" Ser Alliser's flinty voice was unmistakable. "If we let Stannis choose our Lord Commander, we become his bannermen in all but name. Tywin Lannister is not like to forget that, and you know it will be Lord Tywin who wins in the end. He's already beaten Stannis once, on the Blackwater."
Â 
"Lord Tywin favors Slynt," said Bowen Marsh, in a fretful, anxious voice. "I can show you his letter, Othell. 'Our faithful friend and servant,' he called him."
Â 
Jon Snow sat up suddenly, and the three men froze at the sound of the slosh. "My lords," he said with cold courtesy.
Â 
Â 

Â 
So Tywin sends a letter and Thorne, Marsh and Yarwick are worried about pleasing either Tywin or Stannis. Thorne has said that Tywin will win and the NW will suffer if they don't separate themselves from Stannis. So, just before Jon is stabbed the pink letter comes in, which 1. comes with a pink Bolton seal (the Warden of the North or in other words the official representative of the IT in the north) and 2. informs them that Stannis has died. When the letter says if you give me these hostages and I'll leave you alone, but Jon decides to take the Wildings to go fight Bolton, Marsh, et. al. decide it is time to take Jon out. They do it for the Watch, but it is because they are afraid of bringing the wrath of the IT (in the form of the Boltons) down on them.
Â 
So, rather than telling the story with Marsh and Yarwick being influenced by Tywin's letter the show is simply going to put a Bolton operative in the NW. It's a much more straight forward story and to be blunt the connection between Tywin's letter and Jon's stabbing seems to go over many people's heads.Â

The chapters you reference are from ASOS, but in the ADWD timeline, Tywin is long dead by the time Jon's brothers in the NW stab him, so I don't think that element of the NW is quite so afraid of the IT's retribution.Â  IIRC, isn't the NW aware of the troubles facing the IT under Cersei's severe mismanagement?Â  I'm sorry, but I'm also just not convinced that Locke will be around for Jon's stabbing.Â  This betrayal is far more poignant because it comes from within the NW, from men who have served longer than Jon.Â

Â 
Yes, these are all reasons that make sense for the plot even though I feel like this Locke guy should be smarter than to trust Roose Bolton. He was however dumb enough to fall for the 'sapphires of Tarth' line Jaime gave him to keep her as a hostage instead of rape/ kill her so greed is apparently enough to drive this guy to even take the vows of the Night's Watch to get his prey (Bran and Rickon).
Â 
If anyone still thinks this guy should live, remember this stuff. He's a bad man.

3801	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-02	I hope Locke kills Jon.
Â 
I loved Jon in the books.
Â 
Breath-voice on the show makes me hate him! He is a representation of our generation of entitled bastards. Not literal bastards, many of my generation are just A-holes and Jon is just like them. In the show.
Â 
Really, I don't understand the hate for LF's voice. Jon talks the same way. People just ignore it cause he has good hair.
Â 
Jon is a dick who really never blames himself for anything he does wrong and gets a hard-on from bossing people around. He is so ungrateful for his lot and needs to be taught a lesson.
Â 
Maybe, once he dies, a new actor will replace him so that I can like him again. Like, he'll go inside a different body warg-style and be portrayed by a more talented actor who doesn't also suck at sword fights.
Â 
That's my Jon rant. I feel better now.
3802	DaveyJoe	2014-05-02	Yeah Jon was my favorite POV in the books and I find him really underwhelming in the show.Â  He's just not a great actor.

It's funny how critical people on this forum are even though both Kit and Emelia get rave reviews from the unsullied viewers overall. I have to suspect book readers are much harder on the actors than most others.Â 
Â 
Personally, I don't think Kit's that bad. I do believe he was cast more for his looks and charisma though. He's 'grown' into his part these past two seasons and so has Emelia Clarke. Neither were well known or highly acclaimed actors before they started GoT - I think we should give them a break... they don't have the huge resumes some of the more seasoned actors have.

Millions of people like Justin Bieber too. The popcorn eating masses are not made of the most intelligent bunch. Most people accept anything the TV throws at them.Â 
Â 
I think Kit Harington cares more about his body than the role.
Â 
Emilia was the secondish pick for Dany and is more suited for like, a King Kong movie or a sci-fi channel special, which made her great as Khaleesi, but now her range is starting to be stretched. I am holding out for her to the end of this season. If she gets the Unsullied to hate her, then I will consider her to have accomplished her role splendidly.

Â 
I think Emillia has been better then i expected. I think Kit has been improving. Also thats why you have young hot stars and lights out incredible character actors like Charles Dance to carry a scene. I think of all the shows in the world I have a hard time casting to many stones at this one for the casting choices which have been overall, spot on.
3807	SeventySeven	2014-05-02	Oh come on, KH is doing fine. Jon is one of my favourites, and admittedly the first couple of seasons I thought he was underwhelming, but then again much of his storyline was robbed of the good bits and replaced with crap material e.g. having Ygritte do her baiting routine for 3 or 4 episodes, WHAT WAS THAT.
Â 
It got better though, both the writing and the acting, from about halfway season 3.Â
3808	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-02	That's true. The Wall has been boring in the show, while in the books it is some of the best material.

3810	SeventySeven	2014-05-02	The scenes involving the wall will get better this season

I already think it got a lot better. Even though I think the plot is a bit sloppy, I'm really enjoying Jon and the NW so far this season.

Â 
I agree that he's been much better this season, I think he's improving over time.Â  In the 3rd season he was tolerable, but overshadowed by Rose Leslie.Â  In the second season he was pretty bad, and stuck out like a sore thumb in season one.Â  He would have ruined the scene with Maester Aemon if Aemon wasn't so good.Â  Kit's delivery of "you do NOT .. know!" is seriously cringeworthy.

Â 
I'm one of the biggest show apologists on the forum, but I know poor acting when I see it.Â  I wish they had gone with their original choice of Harry Lloyd(Viserys) because he would have really brought that character's inner turmoil out.Â  Instead they went with a pretty boy, and I think that storyline has suffered because of it.Â  Yeah I get that the character is largely internal, but I think the same goes for Sansa, and Sophie Turner has done a much better job and playing that type of role convincingly.Â  Kit's acting has seemed forched most of the time, although I do think he's been pretty good this season.

3812	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-02	I think Owen Teale's (Alliser Thorne) return has helped alot.
The conflict between him and Jon Snow makes good TV.
I'm looking forward to seeing the raid on Crasters where Carl Tanner and his men are holed up.
Locke's introduction is a surprise though a welcome one as Noah Taylor is a great actor
3813	Ingelheim	2014-05-02	Jon Snow's lines and storyline in season 2 have been the worst writing this show has made. By far. Not even Charles Dance could do a good performance with them.
3814	DaveyJoe	2014-05-02	Only this forum would blame D&D for an actor's performance.Â  There are plenty of cheesy lines in this show but the better actors deliver them well.Â  Arya's putting Kit to shame, if he had to deliver the "one of these days I'm going ot put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull" line it would've been a disaster.

Â 
The writers and directors have a LOT of influence in the actor's performance. This week, Warner LA ran a HP marathon. Daniel Radcliffe was quite average in the first two movies: overreacting, speaking like he was reciting his lines. Then, Cuaron came along.
3816	DaveyJoe	2014-05-02	I understand that but Jon has been consistently weak throughout the first 3 seasons, and the show has used largely the same directors.Â  Also, Jon's not the only one getting bad lines, but he's the one who always seems forced and unconvincing.

Â 
In the first 2 seasons yes, I agree. But as someone else pointed out his storyline in season 2 was crap, especially compared to what he had in the books. I think that once his storyline improved so did the acting. I think KH did really well this last episode.

My point is that you can't blame the writing for his season 2 performance, because the other actors have done much better with iffy material.Â  Stannis fans hate some of his scenes but admit that the actor is nailing it.Â  Jon's storyline in season 1 was fine, yet his performance was not good.Â  I agree that he's been good so far this season, because he's dedicated to the role and has been improving with experience.Â  But he was never a natural talent like Maisie Williams.Â  It's just a shame that my favorite POV character is only now getting interesting in the 4th season of the show, because up until now I haven't seen Jon Snow, only a mediocre actor trying really hard.

Â 
BIB: none of the other actors have been given a storyline in which for 4 episodes all they had to do was sulking while a girl made fun of him about not knowing how to do it. It was that cringeworthy, what could he do? I doubt any actor could have made that work. Do you think Charles Dance's delivery of "I know how to do it" (that's all I remember him saying btw, I removed from my memory the rest of the visual fart his storyline was in season 2) would have been better?
Â 
I get what you're saying, like I said he's also one of my faves in the books, yet in the show I was shaking my head for 2 seasons and a bit. In season 3 as well, his storyline was all off and weird, until about episode 7. And I agree, it's a shame he's getting interesting only now, but hey better late than never. If it continues to go well, the rest of the season and the next (I've been looking forward to Jon/Stannis/Mel since forever now) are going to be great for Jon.

Â 
I don`t think the Mountain will show up until episode seven when he kills a bunch of commoners while Cersei looks on. Halfthor Bjornsson said he appears in three episodes (in a bodybuilding magazine that someone on wicnet read). My assumption is he meant 7, 8 and 10.

We saw the shot of a lone rider with a peace banner moving through a battlefield in the original s4 promo and huge Bolton action in ep2 (overshadowed by the PW). Time for Ramsey to prove himself to daddy.
3830	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	That will be in episode eight or ten because Ralf Kenning appears in an Alex Graves directed episode.

3833	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	Indeed but Yara's rescue attempt will likely play out in episode six or seven so that will keep them occupied for a time.
Â 
My reasoning for that: Charlotte Hope (Myranda) has one more appearance coming up, in an Alik Sakharov directed ep. We know from the first trailer that Ramsay makes love to her shirtless. In the Foreshadowing feature we saw Ramsay shirtless and covered in blood go to see Reek in the kennels. In the "weapons and training" feature we caught a glimpse of Ramsay fighting Ironborn shirtless and covered in blood in that same kennel. My verdict? That Yara attacks the Dreadfort and kills Myranda while she fucks Ramsay. She is neutralized and then Ramsay takes on some Ironborn whilst still not wearing a shirt. Hence, Dreadfort attack in episode six or seven.

3844	Sirar Salih	2014-04-24	My money is on Ramsay, without doubt.
3845	ebevan91	2014-04-24	I'm thinking the Mountain or Ramsay.
3846	AzorAhai42	2014-04-24	Ugh... I just hope it isn't an 'added' scene. I mean if we have to have terrible gruesomeness, can it at least be canon material? I feel like there is enough gruesomeness without adding extra gruesomeness just for the fun of it.
3847	King Tommen	2014-04-24	Don't think Ramsay is in this episode. I could see it being something in Meereen with the slave uprising. It doesn't look like that master getting swarmed by the slaves in the trailer is going to have a good time. I keep thinking back to Season 2 with the KL riots and that High Septon getting taken down in what hilariously escalated into a Walking Dead zombie kill for some reason.
3848	Mordos_Kull	2014-04-24	Could the Mountain stumble upon the Farmer and daughter from last episode, and butcher them?
Â 
I don't know if they're listed for another episode, but it would be quite tense to know that the Mountain was hot on his brother's trail, before being summoned back to Tywin.
3849	sati	2014-04-24	I heard something about threatening the little baby with the sword unless the crows that arrive to Craster's drop their swords but 1. the word disgusting doesn't fit that scene 2. it's only a rumor.
Â 
I think it's some awful sexual violence either by the mutineers or Mountain

Â 
I hadn't thought of that scenario, but it would be much more meaningful/painful than simply watching him tear apart someone we've never 'met' before.Â  Good thought, Mordos!
3851	King Tommen	2014-04-24	Dany's probably going to crucify the masters in retribution for the 163 children, right? That could get pretty ugly if they wanted it to.

But disgusting? Would they show it as such given their undying love for savior Dany? I doubt it

Â 
If I could have a wish, I would go for not only masters but also some slaves horribly dying because of the riot she started, just to start showing finally a little of the well-intended is not always well-done dynamic.
3854	Mordos_Kull	2014-04-24	Maybe Tyrion attempts to eat the sausage that Pod kept in his crotch...
Â 
Edit: OR could it be the rat eating scene?

Rat eating scene?Â 
Â 
cripesÂ
3856	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-24	I don't think rat-eating would be gory or violent.
3857	sati	2014-04-24	I don't think rat-eating would be gory or violent.


Maybe what follows is - there is a scene with scared Reek in a cage or something and bloodied, shirtless Ramsay walking in in Devil Inside trailer - perhaps he eats a rat and then some awful stuff happens? :/
3858	Mordos_Kull	2014-04-24	Did they specify what kind of scene it was?Â 
Â 
I can imagine if they wanted to make the rat eating vivid, they could show it in a particularly disgusting way, with all it's insides etc
Â 
I thought the beheading of the horse, and the slicing of the other horses's throat in Season 1 were particularly gory.

Â 
I thought the beheading of the horse, and the slicing of the other horses's throat in Season 1 were particularly gory.


All they said was that it's something disgusting and violent and that it had to be cut back a little because it was so disturbing.
Â 
Oh that was nasty. But I found things that were just implied to be so much more affecting, like scowl of Lady when Ned cuts her throat out of the frame :/ For me the most disgusting thing so far was probably Qyburn treating Jaime's stump.
3860	King Tommen	2014-04-24	Maybe what follows is - there is a scene with scared Reek in a cage or something and bloodied, shirtless Ramsay walking in in Devil Inside trailer - perhaps he eats a rat and then some awful stuff happens? :/


Â 
That scene is from E6 because Ramsay shows up at Reek's cage with his bare torso all covered in blood (most likely Myranda's) and in the scenes we've seen of Yara's attack on the Dreadfort in E6, Ramsay's got the same blood stain bare torso. I think that's Ramsay's coming to excitedly tell Reek that his sister is here to try and save him.
3861	Mordos_Kull	2014-04-24	To be fair, the rat scene probably wouldn't fit the description then.
Â 
Here's hoping it's Mountain related, as I want to see the new one in action.
3862	Widows_Blood	2014-04-24	It has to be Crasters. In the last episode Edd? said that "those poor girls, I bet they miss their father" something along those lines. We know there is probably alot of raping going on there... I hope they did tone it down, especially based on the previous episode.Â
3863	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-24	I'm betting on Craster's. ProbablyÂ a lot of violence, sex, and sexualized violence. (oh how I've missed it- it's been what, aÂ week ?).Â

3864	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-24	First things first, what I read said, they worked on 4 and 5 ep, and did not say where it was, only that these 2 guys shot it, so It isn't for sure its in this one.Â 
Â 
1 My Â thought when reading it, was Tyrion murdering 2 other characters, but that can't happen until after the Trail.
Â 
Â 2 Next would be if they shot a flash back of Elia Martell and her children, but they haven't really done any flash back.Â 
Â 
3 next would be Reek, going to Moat Callin, and bring out the Ironmen and into Ramsey and Roose's hands, but IIRC roose sent Ramsey sent them to Castle Black, instead.
Â 
4 Â next would be any number of things from Greyjoys Kingsmote, things Brienne see after she gets to back to Riverlands, Dany sees in Y, or Jaime see at Riverrun, all which are further ahead.
Â 
5 next would be Bran seeing aftermath of the RW but that seems a bit late
Â 
6 next would leaves what Tyrion sees in the Black Cells, but he is in a cell already
Â 
7 MBG is Wildlings invade Mole town. .Â

3866	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-24	I thought the scene that was watered down was the Hound Chasing scene.
3867	King Tommen	2014-04-24	I thought the scene that was watered down was the Hound Chasing scene.


Â 
The DP interviewed referenced an episode he worked on with Michele Maclaren which narrows it down to E4 or E5.
3868	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-24	Hmm wonder what that could be. Probably something with either Ramsay or at Craster's Keep.
3869	Seneti	2014-04-24	I thought THAT scene was already supposed to be the Ramsay playing in the woods with a friend scence. Now I'm scared of watching.Â  


Â 
Agreed. Mother have mercy...
Â 
My money is on Craster's Keep or something with the mountain.
3870	Welsh Wilding	2014-04-24	Doesn't the name Oathkeeper mean something? Brienne gets given this sword and has a few nasty fights. It is a bit early for this but they've moved other stuff forward and now Sansa has left she'll start her search for her.

I heard that they are going to reintroduce The Mountain with that inn keepers daughter scene. But i think they did a Â somewhat different version of it with polliver.

3874	Sirar Salih	2014-04-24	There isÂ a meaning to Oathbreaker though, it's what Lady Stoneheart calls Jaime's sword when she talks to Brienne.

Â 
Yeah, that was just speculation many had prior to the season based on the casting but obviously, the scene was only about Polliver. I don't think the Mountain is showing up until much closer to duel time, maybe the episode before.
3880	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	The Mountain has a scene in episode seven where he kills commoners that the city watch are holding in front of him while Cersei looks on. This is the scene where he is shirtless with his greatsword. I imagine this will be his reintroduction and that Cersei will be having him do this in viewing of Tyrion's cell to intimidate him and Bronn.
3881	Tyranno	2014-04-24	The Mountain has a scene in episode seven where he kills commoners that the city watch are holding in front of him while Cersei looks on. This is the scene where he is shirtless with his greatsword.

Where have you heard that? I hope they give him some more time before that. IMO, if they want to build him up properly they need to show him taking out soldiers in brutal and easy fashion. Right now, the only feats he has are killing a horse, and going at it with his little brother for 10 seconds. And that was years ago. He needs to be shown as a great warrior and not only a sadist who kills the helpless.Â
3882	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	In September (look it up on the wicnet tumblr timeline) a guy took pictures of GoT filming in Dubrovnik. We saw the clapper thing in his photos (you know that you snap and then say "action"?) and it had episode 7 written on it. Also Alik Sakharov was present. Also we've seen glimpses of this scene in trailers and the Foreshadowing feature. Gregor shirtless killing innocents and Cersei watching in her black mourning attire. This was when Lena Headey and Halfthor Bjornsson took their picture together to show their height difference. That picture is all over the internet.
Â 
From the recently-releasedÂ episode summaries we know that ep 7 "Mockingbird" is when Oberyn comes to Tyrion and says he'll be his chamption. So its fitting that its also when Bronn says he won't be his champion. What better way to illustrate that then have Bronn and Tyrion witness Gregor's beastliness?

Â 
The scene described above does that pretty admirably I would imagine. And you've now had enough characters talk about the Mountain that the audience has a good idea of what a monster he is. He's been mentioned in every episode so far this season in one form or another.Â  Sometimes less is more.
Â 
Also, which soldiers is he taking out in this scenario? There's not really anyone for him to fight at the moment.

Not sure who he should kill. But killing helpless people doesn't show that he's a great warrior. And on some other forums I've read, people don't really talk about the Mountain when talking about the best fighters because he's barely done anything.Â 
Maybe it could just be randon soldiers. Someone with weapons at least. Before all of this came to light, I kinda expected him to go after Locke, kill his men and torture him. As punishment for taking Jaime's hand.Â
3885	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	Killing the helpless folks doesn't show his powerÂ but whatÂ does is that he impales a poor peasant-fellow and then lifts the fucking massive greatsword into the air with a guy still hanging from it! He's played by a bodybuilder and he's shirtless... The point is according to the leaked photos and the shots in the trailers, people will know he's a force to be reckoned with. And I imagine the "previously-on" segments will show him beheading the horse again for good measure.

That is some fine detective work! 
I'm not sure about Tyrion and Bronn seeing it, perhaps Bronn refuses just because of Gregor's reputation. But yeah it's definitely Cersei looking at the Mountain.
3889	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^Thank you, Sati. I just can't see why Cersei would have him do that for no reason at all. That's why I think that its being done in Tyrion's sight, or Bronn's or Oberyn's to intimidate them.
Â 
I still wonder if they're going to dub Gregor's voice because if he suddenly sounded Icelandic...that would be odd. If they do Rory McCann should do it to give the brothers some consistency in their accents.

Ramsey is horny for Reek, and they tried to do a scene inspired by Deliverance. Hence it had to be toned down. No squealing like a porker.

Â 
You're welcome! I don't know much, but I do know some things, and when I do, I'm happy to share! Â 
Â 
The more I think about it, I guess it's got to be Craster's, especially after having Grenn and Edd come back so damaged.
3900	of man and wolf	2014-04-24	It might be that scene where all these people are running towards a single man..you see it in many of the promos..perhaps they just rip him apart.
3901	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^That could be a good guess. I think that fellow will be worse for wear when they're done with him!
3902	Robbie Hood	2014-04-24	I think it has to do with Brienne. I remember watching the promo for season four where she is asked what the strangest thing she's had to do...
Â 
"Biting off a man's ear"Â 

It sounds like a pretty grisly scene.
3903	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^I considered that and it could well be that, but it would have to happen pretty soon after her and Pod's leaving the capitol. So they leave in Oathkeeper, then it would have to happen in First of His Name.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 24 April 2014 - 08:32 PM.
3904	King Tommen	2014-04-24	I think that Brienne leaving King's Landing will be her last scene in the episode. A lot has to happen in the episode with Jaime/Cersei/Tyrion/Brienne and Pod before she gets sent away. We won't get any of her adventures until the next episode we see her.
3905	Robbie Hood	2014-04-24	She gets a moment in the promo so I guessed she might get some action. It'd be nice to see her being badass after mincing around KL feeling out of place.Â 
This season seems to be messing with timelines a little bit.
3906	Hound's She-wolf	2014-04-24	I wonder if the Thenns could be involved, like if they start eating children and babies.
Â 
Or if D&D move up the sack of the Saltpans, they may try to tone down some of that violence.
3907	My_Name_Is_Reek	2014-04-24	According to the article, the episode is either #4 or #5.Â 
Â 
"McLachlan worked with fellow Canadian, Director Michelle MacLaren, on the fourth and fifth episode of Season 4, titled Oathkeeper and First of His Name respectively."

3908	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-04-25	I definitely think we'll see the farmer and his daughter dead at some point. Might even be through Nymeria's eyes. Where the Hound says "maybe we should go back" and Arya says "No, they're dead already".
Â 
There is a scene like that in the books but about going back to Riverrun to rescue Catelyn, I think transferring it this way would work well for the character development of both.
3909	Raksha 2014	2014-04-25	The way they filmed that scene was terrifying especially the close up on his dogs as they chased the girl. The graphic part of the girls eating the girl alive was not shown, but showing reeks reaction to it made the scene stronger and more horrifying. implied terror and violence often works better.


Â 
Â 
Another deviation from the books, I think. Â As I remember, Theon recalled Ramsay murdering the girl; the dogs were used to track and hold at bay. Â The dogs were actually good, or at least tolerant and non-violent, to Theon. Â I'm still trying to figure out what breed of dogs were used in the filming. Â Looked like a molosser breed; but they didn't look quite like Bullmastiffs, maybe Cane Corsos, Boerbels, or Presa Canario.
Â 
I am very glad that they did not show the dogs tearing up the poor girl. Less is often more...
3910	WatcherInTheNight	2014-04-25	I think it has to do with Brienne. I remember watching the promo for season four where she is asked what the strangest thing she's had to do...
Â 
"Biting off a man's ear"Â

Â 
No way.Â  Her next scene after the bitingÂ in the books is her Lady Stoneheart reveal.Â  That would mean all fake show filler of her plot line or doing the revealÂ mid season.Â  I would think that isÂ episode 9 material (all battle with a short 5 minute scene at the end with a Stoneheart reveal) or next season.Â  Either way I think at least some of Brienne's story will be told in the middle.

Â 1 I agree that Brienne leaving will be at the end of the ep, 2 I do think we will see her thru at least couple major points of her journey, Tarly, Brave Co, and QI. but I think it will next season before we see LadySH.

Or if D&D move up the sack of the Saltpans, they may try to tone down some of that violence.


Â That why I was thinking Mole town.
3912	Konradsmith	2014-04-25	I think the raid on Mole's Town will be in episode eight. There was a shot in the "weapons and training" video that showed Ygritte fighting with a spear that said episode 408 on the camera monitor. We also caught some glimpses of her fighting with a spear (and apparently killing innocent women, wow she's gone dark, huh!) in the Foreshadowing feature. Also that woman playing the Mole's Town madame's CV which credits her as being in Alex Graves directed episodes might imply further appearances. Or it might not but if it does that would mean episode eight.

3913	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-25	Â 
No way.Â  Her next scene after the bitingÂ in the books is her Lady Stoneheart reveal.Â  That would mean all fake show filler of her plot line or doing the revealÂ mid season.Â  I would think that isÂ episode 9 material (all battle with a short 5 minute scene at the end with a Stoneheart reveal) or next season.Â  Either way I think at least some of Brienne's story will be told in the middle.


Actually the biting happens when the Bloody Mummers try to rape her, so they're just transposing her biting off someone's ear to a completely unrelated, made-up event (which will probably be a 'bastard version' of the fight at the Crossroads Inn).
And I really hope they'll be dropping some Brienne background : we know more about Talisa or Yoren's past than Brienne's in the show.
3914	Hound's She-wolf	2014-04-25	I definitely think we'll see the farmer and his daughter dead at some point. Might even be through Nymeria's eyes. Where the Hound says "maybe we should go back" and Arya says "No, they're dead already".
Â 


Â 
I'm starting to lean toward something like this, the mountain finds out about Sandor being in the area, tracks him down and finds the farmer, then kills him, (could he be the one on the Mountain's sword), and then he rapes and kills the daughter.
Â 
At this point, I think anything's possible, who knows, maybe Melisandre will start burning more people.

3915	Konradsmith	2014-04-25	We have no evidence to assume that the Mountain will show up before episode seven. I doubt we'll see him until then and IÂ really doubt he'll run into that farmer and his daughter. Halfthor Bjornsson said he was in three episodes in a muscle magazine someone on wicnet had read. So I take it that means in ep. seven for his reintroduction/demonstration of his power, ep eight for the duel and ep. ten for Pycelle and Qyburn treating him. One would hope that if we get a scene of him being treated, that Ellaria comes in and taunts him about being poisoned. I hope we see her again after the end of episode eight.

Â 
I wonder what they'll do with Ellaria's character going forward. Does she sort of fade into the background like she does in AFFC, or will she perhaps take the role of Lady Nym and sit on the small council, considering she'll already be familiar with KL?
Â 
Regardless, I think her interaction with Doran and Arianne when they present the skull of "Gregor" would be a great introduction to Dorne and it's main characters. I do hope they keep Indira Varma on for longer; she's been perfect as Ellaria in her few scenes thus far, and not to mention absolutely stunning (by far the best dressed at the wedding!). They're going to have to aim pretty high to cast Arianne!
3917	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-25	In September (look it up on the wicnet tumblr timeline) a guy took pictures of GoT filming in Dubrovnik. We saw the clapper thing in his photos (you know that you snap and then say "action"?) and it had episode 7 written on it. Also Alik Sakharov was present. Also we've seen glimpses of this scene in trailers and the Foreshadowing feature. Gregor shirtless killing innocents and Cersei watching in her black mourning attire. This was when Lena Headey and Halfthor Bjornsson took their picture together to show their height difference. That picture is all over the internet.
Â 
From the recently-releasedÂ episode summaries we know that ep 7 "Mockingbird" is when Oberyn comes to Tyrion and says he'll be his chamption. So its fitting that its also when Bronn says he won't be his champion. What better way to illustrate that then have Bronn and Tyrion witness Gregor's beastliness?

3919	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-25	Oh well, it is still an excuse for me to do a rewatch and savour Joffrey getting his just desserts again for old time's sake.
3920	King Tommen	2014-04-25	The actor playing Rorge confirmed that he would be back this season so he's probably the most likely candidate (along with Biter) to have his ear bitten off by Brienne. It tracks with the books but it would be stranger since Rorge and Brienne have never met each other on the show whereas he was one of the main Bloody Mummers trying to rape Brienne in the books so running into he and Biter again made more sense.

The other possibility is that Arya and the Hound come across Rorge and Biter late in the season (Arya is the one connected to them on the show) and this might be where the Hound gets his wound.Â  Hard to say.
Â 
Just based on location where both groups are headed (the Vale) and both groups confirmed to get into a fairly violent confrontation around that time makes me think that Arya/Hound and Brienne/Pod very well might cross paths near the end of the season somehow.

Interesting, I just assumed Rorge/Biter were cut. I think it makes more sense to have him in Arya's arc, but I suppose we'll have to see how it plays out. I kinda like the idea that Arya and Brienne would cross paths, not knowing who one another are.

3923	King Tommen	2014-04-25	So I just checked and the actor who plays Rorge's CV says he's in S4 and the directors are "various" which usually means more than 1 episode but sometimes it's listed that way because they can't be bothered to put in the actual director.
Â 
I also checked into the actor who plays Biter and on his Twitter feed, someone asks him if he's in S4 and he responded that he is so that's good to know. The guy has next to zero stuff about GoT on his Twitter feed but one of the only GoT-related things there is from back in the summer where he retweeted a GRRM quote saying that actors on the show who read the books to find out what happens to their character are sometimes shocked when the show has a completely different fate for them.Â  The fact that he took the time to retweet that quote by itself probably means it applies to him I imagine.

3928	OnlyOne	2014-04-25	I think they have 'toned down' far too much. Martins world is a violent one. HBO is not the Disney channel. But it feels that way sometimes. And I don't really care-I wish they would stick to the plot better.
3929	MelisandreTargaryen	2014-04-25	My friend brought up a good point that HBO has a history of seriously violent shows (i.e. OZ) so the chances of this being more than a rumour to get a lot of viewers is kind of high.
BUT!Â 
Devil's advocate here, this book is incredibly violent so it's possible that people who aren't familiar with the material (a lot of the actors and crew) could just be reacting like a lot of us did upon first reading. The changes they've made, and the lost of a lot of the nuances is not helping at all.Â

Agreed. Either they will meet (and not recognize each other) or they will just miss each other. Either way, it would make for great TV with frustrated show watchers yelling at their TVs "that's one of the Stark girls, Brienne, get her out of there now!"

Definitely this season, Marillion tries to rape her in the books but Lothor Brune saves her. In the show, Marillion had his tongue pulled out by Ilyn PayneÂ  in Season 1 for singing a song about Cersei killing Robert so I presume it won't be him.
3940	Rashtibram	2014-04-25	I think that article probably got it wrong, as I read an identical story two years ago which was clearly referencing her S2 attempted rape scene during the KL mob sequence.
3941	NightStark	2014-04-25	There are a lot of articles about it, not just that one. Google 'Sophie Turner parents' or 'Sophie Turner rape' and you'll see them.
3942	Colonel Green	2014-04-25	There are a lot of articles about it, not just that one. Google 'Sophie Turner parents' or 'Sophie Turner rape' and you'll see them.


All of those articles are referring to the filming of the season 2 scene (whether they know it or not).
Â 
Sansa does in fact get mildly sexually assaulted in the books at this point, too, but the "ballet" stuff is a reference to the crowd trying to gang-rape her.Â  Whether they include the stuff with Not!Marillion, we'll see -- him taking an active part in helping Lysa try to kill her would fulfill the same function, if they didn't want to do it, though per past history the show has no problem depicting attempted or successful assault.Â  Ergh, actually, if they do do that scene, I expect the recent Jaime/Cersei controversy will seriously colour the discussion of it.

3944	King Tommen	2014-04-25	Yeah, the Sophie Turner interview referencing her parents visiting the set is for the S2 King's Landing attempted rape. The reason you probably saw it resurface again recently is that she likes to tell that story a lot so it shows up in more than a few of her interviews.

It's her "GRRM asked us to tell him who Jon Snow's mother was before he let us do the show".
3945	Colonel Green	2014-04-25	Whether or not there is another attempted sexual assault, that isn't what they're referring to. This recent spate of articles are all just people discovering the old interview comment about the season 2 scene and/or misinterpreting it to refer to season 4.Â  The details are all exactly the same as the older story about the season 2 scene, from her parents being there to the talk about "ballet".
Â 
Late last year there was a whole spate of articles reporting her adopting Zunni as if it was recent news when that's been public knowledge since about 2011.

they'll probably want to play RV/Mountain up in a big way


They had a great chance to show the audience what kind of man the Mountain is. Instead of all that silly talk of chickens, Polliver could have related the story of the Mountain's men and the inn daughter (the one Arya hears Chiswyck tell in book two). It wouldn't have felt the least bit out of place considering Polliver's men were doing something quite similar at the time. Anyway, it would define the Mountain's monstrosity, add fuel to Sandor's hate of Gregor and to Arya's hate of Polliver (as it did with Chiswyck).

There's an outside chance this coming episode may have one of the biggest "spoilers"/revelations the show has yet given to book readers. The artistic corpse spirals/runes are arguably more than the book has ever given us about what the White Walkers are up to, and we may get yet more information with the baby offering.

As a woman the only problem for me with the show is excessive female nudity and a comical lack of male nudity. The disproportion is sexist. As for sexual violence, it's actually toned down considering what was in the books.
3972	go joff go	2014-04-26	How was the ramsey scene sexually violent? Â Anyway I think the scene in question is going to be the slave uprising. That seems to have the most potential for gruesome scenery, and my sense from the interview was that it was a prolonged scene with lots of shots, not something quick like a baby scene.
3973	IlAovatar	2014-04-26	do you think the show will start losing some audience if they follow Jaime's rape episode with a baby-eating episode? because if this were any show but GOT, I'd have bailed out. I'm afraid they'll only have book fans left if they show monsters eating a baby. I'm getting nervous about whatever scene this is.


Haven't show fans already seen a baby murdered in KL? It wasn't particularly graphic, but still, it's a little late for viewers to get upset about baby killing.
Â 
If anything, I would expect book fans to be more angry at the idea of the Others being turned from an intelligent and complex race into baby eating monsters.

The problem is that those events are, most of the time, narrated by X character in the books, and even when they are directly 'witnessed' by the reader, it's still less shocking considering the medium in which it takes place.

There's nothing really to suggest it's sexual in nature just because he happened to be hunting a female. He didn't pleasure himself or anything like that while watching. I think he just enjoys torturing humans.

I disagree. I find Gregor/tavern girl story and Ramsay's wedding night more disturbing than anything in the show so far.

I'm not saying I don't find the books scenes disturbing, don't get me wrong, but that scene from 4x03 shocked me more than anything from the source material tbh. I don't know, maybe it's about control : while reading the books the readers make up their own mental image of the scene, whereas in the show you have no choice but to watch what's being proposed (it's more of an "in your face" medium, if you will).
Â 
I guess in the end it just depends on people's personality.

yes he loves torturing both sexs but his hunts are always after a girl. yes he enjoys touring all humans but there is defently a sexual thing involved in his hunts.

I imagine that was a throwaway remark from the guy about toning a scene down. I'm sure they've had to tone down many scenes in the past, it's just no one said anything about it.

3988	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	I hope we get the Dreadfort next episode. I mean after all of his screentime last season shouldn't they be giving us more of Theon/Reek now? I want more Roose goddamn it!

it looks like we will not see roose again until the finale. We will seeÂ reek and ramsay in epiosde 6 when yara attacks the dreadfort, we will see them in epiosde 8 when reek treats with the ironborn at moat cailin and in epiosde 10 when ramsay and rooses forces meet up. They will almost certainly be in at least one other episode so there is still some really good stuff coming up.

Didn't we also see Theon get flayed for a bit?Â 
Â 
It's probably a very violent rape scene or very graphic dismemberment like someone getting cut open slowly while still alive.Â 
But, considering all what we have seen (and will see, Gregor cleaving commoners in half and impaling them on his sword and tossing them in the air) it might even be worse. Like someone getting raped with a knife till they die or so.Â

I think that too would be crossing the line even HBO is not gonna cross. If I were to bet, I'd say it's a mixture of different awful things happening at Craster's - drinking out of skulls, raping and violence. Perhaps also violent taking away of that baby we see being sacrificed. All of that combined sure would make for very difficult to watch scene.
3994	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	I am beginning to think that Roose's screentime will be as limited as that, Hath4. At least his scene in "the Lion and the Rose" is awesome enough to hold me over until then. But I think we'll at least see Ramsay and Reek again in episode five rather than them being absent for four episodes. I mean last season Theon was in five of ten episodes so his screentime ought to be comparable to that. I hope we get a bit more of Team Dreadfort now that they've left that torture chamber and have a little more narrative spiciness on their side.
Â 
As for what to expect in the MacLaren episodes, I think it was gore rather than sexual violence implied in that interview. And if we're to go by what the HBO schedule describes as being in each episode, neither episode four or five feature "strong sexual content".

3996	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	^Well, we'll get Myranda and Ramsay going at it. We'll also get the three naked ladies who reportedly worked with Liam Cunningham in some capacity (who I guess will be on a pleasure barge in Braavos where mayhaps Davos will find his old bud Salladhor). And potentially there will also be Carice in the bath. So yeah, very packed in that respect.
Â 
Unless of course Yara's attack goes down in episode seven instead of six, but people have been saying six around here pretty emphatically, so I'm just going along with that. If episode six IS the last time we see Team Dragonstone before their glorious arrival in ep. nine, then it would have to place Mel's bubbly time in that episode too.

3999	Hath4	2014-04-26	yeah I think she is going to die in that scene either ramsay will turn on her and kill her or the ironborn will barge in and she will die, the only problem with your theory is how would yara not kill ramsay he would be write in front of her on the bed exposed and unharmed.

Â 
Well all of the posts here do mention events that are likely to occur but, if we're referring to "That" scene I would say it's unlikely they are the culprit - by all accounts we don't get Ramsay/Myranda until EP6 ..and the scene in question will occur in 4 or 5 (leaning towards 5 whether it be CC or something else )
Â 
While there's no real evidence to my guess of Gregor and his party running into the farmer/daughter who were just robbed by the hound .. it does logically tie into a lot of the dialogue about 'I bet if they caught a look at someone as big as you they'd turn and walk the other way' etc.. and Gregor would probably be enraged to learn that "a man nearly your size, with burns on his face" already took the silver - so the 'disturbing' scene could be Gregor 'taking' the mans daughter but it would only be implied, which would be disturbing enough..
Â 
That said - we already know Gregor is going to be slaughtering commoners at some point per the season trailer, and someone had mentioned he's listed as being in 3 episodes (this is never an ironclad thing as Beric Dondarrion was 'scheduled' for one more episode last season then he appeared in) Based on how events are playing out between Oberyn/Tywin, I get the vibe that Tywin has no reason to believe that Gregor is going to be back in KL anytime soon (that'll be Cersei's doing ofc) and the shot in the season trailer of The Mountain looks to be in King's Landing (would guess earlier in the same episode as the trial by combat or the episode before)

4002	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-26	I'm pissed about the way that Cersei/Jaime scene was handled. Absolutely NO reason why that needed to be a rape scene. 
There's plenty of that in the books. We've been introduced to Ramsay, soon we'll see the Mountain, and of course we have the Saltpans (if that's all included).
Why add a non-canon rape scene? Stupid! I should be directing this show

well I have heard rumors that ramsay and yara do have a one on one fight in a room, I think that would be in his bitches kennels sense that isÂ were reek is and it would be more dramatic Â to have the fight right in front of reek. Also what is your theory on yara.

E6 sounds like this season's Bear and the Maiden Fair in terms of gratuitous nudity and sexual content. The Davos scene in particular makes no sense to me.

Â 
Of course we don't have confirmation that the Dreadfort attack will actually be in episode six, we just know that Charlotte Hope will reappear in an Alik Sakharov episode. We do know that Sarine Sofair, one of the three girls who worked with Cunningham, will be in episode six though. As for Carice that could be in episode five as well. Or episode seven depending on when we last see Team Dragonstone before they arrive.

Braavos is full of whores and courtesans. I won't be surprised if later they become regular characters for Arya and Sam/Daeron storyline for season 5 (just like Ros and Olyvar became regular characters in KL).Â
4022	Carey Snow	2014-04-26	I have a feeling it has something to do with Sansa..it was mentioned that Sophie Turner filmed a rape scene this season and with her being so young it may have been an issue.

4026	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	Yeah franko99, I wouldn't be surprised if Anoushka Kellett was the Black Pearl (if you managed to find her in your "research", she's stunning, eh?). My guess is that Davos finds Saan on a pleasure barge and tries to bring him back into the fold. I do hope we see Saan again, I really liked his scene in Valar Dohaeris. Him and Davos have a good bromance, obviously not as awesome asÂ Dave's main oneÂ with Stannis, but Davos cultivates these sort of hearty friendships.

Absolutely. Hadn't even thought about that yet.

http://www.purplerev...rape-scene.html
Â 
Definitely this season, Marillion tries to rape her in the books but Lothor Brune saves her. In the show, Marillion had his tongue pulled out by Ilyn PayneÂ  in Season 1 for singing a song about Cersei killing Robert so I presume it won't be him.


Â 
They'll probably replace Marillion with some other singer in Lysa's court. It's not like we have to know the back story to this guy to hate his guts.

A white walker eating a baby?

4028	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	^It was Carice. She's also said in interviews that we see Melisandre in the bath this season (she wasn't saying "what because I get naked", she was trying to explain how we see a more human side of Mel this season). Her hair looked dark because it was wet, but it was her.
Â 
I'm pretty sure that Sophie Turner interview actually refers to her season 2 scene where the Hound rescues her from the mob.

Yes, we need it. You know, to theorize stuff ...

Â 

Exactly! Â Â Once we get to see this scene in question we will surely be able to deduct what the future will hold for Westeros. I'm sure this scene will provide a great amount of T and A character development so we need to see a glimpse of this ASAP!

4035	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-27	It has to be the Maesters. Strapping 163 people up onto crosses is going to be sickening.
4036	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-27	Any idea where this Dany/Missandei lake bath scene fits? I totally forgot about it because there's enough Dany ground being covered as it is, judging by the remaining synopses.
Â 
Maybe 4x05 or 4x07?

With any luck, this is the scene they toned down... We need the directors cut.
4039	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	There was no sign of Dany in those set pictures. But it was in a river in Croatia. Apparently to wicnet, a pervy website called "recapped" said that that scene would be in episode 408, though I have no idea how they could have known that. I suppose since they're outdoors it could be to paint a lovely, pastoral settingÂ (with people bathing a la the centaurs in Fantasia) before Drogon goes on his spree and kills that poor kid.
Â 
Also visible in those set photos is something we will see in this coming episode, the crucifixions. If you look at the quarry where they filmed for Meereen's exteriors, you can see that they built the city wallsÂ from scratch with CG.

Is there one with Emilia Clarke in it too? You know, for strictly academic purposes.
4043	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	^No. And for Nathalie Emmanuel it's not so much a nude scene as a bum scene.
Â 
Keep in mind everyone, the scene that was toned down in a Michelle MacLaren episode is a violent or gory scene, not a sexy one. I hope it's not my fault that this thread devolved in this direction...

4044	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-27	From the preview trailer it is likely this is the killings in Mereen, but not too long until we find out.
4045	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	The HBO schedule implies that next episode, not this one, will feature graphic violence.
4046	BrettStark	2014-04-27	In the trailer we see one of the Craster rebel Crows (the one who always picks on Sam, I forget his name) offering up a baby on a hill, it only makes sense that this is the scene that had to be toned down.Â
4047	King Tommen	2014-04-27	In the trailer we see one of the Craster rebel Crows (the one who always picks on Sam, I forget his name) offering up a baby on a hill, it only makes sense that this is the scene that had to be toned down.Â 


Â 
Offering up a baby to a WW isn't graphic or disgusting. They showed Craster doing the exact same thing back in S2. If the WW were to tear the baby limb from limb and piss on its dead corpse, then that would be a problem but that's not happening so it's probably not even anything that happens this episode, likely the next one.
4048	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	^I assume it's just gore as Jon and co. take down the mutineers. Just like Neil Marshall had leave to invent gory sight gags for Blackwater and likely the Watchers on the Wall, Michelle MacLaren probably came up with some nasty killings for big fight at the Keep and some of it had to be toned down.

Â 
Meh, I don't think crucifixions have the capacity to be that bad compared to all the gorey movies released over the past few years. People being nailed to a cross doesn't sound 'too violent, disturbing and disgusting' for modern audiences in my opinion.
4052	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-27	I agree. We've had a guyÂ being repeatedly stabbed through the eye/face in 4x01; crucifixion isn't dramatically more gruesome.

Agreed. Obviously it's a disturbing and disgusting act if it happened in real life, but compared to what we see in most action or horror movies and even most of the stuf we've seen in GOT it's not that bad at all. I mean, we've seen people cut in half, get their skulls split open and crushed with rocks, heads on spikes, people getting burned alive etc.Â
4054	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-27	Maybe they show crows eating them alive on the cross or something?

Maybe if it was just one death or kind of death, but that scene looks like it will be a montage, so imagine it will be a bunch gruesome deaths tied together. Â Then again it's starting to sound like it may be he next episode so maybe it is craster
4056	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	^For those of us familiar with MacLaren's work on Breaking Bad, I hope she does a montage of some sort! It's not really in GoT's style but she is great at them.

The scene that closed out "The Climb" with LF narrating his speech over top of silent scenes of Sansa crying over missing his boat and Joffrey killing Ros was definitely a montage.
4062	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	^You're right. I hope we get another one over LF's speech this episode but maybe that's asking for too much. I really hope he name-drops the show but since they've cut Varys and Jorah doing the same thing and only had Cersei say "game of thrones" the once, I doubt LF will get to.

4064	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	^Indeed. And if he does, I hope that that's how they end the episode. It would be a bit self-aware of them but I think it would be fitting.

I kinda think Sansa/LF thing will be near the beginning. They'll probably end the episode with Jon or Dany.
4066	Arkash	2014-04-27	I dont think Littlefinger / Sansa will open the episode (if I had to bet, I'd go with KL for that, probably the talk between Jaime and Cersei) not end it (I'd,bet on Craster's Keep for that)

Wouldnt mind seeing it. Not sure how they could have captured Ghost anyway, and that cage doesnt look like it'd hold up against a very angry direwolf.
4078	ground_control	2014-04-28	So, we've heard that this episode contains a scene so 'violent, disturbing and disgusting' that the scene had to be cut down before they could use it, but that it's still ... terrible.
Â 
Your thoughts?Â  Something at Craster's?Â  The new Mountain in all his ferocious ferocity?Â  Ramsay, who's always good for a 'too violent, disturbing and disgusting' scene?
Â 
(A very funny post from WiC re this topic had one member speculating thus:Â  'Littlefinger and Lysa having sex?"Â  hahahaha


Minute-for-minute, I'd trade what we got in the North for some LF-Lysa action (I'd rather have seen the stopover at the Fingers than the made-up crap at the North).
4079	lostinasia	2014-04-28	There's an outside chance this coming episode may have one of the biggest "spoilers"/revelations the show has yet given to book readers. The artistic corpse spirals/runes are arguably more than the book has ever given us about what the White Walkers are up to, and we may get yet more information with the baby offering.


Just quoting myself to be a little smug. I didn't really expect that big a revelation, but man I was happy to see that final scene - and the added bonus is all the people complaining about how awful and inconsiderate it is for the show to spoil people.
Â 
By the by, I guess "THAT scene" is next episode? Nothing this episode seemed excessively disturbing - OK, some pretty awful stuff, but normal for this show.

Yep. They even had a crucifixion on 'Vikings' and that show doesn't even have T&A
4081	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-28	I think the white walker baby scene was a lot worse as filmed and that was the scene. I wish they would have showed it as this episode kinda sucked.
4082	House Targlannistark	2014-04-28	Dany crucifying 163 people?

Eh, I'm just kind of amazed that after several seasons of getting everything wrong, this week I managed to somewhat accurately anticipate two things: a big beyond-the-books reveal on the White Walkers (even if I obviously didn't know what that reveal would be), and Locke joining the excursion north of the Wall to get in Jon's good graces.
Â 
I assume that means I'm never going to predict anything accurately ever again.

The only things I can think of that they might have toned down would be the rape scenes at Crastor's, but given previous scenes that they have run with I can only think any really bad scenes have been moved to another episode.
4094	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-29	I think they had something truly awful happen to the baby at the end. Like that thing eating it alive or removing it's beating heart or something.

No apparently the scene is supposed to be in the fifth episode, not the fourth. I have a feeling it is what happens to the mutineers at Crasters. Possibly mauled by one of the wolves, Rast or Karl. Or just a brutal death at the hands of the NW men.
4096	lostinasia	2014-04-30	The only things I can think of that they might have toned down would be the rape scenes at Crastor's, but given previous scenes that they have run with I can only think any really bad scenes have been moved to another episode.


What I sincerely hope they will not do: an assault on Meera. That would certainly be one of the most disturbing scenes in the show's history.
Â 
Yes, I know there have been many other rapes, but watching it happen to Meera would be even more terrible.
4097	Conchobar	2014-04-30	At the same time how will they not rape her? If she is there over night? Unless they know she is highborn? Or would they even care?
4098	lostinasia	2014-04-30	At the same time how will they not rape her? If she is there over night? Unless they know she is highborn? Or would they even care?

True.Â 
Â 
Also, how did they capture Ghost, and why is Ghost still alive???? Corgman screwed the pooch with this Craster's situation.Â
4103	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-04	True.Â 
Â 
Also, how did they capture Ghost, and why is Ghost still alive???? Corgman screwed the pooch with this Craster's situation.Â 


Â 
As to how they captured Ghost, we did see him in season two wandering freely around Craster's, so it would be possible to catch him. I wonder if that wooden cage would keep him trapped though.Â 
Â 
As to why he's still alive, the impression I got was that the head mutineer seemed to think they were kindred spirits or something  . He got royally pissed when Rast said they should kill it. Could just be that he was pissed that his order wasn't immediately carried out, but that wasn't quite the impression I got.Â
4104	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-04	We any closer to knowing what this scene is going to be?Â
4105	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	What the hell is THAT scene? Was it just the raping of Craster's daughters? First of his name really didn't have any truly grisly scenes.
4106	Tyranno	2014-05-05	What the hell is THAT scene? Was it just the raping of Craster's daughters? First of his name really didn't have any truly grisly scenes.


The only thing I can think of is that is was Rast getting killed by Ghost and that they have toned it down by removing nearly the entire scene.Â 
Â 
Otherwise, it might be that the gruesome scene is yet to come.
4107	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-05	I gotta imagine the Dreadfort scenes in the next episode will be most harrowing.Â 
Â 
Maybe they were filmed and moved to that episode instead of episode 5?Â
4108	ser piggy of horn hill	2014-04-30	I think he does a great job every time I see him.

only other time i have seen him act , is in a Roman court case , when he comes up against Cicero.
http://www.youtube.c...h?v=RUcDdUG22JU
his character in this has a similar style.
Â 
thoughts on him?
4109	karna1983	2014-05-01	You have to feel sorry for the character. A Targ loyalist, who has lost everything. Then a stark comes to NW voluntarily. He is harsh on all new recruits but especially someone he pereceives as a spolit rich boy like jon.
4110	Tankbuster	2014-05-01	I love his portrayal of Thorne, really gets the badass asshole part perfectly, I enjoy him abusing kit.
4111	BlackTalon	2014-05-01	He sure knows how to act like a mean son a of a bitch. Would have made an excellent Drill Sergeant on Full Metal Jacket.
4112	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-01	Great actor. However I don't think he'd go a far as risking Castle Black's manpower to not let Jon become the Lord Commander.
4113	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-01	I actually like Show Thorne way more then Book Thorne. He's a complete ass but something about him seems kind of reasonable if not extremely bitter.Â
4114	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-01	Don't blame him for being bitter.
He was a knight with someÂ land in the crownlands and was on the battlements for the Targerayens.
Tywins sack of the city and Roberts subsequent crowning as King turned his life upside down
4115	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-01	The actor's doing a very good job of being hate-able. The show doesn't get into the backstory of why he's so hateful, especially towards Jon (for being a Stark), which is a shame. But I think he might be one of those characters whose role on the show gets expanded compared to the books.
4116	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-01	I wonder how he got on with Benjen Stark?
4117	Addam of Hull	2014-05-01	I've never been a huge fan of Ser Alliser in the books, but Teale's portrayal has been absolutely brilliant.  I hope we get a couple more scenes this season that balance his asshole-itude with some humanizing.  More moments where he and Jon are in agreement, for instance, while keeping up the antagonism Alliser is known for.
4118	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-01	I wonder how he got on with Benjen Stark?


Â 
Â 
Probably didn't.

He was Master at Arms at the wall, Benjen was First Ranger. Probably clashed very often.

4120	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-01	The actor's doing a very good job of being hate-able. The show doesn't get into the backstory of why he's so hateful, especially towards Jon (for being a Stark), which is a shame. But I think he might be one of those characters whose role on the show gets expanded compared to the books.


Â 
Even though they didn't give the backstory, I thought his speech about what happened to him when he was beyond the wall and what will happen to Jon and Sam when winter comes was brilliant and helped to give better insight into why he's the way he is with recruits, even if it's not an advisable strategy.
4121	Chilli	2014-05-01	You have to feel sorry for the character. A Targ loyalist, who has lost everything. Then a stark comes to NW voluntarily. He is harsh on all new recruits but especially someone he pereceives as a spolit rich boy like jon.


Â Wonder what he will think if he ever finds out Jon is also a Targaryen.

I have to say I appreciate the way Neale makes Show!Thorne one magnificent son-of-a-bitch!Â  Just the way the words "bastard" or "traitor's bastard" or "Lord Snow" roll off his tongue, dripping with contempt, is awesome.Â  I do wish we could have seen Tyrion torment him while they were both at the Wall. I also would have loved to see Thorne in KL's presenting himself to Tyrion.Â  It is kinda too bad that Thorne saw the inside of a black cell and Tyrion didn't see the hand moving in the jar for himself!Â
4123	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-05-02	Does anyone of you think, Ser Alliser will bite the dust in ep. 9? I'm hoping not, but we saw him in close fight with Tormund in the teaser, which will not be very healthy for him at least. So, any thoughts?
4124	Greywolf2375	2014-05-02	He's doing what Gleeson did to Joffrey.Â  Making you almost hate the actor because he is portraying him so well.Â  He's got the arrogant ass thing down perfectly, he doesn't say "Lord Snow" in a really snarky way but you can feel the contempt.
Â 
He's doing a great job.Â  He's an asshole.
4125	Daske	2014-05-02	He appeared on a UK morning TV show today chatting about playing Dylan Thomas in Under Milk Wood, opening soon I think. He came across as a really nice guy. GoT was mentioned a few times in passing, and they asked if it had changed his life. He says if he gets noticed now in a pub because of the speed of Twitter he gets decended on by crowd of GoT fans within a heartbeat.

I very much doubt it. The character isn't dead yet in the books, and given how well Owen Teale performs with Kit Harington, I doubt the producers would want to pass up on the opportunity of the roles being reversed and Alliser having to take orders from Jon.

4130	CandleWisps	2014-05-03	I adore Teale's performance. I drink it all up everytime, he's just drips contempt. He does such a great asshole, but with his story beyond the Wall he puts everything in perspective so you can't help but at least understand his motives for being harsh as fuck. And I didn't think about his reaction to R+L=J either, makes my mind wander to happy placesÂ  Â  I wonder if that would make him...appreciate(?) him more or just make him go batshit and lose his mind. I imagine many eye twitches in Thorne's future if we get confirmation
4131	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-03	I think show!Allister is way better than the book version, and most of that comes from Teale's performance. Like, you can tell he has reasons for being like that, while in the books he's just evil for the sake of being evil.
Â 
I didn't like how he decided to send Jon to his mission just so he could get rid of him. I feel that's a bit out of character for the show version, but then again, all kinds of folks were out of character in the last couple episodesÂ
4132	ebevan91	2014-05-03	He's that guy that you really like but for the wrong reasons.
4133	snowy	2014-05-04	First saw Owen Teale as Will Scarlett in a Robin Hood film and he had left a strong positive impression upon Me. When I saw he was going to be in GOT I was most pleased. He has not disappointed.
4134	Martin Lasarte	2014-05-04	I loved it when he said Qhorin was "his brother" in episode 4x01. It shows that even if he's not there willingly, and he's not very well liked, he still has loyalty for the Watch.

KL isn't exactly the most wonderful place on Earth, and if her... activities were to be found out, it'd be best to be as FAR AWAY as possible just to be on the safe side.

Also, a bit off-topic, but this thread is as good as any. It seems they're setting up some kind of alliance between LF and the Tyrells, but in the books I always got the sense that he merely used them to kill Joff and that they had no secret contact with one another. What do you think?

4144	Newstar	2014-04-27	The available cast for the KL AFFC storyline for the show is looking awfully thin, now that on top of so many of the other important AFFC players being MIA (Kevan and Lancel), they're getting rid of Olenna.
4145	doghouse	2014-04-27	I always took it that the Tyrells and Littlefinger were in on it together with the Queen playing the role of instigator in killing off Joffrey, The series makes it seems like it was LF's plan.Â
4146	Son of An Other	2014-04-28	I don't trust Littlefinger at all, and I totally thought, when I first read it, that him and the Tyrell's (or at least QoT since Mace seems to be a bumbling fool) were in cahoots. I see LF as being the ultimate at disseminating whatever plans he has for Westeros. In fact, if it were not for the Others and Dany's dragons, I'd think he would be #1 on my list of things that I'd need to watch out for. He's smart, he knows he is, and nobody except Varys (who I also think is super smart and a much more abler play of the GoT than anyone else gives him credit for) realizes this. I'm truly worried about LF's ultimate intentions and I can't wait to seem them played out (preferably in the books lol.)

In the TV series, book or both? I was talking about the books specifically. When reading, I thought it was a Tyrell plot that Littlefinger capitalized on. In the series, it feels like a Littlefingers plot that helped the Tyrells.Â
4150	HouseHarrison	2014-04-28	I never got the doubt for her involvement in Joff's death. The very first time I read LF's explanation of the assassination to Sansa and they talked about her being there, I immediately thought it was an actual confirmation by GRRM she did it.

Â 
Yeah this was probably done purposely in case non book readers still hadn't connected two and two about the necklace yet and how the poison got from the necklace into Joffrey's cup. I'm guessing they felt the original scene was too subtle and most viewers probably missed it.
Â 
I too was hoping they'd change the storyline to keep Olenna around longer since they've changed it up for other characters coming and going when they weren't at KL in the books. But since she knows she might be suspect eventually it's probably obvious she should leave now. She gave Margaery the big clue so now we know Margaery really didn't know anything about the poisoning.

That being said, I'm happy to see a pivot to Marg vs. Cersei more directly, rather than Marg and QoT being snarky all day 'er day.
4160	The Monkey	2014-04-28	It seems strange that Margaery wasn't in on it, or at least knew about it. I mean, what would've prevented her from accidentally drinking from Joffrey's cup during the wedding? Maybe Olenne slipped her some antidotes before...
4161	Bungholes First	2014-04-28	Fan favorite character leaves on the very same episode that reveals she was involved in killing the most hated character? I can't see any reason not to bring her back. She should be there for Tywin's funeral at least.
4162	Hoo	2014-04-28	I thought Marg would be more offended by the fact she is/was a pawn in QoT's game.

Â 
I think Olenna needed Marg's reaction to look natural. Book!Marg definitely knew about what was going down, but because Show!Marg had a separate cup, keeping her in the dark was to her benefit. When Olenna did the poisoning, there was already attention on Joffrey's cup (Tyrion being his wine-bearer), so she probably assumed Marg wouldn't suddenly drink out of it.
4164	Mos	2014-04-28	In the trailer, wasn't Grandma Tyrell seen in the scene where Tyrion is led into the throne room for his trial? Or maybe that was just another old fart with the same hat.
Â 
If she does leave King's Landing for now, I really hope she'll be back next season. Tywin's wake or the marriage of Tommen and Margaery seems like the best fit for her return.

It was just a hamfisted reference for show viewers. I discuss this show with people every Monday morning who have not read the books. It's staggering the amount of things they miss that seem plain as day. They need to be smacked right in the face with things most of the time.
Â 
Why would Olenna have a chain created just to hold a key...you're looking way too deeply into that one. It's not like any of the kings guard are proficient at protecting kings there. Marg probably walked right in.

The main purpose of her character has now been fulfilled. Having her stay until after Tywin's death already felt a bit extraneous in FFC.
With no Olenna breathing down her neck anymore, this will probably help Margaery develop further into a more stand-alone character.

I've been wondering about the whole necklace thing. In the show, they made a big deal out of Olenna providing Margaery with just the right necklace, much like Sansa was supposed to wear another necklace, for obvious purposes.
Â 
IIRC, in the books (possibly in the show as well) Melisandre has a necklace (or "choker"?) that protects against the Strangler. Since the show made it clear that Margaery was not aware of the poisoning plans (this may be different in the books, it was not confirmed either way so far) of her grandmother, I wonder if Margaery had to wear that particular necklace because it would protect her. Otherwise, Olenna would have taken one hell of a risk of poisoning her darling granddaughter by accident.

I'm down with that! I would be surprised if we don't see the QoT again. Diana Rigg has done such a fantastic part with the role, and they probably would want to use her where they can.

Yeah. She's fabulous. And has had the best original lines of the TV show. Tyrion has great lines but most of them were actually in the books.Â

100%! Though I'll admit I was sad during the PW that we missed out on her "I do so hope he plays us 'The Rains of Castamere.' It has been an hour, I've forgotten how it goes." Still, they've done a great job fleshing out the Tyrell ladies. Very excited to see Marg vs. Cersei starting next episode, and I'll be curious to see what they may have in store for Olenna moving forward.
4190	Titan	2014-04-28	Â 
If you're right then that'sÂ OVER-doing it.Â  That connection had been made when Olenna said "oh but I do".Â  The chain tug struck me as meaning something else.Â  I was thinking the key to Tommen's chambers or something.


Â 
It can hardly be "OVER-doing it" if it wasn't clear to you!
4191	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-04-28	Well if I was her, I'd be ready to get the hell out of Dodge as well. KL isn't exactly the most wonderful place on Earth, and if her... activities were to be found out, it'd be best to be as FAR AWAY as possible just to be on the safe side. Littlefinger's speech about his motives can also directly apply to the QoT as well imo.


There you go. Makes perfect sense to me.
4192	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-28	After this episode I'm kind of hoping they send her to Vale and she takes over the Myranda character and has scandalous conversations with Sansa.

4194	Shebara	2014-04-28	I've been wondering about the whole necklace thing. In the show, they made a big deal out of Olenna providing Margaery with just the right necklace, much like Sansa was supposed to wear another necklace, for obvious purposes.
Â 
IIRC, in the books (possibly in the show as well) Melisandre has a necklace (or "choker"?) that protects against the Strangler. Since the show made it clear that Margaery was not aware of the poisoning plans (this may be different in the books, it was not confirmed either way so far) of her grandmother, I wonder if Margaery had to wear that particular necklace because it would protect her. Otherwise, Olenna would have taken one hell of a risk of poisoning her darling granddaughter by accident.


Â 
cool idea! I always wondered how the poisoning could be done without risking Margaerys life!
4195	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	Â 
Because it suggested something else.


Doesn't it suggest that she also fiddled with Sansa's necklace and took the stone at that moment? I feel like you're reading into it too much. Sometimes the show has to spell things out for the viewers a little more than the books do. I really didn't find it to be that "over-done" anyway.Â

Â 
Yeah I agree - they did that to 'spell it out' more for viewers who probably missed the clues before and during the wedding feast. Sure, Littlefinger goes on to admit the necklace was poisoned but a lot of viewers aren't going to connect Littlefinger to the Tyrells as conspirators unless they make it blatantly obvious. They don't want her to 'say it' (that's why she shushed Margaery) - but they want the audience to have their "A-ha!" moment. I think it worked fine. It was probably only 'over done' to those of us book fanatics who already know it all and don't feel the need to be bashed over the head. Unsullied don't have that prior detail.
4197	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-29	I am going to miss her but I feel that she has already exhausted her repertoire of witty one-liners and any more would just be too much. All she does is take leisurely strolls through the very same garden and suck IQ out of anyone she has conversation with.Â
4198	Roose Seal	2014-04-29	I'm glad she's gone. While I liked the actress, I thought her dialogue was terribly overwrought, broke the fourth wall too often and was not nearly as clever as the writers thought it was.

It was LF's plan. He just made Olenna think it was her idea.


Â 
I didn't get the impression that Â Olenna had any problem with the 'Kill Joffery' Plan, or that LF had to do any real heavy lifting to get her on board with it.Â

Â 
Right, that's always been Littlefinger's tactic - find willing partners who already have motivation to do what he wants. He even says that to Sansa in their talk on the ship when she's questioning his motives and calling bullshit on him. He tells her that he doesn't want clever friends (though I would argue Olenna is quite clever), he wants easily manipulated friends who are good and happy with their reasons. He capitalized on the fact that Sansa confessed Joffrey's true personality to Olenna and Margaery and arranged to have Joffrey disposed of before he could do the same to Margaery. As Olenna tells Margaery - there was no way she was going to allow that monster to put his hands on her the way he had Sansa.
Â 
Olenna's motives are not only for her granddaughter's safety but also so that the Tyrells can move forward in power. She's basically the female version of Tywin Lannister.
4203	Iralius	2014-04-30	I will miss her like hell. I wonder if she'll take on Willas' or Garlan's role in the future, when Euron attacks the Reach


Â 
I wasn't even thinking that but now that you mention it... I have an image of Ironborn storming part of the Reach and Olenna back in a camp, in a suit of (mocked-up, foam and etc.) armour watching with pursed lips. "This wouldn't have happened if we were something other than a rose."

This ^^
4205	Skore	2014-04-30	I'm actually surprised they left out Littlefinger asking Sansa if she remembered anyone coming to adjust her necklace (hairnet) in their little chat. Would have been quite a good comeback for Petyr to give Sansa when she called him out on his BS.
4206	VladimirDulud	2014-04-30	Â 
I hope. But I'm going to miss her dearly. The One True QueenÂ  
Â 
Also, a bit off-topic, but this thread is as good as any. It seems they're setting up some kind of alliance between LF and the Tyrells, but in the books I always got the sense that he merely used them to kill Joff and that they had no secret contact with one another. What do you think?


Â 
It seems odd that as a single agent, LF has the range and flexibility that he does, within a relatively strict power structure.
Â 
Or perhaps it's because he's backed by no one that he generates that dexterity?
Â 
The Tyrells seem opaque to me. More light is shed on them in the show than in the books, and we're all the better for it.
4207	VladimirDulud	2014-04-30	Â 
It cues that Olenna did it, sure.Â  But that was well established with her line, "but I do".Â  The chain tug was extraneous and I think, misleading.Â Someone who was only a show viewer would've had to take note and rememberÂ Olenna playing with Sansa's chain at the wedding to place that connection.Â  Otherwise, they would have to know from the books or from a book reader.


Â 
It's called a visual echo. Many filmmakers do it, especially film noirs, to draw subtle parallels between objects and actions in a film. It's a neat little trick that should jog the audience's memory on a subliminal level.

Â 
This would be great! I hope we get something like this in TWoW, like the perspective of Euron's attack of Highgarden from Olenna's POV. We could see HIghgarden and Willas at last, and maybe even know more about the past, like who was the Targ Olenna was supposed to marry and other interesting tidbits. And it would be hilarious, I bet
4209	Lord Damian	2014-05-01	Since the show does not have Willas or Garlan existing at all and the iron born seemingly in the opening stages of a full scall invasion of the Reach, it possibly suggests willas and garlan are expendable which is a big clue as to the fate of highgarden in the near future books.
4210	FNF	2014-05-01	Honestly, I don't see the Ironborn-Reach conflict amounting to muchÂ before any possible intervention from Dany or Aegon, although I can see the Tyrells being wiped out at some point just like the Gardeners.

Either wiped out or becoming Norther refugees like the Manderlys. 
One possibility I have been entertaining is that Loras found out about the threat in the North when he took Dragonstone and discovered them mining dragon glass. I do not think he is injured, I think the Tyrells are plotting their next move, so needed to give Loras an alibi to stay away from KL. Their next move might be a move on the North with LF but against Stannis.
That might result in them being around for the fight against the Others. That in turn might win them some northern concessions just as they are losing their holdings in the Reach.

I liked the idea of the Tyrell's learning about the threat at the Wall, but I suspect that Margaery would have wanted Loras to be her champion.Â  Loras pretending to be near-death puts his sister at risk, which does nothing to strengthen them.

I think the Tyrells might have a false sense of security about the trials because they don't know the Faith has an agenda and the evidence against Margery is weak. So they would not request trial by combat at all, feeling conviction is impossible.

You actually bring up a good point here that small changes to the plot in the show is now leaving some odd plot holes from the books. In the books Loras is gravely injured, otherwise he would have definitely been the one to fight trial by combat because he's a very good fighter. But in the show he's perfectly healthy and there at KL to see the whole thing -- how will they change the story around to address his part in this with the Tyrells?

I never said it was. I was looking forward and speculating on how they'll change the story further since Loras is not injured. It's only a slight change that probably won't have any serious consequences. They'll focus on Oberyn wanting his revenge.

Oberyn dies way before Loras gets injured though. Oberyn dies in SoS, and we hear about Loras' current predicament in aDwD. I'm sorry but the phrasing of your statements/questions are confusing me
4222	acosta	2014-05-03	Loras doesn't get injured until the siege of Dragonstone after Stannis leaves, after Tywin dies, after Tyrion escapes. There's no reason at all to think that won't happen in the show.

Exactly. We don't know if the show will claim Loras is injured, late next season or not.
The ideas here are different: ie. that in the BOOKS Loras is not actually seriously injured. We only have the word of Aurane Waters after all, the same man who a few short weeks later stole the royal fleet. So why believe his account of what happened on Dragonstone?

Ok I'm definitely way out of sequence in that book then ... time for a re-read because this wasn't the first time I'd forgotten events and timeframes.

4226	boojam	2014-05-04	I don't like they are getting rid of the QOT already. Margery doesn't have her cousins, at least no speaking ones. I never understood why GRMM had the QOT disappear in the book either. Do you think they will have the QOT return in the show?Since 'spoilers' is on this thread.I kind of wonder what they do with Olenna's arrangement of Tommen and Margaery's marriage. I would think that after three marriages on-screen they would take that one off screen.Olenna is sure is there in Crows which kind of rounds out her arc at KL. She goes back to Highgarden then. That could still all take place this season. Weither she appears on Winds or Spring only GRRM knows.I miss Jaqen more , even with the very brief appearance in Crows.I just thought Tom Wlaschiha was perfect, hope he turns up next season.
4227	mjc5156	2014-04-30	I've been reading this forum for a few years now, figured it was about time to finally make my first post. I've seen a few posts about the possibility of Sandor Clegane living beyond his book expiration date (if you in fact believe that he is dead, but this is another topic for another post) and wanted to throw my theory out there.
Â 
Instead of suffering a mortal wound in one of the upcoming episodes to which Arya responds with the gift of mercy, I think it's a feasible modification to keep him alive to aid Arya in her travels to Bravos. He mentions to Arya (I believe s4e01) that he intends to make for Bravos and join up with the Second Sons. He stays alive and assists Arya in getting to Bravos at which point they split up. Arya will not want to leave Bravos as she has the coin from Jacquen and will not agree to join up with a company of sell swords instead. The Hound will continue on to meet up with and join the Second Sons both as a form of work to keep him alive and as a mechanism for vengeance by fighting for the opposite side of the Lannisters, and in turn the Mountain.
Â 
The Hound becoming a Second Son could serve a couple purposes in the show. First, since Barristan the Bold was identified by Jorah almost immediately and thus no retaliation from Barristan telling Dany that Jorah has been spying on her for Varys, the Hound can replace Barristan as the one to reveal Jorah's spying to Dany. 
Â 
This would also serve to replace some of Strong Belwasâ<U+0080><U+0099>s role â<U+0080><U+0093> first when Belwas smashes in the teeth of Ghael (the envoy from Astapor). Due to his similarly massive size and strength, Sandor can also replace Strong Belwas by eating the poisoned locusts intended for Dany. Once Dany leaves he can remain in Mereen with Ser Barristan, setting up a potential meeting between the Hound and Tyrion down the road.
Â 
Weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen multiple instances on the show of D&D replacing actions of a minor character with a major character that we have already been introduced to (e.g., Gendry replacing Edric Storm) and this change could serve as a similar mechanism since we have no Strong Belwas (L) in the show.
Â 
What are everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s thoughts?
4228	JonSnow1234	2014-05-02	If Arya leaves for Bravos in the last few episodes of the season then there will not be time for him to make it to Mereen for the Jorah reveal as that is likely to come at the end of this season as well, apart from that I quite like the idea, mostly because I don't want the hound to lose screen time.
4229	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-02	I support this. The Hound's departure in the books is one of the biggest disappointments. I imagine he could also be the one to locate Tyrion. That is just another theory. I would love for him to continue with Dany.
4230	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-02	Interesting ideas, but I have to wonder........if Dany's firebreathing lizards might put a damper on The Hound's willingness to serve with the Second Sons, ever, LOLÂ
4231	darksellsword	2014-05-02	I would like the hound to live on longer than he appears to in the books but the problem I have with this is , most people mix up gregor and SandorÂ 
He knows the brotherhood without banners accused him of being involved with killing the "Targaryen babes" as soon as he finds out the second sons
are fighting with Daenerys Targaryen he will avoid her like the plague.Â
4232	Envie	2014-05-02	Interesting ideas, but I have to wonder........if Dany's firebreathing lizards might put a damper on The Hound's willingness to serve with the Second Sons, ever, LOLÂ 


Â 
Yeah... I have a feeling the Hound would take one look at fire breathing dragons and say "Fuck that cunt, I'm going home."
4233	DaveyJoe	2014-05-02	Not to mention Dany would probably roast the Hound for his brother's crimes.Â  "The house of Clegane was built on dead children:"Â  Dany's niece and nephew.
4234	AlienTwo	2014-05-02	So we have seen in the previews for this upcoming episode
Â 
Preview Spoiler

	Spoiler  Arya stick Sandor with Needle in the gut.... 

Â 
In my opinion, it is still possible for the remainder of Sandor's jurney to be able to mirror what happened in the book fairly closely, maybe Arya's doesn't kill him out of lack of will instead as an act of hate, leaving him to escape across the narrow sea to encounter
Â 
Book/Season 4 Spoiler

	Spoiler  Tyrion as he flees from the scene of his dead pops.Â  He could follow Tyrion to Pentos and down to the battle waiting outside of Mereen, giving us plenty more HoundTime in the show, as he is very popular.Â  I don't think he can ever meet up with Dany as a friend though, the Targeryen's aren't going to be fond of House Clegane, for obvious reasons.

Well if Arya had anything to say about it, she'd make him work with Bran and crew - which would definitely put him in cooler climates. The White Walkers are another matter altogether and I don't think anyone wants what they're offering with "Winter is Coming" and all... a nice toasty fire might be preferred.
4237	Le Cygne	2014-05-02	He has his own story.  He is Team Stark.  He hates fire.  He hates Tyrion.  I could think of more, but... Don't see it happening.
4238	Green Hand of Gardener	2014-05-02	I feel it was mentioned as a reminder to the audience about mercenary companies across the Narrow Sea, following this scene was Davos mentioning the Golden Company. Also acts as a way to have Arya mention that she wants to go to Braavos.
4239	Kaspiro	2014-05-03	So at this point there are two ways Sandor's storyline could continue: he does not 'die' at all (which I find possible but unlikely, given how significant a deviation from the books it), or that the show creates a new death for him (akin to Rakharo's new death in the Red Waste).Â The Hound joining the Second Sons would be interesting, given that he could join Daenerys. I'm not sure I see it happening because a) it is a significant deviation like I said above and b)It seems like Daenerys would already be fairly prejudiced against House Clegane, but I could definitely see the appeal and thought process behind it.
Â 
Thinking of potential new 'deaths' for Sandor, I can't help remembering that Sandor is currently journeying to ransom Arya to Lysa Arryn in the Eyrie. Though he definitely won't be making this transaction, to get to the Eyrie he would have to travel through the Mountains of the Moon.Â My personal theory is that Sandor and Arya travel through the Mountains of the Moon, and meet with Shagga and his Stone Crows or some other clan chief and clan.Â I'm pretty sure a fair portion of the show-only audience still recall the unique, comical mountain clans from Seasons 1 and 2. I don't think, at this point, re-introducing them would be particularly difficult.Â Â Sandor is unable or unwilling to negotiate with them and wins the fight against them but is wounded. Arya leaves him to 'die', as before, and the story continues on as normal. Arya could easily travel to some Vale town (perhaps Gulltown, even) to get on a ship to Braavos, and Sandor could plausibly make his way to the Quiet Isle from the Vale. It would be a fairly good opportunity to bring back some well-liked characters (I'm sure more than a few people wouldn't be adverse to seeing Shagga again), and stay consistent with the storyline.Â
4240	CandleWisps	2014-05-03	If Snador did travel with Arya across the Narrow Sea, then continue on to the Second Sons, it would be a nice tie-together factor of Westeros/Essos and minimize multiple roles down into one to prevent having to cast more people with an already tight-ish budget. Personally, I don't see it happening because of the reasons mentioned above (fear of fire, Dany will in no way be positively predisposed towards a Clegane, etc.). That doesn't mean its impossible, and IMO it might be better than following book canon. After the "Hound" dies, we just have the gravedigger and nothing else. So far in the book material he doesn't do anything and we just have theories as to when he'll go off to rescue Sansa or what have you. If they were going to follow book canon (and assuming gravedigger=Sandor), it would be probably be a 'waste' of budget to follow around the guy with a suspicious identity for awhile with no plot direction. IMO they'll either completely deviate his story/mix it with another/or the OP's Second Sons theory or they will kill him off for good. They can't really just have him sort of hang around, not when there are other people to cast and spend money on, etc. So I wouldn't necessarily mind you sellsword idea as it gives him screentime and ties the different continents together, but I also wouldn't mind or be surprised if they give him another purpose
4241	FNF	2014-05-03	I would like the Hound to stay on-screen. I don't know how they can do that though but this doesn't sound like a bad idea. The only problem is the timing as the 'Jorah was a spy' reveal will happen pretty much when Arya sets sail for Braavos imo.
4242	Newstar	2014-05-03	I feel it was mentioned as a reminder to the audience about mercenary companies across the Narrow Sea, following this scene was Davos mentioning the Golden Company. Also acts as a way to have Arya mention that she wants to go to Braavos.


Â 
Same. Bryan Cogman mentioned that he threw in Olenna's little anecdote about her Targaryen betrothed to remind the audience about the absolute power the Targaryens once held in Westeros. I expect that the writers were trying to do something similar with the mention of Braavos and the mercenary companies. Because the storylines are so disparate, I think the writers will do whatever they can to draw connections where possible.

I'm sad to say that though I'm really really really hoping they will show jon and aryas warging abilities I don't think they will, they may just keep that for bran also I read a post on here a couple days ago about someone seen in a interview that it's been cut...which will really suck!

...it seems pretty important that Jon gain the ability to warg in the stories. Â I don't see how they can cut it. Â Is there a source?

They've been distancing Jon from Ghost since last season. While he's with the Wildlings Ghost is nowhere to be seen and not until this season do we even find out that Ghost is 'imprisoned' all this time at Craster's (which to me seems stupid). In the books Jon has a very close bond with Ghost (as did most all of the children to their wolves) - seems pretty lame they've not even mentioned Ghost all this time or had Jon think about or mention him. This distance, to me, shouts loud and clear there's no warging bond between them, not even in dreams.Â 
Â 
In the books Jon was the one most often denying his warg abilities even when Sixskin tells him to his face what he is.Â 
Â 
I don't know why they want to drop it for Arya and Jon - it really helped define their "Stark side" whereas Sansa and Robb seemed so much more Tully and less warg-like.

I can't remember where I read it but I believe it was in the breaker if chains thread. BUT I said the same thing as you I'm hoping that jon somehow wargs soon even next episode lol.

Yea exactly, I was thinking maybe D&D feels like it would be to much "magic" going on or whatever but they haven't hinted at it, he hasn't had any dreams or nothing, like WHY would they not include jon and aryas warging abilities? I believe aryas may be important down the road.

Â 
I'll believe it when I see it. Â Even in the books, Jon doesn't gain the ability to warg until Bran 'opens his eyes' so to speak. Â That's why it seems like such a prime opportunity in the show with everyone together in the same place (and the wolves, too). Â

I think we're all impatient to a degree XD Â I know I was upset that they didn't kill Joffrey last season...but when it came so early this season, I was so, so happy. Â I feel the same about Jon and all of his story, too...I can't wait to see his rise to leadership and ultimate betrayal (and whatever comes after that, if anything), and the suspense just kills me sometimes, lol.
4254	Bran Snow	2014-04-29	I understand there is a cost of doing the CG for the wolves and that is a reason they are not around alot but a simply line of "Oh I wonder what Ghost is up too" or something like that wouldn't cost anything. Jon just doesn't seem to notice or care about Ghost

Â 
Not only that but it is extremely relevant to their character arcs and not just their personalities. Arya constantly seeing through Nymerias eyes in Braavos is important during her FM training. With the exception of Needle and her hit list, Nymeria is the only connection to her past and her identity as a Stark. Because of these things she can't commit herself completely to the Faceless Men.
Â 
But also I can see them not including Jon's warging because of what another poster said. Browsing through some of the Unsullied forums and the comments on some other internet articles, there were many Unsullied who became annoyed at the Oathbreaker episode with baby-turned-icicle simply because there was too much magic. A lot of these people watched GoT for the political drama and are testy at the use of "funky fantasy voodoo". But hello, you should have known there was magic the moment dragons were mentioned. But that could possibly be a reason D&D havent branched out into the other Starks warging abilities: they are trying to retain Unsullied viewers and focus on the politics

I think it's one of those things that you don't introduce until it becomes necessary to the plot. Â It hasn't been necessary to the plot yet for Jon OR Arya. Â It's not so much about magic, it's about keeping the story as simple and streamlined as possible. Â There's only an hour to tell several different concurrent stories, and if you try to push too much too soon, you drive viewers away. Â Arya's not even left for Braavos yet, and Jon's warging abilities were not even important until he became LC in the books, so I don't think there's any rush.
4257	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-30	They could introduce Jon's ability to warg Ghost this season. The situation is actually set up for it. Ghost imprisoned and Summer there and Bran. Jon needs a little poke in the Third Eye and BAMMO.Â 
So who knows! Maybe thats how Ghost gets out of the cage for all we know. Its gotta come up eventually cuz its a pretty big part of Jon's story.

Â 
  Bless you. This line of thought seems to be something many book readers who watch the show seem to ignore. Sort of like the Blackfish in my opinion. Everybody was all in a rage when he wasn't cast in Season 1, but at that time he wasn't extremely necessary and there were other characters and plotlines that needed to be fleshed out first. Just because something doesn't happen right away in the show does not mean that D&D forgot or chose to ignore it, it could simply mean that with a limited budget and time-frame one has to make priorities for the story as a whole
4259	Slade7	2014-04-30	When do you think we will find out about jon's ability to warg with ghost on the tv series?Â                                                      Season 1 episode 1

While I think that it sucks that they won't be showing their warging abilities or the dreams, I feel that it makes sense for the show. They already have so much information and character building that they have to portray within a small amount of time, that including something that isn't a major plot point in the books is just too much. I have some friend who haven't read the books and after each episode they have to ask me to clarify some stuff because the tv show moves so quickly. They could understand it if they re-watched the episodes but 'aint nobody gto time for dat!'
4261	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-04-30	I just posted something like this. I'm sad to say that though I'm really really really hoping they will show jon and aryas warging abilities I don't think they will, they may just keep that for bran also I read a post on here a couple days ago about someone seen in a interview that it's been cut...which will really suck!


Â 
Â 
I often thought the same...they want this to just be Bran's special skill. Makes me disappointed, but what can you do?
4262	titanx5	2014-04-30	What got me in this episode was how the hell did those NW mutineers catch a Ghost, and why would they give a dam about a Direwolf? Does it feed them?No!Does it protect them? No, difficult to protect anyone in a cage. However I dont think we are going to see Jon ever have warging abilities, unless he does warg into Ghost. But I think that may confuse the unsullied as look he havnt seen Arya warg at all in the series, cause then they will say why cant Sansa warg into animals. So think they will make only Bran have 'magical abilities' from the Starks
4263	ovis alba	2014-04-30	Might be they first want to establish it further. So far it's sort of thought to be a special ability for Bran, but maybe Bran at some point will learn that this is something that has to do with his heritage and once they have established this as the cause of the ability you see it coming up also in the other Starks. I think it might be an easier transition for the viewers and Jon could for example learn it from wildlings once he is in contact with them again or when he really has the "need" for it.
Same for Arya, she might just notice her ability when she is somehow under pressure to use it.

Possibly next season? After chilling with Bloodraven and the CotF for awhile the topic could come up and then we slowly start to see the impact on Jon and Arya

Â 
I'm bad at guessing the timing, but I think it makes sense. Jon can learn it from the wildlings when they start to be around and Arya will discover it in Bravoos once she is alone and needs "support" in some way.
Â 
Just from the "flow" it seems to make sense to me. Warging is not that new but it's pretty specific for Bran at the moment and he is also the only one that really "needs" it for his story right now. So I think it sort of does make sense to make people more and more used to warging, the rules and possibilities of it and then at some point it's revealed why Bran can do it (because he is a Stark) and I think then it will be easier to introduce it to the other storylines without explaining much where it comes from and how it works.
4266	ViennaGirl	2014-04-30	I think Jon will accidentally warg and he'll hate it and it will freak him out but it won't be a major part of his story on the show. I hope it happens in the next episode during the Craster's scene. Â

Â 
Same way they caught Summer- in a trap. Â They may not be ordinary wolves, but they aren't immune to capture, injury or death. Â I wondered why the mutineers would even keep him alive, but there are several good reasons to keep Ghost alive.
Â 
1. Hostage - they know that he's Jon's wolf and how much he cares about Ghost, so he makes a good hostage
2. Alarm - Ghost can warn them when enemies are coming (yes, I know he's mute in the book, but he's not in the show)
3. Food - sort of a 'last resort' sort of thing, but they'll run out of food eventually and it's better to keep him alive until then

I agree I sort of feel like it's being set up for this next episode with both of them there and both wolves.but could be too early.
4269	dbunting	2014-04-30	I am hoping Bran shows Jon how to warg in the next episode. In a way to let Jon know that Bran has to keep heading North.
4270	ToTheWolves	2014-04-30	Also someone pointed out in the " who wants bran and jon to meet" thread that jojen & meera are with bran so if R+L=j  holds any truth can't really even see them crossing paths with jon and not saying anything. So maybe jon will have just missed bran.
4271	MaximumPatlickicus	2014-04-30	When they were reunited in the book, almost as soon as Jon passed under the wall his connection to Ghost was reestablished. Maybe the next episode can open with that. He walks through the gate, has a brief dizzyspell/eye roll and a glimpse through Ghosts eyes. not much, just enough to see that he's in a cage and with Summer.. then Jon re-awakens with a new sense of urgency to get to Craster's... *shrug* at least that's how I'd write it.
Â 
Â 
I agree though, it makes almost no sense for the mutineers to keep ghost around. I chalk that one up to TV drama.
Â 
Â 
edit: oh ya, and coldhands shows up, kills everyone and frees bran and co. so that Jon and Bran never actually meet.

4272	ToTheWolves	2014-04-30	2 scenarios...
Either the writers needed the mutineers to have ghost locked up, to give summer a reason to not be around when bran & co were captured 
Or!
They need jon,bran,summer & ghost all in the same place to set up for some warging...or even if no jon warging into ghost takes place maybe ghost is going to still save jon at some point.
4273	dbunting	2014-04-30	And BTW, Ghost is not mute in the books, he is just quiet. He does specifically growl and bark at times.
4274	Slade7	2014-04-30	And BTW, Ghost is not mute in the books, he is just quiet. He does specifically growl and bark at times.in the books when they first found the dire wolf pups only jon snow could hear ghost even tho there was a whole group around ,Thought that was interesting. I think that jon was the first to be "magically connected" with his wolf and that's how he heard him and the others didn't. I'll take your word for it that he barks and growls other times but is it from Jon's perspective or someone else's?

Bran warging into Summer, which then is revealed to Jon who wargs into Ghost would be pretty epic for the coming Craster fight scene I have to admit. I don't think it's going to happen (at least not Jon into Ghost) but we'll see I guess.Â 
Â 
I guess I never really felt like Jon's ability to warg into Ghost was as important in the books as Bran's ability was. For Jon it seemed like a side thing he denied and maybe that itself was important for some of his character development much later after the ending we're left with in the last book.Â

Lol I'll be honest most of me wanting to see jon warg in the show comes from me personally just wanting to witness unsullied reactions. I have a couple of moments like this the other being when stannis reaches the wall and when lady stoneheart is revealed. Lol I'm counting in it being epic lol
4277	'96Buck	2014-04-30	Also someone pointed out in the " who wants bran and jon to meet" thread that jojen & meera are with bran so if R+L=j holds any truth can't really even see them crossing paths with jon and not saying anything. So maybe jon will have just missed bran.


Just because their father would know doesn't mean they would.Â  It's a pretty big deal.Â  Ned never even told Jon, so it's not hard to imagine it's less important in the Reed family.

Â 
Even if Howland does know I doubt he would tell Jojen because of the repercussions that come with a surprise Targ. However, Jojen see's a lot through his green dreams and has explicitly stated that he has seen some of Roberts Rebellion as well, so it's no where near out of the realm out possibility that he is aware of R+L=J

4280	Natasi	2014-04-30	I think, out of the remaining Stark children with surviving wolves, Nymeria is the least likely to be warged on a regular basis. Arya shoo'ed her away to protect her. She has now established herself as the matriarchal head of her own wolf pack, tearing up the Riverlands. She, of all the wolves, will remain mostly an individual.
4281	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-04-30	If D&D don't include Jon's and Arya's warging abilities, they should be shot into space.

4284	Tixu Oty	2014-05-01	I'm certain that Jon and Arya's warging abilities will be introduced sooner or later in the show, because it'll HAVE to come into play down the road, if Varamyr taught us anything....
But, I don't think we are getting much of it this season. It could be though, since there has already been hints to remind us that there are wargs around: Orell this season, and now the Thenn warg, whose only other purpose is probably to be burned out of the sky...
If Jon gets to meet Jojen or Meera, they can drop him a hint. I don't think Bran would teach him anything, since he doesn't seem to be aware his siblings are all wargs too.
But mostly I was thinking it would be Melisandre who would be in the best position to let Jon know that he's special and should nurture that strong connection with his wolf. There may be a few additional hints, but I don't think it will be made super clear untill Jon is forced to warg into Ghost "for the Watch". This way the viewer can get the idea little by little that yeah, Arya and Jon are wargs too.

1) why would they give a rats ass about keeping a hostage specific to Jon? Â They just killed the LC and are drinking out of his skull...they're not really in a "lets negotiate" position.
2) Ghost could warn them...if he chose to. Â Why would he make any noise at all?
3) so they are feeding him to keep him alive to eat him? Â why not kill him and put the meat in the same place as Craster did?

I'm certain that Jon and Arya's warging abilities will be introduced sooner or later in the show, because it'll HAVE to come into play down the road, if Varamyr taught us anything....
But, I don't think we are getting much of it this season. It could be though, since there has already been hints to remind us that there are wargs around: Orell this season, and now the Thenn warg, whose only other purpose is probably to be burned out of the sky...
If Jon gets to meet Jojen or Meera, they can drop him a hint. I don't think Bran would teach him anything, since he doesn't seem to be aware his siblings are all wargs too.
But mostly I was thinking it would be Melisandre who would be in the best position to let Jon know that he's special and should nurture that strong connection with his wolf. There may be a few additional hints, but I don't think it will be made super clear untill Jon is forced to warg into Ghost "for the Watch". This way the viewer can get the idea little by little that yeah, Arya and Jon are wargs too.


Â 
Actually, those are very viable possibilities, and would make sense.
Â 
This coming Sunday at Craster's: I think Bran and Jon will be a near miss. But I do think it would be perfect if Jojen gets to speak with Jon in the confusion, and tell him to his face because he sees/senses what Jon is, but doesn't have a clue. He could also get Jon's connection to Arya, and see that Arya is as well, (how cool would it be to discover Lyanna was as well.... )
Â 
I think the biggest disappointment would be for Arya/Nymeria not dragging LS out of the river.... and we meet LS after all the magic happens to her, and we end up having it told to us next season by Thoros & Beric.
Â 
I do think they've set up this season for Jon & Arya warging quite effectively - both the Bran warging Summer sequences have been very direct and clear - we could have another one of those moments, only it's Jon and/or Arya waking from them and being shocked out of their minds.
Â 
It would be perfect for Arya this season in ep10 - Nymeria drags LS out of the river, and when she's scarred off by Thoros and Beric, it's Arya who wakes up Â - shocking the audience - then we straight into LS's rez - and it's the end of the season.
Â 
If that happened, they could awaken Jon next season so it's not too all at once.
Â 
Still - I just want them to get to it already, and not skip it. It seems too big a part of their characters and story arcs to cut. (I hope.)

Â 
If Jon has any hope of surviving the ADWD cliffhanger, they're going to haveto get to his warging ability eventually.
Â 
Me personally, I'm in the camp that wants Jon to stay dead -- not only would it create endless implications and start yet more bad blood between Stannis and the Night's Watch, to me, the biggest tragedy ever written would be if Jon never got to learn who his parents were. Granted, we could, but him as a character dying before it's revealed, is justthe kind of heartbreak and tragedy George would love to inflict on us.
Â 
That's just good writing, in my opinion. Jon should stay dead. If he returns, let it be a wight, not an Other. I'd even accept that, as his undead mindlessness wouldnt comprehend information granted to him.

Â 
I was very much hoping for a similar scene, but in episode 1 or 2. I think last episode a character mentioned (Cersei to Jaime??? can't remember) that it's been weeks since the red wedding. There's no way the writers would allow Cat to have stayed in the rivers that long, and we know they don't do flashbacks... So I'm pretty sure we won't see that now.
Â 
As for Jon and/or Arya waking from wolf dreams, it would be awesome indeed. But I can't imagine D & D wanting to shock us with that info. I'd say they'd rather hint on it lightly for a time till it becomes semi-obvious. Only after that, do I see them showing us the wolf dream.

Agreed, thats why I'm guessing they are going to wait until after possibly addressing the subject with Bran, informing viewers that it can be an inherited trait in Starks, then slowly branching out in future seasons to Jon and Arya

The way I understand this topic, is since the show hasn't done the direwolves/wargs justice so far compared to what it is in the books, how do they go from there?
4293	Talking Hodor	2014-05-02	Â 
Â 
Well yeah - imagine a trained assassin who can also warg. Wow. 


Nobody suspects the kitty-cat.Â  Hell Arya could pop in to visit Cersei at the top of a long flight of steps, spook the bejesus out of her, and warg Ser Pounce into standing right behind Cersei so that she falls down the steps.
Â 


What got me in this episode was how the hell did those NW mutineers catch a Ghost, and why would they give a dam about a Direwolf? Does it feed them?No!Does it protect them? No, difficult to protect anyone in a cage. However I dont think we are going to see Jon ever have warging abilities, unless he does warg into Ghost. But I think that may confuse the unsullied as look he havnt seen Arya warg at all in the series, cause then they will say why cant Sansa warg into animals. So think they will make only Bran have 'magical abilities' from the Starks


I think they're keeping him in order to have something to eat once Craster's larder runs dry.Â  Or he had been in that cage since they were on friendly terms with Craster, and nobody has the balls to let him out now.Â  Or they're trying to tame him into doing their bidding.Â  He is a wight killing machine after all.Â  Or, they think Jon's gone over to the wildling side and are trying to remain on his good side by not killing Snoopy... I mean Ghost.
4294	Talking Hodor	2014-05-02	Just because their father would know doesn't mean they would.Â  It's a pretty big deal.Â  Ned never even told Jon, so it's not hard to imagine it's less important in the Reed family.


Jojen can read minds.Â  Even if his father intended to keep the knowledge from him, he may have revealed it in his sleep.Â  Also, I have a feeling that Howland Reed tells his children a LOT more than Ned Stark told his.Â  They know about the tournament and Lyanna.Â  They live on a floating castle surrounded by alligators and Vietcong highly trained Crannogmen and have never been conquered.Â  I think they're pretty safe.

4296	Slade7	2014-05-02	can't remember which seasons which Actually
4297	Bowen	2014-05-02	...it seems pretty important that Jon gain the ability to warg in the stories. Â I don't see how they can cut it. Â Is there a source?
Â 
To me, Bran being so near to Jon seems the perfect opportunity to awaken that ability, but we will see.Well let's just see how utterly stupid D&D can actually get because if they don't have Jon as a warg then they take so much of his story ie him being part Stark albeit not from Eddard,I must admit I did wonder about this as he was having wolf dreams in the books way before here,hasn't GRRM confirmed that all of the Stark kids are Wargs?
Some of it looks to me like they are trying to take credit for their own writing instead of Martins,it's no coincidence that the first series that stayed true to the story was the best,it's not rocket science is it?GRRM story can't be improved on so why change it?

Â 
can unsullied even name the direwolves? with the exception of Ghost, and Summer, since theyre sooo apparent, what's Arya's wolf's name? and Sansa's? Robb's? Rickon?
Â 
I know we know. Next episode, here's an experiment, trivia the people you watch it with. See if they can answer. I bet they can't. And I know I'm right
4301	Areo Speedwagon	2014-05-02	I think it's one of those things that you don't introduce until it becomes necessary to the plot. Â It hasn't been necessary to the plot yet for Jon OR Arya. Â It's not so much about magic, it's about keeping the story as simple and streamlined as possible. Â There's only an hour to tell several different concurrent stories, and if you try to push too much too soon, you drive viewers away. Â Arya's not even left for Braavos yet, and Jon's warging abilities were not even important until he became LC in the books, so I don't think there's any rush.


Â much this.
Â 
Â 


They've been distancing Jon from Ghost since last season. While he's with the Wildlings Ghost is nowhere to be seen and not until this season do we even find out that Ghost is 'imprisoned' all this time at Craster's (which to me seems stupid). In the books Jon has a very close bond with Ghost (as did most all of the children to their wolves) - seems pretty lame they've not even mentioned Ghost all this time or had Jon think about or mention him. This distance, to me, shouts loud and clear there's no warging bond between them, not even in dreams.Â 
Â 
In the books Jon was the one most often denying his warg abilities even when Sixskin tells him to his face what he is.Â 
Â 
I don't know why they want to drop it for Arya and Jon - it really helped define their "Stark side" whereas Sansa and Robb seemed so much more Tully and less warg-like.


Â 
This too.Â 
Â 
Though I think it also has to do with the visual medium of storytelling that has to happen in television.Â  Maybe I'm giving D&D too much credit, but I think it's thematic that Ghost is locked up.Â  The Direwolves represent The North, and the Starks themselves.Â  Having Ghost in a cage is maybe symbolic of Jon denying his Stark-ness in favor of the Nights Watch.Â  Similar to Arya, who has been without her connection to the North and her Stark-ness, Needle, until very recently.Â  I think the distinction is important though.Â  Jon chose to enter the NW and put his Stark-ness behind him.Â  Arya's situation was out of her control and so was Needle (and therefore her Stark-ness and further her identity) being taken.
Â 
I think maybe Jon will get reunited with Ghost next episode (or later) and, as he seems to be growing into himself very nicely this season, will learn that saying an oath doesn't un-make who you are.Â  You can't "lock up" your identity without consequence; that foresaking your claim to lands, titles, and not fathering children doesn't negate the lessons you learned from your family or your childhood experiences.Â  That sort of legalistic interpretation of the NW vows is pretty immature, but very much in line with an angry, bastard, adolescent Jon Snow.Â  But now he's growing up.Â  We may (again only visually) see Jon accept his childhood and Stark-ness (through the Wildlings' seeing Jon as "The Ned's" bastard) and realize it only makes him more complete. Â  So when Stannis offers him Winterfell, he can deny it for the right reasons, with a full understanding of the offer and the reasons for his decision.

That's interesting. How do you see that going down?
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
I see it most likely going down one of two ways: either through Jojen or Bloodraven.
Â 
To individually introduce warging in either Jon or Arya might take up too much time in the show, or it could confuse Unsullied audiences who arent aware that warging can be an inherited trait. As book readers, we know the importance of the blood in the Starks and their connection to their direwolves, but Unsullied might not exactly to jump to that conclusion. It makes more sense, to me at least, that D&D will want to somehow include in the narrative that Bran's warging into Summer isn't completely unique, and it fits the pacing of the show better to have an explanation to Jon/Arya's abilities before they actually mature into their power.
Â 
So to me, it seems more likely that either Jojen or Bloodraven will inform Bran more in-depth about the origins of his powers before we see Arya and Jon use them. Since the finale is titled the Children, I'm assuming we meet Bloodraven and the CotF there, which means after the escape from Craster's Keep we have episodes 6,7, and 8 (9 I think will be strictly reserved for the Battle at the Wall) of possible traveling time for Bran and Co to do nothing but talk. It would be a perfect opportunity for Jojen to inform Bran that warging comes from his blood. However, if this doesn't happen, and assuming D&D don't choose to cut Jon/Arya abilities (which I don't think they will, theyre too important), then this information will likely be presented to audiences through Bloodravens tutelage in Season 5.
Â 
It just seems to fit the pacing of the show IMO to already have Unsullied audiences prepared for the possibility that the other Starks are magical before hitting them with a oh-what-the-fuck-Jon's-eyes-are-white-what-is-happening-omg-magic that could confuse them

Â 
Personally, I don't think its a bad thing. I would love to see Unsullied audiences go wait-what-the-fuck. And before last weeks episode, I wouldn't have thought that they needed to set up anything for audiences to realize what might be happening to the Starks could be related. However, after Oathkeeper aired, I read comments here on the forum, and on other places like WinterisComing, etc., where the Unsullied were still confused about Olenna's involvement in Joff's death. Even after all the connections that were made, some people still just didn't get it, which surprised the hell out of me. To me, at least as a book reader, there has been plenty of material in the show for Jon or Arya to start warging. But if people can be confused by Olenna's involvement, it doesn't make me overly optomistic that they can tie all of the Stark kids' magical abilities to their bloodline.
Â 
Also, maybe them introducing it slowly in dialogue could benefit other areas of future material too. Having actual narrative proof of the fact that Starks are definitely not normal (supernatural attachments/connections) opens the door for Unsullied audiences to be more accepting/not as confused when the show gets around to possibly hitting us with things like the Nights King, Bran the Builder, etc.
4307	ToTheWolves	2014-05-03	Also brand pointed out that summer is hurt
And hodor is hurt also...what do you think can come from this?
4308	Whipsy	2014-04-28	So, combined with the fact that they've aged Tommen up quite a bit and the Margaery (eye-fuck) Tyrell scene that we had in this episode, is it safe to assume that they are going to have Tommen consummate his marriage with her? Would that not throw off a certain dynamic with the Cersei/Margaery trial later? Cersei uses claims that Margaery's marriage is invalid with Tommen since she is no longer a virgin and Tommen isn't old enough to consummate their marriage yet. Plus, all of the infidelity accusations with various singers and the like. Will Cersei instead use a different track in her quest to dethrone and behead Marg? Or will they still try to post-pone consummation?Â
4309	north of the wall	2014-04-28	Maybe they will claim she had slept with people prior to the mariage and use the moontea as evidence since it can be easily be claimed to have been consumed prior to the mariage? But I was thinking the same thing actually. 
Surely he cant be that old though? He is still Joffery's younger brother and Joffery was meant to be 15-16 in the show wasnt he?  Making Tommen 13-14?
4310	Charles Phipps	2014-04-28	I'm sure they'll deal with that when the time comes.
4311	averde	2014-04-29	Meh I don't think it'll be a hard thing to avoid doing. Just have Margaery keep acting like a mom and giving him a kiss goodnight, have Cersei not allow it, etc.
					
					
							Edited by averde, 29 April 2014 - 03:32 AM.
4312	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	I think they will postpone it still, he cant be any older than 14. But they will probably keep up the tension so tomnen is under marg's thumb and still despised by cersei
4313	ovis alba	2014-04-29	I have the feeling Margaery kissing him on the forhead already gave a pretty good indication, how they wanna play it.
On screen I actually like this "OMG there is a girl in my room and she's sort of hot" shyness of Tommen and Margaery using it. The books concerning age especially still feel a little more cruel, so I don't know if it would have worked there, but for the show I almost prefer it over the younger Tommen who doesn't have any clue.
I asume Margaery will keep it at the "You are the king and we do just what you feel you really want to and we don't have to tell the others, if you don't want it yet, it's gonna be our secret" level and Tommen is too shy to "make a move" on her and I think this can work out just fine.
4314	King Tam Stark	2014-04-29	Knowing 14/15 year old boys it will be Tommen telling anybody who will listen that he nailed her....even if he hasn't.
4315	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	The prospect of consummation should be there only for the Unsullied, no? Once Tywin's dead, no-one is going to order this kid to make babies. There's nothing to indicate that the sweet little Tommen at the age of 8, admirer or kittens, will be all about pussy and weed once he hits puberty. Personality-wise, with an over-protective mother and a hyper-intimidating grandfather and an erratic, sadistic big brother (who also gets all the attention all the time), the table could be set for him to be sweet little Tommen for the rest of his life. Margaery might try and fail, this is easy enough to accomplish with Cersei's wrath
4316	ovis alba	2014-04-29	Knowing 14/15 year old boys it will be Tommen telling anybody who will listen that he nailed her....even if he hasn't.


His friends (if he had any) probably, but I doubt he would tell it to Tywin like this and if he does I can't wait to see it.

Â 
Yeah me too. But I'm pretty sure the "birds and bees" talk was done intentionally to lead the viewers into the bedroom scene. Everyone now knows what's going through Tommen's head (or something) while he's sitting there under the covers and a hot chick sneaks into his room to tell him "This will be OUR little secret.... " with a whole lot of big eyed suggestiveness. So if they don't consummate it will be even more dramatic for viewers because they've been led to believe in two scenes now it's going to happen. Also, Margaery's been a Queen non-consummated THREE times now. That's sort of the running joke. They can't do away with that! Â
4320	Raksha 2014	2014-04-29	I think they will postpone it still, he cant be any older than 14. But they will probably keep up the tension so tomnen is under marg's thumb and still despised by cersei


Â 
I thought that TV-Tommen is supposed to be 12; which is a little young for even a Westerosi boy-king to be consummating a marriage, I believe.
4321	Brewmaster	2014-04-29	Are they going to even have Marg marry him? I don't think having that marriage is necessary for the plot. I suspect they will just announce it as a betrothal until Tommen comes of age. Then carry on as usual. The populace will still think of Marg as their Queen, even if she's just the Queen in waiting and Cersei will still be trying to wrest control away from her.Â

I think this is possible but unlikely. They did show Tommen's coronation in the previews but there's been no hint of a wedding and Margaery's even quoted asking her Grandmother if it's even going to happen because "no one tells me anything" or something like that. Olenna doesn't really confirm it either. However, if she stays his 'betrothed' it gives Cersei way too much power and that's not going to work for the story arc at all. We're supposed to see the power struggle and her downward spiral out of control. If she's still the 'defacto' Queen and Margaery's reduced to 'fiance'' then she can easily be gotten rid of whereas a truly married Queen cannot.

Â 
Why/How does that give Cersei any more power?
Â 
Cersei automatically has less power due to the simple fact that Tommen is older and can be expected to make some amount of decisions on his own. Marg's power always came from being the popular choice for the smallfolk and her influence on Tommen.Â 
Â 
How does Cersei have more influence than in the book, under this circumstance?

I think thats there to tease us, and that Tommen learns about such things, but doesnt necessarily understand them.Â 

Â 
is it safe to assume that they are going to have Tommen consummate his marriage with her?

Highly,Â highlyÂ doubt it. In fact, i think Marg is going to take on the whole Cool Big Sis role because poor Tommen is too young to manipulate inÂ that way. Marg realized that during their chat. Its "oh this kid is nothing like his brother. Omg. Hes just a kid, literally. Welp..shift gears here.."Â 
So..

Â 
Cersei still had plenty of power even when it was Joffrey and Sansa was his intended bride instead of Queen... she influenced a lot of his opinion and treatment of Sansa and it made Sansa easily disposable. Margaery is a much different kettle of fish, obviously because the Tyrells and Lannisters have forged an alliance (thus the marriage and power are more implicit) but it still gives Cersei the upper hand until the day Margaery is married and becomes the 'official' queen. That power struggle between them was very important in the books. I doubt they'll want to change it and NOT have Margaery and Tommen marry. It doesn't really make any sense.

Â 
 Â  It would be stupid of the showrunners not to have this particular power dynamic between Cersei and Marg in the show as it becomes extremely relevant to Cersei's loss of sanity. Margaery just doesn't weild the same kind of power and doesnt threaten Cersei's influence if she remains unmarried to the current King. So yes they'll most likely marry but remain unbedded because that would be a major risk by D&D (unless they know something further down the line that we don't).

From my perspective, as the original poster, it wasn't a complaint. I wasn't sure so I was curious and asked for some opinions. I didn't know if Margaery would have been examined by Pycelle prior to her marriage (though maybe it happened before her wedding to Joffrey) and therefore after consummation there would be no proof so I was wondering if people thought they might go a different angle, that's all. Though I could easily see how the adultery angle could still play out. I have my own opinions but it's no great, "Hey! Why the fuck is it happening like this? I hate this show! I'm so confused...." Just simple curiosity. Sorry for any self-righteousness.

Why risk Margaery getting pregnant with that demon spawn? Worse, what if he was abusive even on their wedding night?

I think her timing was perfect... they're married but no worry of harm to Margaery if he dies immediately. Desperate measures for desperate times. Let's not forget who was pulling the strings behind Olenna's motives anyways. Littlefinger has a way of convincing people that what they want is most important even if it's what he wants instead.

With Littlefinger the man behind it it probably explains the timing as it creates more chaos.
4338	SeventySeven	2014-05-01	The Margaery/Tommen scene was meant to be creepy in a similar way to Tyrion or Littlefinger with Sansa. I think that because it's not a girl who's been manipulated people are being way too lenient and deducing things that are not meant to be there. He's still a kid.
Â 
Tommen likes Margaery in the books a lot, with an older Tommen they'll maybe play more of a crush on his side, but it's all still going to be about Cersei vs Marge.

Â 
I think Olenna loves her granddaughter a lot as she's poured all of her energy and work into grooming her to be the perfect Queen. She's not going to risk her that far - nor would she want a Lannister spawn in the family. After it was revealed by Sansa just how terrible he really is (I'm sure they know about the prostitutes / Roz incident too) there's just no way Olenna is going to risk Margaery consummating with Joffrey at that point IMO. No, he probably wasn't going to kill her, but who knows what he might have done to celebrate his wedding night - Joffrey was completely off the hook by that point.
Â 
Another angle you can look at is Littlefinger's motives for having Joffrey die at the wedding instead of afterwards. LF wants chaos because it creates opportunities. What's more chaotic than having the king die right there in front of his entire wedding party and guests? Now the entire realm is in shock either celebrating or questioning who is going to be in power. Most know so long as Tywin's in charge, not much changes but still - opportunities abound now and that was Littlefinger's entire motivation. If he can get Margaery (and the Tyrells) squarely in a seat of power then he himself holds a great deal of power. With Joffrey, as he said to Sansa in the ship scene, he's not a very good or predictable ally to have regardless of his evilness. LF doesn't care that he was cruel, he cares that he was unmanageable.Â 
Â 
Littlefinger's chaos speech explains exactly why Joffrey had to die in such a dramatic way.Â

Let me guess, you hate AFFC and have never actually read it? Yes, they get married in AFFC. Cersei gets barley-able-to-stand drunk and Jaime is creeped out by her burning the Tower of the Hand after the reception. He is commanded by Cersei to stay inside the "Honeymoonsuite" and oversee Marg and Tommen not doing anything but play with kittens.

The whole point is the Tyrells don't want to be tied to the Lannisters if things go poorly. Marg's maidenhead is worth a lot, and offing Joffrey/having her marry Tommen ensures that she'll still be in a Queenish position, but have a few years to get out of it if the tides turn. The Tyrells are not the most loyal bedfellows.

After seeing all the posts and thinking about it, this seems pretty correct. I wasn't quite sure how old he's supposed to be now in the show and there was the fact that Tywin expected Tyrion to consummate his marriage with 13 year old Sansa, so I didn't really know what was up for grabs concerning sexual situations and teenagers but I think that you're probably right and they will still keep the marriage unconsummated. Also, thanks for everyone's opinions and ideas, it's really great to be able to finally discuss such a great series. My boyfriend is so sick of hearing about it.

FYI the GoT wiki says he's about 12 in S4 (despite being 8 in S1, but who's counting). I think it matters not...they're going to remain unconsummated. We just may see less of Marg's babysitting wiles that she uses in the book and more of her feminine wiles.

Actually, I think the main difference between the Lannisters and the Tyrell is that, while both families are ruthless polictical schemers who are intentionally active in the Game of Thrones, the Tyrells do actually love each other instead of trying to backstab each other every day. Think of it this way: If you plant two roses next to each other, they grow and intertwine making it even harder to pluck them without drawing blood. Lions... if you put two male lions in the same pride, they'll be at each other's throats and the winner will eat the loser's babies.

4349	juanml82	2014-05-02	It may happen off-screen and the accusation remains an accusation of adultery. Or it may not happen because Margery doesn't desire him, thinks he can better manipulate him by keeping him wanting and Tommen isn't assertive enough besides being nervous and unsure due his age.
Â 
That said, I'm trying to imagine a reason why my twelve years old self wouldn't have wanted to bang Natalie Dorner and I'm coming up with nothing.

4352	Iron Maiden Islands	2014-05-02	I think it will play like this:
Â 
Tywin arranges the betrothal of Tommen to Margery.
Â 
After Tywin dies, Cersei will tell Tommen "Good news, you don't have to marry that wicked little bitch from Highgarden!"
Â 
Tommen says "Well, I like Margery and I'm the King now so yeah I'm actually still going to go ahead and marry her when I come of age."
Â 
This is when Cersei will start plotting against Margery. Not sure how they do it with the Kettleblacks not being in the show, but they'll figure out something.

This is a good guess as to how they will play it out. Margaery and Tommen will keep their 'little secret' (which will remain innocent, no sex) and that's the power Margaery will keep over Cersei for their ongoing battle to come.
4354	Guardian of the Neck	2014-05-03	I can only think of a top from season 1 : stick'em with the pointy end  XD
4355	Skeksi	2014-05-03	So with the reveal that it was the Olenna and Littlefinger tag team that are behind the murder of Joffrey why did Olenna not wait until the marriage was consumated?


Â 
Given that a big part of the reason that Margaery was eligible for marriage to Joffrey in the first place is that her marriage to Renly was (apparently) unconsummated, I suspect because it makes it easier to arrange a betrothal between Tommen and Margaery if she doesn't sleep with Joffrey first. Killing Joffrey after the marriage is consummated only benefits Margaery, and the Tyrells as a whole, if she gets pregnant, and how long do they wait? The chances of him impregnating her on the first night of their marriage are slim, even assuming that both of them are fully fertile and able to have kids, so how long does the Queen of Thorns let her granddaughter stay married to Joffrey before offing him? Hell, Jon Arryn was in his 50s before he had his first living child, and on wife number 3. Olenna isn't Tywin or Littlefinger, she is a very adept politician indeed, and very ambitious, but she seems to genuinely care about her family members- some of them, anyway- rather than simply the family name, or playing the game for it's own sake. The show seems to confirm that a big part of Olenna's motivation in poisoning Joffrey was looking out for her own.

Looking at a historical parallel, Katherine of Aragon originally married Arthur Tudor. After he died, she married his brother, later Henry VIII, but it took years before that came about - several reasons for this, but partly because she had been married to his brother and there was some discussion over whether Katherine and Arthur's marriage was consummated. A man marrying his brother's widow was considered to be going against the church, but if their marriage was unconsummated, then one could argue that they were not truly married, and thus Katherine would be a suitable bride for Henry. Now, off the top of my head I don't know if there is a similar law in Westeros- indeed, the faith of the 7 seems a lot less powerful (until AFFC) than the church in mediaeval Europe, possibly because there are several other religions in Westeros that they have to coexist with. But given the value put on a woman's "purity" in this society, I would expect that a widow who has been bedded by her previous husband is considered a less suitable potential queen than another noble born virgin. The Tyrells might have still been able to wrangle a marriage with Tommen- there are some doubts about Margaery's "official virginity", after all, even before she marries Joffrey, and the Tyrells are still important allies, but why risk it for a possible pregnancy and almost certain abuse for Margaery?
4356	Kaspiro	2014-05-02	In the books, Sandor is left to die after being wounded at a tavern fight, one which happened without any tangible consequences for him in the books already. I imagine that their are two ways Sandor's storyline could continue now: he does not 'die' at all (which I find possible but unlikely, given it completely eliminates Sandor's 'redemption'), or that the show creates a new death for him (akin to Rakharo's new death in the Red Waste). Thinking of potential new 'deaths' for Sandor, I can't help remembering that Sandor is currently journeying to ransom Arya to Lysa Arryn in the Eyrie. Though he definitely won't be making this transaction, to get to the Eyrie he would have to travel through the Mountains of the Moon. Now, I'm sure many in the show-only audience still recall the unique and somewhat comical mountain clans from Seasons 1 and 2. I don't think, at this point, re-introducing them would be particularly difficult. So my prediction is: Sandor and Arya travel through the Mountains of the Moon, and meet with Shagga and his Stone Crows or some other clan chief and clan. Sandor is unable or unwilling to negotiate with them and wins the fight against them but is wounded. Arya leaves him to 'die', as before, and the story continues on as normal. Arya could easily travel to some Vale town (perhaps Gulltown, even) to get on a ship to Braavos, and Sandor could plausibly make his way to the Quiet Isle from the Vale. It would be a fairly good opportunity to bring some well-liked characters (I'm sure more than a few people wouldn't be adverse to seeing Shagga again), and stay consistent with the storyline. Thoughts?Â
4357	Nordeast	2014-04-29	The first scene of an episode would start out with a flashback to a young Tyrion meeting Tysha on the road, falling in love, and marrying her. Â Then it would show the ending (unfortunately it would have another you know what so the tumbler and salon activists will probably be calling for it's cancellation), then it would fade into Tyrion sitting in his cell with a tear on his cheek, right before someone comes in and tells him that Shae has been found and will testify at his trial.

4358	jewelybrook	2014-05-01	I have been thinking about Tysha too. I think Shae could sub in for her. Shae actually gets away and Tyrion heads off to find her. No testimony and she doesn't die. "Where does Shae (the whore) go?"

Why do we need to see Tysha? We already got the full story in Season 1, and she's been mentioned/alluded to a few times since.
4360	salmonsnake	2014-05-01	Have they ever utilized flashbacks on the show?

Never. They filmed a flashback of Aerys killing Brandon and Rickard, but decided to exclude it.
4362	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-01	Tysha so farÂ has pretty much been a symbol and an explanation of Tyrion's issues. The character in itself isn't important, it's what she represents for Tyrion that matters, and I doubt we will ever see her in any form whatsoever (as it's been speculated by some).
So no there's no need to have a flashbach or anything of that sort. Tyrion's telling the story in season 1 and the conversation with Tywin prior to his death is enough.

Â 
I agree. Tysha is the biggest (but not only) reason why Tyrion's so messed up inside. Tysha cannot be Shae, but that's not to say her story should not figure into how the Shae situation is resolved. Tyrion is not a "light" character, he is someone who's good and bad sides are routinely in conflict; he's psychologically broken, and has been for many years.
Â 

	Spoiler Perhaps if Shae were to find out the real role Tyrion had re: Tysha, this may cause her later behavior at the trial & beyond. I am waiting to see if the show is willing to "go there", because that would be very harsh territory, even for HBO.

Â 
I don't think that we need to see a flashback, but I hate the idea of Tysha being nothing but a symbol for Tyrion. I really hope (and always have) that Martin will either show us or at least tell us what happened to her afterwards; my preference is that she actually shows up. I always wished we could see the story from her perspective; but even with the little we get to know of her, through Tyrion's POV, makes her a really tragic character.
Â 
(book spoilers for A Storm of Swords all through the end)

	Spoiler Just imagine,you're a 14-year old girl (in the book, they didn't specify her age on the show, but she would probably be a little bit older to match show Tyrion's age of 16), a commoner left orphaned and alone (even if she had been a prostitute, which she was not, would that have been something bad for a young girl who likely had no means of survival?), with no one to help you and the road full of men who want to rape you. But then you meet those two highborn guys who are, incredibly, actually nice to you and genuinely want to help you. (Even more unlikely - they're Lannisters, sons of the high lord who's ruling Westerlands, who you would never normally hope to ever talk to....Tysha even has the Lannister-like name on "Ty". Is this some fairytale?) The older one, a handsome knight, genuinely protects you as knights as supposed to do and chases away the would-be rapists. The younger one, a boy of your age - not what most people would consider attractive, but sweet, smart and funny - takes you to an inn and buys you a dinner, and you eat, talk and laugh together, and have a wonderful time - and you end up in bed and you lose your virginity to him. But he's not trying to take advantage of you, he really loves you and wants to marry you! You get married and spend two weeks of happiness and young love all on your own. (I was convinced that Tysha really loved Tyrion since his flashbacks in his last POV chapter in ACOK; she seemed completely genuine, just like a teenage girl in love, and very much unlike Shae and her interactions with Tyrion.) Everything is too good to be true.
Â 
Until the dream turns into nightmare when your father-in-law, the mighty Tywin Lannister finds out. He declares that, as a commoner, you cannot be his son's wife, you must be a whore. And then... I can't imagine what it would be like to be gang raped by some 20 men. And that all happens to a 14-year old who's lost her virginity two weeks ago. To add insult to injury, they throw coins at her after raping her, to drive it home that she's considered a whore. In the end, her father-in-law forces her husband to rape her, too, to make sure their relationship is forever destroyed. And she's given a gold coin for being his "whore", and only then sent away.

Â 
How did she survive and cope with such a terrible trauma? How did she make a living afterwards? Is she still alive? Has she emotionally recovered? I want to know these things. That girl deserves to have her story told.
Â 
And really, we do need more small folk perspectives in the story., especially small folk women.

4365	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-01	@ Annar Snow : Don't get me wrong, I'm really interested in what happened to her (and think it would be nice to find itÂ out), and I'm definitely empathetic towards her and what she's been through.
However, yes, I don't think GRRM meant for her to be thought outside of Tyrion's narrative (not unlike Shae). It can be seen as yet another case of 'women suffering for the benefit of male tears', which it is, but it being Tyrion's story and Tysha having nothing to do with other aspects of the narration lead to her beingÂ under developed.
That's the problem : having small folk pov would be nice, but completely unrelated to the general narrative, as they never mingle with highborn characters, who comprise most of the main characters.
Â 
If we ever 'see' her, all I hope is that she isn't getting back in any way with Tyrion, that would be just plain wrong, imo.
4366	acosta	2014-05-01	She's an interesting character for sure, but at some point, you really do just need to let Rosencrantz and Guildenstern disappear into the periphery where they belong. You can't fully explore and develop every single minor character. The story is bloated enough as is. It's time to go ahead and kill off a few more POVs and tighten the focus. He already has to resolve the major storylines that matter: Bran's continued training and the answer to what his purpose is, the resolution to Littlefinger's plot to retake the north in Sansa's name, the battle for the north between Stannis and Bolton and Davos returning with Rickon, Cersei's trial and the future of the crown, Aegon's attack through the Stormlands, where the Martells are going to finally find an alliance, whether or not the dragonhorn works, is Daenerys ever heading west? Those are just big plot points, and he has barely even begun to introduce the single more important plotline: the attack of the Others. Then you have a whole bunch of loose ends to tie up that probably matter but we don't know why, like what the hell is a Faceless Man doing in the Citadel? Why is Tom O'Sevenstrings in Riverrun pretending to serve the Lannisters and Freys? Then he has to resolve all the storylines that probably don't matter but we want to know anyway just because the characters has been around forever and we want to know what happens, like is Stoneheart going to kill Jaime Lannister? What becomes of all the red wedding hostages? Is Randyl Tarly up to no good?Â 
And frankly, even Tyrion himself is not a player any more. The Second Sons were turning for Daenery with or without him. It's not clear he is still going to have any meaningful impact on a major plotline at this point. We just want to know what happens to him because he's an original POV and popular with the readers, but he probably could have been executed back in Storm of Swords without it making any difference to who ultimately sits the throne, who ultimately controls Winterfell, and whether or not the Wall fails and whether humanity survives winter and the Others. That's the story at this point, not what becomes of Tyrion's ex-wife from twenty years ago. There's already way too much to wrap up, and as far as we know, GRRM is already still introducing new POVs and new geographical settings. It has to end eventually.Â
4367	Seneti	2014-05-01	I don't think we'll get flashbacks. I do, however believe that we will get a conversation between Tyrion/Jaime that has Tyrion mention that Shae betrayed him, that he shouldn't have trusted her because she was a whore and that he should have learned that lesson when his "whore wife" lied to him all those years ago and got raped and exiled for it. Cue Jaime confessing that Tysha was no whore and really did love him, as he did in the books. Cue Tyrion losing it completely, ranting at Jaime and going to kill his father. As he did in the books.
4368	WTFSalami	2014-05-01	There's no reason why we need to see Tysha. This show is already the most un-subtle form of story-telling in TV history, we don't need to add Lost-style flashbacks to it. 
He already told the story to us, that's all we need to know.
4369	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-01	They only need to give us a bit reminder. And Bronn knows about it. Bronn can mention Jaime about Tyrion's little wife like he already mentioned the Combat at the Eyrie and Jaime realises how it has affected Tyrion. During the escape, he can mention it

"Tyrion... your wife"
"What about her?"
"She wasn't a whore"
"What?"
"Father told me to lie..." blah blah.

Sorry, but that sounds terrible. Hate the idea of a flashback (to a story we've already been told), the melodramatic fade to Tyrion crying, and Shae's testimony not being a surprise.

Â 
Agreed I think the story comes out as a conversation between Jamie and Tyrion or Bron and Tyrion.
I do think it likely that Shae
	Spoiler Doesn't meet her demise as she does in the books. The show has really showed her and Tyrion to be different more sympathetic characters. I don't think killing her would acheive the same effect as it did in the book...and the show writers seem unwilling to do anything to demonize Tyrion.
4374	Newstar	2014-05-02	The no-flashbacks-except-for-Bran rule seems to rule a flashback out for Tyrion, although the writers have made one exception before with seemingly less reason (Sansa's riot dream).
I do think the writers have to find some way of bringing Tysha back into the narrative before Jaime and Tyrion's confrontation, but it seems like a better way to do that would be through dialogue.
...Unless it's revealed that Shae never loved Tyrion, as in the books, the Tysha revelation will hardly pack the same punch for Tyrion. He's hung up in the books on the knowledge that not only did Shae never love him but Tysha did. Tysha then acquires this special status in Tyrion's mind as the only woman who ever truly loved him. With TV Shae, even if she turns on him and betrays him, it seems pretty clear in the show--absent some revelation that she was Tywin's spy or something--she really did love him, to the point where she begged him to run away with her and (unlike Book Shae) seethed with jealousy over his marriage. So it's less "Tysha's the only one who ever loved me" and more "Tysha's the only one who ever loved me, although I guess there's Shae who refused to leave me, who took a humiliating job as a handmaiden just to be with me, who stayed with me in spite of great danger and wouldn't leave until I drove her off using the most insulting, demeaning language I could think of...hmm..."
Even if the Shae/Tyrion relationship is soured from here on in, it seems pretty clear that TV Shae really did love Tyrion and would have gone on loving him until he rejected her in sufficiently stark and hurtful terms. I guess Tyrion could idealize Tysha as the only one who never BETRAYED him, but that's a whole other kettle of fish.
The thing about the whitewashing is that both Tyrion and Shae have been whitewashed. Not only does TV Tyrion have to do a 180 to murder Shae in cold blood, but TV Shae has to do a 180 to sell him out at the trial. Sibel Kekilli alluded in an interview as to how they're going to do it (seems like it will be straight-up revenge for betraying and rejecting her--hell hath no fury like a woman scorned--rather than mercenary considerations as in the books), but I like the more nuanced, sympathetic TV Shae, and I hate the idea of her character getting trashed, too.

Â 
Alas, I think GRRM might never let us know her fate, because readers imagining it makes it that much worse.
Â 
Â 
However, as it relates to the show, this would be very difficult to pull off: it either is not revealed to its full and people gloss over it, losing some of Tyrion's complexities in the process, or it is revealed to its full extent and likely causes infinite outrage and becomes character poison where (again) the complexities of Tyrion as a character are lost. There is only a razor's edge of subtlety where one can bring in the real tale of Tysha, with all the great-drama-but-disturbing-as-fuck implications. Can it be done? Well, I am reminded of Apollo 13, where they describe the safe re-entry corridor as follows: if the Earth was a basketball, the re-entry corridor would be no thicker than a sheet of paper. (And yet, they managed it.)

Â 
Â 
Yeah, it will be a tough sell if they go through with it for Shae and Tyrion.
If they don't do it (and there's a fair chance they might not), they may have to do some sort of cop-out scenario where she turns but not willingly, and Tyrion (perhaps knowing) does what he does after that to avenge her.Â 
On the other hand, if they do go through with the full "betrayal" scenario I think they can't play it straight-out, like she does it for jealousy alone.
Â 
I think there has to be something more - and Shae finding out the whole Tysha story (under manipulative conditions) might just be the thing to push her over the edge. That last detail about Tysha would mean something very different to Shae, if framed the right way (by being mixed with some outright lies about why it took place).
Â 
... And then, even if show Tyrion does what book Tyrion does, then it will be very hard to contain the controversy after. It will make the Jaime / Cersei thing seem minor by comparison. HBO would be juggling wildfire.

The other thing about Tyrion/Shae is that the whitewashing is a zero/sum thing, assuming Tyrion still murders Shae. You can't make Shae look better or more sympathetic without making Tyrion look worse for murdering her, and vice versa.

And I think this is exactly what they will focus on: Tysha was the only one who never betrayed him. The only one who ever loved him enough not to lie to him, not even once. As for Shae's motivations: I think it might be a bit of both: revenge for being scorned on the one hand and the Lannisters making it clear that she'll be next on the chopping block if she supports Tyrion on the other.
Â

Actually... if you re-watch the scene where Walder greets Robb and co. and presents his daughters, you'll see that there's quite a bit of foreshadowing there (most blatantly: "the wine will flow red and we shall put this mess behind us").

4389	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-28	I am not usually critical of the shows changes from the books but merging Tommens 3 kittens to one is unacceptable! We will miss out on Lady Whiskers ruthless ambitions. Not only that but Ser Pounce was poorly cast that "kitten" is border line a cat! Way to old!
Â 
Â 
Your thoughts?


Â 
Â 
Maybe they just chose not to cast all 3 kittens yet, for budget reasons.
4390	Bannerless Man	2014-04-28	Now everybody just calm down. I'm very sure that David and Dan, stalwart champions of sticking-to-the-source-material that they are, do not intend to rob us of young Tommen's closest advisors. I categorically believe that we will see Lady Whiskers and Boots, we just have to give them time.
Â 
Perhaps the local Cat Actors' Guild was having a sit-in over a lack of tuna plates in the HBO Canteen and thus this, admittedly inferior, was drafted in on short notice to serve as Ser Pounce. No doubt he will be quickly recast and reunited with his feline brethren, once all this mess with C.A.G is sorted out.Â
4391	Queen of Whores	2014-04-28	Maybe Margaery will gift him with the other pussies.

Show!Tommen should be old enough to apreciate what Margaery's offering. There's no excuse for him for refuse now lol.

Â 
Well everyone's all in a tizzy over Ser Pounce's age. Apparently at the cat-actors-guild there was a lot of apprehension over his age. They had to find an older cat actor for the sex scenes.
4393	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	They can merge Boots' story into Lady Whiskers', anyway, since his story is pretty inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
Â 
I just hate how Unsullied are all "Ser Pounce is so badass!". Like, do you even read bro?

Â 
I had heard this also. Apparently there was in-depth discussion of whether the actor needed to be at least 16/18 in human years or cat years. The meeting supposedly ran long into the night before a settlement was reached.Â
4395	Bannerless Man	2014-04-28	They can merge Boots' story into Lady Whiskers', anyway, since his story is pretty inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.


Â 
How dare you sir, Boots' storyline throws open the intrigues of King's Landing! The ripple effect of cutting it would be cat-astrophic.Â
4396	Sharpes	2014-04-28	The other cats were probably scheduled to cast in Braavos.
4397	The Last Reyne	2014-04-28	As this seems to be the nitpicky page I thought Ghost didn't make any noise. He just stared at you like you were his next meal til you ran screaming. What's with all growling?
4398	evita mgfs	2014-04-28	SPOILER ALERT:Â  In Braavos with the fog, all the cats are "grey" ["Mercy"].. This muddles things up.Â  But color probably does not matter to the cats "in general", butÂ  King's Landing cats are rumored to have issues which affects their ability to "play fair",Â especiallyÂ with trifling cats from across the Narrow Sea,
Â 
Anyways, The Ship and The Lantern areÂ currently in discussion to combine troupes andÂ employ Braavosi felinesÂ for a revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats.
4399	evita mgfs	2014-04-28	The Last Reyne:
Â 
Regarding Ghost's growling - it seems to be problematic when working with CGI wolves - they just do not shut UP!Â  Put them in front of a green screen, and they make all kinds of canine sounds.
4400	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-28	No no no. D&D can do nothing wrong and every changes they make are 100% better than their book counterparts.Â
4401	TFP	2014-04-28	In warmer climes such as at KL, shorthair cats tend to be the norm. Though I suppose that winter is coming.
4402	Howdyphillip	2014-04-28	This thread has restored my faith in humanity.... Specifically Show Forum humanity....
4403	DanyTheSaltWife	2014-04-28	Also I do not want to imply the cat is a bad actor. He is doing his best... but the material.

Come come now, we can't keep making this excuse. He performed poorly, however this is his first role in television. If memory serves before this he was strictly musical theatre.Â

Aha, I see what you did there.
4406	The Amethyst Empress	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce is the real star among Tommen's kittens,that's why he's the only one who appears!
The real question is,will we see a duel between Ser Pounce and Balerion?

I agree. The fallout from this enormous plot hole is going to reach far into the future of the series. The books are obviously ruined from here forward. /Unlist
Â 
And besides, when were the writers ever afraid to put in too many pussies in a scene??
4411	regie027	2014-04-28	I heard Boots wanted a hat to go with his footwear...


Can we at least hope that the voice behind Boots and his hat be Antonio Banderas?
4412	JDNight	2014-04-28	Ser Pounce!Â  Look what has been done to Ghost!
Â 
What a whimp he proved to be - allowing mere NW brothers to cage him!Â  And Jon has forgotten that he ever owned a direwolf!Â  In his depressed state over Jon disappearing on him, Ghost allows himself to be imprisoned.Â 


Â 
Yeah, got to admit what happened to Ghost and Jon forgetting him was ridiculous.
4413	Whipsy	2014-04-28	I've heard recent rumors that the original scripts for this season had both Lady Whiskers and Boots written into the story-line, but after double "accidental" deaths of the actors they were sadly written out of the plot and all their lines given to Ser Pounce. The actor who plays Ser Pounce is currently unavailable for comment.Â
4414	Martini Sigil	2014-04-28	Obviously this cat was using the producers leg as a scratching post... the clumsy way it stumbled through its purrs, terrible inflections..... Grey Worm speaks the common tongue better.
Â 
I hope -- for art's sake-- that its meows are kept to a minimin
Â 
This might be a catalyst... it was a catastrophy... Â like it was catatonic.... in its own catagory....Â
4415	DanyTheSaltWife	2014-04-28	Lady Whiskers stealing the toy mouse from Ser pounce is critical to not only his development as a character but the story as a whole.

Herding cats, not possible.But they like treats. Hide tuna in Tommen's bed and watch the magic happen. And kittens are often much easier to handle than cats, because they are much more curious and playful and their attention is very easy to direct.

4440	lyanna_maria	2014-04-28	My flatmate at first thought that Littlefinger was lying about marrying Lysa for who-knows-what obscure Littlefinger-ish reasons.
Â 
She also thought Jaime was sending Brienne after Sansa so that he could give her head to Cersei afterwards  I had to convince her that he's doing it in good faith, and she said that "Jaime is too good a person now, it's like he's not a Lannister anymore". She's suspicious of that change.Â
4441	Gendrys Forge	2014-04-28	Hes sure Jaime sent Pod along on the journey to bring back Sansas head for Tyrion.
He thinks Dany will be killed by somebody in "Egypt".
The "ice demon" turned the baby into an undercover to go back and sent reports to the rest of the ice people.
And in the preview for the next episode he "hopes" that the hound cuts arya in half with one swipe.
He doesn't really pay attention at all.

4447	Baltan	2014-04-28	My brother said that Tyrion is going to the Wall as a resolution for his trial, plus King Tommen sending with him a host to save the brothers of the NW.
4448	lyanna_maria	2014-04-28	So I've talked to a friend of mine tonight, and he had a lot of thoughts (although I have to say that he's in the process of reading the first book now, so maybe he's already a bit biased in some things)
Â 
- Brienne could be a good character but they haven't really given her much purpose in the show and now that's she's going in this adventure away from Jaime she can only get more boring.
- The more he thinks about the sept sex scene, the less he clasifies it as rape: also his best friend doesn't think is rape and she kind of convinced him.
- He thinks Bronn is extremely cool and loves his scenes with Jaime, and how straightforwardly he speaks to him. The moment where he reveals to Jaime that he was Tyrion's first choice for a champion and then they jump to the scene of Jaime in Tyrion's cell was amazing to him.
- Like my flatmate, he admires Littlefinger, creepy as he is, and his remarks have given him a lot to think about.Â 
- He feels that Margaery has been used by her family up to this point and she didn't really know what was going on, but from now on she's gonna be in control, and he likes that.Â 
- He considers Bran's storyline so, so boring and I don't think he pays a lot of attention to it: in fact, he didn't remember why or how he hell he got Nort of the Wall. But he thinks Jon is gonna rescue them and they're gonna meet.Â
4449	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-28	Starting to get bored of Dany and her repetitive story, also thought the scene with her standing beneath the flag had dark undertones to it.


Â 
It's really a matter of time now that the Unsullied will realize Dany's pomposity is getting old and her story isn't going to be half as interesting as the others until she transfers her ass to Westeros. The Unsullied might be biased, cause she started off awesome (I loved her myself at the beginning), but they're not stupid.

Personally, I think this was true in the books as well. Â I didn't think she should be queen after learning she may be infertile, but she was one of my favorites for a long time all the same. Â Her early plotlines are great in either medium then she kind of flounders
4453	north of the wall	2014-04-28	I have spoiled many things for my unsullied hubby unfortunately for him. But there are things I haven't ruined. He knows Tyrion will get out of the cells and that there is a trial by combat (he assumes this means his champion will win) He thought it would be Bronn but I told him no so now he thinks Oberyn will win and assumes the mountin (undefeatable) will finally get his arse kicked by Oberyn. I don't have the heart to ruin it anymore than I already have so will let him think that for now. But he will sad when he is proved wrong. Especially since I've talked up how badass Oberyn is but all he's seen is a sex crazed guy so far.
Â 
He also isn't very impressed with Dany atm as he knows she's still not in Westeros yet in the books (damn me and my spoilers) so he really doesn't care what happens unless the dragons get some badass moments coming up.
Â 
He asked about the WW but I said he knows pretty much the same amount as me since the end to this weeks ep was more than us readers have seen.
Â 
He thinks Stannis is a dick but hates Cercei more so he hopes He will eventually kick some Lannister butt (all but Tyrion and Jaime of course coz they can do no wrong in his eyes), but also loose the evil red witch in the process.
Â 
He also couldn't care less about Sansa and LF but he knows I really like her chapters so is waiting for some action (I don't know why he thinks I'm all about action)
Â 
and finally I've ruined Arya as well for him and knows she ends up training to be some super ninja assassin so hopes that happens soon. Although based upon the promo for next week assumes she hurts the hound and runs away. (hmmmmm....)

Â 
I agree. I loved Dany in book 1 and 2, but the longer she stayed in Essos, the less interesting she became and the more I focused on other characters (incidentally, my interests in Dany and Jon seem to be indirectly proportional - with every book I like Dany a lot less and Jon a lot more). I think for many show watchers the idea that Dany will soon arrive in KL and clean house (read: help the Starks and kill the Lannisters) is what makes the "bright" side of the show (you know, the one that actually feels warm and fuzzy and hopeful). Imagine their surprise when the show gets to ADWD-Dany...

4457	Bungholes First	2014-04-29	Margaery is now known to us as Margey Kay Letourneau.
They asked if that final White Walker was their king, and remarked he looked like a combination of a Buffy monster, Nosferatu, and Pinhead and I agreed.
They believed that Littlefinger (Or Tommy Carcetti as we call him) is lying to Sansa about taking her to the Vale and marrying her aunt, since Lysa knows the Lannisters killed her husband and Littlefinger is their crony. The "On the Next Episode" preview debunked that theory, so now they are not sure what his plan is. They're divided on his motivations. Some think he's trying to honor Cat by looking after her daughter and fulfilling his fantasy of being the father of her child. Others think he's a creep and are afraid he'll rape Sansa and/or sell her into sexual slavery. Unlike everyone else here criticizing Aiden Gillen's accent they all love his voice.
They asked "Is Dany finally invading Westeros now that she's freed every slave?" and "Are the Starks finally reuniting now that Jon and Bran as well as Sansa and Arya are headed for the same place?" But they're too smart and answered their own questions after realizing how the series has dicked the audience with these false hopes in the past and likes to shatter expectations. 
We then had a discussion about how although cruicfying the slavers was badass, it's gonna bite Dany in the ass because they know that both the film industry and G.R.R.M so there's got to negative ramifications to come. They see a super white person invading the lands of brown people in the guise of humanitarianism and that's bad. They also think that some major characrters will die at Craster's Keep. The show has finally broken their spirits. I am proud.

4458	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-04-29	After a discussion about the episode last night regarding the baby and the Others/WW - I realized my poor unsullied husband lost track of all the places in the story and confused Craster's Keep with the brothel in Moll's Town and thought the baby was little Sam (Gilly's).
Â 
I corrected him but we have to re-watch the episode so he can catch up properly.
4459	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-29	Â A friend thinks that Pod and Brienne are going to have lots of sex.
4460	Mel_Rose	2014-04-29	My sis said she thought it was a really good episode and that she's really excited about the whole Craster's keep situation, although she found Bran's story boring before.
4461	CandleWisps	2014-04-29	Though I couldn't resist spoiling most of the series to my Unsullied mother, I haven't really told her much about Bran's plot.
Â 
She was with me and ready to riot when the mutineers were torturing Hodor, and she was really confused when Bran ended up at Crasters (with Jon on the way). She said, "I thought none of the Starks were ever happy again!"
And she was glad that Pod was leaving Kings Landing alive.
Â 
Oh yeah, and she asked Littlefinger to tone his creep game down
4462	teemo	2014-04-29	My friend fell asleep during this episode.
4463	Night'sQueen	2014-04-29	I haven't spoiled much for my husband. His reaction this week was that it seems too convenient that Jon is going to the same place where Bran is a hostage and that "the new guy who wants to kill Bran" is going with him. 
Also he asked why Bran and company were all together like 15 ft away from Craster's. He thought that was really dumb.
He liked the ending with the WW.
4464	Lady Ricarda Manderly	2014-05-01	My unsullied husband and I were talking about Oberyn's knowledge of poisons and my husband pops up with, "He's not the kind of guy to poison your wine. He's the kind of guy who'd dip his sword in poison and stick in the part of your body where it will kill you slow."
Â 
The boy was close!
4465	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-27	This....is pretty huge. Like, we always wondered what happened to Craster's babies. We theorized about it, created a knot of the fandom (Heretics) about it, we mulled it over, and tried to figure out what the hell was going on there.
Â 
Well.Â 
Â 
We just had that answered for us. And the answer is still not a straight one. Theres still enough mystery surrounding the Others/White Walkers that we are left guessing. But still...Craster's babies.
Â 
My dad made a pretty cool observation:
These Other-People are pretty much all brothers. Think about it. Could they even have their own Night's Watch? Are these the lords of the Others? Was that the Heart of Winter we just saw?Â 
Â 
Discuss.
4466	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-27	Yep... Unlist for me.
I always thought others took Craster babies just as a game. Laughing of humans in an evil way, but without any other porpouse.
4467	Northbound2.0	2014-04-27	Snip
Â 
Discuss.I can get behind the "brother" idea. They looked to wearing the exact same armor. Nothing, truly spoiled if we think about it. We have all, long suspected....hell, knew there was crazy shit going down up there. I'm glad it was added to the show at this point. The writing has, long been on the wall; that show is going to pass the books. We just got a big taste of it.

4469	DebL66	2014-04-27	I stated in another thread that I am utterly disappointed by their appearance.  They are supposed to be beautiful in their own way.  Can you imagine the Night's King falling in love with a female version of that?
4470	HouseHarrison	2014-04-27	It's a pretty big spoiler, Others are created by using their magic on living humans whereas they create Wights by using their magic on corpses.
Â 
That was also the Land of Always Winter
Â 
That was also probably the Night's King at the end. He was identified as such in a Rolling Stone article on the article, unless the author of said article did not actually have insider information from D&D and is guessing/full of shit. In any regard he is definitely going to become a big character in the books, probably ADOS. Shame to see it spoiled now.

Gilly was crying. â<U+0080><U+009C>Me and the babe. Please. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be your wife, like I was Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s. Please, ser crow. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a boy, just like Nella said heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d be. If you donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t take him, they will.â<U+0080><U+009D>

â<U+0080><U+009C>The boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brothers,â<U+0080><U+009D> said the old woman on the left. â<U+0080><U+009C>Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sons.

Â 
So pretty much just confirmation of something heavily implied in the books. I'm okay with it. Darth Maul White Walkers appearance i'm meh on....
4472	Justin Danford	2014-04-27	But if it's a spoiler from an unreleased book... That is pretty awful. I've spent years trying to guide non-book reading friends away from spoilers that will cheapen the reveal of the tv show. If the writers cheapen any reveal of the books by putting it in the show ahead of schedule, that is a slap in the face.
4473	andrew_	2014-04-27	I'm blown away, I seriously don't know how to process what I just watched. We just got a huge insight into the Others and what they are all about, yet we still know little to nothing about them. We do know that the white walkers are descendants of the frost giants from Jotunheim (Marvel Universe)  I wonder what GRRM has to say about that scene especially considering we haven't seen anything like that in the books.

That's all well and dandy, but the TV show is an adaptation of theÂ series, not individual books. Â That writer supplying them with such future revelations is GRRM himself.Â
4476	Pib_Juju	2014-04-27	I don't remember many of the specifics from the book on the topic, but... was the number 13 significant in any of the Others stuff? There were 13 "people" in total, counting Darth Other (and not counting the guy who brought the kid).
4477	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-27	We learned that The Others really ARE supernatural otherworldly superhuman beings because they know how to make a baby actually stop crying.
Â 
Godlike Power.Â
4478	Oakenfist	2014-04-27	Apparently the HBO Guide calls the Other with the crown horns the "Nights King."
4479	HouseHarrison	2014-04-27	There are huge implications from this revelation:
Â 
Other (pun intended) things to consider:
Â 
-HBO confirmed the Other at the end was the Night's King
Â 
-The Night's King was in a line of 13 of these "ruling" Others.Â 
Â 
-The Night's King was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
Â 
This raises the question, do past Lord Commanders of the Watch become these ruling class of Others (or at least until the Night's King did)? This episode seems to imply so. This in turn raises the question, is the entire Watch a sham? Is the Watch itself a pawn of the Others? Was the wall really erected to protect Westeros from the Others or is it their own creation? If so, was Bran the Builder an Other, and if so is the entire Stark line descended from the White Walkers? If that's so, then maybe Jon as the Great Other reborn and Dany as Azor Ahai reborn is confirmed from just this one scene. Will Melisandre try to bring back Jon in TWOW, only to have him be reborn a White Walker? There are huge, plot-shattering implications from this simple short show spoiler.
Â 
This was stuff that book readers were not meant to see. It's spoiler territory. But HBO gonna HBO, and the show was bound to pass the books eventually given the speed of GRRM's writing.

4483	D-Shiznit	2014-04-27	This was a huge moment for the series and the books, GoT officaly passed the books for the first time in one aspect of the story, first of many.
4484	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-27	I can't remember this from books but for how long has Craster been sacrificing his sons to the Others?
4485	VeturKemur	2014-04-27	can we get a screen cap of crazy other boss guy?Â

Â 
We saw him in Bran's vision through ice and I initially thought the spikes on head were a crown of some sort. If it's meant to be the Night's King then I guess that would make sense.

					
					
							Edited by Vetur Kemur, 27 April 2014 - 11:04 PM.
4486	knocturne	2014-04-27	Perhaps the reason we have not met Coldhands in the show is because Coldhands is the Night's King in the books? And if the Other we see in the last scene is the Nights King then he must be Coldhands as well?
4487	Winterz	2014-04-27	I wonder. Can they only turn babies?
Â 
Also, the Night's King, eh? Well he did seem considerable more "beautiful" than the standard WW. Perhaps thousands of years residing in those lands causes the skin to become totally white instead of just crystaline. And if the Night's King can create White Walkers, we know that at least others can since the WWs existed before. Damn, we thought this would answer our prayers and instead it only causes more questions 
Â 
Still, I'm very happy they brought it up in the show this early. We, books people, only knew them as very mysterious and rare sights. Although I've defended that they may be just misunderstood, right now I'm not entirely sure about that. I mean the show itself portrayed them as pretty violent and the whole wights thing seems kinda evil whereas the show doesn't portray the Fire Priests that bad.
4488	Corvinus	2014-04-27	Very much inclined to stop watching the show. In fact, I was seriously thinking about it after this season if The Winds of Winter won't be released by season 5. But this was just one scene, so hopefully no more of that this season.
And since I am filling a bit spiteful, I will say That Coldhands is a douche-bag, ain't he?Â
4489	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-27	starks descended from others? oh, my, god. mind absolutely blown. probablly not the case, but what if...

The Last Hero set out on his adventure with a dozen companions before...well we don't know. So that would be 13 as well. 
And the Night's King was the 13th LC.

4493	CarCrashFiance	2014-04-27	&nbsp;
I wonder. Can they only turn babies?
Â 
&nbsp;
We've known that they can turn adults since the prologue. When Ser Waymar is changed into a wight and strangles young Will. Also we see that some of the mutineers are turned. The two who attack Mormont. And even in the Varamyr prologue chapter. 
Turning a child, if it is truly book canon, means that the wights aren't just mindless zombies sometimes. Perhaps they can even age. We know the Others can turn humans and animals. And possibly even control the weather. Some theorize that they built The Wall to keep the men away. So them being able to 'convert' a baby into an adult Other is not out of question (especially after tonight's episode).
4494	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-27	Second time. We already ve been spoiled with Jayne not being pregnant.


Â 
We've been spoiled more times than that. I made a list of sorts in another thread. It's just minor stuff, though
Â 
I need Goku to arrive and kick Ice Piccolo's ass. Seriously, somebody said the whole thing was an "inverse Loki" in the discussion thread. Spot on
Â 
So, thirteen ice rings for the White Walkers under the aurora borealis, huh? Could be the Last Hero's companions, as someone said upthread
Â 
Now, the important part: apparently Ice Darth Maul was the Night's King, so in theory the Great Other (or whatever his show homologue is) is still available, or do you think they're going to merge them?

Â 
You've misunderstood me. I meant if they could turn a grown man into a White Walker. There'd be no point in making the boy go all way up north only to turn him into a Wight. It seems apparent that even the most standard WW can do that.
Â 
Anyway, if he really is the Night's King, then I guess I have the answer but seems strange. Probably takes a lot more to turn a grown man into a WW than a simple baby with a touch.

We've been spoiled more times than that. I made a list of sorts in another thread. It's just minor stuff, though
Â 


Which thread? Â I'm curious to see.
4497	Gustav Greyjoy	2014-04-27	From the wiki
Â 
''While on his way north,Â Bran StarkÂ recalls stories told to theÂ StarkÂ children of the Night's King and the Nightfort byÂ Old Nan, servant inÂ Winterfell. She said some people believe the Night's King was aÂ Bolton, aÂ MagnarÂ out of Skagos, anÂ Umber, aÂ Flint, aÂ Norrey, or aÂ Woodfoot, who ruled Bear Island before theÂ ironmenÂ came. However, she identifies the Night's King as a Stark of Winterfell and brother to the King of the North and hints his name too was Bran.''
Â 
So, 13 Lord Commanders. 13 ''people'' in that scene. Jon is the LC, and also brother to the King in the North.
Â 
my mind is about to colapse. I guess after ''Mercy'' adjustment, and now this, either TWOW is arriving anytime after this season, or GRRM is giving too much away
4498	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-27	Which thread? Â I'm curious to see.

Â 


Bloodraven was the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. I'm not entirely sure it implies that LCs of the Watch become "LC" of the Others, but if there is a connection - and I mean an amicable connection - between the Others and the early Night's Watch, then Bloodraven has to know.
Â 
If we go into crackpot territory, it makes sense that the First Men were unable to build the Wall. Now, if the Wall was built by White Walkers, why can't undead Coldhands get through it? It should have a backdoor of sorts through which the White Walkers can go through. And why does it form a barrier for warging? And if the Wall was built by White Walkers... well, why man it with their enemies? Maybe they've built the Wall to ensure a perpetual winter North of it and the First Men built the castles to man it afterwards?
Â

They can turn dead adults into wights. Now it seems they can turn live babies into White Walkers - probably baby White Walkers? But according to the Night's King legend, they should be able to reproduce... maybe that part of the legend is wrong and they can't? And that's why they weren't a threat for thousands of years until they were able to very slowly increase their numbers and strike a deal with Craster?

If that's so, then maybe Jon as the Great Other reborn and Dany as Azor Ahai reborn is confirmed from just this one scene. Will Melisandre try to bring back Jon in TWOW, only to have him be reborn a White Walker? There are huge, plot-shattering implications from this simple short show spoiler.
Â 
This was stuff that book readers were not meant to see. It's spoiler territory. But HBO gonna HBO, and the show was bound to pass the books eventually given the speed of GRRM's writing.

4511	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-28	Is it just me or did the Other who changed the baby look to be half human-half Other? Â Night's King's offspring?


His hands didn't look othery to me.
4512	ColdDrake	2014-04-28	The Stonehenge like arrangement of the ice reminded me of the stones at theÂ execution site in the first episode where Ned decapitates the deserter.
The Night's King was most likely a Stark too...very interesting.
Â 
Looked like the Land of Always Winter, and there seemed to be some sort of castles or towers in the background on that big mountain.
Â 
As a book reader who read first read the series in 2005, I don't mind these reveals. It's about damn time for the story to move forward.
4513	Jon Dovahkiin Snow	2014-04-28	The Others already existed when the Night's King first came around. My thought is that the NK is merely the bridge between the two species, humans and The Others., The "Great Other" is either a god or someone else. I guess we'll have to wait and see (possibly before we even read!)
I don't think the Nights King and Coldhands are related in any way  (In the show at least). We may never even read about an Other with a spiky head in the books. In fact, I'd be surprised if we did.

Â 
So, thirteen ice rings for the White Walkers under the aurora borealis, huh? Could be the Last Hero's companions, as someone said upthread
Â 
Now, the important part: apparently Ice Darth Maul was the Night's King, so in theory the Great Other (or whatever his show homologue is) is still available, or do you think they're going to merge them?

4518	doghouse	2014-04-28	Do you think it is possible that Craster's sacrifices are the reason that the Others are returning after 1000 years or whatever time frame the Others have been gone?

Here. Also love that Avatar.
Â 
I dont think Coldhands is involved, you guys. I do think however, that we are dealing with some mega shit here. Can we get a screencap of the supposed 13 dudes in the scene?
4528	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	You know what would be insanely awesome? If one those WW arrives at Craster's and kills Burn Gorman and the rest, and then identifies himself as Coldhands

I do think the WW are going to kill and eat some of those assholes. After all, cannibalism as a punishment of breaking the guest right is kind of a theme in the books
4529	Kyrion	2014-04-28	Could it be possible that this isnt THE Nights King from the story who was a Stark, but rather whoever is the leader of the White Walkers/Others is called the Nights King? Or hes a reincarnation of the Nights King, kind of like the modern Azor Ahai is the reincarnation of Azor Ahai/Last Hero.

4531	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-28	Yeah, I dunno why people assume that dude was Coldhands either. I guess anything's possible at this point, but I really hope it's not. The Elk made him stand out - that was something unique. A dead horse? Lame. Plus, he wasn't covered at all. What's the point of Coldhands hiding his appearance if he's just another Other. Seems rather pointless to me. Bran's seen enough crazy shit... I highly doubt meeting a good/neutral Other would throw him off.
4532	clawson24	2014-04-28	&nbsp; &nbsp;
We've known that they can turn adults since the prologue. When Ser Waymar is changed into a wight and strangles young Will. Also we see that some of the mutineers are turned. The two who attack Mormont. And even in the Varamyr prologue chapter.
Turning a child, if it is truly book canon, means that the wights aren't just mindless zombies sometimes. Perhaps they can even age. We know the Others can turn humans and animals. And possibly even control the weather. Some theorize that they built The Wall to keep the men away. So them being able to 'convert' a baby into an adult Other is not out of question (especially after tonight's episode).


The distinction is whether or not the child was being turned into a Wight or an Other. I think most are assuming he was turned into an Other, which we have NOT seen to this point. Waymar was killed and then brought back as a Wight, not changed into an Other (considering the Others are presumably an entirely different race/group of beings entirely).
4533	I'm_Tim	2014-04-28	Someone from an Unsullied board just asked if the spikes in Ice Darth Maul's head are meant to be a crownÂ

+1. At first I was sort of taken aback by what I was seeing but now I'm just excited at all the possibilities and connections that this offers for everyone to discuss now. Righteous.
4535	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-28	I don't remember many of the specifics from the book on the topic, but... was the number 13 significant in any of the Others stuff? There were 13 "people" in total, counting Darth Other (and not counting the guy who brought the kid).


Â 
The night's king was the 13th lord commander of the night watch, the last hero had 12 companions, maybe he's frozen Jesus Â 
Â 


Perhaps the reason we have not met Coldhands in the show is because Coldhands is the Night's King in the books? And if the Other we see in the last scene is the Nights King then he must be Coldhands as well?


Â 
I see coldhands as an oathbreaker of the frozen brotherhood, no way he'd appear in an episode titled oathkeeper.
4536	the stranger in the dark	2014-04-28	A few things, it is ok to say that this is an adaptation of a series not a book but if the Other Revelation was in fact taken from unreleased material then shame on HBO and D & D. I also think for tv fans this has cheapened any reveal. There hasn't been much talk about crasters babies or giving to the others since season 2 so why do this now. In the books there are a lot of clues given that have then been debated on the forums like the debates happening over who the hell this guy is, the night king, the great other.Â 
Â 
I did just watch Inside episode 4 on youtubeÂ http://youtu.be/Zz5K_j4TRMs?t=4m56sÂ and D&D admit that they sourced this scene not from the books but a suggestion by the books.
Â 
I think debate who these others are is now pointless because when a reveal is made by George in the future the show may need to somehow adapt again because of its error.
4537	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	I thought the idea that it was a crown was obvious.

Night's King Other takes the baby and Other-fies him.Â

I've never even mentioned Coldhands before in a show thread ever? I was just pointing out the guy on the horse seemed to be wearing what looked like the same armor the Nights Watch wear and since he's also riding around on a mount and was just near Bran and Crasters I don't think it was out of place at all to mention that this could potentially be Coldhands. 
But thank you for the rude response with no sort of point or evidence to back up what you said.

4541	Jabronius Maximus	2014-04-28	One thing I don't get, wasn't the NK eventually killed by his brother and Joramun? It's kind of weird to see him sticking around.
4542	clawson24	2014-04-28	Can't possibly see why people would think the Other at the end that HBO has described as the Night's King would also be Coldhands. By all accounts Coldhands looked like a dead human, not some otherworldly being. His skin was black with congealed/frozen blood but he was distinctly human. The only thing initially suspicious about his appearance was his cold, corpse-like hands when he reached out to put Sam and Gilly on the elk, hence the name. By that point Sam had already seen and killed an Other. Don't you think he would've recongized another one if he saw it?

Â 
I think lots of people get the wights and Others confused so it's good to debate this distinction. Wights are just reanimated corpses - they are not living in any way and like zombies, seem to be fairly mindless minions who retain only enough of their living memories to know where to go to kill living people (this was mentioned in the books if I recall).
Â 
Whatever this was we just saw... that was no ordinary 'wight' reanimation - which seems to happen automatically after WW/Others kill living humans... There was also the ceremonial theme to it ...altar, special location, others lined up (13) - all very symbolic. There's no way that was just a baby being turned into a Wight... that was a baby being turned into an Other - which apparently can only be done to certain living humans under special circumstances...otherwise they'd have long ago just converted all the wildlings into Others. There's some forbidden magic involved here that we're being revealed for the first time.
Â 
Epic.
4544	Ser Sabotage	2014-04-28	I can get behind the "brother" idea. They looked to wearing the exact same armor. Nothing, truly spoiled if we think about it. We have all, long suspected....hell, knew there was crazy shit going down up there. I'm glad it was added to the show at this point. The writing has, long been on the wall; that show is going to pass the books. We just got a big taste of it.


Â 
I like the idea but that would imply more and more ice-folks up there north and I don't find it likely to happen.
Â 
ASOIAF is based on symmetrical opposition, the Others being in opposition with the dragons. I can't see them protecting a land and its people.
Â 
Unless the Others were the "watchers on the Wall" watching the CoF's land.

"Fell"
Â 
Beaten, not necessarily killed (and in this world death isn't as absolute as one would think, particularly when The Others are involved)
Â 
Oh Old Nan you scamp, such clever word choice in your storytelling 
Â 
Â 
Also I think just like with the Long Night/Prince That Was Promised/Azor Ahai story, the details have gotten a little warped (to fit an agenda, and due to forgetfulness and getting farther removed from the actual event) over the centuries.Â  If The Night's King is The Ultimate Traitor so horrible his real name is stricken from official records, then obviously that side would have to tell the story ending with his destruction (so don't try following his footsteps!) whether he actually was killed or merely deposed.

The NK was originally a human, possibly a Stark (brother of the KitN at the time). Still could be Coldhands, but the NK looks very much like an Other, not a wight.

Â 
Â 
Â 
The NK was originally a human, possibly a Stark (brother of the KitN at the time).
Â 
Where is this sinopsis?
4562	The Old Tongue	2014-04-28	Perhaps those Others were performing a test on the child. Maybe there's a particular child from Craster's line who is of interest to them. Maybe it's that little Craster baby at the wall?
4563	Jabronius Maximus	2014-04-28	It was posted earlier in this thread, but it's here (scroll down a bit)
4564	Gneisenau	2014-04-28	To get some consensus, can we start referring to horse guy with Benjen hairstyle as Babyhands?


Â 
Oh so Benjen had a ponytail ? Is that White Walker Benjen then ?
4565	Envie	2014-04-28	The whole Craster's sons thing has me really wondering .... what happens to them once they are Others? Obviously they aren't a 'baby' anymore - so do they 'grow up' somehow instantly? All of those figures behind the head honcho were full grown man sized beings. Craster's sons would be of all different ages over the years from babies to young adults. Not that it really matters, but the magic of the Great Other must age them up somehow too.
Â 
I really appreciated someone from Reddit quoted the book. It's not really that much of a spoiler now - because we're reminded that the women in Craster's keep KNEW about the sons and the brothers coming for the babies and they knew they were the Others too. The only spoiler is WHO is the horned Other "Night's King" and what is his significance? It really actually only creates more questions then it does spoilery answers!
4566	Kyrion	2014-04-28	The Great Other exists just as much as Rhillor exists, meaning we have no clue.
Â 
I think George is too much of an agnostic to include gods in the story, especially considering it seems to be like our world where cultures just breed and create gods to explain situations in the world that they cant know(like magic).
Â 
Usually in stories with gods, there is one god tale that is true, theres no dispute, everyone seems to know about creation myths and all that. This story theres way too many gods for anyone to definitely be true. Kind of like our world heheh.
4567	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-28	Â 
Talk in the street says it's the Night's King, apparently (the horns being the crown).
Â 
I wonder if the show will have both the NK and the Great Other, or if they're going to make them into one character


Melisandre mentions the Great Other to Shireen last episode i believe. But she doesnt call him the Great Other. She calls him a god of darkness. So i dunno. I think NK is supposed to be a form of the Great Other. At least metaphorically.

Nah, i think its just Craster's kids they want cuz Craster cut a deal with them somehow. Gilly's baby escaped being a 'gift for the gods' and poor Shards was the casualty. Sam shanked his ass. (rip in peace, Shards) Â 


Â 
Oh so Benjen had a ponytail ? Is that White Walker Benjen then ?


Oh please, gods no.Â
4568	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-04-28	This was a very strange scene, not the kind of scene I ever expected to see at this stage.
So these frost giants, who reside at minas morgul, have a Stonehenge-like structure where they carry out their conversions. Hmmm interesting...but I'm not sure where this is going.

Â 
I think when people say they are agnostic/atheist they tend to deny to idea of the omnipotent being or the first cause of everything. The typical fantasy god is more like a creature that are more advanced than humans.
4570	Ser Sabotage	2014-04-28	Â 
Oh so Benjen had a ponytail ? Is that White Walker Benjen then ?


Â 
Benjen being CH was ruled out earlier for inconsistency with CH's lines in ADWD but that doesn't mean Benjen isn't Coldhands. The plot cruelly lacks satisfying explanations as to Benjen's whereabouts and references to CH's age could just be deliberate misleading so Bran wouldn't recognise him.
Â 
The ponytail is kind of puzzling. This must be deliberate.
4571	HouseHarrison	2014-04-28	Bran on the Night's King:
Â 
Some say he was a Bolton," Old Nan would always end. "Some say a Magnar out of Skagos, some say Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot, from them who ruled Bear island before the ironmen came. He never was. He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down." She always pinched Bran on the nose then, he would never forget it. "He was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can say? Mayhaps his name was Brandon. Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room."
Â 
A Storm of Swords, Chapter 52
Â 
Starks = descendants of WW's seems pretty strong now. Maybe "Winter is Coming" in fact refers to their rebirth as Others? Or the return of their lineage over all of Westeros?

Â 
You do realize agnostic and atheist are two different things right? Agnostic means you do not acknowledge any one single God and instead are open to the idea there could possibly be other explanations or existence. One who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God.
Â 
I think it is the open minded agnostic who can imagine the most amazing fantasy of all.Â
4573	intheswamp	2014-04-28	In one of Jon's chapters, Craster's father's name was said to sound similar to Stark.Â  I wonder if Craster's father may have come from a Stark-branch family.Â  Perhaps, the Others specifically want Craster's sons because they have Stark blood?
4574	Maester Totoro	2014-04-28	Wasn't this WW the same on Season 2's finale? The one that looks at Sam?

He is the GOÂ´s instrument... just like Stannis is RhllorÂ´s (according to Melisandre)
4576	Lady Olenna	2014-04-28	We learned that The Others really ARE supernatural otherworldly superhuman beings because they know how to make a baby actually stop crying.
Â 
Godlike Power.Â  

I wonder what their hourly rate is?
Coulda really used one about 3 years ago.

When the WW rode to the alter it was all dark. And then we go a shot of the alter where it is alot brighter with the 14 WW. It that alter like some portal or something ?
4579	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-28	Anybody consider that the show was just making stuff up and is dead wrong? It wouldn't be the first time. We don't know how detailed the stuff D&D have, but like -- it strikes me as exceedingly improbable that the Others are created from humans. They always struck me as their own thing, and the stories about Craster just seemed to be stories.
Â 
It doesn't make much sense for the Others to invade if their source is living, breathing humans. Why would they invade themselves into extinction?
4580	Jabronius Maximus	2014-04-28	Kind of on-topic, but did anyone find that whole LoAW area very familiar, I don't know...like Minas Morgul from LotR? And that dude riding on the dead horse...the mouth of Sauron some random Other?
Â 
Also I find it interesting how GRRM has avoided having any Stark interact with the Others. Jon and Bran are just oh so close but never face one. And the one Stark who may have faced them...is never heard from again. God dammit GRRM, come on I want to see this!

I don't think it was a portal. They lit up the final scene so you could get a good clear look at the Night's King and the baby being turned. Who knows where they are but everyone seems to think it's the legendary land that is always winter. I think whatever it was and wherever they were, it was an epic reveal about the future of the story!

Well. We have yet to see any "White walker" or "Other" on screen, if we assume everything we saw until now was just wights. There's that long-haired dude who doesn't look like a wight, but maybe the zombish ones who attack Castle Black were just "fresh" wights.
Â 
So the Others would be the 14 dudes we saw tonight and everything else being human-based wights, that would still qualify as making sense.

Both had a ponytail but their horses and hair are of different colours, and Babyhands' face is a little to frozen to pass for a Stark's
Â 
Benjen also has a scar by his left eye.

Â 
True, and it just occured to me that Benjen's horse has returned to Castle Black alive so this whole undead-and-his-undead-mount-thing just makes no sense.
Â 
But I feel something would be wrong if the show sidetracks around CH. I had the feeling he was an important character.
4588	Westacular	2014-04-28	There are no new pov's in the new books, pov list will actually be cut down.


Â 
Prologues and Epilogues are probably still an exception. But I think Bran's pov will be used to explore who the Others are and what secrets lie in their history.
Â 
Â 


Can't possibly see why people would think the Other at the end that HBO has described as the Night's King would also be Coldhands. By all accounts Coldhands looked like a dead human, not some otherworldly being. His skin was black with congealed/frozen blood but he was distinctly human. The only thing initially suspicious about his appearance was his cold, corpse-like hands when he reached out to put Sam and Gilly on the elk, hence the name. By that point Sam had already seen and killed an Other. Don't you think he would've recongized another one if he saw it?


Â 
Agreed. And on the topic of Coldhands working for the Others: you'd have to disregard basically everything the character has ever done, since it's all been in the service of the greenseers / Bloodraven, who happen to be probably the only people in the world who truly know what the Others are and how to stop them. The greenseers can't possibly be in league with the Others; look at the lengths they went to to ward their caverns from wights and Others, and the efforts the wights (presumably at the bidding of Others) made to prevent Bran from reaching them.
4589	Jabronius Maximus	2014-04-28	Like the show does often, I think they'll blend CH with someone else. Maybe BR will just be controlling some random NW member*, and speak to Bran as Bloodraven. Or it'll just be a big crow (an actual bird) guiding Bran to BR.
Â 
*He could very well be doing that in the books already, but Coldhands is presented as a separate character. Maybe in the show they'll get rid of the middleman and the wight talking to Bran will call himself Bloodraven.

I think way back, there was a connection. Old Nan did say the Night's King was a Stark. And I mentioned in a post above how it's interesting that GRRM hasn't had a Stark interact with an Other yet. Well the one who may have (Benjen) has gone missing...
Â 
There's definitely some link between the Starks and WWs. I'll proudly wear my tinfoil hat.

Well, I was thinking about this as well.Â  Can't say we've seen anyone that looks like this Nights King (Other), but in the books, I am fairly certain Sam slays an Other, not a wight.Â  So was the one he slayed in the show an Other?Â  Also, I think in GoT prologue, it was the Others.Â  Even the show called them White Walkers.Â  Wonder if originally they were one in the same, but GRRM started creating a distinction between the two through his writings.

That is until the NK, who had to be deposed because of what he was doing. That whole business might have sent an off shoot branch of weird Stark/Other relationships, but at the core I believe the connection between Stark and Winterfell and Others and Winter coming is that Starks remember the true enemy, thus there must always be a Stark in the Kingdom of the North to contend with that enemy, for whatever reason . . .

Yes, it's the more sensible explanation. NK could have started an antitribe-Stark branch. It's foggy but all we really have to go on with this is from tales and misty lore in the books. The POV narration is unreliable as the tales could very well be off-track.

He appears before his "bosses", so he couldn't be just some WW rabble. Just like common sellswords usually don't show up in front of the highborns; they've got squires and other dudes to do that kind of chores. The WW is probably an elite one.

If you can watch a TV show about a book you've read, I don't see how you can't read a book about a TV show you saw. I'm a reader, I prefer the books, but I don't consider seeing new stuff as "being spoiled".Â 
Â 
Yeah, if they skip the whole two-and-half books they have to show on screen to spoil half the book it'll be lame but I don't think it'll come to that. WW are rarely shown on screen and with such a heavy dose now I think we'll be starved for a few weeks now. Maybe for the whole season.

I like that they're confident enough to move onto bits of new material. They know the end-game, so I don't mind them dropping things in. It was going to happen sooner or later; they're not going to slow down and wait for George when they have such a large audience to tell a story to (and I always hated that the Others were just a background menace in the books; even after 5 books we still know nothing). If it bothers you, then by all means don't watch the show - just be prepared to be spoiled on the internet, either way.
Â 
Anyway, totally wasn't expecting the scene. Mind = blown.

I don't get the talk about CH, but I understand that some are still hoping he's in the show. Unfortunately it's really unlikely; considering John Bradley pretty much confirmed CH was cut.

Â 


Â 
Once again, Catelyn was wrong 
Â 
She said it was unlike the boastful chest-thumping of the other great houses, that it was a stark (hee hee) sober warning to prepare for the future.Â  But, like "there must always be a Stark in Winterfell" the original, mystical meaning has been lost to time and replaced with a more mundane bit of feudal wisdom.
Â 
"Winter Is Coming" IS a boast of insurmountable power.Â  "we're the kings of winter.Â  If you are contemplating fucking with us, you should consider that WE HAVE FUCKING ICE ZOMBIES ON OUR SIDE if you piss us off enough."
4616	Rhaegar's Second Son	2014-04-28	I bet the children of the forest gave Bran the builder the power to build the wall.Â  now they will give present bran the power to fight the white walkers.

Yes, it's the more sensible explanation. NK could have started an antitribe-Stark branch. It's foggy but all we really have to go on with this is from tales and misty lore in the books. The POV narration is unreliable as the tales could very well be off-track.
Oh I didn't mean that the Starks and Others are in cahoots. I just think that the Others' motives are cloudy and may involve some kind of pact or past event with the Starks. 
I'm more interested with what will happen if we see a Stark face an Other. Jon and Bran have been perilously close, and Benjen has gone missing. It's interesting how GRRM has 'avoided' this meeting (although admittedly, many characters haven't seen an Other). Makes me think that there's something special planned for when the 'meeting' does occur - which may have something to do with the past of the Starks.

Misleading camera shots on the WW hands. Those new episodes are full of weird angles and pans. At some other point in the episode you could swear the camera was trying to show you a monster under Tommen's bed.
Â 
In another thread (or earlier in this thread? I don't remember) someone was asking if there's a new camera crew working on the show. I think that's what led us to look for CH where he wasn't. Some photo director is playing us for fools.

About Benjen, whos to say he isnt being a mole to the Others? If hes still alive, he could be spying on them but cant quite get away. Who knows. Hes out there somewhere.Â

Yeah, Sam, aside from being a pretty cool character, is made to be the POV on the WW. Jon Snow should have been the natural choice of POV so your point may very well be valid.
Â 
I wonder if this pact couldn't be some kind of truce between First Men (Starks, but could also include Thenns) and the Others, preventing one to take direct action against another. It would explain the "Stark in Winterfell" tradition and why so many Starks are sent to the Wall.
Â 
Benjen's disappearance could be explained by the WW inability to take action against him (no body, ni Benjen-wight), they had to find a way to have him lost and gone. Maybe the CotF fits somewhere in this picture. What do you think?

4623	LordToo-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse	2014-04-28	And he looked past the Wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.
Â

we just saw the heart of winter..
4624	HouseHarrison	2014-04-28	Others having their own cities makes sense. They gotta live somewhere. They just can't run around naked in the woods forever. I've long imagined someone stumbling across an Others city far far north at one point.

4626	Alysanne Snow	2014-04-28	Interestingly, this could all make Craster one of the most important characters in the entire series, if the WW are able to increase their power thanks to all the fresh meat/new recruits. Â A bit of a reach on the information we've been given, but GRRM likes to use the butterfly effect, so to speak and I wouldn't put it beyond him to make Craster almost single handedly responsible for the return of the Others. Â Personally, I loved the scene and am just fine with being spoiled. Â It made sense to give this information in this episode and this season is kind of a hodgepodge anyways. Plus, it certainly got everybody talking.

Well remember the dragonglass weapons cache that Ghost found? It was wrapped in a NW cloak, which makes me think Benjen left it there (it's a stretch, but it's the closest thing I can think of). Where did he get those weapons and that knowledge? I think he's working with the CotF - sneaking around and avoiding the Others, possibly even killing a few. That or he's some kind of hybrid Other, who is a bridge between them and the Starks.  
I'm just throwing around a bunch of stuff, hoping something sticks. I'm still kind of bewildered after that big reveal in the show lol.

This. Tis a glorious revelations
4630	HouseHarrison	2014-04-28	HBO has since changed their episode synopsis, removing the reference to the Night's King. To me that indicates they accidentally spoiled it too early, because it makes no sense they'd just randomly and incorrectly throw a reference to the Night's King in there.
4631	averde	2014-04-28	Can't possibly see why people would think the Other at the end that HBO has described as the Night's King would also be Coldhands. By all accounts Coldhands looked like a dead human, not some otherworldly being. His skin was black with congealed/frozen blood but he was distinctly human. The only thing initially suspicious about his appearance was his cold, corpse-like hands when he reached out to put Sam and Gilly on the elk, hence the name. By that point Sam had already seen and killed an Other. Don't you think he would've recongized another one if he saw it?

People are saying the rider carrying the baby could be coldhands, not the leader creature at the end.
4632	Clariana	2014-04-28	Â

Really don't see why... If the Starks can become Others why not the Baratheons? After all the Red Woman does harp on and on about power in a king's blood and the Starks and Baratheons could be related.

Â 
My point still largely applies though. Of what Sam/Bran and Co. could tell (I know they never get a good look at CH as he refuses to remove his cloak), CH looks like a dead human. They never mention anything about him which would suggest he looks like a different species entirely. CH himself specifically mentions how after his heart stopped beating, all his blood congealed/froze in his extremities, giving him the appearance he has. Nothing would seem to suggest that he would look like an Other.

4636	ColdDrake	2014-04-28	It was absolutelyÂ NOT Coldhands.
Â 
The fact that HBO took down the Night's King detailÂ from their site tells me that it most likely wasn't meant to be up there in the first place and it wasn't just some small mistake. More like a massive mistake. Someone at HBO could get in a lot of trouble for this.
Â 
The horns on his head are meant to be a crown of sorts. I liked that he looked more elegant than the ragtag White walkers we've seen so far. Next I hope for a look at the icey armor Martin described in the book, and eventually Ice Spiders and other things. I love the whole northern magical aspect of the series so this reveal was a particularly delightful surprise for me.

Â 
Same. Most of my friends (primarily TV show fans and not book fans) are far more into the political backstabbing and intrigue than the mysticism and magic. I keep telling them the Bran storyline is amongst my favorites in the books (can't wait for him to reach the Cave and BR), and they keep telling me they find his story incredibly boring. This episode was a kick in the 'nads as far as delving into the magical side of things goes.

OMG my reaction completely.
Â 
I figured they'd be revealing this as gospel as soon as I saw the WW riding along with the baby. Very heavily implied in the books that Craster supplied most of the recruits for the WW and I always believed Craster's wives knew the truth of it. A mother always knows her son, or at least that's what fantasy fiction will have you believe.

4652	clawson24	2014-04-28	Just because it's very possible that the original Night's King still exists, does that rule out all possibility of Stannis following a similar path?

What kind of leap in logic is that? Are you implying the current generation of White Walkers was spawned from the breeches of Craster?
Â 
The scene demonstrates that the Others have the ability to turn human babies into Others, that some of the Others were once human, but it doesn't imply that they were ALL once human.
4666	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-28	If all Others were once human, How would the first Other have been transformed?

4668	Dany's Golden Fleece	2014-04-28	I'm starting to get the feeling that the White Walkers ARE the old gods, supernatural beings that primitive people believed were gods.Â  Didn't the Northmen practice human sacrifice for a while in the North? Maybe this is the type of sacrifice they did? Give a son to the old gods.
Â 
Then after the Night King, everything changed.Â  Cut off from the white walkers, the religion changed (as all religions do) with timeÂ and morphed into a form of tree worship.Â  If those 13 white walkers were the first 13 Lord Commanders of the Night's Watch.... ah so many possibilities!

Assuming this was the NK, it still doesn't mean much yet. He MAY have been a Stark. This is only speculation. This doesn't mean the Starks have "Other Blood" or that they have some kind of understanding with the Others.
This doesn't prove that The Others are human, or were once human. It only shows that they (at least one of them, anyway) know a way to transform infant human boys into White Walkers. (Old Nan also told stories of children disappearing in the night, IIRC.)
GRRM has stated that they aren't human. They're a beautiful entity beyond our understanding. They know magic and can use it to do things with ice humans couldn't even fathom. These weren't his exact words, but basically what he said. 
Let's wait and see if GRRM says anything about this. If i had to guess, I'd say it was the Night's King, NOT the Great Other, and he is unique in that he, and only he, can transform infant boys into Others. 
With all this jumping ahead, I also like to think TWoW will be released sooner than i thought. I can hope, at least.
4672	Sun	2014-04-28	So, that was one hell of a spoiler. The heretics must be going nuts.Â
4673	House Targlannistark	2014-04-28	It's a pretty big spoiler, Others are created by using their magic on living humans whereas they create Wights by using their magic on corpses.
Â 
That was also the Land of Always Winter
Â 
That was also probably the Night's King at the end. He was identified as such in a Rolling Stone article on the article, unless the author of said article did not actually have insider information from D&D and is guessing/full of shit. In any regard he is definitely going to become a big character in the books, probably ADOS. Shame to see it spoiled now.


Yeah, huge spoiler for us who are waiting for the books. I LOVED this episode, because in a show-perspective it's good for bringing the plot forward. Even though, Â from the "book-reader-perspective" I would love to read about it first.
So in one way this episode was awesome, but in another way it made me want to wait watching the series until I have read all the books (TWOW & ADOS)...
I counted 13 black shadows. including the one you believes to be the Nights King. Perhaps the number means something (often do in Martins books). But I have absolutley NO idea of whom they are supposed to be, or what their intentions are. We won't know, till we know for shure. All I am shure of, is that it has something to do with the title of the book series.

I don't know...I kind of assumed they were doing this with the babies. I don't think this is to say that they're not a different species; I think it just means they have the ability to turn baby boys into one of them if they so choose. You're also jumping to a lot of conclusions about their "purpose," and I'm not sure why they wouldn't have their own culture, cities, and problems. They ones we saw at the end of the episode were wearing robes (indicating some sort of cultural norm), and were coming out of Elsa's Ice Palace (so they probably have the ability to build cities).
Â 
I think we'll have to wait and see before throwing out judgement on this yet. We know a very, very small bit of information here.
4677	Hippocras	2014-04-28	If all Others were once human, How would the first Other have been transformed?
Â 
I Think it's more like they are another sort of species,but fill out their ranks by snatching boys and maybe also girls.

I doubt it.
I think they were once human. The first one was created by blood magic. The blood magic was related to preservation and longevity and may even be the same magic that is behind the Wall. "Fire consumes, ice preserves".
4678	Mark Antony	2014-04-28	Still holding out hope that wasn't the Nights King. He was kinda ridiculous looking . The white walkers are sposed to be beautiful man
4679	Lord Varys	2014-04-28	Well, do we know that GRRM does actually imagine things like that? It has been implied that (some of) the Others were once human babies, but in the books it has not been revealed to be true. It's easily possible that the showrunners are doing what they want now with the 'source material'.
Â 
And even if we assume that this is the way things are in GRRM's mind, I'm pretty sure he envisions it not in some sort of World of Warcraft setting. This Other thing was not the Night's King, it was the Lich King for all I know.
Â 
As to the overall implications of the meaning of this:
Â 
My guess is that the original Others found a way to turn humans into their own kind to perpetrate their race/add soldiers into their ranks. It's more or less their operate with the wight thing, too. But I really hope that the original Others were not some group of evil men digging to deep into evil ice magic, nor do I hope that all the Others are actually just humans transformed into Others.Â 
Â 
The Night's King doesn't have to mean all that much, since that term might have been a title of sorts, and does not have to refer to the historical Night's King of the tales... But the historical Night's King may indeed still be alive. No one ever said he was killed back then.

My problem with this is why assume they were NOT human, like ever? These books are underpinned by some serious magic, including resurrection by fire. Why not just transformation by ice without the necessity of inventing another species?

They are beautiful according to grrm in some email I think. Show!Others(King Other included) definitely do not resemble their book counterparts. They're also missing that badass translucent armor from the books.

I think that's also because the Night's King falls in love with one. Though granted, we haven't seen what the female Others look like yet.

Â 
That's fair too. I just hope we do get to see more varied appearances. I was watching with another book reader, and she thought the White Walker carrying the baby on the horse was the same one Sam stabbed (even though we see him exploding), just because they look so similar.
4687	C0bR	2014-04-28	I hope we get a sneakpeek into the Others kindergarten. Those guys looked like pretty decent folk, so it could be lovely.

Why would Stannis even want to fight such good guys?

Â 
How can you write 5 books and still have 2 more to go...to give the consent to HBO to show something so at the core.....you just shouldnt...their origin shouldve been shown after so many other seasons...They treat some chapters so lightly where they can still find interesting information in ASOS yet they do this...It was cheap in my opinion..and for the book readers i think it was frustrating.Of course i was expecting the babies to be somehow turned into an other but to have it shown this way...and sooo early..and to give us even a glipse of The Heart of Winter...
Â 
Martin should really think about it.Because i find it nonprofessional to reveal small details in the damn show where we the readers spend so much time to discuss theories.
Â 
And to be more on the point the whole Jon+HOAT???? and then JON+Hoat+CHETT+BRAN/??That is loool..
I must admit i wanted to know what happened to the rest of the brothers that remained at Â Craster..but i assumed they were most likely killed either by the Others either by Mance..coz at this point Mance is near the walls.
4689	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	So...what facts do we know now? I'd like someone to compile them
Â 
-The Others can turn human into Others
-The NK is alive
-There are thirteen Others in that shot...Last Hero anyone?

4690	Mark Antony	2014-04-28	In the novels they're killed by Coldhands but he has been dropped from the show I believe
4691	SeventySeven	2014-04-28	I haven't read the whole thread, but has it been confirmed if this was a spoiler or a deviation? It would be interesting to know.
4692	Hippocras	2014-04-28	In the novels they're killed by Coldhands but he has been dropped from the show I believe

Â 
It's for sure a spoiler. Martin told D&D everything, so, now, 90% sure the NK is alive.
4694	kill alot26	2014-04-28	Anyone blaming the Tv shows should be venting that frustration at George he gave them permission to make the show he knew the show would catch the books the blame all fallsÂ on him.
But in saying that wow that was awesome to watch when we saw the white walker heading towards what we can assume is that land of always winter I thought it would cut away but nope... freaking sweet! I agree about the disappointment of how they are pretty hideous looking but I guess its just an easier way of showing ahh they are the bad dudes, kinda like how the Thenns look odd. I wish they looked more beautiful though but in saying that we don't even know what they look like until the next book.
Â 
Its going to be very interesting to see how much more we are shown of them in the series.
4695	SeventySeven	2014-04-28	Â 
It's for sure a spoiler. Martin told D&D everything, so, now, 90% sure the NK is alive.


Â 
I guess we'll get tons more spoilers from now on. I knew it would happen, but I didn't think this early.
4696	Hippocras	2014-04-28	Given how often the show varies from the book, I really don't care about spoilers. I will still very much enjoy the books. Nothing is ruined at all IMO.
4697	armatil	2014-04-28	as someone mentioned earlier on, this alleged night's king looks like a sort of half-white walker, and not quite as otherworldly as the ones we've seen before. that makes sense, since the night's king was brother to the king in the north, and therefore a fairly regular human (one of the first men, to be exact). it isn't unthinkable that his "unholy union" with his white walker queen turned him into this -- it says on the wiki that "when he gave his seed he also gave his soul".
Â 
to theorize, i think what we've seen here isn't quite the tip of the iceberg as far as the WWs are concerned. not just yet. i think the night's king turned WW and, having lived (or whatever passes for living with them) as one among them for some 8000 years, is something of a big shot in WW culture (or whatever passes for culture with them). but he isn't the great other, and he's not even a full-blood (or whatever passes for blood with them) WW, nor are craster's babies.
Â 
and i don't like the way he looks. it seems somehow cheap. he doens't look as cool as a proper WW, and those horns... meh.
Â 
as for the rider that takes the baby, the first thing i thought was "hey, it's coldhands", but now i don't think so. he's just a mook, sent to retrieve offerings. although his hair looks like benjen's in an extremely suggestive way....
4698	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	Â 
I guess we'll get tons more spoilers from now on. I knew it would happen, but I didn't think this early.


Â 
We've already gotten a few (Jeyne not being pregnant, etc...) but this one was a huge one.
Â 
I would like someone to compile the facts that this spoiler confirms...for me, now we pretty know that the NK is alive and the fact that the Others can turn humans into Others, not only wights...also, we have thirteen guys standing there, and the Last Hero went there with 12 guys...

Â 
Frankly, I am very disappointed. Many theories I read on the web over the years were truly brilliant in terms of storytelling concepts.
I hadn't expected them to be so far off.
Â 
In contrast, that the series now seems to go the generic BBEG-Surrogate-Sauron route feels disheartening, mainly because it seems to point to a lack of conceptual foresight by GRRM.
Â 
Â 
I am particularly reminded of an RPG book people in the day decried to rip off Martin's "Land beyond the Wall", Fantasy Flight Games' "Midnight: The Heart of Shadow".
Well, I sure didn't think "Midnight" would in fact be so close!

Â 
Well, I don't know about turning babies into adults...but we know now that the Others, at least, can reproduce that way.
Â 
Now, the real question is...why turning some into Wights, and why turning those babies into Others? Maybe they can only turn guys into Others if they are alive, but when they died, they can only become Whights...

It really is too early to tell, though. For all the talk of this scene being a "spoiler", there still was a distinct lack of information and a lot more questions raised. I wouldn't spit the dummy just yet; on GRRM or D&D's behalf.

This didn't ruin anything for me and I'm a book reader first and foremost.
Â 
You know what's unprofessional? An author who thinks so very little of what is clearly his lifes work that he drags his feet long enough to let a show about it pass him by. He had plenty of warning...between pre-production and the four seasons he's had 6 years+...he could have easily gotten WoW out by now if he'd cut down on every other peripheral thing he's involved with.
Â 
Frankly at this point I'm just glad I'm seeing resolution somewhere...I have zero faith GRRM will ever finish this. WoW could literally be the Battles of Ice and Fire being wrapped up then every other character just walking around longer going someplace, with Martin deciding he'll need a book 8.

They can change Locke instead of Vargo, but not the NK being alive instead of Stannis being the NK, or Jon, or anyone else. The fact that HBO removed the "Night's King" reference of the guide and changed it for "White Walker" speak volumes, IMO.

4716	Der Anarch	2014-04-28	From the wiki
Â 
''While on his way north,Â Bran StarkÂ recalls stories told to theÂ StarkÂ children of the Night's King and the Nightfort byÂ Old Nan, servant inÂ Winterfell. She said some people believe the Night's King was aÂ Bolton, aÂ MagnarÂ out of Skagos, anÂ Umber, aÂ Flint, aÂ Norrey, or aÂ Woodfoot, who ruled Bear Island before theÂ ironmenÂ came. However, she identifies the Night's King as a Stark of Winterfell and brother to the King of the North and hints his name too was Bran.''
Â 
So, 13 Lord Commanders. 13 ''people'' in that scene. Jon is the LC, and also brother to the King in the North.
Â 
my mind is about to colapse. I guess after ''Mercy'' adjustment, and now this, either TWOW is arriving anytime after this season, or GRRM is giving too much away


Â 
Old Nan's wrong, it's obviously the Umbers.
4717	Der Anarch	2014-04-28	So... The Others are Misogynistic.
Now female Others allowed?


Â 
Perhaps they leave the girls to breed more males, since I doubt they reproduce by themselves. Perhaps that whole ultra-Freudian setup at Crasters Keep wasn't Crasters idea at all - perhaps it's just a human farm with a single male stud. I'd bet that there have been many more "Crasters" down the ages.

I've spent years trying to guide non-book reading friends away from spoilers that will cheapen the reveal of the tv show. If the writers cheapen any reveal of the books by putting it in the show ahead of schedule, that is a slap in the face.

I tend to give the show-runners more credit than a lot of people in the forums. I think they edited it out because they realized how massive a spoiler that was. Good thing we didn't catch it...Â

Â 
If we go into crackpot territory, it makes sense that the First Men were unable to build the Wall. Now, if the Wall was built by White Walkers, why can't undead Coldhands get through it? It should have a backdoor of sorts through which the White Walkers can go through. And why does it form a barrier for warging? And if the Wall was built by White Walkers... well, why man it with their enemies? Maybe they've built the Wall to ensure a perpetual winter North of it and the First Men built the castles to man it afterwards?


Â 
What if the Wall + Nights Watch were made to keep the wildlings on the Land of Always WInter, to fuel the future WW army?
Â 
Â 
Also, the location of the altar looks very much like the source of a (frozen) river... i'm not sure if it's the Milkwater. I think the Thenns control it's source

I tend to give the show-runners more credit than a lot of people in the forums. I think they edited it out because they realized how massive a spoiler that was. Good thing we didn't catch it...Â  


That's one way to look at it and that's what I thought at first. But i'm still lowering my expectations now that we have no way to know for sure. I would say i'm now 75% sure it was actually the Night's King.Â 
Â 
On another note, i'm not sure why this has raised further speculation of Starks having 'Other' blood. We're told that the Night's King was merely the brother of the Lord of Winterfell who was corrupted by an Other. That means the Stark line branches off from that point and any offspring the Night's King might have had isn't part of the Stark bloodline.
4730	Lann Casterly	2014-04-28	After I first watched it I was blown away, and thought some huge spoilers had been revealed.
But the more I thought about it, I was still blown away, but don't think too much has been revealed or explained.  
It remains to be seen if this is even something GRRM told them, or an extrapolation of their own based on the statements of Craster's wives.
I think in time we may learn more that will make this scene even bigger in hindsight, but this really didn't answer anything.
As it concerns the books, it may or may not confirm something that Craster's wives believe in the books.
We will likely have to wait and find out.
If this IS legitimately based on info from GRRM, there's still a million questions.  Probably more than before.
I am not worried about being spoiled.  The books haven't been written, so they are going to be different, and they are going to tell the story the way GRRM wants it told.  There will be no comparison.  I am enjoying this all I can now.  The experience with the books will be on a whole other level.
4731	Justin Danford	2014-04-28	And they raise the baby to Other(WW) adulthood?
What the hell?


Â 
Yeah and back home in the heart of winter there are toddler others, and tween others, and teenage others (who the elder others just don't get) always getting into trouble.

4732	TheWeepingMan	2014-04-28	So, who's it going to be who fights the Night's King at the end of ADOS? Jon? Melisandre? Drogon? Sam? - Well, considering the fact that he's not a mythological idea anymore, someone has to. Unless he simply dies when the One Ring is destroyed by Gollum - oh wait.
4733	Chebyshov	2014-04-28	Â 
Yeah and back home in the heart of winter there are toddler others, and tween others, and teenage others (who the elder others just don't get) always getting into trouble. It's like, an other these days just wants to snowboard and and ice-skate but the rents always have to be like "No, son, you must arrange these severred arms in a cyclone pattern and march on the wall."

4734	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	And they raise the baby to Other(WW) adulthood?
What the hell?


Â 
Well...maybe. But this is some big shit right here.
4735	Le Noir Faineant	2014-04-28	Â 
It really is too early to tell, though. For all the talk of this scene being a "spoiler", there still was a distinct lack of information and a lot more questions raised. I wouldn't spit the dummy just yet; on GRRM or D&D's behalf.


Â 
Ah, I surely hope so. It would be a shame if the answer to years of fan speculation would indeed just be a gritty variant to the second part of the Silmarilion.
4736	Starksmustwin	2014-04-28	Cold hands was a Wight, not a White Walker. Â  He had black cold hands, the same as the Wights that Jon killed. Â  Plus, he rides a live Elk, not a dead Horse.
Â 
Honestly, I think Cold Hands is a Wight given back his consciousness by Bloodraven.
4737	Onionworth	2014-04-28	This ending was so insane I had to actually make use of my forum account for once.
Â 
Sorry if this has been posted before - there are 13 WW's in that "council" with the Night's King as the head. He was originally the 13th Lord Commander. So the implication to me is that all 13 of these are the first Lord Commanders of the Night's Watch, who I guess were all turned from human adults into Others a long time ago.

4738	Tyranno	2014-04-28	I think some people jump to a lot of conclusions. We really don't know a lot about the White Walkers, as the scene raised more questions than it answered.Â 
Â 
Darth Other doesn't look like a normal White Walker. So what exactly is he? Is he truly the Nights King, or was that an error? What did he do all those years?Â 
Â 
We know he did something to the kid, but not what. Does the kid turn into a wight? Does he turn into a White Walker? Or does he become a creature similar to the Nights King? Or something else entirely? Can they only perform this magic on living babies, or also on living adults? Why only take the boys?Â 
Â 
Who are those 13 Walkers, and why are they dressed differently than the Walkers from season 2 or the one Sam stabbed? Are they "original" Walkers, or were they also once Human? Who were they, if so? What is their plan?Â 
Â 
Also, I'm not going to complain about spoilers. Maybe this won't play out like this in the books, and it's just a divergence, not a spoiler.

Â 
I'm pretty much 100% convinced that HBO meant to call him the Night's King, especially considering they changed their synopsis after that. He looks different because he was human in the past - the 13th Lord Commander - maybe the WW that brought the baby was one of the "original" White Walkers that don't look human because they're "pure" - meaning they were always White Walkers. Also, it is VERY STRONGLY implied that the baby is being turned into a WW, not a wight. Yes, we don't actually see the whole thing, but it is so strongly implied that it is obvious. Why would they have such a specific ritual for a wight? It's obviouly being turned into a WW. As for the 13, read my post above yours.

You knew this was coming, the series overtaking the show. So either stop watching the series and wait 15 more years for the last books or stop complaining.
4742	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-28	WOW
Â 
I'm in shock after that scene. They just "spoiled" a huge part of the next book and maybe the final book aswell. I'm really not comfortable with someone else telling the story.
Â 
I always wondered what would happen next season when the Others pretty much disappear from the books so it looks like we will get bits and pieces from TWOW.

Very few "reveals" have been that interesting for me, it's the characters and the journey that make fiction and I don't see how this will interfere with that I remember a time before there was a 'spoiler' concept.Movie reviews of Hitchcock's Psycho reveled that Janet Leigh was murdered in something like less than 40 min. into the film,This was 1960. Janet Leigh was an A lister at the time.So that sounded spectacular, but that spoiler did not spoiler the movie for me.Times change. Spoilers still don't bother me!
4748	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-28	Â 
I tend to give the show-runners more credit than a lot of people in the forums. I think they edited it out because they realized how massive a spoiler that was. Good thing we didn't catch it...Â  

Ok but our opinions of the show runners aside... do they write the episode summaries or does some PR intern do it? Because while I wouldn't put it past D&D to blatantly change things -- even things this significant -- they definitely wouldn't be silly enough to put a huge spoiler in a flippin' episode summary.
4749	Daughter of Death	2014-04-28	You know what would be insanely awesome? If one those WW arrives at Craster's and kills Burn Gorman and the rest, and then identifies himself as Coldhands
Â 
I do think the WW are going to kill and eat some of those assholes. After all, cannibalism as a punishment of breaking the guest right is kind of a theme in the books


Â 
Â 


I hope CH shows up next episode and slaughters everyone at Craster's Keep, and takes Bran and company away to BR...and I hope CH=NK.


Â 
THIS was my initial thought! it would be the PERFECT use of CH. Then he helps to guide Bran and his jolly gang in the right direction (because you see, bran might know where he should go but he doesnt know the way). Â Oh please let this happen
4750	boojam	2014-04-28	Yeah and back home in the heart of winter there are toddler others, and tween others, and teenage others (who the elder others just don't get) always getting into trouble.

4751	lostinasia	2014-04-28	I always wondered what would happen next season when the Others pretty much disappear from the books so it looks like we will get bits and pieces from TWOW.Â 


I assume that's why they put this in. In the books the big threat, as introduced in the very first pages of Book 1, almost completely disappear for a couple of thousand pages. Such a narrative choice is ... interesting, to say the least. I'm not surprised they've decided to add a scene or two reminding the viewers that, yes, the White Walkers are still out there.
Â 
D&D, more moving the story and mythology forward please! The outrage about spoilers is hilarious. Possibly even funnier than listening to Bronn's banter.
4752	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-28	So do we know how the Others raise Wights? Do they need to be touched or do they just resurrect by themselves?
4753	Terere	2014-04-28	If the NK is a Stark, and all the Others created after the NK started running the show were either:
Â 
Created by the NK or;
Crastor's Kids
Â 
Then all the Others are Kin to Starks
Â 
Killing of Kin is supposed to be damned by all the Gods.
Â 
This gives a reason for Starks manning the wall and for there always being a Stark in Winterfell. The Others (assuming that they accept the "don't kill your kin" thing) would not be able to kill the Starks, and that would potentially create a ceasefire.
Â 
The other stuff about "Winter Is Coming", BloodRaven, Bran and the Stark-Others alliance could possibly tie into that Ragnarak Theory that was floating around the internet a few months ago. Does anyone still have a link?
4754	Areo Speedwagon	2014-04-28	So...what facts do we know now? I'd like someone to compile them
Â 
-The Others can turn human into Others
-The NK is alive
-There are thirteen Others in that shot...Last Hero anyone?
Â 
Go on and say more facts this episode gives us


Â 
What I believe we know from this scene:
Â 
- The Others have some form of social organization
- Maybe one, maybe all, or maybe just some Others have the ability to turn humans into Others
- There seemed to be towers or some form of structures on top of that mountain.Â 
- The transformation of human to Other can be done by, but may not be limited to, touch
Â 
Hopefully I don't get chagrined too hard here, but I think those are the only things we can truly know from this scene.Â  Most everything else is speculation, even that the Others built those towers on top of the mountain is speculation.Â  I think it's highly probable they did, but that scene didn't confirm it.

They may need help.
4756	Jasta11	2014-04-28	To people complaining about being ''spoiled'', 1) how is it a spoiler that Craster's babies are turned into WWs when the books heavily imply  it? 2) the rest might very well be a deviation, so I'm not seeing what's so bad and 3) after 4 years of show watchers having to watch out for spoilers everywhere, you'd think book readers would have the discipline to, you know, not watch the bloody show if they really fear to learn even a single scrap of information that might or might not be in the books anyway.

Hugely impractical. If you have the power to do it, and your goal is to grow your army, you just do it yourself. Conclusion: Only the guy with the crown can do the transformation.

-Okay, so the Night's King, who was a human once, is now a Human/Other hybrid due to sexing up a female Other, who can transform Humans? Interesting.
-I missed that. Where was that confirmed? They're being turned into actual Others, and not hybrids like the Nights King? If so, how did the original Others come into being? Were the first walkers also Humans that were taken by some magic (perhaps the Great Other?)

Â
4763	JesterX	2014-04-28	Another suspension of disbelief moment but . . .Â considering that it was so bitterly cold and the child was so skimpily clad that he shouldn't have even survived the trip to the White Walker spot?

Given that the babe rode with an ice zombie thing that has power over winter, I'm pretty sure he won't die from the cold if the WW doesn't allow it.

Â 
-Probably. That's why I think that you have to be alive to be turned into an Other. The NK wanted it, and his Ice Queen gave him that...gift. That would also explain why the deads rise as Wights and not as Others.
-http://i.imgur.com/G1pdcan.png . It was confirmed here. HBO has removed it now, too much spoiler, the Internet was on fire really.
-Yes, there are a lot of questions. Also, there's this theory: those 12 guys are the 12 LC of the NW that ruled before the NK. They look all in black.
4766	cybobbie	2014-04-28	One thing one couldn't help notice was the Other who brought the baby had a ponytail. Is there some significance to that ?


Well I don't believe that they would use a ponytail just to make the WW have a style, so I do get it as a clue that it's Benjen. Before I liked the idea that he could be CH but now I really think that he became a WW. I say that because considering the description on the book CH is not a WW, right?

4768	HMR	2014-04-28	Episode itself was not a major spoiler. We all expected that Craster's babies turn into WWs, well, apart from the crazy nutters who invent theories out of thin air for its own sake.
Â 
What WAS a major spoiler, if it turns out to be accurate, is the reveal of the Night's King in the synopsis. Major mistake letting some intern write them up, HBO. I can just see how it happened, some Unsullied TV exec heard the WW being called NK by D&D and when asked by his intern "Sir, what should we call the WW at the end?" he said "Ah, what did they call him, Dark Prince, Gloom Lord, uhhh, Night's King, that's the one!"

Fail.
Â 
On the other hand, I am very glad that NK's story will be (hopefully, fully) revealed to us, as it has always been a favourite of mine.
4769	The Prophet of Patch	2014-04-28	If the NK is a Stark, and all the Others created after the NK started running the show were either:

Â

Â 
The other stuff about "Winter Is Coming", BloodRaven, Bran and the Stark-Others alliance could possibly tie into that Ragnarak Theory that was floating around the internet a few months ago. Does anyone still have a link?


Â 
So much this! The Ragnarok theory came to mind pretty quick for me as well (parts of it, at least). I'd give you the link, but I see someone beat me to it.
Â 
The show has dropped some seemingly pretty major hints that BR/CoTF are not what they seem, and I think this only adds to it. Crows and WW's together seems to be recurring imagery, and Bran's "message" from BR a few eps ago had a lot of WW-related material.
4770	FCOS	2014-04-28	So we now know that the others can turn babies/(all people?) into more others . This raises the question why do white walkers generally kill people first. If they all can turn anyone into a white walker, it would make sense to capture people, then turn them, instead of outright killing them, and making writes. In the books others can shatter steel swords easily, so disarming someone, and touching them should be easy. They're also noted as having few known weaknesses other then dragonglass, so they could fairly easily waltz into the battle field touching people here and there. The fact that they dont do this means either:
1)not all white walkers have this ability, or
2)not all humans have the potential to become a white walker.
The first option seems to be probable, as if all of them had the ability, why did the first dude not do it on the way to the land of always winter. Maybe its an ability only available to the Night king (or possibly one of the other 12), or maybe it can only be done in the land of always winter where the others could have some sort of 'extra power'. It could also be linked with the reintroduction of magic to the world/ red comet/ dragons etc. but this also wouldn't make as much sense as they couldn't do it (as far as we know) before, and they've been doing it (as far as we know) for longer then the dragons have been around.
Â 
They're just my thoughts. Input?
Â 
Edit: Just remembered Craster only ever sends out sons. Is it a male only process? We know that female others are a thing. Or is the son only thing just because he enjoys his daughters so much?

I don't think any of those are facts. Here are the facts:

* Darth Blue hasÂ spiky hornlike appendages on his dome.
* Um...
Â 
I will add:
Â 
* Some poor intern on the HBO web team is probably unemployed this morning.
Â 
It's pretty hilarious all the speculation that scene has touched off. OMG the Starks are Others!!11!

To be fair we haven't seen a female white walker on the show as of yet.Â  They could be total babes lol lol.

Thanks JesterX I really didn't recall that part. I'm rereading the books but still a long way to get to there
4775	Takiedevushkikakzvezdy	2014-04-28	This was a huge moment for the series and the books, GoT officaly passed the books for the first time in one aspect of the story, first of many.


Maybe it`s something that D&D have come up with on their own?
4776	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-28	On a very positive note its great to see more hi fantasy elements in the show.
Â 
This is something straight out of Dungeons and Dragons. I'm pretty sure I played that location in Icewind Dale 2.
4777	Hippocras	2014-04-28	Â 
Not necessary. The NK is their King, so, probably, this was some kind of ritual. Maybe he chooses the whoever deserves to become an Other, and whoever doesn't.


Â 
But Â that is just a distinction between the king being the only one "legally" capable of converting babies, or the king being the only one "inherently" capable. But it amounts to the same thing. When the normal Others kill people they become wights. The conversion of babies into Others is something else that only the King can do, for whatever reason - inherent capability or legal right to do so within their social order.

4778	JesterX	2014-04-28	So we now know that the others can turn babies/(all people?) into more others . This raises the question why do white walkers generally kill people first. If they all can turn anyone into a white walker, it would make sense to capture people, then turn them, instead of outright killing them, and making writes. In the books others can shatter steel swords easily, so disarming someone, and touching them should be easy. They're also noted as having few known weaknesses other then dragonglass, so they could fairly easily waltz into the battle field touching people here and there. The fact that they dont do this means either:
1)not all white walkers have this ability, or
2)not all humans have the potential to become a white walker.
The first option seems to be probable, as if all of them had the ability, why did the first dude not do it on the way to the land of always winter. Maybe its an ability only available to the Night king (or possibly one of the other 12), or maybe it can only be done in the land of always winter where the others could have some sort of 'extra power'. It could also be linked with the reintroduction of magic to the world/ red comet/ dragons etc. but this also wouldn't make as much sense as they couldn't do it (as far as we know) before, and they've been doing it (as far as we know) for longer then the dragons have been around.
Â 
They're just my thoughts. Input?


Â 
I think age has something to do with whether a human can become a full white walker.Â  Either that or there's something inherent in Craster's blood/genes that enables them to turn his kin.Â  I think the same process when done on fully grown, or dead, or possibly NOT Craster's kin, turns them into wights.
4779	Ingelheim	2014-04-28	Maybe it`s something that D&D have come up with on their own?


Â 
Nah, this is Martin stuff.
4780	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-04-28	I'am reading the forums for quite a while now, this is my first post.
Â 
Isn't is possible that the mentioning of the "Night's Kings" by HBO was just a mistake? IIRC they never came up with this story of Old Nan about the "Night's King" being a Stark in the show. Ygritte only once mentioned, that the historical "Night's King" was a member of the NW in one of the "History and Lore" Videos.
Â 
The historical Night's King, being the 13th Lord Commander of the NW, would be nearly 10.000 years old. Isn't that a much too long time hiding in the Lands of Always Winter? The "Night's King" also was a human, and this guy in the show just looked like a Zabrak from Star Wars. Sure, he looked different from the other White Walkers, but still non-human. So maybe we saw a offspring of the first Night's King?
But maybe "Night's King" is just a title for the leader of the White Walkers in the show and he doesn't have the background from the books? So I think it isn't much of a spoiler, they only have shown us the leader of the Walkers, bearing the title of "Night's King".

I am more inclined to believe that the Others can only turn people into Others if the are alive. Because, if you are right...how did the NK turned into an Other? IMO, he asked her Ice Queen to become one, and the lady gave him that gift.
4782	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	Who says the NK is a hybrid? What logic is that based on? He was a human. Humans can become Others due to teh power of certain Others. He was under the influence of an Other. He is now an Other.

Â 
Only the guy at the end or one of his 12 friends can do this, presumably. Otherwise what would be the point of the WW traveling all that way? The WW's seem to only be able to turn corpses into wights. This other power only belongs to 1 or 13 dudes, presumably the Last Hero and his companions.
Â 
I do like the thought that perhaps the icy altar area has some power, and perhaps that's why the 13 creeps dwell there. So many clues but that only brings up more questions 

I expect the community to have a lot of fun with this over the next few weeks. Personally, this just gave more credence to the idea that Bran and BR (And possibly Jon Snow) are not going to be "Saving the world" so much as ambiguously fighting on one side of ancient war.
4784	Tyranno	2014-04-28	Â 
-Probably. That's why I think that you have to be alive to be turned into an Other. The NK wanted it, and his Ice Queen gave him that...gift. That would also explain why the deads rise as Wights and not as Others.
-http://i.imgur.com/G1pdcan.png . It was confirmed here. HBO has removed it now, too much spoiler, the Internet was on fire really.
-Yes, there are a lot of questions. Also, there's this theory: those 12 guys are the 12 LC of the NW that ruled before the NK. They look all in black.


-Can we really refer to them as "Others" though? They're not quite the same as orginal Others I'd say.Â 
-I see that they say the kid's eyes turned "White Walker blue". Does that guarantee he'll be a full blown Walker and not a Hybrid?
-How did they all turn into Others though? That means they all left while still alive, got turned into Others (by who, another Other who can transform Humans) and sat around waiting for the Nights King, who didn't turn into an Other, but more like a Hybrid?Â
4785	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	And the fact that he's 10,000 years old is irrelevant because he's not human any more...

-Well, the show calls them WW. So you are right then.
-I don't think he's a hybrid. There are this theories about the Others being a species of their own, but now, it seems more likely they are just humans who played too far with Ice magic. I don't think there are hybrids between them. But, of course, this guarantees nothing. We just can't know now.
-IMO, they are the 12 guys who went with the LH. Because if they were LC, my theory would be wrong. IMO, to become an Other you need to be alive, and it's impossible those 12 guys were alive at the same time. But then, they could have turned into Others one by one, which would work.

He became one by blood magic most likely. So he could "live" and rule forever. Possibly by sacrificing kin.

Its not only the WW's who have blue eyes. The baby could have just been turned into a wight. It would make sense, wight aren't all rotten, they look like whatever they looked like when they were wight-afied. So the baby was just killed?Â

Yeah clearly the Others are men who've been transformed, why they would want babies in particular, male children in particular though? So the NK is important? So many new questions, I'll let it all sink in.Â 
Â 
On another note is GRRM happy that a mjor plot thread for his next books has just been revealed by the TV show? I guess at the rate he's writing we'll have to get used to it. Maybe this is a sign that the TV producers aren't going to bother at all about spoilers.

They can turn any corpse into a wight, makes no sense that they would cut a deal with Craster, collect the babies and transport them north just for an extra wight now and then. They have thousands of them.

Now obviously there is something going on the behind the scenes, which we don't know about, but that something could involve a "baby zombie (lol grumdin)" just as easily as a baby wight.
If it was the prodution of wights, why not take babys from the clanns nearer the Lands of always winter? Why Craster?

White Walkers and Others are the same. The show call them ONLY WW because of Lost. There were some guys called the "Others" there. The books calls them WW sometimes, also. They are a species on their own. Now...that species is based on humans turned like that because of Ice Magic, that's what the show implies here. And that is a big SPOILER.
Â 
The Wights are not Others. They cannot rise more Whights, and can be killed with fire and swords. The Others can't. Also, the Others have magical powers while the Wights don't.

What is useful about a baby wight though?Â  why turn a baby into a wight, is it going to bash at your toes or something.Â  And if so, why not just kill the baby when you get it?Â  Why travel far and place it on an altar?

Actually, only a few weeks.
4821	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	I'm backing the "must be willingly given" theory for why Craster and not the other wildling babies. As to why they have to take babies to the castley place, the only idea I have is that until it's Winter the Others are restricted in their movements. Otherwise in book time they are being as slow to attack the Wall/wildlings in Book 5 as Dany is to invade Westeros
4822	JesterX	2014-04-28	Â 
Maybe.Â 
Â 
This still does not explain why the King did the conversion and not the Other who brought the baby North. If any old Other could convert babies, the show would not have bothered showing the King doing it.


Â 
It makes sense, if they have a hive-like society, that only a few (maybe even only one) of them can reproduce.Â

The Night's King was most likely a Stark too...very interesting.
Â 
Looked like the Land of Always Winter, and there seemed to be some sort of castles or towers in the background on that big mountain.
Â 
As a book reader who read first read the series in 2005, I don't mind these reveals. It's about damn time for the story to move forward.
Â 
This. Great to get answers and that scene was amazing. Good eye on the Ice/Stone circle too. I am in the belief that Starks have "Other" blood in their veins.

But for those first 3 seasons, I have to say I thought it was absolutely amazing that there was a TV show doing fantasy this well. It's hard to explain, but there was something so novel about seeing all these exciting plot twists play out on a TV screen instead of, well, a novel. When has there ever been a fantasy story that we haven't enjoyed for the first time as a book? Every other genre gets well-served by original material in film or television, even sci-fi; but with fantasy we only ever get our minds blown by words on a page.

Â 
I thought it was oddly beautiful.. I wasn't really sure what to expect upon NK picking up the baby but I assumed it would stop crying - I didn't anticipate that bit of a smile on the babies face especially given how horrid he looks.
Â 
Hopefully this A. Makes show-watchers a bit more intrigued by Bran's arc (not incredibly likely but /shrug) and B. Gives the correct implication that in the long-term this story is much more than quarreling over a chair/power.
Â 
No doubt in my mind that this was intended to spoil the shit out of people but in show terms they sort of have to start laying down minor threads for S6 in the next 15 or so episodes (very minor I'm sure as I don't expect anything that massive at least until S5)
4838	jet199	2014-04-28	Like the red priests seem to have different skills (shadowbinding/birthing, kiss of fire, visions) the Others probably have different skills too. One WW might be good at riding a dead horse for hundreds of miles but another Other is better at otherizing babes and his mate is better at making screaming ice swords.
4839	Lord Varys	2014-04-28	We don't really know if this Night's King is the Night's King. If he is, then a bunch of other questions follow:
Â 
1. Why do the Others create other Others out of male human children via the Night's King when the Night's King is also a converted/created Other?
Â 
2. Why do the Others nowadays only transform infants, at least as far as we know, if they once could/did transform adults (i.e. the Night's King).
Â 
3. What's the original origin of the Others, if the present Others seem to be mostly formerly humans? Was the first Other a human who reshaped himself into an ice-creature and then started to pass on the curse via a magic ritual? If so, why the hell would anyone want to become an Other in the first place?
Â 
4. Is there an actual 'original Other species' out there, or all they all gone now? The Tad-Williams-angle of GRRM's inspiration always indicated that the Others might be a tribe/group of Children of the Forest who searched and found a way to successfully defeat the First Men invaders.
Â 
5. If the Others are all former humans, what the fuck is the quarrel between humans and Others about? Was 'becoming an Other' merely the means of the first human turned Other to become immortal/win the game that was back then fought with bronze swords and magic?

You're right.Â  Everyone is sorta "assuming" that the WW King is/was the NK.Â  I'm not so sure of that, myself.
4841	Mark Antony	2014-04-28	You're right.Â  Everyone is sorta "assuming" that the WW King is/was the NK.Â  I'm not so sure of that, myself.
Definitely not sure either 
It seems this ending while "spoiling" us book readers really just served to open up many more questions that we have to wait to find out about :/
4842	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-28	&nbsp; &nbsp;
We've known that they can turn adults since the prologue. When Ser Waymar is changed into a wight and strangles young Will. Also we see that some of the mutineers are turned. The two who attack Mormont. And even in the Varamyr prologue chapter.
Turning a child, if it is truly book canon, means that the wights aren't just mindless zombies sometimes. Perhaps they can even age. We know the Others can turn humans and animals. And possibly even control the weather. Some theorize that they built The Wall to keep the men away. So them being able to 'convert' a baby into an adult Other is not out of question (especially after tonight's episode).


I don't think that the Night's King turned the baby into a wight. I think another Other was created on the altar of the Old Gods in the middle of an Icehenge with 10 stones.Â
4843	Needs More Salt	2014-04-28	First and foremost, I'd personally like to thank all of those who are constantly whining about how the show and the books deviate so markedly. Without you, these forums would be significantly less entertaining. Rather than enjoy the alternate story that HBO & The Gang have presented, you instead decided to relentlessly bitch about how it's inconsistent with the books. For a while, I thought that the millions of whacked-out theories that inhabit these forums would be open to yet another interpretation by the show's television producers, but boy was I wrong. So thank you. I mean it. The never-ending flow of tears was more than I could have ever asked for.Â 
Â 
As to the OP, I'm not sure that the show's interpretation of Others reproducing is necessarily going to be the same as in the books (Yay! More bitching!). The show suffers from a serious case of 'How the hell do we show all of this in just 60 minutes without making it suck?' that the baby sacrifice may have been easier and more cinematic to portray in that way. I'd put more weight into the palace in the Lands of Always Winter and that little Others council and Night's King than I would the whole baby ordeal.Â 
Â 
The ending of the show and the books may coincide, but I'm personally genuinely hoping for two completely different story lines.Â
4844	Chebyshov	2014-04-28	Â 
You're right.Â  Everyone is sorta "assuming" that the WW King is/was the NK.Â  I'm not so sure of that, myself.


Â 
They're assuming it because it said so in an official HBO synopsis last night (edited out now). I'm inclined to believe it, but I understand why some aren't taking it as gospel.Â
4845	LordToo-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse	2014-04-28	This is what i make of it..
Â 
1) Only the Night King can turn babies into WW
2) He only turns CrasterÂ´s.. so there must be something special about his line.
3) there is some sort of WW creation ritual, that goes on LoAW, at the Heart of Winter, that the show calls "the ice city"..so WW have some sort of civilization.
4) there are different types of WW.. Night King is the leader,.. but there seems to be 12 other WW of importance..
5) The WW who takes the baby to the ice city wears black armour...every other WW we saw until now, was half-naked, even the one who tried to steal gillyÂ´s baby.. so we have some sort of intermediate WW.. or he was one of the 12.. Then again book WWs wear armour, just completely different from this.
Â 
The 12 + Night King seems like a clue.. either we are talking about the first NightÂ´s wathc LCs.. or the Last hero + friends.. I canÂ´t see how both can be relevant at the same time...
4846	Mark the Red	2014-04-28	I would like to address a few points I have seen so far on this thread:
Â 
(a) Minas Morgul comparisons to the Other homeland. Â  Because its mountainous and dark? Â I thought the show did well here. Â It looked very northern and dark and COLD. Â Really, really cold.
Â 
(b Â )Â Crasters children becoming Others. Â  I believe we all knew this happened so I really don't see this as a great spoiler. Â Mayhaps the reason they only do it for babies is because they have not been baptized / sworn oaths into another faith?. Â I don't believe the babies automatically "age" up. Â The dragons take a while to grow, why not Others?
Â 
(c ) Don't care about Coldhands. Sick to death hearing about him or lack thereof. Â Reminds of all the whining about the lack of "Weasel soup" in season 2. Â Not a critical plot element people. Â  I bet GRRM wrote that character while hunting because he saw an elk. Â I mean he wrote the character Patrek of King's Mountain as a NFL smack talk rival gag for his buddy, why not Coldhands for some Elk riding love?
Â 
(d) Â Without doubt this was the cruelest and darkest episode of GOT yet made. Â Mass rape and woman abuse galore. Â Babies abandoned in the snow to "die". Â Animal cruelty. Â Meera beatings. Â Geez, I'm glad the Others came along and cheered up the place. Â Really.
Â 
(e) Â Crackpot Theory:Â  Â I absolutely love the Others reveal of this show.Â  With this latest reveal and the common crow / white walker symmetry throughout the show, I am now almost certain the Others and NW are closely related. Â My theory is that the Others were / are an out of control experiment / creation of the Children of the Forest during their war with the first Men. Â  The wall was created to keep the men out of the north and not the Others out of the south not what we see it to be. Â The Great Other is a female leader / child of the the Children of the Forest hell bent on revenge for the destruction of their weirwoods. Â

I wouldn't have assumed he was the Night's King had people not pointed out the synopsis. To me, it looked like a council of Others all huddling around some sort of relic where they performed the ritual. I thought the barbed head was just how some of them looked :/
4849	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-04-28	But only because HBO (mistakenly?) stated that this Walker is called "Night's King", doesn't mean that he has to be that very same NW-Commander from 10.000 years ago.

Â 
It does make you wonder as to who each one of these characters would be, if they were to represent Gods from Norse mythology. Fenris as Bran and Bloodraven as Loki is awesome. Jon Snow as Surtur with his fire blade that scorches the earth is great too. If Victarion is Hrym then how is Dany the leviathan? That one doesn't sit well with me.Â

4854	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-28	So far, the north has in many ways been a mirror image of the south. Now, we know that babies who are offsprings of incest of a certain bloodline in the north are mirrored in a way by Targaryen babies who are mostly also a product of incest (at least they were before and in the aftermath of the conquest of Westeros). What Rhaegar Targaryen has done with Lyanna Stark is that he actually merged the two opposing lines (since the Night's King is most probably as Stark). He created a Song of Ice and Fire - Jon Snow. Let's see how his gene pool reacts to the Others.

To go north, you must journey south, to reach the west you must go east. To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.

I mean, it's nothing that a three-penny charlatan of a prophet wouldn't come up with, but the dialectic perseveres
4861	tf13	2014-04-28	I had the initial speculation that the baby was somehow going to be brought back to the Wall for the "switch" that Jon pulls.Â  But couldn't really make sense of it.
4862	The Old Tongue	2014-04-28	We just received a TWOW spoiler, I hope there is no more of it or I'll stop watching the show, they have tons of stuff to shoot and they spoil TWOW for us, really?
Â 
There are like part of ASOS and tons of stuff of AFFC and ADWD.
Not really a spoiler. It's already been stated in the books by one of Crasters wives that when his sons are placed in the forest, the child's brothers (Crasters sons) come to claim it.
I don't even feel like the reveal of the Land of always winter was a spoiler since we know there's an evil up north gearing up for war and an attack requires organization. All the episode did was imply this by showing a sort of heirarchy among the Others. Word is that was the Night's King we saw but I'm reluctant to fully accept it. We saw many figures in black: who's to say the one we saw up close was any different than the rest.

The Others being Jotun, aka Ice Giants, as well.Â

The other interpretation could be that Bloodraven is actually the one-eyed God, Odin. Given his connection to ravens, this fit seems more natural. In turn, the entire theory would have to be flipped and/or readjusted.Â 
Â 
The references to Norse mythology are there, but I don't necessarily agree with the interpretation. For example, Joffrey as Balder is weak. Likewise, Melisandre as Hel is shaky as well. And where is Hermes?

Â There is a blue rose growing from the Wall - a Winter Rose Lyanna was so fond of. So, we have Aegon and Elia in the foreground with RT - his official family. In the background we have his unofficial family. That was a very clear scene imho.

If you really wanna know "who is Hermes", I suggest get into the Arminius/Hermann saga. It is basically Mance word by word. And his emblem is the helmet nowadays associated with Hermes.

4867	howardh51	2014-04-28	I've never even mentioned Coldhands before in a show thread ever? I was just pointing out the guy on the horse seemed to be wearing what looked like the same armor the Nights Watch wear and since he's also riding around on a mount and was just near Bran and Crasters I don't think it was out of place at all to mention that this could potentially be Coldhands.
But thank you for the rude response with no sort of point or evidence to back up what you said.

Dude - Look up "casting" for the show - no "Coldhands"...

4870	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-28	Â There is a blue rose growing from the Wall - a Winter Rose Lyanna was so fond of. So, we have Aegon and Elia in the foreground with RT - his official family. In the background we have his unofficial family. That was a very clear scene imho.


Â 
Except she asks him if he'll write "Him" a song (Referring to Aegon), to which he replies that he already has a song. I get the imagery in the background, what I was saying is it was weird for Rhaegar to assume Aegon's song is Ice and Fire when he's just Fire and....Sand? Snake?

Coldhands is not Benjen.
Did you forget that Bran KNOWS his uncle, including voice and manerisms as well as appearance and body type, has a direwolf that can remember familiar smells (Nymeria smelling Cat floating in the river) and was traveling with Coldhands for months? Yet he did not notice he was traveling with his uncle?

4876	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-04-28	The thing that I don't get is why the Night's King seems to be the overlord of the Others. The Night's King was a living man who turned into a White Walker several thousand years ago. He was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and guarded the Wall against the Others, who predated him for an untold, possibly very, very long period time. If he has managed to survive over eight millenniums, shouldn't that mean that the life expectancy for a White Walker is extremely long? Or that they are immortal unless violently killed A  laÂ Tolkein's Elar? So shouldn't there be some White Walkers with seniority over the Night's King? They've been invading Westeros as far as history dates so why would they suddenly unite under this guy? For what purpose?

Well, I'm sure that RT and his great-uncle Aemon had many theories and researched many things, because they were the curious intellectuals rather than power crazed warriors in the family of Fire&Blood. As Aemon said before his death, they thought many wrong things and changed their approaches and perceptions. One has to have both northern and southern lore, history and knowledge available in order to make some sense out of it. So far, only Mance Rayder seems like the guy who knows both. And Aemon, but he is dead.
4879	Mark Antony	2014-04-28	Coldhands may be introduced in the last episode which is titled "the children".
I don't think so, the whole point of the Coldhands character is to get Bran & CO to the cave safely. The title of the episode implies Bran will be reaching the cave in that episode, seems pointless to introduce CH then
4880	mediterraneo	2014-04-28	Â 
There are huge implications from this revelation:
Â 
Other (pun intended) things to consider:
Â 
-HBO confirmed the Other at the end was the Night's King
Â 
-The Night's King was in a line of 13 of these "ruling" Others.Â 
Â 
-The Night's King was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
Â 
This raises the question, do past Lord Commanders of the Watch become these ruling class of Others (or at least until the Night's King did)? This episode seems to imply so. This in turn raises the question, is the entire Watch a sham? Is the Watch itself a pawn of the Others? Was the wall really erected to protect Westeros from the Others or is it their own creation? If so, was Bran the Builder an Other, and if so is the entire Stark line descended from the White Walkers? If that's so, then maybe Jon as the Great Other reborn and Dany as Azor Ahai reborn is confirmed from just this one scene. Will Melisandre try to bring back Jon in TWOW, only to have him be reborn a White Walker? There are huge, plot-shattering implications from this simple short show spoiler.
Â 
This was stuff that book readers were not meant to see. It's spoiler territory. But HBO gonna HBO, and the show was bound to pass the books eventually given the speed of GRRM's writing.
Â 


Â 
Well, I lost part of the thread: I wanted to poke a thing about the number 13.
The night King's was the 13th Lord Commander.
It may be that the White Walkers are the true Watch as they had to be...
Swearing for this night and all the nights to come.
THe new, "human" ones could be ignorant Andals haveing destroyed things they didn't understand...

4882	'96Buck	2014-04-28	The whole Craster's sons thing has me really wondering .... what happens to them once they are Others? Obviously they aren't a 'baby' anymore - so do they 'grow up' somehow instantly? All of those figures behind the head honcho were full grown man sized beings. Craster's sons would be of all different ages over the years from babies to young adults. Not that it really matters, but the magic of the Great Other must age them up somehow too.
Â 
Â 


OrÂ  some or all of Craster's other sons are of various other sizes but were not present for the ritual.

Seniority doesn't necessarily mean they are superior in status?
Maybe Otherland is a democracy?Â 
GRRM stated in numerous occasions that the Others are much more than mindless ice zombies - it wouldn't be surprised if their society was much more advanced and peaceful than that of the men of Westeros.
Are they Engineers.. and the Wights are their Xenomorphs?

Â 
At least it's the first time we can be sure about it. Remember Melisandre telling Arya that they are going to "meet again"? That could very well happen in the books.
Â 
Plus, the latest TWOW sample chapter (Mercy) clearly inspired two scenes in season 4: Polliver's death and the "reenactment" of the war of the 5 kings at Joffrey's wedding. (Not sure if that counts as spoiler though: those who've read the chapter recognize it, others will when they read TWOW somewhere in the future).

Looks like they don't care too much about spoiling the book readers.

I don't think so, CH is a servant of Bloodraven IMO not a baby picker upper to the WW. Anyway I recall someone posting a video where John Bradley (Sam) says CH was cut so I doubt he's in the series.

There's a lot I forget, I got rusty. Wasn't really expecting this entire Bran thing speeding and changing this much, so I havent re-read everything yet.
4892	Camara	2014-04-28	I think it's possible that Darth Other and Coldhands are father and son (or vice versa). They both look more human-esque that the rest of others, and they look like they are connected to the real "Night's King".
Â 
I also think Coldhands is on the good side. So if both are correct then it is either trying to stop his son or father from destroying whatever the Others are trying to destroy.

					
					
							Edited by Camara, 28 April 2014 - 12:25 PM.
4893	Stark11	2014-04-28	So if we actually see Coldhands, then we will know what he looks like. Unless they show a hooded man with hands like WW and very blue eyes behind a hood. What if he really does like like Ben Stark, or it's obvious he is the Nights King? Won't that spoil what we may find out in TWOW. Is everyone going to b**** about that too? Maybe GRRM told them no Coldhands cause depicting him on TV would give away his identity? 
I don't see this scene with the others as a spoiler from TWOW. As D&D said it's their interpretation of what is implied to be happening in the books. This is no different then the Theon scenes from season 3, Littlefinger and Vary's scenes etc. that are not in the books cause those character don't have POV's. This is simply D&D's take on what is happening to Crasters babies after they leave Jon/SAMs POV's. No big deal to me. And I'm sure GRRM knew that this was going to happen, he's a executive producer on the show, he knows what their going to do. Also we have to accept the fact the show is going to get ahead of the books and just deal with it. Also I would not be surprised if we don't see anymore WW's the rest of the season.
4894	northernmonkey	2014-04-28	I don't think so, CH is a servant of Bloodraven IMO not a baby picker upper to the WW. Anyway I recall someone posting a video where John Bradley (Sam) says CH was cut so I doubt he's in the series.


Â 
Well they're not mutually exclusive. Mel says that BR is a champion of the great other, so Coldhands could be on the side of the WW and BR.
Â 
And I might be wrong, but I think the interview with John Bradley talking about CH getting cut was after season 3, and he was talking about Sam and Gilly not meeting CH like they do in the books. So CH could still feature.
4895	darksellsword	2014-04-28	soooo They have 100 of craster's sons as white walkers now if I recall correctly he boasted about having 99 sons and last nights baby was the 100th.
I have so many theories now . first up are crasters sons exempt from the spell the blocks the whitewalkers from passing through the wall? Is gilly's baby now very significant considering its the only son of craster that hasn't been sacrificed ?

And if its 99 WW, are these it? Are there more? Are they all Craster's son?
As more this discussion goes on, the more I get the feeling that there is a major plot change, likely changed content to what GRRM had originally planned. Maybe some plottwist he would like changed down the road. Or, right next door, or something.

sure i could buy that they could be half human descendant of NK and his queen buuut there is this small issue with the children claiming CH died along time ago. so he was once human and also he is almost confirmed to be a former brother of the nights watch... so.. it's a bit conflicting to say the least.

You believe that?
4899	acacia	2014-04-28	Not sure if its been mentioned but im sure the producers were trolling us with the WW on the horse, when the camera pans behind him you see his hair is tied back like Benjen's was, after all the speculation from earlier in the year when you see this WW on the horse i think they are playing up to the CH = Benjen fans. Not saying the WW are the fashion icons of Westeros but why have the hair tied back in that specific style when the rest of him looks so messy?

"Fell"
Â 
Beaten, not necessarily killed (and in this world death isn't as absolute as one would think, particularly when The Others are involved)
Â 
Oh Old Nan you scamp, such clever word choice in your storytelling 
Â 
Â 
Also I think just like with the Long Night/Prince That Was Promised/Azor Ahai story, the details have gotten a little warped (to fit an agenda, and due to forgetfulness and getting farther removed from the actual event) over the centuries.Â  If The Night's King is The Ultimate Traitor so horrible his real name is stricken from official records, then obviously that side would have to tell the story ending with his destruction (so don't try following his footsteps!) whether he actually was killed or merely deposed.


Â 
His name stricken from records.... reminds me of how Melisandre always refers to the god of death and darkness as he who can't be named.Â  Could this be a clue that NK is the Great Other?

4903	Oldgodsnewtricks	2014-04-28	Kind of a side-note: given the ice-henge thing surrounding the ice altar is clearly part of magic ritual, this suggests interesting possibilities about the WW 'artistic' arrangements in earlier episodes, no? - the horse-parts spiral in the snow, and the corpses in the very first scene of S1.

Bran captured yet again, this time by Night's Watch rejects, held captive, gonna get freed by Jon. Wow, that kid sure knows how to get himself taken hostage.

But why Craster? This will sound weird, but the blood of his sons is 'pure' through all the incest. The Targs practiced incest to keep their bloodlines pure. Although Craster is doing it because he's an old prick, the result is the same: pure blood. I'm not sure what Craster's lineage is. But if it's either First Men or Stark, there must be something magical in the blood which enables the transformation to an Other. We do know that only FM (including Starks) have the ability to become skinchangers, so there is likely something in the blood. Hence the ritual and transformation.

I honestly don't know how important Coldhands is. I would have thought if he was important, they would not have cut out Sam's travels with him, because it would seem important that Sam knows him if he is actually important.
4908	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	But considering the possibility that Craster's lineage is that of a very ancient King, after the mutiny the Others must have a lot of King's Blood with which to magick.

If you consider after the most recent Novella that dragon taming was tied directly to Valyrian blood (Targaryens), it's not that much of a stretch to assume that whatever Ice magic that is would be tied to First Men blood (Starks). Kind of gives a whole new meaning to Winter is Coming.

Coldhands is a dead man, he is a wight of some sort, not a White Walker.

Â 
It's just that I don't think about it that often, but sometimes it sort of strikes me, that chosing to tell the whole story from POVs (especially for someone who likes to kill them of) is making some parts of the storytelling not very easy, actually.

Well then, you best stop watching, because the show is going to catch up with the books for several characters by the end of this season.
And I really don't understand how people didn't see this coming.  Martin has never been a terribly hard worker and he's prone to putting too much on his plate (both figuratively and at dinner), and yet he still signed off on an adaptation of a story knowing he still had over two books left to write.  This was a risk going in, and it became an inevitability at the start of this season when the showrunners basically confirmed the series would be either seven or eight seasons, and probably seven.
The show is going to pass the books unless Martin has secretly been much, much more productive than he's ever been known to be before.  If you can't accept that this show is going to start spoiling the books, you should remove it from your DVR queue and stop reading the internet for a few years.  Or just buckle up and enjoy the ride like the rest of us.

+ 1, I've seen a lot of people saying 'Well he might get TWoW out before they cover that part of the story'..well yeah he might, but that will only sustain the show for one season at the most. He would need the show to stop for another 3/4 years on top of that in order to get ADoS out and finish the story ahead of HBO.
Â 
Whether or not he gets TWoW out before HBO covers it; the show will overtake the books, no question.

We know that only men related to the Old Gods are skinchangers. They don't have to be FM.

4925	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	Is the assumption that TWoW will only be enough for one season based on the number of seasons D&D are aiming for or...? If GRRM has only provided them with a brief summary about the end, and no exclusive access to the manuscripts or something, it might be enough for two seasons or perhaps even more?

Â 
They're already into ADwD for some characters even at this stage. They'll be crossing into TWoW by next season for some characters at this rate and the book isn't even out yet.
Â 
Even if TWoW bought them two seasons at a stretch, it's still not enough, they'll definitely reach the end of the story before GRRM does. Assuming TWoW hits the shelves this time next year, it's going to be 4/5 years again before we see the last book and HBO aren't going to wait for him because it would mess up contracts, character ages etc.
Â 
There was some hope back 2 seasons ago that he could pull it off but anyone thinking that now is in denial.

I have so many theories now . first up are crasters sons exempt from the spell the blocks the whitewalkers from passing through the wall? Is gilly's baby now very significant considering its the only son of craster that hasn't been sacrificed ?

4929	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-28	I like that the Others were included in this episode. In the books they are pushed into the background for so long, so that Dragons and some Magic aside I almost forgot that ASOIAF is at its core a fantasy series. I absolutely love all of the Game of Thrones stuff that is going on in Westeros, but as far as I have understood it that part of the story grew during GRRM's writing, and the big conflict and ending twist has to do with the Others and the CotF. I can't say that I'm pissed that the showrunners decided to keep the Others around and give them some screentime, it feels more consistent this way.
Â 
The books are better than the show, and I'm pretty sure that the last two books will be superior too, but in the meantime until they are released, I'll continue to enjoy the show. This episode was very exciting, can't wait for next week. I love both the show and the books.

Â 
If the sole purpose of the showrunners regarding the Others was to show them so the audience doesn't forget about them, then there would have been better ways to do it. For example, they could have shown the Others harassing Mance's huge, slow moving, wildling horde, picking off the stragglers or the outriders. Maybe even do a cool fight scene where a group of wildlings, cut off from the rest, attempt a last stand against the Others (after all, they did deprive us of the Battle at the Fist).Â

Â 
Calm down, Sally. He's kinda right, y'know.
Â 
Bertrand Russell has spoken about this topic extensively, but I'll do my best to sum it up:
Â 
Most true 'atheists' are actually agnostic when described to express their views at length, but the go-to short answer is almost always 'atheist'. The reason for this is that the thinking 'atheist' (read: agnostic) can't in good faith (ba-dum-tshh) state with certainty that there are or aren't Gods. Put simply -- they don't know for sure (it's impossible to), thus won't state one way or another. What makes these agnostics atheist is the feeling that all references of God or Gods are deemed untrue until they can be proven true with absolute certainty.Â 
Â 
The vast majority of agnostics and atheists both would fall into this category. Of course, looking for guidance with this view ultimately leads one to nihilism, which is pretty much how I feel about ASoIAF. In the end, everything dies and it doesn't matter anymore

This might be a bit of a stretch, but is it possible someone(Bloodraven), was tapped into the baby, watching what was going on?
Also, the baby seemed a little to calm; considering the temperature is most likely in the subzero range.

4939	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-28	I was intrigued once they got to their 'land' since it was already further than we've been given insight into. That further revelation at the end was even more of a shock since it's not been revealed in the books yet, although hinted at.
Â 
It opens up so many more questions now. We know the Others don't simply kill all in their sight, so they may not be completely evil. Does this mean that Benjen Stark is an Other, for example? If the NK is a Stark, could it be that if he were to die at the end of the series, then Benjen survives as an Other and retains that Stark/Other connection? Really interesting how the show is giving insight into a book which hasn't been released.
Â 
Makes sense from a story POV too. They've been leaving the Others thread hanging too long so far I think, so keeping them relevant is wise from the point of view of the whole story.
4940	Summers1913	2014-04-28	I was just watching the last scene again looking for something else and I noticed that once the "rider" sets the baby down he gets out of there before the "king" comes in. Is there any talks that maybe these two (others and wights) are not working together? We don't actually see Others create wights anywhere. The wights at Castle Black rose after they were in the wall. So no Other would have been there to turn them. What do we have to say these two beings are on the same side?

Going by the episode commentary, I think they just wanted to show the baby as being disoriented. Besides, I don't think Bloodraven would need to tap into Craster's last child to know what the Others are doing with babies.

Â 
End of S2 we see a horde of them marching toward the Wall. If I hadn't read the series I'd be anticipating a big battle season 3 ...
Â 
Then we hear (but don't see) how they attacked the Night's Watch north of the Wall. Okay, that's something. Then Sam has a run-in with one of them ... then ... then ... season 3 passes by ... huh? Okay, they must still be marching south and yeah, are slow but still ... then ... season 4 starts ... almost half-way through now .. sacrificing a baby, okay, at least we know they're alive ... but ... Â where in God's green (and white) earth are they?Â 
Â 
Sad part is, that outside of more major book diversions they big fight the show-only viewers have been waiting for since S2 is still at least a full season away.

Very interesting. I think someone let the cat out of the bag a little too soon and had to shove it back in. This cracks me up and makes me think we just had a huge spoiler anvil dropped on us even bigger than the scene itself. They are trying to cover it up. "Oops you werent supposed to see that yet. *throws sheet on it*" hue. Someone probably got sacked over it too.
4946	Sam with Hooters	2014-04-28	I've got some crackpottery going that all "major mojo" magic on Planetos has to be done by a human (or near-human), and that the First Men were exactly that -- invaders or colonists, possibly from our own Earth.
Â 
Once humans arrived, they "grounded" magic, and the native magic-using sentient races immediately started recruiting humans to their "sides" -- obviously not wanting the humans to know how important they are, and taking credit themselves.
Â 
The humans' arrival could also be what threw the seasons so far out of whack.



The thing that I don't get is why the Night's King seems to be the overlord of the Others.

4954	titanx5	2014-04-28	Felt cold just looking at that ending scene. I just reread SOS part 1 pg460, when Sam and Gilly are advised by Craster's daughters to leave before her 'brothers' come. So I guess the ending scene now confirms that WW can transform babies into WW. However are they just Craster's babies the WW take or in any POVs especially when Jon is with the Wildlings do they mention that the WW steal children? cause that would be interesting. Cause is Craster's baby sacrificing the reason why the WW have increased in number? Was Ice Darth Maul really the Nights King?

We so far know that inside Melisandre burns a fire. Maybe she is the counterpart species to the Others. She uses a glamour to conceal something after all. And she has red eyes and red hair, so no albino. red and blue..fire and ice...
Out of Melisandre came two weird babies already, maybe she can bring some new kids, too.
Human+ Melisandre= Shadow/smoke baby
Other+Melisandre=???

Edit: My point is: We so far saw only male ice creatures and a possible female fire creature, Melisandre. Maybe that is the procreation link. Male = Ice, Female=Fire.

We don't know that the WW can't turn female humans into their kind. We don't know if they can reproduce as White Walkers(they probably can't, I think GRRM said they are 'a different sort of life form').

Are we supposed to believe that the White Walkers have rebuilt their entire ranks from some scumbag's castoff children, and that the NIghts King is now some form of White Walker hybrid rather than a human man?
Â 
What happened to GRRM claiming that the White Walkers are an actual separate race of beings that resemble ice elves? They can't be a race if they are simply humans that are modified byÂ some means. I mean, Micheal Jackson had far more modification than that baby and he was still considered human.Â And how exactly did the White Walkers even come to exist if the Nights King is required to create them, a man who didn't even exist until a few hundred years after the war with the White Walkers had been won?
Â 
And what the hell was up with all those women chanting about giving that boy up as a sacrifice? I certainly don't recall anything like that from the books, they seemed rightfully horrified that their children where being given as sacrifices. Hell, Gilly was so torn up by it that she was trying to talk the Nights Watch into taking the child away with them on a march to war just to keep it from being sacrificed.
Â 
The entire thing just seemed silly and in conflict with what GRRM himself has said about the White Walkers. Its as if the show writers took that oneÂ line about "Crasters Sons" spoken by some superstitious inbred and uneducated womanÂ trapped in a shackÂ on top of a mud holeÂ andÂ turned itÂ into the true history of the White Walkers.Â

Â 
What happened to GRRM claiming that the White Walkers are an actual separate race of beings that resemble ice elves? They can't be a race if they are simply humans that are modified byÂ some means. I mean, Micheal Jackson had far more modification than that baby and he was still considered human.Â And how exactly did the White Walkers even come to exist if the Nights King is required to create them, a man who didn't even exist until a few hundred years after the war with the White Walkers had been won?
Â 
And what the hell was up with all those women chanting about giving that boy up as a sacrifice? I certainly don't recall anything like that from the books, they seemed rightfully horrified that their children where being given as sacrifices. Hell, Gilly was so torn up by it that she was trying to talk the Nights Watch into taking the child away with them on a march to war just to keep it from being sacrificed.
Â 
The entire thing just seemed silly and in conflict with what GRRM himself has said about the White Walkers. Its as if the show writers took that oneÂ line about "Crasters Sons" spoken by some superstitious inbred and uneducated womanÂ trapped in a shackÂ on top of a mud holeÂ andÂ turned itÂ into the true history of the White Walkers.Â 


Â 
dude, relax, chill out.
Â 
The Night's King wasn't always an Other, he just may well have survived this long after he was turned. I'd like to believe, it was the female Other he fell in love with, that turned him. All of the Others arent craster's children, they're just easy pickings to turn into soldiers.
Â 
Others knew how to turn, id assume, forever. And I'll buy into Night's King's female that turned him. And I wanna think he asked for it.

4968	Daenor	2014-04-28	I have a question.How do we know that the Other appearing is NK?Has it been verified or is it an assumption?Also the scene is cool cause we finally see the Other on screen but it doesn't really explain(and therefore spoil) much of who they are,whence they came and why they are back.I mean they reappear after 8000 years so turning human babies in one of them doesn't prove anything.If that's how they "reproduce" than they should have been millions after all those years.And it's not mentioned anywhere that the Wildlings have been losing babies for as long as they remember themselves,so obviously the Others couldn't have been sustained through them.
4969	Moondancer	2014-04-28	Soo.. This was pretty tense. 
Is RAN around? I've just read his interview for Salon & he mentions possible spoilers from TWoW. Is the potential spoiler the one from this episode or should we expect more, gods be good? 
Also, Coldhands =/= Night's King... *please Benjen be still alive*
NK = The Great Other, perhaps? Have we met our foe? 
Why does everyone keep mentioning the number of Others around the King? Were LCs 1-12 also corrupted?
4970	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-28	Â 
Could be that they can, but they need warriors so they stick to males.
Â 
I reckon that a quick glance at Brienne might change their minds quite quickly.Â 
Â 
How does one say, "Damn! That's a big bitch!" in Others language?


*Sound of ice breaking in an indignant manner*Â 
:v
I actually had a really interesting thought. Like the Others apparently keep track of Crater's Keep and who's pregnant and who isnt.Â 
Gilly: "Its come for the baby!" So Shards there was obviously following Sam and Gilly last season cuz she managed to break out of there with Sam.Â 
But another Other was lurking around while the mutineers were shit disturbing. Why stick around if they knew Craster died?Â Cuz there was one last pregnancy. The Other posted there probably was figuring whether or not to bust in there if the girls didnt give up the kid. And might have been a little leery of doing that because there was a direwolf present. Since Bloodraven is obviously keeping tabs on the Others, the ravens start yelling when Rast is taunting Ghost.Â 
Â 
When Rast puts the baby out there, the Other comes and snatches it up and begins the long march back home with it. Just how far out is that? The Other had to have known that that was the last of Craster's boys and there wouldnt be any more. (likely kept some Other guys posted around the area cuz somethingÂ fishyÂ is going on with those ravens giving the game away. Plus to harass the NW.)Â 
Â 
In other words: The Others have an intelligence network and were keeping tabs on Craster's the whole time.Â

Tell us how you really feel.
4971	Greg B	2014-04-28	So am I the only one that thought that whole scene was ludicrous and completely made up?


Â 
No. In fact, it's one of those rare scenes (in book or film) for which my knee-jerk negative reaction only intensifies the more I think about it. For the record, I don't have a problem with departures from the books. In fact, in some cases, I think the show points to ways Martin could have kept a better handle on his story. But this whole bit was just bad.
4972	Ser Bran Stark	2014-04-28	The Other revelation was NOT a book spoiler...remember in the books we never saw a WW take the baby in ACOK, Gilly explained it to Jon Snow and that was it. TheÂ show used that scene and made it better by actually showing the Other taking the boy. That's all this was, in the books Craster's wives basically tell Sam that they are taking the sons and turning them into WWs. So instead of telling us they SHOWED us. It was a really cool scene and I liked it a lot. Now a lot of people are saying that this is an unwritten book spoiler and how many are going to come from this? I am holding on to hope that GRRM will never allow the show to ruin the books and never would piss off his loyal fan base. I think he is working on ADOS as well so that he can release it shortly after TWOW comes out so HBO can't get ahead of it but if HBO does catch up before the books then I pray they just write their own material. The only thing that made me angry from the episode was Jon Snow knowing that Bran was alive! this ruins the entire theme of the story! The fact that all the Starks are separated the entire story and Jon's personal dealings with the knowledge of his family's demise is so important...hated the change. Not to mention it changes the overall plot of story with the Bolton's and Stannis asking Jon to take WF.
4973	Kandora	2014-04-28	First time poster! Its crazy how far the show has deviated. Ive been reading a lot of these theories, and still know just as much as Jon Snow does. Nothing! 
Do you guys think CH will turn up and take Bran and co away before Jon gets there? Seems unlikely that they will meet and then Jon letting him go on. On the other hand, Jon already assumes he is out there. So i wouldnt be suprised.

Â 
Appologies if I went on a rant there, you have to understand that I am not normally one to rip the show for its changes from the book or to write towering walls of text bashing a particular scene or chapter. I have been very accepting of any number of changes from the books and still managed to enjoy the show very much, this one part though just really erked the shit out of me for some reason.
Â 
The whole thing just seems way to far fetched for me with the turning human babies into new members, didn't White Walkers exist before humans even came to Westeros? And as long as the White Walkers have existed surely the fact that they carry off human babies and turn them would be much more well known than it is, I can't believe Old Nan wouldn't have mentioned that in one of her stories if she knew about the giant spiders and dead horses.
Â 
Then also the fact that the Nights King who was basically a puppet brainwashed (or pussy whipped) by that White Walker Woman to aid their cause is now leading the White Walker army and apparently has the sole ability to create new Walkers. Then there is the secret White Walker recruiting center just a few miles North of Crasters keep that was awfully rediculous too, unless he marches that baby wrapped in a towel all the way back to the Land of Always Winter in a few hours time without it freezing to death. All taken together it was just too much.

Â 
What's more likely -- that D&D took some of the info they've learned from GRRM and showed us deeper into the Other world than the books have gone into so far (even if it comes with minor moderations) OR that for no specific reason they made a complete deviation that will in no way tie into the book's greater mythology and coming storylines?
4978	Envie	2014-04-28	Well I have to say - it's far more spectacular that this thread has reached 26 pages of awesome debagte about the supernatural of the Others rather than outrage over the rape of Cersei.Â

I think it's unlikely if not impossible that the Night's King = The Great Other. The Great Other is supposedly an ageless, eternal god that has warred since the dawn of creation against Rh'llor. The Night's King was a man who was changed/corrupted by (most likely) the influence of the Others. It doesn't make sense that they'd be the same thing. Unless you meant for the sake of the show they might make the Night's King the main malevolent force -- that's possible.
4981	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-28	Â

Well thats just plain fishy.
Seeing just exactly what happens to Craster's boys is a pretty big deal though. And this Other dude is...also kind of a big deal. Even without that leak, we'd be asking ourselves: "who is he? Is he lord of the Others? Can he just make other Others? wtf?"


yeah but i doubt that the person who wrote that is someone who is in the know of what happens in the future of the series tbh.Â 


Maybe, but the person who wrote the original synopsis had to have known that the show runners were calling that Other "Night's King". Otherwise, why post it?Â Its deletion makes more noise than expected. Like the cat got out of the bag and they have to shove it back in cuz Ooops.Â 

Â 
Well I have to say - it's far more spectacular that this thread has reached 26 pages of awesome debagte about the supernatural of the Others rather than outrage over the rape of Cersei.Â 

Kinda want the fandom to freaking move on from that now. It would be really nice, but then again, fandom isnt allowed nice things.

I unfortunately don't think Coldhands will be in the series, and they've already explained away his necessity by having Bran see through the tree and then declare "I know where we need to go." How exactly Bran and Co. will escape from the mutineers, I'm not 100% sure, but I think they'll make the rest of the journey North without Coldhands. That said, I really hope I'm wrong and he does appear.
4983	clawson24	2014-04-28	It's cracking me up that so many people have asked how the baby didn't freeze to death on the trip to the Land of Always Winter. HE IS BEING TRANSPORTED BY A MAGICAL ICE CREATURE for crying out loud. Suspend your disbelief.

Well, they were both botched scenes. Is that what you mean?
4985	Kaspiro	2014-04-28	Not sure if someone already mentioned this, but if not then here's some trivia: according to the Game of Thrones Wiki Richard Brakeson, the actor who played the Night's King, played Joe Chill (murderer of Batman's parents in Batman Begins).

Excited to see what other things the show will reveal later in the season that the books have not.

Â 
How come the magical ice creature didn't breastfeed the baby? Do Others' Mothers have udders? If it's always winter, how do they keep track of time?
Â 
I demand these things be explained by the shows creators immediately and thoroughly!
4990	Envie	2014-04-28	Â 
Well, they were both botched scenes. Is that what you mean?


Â 
I'm saying - if we're going to hotly (har har) debate a topic - I'd rather it be about something entirely supernatural and up to interpretation than some of the awfulness I read during the Cersei rape debate. Both are up to one's personal opinion whether or not they were botched (as is any scene in the show). Personally I loved the Other / Craster baby scene. Cersei / Jaime scene, not so much.
4991	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-28	Yeah, I'm probably also in the minority of the book readers who actually loved all the beyond the Wall stuff going on in this episode, the Others/baby forefront. For once I was on the edge of my seat watching the show. Usually I'm just enjoying (or not) the interpretation of what I already know.
Â 
Someone said the Others were supposed to be beautiful in a way, well, I'd say that baby looked gorgeous with those White Walker eyes. So maybe they are beautiful before they turn creepy and fugly?
Â 
I liked the scene, cause it showed us in a way the Others also kinda have a purpose, they're not just mindless beasts, there's something more going on there. That scene actually made me super excited for both the books and the show.

TGO may appear ageless if there was/is a constant succession of the corrupted - A Game of Other. 
Ironically, the visual medium begets lazy audience - and yes, I wouldn't be surprised if they toned down the lore for the sake of the narration that has both the elements of suspense and world building while being easy to grasp at the same time. 
Also, Ran said : TWOW SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS!  *book reader go cry in the corner*

It is pretty funny, I hope no one got fired over an innocent mistake though. If anything, I'm glad we got "spoiled" that the Night's King is still around (if that is indeed the case). Gives us something to talk about while GRRM goes on talk shows and signs autographs

I agree! I'm super excited now to see what's to come with both the books and the show. I long ago gave up my attachment to 'canon' in the show vs. books and enjoy both for different reasons. I too have always been disappointed in the way they depicted the Others as withered old corpse looking creatures. I guess this is one time I wished something 'sparkled' the way it was described in the books! (blatant horrible vampire teen romance novel reference there).

5003	talby88	2014-04-28	The Great Other exists just as much as Rhillor exists, meaning we have no clue.
Â 
I think George is too much of an agnostic to include gods in the story, especially considering it seems to be like our world where cultures just breed and create gods to explain situations in the world that they cant know(like magic).
Â 
Usually in stories with gods, there is one god tale that is true, theres no dispute, everyone seems to know about creation myths and all that. This story theres way too many gods for anyone to definitely be true. Kind of like our world heheh.

I don't think the gods will be relevant to the story, they are just there to add layers to the storyline. They're there to show the religious advancement of westeros over time, the CoF and the old gods mirror the pre roman British Druid worship of 'nature' deity' such as the gods of stream and forest, the faith of the seven mirrors the pagan gods worshiped during and after the Roman conquest of Britain and the coming of R'Hallor is very similar to the way in which Christianity came to be worshipped in Anglo Saxon Britain

5005	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-04-28	You FOOLS! You don't see it?
Â 
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
Â 
HE'S TRYING TO GET TO WINTERFELL, AND THAT STUPID WALL KEEPS BLOCKING THEM! TEAR IT DOWN!
Â 
Seriously, what lurks in the depths of Winterfell? The last piece of the puzzle, is what's down there.
Â 
The female Other, is down there. Locked, or buried. The Night's King is trying to get there 
Â 
Watch me be right, just watch. Seriously, watch that actually fucking happen. The Night's King's female Other is locked in the crypts of Winterfell, by some form of magick. He's been trying to get there forever.
Â 
Why are the walls in winterfell always so warm? Well, it could be a hotsprings theory, or whatever.
Â 
Or...
Â 
It's that female Other, absorbing all the cold, trying to empower herself to break the fuck out of those crypts and reunite with The Night's King.
Â 
Ice Dragon my ass. It's the FEMALE OTHER! BUY INTO IT! DO IT!


Â 
There could be some truth in that.. But instead of calling it the female Other, lets just call it the Night's Queen.
Â 
Don't know if you read Theon's chapters, but from what I gathered.. the crypts were slightly warmer then the outside - which was snowed in.
Â 
The thing with the "There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"-theory is that the Starks of Winterfell have always married into the other Northern houses, until Rickard Stark had his Southron Ambitions on.. So Roose may as well have some Stark blood in him as well unless stated that the Boltons (due to their image issues and pesterances) have never married into the Stark bloodline, or specifically a Stark has never married into the Bolton bloodline. And even then, I'm pretty sure that Barbrey Dustin or Hother Umber at least have some speck of Stark-blood.. But I could be wrong.. House Dustin features several of the classic Stark names, which could indicate a marriage at one point in time, and the Umber's had joined forces with the Stark's to fight off King beyond the Walls, which may have led to the Stark's marrying off a daughter in gratitude.
Â 
So even with Winterfell filled with Anti-Stark-loyalists: Bolton, Frey, Barbrey Dustin. And houses that are further not really native to the North: Manderly's and Greyjoy at the time, there could still be a drop of Stark-blood in Winterfell.
Â 
Though, it could be the reason why those Dusk Flowers bloom in Winterfell.. Joramun and a Stark joined forces to defeat the Night's King.. The horn was left beyond the wall, but the other source of power was left south of the wall? The Night's Queen? In Winterfell?
Â 
We've got to remember that the WW haven't been seen in thousands of years until recently.. What's changed?
Â 
Oh, and there's also the possibility that they want Craster's kid.. Night's King was a Lord Commander, Craster's dad was a member of the Night's Watch. Perhaps there's something there.. The women said that the WW would come to take Gilly's baby.. Does that mean they're going down as far as Hornhill? Nah, Gilly's baby can't possibly be the WW-endgame.. xD
Â 


'there must always be a stark in winterfell'
Â 
is it possible there was a deal between starks and the WW that while starks rule the North they will not cross the wall and hence they felt the need to pass it down generations and the meaning is lost. Now with Starks gone and the Crester's family starting to becoming a dominant part of WW they have decided to march on the wall and beyond


Â 
Why would they make a deal? The thing I'm thinking off is that the Stark's may be holding the Night's Queen "hostage", she may be immortal and locked in the crypts. If there's no Stark in Winterfell, then the hostage is up for grabs so to speak as nobody but the Starks know of this hostage... But I think that as speculated, even the Starks have forgotten the true meaning.. Same with "Winter is coming"..Whitewalkers are truly cold, from the Lands of Always Winter. Basically: "Winter is coming to Winterfell, because they want the Night's Queen" now that's seriously more ominous..

lol Ice Maul. Laufey Number Two over there is probably the only guy who can really use the magic to turn the babies. But im sure hes not the only one who can wight corpses. Its so interesting!Â 


Â 
Since he was apparently once the LC of the Night's Watch, and we now know that Craster's sons become Others, I'm wondering if they are even really their own "species" like the Children are. Perhaps the Others are all former humans, and the originals became that way through some sort of First-Men ice magic?
5009	baxter	2014-04-28	For the folks that are just thinking that white walkers are only coming from Craster's sons, come on. Â How is that possible? Â They've been around for ages.

Â 
I doubt it will turn out this way, but it would be a nice little twist if there are different sects of white walkers which would explain why they looked different in the pilot.

To be fair, people have theorized the Starks are descendants of the Night's King for ages. Technically the Knight's King thought to be killed was even a Stark. Then you have the whole "There must always be a Stark in Winterfell" and "Winter is Coming" stuff and it's not really that ridiculous.Â 
Â 
But yeah, the White Walkers are obviously some creatures created out of Ice magic that have existed for millennia but the most recent ones are Craster's sons since they seem to be attempting to build an army for whatever reason.

5012	baxter	2014-04-28	So am I the only one that thought that whole scene was ludicrous and completely made up? Are we supposed to believe that the White Walkers have rebuilt their entire ranks from some scumbag's castoff children, and that the NIghts King is now some form of White Walker hybrid rather than a human man?
Â 
What happened to GRRM claiming that the White Walkers are an actual separate race of beings that resemble ice elves? They can't be a race if they are simply humans that are modified byÂ some means. I mean, Micheal Jackson had far more modification than that baby and he was still considered human.Â And how exactly did the White Walkers even come to exist if the Nights King is required to create them, a man who didn't even exist until a few hundred years after the war with the White Walkers had been won?
Â 
And what the hell was up with all those women chanting about giving that boy up as a sacrifice? I certainly don't recall anything like that from the books, they seemed rightfully horrified that their children where being given as sacrifices. Hell, Gilly was so torn up by it that she was trying to talk the Nights Watch into taking the child away with them on a march to war just to keep it from being sacrificed.
Â 
The entire thing just seemed silly and in conflict with what GRRM himself has said about the White Walkers. Its as if the show writers took that oneÂ line about "Crasters Sons" spoken by some superstitious inbred and uneducated womanÂ trapped in a shackÂ on top of a mud holeÂ andÂ turned itÂ into the true history of the White Walkers.Â 


Â 
Â 
WHY DO PEOPLE THINK CRASTER WAS THE ONLY ONE TO DO THIS? Â Seems quite likely to me the White Walkers either take what they want in force, or the wildlings have given up children in the past as a sacrifice. Â 
Â 
Now that said, their use of wights suggest their number is potentially small - as they probably stay away from wildlings in bulk (though the beat the shit out of those in the pilot - which reminds me, didn't they turn the girl in the pilot?). Â Also note the wildlings are smart and burn every body they can as Ygritte demanded Jon to do at her execution. Â So perhaps the white walkers find isolated wildlings like Craster to grab babies while the clans protect themselves. Â  . Â
5013	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	Â 
Well, I don't know about turning babies into adults...but we know now that the Others, at least, can reproduce that way.
Â 
Now, the real question is...why turning some into Wights, and why turning those babies into Others? Maybe they can only turn guys into Others if they are alive, but when they died, they can only become Whights...


That's the impression I got. Hasn't GRRM specifically said The Others are not dead, or undead? So I believe a reanimated corpse is a wight, but if they turn a live baby it becomes an Other (or WW for the show)
5014	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	Â 
Of course it's not a wight. That would be a pointless scene, and also wouldn't even make sense since wights are made from corpses and not living babies.Â 

Exactly
5015	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-28	Â 
But yeah, the White Walkers are obviously some creatures created out of Ice magic that have existed for millennia but the most recent ones are Craster's sons since they seem to be attempting to build an army for whatever reason.


Â 
That's not really obvious - the first ones could have been First Men who were changed through some unknown form of ice magic, and they've been converting babies ever since. They may not be unique creatures, they may be a corrupted (or blessed, depending on your POV) form of human

5017	dtones520	2014-04-28	But if it's a spoiler from an unreleased book... That is pretty awful. I've spent years trying to guide non-book reading friends away from spoilers that will cheapen the reveal of the tv show. If the writers cheapen any reveal of the books by putting it in the show ahead of schedule, that is a slap in the face.

No it isn't because the author of the books signed away the rights to his unwritten books when he agreed to the show and he told David, Dan and Brian Cogman the end game for all of the characters. So I guess it's a slap in the face from George, but if you didn't think that you'd eventually get some book spoiler from the show you were clearly expecting the wrong thing.
5018	Jon-Michael Pearson	2014-04-28	Perhaps the reason we have not met Coldhands in the show is because Coldhands is the Night's King in the books? And if the Other we see in the last scene is the Nights King then he must be Coldhands as well?

Within reason? I think that George's current pace is way past being reasonable with him. He wrote/released his first 3 books in this series in 5 years, he has subsequently released 2 in 14 years and be isn't getting any older or healthier. I can appreciate a man wanting to cash in when he can, that is part of the American Dream, but he has done so on the backs of his loyal book readers and he really has done us all a disservice by not sitting his ass down and finishing his masterpiece. He can laugh it off in interviews, but he really should have waited until he had one book left before letting this go to TV.

It's not really how I pictured them either (mainly because of the rugged hairiness of most of them in the show), but I don't think the show did a bad job with their appearance. They are certainly striking and intimidating, just less beautiful and elegant than I would prefer
Â 
But the mysteriousness can't really be maintained in a tv show. There are scenes in the novels where POV characters directly face the Others and describe them - the show couldn't just keep them in shadow forever like in the pilot.Â

5033	Dormund of Ruddy Hall	2014-04-28	Here's a possibility:Â  the Great Other is the female Other who seduced the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.Â  This wasn't long after the Battle for the Dawn, and the Others had been driven back and were reduced in number.Â  So, perhaps she seduced the Night's King as a means of rebuilding the Others.Â  Perhaps the 13thÂ  LC (and possibly the 12 before him, including perhaps Brandon the Builder himself?) was nearing death, and made a deal with the Great Other in order to live forever as an Other.Â  Perhaps all the others are just humans or children who traded their soul for a twisted form of immortality.Â 
Â 
Perhaps the Last Hero is Brandon Stark (the Builder, that is) and his 12 companions were all considered LCs of the Night's Watch, posthumously or not, and so the 13th LC was the Last Hero himself?Â  That would kind of imply that the Last Hero is the Night's King.Â  Considering how (relatively) contemporaneously the Battle of the Dawn, the Last Hero, Brandon the Builder, 13 LCs of the Night's Watch, and the Night's King must have been to one another, it's not inconceivable that they were contemporaries of one another.Â  Perhaps the Last Hero and his 12 companions were the founders of the Night's Watch and were all considered LCs.Â  The 13 we see at the end of this episode were these people.Â  Perhaps Azor Ahai was indeed a different person than the Last Hero and his companions, including perhaps the Night's King, and it was he who defeated the others but these early leaders of the Night's Watch who oversaw the building of the wall, but they were corrupted in the end, and the Stark in Winterfell somehow drove the Night's King back beyond the wall, where they have slowly rebuilt the WW army.Â  And maybe some power in Winterfell really does hold the Great Other at bay or even, as was suggested above, as a prisoner.

And as a visual similarity they look like the House of the Undying Sorcerers.
Could it be that at the time of the great doom the 13 Quartheen then possibly were Dragon riders with their Sorcerer Stewards (were used to control dragons)
Managed to escape "The great doom" by travelling far north. Now with the help of those sorcerers have prolonged their lives.
Â 
Alternatively they traveled down south through Asshai and emerged up north as such they have seen the shadow lands and the heart of winter as well.

Well played. Wait the one who picked up the baby?
I don't think so, CH is a servant of Bloodraven IMO not a baby picker upper to the WW. Anyway I recall someone posting a video where John Bradley (Sam) says CH was cut so I doubt he's in the series.

Baby picker upper! LOL
I was shocked that the show took us to the LoAW and confirmed what is happening to Craster's boys before GRRM did. But it was a good shock, unlike the one from the previous episode...  Also, I appreciate the show as a separate entity and can deal with changes from books for the most part, but Bran & Co getting caught up with the mutineers is really bugging me for some reason, and not just because of the elimination of CH, which is in itself a bummer. 
Ghost in a cage was blasphemy. And the bear-baiting of Hodor was unconscionable. I won't stand for it.  I sincerely hope that injustice (along with drinking from Mormont's skull) is met with some hard core justice.

Here's a possibility:Â  the Great Other is the female Other who seduced the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.Â  ....


Â 
That's exactly what I was thinking.Â Â  Perhaps she allows no other females in her "hive" like a queen ant or queen bee.
Â 
Here is a link posted on another forum to a theory that explains all about the WW, NK, etc...Â  It is so well done, and even though many of the ideas in it were new to me, it makes the most sense to me of any I've seen so far.Â  Warning... the whole article is full of spoilers.Â  If you are allergic, then don't go there.
5038	Epyon	2014-04-29	Quoting myself from earlier today in the episode discussion thread, since this topic is specifically focused on the WW parts..
Â 


Warning, about to go off the rails to crackpot central station:
Â 
I'm starting to think that the "Great other" is really the "woman" White Walker that seduced the Night's King.
Â 
And along that line of thinking: She would have been the equal, but opposite companion/mate of the red religion's "Lord of Light", who represents fire and warmth.
Â 
Thus, "A Song of Ice and Fire" is -REALLY- about Her + Lord of Light, rather than necessarily about Dany + Jon (which is probably the popular theory thus far), and their respective forces war against one another. After all, two deities at each other's throats, particularly if they where former mates of some kind, is a much greater story than any small tale about mortals scurrying about for some Iron Chair.
Â 
Also, I found the castle + battlements pictured in the end of the show very interesting as well, in conjunction with this theory. If the "Queen of the -real- North" has indeed created fortifications in a land that perfectly represents her own nature, then it's possible the "Lord of Light" has also done the same in a similarly fire themed local... the prime possibility for this is, imo: Old Valaryia/The Doom of Valaryia, the only fire themed place on Planetos that people can't seem to go to. I'm now very curious if there are "Red Walkers" near it, or if the "Lord of Light" is also taking human "brides" as his "queens", much like the WW-Queen does with the Night's King.
Â 
Finally, I think there's a distinct possibility that the exclusion of Coldhands from the show, but -not- excluding Benjen early on, might be a hint that Benjen is NOT Coldhands, but possibly IS this New Night's King. The last one was allegedly a Stark too, afterall, and was killed... so him being alive there to Midas touch the baby seemed a bit... strange.
Â 
As I said, a whole lot of crackpot going on here, but interesting stuff to think about.


Â 
I also gotta say, I find it a bit interesting/curious that people are tripping out so much about the "Night's King" bit, but there seems to be very little with regards to the fact that the WW have a medieval styled castle + towers.... http://img3.wikia.no...alkerhorse3.png

Â 
Some say he was a Bolton," Old Nan would always end. "Some say a Magnar out of Skagos, some say Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot, from them who ruled Bear island before the ironmen came. He never was. He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down." She always pinched Bran on the nose then, he would never forget it. "He was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can say? Mayhaps his name was Brandon. Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room."
Â 
A Storm of Swords, Chapter 52
Â 
Starks = descendants of WW's seems pretty strong now. Maybe "Winter is Coming" in fact refers to their rebirth as Others? Or the return of their lineage over all of Westeros?
Â 


Â 
No it isn't.
Â 
Here is how Starks produce descendants. One day daddy Stark and Mommy Stark love each other very much and a new baby Stark appears
Â 
Here is how WW produce descendants. One day a WW takesÂ someone else's baby and uses magic to convert it.
Â 
We have no evidence that a WW/Human coupling produces humans, be it Kings in the North or any other variety. We only have legend that a WW/Human coupling resulted in a Night's King.
Â 
Any speculation that Bran the Builder is anything other than a human is nothing but speculation. Nothing in this episode givesÂ anyÂ support to it whatsoever. The episode itself didn't spoil anything. All it confirmed is what is already heavily suggested in the show: the babes are taken and turned into WW. The only spoiler was in the (since Â edited) text on the HBO site. Even then, it might be a spoiler or it might just be a mistake.

And now that the Other at the end is now confirmed to be the Night's King, I feel even stronger about it. I think Bran will be the one to defeat the Night's King and I think Old Nan's take is meant to be foreshadowing. That's just my thoughts, anyway.

5044	Sackofwetmice	2014-04-29	It's "the Night's King," not "Night's King."
Â 
Hits me like nails on a chalkboard every time I see it.
Â 
Just like how they have "The Dreadfort" listed as "Dreadfort" on the tv show map flyover intro...
Â 
And how it should be "the Khaleesi" unless you are directly addressing her in person.
5045	shyndy	2014-04-29	Was I the only one that felt while viewing the scene that the "icehenge" was a portal of one kind or another?Â  It seemed to me like the altar allowed for inter-dimensional or extraplanar interactivity.Â  One idea that I had that I don't really think is the actual case was that these 13 "others" (which are obviously different from the standard other we have seen) are actually beings that exist in another dimension but use the babies to create avatars of themselves within "planetos," which is why they look similar but different.
Â 
If it is actually a portal I think its more likely that the 13 are sealed inside this plane, either for protection or as a way of banishing them, although I like the idea of them actually beingÂ from another dimension.Â  I thought it was a pretty good idea until I saw that the synopsis actually labeled that guy the Night's King, although I suppose the Night's King could have somehow traveled to this other dimension at some point.
5046	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-29	I'm really starting to believe thisÂ http://www.reddit.co...others_and_the/Â and it's amazing it was posted shortly before "Oathkeeper" aired. Â Maybe "Oathkeeper" refers more to than just the Craster/WW pact but also refers to the pact between the First Men and the Others of long ago to separate themselves North and South of The Wall.
5047	ens362	2014-04-29	We learned that The Others really ARE supernatural otherworldly superhuman beings because they know how to make a baby actually stop crying.
Â 
Godlike Power.Â  

Haha...sign me up!!!
5048	Carolus Rex	2014-04-29	Would it be a long stretch to consider the black dressed Others, and the horned "Night's King" are the High Born Others (the "true" Others), and the Others they're creating are more like the front line knights, the White Walkers?
I'd doubt any living person would have traveled that far into the frozen north, so close to the Heart of Winter, to bring back any relevant tales of the masters behind the White Walkers. The only sporadic contact has been with the vanguard.
Â 
To me the WW we have seen thus far before this looks more human than the one with horns. Frozen, peeled back skin, hints of the glittering, frozen armor covering them, but still human beneath.
The demonic face of the one turning the baby gave me complete non-human vibes.
Â 
So, by being fed sacrifices by Craster, Stark or no Stark blood involved, they are able to grow their ranks and extend their reach southward, sending their knights ahead to freeze the world and raise wights for the ranks, and once the True Winter extends far enough they can leave their (only hinted in the background, but AWESOME! Nifelheim! ) keep in the Heart of Winter, head southÂ and whip up Stannis and his ilk.
Â 
Â 
I've no idea what to make of this scene, but I love it. More White Walkers! More Others! Winter IS Coming! 
Â
5049	drayrock	2014-04-29	Â 
Yes.
Â 
The Others are very stylish.
Â 
The spoilers never end.


nailed it
5050	DemiNymph	2014-04-29	Saw this passage posted on reddit I had forgottenÂ 
Â 
Â 
Â 
So pretty much just confirmation of something heavily implied in the books. I'm okay with it. Darth Maul White Walkers appearance i'm meh on....



Yes I've always assumed that they took the babies to "turn" them because of this quote. Not sure why people are so mind blown at this "revelation" scene. I see articles proclaiming that this is a spoiler from the books. Apparently they didn't read the books properly. The TV scene is more of a confirmation of what the books said than a new concept.
Â 
The only thing the TV show reveals is HOW the babies are turned into the Others, not that the babies are taken to turn into the Others. Apparently a touch on the cheek on a specific altar will do. The process to turn a baby is so easy that I find that underwhelming and a bit lame.Â 
Â 
Random thoughts - Isn't this rather unproductive that the Others reproduce like this? Is this the only way that they reproduce? Do they have sex, since there are female Others? Are the turned babies more special than a naturally birthed Other, assuming they do reproduce naturally? Do they have social classes among themselves, as in, the turned babies are more of a 2nd class citizen than a naturally birthed Other baby? Inquiring minds want to know.Â
5051	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-29	I hope CH shows up next episode and slaughters everyone at Craster's Keep, and takes Bran and company away to BR...and I hope CH=NK.

Oh I think it's all incredibly straight forward

CotF got into a genocidal death match with the First Men. The FM were facing defeat until some of Â their number happended upon the ice magic which defeated the CotF (who are in fact NOT the good guys). But the ice magic has some uninteded side effects. Much fun and hilarity ensues.

Well we know 100% that the Others are people.Â They aren't a race of ice elves or beings from another dimension. Which means despite having ice for blood they have very understandable and human motivations. Â Why was the Wall built? That's the really big reveal. Heck nobody knows, most of Westeros thinks it was built to keep out the Wildlings Â or something. The idea that it was built to stop another long winter is just another myth. I think Bran the Builder, epic magic user and all round Arthurian legend, was either in alliance with the CotF to contain a wild magic gotten way out of control, or he built it in alliance with the WWs to contain the CotF OR he was a WW himself and in those times the Others were seen by the FM for what they were, human beings who'd been transformed by magic. Look at the legend of the NK, his bride is NOT described as an Other, she's just a strange lady with pale skin and blue eyes. We shouldn't get too hung up on how the WWs are depicted in the TV show, which are monstrous demonic zombie like creatures, in the books they're far more human looking.

I thought of something along those lines too. If the story became inter-dimensional would we still be able to call it fantasy? The idea really intrigues me actually, I really like that that could be a possibility.
Â 
I am still clinging to the 13 thing, the thirteenth Lord Commander, the Thirteen years he ruled the Night Fort. Maybe all of the other twelve dark figures are different representations of himself, like the different representations of God in Catholicism.

5071	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-29	In the light of the latest revelations about the Others, I'd like to remind you that D&D said they put certain stream of scenes in the sequence of visions that Bran had when he touched a weirwood tree. D&D said they wanted to remind us of specific scenes that we've seen throughout the show. One of the scenes was the one from S01E01 when a little WW girl turns around and looks at a ranger. In the latest episode we saw how a human was turned into an Other. I think that the little girl was a child Other and a female child at that. So, either the Others have another village like Craster's where they have been breeding baby girls or somehow, girls can be created by them "naturally", but not boys or not enough boys.

5072	Hippocras	2014-04-29	The scene at Craster's, invented for the show, puts together a lot of complex things and makes sense IMO as a way to reduce the amount of time and sets and information the show needs to compress and still communicate.
In the books, Bran will probably learn about baby sacrifice and the reproduction of the Others on his own through visions. This scene made that unnecessary for the show.
In the books, Jon will slowly get the sense that Bran is helping him somehow as an invisible presence, through birds and trees etc. this scene is an opportunity to show it a bit more directly and reduce the number of helpful incidents that need to be shown to establish it.
In the books, the death of the mutineers was shown via Summer. Jon's emergence as a war leader was show by the First wildling attack at Castle Black. This sequence will make both unnecessary. The death of the mutineers is merged with the first attack of the wildlings at Castle Black to establish Jon's leadership ability and popularity, confirm the death of the mutineers, and show Bran as a helping presence in Jon's life.
Finally, if Bran's group is still with the mutineers when Jon's group arrives, Jon will meet Meera and Jojen. This might eliminate the need for other future scenes and events from WoW to be included in the show.
As for the baby conversion ceremony, I rather suspect that the show planners thought WoW would be out by now while storyboarding how the books would be compressed for the show, and this is probably something that will be clarified in that book.

5077	King Tam Stark	2014-04-29	Perhaps those Others were performing a test on the child. Maybe there's a particular child from Craster's line who is of interest to them. Maybe it's that little Craster baby at the wall?


Amazing maybe the others are waiting on some male other hero being re-born and Sam has unwittingly deprived them of him and saved mankind.
5078	gmavridis	2014-04-29	I don't remember many of the specifics from the book on the topic, but... was the number 13 significant in any of the Others stuff? There were 13 "people" in total, counting Darth Other (and not counting the guy who brought the kid).
Â 
I don't think there were just 13. I thought so at first but when I watched the scene carefully again I think that there were more to the left and to the right but theyÂ  are out of focus as the camera zooms in and the ice spikes hide them.
5079	Joseph Nobles	2014-04-29	I'm going to dig into this thread later, but I've a prediction I'd like to make.

We now know Gilly's son by Craster is related to the Night's King by blood, if not a potential candidate for the King himself. So if Melisandre ever recognizes this, she will try to have the sacrifice Jon Snow wanted to avoid by sending Mance's son away.

True, and it just occured to me that Benjen's horse has returned to Castle Black alive so this whole undead-and-his-undead-mount-thing just makes no sense.


Â 
Now that fuels even more the Benjen=Coldhands theory: since he has no horse anymore, he rides an elk. What is more, if the Great Other and the Night's King are different persons, there are too many loose ends to be resolved in the two books to come. Ditto with Benjen and Coldhands. The quickest way out of this writing predicament is for Bloodraven to be in league with the Others and having Coldhands go to The Land of Always Winter as we were already told to expect a look there in the books to come, all the while Bran becomes a tool of the Others' invasion.
Â 
If Benjen paid a visit to Bloodraven at his cave, maybe his horse couldn't fit in, so that is why he returned to the Wall and Benjen had to be supplied with an elk? Even more so if he then went on to visit The Land of Always Winter - what horse could endure such cold? An elk on the other hand...
Â 
The Aurora Borealis or whatever the strange light was at that scene, seems pretty consistent with Bran's vision in the books of a wall of light, or something of the sorts, doesn't it? Therefore, the suggestions that it was something made up by the show writers on their own account seem unlikely. What is more, GRRM already took a preventive measure by releasing the Mercy chapter to avoid having the show overrun him in that particular aspect of Arya's arc, so last episode might have been canon stuff, only GRRM couldn't really release the actual chapter where this takes place now, could he? 
Â 
Bear in mind that the change of HBO's synopsis is very telling, and the fact that "Night's King" was changed not to "a White Walker" (as the baby-fetcher was called from version 1.0 of the synopsis), but to "a Walker" which indicates difference from your generic White Walker as seen in episode 01x01... So they seem to have screwed up and in editing the text attempted to keep the differentiation, although on a subtler level.
Â 
As for the ponytail - I didn't notice it at all, but perhaps it was available to HBO as a spare prop from the True Detective season?
Â 
And for those who complain that the show spoiled the books for them - REALLY? You wait decades for a book and when a bit of inside information happens to cross your attention, you are unhappy about it? Nothing logical about that, except that some people will always need to find something to complain about. And there is absolutely no point in declaring that you will stop watching the show - while it is your right as this will only affect you and nobody else, in declaring it in such a pestering way, it only serves to annoy everybody else, since even if it would be followed through, nobody actually cares.

Wights are anybody, male or female, any age. Only requirement: dead


She was definitely not a wight. She gave a ranger a long look and watched him run. There was some frozen blood on her lips. I think what rangers interrupted in episode 1 was some WW ritual or maybe even feeding of the young. There was one adult Other, one child Other and many humans chopped into pieces. The girl's body was all white and didn't have any signs of decay. You can rewatch it here, if you want:

5085	gmavridis	2014-04-29	D&D had their whole sit down with Martin and know how the story plays out before they began the show, and now I imagine they can do with the show as they please. Based off the changes they've already made I assume their not running things past Martin for approval in any way. I do think their probably sticking to the general story of the books though so I tend to think some changes, like Talisa Stark dying and this whole Others reveal, will be relevant in the ASOIAF books.
The shot of them, whatever they are, standing in the distance gave me the feeling of some kind of leading council of sorts, brought back memories of the Qarth thirteen in a way.
Outside of that little comment these scenes obviously have HUGE implications for the series. Coldhands, I assume that was him, is pretty clearly closely allied with the Others, that has a significant impact on Bran's story and what's going to happen to him, does that mean bloodraven and all that are also in league with them, etc.
I don't know at this point I think I'm still processing it all. In my opinion though I think this would be to big of something to just be some D&D fanfic and what we just witnessed will have serious implications in Winds and ADoS.


I agree. Still processing the info, but I'm sure that GRRM's outcome and D&D's will be the same. Only they will get there by their own way. D&D through the limitations of TV episodes time and GRRM through his beautiful written words that create a whole universe with it's myths and history.
I, for one do not believe though that GRRM is going to make it in just seven books. I believe nine or ten will be needed with so many open arcs and ends to be knot.

She had exactly the same eyes as Othor, and not the same as the WW. She was bloody because she was killed. She was speared onto a tree and had internal wounds, which tends to make blood come out of the mouth. The only difference: she was a child.

5088	Hippocras	2014-04-29	Obviously, I'm not reading it that way. What's the difference between an Other and a White Walker in your book?

None.
White Walkers are Others. Wights are dead people walking around.
5089	Hippocras	2014-04-29	Benjen is not Coldhands.
5090	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-29	None.
White Walkers are Others. Wights are dead people walking around.


Exactly. That's why I didn't understand your post. You said:Â 
She had exactly the same eyes as Othor, and not the same as the WW.
Â 

I didn't understand what you meant by that. She was definitely the only one in the scene that wasn't chopped to peaces. She was pinned to a tree and her eyes were brown in the first scene. However, in the second scene her eyes were blue, but she did not look like a mindless zombie, nor were her movements clumsy. She moved like the Others move. It has to be a significant moment. D&D confirmed it this season in their recap of that episode. Also, if wights are just killing machines created by the Others, why would they turn a girl and not anyone else in that wildling village. And the Other that killed two rangers was acting like a protective mother. The colour of that girls eyes in the beginning bugs me. What if she being pinned to a tree has something to do with her eye colour? I can see your reasoning, but I think that scene was more than creation of a wight. Why would D&D single out that turn of girl's head, that stare? I do think it ties somehow with the baby scene we saw.

I didn't understand what you meant by that. She was definitely the only one in the scene that wasn't chopped to peaces. She was pinned to a tree and her eyes were brown in the first scene. However, in the second scene her eyes were blue, but she did not look like a mindless zombie, nor were her movements clumsy. She moved like the Others move. It has to be a significant moment. D&D confirmed it this season in their recap of that episode. Also, if wights are just killing machines created by the Others, why would they turn a girl and not anyone else in that wildling village. And the Other that killed two rangers was acting like a protective mother. The colour of that girls eyes in the beginning bugs me. What if she being pinned to a tree has something to do with her eye colour? I can see your reasoning, but I think that scene was more than creation of a wight. Why would D&D single out that turn of girl's head, that stare? I do think it ties somehow with the baby scene we saw.


The wilding girl got turned into a Wight. Simple. Blue Eyes and Pale Skin = Wight.
We don't know how the Others operate, we don't know how they turn the dead, or what sort of control they have over wights, or the "motivations" of a wight.
IIRC, the Night's King married a Wight to seal a pact between the FM and the Others. So there could be varying "levels" of Wightliness.

Othor was a former Watch brother who was turned into a wight, who Jon killed the second time with fire. The girl had HIS eyes, not WW eyes. She was a wight. I agree she was not chopped into pieces, but she was pinned to a tree, kind of like a marker. She looked very much like a zombie to me and not a bit like the WW we have seen.
And yes I am absolutely positive Benjen is NOT Coldhands and have said why over and over again on various threads. It is getting tiring to repeat it but:
Bran was traveling with Coldhands for months. Coldhands wore a big hood that covered his face, sure, but if he was Benjen, he would still have had Benjen's voice and mannerisms, as well as body type. He would have had traces of Benjen's smell. Summer would have picked up the scent. So in all those months, Bran, using Summer's nose, did not notice it was his uncle? Right.
Then there is Leaf. When Bran asked her who Coldhands was, she said he was someone who died long ago. Think about that. How long do the CotF live? A very long time.  So when they say "a long time ago" they mean it by their own sense of passing time, not human sped-up time. They don't mean someone who died last year.

Now you are speculating. There's no hint both in the books and the show that there can be 50 shades of wight. And I agree we don't know how Others operate, but I believe that scene was more than just a creation of a wight. Feel free to refute the arguments I presented.Â

Oh, ok. I thought it was a typo (lol). However, if you compare him to that girl, I'd say they are not the same, but â<U+0080>¦ we all read things differently.
Sorry, no one can read all the threads and we all have to repeat our arguments many times. I concur it's tiring, but ...
I'm not buying your arguments about voice and mannerisms. We simply don't know how body changes when someone is turned. Wights move like zombies, so no previous mannerisms are preserved. As for the voice, I simply cannot say anything conclusive. Smell is out of the question. Sam points out that Othor's and the other ranger's bodies have no smell what-so-ever although they were supposed to be dead for a long time. That's what makes Mormont take Sam seriously. A pro-Benjen argument would be the need to cover his face. Either it's disfigured or he wants to hide it. He certainly can feel no cold. So, I cannot say whether CH is or isn't BS. Someone who died long time ago can mean anything, really anything. Too vague for clear conclusions. I concur that from Leaf's perspective "long time ago" should be last century maybe, but he is talking to Bran, a boy, whose perception of time is completely different. So, no meat for clear conclusions there.
5098	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-29	What about the sheep that Craster offered to the gods when he had no babies?, is there an evil frozen sheep society waiting to take the mountains of the moon from the goats? and what would Shagga do?

Coldhands clothes were Watch clothes, so the clothes that had been with him since he died. Even if the body no longer had a smell, the clothes would still have enough of the human owner's smell left for Summer to pick up. Remember, Sam, in the scene you described was using his OWN nose.
Compare that to Arya's wolf dream where she smells her mother amid a large group of bodies floating down the river. Hyper sensitive direwolf nose exhibit one.

5101	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	Also, "they killed him long ago" is not the same as "he died a long time ago". It can mean the same, but it's not exactly the same. If fate, prophesy, etc play the part it would seem to play, a special person might be "killed" by some force or other, long before the death is actualized. This is the basic principle underlying some of the Faceless Men as well, even if they don't assassinate the marked person, their death was promised, and it will make no difference to the many-faced god.

Othor and the other guy were also wearing the NW cloths. I don't buy this smell argument at all. You cannot compare what happens in the Riverland climate with the frozen land beyond the wall. Smell is spread by air. Molecules are moving much faster in warmer climates. Hence, any smell is more enhanced the more south you go or as temperatures are rising. In freezing cold, smell is minimised, so a person who didn't bathe for months would hardly smell.Â
5104	Diehard_si	2014-04-29	Personally I loved it.
Â 
The book is entirely POV based, therefore we would have never seen this. The TV series is not.

This will become especially apparent in the next 2 series when a lot of the action happens 'off screen' in the books but the TV show will be able to show it.Â

Human sense of smell is not direwolf sense of smell. If humans can't smell something that is different from wolves smelling something. The example I gave shows the extreme sensitivity of Nymeria's nose as well as her ability to use it to detect a family member.
Coldhands was traveling for months with Summer.
When Sam said their was no smell, he was using his own pathetically weak human sense of smell, and was not smelling for traces of identity and humanity, but for the smell of rot. A totally different thing. If he had smelled Othor's clothes, he would still have smelled the smell of an unwashed man.
When I go outside in minus thirty weather, as long as I am active I still sweat. So there is still smell in my clothes when I go home. They are still dirty clothes, even when it is very cold. And they smell like me.

I don't have the book with me to write down the relevant quotes, but if you read the passage about the NK story in Bran's chapter from ASOS, you will notice one odd thing. The word "the" is never placed in front of Night's King, unlike The Nightfort, The Night's Watch, The Others. Yet most of you do use "the" when talking about NK, so does the wiki, and so did that damn HBO synopsis. So why is "the" not even once placed in the book in front of "Night's King"?

My theory is that NK is more than just a title, it's a twisted version of the Old Tongue name that the guy had.

Two good guesses for NK's name are Brandon Stark, as per Old Nan, or Jon Snow, as Ygritte calls it and evil name and NK was a brother of the king in the north so could have been a bastard.

I don't think wights or Others can sweat. And you brought up one good point. If there was any smell what-so-ever, it would be the smell of rot rather than any human lingering smell. Smells don't last forever. They evaporate. Summer had only one opportunity to smell Benjen and that was the Winterfell feast night. Even if she did smell him, do you honestly believe that that super duper direwolf would remember that one smell amongst thousands more overwhelming smells of people and food and drink and dogs and horses? I don't think so. Nymeria smelling Catelyn Stark is something else. She had a lot of time to remember her smell. Much more interesting is face covering. As I said, there can be only two reasons for it and one of them is that it was indeed Benjen who didn't want to be recognised. I repeat that that one argument is not enough to convince me that it is Benjen, but your arguments did not convince me that he isn't, so I at this stage I cannot reach any decision on the subject. Benjen just disappeared without a trace and I am sure he will have an important role to play or has already done so and we will learn all about his fate by the end of the ASOIAF series. It would make dramaturgical sense to bring him back as Colhands, because who would take better care of Bran than his own kin? Also, if we follow the logic of some of posters here (I'm not saying they are right), Stark blood is connected to the Others through the story of Night's King. Therefore, we could assume Craster is somehow related to Starks. Hence, Others in general would not be inclined to hurt a Stark, so Coldhands can be any Other really. So, lots of arguments pro and against BS=CH.Â

When he DID sweat. If he was once Benjen, his clothes would smell like Benjen, who Bran knows and who Summer would know by smell.
The smell does not simply evaporate off of clothes. If it did, we humans would not need to do laundry.
Anyway if you want to go on believing Benjen is Coldhands in spite of the evidence against, fine with me. Just try to avoid pretending it is fact and spreading it around like it is on threads for topics other than this pet theory. Bran traveling for months with Coldhands and not noticing it was his uncle? Not likely.

And my arguments DO stand. Fine to say they are not definitive, but they are perfectly valid.
1. Bran knows his uncle. Knowing someone means knowing their body, their voice, their walk, etc, not just their face. So it is incredibly improbable that in months of traveling together Bran would not notice it was his uncle.
2. Bran wargs a direwolf. Direwolves have heightened sense of smell and these particular ones, when being warged, can sniff out family members from a long way off and in spite of many many other strong smells around, as proven by Nymeria.
3. Benjen, if he is dead at all, has not been dead for very long. Which means a) his clothes would still smell like him. And b.) he would not be said by the CotF to be someone who was killed long ago.

Well I read them, and they simply did not disprove anything.
No human smell because it is cold? Not true. I showed why. 
Summer doesn't know Benjen's smell because there were lots of other smells? Nymeria smelled Cat in a river full of rotting corpses from at least several hundred meters of forest away. Lots of smells there, and the body was in a river.
No smell because the corpse is a wight? The clothes are human clothes from before he became a wight.
No smell because the scent is too old? That argument works better if it is NOT Benjen than if it is, because Benjen has not been dead long.

Benjen has been dead since book 1 if he is indeed dead. That would be around two years or more now.

The article which Hippocras did not want to read shows that the best trained dogs cannot detect any smell, which is 4 months old. If the super duper direwolf who had one chance in its life to smell Benjen amid thousands of other smells is so skilful, it may be able to detect that smell after a year, but Benjen has been gone since book 1. Accoring to ASOIAF timelineÂ https://docs.google....Fha1ZfNUE#gid=8
The Winterfell feast was on 20.5.298
Benjen went ranging 21.7.298
Bran spends a night in the Nightfort on 6.1.300
Â 
So, Summer can smell a lingering smell of a person it maybe smelled once amid thousands other smells more than a year and a half ago. Some badass direwolf Summer is. Lol.Â 
Nymeria smelling Catelyn Stark is a badass direwolf who can smell a person it smelled thousands of times and identifies with home. Yes, it is the same thing. Ridiculous.

Personally I would rather find out Benjen is alive and deserted because of something he heard while in the North, then went South to be the Stark in Winterfell when Bran and Rickon left, and now is murdering Freys there. Either that or he guided Rickon to Skagos.
5128	Needs More Salt	2014-04-29	What about the sheep that Craster offered to the gods when he had no babies?, is there an evil frozen sheep society waiting to take the mountains of the moon from the goats? and what would Shagga do?


Â 
What if they're into beastiality?
Â 
Are we sure Coldhands was riding the elk? Or was heÂ riding the elkÂ  Â
5129	Hippocras	2014-04-29	The article which Hippocras did not want to read shows that the best trained dogs cannot detect any smell, which is 4 months old. If the super duper direwolf who had one chance in its life to smell Benjen amid thousands of other smells is so skilful, it may be able to detect that smell after a year, but Benjen has been gone since book 1. Accoring to ASOIAF timelineÂ https://docs.google....Fha1ZfNUE#gid=8
The Winterfell feast was on 20.5.298
Benjen went ranging 21.7.298
Bran spends a night in the Nightfort on 6.1.300
Â 
So, Summer can smell a lingering smell of a person it maybe smelled once amid thousands other smells more than a year and a half ago. Some badass direwolf Summer is. Lol.Â 
Nymeria smelling Catelyn Stark is a badass direwolf who can smell a person it smelled thousands of times and identifies with home. Yes, it is the same thing. Ridiculous.
Â 
EDIT: typos
Frankly, if you want to go by realism, it would be ridiculous for Nymeria to detect Cat's smell even though it is very familiar as you point out, when she had been dead three days, was floating in a river, and the river was full of rotting corpses while the wolf was in a forest. I don't think realism is what matters for evaluating what a direwolf can and can't do.
Fact is, Benjen was family. Dogs can sniff out family. They know who belongs in the pack and who doesn't. Benjen's smell was of interest above other guests precisely because he was "pack". These wolves, in the stories are also deeply connected. Ghost's knowledge of Benjen is part of that connection, just as Ghost's distrust of Tyrion simply because he was a Lannister was also part of that connection.

5130	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-29	Personally I would rather find out Benjen is alive and deserted because of something he heard while in the North, then went South to be the Stark in Winterfell when Bran and Rickon left, and now is murdering Freys there. Either that or he guided Rickon to Skagos.


Well, there are many things I would like to happen, but let's stick to what the books suggest is happening. Benjen's fate is unknown. He may or may not be Coldhands, but he should resurface , because otherwise his only purpose in the books would be to escort Jon to the Wall and figure in some dreams and memories.
5131	Silver Prince	2014-04-29	The thing that I don't get is why the Night's King seems to be the overlord of the Others. The Night's King was a living man who turned into a White Walker several thousand years ago. He was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and guarded the Wall against the Others, who predated him for an untold, possibly very, very long period time. If he has managed to survive over eight millenniums, shouldn't that mean that the life expectancy for a White Walker is extremely long? Or that they are immortal unless violently killed A  laÂ Tolkein's Elar? So shouldn't there be some White Walkers with seniority over the Night's King? They've been invading Westeros as far as history dates so why would they suddenly unite under this guy? For what purpose?


Â 
Â 
It could be because most of the senior White Walkers died during the Battle of Dawn. The Night's King is the first WW story after the Long Night, so that might set why he is so important...
5132	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-29	Dogs can sniff out family. They know who belongs in the pack and who doesn't.Â 


Benjen is not the family direwolfs know. That's what imho is your basic error. There is no mystical family smell. Direwolfs identify as family smells of their brothers and sisters and their human alter egos and, since they don't have a mother, they identify Catelyn's smell as family. And Ned's as well. That's where family ends. Some kin smelled almost two years ago amid thousands of smells is not a family. If you argue that direwolf can somehow smell Stark blood, that's not an external smell. That would be like dragons being nice to people with Targ blood. Even if Summer could smell Benjen's bloodline, do you think it can convey that recognition to Bran and how. Too far fetched.Â

5133	jet199	2014-04-29	Back to Night's King's name.
Â 
Yeah, the no "the" thing is weird. I guess I just mentally added the "the"s when I read it.
Â 
The Night's King is pretty similar to Night's Watch (but that does get a "the"). It could be that there was a higher up person, or thing, called Night, or something similar which has been corrupted, that controlled/started both the king and the watch. Maybe it was the blue eyed girl who was called "Night". There is Nightfort that could have been named for similar reasons as well.
Â 
I need someone who is better than grammar than me to give a hint at what the lack of "the" may indicate. I don't think it is grammatically wrong for Night's King to mean king in/of the night but it is unusual and doesn't flow (like the prince that was promised rather than the prince who was promised).
Â 
I think maybe we assume he is the king of the long night so we give him a "the" but maybe he is actually king of the night in general. Night's King sounds like he basically takes over when the sun goes down every night, not just in the past. Old Nan does seem to hint that he is still around so maybe we haven't been spoiled after all and it is all in the books.Â 
Â 
"Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King was only a man by light of day, Old Nan would always say, but the night was his to rule. And itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s getting dark."

Why? I mean the wolves suddenly all started hating Tyrion just because the could telepathically sense the growing Lannister-Stark tension via each other. We are talking about a fantasy series here, not regular dogs. These wolves specifically have a Stark connection.
5139	Hippocras	2014-04-29	Why do people seem to think the king had horns?
What I saw was more like an icicle crown.
5140	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	Can't real dogs sense threats and the like? Tension has a chemical/hormonal (well, similar) element so they could have smelt rather than felt that.
However, I'm inclined to say that as all te Starks whose PoVs we have and whose wolves lived long enough can Warg and otherwise share thoughts with their wolves, they probably can sense things mentally

Maybe the wolves starting to hate Tyrion had something to do with his blood, but whether that is Lannister blood, it remains to be seen. Telepathically? Really? Where is any evidence of the dire wolfish ability? As I said, maybe I would consider your argument if you said Summer could smell or sense Stark blood. That's quite different from your argument that Summer can smell Benjen's specific personal smell, which is impossible for the reasons I stated. You haven't answered my question, so I will repeat it. If Summer is indeed sensitive to Stark blood, how will it convey that emotion to Bran? Summer has not been attacking Coldhands. It has not been hostile towards him. If she can indeed smell it's a Stark, that's consistent with the direwolf's behaviour. However, Summer cannot just say to Bran - Hey, see, it's your uncle ,it's a Stark. Â

5144	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	There's something about those bloodlines at the developmental core of it all, whether it's less or more important than what is discussed here. GRRM's ideation of Starks and wolves, Lannisters and Lions, Targaryens and Dragons predate even the physical dragons. (GRRM wasn't sure whether to include them other than as symbols.) That said, The Wall predates everything else.

I believe "the" is used for things already mentioned and known and the absence of "the" would indicate naming of some sort. An example is comparing "the dog ran to the castle swiftly" vs"Dog ran to the castle swiftly, the second sentence "dog" is being used as an actual name and in the first one dog is something everyone already knows but is not a name.
5146	HannibalStark	2014-04-29	I don't remember many of the specifics from the book on the topic, but... was the number 13 significant in any of the Others stuff? There were 13 "people" in total, counting Darth Other (and not counting the guy who brought the kid).


It is known that 13 is unlucky to the Dothraki (we are told when Dany is offered 13 ships to leave Mereen with)
5147	HannibalStark	2014-04-29	Where do you guys see HBO calling that guy the Night's King? Im looking all over the Viewer's Guide and i cant find it at all.

Â 
Nope, all from Bran.
Â 
As the sun began to set the shadows of the towers lengthened and the wind blew harder,
sending gusts of dry dead leaves rattling through the yards. The gathering gloom put
Bran in mind of another of Old Nanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stories, the tale of Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King. He had been the
thirteenth man to lead the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. â<U+0080><U+009C>And
that was the fault in him,â<U+0080><U+009D> she would add, â<U+0080><U+009C>for all men must know fear.â<U+0080><U+009D> A woman was
his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and
eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her,
though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.
He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king,
and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years
they had ruled, Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and
Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when
it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King had been
destroyed, his very name forbidden.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Some say he was a Bolton,â<U+0080><U+009D> Old Nan would always end. â<U+0080><U+009C>Some say a Magnar out of
Skagos, some say Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a
Woodfoot, from them who ruled Bear island before the ironmen came. He never was. He
was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down.â<U+0080><U+009D> She always pinched Bran
on the nose then, he would never forget it. â<U+0080><U+009C>He was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can
say? Mayhaps his name was Brandon. Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very
room.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
No, Bran thought, but he walked in this castle, where weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll sleep tonight. He did not like
that notion very much at all. Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King was only a man by light of day, Old Nan would
always say, but the night was his to rule. And itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s getting dark.
5151	Clariana	2014-04-29	Night's King Name (since I don't feel like starting a new thread, again)
I don't have the book with me to write down the relevant quotes, but if you read the passage about the NK story in Bran's chapter from ASOS, you will notice one odd thing. The word "the" is never placed in front of Night's King, unlike The Nightfort, The Night's Watch, The Others. Yet most of you do use "the" when talking about NK, so does the wiki, and so did that damn HBO synopsis. So why is "the" not even once placed in the book in front of "Night's King"?
Â 
My theory is that NK is more than just a title, it's a twisted version of the Old Tongue name that the guy had.


Â 
Interesting observation. To me it suggests it is a status or a rank that various entities can hold...

Good catch. The WW was caring for the child no doubt at all. What would be the temp in the LoAW? Minus 100 plus? The little baby would have been dead in seconds.

Why babies? Is it only brothers of the NW who've purified themselves by taking their vows...........and newborn male children unsullied by sin who can become WWs? The Others are not what we've thought they were.

That's fine. "It was magic." Cocoon of Icy Love. No problem. I mean, it must have been something like that since the baby did not actually freeze to death. But I still get to laugh when someone says "cold preserves" or "ice preserves" as if it explains anything. Granted, I realize it's a time-honored tradition on the boards to take a phrase out of context and extrapolate it into someÂ profound and mystical insight into the nature of theÂ worldÂ or its metaphysics, but ask yourself what the cow must think of "ice preserves" the next time you pull some ground beef out of the freezer.
5159	Silver Prince	2014-04-29	Remember when Melisandre did some lecture to Shireen about the 2 gods?
''Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two. A god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war.''
I wonder. Could this be the show's foreshadowing of what we saw in ''Oathbreaker''? I know the Great Other is a deity of sorts or just a general concept of the Others, but it kinda makes sense that the show is starting to set up the main enemy of mankind.
Also, the chant of Craster's wives. ''A gift for the gods!''
It kinda makes nice contrast, Melisandre lecturing/converting a little kid (and carressing her on the cheeck i think), while the Night's King converts a baby to a WW by touching its cheeck.
I really start to believe what Mel said to Shireen is a direct reference of the show to the Night's King and it was explicit foreshadowing.
The show seems to be getting into the main theme of Ice and Fire. What do you believe?

Â This isn't really true, unless you're writing surrealism. Supernatural phenomena in aSoIaF have reasons, even if they aren't revealed to the reader right away.

Â This isn't really true, unless you're writing surrealism. Supernatural phenomena in aSoIaF have reasons, even if they aren't revealed to the reader right away. It's not a world of randomness and chaos. GRRM is good at it. It's called world building. "The baby didn't die becauseÂ blue ice zombie" isn't good world building.Â 


Â 
Supernatural phenomona = fantasy world.Â 
Â 
You can go on and on about this topic ad nauseum and pick about the details all you'd like, but whenever you're dealing with the supernatural and events out of the scope of reality then you're talking fantasy. At its core, the fantasy world (comprised of supernatural phenomena) never makes sense. That's the entire point. Therefore taking a single scene and overfastidiously analyzing it within the scope of reality is an ignorant Sisyphean task without any hope of an outcome; in other words: baseless conjecture.Â 
Â 
I love arguing about hypotheticals as much as the next person, but I'm at least well aware as to never take it seriously and to make sure that you're anchored on solid ground at all times.Â
5167	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-29	This season 2 bonus video is sort of interesting in light of HBO's slip-up; apparently the Free Folk think they killed the Night's King:
Â 
http://www.youtube.c...h?v=0KHzcsLjgog
Â 
Do we have any idea how the Night's King managed to bring the woman he met through the Wall?


Â 
He was Lord Commander. He walked up to the gate at the Night Fort and told them to open it to let him in.
5168	jet199	2014-04-29	Â 
So maybe Old Nan just said a name, but Bran misunderstood her and heard "Night's King" when it was actually something else. Have we ever heard the story about him in another POV?


Sam mentions Night's King to Jon as well.
Â 

	Spoiler 
Â Those old histories are full of kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights riding around a thousand years before there were knights. You know the tales, Brandon the Builder, Symeon Star-Eyes, Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s King â<U+0080>¦ we say that youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re the nine hundred and ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, but the oldest list Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve found shows six hundred seventy-four commanders, which suggests that it was written during â<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Long ago,â<U+0080><U+009D> Jon broke in. â<U+0080><U+009C>What about the Others?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Sam is giving examples. Symeon Star-Eyes is probably an example of a knight that was riding around thousands of years before there were knights so Night's King could be a king who reigned for hundreds of years.
5169	Recentiy03	2014-04-29	Â 
Same as the two corpses that were brought in AGOT. I think the Others can cross the Wall, but not on their own. They need help.


Â 
Good point.
Â 
Anyway, I believe somewhere in this thread someone mentioned the idea that until proven otherwise, most of Old Nan's stories are likely true. However, given that the Night's King appears to be very much not dead (well, maybe very much undead, or Otherly?) I don't think it's fair to suddenly say "well, I guess all the old stories are true"--perhaps parts of them are true, other parts are metaphorical, and seemingly some are just flat-out wrong like the idea that the Free Folk and the Starks "killed" the Night's King (defeated maybe?).

The 'Not everything' is what you seem to be having trouble with, because that 'Not everything' bit could very well encompass this 'ice preserves' mantra that's floating about.Â
5173	Ingelheim	2014-04-29	I can't remember this from books but for how long has Craster been sacrificing his sons to the Others?


Â 
I think it's not clearly stated, but it seems like decades...he has some old daughters, so he should have some old sons...

Yep. Even if he do some simple maths and consider the older women are now 40, that means he was making sons for about 25 years at least.
5175	Vermelho	2014-04-29	I think we are getting ahead of ourselves here a little bit.
Â 
The only solid thing the scene reveals us is that baby's are turned into white walkers. Now that is heavily implied in the book's, so not that much of a spoiler. Plus in the "behind the scenes" they say its based on suggestion present in the book, probably they just extrapolated from what we already had.
Â 
It does show 13 others who are different from the portrait of normal WW. But i was thinking here to myself, its very possible that the show never showed us a WW, that the creatures that we have seen are just the usual reanimated zombies, therefore there is nothing special with those WW, they are just revamped design.
Â 
Lastly the Nights king, wasn't confirmed....they took the reference out of the guide as fast as they could, a trainee just screw things up probably.Â

We've seen wights before, like the one that Jon kills. Those aren't the same as White Walkers, who are seen riding horses and showing intelligent signs of life. I think most readers knew there had to be some sort of organization to them, but seeing that creepy council of 13 was pretty cool, and revealing. There's always the chance that they totally made that up, but I doubt it.

5181	Recentiy03	2014-04-29	The thing that I don't get is why the Night's King seems to be the overlord of the Others. The Night's King was a living man who turned into a White Walker several thousand years ago. He was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and guarded the Wall against the Others, who predated him for an untold, possibly very, very long period time. If he has managed to survive over eight millenniums, shouldn't that mean that the life expectancy for a White Walker is extremely long? Or that they are immortal unless violently killed A  laÂ Tolkein's Elar? So shouldn't there be some White Walkers with seniority over the Night's King? They've been invading Westeros as far as history dates so why would they suddenly unite under this guy? For what purpose?


Â 
Perhaps the "woman" with cold blue eyes from the forest is the Queen of the Others and thus the Night's King became de facto leader when they married.Â
5182	Needs More Salt	2014-04-29	Â

Â 
Unless I'm mistaken, those encircled around those pillars were all wearing black. We also haven't seen what the other Others look like from up close, so it could be possible that he was just one Other from a council of them. It could be that he's just one of whom can perform the ritual, or it could be that he has to be the one to do it.Â 
Â 
We still know very little about them, despite the 'rushed' HBO introduction.Â

5184	Lady Winter Rose	2014-04-29	I know I don't sound very intelligent, but I can't help but notice the baby was very adorable. I feel more sorry over his fate even though I shouldn't, but I can't help but say... how cuuute baby!
Â 
Â 
Â 
I think casting agent did a great job, by finding such captivating child. It will definitely help audience empathize with baby.
Â 
Â 
Â 
EDIT: I think baby was turned into WW and that this was indeed Night King. Benjen was nowhere to found.

5186	JonGriff	2014-04-29	Is it possible that the WW that turns the baby into a WW is not actually the Night King or the "leader" of the other but just some sort of high priest that is in charge of performing these rituals?

Where do you guys suppose the walker army we saw in the final episode of season 1 is at right now?

No, they do look more like horns, but still could exist to indicate some sort of regal figure. We haven't seen any other WW with "horns" yet, so who knows.
Â 
Also, interesting that he's definitely wearing black armor...my first viewing I thought the 13 guys were wearing like, black acolyte robes or something. Definitely makes him seem ex-NW.
5192	Wolf in Hallowed Places	2014-04-29	I logged in to post about this relatively mild spoiler (confirming something that was hinted at), and was exposed to this massive spoiler about the Night's King...thanks a lot internet! What is this HBO 'episode guide'? I never would have known about this spoiler if I hadn't read this thread.
The show Others aren't how I imagined, or how GRRM described the Others, but they still had a good look to them. This head Other fella looks kinda derp though...'Darth Maul' indeed.
Â 
The question this raised for me, is, at what point am I going to stop watching? I had expected there to be an obvious cut-off point, ie. series 5 = aDwD. But evidently things aren't panning out that way, as the plot is becoming both more condensed and more divergent. I think I'll stick with this season until the end, but won't watch the next one.
Â

We learned that The Others really ARE supernatural otherworldly superhuman beings because they know how to make a baby actually stop crying.

We don't know for sure about most of this, but I'm assuming the WW that collect babies are like rangers or scouts. There's probably a bunch that hang out south of LoAW. Not sure the whereabouts of the army of WW we saw...maybe headed to Eastwatch?

And that guy looked kinda different to me, though WW all seem to resemble each other. Seeing as the one Sam killed basically exploded, I think we have to assume this is a new one.

In think they just turn up at random as sometimes Craster doesn't have a son to give them so gives them a sheep. Lately they have been coming more frequently. This probably means in the past babies may have been a bit older when they were taken so it is not necessary to be a new born to be otherized.

I am of a similar opinion too.
5199	baxter	2014-04-29	I am of a similar opinion too.


I think it has to do with magic returning and prophecy. Â Craster sacrificing those babies didn't make the red star appear, ya know?

Â 
Mance tells Jon in the book how the Others are always there, always in the shadow etc. Though the show has made the Others look more grounded into the material world, I think the power of the Others has extended over the entire land north of the Wall, and they are constantly on the prowl, moving like ghosts, rarely seen by human eyes, unless they want to be seen. That is why, I think, the wildlings insist on burning the dead as soon as possible.

					
					
							Edited by Corvinus, 29 April 2014 - 01:06 PM.
5201	ReyneMaker	2014-04-29	The symbolism of the 13 figures seems relevant. We were definitely intended to count the number of figures in that shot, and the entire ritualistic nature of the scene is clearly important. People have surmised that they could represent the Night's King as the 13 LC and his 12 predecessors, and this would imply some greater connection between the Others and the traditions of the Night's Watch.Â 
Â 
I can't help but connect this to Jon's last chapter in ADWD and think that his rebirth will bring him into an existence similar to an Other. As a Stark he possess the blood of the First Men which I can't help but think is what Darth Walker and the Others are seeking in Craster's sons. But as a Targaryen he is also a descendant of Old Valyria and possesses the blood of the dragon which could mean that he will become something that is between ice and fire.Â 
Â 
Also Dany's house of the undying prophecy with the blue rose growing out of a crack into the wall could also suggest that Jon won't be resurrected by Melisandre but could actually be reborn out of the wall when the horn of winter is blown.
Â 
My secret hope is that the wall is destroyed and Jon comes exploding out on the back of an ice dragon. Dare to dream.
5202	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-29	Land Of Always Winter was exactly as I expected it to be, frozen and inhospitable. There is a reason it is uncharted and why WW feel safe there. It is simply too cold, dark and windy for anything, plant or animals, to grow there.
Â 
Makes me wonder though, how did a newly born baby wrapped in some rag tag clothing survive a long journey to the heart of winter???!!
5203	Recentiy03	2014-04-29	The title of the the series is song of fire and Ice,
Â 
Â it is going to come down to Dragons verse the thing we saw SundayÂ  night


Â 
There are layers to the title, but that's certainly possible; GoT features Others in the prologue and dragons in the last chapter, so there's nice symmetry...

Â 
I'd actually say that they look more like a crown in that picture, as you can clearly see them encircle the head. They also look more translucent, like ice, than his skin where in the post production shot on screen made them seem more an extension of his "flesh".
Â 
Also midly interesting, that shot with him standing there next to normal people, and with a "normal" expression on his face, Â also makes him look far less menacing and quite easy to be envisioned as a potential "good" (or at least not evil) character.
Â 
I don't know if that is THE Night's King or even A Night's King, but it's interesting.
5205	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-29	Impressed with the landscape. It is a mountainous area with rocks covered by snow. Hugely disappointed by the look and feel of the WW leadership. I was disappointed with WW looks when they were revealed in season 2 last episode.

WW and their leadership look like some pale colored, pasty complexion men in halloween costumes. Not the silent, subtle, beautiful ice warriors we had come to hope.

Â 
It's inferred -- and unless I'm mistaken, it was also directly stated -- that the Others were never far away. They were always at at their heels and every morning some had been taken. I think it was Mance?
5208	Blazfemur	2014-04-29	Do you guys think, that they keep a council of 13? Or do you think, only 13 of them, were in that scene?
Â 
Obviously there is an army of wights, but Others, I mean.
5209	Recentiy03	2014-04-29	In the light of the latest revelations about the Others, I'd like to remind you that D&D said they put certain stream of scenes in the sequence of visions that Bran had when he touched a weirwood tree. D&D said they wanted to remind us of specific scenes that we've seen throughout the show. One of the scenes was the one from S01E01 when a little WW girl turns around and looks at a ranger. In the latest episode we saw how a human was turned into an Other. I think that the little girl was a child Other and a female child at that. So, either the Others have another village like Craster's where they have been breeding baby girls or somehow, girls can be created by them "naturally", but not boys or not enough boys.


Â 
Yup, it seems Bran sees the Land of Always Winter in his vision, which may be setting up some sort of Night's King v. Bran/Blood Raven conflict.Â

The last time we saw the Others, it was Sam that saw them, but it might have just been one?. I believe they were also present in the first book. Keep in mind that Craster has had sacrificed a lot of boys, so there must be at least that many Others.Â 
Â 
The girl in the first season was not an Other, but just a dead child who was turned.

Â 
ok so she was a wight.
Â 
I'm wondering if they (The Others, specifically, the Night's King), stop at 13, and just keep the 13. similar to the qartheen 13
5213	Gneisenau	2014-04-29	Craster couldn't have had that many children (in the context of % of a population), so does that mean the WW have a low population ?

They may want to, keep a low population. Of Others I mean, wights clearly they have a horde. Others are probably in control, like Lords/generals.

Â 
Judging by what went on in that last episode, all of Craster's male children who were sacrificed wound up being Others. So there's very likely a whole lot more than 13. The 13 encircled around those pillars were probably some sort of council
Â 
There seems to be some confusion here.
Â 
***White Walkers in the show = Others in the books***
Â 
*Only Craster's male kids were sacrificed, and as per last week's episode, the infant boys were turned into Others.
Â 
*Others have attacked Mance's camp repeatedly
Â 
*Others were in the Battle of the Fist of the First Men -- at least according to the show. The book only made references to wights, iirc. The Wiki says that there were Others.Â 
Â 
*An Other attacked Sam and Gilly in the series (in the book it's Paul as a wight)
Â 
*In the book an Other kills Paul and is then killed by Sam
Â 
So there's probably a whole lot more than just those 13 + the ranger. The 13 at the pillars are likely some sort of Others council.

I'm of the mind that not all WW were once Craster's babies. They probably have other means of reproduction, but this is one of them, and they're willing not to harm Craster and his wives in exchange.

a hierarchy of sorts, im loving this more and more.
Â 
Though, think of the age progression. They were older, and they just turned a baby. if they were craster's do they age expeditely? all of them but the Night's King?

Agreed, but because most of them are ugly it doesn't mean that all are.Â  I would assume that the woman that the Knights King fell in loove with drowned and was perfectly preserved.Â

Â 
i would assume, it has to do with aging and prolonged deterioration. im sure they start as beautiful as they were in life, but as their body rots and decays, they get more fragile-looking. the magick is still there though. think of it, they cant be immortal, if babies are allowed to "grow up." there has to be a limit, and maybe thats why they need constant reassurance of their population from craster's scenario.
5223	Bear Claw	2014-04-29	Maybe there is more than one faction of the Others. Also, whenÂ  Bran was in his coma he saw Jon - sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing cold and pale as all memory of warmth left him. Kind of looked like what happened to the baby on the show.
5224	grufolo	2014-04-29	My guess would be there are 100 WW,as many as there are Crasters sons,and they have kings blood as they have actually Targaryen blood. There are hints that Craster may be son to Maester Aemon... True blood of kings that, inbred for a long time, same inbred as Craster... Funny way to inbreed for both the keepers of the light (dragons) and darkness (WW). So the circle would close. 
May be wrong but this set the record on a wholly different note.
We finally had a glimpse of theICE while so far we only had fire insights.

I don't think it's mentioned anywhere that the Others steal babies from the wildlings. The only thing we've ever seen them do is kill them and make artwork in the snow with horses bodies and stuff.
Â 
The Others came for Gilly's baby because he was a 'sacrifice' due to them per the agreement Craster made (whether that's official or just an unspoken agreement we don't know). Gilly broke the deal and ran off with Sam so yeah - they were after her.Â 
Â 
I think if the Others could just steal babies from wildlings they would have easily bolstered their ranks in the hundreds or thousands by now. It seems to be the only way they can do the 'stransformation' we saw is when the baby has been 'given' to them as a willing sacrifice. So maybe it's like the old custom where vampires can't come into your home unless invited. Weird old customs based around magical wards or laws.

Â 
Well.Â 
Â 
We just had that answered for us. And the answer is still not a straight one. Theres still enough mystery surrounding the Others/White Walkers that we are left guessing. But still...Craster's babies.
Â 
My dad made a pretty cool observation:
These Other-People are pretty much all brothers. Think about it. Could they even have their own Night's Watch? Are these the lords of the Others? Was that the Heart of Winter we just saw?Â

Thanks for this reminder. It would be a really amazing plot twist to have Craster be a bastard child of Aemon. Wasn't he also a member of the Night's Watch though? How did the baby also grow up in the Night's Watch - a Mole's Town accident who grew up and joined the watch too?
Â 
Edit: woah Â ...huge lightbulb just went on. If a "King's Blood" is required for sacrifices of magic to work (as we've already seen before) then that would explain why Craster's sons were so important to sacrifice to the Others!! Â Mind. Blown.Â

Well he says one happens as a boy, once as a man, and once as an old man. So the last two are pretty obvious, which would be being next in line to the throne and then KL sack.

5249	Needs More Salt	2014-04-29	None of that makes Craster related to Aemon or any Stark for that matter. He could be a child of some NW deserter or ranger who bedded a Wildling woman. Claiming Craster is at all related to anyone important by blood is a big stretch with no proof whatsoever. Back then the Night's Watch was comprised of more than just Aemon and Brynden Rivers...
Â 
As to Craster's offerings and that there's no mention of Wildings having their infant boys stolen, it does seem to point that there is something special about his 'sacrifice.' This does make me wonder if Gilly's baby at The Wall will be of importance in the near future. Will the Others be coming for what's rightfully theirs?

â<U+0080><U+009C>Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I 
had grown old. By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first. My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation. What could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brotherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s poor grandson, and his son, and even the little children...â<U+0080><U+009D> Jon, AGOT

Well, I do not think maester Aemon refers to his first vow as the NW oath, because as a boy he was in the Citadel, so whatever test he had to overcome, it is linked with these vows, not the NW. He became maester when he was 19, so he wasn't a boy any longer.

Â 
Sure - it could be another crackpot theory. But no worse than half the others I've heard. This one actually has some really amazing implications as to why Craster's sons were so important for the sacrifices if he did in fact have blood of kings in him from Targaryens.

You are just piling assumption on assumption.  Who ever said Craster's father is a character we know, let alone one that was still alive at the start of the series?  It could be any random crow from decades and decades ago.  The last episode is really bringing out the crackpots.  At least use some common sense.

Â 
One when he was a boy (unknown), one when he was a man (presumably when the great council offered the throne), and the last he explains was the sack of KL.
Â 
By the way, people are only talking about this because the possibility of the blood of the child being important is actually a reasonable assumption. Since only Craster's babies seem to be taken, that could very well be true, or it could just be a sacrifice/ritual thing. Or even a convenience thing, but that I doubt very much. If you don't think blood is important in aSoIaF, then why did GRRM make it very obvious in TPatQ that Valyrian blood is required for dragon taming? That being said it's almost certainly NOT Aemon, but the presumption that blood is important is not a silly one.

^^This. When he was in manhood was when he was given the opportunity to take the throne but declined. He took the Night's Watch vows in order to allay his own concerns that he'd be used against his own brother in a fight for the throne. This would leave him as a boy, which was when he went to the Citadel to train as a Maester.Â

That's not certain, although it's implied but definitely not obvious. While the Silver Denys was probably Velaryon or Targaryen, Nettles' parentage was questionable and that's actually stated in the book. Unlike the other dragonseeds, Nettles actually trained Sheepstealer rather than instantly bonded with it.

Agreed, I even seem to recall people in the south who don't take them seriously say it (Robert? Cersei?).  Although I suppose Others can "take" any age in one form or another, perhaps it originated in reference to taking babies or children (not sure the age cut off for Other-ing a child).

Sure - it could be another crackpot theory. But no worse than half the others I've heard. This one actually has some really amazing implications as to why Craster's sons were so important for the sacrifices if he did in fact have blood of kings in him from Targaryens.


Ehh i think its less crackpot if Craster has another great House blood line in him. Like Stark. I doubt it but it makes the whole thing less crackpot.
5264	Metopheles	2014-04-29	Why is it every Rhaegar is alive and is Mance thread gets the default "Not another secret targ" answer, but here it goes : Craster.. might be.
How can you even consider him to be a Targaryen :'D

Â 
an old bloodline, that has the blood of the first men in it. doesnt even have to be stark. karstark would be awesome, or who's that woman that theon took in the crypts at winterfell?
Â 
but NOT targaryen. craster is not a targ. tyrion isnt a targ. jon ill buy based on what we're given. ill even take varys as a blackfyre even though it's a stretch.
Â 
but definitely not craster.

I don't buy why Craster has to have any sort of royal bloodline in him anyway. Simply offering the infants may be enough. In fact, that's all we know for sure. Craster's sacrifices (offerings) are what has kept the Others from killing and turning him and his wives. Â

5280	Iralius	2014-04-29	The crackpot Craster theory does have some weight in it because there needs to be reasons why the WW/Others only, apparently, took from Craster - and there seems to be two possible explanations:
Â 
1) Craster's deal with them - maybe the WW/Others are as bound by this as anything else and could only take children freely given. This one seems to make the most sense.
Â 
2) Craster has the blood of kings in him. This takes more assumption than the first, but it has been a theme of some importance throughout. The most readily available blood in the North is Stark blood, and from a sort of poetic pov this could be a nice dichotomy between Starks/Targaryens. Out of all the houses, the Starks and Targs have the closest ties with their banner animals, and more than that are strongly tied to two elements that are opposed throughout the story: ice and fire. The idea that Targaryen blood is needed to control dragons to some degree, maybe Stark blood - as steeped as it is in the Blood of First Men and winter - is required for a WW to be made.
Â 
Either way, the first one takes less explanation and makes the most sense with what knowledge we have now. The second one takes more explanation, but at the same time presents far cooler possibilities than the first.
5281	IceFire125	2014-04-29	Maybe it's all about the heavy cost of blood and sacrifice..
Â 
Ice - Night's King needs royal blood sacrifice to continue to manifest his power (from the Great Other)
Fire - Red priests/priestess, like Mel, need royal blood sacrifice to continue to manifest her power (from R'hllor)
Â 
The eternal conflict between light and darkness will hang in the balance with Jon, who in him, flows blood of Ice and Fire.
Â 
Will it ultimately take his sacrifice of royal blood to both extreme forces... to finally have peace? for Dream of Spring to become possible for the realm of men, once again?

There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
Â 
HE'S TRYING TO GET TO WINTERFELL, AND THAT STUPID WALL KEEPS BLOCKING THEM! TEAR IT DOWN!
Â 
Seriously, what lurks in the depths of Winterfell? The last piece of the puzzle, is what's down there.
Â 
n00bs.
Â 
Â 
The female Other, is down there. Locked, or buried. The Night's King is trying to get there 
Â 
Watch me be right, just watch. Seriously, watch that actually fucking happen. The Night's King's female Other is locked in the crypts of Winterfell, by some form of magick. He's been trying to get there forever.
Â 
Why are the walls in winterfell always so warm? Well, it could be a hotsprings theory, or whatever.
Â 
Or...
Â 
It's that female Other, absorbing all the cold, trying to empower herself to break the fuck out of those crypts and reunite with The Night's King.
Â 
Â 
Ice Dragon my ass. It's the FEMALE OTHER! BUY INTO IT! DO IT!


Just to humor you, why would the Long Night have even happened if the whole purpose of invading Westeros was to retrieve the female Other? Assuming you're talking about the woman that the Night's King brought back to the Nightfort. He found her north of the Wall thirteen generations after the Wall was constructed. And the Long Night was the entire reason the Wall was constructed in the first place.
Â 
Nah, they're after something else.Â

Lol Craster does not posses the blood of kings. He simply gave his newborns away as a peace offering. It's entirely possible that a handful of other people north of the Wall do this as well but most wildings are either too superstitious and fearful or lack Craster's cunning and cruelty. Also, Craster happens to be the biggest donor because he has a lot of sex with a lot of women and doesn't want any sons. A community of women run by a single man is not really all that common. The reason the Others only take male babes is anyone's guess though.

5283	Hippocras	2014-04-30	My theory on why  Craster's babies:
Remember when someone said there was something "cold" about Craster? Something's probably up with his ancestry. It might, possibly, be relevant that his father was from the Night's Watch.
But, I think the far more important factor in why the Others want his babies is his MOTHER. Why do readers so often just gloss over the mothers as if they don't make up half of someone's DNA anyway?
His mother was from Whitetree. Likely she was a Woods Witch. Whitetree seems to have practiced human sacrifice - children's bones found in the mouth of the huge evil weirwood there.
She is the one who gave him his "cold" blood, though it might be also important that the father was a Watch member who broke his vows.

Â 
But perhaps the point is to show that they are not such bad guys after all. Every character is supposed to be grey. That's why we get POV for every character, except the Boltons for now.
5288	Eberc	2014-04-30	With the confirmation that Craster's sons are indeed turned into white walkers, the title of episode 10 'The Children' has me slightly more excited.
We know the titles reflect various themes spread across the episodes focus characters. Might we actually get the CoTF and more white walkers in one episode?
5289	Waylin Stark	2014-04-30	I'm convinced Darth Other was the Night's King. How he became an Other, I have no idea.

5292	Crow'sEye	2014-04-30	The whole Craster's sons thing has me really wondering .... what happens to them once they are Others? Obviously they aren't a 'baby' anymore - so do they 'grow up' somehow instantly? All of those figures behind the head honcho were full grown man sized beings. Craster's sons would be of all different ages over the years from babies to young adults. Not that it really matters, but the magic of the Great Other must age them up somehow too.
Â 
I really appreciated someone from Reddit quoted the book. It's not really that much of a spoiler now - because we're reminded that the women in Craster's keep KNEW about the sons and the brothers coming for the babies and they knew they were the Others too. The only spoiler is WHO is the horned Other "Night's King" and what is his significance? It really actually only creates more questions then it does spoilery answers!


Maybe it's taken the WWs 8,000 years to amass enough of them to march South?

5294	briantw	2014-04-30	If Craster were to have some sort of royal blood in him, I would think Bloodraven would be a more likely candidate than Aemon, as Bloodraven would seem much more likely to have 1) been north of the Wall for some reason and 2) potentially broken his vows with a woman.
5295	Bomboasy	2014-04-30	I have not seeing this being discussed at all anywhere. Â There is writing (letters or symbols)Â on the ice table that is used to place the baby on for the Night King to transform. Â  At first it seemed part of the ice, however it is shown twice in an angle that is too bizarre to be irrelevant, from under the table itself. Is this an indication of magic? Â Can this transformation happen only in this spot? Â To me this is an indication that GRRM is on board with this revelation, because it seems to be a very specific detail.
Â 
Now read the HBO original description and consider the writing on the table. Remember that the God of Light uses fire to purify. Is this the opposite?
"A White Walker claims the baby and rides to a city of ice," the original synopsis read. "The child is presented at an altar, where the Night's King greets the infant and lays a finger on its cheek. The baby's eyes turn White Walker blue.â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
Â 
I agree with the fact that the mother (and possibly the whole Whitetree) may be even more important than Craster's father. I still think that Martin will probably use an existing character as Craster's father if he's half as important as i think he may be.
Whitetree is descibed well and in detail (see the wiki of ice and fire) as a sinister place, i seem to remember also mention of bad things happening to babies (cannot remember the exact reference). If this is correct, the whole giving babies to the "Gods" (as Craster calls the WW) may be something he was taught by his mother, as he was raised by her and not the NW.
Â 
So my theory is now that Whitetree was a crucial recruitment point for the WW, and this is how the habit was transferred to Craster.
Â 
Also, after Gilly gave birth to the 100th son of Craster, one of the other older wives says that if Sam won't take the baby "his brothers" (as the baby's brothers, not Sam's) will....
5297	Envie	2014-04-30	Maybe it's taken the WWs 8,000 years to amass enough of them to march South?


Â 
If the only way the Others can reproduce is through sacrificed babies then yeah, it would take a loooong time to get enough of them. That's why I don't think there's very many of them and why they raise the dead (as Wights) for their army instead.

Yea, I'm getting that vibe as well. There might be other Wildling villages that practice this same ritual, but thus far GRRM has pointed only towards Craster's male children being offered to the Others. Therefore it wouldn't at all surprise me if they were to march on The Wall to get him back.Â

Not for the baby alone maybe. Your comments make it even more compelling: why would only Craster's children become WW, if he was not special at all?

Â 
Just because Craster is the only one who's resorted to such actions doesn't make his blood special. The Wildlings hold their children dear just as any other cultures in Westeros. Craster may just have been twisted enough to try it or make that bargain as it not only gets rid of males which would inevitably compete with him, but also had the benefit of keeping the Others at bay.Â 
Â 
All we know is that what Craster is doing is special, not necessarily that Craster himself -- and subsequently his parentage -- is of any importance.Â

I believe in the world of Ice and Fire inbreeding gives people supernatural abilities, and it's the inbreeding that's the key. A little inbreeding gets you dragon control and tons of it gets you to be a WW. This is why Tommen will be one of the heads of the dragon!

5315	Needs More Salt	2014-04-30	Remember that the Night's Watch, or at least some within the Watch, knew of what Craster was doing yet still used his little village as a safe haven. To them the promise of safety, shelter, and a meal was more important than putting an end to it. I doubt they knew he was giving the children to the Others, but they at least knew that something happened to them.Â 
Â 
Those scenes at Craster's reveal a lot more about the Night's Watch than one would think. For example, it solidifies that the Watch was primarily concerned with Wildling raid parties.Â
5316	Envie	2014-04-30	Remember that the Night's Watch, or at least some within the Watch, knew of what Craster was doing yet still used his little village as a safe haven. To them the promise of safety, shelter, and a meal was more important than putting an end to it. I doubt they knew he was giving the children to the Others, but they at least knew that something happened to them.Â

Â 
Yeah, I remember this from the books and even earlier in the show when Jon calls Mormont out on it if I recall correctly. They knew what Craster was doing all this time - for a very long time in fact since Craster was in his 50s or 60s at least and some of his wives look pretty old too - gods knows how many sons he's put out for sacrifice by now.
Â 
The underlying disturbing implication of this knowledge is that the Night's Watch has known about the Others for a long time and as their numbers have dwindled, done nothing about it. Whether that was because they had almost zero power or political pull in King's Landing or because they figured no one would believe them without surefire proof, I don't know. For whatever reason, they've kept it a secret all this time and continued to use Craster as an outpost.Â 
Â 
Jon wasn't cool with that and at least now, going forward, it's no longer a secret. Sadly the 'proof' that was sent to King's Landing didn't even make it - am I remembering that right?
5317	JesterX	2014-04-30	I wish the show had stuck with GRRM's description of the whitewalkers/others as strikingly beautiful.Â  That would've been different and kinda cool for a monstrous villain.Â  Instead, the show just morphed them into the standard ugly things that's typical of all Hollywood monsters.
5318	RoamingRonin	2014-04-30	So... the Others are just the "Blue Priests" of the Great Other. Is that the way of it it? I wouldn't be surprised if they had to kiss the baby to make it turn.Â

I think you may have jumped a bit too far. The Watch knew that Craster was sacrificing his male offspring, but they didn't know about the Others. All the Watch knew was that the children summarily disappeared into the forests, but whatever happened after that was complete speculation. Remember, too, that Mormont was as stunned as much as everyone else when the wight rose and tried to kill him. Likewise, rangers were sent out to retrieve information about other lost rangers who had never returned. When they were attacked at the Fist of the First Men, no one really knew what was attacking them nor how to deal with them. At the Fist, they set up a defensive position to stop the Wildlings, not an army of undead and their icy commanders.Â 
Â 
The Watch may have known about the Others and how to defeat them long ago, but that information has been long lost up until they resurfaced and Ghost found the stash of crude obsidian weapons.Â
5324	robert_was_the_true_steel	2014-04-30	I had the impression that unlike the Free Folk and other Wildlings who keep the faith of the Old Gods and view the Others as an enemy, Craster had turned to worshipping and sacrificing to the Others in return for protection for himself and his daughter/wives.
Â 
It always bums me out when people try to lump the Children, the Old Gods, Bloodraven, and Cold Hands etc. in together with the Others. I really think they're opposed to each other. There isn't even anything icy about the Old Gods and the Children, it's much more earthy.
Â 
Also, has anyone considered the possibility that they're using the name Night's King for a chief Other but that the character won't be the same as the Night's King we know from Old Nan's story in the books?
5325	Needs More Salt	2014-04-30	^^ I'm inclinded to believe both, actually. I don't think that was the Night's King and nor do I think that Bloodraven and Bran are cohorting with the Others.Â 
Â 
Did people forget that wights tried to attack and kill Bran as he made his way into the cave?

The text shows that ONLY babies can be turned into full WW.Â  And maybe only Craster babies, at that.Â  There's nothing from the text that suggests a full grown man can become a WW.Â  And don't say the Night's King.Â  Even in ASOIAF, that's only a legend.Â  Neither the show or the books have revealed or even suggested any FEMALE WW's.

My point was that thus far, ONLY Craster babies have been converted.Â  Which leaves open the question that Craster babies are the only ones that CAN be converted.Â  The same with non-babies.Â  So far ONLY babies have been converted.Â  Which leaves open the question that babies are the only ones that CAN be converted.

Craster has also thus far been the only one to give his children to the Others (that we know of, at least. It's quite plausible that there are other Wildling villages that have the same custom). That doesn't make Craster himself important, but only his decision to do so.Â

Oh we definitely know full grown men can be turned into Others. The Night's King was a full grown man and now he's a white dude with shiny blue eyes. It's also very likely that his 12 comapanions wearing black were also at one point full grown men and sworn brothers to boot. Jon destiny is to become a WW, he was made Lord Commander of the NW, and then 'killed' for precisely that. I'd be disapointed at anything else.

Â 
Well, it makes him semi-important. If he's lived there his entire life he's probably given quite a hefty amount of baby boys to the White Walkers.Â 
Â 
But as for importance beyond that? It's only speculation and theory - speculation that he might have old, 'unique', blood in him (either from his mother or father) or theory that you have to give your children freely to the White Walkers for this to occur.

Also true, but TV is not even cinema...and the show involves so much suspension of disbelief already. So I think it is a relatively minor thing. Especially if you consider that the books (and thus the show) may end up showing the WW to be not actually as evil as the Westerosi and us currently believe.
Personally I would rather reverse the pattern by showing ugly and broken things/people that are good, than the other way around.
I mean, James Bond movies always have a femme fatale evil beauty so that wouldn't be such a big deal.

Â 
Maybe so - but when Jon confronts Mormont about it - he doesn't deny they knew about the Others (based on the reports of the deserter from the very start too) - and he's not the only 'incident' nor are Craster's sons the only incident. I think it's always been implied that the Nights Watch knows there's 'something' out there weird happening but they either refuse to admit it or are keeping it on the down low purposely. No one talks about it - they avoid the issue altogether in favor of attacking the wildlings instead - who are not the main threat until it's too late and they're being herded / driven to the wall anyways.

I doubt they're "good". I mean, if we want to go with negative recognition, everyone that was pink and fleshy this kid dealt with passed him off or put him on frozen ground.Â

The person that was white and desiccated is (apparently) warm and gentle.

Â 
Mormont and the others within the Watch were convinced it was the Wildlings that were the cause of the missing rangers. The encampment at the Fist of the First Men was to deter and stop the Wildlings and not the Others and their wights.Â 
Â 
I agree with you that the Watch knew there was something out there, but not what that something is -- or was, for that matter. The Watch was blindsided by the Others but were wholly expecting Wildlings.Â 
Â 
Think about the seasoned ranger from the prologue in the first book. He certainly didn't expect wights yet he was one of the Watch's most experienced members. Secondly, would the Watch set up camp to fend off Wildlings if they knew that there's an army of undead nipping at the heels of the living? Doubtful.Â 
Â 
I asked this question earlier in the thread, but I'll ask again given that the implications would be important:
Â 
Does anyone know of any other instances of sacrificing newborns to Others? If there are others that do it, suddenly Craster's significance is greatly diminished.Â 
Â 
We've seen this so far --
Â 
- In the show, the Other attacked Gilly and Sam and tried to 'take the baby' (take back the baby?).
Â 
- Craster is the only known person to sacrifice his infants (all males) to the Others (that we know of).Â 
Â 
- The Others have repeatedly attacked Mance's Wildlings yet have left Craster alone.
Â 
- The women at Craster's knew of what was going on, but only some of the Night's Watch knew that Craster sacrificed his newborn male offspring. (It isn't stated that the Watch knew of the Others and the Wights until after they showed up and started slaughtering rangers).
Â 
... and a whole lot more I've not noted that's been brought up in this thread already. Bear in mind that Craster's significance is thus far limited to his sacrifices, and anything outside of that is pure speculation.Â 
Â 
I'm really hoping that next week when Jon gets to Craster's that one of the women spills the beans.Â

Â 
Â 
All very good points worth remembering. While I do think the Watch had a suspicion it wasn't just wildlings out there causing problems, you're right that they didn't know exactly what an "Other" was except for old tales and histories most have forgotten (and Sam discovers much of in that musty old library).Â 
Â 
I still think they were purposely turning a blind eye for years about Craster's 'sacrifices' because they didn't want to know. Perhaps the reasoning was, if they don't know, then accepting hospitality (if you could call it that) when they stayed over at Craster's wasn't wrong.
Â 
Either way, it was a terrible mistake. Mormont should have found out long ago what was really going on. I think he belatedly realizes that when the wights reanimate of course. But by then it's too late.
Â 
Also, one of the women spilling the beans about the Others at this point won't matter... they can't possibly know anymore than we've already seen. In fact, we the audience have now gotten a glimpse at what the Others are / do moreso than the anyone north of the wall. I think that's why a lot of people considered it very spoilery... since we didn't know that much from the books even though yes the wives at Craster's all said they were the brothers and they'd come for the baby ... we didn't know what they looked like or what they did to the babies. Now we do and even THEY still don't really know ... they know only that the brothers come for the babies.
5346	Needs More Salt	2014-04-30	Didn't Mormont say that whatever the Wildlings customs were, it wasn't the Watch's concern? or something to that effect? I definitely agree with you that the reason the Watch didn't ask was because it wasn't their right to judge and nor did they want to know.Â 
Â 
I still think the women know a bit more, hence the ritual chant when the child was brought in. We didn't see that in the book, so there's potential there for some more spoilers.
Â 
Jon knew that these history lessons were crucial if the Watch was to find a way to stop them, and that's why he tasked Sam to read the books and then go off to train as a Maester.Â

5347	El Pinko Grande	2014-04-30	Does anyone have Craster's quotes from the book about his relationship with the "gods" handy? FWIW, I didn't get the impression from the way he talked about the Others that he felt that his sacrifices were in any way unique. It seemed like "getting right with the gods" was something anyone could do, in his view.
5348	Kitakaze	2014-04-30	They're cutting Coldhands?! I don't want to believe it! He's one of my favorite mysteries in the books. I hope that it's only this season and not the whole show.


Â 
Â 


And I think Coldhands is cut from the show for good. And the Walker who took the child far North was not Coldhands. No way. He was a plain Walker henchman.


Â 
Unfortunately, I think it's safe to say the Coldhands is the GoT series what Tom Bombadil was to Peter Jackson's LotR series. A fan favourite, speculated about endlessly, who are they, why are they there, what are they up to? etc, etc. Tolkien was adamant in having Bombadl be a mystery never meant to be definitively answered. I have been starting to suspect the same as with Coldhands, and his exclusion in the series exactly where he should have first appeared at Whitetree, then when Bran and Co passed through the Wall (with no Black Gate scene).
I wonder if GRRM created Coldhands to be that Bombadil type of enigma that never gets answered and the value lies in the wondering. In that light, making such a deep book into a film series required excluding such a extraneous mystery that would only confuse viewers, and likewise I think it is the same with Coldhands. If his identity was never meant to be revealed and the main characters leave him behind without any answers ever given, it makes sense that he would be cut to avoid confusing viewers not familiar with the books, who are by far the majority.
Â 
Most importantly, the way in which they have circumvented Coldhands' role as guide to the TEC's lair was to simply have Bran and Co encounter a weirwood, have Hodor bring Bran over who then touches and wargs it. He then declares he knows where they have to go - nice and neat-ish, no Coldhands necessary.
Â 
More than anything I would love to get answers about Coldhands, whether he is Benjen or someone else, but given the overall narrative and the way it is playing out now on screen and in the books, I think we may never get them.
Â 
Absolutely, by no stretch of the imagination was Popsicle that delivered Craster's baby to Night's King Coldhands.
5349	redriver	2014-04-30	Yeah it makes more sense to have the WWs look more human. I wonder how they'll handle Jon's transformation into a WW?


I think he's ready for this now.I doubt he could put up much resistance.
5350	grufolo	2014-04-30	This.Â 
Yes he was cool in the books but he's not in the show so deal with it. 

Is this sure?
Bran and the rest could still meet him if they escape from Crasters keep, unless they said the character would not be scripted
5351	grufolo	2014-04-30	I tend to think that if any child was good for turning, ww would just walk in wildling villages and take them ( wildlings not being able to oppose a resistance), leaving behind the occasional male for reproduction. All wildling willages would soon turn to versions of Crasters keep in 2 generations.
No, they want exactly those babies of that one man.
Which are 3\4 craster blood.
Craster is no king, the only blood that matters is the one of Valyria and, maybe, the one of the First men. I find fascinating the theory that the counterparts of dragons may be wolves, although i still think that ww are the dragon's counterparts from the darkness.
Surely the role of the CotF will prove crucial to understand how the armies of fire and ice look at each other. I think too that we'll find not so many spoilers in the next tv shows, so lets savour this one while waiting for the books.
P.s. does anyone have a screen of the letters on the altar of ice?

Craster is no king, the only blood that matters is the one of Valyria and, maybe, the one of the First men. I find fascinating the theory that the counterparts of dragons may be wolves, although i still think that ww are the dragon's counterparts from the darkness.
Surely the role of the CotF will prove crucial to understand how the armies of fire and ice look at each other. I think too that we'll find not so many spoilers in the next tv shows, so lets savour this one while waiting for the books.
P.s. does anyone have a screen of the letters on the altar of ice?


Â 
The White Walkers are definitely the counterpart to the dragons - the idea of the Starks and Targs being counterparts is slightly different. Both are old bloodlines, both are bloodlines steeped in magic. One bloodline revolves around dragons which symbolize the magic of the east and fire, the other a bloodline around dire wolves and the ancient magic of the north and snow. This doesn't mean dire wolves and Others go hand-in-hand, mind you. If anything it seems the dire wolves are a force opposed to the Others as well (if they were taken as the Stark banner animal, and even the idea of the name 'Winterfell' playing into it) - but it may be that the blood of the Starks is important for conversions since it's so strongly tied to the north.
Â 
And, as was mentioned, I think every northern house has some Stark blood in it, the Karstarks definitely. So the idea that Craster is the bastard of a Night's Watch member with thin Stark blood could be something. But, as was mentioned, his mother was also a witch from Whitetree - so that could have just as much importance as anything from the father. The only reason people latch onto the blood of the father thing is the repeated mentions of the strength of the Blood of Kings.

Â 
Eh, the only connection I can see is Valyria - it might be explored more later on but from the wiki it doesn't impart much other than it was a religion founded by escaped Valyrian slaves who sailed to the land that would become Braavos.
Â 
So I think it might just be a coincidence, for now.

You do realize agnostic and atheist are two different things right? Agnostic means you do not acknowledge any one single God and instead are open to the idea there could possibly be other explanations or existence. One who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God.
Â 
I think it is the open minded agnostic who can imagine the most amazing fantasy of all.Â 

Did you seriously just call ASoIaF the most amazing fantasy of all?
5357	Blazfemur	2014-04-30	Did you seriously just call ASoIaF the most amazing fantasy of all?


Â 
It is. If you disagree, you are wrong. LotR cant hold a candle to ASOIAF, and so far, with everything ive gotten into through the years, the complexity of this series has had me obsessed for more than two years straight.
Â 
I got into the books, right at the end of season 2. read all five, then reread all five. no way in hell id be able to do that with any other series, and back to back starting over again.

5358	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-30	Didn't Mormont say that whatever the Wildlings customs were, it wasn't the Watch's concern? or something to that effect? I definitely agree with you that the reason the Watch didn't ask was because it wasn't their right to judge and nor did they want to know.Â 
Â 
I still think the women know a bit more, hence the ritual chant when the child was brought in. We didn't see that in the book, so there's potential there for some more spoilers.
Â 
Jon knew that these history lessons were crucial if the Watch was to find a way to stop them, and that's why he tasked Sam to read the books and then go off to train as a Maester.Â 


Have you seen that lovely theory on this thread or on Heresy (can't remember, Alzheimer's) about Craster being an unimportant sperm donor while the women actually carry the right bloodline a run the show. It was an interesting idea. Worth keeping in mind. Especially since the collective chant. Up until that point we all thought women were forced to give away their sons by Craster. But is it the other way around? And will Craster's baby draw the Others all the way to the Wall?

Braavos. Coincidence? Or some connection between the North and Braavos?


So far, I can see many connections. Some are explainable, some are not:
1. Braavos is as against slavery as Westeros, but it has an active cult of death - Faceless Men who could find themselves on the side of the Others.
2. The Iron Bank of Braavos is suddenly present in the north and finances both Stannis and the NW. One can say that's because Cersei defaulted with repayments, but what if there is more to it, especially since they gave a loan to the NW.Â 
3. LF is originally from Braavos and he is creating chaos throughout Westeros while being continuously obsessed with Tully girls turned northern women.
4. Arya is apprenticing with FM while Sansa is LF's apprentice.
Â 
Not much, but still ...
5361	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-30	I think he's ready for this now.I doubt he could put up much resistance.

5362	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-30	Does anyone have Craster's quotes from the book about his relationship with the "gods" handy? FWIW, I didn't get the impression from the way he talked about the Others that he felt that his sacrifices were in any way unique. It seemed like "getting right with the gods" was something anyone could do, in his view.


I got that impression too. He was "a godly man".

Boba Fett. Worst side character ever. people care more about him than about the main story. And he is way more interesting than the main hero.

It would actually have been an even more intriguing story, if George never gave us a pov of the story of Dany. We would be caught in Westeros and be wondering if the tales about her dragons are true or not. That would be so amazing.
That's why I read the books only in one pov at a time. You see the whole story only from one point. And you always are wondering what will the other do next.
I also love the undisclosed things. What's going on in Asshai? Who is Melisandre? What do the Others want? What are the Others?
It's nice to know everything about the opponent, what Orcs are and were and what they want, but not knowing it is far more intriguing. You are really part of the story then.

I don't know if it's the women or CrasterÂ  - but it sure seems like Gilly's baby at the Wall could turn out to be important for the story. It also indicates that the baby switch Jon made could have very grave consequences, since otherwise the baby would have gone down South, very far away to be implicated.

Don't shy away. Daenerys is the villain and always has been the villain, from a certain pov..
Â 
She is for me the favoured outcome, yet I see her as the villain to the remaining usurper's dogs. Even if I am a fan of the Lannisters, she will crush them. And the remaining North.
Same as Mance. He is the rightful king beyond the wall and his wildlings are good people but villains to the North.

I consider "villain," not particularly through perspective of the characters assumption, by my own assumption. Her morals are getting clouded, she's developing that messianic complex and anyone that has different views than her is an enemy and wrong, in her eyes.
Â 
Her story is a constant deterioration and degradation of morality and open-mindedness.
Â 
I refuse to turn this into another Daenerys thread though lmao. Cant do that.
Â 
Furthermore, I would liek to input, in respect to the topic; How much do you want to bet, that The Others have a just cause? Everyone sees them as the enemy.. They have a culture, a social hierarchy apparently. We know so little, I'd love to see a twist, and find out that their cause is the revenge of the COTFM or of the like.
Â 
Imagine, the wall, put up, to segregate those who worshipped the Old Gods. Wildlings, etc. All the rich and those who worship the seven or R'hllor, have openworld territory. Those of the Old Gods? Majority of them are North, and most fo them, are segregated beyond the wall. And theyre tired of it. All of them. Wildlings, Others, etc.
Â 
On the question of morality, i truly want to know, why the wall was put up and what were the situations that led to it's building.
Â 
A scene could EASILY, have been, "Ok Bran the Builder... I have your entire family.. You will construct a wall to keep all the filth away from the seven kingdoms... Only then will you see them again." Or something of the sort. Through time, tales change, and the wall becomes a symbol of "protection" as a game of telephone is played with written documentation.
Â 
Sam did specifically tell Jon, in the library, that documentation only goes so far back. That could be on purpose. Why, why is the Night's Watch comprised strictly of villainy? Why did the Night's King fall in love.. Or did he realize something was clearly messed up, and left on his own accord?

Unless I'm mistaken, those encircled around those pillars were all wearing black. We also haven't seen what the other Others look like from up close, so it could be possible that he was just one Other from a council of them. It could be that he's just one of whom can perform the ritual, or it could be that he has to be the one to do it.Â

I have a theory following this sorta. I dont think The Others want to get to King's Landing. I just think they want to break past the wall. Furthermore, following Old Nan, The Night's King is a Stark. I think The Night's King wants to get to winterfell, and in particular, winterfell's crypts.
Â 
for one of these possible reasons:
Â 
1) his body belongs in winterfell
2) perhaps his female in down there in it's depths, either buried, or trapped, or locked there
5378	Blazfemur	2014-04-30	Pieces of the puzzle:
Â 
Jon Stark/garyen at the wall
The Night's King = Stark, trying to break down the wall
Â 
Winterfell has untold depths and secrets no one has uncovered
There doesn't appear to be the female Night's Queen
Â 
Winterfell's walls are strangely warm (could be hot springs, could be something else)
Â 
Missing swords in the crypts

I think the turning has more to do with the icehenge and the alter in the middle of it. It's a sacred ground. The Other who turned the baby is definitely the highest in the hierarchy. He was defined as Night's King on the HBO website. This would mean that he is also the high priest of the Others. But, he is not the Great Other. So, shall we assume that Night's King is a religious title? Or is it both - a king and a priest?

I believe in the world of Ice and Fire inbreeding gives people supernatural abilities, and it's the inbreeding that's the key. A little inbreeding gets you dragon control and tons of it gets you to be a WW. This is why Tommen will be one of the heads of the dragon!

Same here. Although I am boring people around me to death (I guess :-)). But, this therapy does help in keeping decease at bay. I assume the rules of marketing dictate publishing of the first edition of The World of Ice&Fire and then later amended editions. I shall wait for the final one. As for books 6&7, I believe they will publish book 6 next year as they announced, but I think book 7 will be published between episodes 8 and 9 in the last series. That's when a two week break happens and people will have to read 24/7 if they want to beat the series ending.

There's a lot of blood of the north though. Then again, to support your point, despite martells, plumms, etc, it's only known that Targaryens, are potent dragonblood.
Â 
I want to believe it's not Other blood, persay, but First Men blood, that does the trick. The Starks may be potent like Targ to dragons in that though.

I believe the Night's King was a title already bestowed on him. awhile ago, when he was in the nights watch. Â 
Â 


I know that. But is it the same person or is it just a title passed on from one generation to the other? When I said high priest, I meant that, since he was the one to perform the ritual of turning on Craster's baby on the sacred ground, he must be the highest in a religious hierarchy of the Others.Â

Â 
Also, what the hell would such a developed, undead, magical ice beings want withÂ hot, smelly, sticky King's Landing, and the iron throne? id think the trivial matters of the misinformed kings landing populace are beneath them, at this point. They already clearly have their own hierarchy. Fuck the throne.
Â 
Actually, maybe that's their initiative. Fuck the throne. Destroy it, and the wall too. I'm aboard.

Â 
Oh he's the highest of them. hmm. personally we wouldnt know from what theyve given us, but the inner me wants it to be the original night's king, and for him to find the night's queen, whereever she may be since she clearly wasn't with them. (or, maybe she's there and just not in that scene).

Â 
There's a lot of blood of the north though. Then again, to support your point, despite martells, plumms, etc, it's only known that Targaryens, are potent dragonblood.
Â 
I want to believe it's not Other blood, persay, but First Men blood, that does the trick. The Starks may be potent like Targ to dragons in that though.


But First Men blood wouldn't really further the story. If the Starkens had blood of Others in them, it would give the story a twist and a further endgame. It would make Jon part of dragons and part of others and part of humans. He would be a magic triangle. And maybe Starks are immune to ice magic or some sort of it.. some immune...anything. Maybe Others see them as allies or good, similar to dragon-targ affinity.

Â 
mehhh then why would the wight instinctively go after jon? ill allow that wights themselves are mindless, and we havent really seen an Other confront anyone.
Â 
I like the Other blood thing. Im thinking it through and im thinking, well, arent they a race? a magical race?
Â 
But then i thought, if Others are turned, that means there's no blood change from their original race. They aren't bred, is what im saying, theyre turned. You know? That's what makes me lean toward first men blood.
Â 
Again, we dont know if they can reproduce, or if theyre all turned. But i wouldnt think turning, changes the blood distribution.
Â 
Keep going though. The concept of "ice blood," on the other side of "dragon blood," that's ingenius. There has to be a loop that we're missing though. If Others can breed though, that would be ingenius.
Â 
Wouldn't it be a plot twist, if The Night's King, and his Queen, had a child, and they considered that baby, the "First Man." So all blood descendents, from that said baby, had blood of the "First Man," aka Other's blood.
5393	Blazfemur	2014-04-30	Wait, shhh, quiet a moment.... Imagine, for a sec.. The Night's King, laying his fingertips, on the crest of fallen, dead Viserion... Viserion's once burning eyes, faded out, begin to get their fire back -- a blue one. Viserion awakens, and The Night's King climbs on his back, the pale dragon.

Still thoughOld Nan does speak of Ice Dragons, however, and it is recalled by Jon in ADWD. Ice Dragon is also the constellation that sort of functions like Polaris IRL, you find it in the night sky and it leads you to the north. IIRC it has a shiny blue 'eye' star in it, which you follow.

5398	GrimTuesday	2014-04-30	Did it seem to anyone else that there was a castle of sorts behind the line of WWs? I theorized a long ass time ago that perhaps the original Winterfell was farther north.
5399	dmo862000	2014-04-30	I'm a big fan of this surprise addition. I'm also a big fan of the posts in which GRRM is kind of the 'culprit' here as opposed to D&D. The show was always going to surpass the books. I'd rather they did it in an organized manner as opposed to the completely disorganized manner of AFFC and ADWD. Brienne's 9 million chapters of random wandering and Bran's chapters of.... well what he went through.... would translate terribly to a TV show who has a high but limited budget with such expensive potential things to film. If you don't want to deal with spoils and deviations then quit watching a show which has been doing both for years now.I was giddy as soon as I saw the one other trotting into the Land of Always Winter. If GRRM isn't going to get on top of it (I'm sorry how many conventions and side projects has he been involved with since the release of ADWD?) then I'm glad someone decided to. And he's free to do so, but don't blame the show producers who are pretty much ONLY dedicated to the show and have a rabid fan base for taking liberties and creating 'spoilers.' Â  A TV show works differently than a book, half of the good book material won't translate and my apologies to purists but not even that half is all good material. I loved the scene and am incredibly happy with being surprised in such a major way.

I couldn't have said it better myself. Â I thoroughly enjoyed watching that scene. Â I watched the Inside the Episode, and they were saying how if something that is mysterious is revealed, it longer is mysterious. Â They wanted to show a bit of the White Walkers, but only enough so that we had more questions than answers. Â They nailed it.

Not that there's been too many WW encounters in the books, but through all of them there's no report of any FEMALE WW.

If my memory is correct that little girl was a wight and not a white walker. Human with blue eyes, but definitely not an ice elf lady.

Â 
You're confusing wights with white walkers / others. Wights are just mindless zombies who are created from risen corpses. White Walkers or "Others" are the creatures / beings that create them and are a sentient race. We were revealed in that last episode how a living human baby can be 'turned' into a White Walker, not a Wight.
5405	Waylin Stark	2014-04-30	I don't think it's Coldhands either. Isn't Coldhands some sort of half dead Wight? Â Baby Carrier Guy Â was a full blown Other.

I don't know how the rumor started that it was Coldhands.
He's a cloaked wight who rides an elk for goodness' sake.

5408	redriver	2014-05-01	Why would Jon transform into the Other? There is as much fire as ice in him? Can you elaborate pls?


As I alluded earlier I don't think Jon will have much choice in the matter.He will not choose it,they will.Loads of foreshadowing for this in the novels including Bran's coma dream and Jon's dream of being armoured in black ice and wielding a red sword.
Â 
In narrative terms in order to answer Jon's question of who the WW are,where do they come from and what do they want?-someone is going to have to communicate with them and I don't think you can do that unless you "share" their condition.
Â 
I think the Others were human,their souls consigned to the ice realm,probably as a result of sorcery by the greenseers which backfired,(the hammer of the waters).What they want is out of it.
5409	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-01	Its very likely that Jon will be turned:
Â 
"Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist."
Â 
It could also be Stannis that turns aswell:
Â 
"a blue-eyed king with a red sword in his hand who cast no shadow"
Â 
George constantly points out that Stannis has blue eyes and we know that he's not Azor Asshai or at less its not as simple as that.
Â 
And Dany's visions:
"When she saw the Usurperâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rebel host across the river they were armoured all in ice, but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part exulted. This is how it was meant to be."
5410	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-01	Armoured in Ice can also mean the Army consisting of Northmen.Â
5411	Ankedo	2014-05-01	You may be right come to think of it, at least about Jon.  Especially if Jon is the son of  Reahgar and Lyanna, and this supposed Aegon is a fake. That would make Jon the next in line for the Targaryen throne. Making him a king. The Starks clearly have a tie to the "Other", so this ice and fire mix  just might mean something. Every one seems to think either Jon and Danny will be together, or go to war with each other as the champions of the "other" and R'holr. Maybe they will and they will destroy each other and    it will be all the side characters to inherit the earth.
5412	Hippocras	2014-05-01	Armored in ice can mean ANYTHING!
Like it could mean his hidden identity as Ned's bastard, which has protected him his whole life. Starks are "ice", Ned wielded Ice, Jon's facial expressions have been described as ice - giving nothing away which is a kind of social armor.
Seriously, it should not be taken as a given he will be "otherized".

It's not a given.It's a theory based on my understanding of the text based on foreshadowing,mirroring and other literary devices.Of course any quote can be interpreted in a variety of ways.When a multiplicity of passages lead in the same direction it becomes valid as a theory.
Â 
This is why I use qualifiers such as "I think" rather than "I believe".
5414	Crow'sEye	2014-05-01	The only thing that made me angry from the episode was Jon Snow knowing that Bran was alive! this ruins the entire theme of the story!


Indeed, that is most likely the largest deviation in the story.
5415	Crow'sEye	2014-05-01	Craster is no king, the only blood that matters is the one of Valyria and, maybe, the one of the First men. I find fascinating the theory that the counterparts of dragons may be wolves, although i still think that ww are the dragon's counterparts from the darkness.


King's blood is important we have read/heard. Power plays a part there. Craster might be considered a King. Val's baby is in danger due to it's (cannot recall sex) King's blood.
5416	Crow'sEye	2014-05-01	Â  
Â 
LotR is a great series, but it is not the best of all time forever. Martin set new standards to fantasy and writing in general.


I love the world of Middle-Earth (LotR is a small part) and the Discworld (which has internal logic contrary to 'fantasy world's not having to make sense from a much earlier post), they sit alongside Westeros stories for me.
Just finished reading this whole thread.

That's interesting. Could you look up for relevant quotes? I'd do it myself, but I'm too caught up in writing something and its your baby after all. I wouldn't like to derail your theory, but hear more. Maybe I missed your earlier posts. Could you repost them? From what you're saying, it seems that his relationship with the wildlings foreshadows his relationship with the WW. He has an open mind, but wildlings and WWs are enemies. Or are they? What do you think? I agree that Jon being LC of the NW certainly qualifies to join the Others. But, Mel is helping him and she is opposed to the Others. I do see Jon as a singularity, a song of Ice and Fire who is made of both aspects and is the only one who can bring two sides together. Also, I'd like to hear more of your hammer of the Waters theory. Great post.
5418	Arry Lannister	2014-05-01	That would make Jon the next in line for the Targaryen throne

Wouldn't he still be a bastard since Rhaegar was married to Elia at the time. So all that really happens is that Jon is now...... a fancy bastard!

The show has made a pretty big deal about the WW taking specifically Craster's children with no mention ever of any wildling babies being abducted. It would be a really easy thing to work in while Jon was over the wall for someone to mention.Â

I agree this thread is too long to follow. The poster who started it should open another thread. We discussed this on this thread. I'll try to repeat what I said. Old Nan had a saying "Others take you." So, that was a part of the lore. I postulated the same thing about naming the children. Somehow, a name is important. Does it give the Others access to the rest of the family??? So a timeframe for children to be taken is two to three years. Someone else postulated a great idea that it is not Cratser's blood that matters, but the blood of women. Not sure about that, but it's a novel thought that may make sense after the latest episode when women chanted together. Hope this helps somewhat.

That would work for me in the books, but the show can't be and seldom is that subtle. If baby abducting was a thing universally and not just Craster's, for whatever reason, I think they'd have at least mentioned it directly once when we spent a whole season with Jon beyond the Wall.

I wonder whether Craster's deal (or curse) has meant the WW have not had to take other Wildling children?Â Â  But the traditions of not naming them remain from the past when sometimes a child would be taken that way?Â

I'd think if you were interested in making an army you wouldn't be satisfied with one baby every few months and could just invade the hundreds of thousands of wildlings and take their babies if it didn't matter whose they were and if they weren't given as a sacrifice. And I think the idea of not naming children is because they die so often in infancy. It's sort of akin to Ser Arlan telling Dunk not to name his horse because it may die in your service.Â
5425	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-01	I just had a thought and I'd like your opinion on it. It is linked to previous posts on Craster's babies. What if the 13 Others we've seen in the clip are all former LC of the NW? Maybe they are taking Craster's children, because he is a bastard child of one of LCs and, as we know, they can take no wife, father no children. So, when they break their vows somehow their blood should be taken away from the land of the normal people? I know that logic is not sound here altogether. My assumption would explain why Craster's blood, but it wouldn't explain why would the Others allow him to breed so much if he is a consequence of breaking of the NW vows.

I don't quite follow this sentence. Also, the Others are only taking what Craster gives them, so boys only.
5427	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-01	I don't quite follow this sentence. Also, the Others are only taking what Craster gives them, so boys only.


What I meant was that no brother of the NW should have any children and when he breaks his vows, that blood should be taken away from the world of the normal people. Maybe that's his punishment for breaking the vows - to have all his male offspring turned into the Others, because they shouldn't have existed in the realms of men in the first place. Of course, the Others cannot reach the lands on the other side of the Wall, so all offspring of brothers' venturing to brothels of Molestown are safe. For now. I hope it's clearer. Thoughts?

Â 
That implies godly involvement. Maybe north of the wall The Great Other can do this, if he is even real. But that means Craster himself should have been taken away as a child. Unless the Others came seeking his blood only when he was an adult, and he cut a deal with them. Interesting theory.
Â 
One thought I had is why has Bloodraven allowed Craster to live for so long? Coldhands or a murder of ravens would have easily taken care of the bastard. Even if Craster was his son, Bloodraven is not above kinslaying, nor would he care that Craster offers a shelter to rangers from time to time.

5429	Bear Claw	2014-05-01	I was also curious about the 12 other Others in that scene. If they are former LCs, I wonder if they became Others or maybe the Others were the ones who originally were manning the wall? (Until the Night's KingÂ  startedÂ breaking some kind of rule) Â Craster isÂ  a friend to the watch and works with the Others so there seems to be a connection between the watch and the Others.
5430	salmonsnake	2014-05-01	Godly involvement and/or another game of thrones, in the lands of always winter. I imagine the continent expands well beyond the line at which all the maps cut off: night's watch and night's king's brethren as border patrol, and a culture, advanced or primitive far north. Bloodraven as humanity's secret intelligence agency, Coldhands as secret agent, or double agent. Maybe the ice dragons hatched. Rh'llor knows there are no Starks in Winterfell. Time to make a move. When all the characters are flawed, why shouldn't the gods be flawed... One takes adults and wishes them dead (the many faces: the red god, death, Rh'llor, the drowned god) the Other takes babies and makes them immortal. Both resurrect in their particular ways.

Â 
it's rumored that Craster's father was a crow and his mother from Whitetree, but his father was almost probably NOT a Lord Commander.Â 
Â 
I don't know if we can infer anything from the other 13 council members we saw in last week's episode. Clearly there's a lot more Others than just those 13+1, and they seem to take sacrificed male infants and turn them into others (and that Craster seems to the only one doing this), but outside of that nothing else is certain. Going any farther than that is heavy conjecture.Â 
Â 
What I'm personally hoping is that the show and the books deviate widely in their interpretation of the Others and the origins, history, and endeavors. I'd much rather see two entirely different interpretations than the same thing over again in a different medium
5432	salmonsnake	2014-05-01	If they enslaved or used to enslave giants, it is not difficult to raise cities in the permafrost, with material like dragonglass. I can't wait for D&D to show us obsidian cathedrals, castles, statues... Keep your eyes peeled

I don't think the others care if the women wur chanting seeing it as a "sacrifice" is sum bull craster prolly ejumicated his wife's to make it easier for them . the other that Sam shanked didn't seem to mind that gilly didn't want to give it up. It also didn't try to slaughter Sam just slightly nudged him outta the way, probably to busy thinking about babynappin crasters seed cause dude made a deal .
5434	Brian Boru Brightflame	2014-05-01	who was LC of the NW before Mormont?
5435	Slade7	2014-05-01	who was LC of the NW before Mormont? Lord Commander Qorgyle entered the Night's Watch some time before Ser Denys Mallister[1]. During his term, Castle Black used to send patrols East towards Eastwatch-by-the-sea every third day, and West towards Shadow Tower every second day.[2] It was during his time as Lord Commander that Mance Rayder deserted the Watch, at a time when Jon Snow was already living in Winterfell.[3] -that's from wiki
5436	salmonsnake	2014-05-01	who was LC of the NW before Mormont?A man called Qorgyle, the 996th LC. Mormont was elected in the 290s AC. Incidentally, Bloodraven was sent to the Wall 233 AC. Not sure about the ones in-between... Aemon knew, since he was sent together with Bloodraven.

You're confusing wights with white walkers / others. Wights are just mindless zombies who are created from risen corpses. White Walkers or "Others" are the creatures / beings that create them and are a sentient race. We were revealed in that last episode how a living human baby can be 'turned' into a White Walker, not a Wight.


Â 
I know the difference.Â  I just thought that little girl was a WW.Â  Come to think of it, maybe she was a wight.Â  In that case, my original point stands. There's no known female WW.
5438	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-01	Â 
That implies godly involvement. Maybe north of the wall The Great Other can do this, if he is even real. But that means Craster himself should have been taken away as a child. Unless the Others came seeking his blood only when he was an adult, and he cut a deal with them. Interesting theory.
Â 
One thought I had is why has Bloodraven allowed Craster to live for so long? Coldhands or a murder of ravens would have easily taken care of the bastard. Even if Craster was his son, Bloodraven is not above kinslaying, nor would he care that Craster offers a shelter to rangers from time to time.


When I think of it now (and I never thought of that before, so do not expect any deep thoughts), Bloodraven can be involved anyway. First of all, he was LC of the NW. So, if we follow the logic of the icy 13 being former LCs of the NW, he would qualify to join them at some point. Why didn't he though? Is it because of his Targaryen blood that he somehow cannot be turned due to the fire element that annuls the icy nature of the Others? Where does his sorcery come from? I didn't read the original book where Bloodraven appears, so I cannot say much. Why did he side with CotF? If Craster is indeed his son, he would be 1/4 Targaryen. Wouldn't the same rule of incompatibility with Others apply to him and his children? I am not saying it would, I'm thinking while writing. Let's consider this. Craster died in 299AC. He is described as an old man. Let's say he was around 70. That would mean he was born in 220s. Who was the LC of the NW then? Bloodraven was born in 175Ac and sent to the wall in 233AC, so he was 58 when he joined the NW. Not young at all. And he did not become a LC the same year anyway. It is still possible that he is indeed Craster's father if we consider Craster to be around 60 years old. We don't know who Bloodraven's predecessor as LC was, do we? I couldn't find it. That predecessor may be the strongest candidate for fathering Craster. Him or Bloodraven.
Â 
However, we may look at this from another angle. If the icy 13 are indeed former LC of the NW, they would ensure that all oath-breakers are punished. Starks do it south of the Wall, The Others would do it north of the Wall. So, the punishment for desertion is death. What would a punishment for taking a wife or fathering a child be? Maybe taking the offspring from the realms of men and turning them into Others. Since women took no oath, there should be no punishment for them, so as long as a brother of the NW keeps producing offspring, they will be taken and turned, but just boys, so that the oath-breaker's line cannot continue. Girls will continue someone else's line.
Â 
Craster was not taken. That's an anomaly. Why? Maybe because Bloodraven, as his father, protected him with his sorcery and powers learned from CotF. By producing offspring with his own daughters, Craster ensures his bloodline stays pure and he offers his sons to Others. Sounds like some deal and penance for being spared to me.
Â 
Consequently, if we agree on all previous assumptions, Mance Rayder should be killed by Others as a deserter and his son taken and turned. Unless he is also protected by Bloodraven for some reason. Note that Mance wears a helmet with raven wings that may suggest some connection there. He also wears a Targaryen coloured cloak (black with three streaks of red silk).
Â 
Whatever we may conclude from this, it would seem the Others may show up at the Wall to take Gilly's son. Jon's decision to remove Mance's son from the Wall may have interesting consequences then. Thoughts?

Â 
The little girl from season 1 was dead, nailed or impaled to a tree - that was one of the first, most startling graphic images we had of the first episode. The Others killed her and her entire wildling camp. She came back as a wight, risen from the dead, not a White Walker / Other.

I did my best to help my fellow poster's theory along. We do know, at least from the show (and that's what we are discussing here) that the main ice-priest was identified as Night's King. And we know his story. So, the theory develops from there. Nothing is written in stone and I tried to reason the best I could. In my book, crackpottery is the word that should not be used lightly. If you can introduce any counterarguments, it would be more than helpful for all of us on this thread. We are all here to discuss in good spirit. Only GRRM and two main GoT producers know what happens in the end. We can only speculate, but try to do it logically. That's what I did. That's all I can do.

Indeed. Thank you. It's far from anything remotely definitive.

This didn't ruin anything for me and I'm a book reader first and foremost.
Â 
You know what's unprofessional? An author who thinks so very little of what is clearly his lifes work that he drags his feet long enough to let a show about it pass him by. He had plenty of warning...between pre-production and the four seasons he's had 6 years+...he could have easily gotten WoW out by now if he'd cut down on every other peripheral thing he's involved with.
Â 
Frankly at this point I'm just glad I'm seeing resolution somewhere...I have zero faith GRRM will ever finish this. WoW could literally be the Battles of Ice and Fire being wrapped up then every other character just walking around longer going someplace, with Martin deciding he'll need a book 8.


Â 
 
Â 
The show is going to surpass the books. Period. Â This had to be part of the original contract. Â HBO is not going to throw away a huge money maker by waiting around for the books to be finished.
Â 
The books may never be finished. Â Martin has written himself into several corners.
Â 
I just want some resolution. Â If it has to come from some bastardized HBO showrunners, then at least I have some ending, rather than none.
Â 
I repeat: the show is going to finish long before the written version is finished. Â 
Â 
If this bothers book readers, they need to either stop watching the show or find some resolution.
Â 
I suspect that we might get two very different stories although the endings of each will generally jibe. Â Sort of like the differences in the Sept scene upset most of us, but we will be forced to accept Â those differences and move on.
Â 
There is no way the show is going to wait for Martin to finish 2+ books. Â No way. Â I am sure this is in the contract and the main reason Martin had to supply the ending to D&D.
Â 
It is amazing how many tortured theories can come out of a 15 second scene and how many different interpretations are possible.
Â 
I cannot see Coldhands as a White Walker. Â He is helping Bran fulfill his destiny which is to help save humans. Â Jojen makes it clear if he doesn't go north and do what he needs to do, all is lost, i.e. all human life is lost.
Â 
But reading all these crackpot theories is a kind of entertainment of itself, frustrating as it is. Â 
Â 
By the way, all the abbreviations make it impossible for me to follow about 30% of what is written here. Â This is, in itself, interesting, as so many of you assume everyone can follow what you are keyboarding when we can't.Â 
Â 
Wouldn't it be worth it to type out a little more so that others could understand you?
5449	ToTheWolves	2014-05-01	Not sure if it's been asked or if anyone noticed, but in the show one if crasters wives/daughters states that it is CRASTERS LAST born baby boy. So what's going to happen now that craster isn't around to produce anymore? Any ideas or theories?... Could it be that's the reason craster made his daughters his wives? To keep the blood pure?
I'm just speculating here

Â 
Honestly, this is the first (and perhaps the only) time in my life that a show/movie becomes a spoiler for its book original. And I'm actually quite intrigued/excited by the situation rather than terrified/enraged like most fans here.
Â 
First off, we won't need to wait forever to find out how the story ends, which would most likely be the case without the show.
Â 
Secondly, reading the books will still be exciting, because the books cover many parts of the story the show never even touched. The books have characters who don't exist in the show and all those characters/subplots absent from the show have a bigger or smaller role to play in the books, so in the end the outcome in the books will always be a bit different.
The show has changed so much about the original story, I'm pretty sure it's started getting a life of its own, thus there might still be many interesting things in the books that never happen in the show and vice versa.
Â 
Finally, the books give a deep analysis of the POV characters' peronality and way of thinking, something the show will never be able to deliver so even if the events end up the same, the books will give us a more in depth analysis of what the characters think of those events.
Â 
Like I said, I am very excited for both the show and the books, regardless of what comes out first and what spoils what. Actually, I think I'm even more excited for the show knowing it might spoil the books. For the books I'm excited no matter what.

5452	Dan Bingler	2014-05-01	I read most of the posts and responses of this thread and many theories are interesting. It was definitely a provocative episode, and as someone who has read the books more than a couple times and has perused the forum speculation to no end, there were parts I really resisted at first (Bran and Jon seemingly being drawn to meet at Craster's) and parts that blew me away immediately (the most-mentioned part, the final scene). I've re-read all of the books recently so it's pretty fresh in my mind, so hopefully my opinion will be met with something less than apprehension. As for the people complaining about show reveals from the future books, sorry you feel inconvenienced but get over yourselves; you knew going into this show series that it would be a slippery slope, and now halfway through you're upset? Don't watch, or do and accept the consequences. I thought Bran's weirwood vision revealed more about future books than this scene did, the HBO synopsis gaffe aside. Anyhow...
Â 
What the last scene suggested to me upon watching:
-Nothing at all about Coldhands. At all.
-An important ritual allows the White Walkers to bolster their ranks in some way; whether the result is a bastard half-human half-White Walker creature is unknown.
-The ritual is not a method to create wights; the proximity of White Walkers to dead humans (and other living creatures, as evidenced in book and show) is enough to create Wights.
-This ritual could only be/would only be performed ceremoniously and with a specific individual - with distinctive head markings differentiating him from others - doing the 'turning' so to speak. A total of 13 White Walkers attended this ceremony.
Â 
Now, here's my speculation since I finished watching, thought about the books, and read what you kind/generally informed folks have discussed - and I think it's worth mentioning that my context is one in which the show runners know a lot more about the story than people seem to give them credit for here. It's just my assumption, of course, but I think that they don't just know the 'ending' but are frequently in discussion with GRRM about how the story is shaping up. I don't know that, of course, but it sure makes sense to me more than them mostly making things up between books 5 and 7. So basically, if the books STRONGLY POINT to the significance of something, I'm going to assume that the show will also do so. And, I dare say to you all, the other way around. Continuing...
Â 
- While at the time of watching it was obvious to me that the White Walker who was performing the ritual was, in some way, distinguished. That it is the Night's King, which I fully believe is accurate but a mistaken reveal by stoned interns filling out the website, changes things a bit in that it is someone who, per the books, *was not* a White Walker and *became* a White Walker (or, again, some facsimile or bastardization). I think this is enough to prove that the Night's King cannot also be the Great Other, to address that speculation of contraction for the show.
-We know a woman matching the description of a White Walker (albeit a cute/non-bony one) seduced the 13th Lord Commander and 'turned' him, and that he was sacrificing to the Others - now, we basically see how that was done. This suggests to me that the Great Other sent her - and needed the Night's King, or a human, to be 'turned' in some specific way in order for that person to be able to afflict other humans (perhaps in a different way, which is why they need babies?). Obviously a person in power was a better target, since he would have a means to defend his practices. His defeat at the hands of the King of the North and the King Beyond the Wall apparently either did not destroy him, and we see him now continuing those practices in order to continue to fill the White Walker (not wight) ranks out, or a new Night's King has taken his place.
-The Last Hero, who was mentioned once in tale and never again, is an intriguing thought because of the number '13'. He and his 12 companions (and a dog) set off on a last-ditch effort against the Others. All his friends died and he seemed doomed but we don't know the result of the tale. But the significance of 13? The Night's King was the 13th Lord Commander. He reigned for 13 years. The Last Hero was one of 13 companions. What does this all mean? Who knows. It doesn't mean anything right now, that's for sure, but it does make you wonder.
Â 
I can't really speculate much more than that because it didn't really answer anything, but I wanted to address some of the better (and worse) speculations I read through here in the past few days.Â  I think it's also important to remind ourselves that we're a tiny segment of curious individuals who really, really enjoy this series and that if GRRM or anyone involved in the show were making story decisions based upon anything we say or think, they'd be fools. Let's just enjoy the books, enjoy the shows, realize they're different and alike at the same time, and not take ourselves too seriously when we want to guess at what may or may not be happening in the future of Westeros. I, personally, love to speculate and wonder and read everyone else's (constructive) thoughts. It's really a fun thing to do, and I was excited to find out what people thought about such a interesting (and momentous, as many have pointed out regarding books and film) point in the story.

Â 
There are significant changes, but I imagine they'll want to keep the general structure of the story the same. If that guy is the Night's King and is going to be an important character, I'd be very surprised if they decide to change that. Most of their changes can be worked into the story, such as the one with Jon. Yes, he's going on the ranging mission, but it's likely that he'll end up where he needs to be for when he's LC. A major change to the whole story wouldn't make sense, depending on the importance of what we saw.
5456	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2014-05-01	Â 
If we go into crackpot territory, it makes sense that the First Men were unable to build the Wall. Now, if the Wall was built by White Walkers, why can't undead Coldhands get through it? It should have a backdoor of sorts through which the White Walkers can go through. And why does it form a barrier for warging? And if the Wall was built by White Walkers... well, why man it with their enemies? Maybe they've built the Wall to ensure a perpetual winter North of it and the First Men built the castles to man it afterwards?
Â 


What if the Wall was not built to keep White Walkers north, but to keep the First Men south?Â
5457	BlueDragon	2014-05-01	Â 
I expect the community to have a lot of fun with this over the next few weeks. Personally, this just gave more credence to the idea that Bran and BR (And possibly Jon Snow) are not going to be "Saving the world" so much as ambiguously fighting on one side of ancient war.


Â 
So Jojen is just a pawn in all of this? Â Bran isn't key to saving anything. Â He isn't everything. Â Jojen is wrong.
Â 
I've read so many contradictory theories, my head is spinning. Â It is one thing for Martin to want to create a lot of grey characters because humans are grey, not Sauron vs. Frodo, who was, in fairness really changed into a grey character by his intimacy with the ring. It is quite another to create a fantasy world in which the reader can't even take a side in this ancient war, i.e. when Jon says, "I want to fight for the side that fights for the living." Â That line, while a lie in one sense, was Jon's true feeling and reflected how he felt Mormont should not have supported Craster in any way. Â 
Â 
Now, I can accept they everyone is mightily confused as to which side is the 'good' side, but the implications of all these theories when weighed against one another is that there exists no right side.
Â 
So even rooting for humans as opposed to White Walkers and Wights becomes ambiguous?
Â 
Now, that is one confusing story. Â Humans in this story, both book and video version, are truly assholes a lot of the time, but a story written by a human which does not validate the survival of humans as a good thing is a huge deviation from what we humans expect from our narratives.
Â 
That would be a Terminator story in which we humans accepted an ending in which the machines replaced the humans as perhaps tragic, but ultimately justified and okay.
Â 
And I always believed Craster's boy children were being transformed into WW in some way, not wights.
Â 
How baby WW's grow up is still another mystery. Â I half expected the child in this week's episode to magically grow to adult size. Â What do WW's eat? Â What sustains them? Â The cold itself?
Â 
The idea that humans built the wall has always bothered me. Â How did they get all that ice, not to mention, how did they stack it that high. Â They used magic. Â Sam has told us and his statement's turned out to be true. Â 
Â 
While does the horn of winter even exist? Â Why plan to bring down the Wall, ever?
Â 
As usual, this unfinished story creates thousands and thousands of pages of questions, none of which are getting answered.
Â 
But as I said before: the show is going to outpace the novels and finish some version of the story and this was probably always Martin's intention as he knows how fast he can write and he has not holed himself up somewhere, refusing to be distracted so that he can finish is life's work.
Â 
Reminds me of a friend who keeps working with the idea that she will never die.

5458	DaveSumm	2014-05-01	I'm trying to judge how generic a term 'Night's King' is. Is it possible someone came up with it, it got included in the synopsis, then they realised it was an actual person in I&F lore and removed it? Or is that too unlikely? 
Or perhaps the reason the original Night's King's bride proposed that title is because it was an existing title in Other-dom? And this is just the current, official, Night's King?
I'm basically clutching at straws that we haven't been spoiled. If the 'broad brushstrokes' that D&D know include the Night's King, that means he and all the Old Nan tales become very important, particularly the possibility that he's decended from Starks. I mean that's last-book-holy-shit-reveal territory.
5459	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-01	I mean that's last-book-holy-shit-reveal territory.


No, it isn't. There must be other holy-shit-reveals as well. I think by the end, everything we thought in the beginning will prove to be untrue.
5460	Blazfemur	2014-05-01	I wonder if there's any connection.. Between the fact The Night's King has been taking only boys, and the Night's Watch vows.
Â 
Think of the correlation.
Â 
They are, in fact, the sword in the darkness
He's not fathering any children. He's taking them.
They're nomadic, so they hold no lands.
There are no females, so they dont take wives.
I didn't see any female Other, so so far, from what we've seen, they've upheld the Nightly Oath. The Night's King is the only exception to this, and the only female we know about is that one, and from what we know it is only one.
Â 
Weird, how the only one who broke his vows to an Other, is the only one, who appears to be able to turn a living being, into one of them.

I didn't mean the only one. But someone going to tLoAW (which we know is happening) and conversing with the NK who turns out to be a Stark would surely rank fairly high on the memorable events in WoW. One I'd have rather gone into with no preconceptions.

Â 
I'll bet anything, that The Night's King & The Others have a noble purpose and it's the Night's Watch, who exiled him, that are the corrupt.
Â 
I never have, and never will believe, that that Wall was put up as a means of protection. Ill always support it was a means of segregation and to prevent those of the Old Gods to come to power. It keeps the Wildlings at bay (heh, "Wildlings," because they refuse to acknowledge fealty in a corrupt society), as well as whatever the Others are (they're something, let's face it. theyre not mindless undead zombies, they have a purpose, and theyre pissed. theyve been wronged)

Far and away, the best line of the episode! Gave me chills and a grin, from ear to ear.
We need a thread for character's, most regretted line: Mine goes to Rast! "What's a matter, thirsty?" Some how, I believe he will pay for that one!
5474	ohpooratlas	2014-04-27	There were so many good lines.

Tyrion and Jaime's dialogue was gold.

Jaime: "I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."

Tyrion: "Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."

Haha, I missed that one.
Â 
Right after GoT I caught some of Pacific Rim and it turns out Burn Gorman (Karl) plays the dorky German scientist. Completely different character. That guy's a solid actor.
5483	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-27	Bronn: what do you want a kiss?
Â 
Something like that.
5484	Lady Lurksalot	2014-04-28	It's not a line, but, Jaime telling Brienne he has another gift for her, and next we get Pod's grinning face, splendid in it's dorky- ness. Priceless.
5485	greywindsrage	2014-04-28	I liked "Are you asking me if I killed your son??"

5486	greywindsrage	2014-04-28	When Littlefinger said his new friendship was Growing Strong.


Â 

Real sly way of revealing the Tyrells as his partners.
Â
5487	Sackofwetmice	2014-04-28	"Goodbye, Brienne."
Â 
One of the best delivered lines in this entire series. Really blown away by NCW's acting, as well as the actress who plays Brienne.
Â 
It's amazing how strikingly different the show is when you bring together a good director, and good actors. Contrast that with the usual Shae crap, for example.
5488	greywindsrage	2014-04-28	Jaime to Cersei - " I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told her to fuck off ? "

5491	Darkbringer	2014-04-28	Also, kudos to Olenna's "But I do know" 


Also the way she played with Marge's necklace while she did so. Brilliant.
5492	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-28	The only line I liked on Dany's side was Grey Worm saying his name.
Â 
- Ser Pounce?
- Ser?.. m'Lady
5493	Mr Smith	2014-04-28	Jon's whole speech about bringing justice to the mutineers.

5499	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	There were quite a few great lines as usual (a lot I can't remember at the moment), but I liked Aiden's delivery on:
Â 
Sansa: "And what do you want?"
LF: "Everything."
5500	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-28	Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with Mercy. Barristan i feel you. Your wise council will only fall on deaf and ignorant ears.Â

5502	Pepi	2014-04-28	Funny, how the the title of this topic implies that the best lines "weren't found" in this episode.
5503	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	Karl: You look like a fucking ball sack.
5504	Queen of Whores	2014-04-28	Karl's entire monologue was amazing. So darkly hilarious. He's such an over-the-top villain I can't help but love him.
5505	Heir to Winterfell	2014-04-28	Bronn referring to Joff as "the little twat"

And to Joff's own father at that!  Bronn doesn't know it for a certainty but at least has a suspicion like everyone else in the 7K.
5506	AZAXD	2014-04-28	NOT
YET
ANYWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Also Bronn's talk to Jamie about fighting for Tyrion at the Eyrie. Was quite touching and is another reason why Jamie and Bronn hanging out is great!

Â 
It was so macabre, wasn't it? I loved the sentimentality behind "Gin Alley" Karl; drinking from Jeor's skull and keeping a direwolf caged as trophies of his "victories". Then threatening to fight Rast because of the supposed renowned fighter he once was.
5508	Valerius	2014-04-28	Nobody thought Bronn pulling off Jamie's hand and smacking him with it was comedy gold? I thought it was hilarious. It reminded of when my older brother would take my hand and start hit myself with it, "Why are you hitting yourself, eh? Why are you hitting yourself?"
5509	Maester Hodor	2014-04-28	Jaime: Do you talk to my brother this way?
Bronn: All the time. He got used to it.

5511	cybobbie	2014-04-28	The whole scene between Jamie and Tyrion had great lines and was one of my favorites. Of course there were other great lines all over the episode since we had the Queen of Thorns and Bronn in it.

5513	The Amethyst Empress	2014-04-28	"Ser?My Lady"
I've been waiting for this
5514	The Fourth Head	2014-04-28	Jon: "Stabbed in the back by COWARDS!" and said with such venom too.
Â 
I loved the "father" comparison with Jeor. Someone's using Jeor as a way of exorcising some demons over Ned. Great writing. Totally got it.
5515	Arkash	2014-04-28	Locke's : "Chose the Wall over losing my hand."Â
5516	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-28	Locke's : "Chose the Wall over losing my hand."Â 


Â 
This. Gave me a good chuckle. That man is awesome.
Â 
Aside from Locke, the Tyrion-Jaime scene was pretty funny, and who could forget Pod.
5517	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-28	Jon: "Stabbed in the back by COWARDS!" and said with such venom too.

Â 
With Slynt the backstabbing coward right behind him as well. Was so great 
Â 
I have to say that while I thought the Craster's scene went on too long, Karl going on about how much of a legend he used to be was great. I think we all know someone who's a little too hung up on what they used to be, and that opinion of themselves gets continually inflated. Hearing the "I was a fucking legend..." Stuff was oddly reminiscent of some conversations I've had/heard in real life.
5518	gmavridis	2014-04-28	I liked "Are you asking me if I killed your son??"
"Are you asking me if I'd kill my brother??"

Just like TV Bronn would answer !!!!
5526	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-28	"not yet anyway" 


Â 
no doubt, best line of the season (until now) by far
5527	Summerfell	2014-04-28	When Grey Worm popped in and said "Valar Morghulis" and it actually worked in the conversation. Obviously not a new line but I loved how it was used there. Â Actually I was really impressed by everything the Grey Worm guy did this episode.
5528	Lady Arwen	2014-04-28	When Grey Worm popped in and said "Valar Morghulis" and it actually worked in the conversation. Obviously not a new line but I loved how it was used there. Â Actually I was really impressed by everything the Grey Worm guy did this episode.


I totally agree with you! All of Grey Worm's dialogue was very nicely delivered, and the actor is doing a marvelous job with the Valyrian language.Â
5529	KingOfTheRock	2014-04-28	QOT was awesome!
Â 
"Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then."
Â 
"Oh, I was veryÂ good."
5530	Summerfell	2014-04-28	I totally agree with you! All of Grey Worm's dialogue was very nicely delivered, and the actor is doing a marvelous job with the Valyrian language.Â 


Yeah, up to this point I was never super impressed by any of the Valyrian delivery, but in that opening scene when he's going back and forth between English and Valyrian, the Valyrian flowed much more smoothly. I was very convinced.Â
5531	Inv1ctus	2014-04-28	Tyrion: "The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it."Â
5532	HomeGrownCrown	2014-04-28	"Kill the guards and sneak you out of the city in a cask?"
5533	Summerfell	2014-04-28	Tyrion: "The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it."Â 


I like it, too.
Â 
Also, I forget the exact wording, but when Olenna says something about how tedious it would be to go on one more leisurely walk in the gardens, I was like, yes, you understand how I feel as a viewer now.
5534	rocksniffer	2014-04-29	Nobody thought Bronn pulling off Jamie's hand and smacking him with it was comedy gold? I thought it was hilarious.

i also thought this was a great bit...just what i would expect Bronn to do...
Â 


Tyrion: "The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it."Â

5535	Kenyatta	2014-04-29	There were quite a few great lines as usual (a lot I can't remember at the moment), but I liked Aiden's delivery on:
Â 
Sansa: "And what do you want?"

This line reminded me of the line from Scarface:
Â 
Manny: "What do you want Tony?"
Tony: "The world chico, and everything in it."
Â 
Â 
I liked Bronn's line: "You gonna fight for him now?"
Â 
Also liked Tyrion's: "The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it." I just hope this doesn't replace: "Look at us. Handless and Noseless, the Lannister boys." I absolutely loved that line, and I loved that scene and I pray that we weren't just robbed of that.

5543	Treekid	2014-04-29	The thing Chett (is it?) says to Hodor about his size, "with that size, I'll be king" or something along the line.

I love all the possibility implied. The forashadowing if there's any
Â 
Not that I think Hodor will be king but if Bran wargs into him more often he could be an enormous asset in combat. And we still don't know who Hodor is.

I also liked Bronn's honesty to Jaime, especially when he called Joffrey a twat to his face. Â And pretty much everything Tyrion said. Â The dialogue was spot on between Jaime and Tyrion.
5548	Ghost wind	2014-04-29	Not exactly lines but a couple of reactions.. Tommen when Margaery climbed into his bed and he was like: "OMG what is she going to do??" And also when QoT told Marg about killing Joffrey.. Her face: priceless..

Â Possibly, but I think they made Danaerys 18 in the show, just so they could show that type of scene. She was like 14 in the books, when they started. So maybe Tommen's scenes will always be PG 13?

Â  I don't know the specifics of the underage acting laws, but they are filming outside of the U.S. so that may change things slightly. My guess is that the producers of the show will be even more conservative than what the laws technically allow. We won't see nudity in a minor, and I highly doubt we will even see a scene of simulated sex with someone mounted above him with moves. [but that does seem like it would be a great pick up line in a bar: "mind if I mount myself above you with some moves?"] lol.

5573	averde	2014-04-27	I doubt it. D&D love Theon and his story and fArya is apart of that story. I don't see it being a problem just to introduce some girl as fArya at Ramsays wedding even.

"Sorry Lord Bolton, i couldnt find Bran or Rickon. i did find this wild black haired girl. got to be Arya!"
5581	north of the wall	2014-04-28	I assumed fArya must be cut coz Jaime is meant to tell Brienne about the plot before giving her oathkeeper. But now that I think about it of course they can change the timing. Why not they have with most stuff.
I'll be pretty disappointed if its not included but I'll get over it. Usually takes me 24 hrs before I accept the changes in the tv show and then I'm happy again
5582	Hath4	2014-04-28	It is too early for her. They can introduce her next year when the boltons arrive in winterfell. She is not needed until the wedding.
5583	Chebyshov	2014-04-28	I'm sure she'll still be included. I think once Locke comes back having failed to kill Jon or deliver Bran, but tells them Bran's north of the wall, they'll come up with the FAyra plan.
5584	Lord Damian	2014-04-28	Locke I bet gets killed by Ghost when he tries to kill Jon in the back or even Bran. Locke will not return.
5585	ToTheWolves	2014-04-28	You guys are right. It is too early I was thrown off because brienne and Jamie are in kings landing so early and she left to go look for sansa yesterday which is feast material.
5586	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	Casting problems if they added another character now. Fake Arya will be in Season 5's cast alongside Quentyn, Arianne, Doran etc
5587	Gendels Children	2014-04-28	I think/hope they will keep that story line in there, its some pretty tasty materialÂ
5588	toffeejay	2014-04-28	I reckon Meera or more likely Gilly will be used over Jayne Poole. I can't see them trying to bring in a new character for that role. They'll want some one who the audience knows to add to the emotion of it.

Â
5589	lessassin	2014-04-28	there's still a long way to go for Ramsay before he gets to winterfell, is too early, and there's no need to tell Brienne about fake Arya, 'cause they got ahead in the king's landing storyline, but to be honest, any girl can be her, it's well stablished that Theon will do wathever Ramsay say, and all that he needs for her to be consider real, is Theon's autentification. Â
5590	Longspear Ryk	2014-04-28	I reckon Meera or more likely Gilly will be used over Jayne Poole. I can't see them trying to bring in a new character for that role. They'll want some one who the audience knows to add to the emotion of it.
Â 


 
Â 
i doubt they would do that, they would almost certainly just cast a new character.Â
5591	acosta	2014-04-28	Gilly is a lot older and blonde and Jeyne Poole was already in season one. She was never named, but she was shown, and Ned mentions her father. If they keep the storyline at all, it has to still be someone with knowledge of Winterfell who can answer any questions the other northerners ask.Â
5592	Martin Lasarte	2014-04-28	What if Yara/Asha takes fArya's place? They could marry her to Ramsay so that the Boltons have a claim over the Iron Islands, and Theon could rescue her.

5593	King Zee	2014-04-28	its odd how people are so determined that Â Fake Arya must be an already existing character. Yara, Meera, Ramsey's girlfiend, its a good thing Ros isnt Â alive or Â people would still be trying to stick her in that role.

They could have said that about Jeyne also (wrong eyes). The Northern Lords are biding their time. They all know it's a sham.
5596	Envie	2014-04-29	I too disagree with all the wild theories of which character will be used as the fake Arya. None of them fit or would willingly pass it off (Meera or Yara would probably fight). It's got to be somebody else - maybe that mysterious chick who's now Ramsay's sidekick? She's small and dark haired and doesn't talk like a commoner plus she's completely in Ramsay's power.

5598	BurDoc725	2014-04-23	So the plot summary for episode 4 states that Bran and the gang will "stumble on shelter". Could this mean we're going to see the CoTF already? I know it's a tad early, but what else could they do with that storyline? D&D can milk Bran's visions for all they're worth once he meets Bloodraven. I suspect this is how the audience will eventually find out about Jon's lineage.
Â 
My only reservation is that the last episode of Season 4 is called "Children," which could also imply the CoTF introduction. What do you guys think?
5599	iheartseverus	2014-04-23	(Cripes, i feel a bit giddy that these finally opened!Â  At last, we can get past that scene, whew.)
Â 
My sense is that this year, episode 10 is going to be the 'yowser' scene, rather than episode 9 as before.Â  Jaime (the children) will confess to Tyrion the real history of Tysha, a soul-crusher for Tyrion, for sure.Â  Tyrion(the children)/Shae/Tywin/whang!Â  I think it will also be the episode when Dany chains her 'children.'Â

I wonder if they'll meet? I doubt it, but a farewell scene is a definite possibility, sort of like Aragorn letting Frodo go ahead on his quest. With Book-Bran's age, that'd be absurd, but with Show-Bran's age - and the fact that he now looks about six months younger than Jon, and is probably taller! - it wouldn't seem entirely ridiculous.
5603	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^Hehehhe, you're right, he probably is taller! Kit is no tall man.
5604	Obebb	2014-04-24	I'm not too sure what to except I just know I absolutely can't wait. I'm hoping for Craster's, but it just seems unlikely since Jon is going there eventually.
5605	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-24	Thankfully Bran has dead legs, so he wouldn't have to tower over him if that were the case, haha.
Â 
I dunno, I still don't think Jon would just let him go off into the wild like that - especially when you consider a massive wildling army and WW infestation could catch and kill him without hesitation. I suppose nowhere is really safe for Bran at the moment, but I'd think Jon would want him under his own protection.

5607	Usurper's Dog	2014-04-24	Rather than Bran reaching the Children in the 4th episode and rushing through his ADWD material, I think it's more likely this "shelter" refers to where Bran and co. rest in an abandoned wildling longhall during a storm. If I recall correctly Bran has more warg dreams where he encounters the dead nights watchmen mutineers that were killed by Coldhands, followed by Bran's accusation of him being a "monster who cannot pass below the wall". CH may potentially show up this episode, save them from the mutineers and lead them to the shelter - or, like in the book, Bran finds it through Summer.
5608	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-24	Sam didn't feel the same way about Gilly and Little Sam, so who knows lol.


Â 
I think that's more of a case of Sam trying to protect Gilly from his own brothers, considering the scene right before their talk was Thorne and Slynt inspecting the new recruits: Raper, raper, thief, thief and raper...
Â 
But yeah,Â considering they know about the wildlings to the south it was a little irrational, and I think jealousy played a hand in it.
5609	lostinasia	2014-04-24	I'm probably not the first to suggest this: Jon wants to launch an expedition to Craster's Keep - and Thorne doesn't seem very supportive. Could Locke's sudden arrival provide the men Jon needs? Locke could pretend to work with Jon in order to gain his trust, hoping to Mandon Moore him if the opportunity arises.
5610	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-24	I was just thinking... Ghost is still wandering around north of The Wall. Could we see him make an appearance and this time save Bran?
5611	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^If not then, I presume Jon will reunite with Ghost when he goes on his ranging.
5612	Arkash	2014-04-24	We know from the preview that Karl and the mutineers will appear in episode 4 but Jon's raid is in episode 5. So Bran and co will most likely stumble at Craster's.
5613	King Tommen	2014-04-24	I don't think the WW appearance is in a vision, I think it's an actual appearance and it either is an encounter with Bran and crew that chases them into Crasters or they might play out the baby sacrificing bit at Craster's with Rast leaving the baby for the WW.
Â 
In any case, Bran's on a collision course with the mutineers.

But if it were, I think in order to fit the description of 'violent and disgusting' the WW would likely have to do something to the baby--eat it, tear it apart, whatever.Â  And that would give away the info about what the WWs actually do with all the baby boys they've taken.Â  And up to where we are in the books so far, we still don't know what the WWs do with the baby boys, do we?

I think the disgusting scene is something at Craster's but that baby being taken by WW if it's POV shot is gonna be seriously chilling.

I understand he'a a gentle giant, but i'd like to Bran to warg into him again and go all Incredible Hulk on someone.
Â 
With regards to Locke, the way they set him up in episode 2, suggested he was going after Bran and Rickon. I got that they started talking about Jon Snow, but they only assumed he might be hiding them at the Wall, so for Locke to act like a spy seems a bit weird, unless he doesn't expect the Night's Watch to believe he's a Stark loyalist.
5620	King Tommen	2014-04-24	Locke wouldn't even consider the notion that Bran and Rickon would be beyond the Wall (why would anyone think that's where they would go?). The belief is that if Jon's not harboring them at Castle Black, he would know where they went to keep them safe.Â  So Locke infiltrating the NW in order to get info from Jon would most likely be the plan. They don't have any other leads about where Bran and Rickon went. Jon is the play which is why Locke will spend significant time there, in order to try and get that info from him.

Jon is the play which is why Locke will spend significant time there, in order to try and get that info from him.


I'll be mildly surprised if we see Locke actually pretending to join the NW - I assume he'll just show up as a visitor, perhaps as an emissary of the new ruler of the North to check up on how the Wall's going and to "offer help". And him joining Jon on the expedition to Craster's would be a good way to gain Jon's trust, with the main goal of finding information about Bran and Rickon, and the additional option of killing Jon himself if the opportunity arises - that doesn't seem to be part of any plan, but I assume the Boltons wouldn't be annoyed.
Â 
But I'm not sure how they'd play Locke as a Bolton flunkey with whatever Jon knows of the Red Wedding details.
Â 
If we'd heard anything about Osha's and Rickon's actors being back this year, I'd assume that Locke would somehow interact with them, but since there's been no news on them (has there?), that's probably not going to happen.
5622	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-25	Â

Â I don't think that Bran and Co, would be put up against deserters of the NW with out Coldhands to defend them. In the book they found a cave and shared a meal with a guy Bran thought was a "Liddle", I goof on the name, but the point was it was too late for that meeting.

Â 
I don't think Bran and co are going to fight the NW mutineers, it sounds like they're going to just stumble upon Craster's when looking for shelter (possibly after a WW encounter). They won't really know what they've got themselves into until it's too late.
5625	Northbound2.0	2014-04-25	Sorry, but Bran and company taking shelter/being capturedÂ at Craster's makes zero sense. Unless Summer, Meera and Hodor are going to kill all the baddie NW guys, it is not logical.
Â 
Rast: "Hello, that is a cool direwolf you got there. One of my former brothers of the NW had a white one; that sat on my chest one day and looked to want to chew my throat out! His owner is half Stark and I can't stand his ass. I recall he had brothers and sisters who had direwolves as well! What to come in out of the cold and have a bite to eat....perhaps a warm bed?"

Obviously the nature of the location can't be definitively ascertained, but that sure looks like it could be Craster's Keep to me.

Â 
If he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a Liddle, then what was he?
Â 
Only once did they encounter any of the mountain people, when a sudden burst of freezing rain sent them looking for shelter. Summer found it for them, sniffing out a shallow cave behind the grey-green branches of a towering sentinel tree, but when Hodor ducked beneath the stony overhang, Bran saw the orange glow of fire far ther back and realized they were not alone.Â 
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Come in and warm yourselves,â<U+0080><U+009D> a manâ<U+0080><U+0099>s voice called out. â<U+0080><U+009C>Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stone enough to keep the rain off all our heads.â<U+0080><U+009D> He offered them oatcakes and blood sausage and a swallow of ale from a skin he carried, but never his name; nor did he ask theirs. Bran figured him for a Liddle. The clasp that fastened his squirrelskin cloak was gold and bronze and wrought in the shape of a pinecone, and the Liddles bore pinecones on the white half of their green-and-white shields. 
Â

That's great!Â  If we see Osha, we'll see Rickon.Â  Tis the season of the two little boys that many viewers don't even remember--Tommen and Rickon.
5631	King Tommen	2014-04-25	In watching that interview, the only thing that touches on S4 is when the interviewer asks "What are you up to in this season?" and she answers "Well, we can't talk about anything that happens...".
Â 
You could take that either way but there's been absolutely nothing to indicate her or Art Parkinson were involved in the filming for S4, it would have had to be very hush, hush if that were the case.
Â 
Regardless, seeing Osha and Rickon would be very cool, I hope it happens. I'm just not holding my breath at this point.

Is there enough time for that? Or did the Night's Watch somehow get a hold of Littlefinger's pocket transporter?

There is no separate Wildling attack from the South. The 2 attacks happen concurrently in E9 so Jon and crew will have plenty of time to get back from Craster's and prepare.

Seems pretty simple to me as well from the synopsis (paraphrasing but something about Jon's advice about holding the Wall falling on deaf ears) .. Thorne will likely rally a defense of CB against Styr/Ygritte and Co. (from season trailer "Brothers.. tonight we fight" etc..) whilst the wall is breached .. Will probably miss out on some of the cool visuals from ASoS namely from the first successful defense of the Wall but I won't lose much sleep over it..

I'll bet a million internet dollars that the shot in the trailers of the WW riding the horse coming out of the snow that people kept referring to as Coldhands will be shown here to be the one to claim the sacrificed Craster baby.
Â 
Jon's attack on the keep will be in E5 and will probably inadvertently provide the distraction for Bran to escape without them actually crossing paths.Â  There are scenes with Jon fighting Karl inside the keep which will take place here.

5644	ejhawman	2014-04-27	Offhand, I'd favor episode 10 for the COTF intro. Puts it off, but not too long, and the title fits - there will be MANY converging meanings around then.
5645	go joff go	2014-04-27	I wonder what the ending of this episode will be. Â My guess is John and crew riding towards crasters. I can't think of an obvious ending tbh.
5646	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-27	Rather than Bran reaching the Children in the 4th episode and rushing through his ADWD material, I think it's more likely this "shelter" refers to where Bran and co. rest in an abandoned wildling longhall during a storm. If I recall correctly Bran has more warg dreams where he encounters the dead nights watchmen mutineers that were killed by Coldhands, followed by Bran's accusation of him being a "monster who cannot pass below the wall". CH may potentially show up this episode, save them from the mutineers and lead them to the shelter - or, like in the book, Bran finds it through Summer.


Â 
I hope you're right about this, except for the CH part (he won't be appearing in the show).
Â 
Are we the only two that don't want Bran to go to Craster's? Someone else mentioned above, it would be very ridiculous and out of character for Bran and company - they consistently want to stay away from people for fear of being seen -- and if the mutineers are living there (which they are) wouldn't they be burning fires or showing some sign of life? They don't have to worry about a WW attack, I reckon, so why not?
Â 
But I am sure that they will end up there, making zero sense and diverging from the story once more...

Â 
Something tells me them ending up at Craster's isn't going to be by choice. There may be a WW encounter that kind of forces them there.
5648	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-27	I agree with you there, for the reasons I stated in my previous post about signs of life.
Â 
I hadn't heard the bit about something shocking or whatever, in this episode with regards to the Bran story line. Is that true?
Â 
Hmm... yeah, WW attack is the most logical choice by far.
5649	BlueDragon	2014-04-27	I wish people would post links to video which establishes this theory. Â What are you guys seeing in the promo for tonight that looks like Craster's? Â It makes no sense for them to get embroiled there. Â Bran finding shelter could mean practically anything.

Â 

There were some photos posted of stills from the episode this week. I think since the structure seems to be wood, most people are linking it to Craster's -- a keep that looks similar on the inside to what little is seen in the photos.
Â 
You're right about it meaning anything... but people draw their own conclusions, and from the casting information the ex-Watch men at Craster's will appear in this episode.

Â 
The preview shows Karl at Craster's. We know Jon's not going there yet (that's next episode). There's no reason for them to have scenes there unless they're going to have one of the main storylines go through there like Bran, Sam or Jon's. The synopsis says Bran and co "stumble on shelter" and they should be pretty damn close to Craster's based on them just recently going north of the Wall.
Â 
Bran getting captured and being at Craster's when Jon attacks there was leaked by an extra on Reddit back in the Fall which is not a 100% legit source but based on the fact that no one even knew about Jon going to Craster's at that point, I would say the storyline appears to be playing out exactly as they described.
Â 
And then there's this picture from the episode tonight that HBO released. If that's not inside Craster's, then it's a great facsimile.

I can appreciate the sentiment but they have already burned through Arya and Bran's material from A Storm of Swords.Â  Absent having them disappear for the rest of the season, they are in somewhat of a bind.

They met up with Sam and Gilly in one of the deserted castles at the end of season 3.Â  Osha wanted them all to go to Castle Black, but Bran insisted they had to find the three-eyed crow, which is the point at which Rickon and Osha went off on their own.

Â 
After all, if Jon came across Bran and found out he wanted to venture farther North, what would Jon do?
Â 
He'd say "Oh, no, you're not!" and take Bran back to Castle Black.

Oh, I mean I'm fine with the change, and I don't mind the character development on the way (also setting up Jon to become LC because people are willing to follow him). I just meant that if we're getting CH, they would have shown Bran & Co. nearing the keep, shown what was going on inside, and then I guess have CH turn up and save Bran once they get captured (still a change from the book, but it would have been a cool introduction to CH). But they found a way to have the mutineers taken care of without CH, so I'm assuming he's been cut.

Really looking forward to Jon and Ghost reuniting. They're my OTP.

Â 
If Bran was to tell Jon what he's on about, Jon might choose duty over love and let him go in his not so merry way. However, we have Locke going there and he's likely to interfere in any family meeting.
Â 
Good point about Bran warging Hodor, though. The mutineers wouldn't expect Hodor to put up a fight. He's injured and chained, though.

5673	Petyr Patter	2014-04-29	Another thought occurs to me.
Â 
Craster's Keep has not been a part of the books since Sam fled them.Â  We just had Martin release in Arya chapter before a highly similar scene in the show, albeit under different timing.
Â 
Could Bran and the Reeds be experiencing a "Winds of Winter" plot line not yet published?
5674	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-29	Could Bran and the Reeds be experiencing a "Winds of Winter" plot line not yet published?


Â I don't see how, the story has gone far beyond that.Â Bran and Co, some of the former NW, are/were far to the north of Craster's place, and BranÂ would have to leave CoTF and go thru a lot to even getting back there.
5675	ovis alba	2014-04-29	The only reason i think this was the scene when they were picking on Hodor and said if I was your size I would rule the world


Â 
That was exactly my thought. I somehow have the feeling Bran and Jon will "miss" each other just like all the other Starks do all the time. It would just be quiet a stretch if they would meet and Bran could tell Jon all about the warging, the dreams etc. Also Locke meeting Bran would sort of mess up the whole dynamics?!
Â 
And then the main question is: how do they get out without Jon and his brothers and the Hodor scene to me might hint to some more warging of him (maybe he's going to free Ghost while that, who is also good for some "damage"  )
5676	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	I really really want coldhands.
5677	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	Something said by Cogman re: this episode struck me as peculiar:
Â 
"the idea was to put Bran, Hodor, Jojen and Meera into a really dangerous situation beyond the Wall that didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t involve the supernatural, but rather humanity at its worst."
Â 
The fact that he would spell this out sort of makes me think the wights are still going to be there. That they are hoping to portray the threats that are both natural and supernatural, and to instantly have the Winter Wonderland with Santa Coldhands riding his antlered friend bailing them out of trouble might downplay the very relatable, very human dangers that remain there.
5678	Pinky Baelish	2014-04-29	i really hope bran will warg into hodor at night, break those chains (just like in the sigil of house umber) and free both direwolves. although i would love to see hodor go berserk and smash some of these mutineering rapists into pieces, it would make more sense if they just stuck to their usual ways and sneaked off into the dark. when jon and company arrive, bran could assist them by warging into summer and mauling rast and his buddies anyway.

Tywin/Tyrion scene
Dany imprisoning her dragons
Lady Stoneheart reveal as the last shot
____________________________________
EDIT: This long ass theory-session, I'm bored in class.
As for the Bran & Co. stuck in Uncle Craster's Keep of Creeps and Cranium-Drinkers, I see Jon arriving with his company and killing the mutineers. Hodor will extract vengeance on Ollo Lophand and scream "HODOR", as he uses his corpse as a warhammer against the rest of the mutineers. Okay, probably not, but I wouldn't mind if Hodor got some revenge for the whole "chain-to-a-post-and-stab-the-nice-guy" bit. What douches. A scene I am looking forward to, and I hope will happen, will be the one where Jon and Locke go ahead of the party (to scout) and get Ghost and save Summer. I think they could have a nice climax right here, whether it be Locke revealing his plans and Ghost executing him Bran-assassin style, or just some clever character building from the writers. I can't really imagine Jon's reaction to Jeor's Skull being used as a cup, as I could see Dirk using it as somewhat of a taunt in the battle.Â 
Also, to the people who say that Jon/Bran meet-up will change everything, I am pretty skeptical about if they will actually meet one-another. I could see all the attention being stolen when Jon & Co. show up to avenge their fallen brothers, and Bran & Co. sneaking out. Also, a lot of people have theory-crafted that Bran will warg into the mind of Ghost/Summer, but I think him skinchanging into Hodor may be introduced. Everything is up for grabs at this point; after the final scene in S0E404, nothing introduced later in the books is safe.

5683	Little and Less	2014-04-29	I've wondered that myself...you would think the 3EC would intervene somehow, like free the direwolves?Â  Or introduce Coldhands into the picture?

Â 
I thought that might have happened last episode, but now that Bran told them his name, I think it's sealing the deal that Jon's going to be the one to get them out of this mess (probably aided by Bran warging).
5685	John Suburbs	2014-04-29	I'm having a hard time seeing Jon make to Craster's, finding Bran,Â and then just letting him continue on his way north.
Â 
As well, we still need John to be back a the wall before the wildlings attack from the south. Otherwise, they have to skip the entire scene with Ygritte with an arrow through her chest saying "you know nothing, Jon Snow."
5686	Envie	2014-04-29	i really hope bran will warg into hodor at night, break those chains (just like in the sigil of house umber) and free both direwolves. although i would love to see hodor go berserk and smash some of these mutineering rapists into pieces, it would make more sense if they just stuck to their usual ways and sneaked off into the dark. when jon and company arrive, bran could assist them by warging into summer and mauling rast and his buddies anyway.


Â 
Yeah - you know ... when they showed poor Hodor in chains being taunted / stabbed by those a**holes, I really hoped Bran would start warging into him to save him and have him attack them / kill a few. This could also help defend his position when Meera and Jojen are scandalized by the fact he's warging into Hodor which goes against the 'laws' of warging. It's taboo to warg into another human without destroying the human or the warg or both. We get a lot of that information from the Varamyr Sixskins story which they are probably leaving out entirely. So having Jojen and Meera confront Bran about how 'wrong' it is to warg into another person would make sense and he'd need to defend himself because he was trying to save Hodor.

Â 
I think if he did that, Hodor would end up dead. He has no armor, and Bran doesn't have much skill at arms. And there are a number of brothers at Craster's, some of whom have bows and crossbows.

Â 
This is true too... unless Hodor's 'giant blood' comes out and he's suddenly able to break his chains and deflect arrows / swords - he's going to have trouble (even with someone in the driver's seat) taking out many of those jerks. Maybe it happens when the poo hits the fan during the battle with Jon and this is how Hodor gets them all out of there (frees the direwolves, busts down doors to get Bran and Jojen and Meera freed, etc) .... I just wanna see Hodor go Incredible Hulk mode!Â

5690	High-born Plumber	2014-04-29	I wonder how Maester Luwin would feel about Bran rollin' north of the wall etc...after he'd told Bran his dreams didnt mean anything?
  : )
5691	Obebb	2014-04-29	While the idea of a hulk Hodor busting Bran and co out of Craster's is fun, it would be completely unacceptable if Meera played no part in the escape
5692	John Suburbs	2014-04-29	I'm still holding out hope that in the end it will be Bran wielding Dark Sister through Hodor, and riding a dragon.
5693	lostinasia	2014-04-30	It would make sense for Bran to warg into a mutineer and release the dire wolves.


I'm wondering about this as well. In "Oathkeeper", Rast's weakness was emphasized again and again - could there be a scene where Jojen explains to Bran that he can warg into someone of weak will, and Bran fixes on Rast? ThatÂ may be too big a jump after last season's brief warging into Hodor, but maybe it'd work and also show how Bran's powers are growing fast.
5694	King Tam Stark	2014-04-30	For the final episode I'm guessing:
Tywin/Tyrion scene
Dany imprisoning her dragons
Lady Stoneheart reveal as the last shot
____________________________________
EDIT: This long ass theory-session, I'm bored in class.
As for the Bran & Co. stuck in Uncle Craster's Keep of Creeps and Cranium-Drinkers, I see Jon arriving with his company and killing the mutineers. Hodor will extract vengeance on Ollo Lophand and scream "HODOR", as he uses his corpse as a warhammer against the rest of the mutineers. Okay, probably not, but I wouldn't mind if Hodor got some revenge for the whole "chain-to-a-post-and-stab-the-nice-guy" bit. What douches. A scene I am looking forward to, and I hope will happen, will be the one where Jon and Locke go ahead of the party (to scout) and get Ghost and save Summer. I think they could have a nice climax right here, whether it be Locke revealing his plans and Ghost executing him Bran-assassin style, or just some clever character building from the writers. I can't really imagine Jon's reaction to Jeor's Skull being used as a cup, as I could see Dirk using it as somewhat of a taunt in the battle.Â 
Also, to the people who say that Jon/Bran meet-up will change everything, I am pretty skeptical about if they will actually meet one-another. I could see all the attention being stolen when Jon & Co. show up to avenge their fallen brothers, and Bran & Co. sneaking out. Also, a lot of people have theory-crafted that Bran will warg into the mind of Ghost/Summer, but I think him skinchanging into Hodor may be introduced. Everything is up for grabs at this point; after the final scene in S0E404, nothing introduced later in the books is safe.


He's already done it.
Â 


Â 
Yeah - you know ... when they showed poor Hodor in chains being taunted / stabbed by those a**holes, I really hoped Bran would start warging into him to save him and have him attack them / kill a few.

So having Jojen and Meera confront Bran about how 'wrong' it is to warg into another person would make sense and he'd need to defend himself because he was trying to save Hodor.


Where they scandalised when he done it previously when they where in danger?
Â 
I can see Bran warging Hodor killing maybe a couple of guards probably late at night releasing the Direwolves and escaping then Ghost going off to find Jon to lead them to Crasters and finish the job and it's Ghost that then saves Jon from Locke.
5695	Jess Bishop	2014-04-30	For some reason this revised storyline really bothers me.  On one hand I'm glad Jon knows Bran is alive and that they may meet again; on the other seeing Ghost locked up was a far cry from the storyline in the books and slightly hard to watch.
5696	Cabeld of Casterly Rock	2014-04-30	Coldhands is a possibility, because (correct me if I am wrong) isn't he expecting Bran & Co. to venture beyond the wall? Bran witnesses him killing Night's Watch men (in our case, perhaps the Mutineers?) and sees he is a wight. So, maybe we get a Coldhands rescue, Jon & Co. arrive to find everyone dead (Jon gets revenge on Dirk â<U+0080><U+0094> Bolton style. Or just Stark style. The point is, they made him so much more unlikable â<U+0080><U+0094> unfortunately less complex, but TV-viewers need a standin.Joffrey â<U+0080><U+0094> in the show.)Â 
EDIT: Typed up above yesterday â<U+0080><U+0094> Theories = Extended@KingTamStark totally forgot about that. So, it won't seem as ridiculous when TV viewers see it.
Having Ghost locked up: 
1. Provides an explanation for viewers on where he has been
2. Allows for a nice sequence in the next episode.
Obviously, the writers have a good idea on where to go next with the show, (off-topic note: despite all the hate this season on D&D, this season has been pretty damn good.) and I trust them with the plans they have.Â 
The only really positive thing coming out of a huge plot change like this would be saving TV-viewers from spoilers and surprising readers. Whether it somehow finds itself back in the book-plot, or it takes a detour and establishes a new story arc, I think it will be really damn good. [Hype Intensifies]

Â 
Maybe 'scandalized' is a bit heavy word. I do remember in the books that Jojen warned him against warging into people and that most wargs can't even do it - they can drive the other person insane, lose their own mind / connection, or it's too hard to control. The only reason he does it easily with Hodor is because Hodor doesn't have much of a mind to control. It's also in the 'code of ethics' as described by Varamyr Sixskins (who also does it in his story and has disastrous results if I recall).Â 
Â 
But yeah, I've been reading some of the preview speculations and it seems like a lot of people are hoping Bran wargs into Hodor to get Summer and Ghost released to start the mayhem / distraction so they can escape.
Â 
Next week's Craster's place fight scene is definitely highly anticipated!
5698	Dany's Silver	2014-04-30	It seems apparent to me that neither Edd nor Grenn knew that the mutineers had captured Ghost, or it would have been mentioned (mind you, given what takes place off screen in this adaptation, I could be wrong!). We could see one of them tell Jon, "Over there us where you'll find Ghost" when theynapproach CK, and then they'll find Summer, too. Since Bran was seen warging Summer with his eyes closed (or while asleep), Bran might reestablish his connection with Summer around about the same time that Jon sees Ghost

ETA: Ghost

5699	Petyr Patter	2014-04-30	Another thought occurs to me.
Â 
Craster's Keep has not been a part of the books since Sam fled them.Â  We just had Martin release in Arya chapter before a highly similar scene in the show, albeit under different timing.
Â 
Could Bran and the Reeds be experiencing a "Winds of Winter" plot line not yet published?


Â 
Â 


Â I don't see how, the story has gone far beyond that.Â Bran and Co, some of the former NW, are/were far to the north of Craster's place, and BranÂ would have to leave CoTF and go thru a lot to even getting back there.


Â 
Well, I am strongly of the opinion they aren't going to stay in that cave forever.Â  And when the leave, they have a long journey regardless, and that journey might take them through Craster's Keep.

I think it's definitely possible remember with the timelines and the last time we heard from Bran & co. they could have already left the cave and started the journey.
5701	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-27	In a show that usually likes gore an unnecesary violence, Daenerys top evil moment feel rushed to me. It seams it was something D&D didnt like to do, but ought to. Unlist to me. What was a huge moment in a book, felt like filler in this episode between Kings Landing and Bran/Jon plot line.
Sadly, Im almost sure the white washing is never going to stop. 
Just compare it with how Stannis or Jaime bad moments are happily taken by D&D to be darker, enlarged, and deeper. Or even how they are given new stuff.
I dont like it at all.

5709	shiola	2014-04-27	I'm not gonna argue whether or not Dany's decision was evil. Â But I will respnd to the OP and say it did not feel rushed to me. Â It felt like it went quickly, and that surprised me, but I think it got its point across. Â Her standing up on the walls watching the slavers scream and die? Â Reminded me of the visual of Roose Bolton after the Red Wedding last season. Â

Plus, they'll probably reference it more next week. Â Looks like she, Jorah, Barristan, and Daario are gonna have a council meeting of sorts.
5710	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-27	To be honest, the crucifying of the 163 masters wasn't near as bad to me as her killing every male over the age of 12 wearing a tokar in Astapor. That omission in particular, and the relatively bloodless manner in which these revolutions occur, (with the exception of the slave owners getting murked) is what makes this whole arc unrealistic and cheapened. Her having the wine seller's daughter tortured out of anger also bothered me, but I have a feeling that'll be cut too. I definitely don't see any end to her whitewashing in sight, but to be honest, this decision in particular was never something that really bothered me all that much in her arc.Â

She's sending a message.
What, you wanted her to haveÂ  an investigation and a trial to find out who was involved? Doesn't matter. They were slave masters and she crucified them in the same way they did to slaves.
Spartacus did the same thing. He got a random roman soldier and crucified him in front of the roman legions. Crucifixion  was punishment for slaves only.

I was coming to say this, the crucifixions were ok, but the sack looked as if nothing bif happened, I know they can't show it for budgetary reasons, but I hope they clarify this next episode (which according to the description, may be the case)

I definitely agree that they're biased in her favor. I know a lot of people think our criticisms of Stannis' portrayal are unfounded, but seriously, they've definitely made a conscious decision to make her triumphs bigger and failures minimized. Whereas Stannis' moral failures are also simplified, but in such a way that makes him darker and cheap. I think that it's not unsubstantial that Barristan, who does seem to serve as a partial moral compass for her, raises objections to these executions though. Could be foreshadowing for her taking a darker turn in the coming episodes I hope.

Â 
And, I guess now it's up to Unsullied to decided. But the show reminded us via Dany that she was doing it because they killed the children. 163 children to be exact. And she's doing the same as retribution. Many might think she's getting as crazy as her father, some other will say "fuck yeah!". The show is showing the Targaryen banner behind her for one reason, and Barristan is already thinking is a bad idea.

One was whitewashed, one omitted entirely. The wine sellers daughter is such a minor scene it will also likely be cut. Still, they can't avoid showing that the consequences of her revolutions aren't all sunshines and rainbows, seeing as her Dance of Dragons arc can't move forward otherwise. I don't have "high hopes" but I'm holding out marginal faith in the showrunners' abilities to give us a little of what we want with Stannis and a little of what they need to show with Dany to make her a full three dimensional character.
5726	Fat Trell	2014-04-27	Bigger issue here is they did not show the Sack of Meereen. It looked like the slaves killed one master and opened the gates. No fires, no looting, no killing, and no rape.
Â 
I don't see how Dany is going to match her storyline from here on out. She doesn't have doubts on the show. She doesn't have moments of weakness.

Is she just going to yell at her court in valyrian for one and a half seasons?

YOU. HOW DARE YOU COME INTO THIS THREAD WITH LOGIC! 
I agree with this. Barristan's face.Â Barristan's face!Â He said more with his expression than he could ever say with words. His face says "Yes. Ive heard this before. Ive heard it from your father's lips."Â 
Hngggn <3Â 
Dany doesÂ notÂ come off looking amazing and rosy here. She looks good on the surface, but Barristan helps us understand the true meaning of this scene.Â 
As for the stuff that came before it, im cool with it too. Its pretty easy to get the idea that the slaves kicked the Masters' asses and captured a bunch of them. The "Kill The Masters" on the wall said more than a lot of gore had to say. This shit was good. Fuck the police. Im excited about Meereen now.Â 


Except that Barristan never thinks it's a bad idea. He's behind her all the way


Please look harder on a rewatch. Hes very visibly not cool with her "Ill answer justice with justice" line.
5729	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-27	Barristan wouldn't raise an alternative if he was behind her decision 100%. Clearly he doesn't think the executions are advantageous, or totally morally just. She's starting to walk down a dangerous path, and he gets it, even if it's hard to feel bad for the assholes she's crucifying.
5730	Lord Damian	2014-04-27	I will be anxious to see the people's opinions on Dany, once they see her sitting a throne in Mereen and putting on her attitude. My family that has not read the books are shocked at how she went from madly in love with Drogo, a slaving you know what and now she is some saint. I just laugh and say it gets worse with no promise of getting better for her, so enjoy.
5731	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-27	^Yep.Â  He's not liking what she has done. As there is no moral discussions in the show like in the books about the subject, Barristan is telling us "this is not right", while Dany is doing it for justice.
Â 
Now, I can't remembe Jorah but I think he wasn't that happy either.
5732	Cinn-a-Bronn	2014-04-27	It's not exactly a secret that the show runners are trying to make this appeal to the widest audience possible. They do that by dumbing the material down and removing a lot of the moral grey areas around popular characters. If they made her look more like the angsty, naive, bloodthirsty Targaryen teenager on a rampage that she actually is then some fans would get confused.Â 
It's also a little bit scary how many people ITT are 100% OK with some pretty extreme cruelty, as long as it's directed toward people they don't like. Like some others have said; they may have cleaned it up a LOT but I don't think you're supposed to walk away from the scene with a glowing opinion of Daenerys.
TL;DR version: 1) dumb people hate thinking 2) ya'll crazy
5733	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-27	Jorah probably didn't like it. He's gotta sell those slaves to somebody.Â

YOU. HOW DARE YOU COME INTO THIS THREAD WITH LOGIC! 
I agree with this. Barristan's face.Â Barristan's face!Â He said more with his expression than he could ever say with words. His face says "Yes. Ive heard this before. Ive heard it from your father's lips."Â 
Hngggn <3Â 
Dany doesÂ notÂ come off looking amazing and rosy here. She looks good on the surface, but Barristan helps us understand the true meaning of this scene.Â 
As for the stuff that came before it, im cool with it too. Its pretty easy to get the idea that the slaves kicked the Masters' asses and captured a bunch of them. The "Kill The Masters" on the wall said more than a lot of gore had to say. This shit was good. Fuck the police. Im excited about Meereen now.Â 
Please look harder on a rewatch. Hes very visibly not cool with her "Ill answer justice with justice" line.

5735	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-27	^Yep.Â  He's not liking what she has done. As there is no moral discussions in the show like in the books about the subject, Barristan is telling us "this is not right", while Dany is doing it for justice.
Â 
Now, I can't remembe Jorah but I think he wasn't that happy either.


Oddly enough, they're giving Dany the kinds of scenes I wish we were getting from Stannis. Instead of Davos, we get Barristan disapproving of her actions, but seeing that there are legitimate reasons for them. Whether it was just of Stannis to burn Alester for trying to sell his daughter to the Lannisters isn't one that's easily answered, nor is this decision to crucify 163 of the masters without a trial or investigation as to who bears the most responsibility for the murder of the young slaves. I just wish the nuance was more consistent across character arcs.Â

Yeah, that I get. but I guess in the show they have to show things more obviously because there are no inner dialogues. I'm sure many Unsullied think this is another moment of awesome for her, like "Dracarys". I personally don't dislike her for what she did, but I can see why many others think it's wrong. This debate must be taken to screen somehow and showing one of her main supporters having doubts, specially the supporter that knew her father, proves that what she thinks is justice, might be nothing but revenge.

Â 
Yes, Barristan is Dany's Davos now, her "good angel". I kinda almost write that example .
Â 
With Dany, I guess they're only trying to show us both sides of the story. We often complain about not having an "Essos POV" about her, and now we have it: the slavers are more than grateful that she free them and kill their abusers, so, her actions are shown "good" to their eyes. Barristan, a man with more experience in both battle and life, realises that she has a simplistic definition of revenge: eye for an eye, and that caused her father to be called "mad King"
Â 
Stannis is different because although he's relative young, he's a more seasoned warrior and man. He knows what he's doing might be wrong, but he explicitly says "I have to suffer it for the greater good". So, there isn't really much space for Davos to try to convince him to do something different because Stannis knows that he can only take the "bad" path now. But in the same way, Stannis, I guess, will be shown through the eyes of those he's gonna help, the NW and Jon Snow.

Â 
I agree that for us it's not justice but for the slaves, it was.
Â 
For example, if you're been robbed and someone arrives and shoots the robber, you will feel forever thankful because it caused a direct benefit for you, and probably saved your life. For the slaves, she's sending the message: no more slavery while she's around and they're grateful she has just saved them from a fate similar to the kids they murdered ONLY to taunt her.
Â 
Of course, the guy who robbed you had a family and friends. They will say "oh, this guy needed a trial!" and they're also right. Barristan has seen men die in battle and know that a King was merciful to him (Robert allowing him to serve him) and what are the consequences of having your own views about justice.
Â 
So, it's not that simple. For the slaves she did good. For Barristan, it's doubtful. The fact that Barristan is feeling there is something wrong about her proves that they want us, the audience, to make our own conclusions about what she did. They're showing the two points of view.
5753	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-27	I was vaguely expecting one of the nailed masters to say to the one next to him
"From this day forth, you shall be with me in Paradise."

The show has now shown her burn a rape victim alive, lock one of her hand maidens in a vault to die, used trickery to get her army, and crucified people on screen. Can we stop with the "whitewashing" nonsense now?
Â 



Â 
Agreed. Show Dany does what Book Dany is often criticised for, but it's still not good enough. Just can't take the complaints seriously anymore.
Â 


we are talking about the sack of Mereen and the 163. A definig moment of a whole book, done in two minutes as a filler scene.
Tonight it doesnt even rank top 3 in the heavy shit moments that were shown in this episode.
Â 


Â 
Filler? The whole start of the episode was revolving around Meereen and Dany's conquest of the city. It was a dark scene; from the screaming and agonising look on the slave masters as they were hung up bloodily, Barristan asking Dany to reconsider and giving her a questionable look, to that great shot of Dany standing atop the Great Pyramid with her Targaryen flag hanging high above the city. Yes, "white-washed".
Â 
Anyway, I reacted the same way in the show as I did in the book. Fuck the slavers.
5773	chicagostatecougars	2014-04-28	Of course they don't show more details about capturing the city. It would make Danaerys look bad.
5774	averde	2014-04-28	Was there white washing? Of course as always when talking about show Danny, but I think this scene in particular heralds better darker Danny days ahead. We have Selmy trying to say "hey this is bad, the bad guys do stuff like this, respond with mercy and be a good guy!" and she rebuffs him and looks fairly evil standing up at the top of the city, targ flag in the background, screams of the crucified coming up from below. Was it book Danny bad? No, but things are heading in the right direction.
5775	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-28	I agree that the sacking scene was very, very lame. One slaver dies. One slaver crucified, and WE SAVED THE CITY!
Â 
All that money spent on creating Meereen (which looks fucking great, btw) and they can't film a few violent revolt scenes?

5779	allie4645	2014-04-28	The Ned lays out justice for us pretty well, my friends:
Â 

Â 
"Do we have your leave to take vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?" Marq Piper asked the throne.Â 
"Vengeance?" Ned said. "I thought we were speaking of justice. Burning Clegane's fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the king's peace, only your injured pride." He glanced away before the young knight could voice his outraged protest, and addressed the villagers. "People of Sherrer, I cannot give back your homes or your crops, nor can I restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you some small measure of justice in the name of our king, Robert..... In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of House Stark, his Hand, I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king's flag, and there bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him, and attaint him, and strip him of all rank and titles, of all lands and incomes and holdings, and do sentence him to death. May the gods take pity on his soul." AGOT 469-470 American Paperback Ed.

Â 
Â 
Slavers sucked, but what Dany did wasn't justice it was vengeance. She wants to take vengeance, that's fine, it was more than earned, but if she doesn't understand the difference between the two, she's in for a pretty tyrannical reign.Â

Â 
Which makes her a hypocrite since she said she "would answer injustice with justice". Justice would have been finding the slavers who were responsible for the kids being nailed to the cross and dealing with them. The remaining slavers not responsible should have answered for their own crimes but not those they had no part in.Â

Exactly! I knew someone would agree.
5785	allie4645	2014-04-28	It occurred to me that the placement of this scene in the episode is important. The episode opens with Grey Worm talking about his experience as a slave (and ohmyworrrrrd the feels), has Grey Worm give an inspiring speech to the Meereenese slaves, brushes over the sacking, then goes into Dany crucifying slavers. It's set up as satisfying, doesn't compare slaver atrocity with Dany's own violent sack of the city, and then the episode quickly moves on. I came on this thread to talk about WW. I completely forgot about the Meereen scenes, and I think that's what was supposed to happen. It was addressed, but not presented as anything major. This is the city in which she will spend the rest of the season, and probably next season, too, and her actually taking over it was completely watered down and placed on the back-burner. After the conclusion of last week's episode, I assumed that a good amount of time would be spent on the conquering of Meereen, but I suppose since Dany is actually doing some murdering they just wanted to focus on her freeing slaves in case the viewer comes to the conclusion that Dany is wandering through Slaver's Bay, taking whatever city strikes her fancy WITH FIRE AND BLOOD.Â
5786	HouseHarrison	2014-04-28	I had to remind myself I was watching Daenerys Targaryen walk through that cheering crowd, and not Jesus Christ.
Â 
*sigh*Dany is consistently popular among the slave class of slavers bay. ADWD makes this clear countless times.
She's hated among the merchants, masters, and leaders of other cities like Qarth and volantis
Anyway I agree the whole Meereen sack was underwhelming

Â 
The rest of this sequence felt super rushed and the final shot of Dany on top of the pyramid looked cheap as hell.

Indeed.Â 
That was "Ive heard this before, Aerys Jr."Â 
Â 
Dany standing on the top of that pyramid while all those guys are screaming and that Targaryen flag placed over the Harpy.Â 
Its spooky. Its supposed to make the audience go "heh yeah!" and then later go "omg was that really justice?" Especially since Barristan protested.Â 


Ahaha, Aerys Jr.Â 
Barristan Selmy the man knows how to find pathetic rulers.

Just no pleasing some people I guess.Â 
And if you think that that was an 'evil moment' you are missing half the point of the sequence. Its another case of GRRM deliberately creating moral ambiguity, asking the reader whether it is right or wrong to do this to people who would do the same thing to others

5799	Nictarion	2014-04-28	Everything that is not pro-dany is always ridiculous to you.Â Nope, just saying a show that clearly shows her as quite cruel to her enemies is portraying her as "Jesus".
5800	PatrickStormborn	2014-04-28	I think it's important while watching this scene to sympathise with the 163 slave children who were nailed up. The screams of the Great Masters mean very little to me with that in mind.
Â 
I don't particularly agree with Dany's actions (I think she should have stripped the masters of all their wealth and exiled them), but it was an important symbol to the people of Meereen: the lives of slaves and the lives of the masters are equal.
Â 
Of course, problems eventually emerge because Dany doesn't continue to be this ruthless - she tries to win them over after she has already alienated them (but that is mostly because she never intended to rule the city in the first place and doesn't really think about the long-term implications of her actions - a huge oversight, of course).
Â 


Â 
Yes, Barristan is Dany's Davos now, her "good angel". I kinda almost write that example .
Â 
With Dany, I guess they're only trying to show us both sides of the story. We often complain about not having an "Essos POV" about her, and now we have it: the slavers are more than grateful that she free them and kill their abusers, so, her actions are shown "good" to their eyes. Barristan, a man with more experience in both battle and life, realises that she has a simplistic definition of revenge: eye for an eye, and that caused her father to be called "mad King"


Â 
That's not at all why Aerys was called the Mad King. He raped his wife, refused to allow anyone with blades near him, planned to burn King's Landing, etc. etc.
Â 
Dany is vengeful and has extreme notions of justice - but "an eye for an eye" is still considered a form of justice.Â

Doubt it. It was pretty graphic and she was shown to point blank ignore the advice of a genuine whiter than white character. Then there was that shot of her looking out over Meereen at the end, Targaryen banner behind, some would leap to the conclusion that it's a sign of her getting lustful for power. Even if you disagree, there'll surely be debate about it, in which case the writers and director have done their job well.
Â 
I really don't know what else they could have done, short of handing her the hammer and nail herself. Maybe they'll break out the faeces, blood and familiars for next season.
5808	PatrickStormborn	2014-04-28	Dany is the most morally ambiguous protagonist on the show by far... but she is also the most heroic. It's the same in the books, and that's part of a larger point GRRM is trying to make.Â

If you're looking for a character who has been whitewashed, look no further than Tyrion "Murder isn't his thing" Lannister.

5810	yushkevitch	2014-04-28	On a different note, Dany related, budgetary concerns clearly explain why Dany goes from being outside among her newly won legions of slaves to the top of the magnificent pyramid -- with no glimpse at all of the interior.Â

Its going to make a lot of people go "What the fuck does that even mean!" and some viewers wont know how to react. I liked that especially


Â 
Hopefully people see it for what it is: punitive and petulant, and what it is not: justice.
Â 
History is littered with the bones of leaders who took half measures as she did here. Either kill them all (regime change) or demonstrate mercy and clemency as a lesson (but with no second chances).

Lol, pretty irrefutable there. I don't doubt to be honest that if the showrunners had spent more time on the scene, someone would still say, 'Yeah, we get it, Dany made a bad decision, you don't need to hammer the point in that much.'
5813	wargalicious	2014-04-28	I definitely thought it was her darkest moment on the show. Which will be made more powerful and interesting once all the trappings of pure white and pure black are burned out of characters like Dany, Tyrion and Stannis. I don't know if they will ever have the courage to do it to Tyrion or the wits to do it with Stannis.

Â 
I think that had more to do with the lines though, way to clean for a real-life discussion.
5817	MoIaF	2014-04-28	I thought the scene with Barristan was about the consequences of her actions more than his disapproval of her actions. As he said at the beginning she had already won, there was no need to stomp on their faces (even if they deserved it).
Â 
This will later come into play with the insurgency of the Harpy and the lessons of ruling Dany will have in Meereen and he later capitulation and marriage to Hizface.
Â 
I also think they wanted to give Barristan some street cred for when he has to take over Meereen after Dany leaves atop Drogon. We don't get much information about him in the series it needs to seem plausible he can take over the city.
5818	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	I don't think Crucifying the slavers was evil.
Â 
However, the scene with Dany looking over Mereen with the Targaryen flag above her and screams being heardÂ was pretty dark. It really brought out the realityÂ of her beingÂ a conqueror.
Â 
Barristan also seemed concerned with her choices which reminded me of his speech about serving under bad rulers (the Mad King in particular) and made me wonder if he was brieflyÂ worried Dany could be less Rhaegar and more Aerys. You could honestly see his concern and doubt for the first timeÂ which I loved.

5823	Bayard	2014-04-28	I wouldn't worry. They will show a darker side to her. Will it be about her character, or about the problem she faces? that's the question. But they will show something. The 163 and Barristan's view on it are the first step. If you don't believe me, just look at their youtube channel, they have a video dedicated to this: mercy or justice. There is no avoiding it, she needs to have huge problems to accept Hizadahr, she will lock her dragons and that can't be forgiven. Than Drogon takes her away and there's nothing she can do about it. All these are points agains Danerys, important enough to not change them. What I am curious is how they are going to portray them.
5824	Silverin	2014-04-28	How many anti-Dany threads do you need to start every month? 10?
Â 
Yeah, she crucified the monsters. Good for her. She should've crucified more of them.


Why is it anti-Dany to point out how collective punishment is not justice?
Did you know who did something similar? The Soviets, when they occupied the various Eastern European contries at the end of World War 2, they ordered the nazis to be punished and based on the casualities they suffered, they basically "ordered" the number. The problem was that in the given time they couldn't find enough war criminals and they didn't have time to do investigations, so they filled up the remaining spots with random citizens so that they could show the "Father"'s justice. As someone from such a country that is no justice to me.
Â 
I have no tears for the slave maesters who killed the children. I personally think GRRM also thought, oh they surely all guilty, no such nuance there.
Â 
But it is alarming that this is what Dany calls justice, no investigation at all, if people seem guilty by association they are guilty in her eyes.
5825	Natasi	2014-04-28	Confused why viewers would cheer Arya on with her eye for an eye violence in the first episode this season and are consistently looking forward to her taking revenge for the whole Stark family. Where are the trials for those men? Why insist Dany should have trials for slave masters who crucify children to make a point, but no one thinks Arya should do the same? 
Here's another way to look at it. There are a lot of Dany haters since ADWD. The show has changed a lot already from the books. Is it not okay to change Dany's story along with those other changes, to improve upon a clumsy book storyline? I would think Dany haters would be happy with that, to change her a little where they weren't so bored with her character. But I guess the hate runs too deep.
5826	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	Yeah, I really don't understand why the showrunners are expected to hold the viewer's hand in displaying Dany's flaws: people's attitudes vary, every unsullied I know already sees the touch of folly and cruelty behind the saviour's surface. If they are blind to it, well, I'm not sure why the writers have a duty to cater to them.
Â 
I think when we lack the imagery about the dead Targaryens, the show's over-the-top triumphalism with regard to Dany restores some of their manic, proud glory. If you don't see that depiction as a cunning way to depict a flawed leader, you might not have the most critical eyes. And the one-sided depiction of Tyrion will be a cunning betrayal as well, when he climbs the stairs to the Hand's chambers.
5827	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-04-28	I'm sure most people "get" what Dany is all about. But the quality of her scenes are not that great if they are not willing to show the fruits of her labor.
5828	David Selig	2014-04-28	Why is it anti-Dany to point out how collective punishment is not justice?


Is that what OP is about? Seems to me it's whining that the scene didn't get more screen time and how it was supposedly a huge moment in the books, even though it is shown even more briefly there, the crucifixions themselves happen "offscreen" in the novel and the whole incident got like 10 lines in total.

â<U+0080><U+009C>How many?â<U+0080><U+009D> one old woman had asked, sobbing. â<U+0080><U+009C>How many must you have to spare us?â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>One hundred and sixty-three,â<U+0080><U+009D> she answered.
She had them nailed to wooden posts around the plaza, each man pointing at the next. The anger was fierce and hot inside her when she gave the command; it made her feel like an avenging dragon. But later, when she passed the men dying on the posts, when she heard their moans and smelled their bowels and blood . . . Dany put the glass aside, frowning. It was just. It was. I did it for the children.

And that's all to it. One short paragraph total. If anything, the show's depiction of them is one, longer, and two, shows Dany in darker, less favorable light: in the books, she herself has second thoughts, in the show Barristan advised her on mercy and she rejected it. How on the Earth is that "whitewashing"?

Blanket pardoning? What are you talking about?She was pleased. Meereen had been sacked savagely, as new-fallen cities always were, but Dany was determined that should end now that the city was hers. She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. Eight killers swung from the walls, and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was calm again.

If you think making her virtually immaculate is the way to salvage a "clusmy" book storyline, I have to strongly disagree with you. Dany as a white savior in the television series makes me extremely uncomfortable, especially the last scene of the "Mhysa" episode where she's hoisted onto the shoulders of a crowd of thankful minorities. We see very little violence in these revolutions, (with the exception of the slavers getting murked), nor do we see her slaughtering every male wearing a tokar over the age of 12 in Astapor. In fact, because of the way it was shot and due to how quickly this uprising occured, we actually can't connect with the realistic brutality that is supposed to constitute these revolutions she's leading.Â  If anything, her arc is simplified and cheapened, unlike the books, where we come to understand the problems of the "white savior complex" through vaguely hinted allusions to colonial occupation.
5831	King Zee	2014-04-28	Man, people thought Â that was a whitewashed scene ? Â I think some of you guys are just looking for things to complain about. Watching 163 people get crucified with the evil red and black flag flies over head is not what I call white washing.Â

The reproach you feel when something is presented to you as irreproachable is nonetheless reproach. If you trust your own judgment and supplement the picture, you lose the necessity to have all fictional expression be in agreement with you. It saves you from a lot of headache. I don't know how it's possible to read the news and feel like you need to witness the horror of every war.

Barristan gives her sound advice, just like the "Forgive people who bend the knee" speech. Its a perfectly good political move that would bring only peace in the long term, and Dany quickly shrugs Barristan's advice (a guy that lived closely to a billion kings, he KNOWS the shit), with an awnser that is both motivated by her bloodlust and her inability to take any action that doesn't involve blood and murder and suffering. That's a trait we get to see in the books, that we, book readers finally got to see (in a show that is heavily Dany-friendly).
Good to show the non-bookies what a blood crazed tyrant is Daenerys Targaryen
5838	C0bR	2014-04-28	The thing is, in the books the crucifixions are mentioned very briefly:
Â 
And that's all to it. One short paragraph total. If anything, the show's depiction of them is one, longer, and two, shows Dany in darker, less favorable light: in the books, she herself has second thoughts, in the show Barristan advised her on mercy and she rejected it. How on the Earth is that "whitewashing"?
Â 
Â 
Blanket pardoning? What are you talking about?She was pleased. Meereen had been sacked savagely, as new-fallen cities always were, but Dany was determined that should end now that the city was hers. She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. Eight killers swung from the walls, and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was calm again.
Â 
Seriously, what blanket pardoning?


That is happens only after she reinstalls the law quite some time after entering the city. Every action before that during the sack was pardoned.

I'll state my point again. She's not a blood crazed tyrant, but showing these revolutions in a way that is virtually devoid of violence, with the exception of "just" executions of the oppressers, is unrealistic and problematic on a number of different levels. The fact that there wasn't any visual representations of the rape, murder, and looting that occur when one takes a city gives the impression that these revolutions of her are going so smoothly that they no longer take place in the gritty reality which constitutes Martin's fictional world. It's the common people who really get fucked in this kind of historical upheveal, and not seeing any of that on screen is really problematic to me. It paints her in a light that is overwhelmingly whitewashed because we don't see the consequences of her actions, however moral her intentions are.
Â 
Â 


The reproach you feel when something is presented to you as irreproachable is nonetheless reproach. If you trust your own judgment and supplement the picture, you lose the necessity to have all fictional expression be in agreement with you. It saves you from a lot of headache. I don't know how it's possible to read the news and feel like you need to witness the horror of every war. Give more credit to yourself, if something is in conflict with your ethics, the dissonance that follows is what is fruitful, not the original stimulus. It's all about digestion


I don't need to see every single war I hear about in gruesome detail. Visual representation of these atrocities in Mereen was key because Dany's take over of Astapor and Yunkai don't properly convey the brutality that comes with violent revolution. I hear what you're saying, and I think that they definitely showed the crucifying of the masters in more detail to compensate for this, but as a reader, and a student of history, I am thoroughly underwhelmed, and highly sceptical of their portrayal of her so far.

Barristan's coup d'A©tat in Meereen was incredibly clever and successful, so I wouldn't say he doesn't know anything about politics and ruling. He was more successful in like three days than Dany was in months.

I think you are conflating his actual accrued wisdom and his ability to comment on anything the previous Kings did. Whether he has any wise advice to give or not, they are utterly useless with the rulers he's used to and the way in which he served them. If Daenerys is different (as she is) and the way in which he serves her is different (as it is) then the entire setting is different. That doesn't affect his ideas of virtue and honour, and sense of duty. If Dany were to change in such a manner that it'd be unspeakable of him to chime in with his guidance, he'd STFU and do his duty like he's used to.
5845	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-28	Look, it doesnt matter how quick or not it is done in the books. The books dont set a tone of gore and violence as D&D like to do. 
If in this context of a show that gives us constant unnecesary detailed scenes of violence, a scene is rushed and bloodless, then it wont be seen as bad in the bigger picture. Its as simple as that.
And I hate the gore and porn this guys do. But it is what it is.
Just compare the image you get from Tyron after the Red Fork....or Talissa after an other battle, or black waters, etc. That is the feeling you got to get after a battle. 
Even lasts week 10-15 wilding strike to a village might be seen more violent than Daenerys paceful occupation.
cause I got this thone from the general scene, I feel the 163 was something they ought to do, but didnt want to. They just wanted to get out of it ASAP.

The idiot showed mercy and had a relatively peaceful reign. But yeah I agree Dany's methods resulted in smooth sailing as well.
5847	Fanless Mace	2014-04-28	Not rushed. What was rushed was Dany's consideration of how to mete out "justice." An eye for an eye is usually not considered "just" in modern society; rather, it seems in Dany's case instead to show us that she has a taste for the value of horror, terror, and propaganda. And an immature, vindictive taste at that. 
While I remain a Dany fan, she's not showng the kind of wisdom (remember Tywin's words to Tommen on the show last week?) that must precede justice. She's in danger of being a reactive and bloody tyrant, like her father the Mad King.
What she has done will only sow more resentment among he monied classes of Essos. Now she has three cities in Slaver's Bay whose surviving powers will do anything to crush her. She may be winning the hearts and swords of the masses, but the rich and powerful never forget such offenses. Her enemies will be more numerous and stronger in opposition to her cruelty, her dragons, her ties to the Dothraki and to Westeros, etc.
5848	Belisarius09	2014-04-28	Â 
I agree that for us it's not justice but for the slaves, it was.
Â 
For example, if you're been robbed and someone arrives and shoots the robber, you will feel forever thankful because it caused a direct benefit for you, and probably saved your life. For the slaves, she's sending the message: no more slavery while she's around and they're grateful she has just saved them from a fate similar to the kids they murdered ONLY to taunt her.
Â 
Of course, the guy who robbed you had a family and friends. They will say "oh, this guy needed a trial!" and they're also right. Barristan has seen men die in battle and know that a King was merciful to him (Robert allowing him to serve him) and what are the consequences of having your own views about justice.
Â 
So, it's not that simple. For the slaves she did good. For Barristan, it's doubtful. The fact that Barristan is feeling there is something wrong about her proves that they want us, the audience, to make our own conclusions about what she did. They're showing the two points of view.


"For the slaves it was justice"
Â 
Ummm..... no. it wasn't. Â You've done a great job of highlighting my point exactly. Â Revenge is not justice, revenge is about making yourself feel better. Â In this case, the slaves, or the victims of the house robbery. Â 
Â 
Allow me to highlight an example from the book. Â 
Â 
"Justice for the Karstarks!" Rickard Karstark wants to kill Jaime Lannister, but eventually kills Martyn Lannister as a "consolation prize." Â Killing those Lannister boys, or his desire to kill Jaime, was not justice. Â It was revenge, it was to make himself feel better. Â Killing the hostages would not bring life for his sons as Cat Stark points out. Â Just as crucifying the 163 Masters will not buy life for the 163 previously crucified children. Â 
Â 
This isn't something that only applies to certain factual scenarios, this is a universally applicable rule (aka law). Â Vengence/Revenge/Retribution =/= Justice. Â Dany has blurred the lines and tries to convince herself and Baristan that she is answering injustice with justice. Â She is mistaken. Â 
Â 
That lesson on what revenge really is aside, I think the show did a good job of showing Baristan's disgust with Dany's actions. Â
5849	Ser PeaCH	2014-04-28	A lot being said about the particulars of Dany's brand of justice that seems to me to be of a 'not seeing the forest for the trees' sort.Â  For me it was her stopping Barristan's council with the "injustice with justice" line and ordering the action be taken.Â  In counter-point to Tywin's lesson to Tommen ending essentially with 'listen to your councilors'.Â  While Tywin's points are all valid we know he is only concerned with molding for himself a pliant and supplicant King.Â  Whereas Dany may be rash and even unwise but feels she must be a Queen of action.

I agree, and I appreciate that as a Dan fan you can see the mistakes she made here. Â
5851	The Third Eye	2014-04-28	Crucifying the slavers was a dark decision but it wasn't evil. Let them taste what they dish out. I usually find Dany annoying but I'm with her on this one.


Â 
UUUhm just to make sure we're on the same page here:
Â 
From a medieval/ancient (or let's say Westerosi/WoIaF) perspective...
... crucifying somebody whose deeds were cruel enough might be in accordance with common moral beliefs so that from that perspective it is understandable that Daenerys who - being born and raised in this world - came to the conclusion that what she did to the slave masters was rather a just than an evil thing.
Â 
From today's perspective...
...crucifying people is evil NO MATTER what they did, period. Even if they had crucified Hitler, Stalin or Elisabeth Bathory, I wouldn't change my mind about that because it wouldn't make the deed less sadistic, evil or cruel. If you - from a modern day perspective - think that there are actions a man can perform that'd make crucifying him even the slightest bit less evil, you are - measured by my moral standards very evil yourself.
5852	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	It's not even just an eye for an eye situation, it's a nihilistic retaliation to a nihilistic offense, first the interchangeability of the slaves that were crucified by the masters, then the interchangeability of the masters that were crucified by the slaves, the persons are vacuumed out of individuality, their views and thoughts rendered meaningless, the manner in which they may have or may not have partaken in the crufixion and enslavement considered irrelevant. It is a type of justice but it's even pre-medieval justice. It's maybe good to keep in mind that her journey from the Red Waste to Westeros may be an arc from the Stone Ages to the Middle Ages, a wayward tribe speeding through the political Geist, as if astride the 'dragon' of Minerva

Â 
Â 


Well you are named Rhaegar 


Â 
well obviously Â
5857	Belisarius09	2014-04-28	Exactly, cruel and unusual punishment isn't allowed in U.S. law. Â 
Â 
Granted the show takes place in a medieval setting and U.S. law doesn't exist there. Â BUT, you're leaving out the Starks. Â The Starks understand how evil something like crucification is. Â No matter how evil or repulsive their opponents, the Starks still grant a quick, and relatively painless death. Â Beheading. Â What's more, they believe the man who passes the sentence should be the one to swing the sword. Â This way they get no pleasure from killing. Â 
Â 
Imagine, if Dany had to do all 163 crucifications herself. Â How far do you think she'd get before she lost her stomach for it? Â The Starks understand the value in carrying out the deed yourself, to se the cruelty firsthand, it keeps them honest. Â They can't turn a blind eye to it. Â If they unjustly punish someone, they have to live with that guilt. Â 
Â 
1. Â Dany orders a horrible painful, cruel fate on 163 people. Â 
2. Â She doesn't "swing the sword" herself. Â 
Â 
Thats two strikes against her. Â 
Â 
(And then that moment when all people who are Dany fans realize that being Dany Fans means they're contradicting the good of the Starks) Â Oh I can see their faces.

5869	Batman	2014-04-28	Just making sure everyone sees the hypocrisy of saying she will "answer injustice with justice" and then nailing 163 slavers to crosses without actually finding out if they were directly involved with the children being killed? That's all I am saying.Â
5870	chilammx	2014-04-28	I donÂ´t think that Danny is "evil" or even getting Mad like his father.
Having little insight of Laws and customs of Slaver Bays, crucifying a fixed number of slavers is a display of power.
I am not sure, but I recall that historical Carthaginians and Romans, did crucified people in large numbers among roads, somehow like the children that Danny avenged.
Â 
Is not possible to judge Romans or Carthaginians as evil with our current views. Less a fictional character like Danny.
Â 
Choosing randomly among the slavers is not fair. But is a constant remainder that she is powerful, and can she do as she wish with the formerly powerful people of Mereen.
Â 
163 of thousands of slavers. They could be few, but the remaining ones will now the fate that can await them.

The difference is the Romans crucified all of the 5,000 survivors of the 3rd Servile War. It wasn't a case of picking out a few to make an example. It wasn't random. It was all of them. The Romans had learnt many times there were only two options. Complete clemency or complete punishment. Any middle ground always ended badly - that is why it was the 3rd Servile War instead of the only one. Similarly 3 Punic Wars and 3 Samnite wars. They only ended once they were either utterly destroyed or accepted into the Roman fold.
5873	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-28	A couple notes. 
-- she picked the 163 randomly, with no indication that they were even involved. While they were all slavers, that didn't seem to be the offense they were being crucified for. 
-- by modern standards, what she did would be a crime against humanity at the very least. Possibly genocide -- which includes killing a group in part -- but harder to prove since it would need her intent to kill them on the basis of their ethnic or national origin, and she had them crucified for being slavers, not strictly for being Ghiscari. 
-- that said, I can't think of a comparable act among all the characters that we consider good. 
-- finally, I'm not driven out of concern for the slavers, who made their own bed (though basic humanity suggests at least a little recoiling against crucifixion) but rather out of alarm at what it tells us about Dany, a character I am generally predisposed to like (see my username). It's cruel and monstrous what she did. 
I don't mind the scene. I don't mind her losing her way, or even revealing something about herself. I just think that it's a scene where we, the audience, should disapprove of her actions.

The difference is the Romans crucified all of the 5,000 survivors of the 3rd Servile War. It wasn't a case of picking out a few to make an example. It wasn't random. It was all of them. The Romans had learnt many times there were only two options. Complete clemency or complete punishment. Any middle ground always ended badly - that is why it was the 3rd Servile War instead of the only one. Similarly 3 Punic Wars and 3 Samnite wars. They only ended once they were either utterly destroyed or accepted into the Roman fold.


Â 
Agreed. Maybe Danny will start learning that.
But she learnt more about power in that scene that ever before in the show.
The way she answered Barristan Selmy. And then her Huge Banner flying over the highest piramyd.Â A lonely Danny in the top watching her new prize.Â Powerful.
5875	David Selig	2014-04-28	A couple notes.
-- she picked the 163 randomly, with no indication that they were even involved. While they were all slavers, that didn't seem to be the offense they were being crucified for.


People keep repeating as if it's an established fact that yet I see no reason to be certain of this neither in the books nor in the show.

It apparently wasn't significant enough to let us know, and it stretches credulity that each of then contributed exactly one slave. 
But most tellingly though is what she asks -- not "who," but "how many?" The intent is pretty clear there. She's not concerned with guilt, but mass punishment.

Â 
Actually we know that salves outnumber 3 (or 4??) the slavers. Thousands of slaves are living in Mereen. So they must be thousands of slavers too.
And in the books, the Mereenese people, specifically the former slaver-nobility, stay a numerous and somehow powerful one after the scourge they suffered.
Â 
More than an anhilitaion punishment it was more like a decimation.
5880	coppersam	2014-04-28	I was coming to say this, the crucifixions were ok, but the sack looked as if nothing bif happened, I know they can't show it for budgetary reasons, but I hope they clarify this next episode (which according to the description, may be the case)


I was so let down by this scene. Â Budget reasons are understandable, but to cut out Dany's battles are really annoying me. Â She has pretty much cake walked so far, and it feels really disappointing, especially when they obviously had money for that terrible CGI of her with the Targaryan flag on the pyramid. Â Just dreadful. Â
5881	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-28	You can't reduce people to statistics. Of all the things wrong with what she did, it's not the proportion of the populace that I'm concerned with. It doesn't make it any less of a terrible act just because the Meereenese social order isn't disturbed by it. 
It's still arbitrary killing to send a message. But if you want to go into the results, fine. Not only is it monstrous, but it doesn't work.
5882	Cas Stark	2014-04-28	I was more bothered that they left out the whole "savage sack" angle of her take over of Meereen...the show makes it look practically bloodless. Â

I' not disagreeing but as we sort of see before this her freedmen followers are fine with killing slavers, the more the better. So it played well with her base but if she tries to forge a peace and rule over the city like in the books maybe listening to Ser Barristan might have made more sense but we will see.Â

But see, you can. Have you heard of decimation? A legion displeased its commanders, an example needs to be made, so let's kill every tenth soldier. Chosen by random. Sure, we don't do that today, but the novels don't take place in modern world. There's no Universal Declarations of Human Rights, there's no Geneva Conventions.
5887	PatrickStormborn	2014-04-28	The true problem with crucifying the Great Masters (apart from the obvious "crucifixion" problem - not defending that BTW) was that it just wasn't enough. She should either have issued a blanket pardon or punished every Great Master. Personally I think she should have stripped them of their wealth and redistributed it among the population.
Â 
I'm not sure whether setting up a trial would have been an effective method. I have no doubt that each of the Great Masters was guilty of some crime - it would eventually lead to her having to punish every slave owner in some capacity.
Â 


Barristan's coup d'A©tat in Meereen was incredibly clever and successful, so I wouldn't say he doesn't know anything about politics and ruling. He was more successful in like three days than Dany was in months.


Â 
Barristan did a decent job, but ultimately he was manipulated by the Shavepate.Â 
Â 
None of what he achieved would have been possible without Dany's sacrifices though. She dealt with the sack, she dealt with the Sons of the Harpy, she dealt with her dragons, she dealt with the Fighting Pits, and she dealt with the Yunkai'i. Barristan was in a relatively easier position, because he had only two options: obey Hizdahr, or disobey Hizdahr.Â

I. It's historically unclear how often decimation was actually used as a punishment given the paucity of reliable historical information on the kingdom and early republic. Our best source for that is Livy, whose primary purpose was moral edification and who delighted in telling stories of the stern virtues of the old Romans. Yet the only attested decimation -/ earlier in the same century in which Livy write -- was regarded with revulsion by the Romans, who were unimpressed by Crassus's decision to invoke what was at the very least an outdated and extreme punishment, if it was ever truly practiced in the past. I mean for goodness sakes, the armies that lost at Arausio or the Caudine Forks weren't decimated, and those were far graver defeats than what Spartacus inflicted on the legions of Crassus. 
II. That entirely aside, the post is that the audience ought to be repelled. Westeros is backwards, yes. But part of the point is that the series deromanticizes fantasy settings and portrays them as harshly medieval. Surely that doesn't mean the audience approves of, say, setting farms to the torch and murdering peasants?
III. And like I said, even within the context of the show or books, we've not seen another character regarded as good do something like that. Tywin may think nothing of exterminating a house that violated the feudal contract and he may have the law in his side, but we don't think of him as a good guy.

Â 


Â 
The humiliation the Legion underwent at the hands of the Samnites at Caudine Forks far outweighed the humiliation of decimation though... It does seem apparent that decimation wasn't particularly about punishment though. It was more about honour and the legion punishing itself for its failings in an attempt to regain that honour. It is, as you say, a murky area, made even more murky by Crassus's legion not being a legion of Rome, but his own personal army.Â

It could be argued that in this case, showing raping and pillaging would've actually had served a point â<U+0080><U+0094> unlike the random raping going on at Craster's Keep to show just howÂ evvviiiil those guys are (cause we didn't get that when they mutinied and killed the Lord Commander)
I'd rather they showed no rape at all, but if they really have to, ya know for the "pervert audience", then it might as well be in places where it makes sense.

I think it's fair to say that they're showing the good and bad sides of Dany's character.
5900	RoamingRonin	2014-04-28	Where was this thread when the little girl was crucified? She wasn't disemboweled like in the books and there was only one child shown. Wasn't nearly as graphic as it should have been. Were the writers uncomfortable with that part, too? I think people would be more uncomfortable with a eviscerated child than a bunch of adults.
Â 
Rather than expose Dany for a villain, the show is exposing some of her detractors as hypocrites. Hypercritical hypocrites.

I think an important difference is that people in Mereen actually were raped and murdered by certain contingents of Dany's army, whereas Jaime didn't rape Cercei in the books. (Martin supports that reading, at any rate). And bear in mind, they didn't even have to show gratuitous amounts of sexual abuse so much as just give us a visual representation of how brutal and violent sacking the city was. That serves a distinct aesthetic purpose, whereas Jaime's scene with Cercei, which was of course not mentioned in this episode, was clearly pure shock value, rather than serving a function for future character development.The way they rendered the scenes in Mereen weren't realistic at all (with the exception of the badguys getting crucified), because revolutions in history never go even half as smoothly as they seem to go in Dany's television arc. I also think it's really telling that the context of events have been changed in these arcs to make Dany's moral failings seem lessened and the moral failings of others less nuanced. It's a bias that is continuing to cheapen the show, and I'm getting really sick of it.
5905	ovis alba	2014-04-28	I didn't mind that scene to be "rushed" but the whole part before that seemed "too easy" for me.

Anything. Anything at all would have made it seem more realistic and emotionally compelling. Considering the way it was shot, they might as well have just put up a big disclaimer at the end: "No slaves were harmed in the making of this revolution!"

5909	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-04-28	I had a tough time feeling bad for the slavers... because of whom they were. They crucified 163 children just to taunt Dany. I just can't see how people can forget that. I'd never go through with such an act, but I can't blame her for wanting vengeance. Isn't it what Arya, Catelyn, Robb, even Jon want? At least in some level, every character has wanted vengeance. Even my favorite, Sansa, has asked for Harrenhal to be given to Walder Frey.

Yeah, yeah. I get that it's easy for Dany fans to ignore legit criticisms on the grounds that people like me who complain about her whitewashing just have some irrational hatred of her, but the reality is I don't. I neither want, nor expect her to laugh maniacally while slaughtering a bunch of children, (although she does murder no small amount of innocent people in Astapor in pursuit of "justice"). My criticisms of her arc stem from the fact that these revolutions and societal upheavals are being rendered in an incredibly unrealistic manner. I'll say it one more time for kicks: revolutions are bloody, brutal, ugly affairs, no matter how noble one's intentions. Dany's path in the novels is dark, nuanced, and far more emotionally compelling because of the realistic way in which the slavers are disposed from power. When you sack a city, lots of innocent people get maimed, raped, and murdered. That's the reality, and its why she punishes people from her own army following the invasion of Mereen. When she took Astapor on the show, all we see are slavers getting their asses kicked. When she takes Yunkai, all we see are incompetent slavers getting their asses kicked. In Mereen, we see, *shocker* slavers getting their asses kicked and then brutally executed (I don't have too much of a problem with this brutal brand of justice by the way, even if it is impractical).
Â 
The fact that so much innocent life is destroyed in the process of these revolutions doesn't make her an "evil" character, but rather shows that the consequences of her idealism have far reaching implications, those of which Martin uses to critique the "white savior" trope, and the ideological forces of colonialism. It actually makes her character deeper when we see her struggling, and in some capacity, failing to succeed in this campaign of liberation. Dany's sincere motivations ultimately result in a substantial loss of human life, and destabilization of the entire region. The fact that her intentions were honorable, and the results of these campaigns so disastrous in the long-term, create a really compelling conflict for the reader, one in which we sympathize with her, and yet find ourselves horrified by the end results.
Â 
Now, I realize that by this point in time, not everything has gone to shit, so it's possible they're giving us revolutions that are colored by candy canes and sparkling rainbows to shock us later on when everything goes south, but I'm not gonna hold my breath. This sense of bias just feels too apparent based on their episode commentaries. The thing is, the showrunners have demonstrated the ability to handle character arcs with fantastic nuance, so I just don't understand why they can't be consistent with appropriating this atmosphere of moral complexity across multiple story arcs. Certain characters, who I won't bother mentioning, are definitely getting the short end of the stick, which is why these charges of whitewashing come up time and time again, not because people just irrationally hate Dany as a character. I won't deny that I'm a bit of a book purist, but speaking simply as somebody who likes a good story, I feel that these important details would only strengthen her as a character on television, because to be honest, she's not all that much fun to watch right now for the same reasons Clark Kent is a boring superhero.Â

As Bryan Cogman mentioned in his interview, the characters have to stumble if you want their triumphs to have any weight. The problem is, it feels like certain individuals are falling flat on their faces for no reason, while others are barely tripping at all.

it's a tv show, they can't show every little detail in the books. they have shown the first key instance of a darker side of dany. i really don't know what more they could have done here. they have her disregarding selmy's advice and ordering the masters to be crucified, then a final shot of her quite clearly looking like she is enjoying her power and swift revenge. as i asked before what more do you want? again, bearing in mind this is a tv show without the luxury of several large volumes of text.
Â 
so what exactly do you want? a few episodes dedicated to each sacking of each city? cause i'm telling you straight up that wouldn't work.

This is going to shock you, but Daenerys and Stannis are two of my favorite characters in the entire series precisely because they both embark upon questionably moral paths in pursuit of power and justice. I've raised criticisms of Stannis before, particularly his assassination of Cortney Penrose. You're absolutely right that they both make a lot of mistakes. They both kill innocent people and guilty people in pursuit of their goals throughout the series. The reason I sympathize with both of them is because from my reading of the text, they're both fundamentally righteous people trying to do the right thing in a very brutal world, which makes their arcs extremely complex and compelling, Â whether they fail or triumph. I think the reason I get so frustrated with the show, is because they don't get the same even handed degree of nuance on television that they do in the novels, and it cheapens them both. All that being said, Dany and Stan fans have their share of hypocrites. I try to assess the show not based on whether or not I like the characters, but whether or not the changes are aesthetically justifiable, and for me, a lot of the shifts in tone and context are bad for the story, and bad for the characters.

I try to assess the show not based on whether or not I like the characters, but whether or not the changes are aesthetically justifiable, and for me, a lot of the shifts in tone and context are bad for the story, and bad for the characters.


Â 
I wouldn't be against Stannis out of default(well.. I don't like his religious side agenda, which could be disputed if he is into it or not)
But my point is:
Stannis wants to force his rule upon the people who do not want him. No one wants him to be king. He might not even be a bad choice, but the people apparently do not like him.
Daenerys is somewhat elected by the people. She wants to force her rule upon the westerosi, I agree, but the others so far all chose her. She had no business with them and just did it. She just freed them, and now there are people who would die for her. She inspires loyalty and hope and whatnot in people. Same as Jon, though she sees her potential, he ignores it.
5917	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-28	Â 
it's a tv show, they can't show every little detail in the books. they have shown the first key instance of a darker side of dany. i really don't know what more they could have done here. they have her disregarding selmy's advice and ordering the masters to be crucified, then a final shot of her quite clearly looking like she is enjoying her power and swift revenge. as i asked before what more do you want? again, bearing in mind this is a tv show without the luxury of several large volumes of text.
Â 
so what exactly do you want? a few episodes dedicated to each sacking of each city? cause i'm telling you straight up that wouldn't work.


Nope. Not a three long arc dedicated to each sacking, but rather, a more nuanced realistic depiction of one or more of her invasions when they're actually happening. The crucifying of the masters in this episode was done very tastefully, and I thought it was the first time since season 2 that they portrayed Dany with any degree of nuance. The problem I have is a few armed slaves, without armor, leading an internal take over of the city without a single on screen causality. Dany has to physically take over Mereen herself in the books, breaking down their doors, her army pillaging all the while. Having to deal out justice to her own troops would been an interesting moral dilemma to me, but hell, even in Astapor it would have been important to see some of the innocent people who live there getting massacred rather than just a bunch of evil slavers with whips, especially after Jorah's speech about "war equaling innocents dying by the thousands". I get that budgets come into play, so maybe I am just whining at this point, but I really feel her arc is lacking because of how unrealistic these campaigns are visually represented. Also, it would be nice for them to tone down the white messiah thing. I can't be the only one who finds it somewhat problematic?

Â 
so your issue is one of realism of a battle then? then i assume you'd want all the other battle scenes to this point (or lack thereof) done again? there's a hell of a lot of them left out/shortened so far.
5919	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-28	This scene returned my fate in Dany's character. She's one of my fav POVs in ASOS but her scenes were really bad and badly acted out. This was much better and finally showed the darker side to her.

Astapor, Yunkai, and Mereen makes three sacked cities that have gone just a bit too smoothly for me to buy into. And I don't remember saying I expect them to go back and refilm any battles to suit my taste? (Not that I'd mind) But yeah, one of the functions of this forum is for snobby book readers like me to complain when we get disappointed with the adapation. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but I think my criticisms of the show's handling of Dany are perfectly legitimate. All I'm really asking for here is more nuance. The scene with Barristan was good. I hope they continue to flesh her out as more than just a white messiah figure in the future.

Â 
but when you single out a battle scene with dany that in your mind "white washes" her (it doesn't) and have no problem with any other battle scenes it clearly shows you are one of these bizarre militant dany hater types and so your criticisms are not really valid at all frankly.
5922	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-28	I think they are portraying Dany's dark side-
Burning the Witch (season 1)
locking Dorhea and Xaro Xhoan Daxos in the volt (season 2)
Her 'fuck yeah, relish in this slaughter' posture and expression when taking the Unsullied (Season 3)
However, people interpret these as badass...not the writing...the audience.
Â 
If you want a real dent in her popularity then add the 'Usurpers dog...traitors death' comment about Ned. That will do the trick!Â There is nothing badass what so ever about dissing innocentÂ Ned. Â

Â 
Dany has simply not had to deal with the consequences of her actions in war yet.Â  It seems odd to me given that nearly every other character has suffered in some way.Â  Maybe we'll only get to see the consequences when she actually tries to rule.Â  There's not a whole lot more for her to do from this point on anyway.

at this point in the books she hadn't either. all that happens in a feast for crows, when she tries to rule mereen and it all goes to shit.

but when you single out a battle scene with dany that in your mind "white washes" her (it doesn't) and have no problem with any other battle scenes it clearly shows you are one of these bizarre militant dany hater types and so your criticisms are not really valid at all frankly.


Yep. Cause three seperate battles equals one in your mind, I guess. I've also stated that Dany is one of my favorite characters, if you'd actually bothered to read any of my posts. Seems like we're at an impasse though, and there's little reason to continue this dialogue.Â
5926	Petyr Patter	2014-04-28	At this point, the problem with how the show presents Danaerys's character is not white washing.
Â 
The problem is the show fails to present Danaerys as any sort of character.
Â 
I can say that Tyrion has been "white-washed" by the show removing some of his darker moments, such as Symon Silvertongue.Â  However, there is no doubt that Tyrion is still a character.Â  He has his doubts, his hopes, and his personality quirks.Â 
Â 
Danaerys is like an adult in a Charlie Brown cartoon, making mwha, mwha, mwha noises.Â  It doesn't really matter what she says, just that Barristan and Jorah are going to be like "Argh!"Â  I can't think of the last time she's had a conversation.Â  Instead, she has proclamations.Â 
Â 
Or, ask these two questions.Â  1)Â  When was the last time Danaerys had to make a hard choice?Â  2) When was the last time Danaerys suffered the consequences of a choice?Â 
Â 
Everything since Astapor has been a victory lap for her and even Astapor she walks away with her army, having freed the slaves, punished the sinners, and still in possession of her dragons.Â  In essence, she got everything at a cost of nothing.Â  At Yunkai she robs the peace envoy, has an enemy lieutenant infiltrate her tent and survives because he wants to bang her.Â  The same former enemy has some scheme where three guys fight 50 and then take the city without any other complications.Â  She now has thousands of followers with no jobs and only the possessions they can carry on their back.Â  We never hear of any difficulty in feeding them or what the longterm strategy is.Â  They just leave and start worshiping her.Â  Approaching Meereen the show does nothing to build suspense.Â  The most danger Danaerys is in is from the champion's charge, and then only because she like an idiot takes a front row view for the fight instead of standing behind some Unsullied.Â  Of course the guy goes down due to some unhonorable tactics by the sell sword.
Â 
Compare her campaign to either Robb or Tywin.Â  Robb is forced to chose between justice (executing Karstark) or using him as a hostage to keep his men loyal.Â  He choses justice and loses the men.Â  Tywin doesn't care about justice, but none the less has to chose to ally himself with the Tyrells and bring them into the royal family, the same family that marched with Renly Baratheon to usurp his grandson.Â 
Â 
The crucifixion scene was mostly well done.Â  I would have preferred much stronger opposition argument than "mercy?"Â  Compare her attitude regarding the slave masters to Robert Baratheons attitude regarding Targaryens, Danaerys included.Â  It was Eddard Stark who called Robert out on his cowardice and injustice, going so far as to resign the most powerful appointed office in all of Westeros.Â 
Â 
Danaerys right now is simply the weakest story arc.Â  Maybe it improves.
5927	JDNight	2014-04-28	For a moment lets forget what she did to the slavers.Â  That is an argument that can be debated.
Â 
Lets instead lookÂ at what she has done to the innocents.Â  Sure, there is a bunch of slaves quote-unquote freed right now.Â  They are 'free' to worship her apparently.Â  However, what the tv show is not showing is the tens of thousands (if not more) of innocents that died horribly in her rebellions.Â  Many were raped or maimed or worse.Â  Every time she 'liberates' a place she leaves it in complete shambles.Â  This is not being shown on tv.Â  The collateral damage that she causes which far exceed the quote-unquote help she gives to people or even the justice that she dishes out.
Â 
In a very good light, she is an amateur who is blind to the realities of life.Â  In a bad light, she is a murderous conqueror who uses smooth words and 'justice' to justify her actions.Â  Either way, I don't like her.Â  Her actions and results directly reflect her upbringing and her sudden serendipitous gain of power.

5928	TaenaOfMyr	2014-04-28	One of Dany's most violent acts in the series to this point and it is proclaimed "white washing". Unbelievable. Next episode could have Dany slit the throats of Jorah, Barristan, Missandei and Dario and bathe in their blood while Tyrion decapitates Tommen, boils Ser Pounce in a stew and pays sell swords to find Pod & Brienne on the road and kill them and certain people would still call it white washing.
5929	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	You guys are over glorifying how this was handled in the books. Dany ordered the cruficition of 163 masters but she didn't nail them all up herself or anything. It was handled quite swiftly in the books, and the majority of content relating to it stems from discussion of what she did later. Which the show has yet to cover. Dany changes a lot in A Storm of Swords, but the crucifictions were merely a cause. The focus of the story in the books, and as it likely will be in the show, is in the effect. What happens as a result of her actions.
Â 
I think you guys are giving the books too much credit on this one, and the show not enough.
5930	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-28	I feel like you guys keep setting up strawmen instead of actually addressing Thelastactoinhero's points.Â  He's not saying that every minute of battle should be shown, but if you recall they did at least show the aftermath and the consequences of it all.Â  He wasn't even criticizing her use of justice or methods either.

This is a show that worships gore. Last week wilding attack to a village was shown more violent than a freaking slave revolt in a big city.
You dont need to film the damn battle with details. Take Tyron being nursed after the Red Fork, or Talissa working with wounded after an other battle...., well done scenes that show people die and suffer with the main characters actions.
If in a context of a blood thirsty show, Daenerys sack is shown as a Sunday walk, then its Bias. As simple as that. I do not like cheap violence, but thats what D&D enjoy delivering 24/7. when they dont they white wash.
					
					
							Edited by SeA±or de la Tormenta, 28 April 2014 - 09:16 PM.
5931	Seneti	2014-04-28	Personally, I think D&D are setting Dany up for a complete failure line. They may not have shown the unpleasant consequences of her conquest yet, but if we'll have the battle of Meereen at the end of season 5, then we now have one and a half seasons to go from "everything is going super well for Dany" to "Khaleesi done fucked it up". D&D seem to love that kind of steep decline. Let's take a look at what - canonically - happens after this point in the books:
Â 
- half the petitions she hears are people complaining about what they lost through the sack of Meereen
- the other half are trying to either turn her into a master herself or to get rid of her
- Quarth will come back to haunt her by blocking her trade routes and sieging Meereen
- Yunkai will come back to haunt her by hiring every sellsword they can find to take her out
- Astapor will come back to haunt her by sending the pale mare
- Meereen's masters will come back to haunt her through the Harpy and her murder and rape of her freed men and women
- Drogon will kill a child
- her dragons will be locked up, leaving her without her greatest weapon
- she will nearly be poisoned during her wedding celebrations!
- she ends up in the middle of the fucking mountains, with a man-eating dragon that only half listens to her and a Dothraki horde approaching
Â 
Seriously, I think we're gonna see lots of dark Dany the closer we get to the end of season 5.
Â 
Now, a few thinks about some of the posts:
Â 
Â 


Theres no "they". How can she know if some opposed, if some said no? Picking 163 random slavers is an unfair move.
Besides if you do the same, you became the same shit you fight against.


Â 
Agreed.
Â 


they made the "sack" of mareen seem like one guy died during it. Â where was all the rape, plunder and pillaging that dany ended up blanket pardoning? Â the white wash machine was in full affect today...


Â 
Maybe they didn't have the time and money to shoot it? Maybe they didn't want to spoil Dany's big moment and we'll get to hear about it all next week?
Â 


How do you know she's pardoned it? We haven't seen any of her scenes in the throne room yet, which is where we hear about all that.


Â 
Agreed. I expect some answers next week.
Â 


Lol on the complaint it was "rushed". They literally showed Great Masters being nailed to to crosses, what more do you want?
The show has now shown her burn a rape victim alive, lock one of her hand maidens in a vault to die, used trickery to get her army, and crucified people on screen. Can we stop with the "whitewashing" nonsense now?


Â 
This. So much.
Â 


The thing is, in the books the crucifixions are mentioned very briefly:
Â 
And that's all to it. One short paragraph total. If anything, the show's depiction of them is one, longer, and two, shows Dany in darker, less favorable light: in the books, she herself has second thoughts, in the show Barristan advised her on mercy and she rejected it. How on the Earth is that "whitewashing"?
Â 
Â 
Blanket pardoning? What are you talking about?She was pleased. Meereen had been sacked savagely, as new-fallen cities always were, but Dany was determined that should end now that the city was hers. She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. Eight killers swung from the walls, and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was calm again.
Â 
Seriously, what blanket pardoning?


Â 
Thanks for the book quotes 
Â 


The OP is upset everyone doesn't automatically hate Dany because of this scene. If only it were longer and more brutal, people will realize how much Dany is a villain and will stop calling her "khaleesi" and her entire fanbase will jump to Stannis.Â 
Â 
There are darker moments coming. We haven't seen Hazzea or anything after she captures Meereen. Can you people have some patience?Â 


Â 
Agreed. This seems to be the most common reason for book fan outrage about the treatment of certain characters - they can't seem to handle the idea that there is still so much time to show all the great moments (as soon as they become relevant). For comparison, see Sansa becoming a player and Rhaegar being mentioned.
Â 


I think they are portraying Dany's dark side-
Burning the Witch (season 1)
locking Dorhea and Xaro Xhoan Daxos in the volt (season 2)
Her 'fuck yeah, relish in this slaughter' posture and expression when taking the Unsullied (Season 3)

Â 
I agree. Sooner or later, we are going to have to get to a scene where Dany will have to discuss potential allies in Westeros and her "usurper's dogs" comments about the Starks are bound to really piss of show watchers.
5932	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-28	I think Dany's road to victory has been so smooth because she's about to hit a mine field. The dragon tea party was foreshadowing; she was smiling and petting a cuddly Drogon, the sweet queen with her feasting children, only for her efforts to "calm" them to be met with a velociraptor shriek to the face.Â 
Â 
I'm not just spitballing. Outside Mereen, the camera focused repeatedly on Hizdahr at the walls. I think they're going to try to flesh him out and perhaps composite him with some of Xharo's role from ADWD, the one who calls her on how sing-song her queenship is going.Â 
Â 
Plus, even if D&D have softened some of the characters at this point, they haven't shown any real desire to lessen their suffering. There's not many ways that can happen in regards to her story arc; she wants to raise her dragons and be a good queen. Her dragons are rebelling and her rule's about to fishtail.Â
5933	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	I think Dany's road to victory has been so smooth because she's about to hit a mine field.


So much this, the people complaining are misremembering the books. The crucifixion of the 163 masters is nothing compared to the shit that's about to happen. You've all jumped the gun on this one, her descent hasn't happened yet.

Lol, her standing at the top of the pyramid reminded me of Evita. More specifically, "Don't Cry for Me Argentina," which isn't long before "Rainbow Tour," the part where Evita realizes something's wrong with her and the politicians start taking potshots as she dies from cancer.Â

5935	starkbucks	2014-04-28	I can't say for others, but personally, I will kill anyone practicing slavery and those who support slavery. Therefore to me Dany was justified in crucifying everyone when she conquered Meereen. She was in fact merciful enough to kill only 163 of them for the slave girls killed along the way.
Â 
At the point of the punishing the slavers, she was at war. It was her army versus the slavers. Once she became their queen her attitude towards the Sons of Harpy and her hostages changes.
5936	Nictarion	2014-04-28	I thought the scene with Barristan was about the consequences of her actions more than his disapproval of her actions. As he said at the beginning she had already won, there was no need to stomp on their faces (even if they deserved it).
Â 
This will later come into play with the insurgency of the Harpy and the lessons of ruling Dany will have in Meereen and he later capitulation and marriage to Hizface.
Â Exactly! I can't help but laugh at those who are reading that look as "oh boy her we go again" wrt Dany becoming like her father.

I didn't read it like "oh no she be cray!" Rather, as Barry having a moment of dissonance. A combo of realizing how inexperienced she is (no foresight as to how this will influence her wealthiest subjects) and the shortsighted brutality of face-kicking her conquered people. Sure they're slavers, slavery's bad, but I start to have doubts in a leader when he or she makes choices from their personal morals more than objective reasoning. Either smash them so hard they can't threaten her again or be merciful. In-between passive-bloodthirsty acts earn no respect.

Fun list of people who used slaves or sold slaves:
Jorah Mormont.
Khal Drogo.
Danaerys.
The degree somebody should be held responsible for being born into a specific culture is limited.Â  Had another emancipation crusader caught up with Drogo's Khalasar in A Game of Thrones, Danaerys would be nailed to a cross.Â  Or gang raped per the Dothraki custom.Â 
Â 
I suppose this is a rather glib response, but simply dismissing the slave masters as evil and their deaths as justified is far to simple an interpretation.

Yeah, her downfall/rough patch is when she sets up shop in Mereen and decided to rule. That's when shit hits the fan.Â
5942	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-29	For one, I'm glad we didn't linger any longer on Dany killing the masters. Â It was well done, and they had a lot to cover in the episode. Â We saw her ignore Barristan and his concern. That will probably be significant. Â 
Â 
We MAY have to wait until the end of the season to render a verdict about whether there is any "white washing."
5943	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-29	I had to remind myself I was watching Daenerys Targaryen walk through that cheering crowd, and not Jesus Christ.
Â 
*sigh*

I kept seeing them waving palm leaves even though they weren't.
5944	DemiNymph	2014-04-29	How drawn out do you want this scene to be? It's sufficient to cover the important points and the message was clear to the audience. Barristan counselled her to one path and she choose another path, and they showed the nailing part and the moans and screams of pain already. Do you want them to drag the timeline until the bodies are decayed and the flies are disturbing the population? How long will that take? Please bear in mind that this show is not about her alone - they have to devote screentime to more gratuitous sex and boobs ya know!Â
5945	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-29	How drawn out do you want this scene to be?


The whole criticism about the crucifixion being rushed is honestly incorrect. It's handled very briefly in the books, and isn't a character defining moment at all. Just one small event out of many contributing to Dany's later character development.
Â 
The crucifixion was handled fine. The slave's revolt is the thing that people should be complaining about.
5946	Carolus Rex	2014-04-29	I really liked it. It was effectuful enough, with Dany's line of "I will answer injustice with justice!" and then a nice panorama shot of 163 men screaming and dying while she was looking pretty content.
Like my brother said, "time to stash my Stark shirts and get some Targaryen clothing instead" 
Â 
They made their point with those scenes, and I, as usual though, can't wait for next episode
5947	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-29	Barristan's face!Â He said more with his expression than he could ever say with words. His face says "Yes. Ive heard this before. Ive heard it from your father's lips."Â 
Â 
Dany doesÂ notÂ come off looking amazing and rosy here. She looks good on the surface, but Barristan helps us understand the true meaning of this scene.Â 
Â 
Please look harder on a rewatch. Hes very visibly not cool with her "Ill answer justice with justice" line.


Â 
Â 
Am I weird that I think Dany comes off as amazing for ordering it, rebuffing Barristan, and then surveying her new realm while calmly listening to the screams of the crucified masters in the background. Very Targaryen moment there (and clearly this is what makes Barristan uncomfortable). Personally, I think Dany is always most impressive when filled with this sort of wrath.
5948	ovis alba	2014-04-29	To me it's really not so much about the scene but about the stuff before. And it's also not really about whitewashing Dany but about "stupidwashing" Meereen and the slaves. All these years they didn't rebell for a reason, because they were afraid for their lives, so to me it's more of: please show they actually had good reason to be afraid. It doesn't have to be a big scene, but the master seeing the writing on the wall have him order to take the hand of one of his slaves off and another ear, hand whatever for each additional he finds or just something in that direction, something where indeed a slave is hurt for rebelling, anything really.
It might whitewash Dany more, because it gives even more reason for her to have a good point freeing the slaves, but it does make the fear of the slaves just a little more "real" and less "why did we never thought of this"

Lol, her standing at the top of the pyramid reminded me of Evita. More specifically, "Don't Cry for Me Argentina," which isn't long before "Rainbow Tour," the part where Evita realizes something's wrong with her and the politicians start taking potshots as she dies from cancer.Â

I think in this regards a "problem" with Dany is, that hardly anyone can doubt that she is pretty important for the story. I mean she has the dragons, she has people coming over to her side, but she keeps completley to her own storyline and I think it's the lack of interaction with other major POV characters that makes her seem somewhat less ambigous from the narrative point of view because nobody is interacting with her, with us being in their heads. I think for many people wanting to see Dany more "evil"Â  is actually wanting her to be less boring.

Oh I quite appreciated the dark foreshadowing, and it isn't really the book readers that think it's badass (though there's one or two), it's mostly the casual viewers, the ones who still call her Khaleesi or the dragon queen. Unlike cases of whitewashing and blackwashing (Tyrion and Stannis respectively) Dany has been portrayed fairly neutrally so far, so the blame lies with how the viewer interprets her scene and "victories", you're right.
The people saying that if she includes a line about "usurper's dogs" that she'll be disliked more are spot on. I somehow doubt they'll include this though.
5969	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-29	When all the critics to the Show portraits come from some fandom, and the biggest defence from an other, its almost dumb to say theres nothing wrong.
9/10 Stannis likers or Jaimes are pissed almost every week with this characters portrait. Something you wont see with Daenerys. Most of his fans strongly defend how she is played...
Something its not right. We just cant fall in arguments such as "Stannis fans" are all purists or stuff like that. We all are different people, as different as we could be.

I'm sorry, I don't even would draw that line, but if, then Stannis' burning of the seven and the weirwood trees could be a parallel to the burning of books and art during Hitler times. But I would not make that comparison.

5978	GallopingGhost	2014-04-29	I wouldn't characterize Dany having 163 slave masters crucified as retribution for the 163 crucified slaves as evil. Did the slave masters hand pick the 163 slave children? Did they look for the evil slave kids who didn't obey commands well? Did they choose the slaves to crucify based on their actions or crimes? Or did they just rustle up a bunch of slaves to crucify as awarning to Dany? Dany is attempting to abolish slavery. This is a revolution... a war. The slaves revolted, won, and punishment was doled out to the slave masters in the same fashion their warning message to Dany was executed. It also sends the message that a slave's life is just as important as a slavers - 163 slaves = 163 slave masters.

It's like Robb hanged the guy that just watched. That guy was just as guilty as the others, if not even more guilty. He didn't do it, but he accepted it and that makes it worse.
The slavers, involved or not in the murder of the kids, they tolerated it, hey accepted it. Away with that scum.
It's not the leader that is the most evil, it's the people that accept him and think he does the right thing, who follow him, they are the worst.

At the end I posted a previous post of mine where I explaned why it is not justice. Dany is the most similar to the soviet Fathers (and among them mainly Lenin, who just like Dany got very quickly very angry if he heard about any kind of injustice, it angered him greatly).
They too started out as a way for a more equal word, were worshipped by the some of the classes who they created better oportunities for (working class), it is just their intentions became meaninglesss as they used worse and worse methods.
My parents grew up with the "this or that is necessery for the better future" propaganda, also since my own greatgrandfather was used to show an "example" by them (he was a rich landowner, and they made an example out of him so that people would start giving their lands and properties to the state, and also to show that the working class worth as much as the others, he was tortured for weeks by them just because he was rich...), excuse me if I don't think it is ok to use people, who you don't know if they commited anything as any kind of example (it is different if you do it with the actually guilty once, but then Dany never even made an effort to find them). Anyone who does that are just like the soviets and the communists to me. Ultimatly there is a point when intention doesn't matter anymore. Dany is not there yet, but she is getting closer to the line.Â

Do you think Barristan is worse than Aerys then?
You don't know how much others in the ruling class backed the decision or not. Not even ruling classes are homogenous (there is just no such thing as homogenous society, wether it is about, nation, ethnicity, class). Like didn't any of you learnt actual history, because history is full of examples as how the ruling classes don't share some universal value.
For example Ghengis Khan's own son was against of his fathes method and cruelty, so if someone comes and decides that the Mongols have to answer for their crimes and kills his son (since he was part of the ruling class, and Ghengis son), (he was actually killed by his own father by the way, exactly because he tried to oppose his father) how would that be justice or ok? Even people in the ruling class has different opinions and morality, if the Meereenese don't that is a failing of GRRM for making a homogenous society that lacks actual dimension and realism.
Â 
Â 


Why is it anti-Dany to point out how collective punishment is not justice?
Did you know who did something similar? The Soviets, when they occupied the various Eastern European contries at the end of World War 2, they ordered the nazis to be punished and based on the casualities they suffered, they basically "ordered" the number. The problem was that in the given time they couldn't find enough war criminals and they didn't have time to do investigations, so they filled up the remaining spots with random citizens so that they could show the "Father"'s justice. As someone from such a country that is no justice to me.
Â 
I have no tears for the slave maesters who killed the children. I personally think GRRM also thought, oh they surely all guilty, no such nuance there.
Â 
But it is alarming that this is what Dany calls justice, no investigation at all, if people seem guilty by association they are guilty in her eyes.

Well, actually, yes. But we don't know with how much love he heeded his commands.
I say a better example, as we just know more about the time, is Meryn Trant. He loves to follow Joffrey's madness and commands that go against the law.
Â 
I couldn't say Ilyn was bad when executing Ned, cause in his view and to his knowledge Ned was a traitor and therefore it is only right to behead him. And it is Ilyns job to do it.
Â 
But a people cheering and applauding a ruler for cruelty and giving him the crown, that is just madness. These are free people, not bound to any loyalty towards the king. They do not have a rule that they have to follow their leader. They are the masses, they could object. Single persons like Barristan, not really.

Â 
Anyway, I don't see how this was whitewashing at all. Â In fact, my husband and I (both who have read the books) found the scene very disturbing and it couldn't move past it fast enough. Â She is confusing 'justice' with 'vengeance' here. Â 'Justice' is when people are punished for their own crimes, not the crimes of others. Â There are always good people and bad people...even slave owners can be good people and not treat their slaves badly. Â Would those people deserve to be crucified simply for having owned slaves, regardless of their treatment of those slaves? Â It is very reminiscent of the Reign of Terror, where French aristocrats were beheaded simply because they were aristocrats. Â That wasn't justice, either.

I mean seriously we saw the nails getting hammered in, then we saw 30 seconds of screaming, it's sunk in, thats more than enough gore for one scene. While making characters (Dany, Stannis, Tyrion) more morally 2D is a concern, I really don't think it's as bad as many think.
Â 
Also I didn't realise that the "eye for an eye" morality was still so prevalent in our society, I mean really? It is understandable that she would sentence those responsible to death, that is just the world she lives in, but crucifixion/flaying/burning alive/any kind of torturous execution= bad and this isn't just modern morality, many within westeros have expressed extreme distaste with cruel methods of execution.

Either the whole class, the specific individuals responsible for the 163, or none at all. In the 'none' case, clearly set out the rules going forward then come down on them like a ton of bricks for any individual breaches from then on.

Because I don't hate Dany, not truly. I can't speak for everyone but I think I lot of us are the same, Dany was supposed to be the good option, we were supposed to look forward to her coming over to Westeros on her dragons and kicking ass. But we were putting to much expectation and weight on to the shoulders of a 13 year old girl, and she buckled. In the position she's in one slip causes a mudslide and everything started going wrong. What is she fighting for? Her ideals? Or Westeros?
Â 
She's built up to be there hero, but Meereen is where she falls from that seat. I think most of the rabid discussion about Dany is not solely because people dislike her. It's because we were built up to love her but she fucked it all up. As for the Mountain, nobody likes him but he doesn't show himself enough to warrant much discussion beyond Robert Strong theories.

The successful conquerors did no such thing: Gaius Julius Caesar, Caesar Augustus, Augustus Aurelian, Tamberlaine.
Â 
Alexander the Great conquered the known world without marching into cities and summarily killing numbers of the leaders. He marched his small army into cities, went to the treasury, minted all the gold into coins, distributed it all and set up a cash economy - then he marched off to the next city leaving a governor behind. None of the gold was sent back to Macedonia. It all stayed in the local region. The next city then threw open their gates. In many cases, the city governors he was appointing weren't Macedonians, they were locals.

Â 
And they didn't react again until he much later:
Had a throne for himself placed in the senate
Started wearing a purple (royal) toga instead of the red one he was supposed to
Remained seated when he met people of Senatorial rank.
He began treating them as subjects - a mistake his successors didn't make. Caesar Augustus's title was 'Princeps' - first among equals, not 'Rex' as JC was setting himself up to be. All his pardons worked and ended the generations of civil wars and brought peace. But then it went to his head and he threw it all away. Cue: more civil wars until his son won his way through then made sure he didn't make the same mistake.Â
6005	GallopingGhost	2014-04-29	Dany isn't going around conquering cities to build herself a dynasty. She is attempting to abolish slavery in Slaver's Bay. She put aside her desire to regain rule of Westeros for the time being to deal with something that is a disgusting practice. Owning other people as property is morally abbhorent. Where do these slaves come from? They were free people from weaker areas that have been captured and enslaved. James Edward Ogelthorpe (founder of the Georgia colony) said â<U+0080><U+009C>If we allow slaves we act against the very principles by which we associated together, which was to relieve the distresses. Whereas, now we should occasion the misery of thousands in Africa, by setting men upon using arts to buy and bring into perpetual slavery the poor people who now live there free.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â 
Â 
William Lloyd Garrison, an abolitionist, said "I cannot but regard oppression in every form â<U+0080><U+0093> and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing â<U+0080><U+0093> with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle. They who desire me to be dumb on the subject of slavery, unless I will open my mouth in its defense, ask me to give the lie to my professions, to degrade my manhood, and to stain my soul. I will not be a liar, a poltroon, or a hypocrite, to accommodate any party, to gratify any sect, to escape any odium or peril, to save any interest, to preserve any institution, or to promote any object. Convince me that one man may rightfully make another man his slave, and I will no longer subscribe to the Declaration of Independence. Convince me that liberty is not the inalienable birthright of every human being, of whatever complexion or clime, and I will give that instrument to the consuming fire. I do not know how to espouse freedom and slavery together."
Â 
We passed the 13th amendment which abolished slavery.
Â 
600,000 people died in the Civil War.
Â 
Abolishing slavery was not a peaceful process in the United States.

Was the violence, war and death to abolish slavery worth it?

Talk about whitewashing. Â LOL. Â And Julius Caesar as a nice guy. Â

Â 
Hate on Dany all you want. Â 
Â 
Barristan was giving her good advice and we see down the line how she has to pay for alienating the ruling class by marrying Hidzar (sp).
Â 
Nevertheless, I do not see her cruxifiction as either insane or evil. Â And posters have correctly pointed out her own doubts about what she has done.
Â 
No trial would have uncovered who was more responsible for those163 children. Â There is no way she could have gotten to the 'truth' of that. Â People would have lied their assess off in order to rat out someone else who might have had nothing to do with those cruxifictions.
Â 
When a great evil has been done: slavery + taunting her with 163 children, there is no easy and just answer. Â If the story teaches us anything, it teaches us that.
Â 
Hate on Dany all you want. Â I fully believe she will be pivotal to saving Westeros in some way.
Â 
She is not an evil sorceress with blood dripping from her mouth. Â That is a ridiculous interpretation.
Â 
She is acting out her anger over her own slavery, something completely understandable and justifiable.
Â 
I don't see any good answer for Mereen. Â Blanket pardon would not have calmed those slaver fucks. Â Nothing but being slavers again would have calmed them.Â 
Â 
This is the basic conundrum for anyone wanting to build a better world, something that Dany passionately wants: what to do with those raised and living by a set of obscene standards, those who won't change willingly.
Â 
Frankly, Dany hate seems irrational to me. Â Hate Joffrey; hate Tywin; hate Craster; hate the Mountain.

She probably will be very important to saving Westeros, but that doesn't mean she will be the one best fit to rule it. Â There's a difference.

When cities and leaders surrendered to him, he showed clemecy. That clemency was repaid. The battles he won were, by his own admission, luck. The key to achieving what he did was through clemency. He earned peoples trust. He later betrayed that trust by setting himself up as a king.

6015	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-29	I don't see how this could back to haunt Dany as long as she's out of Essos. In Westeros, slavery is a punishable crime. Jorah almost lost his head for that. "Daenerys Targaryen, the one who ended up slavery in SB". The tales of her bad government aren't reaching Westeros, only that she's conquering (barbaric) cities and she has dragons. Westerosi lords aren't going to cry for the death of the Slavers, they're are going to find out that she's not shy about punishing crimes. And that's a good think for her and her campaign.
6016	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-29	I'm glad to see that the show is trying - albeit uncomfortably - to portray Dany as the cruel and capricious conqueror that she is.
Â 
I'm not sure that all viewers are that thoughtful or reflective, unfortunately. I think most just love Dany because she's a "strong woman" - "girl power!" - and wholeheartedly endorse whatever course of action she takes. I was watching the show with some Unsullied, and during the mass-crucifixion, quipped, "Coming soon to a Westeros near you!" It was not well-received.

Tywin, "Sacker of Cities" and burning down the Riverlands, Gregor Clegane harrying the Riverlands and wiping out entire families to the man, Robb Stark foraging in the Westerlands... cruel and capricious conquest is a way of life in Westeros and for 99% of the populace the only difference between being sacked by Daenerys, sacked by Tywin, sacked by Robb, or sacked by the Ironmen is the design on the banners that the soldiers are carrying.As rulers they are very different, but I don't think that there's a "nice"/"non-evil" way to make war in this setting. The closest we get is Stannis discouraging rape.
6020	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-29	I definitely agree that they're biased in her favor. I know a lot of people think our criticisms of Stannis' portrayal are unfounded, but seriously, they've definitely made a conscious decision to make her triumphs bigger and failures minimized. Whereas Stannis' moral failures are also simplified, but in such a way that makes him darker and cheap.


 
Â 
Dany isn't "evil" in the books, but the show has been very soft on her, to keep her as the "audience favourite" I suppose (though in a less obvious way than they did with Tyrion), whereas Stannis has become one of the darker (and slightly villainous) characters.

Perhaps by the end of the season all these will have been inverted. Plotlines point to it. Hoping for a large-scale betrayal of all the lulled senses and hushed subtexts. The world will be gray, as it indeed has always been..

6038	flores	2014-04-29	I feel the point of the scene was just as much to establish Dany as a very emotional ruler, as it was to show her "evil moment" as OP calls it. In the previous episode Tywin was schooling Tommen on what makes a good king, and it wasn't a just king or someone who answers "injustice with justice", but one who listens to their advisers... And Dany doesn't really do that - in the show so far that is.
6039	Cas Stark	2014-04-29	They were slavers though, not just random people. And if they weren't they were Ghiscari. The world is better place with them gone.


Â 
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were slavers, too. Â Holding slaves in a slave holding society is a very low threshold for being randomly killed if you ask me.
6040	El Guapo	2014-04-29	It was vengeance plain and simple and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it both in the show and the books.

Â 
We don't even know what kind of people they were. That's like liberating some parts of Germany including concentration camps and randomly executing drafted Wehrmacht soldiers for every Jew while some SS-officers just getting off easy because it happened they got not chosen.

For all we know Dany might even have crucified Meereen's version of Oscar Schindler.

Yes, but this isn't Schindler, or Jefferson or G. Washington's story, nor a tale about the morals and tales of slavery: it's a subplot in Dany's story. We can see their acts of "justice" as injustice or even tyranny, but we're not meant to cry for the slavers more than we cry for the Lannister soldier who died while fighting in the Riverlands.

When slavery was abolished in Australia, no one died. I'd much prefer the '0'.


Â 
Hear, hear.
Â 
Abolition of chattel slavery was accomplished peacefully throughout most of the world. In America, however, emancipation was a bloody nightmare, the incidental outcome of an invasion launched for the enrichment of the conquerors at the expense of the conquered. A century after emancipation, racism still afflicted the country, and in many ways had actually gotten worse. By overthrowing the consent of the governed (the shield of liberty) with force of arms (the sword of tyranny), the Union was preserved in name but destroyed in spirit, and the emancipation of the chattel slaves came at the cost of the political enslavement of all free men. The ends don't justify the means, two wrongs don't make a right, etc. Of course, ceteris paribus, emancipation was a positive outcome of the so-called "Civil War," but the point is that it could have been achieved without any devastating loss of life and liberty. Of all the emancipations in the world, American emancipation came at the greatest cost and with the worst results.
Â 
Ironically, secession by the North or South would have hastened slavery's demise. Because the Constitution provided for the rendition of fugitive slaves, and arguably permitted the expansion of slavery into American territory, slavery was safer in the Union than an independent Confederacy. By depriving the South of these constitutional protections, the stability of slavery - particularly concerning runaway slaves - would have been seriously undermined. Abolitionists such as William Garrison supported Northern secession in order to destabilize slavery, as well as disassociate themselves from the institution. Others, such as George Bassett and Lysander Spooner, supported Southern secession on principle: if governments truly are consensual rather than coercive, then the people have the sovereign right to dissolve their union with a government to which they no longer consent, regardless of their reasons.
Â 
As an example of slavery's constitutionally protected status in the Union, throughout his presidential campaign and in his First Inaugural Address, Abraham Lincoln strenuously disavowed any "authority or intention" of his to abolish slavery, affirming that he would "fully and fairly" enforce fugitive-slave laws, and even endorsing a constitutional amendment to protect slavery permanently in states where it was already legal. During the war he started, Lincoln actually offered to exchange Southern submission to the North for Northern recognition of slavery on three separate occasions.
Â 
Also, Caesar was far from a "benevolent" conqueror. The Romans ruled their empire by glorified extortion - Cosa Nostra on a grand scale. So long as conquered provinces surrendered tribute (money, produce, slaves, etc.), Rome would spare them. If a province ever defied Rome by not rendering tribute, however, then it would be brutally punished by fire and sword. The Romans were not above indiscriminate extermination in order to make a point and crush the survivors' spirits into submission. Caesar, in his conquests of Gaul and incursions into Britain, established the precedent for this imperial system, and set events in motion which would ultimately lead to the downfall of the Republic and rise of the Empire.

Nor is it about applying post-renaissance historical lenses, whether it's France during the terror or America during the civil war or WW2 Germany or anything of the sort. Well-informed relativism is required, and to view the scenario in its historical context, immanent to the world of GOT/ASOIAF. Ancient and Medieval parallels may be found, but they are not that important either. It's fascinating on its own. What I am troubled by is how readily people take these concepts of justice so far removed from contemporary reality and find them not so much a part of a specific fantasy world, determined by its own set of historical conditions but bring them to an abstract, transhistorical level, as if it was even a matter of debate whether the various measures and practices of justice in the world of GoT/ASOIAF are just. The logic is derailed, it flies away from Daenerys and Meereen and finds its home in eternity and the humankind that is not fantasy.

It is not wise to relate to any character's moral objections, or to whatever ethics they have or politics they enact. You are on your own, transcending them, you don't need a champion in that grey, bleak, horrible world. Barristan or any one character has the capacity to temporarily speak things that you agree with, a detached sentence here, a good observation there. But his world is separate from yours, and their thoughts, though comprehensible to you, are not the wisdom of the ages, their actions not the struggles of planet earth.
6051	teemo	2014-04-29	Hey, at least Barristan (who viewers know is really moral and noble) made a comment about it, making her decision a little more ambiguous. Â Now we'll see if they make her have that brief moment of sort-of regret for what she did. Â

That's my point. If someone justifies her actions by real life morals than you have to take real life examples as counterargument. This is not about the character itself but about the people justifying it for real.

You see what I mean, teemo has the appropriate manner to look at the scene. You apply your own, contemporary judgment, while understanding context of the fictional world, and make comparisons between characters. To take a judgment that one of the character's makes, and then pondering whether it's just or not, in general, that is when the nightmare swamp of folly wraps around you and you don't know you're living in 2014 anymore.
6055	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-29	I wonder when she is hanging her bloodriders and Jorah for their past slaver crimes.
Oh wait. The girl is an hyopocrite.
Lets see how D&D whitewash how she profits when many of this slaves want to sell themselves back....how she lets them, but TAX them putting half of the slave traffic money into her poket. 
I bet my house they wont show that.
6056	Indigocell	2014-04-29	Â 
at this point in the books she hadn't either. all that happens in a feast for crows, when she tries to rule mereen and it all goes to shit.


Â 
Dany doesn't appear in Feast for Crows (although the timelines match), and I seem to recall her facing some difficulty even before Mereen.Â  Such as a food shortage for all the extra mouths she decided to take care of along the way.Â  Maybe I am mistaken though.
Â 
What we've been getting of Dany so far has been a glorified, idealized version of the "white man's burden/white saviour complex" where literally every other character has been used to show how much war makes people suffer.Â  Think of Arya, Davos, Theon, Cateyn, Sansa, or any other POV character (and most non pov characters as well).
Â 
I can only hope they are downplaying Dany's mistakes and exaggerating the mistakes of others in order to make their subsequent rise/fall seem more dramatic.

This. Seriously. And yes, she does face difficulties prior to Mereen. She also commits a considerable atrocities in Astapor that are just as brutal, if not more so, than the crucifying of the 163 wise masters. But yeah, my biggest objection to the arc is the white messiah complex they've been feeding us in this liberation arc. Dany's story serves a partial critique of liberalism and colonialism in my eyes, and we don't get any of that here because being portrayed with such little nuance. Like seriously, how can the audience really connect to this struggle when everything is going off without a hitch? We only ever see slavers dying, never the innocents that are massacred and raped as a result of sacking these cities.

Making the unsullied was a pretty long tradition. Who is she punishing exactly?
The killings in Meereen were obviously also just lynchings. Of course all that gets lost since all the slavers are depicted as one dimensional villains.

6071	Maester Murks	2014-04-29	I didn't read the whole thread, so maybe I got nothing new to contribute but I actually thought we were getting a glimpse of Dany's darker side in this episode. Of course the actual Sack of Meereen was rushed as hell, but there was a point made of the cruxification. It was quite graphic (I believe that was the scene that had to be toned down, maybe because of the religious symbolism some viewers might find offensive). And that last shot with Dany on top of the pyramid with the giant Targaryen flag, listening to the screams was definitely a hint to the "mad" part in her. The unsullied friends I watch with were also a little disturbed by that, so i think the actual cruelty of her decision came across.
Â 
Let's see if the atrocities during the sack itself are adressed when Dany holds court. I sure hope so. We know we'll get the goatherd and his daughter, but I think it would add to her "greyness" if we hear about more terrible things than just that.

6076	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	Then nothing would be justice because everyone takes an eye-eye approach in the world of ASOIAF.In broad terms, yeah.

Well most of those were actualltout of revenge, which is my point. Rounding up random people doesn't make it better or even just.
6078	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-29	This inside the episode pretty much confirms the fact that the showrunners were attempting to show her in a more nuanced light this episode. I still find the battles unrealistic, seeing as no innocents are killed on screen in any of these brutal revolutions, and think that Dany has been cheapened as a character due to whitewashing, but I am hopeful that we're on the right track towards getting closer to her much more compelling, much more interesting book counterpart:
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=8kUejZLuJKM
6079	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	To me it seems like:c) Much of the debate is a number of people saying one or more of characters 1, 2, 3, n... have necessarily acted in accordance with justice in scenarios X, Y and Z. Justice regarded, variously, with the lens of a contemporary or historical sense of the notion, or a type of justice that is immanent to the world of GoT and agreeable or consistent in the interpersonal network of characters and scenes.d) And then a number of people saying one or more of characters 1, 2, 3, n... don't need to be just, and the totality of the story is still great and fascinating with them being variously just or unjust. In this reading, characters are gray, 'complex' and not overdetermined by an overarching Will that pardons, blesses and excuses (or vindicts, curses and condemns) what seem like the varying consequences of their actions.For heroes and villains, c) allows for them to be absolutely such, while d) allows for the possibility that there are no heroes and no villains, but also the possibility of gray, 'complex' heroes and villains.For me at least, I don't see much point in identifying with anyone in the books or in the show, or making myself think their apparent good intentions are all that matter. It's very understandable, however, that people spontaneously develop loyalties and have ideas of whose story is going to contribute to greater good or pay off toward the end. This is the domain of heroes, and possibly villains. There may be, after it's all written, such recognizable figures, either archetypal or surprising. We won't know. But the expectations, it seems to me, will continue to underline or affect these debates, until the end is here.

Â 


Â 
It's unconvincing to argue that the loss of the protections of slavery in the U.S. Constitution by the seceded states would have hastened the end of slavery.Â 
Â 
First, the fugitive slave acts in congress were being actively resisted and in some cases, outright ignored in northern states- in other words, the south wasn't getting anywhere near the benefit of the fugitive slave clauseÂ beforeÂ the south seceded.
Â 
With regard to slavery's expansion, being a sovereign nation or nations or whatever the confederacy claimed to be would have given them more freedom to expand slavery than they ever had in the Union. While in the Union, the slave states had to tangle with the resistance of the free states with regard to the status of slavery in acquired territories. Out of the union they no longer had this resistance. The evidence is overwhelming that southern leaders envisioned more territorial acquisitions in Mexico, the Caribbean and even South America and of course such moves would have certainly increased tensions with their northern neighbor and probably would have precipitated a war.
Â 
Finally, those territorial acquisitions for more slave territory wouldn't have been exactly peaceful. It would have been like Dany conquering slavers bay... only, you know, for slavery.Â

6083	Grbauc	2014-04-29	In a show that usually likes gore an unnecesary violence, Daenerys top evil moment feel rushed to me. It seams it was something D&D didnt like to do, but ought to. Unlist to me. What was a huge moment in a book, felt like filler in this episode between Kings Landing and Bran/Jon plot line.
Sadly, Im almost sure the white washing is never going to stop.
Just compare it with how Stannis or Jaime bad moments are happily taken by D&D to be darker, enlarged, and deeper. Or even how they are given new stuff.
I dont like it at all.


You guys read way to much in to stuff.. HBO website has a lot about the scene... (Danerys top eveil moment feel rushed to me) Â top evil moment a eye for a eye my gosh George please put out are next book so people will stop going crazy with silly notions..Â

Yes, but this isn't Schindler, or Jefferson or G. Washington's story, nor a tale about the morals and tales of slavery: it's a subplot in Dany's story. We can see their acts of "justice" as injustice or even tyranny, but we're not meant to cry for the slavers more than we cry for the Lannister soldier who died while fighting in the Riverlands.


Oh my gosh.. a voice of reason in this fast becoming sea of silly notions and the continual idea of people trying to put modern day moral standards into a fantasy world set in the medieval like times w/magic... Â Â
6085	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-30	Anyone who thinks that Dany's last shot on that balcony with a Targaryan flag (red on black) above her and the wings of the harpy showing behind it as we hear scream in the background is a triumphant, or in any way a badass, triumphant image obviously knows very little about recent human history.
Â

Just to be clear, the entire discussion about actual history was started by those defending what Dany did by saying (paraphrased):
Â 

Â 
She only did what all great conquerors did. You should read up on some history

Â 
Numerous examples of conquerors were then given to demonstrate that the great conquerors did no such thing.
They either:Â 
a) chose absolute clemency
 specifically targeted justice against seditious individuals, or
c) chose absolute destruction, or subjugation with a new government left in place to maintain controlÂ

Thank you. Seriously, that's what I said too. If someone starts to rationalize her actions by real life examples then no one should be surprised if they get real life analogies. Again, this is not about a fantasy world or Dany as a character but real life people justifying such actions for real.

Which would have made sense if he even mentioned or defended Stannis.
6093	ovis alba	2014-04-30	Dany vs. Stannis is an intersting thing though when talking about justice, because to me they are the 2 sides of the same medal.
Dany doesn't seem to care much about the official law but about what she feels is morally right, while Stannis is all about the law and by the book stuff and does pretty much leave his own opinion and personal feelings about it out of it.
In addition both have their side-kick with the criminal background and I feel their different approaches with "justice" are reflected pretty nicely in how they treat them. That's why I also totally need Dany and Stannis to meet.

6096	KingSlayer510	2014-04-30	In a show that usually likes gore an unnecesary violence, Daenerys top evil moment feel rushed to me. It seams it was something D&D didnt like to do, but ought to. Unlist to me. What was a huge moment in a book, felt like filler in this episode between Kings Landing and Bran/Jon plot line.
Sadly, Im almost sure the white washing is never going to stop. 
Just compare it with how Stannis or Jaime bad moments are happily taken by D&D to be darker, enlarged, and deeper. Or even how they are given new stuff.
I dont like it at all.
I don't think it was rushed at all, if anything they delayed it a bit just so Ser Barristan could advise her on justice and mercy, which she of course ignored. I believe this scene is important because it shows that Ser Barristan, who is all too familiar with the madness of Targaryans, is concerned Dany might be becoming like her father. In the books Barristan doesn't reveal himself until the siege of Mereen has already started, in part because he wanted to see if Dany was just another crazy Targaryan before he pledged his service. 
I believe this scene was included in the show not just to show Dany's 'justice' but also to make Barristan apprehensive about her rule, and give him reason to hold his tongue on what he knows about Ser Jorah until the end of this season presumably. This scene was not rushed and is important because it affects Dany character plot lines for the rest of this season.

Â 
You chatter like a magpie with less sense.
Â 
We see a crucified child but it's not like the books: she's not disemboweled and we only see one. But you don't complain about that. We see a bunch of men being crucified, Barristan arguing against it but that's not enough for you. What do you want? To have Dany cackling in the background? Eating the hearts of a few Great Masters as she watches their executions?Â Â 
Â 
The slavers are scum because they live in Slaver's Bay in the Gulf of Grief. The Gulf of Grief! The insane logic comes from you people that think there were innocent Great Masters or slavers like "Oscar zo Schindler mo Loraq". Or in Astapor there was a farmer who brought his first tokar the day Dany sacked the city.Â 
Â 
I don't care she slaughtered all of those people. I, for one, welcome our new Targaryen overlords.Â

this! The scene served its purpose in the show, which was showing Dany not heeding her advisers and serving eye for an eye justice, however you may feel about that. I also got a strong Riefenstahl Triumph of the Will-vibe from that last shot of Dany standing below the Targaryen flag with the screams ecchoing over Mereen. I think the showrunners did a good job of showing both Dany's powerful moment, while also planting seeds of doubt in the viewers heads about her as a leader.
6099	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-30	Oh my gosh.. a voice of reason in this fast becoming sea of silly notions and the continual idea of people trying to put modern day moral standards into a fantasy world set in the medieval like times w/magic... Â Â 


I personally don't have all that many qualms regarding her crucifying the 163 Masters. It makes sense given the established cultural ideology of this fictional period. My problem is simply that in any of these three slave revolts Dany has led in Season 3 and 4, we only ever see slavers getting murked during the conflict. Honestly, can you ever imagine sacking a city without having a substantial amount of innocent life destroyed in the process? Hell, it even conflicts with Jorah's speech back in Astapor where he talks about the day Tywin sacked King's Landing. It's not about whether it's right or wrong for her to invade these cities, (I think her intentions are noble, though too idealistic and misguided), but rather, that because these visual representations fail to show us the brutality of the conflicts in terms of how they effect the smallfolk, we're left with Dany the superhero killing bad guys, rather than Dany the liberator freeing slaves, though at great cost. Like seriously? A bunch of slaves without armor leading an internal revolt in Mereen without even a single on screen casuality? I don't think budgetary reasons are a proper excuse because we at least see the aftermath of plenty of battles throughout the series. Dany needed to be confronted with the brutal reality of sacking these cities so that she can confront her own self-doubts, so that she can become a fully three-dimensional character instead of an immaculate white messiah figure (which personally is making me increasingly uncomfortable). In the books she has members of her own army, guilty of looting and raping, executed and gelded, which shows that these invasions are not supposed to go as incredibly smoothly as they do on television. It's not even about just about making Dany's arc more grey, so much as its about staying true to the gritty realism of Martin's world.
Â 
Now, granted, I think the crucifying in this episode was done quite well, and it was given to us in a way that is nuanced, yet still a darker turn for the character. I honestly think scenes like this are the sorts that I would have liked to see with Stannis. Rather than burning an innocent alive for bullshit reasons, we have Stannis of the books burning Alester Florent for trying to broker peace with the Lannisters and sell them back Shireen, as well as establish prosperous winds in order to reach the Wall in time. He may well deserve to be executed, but does he deserve to be burned alive? Not in my view. And yet this conflict sets us in a place where we sympathize with both Stannis and the man that he's condemned, rather than the television's rendition of Stannis the religous puppet burning infidels willy nilly. In Dany's case, it would have been just to execute those responsible, but she goes a step further by having them crucified without any sort of trial or second thought. Barristan understands that these slavers may well in fact deserve to die, but sees the potential ramifications of these actions, which are driven in no small degree by vengeance (not that you can blame her after seeing all those murdered children). The reason that I take issue with the series' adaptation as of late, is because the showrunners have displayed the ability to convey moral ambiguity fantastically, but the nuance just doesn't seem consistent enough across character arcs. This is where the charges of bias come from, because whenever they streamline something with Stannis, its in a way that makes him look utterly evil. Whenever they streamline something with Dany, it's in a way that makes her look like Clark Kent/Jesus. I absolutely love both characters in the novels, which is why I'm disappointed that the series has cheapened them both by giving us such lopsided depictions, rather than working harder to sustain the atmosphere of nuance that makes them both so fascinating.
6100	Talking Hodor	2014-04-30	She made a political mistake. Nonetheless, she may still have had an insurgency in real life, no matter how merciful she had been to the slavers.Â  Look at Iraq and Afghanistan.Â  No matter how much infrastructure rebuilding funds the West throws at those two countries, they'll still be fanatics out there ready to bite the hand that feeds them.Â  There truly are people as awful as the Slaver's Bay masters in real life.
Â 
She burned Mirri Maz Dur in a pyre alive, roasted Kraznys and took his dragon, and nobody bats an eye.Â  She crucifies 163 a-hole slavers and the entire forum freaks out!
6101	Talking Hodor	2014-04-30	That's why I also totally need Dany and Stannis to meet. 


Pretty sure that would result in Stannis jerky and give Drogon a stomach ache.
6102	thor2006	2014-04-30	Â 
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were slavers, too. Â Holding slaves in a slave holding society is a very low threshold for being randomly killed if you ask me.


When the slavers are just as depraved as the ones in SB yes.
6103	Belisarius09	2014-04-30	Then nothing would be justice because everyone takes an eye-eye approach in the world of ASOIAF.Â 


Not everyone. Â Not the Starks.
Â 
Nothing would be justice because everyone does it? Â Just because one person jumps off a cliff doesn't mean you should join them. Â Conformity =/= an argument you want to make. Â 
Â 
Two wrongs don't make a right, an eye for an eye leaves the hold world blind. Â Revenge =/= justice. Â Its really not that complicated. Â 
Â 
TRUE, Westeros is for the most part a very unjust place. Â But that doesn't excuse your actions, just because people around you are begin shitty doesn't mean you get a blank check to be as shitty as you want too. Â 
Â 
Justice is rare, and thats a tragedy. Â Only the Starks and to a limited extent Stannis are just. Â When Dany does something unjust it should not be celebrated. Â It should be decried. Â
6104	Metopheles	2014-04-30	Not everyone. Â Not the Starks.
Â 


Please!?!?!
They are like the biggest when it comes to eye for an eye moral
6105	Belisarius09	2014-04-30	I just rewatched the scene. It was short but I wouldn't say "rushed." I mean, we see a nail go right through a hand. the music is dark. There is screaming. My sister hasn't read the books and she hated it. Likes Dany, but hates that she did it. I think it will have the intended effect (although in the books I'm pretty much of the opinion that this isn't a bad mark.)
Â 
Eh that's iffy to me. There's really no due process at all in this world other than Tyrion's trial, and since we know he didn't do it that's not justice either. I don't remember Dany charting a constitution that says anything about due process or trials. She rules the city, she makes and enforces the laws, and she punished slavers for the deaths of children. It was justice.


I agree the show did a good job for once of portraying the darkness of Dany's choice. Â 
Â 
Your second paragraph though.....
Â 
You bring up due process in Tyrion's trial, and then say since we knew he didn't do it it wasn't really justice.... one step at a time here, are you talking about due process, or are you talking about justice? Â Justice means he receives due process. Â Justice doesn't mean the guilty party is always held accountable. Â 
Â 
As I've said before, just because there is a general lack of due process, or not many people practice it in the world of westeros doesn't mean it doesn't exist or make it ok. Â As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence, these are natural rights, "UNALIENABLE RIGHTS" they exist regardless if there's a written constitution spelling them out or not. Â They are not just some words on a piece of paper somewhere. Â These are rights we are all born with. Â We all have a right to due process. Â 
Â 
Just because Westeros doesn't have our constitution, enlightenment has taught us we all have these natural legal rights. Â You should understand this. Thus you should look at dany's decision with distaste. Â 
Â 
Like I said though, I agree with your first paragraph. Â The show did a good job of portraying the darkness of the scene. Â And thats what this thread was initially about. Â

6110	mankytoes	2014-04-30	I'm pretty sure it wasn't that heavily emphasised in the books either. Dany just kicked some arse again, and her haters don't like it, again.
6111	Seneti	2014-04-30	I feel the point of the scene was just as much to establish Dany as a very emotional ruler, as it was to show her "evil moment" as OP calls it. In the previous episode Tywin was schooling Tommen on what makes a good king, and it wasn't a just king or someone who answers "injustice with justice", but one who listens to their advisers... And Dany doesn't really do that - in the show so far that is.


Â 
Nice catch!
Â 


This inside the episode pretty much confirms the fact that the showrunners were attempting to show her in a more nuanced light this episode. I still find the battles unrealistic, seeing as no innocents are killed on screen in any of these brutal revolutions, and think that Dany has been cheapened as a character due to whitewashing, but I am hopeful that we're on the right track towards getting closer to her much more compelling, much more interesting book counterpart:

The thing is, Lord Karstark wanted 'vengeance' and killed two random Lannisters for the deaths of his sons. He even says its vengeance not justice.
The Starks wanted the actual person responsible to pay. This is justice.
Dany selected 163 people at random. The show has already demonstrated that random punishment is vengeance not justice.

Just...how is burning a person just. This can only come from an ignorant fool who never felt what it is like to have part of your skin burned off. Or a monstrous wolf savaging soldiers. And those are only the methods, not even speaking of why they do it, the causes.
But lecturing other people about how the actions of Daenerys are unjust and crazy, insane..
Â 
Have fun.Â 


You'll note I said "to a limited extent Stannis."Â  Now you're just jumping to conclusions man.Â  I've never defended Stannis's burnings.Â  That would fall under the category of injustice because its "cruel and unusual punishment."Â  Crazy, I can apply the same rule of law to different sets of facts.Â  Its almost like thats how people do it in real life.Â 
Â 
You don't know the first thing about me.Â  I liked Dany quite a lot as a character earlier on.Â  This act in particular I take issue with, as should everyone.Â  I didn't ever say her "actions" I never used the plural, I'm only talking about this one specific event.Â  So crazy since this whole thread was about said specific event.Â 
Â 
If we're throwing words around like ignorant then it would seem that term applies to you.Â  You're being ignorant of Dany's faults while holding those same faults against other characters.Â  I'm applying my rule to all characters equally.Â  Scandalous!!!! I must be a troll!!!!Â  I used logic to outmaneuver you not once, not twice, but three times now!!! I must be hacking.Â

Oh, and about the imprisonment.... Jaime was being fed and watered. It was only Varys sneaking water to Ned that kept him alive.


Â 
This sounds like a potted plant..watered. 
Â 
You forget a major point: Ned was a traitor. he openly did a coup d'etat. He tried to usurp the throne for someone. He wanted to lock up cersei and her children. If he was right or not does not matter. He openly did high treason. He should be grateful that Janos didn't execute him on the scene.
Â 
Jaime was just leading an army. he didn't do any crime against them in that moment. He was terribly mistreated by the Starks and ended up being maimed by their crazy dog

Â 
Well there was blood. There was so much blood, it even reached the walls..
6129	GallopingGhost	2014-04-30	Justice is not a black & white issue. There are all forms of justice and all sorts of ways for justice to be defined. Punishment for wrongdoings can be justice. The Starks behead someone. They are not trying to teach that person a lesson, make them change their ways and be a better person. The death penalty is retribution. It is also a deterrent against others who may perform a similar crime.
Â 
Anyway, the topic started by calling the crucifixion of 163 slavers evil. I do not consider what she did as evil. Call it what you want...vengeance, justice, retribution, a message, part of war...but it wasn't evil. It also depends who you ask. I'm sure the families of the crucified children would call it justice as would many slaves. The slavers would most likely disagree.

The Great Masters thought they are untouchable and no one could do them anything. They thought they would get away with it.
The crucifixion of them proved them wrong. It set a symbol.
It was their trade, their way of doing it. Daenerys and the slaves taught them otherwise.
It set a symbol that the Masters suddenly are no longer untouchable. They are no longer above the law. They are no longer absolutist rulers.
Â 
She had to send a symbol. Nowadays you use the media to demonize criminals to send a symbol that it is wrong. You punish them publicly just the same as it was done in the medieval when people were brought to the pillory.
Send a symbol of justice and fear towards those who want to do the same crimes.

How did the Starks mistreat Jaime? Â Are you talking Show or Book?
Â 
In the Books, Jaime starts off in a Tower Cell with a nice view (later offered to Catelyn Stark after her treason). Â He gets moved to the dungeons only after being involved in an escape attempt that resulted in [Tully] fatalities. Â In the show, Jaime is kept in fresh air until he tries to escape by murdering his own cousin (a fellow captive).
Â 
In the book, Jaime is maimed by his father's sellsword band as a show of loyalty to its new employer, Roose Bolton. Â In the show, Jaime is maimed by a Bolton man with personal issues. Â Based on Robb's willingness to execute Karstark for murdering captives, it doesn't seem like Robb would condone Locke's action, since "dead or alive" doesn't include "and mutilate for sport if he annoys you."

None of that worked though. The killings of the Unsullied by the Sons of the Harpies showed the slavers weren't afraid of Dany's retribution.
6135	DaveyJoe	2014-04-30	Just like the books, the show will have viewers that are critical of her decisions, and those who are totally fine with them.Â  I think it would be a disservice if D&D went too far in the white or black direction and told us what to think of Dany, let the viewers decide, like GRRM does in the books.Â  I for one think Dany has been kind of annoying since the 2nd season, and I love her chapters in the books.

That's right.
But the Sons of the Harpy were to be expected. There is always a small group or larger group that still cling to the old ways. I mean there are thousands of full Â blown racists still out there and people who would want slavery back, even if it is against the law and zeitgeist.
But the majority is changed. And Dany needs to give it more time. You can't change a culture in a year. Gandhi or Suu Kyi didn't change their culture or regimes in one year. They spend decades doing it.
But you have to start somewhere.
And Daenerys gave the slaves a symbol of hope. Even if it may have failed big time. New slave revolts will come. They saw it is possible. The image and the illusion of the untouchable masters is broken. We should not ignore this small achievement.
6138	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-30	They do that with Stannis, so I'm used to it by now 


Seriously man. Still hopin for that turn around later this season though!
6139	The Silver King	2014-04-30	I actually thought the "evil moment" was fine. Dany was even pulled aside by Barristan and chose to crucify the slavers anyway. I mean we even had Dany perched at the top of a pyramid overlooking Meereen, targaryen banner flying just chilling listening to the screams of all those slavers. Maybe the Dany haters would of been pleased if she was also strangling a puppy in that scene.
Â 
I do agree that the way she took the city was a bit too clean though. Sacks aren't pleasant and even if you're taking a city with good intentions they are still messy and I really hoped we could of seen that.
6140	MoIaF	2014-04-28	Aside from the awesome reveal at the end one of the themes of the episode was justice vs. revenge.
Â 
The opening scene of the episode is Dany taking over Meereen and answering "injustice with justice", however, it could also be considered an act of vengeance on Dany's part in response to the crucifixion of the slave children.
Â 
In King's Landing we have Tyrion's trial about to begin, this as well is a case where justice and vengeance are intertwined.
Â 
Finally, at the Wall Jon gathers volunteers to take down the mutineers at Craster's and not only eliminate them as a thread as they might align themselves with the Wildings but also the seek justice/revenge for the murder of Lord Commander Mormont.
Â 
What are your thoughts?
6141	Charles Phipps	2014-04-28	I think it's a definite theme developing with Daeny that the two aren't so easily separated as people might think.

Â 
Honestly, we see it throughout the story. The implementation of justice in our modern world is suppose to be blind but even now with all our enlightenment that's a difficult standard to maintain and we don't always succeed at it.
Â 
In Westersos we see very little instances if any of justice being blind. Even Ned's beheading of the deserter is not really justice, Ned beheaded him because he broke the law. However, after what the poor man had seen, it was justifiable.

Â 
She is, however, for all those people who yell whitewashing of her character in the show (I call BS on that) I thought it was a bit of a blackwashing. In the books Dany is a low more contrite about what happens and she definitely doesn't feel the constant confidence displayed by her TV show counterpart.
6145	Queen of Whores	2014-04-29	Dany crucifying the slavers was pure vengeance. Jon wanting to march on Craster's was justice, as well as pragmatism. An interesting parallel if deliberate by the writers.
6146	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	We only know she's a bit more contrite (though I'm not sure I agree with that) because we have her POV...

Â Depends on the definition you use for justice.Â  In one sense, they did get what they deserved...which is why I think it is an interesting set of story lines they are building.Â  The punishment she gave them matched, exactly, the punshiment they meted out onto the slaves.
6149	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	The punishment matching the crime =/= justice.

Â 
Is it justice? Jon clearly says in the episode that they must avenge Mormont, how is that justice? Shouldn't the mutineers be tried before the punishment is dealt.
Â 
What Jon is doing is not very much different from what Dany is doing.

6152	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	The mutineers' guilt isn't really in any doubt nor is it possible to try them. However, most importantly Jon merely uses revenge/justice as a rhetoric device (and secondary motive) to gather troops for what is an act of necessity first and foremost.

As rewarding as the beheading of Slynt was, I wouldn't consider it justice. Did he get a trial, did he get a chance as Jon did when he attacked one of his superiors.

Justice would be a swift execution. To the point and no dwelling on it. Anything that exceeds what is necessary (their death) is needlessly cruel and vindictive, since at that point you aren't interesting in serving fair justice, but satisfying your own want for vengeance and bloodshed. Â

It was a righteous sort of justice for Dany. In her mind she was getting justice for each of the children's that were crucified, however, there are elements of vengeance without the justice because of the manner in which the justice was dispense (i.e. and eye for an eye).

No really, if you had to witness those poor children dying on the cross every mile you would want the people who did that horrific thing to them to suffer the same fate. The punishment should match the crime when dispensing justice. We still use that metric in modern times.

That's true,Â but that's also not what I said.Â  I didn't say an eye for an eye, I said they got what theyÂ deserved.Â 
Â 
based on their social status as the slavers, they got what they deserved.Â  it can be argued that Dany, even though she isn't doing it from this perspective, was just meting out distributive justice.

I for one do not ever want to see a person raped or mutilated like they may have done to their victims. I don't care how horrendous their crime is, IÂ neverÂ want someone to be violated like that. It's just purely wrong, with no justification but the "eye for an eye" philosophy, which is deeply flawed and problematic. And we still use this metric in modern times? I don't think I've seen any examples of this. The most severe punishment in most countries that still use it is the death penalty, which is usually an injection which essentially stops their heart and puts them to sleep. I personally am against even this, but I'd much rather if we were to have to dispense death to those accused of terrible crimes, I'd rather a more merciful and quick death than a long, painful one. We don't see people who have raped get raped as punishment, do we? And when you look at places that operate under Sharia law, is stoning a woman to death a just punishment for something like adultery (which shouldn't even be a crime anyway)?Â 
Â 
And as horrific as seeing the crucified children would be, I could never bring myself to coldly order the horrifically slow and agonizing deaths of anyone. Maybe I'm too soft, but such things make me feel sick.

I agree completely that the severity of the punishment against drug-related 'crimes' is ridiculous.Â 
Â 
I never said that rape doesn't occur in prisons. Obviously it does. I meant that the government and law (aka the people responsible for handing out the punishment) do not use such methods. What happens inside prison (the punishment that has actually been dealt them) doesn't have anything to do with what the government has decided to use as punishment.

You understand you've made my point about Jon seeking justice as much as vengeance, right? They killed Jon's brothers as well as his Lord Commander, people he had lived with and served.
Â 
In reality Jon's emotional attachment is much greater than Dany's, as he knew the people that were killed.

Her arc could be a historico-political Bildungsroman, as she moves her wayward tribe that gradually increases in number, from a geographically desolate area to arable land. Consider someone from Dorne wedded to a Thenn beyond The Wall and have them return to civilization. From an immature chieftain to an immature tyrant, and onward onward, Daenerys the Conqueror...

6173	Suzanna Stormborn	2014-04-29	Â 
Is it justice? Jon clearly says in the episode that they must avenge Mormont, how is that justice? Shouldn't the mutineers be tried before the punishment is dealt.
Â 
What Jon is doing is not very much different from what Dany is doing.


Yes I completely agree, Jon wants to kill these people to avenge Mormont and to save his own neck at the wall (along with his brothers) so that mance doesn't find out he was lying about the number of brothers there are. Â Jon is not going on a justice journey. Â The masters of mereen killed 163 children unprovoked. Â Dany hadnt even gotten there yet. Â It was a stupid move on their part to piss her off like that. Â She gave them back exactly what they did to the children. Â Would that hold up in 2014 court? NO, but that is not what we are talking about so there is really no reason to bring our politics into her situation. There is no court for her, just like there is no court for the Masters treating their slaves how they do, and killing their children. Â There is nothing wrong with what she did.

Doing to your enemies exactly what you loathe them for, to me is somewhat wrong. I'm not much of an "eye for an eye" type of person.
6175	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	Good thing about GRRM with regard to internet forums is he knows how to tickle all kinds of personalities and bring them out to express their affinities and allegiances 'free' of the inconvenience of contemporary conventions. A whole spectrum of ethics are mirrored in the audience. Occasionally it is frightening, occasionally endearing..
6176	sj4iy	2014-04-29	That's true,Â but that's also not what I said.Â  I didn't say an eye for an eye, I said they got what theyÂ deserved.Â 
Â 
based on their social status as the slavers, they got what they deserved.Â  it can be argued that Dany, even though she isn't doing it from this perspective, was just meting out distributive justice.


Â 
Because everyone who takes up that lifestyle in a country where it's either 'be a slaver' or 'be a slave' is automatically guilty by association, right?

I guess you would agree with the Reign of Terror in France where aristocrats were beheaded because, based on social status, they deserved it?

2. She was making a point. Read up on some conquerors and leaders of the past and the things they did to strike fear into their enemies.


Â 
She was making a half-hearted point.Â 
Â 
Here are some 'conquerors' to read up on: Gaius Julius Ceasar, Augustus Aurelian "Invictus Restitutor Orbis" (Unconquered Restorer of the World), Tamberlaine. These three people had one thing in common. When a city submitted to them, they accepted it and took NO punitive action. If, once they left, the city revolted again, they returned and destroyed it. In Aurelian and Tamberlaine's cases, theyÂ wiped the city off the map.
Â 
When Augustus Aurelian became Emperor, Rome consisted of Italy, the Med islands, the Balkans, Greece, western Turkey and North Africa. North Africa was in open revolt. By the time he finished he added Spain, Gaul, Britain, all of Turkey, Egypt, and Syria. Every city that bent the knee, he allowed stand... until he came to Palmyra. Once there he executed all the leaders (a half-measure) then left. Within months Palmyra was in revolt again. Aurelian returned and destroyed it. Stone by stone. And the oasis itself was destroyed so the trade routes were diverted. Display of clemency: no problem. Complete destruction: no problem. A punitive half-measure: problem.
Â 
Compare that to the Battle of Caudine Forks. A Roman legion was trapped in a gorge by a Samnite general. The general sent a message to his father asking what to do. His father replied "set them all free". The general thought that was unusual so he sent another message to his father to clarify. This time the reply was "Kill every single one". While the general sat in confusion, his father arrived and the son again asked for clarification and his father said "Kill them all, or set them all free. There is NO middle ground."
Â 
So the general took the middle ground.
Â 
He set the legion free, but forced them to march 'under the yoke' as they left - a sign of vast disrespect and an extreme shaming.
Â 
This caused resentment and resolve amongst the Romans and when they built up strength again they struck back and eventually crushed the Samnites. Taking the middle ground didn't work.
Â 
Recognising the Samnites as first class warriors though, the Romans then made the same damn mistake. They wanted the Samnites as soldiers for the legions, so they granted the Samnite peoples non-voting citizenship. Â This was a half measure. A couple of generations later, the Samnites rose again demanding full rights because it was their sons bleeding for Rome. They marched on the city and met the hastily constructed Roman army at the city's Colline Gate. It took nothing less than a desperate and skillful move by Marcus Crassus (the guy from the Spartacus TV series) on the right flank to win the battle for Rome. 70,000 lay dead at the gate of the city.
Â 
So what did Rome do to these traitorous people having defeated them? They granted them full voting rights. The Samnites never rose again.
Â 
-----
Â 
Dany could have taken the 'Kill them all' position, but she didn't.
She could have taken the Selmy position, but she didn't
She could have found the actual people responsible for the 163 slaves, but she didn't
Â 
She did what the general at Caudine Forks did - a punitive half measure that was neither just nor will it 'teach them a lesson'

Tywin did the 'kill em all' to the Rains, then all he had to so was pay a single minstrel to walk around after that. He didn't so a Dany and randomly kill a few of them then leave the rest to stew in resentment.

It still doesn't mean that they were the ones who committed the atrocities. Â There are good and bad people in EVERY social class. Â There are evil slaves and good masters and vice-versa.

Indiscriminately picking out 163 people just to match the number of dead slave girls is NOT justice. Â It's vengeance, and vengeance is no way to rule any city. Â If she wanted justice, then she would have held trials and judged each Master for his own crimes and not the crimes of others.

If she wants to be Queen, then she should be the one judging these people (or she should appoint someone she trusts to do it). Â I completely understand that it's not a democracy, but she needs to learn to fairly apply punishment and mercy upon those who deserve it.

So she should have had a sham trial because there is no way to prove anything one way or another vs. dispensing justice to 163 murdering slavers. Okay.
6191	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	Even with no jury and herself as a judge, I'm sure the Masters could try and defend themselves and witnesses could be found. Those who were genuinely not that bad would probably find newly freed slaves, or middle level citizens to back them up. I assume the actual crucifying was done by slaves or at least not nobles anyway so they would be a start as witnesses

Barristan said in the show to Dany that they are her subjects however this is wrong as Dany initially didnt conquer Meereen to rule there she just conquered there to free slaves and take food for her children, the Meereenese were not Dany's subjects at this point they were enemies in war.

When overthrowing a set-in-stone civilization and culture, there are no trials. Â That doesnt make sense anyway. Â She has no judges, no council set up yet. She just got there, the masters did not give the children a trial, they just killed them for sport and to mess with Dany, that was the only purpose of killing the kids, to mess with Dany. So why should she show them mercy and give them all trials?
Â 
If everything was on the up and up and there were already trials for criminals/masters then she wouldnt even be there overthrowing them. There is no justice for the slaves, there is only slavery. Â The masters must answer for their actions, she is making them answer with minimal bloodshed.

6196	Mad Monkey	2014-04-29	I'm not sure that there is any value in a sham trial (seriously, does anyone think that Stalin's mock trials in the old USSR made a difference?) In fact they might even be worse since there is something dehumanizing and demeaning when the state forces someone to admit to something that they didn't do and then kills them.Â 
Â 
That being said, I think it would have been a good idea for Dany to take the time to sort through the masters before she crucified 163 of them. It's not about justice vs. vengeance but about pragmatism. In the books she asks the masters to forfeit 163 of their number.Â 
Â 
Â 
This creates an opportunity for the most opportunistic, powerful, and dangerous of the Great Masters to take 163 from lesser houses or their political rivals (who may not have even been in power or responsible for the child murders) and have them crucified instead. Among those who died may have even been masters who advocated surrendering to Daenerys.
Â If Dany had done the reaping, she would have had the opportunity not only to ascertain guilt for herself but to familiarize herself with the politics of Meereen and how the Great Masters are.

If you want a more just society, why not already start? Instate laws for the future of the city (or let the slaves instate them) and then judge the masters by these laws instead of randomly killing some of them to match the number that has been killed before.

Justice would be a swift execution. To the point and no dwelling on it. Anything that exceeds what is necessary (their death) is needlessly cruel and vindictive, since at that point you aren't interesting in serving fair justice, but satisfying your own want for vengeance and bloodshed. Â 


Were talking about medieval era where eye for an eye justice was commonplace. If you steal, you lose a hand. If you rape, you are castrated. In this case, masters were crucified in the manner the children were crucified. To me the lines between justice and vengeance are often blurred. True justice is an act that rehabilitates and heals as much as it does punish. From my perspective, Dany's act (as much as I love her) was pure vengeance. There was no attempt at rehabilitation or healing, just retribution.Â

She gives them back what they gave her with the reason of "justice" which means she thinks it was "wrong". But then she "lowers herself" to the same moral standards.
And of course I would complain about the slavers, when it comes to killing people, but the thread is not about if killing people is bad (then Dany and the slavers would be pretty much at the same level now), it's about "justice".
And if you think something is "injustice" you should not claim it is "justice" when you do the same, because that is the very defintion of revenge but clearly not of justice.

No it really isn't. As discussed already above Jon is searching for justice as ell as revenge. The lines are very blurred and he even address the need for vengeance in his speech to the other men of the NM.

Exactly. Â If you swoop and say 'your society is unjust, I'm taking over and fixing it"....then you need to be consistent in how you dispense justice in the new regime unless you burn it all down and start from scratch. Â The way to get the Meereen nobles at least open to the possibility of 'her way' was to show them that her way is better than their way. Â All she showed was power is power, they already know that.
6214	Widows_Blood	2014-04-29	Â

No this is my lofty definition of justice. I was speaking more from a 21st century mindframe. ASOIAF justice is more closely linked with retribution and vengeance than serving any true definition of justice. I guess the only example I could maybe provide is Robb's execution of Rickard Karstark.Â

Morality conversations do not really interest me in relation to these novels, no one is moral, almost everyone deserves to die. Â She has a cause and the GM's dont, she is the hero and they are not, they pissed her off and now they are paying for it.

Â 
Well the GMs had also a cause (Telling Dany to f*** off and leave them alone)Â  and if you don't want to "judge" moral this is as good a reason as Dany's.
6217	MoIaF	2014-04-29	No this is my lofty definition of justice. I was speaking more from a 21st century mindframe. ASOIAF justice is more closely linked with retribution and vengeance than serving any true definition of justice. I guess the only example I could maybe provide is Robb's execution of Rickard Karstark.

Oh I see. 
As to the bolder point I agree to an extent.  In the period in which the novels place (sort of) the application of justice we see is commonplace. As I have stated in numerous occasions the lines are very blurred.

They get no say due to the fact that they all own slaves and kill them whenever they feel like it. No one stands up for the slaves except her. Â Maybe if they had started negotiations with her in a different way none of that would have happened. To simplify; they started it.

I think talking about justice in a different world and time of different moral standards is always difficult, but to me one thing is "consistency" or at least following a certain universal "code".
If you make the law that deserting NW for example is punished with beheading and this is what people know and what is then indeed applied to everyone who deserts, then it's a form of justice to me

So you DO set moral standards, which is "having and killing slaves when they feel like it is bad". Then don't claim you don't.
6223	MoIaF	2014-04-29	Maybe. Â But even in Westeros there is a direct relationship between guilt and punishment. Â They don't cut off your wife's hand if you steal the pig or randomly pick someone from the village and cut their hand off.

And yet Ned's beheading of the member of the NW wasn't really justice. Yes, he followed the law but the man had a good reason to run away.
Â 
In fact had the man had a trial they would have found out about the WW and they wouldn't be in such a bad shape to take care of this imminent thread.
Â 
Going back to your what you said, the GM must sorely have know that if they crucified these children and Dany won the war they would die. They couldn't possibly have believe that they would not have been punish for what they did.

Yes we do know, both in the show and the books we know she makes no attempt to find anything out about who was behind the crucifixion and whether the 163 were involved or not or to what extent. Â The fact that she gets the names of the dead in no way changes that their killing was random.
6236	Suzanna Stormborn	2014-04-29	Then there is not much point in discussing, when you just refuse to discuss one side of a two-side situation?!

Â 
Winterfell, as co-members of the 7K with Dorne should definitely get upset if a foreigner comes in under the guise of honest trade then burns and pillages Dorne, yes.
6241	Little and Less	2014-04-29	I just liked how Tywin told us about what a "good King should be" and now we debate whether Dany is following those lines.Â  I'm learning life lessons all over the place!
6242	ovis alba	2014-04-29	Yes take me on record as not caring at all that the GM's or Slaver's were killed.


Â 
To me it's not about caring, it's more about Dany and why this is a big step towards her "failing" to rule and her having a quiet inconsistent sense of justice and demonstrating it that way is one of the main reasons.
6243	Suzanna Stormborn	2014-04-29	Â

Right...that's why Dorne came to WF's aide when WF was under attack from the ironborn right? in fact why would the ironborn attack WF at all, since they are part of the 7K too?

That seems to be the attitude among many around here that because she hasn't completely ended a centuries old practice in about 6 months or so she never should have tried it.
6245	MoIaF	2014-04-29	PLEASE LET'S STAY ON TOPIC!

A sham trial is better than no trial. Â And if she doesn't learn how to fairly judge people, then she will never become a good ruler.


There are some problems with this assumption. Dany initially conquered Meereen to free slaves and get food she wasn't planning to rule Meereen so why should she give a trial to people she has no intention of ruling. She is basically just at war with them. Keep in mind I am not saying the 163 massacre was a good thing, I am just saying Dany has no reason to give her enemies at war a trial.

Â 
...except for the fact that there are conventions about prisoners of War, even in the world of Westeros and Essos. Â She had already conquered them, this wasn't the same as killing your enemy...it was slaughtering your prisoners.
6250	Mad Monkey	2014-04-29	Those are good points, but I think the goal was to pick them randomly, just like they took 163 random kids. Â She is making a statement.I get that, but I think it's a mistake to use their own tactics against them like this. Poetically it feels good but it's so risky that it's almost not worth it. It's kind of like if, as poetic justice, Jaime tried to kill Aerys by setting off wildfire in the Red Keep. It would be poetic to have him killed by the weapon he tried to use to wipe out an entire city but the end result would have been disastrous for everyone, not just the Mad King. Similarly, Dany's actions while entering Meereen were poetic but they were risky.The trials would have been worth it. Not because she could have really given perfect due process but because she needed to know how Meereen worked in order to rule it and this was the best way. Instead she threw away her best opportunity to root out and destroy her most vicious enemies and find and empower potential allies among the nobility. It's quite possible -- perhaps even likely -- that some of those who were crucified were chosen because they were out of favor with the ruling elite. That is, they may have died because they objected to the unnecessary murder of so many children on pragmatic grounds (why alienate a rampaging horde at your gates like that?) or because they advocated bending the knee. Some of them might have even been abolitionists though I'll admit it's not very likely.Mereen and astapor are 2 completely different cities, Or should Winterfell get upset when Dorne is under attack?Meereen and Astapor are near each other geographically and both ruled by Ghiscari. It's very likely that Meereenese nobles have relatives and friends in Astapor. You might say, "should Casterly Rock get upset if someone burns down Lannisport?"That's the thing about justice and vengeance though. You never get a blank slate. History and back story are always important. For example, if you look at the evidence cold it doesn't make too much sense to arrest Tyrion for killing Joffrey. Why would he just be standing there holding the poisoned goblet if he was guilty? He would be the first and only suspect. But you have to take into account all of the bad blood between Tyrion and Joff and between Tyrion and Tywin and Cersei. This trial was less about Tyrion's guilt and innocence and all the bad blood that Tyrion had with his accusers. Pycelle's testimony in the books was more about Tyrion's mistreatment of him (taking his poisons) and was likely motivated by the fact that he had Pycelle locked up. That shouldn't matter but it does.
6251	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-29	Right...that's why Dorne came to WF's aide when WF was under attack from the ironborn right? in fact why would the ironborn attack WF at all, since they are part of the 7K too?


Â 
You were talking about whether or not they should be upset. I answered that. It is made quite clear in the books that Dorne doesn't have the population to support any kind of offensive military operations.
Â 

Â 
So because it didn't work very well, no one should try? (paraphrased)

Â 
That is not what anyone is saying at all. She tried three different methods. None of them end slavery. All were doomed to increase the suffering of everyone. Killing the random 163 out of retribution achieves nothing.
6252	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-04-29	Dany is confusing punishing her enemies with dispensing justice. All she knows is that "the Wise Masters crucified those children." She has no idea if the decision was unanimous, divided, or maybe even unilateral. For all she knows, she was crucifying people who were uninvolved or even opposed.
Â 
The doctrine of "collective guilt/punishment" was something employed by Nazi invaders to pacify the population of occupied countries. For every Nazi killed by the Polish resistance, up to 400 Poles were executed in retribution. During the so-called "Civil War," Federal troops, to punish the South for the 6% of its citizenry who actually owned slaves, would obliterate entire towns and cities, burning whatever they could not plunder, raping women and children, ransoming the lives of prisoners against guerrilla warfare, and leaving survivors destitute. Sound familiar, "Breaker of Chains"?

No it really isn't. As discussed already above Jon is searching for justice as ell as revenge. The lines are very blurred and he even address the need for vengeance in his speech to the other men of the NM.


Â 
Yes it is, Jon wants revenge against those deserters who killed Mormont... the punishment for a deserter of the Nights watch is death. Good for him that those two elements converge.
Â 
In the case of Dany I agree that those GM deserve some punishment and that she as a ruler can decide which method to use... but she chooses 163 random GM... that's not justice, maybe not even revenge, against who?... an entire class of people?

A large element of vengeance is emotional connection both Ceraei and Jon have a personal emotional connection to the people they want to get justice revenge for. In Dany's case it is her empathy.  She has no personal relationship to those children yet she empathize with the horror of wha happened to them. Of course that empathy leads her to want to seek justice in an equal manner as the children were punished.  
I'm not comparing Jon and Cersei just showing you how your analogy has no basis.

Back to the point of the thread.  These three people are seeking justice, however, they are also seeking revenge. Meaning the the lines between justice and revenge are blurred.  
You want to categorize them by level go for it, it doesn't take away from the all blurring the lines.

Once again, bad analogy.  It would be like the opposing army executing selective members of the government.  The Great Master of Meereen all rule as a council, they were at least complacent in the decision to crucify the children.

Ned quick over it so no he wouldn't be a member of the government.  As much as I love Barristan he stood idle and said nothing while many bad things happened (I understand that was his oath) but I  believe he would understand if he were to be punished.

How exactly doesn't it work? Do you really think ten dissenters would sway the vote? They're a smaller group who vote on policy sure, but it's only a question of size.Â

It doesn't your analogy is silly, and I gave you an example of more apt analogy.  
The problem is that your assertion that there MIGHT have been GM who oppose the crucifixion of children has not more proof than my belief that all GM were compliment in making the decision.  Thus, were are having a circular argument based of suppositions. Like always....
6272	Ankou	2014-04-29	Not really. My point is because we don't know, we can't execute people via legislative act. You need a trial. I'm not presupposing a likelihood, I'm saying we don't know so we can't execute people for it.Â

6273	coatzin	2014-04-29	Once again, bad analogy. It would be like the opposing army executing selective members of the government. The Great Master of Meereen all rule as a council, they were at least complacent in the decision to crucify the children.


Then what about those GM that in fact crucify the children and get lucky enoguh to not get any of the 163 lucky tickets to death...
Â 
Then the blurry line its almost gone in Dany's case... and not in favor of justice
Â 
But then again thin but still there...
6274	MoIaF	2014-04-29	Not really. My point is because we don't know, we can't execute people via legislative act. You need a trial. I'm not presupposing a likelihood, I'm saying we don't know so we can't execute people for it.

But we know they were all part of the ruling council, that's a fact.  They participated in the ruling and the slaving, if they didn't they wouldn't be GM., fact.  Now, you are presupposing that some went against the cx of the children, but you have no proof of this.  Now, I say because because of the fact that they ALL ruled they were ALL complacent in the act, but I can proved that. However, my belief has some basis in fact but yours does not.  If a GM didn't want to be a slaver he could have gone to Braavos. Meereen does not excise in a vacuum.
6275	Ankou	2014-04-29	Now you're looking at a different issue. Being a slaver is punishable by death now? In that case obviously they all get put down. She executed them in a manner that showed guilt for the death of the children however, and that crucifixion is a separate action.Â
6276	ground_control	2014-04-29	I agree that the show makes it seem like Dany doesn't care which 163 people get crucified, but in the books she tells the the slavers to select 163 of their leaders, so it's not as arbitrary. Â It's not exactly a modern (World War II and beyond) war crimes trial, but that *would* take time, and many people believe that "Justice delayed is justice denied."
Â 
Also, in the books, she declares that (other than the 163), no others are to be punished for actions taken before she took control of the city. Â Not too helpful if you are one of the 163 AND you were actually innocent (although there is no indication that anybody crucified was actually innocent), but as far as quickly establishing order and the Rule of Law, I don't think it's too bad (at least by Westerosi standards).
Â 
Also, as seen in ADWD, and hopefully in the show, her actions do cause some people to take react violently, and she gets to show some growth/compassion by how she handles that violence.
6277	MoIaF	2014-04-29	Now you're looking at a different issue. Being a slaver is punishable by death now? In that case obviously they all get put down. She executed them in a manner that showed guilt for the death of the children however, and that crucifixion is a separate action.Â 


Â 
Let me put it this way:
Â 
If there were indeed Great Master who opposed the action of the other Great Master and they had even the slightest bit of foresight to consider that maybe, just maybe Dany would be able to conquer Meereen do you think it would not have been wise for them to free their slaves in a show of good faith towards the abolitionist queen when she was at their doorstep.Â 
Â 
Also to consider, do you think that there were other occasions in which a collective decision had to be made and there might have been disagreement in between the Great Masters? If there had been Great Master that did not feel comfortable with this way of decision making, why did they continue to be Great Masters? If they didn't accept this manner of ruling they would have stopped being Great Master, because they would have understood that they would pay for bad decision. They chose to live with those consequences, you can't now turn around and say they didn't understand the consequences of being Great Masters.Â
6278	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	You're sort of gifting the Great Masters the gift of omniscience, infallible decisionmaking skills and consistent action. As if the people in power weren't people at all, but lines of code that rationalize and act as programmed. Empty agents thoroughly marked by a vague description of what happens under their rule. No doubt they're mostly, if not all, assholes, by Essos standards, and probably full of ideology that deems them rightfully superior and slaves rightfully slaves. As if politicians are exhausted by an image of their politics, and not thrown into a historical contingency where they are as dumb and helpless as everyone else. Does this free them of responsibility? No, but that responsibility is shattered across relations of power, impersonal structures and conditions of their existence. It is indeed in this way that Meereen is not a vacuum but, in your version, the Meereenese are. No doubt a set of possibilities fluctuates around each slaver's actions, and they could go here, they could go there. But this agency is the agency of a subject in a videogame, not a living character.

Please don't twist what I said to fit your argument.
Â 
All the Great Master knew what would happen if the were indeed defeated by Daenerys, I can't believe that a rationally thinking person would not imagine that there wouldn't be consequences to their actions.Â 
Â 
Some of these Masters were some of the richest people in the whole of Essos, if they did not agree with the way their government was run, they could have simply left at any time. They were not slaves. If they chose to participate in their government as it stood then they chose to be responsible for the consequences of said government. In fact, lets make this easier if they wanted to stay in their homeland of Meereen and they didn't like the way the council of the Great Masters worked they could have formed an opposing council.Â 
Â 
Once again, Meereen does not exist in a vacuum there were other sisters of government they could have emulated.Â

It is possible for Tywin to put on one of Cersei's dresses and show up to Tyrion's trial dancing and singing. It is possible for Sansa to start biting her left little finger and gnaw at the flesh with all her vigor and strength. It is possible for Jorah to tell lies to Varys and have him prepare for a dragon attack. What is left out from stating these possibilities is full of thwarting, obstructing influences, an infinite variety of factors and influences. We cannot hope to know them all, or to account for the entirety of them in understanding or judging their actions. But applying a clean-cut rationality, a formulaic calculation of possibilities, risks and probabilities, to clueless, limited, hapless people as we all are, is not wise.

This is the last I'll say to you because I won't be bother with people who refuse to consider that adults in power do think about the consequences of their actions  Anyone, who is I'm the mist of a war would consider the ramifications of their actions whether or not they chose to follow those actions. 
There GM knew Dany had defeated two cities prior to arriving to Meereen, and chose to cx 163 in an effort to deter her.  Now, there are 163 miles between Yunkai and Meereen which gave the GM plenty of time to consider the ramifications of their actions.  They GM weren't inexperience yahoos, they are season businessmen and slavers and as such they understand risk, believe you mean they understood the risk.  
Now, do me a favor and take your ridiculous arguments and post them on another thread.  We are trying to have a discussion about the blurred line between revenge and justice.
6286	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	I'm ok with not continuing. Fictions, stories, novels are fantasy, and the magic of words, images lays before our eyes possibilities, emotions, limits, thoughts, dreams, and we supplement the picture with more of the same. If your preferred style is to supplement it with formulas and the rationality pertaining to economics, not the intricacies of humans, it's one way of reading, I suppose.

6287	Er Rn	2014-04-29	And yet Ned's beheading of the member of the NW wasn't really justice. Yes, he followed the law but the man had a good reason to run away.
Â 
In fact had the man had a trial they would have found out about the WW and they wouldn't be in such a bad shape to take care of this imminent thread.

Re: Ned beheading the deserter. Yes, Gared saw the Others and his companions turned to wights. Yes, he had good reason to run away back to the Wall. He should've gone back to tell the NW what happened, not continue south. Desertion from the NW is punishable by death. Ned doesn't randomly pick 10 runaways to behead.
Back to Dany, I actually think she would've done better to execute all the Great Masters. If it's being argued that they're all evil slavers and deserve to die, why stop at 163? What if #164 was the great mastermind behind the crucifixion of the slave children?
6288	Nictarion	2014-04-30	Agree to disagree, the GM's had it coming, same as the slavers in Astapor. Â i'm glad Dany killed them, 'she deserves her vengeance, and we deserve to die, but then again so does she'--Bud Kill Bill
Â 
Morality conversations do not really interest me in relation to these novels, no one is moral, almost everyone deserves to die. Â She has a cause and the GM's dont, she is the hero and they are not, they pissed her off and now they are paying for it.Love this post!
6289	Suzanna Stormborn	2014-04-30	Love this post!


 Thanks man!
6290	jet199	2014-04-30	I am wondering how many posters think they could have guessed the Other at the end of episode 4 was Night's King even if he had never been mentioned as such by HBO.
Â 
There is usually someone on this forum who can work this kind of thing out.
Â 
In the episode we have a leading Other, who has horn-type-things which look a bit like a crown and he has 12 mates behind him.
Â 
I am thinking that there certainly would have been a debate about whether this Other was connected to the myth of Night's King but I also wonder whether he would have been linked more to the Last Hero.
Â 
What side of the debate would you have been on? Or would you have told anyone claiming it was Night's King that they were definitely wrong and that the whole idea was impossible?
Â 
I like a bit of northern mystery so I would probably have gone with the LH and NK myths and the Other's leadership reflecting each other and the number 13 being symbolic somehow.
6291	ymaface	2014-04-28	This may be a silly question but how does Dany even know what her house sigil looks like (to the exact detail)?
The Targaryen sigil is very detailed and looked perfect on the flag shown but if Dany was ever shown it (maybe by her brother) it would've been when she was very young. Jorah might have known it but surely he was busy doing other things than studying someone else's sigil. 
I just think it speaks volumes about how little Dany really understands about her family. Thoughts?
6292	acosta	2014-04-28	She is with the commander of her father's kingsguard.

6297	Bilbo Baggins	2014-04-28	The Targaryans are/were a very well known house even in Essos. I have no doubt that she could have just asked for a Targaryan flag to be made and people would comply. It may have even been a gift to her from Qarth or even Illyrio. Do you think Dany had to draw out the stencil for the flag herself?

She "sacked" two cities before got there. Probably got enough wood and tools to make catapults. And the Unsullied were working, I guess.

I'm not convinced you didn't just copy that last second from my own post. My only quell with it is that the flag was never seen before (not that it really should have been) and she's not really anywhere where she can just ask for a big fancy flag. More pressingly, I mean how the hell did she get that flag where it is. The flag is sitting on the harpy before Dany even has the city.
6304	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^I guess that was one of the things that Grey Worm and co. snuck into the city. I imagine it would have to be a pretty huge flag and it would also be really difficult to secure it up there, but regardless it was an awesome visual.
6305	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-29	She had a following of thousands of former slaves, sure some of them were capable of sewing a flag. And sure they would be willing to gift it to their Mhysa. It's a hell of a gift.
6306	Envie	2014-04-29	I'm quite sure Ser Barristan would know the sigil of the house he was pledged to and was commander of the kingsguard as well as Ser Jorah Mormont. Lords and Knights are trained to recognize all the sigils of all the major and minor houses. One of them could have helped with the drawing and any number of artistic freed slaves or servants could have made the flag.Â
6307	boojam	2014-04-29	For the reasons others give above.It's amazing we have not seen a 'banner' version of in seasons 1,2 and 3.It's good to finally see a large, what is that? Tapestry of some kind?[Somehow everybody on the show carries around a hidden Portamento, when traveling, be it water, food, money or change of costume... can't account for everything when filming.]

Â Well, she does have dragons which I suppose could be instructed to fly and drop.Â  More likely I'm sure they have some means to have some, say, rope shot over the edge of the statue and then have it lifted up like a curtain.Â

Instantly watching it I thought it would have been more powerful to have Drogon on the top of the pyramid (where he likes to chill in the books) instead of some perfect flag.
As it pans out from Dany have Drogon stretch his wings and eclipse the Harpy, essentially visually replacing it.
How did the flag even get up there? Daario ninja'd it up there?
The whole take over was so glossed over and cheap, as least have a quick montage of Slave Masters being killed around the city so you got a better idea that it was large scale and synchronized.
6314	boojam	2014-04-29	Where were the dragons flying behind he banner is what I want to know...The CGI-VFX for those dragons must be freaking expensive.Episodes where would think they would make a small showing, but apparently didn't fit in the budget.

6316	Tyrion1991	2014-04-29	In the books it is never mentioned or discussed whether Dany or any of Danys army has flags with her house sigil on. To some extent, this might just be that GRRM assumes that the reader can assume that Danys army has this.
Â 
The only instance I can think of is in the preview of the Winds chapter where one banner is specifically mentioned as being carried by her Queensguard.
Â 
In answer to your question. In the second book after the house of undying, Dany mentions the prophecies of dragon has three heads and Jorah tells her that the Targ sigil is a three headed dragon; to which she replies "I know that".Â

Agreed, the visual would have had a much greater impact than the flag. As much as I adore the dragons though, it was worth the CGI cut to see some White Walkers and the direwolves

6319	rmholt	2014-04-29	Maybe Viserys kept a sigil. Barristan and Jorah would know what it looked like. Viserys might have even had a banner but harder to imagine it would stay intact and with Dany all this time.
6320	rmholt	2014-04-29	This is a great opportunity to learn what a trebuchet is. Especially for Dave Barry fans. http://gameofthrones...iege_of_Meereen
People who make them and film them firing apparently need to give a little spiel first. Here's one video http://m.youtube.com...h?v=06P_RNGP8LU
Here's the Monty Python esque versionhttp://m.youtube.com...h?v=hZxCEkGk6HI
Clearly the catapults in a Breaker of Chains use a counterweight on the short arm and a sling containing the projectile on the long arm of the throwing lever, therefore trebuchet.
ETA after re watching it don't know how the he** Dany's catapults/ trebuchets are fired. The axis is so low set I can't imagine where they are hiding the counterweight. It appears the artillery crew is releasing the throwing arm from some opposing force and I wonder what I am missing. Perhaps the mechanism is underground.
It's sad they didn't have flaming pianos.

6333	rmholt	2014-04-30	It's the Westeros thing to fly the flag of the owner, or pwner, of a conquered castle. Not Speer-ish who was more into pageantry. The whole castle would have been draped precisely with Targ colors
6334	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-30	One of the critics in the recap collection up on wicnet complained about how dogy the CGI flag looked - I have just watched again and I thought it looked really good.


Â 
I have seen a few complaints as well.
Â 
One reviewer I have some trust in said "The best CGI they have done is when it is small scale to match the small screen - specific items (direwolves, dragons), back drops when it isn't the main focus of the shot (additions to scenery, buildings), or in the case of Blackwater a night scene when the focus is entirely on the CGI and you don't see much of the real world at all. Dany's shot at the top of the pyramid with the banner didn't fit in with the above 3 categories and I feel didn't work as well on the small screen."
Â 
That argument seems valid and may be the reason some people saw it as not 'quite right'.Â

We had already seen Meereen's scale, this was a perfect place to really hammer down on WOW factor, sort of like the final 'helicopter' shot in S3E4.I mean it looks good , as it is, but could have been pumped CGI-wise to good effect.
6338	House Targlannistark	2014-04-28	In "Oathbreaker", there is a nice scene in my point of view with Jon and Sam discussing and giving each other advise. We get to know that Sam has obviously told Jon abut Bran ging north of the Wall. If I am not wrong, he doesn't in the books. So just to be shure does he or does he not?
Â 
Please don't complain about how it is different from the books!
Â 
Â How do you think it will affect the future of Jon and Brans Plot in the show?
I could see from this point Jon going north, starting a asort of hostage-rescue mission when he gets to Crasters. Or he kills them.
Or perhaps theÂ not-brothers-of-the-nights-watch dies before that, Bran&Co escapes with Summer AND Ghost? Jon gets to an abondoned Crasters Keep?
Â 
giddy up folks!Â  Â

6339	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-28	sam never tells jon he sees bran. he thinks that bran and rickon are both dead in the books after hearing what theon did to them. my guess is that bran and them will escape while the chaos is going once jon arrives at crasters. it would be nice for jon and bran to reunite but i have a hard time believing that jon will allow bran to travel north with the white walkers out there and mance rayders army marching on the wall.Â
6340	Dany's Silver	2014-04-29	The ramifications of Jon knowing about Bran are already being discussed here.Â  Cheers.
6341	CandleWisps	2014-04-29	I don't think that there will be too many ramifications about Jon knowing, considering it is still highly unlikely they will meet in the show. But yes, while I don't have thebooks on me for reference, I'm sure that Sam never told Jon
6342	hollowcrown	2014-04-28	My favourite part of this episodes aside from the big Others reveal was definitely the Jaime - Brienne scenes.Â 
Â 
The actors really bring the characters to life and have believable chemistry and great emotion. The writing in these scenes are top notch and I'm really looking forward to their progression as characters, even though they might not be seeing each other for a long time now.
Â 
What did everyone else think of these scenes?
6343	Charles Phipps	2014-04-28	I think it would have done better without the sept scene.
6344	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	I think it would have done better without the sept scene.


Â 
Yep. If you ignore that scene, then the Jaime/Cersei/Brienne story flows this season.
Â 
As one reviewer I saw put it, In Brienne, Jaime has the sister he really should have always had, in many ways.

					
					
							Edited by Ser Desmond Wine's Bane, 28 April 2014 - 11:56 PM.
6345	Frey Pies	2014-04-29	Honestly, I don't get why some people are saying that it works best without the sept scene. All that scene did was show that Jaime is a lot more grey than expected, and its consequences were easily palpable in the tension between Cersei and Jaime this episode. She calls him "Lord Commander", clearly distancing herself from her brother. Jaime's rape of Cersei was a moment of weakness for him, and he realizes from this (and I hope they address this a little more over time) how bad an influence Cersei is on him.
Â 
In the grand scheme of things, Jaime is still on a road to redemption, wanting to improve himself. After last weeks episode, it seems that he has made decisions on what sort of man he wants to be (compare the scenes from before this episode, where he felt out of place in King's Landing, to the scenes in Oathkeeper). This is why he gives the sword to Brienne.Â 
Â 
Yeah, that's just my take on it. I think they have handled Jaime quite well this season. And, as for this scene, it became one of my favourites of the show's entire run.Â
6346	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	^ Ew no, DONT blame rape on the victim. Jaime did it, not cersei.
I loved the jaime and brienne scenes but I find the sept scene so jarring it's going to pollute jaime for me all season and that FUCKS ME OFF because he's one of my favourite characters.
6347	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-29	TBH, I think that the sept stuff was just badly done, and ShowCersei and BookCersei think about it the same. The "Lord Commander" line was about him not killing tyrion when he had the chance. Could be totally wrong though.
6348	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-29	It *was* done badly, it was done *terribly*
6349	Beorn Snow	2014-04-29	The only possible excuse for the sept scene I could get behind was if the point was to make Cersei more sympathetic. I wouldnÂ´t mind having her more sympathetic in the books too. She is too one-sided, goofy, villain.
6350	Frey Pies	2014-04-29	I'm not blaming Cersei for what Jaime did- you should really become less passionate about it, the scene wasn't bad, it's just people overreacting because of the rape. Â 
Â 
I'm merely saying that Cersei brings out the dark side of Jaime, whereas Brienne encourages him to try and be more honourable. After one final mistake (the sept scene), Jaime has learned to stop being as influenced by Cersei. I believe that the conversation between the two in Oathkeeper was masterful, subtle but with the tension from what happened earlier running through it.Â 
Â 
And honestly, I don't get why some are complaining that Jaime is suddenly back on the good side without any consequences. Of course there aren't many consequences, since the scene only involved Jaime and Cersei, and is not important enough to effect anyone else. As a result, there are definitely consequences for Jaime (just contrast his scenes this Ep. with every other throughout the Season) and Cersei, and their relationship, but not in the overall arch of Jaime. At the end of the day, he is still trying to find a way to salvage as much of his honour as possible, and that is one hiccup along the way. More than anything, that scene was a reminder to everyone that there is nothing like black and white- while Jaime is indeed trying to become good, he is still capable of committing bad deeds.Â 
Â 
It sets up what occurs with Tyrion later on.Â
6351	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	The only possible excuse for the sept scene I could get behind was if the point was to make Cersei more sympathetic. I wouldnÂ´t mind having her more sympathetic in the books too. She is too one-sided, goofy, villain.

Surely there are better ways of making her sympathetic?
6352	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-29	Cercei calls Jaime Lord Commander because at the beginning of that scene Jaime calls her your Grace. And she answers him, sarcasticaly, that he is formal. I don't know why everybody forgets about him calling her your Grace and assumes that she wants to keep him at distance because of That scene.
6353	Darryk	2014-04-29	It was an extremely powerful scene, especially Nikolai's acting when Brienne says "I'll do it for Lady Stark...and for you".
Â 
The episode may have had its flaws but the Jaime-Brienne scenes made it one of the best in the series so far.
6354	rpmaluki	2014-04-29	Surely there are better ways of making her sympathetic?


I don't think it's possible to make Cersei sympathetic.
6355	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-29	This thread shows how the director completely failed last week. Because instead of indulging in and enjoying what were some wonderfully acted and beautifully written scenes between Jaime and Brienne this week, we are still talking about how a horribly directed scene last week affects our view of it. Â Obviously, from Alex Graves' statements and what we saw this week, that sept scene was intended to play out as it did in the book. Â The fact that it didn't is just a complete and utter failure on the part of the director and the show-runners to not step in and correct it before it aired. Â It's really a shame b/c it really marred what otherwise would have been a really excellent episode this week for Jaime.Â 
Â 
I just pretended the sept scene happened as it did in the books and with that in mind, I too loved the scenes between Jaime and Brienne and especially the subtle looks of sadness and anguish they each shared on parting from one another.Â

Yeah, in my mind the sept scene played out exactly like it did in the book. I refuse to let that mess last week sully my love for Jaime's character.
6357	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-29	Someone makes a post about Brienne and Jaime scenes and all you can do is talk about the fucking sept scene as if it hasn't been discussed enough. Fucking hell.
Â 
I thought the Brienne/Jaime scenes were excellent. I saw someone comment that they had wished Jaime would name the sword, but I think I prefer Brienne naming it. It's a bit more powerful when someone so honorable and decent is willing to name a sword for your good deeds rather than doing it yourself. Jaime naming it Oathkeeper is kind of self-validation, like "Hey I swear I'm a good guy now" whereas Brienne doing it sort of takes him off-guard.

Â
6359	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-29	It was one of those scenes that just jumped straight off the page for me. Gonna miss the interactions between those two.
6360	Chebyshov	2014-04-29	This was such a great example of how skilled of a director Michelle Maclaren is. The acting was brilliant and moving in these scenes, and the comic relief of Pod was not overdone. Really just a pleasure to watch.
6361	Sand11751	2014-04-29	One of the things I have long admired about both actors is their ability to convey so much without speaking. Brienne has theÂ most amazing ability to display all her emotions on her face - shock that Cersei realizes her less than platonic feelings for Jaime, surprise that he would give her the sword, annoyance with Podrick at "serÂ - milady". But theÂ best was that farewell look , not only because it betrays the depth of feeling at having to say goodbye and fear that she might not see him for some time, but Jaime responds to it too. For the first time, he has had someone show him respect, not only think of him as the Kingslayer. At least in Brienne's eyes, he's no longer irredeemable. Also, she's the first woman he's grown to respect as well. He lusts for Cersei, but no respect there. He couldn't respect Catelyn either, but Brienne stirs that strange emotion for a woman in him. I don't ship this pairing as much as others, but I really enjoy their chemistry. Â
6362	Conchobar	2014-04-29	I think it would have done better without the sept scene.


I am not particularily bothered by the sept scene, I was more horrified that a young girl was mauled to death by dogs. I don't really pity Cersei in any way, but even still, a girl getting ripped apart by dogs while people watch in amusement is infinitely more horrifying than that sept scene.
6363	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-29	Some of us are concerned more about the effects on Jaime's story rather than fictional brutality, whether that's right or wrong
6364	Terere	2014-04-29	It will be interesting how the story progresses.
					
					
							Edited by Terere, 29 April 2014 - 09:58 AM.
6365	King Tyrion I	2014-04-29	I liked that scene with Jaime and Brienne - and the scene before with Cersei.
Â 
They were perfectly acted.
Â 
And I think "Your Grace" and "Lord Commander" show that Jaime is drifting away from Cersei, just as she is.
6366	rpmaluki	2014-04-29	I love how cold Jaime's scene with Cersei was compared to his scenes with Brienne. The glaring difference between the two women and their effect on him couldn't have been more obvious. I love it.
6367	Kaspiro	2014-04-28	So this episode confirms that Brienne is still being sent on her quest to find Sansa Stark. However, moving forward, I'm not sure where she'll be going. Most of her journey is spent going from town to town and encountering the Brave Companions (which have been cut from the show entirely). Will she still meet Randyll Tarlyor Meribald? I think she definitely has to meet the Brotherhood Without Banners and Lady Stoneheart at some point.Â
6368	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-28	As long as she doesn't repeat "have you seen a girl of four and ten, auburn hair, fair skin..." a thousand times, I'll be fine.
Â 
I think Randyll Tarly is a good possibility. Â And Ser Hyle Hunt.
Â 
I think she'll definitely meet LS. Â Possibly at the end of this season. Â Or next season, if D&D want to have Merrett Frey hung to end this season. Â
6369	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-28	She is going to bight off a man's ear.
6370	Charles Phipps	2014-04-28	I imagine she'll meet Randal Tarly, a couple of bad guys who lead her into a trap (which will be less frustrating), and then Lady Stoneheart.
6371	The Giver	2014-04-28	She is going to bight off a man's ear.


Â 
I remember in the foreshadowing when she was laughing maniacally about that. Yikes. lol
6372	King Tommen	2014-04-28	Neither Randyl Tarly or Hyle Hunt have been cast this season so Brienne won't meet up with them. Hunt is almost assuredly cut and they might have Tarly show up in later seasons when he becomes more active in the story.
Â 
Rorge and Biter are coming back so chances are Brienne meets up with them at some point (probably the ear biting that Christie referenced).
6373	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	Same thing she did in the books...nothing 
Â 
I think Randyll is a must. I'll eat my hat if she doesn't run into Sandor, reborn or otherwise.
Â 
But most of all, I want her to start hearing rumors about a phantom woman haunting the Riverlands, called the Hangwoman (Lady Stoneheart is a lame name, IMO), and to run into some of her hanged victims. That will provide a better sense of mystery and creepiness to her arc, as well as a cool surprise when her identity is revealed
6374	Mad Monkey	2014-04-28	Because Brienne didn't get to achieve too many plot-related victories (I enjoyed watching her vanquishing the Bloody Mummers but honestly the story would not have been that different if she had never run into Shagwell, Pyg, and Timeon at the Whispers, for example), they can change a lot without having to worry about story implications down the road.
6375	King Tommen	2014-04-28	The reborn Hound stuff (whatever that might be) would be in S5 so it's probably not going to be Brienne that has her storyline uncover that.
Â 
Decent chance however with both Arya/Hound and Brienne/Pod on a collision course to the gates of the Vale that they could run into each other or at least have a close call.
6376	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-28	The reborn Hound stuff (whatever that might be) would be in S5 so it's probably not going to be Brienne that has her storyline uncover that.
Â

6377	Gertrude	2014-04-28	Neither Randyl Tarly or Hyle Hunt have been cast this season so Brienne won't meet up with them. Hunt is almost assuredly cut and they might have Tarly show up in later seasons when he becomes more active in the story.


Â 
That's a shame, because I thought that was the most interesting part of her journey. It was good to see Tarly first hand after hearing Sam's story, and Hunt opened up her backstory. Seriously, I will be upset if that isn't addressed in some way. I mean, I guess I will wait and see what they actually do, but i want the audience to know how she's been treated in the past.
6378	skorpion	2014-04-29	I hope Brienne runs into a conflict involving Rorge and Biter that doesn't get resolved (due to interference) until next season. Since she hasn't met them in Harrenhal on the show as far as I can remember.
6379	Mr Smith	2014-04-27	We all knew that the show would deviate further and further from the book as we went on, but I don't know if we expected it to change quite so much quite so soon. As far as I can think, the only parts of this episode that were truly consistent with the books was Brienne's departure and Dany's entrance into Mereen, and even those two were tweaked to varying extents. The rest was pretty much all original content. However these, for me, were the most siginificant:
Â 
Â - Jon and Bran look set to cross paths again. Really don't know what to make of this, and frankly I thought it was clumsy that Jon should know that Bran is still alive. The overall mutineers arc however is a good one IMO.
Â 
Â - Tommen's age change. I believe I'm in the minority in that I like this change. Makes is upcoming kingship far more interesting, and I'm glad they had the decency to pass over any potentially vulgarness between him and Margaery... for now.
Â 
Â - THAT scene. As book readers, you would forgive us for feeling hard done by that after five books, we had never even glimpsed the Land of Always Winter, and yet this gets sprung on us in Season 4 of the show. However, I'm honestly more intrigued than upset. Can't wait to see whether they build on it.
Â 
Opening it up to you now. What did you think of the overall original nature of the show? What further changes could these ones cause? Go nuts.
6380	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-29	it took me by surprise but i really liked this episode a lot. i think they changed the bran storyline bc he can't just wander around beyond the wall until he finds bloodraven for a whole season so we'll so how this plays out. i personally don't think he and jon will see each other, I think bran and co. will escape during the chaos once jon attacks crasters. and i'm with you on the night's king's scene i was real intrigued and i'm anxious to see where they go with that.

i also am in full support of an older tommen, one of the things about the books, for me, was the age of some of the important characters and how they could have the cognitive ability to do some of the things they do...

6382	Envie	2014-04-29	it took me by surprise but i really liked this episode a lot. i think they changed the bran storyline bc he can't just wander around beyond the wall until he finds bloodraven for a whole season so we'll so how this plays out. i personally don't think he and jon will see each other, I think bran and co. will escape during the chaos once jon attacks crasters. and i'm with you on the night's king's scene i was real intrigued and i'm anxious to see where they go with that.


Â 
Â 
This is what I think will happen also. I think they're really pulling out all the stops on the Stark sympathy train here. The viewers just go nuts over all of it because the Starks are so noble and cool and yet they constantly seem to always get the worst of everything. The children all scattered in every direction not knowing if any of their siblings are still alive or not - their parents both dead, Winterfell burned down, it's all been a lot and the show's kept to the story on that true to book for the most part. I don't think they're going to have Jon and Bran meet. It's going to be a bittersweet "almost" thing that viewers will love and hate. Just like when Arya was only steps from entering the wedding feast and being back with her family... it's ripped away from her with the bloody Red Wedding. Bran's going to be right there, maybe even see Jon from a distance, but won't be able to go to him and will instead have to keep heading north on his quest. Bittersweet.
Â 
As for this episode - wow it was just epic. I loved all the changes. That's saying a lot considering how much grief they get for most of the deviations they make from the book. I had absolutely no complaints and this was my favorite episode so far this season.
6383	Lightning Tiger	2014-04-27	Cercei was surprisingly right about Jaime's Security not being enough..... no wonder Joffrey was killed so easily.....
6384	Tiggy4Real	2014-04-27	The Tyrells have money, just like the Lannisters do . . . or somebody was sleep and Margaery was watching
6385	A Man Reads	2014-04-27	Because Margaery was not a security threat. And she is well connected.
Â 
I had the opposite takeaway from it actually. If anything, it shows how unbalanced Cersei has become. Another Cersei scene beginning with the wine.Â
6386	Dain Storm	2014-04-27	Because Boros Blount is a joke.
6387	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-27	Honestly I think Margaery could beat up Borus Blount.
Â 
She is, after all, a full grown woman, and Blount has only ever beaten an adolescent girl (and even that was 2 on 1).Â  She's out of Blount's weight class.
Â 
EDIT:
Â 


Because Boros Blount is a joke.

EXACTLY.

Â 
Exactly.Â  Remember during Ep. 2 we got a solid shot of Meryn Trant leaning up against a pillar NOT DOING SHIT when the assassination went down.Â   Was also too busy keeping that pillar upright to act on Tywin/Cersei's insistence that Sansa be found/the city be locked down.
Â 
The Kingsguard are all Jabronies.Â  That's the whole point, they're less than a shadow of their former selves/reputation in generations past.
Â 
I love "Cersei is crazy/removed from reality" as much as the next guy, but she should freak out over Tommen only being guarded by Blount.Â  One of these clowns is not nearly enough (not that 4 would be, of course, but she's 100% right to think Blount alone is insufficient).

Â 
I imagine the conversation went like this:
Â 
Boros: Sorry, my lady but I have strict orders not to let anyone into the King's chamber.
Â 
Margaery: I'm not 'anyone', I'll be the Queen remember?
Â 
Boros: Oh of course... *Steps aside*
6408	Nordeast	2014-04-28	Margaery is a hot whore and could seduce herself past any of the sorry excuses for Kings Guards that are left at Kings Landing.
6409	Valerius	2014-04-28	Margaery could simply have said, "The King has asked for me." Who is to deny the Queen?

Â 
Either that or she gave Blount some wine or gold coins. Â I have the feeling that Margaery is pretty choosy about who she would offer her physical favors, and Blount would not be on that list for any reason less than a dire emergency.
6411	averde	2014-04-28	He's not 12, he's 16 or something in the show...who wouldn't want to be raped by Natalie Dormer?

Surely you must be joking, perhaps mocking all the people who are suddenly outraged that the series "has too much rape lately" (the show and books bothÂ notorious for the abundance of murder, torture, rape, brutality, and wide variety of sexual scenarios)
6415	HouseHarrison	2014-04-28	The guard was Boros Blount. The Yellow Whale could sneak by that doofus.Â
6416	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-28	Just because Jaime is a terrible kingsguard, his score is 3-0 in protecting kings.
6417	Duckfield	2014-04-28	Because the show writers are stupid and were too lazy to come up with a logical reason to how she managed to get by the guard so they passed it off like it was obvious though it clearly isn't.

If Loras was already in KG (like in the books), and had been on duty, this would have been a much better scene:

Tommen: "How did you get by the Kingsguard?"
Â 
Margaery: "I told my brother I wouldn't hurt you."

Â 
This is what people mean, when they refer to "rape culture."
Â 
I think I know why Tommen was recast/aged up. Margaery is a character that elicits audience sympathy, and the showrunners didn't want to make her look like some child predator.

Blount is LF's man, but LF, at least for now, is allied with the Tyrells. So no, I don't think Marge needed to seduce him to get past him. He knows who he really works for is all.

The show might just use Blount's apparent failure as a guard to turn him into a taster.
Also, they are showing the transition to hatred between Jamie and Cersei, something which happened mostly in thoughts in the books, not dialogue.

Err, what? There was no such scene in the show. They talked, she kissed him on the forehead, she left. So, what do you mean, "the scene where Margaery raped Tommen" - youÂ wishÂ there was one, I guess?...
6436	FloredaA	2014-04-28	Just before this season's first episode, someone asked for a appropriate menu for a dinner with viewing : roast chicken and lemon pies were suggested, and I found it fun to cook this for our dinner on the night we viewed that episode. The shop had a two for one offer, so I ended up roasting two chickens, and guess what, we ate every f** chicken in the room, what a coincidence!
The next week, I guessed pigeon pie would be prominent, and that's what I served my family (there was no wine, though, and nobody died). Last week, I was not home, but obviously, if I'd been able to follow the trend, the menu would have been rabbit stew.
So, can someone tell me what to cook tonight for this 4th episode ? (Only culinary spoilers accepted)
6437	Rhasgul	2014-04-21	So as we all know every episode title has one or even more very straightforward meaning. On the other hand, we can also pretty much always notice some rather hidden meanings behind it. With a little room for interpretation there is lots more we can find out about an episode by it's title than you'd think at first glance.
Keeping in mind where all the storyarcs are at the moment, what could the title be referring to?
Â 
1. Jaime sending Brienne out with Oathkeeper to keep his oath to Catelyn.
2. Jon snow proves himself in a certain way on the wall, proving to be a true brother, able to command troops for the upcoming attack.
3. Daenerys stays true to her word of not harming any of the slaves inside Meereen and tries to take over the city with the least amount of unnecessary casualties (and fails miserably?).
4. I suspect some Petyr-Lysa-ish interpretation as well for some reason put can't put my finger on it
5. ... your thoughts?
6438	Obebb	2014-04-24	If we see Craster's Keep in this episode it could somehow be referring to Rast and Karl and the others who did not keep their oaths
6439	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-24	If we see Craster's Keep in this episode it could somehow be referring to Rast and Karl and the others who did not keep their oaths
Even though Jon's raid to the keep is supposed to take place in the next ep. It would've been an awesome tie in for this one, with Jon going all out Ned on the deserters and having an Edd fetch me a block moment on Rast
6440	Sirar Salih	2014-04-24	I think you're looking too much into it. Option 1 is the most likely and obvious one here in my opinion.
6441	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-24	Most episode titles have double meanings at least
6442	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-24	Yes the most obvious one to me is Jaimie giving Brienne Oathkeeper and sending her after Sansa
6443	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-24	Jaime giving Brienne Oathkeeper is pretty much a given, the 2nd? I think that Alliser Thorne will ride out to Crasters, there by leaving Jon to lead the defense of CB, but it seems to soon.
Theon Leading the Ironmen out of Moot Callin would also be a good conter to Oathkeeper, but IDT that happens.Â 
Â 
I do believe there will be another meaning behind the title.Â
6444	Seneti	2014-04-24	1. Jaime giving Oathkeeper to Brienne to keep her oath.
2. Tyrells and Lannisters keeping their oaths to each other by deciding to marry Margaery to Tommen?
3. NW deciding to go and punish the deserters at Craster's.
4. YAsha on her journey to save Theon (see oath from last season)?
6445	Martini Sigil	2014-04-24	I was thinking Brienne w the sword going after Sansa... but the craster thing probably gives it a double meaning
6446	Ser Blake	2014-04-25	I think clearly the title most directly relates to Jaime.Â  A character who has been an oathbreaker is whole life finally transforms into an oathkeeper.Â  I expect this episode to have a lot of huge character moments for Jaime.Â  Although the title obviously has multiple meanings and can still be applied to other characters such as Jon, I think this will be an extremely Jaime centric episode and his arc will be this episodes through line.
6447	MelisandreTargaryen	2014-04-25	^^ This.Â 
Craster's keep, Jaime and Brienne... Yara's rescue attempt is a huge maybe, only cause we have yet to see any of the Greyjoys (except Reek/Theon) and I think that's for a reason. Maybe possibly waiting for the Dorne storyline to kind of die down for a moment (Oberyn's fall and the lull before the introduction to the rest of the Dornish kingdom).Â
6448	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-25	I think you're looking too much into it. Option 1 is the most likely and obvious one here in my opinion.


Â 
If you watched E03: Breaker of Chains and thought it was just about Dany freeing slaves, then you're seriously missing out on the show, at least thematically. Most of the episodes since Season 3 have had multiple meanings as relates to the episode's content.
6449	Joseph Nobles	2014-04-25	Rast and the rest of their Merry Men may find out that Craster had an oath to keep with the White Walkers.

All the Valyrian steel swords on the show have that Damascus engraving. It's the way the show differentiates them from normal steel. Ice, Longclaw and Oathkeeper. I didn't notice if Widow's Wail had it too.
Edit: search 'Damascus sword' on Google images. That's what they're using to replicate the Valyrian sword ripples from the books.

Swords can get stuck, the blood channel helps to reduce it to some extent.

That's what they're using to replicate the Valyrian sword ripples from the books.Damascus steel is not the engraving part.It is an un-engraved steel surface with a distinctive patterns of banding and mottling.Swords , axes, spear blades, other edged weapons have been made of Damascus steel up to the 18th century.Damascus steel can still be engraved tho.(In the 19th (and early 20th) century even 'Damascus' steel shotguns were made, only for use with black powder, when modern gun powder is used they come apart. The steel for these guns only looked like Damascus , no one made them from Wootz steel.)Supposedly the art of Damascus steel was lost by the mid 18th century.People still work on 'reverse engineering' it.By the by ,in recent times, it was discovered that real Damascus steel contains carbon nanotubes!Using pattern welding one can reproduce swords and knives that look like Damascus steel. I am supposing that's what is being used on the show. On the show , every now and then once see the banding and mottling on the 'Valyrian' steel blades... I think the dagger LF has it show up clearly, but most of the time it's hard to see.I don't know who made the shows Valyrian steel swords and blades.Maybe Tommy Dunne the series weapons master has his own shop?See interview here:http://www.westeros....res/Entry/5066/Chris Beasley at the company Valyrian Steel makes beautiful reproductions of the swords used on the show, but don't think they make anything for the show?One think they don't even seem to CGI in, is that the Valyrian steel blades supposed had 'color' , I guess a metaphor for the 'magic' contained.Still the swords look super.One thing to note about Oathkeeper , my eyes may be going bad, but does it have an edge on it?I can't see it.

6461	Clariana	2014-04-26	Perhaps Petyr gets betrothed to Lysa...
6462	DRS	2014-04-26	Nice link on swords, a lot of info on one pageÂ http://albion-swords...sword-terms.htm
Â 
Also, could there also be a reference to Petyr breaking his word to "take Sansa home", as he instead takes her to his island, then off to the Vale?
6463	Slingingstones	2014-04-27	The Channel down the center of both sides of the sword is not actually a blood grove. Â It's purpose is to make the sword lighter while at the same time allowing it to maintain the greatest amount of strength along it's hacking edges. Â It's a modified "I" beam construction. Â See: Secrets of the Viking Sword +ULFBERH+T atÂ https://www.youtube....h?v=nXbLyVpWsVM.
6464	Dirk blitzen	2014-04-28	I wonder if the title "Oathkeeper" relates to the last scene of this episode.Â  Apparently HBO says the darth maul guy at the end is Night's King... he was the 13th Other in the scene and the Night's King was the 13th Lord Commander for 13 years, so...
Â 
Maybe the Night's King is fulfilling some oath he took?Â  I guess we'll have to wait and see...

Â 
EDIT: I'll come up with something to say momentarily...


See the timestamp. I posted it on 21st April. Better late than never.Â 
Now we can discuss Ep 4 events here properly.Â
6468	iheartseverus	2014-04-23	*happy dance*Â  At last!!
6469	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	So Jaime and Cersei...talking. That is our first shot. She is testing him, seeing what he is willing to do for her now that...well...you know. The commercial misleads us, we see his sword then as if he would be willing to do as she demands and bring her Sansa's head, which we of courseÂ know he wouldn't do.
Â 
Then we have LF, presumably going to give his players and pawns speech which I think Gillen will do quite well with. I actually like him, unlike some. I wonder if he'll title drop "game of thrones". If he does they HAVE to end the episode that way and go to that song "game of thrones" from the S1 soundtrack that used to end every episode early on.
6470	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Then we have Jaime playing Uncle Kevan with Tyrion. His counsel almost, talking to him about this and that, letting him vent to him. I like that Jaime looks to be sitting on the floor, unlike Pod who sat on that little bench/table thingmy.
Â 
Then we have Bronn bitchslapping Jaime and presumably talking to him about Tyrion. Or Tommen? I'm unsure. This scene may be where we get that shot of Jaime on the ground and Bronn standing above him (in one of the HBO programming videos that they play between shows we first saw this).
Â 
Now we see Jon training Grenn and then Thorne antagonizing Jon.
Â 
And then Dany considering whether to spare the masters or not. She'll surely crucify them this episode. We see Grey Worm dressed like a normal slave rather than an unsullied. We see the slaves with knives and torches and whatnot. They massacre some of their great masters presumably. Good times!
Â 
A shot of Brienne riding away. A shot of Tommen in bed (wth going on here?).
Â 
Burn Gorman. Bran making a "huhhuihu" noise. And we finish with a fucking WW (about time).
6471	BaseBornBastard	2014-04-23	Finally!
I'm very much looking forward to the slave revolt this week. It looked pretty epic in one of the old trailers where the master gets attacked by a mob of slaves in the street. Also, it seems we'll get the conversation between LF and Sansa where he expands more on the PW.
6472	iheartseverus	2014-04-23	*happy feet*
Â 
^^ This.Â  To me, anyway, that seems to come in the middle of a conversation.Â  I imagine she's complaining that he's changed--that once, he said he'd kill everyone in the world until he and she were the only ones left, if that was what it took for them to be together.Â  But, now?Â  Would he even do her a little tiny favor and bring her Sansa's head?Â  Things have changed for good between them, and IMO, this is the conversation that makes that clear.
I also caught that she doesn't say 'if I asked you,', she says:Â  'If I told you to leave the palace right now...'Â Â  Ha!Â  Boss lady be givin' orders, but nobody be listenin' !!
6473	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	More than anyone else I don't want this thread to become about THAT scene. That said, I think it will be addressed this episode in theÂ scene the promo's first shot shows us.Â I imagineÂ Cersei will use herÂ being taken in the sept as leverage to try and convince Jaime to do her a solid and behead a young girl.Â If not, what happened will likely beÂ acted out in theirÂ physicality around one another; they will be acting out a different dynamic. As Jaime said in "Two Swords", "something's changed". Now something else has. To continue on this subject (and if people harp on about THAT scene because I brought it up then I am really sorry and by all means blame me), Jaime is in four scenes in this promo. Perhaps he'll feature in even more in the episode. I believe all of that, and written by B Cogz, ought to serve as adequate damage control for the purists. Or maybe not. I'm not good at predicting the enduring power of fan outrage.

6474	King Tommen	2014-04-23	Pretty interested to see Bran's story this episode. It appears that they will stumble on Craster's and get taken prisoner there by Karl and the gang. What's not clear is what's happening with the brief glimpse of the White Walker we see. Will they encounter the Walker on their own (I'm guessing this could be the shot of the one on the horse we've seen in the trailers) get away and then wind up at Crasters? Or will we not have them interact with the WW at all and it be about the Rast baby sacrificing bit that we've also seen in the trailers?

Good times.
6475	Ser Blake	2014-04-23	Hallelujah! Its about time this thread opened up. We can finally move on from that one damn scene now.Â Â 
Â 
This episode looks like its going to be a great one
Â 
Reasons
Â 
1)Â  Bryan Cogman
2)Â  More of awesome season 4 Jon Snow being awesome
3)Â  Bran and Co encountering mutineers or maybe even Others?
4)Â  BRYAN COGMAN
5)Â  What looks an insane slave revolt in Mereen
6)Â  Big character moments for Jaime
7)Â  Littlefinger's epic playing the game speech
8) BRYAN MOTHER F***ING COGMAN
6476	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	The people over at the Heresy thread will LOVE this episode. Craster's Keep (with perhaps some tidbits from the older wife whose been cast about how the Keep functions) and a glimpse of a WW. This is what they've been talking about over there for some time; the nature of Craster's pact with the WW. Knowing Cogz he'll have gleaned as much as he could from GrrM and be putting in some real info about what's going down there...

Â 
We're going to have him give Brienne her marching orders (in what appears to be a direct disobedience of a Cersei order) so that will be cool. I'm very interested to see what Brienne gets up to for the rest of the season in the subsequent episodes since we have seen exactly zero footage of her after she leaves on her horse (probably because it would be too spoilerific for trailers).

6478	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	^Well, the summary of Mockingbird says "she follows a new lead". Thus far that's our only indication of what she continues to get up too. A Northern Irish guy on wicnet says his friends farm was used for a scene where she and Pod sit skinning rabbits. That's all I can half-confirm about what they'll get up to. My assumption is though that they'll take her all the way up to LSH.

Â 
How revealing....
Â 
Basically the sum total of what we know will definitely happen on her journey is that Pod will be with her, she will be in the vicinity of the Vale at some point and that she bites someone's ear off.

6482	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-23	I'm so happy we're back at The Wall, and I can't wait to see more of Craster's Keep (Burn Gorman - wooo!).
Â 
Also really looking forward to Jaime and Brienne's scene and farewell. I have the utmost faith in Cogman.

					
					
							Edited by Koi No Yokan, 23 April 2014 - 11:50 PM.
6483	King Tommen	2014-04-23	Is it wrong that in that quick shot of Karl it appears as if Burn Gorman is performing Hamlet?
Â 
Also, who's waking Tommen up in the middle of the night? I hope it's Tywin interrupting him in the middle of a wet dream to explain how puberty works.
6484	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Well, Tommen, saying she follows a new lead implies that she at one point follows another one. That is something.
Â 
Apparently toÂ a poster on reddit in the summer who was an NW extra, Karl has kept Mormont's skull. So I guess this glimpse confirms that. As for Tommen waking with a start...who knows.

6485	Ser Blake	2014-04-23	Am I the only one who feels like Arya/The Hound and Brienne/Pod are on a colission course for the Vale?Â  I have no idea what will happen if they do meet, but I've got a strong feeling about an encounter or at least near encounter happening towards the end of this season in the Vale.
6486	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-23	Am I the only one who feels like Arya/The Hound and Brienne/Pod are on a colission course for the Vale?Â  I have no idea what will happen if they do meet, but I've got a strong feeling about an encounter or at least near encounter happening towards the end of this season in the Vale.


I personally feel the same. They will come close but will not meet.Â
6487	Konradsmith	2014-04-23	Or perhaps Brienne will stumble upon the wounded Hound post-Arya abandonment. If they're to have her meet LSH by the end of the season that would be a way to cram in the Hound being alive from her AFFC journey.
6488	King Tommen	2014-04-23	Someone was cast for this season to play a "Knight at the Gate" or something like that and according to their CV, it's for more than 1 episode. I had a guess that maybe we'll see him first when LF and Sansa arrive at the Vale to let them in and then near the end of the season once Arya and the Hound show up where they'll be denied entry and perhaps get into an altercation that leads to the Hound's big wound.
Â 
But knowing that Brienne and Pod will be there at some point too means that we could see some kind of overlap although I think Brienne actually running into Arya would be problematic. More likely everyone just misses each other in different episodes.
6489	iheartseverus	2014-04-23	Well, Tommen, saying she follows a new lead implies that she at one point follows another one. That is something.

Probably someone has just snuck into his room and it scared him.Â  I'm guessing it would be Cersei, that maybe now that Tywin has apparently taken control of the boy, the only way she gets to see him is to sneak into his room at night.Â  (What a family, the Lannisters!)Â  Or, it might be Margaery, making nice and settling in for a pal-to-pal chat?

Â 
Oh man, that's macabre. I love it.
Â 
Perhaps Ser Pounce is waking up Tommen? But I'd assume it's either Cersei or Jaime, to be honest.
6491	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	Tommen, the Knight of the Gate actor's CV says he will appear in a Michelle MacLaren directed episode. So either this one "Oathkeeper" or the following one "First of His Name." After that he will appear in an Alex Graves directed ep., so either eight or ten. That could well confirm your speculation.
6492	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-24	[quote name="King Tommen" post="5688084" timestamp="1398315047"]Also, who's waking Tommen up in the middle of the night? I hope it's Tywin interrupting him in the middle of a wet dream to explain how puberty ]I am concern it could be Margaery.
6493	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^And she'll say, "Do you like my gown like this...or like this?" Hahaha. Bryan Cogman did write that scene in WIDMND (ep. 202) so who knows. I doubt it, but if that is what that is, then I must say that that young man playing Tommen would be a helluva lucky lad.
6494	King Tommen	2014-04-24	I am concern it could be Margaery.


Â 
I'd put Margaery pretty far down the list of possibilities for that scene. It's most likely Cersei.
6495	iheartseverus	2014-04-24	^^Â  Agree.Â  The show making it clear that Tywin owns Tommen now, and Cersei can only see him by sneaking into his bedroom at night.Â  (Though, as an aside, doesn't the soon to be king have guards outside his bedroom?)
Â 
Gotta love the Lannisters.Â  The Family from Hell.
6496	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-24	I wonder if they'll promote Meryn Trant to Royal Food-Tester?
6497	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-24	Â 
I'd put Margaery pretty far down the list of possibilities for that scene. It's most likely Cersei.

j/k after Tywin about to give Tommen "The Talk"
I am thinking ep. 5 in a approiate setting.
6498	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	So it looks like Jon's ranging and attack on the mutineers will be in ep. five. They gave us no glimpses of him attacking in the promo, while they gave us glimpses of a helluva lot of other stuff. Also the summary for "First of His Name" says he starts a new mission. So I guess Bran and co. escape from Craster's before Jon and co. show up. Isaac Hampstead Wright said that Bran is only in four episodes this season, so it wouldn't make sense for him to be in eps. four and five and then not show up until no. 10. I imagine his business with Craster's Keep and the mutineers will be done this episode to reintroduce them as baddies and then Jon will deal with them in no. 5.
6499	Queen of Whores	2014-04-24	^I'll give my head to the spike if it works as a symbolic gesture to get people to STFU.

Lol you're the only one still mentioning it though
6500	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-24	They made Joffrey know or doubt about the incest. Will they make Tommen know and ask?
6501	Usurper's Dog	2014-04-24	Â 
Also, who's waking Tommen up in the middle of the night? I hope it's Tywin interrupting him in the middle of a wet dream to explain how puberty works.

Margaery moving in for some early manipulation ?
6502	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-24	Margaery moving in for some early manipulation ?


Â 
Please no... no no no no no no in name of the Old Gods and the New Ones... I couldn't stand another week like this one about the subject.
6503	Usurper's Dog	2014-04-24	Does anybody have information implying this crossover between the Bran storyline and the Craster's Keep arc or is it just wishful thinking? I think making Bran a prisoner of the mutineers takes away from the real threat he's facing moving North.
6504	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	Well, we don`t know that Bran gets captured by them. He could just witness some of their shenanigans. But we`ll certainly see the mutineers through Bran`s viewpoint.
6505	Usurper's Dog	2014-04-24	He could just witness some of their shenanigans. But we`ll certainly see the mutineers through Bran`s viewpoint.

Tommen and Ser Pounce get into shenanigans. I'm afraid to think what Craster's looks like right now, regardless of whether Bran ends up there or not.

6506	redriver	2014-04-24	We've already had Ed and Grenn escape from Craster's.It would be somewhat careless if they caught a crippled boy and allowed him to escape too.Though you never know..
6507	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-24	I'm guessing that Bran & Co. are captured and taken to Craster's Keep in this episode, they may or may not skip the fifth episode, and then they will escape as Jon and whatever contingent of Night's Watch brothers attack the mutineers in episode six. I'm thinking it'll be the sixth episode if only because of the title:Â The Laws of Gods and Men, which is a phrase Jeor stated right before he was killed by Rast. The shot of the White Walker may also have to do with Rast, as we've seen him delivering a child to them in several of the trailers.Â 
Â 
Beyond that, it looks like we'll get a fair amount of Jaime (with Cersei, with Bronn, with Tyrion, and with Brienne), and a fair amount of material from Dany's story line (the slaves revolting; Dany deciding to crucify the masters). Littlefinger & Sansa will have their scene, and it's likely that Jon and the Night's Watch will feature a fair amount, as well. Then there's the matter of Tommen, but I'm thinking he'll share a scene with Cersei, perhaps where she asks him to recollect what she told him at the battle of Blackwater (pure conjecture on my part, this).Â 
Â 
So no Arya, no Stannis, and no Theon/Yara.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Khal-a-bunga, 24 April 2014 - 01:58 AM.
6508	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^But Rast and the lady playing Morag Craster (one of the made-up wives, this one played by an older established actress instead of the porn stars who seem to be playing most of them) are credited as only appearing in Michelle MacLaren directed episodes.
6509	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-24	So we know King's Landing, Dany, Jon, Bran and Sansa are in.
Â 
Do we know if Arya, Theon, Yara or Davos will appear?
6510	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^That is the pertinent question, I think. For the last three episodes that aired there were TV guide listings of which guest actors featured.Â They were incomplete of course, but they were stillÂ very helpful. Also mayhaps we'll get a previously on clip released on youtube soon that could enlighten us. Or leaked production photos from Far Far Away Site. If none of those pan out, we just have to wait and see.

6511	ovis alba	2014-04-24	I finally figured out that it's Tommen in the bed towards the end of the trailer, took me a while to figure it out, don't have the actor in my mind repertoire yet i guess.  Wonder what this is about?
Â 
I love that we get more Bran and apparently another dream (?) of a white walker, always a YAY for that.
And one thing I'm happy about in regards to show-watchers: There seems to be a little more reveal about the Wedding by Littlefinger, many are still quiet confused.
6512	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-24	I'm guessing that Bran & Co. are captured and taken to Craster's Keep in this episode, they may or may not skip the fifth episode, and then they will escape as Jon and whatever contingent of Night's Watch brothers attack the mutineers in episode six. I'm thinking it'll be the sixth episode if only because of the title:Â The Laws of Gods and Men, which is a phrase Jeor stated right before he was killed by Rast.

Â 
Sorry wow I know this thread is about E4, but that made me think a lot about how packed E6 will be. Â E6 has Tyrion's trial, Dany holding court, Yara's attack on the Dreadfort, Stannis arriving in Braavos, and Jon vs. the Mutineers. Â Plus, we know of an Oberyn/Cersei scene...maybe because Tywin suggests she marry Oberyn in E5? (synopsis: plotting the Crown's next move) Â In the books, Tywin offered her up to the Tyrells, Martells, and the Greyjoys so I'd be disappointed if the show version of that is simply Loras.
6513	Mel_Rose	2014-04-24	I'm glad they will show an attack of a WW, it's been a while and it helps to show how dangerous Bran's journey in the north is. Not to mention, it reminds viewers that they're still a threat.
Â 


Is it wrong that in that quick shot of Karl it appears as if Burn Gorman is performing Hamlet?
Â 


lol, that's exactly what I thought.
Perhaps that's the "violent scene that had to be toned down" is Karl playing Hamlet

It's obviously Marjorie come to seduce an older Tommen.  The very thing book Cersei has always feared about Marjorie.
6517	sati	2014-04-24	The attack on Craster's Keep is in episode five.

I think 'plotting's the crown's next move' refers to 'who can we trust/ourselves alone' moment with Tywin and Cersei and Cersei talking about how they don't need to worry about Daenerys (from week's ahead trailer)

6520	King Tommen	2014-04-24	One of my favourite things is Cersei's alcoholic beverage in almost every scene she's in now. If they made an action figure for her, they'd have to include a wine glass as an accessory.
6521	SoManyVows	2014-04-24	As far as I can tell, this is the complete list of scenes that we know will be in the episode. I'm sure that there will be one or two others that we can't divine from either the synopsis or the promos. The scenes are obviously not necessarily in order.
Â 
Synopsis: Dany balances justice and mercy. Jaime tasks Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) with his honor. Jon secures volunteers while Bran, Jojen (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Meera (Ellie Kendrick) and Hodor (Kristian Nairn) stumble on shelter.
Â 
Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing
Cersei and Jaime discuss where things stand between them, including Cersei's resentment of Jaime's sympathy for Tyrion's plight. As Haldir Monark notes, it looks like Cersei's dialogue from the Foreshadowing video will be in this scene: "You've always pitied him, our poor little brother. He'd kill us all if he could." Cersei also asks Jaime to hunt down Sansa and return to Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing with her head. â<U+0080><U+009C>If I told you to leave the capital right now, and find Sansa, and bring me her head â<U+0080><U+0093> would you do it?â<U+0080><U+009D>
	Jaime trains with Bronn, and the two of them discuss Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s situation. "You going to fight for him now?"
	Jaime meets with Tyrion in his cell. "It wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike."
	Jaime gives Brienne Oathkeeper. He tasks her with finding Sansa and protecting her.
	Jaime and Brienne say goodbye to one another outside the city gates.
	Tommen awakens, startled, in his bedchamber and someone (Cersei? Tywin? Jaime? Margaery?) talks to him.
En Route to the Eyrie
Baelish gives Sansa the speech where he sheds more light on the Purple Wedding and how he successfully plays the game of thrones. "He wasn't involved with Joffrey's death. But you were."
Castle Black
Jon trains with Grenn and clashes with Alliser Thorne. "You're a steward, you traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse."
	Jon attempts to recruit volunteers for the mission to deal with the mutineers. This could be wrong, but I believe I saw a report a few months ago that Locke, having arrived at the Wall in the time between episodes, approaches Jon at this gathering and â<U+0080><U+009C>offers his servicesâ<U+0080><U+009D> (clearly in the service of his own agenda).
Beyond the Wall
Bran, Meera, Jojen, and Hodor have some sort of encounter (either with the mutineers or a White Walker) that prompts them to seek shelter. Possibly, they are captured by the mutineers and taken to Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep.
	At least one scene with Karl lording over his new domain.
	At least one scene with a White Walker. Most likely it would be Rast sacrificing the baby, but it could be an encounter with Bran, as previously mentioned.
Meereen
Multiple scenes of unrest within Meereen as the slaves begin to rise up against their masters. Ultimately, it all culminates in open rebellion with at least one of the masters (probably more) getting shanked in an alley by a mob of slaves.
	After the city falls, Daenerys orders 163 slavers to be crucified as retribution for the slaves who were displayed along the road to Meereen. "I will answer injustice with justice."
	Daenerys greets her newly freed subjects and gets an adoring reception - one that she quite enjoys.
Characters that (as far as we can tell) are sitting this episode out include:
Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre at Dragonstone
	Reek and the Boltons at the Dreadfort
	Ygritte and the Wildlings south of the Wall
	Arya and the Hound in the Riverlands

6522	Tyranno	2014-04-24	What if Tommen's scene will be Tywin giving him Shae, to teach him about the birds and the bees?
Highly unlikely, I know. But it could show that Tywin has Shae already and is now using her for his own purposes.Â
6523	ovis alba	2014-04-24	Now I'm thrilled to see Tommen using whatever his grandfather taught him last episode on Margaery. We already missed "the talk", so let's give us some awkward Tommen tying to do what he just learned.

Â 
I don't think so, I think the White Walkers up to this point are presented as the pure evil that is really the enemy albeit no one really cares about them.
Coldhands is much more ambigous about who he actually is and which side he is on. I don't think they are going to show the White Walkers (or someone looking exactly like them) as anything but a threat.

Yes I thought so about the topic.
About coldhands, when did John Bradley said that? Cause I think it was announced on Facebook this summer that lady SH, CH and the man with 1001 eyes will be on the show. Not sure I may be mistaken.
6531	Bear Claw	2014-04-24	I can't imagine that Bran and friends will be captured at Craster's.Â One of them will get hurt for sure.Â  Also, maybe it is in the books and I don't remember but I thought the message in bloodÂ on the walls of Â Meereen was strange.Â  Can the slaves read?

Even if they can read, why would they write "Kill the Masters" in Common Tongue (English). It would be better if it had been written in Ghiscari or High Valyrian, and the subtitles read "Kill the Masters."

Easy to understand.Â  He was 'barely there,' which I thought was odd, given he's a pretty big name.Â  He was wonderful as a ridiculous, pretentious law clerk in Bleak House with such an over the top low-class, no-class Brit accent, all he had to do was appear on screen for me to start laughing out loud.Â  He was just wonderful.

Â 
He's not really there before the mutiny but he's pretty much all over the scene so if you remember it at all, you have to remember him since he's the one who starts the whole thing and kills Craster.Â  Pretty memorable:

6542	Colonel Green	2014-04-24	Tommen, the Knight of the Gate actor's CV says he will appear in a Michelle MacLaren directed episode. So either this one "Oathkeeper" or the following one "First of His Name." After that he will appear in an Alex Graves directed ep., so either eight or ten. That could well confirm your speculation.


My guess would be that we see Ser Donnel first when Arya and the Hound try to enter the Vale, and subsequently he shows up at some official function at the Eyrie (possibly making an ironic comment to Alayne about all the vagabonds he's had to turn away).Â  Or possibly Arya and the Hound press on into the Vale via some route, and he and his men are the ones who wound the Hound near-fatally later on.

Jaime and Brienne say goodbye to one another outside the city gates.


I suspect this show's version of events is going to have Jaime send Podrick with Brienne from the start, seeing as last episode set up the need for him to leave town.

Â 
Poderick does have a reason to go find Sansa as well because finding her would help clear Tyrion's name, which we know he would desperately like to do. He could be sent by Jaime or he could quickly pop up with Brienne shortly after she leaves too.
6546	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	Great breakdown SoManVows! Very concise and lays down everything we know about it and are likely to see in it in a more detailed manner than I could muster!
Â 
This Locke business is interesting and could shape up to make for some pretty cool scenes. Noah Taylor is awesome andÂ though I wanted JaimeÂ or Brienne to kill him last season, I'm glad now that they've kept him around.Â Â Just one question: how will he know to look north of the Wall unless Sam or GillyÂ somehow spills the beans about Bran's location/direction? Or unless Jon knows thatÂ Bran and co. areÂ north of the Wall in show canon. They haven't addressed that yet, of course, but it is an understandable point of contention.
Â 
We should remember that this episode is going to be pretty short. I can't link the source that says how long each episode is going to be, but I remember its either 51 or 52 minutes. So it might not be as jam-packed as some people have speculated.

From one of the trailers / promotional vids we see them riding off together so my guess is Tyrion talks to Jaime about Pod's 'safety' and Jaime decides to ask him to go with Brienne.

6555	rymerster	2014-04-24	The Tommen scene may well be Margery attempting to make friends with kittens. I know in the show that Tommen is a bit older but Margery clearly changes her persona somewhat to get her man - with Joff she was seductive without being cheap - with Tommen she will probably emphasise her philanthropic side, a kindly side, to gain his trust. This starts the whole Cersei Vs Margery plot line.Â
6556	rymerster	2014-04-24	From one of the trailers / promotional vids we see them riding off together so my guess is Tyrion talks to Jaime about Pod's 'safety' and Jaime decides to ask him to go with Brienne.


Â 
I see no reason why they can't have Pod and Brienne get together in the same way as the books - he follows her thinking she will lead him to Sansa, she spots him, confronts him and then they work together.Â

And Natalie Dormer said in a recent interview that the relationship between Margaery and Cersei is about to become poisonous.Â  Fun, can't wait!
6558	rymerster	2014-04-24	And Natalie Dormer said in a recent interview that the relationship between Margaery and Cersei is about to become poisonous.Â  Fun, can't wait!


Yes, Natalie Dormer and Lena Headley are going to be great working together again. Margery is every bit as manipulative and maybe more savvy than Cersei, we shall see. Next season I guess will take things to their climax following what people expect to happen in Ep 10. Next season is going to be even better than this one, given what we know from the books.Â
6559	Colonel Green	2014-04-24	I see no reason why they can't have Pod and Brienne get together in the same way as the books - he follows her thinking she will lead him to Sansa, she spots him, confronts him and then they work together.Â 


In the books Pod follows Brienne because he thinks Sansa might know where Tyrion is.Â  In the show, Tyrion's still in jail; the only reason for Pod to go looking for Sansa on his own would be if hoped to find her and bring her back to King's Landing if it would help Tyrion, which is the exact opposite of what Brienne is doing.
6560	MR92	2014-04-24	I'm guessing that Bran & Co. are captured and taken to Craster's Keep in this episode, they may or may not skip the fifth episode, and then they will escape as Jon and whatever contingent of Night's Watch brothers attack the mutineers in episode six. I'm thinking it'll be the sixth episode if only because of the title:Â The Laws of Gods and Men, which is a phrase Jeor stated right before he was killed by Rast. The shot of the White Walker may also have to do with Rast, as we've seen him delivering a child to them in several of the trailers.Â 
Â 
Beyond that, it looks like we'll get a fair amount of Jaime (with Cersei, with Bronn, with Tyrion, and with Brienne), and a fair amount of material from Dany's story line (the slaves revolting; Dany deciding to crucify the masters). Littlefinger & Sansa will have their scene, and it's likely that Jon and the Night's Watch will feature a fair amount, as well. Then there's the matter of Tommen, but I'm thinking he'll share a scene with Cersei, perhaps where she asks him to recollect what she told him at the battle of Blackwater (pure conjecture on my part, this).Â 
Â 
So no Arya, no Stannis, and no Theon/Yara.Â 


where is the evidence that bran and co will be captured at crasters other than the fact that their scenes are mingled together in the previews? im just confused where this consensus came from. Â
6561	go joff go	2014-04-24	Is it wrong that in that quick shot of Karl it appears as if Burn Gorman is performing Hamlet?
Â 
Also, who's waking Tommen up in the middle of the night? I hope it's Tywin interrupting him in the middle of a wet dream to explain how puberty works. my guess is Margery.

6570	iheartseverus	2014-04-24	And from what we've seen thus far, Tommen seems like a sweet kid, older than book Tommen, yes, but still... a kid.Â  When Tywin first enters the sept and asks him 'What makes a good king?'Â  Tommen just stands there, until Tywin says:Â  'It's not a trick.'Â  And then he answers.Â  haha, Tommen's had a close-up glimpse or two of the dynamics of the elders in his family (to say nothing of his elder brother!) and he's intimidated by them, goes silent when attention turns to him.Â  He's a kid.
Â 
So, kittens!Â  And outlawing beets, and stamping documents... works fine for me.Â  He's just a sweet kid.

6572	Colonel Green	2014-04-24	So, kittens!Â  And outlawing beets, and stamping documents... works fine for me.Â  He's just a sweet kid.


I could see him liking cats (that's not something you age out of), but he's too old for things like sincerely asserting he wants to outlaw beets. As for documents, I can imagine him being cajoled into doing it due to his elders' influence, but he's too old to just sign whatever's put in front of him without question.
6573	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	I doubt he'll outlaw beets but I can see him having kittens.
6574	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-24	He could mention outlawing beets as a joke, or said naively.
Â 
I think they'll change bookTommen's childishness for innocence. That could work.
6575	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	^Yeah. So long as they get across the basic point of him; that he's a good, young pliable lad. Which they basically already did with that Tywin scene.

6579	iheartseverus	2014-04-24	He could mention outlawing beets as a joke, or said naively.
Â 
I think they'll change bookTommen's childishness for innocence. That could work.


Exactly.Â  I could see someone explaining to him that he's the King, he can do anything he likes, he can enact any law he likes.Â  And he'd be like 'Really?Â  Soooo, I can outlaw beets?'Â  With a sort of wonder and delight that for the first time in his life, he can actually exert control over something he's always hated.
6580	juanml82	2014-04-24	Someone was cast for this season to play a "Knight at the Gate" or something like that and according to their CV, it's for more than 1 episode. I had a guess that maybe we'll see him first when LF and Sansa arrive at the Vale to let them in and then near the end of the season once Arya and the Hound show up where they'll be denied entry and perhaps get into an altercation that leads to the Hound's big wound.
Â 
But knowing that Brienne and Pod will be there at some point too means that we could see some kind of overlap although I think Brienne actually running into Arya would be problematic. More likely everyone just misses each other in different episodes.


It won't necessarily be problematic: neither Brienne nor Pod know how Arya looks like and, if they let it be known that they are looking for Sansa, Arya has no reason to trust them. On the contrary, she might think they are looking for her on Cersei's orders.
Â 
The problem I see might be their schedules, specially if Brienne meets LSH by the end of the season. And, BTW, if that's her schedule (which we don't know for certain), where will Jaime be by then? He's needed to let Tyrion escape, and that's season finale material. If LSH meets Brienne by the end of the season, she can't really order her to bring Jaime to her, as Jaime will be either at King's Landing or looking for Tywin Lannister's Teletrasportation Device in order to be already at the Riverlands.
6581	franko99	2014-04-24	Tommen could be a young Renly-like character, I mean, good-hearted but a bit naive, easy to manipulate and not quite ready to rule by his own. That would also explain why he prefer the Tyrell than the LannisterÂ

6582	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-24	^The Shae reveal will be during the trial. That's why we got that great contrazoom Tyrion reaction shot in the fourth trailer.


that's my guess. Tyrion Looked like he couldn't believe his eyes in that shot.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Tall Tyrion Lannister!, 24 April 2014 - 09:48 PM.
6583	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-24	Yeah, the way they played Shae's departure, I think it's obvious that they'll be 'revealing' that she didn't actually leave King's Landing during Tyrion's trial (which looks to be episode six). I'm guessing that Tywin's proclamation that 'no one leaves the city' might play into this, or it could possibly just be inferred that she was detained prior to the ship leaving port.Â
6584	Konradsmith	2014-04-24	I think Bronn will have betrayed him and lied about it.
6585	BaseBornBastard	2014-04-24	I think Bronn will have betrayed him and lied about it.


I really hope not. I can completely accept Bronn refusing to be Tyrion's champion, who could blame him? But if he actively betrayed Tyrion, well, as a lover of all things Bronn that particular deviation would really piss me off.
6586	Ser Blake	2014-04-24	I'm starting to understand why they made the changes to Shae's character.Â  Since show Shae is actually in love with Tyrion her betrayal will be much more shocking to the audience and much more devastating to Tyrion. Also by slightly whitewashing Tyrion, they are setting him up for a steeper collapse into darkness. This new dynamic should make the scene where Tyrion does finally kill Shae much more dark, twisted, and heart breaking than it was in the books.Â  If they handle it correctly then this should make for great TV.
6587	franko99	2014-04-24	Yeah, the way they played Shae's departure, I think it's obvious that they'll be 'revealing' that she didn't actually leave King's Landing during Tyrion's trial (which looks to be episode six). I'm guessing that Tywin's proclamation that 'no one leaves the city' might play into this, or it could possibly just be inferred that she was detained prior to the ship leaving port.Â 


In episode 2, Tywin said "bring her to the tower of the hand before the wedding" or something like that, I think Shae never leave KL and Tywin have her all this time. I'm not sure if Bronn goes along with it (and betrayed Tyrion), or if Shae and Tywin manage to fool him tooÂ
6588	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-25	I could buy that tywin had whatever boat she was on seized.
6589	Colonel Green	2014-04-25	Something Sibel Kekilli said in one of her interviews made me wonder if, worst case scenario, they're actually going to have Shae come back just to screw Tyrion over.Â  This being the interview in question:
Â 
And though Bronn says he sent Shae away to Pentos, Kekilli reveals that might not be the last people hear of her character. "If you're hurt, if someone hurts you, sometimes you really get crazy and you can't think in the normal calm down way, so I think it's at that point," she says. "He just put the knife in her heart, so now she can't think anymore. She's not acting clever."
Â 
That would seem to totally defeat trying to make Shae a sympathetic character, so I hope that isn't what they're doing.

					
					
							Edited by Colonel Green, 25 April 2014 - 12:15 AM.
6590	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-25	I don't see Bronn betraying Tyrion by giving up Shae like that. When he sent her away he wasn't imprisoned yet, so Bronn was still getting paid and not in the tough position he would be now. He showed in Episode 1 of Season 3 that he's not afraid of taking on a higher authority in the Kingsguard, just to help Tyrion..
Â 
I still think she was nabbed after Bronn escorted her there (we really don't know if he waited around, saw her onto the boat, or just walked her there and left). Could it not be Varys who sold him out? He was the only other person who knew of smuggling Shae out of KL.

					
					
							Edited by Koi No Yokan, 25 April 2014 - 12:19 AM.
6591	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-25	Yeah, I don't see Bronn betraying Tyrion as the way this all shakes out. Kekilli's comments are... Well, if you've ever seen her interviews, then you'll know what I mean. It's not that you have to take what she says with a grain of salt, it's just that she isn't always so clear when speaking English. I can see Shae's bitterness playing a role, but I'm hesitant to believe that she may have actively avoided sailing to Essos in order to screw Tyrion over. More likely is that she's been hurt (by Tyrion), threatened (by Cersei), and 'employed' (whether against her will, or not, by Tywin), and that sequence of events will lead to Tyrion finding her in the Tower of the Hand.Â 
Â 
I always thought it was silly how so many posters here believed that they would have Tywin kill Shae, or that she wouldn't be killed at all.Â
6592	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-25	It was Varys. Varys wants Tyrion condemned, so he can send him to Daenerys while simultaneously sending Cersei on a self destructive spiral of paranoia. Everything about that trial and the aftermath was according to Varys's plan of keeping the country moderately stable, but broken enough for the Targaryens (at the very least, the Targaryen name) to reclaim power. Cersei probably told someone to fetch Shae, because she would see it as beneath her to go hunting down some lowly whore. Bronn is established as being loyal as long as you have money. At that point, Tyrion had money and so he had no reason to betray him. They also didn't have to include the line about nobody knowing except him, Tyrion, and Varys.

					
					
							Edited by bobbybuilderton, 25 April 2014 - 02:05 AM.
6593	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-25	But why would Varys sell out Shae for a plan he didn't already have in motion? This was all before Joffrey's death, which as far as we know Varys had no part (or knowledge) in.
Â 
I feel like it ties back into the conversation between Varys and Tyrion before the royal breakfast. Varys tells him outright that he will not lie or conceal Shae to Tywin if push comes to shove. He urges Tyrion to get her out right there and then, but Tyrion refuses. Que the breakfast scene - Cersei explains to Tywin who Shae is. Tywin wants her brought to the Tower of the Hand. Varys could have been ordered to find her whereabouts afterwards (seeing as Shae disappears for a little bit with Tyrion), or he could have simply given her up after hearing she was wanted by Tywin.
Â 
I'm just spitballing here, seeing as how we only have limited information about the show's events so far (and the full extent of Varys' planning and intentions). But I think it makes more sense, in that moment of time, for Varys to give Shae up to save his own skin and not risk being associated with her potential escape; rather than some elaborate plot to have Tyrion shipped off to Dany that would have way too many "ifs and buts". After all, it was Jaime who pulled a knife on Varys to convince him to help Tyrion escape.
Â 
I could be totally wrong, but it's just how I've interpreted it so far.
6594	Mel_Rose	2014-04-25	Yeah, I don't see Bronn betraying Tyrion as the way this all shakes out. Kekilli's comments are... Well, if you've ever seen her interviews, then you'll know what I mean.

Â 
I always thought it was silly how so many posters here believed that they would have Tywin kill Shae, or that she wouldn't be killed at all.Â 


Â 
That's my impression from her words. The "she's not acting clever" phrase seems to me to suggest that she doesn't care about the dangers, that she left the ship on her own in order to wreak havoc on Tyrion. Well, hell has no fury like a woman scorned and all that.
6595	Arry Lannister	2014-04-25	Thanks. I don't remember him at all from season 3.Â  Â

Â 
I've always found this funny; that in an episode named AFTER Baelish...he's not even mentioned in the synopses.
Â 
I was reading some article in which the author was summarizing what was going to happen in these episodes, and for the "Mockingbird" episode she says (non-sarcastically, mind you), "...And MAYBE we'll get some Littlefinger and Sansa in this episode). lol. If this is the snow-castle episode you're going to get A LOT of LF and Sansa, lady.
6609	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-25	I know that some think the "Only Cat." moment will play out before the finale, but that idea doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me. What's more likely is that Littlefinger & Sansa will arrive at the Eyrie in this episode, and we'll be re-introduced to Lysa & Robin, as well as being introduced to the new characters they've cast at this location (including Lady Waynwood).Â 
Â 
It's also possible that the snow castle could be in this episode, and the writers have simply extended the amount of time between that event and when Lysa takes flight, but I kind of doubt it.Â
6610	Dragonstoned	2014-04-25	They called it Mockingbird because it features Eminem in a cameo as Tyrion's 'unlikely ally' when he faces trial by (rap) battle. Â That's why HBO did that 'Catch the Throne' mixtape because Common, Wale and Big Boi are who the crown calls upon as champions. Â Surprised more people didn't pick up on this.

Kinda odd to me that we won't get the Oberyn-Mountain fight until episode 8 then for this, as I believe all of Ep. 9 is going to be at the Wall. That's kind of disconcerting then; it will be tough to get the deaths in then. By my count we should still get Ygritte, Oberyn and Tywin then, but I think some of the other posters saying that the "Only Cat" scene will be moved to next season are probably correct. Start it off with a bang again in Ep 1 or 2 of Season 5.Â

Nah, I think "Only Cat" has to be in this season. We'll get more a feel for it depending on how far Sansa's plot goes in the next couple of episodes. I just have a feeling that the 65 minutes of the finale is going to quiiiitee action-packed.

There is footage from OC scene in one of behind the scenes videos, with Lysa standing right on the edge of the door. There was also a talk about slow motion death this season.
6614	King Tommen	2014-04-25	They've been talking about the finale being jammed packed and one of the best episodes of the series so far so there's lots of room to put in 3 or 4 really strong climatic scenes. None of "Only Cat, LS, Tyrion/Tywin" would take up really extended amount of screentime.

Good point. The real question is what moments they choose to end Bran and Theon's story-lines on, because that's where in the more uncharted waters here, at least in terms of pacing.
6616	Hath4	2014-04-25	Theon will most likley end with moat caiin and reunification of roose and ramsays forces. Bran will end with him meeting bloodraven.

Bran has to be him reaching the cave with WW's and wights descending on them only to be rescued by the Children of the Forest. It's the only candidate for the CG-heavy scene Alex Graves keeps referencing.
Â 
Theon should liberate Moat Cailin somewhere in here and we should have the Ramsay/Roose silhouette meet up on the field which signifies Roose's army's return to the North (and probably headed to Winterfell). Whether we have anything else Theon/Yara/Balon related is up in the air.

Haha well obv I'd love for them to do it, just don't know if even D&D will be able to. I mean the chronology is gonna be nuts; episode 8 Oberyn gets killed, seemingly ending Tyrion's hopes. The duel will probably take up like 8-10 minutes with the before and after. Then in Episode 9 the wall gets defended, Ygritte dies, the wildlings attack again and Stannis saves the day. Given how much stuff they still have to do in Episode 10--Dany locks up her dragons, Tyrion escapes and kills Tywin, Bran reaches the cave, Jon (maybe?) gets elected LC, or in true GoT the show fashion has toÂ choose between becoming LC or Lord of Winterfell (because of course the show would pull something stupid like that), Arya arrives in Braavos and UnCat to end the season--even with 65 minutes that's a lot of big stuff already. Do you think the Unsullied will be able to handle all that stuff, plus the knowledge that Ygritte (probably a big favorite for them) and Oberyn (probably a new favorite for them) bite the dust in the previous eps? They're going to break the Internet over Tywin's death. I really, really would love to see Lysa fly this season as well but just have doubts that it's going to happen, and if I have to pick between that and UnCat this year, well, you know which one is going to win.

I think Ayra might just hop on a ship, so that could trim down her time. I think they could do it, and it would forever be revered as one of the greatest GoT episodes. I may just be overly optimistic though...
Â 
I'd definitely agree UnCat would win out if it's only a choice between that and Lysa flying. But imagine how cool it would be if the "only Cat" scene is followed by UnCat's reveal.

As you all guys said, it's gonna be so full of awesome :
Â 
- Tywin / Tyrion / Shae showdown (try saying Shae showdown aloud).
- Only Cat (I'm sure they'll keep it for this episode).
- LS (normally).
- Bran meeting Bloodraven and the CotF.
- Probable election at the Wall. A Stannis - Jon scene (I'd love it if it took place by Ygritte's funeral pyre) ?
- Banishing Jorah ? Chaining the dragons ?
- Arya sailing to Braavos (maybe seing the Titan at the horizon) ?

It's gonna be one hell of an episode !

6622	sati	2014-04-25	Oh wow ! 65 minutes ! Breaking the hour again for the finale !
Â 
As you all guys said, it's gonna be so full of awesome :
Â 
- Tywin / Tyrion / Shae showdown (try saying Shae showdown aloud).
- Only Cat (I'm sure they'll keep it for this episode).
- LS (normally).
- Bran meeting Bloodraven and the CotF.
- Probable election at the Wall. A Stannis - Jon scene (I'd love it if it took place by Ygritte's funeral pyre) ?
- Banishing Jorah ? Chaining the dragons ?
- Arya sailing to Braavos (maybe seing the Titan at the horizon) ?
Â 
It's gonna be one hell of an episode !


There is a scene in trailers with Melisandre looking at something burning (pyre is possible!) with ice and snow behind her, I think she's present during Jon/Stannis talk and I'd assume it's their only scene in finale.
6623	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-25	Â 
I think Ayra might just hop on a ship, so that could trim down her time. I think they could do it, and it would forever be revered as one of the greatest GoT episodes. I may just be overly optimistic though...
Â 
I'd definitely agree UnCat would win out if it's only a choice between that and Lysa flying. But imagine how cool it would be if the "only Cat" scene is followed by UnCat's reveal.


Yeah I'm being overly pessimistic, hopefully they get to all of it. This could realistically be the greatest episode of GoT ever until we get to the TWoW/ADoS stuff. Also there's that scene in the trailer of the Titan so I'm assuming Arya has to get there. Let's just hope for the best!
Â 
Also, this is how I'm envisioning my Unsullied friends during the finale:

Now a-days everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of giberish
And mother******* act like they forgot about Shae
Â 
For good reason. One char I don't think anyone will miss, since show Shae is so insufferable.Â

6626	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-25	They called it Mockingbird because it features Eminem in a cameo as Tyrion's 'unlikely ally' when he faces trial by (rap) battle. Â That's why HBO did that 'Catch the Throne' mixtape because Common, Wale and Big Boi are who the crown calls upon as champions. Â Surprised more people didn't pick up on this.
6627	King of the Road	2014-04-25	Karl holding a skull. Could be Mormont's, I think it might well be Craster's, with Karl using it as a drinking tankard in a mockery of the legends about wildlings.

It is. You can tell because of the mat they have placed over the moon door (to say nothing of the characters present). It's for the actress to fall onto when Littlefinger pushes her.Â

Maybe they'll move up the LF/Sansa plotline and put that in Ep. 7 then. The deaths don't need to be in order obviously, since they're already out of order with Joff dying before Ygritte. So then we'd go Lysa-Oberyn-Ygritte-Tywin/Shae in the last four. I'd be cool with that and I think it might make more sense to advance the Sansa plot a little bit, but if it works out to the "Only Cat" followed by UnCat to end the season that would still be awesome.

6633	Chebyshov	2014-04-25	I think the bang starters of Season 5 will be sending a bunch of characters off to Daenerys.


Â 
That coupled with the fact that we're likely to meet a lot of new characters (or at least a decent amount). I'm sure we're going to have a lot of merges, but the Unsullied freaked out (in a good way) over the introduction of Oberyn and Ellaria alone. Even if there's only one Greyjoy and one Sand Snake + Arianne, I think it will be an exciting season intro.
6634	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-25	I agree that one of the main threads of the fifth season will be that all of these various characters are heading towards Dany, which is why it only makes sense to have the battle of Meereen in the fifth season. A recent interview with Alex Graves mentioned that the VFX work for the last two episodes of the season will be worked on until just before they air, which gives further credence to the idea that it simply won't be logistically feasible to have the battle early in the sixth season. Not to mention the fact that the battle should have been inÂ ADwD anyway, from a narrative perspective.Â
6635	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-25	Hey guys not sure if has been brought up yet, are we going to see Lothor Brune again? IIRC last we saw him was preparing to fight Dontos way back in S2. I know he was played by an extra and his role is pretty minor.
6636	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-25	I agree that one of the main threads of the fifth season will be that all of these various characters are heading towards Dany, which is why it only makes sense to have the battle of Meereen in the fifth season.

Yeah, Battle of Slavery's Bay is definitely best at the end of season five. I expect the Battle on the Ice to be Green Fork'd though (and they'll do the Pink Letter to build tension until we find out what really happened early in season six when Stannis reaches Winterfell and confronts Roose*).
Â 
*Yes, that's how it's gonna go down. I hope.

6637	Konradsmith	2014-04-25	So in a lot of ways we've figured out how most of the season will play out. The only real wild card here is the Yara sailing business. Oh and Brienne. These warrior women are so difficult to fit into easily predictable timelines!

6638	King Tommen	2014-04-25	Dany's story is a little bit of a mystery after she takes up shop in Meereen. We know that she probably banishes Jorah (but not sure exactly how his treachery comes to light) and the dragons fry the kid (which might have her end up locking them up but that's in no way confirmed). I imagine that there's more going on there than just those things.
6639	Seneti	2014-04-25	I really hope not. I can completely accept Bronn refusing to be Tyrion's champion, who could blame him? But if he actively betrayed Tyrion, well, as a lover of all things Bronn that particular deviation would really piss me off.


Â 
I think it would be completely in-character for Bronn. Remember what he said to Tyrion before? He's not his friend. Bronn's loyalty is connected to gold and while Tyrion may have lots of it, Tywin (as head of the Lannister) has much more of it. That's the difficulty with sellswords. Just look at what happened to the masters of Astapor...
Â 


I'm starting to understand why they made the changes to Shae's character.Â  Since show Shae is actually in love with Tyrion her betrayal will be much more shocking to the audience and much more devastating to Tyrion. Also by slightly whitewashing Tyrion, they are setting him up for a steeper collapse into darkness. This new dynamic should make the scene where Tyrion does finally kill Shae much more dark, twisted, and heart breaking than it was in the books.Â  If they handle it correctly then this should make for great TV.


Â 
Exactly this. This is what they have been going for since season 2. Personally, the death of book Shae was more of a "meh" moment for me. I did not care for her at all. But whether you love her or hate her - people care about show Shae.
Â 


In episode 2, Tywin said "bring her to the tower of the hand before the wedding" or something like that, I think Shae never leave KL and Tywin have her all this time. I'm not sure if Bronn goes along with it (and betrayed Tyrion), or if Shae and Tywin manage to fool him tooÂ  


Â 
I think it went something like this:
Â 
1) Varys warning Tyrion that he's not going to lie about Shae
2) Cersei tells Tywin about Shae, Tywin orders her brought to the Tower of the Hand
3) Tyrion sends Shae away
4) Bronn takes Shae to the docks
Â 
At this point there are two options of what could have happened, once Bronn tries to put Shae on that boat:
Â 
5a ) Bronn was still there when the guards showed up for Shae (and he betrayed Tyrion because he knows that Tywin has more power and money than Tyrion)
5b ) Bronn left Shae at the boat, but not on the boat; the guards showed up and either arrested Shae against her will or she decided to go with them to spite/defy Tyrion (and in doing so, underestimated just how powerful and cruel Tywin can be)
Â 
Either way, Shae most likely ended up at the Tower of the Hand by episode 3.
Â 


Â 
Haha well obv I'd love for them to do it, just don't know if even D&D will be able to. I mean the chronology is gonna be nuts; episode 8 Oberyn gets killed, seemingly ending Tyrion's hopes. The duel will probably take up like 8-10 minutes with the before and after. Then in Episode 9 the wall gets defended, Ygritte dies, the wildlings attack again and Stannis saves the day. Given how much stuff they still have to do in Episode 10--Dany locks up her dragons, Tyrion escapes and kills Tywin, Bran reaches the cave, Jon (maybe?) gets elected LC, or in true GoT the show fashion has toÂ choose between becoming LC or Lord of Winterfell (because of course the show would pull something stupid like that), Arya arrives in Braavos and UnCat to end the season--even with 65 minutes that's a lot of big stuff already. Do you think the Unsullied will be able to handle all that stuff, plus the knowledge that Ygritte (probably a big favorite for them) and Oberyn (probably a new favorite for them) bite the dust in the previous eps? They're going to break the Internet over Tywin's death. I really, really would love to see Lysa fly this season as well but just have doubts that it's going to happen, and if I have to pick between that and UnCat this year, well, you know which one is going to win.


Â 
Honestly, yes, I do think almost all of that is going to be in:
Â 
episode 8:
- Oberyn dies
- Hound will most likely receive his wound, leading to Arya leaving him
- Lysa's jealousy will be fleshed out at that point
Â 
episode 9:
- battle of the Wall (north and south), including Ygritte's death and Stannis, Stannis, Stannis
Â 
episode 10 (scenes not necessarily in the order listed):
Â 
Essos (7 minutes):
- dead farmer's girl - 2 minutes
- Dany chaining her dragons - 5 minutes
Â 
Beyond the Wall (10 minutes):
- Bran and co. arriving at Bloodraven's cave + fight with Wight's (10 minutes tops)
Â 
at the Wall (5 to 15 minutes):
- Stannis offering Winterfell to Jon in vain - about 5 minutes
- possibly Jon's election as Lord Commander, which - from a dramatic standpoint - would contrast very well with Stannis's offer, giving him the choice between honor/duty to the realm and honor/duty to one (wannabe) king - about 7 to 10 minutes, split between different scenes (beginning of election, possibly Sam's manipulations, result)
Â 
King's Landing (10 to 14 minutes):
- Jaime-Tyrion convo, in which Tyrion revels Cersei's secrets and Jaime reveals his (Tysha) - about 5 to 7 minutes tops
- Tyrion kills Shae and Tywin - 5 to 7 minutes tops
Â 
Eyrie (5 to 7 minutes):
- struggle between Lysa and Sansa, "Only Cat" - 5 to 7 minutes, tops
Â 
Riverlands (5 minutes):
- LS reveal (5 minutes)
- Arya leaving for Bravos (3 to 5 minutes)
Â 
This would make 58 minutes total and since we have 65, that would make it even more likely. And yes, I do think the viewers will be able to handle it. Anybody who can handle the RW shouldn't have too much of a problem here.

Well, that means Theon is in, no? Any idea what he will be doing?
6641	Konradsmith	2014-04-25	Man, the Children at 65 minutes is so awesome. That episode of the show may stay at ten on imdb.
Â 
As for how Dany's story will end, I imagine it will be her choosing which set of children she values more her dragons or her freed slaves.
Â 
EDIT: Aha! We have our previously on! Thank you Ignorant Bog Woman! I wonder if this means we'll just be getting Locke or if we'll get a big of Team Dreadfort too?

6642	Rashtibram	2014-04-25	The recap is actually quite revealing if you study it closely. We know now that the following plot points will be brought up again: Craster sacrificing his son, the question of Tommen's marriage, Tyrion telling Podrick to get out of King's Landing, and Roose sending Locke out after the Stark boys. At the very least, this helps clarify some of the murkier aspects of this week's episode, as I think we can now assume the following:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093>The scene from the trailers involving Rast sacrificing a baby will indeed be in this episode
â<U+0080><U+0093>Podrick will meet up with Brienne in this episode
â<U+0080><U+0093>Margaery is the one visiting Tommen after hours
â<U+0080><U+0093>Locke will in fact be one of Jon's recruits/volunteers for the mission north
6643	iheartseverus	2014-04-25	Seneti, nice job--and a lot of work!Â 
Â 
What does this mean?Â  What Cersei secrets?Â  You mean about her sleeping around?Â  If so, I assume the secret will just be about Lancel, since that's all we've seen?
Â 
King's Landing (10 to 14 minutes):
- Jaime-Tyrion convo, in which Tyrion revels Cersei's secrets
6644	Konradsmith	2014-04-25	I hope the "previously on" also means we get a bit of Roose. It'd be sad if we didn't see him until episode eight or ten after Moat Caillin.

She's been fucking Lancel and...you Jaime...that's about it. Also she is a vicious...well, actually Joffrey had all the bastards murdered. She tried to have Ser Mandon kill me...wait Joff too.Â
6646	King Tommen	2014-04-25	A few things you can tell from the Previously On:
Â 
1. The Theon scene is not about Theon or Ramsay, it's them talking about Bran and Rickon being out there and Jon probably being the one harboring them and finishes with Roose ordering Locke to go to Jon to see if he can find the kids. Translation: Locke will arrive at the Wall this episode.
Â 
2. They showed the S2 scene of Craster bringing the baby out to sacrifice to the WW which means we'll see Rast doing the same thing in this espisode.
Â 
3. They made a point of replaying the "163" crucified children scene so we'll surely get Dany reciprocating the favor with the masters
6647	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-25	You're right, King Tommen, I only just realized that and came here to correct myself. But that's already done.

I think it's just gonna be Locke. Oh man I cannot wait for his scenes, he has the best lines. Noah Taylor's work is really underrated.
6649	Colonel Green	2014-04-25	I know that some think the "Only Cat." moment will play out before the finale, but that idea doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me. What's more likely is that Littlefinger & Sansa will arrive at the Eyrie in this episode, and we'll be re-introduced to Lysa & Robin, as well as being introduced to the new characters they've cast at this location (including Lady Waynwood).Â 
Â 
It's also possible that the snow castle could be in this episode, and the writers have simply extended the amount of time between that event and when Lysa takes flight, but I kind of doubt it.Â 


From the IMDb it seems like Episode 7 is Robin's first episode (which I think guarantees it isn't the snow castle/Moon Door stuff), I'm less sure about Lysa since we have no information on Kate Dickie.
Â 
In terms of the Sansa/Littlefinger plot, we know that we see them in episode 4, 7 and 10, and that they aren't in episode 9.Â  That leaves episodes 5-6 and 8 as the question marks.Â  I tend to think they'll probably be in two of the three -- it's more a question of how they structure it.Â  This is mainly because I don't think that 1 episode is enough time to let the Sansa/Littlefinger/Lysa "triangle" play out, so I would guess either she does meet them at the Fingers in episode 6 (wedding optional), after they arrive there in episode 5, and thus they sit out episode 8; or they miss either episode 5 or episode 6 and episode 8 has more Eyrie material (and Robin just doesn't appear).

Â 
True that.
Â 
Feels like they could go some very interesting routes with Locke 'infiltrating' the Night's Watch.. I can't really predict how that will conclude - I could see him fleeing back to Roose after the ranging party returns (if he see's an Other no doubt he'll want to GTFO back south of the wall asap) but I could also see him being killed - since Ramsay did point out Jon Snow as being 'a threat'.. could see tense dialogue between the two leading up to some kind of attempt to kill JS during the chaos at Craster's.. who knows but I'm interested to find out.
Â 
Edit: The latter makes sense to me - not much point in having Locke go to the Wall and interact with Jon (from a show perspective that is) if Jon doesn't find out about his true intentions which works on a few levels.. plants the early seeds for the Roose/Ramsay/Jon dynamic next season as well as (if Jon comes to know Bran & Rickon are alive somewhere) makes his decision over Stannis' offer that much more difficult.. on the other hand I also like King Tommen's suggestion that Locke could spend significant time @ the Wall.

Locke is the stabber.Â
6658	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-26	Locke is the stabber.Â 


Yeah Locke can take on the role of Bowen Marsh, i mean that can be perfect use of this talented actor by giving him more screentime and making him Jon Snow's main nemesis.
It would also make sense him stabbing Jon snow just when he is riding south to fight Roose Bolton, Locke's employer.Â
6659	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	They may well do that but I think that would take away some of the power of that moment. Locke is a psycho whereas Bowen Marsh actually is very emotional about "having" to kill Jon. Locke wouldn't say "for the Watch" so much as "for the lolz" which isn't really the point of that scene. If they spare Thorne (if he manages to survive his duel with Tormund) then maybe he should play Bowen. I think it has to be a committed man of the NW for it to be powerful.

But Noah can make it look powerful.Â 
It makes perfect sense for his stabbing only to occur when he is off to fight Roose Bolton.Â 
Thorne I feel will be more of a Wex Pyke-Mallister mix, if he survives.Â 
I don't they think they will bring a new actor for Bowen, when they have an established actor such as Noah at their disposal.Â 
This all depends on whether he dies or not on the Battle of Castle Black and before that whether he survives the Craster's Keep ordeal or not.Â

Eric Bana would be a more serious suggestion as Australians go. But I like it when they cast comedians. Though of course Eric Bana did start out as a comedian before the old Chop Chop.

Great suggestions both of them.Â 
Eric Bana would be a bit costly though. I can see him pull off JonCon.Â
6665	Konradsmith	2014-04-26	^Yeah, it's too bad they didn't nab him earlier on. Eric Bana would've made a great Stark. I wasn't part of the fandom back while the show was in pre-production but I've heard that a lot of people fancasted him as Ned because of him being younger in the books. On the subject of Aussies, I remember at one point people saying that Mel Gibson should've been Stannis. They may have been being sarcastic but I liked the idea of Mel getting onto TV. In spite of everything (and maybe in a way because of everything) I still really like the insane bastard.

I understand all of this is off-topic. I'll try and come up with an on-topic post when I'm finished watching the latest episode of Hannibal.

6668	Arkash	2014-04-26	Burn Gorman and Noah Taylor in the same scene would be epic !Â 
Â 
A lot of dynamics could emerge from Locke staying at the Wall, but I doubt he'll be the one to stab Jon.
Â 
On the Tormund / Thorne duel... I'm quite sure Thorne will go down, but I wonder who will present himself to the election afterwards ?
Â 
Janos Slynt and some unnamed brother ?
6669	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-26	They may well do that but I think that would take away some of the power of that moment. Locke is a psycho whereas Bowen Marsh actually is very emotional about "having" to kill Jon. Locke wouldn't say "for the Watch" so much as "for the lolz" which isn't really the point of that scene. If they spare Thorne (if he manages to survive his duel with Tormund) then maybe he should play Bowen. I think it has to be a committed man of the NW for it to be powerful.


Aye I was just playing and I agree, can't see Locke ever shedding a tear in his whoreson life, let alone in stabbing a lad he believes he has to for duty. I must say when I first saw Locke I was like...Wow, it's Vargo! Then after a moment of dissatisfaction to know he was some new guy, I really loved his take on this new merged style character. Interested to see how he does going to the Wall...maybe he plays some kind of weird mix of the Karstarks and is one of the traitors plunked in an ice cell when Stannis or Jon learns he's a Bolton man through and through?Â
6670	Mel_Rose	2014-04-26	But Noah can make it look powerful.Â 
It makes perfect sense for his stabbing only to occur when he is off to fight Roose Bolton.Â 
Thorne I feel will be more of a Wex Pyke-Mallister mix, if he survives.Â 
I don't they think they will bring a new actor for Bowen, when they have an established actor such as Noah at their disposal.Â 
This all depends on whether he dies or not on the Battle of Castle Black and before that whether he survives the Craster's Keep ordeal or not.Â 


I don't think it's a case of who's a good actor. The whole point of Jon's stabbing is that it's a betrayal by his sworn brothers. Locke and the Rooses, as we have seen, see Jon as a threat, a possible Stark that might claim Winterfell, so stabbing him is what we expect from Locke. We don't expect the betrayal though. It is the climax of people dissatisfied with Jon's decisions. It's the motivation behind it that makes it a big deal, not that the fact that he's stabbed.
Â 
It might not be Bowen as such, but I think (and hope) it will be a prominent member of the Watch.

6671	Tyranno	2014-04-26	I see a lot of people speculating Thorne will die. But could they really replace him? It's been a while since I've read the books, but wasn't the ranging he was sent on at least somewhat important? I think Thorne could play a somewhat important part in TWOW and maybe ADOS.Â 
Also, why would they kill him? Keeping him alive would make sure Jon would still have an antagonist after he kills Janos. They could keep his part the same for a big part of the story.Â

I love the actor, he's kickass, I think he and Tormund do the old "Fight to a draw" kind of thing where both look awesome, but neither gets the killing blow...or Thorne is the one who gets the head wound and becomes paranoid about Wildlings?Â

They did imply that Qyburn was giving Cersei moon tea(or possibly fucking her ).
6674	Mordos_Kull	2014-04-26	They could do a Karl and introduce a NW character next season who is a bit of a obstacle for Jon, it wouldn't be hard to manage, given that most of the NW are just random men, and not of any position, where you'd need a proper introduction.

Indeed Meryn Trant is the epitome of 'the Company Man' .. and fear not, my post was more jest than it was 'wouldn't it be cool if they included this'..
Â 
Also at this point I wonder if the casual audience even remembers who Lancel is and remembers that Cersei took him into her bed.. they can always pop it into the "episode review" since by then Jaime/Cersei's relationship will likely have broken down to the point where it doesn't matter.. when reading it in the books Jaime did not seem nearly as upset about it as Lancel (would be funny to get that exchange next season)

6683	Seneti	2014-04-27	The recap is actually quite revealing if you study it closely. We know now that the following plot points will be brought up again: Craster sacrificing his son, the question of Tommen's marriage, Tyrion telling Podrick to get out of King's Landing, and Roose sending Locke out after the Stark boys. At the very least, this helps clarify some of the murkier aspects of this week's episode, as I think we can now assume the following:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093>The scene from the trailers involving Rast sacrificing a baby will indeed be in this episode
â<U+0080><U+0093>Podrick will meet up with Brienne in this episode
â<U+0080><U+0093>Margaery is the one visiting Tommen after hours
â<U+0080><U+0093>Locke will in fact be one of Jon's recruits/volunteers for the mission north


Â 
This.
Â 


A few things you can tell from the Previously On:
Â 
1. The Theon scene is not about Theon or Ramsay, it's them talking about Bran and Rickon being out there and Jon probably being the one harboring them and finishes with Roose ordering Locke to go to Jon to see if he can find the kids. Translation: Locke will arrive at the Wall this episode.
Â 
2. They showed the S2 scene of Craster bringing the baby out to sacrifice to the WW which means we'll see Rast doing the same thing in this espisode.
Â 
3. They made a point of replaying the "163" crucified children scene so we'll surely get Dany reciprocating the favor with the masters


Â 
And this. Really looking forward to this episode.
Â 


Seneti, nice job--and a lot of work!Â 
Â 
What does this mean?Â  What Cersei secrets?Â  You mean about her sleeping around?Â  If so, I assume the secret will just be about Lancel, since that's all we've seen?
Â 


Â 
Thanks. As for Cersei's secrets, I think it will be something along the lines of "She's been fucking Lancel and Gods know who else since you were gone!"Â 


Â 
"She's been fucking Lancel Lannister and Meryn Trant.. and possibly Maester Qyburn for all I know"

6686	Lord_Dustin	2014-04-27	I am very much looking forward to the scenes featuring Cersei.  Lena Headey has been phenomenal this season, so far.

I agree, Lena has been phenomenal from day 1. Too bad about character changes written in, but that's beside the point.
So, quick question. Is it confirmed that Ygritte won't die til episode 9? Everyone seems to think it'll be one massive battle from the north and south, but I feel like she has to die before then for us to get any character development from Jon for next season. Don't get me wrong, all the signs point to them extending her role, and I've heard of the "filming 3 major battles at once" quote, or some such.
Without sounding like a terrible person (it IS a fictional character!) I would love to see her and the Wildlings storm CB and die relatively soon. Any hope for this?

Actually, the words being written in the common tongue makes a kind of sense to me.Â  In the real world, that's known as 'the CNN effect.'Â  Presumably, the people in these slaver cities speak more than one language, probably 2 or 3 languages or more, since they're traders, merchants and therefore have to deal with other-speaking people all the time.Â  Even Dany speaks 3 languages that we know of.Â  So, when there's a great social upheaval which involves all the various sub-groups within the culture, its pretty instinctive to resort to the one language nearly everybody in their world understands, the 'common' language.Â  In our world, we see 'the CNN effect' all the time on tv.Â  When there's a huge uprising in a country in which English is not the first language, you'll see demonstrators carrying signs that say 'Down With Whoever!'Â  or 'Free Whoever NOW!' in English.Â  They're basically playing to the camera--in effect, playing to the world at large, creating a 'The Whole World Is Watching' phenom.

The Common Tongue is not, however, the "common" language of the world. That would be High Valyrian.
6692	~No One~	2014-04-27	All indications are that the show will have it as a simultaneous attack and have set this up ever since Mance Rayder said as much a year ago.

Yeah, I know it's likely, but I'll keep my fingers crossed anyways. Jon Snow could use the further character development
6693	Metopheles	2014-04-27	Maybe they did it just for the trailers and in the series it is in Valyrian with subtitles.
In other films it is similar. When released in other countries, the newspaper headlines change into the dubbed language. No joke, it's been done.
Â 
And I really hope they change it.
6694	Lady of the Wind	2014-04-27	It looks like the King's landing storyline in this episode is going to revolve around Jaime.


Â 
I feel like the King's Landing storyline revolves more or less around one character each epsiode (except the first) this season, making that character 'the main character'. In the second epsiode it was Joffrey, the third Tywin and the fourth Jaime (it seems). I really like it, it makes the episode feel more coherent and focused. I'm not sure if this is really a thing though, probably just wishfull thinking.
Â 
As for the next episode, I'm really looking forward to the Meereen scenes. Dany has mostly had big-moment-scenes lately and I hope her storyline will finally be fleshed out a bit. I think the Meereenese storyline could be more captivating on TV, since we have the opportunity to see events first-hand instead of constantly hearing things second-hand when Dany's holding court.

I'm not sure if this is really a thing though, probably just wishfull thinking.

I think that you are right here.  It seems like a conscious choice to feature one character above the others.  Sadly I think that this could become detrimental to the fifth season of the show.
Out of the main characters, Cersei is the only character to have not had a 'centric-episode' in the entire run of the show.  The closest thing that she has had is 'Blackwater'.  However, Cersei is going to be expected to carry the show's central location next season...
Â
6696	Arkash	2014-04-27	Well, next season, KL will revolve around Cersei and Marg above all, so I'm sure they'll have a lot of material to shine !

Â 
Exacly. And Natalie Dormer said in an interview that their relationship will become poisonous this season, which I think meens they will start building the Feast for Crows relationship. I generally see this season as sort of a transition season, where they finish the first part of the story and start shifting the focus from King's Landing to the Wall and Meereen. Maybe not much, but enough to make the audience understand that the story will change in future seasons. That way, the focus on the Wall and Meereen which will come next season (I assume) won't come out of nowhere.
6699	Harry Lime	2014-04-27	I too dont think she'll sleep with Trant, but I really wonder who will replace Moonboy and the Kettleblack.

Qyburn may work but I dont think so.
Â 
"Lancel and who knows." might work as well.

I'm thinking it will be: "She's been fucking Lancel, and Ser Dontos for all I know."
Â 
Like the "Raegar fought valiantly..." line, it will be shortened, but will have the same effect.
6700	salmonsnake	2014-04-27	Yeah, I think the fact that they're hurrying up so much with Bran's arc precisely means that the KL will not be the central location next season, and this will mark a distinct change in style for the entire show, as the 'mere steward house' of Lannisters will be less important than what surrounds them. And what has been latent so far, in supressed myths, legends, ideologies, dreams, prophesies, memories and fates, will start flowing onto the screen via Bran. Or else I will have misunderstood the entire Song of Ice and Fire.

6703	iheartseverus	2014-04-27	My quibble with them adding anyone but Lancel to Tyrion's spilling Cersei's secret to Jaime is that the audience didn't see or hear of anyone else except Lancel all this time.Â  So if Tyrion adds Trant, Dontos, whoever, the audience will be confused, conflicted between 'What?Â  She did?Â  When?'Â  and 'Wait, is Tyrion lying about Cersei sleeping with all those guys?'Â

Yep, the lack of Cersei's dalliances is a big issue for me.Â
6705	juanml82	2014-04-27	Keep in mind Jaime and Cersei's relationship in the series is different than the books. In the show, they have already broken up for good. I think a troublesome issue is that they aren't bringing up Tysha's story again, so the audience has it fresh when/if Jaime makes the reveal. Maybe they'll skip it completely?
6706	King Tommen	2014-04-27	Cersei did heavily imply in her conversation with Jaime in E1 that she's moved on from him. The "you were too late" line is proof of that. Whether we'll be given specific examples of her conquests remains to be seen but as far as Jaime goes, he's already got the seed planted in his head at this point.

It was referenced a few times in season 3. I'm not sure where they were supposed to have brought it up so far this season. Plenty time for that.Â

Â 
This. And there is a difference in just how much effect subtitles would achieve. I mean... What would seem more threatening? "Kill the masters" written in blood on a dirty wall or in a sterile subtitle? A subtitle is a detached add-on, used only when absolutely necessary, that diminishes the impact of its message (unless said message contains swear words - those always seem more brutal when written than when spoken).
Â

Â 
I'm pretty sure they'll bring Tysha up again once Tyrion sees Shae testifying against him - he was "tricked" by his first love and now by his second love. The moment that Shae testifies, everything she ever said to him becomes a lie (in Tyrion's mind) and that makes her Tysha 2.0.Â
6709	Metopheles	2014-04-27	Do you all believe that the unsullied have alzheimers or some very bad memory that they have to remember them all the time about certain plot aspects?
Look how smoothly they did the Dontos thing.
Â 
And it would be extremely easy to show the Tysha thing at the very moment of Tyrions release
Jaime: you remember Tysha?
Tyrion: The whore you gave me and father made me watch her being raped, yes, no hard feelings, I love you, brother, I long forgave you
Jaime: She was no whore, I lied.
Tyrion: Fuck you. Cersei never loved you, I will one day kill you. I killed Joffrey.
Â 
easy as that.
6710	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	They'll have plenty of opportunities to bring up Tysha and reacquaint the audience with Tyrion's resentment about what happened to her in the episodes between now and the finale. Particularly after Shae testifies against him, he will think aboutÂ hisÂ onetime wifeÂ even more because she never betrayed him. He could discuss her with Bronn, with Oberyn, with Jaime even as he acts in Kevan's capacity as pseudo-counsel. Also Jaime and Bronn could discuss it while they practise sparring.

6712	Chuck88	2014-04-27	Do you all believe that the unsullied have alzheimers or some very bad memory that they have to remember them all the time about certain plot aspects?
Look how smoothly they did the Dontos thing.
Â 
And it would be extremely easy to show the Tysha thing at the very moment of Tyrions release
Jaime: you remember Tysha?
Tyrion: The whore you gave me and father made me watch her being raped, yes, no hard feelings, I love you, brother, I long forgave you
Jaime: She was no whore, I lied.
Tyrion: Fuck you. Cersei never loved you, I will one day kill you. I killed Joffrey.
Â 
easy as that.



Yep. File under 'The show never references Rhaegar' because we go three or four episodes without hearing the name.Â 
Â 


Any word on Roose and Ramsay this ep?



They appear in the 'previously on' segment but I think it might be suggesting that Locke will make another appearance this episode rather than those two. Hope they appear at some point though.Â https://www.youtube....h?v=2s-1sIlUDuk
6713	Metopheles	2014-04-27	They mentioned Ned's beheading every episode, though one episode they didn't, and the next week they said Ned was beheaded, I cried my eyes out, because Ned was dead 
Â 
I also kinda like it how they always refer to each other with their names, sometimes even titles. Like I do this with my friends all the time. We never just say a sentence into the others face, we always go full name and titles, so the others in the bar all know.

Well he was the last dragon.
But I didn't catch it anyway that Rhaegar is mentioned that often. Mybe 10 times during all episodes so far.

Sad thing is, they never said Beggar King to Viserys.
6716	King Tommen	2014-04-27	I've seen them do this in previous years but TV Guide has altered the following episode synopses very slightly from what they had before:
Â 

Â 
Mockingbird Season 4, Episode 7
May 18, 2014
Â 
Brienne follows a new lead on the road with Podrick; Tyrion finds a surprising ally; Jon's warnings about the Wall's weaknesses are ignored; Daenerys mulls giving Daario a longer leash.
Â 

The Laws of God and Men Season 4, Episode 6
May 11, 2014
Â 
Tyrion faces his father in the throne room; Stannis and Davos put their faith in a new strategy; Daenerys' sphere of influence expands.
Â 

First of His Name Season 4, Episode 5
May 4, 2014
Â 
Jon starts a new mission; Cersei and Tywin consider the next move for the Crown; Daenerys makes plans for the future.
Â 

Â 
The Dany stuff is different and I believe the Stannis stuff is too. Kind of the same connotation but phrased differently.

Yeah but when reading the books, you don't have that problem, do you? And the show covers one book in 10 hours, reading a book takes longer and all. I don't know how to explain this, but why would there be such a need to reintroduce characters that often?
Â 
If I remember correctly, in Breaking Bad they did not have to reintroduce characters that much. Especially the vacuum guy. He was mentioned very early in the second or third season and then in the fifth, after countless of months between it.
Â 
Book readers give the tv guys way too few credit.
Â 
And I hope it doesn't become to a yellow umbrella thing like in himym where literally every episode states how the mother will look and all, as if the viewer forgets it every time.
6723	Arkash	2014-04-27	Yeah, but in the books you have the name written quite anytime the character speaks and photographic memory of the written name is stronger than auditive memory of just hearing it once or twice.
6724	King Tommen	2014-04-27	The books mention character names in each scene which is why book readers have no issue remembering who anyone is. That's just how books work, they have to set the scene so every single time we switch to a different scene and every time somebody speaks, we get to read what their name is.
Â 
A TV show has a scene with lots of characters in it but rarely do we actually get their names mentioned unless it can be brought up somewhat organically. That's why if you ask a show-only viewer who a minor character is, they're much more likely to be able to give you a physical description ("guy with the eye patch") or their defining character trait ("Dany's translator girl"). It doesn't mean they understand the show any less but in any tv show, names are going to be hard to come up with unless you pay attention religiously to the recaps. So sometimes the show has to cheat and bring up a person's name (and what they're motivation is) occasionally to remind the audience. Especially a show that literally has almost a hundred characters going at the same time.
6725	BlueDragon	2014-04-27	Holy shit. Just realized Burn Gorman was the dude from Dark Knight rises.Â 


Â 
Burn's major role was in the Dr. Who spin off: Torchwood where he plays a very good guy.
6726	Metopheles	2014-04-27	I am sorry, but I am an unsullied first, and the only problem I faced was Roose and Stannis looked somehow familiar, though as soon as the scene unfolded you knew he was either he or the other.
Maybe I am just with way too good memory for such things, but I never had a problem with such things.

Â 
So you knew the guy training the NW recruit's name was Aliser Thorne or the Archer guy in the Brotherhood was called Anguy and who the hell Rickon was? How about Salladhar Saan? Dagmer Cleftjaw? Vardis Egen? Marillion? Rorge and Biter? There is no way you would be able to retain this information just by watching the show unless you became obsessed with it and went and looked up lots of info on it online in addition to watching the show.
Â 
I love Boardwalk Empire and I consider myself a very attentive tv-watcher and I often forget what everyone's name is (outside of the main characters and the real-life gangsters). It's not a crime.
6728	Yelloweyedemon	2014-04-27	I just don't see the reason to why they cut Coldhands. (if he is indeed cut, considering that John Bradley was talking about his character with coldhands only).
Not only it elliminates any hope the book readers had to see more from him/his backstory and identity in the next two books, it also makes it kinda dump how a company of mainly kids and a direwolf made it that far north of the wall without help.
Â 
I get it that having CH walking around on a giant Elk would be overkill even for a show like GoT, but cutting an important character completelly?

Â

Â 
I would take this omission as a very good sign that Coldhands doesn't really do shit in the final 2 books and has served his purpose. If he was important, they would have kept him.
Â 
As for the logistics of them making it North without a guide, the show has done two different things to counter this. For one, they are all armed with Dragonglass from Sam which was not the case in the books. Meera even got some dragonglass arrowheads so if they are in contact with WW's, they have the means to defend themselves.
Â 
Secondly, they've established very early this season that Bran can speak directly with Bloodraven through the weirwoods and he can follow his commands as to where to find him.
Â 
There are strong indications that in the finale, they will all reach the outside of the cave where they will have the big WW/wight encounter and will be saved by the Children of the Forest.
Â 
So knowing all this, is there really any logistical reason to include Coldhands?

Â 
Well, I am a series guy. Especially one where new characters are introduced all the time.Â 
Thorne is easy to remember. Anguy I remembered who he was, but not his name, as he wasn't mentioned, only once mumbled, but I knew what he did. Rickon, I mean how could one forget this guy and the name? Salladhor for sure, I mean a guy that is named that way..cellar door, donnie darko, anyone?; Cleftjaw..wasn't named really, but I knew him when he was onscreen, and after reading the books I remembered him even the more, because of the clefted jaw. Vardis Egan, am what to remember? he came up only once. Marillion was never named.
Rorge and Biter have not been named really, I guess once, and I admit only after rewatching I caught it that they were the guys from the cage.

6732	Metopheles	2014-04-27	What is so important with Coldhands? He was a guy on an elk who was not really alive. I mean that is something special, but he is not that important. What is the obsession with him anyway? :'D

Â Look at dany storyline so far. Through three episode her council really hasn't had time to say anything. You add irri, belwas, shavepate, etc it only becomes worse.

Some of us find an undead dude who is kinda described "Nazgul-looking", riding a giant Elk and having a totally mysterious backstory or existance reason, more impressive than having half the episodes involve Cersei crying about her life in King's landing...

Â 
A good portion of the reason most readers are interested in him is because they think his "mysterious backstory" is going to lead to an important revelation or that he'll play more of a role later on in the books. If neither is the case, then he's not nearly as interesting as seeing more of what the WW's are up to or to get a better sense of who Bloodraven is. These story elements are far more important than Coldhands.
Â 
He wasn't cut for time, so don't bother with trying to equate those scenes with other scenes that aren't connected to Bran's story. If D&D felt like he was important to Bran's story, they would have included him.

I'm so with you, can't for the life of me understand the obsession with CH. Not that people like this character, that's cool. Just don't see why he had to be in the show.
Â 
As for the names, most of the viewers who watch every single episode still call some characters by a definitive characteristic. Not to mention that, although Daenerys has announced her name a million times, still loads of non-book readers call her Khaleesi.

I never said that he is THE most important part of the books. I'd rather see more about Bloodraven or CoTF, but those things won't come for quite some time now.
Â 
And also no he was not cut because he (might) not have an important role later on. He was cut (if he is indeed cut) about budget as metioned here above as well. Everyone can see this.

Because we are watching a FANTASY novel. We would rather see more of dragons, undead, assassins with strange powers, magical beings etc, than some people talking in a capital.

Burn's major role was in the Dr. Who spin off: Torchwood where he plays a very good guy.


He's a really good actor. I had a chance to catch him in Oliver (of all things) in London's West End. The big draw to that show was Rowan Atkinson as Fagen, but Gorman was the one I can remember the most. Really got the audience hating him
6740	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-27	I think mostly people is disappointed with the lack of Coldhands not because he's not important or liked but because instead of Coldhands, we have whores and nudity and invented characters.

If they have the budget to show WW and wights in more than one scene this season, they could have had Coldhands no problem. There is way more CGI necessary to do all of that stuff. Coldhands is an actor under a hood.

Â 
Again, that's not true. These stories are all independent of each other. They thought there was a better and more dramatic way for Bran to have his journey than putting a mumbling guy on an elk who disappears on them. Perhaps they felt like them being on their own and fighting their own battles was a better choice. Maybe they wanted to involve Bloodraven earlier (which they have) by having him actively guiding Bran through the weirwoods instead of through a third party.

You have more faith in the showrunners than I do. George himself has expressed concern over Rakharo having been killed off in Season 2 because he plays an important role later on, so I don't think that you should be taking the showrunners' decision to cut certain characters as being complete gospel in regards to their future roles in the series.
6744	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	I think GrrM has overstated aspects of the butterfly effect. Like with Mago, it wouldn't be too hard to just make up an antagonistic khal without it being him.Â As for the guyÂ who played Rakharro, heÂ chose to leave and shoot World War Z, forcing D and D to kill him off to make sense of his sudden absence. That wasn't a creative choice so much as it was a practical choice. He couldÂ only came back to film his one scene in the North Remembers, so they made that change.
Â 
It was a loss. Especially because his part in WWZ was cut down to almost nothing.

I realize that, but even so, I'm highly sceptical of this idea that if a character doesn't make it into the television series they have no substantial future role in the books. The fact that they already have an enormous cast points to budget concerns as a potential reason that Cold Hands might be cut.

Like they weren't in the books.
the only new character that is a horrible addition is this weirdo Olyvar. I think he is some lame character who has absolutely no talent or effect. Ros was amazing. Sad she had to go(I know the reasons).

But really, the nudity isn't that much more. Most of it comes from having new scenes involving a LF pov.

And as mentioned, it's not a big deal because even if Mago comes back later on to play a bigger role, the show can easily substitute any random Dothraki in to that spot and it wouldn't make any kind of difference because Mago was a non-entity on the show.

SO MUCH!
Â 
Why Rakharo? That actor was amazing and the character too. I can't understand why he left. His "role" in world war z was smaller than an appearance in an episode of got.
That death was just the biggest wtf moment in terms of character change.
6750	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	I concur with King Tommen on the Mago front. They could even bring back that guy who Jorah slashed across the face and retcon that he lived, if they really want it to harken back to Dany's S1 arc.

A Dance With Dragons is dedicated to a friend of mine, (though admittedly along with a good number of other people) and he had a conversation with George about his concerns over Rakharo being cut from the show. Take from that what you will. The point however, is that basing all your speculation regarding the future importance of certain characters on whether or not they're in the television series is really dumb.

6754	King Tommen	2014-04-27	I'm also very skeptical of when GRRM says that a character is "important" later on because if I were to take him at his word, then almost every single character he's put into the story plays some integral part in the series endgame which is obviously not going to be the case. More likely, he's just overly precious and possessive of all of the characters he's created so when he says "they're important", I take it to mean "I'm still going to mention them again."

I totally agree with you. It's just disappointing, because I feel like Coldhands would have really done a lot for Bran's arc, which both in the books and the television series is a little stale to me. And yeah Rakharo is one of Dany's primary bloodriders. I have no specifics on what future importance he has though, only whispers.

About coldhands, I really want to see him, hope he gets introducted as bloodraven bodyguard or something, but that's just foolish hope i think 


Â 
Mayhaps we'll need our nitpicking with impunity threadÂ before the episode airs this week...that bothered me as wellÂ
6759	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-27	^I think Bran's arc will be pretty exciting this season actually. This Craster's Keep invented stuff looks promising and it will be cool to see how the show pulls off Bloodraven and the CoTF.


Honestly I thought most of Bran's arc in season 3 was a snooze fest until they got further north and that kid who plays Rickon came out of nowhere with some really impressive acting. I'm interested in the shit at Craster's though, especially since the fact that they've changed up the arc a bit so us book readers don't know exactly how it all plays out.
6760	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	^Bran's dreams last season were cool but that skinning rabbits scene was a real dud. I do understand the need for place-holder scenes though. I liked Queenscrown quite a lot and his ep. 10 material.

6761	King Tommen	2014-04-27	A Dance With Dragons is dedicated to a friend of mine, (though admittedly along with a good number of other people) and he had a conversation with George about his concerns over Rakharo being cut from the show. Take from that what you will. The point however, is that basing all your speculation regarding the future importance of certain characters on whether or not they're in the television series is really dumb.


Â 
The point is with these minor characters like Rakharo, they barely have been established on the show with anything approaching a unique characterization. Rakharo is a Dothraki who is loyal to Dany. If there is a specific Dothraki loyal to Dany who becomes really important in the books later on, they can elevate someone randomly into that spot without missing a beat (as they did with Kovarro in S2). Kovarro is basically Rakharo on the show now since they unceremoniously had to kill him off due to the actor taking his movie role.
Â 
Coldhands though, you would have a hard time replacing as he's a fairly unique character so it would be tougher to pull the same move. That would signify to me that you either put him on the show or you don't based on his importance. Since he's not being included at all, I assume he's not important. It's not like they don't include tons and tons of characters from the books big or small. At and Beyond the Wall, they didn't have to include the Reeds, Dolorous Edd, Pyp, any COTF etc but they did because they added enough to the story to warrant inclusion. Coldhands doesn't and I believe it's because they see that his whole purpose is to be Bran's guide and they would like to give Bran a little bit more responsibility in this journey and a more direct connection to Bloodraven.
6762	Metopheles	2014-04-27	What you all missed
Â 
Why is Sam not yet considered the biggest asshole?
He did not swear not Â to tell about Bran. Leaving poor Jon ignorant of the fact that his brothers are dying out there. tsk tsk tsk.

Â 
They didn't really address it (maybe they will now that the NW has to go north of the wall to deal with the Craster Crew), so for all we know, Sam did tell Jon.
Â 
I do hope we get some closure on this one way or the other, though.
6764	Konradsmith	2014-04-27	Maybe Locke will come out and say "Where are your brothers?" And Jon will say "Theon Greyjoy burnt them..." Locke will say "No, he didn't, your hiding them!" And then Sam will look all guilty. "I promised...it was offscreen but I still promised..."

good catch..
Â 
But I hope that Styr makes Jon some house warming present of Locke sausage.
I mean fuck that they changed that. I was so anticipating the scenes when Jaime is told that his crippler was being eaten by himself.. At least give the Thenns a taste of Locke leg.
They already butchered the Thenns, why not Locke?
6766	MR92	2014-04-27	I just don't see the reason to why they cut Coldhands. (if he is indeed cut, considering that John Bradley was talking about his character with coldhands only).
Not only it elliminates any hope the book readers had to see more from him/his backstory and identity in the next two books, it also makes it kinda dump how a company of mainly kids and a direwolf made it that far north of the wall without help.
Â 
I get it that having CH walking around on a giant Elk would be overkill even for a show like GoT, but cutting an important character completelly?


I know everyone is sayign CH is cut because John Bradley announced it...but why havent david and dan? or George? I mean are we really going by what JOhn Bradley says? I mean yeah hes a main character in the show, but they really know nothing...And do they have the authority to annouce something like that? I just dk why David , Dan or George have been vey quiet on this subject...unless someone knows something otherwise? Â I havent had much faith in them adding CH, so im not optimistic hell be in there at all...im just confused why we are all listening to John Bradley.Â

Again, it is not about if he's that much important or not. He's impressive and mysterious by nature. He's exactly a character you would like to see in a FANTASY novel.Â 
Â 
Same goes for Leaf. Bloodraven. The kindly old man. etc...
Â 
I'd rather chose any of those than what we get. (Good 5+min sex and nudity in each episode involving the red viper, or Cersei crying)

Â 
Did you get an HBO press release about Strong Belwas being cut? They don't go out of their way to announce those types of things. It just kind of becomes self-evident when you watch the show and they aren't there.
Â 
Casting announcements which happened last summer were always a good time to figure this out. Bloodraven, Styr, the Thenn warg played by Joseph Gatt and a COTF were announced as being cast and there was no Coldhands to be seen. That was a good clue. Him not showing up with Sam and Gilly in S3 was an even better one.

Â 
Then complain to GRRM because 90% of his novels have nothing to do with fantasy, or at least the supernatural fantasy you're referencing. They are very tiny elements in a larger story he's telling.
Â 
Bran (who is now in the most overtly traditional fantasy journey) has had exactly 3 chapters of material in the last 2 books so maybe your complaint about how much emphasis is placed on other settings is being made to the wrong people.

Amen and THANK YOU... My thoughts exactly. You have a good point with the John Bradley thing, although I believe CH will not be making an appearance. I saw a con interview with Maisie Williams on YouTube and when asked about watching scenes that she did not film, she said that it doesn't happen and the scenes she does not appear in, she watches on TV like everyone else. So your argument isn't off base at all.

You're arguing for the sake of arguing. What good will it do to complain to George about the show when he basically has no control over the content besides what he writes himself? And taking in consideration the massive amounts of correspondence he receives, and the fact that TWOW is long overdue, let's not waste the man's time. In my opinion, you're wrong that the books are 90% "nothing to do with fantasy" -- the books are fantasy. Have you ever been to a country, or heard of a country, that had a ten-year summer? Or families who have magical abilities in their bloodlines? The books are littered in fantasy if you care to notice....

I said complain to GRRM because it's the source material (the books) that make a point of focusing a ton of material on the political machinations and wars that are based on the War of the Roses campaigns. The things that are more traditionally "fantasy" are very much limited and doled out in very small doses throughout the series.
Â 
As I mentioned, it was the overtly "supernatural fantasy" the guy I was responding to was referencing (i.e. Bloodraven, CH, COTF, dragons, magic etc). He was going on and on about how the show focuses on its non-fantasy elements but I don't think the fantasy elements are in any different ratio than the books are. You can look no further than the chapter distributions and see who gets the bulk of the material dedicated to them to see this.

Â 
You are right about the very small doses, but I think those are of utmost importance... but I understand what you are saying, and respect that.
Â 
TBH, the show does include a lot of the fantasy - dragons, WW, resurrection, visions, skinchanging, wildfire - and in each episode there is something. I think they do a good job with it. I understand budget constraints, though, so I'm only a bit disappointed at no CH. It just would have been awesome to see it from the book to the screen. 
Â 
I don't like some of the other elements that are present a lot of the time (like he/she said, the sex and the at-times needless drama) but I am pretty pleased at the amount of fantasy -- they're so talented at putting it onto the screen, I wish there were more!
